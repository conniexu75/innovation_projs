https://openalex.org/W1567490604,"One hallmark of Alzheimer disease is the accumulation of amyloid beta-peptide in the brain and its deposition as plaques. Mice transgenic for an amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) mini-gene driven by a platelet-derived (PD) growth factor promoter (PDAPP mice), which overexpress one of the disease-linked mutant forms of the human amyloid precursor protein, show many of the pathological features of Alzheimer disease, including extensive deposition of extracellular amyloid plaques, astrocytosis and neuritic dystrophy. Active immunization of PDAPP mice with human amyloid beta-peptide reduces plaque burden and its associated pathologies. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding the mechanism of this response. Here we report that peripheral administration of antibodies against amyloid beta-peptide, was sufficient to reduce amyloid burden. Despite their relatively modest serum levels, the passively administered antibodies were able to enter the central nervous system, decorate plaques and induce clearance of preexisting amyloid. When examined in an ex vivo assay with sections of PDAPP or Alzheimer disease brain tissue, antibodies against amyloid beta-peptide triggered microglial cells to clear plaques through Fc receptor-mediated phagocytosis and subsequent peptide degradation. These results indicate that antibodies can cross the blood-brain barrier to act directly in the central nervous system and should be considered as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and other neurological disorders."

https://openalex.org/W1974618081,"Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases the production of interleukin-12 (IL-12) from mouse macrophages via a κB site within the IL-12 p40 promoter. In this study, we found that oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL) inhibited this LPS-stimulated production of IL-12 in a dose-dependent manner while native LDL did not. OxLDL inhibited p40 promoter activation in monocytic RAW264.7 cells transiently transfected with p40 promoter/reporter constructs, and the repressive effect mapped to a region in the p40 promoter containing a binding site for nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (p40-κB). Activation of macrophages by LPS in the presence of oxLDL resulted in markedly reduced binding to the κB site, as demonstrated by the electrophoretic mobility shift assays. In contrast, native LDL did not inhibit the IL-12 p40 promoter activation and NF-κB binding to the κB sites, suggesting that oxidative modification of LDL was crucial for the inhibition of NF-κB-mediated IL-12 production. 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, a major oxidized lipid component of oxLDL, significantly inhibited IL-12 production in LPS-stimulated mouse macrophages and also suppressed NF-κB-mediated activation in IL-12 p40 promoter. The NF-κB components p50 and p65 directly bound peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) <i>in vitro</i>. In cotransfections of CV-1 and HeLa cells, PPAR-γ inhibited the NF-κB transactivation in an oxLDL-dependent manner. From these results, we propose that oxLDL-mediated suppression of the IL-12 production from LPS-activated mouse macrophages may, at least in part, involve both inhibition of the NF-κB-DNA interactions and physical interactions between NF-κB and PPAR-γ."

https://openalex.org/W2096047184,"We have investigated the mechanism of inhibition and site of action of the novel human metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (hmGluR5) antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP), which is structurally unrelated to classical metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) ligands. Schild analysis indicated that MPEP acts in a non-competitive manner. MPEP also inhibited to a large extent constitutive receptor activity in cells transiently overexpressing rat mGluR5, suggesting that MPEP acts as an inverse agonist. To investigate the molecular determinants that govern selective ligand binding, a mutagenesis study was performed using chimeras and single amino acid substitutions of hmGluR1 and hmGluR5. The mutants were tested for binding of the novel mGluR5 radioligand [3H]2-methyl-6-(3-methoxyphenyl)ethynyl pyridine (M-MPEP), a close analog of MPEP. Replacement of Ala-810 in transmembrane (TM) VII or Pro-655 and Ser-658 in TMIII with the homologous residues of hmGluR1 abolished radioligand binding. In contrast, the reciprocal hmGluR1 mutant bearing these three residues of hmGluR5 showed high affinity for [3H]M-MPEP. Radioligand binding to these mutants was also inhibited by 7-hydroxyiminocyclopropan[b]chromen-1a-carboxylic acid ethyl ester (CPCCOEt), a structurally unrelated non-competitive mGluR1 antagonist previously shown to interact with residues Thr-815 and Ala-818 in TMVII of hmGluR1. These results indicate that MPEP and CPCCOEt bind to overlapping binding pockets in the TM region of group I mGluRs but interact with different non-conserved residues.

At present, eight mGluR1 subtypes (mGluR1 through mGluR8) have been cloned and functionally expressed (1Knoepfel T. Kuhn R. Allgeier H. J. Med. Chem. 1995; 38: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 2Conn P.J. Pin J.-P. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1997; 37: 205-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (2708) Google Scholar). Based on their amino acid sequence homologies, pharmacology, and functional profiles, these subtypes are classified further into three groups. Members of group I (mGluR1 and -5) stimulate the activity of phospholipase C and mobilize intracellular Ca2+. Members of group II (mGluR2 and -3) and group III (mGluR4, -6, -7, -8) inhibit adenylyl cyclase. Despite the differences in primary structures and functional roles, all mGluRs feature a large conserved N-terminal extracellular domain, which is involved in the recognition of agonists and competitive antagonists (3O'Hara P.J.

Monn J.A. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1431-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). Recently, novel subtype-selective group I mGluR antagonists emerged that are structurally unrelated to amino acids and to each other. The first non-amino acid-like antagonist described was CPCCOEt (Fig. 1), a selective mGluR1 antagonist (10Annoura H. Fukunaga A. Uesugi M. Tatsuoka T. Horikawa Y. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1996; 6: 763-766Crossref Scopus (166) Google Scholar, 11Casabona G. Knoepfel T. Kuhn R. Gasparini F. Baumann P. Sortino M.A. Copani A. Nicoletti F. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1997; 9: 12-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). CPCCOEt inhibits receptor activity by a non-competitive mechanism which does not affect the binding affinity of glutamate (12Hermans E. Nahorski S.R. Challiss R.A. Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1645-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 13Litschig S. Gasparini F. Rueegg D. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Vranesic I. Prezeau L. Pin J.-P. Thomsen C. Kuhn R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). Molecular characterization of the site of inhibition in mGluR1 revealed that CPCCOEt interacts with two non-conserved residues at the top of transmembrane (TM) helix VII (13Litschig S. Gasparini F. Rueegg D. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Vranesic I. Prezeau L. Pin J.-P. Thomsen C. Kuhn R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). The first described selective mGluR5 antagonists, SIB-1757 and SIB-1893 (Fig. 1), are also unrelated to amino acids and were shown to act via a non-competitive mechanism (14Varney M.A. Cosford N.D.P. Jachec C. Rao S.P. Sacaan A. Lin F.-F. Bleicher L. Santori E.M. Flor P.J. Allgeier H. Gasparini F. Kuhn R. Hess S.D. Velicelebi G. Johnson E.C.J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999; 290: 170-181PubMed Google Scholar).To address the question whether these structurally unrelated mGluR1 and mGluR5 antagonists interact with different sites of the mGluR subtypes or share a common binding site in the 7TM domain, we have studied the binding site and mode of action of the selective mGluR5 antagonist MPEP (15Gasparini F. Lingenhöhl K. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Heinrich M. Vranesic I. Biollaz M. Allgeier H. Heckendorn R. Urwyler S. Varney M.A. Johnson E.C. Hess S.D. Rao S.P. Sacaan A.I. Santori E.M. Veliçelebi G. Kuhn R. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1493-1503Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). MPEP is a novel derivative of SIB-1893 with nanomolar potency (Fig. 1); it is an effective antihyperalgesic in animal models of chronic inflammatory pain (16Walker, K., Bowes, M., Panesar, M., Davis, A., Gentry, C., Kesingland, A., Gasparini, F., Spooren, W., Stoehr, N., Pagano, A., Flor, P. J., Vranesic, I., Lingenhoehl, K., Johnson, E. C., Varney, M., Urban, L., and Kuhn, R. (2000) Neuropharmacology, in press.Google Scholar), a neuroprotectant in excitotoxin-induced striatal lesions (17Bruno V. Ksiazek I. Battaglia G. Lukic S. Leonhardt T. Sauer D. Gasparini F. Kuhn R. Nicoletti F. Flor P.J. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 2223-2230Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and an anticonvulsant in several epilepsy models (18Chapman A.G. Nanan K. Williams M. Meldrum B.S. Neuropharmacology. 2000; 39: 1567-1574Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). We generated a number of chimeric receptors and point mutations in which segments or single residues of hmGluR5 were exchanged with the corresponding residues of hmGluR1 andvice versa. These mutants were tested for inhibition of glutamate-induced calcium signals by MPEP and for binding affinity of [3H]M-MPEP (Fig. 1), a closely related radioligand with a KD of 3.5 nm. We found that the key amino acids for selective and high affinity binding of [3H]M-MPEP to hmGluR5 are Pro-655 and Ser-658 in TMIII and Ala-810 in TMVII. The reciprocal mutations in the hmGluR1 background were sufficient to impart high affinity [3H]M-MPEP binding otherwise absent in the wild-type mGluR1. Furthermore, [3H]M-MPEP binding to these mutants was inhibited by CPCCOEt, suggesting that the subtype-selective antagonists MPEP and CPCCOEt bind to overlapping binding pockets in the TM region of group I mGluRs. These experimental findings are plausibly explained by a three-dimensional model of the mGluR5-MPEP complex that we constructed departing from the bovine rhodopsin structure.MATERIALS AND METHODSCompoundsMPEP and CPCCOEt were synthesized as described previously (15Gasparini F. Lingenhöhl K. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Heinrich M. Vranesic I. Biollaz M. Allgeier H. Heckendorn R. Urwyler S. Varney M.A. Johnson E.C. Hess S.D. Rao S.P. Sacaan A.I. Santori E.M. Veliçelebi G. Kuhn R.

[3H]M-MPEP was synthesized using 2-methyl-6-(3-hydroxy-phenylethynyl)pyridine as starting material by methylation with tritiated methyliodide. Further details of the synthesis and characteristics of the radioligand will be published elsewhere. 2I. Vranesic, personal communication. Glutamate was obtained from Tocris (Bristol, United Kingdom). Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma (Buchs, Switzerland).PlasmidsCDNAs encoding wild-type hmGluR1b and hmGluR5a and the chimeric hmGluR1/5a and hmGluR5/1b receptors termed p254, p255, p317, p257, p305, p306, p310, and p322 were described previously (13Litschig S.

Neuropharmacology. 1998; 37: 1043-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar), respectively.Cell Culture and TransfectionsChinese hamster ovary and L cell lines stably expressing human mGluR1b and -5a were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal calf serum as described previously (13Litschig S. Gasparini F. Rueegg D. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Vranesic I. Prezeau L. Pin J.-P. Thomsen C. Kuhn R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). For radioligand binding experiments, wild-type and mutant cDNAs were transfected into COS1 cells using the DEAE-dextran method (23Al-Moslih M.I. Dubes G.R. J. Gen. Virol. 1973; 73: 189-193Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). For measurements of intracellular [Ca2+]i, mutant cDNAs were transiently expressed in HEK293 cells by electroporation using a Gene Pulser apparatus (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 5 μg of plasmid DNA were used to transfect 1.5 × 106 cells in a total volume of 150 μl of electroporation buffer (K2HPO4, 50 mm; CH3COOK, 20 mm; KOH, 20 mm, pH 7.4). After electroporation (250 V, 300 microfarads), cells were resuspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. 5 × 105 cells were plated on glass coverslips (9 × 18 mm) coated with 100 mg/ml poly-d-lysine (Sigma).IP and [Ca2+]i MeasurementsCells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates and were labeled to equilibrium with myo-[3H]inositol at 2 × 10−6 Ci/ml in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 20 h. Preincubation with LiCl, stimulation with agonist and/or antagonist, and extraction of total inositol phosphates (IP) were performed as described previously (13Litschig S. Gasparini F. Rueegg D. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Vranesic I. Prezeau L. Pin J.-P. Thomsen C. Kuhn R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). For the experiments addressing constitutive receptor activity, the cells were incubated in the presence of a glutamate-degrading enzyme (1 unit/ml glutamate pyruvate transaminase plus 2 mmpyruvate), 1 h before and during the incubation period with LiCl, except when cells were stimulated by added glutamate. Concentration-response curves were obtained by fitting the four-parametric logistic equation to the data using Prism2.0 (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA).Microfluorimetric measurements of [Ca2+]i were performed as described previously (13Litschig S.

Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar).Ligand BindingMembranes from transfected COS1 cells were collected 2 days after transfection. Cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and mechanically detached in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 10 mm EDTA. Cells were centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C and resuspended in binding buffer (30 mm NaHepes, 110 mm NaCl, 1.2 mmMgCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2.5 mmCaCl22H2O, pH 8.0). Cells were then disrupted on ice with a Polytron homogenizer for 20 s, and membranes were collected by centrifugation at 18,000 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in binding buffer, homogenized with a Teflon homogenizer, and used immediately for binding. Ligand binding assays were performed using [3H]M-MPEP and cold M-MPEP (10−6m) to determine nonspecific binding.2 Briefly, samples consisted of 200 μl of membrane suspension (50 μg), 25 μl of radioligand (2–30 nm), and 25 μl of binding buffer. The reaction was terminated after a 30-min incubation at 25 °C by dilution and rapid filtration through Whatman GF/B glass fiber filters. The filters were washed three times with cold binding buffer, and the bound radioactivity was counted using a β-counter in 5 ml of Ultima Gold NV Packard (Canberra Packard, Zurich, Switzerland). Specific [3H]M-MPEP binding was defined as total binding minus nonspecific binding in the presence of 1 × 10−6m cold M-MPEP. In one experiment all measurements were performed in duplicate. Saturation analysis and competition curves were analyzed using Prism2.0 (GraphPad Software).Molecular ModelingConstruction of a hmGluR5 Transmembrane Domain ModelTo suggest a plausible binding mode of MPEP to hmGluR5, a seven-transmembrane model was built and optimized using the programs SYBYL (SYBYL 6.4 software; Tripos Inc., St. Louis, MO) and X-PLOR (X-PLOR 3.1 software; Molecular Simulations, Inc., San Diego, CA) based on the α-carbon template of the transmembrane helices of the rhodopsin receptor family (24Moro S.

Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). In brief, seven individual polyalanine standard α helices of lengths 27, 27, 35, 25, 30, 30, and 24 were built, and each helix was superimposed on the corresponding helix of the α-carbon template derived from the rhodopsin family of GPCRs (25Baldwin J.M. Schertler G.F.X. Unger V.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 272: 144-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). The root-mean-square distances of these superimposed C-α atoms of TM helices I–VII were 0.14, 0.79, 0.19, 0.13, 0.84, 1.35, and 0.12, respectively.All 198 alanines were mutated according to the putative assignment of transmembrane segments given in Table IIby making the corresponding side chain changes of alanines. All prolines were fixed using the SYBYL Biopolymer FIX_PROLINE command, hydrogen atoms were added with the ADDH command, and Gasteiger partial charges were computed with the CHARGE GAST_HUC command. Owing to the presence of charged residues (arginines (4Takahashi K. Tsuchida K. Tanabe Y. Masu M. Nakanishi S. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab This raw model was optimized with X-PLOR using the conjugate gradient method and the Tripos force field (X-PLOR/TAFF). Harmonic restraints with a force constant of 1.0 kcal/mol Å were applied to the initial coordinates of all 198 C-α and 188 C-β atoms. Minimization was carried out until the gradient grad(E) and the energyE were 0.4 kcal/mol A and −1814 kcal/mol Å, respectively.The extracellular domain between TMVI and TMVII is, according to our sequence assignment to helical transmembrane segments, formed by a short sequence of about four residues, which may be part of the binding pocket. A plausible third extracellular loop between helix VI and VII was searched with SYBYL/BIOPOLYMER/LOOP assigning residues Asn-796, Tyr-797, and Met-802 as anchor regions and the four residues Lys-798 to Thr-801 as window region. A loop with a sequence homology of 26% and a root-mean-square fit of 0.22 of backbone atoms in the anchor region was selected for the automatic construction of the loop. After calculation of all partial charges the model was again minimized (X-PLOR/TAFF, grad(E) = 0.4 kcal/mol Å, E = −1870 kcal/mol) using the same constraints of the previous minimization.Docking of MPEPTo this initial mGluR5 model we have manually docked MPEP with the pyridine N-atom accepting a H-bond from the hydroxyl group of Ser-658 of helix III and the 2-methyl in hydrophobic contact with the pyrrolidine ring of Pro-655 also in helix III. This model was optimized in 48 independent runs using an X-PLOR molecular dynamics protocol involving heating from 25 to 500 K in 2 ps and cooling again to 25 K in 2 ps, followed by 2000 steps of TAFF/X-PLOR minimization while keeping harmonic restraints to the previous reference coordinates of C-α and C-β atoms.Docking of CPCCOEt to the Mutant hmGluR5-M802T,S805AThe initial receptor model of hmGluR5-M802T,S805A was obtained by changing in the initial wild-type hmGluR5 model the side chains of Met-802 and Ser-805 into respective threonine and alanine side chains, recalculation of partial charges, and X-PLOR/TAFF minimization. To this model CPCCOEt was manually docked such that its oxime group formed a contact with the hydroxyl group of Thr-802 and its benzene moiety was pointing down into the transmembrane region between TMIII and TMVII. Optimization of this complex was performed as described above for the complex of MPEP with wild-type hmGluR5.DISCUSSIONThe major findings of this study concern the involvement of the hmGluR5 7TM domain in the high affinity binding of MPEP, which mediates non-competitive inhibition. This suggests that MPEP inhibits receptor activity without changing the affinity of glutamate to its binding site, and thus MPEP might act at a receptor site different from the glutamate binding domain. In agreement with this hypothesis is the inability of MPEP to displace [ 3V. Mutel, personal communication.H]quisqualate binding to rat mGluR5a3 and the lack of effect of mGluR5 agonists on [3H]M-MPEP binding.2In addition to its non-competitive antagonist action, MPEP also decreased basal IP production in the absence of an agonist in cells transiently overexpressing rat mGluR5a indicating an inverse agonist activity. Indeed, increased basal receptor activity was still detected in the presence of the glutamate transporter EAAC1 and the glutamate degrading enzyme glutamate pyruvate transaminase, conditions expected to drastically decrease the extracellular glutamate concentration to levels below that required for activation of mGluR5. As previously reported for rat mGluR1a (8Parmentier M.-L. Joly C. Restituito S. Bockaert J. Grau Y. Pin J.-P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1998; 53: 778-786Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), co-expression of rat mGluR5a with the G protein Gαq further increased basal IP production. The competitive antagonist MCPG did not block any basal IP formation at a concentration of 3 mm but almost fully inhibited the action of glutamate. This shows that the basal activity does not result from the activation of the receptor by an endogenous agonist, and therefore likely results from the constitutive activity of the receptor. In contrast, when MPEP was applied alone on cells expressing mGluR5a or mGluR5a plus Gαq, a significant but not complete inhibition of the basal activity was detected. This inverse agonism of MPEP, so far not described for other antagonists of family 3 (mGluR-like) GPCRs, was dose-dependent and in agreement with the potency of MPEP in inhibiting the effect of glutamate.Studies of a large number of antagonists of family 1 (rhodopsin-like) GPCRs led to the hypothesis that these receptors oscillate between (at least) two conformational states, an inactive and an active one. Agonists stabilize the receptor in the active state. Antagonists, divided in two categories, are either neutral antagonists, which have the same affinity to both the inactive and active conformational state, or inverse agonists, which stabilize the inactive state and therefore inhibit the constitutive activity. In contrast to family 1 GPCRs, mGluRs and other family 3 GPCRs consist of two distinct domains, the large extracellular agonist binding domain and the 7TM region, which directly interacts with the G proteins. As none of the known competitive mGluR1 antagonists interacting at the glutamate binding site have been shown to inhibit constitutive activity of mGluRs (27Prezeau L. Gomeza J. Ahern S. Mary S. Galvez T. Bockaert J. Pin J.P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1996; 49: 422-429PubMed Google Scholar), we speculate that the constitutive activity of mGluRs might result from an equilibrium between two conformational states of the 7TM region rather than from an equilibrium between an active and inactive state of the agonist binding domain. According to this hypothesis, one is expecting that non-competitive antagonists acting on the 7TM region of mGluRs are more likely to act as inverse agonist than competitive antagonists acting at the extracellular glutamate binding site.A detailed molecular investigation using chimeric receptors and point mutants of hmGluR5 and hmGluR1 revealed that MPEP binds to and interacts with Ala-810 in TMVII and Ile-651, Pro-655, and Ser-658 in TMIII, respectively. Replacement of Ala-810 with valine, the homologous residue of hmGluR1, completely abolished [3H]M-MPEP binding and MPEP inhibition of glutamate-induced [Ca2+]i responses. Single replacement of Pro-655 and Ser-658 with the corresponding residues of hmGluR1 reduced the binding affinity of [3H]M-MPEP from 3.5 nm to 27.1 and 16.5 nm, respectively. However, a combination of both mutations lacked any significant binding affinity for [3H]M-MPEP, indicating the importance of both residues for radioligand binding. Likewise, introduction of Pro-655, Ser-658, and Ala-810 from hmGluR5 at the corresponding position of hmGluR1 generated a hmGluR1 mutant with a high affinity binding site for [3H]M-MPEP (KD = 20 nm), indicating that these residues are critical molecular determinants for [3H]M-MPEP binding. A further 2-fold increase in binding affinity was achieved by introduction of Ile-651, mutation of which showed no change in binding affinity in wild type hmGluR5a. Because the combination of Pro-655, Ser-658, Ile-651, and Ala-810 is unique to mGluR5 and not found in the homologous position of other mGluR subtypes, it provides a molecular explanation for the high pharmacological selectivity of MPEP.It has not yet been determined whether the structurally unrelated non-competitive antagonists MPEP and CPCCOEt interact with different sites of mGluR subtypes or share a common binding site in the TM domain. We showed in a previous study that two residues unique to hmGluR1, Thr-815 and Ala-818 on the extracellular surface of TMVII, were responsible for the selective action of the non-competitive mGluR1 antagonist CPCCOEt (13Litschig S. Gasparini F. Rueegg D. Stoehr N. Flor P.J. Vranesic I. Prezeau L. Pin J.-P. Thomsen C. Kuhn R. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 55: 453-461PubMed Google Scholar). The present study shows that binding of the mGluR5 antagonist MPEP requires an interaction with Ala-810 further down in the transmembrane helix VII as well as additional interactions with Pro-655 and Ser-658 in TMIII. Using hmGluR1 and -5 mutants (R1-V664I,S668P, C671S,V823A and R5-M802T,S805A), which show functional inhibition by MPEP and CPCCOEt, we unequivocally demonstrated complete inhibition of [3H]M-MPEP binding by CPCCOEt in a concentration dependent manner. This is further supported by docking studies of MPEP and CPCCOEt to 7TM domain models. These models suggest that the pyridine ring of MPEP precisely occupies the same space between TMVII and TMIII as the benzene ring of CPCCOEt, providing a molecular explanation for the displacement of MPEP by CPCCOEt. However, other parts of these antagonists do not overlap and suggest interactions with different TM helices. Thus, although MPEP and CPCCOEt are structurally unrelated, they recognize overlapping binding pockets in the 7TM region of group I mGluRs that are sufficiently diverse to allow subtype-specific interaction with different classes of compounds.These findings may have important implications for the design of novel mGluR antagonists. Up to now, most compounds acting at the eight subtypes of mGluRs are phenylglycines or rigidified amino acid analogs such as LY354740 (9Schoepp D.D. Jane D.E. Monn J.A. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 1431-1476Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar). These compounds possess a wide spectrum of agonist, partial agonist, and antagonist a"

Human X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) is a potent inhibitor of caspases-3, -7, and -9. Here we show that the Bir3 domain is the minimal region of XIAP that is needed for potent caspase-9 inhibition. The three-dimensional structure of the Bir3 domain of XIAP, determined by NMR spectroscopy, resembles a classical zinc finger and consists of five α-helices, a three-stranded β-sheet, and a zinc atom chelated to three cysteines and one histidine. The structure of the Bir3 domain is similar to that of the Bir2 domain of XIAP but differs from the previously determined structure of the Bir3 domain of MIHB. Based on site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified the regions of the Bir3 domain of XIAP that are important for inhibiting caspase-9.

Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6205) Google Scholar). One class of proteins that negatively regulates cell death signaling is the inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs).1 IAPs are highly conserved and have been found in many species (2Hay B.A. Wassarman D.A.

The members of this family are characterized by having one or more baculovirus IAP repeats called Bir domains. Bir domains consist of approximately 70 amino acids that contain the characteristic signature sequence CX 2CX 16HX 6C (7Crook N.E. Clem R.J. Miller L.K. J. Virol. 1993; 67: 2168-2174Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 8Uren A.G. Coulson E.J. Vaux D.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Some IAPs also contain a C-terminal ring finger that contains one zinc atom chelated to three cysteines and one histidine and another zinc ligated to four cysteines (9Saurin A.J. Borden K.L.B. Boddy M.N. Freemont P.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 208-214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (613) Google Scholar). One of the major functions of the IAPs is their ability to bind to and inhibit the cysteine proteases known as caspases (10Hawkins C.J. Uren A.G. Häcker G. Medcalf R.L. Vaux D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad.

Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Caspase inhibition by the IAPs can directly explain their antiapoptotic activities. For human XIAP, the region responsible for inhibiting caspases-3 and -7 was localized to a fragment containing the second Bir domain (13Takahashi R. Deveraux Q. Tamm I. Welsh K. Assa-Munt N. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7787-7790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Although the Bir domain was necessary for caspase-3 inhibition, residues outside of the Bir2 domain were also found to be critical for inhibiting caspase-3 (14Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). On the basis of site-directed mutagenesis and NMR studies on the interaction of XIAP with caspase-3, it was postulated that the residues N-terminal to the Bir2 domain of XIAP bind to the active site of this enzyme (14Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). XIAP also inhibits caspase-9. However, a different portion of XIAP is involved. Recently, Deveraux et al. (15Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar) have shown that it is the Bir3 and ring finger of XIAP that potently inhibits caspase-9. Since neither the ring finger nor the Bir3 domain of XIAP was sufficient to inhibit caspase-9, it was postulated that the ring finger may function to stabilize the Bir3 domain in a conformation required for caspase-9 inhibition (15Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar). Three-dimensional structures of the Bir2 domain of XIAP (14Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar) and the Bir3 domain of MIHB (cIAP-1) (16Hinds M.G. Norton R.S. Vaux D.L. Day C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) have been reported. The structure of the Bir2 domain of XIAP resembles a classical zinc finger and consists of four α-helices and a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet. The structure of the Bir3 domain of MIHB, on the other hand, was reported (16Hinds M.G. Norton R.S. Vaux D.L. Day C.L. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 648-651Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) to be an α-helical protein with a fold not previously observed for zinc-binding proteins. In this paper, we have identified the minimal region of XIAP that is required for inhibiting caspase-9. In contrast to earlier studies (15Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), we find that the ring finger is unnecessary for potent caspase-9 inhibition. The Bir3 domain alone is sufficient. We have also determined the three-dimensional structure of the Bir3 domain of XIAP. The structure of this protein is compared with the previously determined structures of the Bir2 domain of XIAP and Bir3 domain of MIHB. Finally, on the basis of site-directed mutagenesis, we have identified amino acids of XIAP that are important for caspase-9 inhibition. XIAP (residues 241–497) was cloned from a Jurkat cDNA library into the pET-28b vector (Novagen). C-terminal deletions were created by introducing a stop codon at the appropriate positions. Site-directed mutants were prepared using the Quick-Change mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The coding region in all of the plasmids was confirmed by sequencing. The protein (residues 241–356) used in the structure determination was expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) (Novagen). Uniformly 15N/13C-and15N-labeled proteins were prepared by growing bacterial cells in a minimal medium containing a trace amount of Zn(Ac)2 and 15NH4Cl with or without uniformly 13C-labeled glucose. Recombinant proteins were purified using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen) followed by gel filtration (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The N-terminal His tag was cleaved with thrombin (Novagen), leaving four extra residues (GSHM) at the N terminus. NMR samples contained 1.7 mmprotein in 50 mm bis-Tris-d 19(pH = 7.2), 300 mm KCl, 50 μmZn(Ac)2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. NMR spectra were acquired at 30 °C on a Bruker 500-, 600-, or 800-MHz NMR spectrometer. The 1H, 15N, and 13C resonances of the backbone and side chains were assigned using a standard set of double and triple resonance experiments (17Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Methods. Enzymol. 1994; 239: 349-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The prochiral methyl groups of Val and Leu were stereospecifically assigned by recording an HSQC spectrum of a 15% 13C-labeled sample of the protein (18Neri D. Szyperski T. Otting G. Senn H. Wüthrich K. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 7510-7516Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar). Distance restraints were derived from15N- and 13C-resolved three-dimensional NOE spectroscopy. Slowly exchanging amide protons were identified from a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra after the H2O buffer was exchanged to a buffer containing2H2O. Residual dipolar couplings were measured as described previously (19Tjandra N. Omichinski J.G. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Bax A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1997; 4: 732-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar, 20Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. Bax A. J. Magn. Reson. 1998; 133: 216-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) using a13C/15N-labeled sample of the protein dissolved in a solution containing phage at a concentration of 17 mg/ml. In the first step of the structure calculations, 577 unambiguous NOEs, 62 hydrogen bond restraints, and 84 φ or ϕ angular restraints derived from the TALOS program (21Cornilescu G. Delaglio F. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 289-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (2740) Google Scholar) were incorporated into a torsion angle dynamics (22Stein E.G. Rice L.M. Brünger A.T. J. Magn. Reson. Ser. B. 1997; 124: 154-164Crossref Scopus (283) Google Scholar) and simulated annealing protocol (23Nilges M. Gronenborn A.M. Brünger A.T. Clore G.M. Protein Eng. 1988; 2: 27-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar) using the program CNX (MSI Inc., San Diego, CA). A single family of low energy structures was obtained from these calculations that defined the overall fold. Refinement of these initial structures was accomplished using the ARIA protocol (24Nilges M. Macias M.J. O'Donoghue S.I. Oschkinat H. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 269: 408-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (388) Google Scholar). New NOE assignments were accepted from ARIA if they agreed with the manually derived NOEs. From 8 iterations, 1280 unambiguous and 904 ambiguous NOE assignments were derived. In the final round of refinement, 46 N-H, 26 Cα-Hα, 30 HN-C′, and 43 Cα-C′ residual dipolar couplings were used along with the NOE-derived distance restraints, angular restraints from TALOS, and hydrogen bond restraints. Caspase-9 inhibition was measured using a truncated form of the enzyme that lacks the N-terminal caspase recruitment domain. This form of the enzyme has the full catalytic activity and the same substrate specificity as the full-length protein. 2J. S. Krebs and J. C. Wu, unpublished data.LEHD-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Calbiochem) was used as the substrate in the caspase-9 assay. The reaction mixture (200 μl) contained 0.55 nm caspase-9 and 25 μm substrate in the assay buffer (20 mm Hepes, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Chaps, 10% sucrose, and 5 mm dithiothreitol) at pH 6.5. The activity was measured at 30 °C by monitoring the formation of fluorescent 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin over time at 460 nm using an excitation wavelength of 360 nm. IC50 values were calculated from the percentage of inhibition measured using various concentrations of XIAP proteins. XIAP proteins were prepared as 8 μm stock solutions in the assay buffer and subsequently serially diluted to give a 10-point curve. In each assay, a control inhibitor (DEVD-aldehyde) was included. To identify the minimal region of XIAP that inhibits caspase-9, a series of truncated XIAP proteins were expressed in bacteria, purified, and tested for their ability to inhibit recombinant caspase-9 in vitro (Fig. 1). We also tested the ability of these proteins to inhibit a panel of caspases (caspase-1, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9). Consistent with earlier results (15Deveraux Q.L. Leo E. Stennicke H.R. Welsh K. Salvesen G.S. Reed J.C. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5242-5251Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), a fragment of XIAP containing the Bir3 domain and ring finger was found to specifically inhibit caspase-9. However, in contrast to this earlier study, we found that the ring finger is unnecessary for caspase-9 inhibition. Indeed, much smaller proteins containing only the Bir3 domain were sufficient to inhibit caspase-9 (Fig. 1). The reason for this apparent discrepancy was investigated by characterizing the shorter protein (residues 261–336) used in the previous work by NMR spectroscopy. The amide protons observed in an15N-1H correlation spectrum of the uniformly15N-labeled protein appeared in a relatively narrow frequency range. These results strongly suggest that the protein is unfolded and can explain why the short protein was unable to inhibit caspase-9. The smallest protein that was folded and potently inhibited caspase-9 contained residues 241–356 (Fig. 1). This protein was chosen for the structural studies.Figure 1Schematic representation of the truncated XIAP proteins along with their inhibition constants (IC50values) against caspase-9.

A total of 2475 NMR-derived restraints were used in the structure calculations (Table I). Fig. 3 depicts the ensemble of 20 structures of the Bir3 domain of XIAP that were derived from the NMR data. The root mean square deviation about the mean coordinate positions in the ensemble for residues 255–345 is 0.70 ± 0.07 Å for the backbone atoms and 1.41 ± 0.16Å for all heavy atoms. The N terminus (residues 241–254) and C terminus (residues 345–356) corresponding to the amino acids outside of the Bir3 domain are disordered. However, the Bir3 domain is well defined except for residues Ile-276 through Asn-280 and Thr-308 through Glu-314.

The β-sheet is followed by α3 (residues 316–322), α4 (residues 327–333), and α5 (residues 336–342), which are nearly perpendicular to one other. α5 packs against α3 and forms a hydrophobic cluster involving Trp-317, Ile-339, and Ile-342. These interactions appear to be important and can explain why the shorter protein (residues 261–336) lacking the C-terminal α-helix is unfolded and unable to inhibit caspase-9. The surface of the Bir3 domain is depicted in Fig.6. In addition to the conserved hydrophobic residues (Phe-272, Leu-284, Phe-289, Val-298, Leu-330) that form the core of the Bir3 domain, there are several hydrophobic residues that are exposed on the surface, including Phe-270, Trp-275, Val-279, and Trp-310. Also noteworthy is a patch of negatively charged residues on the surface, which is composed of Glu-314, Asp-315, and Glu-318 (Fig. 6). On the other side of the protein, there is a cluster of positively charged residues (Arg-268, Arg-258, and Lys-299). The structure of the Bir3 domain of XIAP is very similar to that of the Bir2 domain of XIAP (Figs. 4 and 5). They both contain a three-stranded antiparallel β-sheet, α-helices of similar lengths and orientations, a zinc atom chelated by three conserved cysteines and a histidine, and a hydrophobic core made up of highly conserved residues. The root mean square deviation between the Bir3 and Bir2 domain of XIAP is 1.5 Å for 49 residues located within the conserved secondary structural elements. The only difference is the presence of an extra C-terminal α-helix in the Bir3 domain. The residues that form the C-terminal α-helix are highly conserved in Bir3 domains but not in other Birs, suggesting that the C-terminal α-helix may be uniquely found in Bir3 domains. Indeed, the Bir3 domain of MIHB (Fig. 4 c) contains a C-terminal α-helix corresponding to the one found in the Bir3 domain of XIAP. In addition, like the Bir2 and Bir3 domain of XIAP, a zinc is chelated to three cysteines and a histidine. However, unlike the Bir domains of XIAP, the Bir3 domain of MIHB lacks a β-sheet, is missing α4, and has shorter α-helices for α1 and α3 (Figs. 4 and 5). These structural differences are surprising in view of the high sequence homology observed for the Bir domains (8Uren A.G. Coulson E.J. Vaux D.L. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 159-162Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In an earlier study (14Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar), we found that the residues of XIAP important for caspase-3 inhibition were located in a linker region between the Bir1 and Bir2 domains that contained a sequence (DISD) resembling the residues found in substrates and inhibitors of caspase-3. The substrate specificity for caspase-9 is different and consists of the consensus sequence (I/L/V)-X-X-D. Interestingly, a stretch of amino acids (VSSDRNI) that resembles the substrate consensus sequence for caspase-9 was found N-terminal to the Bir3 domain of XIAP. To determine whether these residues were important for caspase-9 inhibition, a truncated protein that lacked these residues was prepared. The truncated protein (residues 252–356) potently inhibited caspase-9 (Fig. 1). Furthermore, the mutation of Asp-247 to alanine, which would be predicted to alter caspase-9 inhibition if this region were important, shows no effect (IC50 ∼17 nm, Table II). Therefore, unlike the importance of the residues N-terminal to the Bir2 domain for caspase-3 inhibition, the analogous region N-terminal to the Bir3 domain is not required for the inhibition of caspase-9.Table IIInhibition constants (IC50) of XIAP mutants against caspase-9NameIC50NameIC50nmnmBir3-RF (241–497)11 ± 4E294A36 ± 10Bir3 (241–356)22 ± 9D309A26 ± 5D247A16 ± 2W310A>2 μMD264A31 ± 7E314S>2 μMF270K46 ± 12D315A64 ± 18W275A145 ± 3E318A31 ± 14I276A38 ± 11E332A38 ± 9Y277A84 ± 3E349A31 ± 6V279A161 ± 21H343A>1μME282A37 ± 11H346A24 ± 6R286A34 ± 10C351A19 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Several other mutant proteins were prepared and tested for their ability to inhibit caspase-9 (Fig. 6, Table II). Most of the mutant proteins showed no effect and potently inhibited caspase-9. However, mutation of Glu-314 to a serine completely abolished caspase-9 inhibition. In addition, an attenuation of casapse-9 inhibition was observed for W275A and V279A, and a complete loss of caspase-9 inhibition was observed for the W310A and H343A mutant proteins (TableII). In order to check whether the mutant proteins were properly folded,15N-labeled proteins were prepared for those mutants that displayed a large loss of caspase-9 inhibition, and their1H,15N-HSQC spectra were compared with a spectrum of the wild-type protein. With the exception of the W275A mutant protein, the spectra of the mutant proteins only displayed minor chemical shift differences compared with the wild-type protein, suggesting that the structures are very similar. As shown in Fig. 6, the residues that have the largest effect on caspase-9 inhibition (Glu-314, Trp-310, His-343) are all located in the same region of the protein. Glu-314 is part of a cluster of acidic residues that make up a negatively charged patch on the surface of the protein (Fig. 6). However, the other acidic residues of this patch (Asp-315 and Glu-318) do not appear to be important for caspase-9 inhibition because, when mutated to alanine, they show no loss of inhibitory potency (Table II). Trp-310 and His-343 are located on the edge of a basic patch that forms a shallow pocket on the protein surface. This site appears to be the region of XIAP that interacts with caspase-9. The IAPs play a critical role in the regulation of programmed cell death. One of their major functions is to bind to and inhibit the caspases, which if left unchecked could lead to massive cell death. XIAP potently inhibits both caspase-3 and caspase-9. The inhibition of caspase-3 is accomplished by binding of the Bir2 domain and residues N-terminal to the Bir2 domain to the enzyme (14Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In contrast, as shown here, only the Bir3 domain of XIAP is required to inhibit caspase-9. Residues N-terminal to the Bir3 domain or the ring finger are unnecessary for potent caspase-9 inhibition. The structure of the Bir3 domain of XIAP was found to be similar to the previously determined structure of the Bir2 domain of XIAP (14Sun C. Cai M. Gunasekera A.H. Meadows R.P. Wang H. Chen J. Zhang H. Wu W. Xu N. Ng S.-C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1999; 401: 818-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Despite these structural similarities, however, the amino acid residues in the Bir3 domain found to be important for caspase-9 inhibition are different from those necessary to inhibit caspase-3. Thus, XIAP employs a distinctly different mechanism to inhibit different caspases."

In different tree species, lignin content varies between 15 and 36% of the dry weight of wood (1Higuchi T. Higuchi T. Biosynthesis and Biodegradation of Wood Components. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1985: 141-160Crossref Google Scholar). Lignin is a major constituent of cell walls of fibers and tracheary elements and provides these cells rigidity for structural support and impermeability for water transport. For the production of high-quality paper, lignin is considered as a negative factor because it must be extracted from the cellulose fraction by energy-requiring and polluting methods. For this reason, there is considerable interest in modifying lignin by genetic engineering to improve its extractability from wood (2Baucher M. Monties B. Van Montagu M. Boerjan W. Crit. Rev. Plant Sci. 1998; 17: 125-197Crossref Google Scholar, 3Christensen J.C. Baucher M. O'Connell A.P. Van Montagu M. Boerjan W. Jain S.M. Minocha S.C. Molecular Biology of Woody Plants. 1.

Lignin monomer biosynthesis starts with the deamination of phenylalanine to produce cinnamic acid (Fig.1). Further enzymatic reactions include the hydroxylation of the aromatic ring, the methylation of selected phenolic hydroxyl groups, the activation of the cinnamic acids to cinnamoyl-CoA esters, and the reduction of these esters to cinnamaldehydes and cinnamyl alcohols. The precise order in which these reactions occur is not yet fully resolved. In dicotyledonous plants, lignin is composed mainly of guaiacyl (G)1 and syringyl (S) units that are monomethoxylated (C-3) and dimethoxylated (C-3, C-5) and derived from coniferyl alcohol and sinapyl alcohol, respectively. The lignin monomers are transported to the cell wall and are subsequently polymerized, resulting in the deposition of a cross-linked polymer. Although most of the lignin biosynthesis enzymes have been characterized at the molecular level, their precise role in determining lignin amount and composition still needs to be clarified.Figure 1Biosynthetic pathway for cinnamyl alcohols and production of side product phenolics. Enzymatic reactions involved in the cinnamyl alcohol biosynthesis in poplar are indicated in black. The formation of sinapoyl-CoA and its conversion to sinapaldehyde are indicated in blue; the relevance of these conversions in monolignol biosynthesis is uncertain, as mentioned above. Conversions leading to the synthesis of side product phenolics are indicated in red and are markedly up-regulated when CCoAOMT expression is reduced. The reduced flux from caffeoyl-CoA to feruloyl-CoA, caused by the down-regulatedCCoAOMT expression causes an elevated production of caffeic acid that is detoxified to GCA. GVA synthesis is probably up-regulated because of an increased availability of caffeic acid (48Funk C. Brodelius P.E. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 95-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Caffeic acid can be converted to sinapic acid by the sequential activity of COMT/AldOMT, ferulic acid 5-hydroxylase (F5H)/coniferyl aldehyde 5-hydroxylase (CAld5H), and COMT/AldOMT. Because of the lack of 4CL activity toward sinapic acid, it cannot take part in syringyl biosynthesis, and it is detoxified and stored as GSA.p-Hydroxybenzoic acid formation can be mediated by a β-oxidation mechanism (conversion 1) (47Funk C. Brodelius P.E. Plant Physiol. 1992; 99: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or, more probably, by an NAD-dependent p-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase (conversion 2) (52Schnitzler J.P.

Higuchi T. Biosynthesis and Biodegradation of Wood Components. Academic Press, Inc., Orlando, FL1985: 141-160Crossref Google Scholar). However, the analysis of transgenic tobacco and poplar with suppressed COMT activity has shown that COMT is mainly or exclusively implicated in the biosynthesis of S monomers (6Atanassova R. Favet N.

Later, it was shown that the methylation of the lignin precursors could also occur at the level of the cinnamoyl-CoA esters by caffeoyl-CoA-3-O-methyltransferase (10Ye Z.-H. Kneusel R.E. Matern U. Varner J.E. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1427-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar), and it was proposed that CCoAOMT was predominantly involved in the biosynthesis of G units. Transgenic tobacco plants down-regulated for CCoAOMT, however, had a reduced lignin amount, indicating that CCoAOMT regulates both G and S unit production (11Zhong R. Morrison III, W.H. Negrel J. Ye Z.-H. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 2033-2046Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Subsequently, in vitro activity assays have shown that COMT is also active at the cinnamoyl-CoA, cinnamaldehyde, and cinnamyl alcohol levels (12Meng H. Campbell W.H. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 38: 513-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 13Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Plant Physiol. 1999; 121: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and that 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde competitively inhibits the methylation of caffeic acid to ferulic acid and of 5-hydroxyferulic acid to sinapic acid (15Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Chiang V.L. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6537-6545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Additionally, coniferyl aldehyde has been demonstrated to inhibit the conversion of ferulic acid to 5-hydroxyferulic acid in a noncompetitive manner (13Osakabe K. Tsao C.C. Li L. Popko J.L. Umezawa T. Carraway D.T. Smeltzer R.H. Joshi C.P. Chiang V.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 8955-8960Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Together, these data, obtained fromin vitro enzymatic assays, have suggested that G and S units are biosynthesized via caffeoyl-CoA and feruloyl-CoA to coniferaldehyde and then diverted to S units via 5-hydroxyconiferaldehyde and sinapaldehyde. Furthermore, these data also suggested that the pathway from caffeic acid to sinapic acid is not used for lignin precursor biosynthesis. Given our sparse knowledge on the cell-specific localization of these enzymes in the different cell types of wood (16Chen C. Meyermans H. Burggraeve B. De Rycke R. Inoue K. De Vleesschauwer V.

Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 671-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), the metabolic outcome of altering one particular step of the pathway in vivo still remains largely unpredictable. Here, we have analyzed the metabolic consequences of reducing CCoAOMT production in transgenic poplar. We show that a down-regulation of CCoAOMT by 90% reduces the Klason lignin amount by 12%, increases the S/G composition ratio by 11%, and increases the content ofp-hydroxybenzoate in the lignin polymer. In addition, we demonstrate by HPLC (along with MS and 1H NMR) thatO 3-β-d-glucopyranosyl-caffeic acid (GCA),O 4-β-d-glucopyranosyl-vanillic acid (GVA), andO 4-β-d-glucopyranosyl-sinapic acid (GSA) accumulate in the methanol-soluble phenolics fraction of the transgenic wood. These data indicate that when the flux toward monolignol biosynthesis is reduced in vivo by down-regulating CCoAOMT, the pathway from caffeic acid to sinapic acid is followed. Furthermore, because the lignin amount is reduced and GSA accumulates up to 10% of the total soluble phenolics, our data indicate that sinapic acid is not used as a primary lignin precursor. All DNA recombinant techniques were performed essentially as described (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). The binary vector pBIBHYG (20Becker D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 203Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) is derived from pBIN19 (21Bevan M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 8711-8721Crossref PubMed Scopus (1812) Google Scholar), in which the neomycin phosphotransferase gene is replaced by the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene. This binary vector was used to transform poplar with four different constructs harboring DNA sequences from a Populus trichocarpa “Trichobel” full-lengthCCoAOMT-1B cDNA (accession number AJ224894), cloned in vector pBlueScript SK (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (plasmid name, pccoaomt-1b). The CCoAOMT sequences were placed downstream from the duplicated 250-bp upstream enhancer of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S RNA promoter (P70) (22Kay R. Chan A. Daly M. McPherson J. Science. 1987; 236: 1299-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (734) Google Scholar). A 5′ CCoAOMT PCR fragment was generated using primers 5′-AGAAGGGATCCACAATAATGGCC-3′ and 5′-GGCCATTGACAAGCTTCAAAAGC-3′ (priming at positions −17 and +240 relative to the ATG start codon ofCCoAOMT-1B, respectively), hereby introducing aBamHI site at the 5′-end of the coding region. AfterBamHI and HindIII digestion, the fragment was cloned in the BamHI/HindIII sites of vector pLBR19. pLBR19 is a pUC19-derived vector containing the P70 and the CaMV terminator sequence, kindly provided by L. Jouanin (INRA Versailles, France). Subsequently, the KpnI/XbaI P70-CCoAOMT fragment was cloned into theKpnI/XbaI sites of pBIBHYG, resulting in vector p5′-asCCoAOMT. A 571-bp HindIII/BamHI CCoAOMTfragment was generated by digesting pccoaomt-1b. This fragment was cloned into the HindIII/BamHI-digested vector OMTmutpBSrev, kindly provided by U. Matern (Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, Marburg, Germany), resulting in plasmid pCCmut. pCCmut was digested with KpnI and BamHI, and theCCoAOMT fragment was ligated in theKpnI/BamHI-digested pUC19. This construct was digested with EcoRI and BamHI and ligated inEcoRI/BamHI-digested pLBR19, resulting in pLBR19–571. The 1.9-kilobase pairKpnI/XbaI P70-CCoAOMT fragment, derived by partial digestion of pLBR19-571, was ligated in theKpnI/XbaI-digested pBIBHYG vector, resulting in vector pIn-asCCoAOMT. The 5′ CCoAOMT PCR fragment, obtained as described above, was cloned in pGEM-T (Promega, Madison, WI). This construct was digested with HindIII/PstI, and theCCoAOMT fragment was transferred into theHindIII/PstI site of pccoaomt-1b. The resulting plasmid was digested with BamHI and the fragment was cloned in the BamHI site of pLBR19 in the antisense orientation. This construct was digested with KpnI/XbaI and the P70-CCoAOMT fragment was ligated intoKpnI/XbaI-digested pBIBHYG, resulting in vector pFl-asCCoAOMT. Plasmid pccoaomt-1b was digested with PstI andKpnI, and the CCoAOMT fragment was ligated in thePstI/KpnI site of pUC19. This plasmid was digested with EcoRI, and the CCoAOMT fragment was ligated in the EcoRI site of pLBR19 in the sense orientation. This plasmid was partially digested with KpnI and XbaI, and the 2.5-kilobase pair P70-CCoAOMT fragment was ligated into theKpnI/XbaI site of pBIBHYG, resulting in vector psCCoAOMT. Wild-type Populus tremula × Populus alba (INRA, number 717 1-B4) was transformed with all four constructs. The transformation via Agrobacterium tumefaciens and regeneration procedures were essentially as described (23Leplé J.C. Brasileiro A.C.M. Michel M.F. Delmotte F. Jouanin L. Plant Cell Rep. 1992; 11: 137-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). One shoot was isolated from each stem explant to ensure that the transgenic lines were derived from independent transformation events. The PCR product described above was digested withBamHI/HindIII and ligated together with aHindIII/XhoI fragment from theCCoAOMT-1B cDNA into theBamHI/XhoI site of the pGEX-4T-1 expression vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), resulting in vector pGEX::CCoAOMT. CCoAOMT was expressed as a glutathioneS-transferase-CCoAOMT fusion protein. Fusion protein expression was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside after 4 h of bacterial growth, according to the Bulk and RediPack glutathione S-transferase purification protocol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was purified using the glutathione-Sepharose 4B RediPack columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The fusion protein was cleaved with thrombin. The glutathione S-transferase and CCoAOMT protein fragments were then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Approximately 200 mg of CCoAOMT protein, cut out from the polyacrylamide gel, was used for immunization of a rabbit according to standard procedures at the Laboratoire d'Hormonologie Animale (Marloie, Belgium). Samples were taken from the base of the stem of 6-month-old greenhouse-grown poplars. Xylem tissue was obtained by scraping a 5-cm debarked stem with a scalpel. This tissue was subsequently homogenized in liquid N2. Pink-red-colored and whitish xylem from line asccoaomt-1 were separated with a scalpel. Proteins were extracted with 60 mm Tris (pH 6.8) containing 0.03% (w/v) dithiothreitol and 0.5% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone and the proteinase inhibitor CompleteTM Mini (Roche Diagnostics, Brussels, Belgium). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was carried out according to standard procedures. Proteins were blotted on Hybond C super membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunodetection was performed according to standard laboratory methods, using an anti-rabbit IgG alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Diagnostics) and the color development reagents 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphatep-toluidine salt (Duchefa, Haarlem, The Netherlands) andp-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride (Duchefa). The titer of the CCoAOMT antibodies and anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies in the immunodetection procedure was 1:1500 and 1:2500, respectively. Alternatively, CCoAOMT protein amounts were quantified by measuring the hybridization intensities with a PhosphorImager 445SI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), after using 35S-labeled anti-rabbit IgG (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (dilution 1:2500) as secondary antibodies. Stem cross-sections (60 μm thick) were made from the base of 6-month-old greenhouse-grown poplars with a sledge microtome (Jung, Heidelberg, Germany). Mäule and Wiesner staining were performed essentially as described (6Atanassova R. Favet N. Martz F. Chabbert B. Tollier M.T. Monties B. Fritig B. Legrand M. Plant J. 1995; 8: 465-477Crossref Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Autofluorescence of stem cross-sections was observed with an Axioskop microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a fluorescence device using a filter combination of 450–490 nm excitation and 515–565 nm emission in conjunction with a 100-watt mercury burner. Klason lignin analysis, thioacidolysis, and analysis of low-molecular-weight phenolics released by mild alkaline hydrolysis were essentially as described (9Lapierre C. Pollet B. Petit-Conil M. Toval G. Romero J. Pilate G. Leplé J.-C. Boerjan W. Ferret V. De Nadai V. Jouanin L. Plant Physiol. 1999; 119: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar). For lignin isolation and subsequent NMR analysis, three to four stems from each line of 7-month-old poplars were pooled. Before the poplar stem cell walls were isolated, the stems were cut into 1–2-cm pieces and ground to pass a 1.0-mm screen of a cyclone mill (Udy Corp., Fort Collins, CO). Lignin isolations were essentially as described previously (24Ralph J. Hatfield R.D. Quideau S. Helm R.F. Grabber J.H. Jung H.-J.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 9448-9456Crossref Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 25Ralph J. MacKay J.J. Hatfield R.D. O'Malley D.M. Whetten R.W. Sederoff R.R. Science. 1997; 277: 235-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). Soluble phenolics, carbohydrates, and other components were removed by successive extractions with water, methanol, acetone, and chloroform. Most of the colored material was removed by the water and methanol extraction cycles. The isolated cell wall material was ball-milled, suspended in 50 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0), and treated with 30 mg of cellulase (Cellulysin; Calbiochem-Novabiochem, Bad Soden, Germany) per 1 g of ball-milled material. Cell wall digestions ran for 8 days with fresh enzyme and buffer being added after 2.5 and 5 days of incubation at 30 °C. The resulting lignin polysaccharide complex was subjected to fractionation in 96:4 (v/v) dioxane/water, reflective of standard “milled wood lignin” conditions (26Björkman A. Sven. Papperstidn. 1956; 59: 477-485Google Scholar). The final yields of the dioxane-soluble lignin fractions were 13.0, 11.2, and 11.6% of the total cell wall material, and 73, 72, and 69% of the total lignins for wild-type, sccoaomt-16, and sccoaomt-29, respectively. Isolated lignins (200 mg of each) were acetylated overnight with acetic anhydride/pyridine. The solvents were removed by coevaporation with 95% ethanol and traces of ethanol by coevaporation with acetone. The acetylated lignins were then extracted into CHCl3 and washed with aqueous EDTA (6 mm, pH 8.0) to remove trace metal contaminants. Proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were taken on a Bruker DRX-360 instrument (Bruker, Karlsruhe, Germany) fitted with a 5-mm 1H/broadband gradient probe with inverse geometry (proton coils closest to the sample). Acetylated lignins (EDTA-washed, 100 mg) were dissolved in 0.4 ml of acetone-d 6; unacetylated lignins (not EDTA-washed, 60 mg) were dissolved in acetone-d 6(0.35 ml) and deuterium oxide (D2O) (0.05 ml). The central acetone solvent peak was used as internal reference (δC29.80). Peaks for unacetylated and acetylatedp-hydroxybenzoic acid esters were assigned by comparison with data from methyl or ethyl p-hydroxybenzoates in the NMR Database of Lignin and Cell Wall Model Compounds, 2The NMR Database of Lignin and Cell Wall Model Compounds (S. A. Ralph, J. Ralph, W. L. Landucci, and L. L. Landucci) is available on the World Wide Web. entries 17, 18, and 94. Xylem tissue (approximately 100 mg) was obtained by scraping the debarked stem of 4-month-old greenhouse-grown poplars with a scalpel, homogenized in liquid N2, and extracted with 5 ml of methanol. The supernatant was dried, and samples were extracted with cyclohexane/water containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1:1, v/v). The phenolic compounds in the aqueous phase were separated and quantified by reversed-phase HPLC using a Luna C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA) (5 μm, 250 × 4.6 mm) with gradient elution by an HPLC Waters 625LC system (Waters, Milford, MA), employing an increasing gradient of methanol-acetonitrile (25:75, v/v) acidified with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) in 0.1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A). The following gradient elution conditions were used: time = 0 min/0% B; time = 25 min/60% B; time = 27 min/100% B; flow rate = 1.5 ml/min; temperature 40 °C; injection loop = 20 μl. All solvents were of HPLC grade purity. Absorbance spectra were recorded with a Waters 996 diode array detector by scanning from 200 to 450 nm. The peak height was quantified at the maximum absorbance value between 230 and 450 nm. Data collection and integration was done with the Millennium software (Waters). Pearson product-moment correlation analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 2.01. Calculation of the correlation coefficient (r 2) was based on peak concentration values obtained from two harvests (July 1998 and May 1999), containing several ramets for lines sccoaomt-16 and sccoaomt-29 (12 plants in total). The molecular weight and the daughter ion spectra of the accumulating glycosides were determined using a nanoelectrospray ionization source operated in the negative mode on a hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Micromass, Manchester, United Kingdom) using borosilicate capillaries (Protana, Odense, Denmark). The conditions were as follows: solvent = acetonitrile/water/formic acid (1:0.99:0.01 (v/v/v)); concentration loaded = 5 pmol/μl; electrospray ionization probe voltage = −1.4 kV; cone voltage = 40 V; source temperature = 40 °C; collision energy = −30 eV; collision gas = argon; collision pressure = 1 × 10−3 torr. The collision-induced dissociation was performed on the [M − H]− ions. MS data were acquired in the m/zrange from 100 to 600 Da, and MS/MS data were acquired in the range from 50 to 450 Da. Approximately 250 μg of the glycosides were dissolved in 0.7 ml of D2O (Aldrich). The spectra were recorded with a UNITY-500 spectrometer (Varian Analytical Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). The experiments were performed with a 5-mm inverse detection probe equipped with pulsed magnetic field gradient coils. The standard Varian software Vnmr version 5.3b was used throughout. The spectra were run at 27 °C and referenced to the residual water peak at δ 4.76. The1H-90° pulses were 5.5 μs. Presaturation was chosen to suppress the water peak by using a saturation delay of 2.5 s at a power of 1 dB. Data were analyzed with the software package from Advanced Chemistry Development Inc. (Toronto, Canada). Nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) difference spectroscopy was performed essentially as described (28Braun S. Kalinowski H.-O. Berger S. 150 and More Basic NMR Experiments: A Practical Course. 2nd Ed. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, Germany1998Google Scholar). In MS/MS, compound X had a [M − H]−molecular ion at m/z 329.3 and fragment ions atm/z 108.1, 123.2, 152.2, and 167.2; compound D had a [M − H]− ion at m/z341.3 and fragment ions at m/z 135.2 and 179.2; and compound E had a [M − H]− ion atm/z 385.3 and fragment ions at m/z149.2, 164.2, 208.2, and 223.2. All three compounds showed a loss of 162 Da, suggesting an O-glycosidic bond. Molecular masses of 167.2, 179.2, and 223.2 Da gave evidence that the respective aglycones of compounds X, D, and E were isovanillic or vanillic, caffeic, and sinapic acid analogues, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2107865846,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are important regulatory molecules implicated in the signaling cascade triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, although the events through which TNF-α induces ROS generation are not yet well characterized. We therefore investigated selected candidates likely to mediate TNF-α-induced ROS generation. Consistent with the role of Rac in that process, stable expression of RacAsn-17, a dominant negative Rac1 mutant, completely blocked TNF-α-induced ROS generation. To understand better the mediators downstream of Rac, we investigated the involvement of cytosolic phospholipase A2(cPLA2) activation and metabolism of the resultant arachidonic acid (AA) by 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO). TNF-α-induced ROS generation was blocked by inhibition of cPLA2 or 5-LO, but not cyclooxygenase, suggesting that TNF-α-induced ROS generation is dependent on synthesis of AA and its subsequent metabolism to leukotrienes. Consistent with that hypothesis, TNF-α Rac-dependently stimulated endogenous production of leukotriene B4 (LTB4), while exogenous application of LTB4 increased levels of ROS. In contrast, application of leukotrienes C4, D4, and E4 or prostaglandin E2 had little effect. Our findings suggest that LTB4 production by 5-LO is situated downstream of the Rac-cPLA2 cascade, and we conclude that Rac, cPLA2, and LTB4 play pivotal roles in the ROS-generating cascade triggered by TNF-α.

For example, exposure to TNF-α or IL-1β increases intracellular levels of ROS in NIH3T3 fibroblasts (2Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K.

Indeed, these highly reactive molecules are known to regulate many important cellular events in response to TNF-α, including transcriptional factor activation (e.g. NF-κB) (5Sulciner D.J.

Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1639-1651Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Nonetheless, little is known about the intracellular signaling mediators involved in TNF-induced ROS generation. We previously observed that Rac, a small GTP-binding protein, plays a role in mediating TNF-α-induced activation of c-fos SRE and JNK (10Kim B.C. Lee M.N. Kim J.Y. Lee S.S. Cjang J.D. Kim S.S.

Similarly, Rac has been suggested to function as regulator of TNF-α-induced intracellular ROS generation (2Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermonst P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar) and thus appears to mediate TNF-α signaling, at least in part. Still, the precise roles played by Rac and its downstream target molecules in TNF-α signaling to ROS generation remains unknown. Once activated, Rac in turn activates cPLA2, which catalyzes the synthesis of AA (11Peppelenbosch M.P. Qiu R.G. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Tertoolen L.G.J. de Laat S.W. McCormick F. Hall A. Symons M.H.

This makes it likely that cPLA2 is a major downstream mediator of Rac signaling. In addition, we recently observed that metabolism of AA to LTs by 5-LO is involved in Rac signaling to ROS generation and JNK stimulation (13Woo C.H. Kim B.C. Kim K.W. Yoo M.H. Eom Y.W. Choi E.J.

J. 2000; 348: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This led us to hypothesize that TNF-α-induced ROS generation is mediated by a Rac-cPLA2-5LO-linked cascade. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the respective roles played by Rac, cPLA2, AA, 5-LO, and LTs in the TNF-α-induced generation of ROS. DCFDA was obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR); arachidonic acid, MK-886, indomethacin, AA-861, and AACOCF3 were from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA); TNF-α, lysophosphatidic acid, mepacrine, wortmannin (15Wymann M.P.

Kim (National Institutes of Health). Rat-2 fibroblasts were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, CRL 1764). The cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 0.1 mm non-essential amino acids, 10% FBS, and penicillin (50 units/ml), streptomycin (50 μg/ml) at 37 °C under a humidified 95:5% (v/v) mixture of air and CO2. The stable Rat2-RacAsn-17 and Rat2-RacVal-12 clones expressing RacAsn-17, a dominant negative Rac1 mutant, and RacVal-12, a constitutively active form of Rac1, respectively, were described previously (14Woo C.H.

Mol Cells. 1998; 8: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar). Transient transfection was carried out by plating approximately 3 × 105 cells in 60-mm dishes for 24 h and then adding calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates prepared with 6 μg of DNA/dish. To control for variations in cell number and transfection efficiency, all clones were co-transfected with 0.3 μg of pCMV-βGAL, a eukaryotic expression vector containing the E. coli β-galactosidase (lacZ) structural gene under the transcriptional control of the cytomegalovirus promoter. The quantity of DNA used in each transfection was held constant (6 μg) by adding sonicated calf thymus DNA (Sigma). After incubating 6 h with the calcium phosphate/DNA precipitates, the cells were rinsed twice with PBS before incubating them in fresh DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS. Each dish of cells was then rinsed twice with PBS and lysed in 0.1 ml of lysis solution (0.2m Tris (pH 7.6) + 0.1% Triton X-100), after which the lysed cells were scraped and spun for 1 min. Supernatants were assayed for protein concentration and β-galactosidase activities. Luciferase activity was assayed in 10-μl samples of extract using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol; luciferase luminescence was counted in luminometer (Turner Design, TD-20/20) and normalized to co-transfected β-galactosidase activity. Transfection experiments were performed in triplicate with two independently isolated sets of cells, and the results were averaged. Intracellular H2O2 was measured as a function of DCF fluorescence using the procedures of Ohba et al. (18Ohba M. Shibanuma M. Kuroki T. Nose K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 26: 1079-1088Crossref Scopus (436) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown on coverslips for 2 days and then serum-starved in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% (v/v) FBS for an additional 2 days. The cells were then stabilized in serum-free DMEM without phenol red for at least 30 min before exposure to agonists (TNF-α or LTs) for the indicated times. When assessing the effects of inhibitors, cells were pretreated with the respective inhibitor for 30 min. To measure intracellular H2O2, cells were then incubated for 10 min with the H2O2-sensitive fluorophore DCFDA (5 μg/ml), which when taken up fluorescently labels intracellular H2O2 with DCF. The cells were then immediately observed under a laser-scanning confocal microscope (Carl Zeiss LSM 410). DCF fluorescence was excited at 488 nm using an argon laser, and the evoked emission was filtered with a 515-nm long pass filter. DCF fluorescence was measured in 30 randomly selected cells. Values represent means ± S.D. of DCF fluorescence intensity in three independent experiments. Statistical significance of ROS measurements were assessed with unpaired t test (p < 0.01). Cells (3 × 105) were plated on 60-mm dishes and incubated in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS for 24 h. Then the culture media were replaced with DMEM containing 0.5% FBS for additional 24 h, after which they were treated with TNF-α for 30 min. For the measurements of intracellular level of LTB4, the plates were rinsed twice with cold PBS and mixed with four times their volume of absolute ethanol and left at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting precipitate was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Separately, the culture media were also collected for the measurement of secreted LTB4 levels. The ethanolic supernatant and culture media containing the leukotrienes were collected through C2 reverse phase column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, RPN 1903). The methyl formate in the eluted samples was then removed by evaporation under vacuum, and the samples reconstituted in assay buffer were stored under argon at −50 °C until assay for LTB4 using a specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, RPN 224) as instructed by the manufacturer. The enzyme immunoassay was calibrated with standard LTB4 from 0.31 to 40 pg per well. The sensitivity, defined as the amount of LTB4 needed to reduce zero dose binding, was 0.3 pg/well, which is equivalent to 6 pg/ml. Statistical significance of LTB4 assays were assessed with analysis of variance (p < 0.05). To assay JNK activity mediated by TNF-α, subconfluent Rat-2 cells were serum-starved for 24 h in DMEM supplemented with 0.5% FBS and then stimulated with TNF-α for 30 min. Each dish of cells was then washed with cold PBS, lysed by incubation for 5 min in 0.5 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin) with 1 mm PMSF, scraped into Eppendorf tubes and triturated by 10 passes through a 21.1-gauge needle. The supernatant (cell lysate) was harvested by microcentrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min. Protein concentrations were equalized by normalizing them to the protein levels (assayed by Bradford procedure with Bio-Rad Dye Reagent) measured before the JNK assay. JNK activity was determined using a JNK assay kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, an amino-terminal c-Jun (amino acid residues 1–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads was used to pull down JNK from cell lysates. The kinase reaction (50 μl) was then carried out using the c-Jun fusion protein as a substrate in the presence of cold ATP. Phosphorylation of the c-Jun fusion protein at Ser-63 was measured by Western blot using a polyclonal rabbit anti-phospho-c-Jun antibody that detects only catalytically activated c-Jun phosphorylated at Ser-63. Protein samples were heated to 95 °C for 5 min and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on 8% acrylamide gels, followed by transfer to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes for 2 h at 100 V using a NOVEX wet transfer unit. Membranes were then blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline with 0.01% (v/v) Tween 20 and 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk, after which they were incubated for 2 h with the primary antibody (anti-phospho-c-Jun) in Tris-buffered saline, and then for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The blots were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence kits (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Bands on XAR-5 film (Eastman Kodak Co.) corresponding to phospho-c-Jun were measured by densitometry. To assess the role of ROS in the TNF-α-induced intracellular nuclear signaling cascade, we first examined the effect of NAC, a free radical scavenger, on TNF-α-induced stimulation of c-fos SRE, which is a primary nuclear target of various extracellular agonists (16Kim J.H. Kwack H.J. Choi S.E. Kim B.C. Kim Y.S. Kang I.J. Kumar C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 19Kim B.C. Kim J.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 1009-1014Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 20Whitmarsh A.J. Shore P. Sharrocks A.D. Davis R.J. Science. 1995; 269: 403-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). To accomplish this, Rat-2 cells were transiently transfected with reporter plasmid pSRE-Luc (3 μg), which contains c-fos SRE oligonucleotides inserted upstream of the c-fos minimal promoter fused to luciferase coding sequences (16Kim J.H. Kwack H.J. Choi S.E. Kim B.C. Kim Y.S. Kang I.J. Kumar C.C. FEBS Lett. 1997; 406: 93-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). TNF-α-induced SRE activation was monitored by measuring luciferase activities normalized to co-transfected β-galactosidase activity. A 2.9-fold increase in the luciferase activity occurred by TNF-α (10 ng/ml). Pretreatment with NAC dose-dependently inhibited TNF-α-evoked c-fosSRE luciferase activity; for example, 1 mm NAC reduced TNF-α-evoked SRE luciferase activity by ∼50% (Fig.1 A). Transient co-transfection of pSOD and pCatalase, expression vectors encoding SOD and catalase, respectively, with pSRE-Luc markedly decreased TNF-α-induced stimulation of SRE-luciferase activity (Fig. 1 B). Among the quantities tested, co-transfection with 5 μg of pCatalase reduced TNF-α-induced stimulation of SRE-luciferase activity by ∼75%. The above results strongly suggest the participation of ROS in TNF-α signaling to c-fos SRE. Interestingly, DPI, a flavoprotein inhibitor, had a similar inhibitory effect on TNF-α-induced stimulation of SRE, which suggests that a flavoprotein-binding protein similar to the phagocytic NADPH oxidase may play a role in the signaling pathway from TNF-α to SRE (Fig. 1 C). Unlike TNF-α, EGF-induced SRE activation (3.2-fold increase) was little affected. NAC inhibited TNF-α-induced JNK activation in a similar fashion. TNF-α (10 ng/ml) induced an ∼4.8-fold increase in JNK activity over control, an effect that was dramatically inhibited by pretreatment with NAC (Fig. 2). Moreover, DPI also had a significant inhibitory effect on TNF-induced JNK activation, suggesting a flavoprotein-binding protein is also involved in the activation of JNK by TNF-α, and implying a common, essential role for ROS in TNF-α-evoked activation of both JNK and c-fos SRE.Figure 3TNF-α stimulates ROS generation in a Rac-dependent manner. A,Rat-2 cells were serum-starved for 2 days and then stimulated with TNF-α for the indicated times. B, serum-starved Rat-2 and Rat2-RacAsn-17 cells were stimulated with the indicated concentrations of TNF-α. DCF fluorescence, reflecting of the relative levels of ROS (arbitrary units), was imaged with a confocal laser scanning fluorescence microscope and then quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Data are expressed as means ± S.D.

Rat-2 cells were serum-starved and then incubated for 30 min with control buffer or TNF-α (10 ng/ml). Before the addition of agonists, cells were preincubated for 30 min with NAC (1 mm), DPI (5 μm), or control buffer. Protein samples of equal size were then assayed for JNK activity using c-Jun fusion protein (residues 1–89) as a substrate. The results shown are representative of at least three independent transfections.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The crucial role played by ROS in TNF-α signaling was confirmed by directly measuring TNF-α-induced changes in ROS levels as a function H2O2-sensitive DCF fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 3 A, maximum ROS generation (a ∼2.4-fold increase over control) was observed within 15 or 20 min of exposure to TNF-α, after which the levels declined. This effect was previously reported to be Rac-dependent (2Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermonst P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar), and consistent with that report, we observed that ROS generation was not detectable in Rat2-RacAsn-17 cells expressing a dominant negative Rac1 mutant (Fig. 3 B) (17Kim B.C. Yi Y.J. Yi S.J. Shin I.C. Ha K.S. Jhun B.H. Hwang S.B. Kim J.H. Mol Cells. 1998; 8: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar). We recently showed that PI 3-kinase acts upstream of Rac in TNF signaling to JNK or SRE (10Kim B.C. Lee M.N. Kim J.Y. Lee S.S. Cjang J.D. Kim S.S. Lee S.Y. Kim J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24372-24377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). To determine whether this enzyme is involved in ROS generation by TNF-α, we analyzed the effect of wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of PI 3-kinase activity (21Arcaro A. Wymann M.P. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 297-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (1055) Google Scholar, 22Ferby I.M. Waga I. Hoshino M. Kume K. Shimizu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11684-11688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and we found that it dramatically inhibited TNF-α-induced ROS generation (Fig. 4). We also recently reported that cPLA2 plays an essential role in mediating Rac signaling to c-fos SRE, JNK, and ROS, thereby acting as an important downstream mediator of Rac (12Kim B.C. Kim J.H. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 333-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 13Woo C.H. Kim B.C. Kim K.W. Yoo M.H. Eom Y.W. Choi E.J. Na D.S. Kim J.H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 268: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Woo C.H. Lee Z.W. Kim B.C. Ha K.S. Kim J.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, one potential mechanism by which Rac may regulate ROS formation in response to TNF-α is via the cPLA2-AA cascade. We therefore assessed the effects of specific inhibitors of cPLA2 or AA metabolism on TNF-α-mediated ROS generation. Pretreatment with 10 μmAACOCF3, a specific cPLA2 inhibitor, almost completely blocked TNF-α-induced ROS generation (>90% inhibition), and similar inhibitory effects were exerted by MK-886, a specific 5-LO inhibitor. This suggests that cPLA2-catalyzed synthesis of AA and subsequent metabolism of AA by 5-LO are involved in the TNF-α signaling to ROS generation. This effect was selective, as levels of ROS were unaffected by 10 μm indomethacin, a nonspecific cyclooxygenase inhibitor (Fig. 4). Apparently, 5-LO, but not cyclooxygenase, plays a crucial role in mediating TNF-α-induced ROS generation by acting downstream of the Rac-AA cascade. To investigate further the involvement of 5-LO in TNF-α-induced ROS generation, we assessed the effect of LTs, products of AA metabolism by 5-LO, on production of intracellular ROS. Exogenous application of LTB4 (0.3 μm) induced maximal increases in the levels of ROS; individually, LTC4, -D4, or -E4 had minimal effects, although a LTC4/D4/E4 mixture (0.2 μm) induced an ∼3.5-fold increase in the ROS levels; PGE2 (1 μm) had no effect at all (Fig.5 A). The response to LTB4 reached a maximum within 3 min and declined thereafter (Fig. 5 B). In addition, LTB4-evoked ROS generation was not inhibited by RacAsn-17 (Fig.5 C), indicating that LTB4 acts downstream of Rac in the TNF-α signaling pathway leading to the generation of ROS. The above results encouraged us to test whether the level of LTB4 is indeed enhanced by TNF-α in the cells. After incubation in DMEM with 0.5% FBS for 24 h, Rat-2 cells were exposed to TNF-α in control buffer or in the presence of various inhibitors. Consistent with the proposed role of LTB4 as a downstream mediator, TNF-α significantly elevated levels of LTB4, an effect that was selectively inhibited by wortmannin, AACOCF3, or MK-886 (Fig.6 A). We also measured the extracellular, secreted level of LTB4 in response to TNF-α and, as shown in Fig. 6 B, TNF-α significantly induced the secretion of LTB4 (e.g. 2.8-fold increase over control buffer at 1 h). The effect of TNF-α on LTB4 appeared to be critically dependent on Rac activity, as the elevated level of LTB4 in response to TNF-α is clearly diminished in Rat2-RacAsn-17 cells (17Kim B.C. Yi Y.J. Yi S.J. Shin I.C. Ha K.S. Jhun B.H. Hwang S.B. Kim J.H. Mol Cells. 1998; 8: 90-95PubMed Google Scholar) than in control Rat-2 cells (Fig. 6 C). Similarly, the enhanced extracellular LTB4 level by TNF-α was significantly decreased in Rat2-RacAsn-17 cells than in Rat-2 cells (data not shown). Consistent with the role of Rac1 in LTB4production, the basal LTB4 levels were significantly higher in Rat2-RacVal-12 cells (14Woo C.H. Lee Z.W. Kim B.C. Ha K.S. Kim J.H. Biochem. J. 2000; 348: 525-530Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), stably expressing RacVal-12, a constitutively active form of Rac1, than in control Rat-2 cells (Fig. 6 D). Together, our results strongly suggest the mediatory role of Rac1 in the TNF-α signaling pathway to LTB4 production. It has been suggested that LTB4 acts in an autocrine manner via BLTR, its cell surface receptor (23Toda A. Yokomizo T. Masuda K. Nakao A. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 24Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the effect of ZK-158252 (Schering AG), a specific BLTR antagonist, on TNF-α-induced ROS generation. As shown in Fig.7 A, pretreatment with 3 μm ZK-158252 completely abolished ROS generation by TNF-α in a manner similar to DPI or NAC (Fig. 7 A). As expected, ZK-158252 also inhibited both JNK and SRE stimulation induced by TNF-α (Fig. 7, B and C), suggesting the involvement of BLTR in TNF-α-evoked activation of both JNK and c-fos SRE. The results of the present study indicate that nuclear signaling leading to activation of c-fos SRE or JNK is dependent on generation of ROS, as demonstrated by the inhibitory effects of NAC, catalase, and SOD on TNF-α-induced c-fos SRE or JNK stimulation in Rat-2 fibroblasts. In an attempt to understand better the pathway through which ROS generation is stimulated by TNF-α, we examined the role of the Rac-cPLA2-linked cascade in that process. First, the role of Rac1 was assessed by comparing ROS generation in Rat-2 and Rat2-RacAsn-17 cells, which revealed that TNF-α clearly requires Rac activity for ROS generation (Fig. 3 B) and is consistent with earlier findings (2Sundaresan M., Yu, Z.X. Ferrans V.J. Sulciner D.J. Gutkind J.S. Irani K. Goldschmidt-Clermonst P.J. Finkel T. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 379-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Second, the effects of specific inhibitors of cPLA2 and 5-LO (AACOCF3 and MK-886, respectively) showed that activation of cPLA2 and metabolism of the synthesized AA by 5-LO were essential for the generation of ROS by TNF-α (Fig. 4). Third, the role of 5-LO in mediating ROS generation was further confirmed by the significant increase of ROS levels elicited by direct addition of LTB4 to the cells (Fig. 5). Consistent with the proposed action of 5-LO being downstream of Rac, LTB4 generated similar levels of ROS in both Rat-2 and Rat2-RacAsn-17cells (Fig. 5 C). Although a mixture of cysteinyl LTs (LTC4/D4/E4) also yielded significant increases in ROS (Fig. 5 A), addition of any individual cysteinyl LTs did not; thus LTB4 appears to be the major form of LT responsible for the ROS generation by TNF-α. Consistent with that role, we were able to detect significant TNF-α- and Rac-dependent increases in the level of LTB4 in treated cells (Fig. 6). In addition, increasing evidence supports a signaling link between cPLA2-mediated AA metabolism and ROS generation. For example, Li et al.(28Li Y. Ferrante A. Poulos A. Harvey D.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1605-1609Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and Lindsay et al. (29Lindsay M.A. Perkins R.S. Barnes P.J. Giembycz M.A. J. Immunol. 1997; 160: 4526-4534Google Scholar) suggest that LTB4activates ROS generation in neutrophils and eosinophils, respectively. Also, an action of LTB4 through an autocrine stimulatory loop was shown to be crucial for activation of LT synthesis from AA in neutrophils (30Surette M.E. Krump E. Picard S. Borgeat P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1055-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Consistent with that report, we observed a significantly enhanced extracellular secretion of LTB4 in response to TNF-α (Fig. 6 B). We do not yet know the LTB4 target molecule(s) mediating ROS generation. Nonetheless, since ZK-158252, a specific BLTR antagonist, markedly inhibited the effects of TNF-α (Fig. 7), we postulate that BLTR, a G protein-coupled, cell surface LTB4receptor, is likely involved. The action of ZK-158252 was quite specific to the LTB4 receptor, as ROS generation elicited by exogenous LTB4, but not that elicited by an LTC4/D4/E4 mixture, was completely abolished by this compound (data not shown). BLTR is thought to be expressed mainly in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (23Toda A. Yokomizo T. Masuda K. Nakao A. Izumi T. Shimizu T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 262: 806-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar); by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, we detected its expression in various cell lines, including Rat-2 fibroblasts, MG-63 osteoblasts, NIH3T3 fibroblasts, U-937 monocyte-like lymphoma, and monocyte-macrophage RAW 264.7 (data not shown). We thus predict that BLTR occupation is required for TNF-α-induced ROS generation and that LTB4 acts via an autocrine/paracrine mechanism. The precise function of such an autocrine/paracrine action of LTB4 is not clear, but it may serve as a feedback mechanism amplifying the action LTB4 and in turn TNF-α signaling. The downstream signaling mechanism by which LTB4 mediates ROS generation through BLTR is completely unknown. Although LTB4 binds to BLTR, it can also bind to and activate the intranuclear transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α, resulting in the activation of genes that terminate inflammatory processes (24Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Chang K. Takuwa Y. Shimizu T. Nature. 1997; 387: 620-624Crossref PubMed Scopus (856) Google Scholar). In addition, LTB4 is a potent chemoattractant involved in such inflammatory diseases as bronchial asthma (25Turner C.R. Breslow R. Conklyn M.J. Andresen C.J. Patterson D.K. Lopez-Anaya A. Owens B. Lee P. Watson J.W. Showell H.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 381-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), inflammatory bowel diseases (26Shindo K. Koide K. Fukumura M. Thorax. 1997; 52: 1024-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and psoriasis (27Reiss T.F. Sorkness C.A. Stricker W. Botto A. Busse W.W. Kundu S. Zhang J. Thorax. 1997; 52: 45-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Usually, TNF-α-induced production of ROS in non-phagocytes is only 1–2% of that seen in phagocytes, which produce large amounts of O2− as part of the body's defense against disease processes (31Cross A.R. Jones O.T.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1057: 281-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (455) Google Scholar). The generation of ROS in response to TNF-α appears not to be involved in TNF-α cytotoxicity (8O'Donnell V.B. Spycher S. Azzi A. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 133-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and indeed we detected no cytotoxicity under our experimental conditions. 2C.-H. Woo, Y.-W. Eom, M.-H. Yoo, H.-J. You, H. J. Han, W. K. Song, Y. J. Yoo, J.-S. Chun, and J.-H. Kim, unpublished observations. Instead, our findings with JNK and SRE suggest that ROS generation elicited by TNF-α may play a role in regulating intracellular signaling cascades leading to regulation gene expression (Fig. 7). In summary, the data presented are indicative of the crucial role played by cPLA2 and the resultant production of LTB4 in the regulation of TNF-α-mediated generation of ROS. Although we do not know precisely the downstream mediators of LTB4, our findings indicate that BLTR is likely involved. Future studies elucidating the linkage between LTB4 and ROS will likely be pivotal to our complete understanding of TNF-α-evoked intracellular signaling and inflammatory responses.

Here we report the identification and characterization of three Ras family GEFs that are most abundantly expressed in brain. Two of these GEFs, MR-GEF (M-Ras-regulated GEF, KIAA0277) and PDZ-GEF (KIAA0313) bound specifically to nucleotide-free Rap1 and Rap1/Rap2, respectively. Both proteins functioned as Rap1 GEFs in vivo.

This cycle is tightly controlled in vivo by two classes of regulatory proteins. Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)1serve as Ras activators by promoting acquisition of the active GTP-bound state and are the key link between cell surface receptors and Ras activation (3Quilliam L.A.

Meanwhile, GTPase-activating proteins promote rapid GTP hydrolysis, returning Ras back to its inactive GDP-bound state (4Wittinghofer A. Biol. Chem.

The ability of Rap1 to block transformation is likely due to its ability to form non-productive complexes with Ras effectors such as c-Raf-1 (6Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F.

Although it is activated by Ras GEFs and can bind/activate some Ras protein effectors such as AF-6 and the Raf/ERK cascade (14Quilliam L.A. Graham K.R. Castro A.F. Martin C.B. Der C.J. Bi C. J. Biol.

Despite this prediction none have been identified so far.Although over 20 Ras family GTPases have been identified, only a handful of the GEFs that regulate them have been described as follows: Sos, GRF and GRP isoforms for Ras, the RalGDS family for Ral, and C3G, RapGRP/CalDAG GEF, Epac/cAMP-GEFs for Rap1 (3Quilliam L.A.

One unique GEF, Smg GDS (small molecular weightGTP-binding protein guanine nucleotidedissociation stimulator), catalyzes exchange on Rho family GTPases as well as Rap1 and K-Ras in vitro (22Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,23Chuang T.H. Xu X. Quilliam L.A. Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Smg GDS is composed of 11 armadillo repeats similar to those found in APC and catenins (24Peifer M. Berg S. Reynolds A.B. Cell. 1994; 76: 789-791Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar) and does not share significant homology with CDC25 (25Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar).The catalytic domains of all other Ras subfamily GEFs share ∼30% homology with each other and the Saccharomyces cerevisiaeprotein, CDC25. Conservation between “CDC25 homology” domains is greatest within structurally conserved regions (SCR) 1–3 that were first noted by Boguski and McCormick (25Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1752) Google Scholar), whereas additional C-terminal regions (SCR 4 and 5) have subsequently become evident (Fig.1) (26Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13406-13410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A region outside of the core catalytic domain, referred to as Ras exchanger motif (REM), conserved non-catalytic, or SCR 0 has also been noted (27Lai C.C. Boguski M. Broek D. Powers S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1345-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 28Fam N.P. Fan W.T. Wang Z. Zhang L.J. Chen H. Moran M.F. Mol. Cell.

Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar). Based on the Sos1 Ras GEF x-ray crystal structure, REM/SCR 0 is a structural component that binds to SCR4 and is not involved in Ras interaction (29Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Margarit S.M. Bar-Sagi D. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1998; 394: 337-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (608) Google Scholar).Besides the common “CDC25 homology” catalytic domain, GEFs possess a wide variety of domains that are important for the regulation of their function. For instance, Sos contains proline-rich clusters that interact with the SH3 domains of adapter proteins such as Grb2 bringing Sos to the membrane after receptor tyrosine kinase activation (3Quilliam L.A. Khosravi-Far R. Huff S.Y. Der C.J. BioEssays. 1995; 17: 395-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Translocation to the membrane is assumed to be critical in the activation of GEFs since it brings them into contact with membrane-bound GTPases. PH domains are also found in several GEFs, including Sos and GRFs, where this domain is also important for membrane interaction (30Chen R.H. Corbalan-Garcia S. Bar-Sagi D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1351-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The GRP or CalDAG GEFs for Ras and Rap each possess EF hands and C1 domains and are regulated by calcium and/or DAG (19Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A. Chan E.Y. Stang S.L. Dunn R.J. Stone J.C.

Kay R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6995-7008Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the Rap GEFs, Epac/cAMP-GEF 1 and 2, are regulated by cyclic AMP (21de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 32Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) indicating that Ras function can be regulated by receptors others than tyrosine kinases. Finally, binding to Ras activates the RalGDS family of Ral GEFs (1Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Clark G.J. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1395-1413Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar). These proteins contain a Ras-associating or RalGDS/AF6-homology (RA) domain responsible for the interaction with Ras-GTP (33Ponting C.P. Benjamin D.R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 422-425Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 34Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11089-11093Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar).Since the increasing number of Ras family members suggested the existence of additional Ras GEFs to regulate them, we searched the NCBI data bases for novel CDC25 homology domain-containing proteins. Three of the putative GEFs that we identified promote the formation of Rap1-GTP in vivo, and splice variants of a fourth activate Ral (26Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13406-13410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Two of the Rap GEFs contain RA domains. Just as the Ral family GEFs, RalGDS, RGL and RGL2/Rlf, are downstream effectors of Ras, one of the novel GEFs, MR-GEF (M-Ras-regulated Rap GEF), appears to be regulated by interaction with M-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner. Since Rap1 can antagonize the activation of Raf-1 by other GTPases, negative regulation of Rap1 by M-Ras via MR-GEF may help facilitate M-Ras-induced activation of Raf-1.DISCUSSIONCurrently 14 members of the Rho family of GTPase have been identified for which there are more than 35 GEFs (the Dbl/PH proteins) responsible for loading them with GTP (40Zohn I.M. Campbell S.L. Khosravi-Far R. Rossman K.L. Der C.J. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 1415-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar). Although there are an increasing number of Ras family members, until recently only a limited number of CDC25 homology domain-containing GEFs existed to mediate Ras protein activation. A sequence homology search of the DNA data bases has now revealed several additional members. We report here that putative exchange factors MR-GEF and PDZ-GEF activate Rap1, and a third, GRP3, activates Rap and Ras. An additional Ral GEF family “RalGPS” has been described elsewhere (26Rebhun J.F. Chen H. Quilliam L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13406-13410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that MR-GEF and PDZ-GEF contain RA domains. Importantly, the RA domain present in MR-GEF is regulated by interaction with M-Ras in a GTP-dependent manner and is conserved in other Rap GEFs. In agreement with the results presented here, several other recent reports have described these new GEFs (41de Rooij J. Boenink N.M. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol.

However, this study is the first to report the interaction of activated M-Ras with MR-GEF and to demonstrate M-Ras regulation of the Rap1 exchange activity of MR-GEF.The identification of the above proteins brings the total number of known Rap1 GEFs to nine (SmgGDS, C3G, GRP2 and -3, Epac 1 and 2, MR-GEF, PDZ-GEFs 1 and 2). Within the group of Rap GEFs, Smg GDS presents unusual characteristics. It does not possess the CDC25 homology domain found in other Ras GEFs and has previously been reported to activate Rap1, Rac, Rho, and K-Ras in vitro (22Mizuno T. Kaibuchi K. Yamamoto T. Kawamura M. Sakoda T. Fujioka H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6442-6446Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar,23Chuang T.H. Xu X. Quilliam L.A. Bokoch G.M. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 761-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Here we showed that Smg GDS acts as a Rap GEF in vivoand further demonstrate its ability to activate Ral. This is consistent with the observed interaction of Xenopus Ral with a frog Smg GDS-related protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen (48Iouzalen N. Camonis J. Moreau J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 250: 359-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and the presence of a polybasic C terminus in Ral similar to that found in other Smg GDS substrates. Why a single GEF is responsible for activating so many GTPases and how it is regulated will require further investigation. However, our in vivo studies confirm previous in vitro and functional assays that suggested that Smg GDS would act as a Rap1 GEF.It is interesting to note how divergent the mechanisms of Rap GEF regulation are. C3G is activated downstream of tyrosine kinases, being recruited by adapter proteins such as Crk and p130Cas (49Matsuda M. Kurata T. Cell. Signal. 1996; 8: 335-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). SHEP1/NSP3, a putative GEF that can bind Rap1 in vitro, is also downstream of protein tyrosine kinases (50Dodelet V.C. Pazzagli C. Zisch A.H. Hauser C.A. Pasquale E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31941-31946Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar, 51Lu Y. Brush J. Stewart T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10047-10052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Epac/cAMP-GEFs 1 and 2 are activated by the second messenger cAMP, whereas GRP2 (and potentially GRP3) is activated by phorbol esters/diacylglycerol and/or calcium (19Ebinu J.O. Bottorff D.A.

Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The discovery of PDZ-GEF and MR-GEF identifies novel domains/mechanisms to direct Rap GEF activation. PDZ-GEF has a number of putative domains that may regulate its activity. The PDZ domain regulates the attachment of PDZ-GEFs to the plasma membrane of HEK cells (47Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), whereas a putative C-terminal (SAV) PDZ-binding motif may be involved in the interaction of PDZ-GEF with a six PDZ domain-containing synaptic scaffolding protein, S-SCAM, described by Takai and colleagues (44Ohtsuka T. Hata Y. Ide N. Yasuda T. Inoue E. Inoue T. Mizoguchi A. Takai Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 265: 38-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar).PDZ-GEF also possesses a cAMP-binding domain, sharing weak homology with those of Epac and the protein kinase A regulatory subunits (21de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar,32Kawasaki H. Springett G.M. Mochizuki N. Toki S. Nakaya M. Matsuda M. Housman D.E. Graybiel A.M. Science. 1998; 282: 2275-2279Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar). The binding of cAMP to PDZ-GEF is not required for its activation of Rap, although the presence of the cAMP-binding domain does have a slight inhibitory role (41de Rooij J. Boenink N.M. van Triest M. Cool R.H. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38125-38130Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), analogous to the domain in Epac, which cannot activate Rap1A unless cAMP is present (21de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). During the completion of this manuscript it was reported that the presence of cAMP or cGMP allowed PDZ-GEF to activate Ha-Ras in vivo without affecting Rap1 activation (47Pham N. Cheglakov I. Koch C.A. de Hoog C.L. Moran M.F. Rotin D. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 555-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). We saw no binding of PDZ-GEF to Ha-Rasin vitro and no activation of Ha-Ras by PDZ-GEF in the absence of cAMP in vivo, suggesting that Ha-Ras activation by PDZ-GEF is highly dependent on cyclic nucleotides and that they must act by permitting/promoting Ha-Ras-GEF association. PDZ-GEF is not the only example of a Rap1 GEF that also works on Ras. We found that GRP3 also activates both Rap1 and Ha-Ras and is consistent with reports indicating that Ras and Rap1 are concomitantly activated by mitogens (10Zwartkruis F.J. Wolthuis R.M. Nabben N.M. Franke B. Bos J.L. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5905-5912Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 52Posern G. Weber C.K. Rapp U.R. Feller S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24297-24300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Like GRP1 and GRP2, GRP3 contains EF hands and a C1 domain suggesting that it is regulated by calcium and/or diacylglycerol. Although we have seen strong activation of Ha-Ras and Rap1 by GRP3 under serum-starved conditions, it will be interesting to study whether activation by calcium and/or diacylglycerol regulates the specificity of GRP3 for Ha-Ras and Rap1 as cAMP appears to do with PDZ-GEF.The presence of RA domains in PDZ-GEF and MR-GEF suggests a novel mechanism of regulating the activity and/or specificity of Rap GEFs. The binding of Rap1 or -2 to the RA domain of PDZ-GEF may modulate its activity as part of a regulatory feedback mechanism. To date, regulation of PDZ-GEF activity by Rap1-GTP has not been reported. The C terminus of the MR-GEF RA domain is poorly conserved with the “classical” RA domains of RalGDS and AF-6 (Fig. 1 C). However, the ability of M-Ras to bind the N-terminal regulatory domain of MR-GEF in a GTP-dependent manner together with its ability to inhibit the activation of Rap1 by MR-GEF strongly suggest that association with the RA domain inhibits MR-GEF activity. Additionally, it was interesting to find the putative RA domain of MR-GEF is conserved in two other GEFs. In fact, the Rap1 GEF Epac2 and the putative exchange factor Link GEFII contain considerable homology to MR-GEF beyond their RA and CDC25 homology domains (Fig.1 C). This suggests that there is a family of Rap GEFs sensitive to M-Ras or other Ras protein regulations. As mentioned above, association of M-Ras with MR-GEF appears to inhibit Rap activation. Such negative regulation seems logical given the previous studies on these two GTPases. M-Ras, like the classical Ras proteins, induces cellular transformation of 3T3 fibroblasts (14Quilliam L.A.

Osada M. Chan A.M. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2675-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), whereas Rap1 was initially discovered as a suppressor of K-Ras-induced transformation, thus antagonizing Ras functions. It has similarly been shown to antagonize T cell activation (53Boussiotis V.A. Freeman G.J. Berezovskaya A. Barber D.L. Nadler L.M. Science. 1997; 278: 124-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Under this scenario, it is reasonable to speculate that activation of M-Ras could be responsible for the negative regulation of the Rap1 pathway through its association with the RA domain of Rap GEFs. The lack of activated Rap1 would lead to the disassociation of the inactive Rap-Raf-1 complex leaving Raf-1 free for activation by M-Ras or other Ras proteins. As M-Ras is widely expressed and in some tissues is present at higher levels than classical Ras proteins (16Ehrhardt G.R. Leslie K.B. Lee F. Wieler J.S. Schrader J.W. Blood. 1999; 94: 2433-2444Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), such a mechanism may apply to several systems where Rap-Ras pathways result in different physiological outcomes. Currently, this hypothesis is under investigation.Regulation of downstream GTPases by Ras was originally described for a family of Ral exchange factors (RalGDS) that contain C-terminal RA domains (34Hofer F. Fields S. Schneider C. Martin G.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 11089-11093Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). This interaction serves to recruit Ral GEFs to the membrane where they contact and activate the Ral GTPase. It is interesting to note that MR-GEF and PDZ-GEF have RA domains immediately N-terminal to their catalytic domains. Such insertions of regulatory domains within their catalytic domains may be a means of modulating the activity as well as the location of the catalytic domain. Although the inhibitory role of M-Ras in Rap1 activation by MR-GEF supports this idea, further studies will be required to clarify their role. It will also be interesting to determine whether the Rap1/2 interaction with the RA domain of PDZ-GEF results in a similar effect. MR-GEF and PDZ-GEF join a growing list of proteins containing putative Ras associating doma"
https://openalex.org/W2045464700,"The C-terminal G domains of laminin α chains have been implicated in various cellular and other interactions. The G domain of the α4 chain was now produced in transfected mammalian cells as two tandem arrays of LG modules, α4LG1–3 and α4LG4–5. The recombinant fragments were shown to fold into globular structures and could be distinguished by specific antibodies. Both fragments were able to bind to heparin, sulfatides, and the microfibrillar fibulin-1 and fibulin-2. They were, however, poor substrates for cell adhesion and had only a low affinity for the α-dystroglycan receptor when compared with the G domains of the laminin α1 and α2 chains. Yet antibodies to α4LG1–3 but not to α4LG4–5 clearly inhibited α6β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to laminin-8, indicating the participation of α4LG1–3 in a cell-adhesive structure of higher complexity. Proteolytic processing within a link region between the α4LG3 and α4LG4 modules was shown to occur during recombinant production and in endothelial and Schwann cell culture. Cleavage could be attributed to three different peptide bonds and is accompanied by the release of the α4LG4–5 segment. Immunohistology demonstrated abundant staining of α4LG1–3 in vessel walls, adipose, and perineural tissue. No significant staining was found for α4LG4–5, indicating their loss from tissues. Immunogold staining demonstrated an association of the α4 chain primarily with microfibrillar regions rather than with basement membranes, while laminin α2 chains appear primarily associated with various basement membranes.

Yet antibodies to α4LG1–3 but not to α4LG4–5 clearly inhibited α6β1 integrin-mediated cell adhesion to laminin-8, indicating the participation of α4LG1–3 in a cell-adhesive structure of higher complexity. Proteolytic processing within a link region between the α4LG3 and α4LG4 modules was shown to occur during recombinant production and in endothelial and Schwann cell culture. Cleavage could be attributed to three different peptide bonds and is accompanied by the release of the α4LG4–5 segment. Immunohistology demonstrated abundant staining of α4LG1–3 in vessel walls, adipose, and perineural tissue. No significant staining was found for α4LG4–5, indicating their loss from tissues. Immunogold staining demonstrated an association of the α4 chain primarily with microfibrillar regions rather than with basement membranes, while laminin α2 chains appear primarily associated with various basement membranes. The protein family of laminins consists of at least 12 different isoforms, which are mainly localized in basement membranes. They are involved in major biological functions such as interactions with cellular receptors and the formation of networks that are intermingled with and bound to networks of collagen type IV (1, 2Sasaki T. Timpl R. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix: Anchor and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 434-443Google Scholar). Most of these heterotrimeric isoforms consist of β1/β2 and γ1 chains but differ in their α chains, α1 to α5. The α4 chain (200 kDa) is the shortest variant known so far and is present in laminin-8 (α4β1γ1) and laminin-9 (α4β2γ1) (3Niimi T. Kumagai C. Okano M. Kitagawa Y.

The existence of such relatively small laminins was originally indicated from biosynthetic studies with endothelial and adipose cells (6Aratani Y. Kitagawa Y. J. Biol.

The domain structure of the α4 chain (1816 residues) predicted a small N-terminal region contributing a truncated short arm structure, a coiled-coil domain II/I used for chain association, and a large C-terminal G domain. This prediction was confirmed by electron microscopy of laminin-8 and -9, which lacked one of the three short arm structures found in other laminins (3Niimi T. Kumagai C. Okano M. Kitagawa Y. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 4Frieser M. Nöckel H. Pausch F. Röder C. Hahn A. Deutzmann R. Sorokin L. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 246: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Northern and in situ hybridization demonstrated a moderate to strong expression of the α4 chain in heart, lung, skeletal muscle, and skin, while some other tissues were negative (4Frieser M.

Biochem. 1997; 246: 727-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Antibodies raised against fusion proteins of the α4 chain were useful in showing the extracellular deposition of the corresponding laminins by immunohistology (5Miner J.H. Patton B.L. Lentz S.I.

This demonstrated a distinct localization in striated muscle, perineurium, capillaries, and some mesenchymal regions but only a low abundance in epithelial basement membrane zones. This suggested that α4 chains are a distinct component of subendothelial regions and that they may have an adhesive function for endothelial cells (11Iivanainen A. Kortesmaa J. Sahlberg C. Morita T. Bergmann U. Thesleff I. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27862-27868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). It was also speculated that they may promote angiogenesis (3Niimi T. Kumagai C. Okano M. Kitagawa Y. Matrix Biol. 1997; 16: 223-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 7Tokida Y. Aratani Y. Morita A. Kitagawa Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18123-18129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Specific binding functions have not yet been examined for the α4 chain G domain, although such functions are shared by the G domains of all other laminin α chains (2Sasaki T. Timpl R. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix: Anchor and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 434-443Google Scholar). These G domains consist of a tandem array of five LG modules, LG1 to LG5, each of about 200 amino acid residues. Previous data for α1 and α2 chains showed the involvement of their G domains in integrin-mediated cell adhesion and binding to heparin, sulfatides, and the α-dystroglycan receptor (2Sasaki T. Timpl R. Kreis T. Vale R. Guidebook to the Extracellular Matrix: Anchor and Adhesion Proteins. 2nd Ed. Oxford University Press, Oxford1999: 434-443Google Scholar, 12Aumailley M. Gimond C.

Some of the binding epitopes could be mapped by site-directed mutagenesis to the laminin α1LG4 and α2LG5 modules and showed a considerable overlap (13Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Talts J.F. Andac Z. Göhring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). The recent elucidation of the crystal structure of α2LG5 (16Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) was instrumental in understanding the spatial organization of these epitopes. Furthermore, a recombinant fragment corresponding to laminin α2LG1–5 was shown to promote the attachment of Mycobacteria leprae to Schwann cells (17Rambukkana A. Salzer J.L. Yurchenco P.D. Tuomanen E.I. Cell. 1997; 88: 811-821Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 18Rambukkana A. Yamada H. Zanazzi G. Mathus T. Salzer J.L. Yurchenco P.D. Campbell K.P. Fischetti V.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2076-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), indicating that LG modules are also likely to be involved in pathological processes. Based on our previous experience with the recombinant production of LG modules of laminin α1 and α2 chains in mammalian cells (13Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 19Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar), we have now prepared the tandem arrays α4LG1–3 and α4LG4–5 for the mouse laminin α4 chain. These fragments had a strong affinity for heparin but no activity or only little activity in cell adhesion and the binding of α-dystroglycan. Furthermore, the data indicated a substantial absence of the α4LG4–5 structure from tissues due to proteolytic processing. Recombinant mouse fibulin-1 (20Sasaki T. Kostka G. Göhring W. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 245: 241-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), fibulin-2 (21Sasaki T. Göhring W. Pan T.-C. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. J. Mol.

Sources of all other extracellular proteins used as ligands have been previously documented (14Talts J.F. Andac Z. Göhring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R.

Methods Enzymol. 1987; 145: 363-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was obtained from human placenta, and human plasma fibronectin was of commercial origin (Behringwerke). α-Dystroglycan purified from chicken skeletal muscle (24Brancaccio A.

Chem. 1998; 273: 600-605Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) was kindly donated by Andrea Brancaccio. Heparin coupled to bovine serum albumin and bovine brain sulfatides were from a commercial source (Sigma). The mouse endothelioma cell line eEnd.2 was that used previously (26Aumailley M. Timpl R. Risau W. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A stem cell-like endothelial cell line from mouse embryos (27Hatzopoulos A.K. Folkman J. Vasile E. Eiselen G.K. Rosenberg R.D. Development. 1998; 125: 1457-1468PubMed Google Scholar) was a kind gift of Antonis Hatzopoulos. Several more human endothelial cells (EC) and smooth muscle cells (SMC) obtained from umbilical vein (HUVEC), aorta (HAEC), dermal microvessels (HMVEC-d), bladder microvessels (HMVEC-Bd), cervical microvessels (CRMV-En), lung microvessels (HMVEC lung) pulmonary artery (PASMC), and aorta (AOSMC) were purchased (Clonetics). RN22 rat Schwannoma, HBL100 human mammary epithelia, and Rugli rat glioblastoma cells were those used previously (28Aumailley M. Gerl M. Sonnenberg A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1990; 262: 82-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Mouse laminin α4 chain cDNA clone M16 (10Liu J. Mayne R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) was used as a template to amplify the sequence encoding the α4LG4–5 modules (residues 1428–1816) by polymerase chain reaction with Vent polymerase (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used were GTCAGCTAGCGGATGCGCCTTCATGGG for the 5′-end and GTCACTCGAGTCAGGCTGTGGGACAGGA for the 3′-end. In addition to the coding sequences, these primers introduced a stop codon and singleNheI and XhoI restriction sites in order to allow in-frame insertion of the cDNA distal to the BM-40 signal peptide sequence in the episomal expression vector pCEP/pu (29Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Clones M47 and M16 (10Liu J. Mayne R. Matrix Biol. 1996; 15: 433-437Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) were used for the preparation of the laminin α4LG1–3 construct (residues 827–1427) in two steps. The primer pairs GTCAGCTAGCAGTCTCCATGATGTTTG and ACGTGCCGTCTGTCCAC (for M47) and GTGGACAGACGGCACGT and GTCACTCGAGCTACTTACTCTTCTCTCCC (for M16) were used for amplification, and the two polymerase chain reaction products were then fused by overlap extension. The final polymerase chain reaction-derived construct contained the same restriction sites and a stop codon as the construct described above. Both were initially ligated into plasmid pUC18 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for sequence verification on a 373A automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). They were then released by NheI and XhoI digestion and ligated into plasmid pCEP/Pu (29Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Human embryonic kidney cells that constitutively express the EBNA-1 protein from Epstein-Barr virus (293 EBNA; Invitrogen) were transfected with the episomal expression vectors (29Kohfeldt E. Maurer P. Vannahme C. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 414: 557-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and transfected cells were selected with 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma) and 250 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). They were washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2) to remove residual serum proteins and grown in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Life Technologies) for 2 days, after which medium was harvested and new serum-free medium was added for another 2 days. Conditioned serum-free medium (1l) was dialyzed against 0.05 mTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Serva) and 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide (Merck). It was then passed over a 2 × 30-cm heparin-Sepharose column, which was equilibrated in the same buffer and eluted with a linear NaCl gradient (0–0.6 m NaCl, 500 ml). Recombinant proteins were further purified on a Superose 12 column (HR16/50; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 0.2 m ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, lyophilized, and redissolved in 0.2 mNH4HCO3. Conditioned serum-free medium (0.5–1l) was harvested from eEnd.2 and rat Schwannoma RN22 cells. After the addition of protease inhibitors (0.05 mm Pefabloc, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide), medium was dialyzed against 0.1 m NaCl, 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and passed over a 5-ml heparin HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in the same buffer. Bound proteins were eluted with a 0.1–0.6 m NaCl gradient (60 ml). Concentrated pools were subsequently passed over a Superose 12 column (HR 10/30) in 0.2m ammonium acetate, pH 6.8, and analyzed by immunoblotting and by SDS-gel electrophoresis using Coomassie Blue staining. Protein and hexosamine concentrations were determined on a Biotronik LC3000 analyzer after hydrolysis (16 h, 110 °C) with 6 or 3 m HCl, respectively. Edman degradation was performed with 473A or Procise sequencers, following the manufacturer's instructions. Electrophoresis in SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gels followed standard protocols. Circular dichroism spectra were recorded using a J-175 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Labor) and evaluated as described previously (30Schulze B. Mann K. Battistutta R. Wiedemann H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 551-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Rotary shadowing electron microscopy was carried out according to established procedures (31Engel J. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 245: 469-488Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). A 1-ml heparin-HiTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 0.05 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, was used to determine the NaCl concentration required to displace bound ligands from the column with a precision of ±0.01 m NaCl (13Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 253-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 14Talts J.F. Andac Z. Göhring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Solid-phase binding assays were carried out with various proteins (5 μg/ml) and heparin-albumin conjugate (10 μg/ml) adsorbed onto the plastic surface of microtiter wells at 4 °C following a previous procedure (32Aumailley M. Wiedemann H. Mann K. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 241-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar) with some modifications (14Talts J.F. Andac Z. Göhring W. Brancaccio A. Timpl R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 863-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Coating with sulfatides dissolved in methanol (0.2 mg/ml; 50 μl) was performed by drying overnight at room temperature. 1 mmCaCl2 and MgCl2 were added to the buffer in the assays with α-dystroglycan. Binding of soluble α4LG1–3 and α4LG4–5 was detected by specific antisera (see below). Surface plasmon resonance assays were performed with BIAcore 1000 instrumentation (BIAcore AB) using proteins coupled through carbodiimide to CM-5 sensor chips (research grade). Binding assays were carried out in neutral buffer containing 2 mmCaCl2 under controlled conditions to prevent mass transport problems (33Göhring W. Sasaki T. Heldin C.-H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 255: 60-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were calculated by nonlinear fitting of association and dissociation curves according to a 1:1 model following the manufacturer's instructions (BIAevaluation software version 3.0). Cell attachment to plastic-coated laminin fragments was detected by rigorous washing followed by staining with 0.1% crystal violet and colorimetry according to established protocols (34Aumailley M. Mann K. von der Mark H. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Collagen IV, fibronectin, and laminin-1 were used as positive controls (26Aumailley M. Timpl R. Risau W. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 196: 177-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Adhesion to bovine serum albumin, which was used for the blocking of coated wells, was negligible. Adhesion-blocking monoclonal antibodies against α6 (GoH3) and β1 (AIIB2) integrin subunits were kindly provided by A. Sonnenberg and C. H. Damsky. They were used together with substrate-specific antibodies in inhibition assays (34Aumailley M. Mann K. von der Mark H. Timpl R. Exp. Cell Res. 1989; 181: 463-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Rabbit antisera were generated against the two α4 chain fragments by two injections of 0.2 mg in complete Freund's adjuvant, and antibodies were affinity-purified (35Timpl R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 472-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Rabbit antibodies against mouse laminin fragments α2LG1–3 and α2LG4–5 have been previously described (19Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titrations followed standard protocols. Immunoblotting followed a previously used procedure (36Sasaki T. Wiedemann H. Matzner M. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Paraffin sections of adult NMRI mice were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and incubated (10 min) with protease XXIV (Sigma) to block endogenous peroxidase. They were then exposed for 1 h at room temperature to affinity-purified rabbit antibodies against α2 chain (19Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar) and α4 chain fragments diluted to 5–7 μg/ml. Peroxidase anti-peroxidase staining and counterstaining with hematoxylin followed a previously described procedure (37Miosge N. Quondamatteo F. Klenczar C. Herken R. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Negative controls were carried out with normal rabbit serum diluted 1:100. Frozen tissue sections were used for indirect immunofluorescence (36Sasaki T. Wiedemann H. Matzner M. Chu M.-L. Timpl R. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 2895-2904Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue sections on nickel grids were used for indirect immunogold staining (38Miosge N. Klenczar C. Herken R. Willem M. Mayer U. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1591-1599PubMed Google Scholar). They were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with affinity-purified antibodies (10–15 μg/ml), rinsed, and incubated for 20 min with affinity-purified goat anti-rabbit IgG (Medac, Hamburg) coupled to 16-nm gold particles diluted 1:300. Sections were rinsed with water, stained with uranyl acetate (15 min) and lead citrate (5 min), and then examined with a Zeiss EM 109 electron microscope. Controls with antibody-coated or -uncoated gold particles were all negative. The G domain of the mouse laminin α4 chain was prepared in the form of two recombinant fragments, α4LG1–3 (residues 827–1427) and α4LG4–5 (residues 1428–1816) following a previous strategy used for the laminin α2 chain (19Talts J.F. Mann K. Yamada Y. Timpl R. FEBS Lett. 1998; 426: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The boundaries chosen were outside the predicted β sandwich structure of the LG modules (16Hohenester E. Tisi D. Talts J.F. Timpl R. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 783-792Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and the border between the two fragments was placed in the center of a long link region (residues 1398–1460). Both fragments were produced and were obtained in good yields (1–2 μg/ml) after purification. Because of their strong heparin affinity, they could be readily purified by a two-step chromatographic procedure, as shown by electrophoresis (Fig. 1). Fragment α4LG1–3 migrated as a band of 67 kDa and showed a single N-terminal sequence APLAVSM, where APLA is derived from the foreign signal peptide region. Fragment α4LG4–5 could be separated by electrophoresis into two bands of 43–44 kDa. Edman degradation of the upper band demonstrated the expected APLADAPXWD sequence. Two sequences, XKFLEQKA and XEQKAP, which were identified for the lower band, represent starting positions of 1437 and 1440, respectively, indicating proteolytic trimming within the linker region. Hexosamine analysis of α4LG1–3 demonstrated 7 residues of glucosamine but no galactosamine, in agreement with the presence of four potential N-glycosylation sites in the sequence (10Liu J. Mayne R.

Both fragments were folded into compact globular structures, as shown by electron microscopy (Fig. 2). They thus had the same shape as previously shown for analogous tandem arrays of LG modules derived from laminin α1 and α2 chains (13Andac Z. Sasaki T. Mann K. Brancaccio A. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. J.

Circular dichroism spectra of α4LG1–3 and α4LG4–5 (data not shown) were nearly identical to that previously published for the proteolytic fragment E3 of laminin-1, which corresponds to α1LG4–5 (39Ott U. Odermatt E. Engel J. Furthmayr H. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1982; 123: 63-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). They showed a minimum at 210–215 nm (θ = −5500 to 8000 degrees·cm2·dmol−1), indicating a content of 47–60% β strands and β turns. Together, the data demonstrated that both recombinant fragments of the laminin α4 chain were properly folded. Binding of laminin fragment E3 to heparin (39Ott U. Odermatt E. Engel J. Furthmayr H.

They bound quantitatively to an analytical heparin affinity column and needed 0.27 and 0.34 m NaCl, respectively, for displacement. This indicated that they are potential ligands for heparin/heparan sulfate at physiological ionic strength, as found before for recombinant LG fragments of the laminin α1 and α2 chains (13Andac Z.

Their binding activities for a heparin-albumin conjugate and for sulfatides in solid phase assays were, however, distinctly lower than α2 chain fragments (Table I). As shown previously (13Andac Z.

An activated apical caspase processes downstream procaspases (effector caspases), which then cleave key cellular substrates to dismantle cells.

Mammals have also evolved an extrinsic or instructive apoptosis pathway, mediated by small death adapters such as FADD, that allows a cell to instruct another to undergo self-destruction (15Nagata S.

This pathway is engaged by a unique group of death receptors in the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily (e.g. TNFR1 and Fas) and plays important roles in the regulation of immune responses and the maintenance of homeostasis. Upon binding to their trimeric ligands, these receptors recruit the adapter protein FADD via death domain (DD)-DD interaction (6Chinnaiyan A.M. O'Rourke K. Tewari M. Dixit V.M.

An Apaf-1/CED-4 homologue, Drosophila Apaf-1-related killer (DARK)/homolog of Apaf-1 and CED-4 (HAC)-1/Dapaf-1, was recently identified in the model genetic organism Drosophila(22Zhou L. Song Z. Tittel J. Steller H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 23Rodriguez A. Oliver H. Zou H. Chen P. Wang X. Abrams J.M. Nat.

Here we describe the identification and characterization of a Drosophila FADD homologue, dFADD, and present evidence that dFADD is an adapter that activates theDrosophila apical caspase DREDD. Human embryonic kidney 293 cells, human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells, and murine fibroblast 3T3 cells were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and human breast carcinoma MCF7 cells were maintain in RPMI 1640. Expression constructs were based on pRK5 (a gift from Dr. D. Goeddel), pcDNA3 (Invitrogen), pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH; for Aequorea victoria green fluorescence protein (GFP) fusion constructs), and pCaSpeR-hs (a gift of Dr. M. Fortini; for SL2 cell expression constructs). FLAG and HA-tags were placed at the N termini of the fusion proteins. Anti-FLAG and anti-HA polyclonal antibodies (Santa Cruz) and anti-FLAG mAb M2 conjugated on agarose beads (Sigma) were purchased from the indicated sources. A Drosophila expressed sequence tag clone (GenBankTM accession numberAI294992) was found to contain an open reading frame with significant sequence homology to mammalian death domain-containing proteins. The sequence of the open reading frame was confirmed on both strands with an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems). A Northern blot membrane containing mRNA from different developmental stages of Drosophilaembryos was hybridized with a 32P-labeled cDNA probe corresponding to the DNA sequence of the prodomain (residue 1–141) of dFADD or a probe specific for ribosomal RNA RP49 as a loading control. Transient transfection of 293 cells was performed as described previously (25Hu S. Vincenz C. Ni J. Gentz R. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17255-17257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Unless indicated otherwise, cells were transfected with 1–10 μg of indicated plasmids to yield equivalent protein expression levels. 20–24 h after transfection, cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG mAb M2 beads. The precipitates were resolved by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting with polyclonal anti-FLAG and anti-HA antibodies. HeLa, 3T3, and MCF7 cells were transiently transfected with each of the test plasmids plus the reporter plasmid pCMV-lacZ (1 and 0.2 μg, respectively, unless indicated otherwise). 22–24 h after transfection, cells were fixed in 0.5% glutaraldehyde and stained with X-Gal. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined by the number of membrane-blebbing cells divided by the total number of blue cells. Data presented were obtained from representative experiments performed in duplicates, and the mean and standard deviation were calculated. Drosophila Schneider L2 cells were transfected with dFADD and DREDD expression plasmids together with a GFP expression plasmid. 20 h after transfection, cells were heat shocked for 20 min three times at 37 °C. 24 h after the heat shock, cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope to determine the number and morphology of GFP-positive cells. HeLa cells were transfected with the GFP fusion plasmids. 20–24 h later, the cells were examined under a fluorescence microscope to determine the distribution and the relative intensity of fluorescence. In a search for Drosophila death domain-containing proteins in the expressed sequence tag data base, we identified a full-length cDNA predicted to encode a protein with a death domain at its C terminus (Fig. 1). This protein has an overall structure similar to that of FADD, and its death domain is highly homologous to the FADD death domain (28% identity and 49% similarity) (Fig. 1 B). We hence designated this first Drosophila death domain-containing protein dFADD.Figure 1Sequence and expression of dFADD. A, deduced amino acid sequence of dFADD.

D, expression of dFADD during Drosophila development. A Drosophilaembryonic mRNA blot was hybridized with radioisotope-labeled dFADD or control RP49 probe as described under “Materials and Methods.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) No homology was found between the N-terminal region of dFADD and any other proteins in the data base using the BLAST and SMART programs. However, a careful comparison of the dFADD sequence with the sequence of DREDD, a Drosophila apical caspase, revealed significant homology between the dFADD N-terminal region and a region in the DREDD prodomain (19% identity and 39% similarity) (Fig. 1 C). Although DREDD was thought to contain two DED domains (26Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar), we found no homology between DREDD prodomain and any DED-containing proteins using BLAST or SMART. The conserved domain in dFADD and DREDD is distinct from DED and CARD (two domains involved in death adapter-procaspase interaction), but its function is similar to those of DED and CARD (see below). We therefore named this novel domain DID (death-inducing domain). Analysis of the dFADD genomic sequence revealed that it contains a single exon on chromosome 3. To examine the mRNA expression of dFADD, we hybridized mRNAs sampled from different stages of Drosophila embryonic development with a dFADD cDNA probe. Only the 3- to 12-h embryos contained a single 1.7-kilobase dFADD transcript (Fig. 1 D). Thus, the expression of dFADD is tightly regulated during Drosophiladevelopment. Because death adapter proteins associate with caspases through homotypic DED-DED or CARD-CARD interaction, we investigated whether dFADD interacted with DREDD through their homologous DIDs. Co-immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that dFADD specifically associated with DREDD but not with DRONC, a CARD domain-containing Drosophila apical caspase (27Dorstyn L. Colussi P.A. Quinn L.M. Richardson H. Kumar S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 4307-4312Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2 B). The specificity of the dFADD-DREDD interaction was further underlined by the observation that dFADD did not interact with various mammalian caspases except for its weak interaction with caspase-10 (Fig.2 C). The interaction domains in dFADD and DREDD were mapped using a panel of deletion mutants (Fig. 2 A). The N-terminal region of dFADD containing the DID domain was both necessary and sufficient for the interaction with DREDD (Fig. 2 D). dFADD interacted strongly with the DREDD prodomain but weakly with the caspase domain (Fig. 2 E). Further mutagenesis analysis of the DREDD prodomain region revealed that the DID domain was required for the interaction with dFADD (Fig. 2 F). Therefore, the DID domains mediate the interaction between DREDD and dFADD. To examine the effect of dFADD on DREDD-induced apoptosis, we transfectedDrosophila SL2 cells with dFADD and DREDD expression plasmids either alone or together. No apoptosis was observed (data not shown), consistent with previous results that ectopic expression of DREDD alone in SL2 cells did not lead to activation of the caspase (26Chen P. Rodriguez A. Erskine R. Thach T. Abrams J.M. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 202-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). However, expression of DREDD in several mammalian cell lines caused significant apoptosis (Fig. 3,A, B, and C). We examined the effect of dFADD on DREDD-mediated apoptosis in these cells and found that although dFADD did not induce apoptosis, it potently enhanced DREDD-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.3, A, B, and C). The dFADD DID was both necessary and sufficient for this enhancement. dFADD did not enhance DRONC-induced apoptosis, consistent with the lack of interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 3 D). Initiator caspases are activated by adapter-mediated oligomerization and subsequent auto-processing. Because dFADD associated with DREDD and enhanced DREDD-induced apoptosis, we investigated whether dFADD promoted DREDD processing. Overexpression of DREDD in human 293 cells led to zymogen processing (Fig. 4 A). DREDD associated with itself at high expression levels either directly or indirectly via an endogenous adapter protein (Fig. 4 B), and such self-association could facilitate its auto-cleavage. The DREDD processing was not inhibited by p35 and crmA, two active site-specific caspase inhibitors that can inhibit most caspases (Fig. 4 Aand data not shown), and DREDD may possess unique substrate specificity. In the presence of dFADD, DREDD processing went to completion (Fig. 4 A), whereas DRONC was not processed upon overexpression either in the presence or absence of dFADD (Fig.4 A). It appears that the enhancement of DREDD processing by dFADD is mediated by direct protein-protein interaction. DREDD was previously reported to associate with theDrosophila Apaf-1 homologue DARK (23Rodriguez A. Oliver H. Zou H. Chen P. Wang X. Abrams J.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 272-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). OtherDrosophila caspases such as DRONC were also reported to be targets for DARK (22Zhou L. Song Z. Tittel J. Steller H. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 745-755Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar, 24Kanuka H. Sawamoto K. Inohara N. Matsuno K. Okano H. Miura M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 757-769Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). We compared the dFADD-DREDD and DARK-DREDD interactions using co-immunoprecipitation assay and found that the former was much stronger than the latter. Unlike the dFADD-DREDD interaction that was mainly mediated by the DREDD prodomain (Fig.2 E), both the DREDD prodomain and the caspase domain interacted weakly with DARK (Fig. 4 D). The strong dFADD-DREDD interaction suggests that DREDD may mainly serve as an apical caspase for dFADD. To examine the cellular localization of dFADD and DREDD, we fused them to GFP. When expressed in HeLa cells, both GFP-dFADD and GFP-DREDD proteins were localized in the cytoplasm (Fig.5 A, a andc). This localization of dFADD was mediated by its N-terminal region (Fig. 5 A, e and f). dFADD and DREDD appeared to stabilize each other, because expression of DREDD significantly increased fluorescence intensity in the GFP-dFADD-transfected cells (Fig. 5 A, b versus a), and similarly, expression of dFADD enhanced fluorescence intensity in the GFP-DREDD-transfected cells (Fig. 5 A, d versus c). We also compared the expression levels of dFADD in 293 cells in the presence and absence of DREDD. Co-transfection of dFADD with DREDD led to a higher level of dFADD in both the soluble and insoluble fractions of the cell extracts compared with transfection of FADD alone (Fig.5 B). In contrast, DRONC did not enhance dFADD protein expression (Fig. 5 B). The stabilization of dFADD by DREDD was mediated by the DREDD prodomain (Fig. 5 C and data not shown). Reciprocally, dFADD stabilized DREDD but not DRONC in 293 cells (data not shown). The mutual stabilization of dFADD and DREDD suggests that the expression of these two proteins may be co-regulated in vivo. In summary, we describe here the molecular cloning and partial characterization of the first Drosophila death domain-containing protein dFADD. dFADD contains a bipartite structure highly homologous to that of the mammalian adapter FADD. It functions similarly to FADD and physically interacts with and activates theDrosophila caspase DREDD. The interaction between dFADD and DREDD stabilizes both proteins. We conclude that Drosophilaalso contains a FADD-like apoptotic pathway. To date, no death receptors have been identified in Drosophila, and despite the high homology between the death domains of FADD and dFADD, we did not detect interaction between dFADD and any of the mammalian death receptors (data not shown). Identification of components upstream of dFADD should help determine the regulation and function of this evolutionarily conserved apoptosis pathway.

The cell cycle activators, cyclin D2 and cyclin E, are increased by FSH and steroids in rapidly growing preovulatory follicles but are rapidly turned off by the surge of LH that terminates follicular growth (1Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Conversely, the cell cycle inhibitors, p27KIP1 and p21CIP1, are induced by the LH surge (1Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Biol. Reprod. 1998; 59: 476-482Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 2Robker R.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 924-940Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Thus, the gonadotropins impact cell cycle progression at multiple steps depending on the stage of granulosa cell differentiation. The effects of the gonadotropins on ovarian cell proliferation and differentiation are mediated by changes in intracellular cAMP that activates cAMP-dependent protein kinases (protein kinase A) (3Richards J.S. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 725-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), as well as several other kinases (4Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Alliston T.N. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1318-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Falender A.E. Ochsner S. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 1283-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Known targets of protein kinase A are the cAMP regulatory element (CRE)-binding protein CREB and the CREB-binding protein CBP (6Habener J.F. Miller C.P. Vallejo M. Vitam. Horm. 1995; 51: 1-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). CREs are essential for transcriptional activation of aromatase (7Carlone D.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 292-304PubMed Google Scholar) and inhibin α (8Pei L. Dodson R. Schoderbek W.E. Maurer R.A. Mayo K.E. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar), as well as the AP1 factors, c-fos (9Mukherjee A. Park-Sarge O.-K. Mayo K.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3234-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) and fra2(10Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 170-190Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). AP1 factors, in turn, mediate FSH-regulated expression ofinhibin βA by binding to a variant CRE in the promoter of the βA gene (11Ardekani A.M. Romanelli J.C.D. Mayo K.E. Endocrinology. 1998; 139: 3271-3279Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Members of the AP1 transcription factor superfamily are proto-oncogenes that regulate cell proliferation and transformation (12Morganm J.I. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 421-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar). They have also been associated with differentiation (13Vojtek A.B. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19925-19928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 14Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that specific AP1 factors or the combination of specific AP1 factors may regulate different sets of functions at specific stages of granulosa cell differentiation. Despite the intense research efforts that have analyzed the function of the Jun/Fos family in many different cell types, relatively few studies have analyzed how hormones regulate the expression of AP1 factors in granulosa cells or how these factors might impact FSH or LH activation of specific genes. Therefore, it becomes imperative to know which AP1 factors are present in granulosa cells and which might be regulated or activated by FSH and LH. The AP1 transcription factor family is composed of Jun family members (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD) that can form homo- or heterodimers among themselves and bind to AP1 consensus DNA (TGACTCA) (10Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 170-190Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 12Morganm J.I. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 421-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar, 15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Jun proteins also dimerize with Fos family members (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) (10Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 170-190Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 12Morganm J.I. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 421-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar, 16Morgan J.I. Curran T. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 66-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Thus, the functional activity of AP1 in any given cell is dependent in part on the relative amount of specific Jun/Fos factors present in that cell. Most AP1 transcription factors are present at low levels in cells but are rapidly induced and activated in response to specific stimuli. For example, the c-fos gene has a complex promoter that contains a CRE, a serum response element (SRE), and a Sis-inducible enhancer allowing it to respond to multiple hormones, growth factors, and cytokines (10Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 170-190Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar, 17Robertson L.M. Kerppola T.K. Vendrell M. Luk D. Smeyne R.J. Bocchiaro C. Morgan J.I. Curran T. Neuron. 1995; 14: 241-252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar). Not surprisingly then, c-fos has been shown to be induced by FSH in granulosa cells (9Mukherjee A. Park-Sarge O.-K. Mayo K.E. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 3234-3245Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The promoter of the junB gene is also complex with Stat3, CRE, CAAT enhancer (CAAT) binding domains, as well as an interleukin-6 regulatory region (10Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 170-190Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 18Tjin Tham Sjin R.M. Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28697-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Different promoter regions are utilized in different cell types (18Tjin Tham Sjin R.M. Lord K.A. Abdollahi A. Hoffman B. Liebermann D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28697-28707Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Although JunB is expressed in ovarian cells (19Hirai S.-I. Ryseck R.-P. Mechta F. Bravo R. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), the factors regulating its expression have not been analyzed. In contrast, the promoter of c-jun is simpler (10Herdegen T. Leah J.D. Brain Res. Rev. 1998; 28: 170-190Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar, 15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar), and junD is constitutively expressed in many cell lines (19Hirai S.-I. Ryseck R.-P. Mechta F. Bravo R. Yaniv M. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 1433-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). The functional activation of AP1 factors in mammalian cells requires phosphorylation (15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). The activated AP1 factors have been shown to regulate gene expression by direct as well as indirect mechanisms (12Morganm J.I. Curran T. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1991; 14: 421-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (2472) Google Scholar,16Morgan J.I. Curran T. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 66-67Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Direct activation requires that AP1 factors bind an AP1 regulatory domain present in the promoters of target genes and that the AP1 factors be phosphorylated in their activation domain. The AP1 DNA binding domain was originally known as the 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate response element, since in response to phorbol ester tumor promoters such as 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate, the AP1 factors are phosphorylated, activated, and induced transcription (15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). However, AP1 factors can be phosphorylated and activated in response to numerous other agonists, suggesting that their activation profile is more complex than originally thought. In fact, PMA which activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase does not activate Fos-regulating kinase, Frk (15Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2256) Google Scholar). Activated AP1 factors can also enhance gene transcription by indirect mechanisms that involve their binding to other transcription factors via protein-protein interactions but do not require their binding to DNA. For example, members of the Jun/Fos family of transcription factors have recently been shown to interact with both Sp1/Sp3 and Smad proteins to enhance transcriptional activity of specific promoters with GC-rich and SMAD-binding regulatory elements, respectively (14Kardassis D. Papakosta P. Pardali K. Moustakas A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29572-29581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 20Zhang Y. Feng X.-H. Derynck R. Nature. 1998; 394: 909-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). This may be one attractive way in which FSH or LH regulate the expression of cyclins, p21 cip or p27 kip , as well as sgk. c-Jun has also been shown recently to recruit CBP for enhanced activation of CREB (21Hu P.P.-C. Harvat B.L. Hook S.S. Shen X. Wang X.-F. Means A.R. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 2039-2048PubMed Google Scholar). Such a mechanism may be contribute to FSH activation of aromatase. The importance of c-Jun is underscored by the embryonic lethality of mice null for c-jun (22Johnson R.S. Lingen V. Papaioannou V. Spiegelman B.M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 1309-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). In contrast, mice null for c-fos are viable but exhibit pleiotropic effects (23Johnson R.S. Spiegelman B.M. Papaioannou V. Cell. 1992; 71: 577-586Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). Based on the roles of AP1 factors in cell proliferation, differentiation, and transformation, we sought to determine which AP1 factors are present in and regulated by hormones in granulosa cells during follicular growth and terminal differentiation to luteal cells. For these studies we have used both in vitro and in vivo models, Western blotting, and DNA binding-electrophoretic mobility shift assays to identify and quantify Jun (c-Jun, JunD, and JunB) and Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2) family members present in granulosa cells. The hormonal activation of AP1 factors in granulosa cells was analyzed by transiently transfecting cells with AP1 promoter-luciferase reporter constructs. Specific cellular signaling cascades were activated by adding forskolin, an agonist that stimulates cAMP, as well as the phorbol ester PMA that is a known activator of AP1 factors in other cell types. Results show that each AP1 factor exhibited a specific expression pattern and response to hormones. Rapid induction of JunB, c-Fos, and Fra2 by FSH corresponds to the pattern of other immediate-early genes in granulosa cells, whereas rapid induction of junD and fra2 by LH in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles resulted in their prolonged, stable expression during the transition to luteal cells. JunD, in addition to c-Jun and c-Fos, was present as a major Jun factor comprising the AP1-DNA binding complex and controlled transactivation of the AP1-promoter reporter construct. Thus, JunD and Fra2 as well as c-Jun and c-Fos appear to be selectively expressed in terminally differentiated luteal cells indicating the composition of AP1 factors changes during granulosa cell proliferation and differentiation. Media and cell culture reagents and materials were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc., Sigma, Research Organics (Cleveland, OH), Fisher, Corning Glass, and HyClone (Logan, UT).

The Gal4-ELK and 4XGAl-luciferase vectors were generously provided by Dr. Philip Stork (Oregon Health Science Center, Portland OR), and the −73COL-luciferase vector was provided by Dr. Michael Karin (University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA). Intact and hypophysectomized (H) immature (day 23 of age) Holtzman Harlan Sprague-Dawley female rats were obtained from Harlan (Indianapolis, IN) and housed under a 16:8 light:dark schedule in the Center for Comparative Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and provided food and water ad libitum. Animals were treated in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, as approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at Baylor College of Medicine (Houston, TX). To obtain granulosa cells for primary cultures, immature rats were injected with estradiol (E, 1.5 mg/day for 3 days) (7Carlone D.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 292-304PubMed Google Scholar). To analyze the expression of AP1 factors during follicular development in vivo, H rats were treated with E (HE, as above) to stimulate the growth of large preantral follicles. To analyze the response of granulosa cells to acute exposure to FSH, some HE rats were injected intravenously with 5 μg of oFSH. Ovaries (for immunohistochemistry) and granulosa cells (for whole cell extracts) were isolated from H and HE rats prior to FSH (0 h) or from HE rats exposed to FSH for 2 and 8 h (HE, FSH 2, 8 h). Other HE rats were injected subcutaneously with 1.0 μg of oFSH twice daily for 2 days (HEF, 48 h) to stimulate the growth of preovulatory follicles that express aromatase, LH receptor, and inhibin-α (24Alliston T.N. Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Buse P. Fireston G.L. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). HEF rats were subsequently injected intravenously with 10 IU of hCG, an LH-like hormone, to stimulate ovulation and luteinization. Ovaries and granulosa cells were prepared prior to (0 h) and at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24 h after hCG for immunohistochemistry and WCE, respectively (shown schematically in Fig. 1). Granulosa cells were harvested from estradiol-primed intact immature (day 25) rats as described previously (7Carlone D.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 292-304PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were cultured at a density of 1 × 106 cells per 3 ml of serum-free medium (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium:Ham's F-12 medium containing penicillin and streptomycin) in multiwell (35-mm) dishes that were serum-coated. Cells were cultured in defined medium overnight (0 h) followed by the addition of FSH (50 ng/ml) and testosterone (T; 10 ng/ml), forskolin (10 μm), and other agonists as indicated in the figures legends. FSH/T were used to stimulate the differentiation of granulosa cells to a preovulatory phenotype in which aromatase (7Carlone D.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 292-304PubMed Google Scholar), LH receptor (25Segaloff D.L. Wang H. Richards J.S. Mol.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 521-534Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) are expressed. Forskolin was added to these cells to mimic the LH surge and luteinization. Forskolin alone was used to determine the relative effects of cAMP on specific cell functions (4Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Alliston T.N. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol.

Hormones, agonists, and antagonists were added as indicated in the figure legends. After culture overnight, granulosa cells were transfected by the calcium phosphate precipitation method (27Fitzpatrick S.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1309-1319PubMed Google Scholar) using 5 μg of vector DNA:−73COL-luciferase (15Karin M. J. Biol.

Four hours later the cells were washed thoroughly in fresh medium. At that time (0 h) the cells were stimulated with agonists. After 6 h of agonist stimulation, cell lysates were prepared and used to measure luciferase activity according to standard protocols. Relative light units were normalized to protein (mini-Bradford assay; Bio-Rad) in each sample. All transfections were run in triplicate, and each set of experiments was repeated at least three times. Unless otherwise indicated, values represent the mean ± S.E. of three experiments. Total cell extracts were prepared from cultured granulosa cells according to a method of Ginty et al. (32Ginty D.D. Kornhauser J.M. Thompson M.A. Bading H. Mayo K.E. Takahashi J.S. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1993; 260: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (745) Google Scholar) by adding to each well hot (100 °C) Tris buffer containing 10% SDS and β-mercaptoethanol (4Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Alliston T.N. Buse P. Firestone G.L. Richards J.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 1318-1337Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cells were rapidly scraped with a rubber policeman. The cell extract was immediately transferred to an Eppendorf tube for 5 min at 100 °C and then stored at 4 °C. Equal volumes (50 μl) of samples were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). Following SDS-PAGE, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nylon filter, washed briefly in phosphate-buffered saline, and blotted with either 3% bovine serum albumin or 5% Carnation milk at room temperature for 1 h. Antibodies were added in the same blocking solutions at the dilutions indicated in the figure legends. Immunoreactive proteins were visualized with ECL reagents according to the specification of the supplier (Pierce). Immunoreactive bands were quantified by image analysis of autoradiograms (ECL) using AlphaImager 2000 (3.3), Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA. Whole cell extracts (WCE) were prepared from hormonally stimulated granulosa cells in culture or from hormonally primed H rats as described previously (29Sharma S.C. Clemens J.W. Pisarska M.D. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 4320-4334Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and in the figure legends. WCE were incubated 20 min on ice with a32P-labeled consensus AP1 oligonucleotide probe and then subjected to non-denaturing electrophoresis (0.5× TBE, Tris borate-EDTA) at 150 V. Where indicated, either unlabeled probe or antibodies to specific AP1 transcription factors were added to the reactions 30 min on ice before the addition of labeled DNA. Immunohistochemical analyses of AP1 factors in whole ovaries isolated from hormonally primed rats were performed as described previously (24Alliston T.N. Gonzalez-Robayna I.J. Buse P. Fireston G.L. Richards J.S. Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 385-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Ovaries were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and were paraffin-embedded. Sections (6 microns) were processed according to routine procedures and then blocked with 10% non-immune goat serum followed by incubation with specific antibodies diluted 1:50 in 10% goat serum overnight at room temperature. After washing in phosphate-buffered saline, biotinylated anti-rabbit antiserum (Vector, Berlingame, CA) was added for 30 min, slides were washed, and streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase was applied for 30 min. Sections were incubated with DAB substrate (3,3′-diaminobenzidene) for 2 min, dehydrated without counter-staining, and mounted. Transfection data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance or Student's t test. Values were considered significantly different if p < 0.05. The AP1 transcription factor superfamily represents an important signal transduction system in mammalian cells. However, relatively little is known about which AP1 factors are expressed or activated in ovarian granulosa cells. Therefore, our initial goals were to determine which members of the AP1 family of transcription factors were present in undifferentiated granulosa cells and which factors might be regulated by hormones in association with proliferationversus differentiation. Two models were used to analyze hormone-induced changes in AP1 expression in granulosa cells (Fig.1). In the first model, undifferentiated granulosa cells were harvested and cultured in defined medium overnight. At that time the undifferentiated cells were either stimulated acutely (1.5 h) with forskolin to increase cAMP, the phorbol ester PMA (a known activator of AP1 factors), or the combination of forskolin and PMA. To stimulate the differentiation of granulosa cells to a preovulatory phenotype, FSH/T were added to the cells for 48 h. These differentiated cells (FSH/T), which express aromatase and LH receptor, were also stimulated acutely with forskolin, PMA, or the combination to mimic the acute effects of the LH surge. Finally, the differentiated cells were cultured with forskolin for longer periods to mimic the LH-induced process of luteinization in which granulosa cells cease to divide and are terminally differentiated. In the second model, hypophysectomized immature rats (H) were injected with estradiol (E; HE rats) to stimulate granulosa cell proliferation and the growth of large preantral follicles. Subsequently, FSH (F) was administered to the HE rats (HEF) to examine rapid effects as well as long term effects of the gonadotropins, leading to the development of preovulatory follicles (see “Experimental Procedures” for details). HEF rats were injected with an ovulatory dose of the LH-like hormone, hCG, to stimulate terminal differentiation of granulosa cells. This process of luteinization leads to the formation of corpora lutea. To analyze the response of undifferentiated cells, granulosa cells were harvested from immature rats and cultured with forskolin to stimulate cAMP production for different time intervals (0, 0.33 (20 min), 0.66 (40 min), 1.5, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h). Cell extracts were prepared and analyzed by Western blotting using antibodies specific for individual members of the AP1 transcription factor family as follows: c-Jun, JunB, JunD, c-Fos, FosB, Fra1, and Fra2 (Fig.2). When undifferentiated granulosa cells were acutely stimulated with forskolin, different patterns of AP1 protein expression were observed (Fig. 2). Among the Jun family members, immunoreactive c-Jun was present at low levels in granulosa cells cultured overnight in medium alone (0 h). The addition of forskolin stimulated 1-, 5-, 6-, and 8-fold increases in c-Jun at 20, 40, and 90 min and 3 h, respectively. Levels of c-Jun decreased at 6 h and remained at this level at subsequent time intervals. JunB exhibited a similar pattern of response as that of c-Jun, but the magnitude of induction was greater. JunB increased 1-, 3-, 14-, and 16-fold at 20, 40, and 90 min and 3 h, respectively. Levels of JunB protein were decreased at 6 h and remained low. In contrast, JunD was present in granulosa cells at 0 h, and its expression was relatively unaffected by the addition of forskolin. Among the Fos family members, immunoreactive c-Fos increased rapidly in response to forskolin; 2- and 6-fold increases occurred at 20 and 90 min, respectively (Fig. 2). However, this increase was transient; immunoreactive c-Fos returned to the base-line (0 h) level between 3 and 6 h and remained low thereafter. Similarly, FosB and Fra1 exhibited increases in response to forskoli"

We reveal in this paper that the protein produced by the cDNA for human lysyl hydroxylase isoform 3 (LH3) has both lysyl hydroxylase and glucosyltransferase (GGT) activities. The other known lysyl hydroxylase isoforms, LH1, LH2a, and LH2b, have no GGT activity. Furthermore, antibodies recognizing the amino acid sequence of human LH3 and those against a highly purified chicken GGT partially inhibited the GGT activity. Similarly, a partial inhibition was observed when these antibodies were tested against GGT extracted from human skin fibroblasts. In vitro mutagenesis experiments demonstrate that the amino acids involved in the GGT active site differ from those required for LH3 activity. Lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4) and glucosyltransferase (EC 2.4.1.66) are enzymes involved in post-translational modifications during collagen biosynthesis. We reveal in this paper that the protein produced by the cDNA for human lysyl hydroxylase isoform 3 (LH3) has both lysyl hydroxylase and glucosyltransferase (GGT) activities. The other known lysyl hydroxylase isoforms, LH1, LH2a, and LH2b, have no GGT activity. Furthermore, antibodies recognizing the amino acid sequence of human LH3 and those against a highly purified chicken GGT partially inhibited the GGT activity.

They play a crucial role in maintenance of the structural integrity of tissues and in regulation of cellular behavior. The collagens, like other extracellular proteins, bind to growth factors and other regulatory components of cells and modulate cellular metabolism. To date, 19 genetically distinct collagen types have been identified (1Kielty C.M. Hopkinson I. Grant M.E. Royce P.M. Steinmann P.M. Connective Tissue and Its Heritable Disorders. Wiley-Liss, Inc., New York1993: 103-147Google Scholar, 2Kadler, K. (1994) in Protein Profile (Sheterline, P., ed) Vol. 1, pp 525–534, 545–549, Academic Press, London.Google Scholar, 3Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The collagen molecule is composed of three polypeptide chains, which coil around each other into a triple helical structure. Some of the collagen types, such as type I, II, and III collagens, have a rod-like structure without any interruptions in the helical region, whereas in the other types the triple-helical regions are interrupted with multiple short nonhelical sequences. Collagen molecules are aggregated in tissues into supramolecular structures such as fibrils, beaded filaments, or net-like or other kinds of structures depending on the type of collagen (3Prockop D.J. Kivirikko K.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 403-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (1379) Google Scholar). The biosynthesis of collagen involves several post-translational modifications, which include hydroxylation of lysyl residues, galactosylation of hydroxylysyl residues, and glucosylation of galactosylhydroxylysyl residues. These reactions occur in the endoplasmic reticulum before triple helix formation. Hydroxylysine occurs in the Y position of the repeating Xaa-Yaa-Gly triplet within the helical region of collagen molecules and also in the sequence of the nonhelical telopeptide regions of some collagen types when glycine is replaced either by serine or alanine (2Kadler, K. (1994) in Protein Profile (Sheterline, P., ed) Vol. 1, pp 525–534, 545–549, Academic Press, London.Google Scholar, 4Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C. Post-translational Modifications of Proteins. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-51Google Scholar). The hydroxy groups of hydroxylysyl residues provide attachment sites for glycosyl residues, either the monosaccharide galactose or the disaccharide glucosylgalactose. The hydroxy groups also play a crucial role in the formation of inter- and intramolecular collagen cross-links. The biological role of the hydroxylysyl-linked carbohydrates, which are collagen-specific structures, is not clear. These carbohydrates point outward from the collagen helix and, thus, are located at the surface of the protein where they probably play an important role in lateral interactions between collagen triple helices and between collagen molecules and other extracellular matrix components. The number of glycosylated hydroxylysyl residues as well as hydroxylated lysyl residues is very variable, both between collagen types and within the same collagen in different tissues and at different ages (2Kadler, K. (1994) in Protein Profile (Sheterline, P., ed) Vol. 1, pp 525–534, 545–549, Academic Press, London.Google Scholar, 4Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Pihlajaniemi T. Harding J.J. Crabbe M.J.C.

Lysyl hydroxylase (EC 1.14.11.4) catalyzes the hydroxylation of lysyl residues in collagens in a reaction that requires Fe2+, 2-oxoglutarate, O2, and ascorbate (4Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R.

Galactosylhydroxylysyl glucosyltransferase (GGT, EC 2.4.1.66) adds glucose to some galactosyl hydroxylysyl residues in collagen in a reaction that requires Mn2+ and UDP-glucose (12Kivirikko K.I.

We report here a multifunction of LH3. The protein produced by the LH3 cDNA has both LH and GGT activities. Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda) insect cells were grown in Sf-900 II serum-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.). Expression of recombinant protein was carried out by the baculovirus transfer vector (15Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing Associates/Wiley-Interscience, New York, NY1988: 16.9-16.11Google Scholar) in the BAC-TO-BACTM expression system (Life Technologies, Inc.). COS-7 cells were grown at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% newborn calf serum. 8 × 105 cells/100-mm dish or 1 × 105cells/35-mm dish were plated 1 day before transfection. Cells were transfected by plasmid DNA using FUGENE6 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). After incubation for 0–48 h, the cells were harvested and washed twice with PBS. Commercially available baculovirus transfer vector pFastBacI in the BAC-TO-BACTM expression system was modified to contain the human LH1 signal peptide (5Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), a His6 tag, and a BamHI restriction site for insertion of the desired cDNA, nucleotides 289–2455 of LH3 cDNA (7Valtavaara M. Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12881-12886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The construct was confirmed by sequencing. The recombinant protein contains the His tag at the amino terminus after signal peptide cleavage. Insect cells were harvested 0–72 h after infection and homogenized according to the protocol described earlier (6Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.M. Hiltunen K. Helander H. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Expression of LH3 cDNA was also carried out in a mammalian expression vector as LH3 and as a LH3-GFP fusion protein. The human LH3-coding sequence covering the nucleotides 214 to 2447 (7Valtavaara M. Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12881-12886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) was subcloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of a pCDNA3 vector (Invitrogen) and expressed in COS-7 cells. The coding sequence was also subcloned into the EcoRI site of the pEGFP-N1 vector (CLONTECH), where a GFP tag forms the carboxyl terminus of the fusion protein. The intervening stop codon (TGA) of LH3 was mutated to TGG (Trp) by changing A2443 to G2443 using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). To maintain the correct reading frame for GFP, T2447 was simultaneously deleted from the sequence. The transfected COS-7 cells were sonicated in a solution containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.2 m NaCl, and 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, for 10 s in ice, and centrifuged (14,000 rpm × 30 min), and the supernatant used in activity measurements. The human LH1 signal peptide and a His6 tag were inserted to cDNA constructs of LH1 and LH2. The baculovirus transfer vector pFastBacI was modified so that human LH1 signal sequence followed by nine nucleotides of the amino-terminal end was ligated to the His6 tag followed by nucleotides for BamHI restriction site. The human cDNA sequence (LH1 or LH2) starting from the likely amino-terminal end of the molecule was ligated to theBamHI site of the construct. Two expression constructs were generated for LH2, LH2a and LH2b, both of them covered the nucleotides from 76 to 2267 (6Valtavaara M. Papponen H. Pirttilä A.M. Hiltunen K. Helander H. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6831-6834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The LH2b construct also contained the alternatively spliced exon sequence (11Yeowell H.N. Walker L.C. Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 179-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) between nucleotides 1500 and 1501. The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Insect cells were grown and homogenized as described above. His-tagged recombinant proteins were purified by Ni-NTA-agarose (Qiagen) using the batch purification protocol as described by the manufacturer. The agarose was equilibrated with 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.3 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 10 mm imidazole. Ni-NTA-agarose was mixed into the cell homogenate with additions of 5% glycerol, 0.3 m NaCl, and 10 mm imidazole, and the slurry was incubated for 45 min at 4 °C on a rocking platform. The matrix was then washed in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.3 m NaCl, 5% glycerol, and 20 mm imidazole. Elution (incubation of the matrix for 10 min in an elution buffer) was carried out in three steps; the elution buffers contained 100, 200, and 300 mmimidazole. To follow expression of the LH3-GFP fusion protein in COS-7 cells, the cells transfected with the pEGFP-N1-LH3 plasmid DNA were grown on coverslips. Forty-eight hours after transfection, the cells were washed twice with PBS and briefly rinsed in distilled water. The coverslips were then mounted on slides using Immuno-mount (Shandon). The expression levels of the LH3-GFP fusion protein were visualized directly by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon). The transfected cells were also stained with antibody against protein disulfide isomerase (16Höyhtyä M. Myllylä R. Piuva J. Kivirikko K. Tryggvason K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 141: 477-482Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). The cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, pH 7.4, for 20 min, blocked for 1 h in 0.05% saponin, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in PBS buffer pH 7.4 (IF buffer), followed by a 1-h incubation at room temperature with a monoclonal antibody (1:100) against protein disulfide isomerase (DAKO). Coverslips were washed three times with IF buffer and incubated for a further 1 h with an anti-mouse IgG tetramethylrhodamine B isothiocyanate (1:100) (DAKO). After three washes with PBS and one brief rinse in distilled water, the coverslips were mounted on slides using Immuno-mount, and the staining was observed by fluorescence microscopy. Cells transfected with the LH3 construct or vector alone were lysed with 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at 4 °C. The cell extracts were pretreated with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to remove nonspecific binding and then immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-GFP antibody (CLONTECH) or monoclonal anti-polyhistidine antibody (Sigma) together with protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads. The proteins bound to beads were separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by immunoblotting or silver staining. For in vitro translation, the coding sequence (amino acids 33–738) of LH3 cDNA was cloned in-frame into the pCITE 4a vector (Novagen) at theEcoRI/XhoI site under the T7 promoter. This vector provides the transcribed mRNA with a cap independent translation enhancer at the 5′ end and a poly(A) tail. The plasmid was subcloned into Escherichia coli XL1-blue strain and purified with a Mini Plasmid kit (Qiagen). In vitro translation was performed with the single tube protein system 3 kit, STP3 (Novagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reaction volumes were scaled down. Briefly, for transcription, 200 ng of plasmid were mixed with 3.2 μl of transcription mix in a total volume of 4 μl and incubated at 30 °C for 15 min. For translation, 1.6 μl of [35S]methionine (10 mCi/ml, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or 0.8 μl of cold methionine in the kit and 12 μl of translation mix were added to the transcription reaction and incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The product was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography, and GGT activity was measured directly in the reaction mixture containing unlabeled methionine. LH activity was assayed by a method based on the hydroxylation-coupled decarboxylation of 2-oxo[1-14C]glutarate (17Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 82: 245-304Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar) with the synthetic peptide IKGIKGIKG used as a substrate. GGT activity was assayed as described elsewhere (18Myllylä R. Risteli L. Kivirikko K. Eur. J. Biochem. 1975; 52: 401-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The method is based on the transfer of radioactively (tritium)-labeled glucose from UDP-glucose to galactosylhydroxylysyl residues in a calf skin gelatin substrate and on the specific detection of the product of the enzyme reaction after alkaline hydrolysis. Western blot analysis was carried out using monoclonal antibodies against the His tag (Sigma) or GFP protein (CLONTECH). The cell homogenates were fractionated under reducing conditions by 10% SDS-PAGE, blotted onto an Immobilon membrane (Millipore), and incubated with the primary antibodies. Anti-mouse IgG peroxidase conjugate (Sigma) was used as the secondary antibody. Bound antibodies were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co). The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to make point mutations or deletions to the LH3 cDNA sequence. The antibodies used in the GGT reaction were the following: rabbit polyclonal antibodies against highly purified GGT isolated from chicken embryos (19Myllylä R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), chicken polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide of human LH3 (20Wang C. Valtavaara M. Myllylä R. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal antibodies against the His-tag (Sigma), and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against the human Dpb11 protein. 2T. Hillukkala and M. Mäkiniemi, unpublished information. We have prepared a cDNA construct of LH3 for expression of an LH3 protein with a His tag, which remains at the amino-terminal end of the protein after signal peptide cleavage. Sf9 cells were infected with this construct, and LH and GGT activity were measured in the cells at different time points (Fig.1 A). As seen in the figure, the enzyme activities began to increase about 30 h after transfection. At this same time we could begin to detect GGT activity in the culture medium. We were unable to measure LH activity, however, due to the presence of inhibitory substances in the medium (21Krol B.J. Murad S. Walker L.C. Marshall M.K. Clark W.L. Pinnell S.R. Yeowell H.N. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1996; 106: 11-16Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The rapid increase of GGT activity in the medium, approximately 50 h after transfection, seen in Fig. 1 A, was probably due to cell lysis due to the infection.Figure 1LH and GGT activity in cells transfected with LH3 cDNA. A, Sf9 cells were transfected with a His-tagged construct, and LH3 and GGT activities were measured in different time points. B, COS-7 cells were transfected with a native LH3 construct, and GGT activity was measured in different time points. Nontransfected cells were used as controls. DPM, disintegrations/min.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We tested the transfections also in mammalian cells, where native LH3 cDNA was used in the transfections (Fig. 1 B). A similar time curve for GGT activity was obtained in these cells. When the transfected COS-7 cells were studied at different time points by Northern hybridization using LH3 cDNA as a probe, the data indicated a clear increase in LH3 mRNA 20 h after transfection (not shown). The results presented in Table I indicate the activities measured in one experiment. There is a large increase in GGT activity in the LH3 cDNA-transfected Sf9 and COS-7 cells. The increase is higher in the Sf9 cells, varying from about 120 to 2500 times the background activity in different transfections. Nontransfected COS-7 cells possess high GGT activity, but after transfection, the activity increased to the background level about 4–5-fold. Expression of LH3 in both systems resulted in secretion of enzyme into the medium (Table I). In Sf9 cells, about 25 to 55% of the activity was secreted, whereas in COS-7 cells the corresponding value was about 80%.Table IGGT activity in Sf9 and COS-7 cells transfected with LH3 cDNA constructsCellsMedium% in mediumdpm/plateSf9 cells Nontransfected1,0005,000ND LH3 transfected2,000,0001,200,00037COS-7 cells Nontransfected72,00069,00048 LH3 transfected270,0001,200,00082Sf9 cells were transfected with a construct containing the signal peptide of LH1 and His tag at the amino terminus of LH3 protein.

COS cells were transfected with the construct containing the LH3, including the signal peptide sequence of LH3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). One plate corresponds to about 1.4 × 106 cells. The activity measurements were carried out 72 h (Sf9 cells) and 48 h (COS-7 cells) after transfection. Open table in a new tab Sf9 cells were transfected with a construct containing the signal peptide of LH1 and His tag at the amino terminus of LH3 protein. One plate corresponds to about 10 × 106 cells. ND, not determined. COS cells were transfected with the construct containing the LH3, including the signal peptide sequence of LH3 (see “Experimental Procedures”). One plate corresponds to about 1.4 × 106 cells. The activity measurements were carried out 72 h (Sf9 cells) and 48 h (COS-7 cells) after transfection. We prepared a construct for the LH3-GFP fusion protein in which GFP, a fluorescent protein, was inserted into the carboxyl-terminal end of LH3. The cells transfected with the construct produced a fusion protein, which can be visualized by fluorescence microscopy. As seen in Fig.2 A, the fusion protein was located mainly in the endoplasmic reticulum. In some cells, the fluorescent protein also entered the Golgi complex (Fig.2 B), in agreement with the finding that a part of the expressed protein was secreted. When the activity measurements were carried out 48 h after transfection, the results indicated a 2–3-fold increase of GGT activity in cells (not shown), suggesting the correct three-dimensional conformation of the LH3-GFP fusion protein for the catalysis in the GGT reaction. LH3 was expressed in Sf9 cells as a protein with a His tag at the amino terminus. This enabled us to use a nickel column in the purification of the recombinant protein from the cell extract. Nickel-charged agaroses are highly selective for polyhistidine (6×His). Our results indicated that 60% of the GGT activity was bound to the nickel column, and all the activity could be eluted from the column by imidazole. No lysyl hydroxylase activity could be detected in the eluate, however. We have determined that imidazole is a potent inhibitor of lysyl hydroxylase activity. Incubation of His-tagged LH3 for 2 h on ice in the presence of 300 mm imidazole caused almost complete inactivation of the enzyme. Imidazole at concentrations of 100 and 10 mminactivated lysyl hydroxylase activity by 55 and 20%, respectively. In contrast, imidazole in concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 mm had no effect on GGT activity, but 300 mmimidazole inhibited GGT activity by 25% (not shown). The column eluate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunostained using anti-His-tag antibodies on a Western blot. One major band was present on the blot with a molecular weight of about 85,000 (Fig.3). Furthermore, immunoprecipitation of crude Sf9 lysate was carried out using anti-His-tag antibodies, and the precipitate was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. A protein band with a molecular weight of about 85,000 (not shown) was present in the precipitate. We also used immunoprecipitation to purify the LH3 fusion protein from COS-7 cells. The fusion protein contained a GFP tag at the carboxyl-terminal end of the protein. The anti-GFP antibody immunoprecipitated from the COS-7 cell lysate a protein that has a molecular weight of 116,000 (not shown). This size corresponds to the expected molecular weight of LH3-GFP fusion protein. A cell-free system can be used to study the expression of a supplemented DNA in a condition where no other DNA is present. The presence of a radioactive amino acid allows detection of even low amounts of the protein expressed in the system. We have used the cell-free system to rule out the possibility that a DNA sequence other than the LH3 cDNA is responsible for the production of GGT activity. As seen in Fig.4, only one protein (Fig. 4 A) was translated in the cell-free system when LH3 cDNA was added to the incubation mixture. The molecular weight corresponds to that of LH3. The addition of dog pancreas microsomes to the incubation mixture did not change the molecular weight of the translated protein (not shown). The appearance of the protein in the expression system was associated with the presence of GGT activity (Fig. 4 B), indicating that GGT activity was linked to LH3 protein. Polyclonal antibodies were used to study whether the antibody binding inhibits the catalytic activity of the GGT produced by the His-tagged LH3 cDNA construct in Sf9 cells. We used antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 283 to 297 of the human LH3 (20Wang C. Valtavaara M. Myllylä R. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). In addition, we used antibodies against chicken glucosyltransferase isolated as a homogenous protein (19Myllylä R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). As seen in Table II, both antibodies partially inhibited the GGT activity. However, no inhibition by anti-His tag antibodies was detected. Antibodies against human Dpb11 protein were used as controls, and these antibodies had no effect on GGT activity.Table IIInhibition of GGT activity in LH3 transfected Sf9 cells (Sf9/LH3) and human fibroblasts (FB) by different antibodiesAntibodySf9/LH3pvalueFBp value%%Nonimmune serum100 ± 7100 ± 24LH384 ± 130.04367 ± 220.046GGT84 ± 120.02970 ± 30.043His tag100 ± 6NS92 ± 23NSDpb11101 ± 22NS108 ± 27NS4 μl of serum was added to the GGT incubation mixture, and the activity in the presence of nonimmune serum was taken as 100%; the mean ± S.D. is expressed.

Three to four samples were measured with each antibody. Statistical significance was calculated using two sample t tests assuming equal variances. NS, not significant. The antibodies were also tested with GGT prepared from human skin fibroblasts. LH3 and GGT antibodies partially inhibited GGT activity from human skin fibroblasts (Table II), whereas no inhibition was obtained with anti-His antibodies or control antibodies. To determine what regions of the molecule or which amino acids of LH3 are required for GGT activity, we generated a frame shift in LH3 after leucine at position 231 by a one-nucleotide deletion. This modification of the construct produced a protein shown in Fig.5 A, where only amino acids up to 231 were similar to the LH3 sequence. This protein had neither LH nor GGT activity (Table III). Removal of 217 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of LH3 totally eliminated LH activity, whereas the protein still retained about one-fifth of the GGT activity. Mutation of aspartate at position 669 to alanine decreased LH functionality dramatically, whereas it had no effect on the GGT activity. One nucleotide deletion after the codon for His-668 in the LH3 cDNA sequence caused a shift in the reading frame and generated a translational stop codon after 30 amino acids. In this protein, the last 70 carboxyl-terminal amino acids of LH3 are missing from the molecule. The protein had no LH activity but still retained about half of the original GGT activity. Fig. 5 B shows that the mutations did not cause any significant effects on the levels of protein expression.Table IIILH3 and GGT activity in Sf9 cells transfected by mutated LH3 constructsLH3 activityGGT activitydpm/plate%dpm/plate%LH3 construct, nonmutated6,000100760,000100Mutation 1<300<56500.1Mutation 2<300<5180,00023Mutation 3<300<5970,000127Mutation 4<300<5360,00047For explanation of mutations 1–4, see Fig. 5.

Similar results were obtained in three different measurements. dpm, disintegrations/min. The two other lysyl hydroxylase isoforms LH1 and LH2, the latter one in two alternatively spliced forms (LH2a and LH2b), were expressed in Sf9 cells under conditions identical to those used for LH3. GGT activity was measured in cell lysates 72 h after infection (Fig. 6). The production of recombinant proteins was followed by LH activity measurements and SDS-PAGE combined with anti-His tag antibody staining. The production of recombinant proteins was at the same level (not shown). Although LH activity was present in the cell lysates, none of these recombinant proteins had detectable GGT activity. We have shown in baculovirus and mammalian expression systems that the expression of LH3 cDNA produced both LH activity and GGT activity. The appearance of the activities in the cells occurs simultaneously, without any lag between the activities, which might suggest that expression of LH caused the simultaneous induction of transcription of the GGT gene. When LH3 was expressed with a His tag at the amino terminus, the protein with GGT activity bound to a nickel affinity column and eluted by imidazole, indicating that the GGT activity is present on the protein having a His tag in its structure. Immunoblot analysis of the eluate indicated that the protein purified by the affinity column corresponds in size to the recombinant LH3. Results from cell-free translation experiments further support the finding that LH and GGT activities are present in the same protein. Since only one protein corresponding to the size of LH3 is translated in the cell-free system supplemented with the LH3 cDNA sequence and GGT activity is present after translation, this protein has GGT activity. Upon overexpression of LH3 in insect cells, most of the GGT activity is retained inside the cell, only about 35% of the activity being secreted. It should be noted, however, that at later time points, the relative proportion of the activity of the medium increased, probably due to lysis of the cells. In COS-7 cells, the majority of the GGT activity was secreted into the medium, when followed 48 h after the transfection. Microscopic examination revealed that in some cells the protein was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum, in agreement with the data obtained with LH1 (22Kellokumpu S. Sormunen R. Heikkinen J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30524-30529Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It is probable that overexpression overloads the retention capacity, and therefore the protein starts to be secreted into the medium. This was seen in microscopy by the appearance of fluorescent signals in the Golgi complex. A difference in the amount of secretion between insect cells and COS-7 cells can be explained by the different capacities of the cells to retain proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but it may be also due to fact that the total expression of LH3/GGT per cell is higher in COS-7 cells than in insect cells. The molecular weight of LH3 corresponds to about 85,000 in SDS-PAGE (8Passoja K. Rautavuoma K. Ala-Kokko L. Kosonen T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). GGT isolated from chick embryos has a molecular weight of 78,000 (13Myllylä R. Anttinen H. Risteli L. Kivirikko K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 480: 113-121Crossref Scopus (17) Google Scholar). It is not known if there are more than one GGT in vivo, and it is also not known if the molecular weight of GGT differs in different species. It is also possible that there is a difference in a glycosylation of the protein produced in the in vitro expression system compared with the protein isolated from tissues. Only one size protein is produced by LH3 cDNA in insect cells and COS-7 cells. Furthermore, only one protein is produced in a cell-free system supplemented with the LH3 cDNA sequence. In all these systems, the protein has the molecular weight of about 85,000, which corresponds to the molecular weight of LH3. These data indicate that no processing of LH3 is required to generate the GGT activity. Our data with anti-His-tag antibodies against the His tag present at the amino terminus of LH3 and with anti-GFP antibodies against the GFP tag present at the carboxyl terminus of LH3 do not indicate that there are multiple forms of LH3 in cells. Furthermore, our screening from different tissues does not give any evidence about alternative splicing for LH3 mRNA. We have prepared polyclonal antibodies against a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 283–297 of the human LH3 sequence (20Wang C. Valtavaara M. Myllylä R. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 71-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), a region that is highly dissimilar between the lysyl hydroxylase isoforms. Antibody binding to that region of the LH3 molecule partially inhibited GGT activity. We also used antibodies that were prepared against GGT isolated as a homogenous protein from chick embryos. The binding sites of these antibodies are not known, but as observed earlier (19Myllylä R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar), these antibodies inhibited chick embryo GGT activity. The binding of the antibody partially prevented binding of the substrate, and the inhibition was more effective when tested with a high molecular weight substrate (19Myllylä R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1981; 658: 299-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). When antibodies were tested with the enzyme produced by the human His-tagged LH3 construct in Sf9 cells, a similar inhibition of the GGT reaction was observed. The data obtained by LH3 and GGT antibodies are in agreement with the suggestion that LH3 is identical to GGT. GGT antibodies furthermore suggest a similarity of binding sites of the antibodies between the chicken and human enzymes. These antibodies were also tested with GGT produced by human skin fibroblasts, and as seen in Table II, the LH3 and GGT antibodies showed similar inhibition of GGT under in vivo conditions. Mutation analysis gave direct evidence that the amino acid sequence translated from the LH3 cDNA sequence is required and is sufficient for GGT activity. If we modified the sequence such that the molecule contained only amino acids 25–231 of the LH3 sequence, the protein has no GGT activity. This result indicates that the amino-terminal portion of the molecule was not sufficient to generate the GGT activity. Mutation of aspartate at position 669 to alanine totally eliminated LH activity. This change, however, has no effect or even a slightly stimulatory effect on the GGT activity, indicating that this amino acid residue is not involved in the catalytic process of the glucosylation reaction. The aspartate to alanine mutation has also been shown to reduce LH1 activity dramatically and indicates that aspartate 669 is a part of the active site of LH1 (23Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). LH1, LH2, and LH3 have a high homology in amino acid sequences; this holds true especially at the carboxyl-terminal region of the molecules (7Valtavaara M. Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12881-12886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Passoja K. Rautavuoma K. Ala-Kokko L. Kosonen T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10482-10486Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Our mutation analysis confirmed that the carboxyl terminus was the important region for the LH activity (5Hautala T. Byers M.G. Eddy R.L. Shows T.B. Kivirikko K.I. Myllylä R. Genomics. 1992; 13: 62-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 23Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Interestingly, removal of the carboxyl-terminal end of the molecule does not totally eliminate the GGT activity, suggesting that the active center of GGT is not co-localizing with that of LH. This is also indicated by the finding that imidazole, a histidine analogue, effectively inhibited LH3 activity, whereas only a slight inhibition in GGT activity was observed. This may be explained by the finding that many conserved histidines in the carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule are required for LH activity, as indicated in LH1 by in vitro mutagenesis (23Pirskanen A. Kaimio A.M. Myllylä R. Kivirikko K.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9398-9402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), and imidazole probably prevents their participation in the catalytic process. Histidines do not appear to be necessary for GGT activity, however, and therefore imidazole does not inhibit GGT. There is a 60% identity overall between the LH isoforms at the amino acid level (7Valtavaara M. Szpirer C. Szpirer J. Myllylä R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12881-12886Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 8Passoja K. Rautavuoma K. Ala-Kokko L. Kosonen T. Kivirikko K.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Matrix Biol. 1999; 18: 325-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal portion of the molecule is highly conserved in all three lysyl hydroxylases. In addition, there are regions in the middle of the molecule that have an identity of more than 80%. It is remarkable to find that only LH3, and not LH1, LH2a, or LH2b, possesses GGT activity. It is possible that regions having less identity between the LH isoforms, such as the amino-terminal end of the molecule and a region covering amino acids 271–356, are responsible for the GGT activity of LH3. More detailed studies are needed, however, to localize the amino acids of LH3, which contribute to the catalytic site of GGT. Our results reveal the cDNA sequence of GGT, an enzyme catalyzing a unique post-translational modification of collagen. At the same time our data provide the first evidence for multifunctionality of the LH3 protein. The results are highly significant because they enable us to study in more detail the active site of collagen glucosyltransferase as well as the substrate requirements of the enzyme. In addition they facilitate the design of studies using transgenic animals to elucidate the functions of both the LH and GGT, which are disturbed in the animals, with altered levels of these activities and the cellular phenomena involved in glucosylation. These studies may also give indications of heritable disorders resulting from mutations, which limit or eliminate the glucosylation reaction in vivo."

We report here on the purification of ι-carrageenase activity from the marine bacterium Zobellia galactanovorans and on the characterization of ι-carrageenase structural genes. Genomic libraries from this latter bacterium as well as from Alteromonas fortis were functionally screened for the presence of ι-carrageenase+ clones. The Z. galactanovorans and A. fortis ι-carrageenase genes encode homologous proteins of 53.4 and 54.8 kDa, respectively. Based on hydrophobic cluster analysis and on the 1H NMR monitoring of the products of the overexpressed A. fortisι-carrageenase, these enzymes appear to form a new family of glycoside hydrolases, unrelated to that of κ-carrageenases and with an inverting mechanism of hydrolysis. They both feature a 45-amino acid-long N-terminal segment with sequence similarity to the N-terminal region of several other polysaccharidases.

Sheath R.G. Biology of the Red Algae. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1990: 221-257Google Scholar). A further layer of complexity is introduced by the occurrence of a 3,6-anhydro bridge in the α (1De Ruiter G.A. Rudolph B. Trends Food Sci. Technol. 1997; 8: 389-395Crossref Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 4Potin P. Richard C. Rochas C. Kloareg B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar)-linked galactose residues and by a variable number (from 0 in agarose to 3 in λ-carrageenan) of sulfate substituents per digalactose repeating unit (Fig. 1). Agars and carrageenans are self-associating polysaccharides, and in the solid or semi-solid state, they readily adopt simple or double-helice conformations, leading to the formation of aggregates of parallel strands (3Rees D.A. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1969; 24: 267-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). We maintain various marine bacteria that secrete galactan endo-hydrolases, including producers of κ-carrageenases, ι-carrageenases, and λ-carrageenases as well as of various agarases. These bacteria all belong to the generaPseudoalteromonas or Alteromonas and to the genusZobellia, two groups of phylogenetically distant bacteria. All but one of these hydrolases are endo-β-galactanases (4Potin P. Richard C. Rochas C. Kloareg B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 599-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). They cleave the internal β(1→4) linkages of agars or of carrageenans, yielding oligogalactans of the neocarrabiose or neoagarobiose series (5Rochas C. Heyraud M. Polym. Bull. 1981; 5: 81-86Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Rochas C. Potin C. Kloareg B. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 253: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). As these galactan hydrolases display a strict substrate specificity, they obviously recognize the pattern of sulfation on the digalactose repeating units. This set of glycoside hydrolases therefore provides a unique opportunity to investigate structure-function relationships of the hydrolases that degrade sulfated polysaccharides. With this aim, we have undertaken the molecular analysis of a representative set of carrageenases and agarases. The structural genes of the κ-carrageenase of Pseudoalteromonas carrageenovoraand that of another marine bacterium, Zobellia galactanovorans, 1The genus Zobellia and Z. galactanovorans, previously referred as Cytophaga drobachiensis, were extensively described at a taxonomic level (T. Barbeyron, S. L'Haridon, E. Corre, B. Kloareg, and P. Potin, manuscript submitted for publication). have been described in detail (7Barbeyron T. Henrissat B. Kloareg B.

The corresponding κ-carrageenases were shown to belong to family 16 of glycoside hydrolases as well as the β-agarases from Streptomyces coelicolor (8Barbeyron T. Gérard A. Potin P. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 9Buttner M.J. Fernley I.M. Bibb M.J. Mol. Gen.

Glycoside hydrolase family 16 (10–13) also comprises β-1,3-glucanases (laminarinases), β-1,3–1,4-glucanases known as lichenases, and xyloglucan endotransglycosylases, which catalyze the transfer of segments of β-1,4-xyloglucan molecules to other hemicellulose chains in plant cell walls (8Barbeyron T. Gérard A. Potin P. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 14Nishitani K. Tominaga R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21058-21064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Even though κ-carrageenan differs from agarose by the d configuration of the α-linked galactose residues and by the presence of one sulfate substituent at C4 on the β-linked d-galactose residues (Fig. 1), κ-carrageenases and several β-agarases belong to the same structural family, and we proposed that these enzymes derived from a common ancestor with laminarinase activity (8Barbeyron T. Gérard A. Potin P. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). As in other members of this structural family (15Malet C. Jimenez-Barbero J. Bernabe M. Brosa C. Planas A. Biochem. J. 1993; 296: 753-758Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the κ-carrageenase from P. carrageenovora was shown to proceed with an overall retention of the anomeric configuration and to exhibit transglycosylating activity (16Potin P. Richard C. Barbeyron T. Henrissat B. Gey C. Pétillot Y. Forest E. Dideberg O. Rochas C. Kloareg B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 228: 971-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This enzyme was overproduced and crystallized (17Michel G. Barbeyron T. Flament D. Vernet T. Kloareg B. Dideberg O. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 1999; 55: 918-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the resolution of its three-dimensional structure is under way. ι-Carrageenan differs from κ-carrageenan only by the presence of one additional sulfate substituent per repeating disaccharide, at C2 on the α-linked galactose residues (Fig. 1), and one might expect ι-carrageenases to be structurally related to κ-carrageenases. However, despite the potential usefulness of ι-carrageenases in the carrageenan industry and for analyzing the fine structure of carrageenans, this enzyme activity has been purified and investigated in some details only in Alteromonas fortis strain 1 (18Greer C.W. Yaphe W. Can. J. Microbiol. 1984; 30: 1500-1506Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar), and no ι-carrageenase gene has yet been characterized. We previously reported that Z. galactanovorans also displays ι-carrageenase activity (19Potin P. Sanséau A. Le Gall Y. Rochas C. Kloareg B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Here, we describe the purification and biochemical characterization of this activity as well as the functional cloning of ι-carrageenase-encoding genes in both A. fortisstrain 1 and Z. galactanovorans strain Dsij. Both enzymes cleave the β(1→4) linkages of ι-carrageenan and display significant sequence similarity to each other. However, they appear unrelated to the β-agarases and κ-carrageenases described above. Moreover, 1H NMR monitoring of the hydrolysis of ι-carrageenan by recombinant A. fortis ι-carrageenase indicates that, unlike β-agarases and κ-carrageenases, ι-carrageenases are inverting hydrolases. Altogether, they appear as the first representatives of a novel family of glycoside hydrolases. Z. galactanovorans was strain Dsij isolated in our laboratory from the red alga Delesseria sanguinea (19Potin P. Sanséau A. Le Gall Y. Rochas C. Kloareg B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A. fortisstrain 1 (18Greer C.W. Yaphe W. Can. J. Microbiol. 1984; 30: 1500-1506Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC 43554). Marine strains were grown in Zobell medium (20Zobell C.E. J. Mar. Res. 1941; 4: 41-75Google Scholar) at 25 °C. Escherichia coli strain DH5α (recA,endA1, gyrA96, thi1, hsdR17 [rk-mk+], supE44, relA1, lacZΔM15) was grown at 37 °C on Luria Bertani (LB; Ref. 21Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1982: 68Google Scholar) or at 22 °C on Zd medium (Bacto-tryptone 5 g/liter, yeast extract 1 g/liter; NaCl 10 g/liter; pH 7.2) supplemented with 2% (w/v) ι-carrageenan (Mero-Rousselot-Satia, Batch 2855). Ampicillin and tetracyclin were added to solid or liquid media at the concentrations of 50 μg/ml and 15 μg/ml, respectively. -Z. galactanovorans cultures (5 l) were grown, and extracellular proteins were concentrated by tangential ultrafiltration (19Potin P. Sanséau A. Le Gall Y. Rochas C. Kloareg B. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 201: 241-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). ι-Carrageenase activity was assayed as follows. Aliquots (100 μl) were incubated for 15 min at 40 °C with 2 ml of substrate solution consisting of 0.125% (w/v) ι-carrageenan, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 5 mm CaCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and the reaction mixture (200 μl) was assayed for reducing sugars (22Kidby D.K. Davidson D.J. Anal. Biochem. 1973; 55: 321-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) using boiled enzyme as blanks. One unit of enzyme activity (UA)3is defined as the amount of enzyme that produces an increase of 0.1A 237 nm/min in the reducing sugars assay. Concentrated, cell-free culture supernatants were brought to 30% (w/v) ammonium sulfate and stirred for 1 h. After centrifugation (15,000 × g, 10 min), the supernatant was applied to a column of phenyl-Sepharose CL4B (17 × 1.6 cm) previously equilibrated in 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 100 mm NaCl and 30% (w/v) (NH4)2SO4. The column was washed with buffer to remove the unbound material and eluted with a linear decreasing gradient of (NH4)2SO4(30 to 0%, 200 ml) at the flow rate of 0.7 ml/min. Eluates were monitored for absorbance at 280 nm, and fractions (4 ml) were assayed for activity toward κ- and ι-carrageenan. The fractions containing ι-carrageenase activity were pooled and concentrated with a Centriprep-10 concentrator and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (23Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar) using a 5–12.5% discontinuous polyacrylamide gel. Internal peptide sequences were obtained by Edman degradation (Service de Microséquençage, Institut Pasteur, Paris) from the tryptic digest of acrylamide slices containing about 20 μg of purified ι-carrageenase stained with 0.003% Amido Black. The hydrophobic interaction chromatography fractions retained full enzyme activity for at least 12 months when stored at −20 °C in 5% (NH4)2SO4 and 100 mmNaCl. Genomic libraries from Z. galactanovorans and A. fortisand the isolation of ι-carrageenase positive clones were carried out as described previously (7Barbeyron T. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Gene. 1994; 139: 105-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The genomic libraries each contained approximately 6000 clones. Within 1 week of culture at 22 °C on Zd ι-carrageenan broth, five independent colonies from the Z. galactanovorans library, referred to as pIC1–5, as well as two clones from that of A. fortis (pIP1–2) made a hole in the substratum. The inserts from the colonies harboring ι-carrageenase activity were submitted to single and double digestion with various restriction enzymes and mapped by agarose gel electrophoresis. The pIP1 and pIP2 plasmids from A. fortis library harbored inserts of 10.4 and 4.1 kb, respectively, which shared a commonHindIII-XbaI fragment of 3.0 kb. The inserts fromZ. galactanovorans pIC1–5 plasmids ranged in size from 8.0 to 16.4 kb, and they all shared a common PvuII fragment of 3.3 kb. This fragment was sub-cloned into pBluescript KSII phagemid (Stratagene) in both orientations (pICP07 and pICP16). To further localize the ι-carrageenase gene, an ExoIII library was built from pICP07 plasmid using the double-stranded nested deletion kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Two ExoIII clones, referred to as pICP07.4 (1400-bp insert) and pICP07.12 (1800-bp insert), displayed a positive phenotype on Zd broth solidified with ι-carrageenan. Sequencing was carried out using the dideoxy-sequencing method (24Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar) with T7 DNA (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with synthetic oligonucleotide as primers. Hydropathy was analyzed with the Translate program of MacMolly package using the Kyte and Doolittle algorithm (25Kyte J. Doolittle R.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1982; 157: 105-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (17296) Google Scholar). ι-Carrageenase amino acid sequences were aligned using the Gap program (Wisconsin Package, version 8, Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI), with a gap creation penalty of 3.0 and a gap extension penalty of 0.1. Hydrophobic cluster analysis (26Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.-P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar) was performed with the help of the DRAWHCA program (27Callebaut I. Labesse G. Durand P. Poupon A. Canard L. Chomilier J.

The procedure and results of the overexpression of the ι-carrageenase gene fromA. fortis are described in detail elsewhere (39Michel G. Flament D. Barbeyron T. Vernet T. Kloareg B. Dideberg O. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 766-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Briefly, an in-phase insertion into the expression vector pET20b of the coding region of A. fortis ι-carrageenase followed by a polyhistidine tail was constructed by polymerase chain reaction. The polymerase chain reaction-generated products were sequenced to check the construct accuracy, and cultures conditions were then developed for overexpression in the presence of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, resulting in yields of ι-carrageenase activity of ∼75 units ml−1 in the culture medium. Nickel column-purified fractions of the recombinant ι-carrageenase were used to monitor the hydrolysis kinetics of ι-carrageenan (see below). Enzymic hydrolysis of ι-carrageenan was performed as described by Rochas and Heyraud (5Rochas C. Heyraud M. Polym. Bull. 1981; 5: 81-86Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using 0.2 UA/mg of polymer, and the end-products were analyzed by13C NMR (6Rochas C. Potin C. Kloareg B. Carbohydr. Res. 1994; 253: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Briefly, the enzyme-resistant fraction was precipitated with 70% (v/v) isopropanol, and the soluble oligosaccharide fraction was fractionated on Bio-Gel P6 in an Amicon column (95 × 4.4 cm, 25 °C). The eluant was 0.03 mNaNO3, and detection was performed with a Helma ERC 5710 differential refractive index monitor. Hydrolysis kinetics were monitored by carbohydrate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (30Zablackis E. Perez J. Bot. Mar. 1990; 33: 273-276Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) using 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide for the stacking gel, 18% polyacrylamide for the running gel, and 2% piperazine diacrylamide as reticulating agent. Gels were stained in a 0.5% Alcian Blue solution for 30 min, then with silver nitrate. Bio-Gel P6-purified ι-carrageenan oligomers with a known degree of polymerization (DP, expressed as the number of disaccharide repeating units) were used as size markers. Desalted ι-carrageenan (12 mg) was dissolved in 1 ml of 99.95% D2O and freeze-dried. The procedure was repeated three times to replace all the exchangeable protons by deuterium. The resulting polysaccharide was placed in a dry, 5-mm NMR tube.1H spectra were recorded at 25 °C with a Varian Unity Plus 500 spectrometer operating at 500 MHz, equipped with an α′H-X PFG inverse probe and a temperature-controlling unit. Each experiment was run with a sweep width of 1750 Hz and a time domain of 12,416 words, resulting in an acquisition time of 3.547 s. The pulse width was 10.3 ms, and the number of scans was 32. Each free induction decay was zero-filled to 32,768 words before Fourier transformation. A presaturation was done for 1.5 s before the acquisition at the frequency of H2O (−159.8 Hz), with a power of −9 dB. After recording the spectrum of the substrate, 100 μl of recombinant ι-carrageenase from A. fortis (6 mg/ml in 99.95% D2O) were added to the NMR tube, which was immediately placed back in the spectrometer. Proton NMR spectra were recorded every 210 s for 3 h then at 24 h after the addition of the enzyme, i.e. when enzyme hydrolysis was complete and the mutarotation equilibrium was reached. NMR signals were assigned according to Knutsen and Grasdalen (31Knutsen S.H. Grasdalen H. Carbohydr. Res. 1992; 229: 233-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 32Knutsen S.H. Grasdalen H. Carbohydr. Polym. 1994; 19: 199-210Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and based on a COSY (correlation spectroscopy) spectrum of oligo ι-carrageenans (data not shown). The fractionation of Z. galactanovorans culture supernatants by hydrophobic interaction chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose CL4B resolved the ι-carrageenase and κ-carrageenase activities, typically resulting in a 8-fold partial purification of ι-carrageenase with a 16% recovery (TableI). Based on SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig.2 A) and assuming that activities are proportional to the protein band intensities, the ι-carrageenase was likely to correspond to the band with an apparent molecular mass of ∼50 kDa. This assumption was supported by gel permeation chromatography experiments (data not shown), which indicated a molecular mass of about 50 kDa for the native ι-carrageenase. Accordingly, the SDS-PAGE 50-kDa protein band was excised, and internal peptide microsequences were determined by Edman degradation (underlined in Fig. 3).Table IPartial purification of Z. galactanovorans extracellular ι-carrageenasePurification stepsVolumeProteinTotal activitySpecific activityPurificationRecoverymlmgunitsunits/mg%Culture supernatant48001909600159.21100Ultrafiltrate11312.73010237.21.53130% (NH4)2SO4supernatant11812.13005248.41.531Phenyl-Sepharose CL4B421.215201267816 Open table in a new tab Figure 2PAGE analysis of the purification and kinetics of Z. galactanovoransι-carrageenase.

As confirmed by 13C NMR spectroscopy (not shown), the major end products were ι-neocarratetraose sulfate and ι-neocarrahexaose sulfate (Fig. 2 B). The partially purified ι-carrageenase fractions were active neither on purified κ- and λ-carrageenans nor on agar and agarose. Plasmid pICP07.12 was used to determine on both strands the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene of the ι-carrageenase from Z. galactanovorans. The insert, 1837 bp in length, contained a single open reading frame of 1473 bp, referred to as cgiA (Fig. 3). In the 5′ non-coding region, 2 invert-repeated, 26-bp-long sequences are found, possibly corresponding to a hairpin structure with a free energy of −38.5 kJ/mol. Two hexamers, TgGAag and TATAAT, consistent with E. coli −10 and −35 consensus promoters and separated by 17 nucleotides are present 118 nucleotides upstream of the start codon (ATG333). No canonical Shine-Dalgarno sequence can be identified immediately upstream of the initiation codon. However, as already described for the Z. galactanovorans κ-carrageenase gene (8Barbeyron T. Gérard A. Potin P. Henrissat B. Kloareg B. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1998; 15: 528-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), sequences referred to as ε and ω are present both upstream and downstream of ATG codon, which may serve as a ribosome binding site (33Firpo M.A. Dahlberg A.E. McCarthy J.E.G. Tuite M.F. Post-transcriptional Control of Gene Expression. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1990: 185-195Crossref Google Scholar). Using the pIC1 plasmid, 160 bp were further sequenced downstream of the stop codon (TGA1806), unraveling a putative stem loop with a predicted free energy of −109 kJ/mol followed by four thymidine residues that may represent a ρ-independent transcriptional termination site. Interestingly, a second open reading frame, with its start codon (ATG1866) also preceded by ω and ε sequences, began immediately after this putative termination stem loop. The predicted product of Z. galactanovorans ι-carrageenase gene is a protein of 491 amino acids, with a theoretical molecular mass of 53.4 kDa (Fig. 3). It includes the two internal peptides determined by microsequencing of the 50-kDa protein band excised from the SDS gel shown in Fig. 2 A. As indicated by hydropathy analysis (not shown), 12 N-terminal amino acids of the protein stand out as a domain with a high hydrophobicity, suggesting that they belong to a signal peptide (34von Heijne G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1983; 133: 17-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (1606) Google Scholar, 35von Heijne G. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 184: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (1540) Google Scholar, 36von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar). The CgiA N terminus indeed harbors a signature typical of the N termini of prokaryotic, outer membrane lipoproteins, LASIAIMAIGCTK, with a putative cleavage site by signal peptidase II between the Gly19 and Cys20 residues (Prosite PS00013 (37Bairoch A. Bucher P. Hofmann K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 24: 189-196Crossref Scopus (272) Google Scholar)). The computed molecular mass of the resulting mature protein, 51.32 kDa, is similar to the molecular mass of the purified protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE (50 kDa, Fig. 2). The 3.0-kbHindIII-XbaI fragment common to pIP1 and pIP2 plasmids from A. fortis library was subcloned and used to determine on both strands the nucleotide sequence of the structural gene of A. fortis ι-carrageenase (Fig.4). It contained a single open reading frame of 1473 bp. Two hexamers, TTGctt and TATAAa, 41 nt upstream of the start codon (ATG211) and separated by 20 nucleotides, may correspond to −35 and −10 boxes. A typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGAG) is indeed present 7 nt upstream of the initiation codon. Downstream of the stop codon (TAG1684), a hairpin structure with a free energy of −93.6 kJ/mol and followed by 6 T residues, may function as a site for ρ-independent transcriptional termination. The A. fortis cgiA gene is followed by a second, partial open reading frame (ATG1880), itself endowed with putative TTGttA and TATAtT −35 and −10 promoter sequences and with a typical Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGAG). The predicted product of the ι-carrageenase gene from A. fortis is a protein of 491 amino acids, with a theoretical molecular mass of 54.80 kDa (Fig. 4). The N terminus of the protein displays a high hydrophobicity (not shown), characteristic of a signal peptide, with a putative cleavage site between Gly26 and Ala27 (38Nakai K. Kanehisa M. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 95-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the molecular mass of the mature protein is 51.95 kDa, a value similar to the value determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, 57 kDa (18Greer C.W. Yaphe W. Can. J. Microbiol. 1984; 30: 1500-1506Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). A polymerase chain reaction product corresponding to the mature protein was overexpressed in E. coli, using pET20b as expression vector. Yields typically ranged from 60 to 75 UA/ml, allowing for the purification and crystallization of the recombinant ι-carrageenase (39Michel G. Flament D. Barbeyron T. Vernet T. Kloareg B. Dideberg O. Acta Crystallogr. Sec. D. 2000; 56: 766-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The hydrolysis of ι-carrageenan by the overproduced recombinant A. fortisι-carrageenase was monitored using 1H NMR spectroscopy. Compared with the 1H NMR spectrum of ι-carrageenan, the spectra recorded from the reaction mixture, including as early as 7 min after the addition of the enzyme, showed several new resonances (Fig.5). Several of those signals can be assigned to newly formed reducing ends, i.e. those from 3,6-anhydro-α-d-galactopyranose-2-sulfate (A2S R α) and α-d-galactopyranose-4-sulfate (G4S R α) residues. They include, fo"

The sequence of reactions leading to the biogenesis of this complex starts with the formation of the linker unit on a polyprenyl-P to produce polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha (Mikušová, K., Mikuš, M., Besra, G. S., Hancock, I., and Brennan, P. J. (1996) J. Biol. Chem. 271, 7820–7828). We now establish that formation of the galactofuran takes place on this intermediate with UDP-Galf as the Galf donor presented in the form of UDP-Galpand UDP-Galp mutase (the glf gene product) and is catalyzed by galactofuranosyl transferases, one of which, theMycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv3808c gene product, has been identified.

Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its formation has become the focus of the search for essential targets in the development of new drugs against tuberculosis (2Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Curr. Opin. Anti-Inf. Invest. Drugs. 2000; 2: 154-163Google Scholar). Some of the constituents of the widely applied anti-tuberculosis four-drug regimen DOTS (directlyobserved therapy, short course) (isoniazid, ethionamide, and ethambutol) affect mycolic acid or arabinan biosynthesis (3Ramaswamy S. Musser J.M. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1998; 79: 3-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The infrastructure, or core, of the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is composed of a covalently linked complex of mycolic acids, arabinan, and galactan attached to peptidoglycan by a -Rhap(1→3)GlcNAc-P- linker unit (LU)1 (4McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18200-18206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mycolyl-AG-LU-peptidoglycan complex. Most of the primary structure has been elucidated (5Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and new evidence supports the concept of a dynamic, asymmetric, lipid bilayer in which the mycolic acid monolayer, interspersed with porin-like proteins and perpendicular to the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, is complemented by an assortment of phospholipids and glycolipids to provide a relatively impermeable lipid barrier (6Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar).The initial steps in the assembly of the complex have been recently defined (7Mikušová K. Mikuš M. Besra G.S. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Isolated membranes and cell walls from Mycobacterium smegmatis catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P and Rha from their respective nucleotide donors to endogenous polyprenyl-P (probably C50-P), giving rise to polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc (GL-1) and polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha (GL-2), followed by the addition of two successive Galf units, donated by UDP-Galp to give rise to polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Galf (GL-3) and polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-(Galf)2 (GL-4). It has since been shown that UDP-Galp is the direct precursor of UDP-Galf, catalyzed by UDP-Galp mutase (theglf gene product) (8Weston A. Stern R.J. Lee R.E. Nassau P.M. Monsey D. Marin S.L. Scherman M.S. Besra G.S. Duncan K. McNeil M.R. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1998; 78: 123-131Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We now establish that the enzymes responsible for the conversion of UDP-Galp to the Galf-containing GL-3, GL-4, etc. and the polyprenol-P-linked galactan are UDP-Galp mutase and galactofuranosyl transferase(s), one of which, M. tuberculosisH37Rv3808c, was identified. We demonstrate that Araf is also transferred to the polyprenol-P-linked galactan, catalyzed by unidentified membrane-cell wall-associated arabinofuranosyl transferases using either decaprenyl-P-Ara or P-ribosyl-PP as donor. The polyprenyl-P-P LU-galactan-arabinan has been partially characterized in terms of its heterogeneity, size, and linkage, and evidence for the presence of each entity is presented. The work provides the first insights into the complexity of arabinogalactan synthesis in Mycobacterium, which apparently occurs in conjunction with de novo mycolic acid synthesis and mycolyl group transfer and final ligation of the complex to peptidoglycan.DISCUSSIONTo date, the only polyprenyl-P implicated in aspects of mycobacterial cell wall biosynthesis are decaprenyl-P and heptaprenyl-P (27Takayama K. Schnoes H.K. Semmler E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 136: 217-221Google Scholar, 28Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol.

The addition of a cell wall-membrane enzyme preparation and UDP-[14C]Galp to reaction mixtures capable of synthesizing polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc (GL-1) and polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha (GL-2) resulted in the synthesis of Galf-labeled more polar glycolipids, GL-3 and GL-4, indicating stepwise growth of the initial segments of the galactan chain on the polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha unit, 1 Gal unit at a time (7Mikušová K. Mikuš M. Besra G.S. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Present evidence shows that thoroughly washed membrane preparations are not able to synthesize GL-3 and GL-4, which, however, could be achieved by the addition of UDP-Galpmutase encoded by the glf gene (11Ma Y. Mills J.A. Belisle J.T. Vissa V. Howell M. Bowlin K. Scherman M.S. McNeil M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), demonstrating a requirement for UDP-Galf as donor. Moreover, analysis of the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)-soluble lipids in polar solvent demonstrated a hierarchial array of galactolipids, with all of the evidence for polyprenyl-P linkage, again pointing to sequential addition of single Galf units. Calling on the approaches that led to the solubilization of the oligosaccharide-P-P-dolichol intermediates of glycoprotein synthesis (13Rush J.S. Shelling J.G. Zingg N.S. Ray P.H. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13110-13117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to the extraction of phosphosphingolipids from yeast (14Angus W.W. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania donovani (29McNeely T.B. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar), we successfully solubilized the newly synthesized galactofuran. Surprisingly, two distinct populations exist, differentially extracted by the two solvents. As in the case of the dolichyl-bound oligosaccharides, the identification of a polyprenol-P linkage was based on mild acid lability, mild alkali stability, solubility in extremely polar organic solvents, and exclusion from Bio-Gel P-100, all suggesting a highly polymerized lipid-linked version of GL 1–4.De novo synthesis of the lipid-linked polymer is also sensitive to tunicamycin, and evidence is presented for the incorporation of GL-1/GL-2 into the lipid-linked polymer. Glycosyl linkage analysis of the polymer produced t-Galf, 5-linked Galf, 6-linked Galf, and 5,6-linked Galf, indicating that there is substitution of one or more of the linear Galf residues, presumably with arabinan. Moreover, [14C]Araf donated by synthetic C50-P-[14C]Araf, or formed from 5-phospho-[14C]ribosyl-pyrophosphate was incorporated into this same polymer as characterized by solubility in polar lipid solvents, SDS-PAGE mobility, mild acid lability, and hence lipid linkage. The combined evidence points to the pathway shown in Fig.9 for the synthesis of the AG component of the mycolylarabinogalactan complex of mycobacterial cell walls. Clearly, this cell-free system does not allow for significant transfer of the newly synthesized AG from polyprenyl-P-P to peptidoglycan, in that relatively little of the [14C]Gal from UDP-[14C]Gal ends up in the insoluble mycolylarabinogalactan.The search for galactosyl transferases responsible for this galactan AG elongation through comparisons with various families of galactopyranosyl transferases (30Breton C. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) proved to be uninformative. However, analysis of M. tuberculosis Rv3808c, which is linked directly to the glf gene (Rv3809c), showed strong indications of a glycosyl transferase. Alignment of the hydrophobic cluster analysis plot (31Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) of the predicted amino acid sequence ofM. tuberculosis Rv3808c with plots of other known β-glycosyltransferases (26Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed a common domain structure of repeating α-helix and β-strand motifs between amino acids 161 and 262, corresponding to domain A of glycosyltransferases (31Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Within this domain, two aspartic acid residues at 199 and 256 had the hallmarks of highly conserved residues within the C-terminal loops of the β-2 and β-4 strands, the characteristic signature of all β-glycosyltransferases (26Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no evidence of domain B in Rv3808c (and no conserved QXXRW amino acid motif) characteristic of β-glycosyltransferases that add sugars processively to the reducing end of a polysaccharide chain. β-Glycosyltransferases that add sugar residues to the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide chain have only the one domain, A (26Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the synthesis of mycobacterial galactan may share similarities with biosynthesis of the homopolymer O-antigenic d-galactans of E. coliO8 and O9 and Klebsiella pneumoniae O1. In both cases, synthesis is initiated by the transfer of GlcNAc-P to polyprenyl-P (32Whitfield C. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and, during formation of the E. coli O9 antigen, mannosyl residues are rapidly added to the nonreducing terminus of the acceptor one residue at a time, in a processive mechanism (33Lind T. Lindhal U. Lindholt K. J. Biol.

An ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter then translocates polymerized D-galactan I across the plasma membrane prior to ligation to lipid A core (33Lind T. Lindhal U. Lindholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The elucidation of the basic elements of synthesis of the cell wall core of mycobacteria should substantially enhance current tuberculosis drug discovery efforts, in that aspects of cell wall synthesis are the targets of many of the current front-line anti-tuberculosis drugs (2Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Curr. Opin. Anti-Inf. Invest. Drugs. 2000; 2: 154-163Google Scholar), and the pathways and their end products are distinctly xenogeneic. The cell wall of Mycobacterium spp. is required for growth and survival (1Daffé M. Draper P. Adv. Microbiol. Physiol. 1998; 39: 131-203Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and its formation has become the focus of the search for essential targets in the development of new drugs against tuberculosis (2Crick D.C. Brennan P.J. Curr. Opin. Anti-Inf. Invest. Drugs. 2000; 2: 154-163Google Scholar). Some of the constituents of the widely applied anti-tuberculosis four-drug regimen DOTS (directlyobserved therapy, short course) (isoniazid, ethionamide, and ethambutol) affect mycolic acid or arabinan biosynthesis (3Ramaswamy S. Musser J.M. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1998; 79: 3-29Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (925) Google Scholar). The infrastructure, or core, of the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is composed of a covalently linked complex of mycolic acids, arabinan, and galactan attached to peptidoglycan by a -Rhap(1→3)GlcNAc-P- linker unit (LU)1 (4McNeil M. Daffé M. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 18200-18206Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the mycolyl-AG-LU-peptidoglycan complex. Most of the primary structure has been elucidated (5Daffé M. Brennan P.J. McNeil M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6734-6743Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and new evidence supports the concept of a dynamic, asymmetric, lipid bilayer in which the mycolic acid monolayer, interspersed with porin-like proteins and perpendicular to the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex, is complemented by an assortment of phospholipids and glycolipids to provide a relatively impermeable lipid barrier (6Brennan P.J. Nikaido H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 29-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar). The initial steps in the assembly of the complex have been recently defined (7Mikušová K. Mikuš M. Besra G.S. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Isolated membranes and cell walls from Mycobacterium smegmatis catalyze the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P and Rha from their respective nucleotide donors to endogenous polyprenyl-P (probably C50-P), giving rise to polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc (GL-1) and polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha (GL-2), followed by the addition of two successive Galf units, donated by UDP-Galp to give rise to polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-Galf (GL-3) and polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha-(Galf)2 (GL-4). It has since been shown that UDP-Galp is the direct precursor of UDP-Galf, catalyzed by UDP-Galp mutase (theglf gene product) (8Weston A. Stern R.J. Lee R.E. Nassau P.M. Monsey D. Marin S.L. Scherman M.S. Besra G.S. Duncan K. McNeil M.R. Tubercle Lung Dis. 1998; 78: 123-131Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (103) Google Scholar). We now establish that the enzymes responsible for the conversion of UDP-Galp to the Galf-containing GL-3, GL-4, etc. and the polyprenol-P-linked galactan are UDP-Galp mutase and galactofuranosyl transferase(s), one of which, M. tuberculosisH37Rv3808c, was identified. We demonstrate that Araf is also transferred to the polyprenol-P-linked galactan, catalyzed by unidentified membrane-cell wall-associated arabinofuranosyl transferases using either decaprenyl-P-Ara or P-ribosyl-PP as donor. The polyprenyl-P-P LU-galactan-arabinan has been partially characterized in terms of its heterogeneity, size, and linkage, and evidence for the presence of each entity is presented. The work provides the first insights into the complexity of arabinogalactan synthesis in Mycobacterium, which apparently occurs in conjunction with de novo mycolic acid synthesis and mycolyl group transfer and final ligation of the complex to peptidoglycan. DISCUSSIONTo date, the only polyprenyl-P implicated in aspects of mycobacterial cell wall biosynthesis are decaprenyl-P and heptaprenyl-P (27Takayama K. Schnoes H.K. Semmler E.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 136: 217-221Google Scholar, 28Besra G.S. Morehouse C.B. Rittner C.M. Waechter C.J. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 18460-18466Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The addition of a cell wall-membrane enzyme preparation and UDP-[14C]Galp to reaction mixtures capable of synthesizing polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc (GL-1) and polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha (GL-2) resulted in the synthesis of Galf-labeled more polar glycolipids, GL-3 and GL-4, indicating stepwise growth of the initial segments of the galactan chain on the polyprenyl-P-P-GlcNAc-Rha unit, 1 Gal unit at a time (7Mikušová K. Mikuš M. Besra G.S. Hancock I. Brennan P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7820-7828Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Present evidence shows that thoroughly washed membrane preparations are not able to synthesize GL-3 and GL-4, which, however, could be achieved by the addition of UDP-Galpmutase encoded by the glf gene (11Ma Y. Mills J.A. Belisle J.T. Vissa V. Howell M. Bowlin K. Scherman M.S. McNeil M. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 937-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), demonstrating a requirement for UDP-Galf as donor. Moreover, analysis of the CHCl3/CH3OH (2:1)-soluble lipids in polar solvent demonstrated a hierarchial array of galactolipids, with all of the evidence for polyprenyl-P linkage, again pointing to sequential addition of single Galf units. Calling on the approaches that led to the solubilization of the oligosaccharide-P-P-dolichol intermediates of glycoprotein synthesis (13Rush J.S. Shelling J.G. Zingg N.S. Ray P.H. Waechter C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13110-13117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to the extraction of phosphosphingolipids from yeast (14Angus W.W. Lester R.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1972; 151: 483-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the lipophosphoglycan of Leishmania donovani (29McNeely T.B. Turco S.J. J. Immunol. 1990; 144: 2745-2750PubMed Google Scholar), we successfully solubilized the newly synthesized galactofuran. Surprisingly, two distinct populations exist, differentially extracted by the two solvents. As in the case of the dolichyl-bound oligosaccharides, the identification of a polyprenol-P linkage was based on mild acid lability, mild alkali stability, solubility in extremely polar organic solvents, and exclusion from Bio-Gel P-100, all suggesting a highly polymerized lipid-linked version of GL 1–4.De novo synthesis of the lipid-linked polymer is also sensitive to tunicamycin, and evidence is presented for the incorporation of GL-1/GL-2 into the lipid-linked polymer. Glycosyl linkage analysis of the polymer produced t-Galf, 5-linked Galf, 6-linked Galf, and 5,6-linked Galf, indicating that there is substitution of one or more of the linear Galf residues, presumably with arabinan. Moreover, [14C]Araf donated by synthetic C50-P-[14C]Araf, or formed from 5-phospho-[14C]ribosyl-pyrophosphate was incorporated into this same polymer as characterized by solubility in polar lipid solvents, SDS-PAGE mobility, mild acid lability, and hence lipid linkage. The combined evidence points to the pathway shown in Fig.9 for the synthesis of the AG component of the mycolylarabinogalactan complex of mycobacterial cell walls. Clearly, this cell-free system does not allow for significant transfer of the newly synthesized AG from polyprenyl-P-P to peptidoglycan, in that relatively little of the [14C]Gal from UDP-[14C]Gal ends up in the insoluble mycolylarabinogalactan.The search for galactosyl transferases responsible for this galactan AG elongation through comparisons with various families of galactopyranosyl transferases (30Breton C. Bettler E. Joziasse D.H. Geremia R.A. Imberty A. J. Biochem. 1998; 123: 1000-1009Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar) proved to be uninformative. However, analysis of M. tuberculosis Rv3808c, which is linked directly to the glf gene (Rv3809c), showed strong indications of a glycosyl transferase. Alignment of the hydrophobic cluster analysis plot (31Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar) of the predicted amino acid sequence ofM. tuberculosis Rv3808c with plots of other known β-glycosyltransferases (26Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) revealed a common domain structure of repeating α-helix and β-strand motifs between amino acids 161 and 262, corresponding to domain A of glycosyltransferases (31Gaboriaud C. Bissery V. Benchetrit T. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1987; 224: 149-155Crossref PubMed Scopus (541) Google Scholar). Within this domain, two aspartic acid residues at 199 and 256 had the hallmarks of highly conserved residues within the C-terminal loops of the β-2 and β-4 strands, the characteristic signature of all β-glycosyltransferases (26Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). There was no evidence of domain B in Rv3808c (and no conserved QXXRW amino acid motif) characteristic of β-glycosyltransferases that add sugars processively to the reducing end of a polysaccharide chain. β-Glycosyltransferases that add sugar residues to the nonreducing end of the polysaccharide chain have only the one domain, A (26Saxena I.M. Brown Jr., R.M. Fevre M. Geremia R.A. Henrissat B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 1419-1424Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, the synthesis of mycobacterial galactan may share similarities with biosynthesis of the homopolymer O-antigenic d-galactans of E. coliO8 and O9 and Klebsiella pneumoniae O1. In both cases, synthesis is initiated by the transfer of GlcNAc-P to polyprenyl-P (32Whitfield C. Trends Microbiol. 1995; 3: 178-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar), and, during formation of the E. coli O9 antigen, mannosyl residues are rapidly added to the nonreducing terminus of the acceptor one residue at a time, in a processive mechanism (33Lind T. Lindhal U. Lindholt K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20705-20708Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).d-Galactan I from K. pneumoniae is assembled on the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane, and polymerization is thought to occur by sequential sugar transfer on the lipid intermediate.

Moreover, all three members of the p160 family of nuclear receptor coactivators, SRC1, TIF2, and RAC3, are able to potentiate transcription from a TEF response element in transient transfection experiments, and this activation requires the presence of the bHLH-PAS domain.

Nevertheless, its function remains unclear and it seems to be dispensable for the enhancing of the NR transcriptional activity in cotransfection studies (5Onate S.A. Tsai S.Y. Tsai M.J. O'Malley B.W. Science. 1995; 270: 1354-1357Crossref PubMed Scopus (2063) Google Scholar). Therefore, the role of this putative protein dimerization motif in the stabilization of competent coactivator complexes, mediating accessory protein-protein interactions and/or the recruitment of p160 coactivators by other transcription factors remains to be established. To understand the molecular mechanisms of SRC1 functions and identify its associated proteins, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using the bHLH-PAS domain of SRC1 as bait. In this report we present evidence supporting a role for the p160 proteins as coactivators for the transcriptional enhancer factor (TEF) family of transcription factors (22Jacquemin P. Hwang J.J.

A region of SRC1 encoding the bHLH-PAS domain (amino acids 1–361) was cloned in frame 3′ of the DNA binding domain of LexA in pBTM116 to generate a bait fusion protein. A mouse embryo (9.5–12.5 dpc) cDNA library in the pASV3 vector (30Le Douarin B. Pierrat B. vom Baur E. Chambon P. Losson R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 876-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) was used for screening according to the modified protocols described by Hollenberg et al. (31Hollenberg S.M. Sternglanz R. Cheng P.F. Weintraub H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 3813-3822Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar). The bait and the library were sequentially transformed into Saccharomyces cerevisiaestrain L40a using the lithium acetate method. Polypeptides interacting with SRC1 bHLH-PAS domain were detected by the ability to activate transcription of HIS3 and lacZ reporter genes. Colonies able to grow on HIS-deficient medium containing 40 mm 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole were selected and tested for β-galactosidase expression. pASV3 plasmids from His+, LacZ+ colonies were isolated, and cDNA inserts were determined by automated sequencing. The first 528 nucleotides of the partial TEF-4 clone 1.6 were amplified by PCR and32P-labeled using the Multiprime DNA Labeling System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). This probe was used to screen a high density DNA Filter containing a mouse embryo (9 dpc) cDNA library using the protocols provided by the manufacturer (Resource Center/Primary Data Base, Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Heubnerweg 6, Berlin, Germany). The clone MPMGp559M1368Q2 encodes the full-length cDNA of mouse TEF-4, identical to the TEF-4 in the data bases (GenBankTM accession number D50563). The following plasmids have been described previously; pSG5-SRC1e (32Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar), pSG5-SRC1eΔAD1 (33Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1995; 55: 305-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). pSG5-ΔPAS-SRC1e was created by insertion of the fragment SRC1e-(381–1399) into the XbaI and BglII sites of pSG5 (MCS) (32Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). The partial TEF-4 clone 1.6 and the complete open reading frame of the full-length TEF-4 were amplified by PCR and cloned into the EcoRI and XhoI sites of pSG5. GST-SRC1-(1–807) was created by insertion of the relevant fragment into the BglII and SalI sites of pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The first 450 amino acids of SRC1 were inserted into the BamHI and EcoRI sites of pGEX-2TK (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) to generate the GST-SRC1-(1–450) vector. The pRL-EF-1α control reporter vector was created by insertion of the Polypeptide chain elongation factor 1α promoter, amplified using the pEF-BOS vector as template (36Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar), into theBglII and HindIII sites of the pRL-null vector (Promega). The pGL3-MCAT/SV40 luciferase reporter was created by amplifying the multimerized TEF response element present in the M-CAT/SV40cat vector (37Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and subsequent subcloning into theSacI and NheI sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega). The pGL3–2XERE-PS2 luciferase reporter was created by insertion of the 2XERE-PS2 sequence, amplified using the vector 2XERE-PS2-CAT (38Montano M.M. Kraus W.L. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 330-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) as template, into the KpnI andNcoI sites of pGL3-basic vector. All constructs created by PCR amplification with Elongase enzyme mix (Life Technologies, Inc.) were verified by sequencing. Recombinant cDNAs in the pSG5 expression vector were transcribed and translated in vitroin the presence of [35S]methionine in reticulocyte lysate (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. GST fusion proteins were induced, purified, bound to Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and incubated with translated proteins as described previously (32Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 Nonidet P-40, 100 mm NaCl). After extensive washing, the samples were separated on SDS-10% polyacrylamide gels. Gels were fixed and dried, and the35S-labeled proteins were visualized by fluorography. COS-1 and HeLa cells were routinely maintained in E4 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Twenty-four hours before transfection, HeLa cells were plated in 96-well microtitrer plates in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (dextran charcoal-stripped serum when using E2 in the assay). Transfection was performed by a modified calcium phosphate (39Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). The transfected DNA included a pRL-EF-1α control plasmid (0.1 ng), pGL3-MCAT/SV40-luc (20 ng), or pGL3–2XERE-PS2-Luc (10 ng) reporters and either pMT2-MOR (2.5 ng) cotransfected with 10 ng of pSG5-SRC1 or pSG5-ΔPAS-SRC1e or 30 ng of expression vector encoding the wild type or deletion mutants of the p160s as indicated in the legend to Fig. 3. Empty vectors were used to normalize the amounts of DNA. After incubation for 16 h, the cells were washed and incubated in fresh medium for reporter assays after 24 h. The reporter firefly luciferase activity was measured using the LucLiteTM kit (Packard), subsequently theRenilla luciferase activity used as internal control was determined by the addition of EDTA (8 mm final concentration) and Coelenterazine substrate (4.7 μm (250 ng/well)) (Calbiochem) to the firefly luciferase reaction. The Renilla luciferase activity was used to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. For the immunoblotting analysis, SRC1e and ΔPAS-SRC1e were overexpressed in COS-1 cells using electroporation as described earlier (32Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Whole cell extracts from COS-1 cells overexpressing SRC1e or ΔPAS-SRC1e were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked in TBS-T (20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat milk powder, washed with TBS-T, and incubated for 1 h with goat polyclonal IgG SRC1 (M-20) raised against mouse SRC1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.). After being washed, the membranes were incubated with rabbit anti-goat IgG (Dako) and washed again with TBS-T. The bound immunoglobulins were visualized using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We used a yeast two-hybrid system to identify mouse cDNAs encoding proteins that interact with the N-terminal region of SRC1, comprising the highly conserved bHLH-PAS domain (amino acids 1–361, Fig. 1 A). Yeast transformants containing the LexA-DBD fused to the bHLH-PAS domain, and mouse proteins fused to the VP16 activation domain were selected according to their ability to grow in a medium lacking histidine. The positive transformants were identified and tested for β-galactosidase activity. Sequence analysis revealed that one clone (1.6) encoded a truncated TEF-4 protein, with the N-terminal region (amino acids 37–176) fused to the C-terminal region (amino acids 401–445), when compared with the published sequence (40Yasunami M. Suzuki K. Houtani T. Sugimoto T. Ohkubo H. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18649-18654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). To test the specificity of the interaction, the plasmid expressing the truncated TEF-4 fused to the VP16 AD, or the isolated VP16 AD, were re-transformed into yeast expressing the LexA-DBD fused to the bHLH-PAS domain or the isolated LexA-DBD. The interactions were studied by determining the levels of lacZ reporter expression in yeast extracts using β-galactosidase assays (Fig. 1 B). We found a background activity indicating a weak interaction between the bHLH-PAS domain and the VP16 AD, but the presence of the TEF-4 polypeptide increased this activity 8-fold, indicating that the N-terminal region of SRC-1 and the TEF-4 clone 1.6 are able to interactin vivo. The polypeptide encoded by the clone 1.6 lacks the N-terminal part of TEF-4 (amino acids 1–36) and also has an internal deletion of the region 177–401. This internal deletion raises the possibility that the TEF-4 pre-mRNA might undergo alternative splicing. To investigate this possibility we screened a mouse embryo cDNA library with the partial TEF-4 clone as a probe and found 18 clones encoding partial or full-length TEF-4. However, in all cases, the cDNA sequences were identical to that described previously, suggesting that alternatively spliced variants rarely if ever occur. We next investigated whether the in vivo interaction between SRC1 and TEF-4 that we observed in yeast was also detectable in vitro, using GST pull-down assays. The truncated TEF-4 encoded by the clone 1.6 bound to the N-terminal region of SRC1-(1–807) fused to GST (Fig. 2 A), in agreement with the in vivo interaction between SRC1 and the clone 1.6. This in vitro interaction was characterized in more detail using the bHLH-PAS domain alone (region 1–450), and the full-length TEF-4 protein, and we found that they were able to interact (Fig.2 B). Another member of the TEF family of transcription factors, TEF1-A (34Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), also was able to bind to SRC1 in the same assay (Fig. 2 B), indicating that the interaction is not restricted to a single member of the TEF family. SRC1, TIF2, and RAC3 are well established coactivators that are recruited to the ligand activated NRs, enhancing their transcriptional activity (3McKenna N.J. Lanz R.B. O'Malley B.W. Endocr. Rev. 1999; 20: 321-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1658) Google Scholar, 4Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 121-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Having demonstrated a physical interaction between TEF transcription factors and SRC1 both in vivo and in vitro, we investigated whether SRC1 was able to potentiate transcriptional activation from a TEF response element in transiently transfected cells. Using the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL3-MCAT/SV40 (37Larkin S.B. Farrance I.K. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 3742-3755Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) we found that the expression of full-length SRC1e consistently showed 2–3-fold induction of the MCAT/SV40 luciferase reporter (Fig.3 A). When we cotransfected a truncated SRC1e deletion mutant, lacking the bHLH-PAS domain, the ability of SRC1e to activate the transcription from the TEF response element was completely abolished (Fig. 3 A). This lack of activation cannot be explained by a lower expression of the SRC1 deletion mutant, as immunoblot analysis of transfected cell extracts using an anti-SRC1 antibody showed that the SRC1 mutant is efficiently expressed (Fig. 3 B). Moreover, this SRC1 deletion mutant is able to potentiate the transcriptional activity mediated by the estrogen receptor α in a similar transient transfection experiment using the 2XERE-PS2 luciferase reporter (Fig.3 C), showing that the mutant is able to go to the nucleus and interact with its downstream effectors. When the empty pGL3-basic, lacking the TEF binding elements, was used in the transient transfection assay, SRC1 showed no activation of the luciferase reporter gene (Fig. 3 D), indicating that the effect was specific of the sequences in the TEF artificial promoter. Overexpression of either full-length TEF-4 or TEF-1A repressed the activity of the TEF response element as has been reported previously in a variety of cell lines (34Xiao J.H. Davidson I. Matthes H. Garnier J.M. Chambon P. Cell. 1991; 65: 551-568Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 41Ishiji T. Lace M.J. Parkkinen S. Anderson R.D. Haugen T.H. Cripe T.P. Xiao J.H. Davidson I.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9510-9518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), and this repression was not relieved by the cotransfection of SRC1 (data not shown). SRC1 contains at least two activation domains, AD1 and AD2 (6Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 32Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1 A). AD1 has been demonstrated to recruit the general coactivator CBP/p300, and this domain is required for the transcriptional activation by the NRs (6Voegel J.J. Heine M.J. Zechel C. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3667-3675Crossref PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar, 32Kalkhoven E. Valentine J.E. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 232-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar, 33Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). To test whether AD1 was also required for the potentiation of the TEF promoter, we cotransfected an expression vector encoding a SRC1e mutant with an internal deletion of that region (Δ900–950). Interestingly, that deletion did not affect SRC1 potentiation from TEF response element (Fig. 3 D). The other two members of the p160 family, TIF2 and RAC3, were also able to potentiate the pGL3-MCAT/SV40 reporter in the transient transfection assay, and this activation was even greater than that observed with SRC1 (Fig. 3 D). The TEF family of transcription factors is characterized by a conserved DNA binding domain, TEA/ATTS (44Burglin T.R. Cell. 1991; 66: 11-12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), which recognizes severalcis-regulatory motifs like SphI, GT-IIC, and M-CAT (23Farrance I.K. Mar J.H. Ordahl C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17234-17240Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mechanism of their action appears to be complex and likely to require interactions with specific coactivators. Several proteins have been shown to interact with TEF proteins and enhance their transcriptional activity, these include the bHLH protein Max (45Gupta M.P. Amin C.S. Gupta M. Hay N. Zak R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 3924-3936Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the Drosophila protein Vestigial (46Bray S. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: R245-R247Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), the human functional homologous TONDU (47Vaudin P. Delanoue R. Davidson I. Silber J. Zider A. Development (Camb. ). 1999; 126: 4807-4816Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the chromatin-modifying protein PARP (48Butler A.J. Ordahl C.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 296-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). In this report we demonstrate that a member of the p160 family of transcriptional coactivators, SRC1, is able to interact physicallyin vivo and in vitro with a TEF transcription factor, TEF-4, using the predicted bHLH-PAS protein dimerization motif present in its N-terminal end. Moreover, SRC1 is able to enhance the transcriptional activation from a TEF response element in transient transfection experiments, and this activation requires the presence of the bHLH-PAS domain. We speculate that this activation occurred through the interaction of SRC1 with endogenous TEF proteins present in the HeLa cells. Another TEF transcription factor tested, TEF-1A, was also able to bind directly to the SRC-1 bHLH-PAS domain, suggesting a general role of SRC1 as a coactivator for members of the TEF family. This possibility has already been suggested, based on the fact that SRC1 is able to enhance in transient transfection experiments the SV40 viral promoter, which contains multiple TEF binding sites (49Ikeda M. Kawaguchi A. Takeshita A. Chin W.W. Endo T. Onaya T. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1999; 147: 103-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). TIF2 and RAC3 were also able to potentiate the TEF response element, indicating that the highly conserved bHLH-PAS domain may play a similar role for all the p160 proteins in the recruitment of these coactivators to the TEF family of transcription factors. The typical repression observed when exogenous TEF proteins were overexpressed was not relieved by cotransfected SRC1, suggesting that other factors than the p160 coactivators are also limiting for TEF transcriptional activity. Repression through direct interaction between TEF proteins and the TATA-binding protein could explain that result, as has been reported for several promoters (43Jiang S.W. Eberhardt N.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9510-9518Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The SRC1 bHLH-PAS domain is absolutely required for enhancing the TEF reporter; in contrast, it is dispensable for potentiation of transcription by NRs. In the case of the estrogen response element the deletion mutant ΔPAS-SRC1 was an even better coactivator than the full-length protein. This could be explained in terms of competition for a limiting pool of coactivators, shared between the NRs, which interact with the p160 proteins via leucine motifs (15Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 733-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (1778) Google Scholar, 16Torchia J. Rose D.W. Inostroza J. Kamei Y. Westin S. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1997; 387: 677-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) and other transcription factors that would recruit the p160 coactivators via the bHLH-PAS domains. Recently it has been shown that GRIP-1, the murine homologous of TIF2, uses its bHLH-PAS domain to interact with another transcription factor involved in skeletal muscle differentiation, MEF-2C (14Chen S.L. Dowhan D.H. Hosking B.M. Muscat G.E. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 1209-1228Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results give additional evidence to the role of the bHLH-PAS domain as a protein-interacting motif used to recruit the p160 proteins to different transcription factors. The potentiation of the NRs transcriptional activity by the p160 proteins requires the recruitment of CBP. For example, deletion of the CBP-interacting domain in SRC1e (residues 900–950) completely abolished its enhancement of the androgen receptor transcriptional activity (33Bevan C.L. Hoare S. Claessens F. Heery D.M. Parker M.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 8383-8392Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar), but the same mutant was still able to potentiate the TEF reporter, indicating that SRC1 must use alternative mechanisms to activate the TEF-dependent transcription. It is conceivable that the recruitment of protein methyltrasferases via the C-terminal activation domain 2 (19Chen D. Ma H. Hong H. Koh S.S. Huang S.M. Schurter B.T. Aswad D.W. Stallcup M.R. Science. 1999; 284: 2174-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (1006) Google Scholar), or its intrinsic histone acetyltransferase activity (50Spencer T.E. Jenster G. Burcin M.M. Allis C.D. Zhou J. Mizzen C.A.

On the other hand, Cdc2 (Cdk1), Cdk2, Cdk4, and Cdk6 control cell cycle progression in higher eukaryotes. Full activation of CDKs, which is necessary for normal cell cycle progression, requires binding of a cyclin, removal of inhibitory phosphorylations, and the presence of an activating phosphorylation. The cyclins are transcribed, synthesized, and degraded periodically during the cell cycle (1Pines J. Biochem. J. 1995; 308: 697-711Crossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 4King R.W.

The inhibitory phosphorylations are carried out by the Wee1-like protein kinases, and removed by members of the Cdc25 family of dual specificity protein phosphatases (for reviews, see Refs. 6Morgan D.O.

Higher eukaryotic CAK, primarily localized to the nucleus, is composed of p40MO15/Cdk7, cyclin H, and an assembly factor, MAT1. These proteins also function as components of basal transcription factor IIH (17Feaver W.J. Svejstrup J.Q. Henry N.L. Kornberg R.D.

In contrast to CAK in higher eukaryotes, CAK from budding yeast (Cak1p or Civ1p) is only distantly related to p40MO15 (22Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Morgan D.O.

Wagner M. Winter E. Solomon M.J. J. Cell Sci. 1998; 111: 3585-3596PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the large body of knowledge on CAK, there is relatively little information about the protein phosphatases that reverse the activating phosphorylation of the CDKs. A dual-specificity human protein phosphatase termed KAP (also Cdi1 and Cip2), which was identified by its interaction with Cdc2, Cdk2, and Cdk3 (26Gyuris J. Golemis E. Chertkov H. Brent R. Cell. 1993; 75: 791-803Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1322) Google Scholar, 27Hannon G.J. Casso D. Beach D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell. 1993; 75: 805-816Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5230) Google Scholar), was shown to dephosphorylate Thr160 on Cdk2 (29Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). However, there is no obvious KAP homologue in budding yeast. We found recently that two budding yeast type 2C protein phosphatases (PP2Cs), Ptc2p and Ptc3p, are the predominant and physiological enzymes that dephosphorylate Thr169 on the Cdc28p cyclin-dependent kinase (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We also observed that PP2C-like activities were responsible for >99% of the phosphatase activity in HeLa cell extracts acting on Thr160 of Cdk2, indicating that the ability of type 2C protein phosphatases to remove the activating phosphorylation of CDKs is evolutionarily conserved (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Ser/Thr protein phosphatases (PPases) are classified into the PP1, PP2A, PP2B, and PP2C families based on their biochemical properties: PP1 and PP2A have no ion requirements and are sensitive to okadaic acid and microcystins; PP2B requires Ca2+ for full activity; and PP2C requires Mg2+ or Mn2+ (31Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning revealed that PP1, PP2A, and PP2B families share homology to each other whereas the PP2C family is structurally distinct (32Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). In addition to their catalytic subunits, the PP1, PP2A, and PP2B holoenzymes also contain one or two regulatory subunits that appear to determine the substrate specificities of these phosphatases (31Cohen P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 453-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (2151) Google Scholar). Unlike PP1, PP2A, and PP2B, PP2C acts as a monomer. Thus, for PP2C, substrate specificity may result from the many PP2C family members, rather than from multiple regulatory subunits. In budding yeast, there are at least five PP2Cs (Ptc1p-Ptc5p) (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 33Stark M.J.R. Yeast. 1996; 12: 1647-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). The mammalian PP2C family includes PP2Cα, PP2Cβ, PP2Cγ (also called FIN13), PP2Cδ, Wip1, Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II phosphatase, and NERPP-2C (34Tamura S. Lynch K.R. Larner J. Fox J.

In addition, human PP2Cα has two isoforms resulting from alternative splicing (44Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), and murine PP2Cβ has five isoforms (for comparison, see Ref. 45Kusuda K. Kobayashi T. Ikeda S. Ohnishi M. Chida N. Yanagawa Y. Shineha R. Nishihira T. Satomi S. Hiraga A. Tamura S. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this study, we further characterized the PP2C activities capable of dephosphorylating human Cdk2 and Cdk6 in a HeLa cell extract. Fractionation of proteins by DEAE-Sepharose, Superdex-200, and Mono Q chromatographies demonstrated that Cdk2 and Cdk6 phosphatase activities co-purified with PP2Cα, a previously reported PP2C isoform, and PP2Cβ2, a novel human PP2Cβ isoform apparently resulting from alternative splicing. Recombinant PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 effectively dephosphorylated monomeric- but not cyclin-bound Cdk2 and Cdk6 in vitro, confirming previous studies with yeast PP2Cs and human Cdk2 in a HeLa cell extract (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Further enzymatic characterization showed that crude HeLa cell extract, partially purified PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2, and recombinant PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 all exhibited a substrate preference for wild-type (Thr160) Cdk2 compared with a mutant Cdk2 protein containing an altered site of activating phosphorylation (Ser160). These results support the conclusion that PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 are the PP2C isoforms that dephosphorylate human CDKsin vivo. Tissue culture medium, TRIzol, and SUPERSCRIPT II RNase H− reverse transcriptase were from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, Superdex-200, and Mono Q HR5/5 were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. An antibody recognizing PP2Cα and PP2Cβ isoforms (catalog number 539548) was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA). Sheep anti-PP2Cα antibodies (catalog number 06-523) were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences.

All other chemicals were from Sigma unless indicated otherwise. 1 × protease inhibitors contained 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin, chymostatin, and pepstatin. HeLa S3 cells were lysed with a Dounce homogenizer in hypotonic buffer (10 mmHepes, pH 7.9 (at 4 °C), 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 × protease inhibitors) and clarified by centrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h in a 60-Ti rotor (46Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4213-4221Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use. Clarified extract (25 ml, protein concentration 6.3 mg/ml) was applied to a DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow column (1.5 × 10 cm) pre-equilibrated with buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1 mmEDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.01% Chaps, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 × protease inhibitors) at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. The column was washed with buffer A until the absorbance of the elute at 280 nm was <0.05. Bound proteins were eluted with a 20-ml linear gradient from 0 to 1.0 m NaCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected, and Cdk2/Cdk6 phosphatase activities in the fractions were assayed (see below). The active fractions were pooled, concentrated using a Vivaspin concentrator (10,000 MWCO; Vivascience LTD., Binbrook Hill, United Kingdom), and loaded onto a Superdex-200 column pre-equilibrated with buffer B (20 mmtriethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.0 (at 25 °C), 5% glycerol, 0.01% Chaps, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm EGTA, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol, 1 × protease inhibitors) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. One-ml fractions were collected, and Cdk2/Cdk6 phosphatase activities in the fractions were assayed (see below). The active fractions (∼45-kDa) were pooled, loaded onto a Mono Q HR5/5 column pre-equilibrated with buffer B, and developed with a linear salt gradient from 0 to 700 mm NaCl in buffer B at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min as described (47McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). 0.5-ml fractions were collected, assayed for activity, and immunoblotted (see below). To identify novel PP2Cβ isoforms, a BLASTN search of a human EST data base was performed using the last 420 nucleotides in the 3′-coding region of human PP2Cβ as the query. In addition to PP2Cβ, a second group of EST clones was found that only matched the first ∼120 nucleotides of the query, indicating that they encode a novel PP2Cβ isoform, which was named PP2Cβ2. Total RNA was isolated from HeLa cells with TRIzol reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. The full-length coding regions of human PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 isoforms were amplified from total RNA by RT-PCR with the following primers (start and stop codons are underlined): PP2Cα: 5′-CCCCATATGGGAGCATTTTTAGACAAG-3′ and 5′-CCCCAAGCTTTTACCACATATCATCTGTTG-3′; PP2Cβ2: 5′-GCCCCATGGGTGCATTTTTGGATAAACC-3′ and 5′-CGGGCTCGAGCTACCATGGGTCTTCTAGATC-3′. PCR fragments were inserted into pBlueScript II KS(−) and sequenced. For PP2Cβ2, a second COOH-terminal primer was used to eliminate an internalNcoI site before the stop codon without changing the amino acid residue. To express non-tagged proteins, the full-length coding regions of PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 were inserted into the NdeI/HindIII sites of pET21a and into the NcoI/XhoI sites of pET21d, respectively. For the expression of hexahistidine-tagged (His6) enzymes, PP2Cα (with its stop codon) was amplified by PCR and inserted into the BamHI-HindIII sites of pET28a, which resulted in an NH2-terminal hexahistidine-tagged fusion protein. PP2Cβ2 (without its stop codon) was amplified by PCR and inserted into theNcoI-XhoI sites of pET21d to produce a COOH-terminal hexahistidine-tagged protein. For expression of NH2-terminal His6-fused PP2Cα1–308 (PP2CαΔC) and COOH-terminal His6-tagged PP2Cβ21–312 (PP2Cβ2ΔC), the following COOH-terminal primers were used: PP2Cα1–308, 5′-CCCCAAGCTTTTACAACTCTGCCTCCTTCTCAC-3′ and PP2Cβ1–312, 5′-CCCCTCGAGCAACTCTGAATCTTTTTTCAC-3′. PP2CαΔC and PP2Cβ2ΔC were amplified by PCR and inserted into pET28a and pET21d, respectively. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. GST-Cdk2, GST-Cdk2Ser-160, and His6-tagged PP2Cα, PP2Cβ2, PP2CαΔC, and PP2Cβ2ΔC were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified as described (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). PP2Cγ was expressed in BL21(DE3) cells containing pET19b-PP2Cγ (provided by M. V. Murray and A. R. Krainer) and purified as described (39Murray M.V. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The GST-Wip1 plasmid was provided by E. Appella and GST-Wip1 was expressed in E. coli and purified as described (41Fiscella M. Zhang H. Fan S. Sakaguchi K. Shen S. Mercer W.E. Vande Woude G.F. O'Connor P.M. Apella E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Cdk2, GST-Cdk2, GST-Cdk6, and GST-Cdk2Ser-160 were phosphorylated by GST-Cak1p in the presence of [γ-32P]ATP as described (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). GST-Cdk2Thr-160 and GST-Cdk2Ser-160 were labeled by Cak1p to comparable and nearly saturated levels. The CDK phosphatase activity and casein phosphatase activity were determined as described (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 47McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Methods Enzymol. 1988; 159: 416-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). The protein phosphatase activities of HeLa cell lysate and recombinant PP2Cs were assayed in the presence of 5 and 20 mm MgCl2, respectively. Briefly, 5 μl of each fraction was incubated with 50 ng of 32P-labeled CDKs in a 20-μl reaction for 15 min at room temperature. Reactions were terminated by addition of 10 μl of 3 × sample buffer, separated by 10% SDS-PAGE, and analyzed by autoradiography and PhosphorImager (Molecular Imager GS-250, Bio-Rad). Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE (10% total acrylamide) and transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore) with a semi-dry blotting apparatus (TransBlot-SD, Bio-Rad). After blocking at room temperature for 2 h in Blotto (1 × TBST containing 5% nonfat dry milk), the membranes were incubated with anti-PP2C polyclonal antibody (1 μg/ml in Blotto) overnight at 4 °C followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody or rabbit anti-sheep secondary antibody (Pierce, 1:2000 dilution in Blotto) at room temperature for 2 h. Antibodies were detected with SuperSignal ECL reagents (Pierce). We previously found that PP2Cs are responsible for the vast majority (>99%) of phosphatase activity toward Thr160 of Cdk2 in a HeLa cell extract (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The activity required Mg2+ and was insensitive to okadaic acid or sodium vanadate. To identify the responsible phosphatase(s), we fractionated a HeLa cell lysate on DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow, Superdex-200, and Mono-Q columns and assayed fractions for their abilities to dephosphorylate Cdk2 phosphorylated on Thr-160 (Fig. 1) and Cdk6 phosphorylated on Thr177 (data not show). The Cdk2 and Cdk6 phosphatase activities were present in the same fractions and showed only a single sharp peak in the first two columns. Mono-Q chromatography, however, showed a broader distribution of Cdk2/Cdk6 phosphatase activity (Fig. 1D), suggesting the presence of more than one CDK phosphatase. PP2Cα and PP2Cβ isoforms are the mammalian PP2Cs most closely related to Ptc2p and Ptc3p, the budding yeast phosphatases responsible for dephosphorylating Thr169 of Cdc28p. We speculated that the CDK phosphatases in HeLa cells might be PP2Cα and/or PP2Cβ isoforms. This suggestion was supported by the observation that overexpression of human PP2Cα in yeast led to synthetic lethality incak1–22 ts cells at a semi-permissive temperature. 2A. Cheng and M. J. Solomon, unpublished data. We determined whether the active Mono Q fractions contained PP2Cα and/or PP2Cβ proteins by immunoblotting. 0.5-ml fractions were collected to provide higher resolution than in Fig. 1 D. Affinity purified antibodies that specifically recognize both PP2Cα and β detected two proteins in a HeLa cell lysate (Fig.2 B). Their sizes of about 45 and 42 kDa were similar to the calculated molecular mass of PP2Cα (∼42-kDa). Immunoblotting of Mono-Q fractions showed that the 45- and 42-kDa PP2Cα/βs co-purified with the Cdk2/Cdk6 phosphatase activities (Fig. 2, A and B). The total amounts of these isoforms correlated well with Cdk2/Cdk6 phosphatase activity, suggesting that they were likely candidates for the CDK phosphatases in HeLa cells. The elution profiles of the 45- and 42-kDa PP2Cα/βs on Mono Q chromatography were similar to those of the previously described rabbit PP2C1 and PP2C2 isoenzymes, respectively (48McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 166: 713-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In addition, the 45- and 42-kDa PP2Cα/β isoforms were partially separable by Mono-Q chromatography (Fig. 2 B): fractions 30 and 31 contained only the 45-kDa PP2Cα/β and factions 34 and 35 contained almost exclusively the 42-kDa PP2Cα/β. Since the CDK phosphatase activity in fraction 34 was similar to that in fraction 30 (Fig. 2 A), it appears that both the 45- and 42-kDa PP2Cα/β proteins are capable of dephosphorylating Cdk2 and Cdk6. We identified the 45- and 42-kDa PP2C isoforms using a combination of immunoblotting and molecular cloning. An antibody specific for PP2Cα isoforms recognized the 45-kDa PP2C but not the 42-kDa PP2C (Fig. 2 C), indicating that the 45-kDa protein is a PP2Cα isoform and that the 42-kDa protein is a PP2Cβ isoform. Moreover, both the 45-kDa PP2Cα isoform and recombinant PP2Cα exhibited the same mobility in SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 D, lanes 1and 2), indicating that the 45-kDa PP2C was likely the previously reported human PP2Cα. In contrast, the 42-kDa PP2Cβ isoform was much smaller than the previously reported human PP2Cβ, which has 479 amino acid residues and an apparent molecular mass of ∼55-kDa in SDS-PAGE (49Marley A.E. Kline A. Crabtree G. Sullivan J.E. Beri R.K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 431: 121-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Instead, the size of the 42-kDa PP2Cβ isoform was similar to those of reported PP2Cβs from rabbit, mouse, and rat (34Tamura S. Lynch K.R. Larner J. Fox J. Yasui A. Kikuchi K. Suzuki Y. Tsuiki S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 35Mann D.J. Campbell D.G. McGowan C.H. Cohen P.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1130: 100-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 36Wenk J. Trompeter H.I. Pettrich K.G. Cohen P.T. Campbell D.G. Mieskes G. FEBS Lett. 1992; 297: 135-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). We speculated that the 42-kDa PP2Cβ might be an unreported human ortholog of PP2Cβs in these other mammals. By searching an EST data base, we identified and cloned a novel human PP2Cβ isoform (“PP2Cβ2”) from HeLa cells by RT-PCR. The encoded protein is predicted to be 387 amino acids, compared with 479 amino acids for human PP2Cβ and 390 amino acids for mouse and rat PP2Cβ. Since the first 1134 nucleotides (378 amino acids) in the human PP2Cβ and PP2Cβ2 coding regions were identical, PP2Cβ and PP2Cβ2 appear to arise via alternative splicing. Human PP2Cβ2 showed ∼95% identity to mouse and rat PP2Cβs (Fig.3). Recombinant human PP2Cβ2 exhibited the same mobility as the 42-kDa PP2C on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2 D, lanes 3 and 4), suggesting that the 42-kDa HeLa PP2C is PP2Cβ2. Interestingly, the mobility of PP2Cα was less than that of PP2Cβ2 on SDS-PAGE even though PP2Cα (382 aa) is slightly smaller than PP2Cβ2 (387 amino acids). We next determined whether recombinant human PP2Cs could dephosphorylate human Cdk2 and Cdk6 in vitro. PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 were expressed in E. coli and purified as NH2-terminal and COOH-terminal hexahistidine-tagged (His6) proteins, respectively. His6-PP2Cγ was expressed and purified from BL21(DE3) cells bearing pET19b-PP2Cγ as described (39Murray M.V. Kobayashi R. Krainer A.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Since the COOH-terminal portions of PP2Cs may regulate substrate specificity (45Kusuda K. Kobayashi T. Ikeda S. Ohnishi M. Chida N. Yanagawa Y. Shineha R. Nishihira T. Satomi S. Hiraga A. Tamura S. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), we also prepared His6-tagged COOH-terminal deletions of these proteins, PP2CαΔC (PP2Cα1–308) and PP2Cβ2ΔC (PP2Cβ21–312), which only contained the minimal regions necessary for activity (45Kusuda K. Kobayashi T. Ikeda S. Ohnishi M. Chida N. Yanagawa Y. Shineha R. Nishihira T. Satomi S. Hiraga A. Tamura S. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 243-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 50Marley A.E.

The casein phosphatase activities of recombinant PP2Cα, PP2Cβ2, PP2CαΔC, and PP2Cβ2ΔC were comparable to each other and ranged from 91 to 109 milliunits/mg in the presence of 20 mm Mg2+ (Fig.4 A). Under the same conditions, the casein phosphatase activity of recombinant PP2Cγ was about 40 milliunits/mg. As shown in Fig. 4 B, PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 effectively dephosphorylated Cdk2, as did the COOH-terminal truncated PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 enzymes. The activities of recombinant human PP2Cβ against Cdk2 and casein were also similar to those of PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2. 3A. Cheng and M. J. Solomon, unpublished results. In contrast, PP2Cγ had very low activity toward Cdk2. We estimated from the linear phases of these reactions (when less than 30% of the substrate was used) that recombinant PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 were at least 40-fold more active toward Cdk2 than recombinant PP2Cγ. Similar results were obtained with PP2Cα, PP2Cβ2, and PP2Cγ using GST-Cdk6 as the substrate (Fig. 4 C). Wip1, a p53-induced type 2C protein phosphatase, was incapable of dephosphorylating Cdk2 (data not shown). PP2Cα has been observed to show a 20-fold preference for a phosphothreonine peptide substrate compared with an equivalent phosphoserine substratein vitro (51Donella Deana A. McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Marciori F. Meyer H.E. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), leading to the suggestion that PP2C substrates are generally phosphorylated on threonine residues (32Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). We, therefore, compared the abilities of PP2Cs to dephosphorylate wild-type Cdk2Thr-160 and mutant Cdk2Ser-160. We previously showed that a HeLa cell extract dephosphorylated Cdk2Thr-160 about 4 times as fast as Cdk2Ser-160 (52Kaldis P. Cheng A. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 32578-32584Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fig.5 A confirms this preference. Fig. 5 B shows that the partially purified HeLa PP2Cs (Mono-Q fractions 31 and 34) exhibited the same qualitative preference for Cdk2Thr-160. To quantitate this effect, we used recombinant PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 and performed assays within the linear range (when less than 30% of the substrate was dephosphorylated). This analysis showed that PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 have 3- and 2.7-fold preferences for Cdk2Thr-160 over Cdk2Ser-160 (Fig. 5 C), confirming the qualitative observations with the native enzymes (Fig.5 B). Since the binding of cyclins to CDKs blocked the dephosphorylation of yeast Cdc28p and human Cdk2 by Ptc2p, Ptc3p, and KAP (29Poon R.Y.C. Hunter T. Science. 1995; 270: 90-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we tested whether the binding of cyclin could also inhibit the dephosphorylation of Cdk2 and Cdk6 by human PP2C isoforms. Preincubation of Cdk2 with excess GST-cyclin A blocked the dephosphorylation of Cdk2 by PP2Cα, PP2Cβ2, PP2CαΔC, and PP2Cβ2ΔC (Fig. 6 A). Similarly, the dephosphorylation of GST-Cdk6 by PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 was blocked by the binding of a viral D-type cyclin, KSHV-cyclin (Fig.6 B). In contrast, these cyclins had no effects on the casein phosphatase activities of PP2Cα, PP2Cβ2, PP2Cγ, PP2CαΔC, and PP2Cβ2ΔC (Fig. 6 C), indicating that cyclins did not inhibit PP2C activity directly. We previously reported that two yeast PP2Cs, Ptc2p and Ptc3p, are the major physiological protein phosphatases for the Cdc28p cyclin-dependent kinase in budding yeast and that PP2C-like activity was also responsible for >99% of the Cdk2 phosphatase activity in a HeLa cell extract (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). We now provide evidence that the PP2C-like activities in HeLa cell extract are due to PP2Cβ2, a novel PP2Cβ isoform, and to PP2Cα. PP2Cα/β-specific antibodies detected two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 45- and 42-kDa in HeLa cell lysate. Mg2+-dependent Cdk2 and Cdk6 phosphatase activity co-purified with 45- and 42-kDa PP2Cα/β isoforms during chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose, Superdex-200, and Mono-Q columns. The 45-kDa PP2C was also recognized by a PP2Cα-specific antibody and had the same electrophoretic mobility as recombinant PP2Cα. The 42-kDa PP2Cα/β did not react with the PP2Cα-specific antibody and exhibited the same electrophoretic mobility as a novel PP2Cβ isoform (PP2Cβ2). PP2Cβ2 possesses 387 amino acid residues and shows ∼95% identity to PP2Cβ's from mouse, rat, and rabbit. We found that recombinant PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 efficiently dephosphorylated monomeric Cdk2 and Cdk6 in vitro but that two other PP2C isoforms, PP2Cγ and Wip1, did not. Further biochemical analysis demonstrated that Cdk2Ser-160was a relatively poor substrate compared with wild-type Cdk2Thr-160 for HeLa cell extract, the partially purified 45- and 42-kDa PP2Cs, and recombinant PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2. Similar to budding yeast Ptc2p and Ptc3p, PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 could not dephosphorylate cyclin-bound CDKs. These results indicate that human PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 represent the PP2C activity responsible for removing the activating phosphorylation from Cdk2 in HeLa cells. These studies also provide evidence that Cdk6, like Cdk2, is a substrate for PP2Cs. Besides CDKs, a number of MAP kinases appear to be substrates for type 2C protein phosphatases. For instance, PP2Cs have been implicated in negatively regulating stress-responsive protein kinase cascades in eukaryotic cells. In both budding yeast and fission yeast, genetic studies have shown that PP2C-like enzymes oppose the activation of the MAP kinase pathway that is activated in response to osmotic and heat shocks (53Maeda T. Wurgler-Murphy S.M. Saito H. Nature. 1994; 369: 242-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (937) Google Scholar, 54Shiozaki K.H. Akhavan-Niaki H. McGowan C.H. Russell P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 3742-3751Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 55Shiozaki K. Russell P. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 492-502Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). In human cells, PP2Cα can reverse the activation of the p38 and JNK MAPKs induced by stress and cytokines (44Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Biochemically, a human PP2Cα isoform dephosphorylated a similar threonine within the activation loop of the p38 MAPK (44Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Recently, Ptc1 and Ptc3 in Schizosaccharomyces pombe were shown to dephosphorylate Thr171 of the p38 homolog (Spc1) in its activating loop (56Nguyen A.N. Shiozaki K. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1653-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Given the similarity between the sites of activating phosphorylation in MAPKs and CDKs, we have proposed that PP2C-like enzymes could be general T-loop protein phosphatases (30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The activities of PP2Cs toward a variety of substrates can be affected by whether the site to be dephosphorylated is a serine or a threonine and by regulatory factors that bind to the substrates. Biochemically, PP2Cα has been seen to dephosphorylate a phosphothreonine substrate 20-fold more efficiently than the corresponding phosphoserine substratein vitro (51Donella Deana A. McGowan C.H. Cohen P. Marciori F. Meyer H.E. Pinna L.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1051: 199-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) and PP2C substrates have been proposed to be phosphorylated on threonine residues in vivo (32Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar). Using human Cdk2, a likely physiological substrate for PP2Cs, we confirmed that PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 removed the phosphate from a phosphoserine substrate slower (∼3-fold) than from the phosphothreonine substrate (Fig. 5). Indeed, many PP2C substrates, including all known CDKs undergoing activating phosphorylation, AMPK (57Clarke P.R. Moore F. Hardie D.G. Adv. Protein Phosphatases. 1991; 6: 187-209Google Scholar, 58Moore F. Weekes J. Hardie D.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 199: 691-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 59Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), moesin (62Hishiya A. Ohnishi M. Tamura S. Nakamura F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26705-26712Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), and p38 MAPK (44Takekawa M. Maeda T. Saito H. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4744-4752Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), are phosphorylated on threonine residues. However, some PP2C substrates such as axin (60Strovel E.T. Wu D. Sussman D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 2399-2403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and CFTR (61Travis S.M. Berger H.A. Welsh M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 11055-11060Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) may be phosphorylated on serines. Since exchanges of serines and threonines often have little effect on protein functions, the replacement of a threonine with a serine could be used to control the duration of phosphorylation. In addition, the binding of ligands or regulatory proteins to substrates also influences the rate of dephosphorylation by PP2Cs. For example, the dephosphorylation of AMPK is inhibited in the presence of 5′-AMP (59Davies S.P. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T. Hardie D.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 421-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar), and the dephosphorylation of CDKs is blocked by the binding of cyclins (Fig. 6,A-B, and Ref. 30Cheng A. Ross K.E. Kaldis P. Solomon M.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2947-2957Crossref Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The binding of ligands and regulatory proteins could induce conformational changes, block dephosphorylation, and preserve the phosphorylated state of the substrate for a period of time. Dephosphorylation could occur rapidly following removal of the ligand or of the regulatory proteins, such as happens with CDKs after cyclin degradation. Given that no regulatory subunits for PP2Cα/β have been found and that PP2Cα/β isoforms only differ significantly in their COOH-terminal segments, it is tempting to speculate that the diverse COOH-terminal regions are involved in regulating PP2C activity. Our studies showed that the COOH-terminal truncated forms of PP2Cα and PP2Cβ2 dephosphorylated Cdk2 and Cdk6 as well as the full-length enzymes (Fig. 4), indicating that the carboxyl regions may not directly regulate enzymatic activity or substrate specificity. Additional work will be required to determine whether these segments might facilitate interactions with substrates, localization within the cell, or other properties of these enzymes. In addition to the COOH-terminal regions, mammalian PP2Cα and -β isoforms possess potentialN-myristoylation sites similar to those in budding yeast Ptc2p and Ptc3p. In the crystal structure of human PP2Cα, the NH2-terminal glycine residue is close to its catalytic center (32Das A.K. Helps N.R. Cohen P.T.W. Barford D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6798-6809Crossref PubMed Scopus (384) Google Scholar), therefore, it is possible that mammalian PP2Cα and PP2Cβ are regulated by N-myristoylation in vivo. Further experiments will be necessary to test this possibility. We thank L. Tong and N. Pavletich for GST-KSHV cyclin, M. V. Murray and A. R. Krainer for PP2Cγ, E. Appella for GST-Wip1, and A.

https://openalex.org/W2057837626,"Activation of the nuclear factor κB plays a key role in viral pathogenesis, resulting in inflammation and modulation of the immune response. We have previously shown that A238L, an open reading frame from African swine fever virus (ASFV), encoding a protein with 40% homology to porcine IκBα exerts a potent anti-inflammatory effect in host macrophages, where it down-regulates NF-κB-dependent gene transcription and proinflammatory cytokine production. This paper reveals the mechanism of suppression of NF-κB activity by A238Lp. A238Lp is synthesized throughout infection as two molecular mass forms of 28 and 32 kDa, and vaccinia-mediated expression of A238L demonstrated that both proteins are produced from a single gene. Significantly, the higher 32-kDa form of A238L, but not the 28-kDa form, interacts directly with RelA, the 65-kDa subunit of NF-κB, indicating that the binding is dependent on a post-translational modification. Immunoprecipitation analysis shows the NF-κB p65-A238L p32 heterodimer is a separate complex from NF-κB-IκBα, and it resides in the cytoplasm. Moreover, we show that ASFV infection stimulates the NFκB signal transduction pathway, which results in the rapid degradation of endogenous IκBα, although both forms of A238Lp are resistant to stimulus-induced degradation. Using the proteasome inhibitor MG132, we show that when degradation of IκBα is inhibited, A238Lp binding to NF-κB p65 is reduced. The results suggest that the virus exploits its activation of the NF-κB pathway to enable its own IκB homologue to bind to NF-κB p65. Last, we show that synthesis of IκBα is increased during ASFV infection, indicating RelA-independent transcription of the IκBα gene.

Cell. 1998; 95: 729-731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). The NF-κB/Rel family is composed of homodimeric and heterodimeric complexes of the Rel family of proteins, which include RelA (p65), NF-κB1 (p50), NF-κB2 (p52), c-Rel, and RelB (2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4609) Google Scholar). The heterodimer of p50 and p65 is the most common form of NF-κB dimer. In resting cells, it is present in an inactive form bound to one of a family of IκB proteins, ensuring that proinflammatory gene expression is turned off. The family of IκBs, characterized by structural ankyrin repeat motifs that bind NFκB, includes IκBα, IκBβ, IκBε, the C-terminal ends of NF-κB precursors p100/p105, the Bcl3protein, and the Drosophila protein Cactus (2Ghosh S.

Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar). Activated NF-κB is then responsible for the rapid induction of cellular anti-viral activity. Viruses exploit diverse and complex strategies to counteract the host response to infection. Large DNA viruses encode proteins that are nonessential for viral replication but that can inhibit a range of cellular functions, including blocking of cytokines and their receptors (reviewed in Ref. 9Alcami A. Symons J.A. Khanna A. Smith G.L. Semin. Virology. 1998; 5: 419-427Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar), the cytotoxic immune defense (10Ploegh H.L. Science. 1998; 280: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar), or proteins that regulate cellular signaling (11Krajcsi P. Wold W.S.M. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1323-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). A novel strategy has been elucidated for the porcine virus, African swine fever virus (ASFV).1 ASFV is a large double-stranded DNA virus that infects macrophages, and virulent isolates cause a fatal hemorrhagic disease of pigs (12Mebus C.A. Becker Y. African Swine Fever. Martinus Nijhoff, Boston1987: 21-30Google Scholar, 13Wilkinson P.J. Pensaert M.B. Virus Infection of Porcines. Elsevier, Amsterdam1989: 17-35Google Scholar). In addition to hemorrhage, the pathology is characterized by lymphoid tissue destruction due to apoptosis (14Oura C.A.L. Powell P.P. Parkhouse R.M.E. J. Gen. Virol. 1998; 79: 1427-1438Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). We found that secretion and transcription of proinflammatory cytokines were inhibited in ASFV-infected macrophages (15Powell P.P. Dixon L.K. Parkhouse R.M.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8527-8533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The ASFV genome of 170–180 kilobase pairs was sequenced (16Yanez R.J. Rodriguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enriquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Vinuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) and revealed at least 150 open reading frames, one of which, designated A238L in the BA71V isolate, has ankyrin repeats similar to those in IκBα (16Yanez R.J. Rodriguez J.M. Nogal M.L. Yuste L. Enriquez C. Rodriguez J.F. Vinuela E. Virology. 1995; 208: 249-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Interestingly, we found that expression of the A238L gene alone inhibited NF-κB-dependent gene transcription and prevented NF-κB binding to its cognate κB target sequence (15Powell P.P. Dixon L.K. Parkhouse R.M.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8527-8533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the mechanism of inhibition of NF-κB by A238Lp. We show here that there are two forms of A238Lp synthesized throughout infection. One is the 28-kDa protein predicted from the ORF; the second is a higher molecular mass 32-kDa form produced by post-translational modification. Significantly, the higher molecular mass 32-kDa form and not the 28-kDa form bound NF-κB p65, thus demonstrating that the post-translational modification was required to inhibit the NF-κB pathway. We also show that, in common with many viruses (reviewed in Ref. 17Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), infection with ASFV activated the NF-κB signal transduction pathway. Remarkably, ASFV exploits the resulting signal-induced degradation of IκBα to enable its own IκB homologue to bind NF-κB p65. The result is a A238Lp-NF-κB heterodimer that forms an inactive complex in the cytoplasm that is not subject to signal-induced degradation. Furthermore, ASFV infection was found to increase IκBα synthesis, although NF-κB p65 activity was inhibited, thus supporting previous studies showing RelA-independent control of IκBα gene transcription (18Le Bail O.

Vero cells were infected with the tissue culture adapted strain of ASFV, BA71V, at a multiplicity of infection of 5:1 for 1 h and then incubated in complete medium for the indicated times. In some experiments, cells were stimulated with 10 μm phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and 10 μg/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In experiments where proteasome inhibitor was used, MG132 (Calbiochem) was added at 25 μm to the medium after the initial 1-h infection for the rest of the incubation period (7 h). Reporter genes were transfected into pig kidney IBRS2 cells or into the mouse macrophage cell line, RAW 264.7 (ECACC 91062702). Vaccinia virus (MVA-T7) expressing T7 RNA polymerase was grown in baby hamster kidney cells (21Sutter G. Ohlmann M. Erfle V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). Peptides corresponding to the N and C terminus of A238Lp (MEHMFPEREIENLFVKWIKKHIRNGNLTLF and VFHRWFKKKPKIIITGCKNNVYEKLPEQNP, respectively) were conjugated to maleimide- activated KLH and OVA and used to raise antibodies in rabbits. Two antibodies raised to the N-terminal peptide were characterized as cross-reacting with A238Lp and termed N1 and N2. One antiserum raised to the C-terminal peptide cross-reacted with A238Lp and was termed C1. Rabbit anti-NFκB p65 antiserum against an N-terminal peptide (SC109) was used for Western blot analysis and, where indicated, for immunoprecipitation, and a goat antibody against a C-terminal peptide of NF-κB (SC-372-G) was used in separate immunoprecipitations as indicated (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). IκBα was detected by Western blot with a monoclonal antibody (SC-1643) and by immunoprecipitation by rabbit polyclonal antibody (SC 203). Antibody recognizing ERP60 was raised in rabbits as described previously (22Roullier I. Brookes S.M. Hyatt A.D. Windsor M. Wileman T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 2373-2387Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal rabbit serum was from Sigma. Anti-ASFV vp30 was from Dan Rock (USDA, Plum Island Animal Disease Center). A238L in pcDNA3 was as described previously (15Powell P.P. Dixon L.K. Parkhouse R.M.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8527-8533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB p65 and IkBα cDNAs in RcCMV was from Heike Pahl (University of Freiberg). BSC40 cells were infected for 1 h at 37 °C with the MVA-T7 strain of vaccinia (21Sutter G. Ohlmann M. Erfle V. FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 9-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar) expressing bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase. Cells were washed in serum-free medium and transfected with pA238L or pcDNA3 alone (Invitrogen) using SuperFect (Quiagen). Cells were lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer 24 h post-transfection. Cells (2 × 106) were preincubated with methionine- and cysteine-free Eagle's medium for 30 min at 37 °C. They were pulse-labeled for 60 min using 35S-labeled Promix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in methionine- and cysteine-free medium. Cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in immunoprecipitation buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.8, 0.15m NaCl, 1% Brij 35, 10 mm iodoacetamide, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml each of leupeptin, pepstatin, chymostatin, and antipain (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In phosphate labeling experiments, cells were washed in phosphate-free medium and incubated for a further 5 h in phosphate-free medium containing [32P]orthophosphate (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and lysed and immunoprecipitated as described above. In subcellular localization experiments, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were obtained by standard procedures. Lysates or subfractions were precleared with protein A (Sigma) and immunoprecipitated with antibodies immobilized on protein A- or protein G-Sepharose (Sigma). After an overnight incubation, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. In some experiments, half the lysate was reprecipitated with a second antibody after incubation in 1% deoxycholate or 1% SDS for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were infected with ASFV for time periods described in the individual experiments. In some experiments, cells were incubated for 1 h with cycloheximide (100 μg/ml) with or without PMA/LPS (10 μm and 10 μg/ml, respectively) before lysis in immunoprecipitation buffer. Lysates were freeze-thawed and sonicated. Protein concentrations were determined by the Pierce BCA protein assay. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Protran BA 85, Schleicher and Schuell). Filters were blocked in 10% dried milk and incubated with the primary antibody in 5% dried milk 10% goat serum, 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h. Immunoreactive proteins were detected with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit secondary antibody using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Transfections were carried out in the pig kidney cell line IBRS2 or in the mouse macrophage cell line RAW264.7 using Transfectam (Promega). The RANTES promoter contains sequences from −952 to +53 of the human RANTES gene cloned into the HinDIII and XbaI site of the reporter vector pCAT basic (Promega). Sequences between −680 and +11 of the murine TNFα promoter were polymerase chain reaction-amplified from Balb/c genomic DNA and cloned between the HindIII andXbaI sites of the reporter vector pCAT basic. The human IL-8 and mutant IL-8 promoter constructs have been described previously (23Wechler A.S. Gordon M.C. Dendorfer U. LeClair K.P. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2515-2523PubMed Google Scholar). Transactivation studies with p65 and inhibition studies with IκBα were performed by co-transfection of the cDNAs for human NF-κB p65 or IκBα into cells with the promoter-reporter constructs. Cell lysates were prepared from transfected cells after 18 h and assayed for luciferase activity (Promega) or for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activity using a CAT enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The characteristics of the viral IκB homologue, A238Lp, were followed during infection by raising antibody to peptides representing the N and C termini of the protein encoded by the open reading frame. One antibody, termed N2, recognized denatured protein and was used in Western blotting experiments to follow the time course of A238Lp expression during infection (Fig. 1 A). A238Lp was first detected 2 h after infection with levels rising over 16 h. Interestingly, the antibody recognized two forms of A238Lp throughout the infectious cycle. One form migrated at 28 kDa, the molecular mass anticipated from translation of the A238L reading frame. The second form migrated at 32 kDa, suggesting post-translational modification of the protein or alternative splicing of the gene. When the A238L gene was expressed transiently from a T7 promoter using a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (MVA-T7), two forms of the protein were again identified at 32 and 28 kDa by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 C, lane 3). These bands were not seen in uninfected cells (lane 1) or in cells transfected with vector alone (lane 2). Since both forms of the protein were expressed from a single cDNA, we concluded that the 32-kDa form was a post-translational modification of the faster migrating 28-kDa form. Moreover, since the two forms occur in transfected cells in the absence of the rest of the ASFV genome, the modification is either the result of an endogenous host cell process or, more unlikely, caused by a vaccinia virus-encoded protein.Figure 1The A238L gene is expressed as two proteins throughout ASFV infection. A, time course of A238Lp expression. Vero cells were infected with ASFV for the indicated period and then lysed, and protein was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted to membrane filters. Expression of A238L protein was analyzed by Western blot using the N2 anti-A238L N-terminal peptide antibody. Two forms of A238Lp were detected throughout infection at 28 and 32 kDa.B, differential recognition of A238L p28 and p32 by conformation-dependent antibodies N1 and C1 in ASFV-infected cells. Vero cells, either uninfected (lanes 1 and 2) or infected with ASFV for 8 h (lanes 3–6), were pulse-labeled with [35S]cysteine/methionine for 1 h, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with either C1, the anti-A238L C-terminal peptide antibody (lanes 1 and 5); N1, the anti-A238L N-terminal peptide antiserum (lanes 2and 6); or the respective preimmune serum (lanes 3 and 4). At 8 h postinfection, N1 antibody recognized the 32-kDa protein A238L p32, while C1 recognized the 28-kDa protein A238L p28. C, vaccinia virus-mediated expression of A238L cDNA. BSC40 cells infected with vaccinia virus expressing T7 RNA polymerase (MVA-T7) were used to express the A238L gene under the control of a T7 promoter. Lysates from uninfected cells (lane 1) or from vaccinia-infected cells transfected with pcDNA3 alone (lane 2) or A238L in pcDNA3 (lane 3) were blotted onto membrane filters, and proteins were detected with N2 anti-A238L antiserum. In A238L-transfected cells, two bands were detected at 28 and 32 kDa not seen in uninfected cells or cells transfected with pcDNA3 alone.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Two further antibodies were identified that immunoprecipitated A238Lp from infected cell lysates. Surprisingly, one antibody (C1) raised against the C terminus of A238Lp immunoprecipitated only the 28-kDa form of the protein, while a second antibody (N1) raised against the N terminus recognized only the 32-kDa form (Fig. 1 B). Both antibodies failed to recognize A238Lp by Western blotting, suggesting that they recognize conformational epitopes. Importantly for this study, the antibodies could be used to distinguish between the two forms of A238Lp. Given the homology between A238Lp and IκBα, the potential association of the A238L gene product with NFκB was analyzed. Control cells or cells infected with ASFV for 8 h prior to the experiment were pulse-labeled for 60 min, lysed in detergent, and immunoprecipitated with antibody specific for a peptide representing either the N terminus or the C terminus of the 65-kDa subunit of NF-κB (Fig. 2 A). The NF-κB p65 N-terminal peptide antibody immunoprecipitated a 65-kDa protein from uninfected cells and a second protein at 37-kDa shown below to be IκBα (Fig. 2 A, lane 3) (a nonspecific band is seen in all lanes at 50 kDa). Significantly, when the immunoprecipitation was repeated for infected cells, a third protein was seen at 32 kDa (Fig. 2A, lane 4). The 32-kDa protein comigrated with the higher molecular weight form of A238Lp immunoprecipitated from the cell lysates with N1 anti-A238Lp antibody (Fig. 2 A, lane 1). A 28-kDa protein was not seen in the NF-κB immunoprecipitate, even though substantial levels of the 28-kDa form of A238Lp could be recovered from the lysates using the p28-specific antibody, C1 (Fig.2 A, lane 2). An antibody recognizing the C terminus of p65 immunoprecipitated only two proteins, NF-κB p65 and IκBα, at 37 kDa from both uninfected (Fig. 2 A,lane 5) and infected cells (Fig. 2 A, lane 6). The proteins at 65, 37, and 32 kDa were identified as NF-κB p65, IκBα, and A238L p32 by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2 B). Vero cell lysates that had been immunoprecipitated with either anti-IκBα antibody (lane 1) or anti-p65 antibody (lane 2) or an irrelevant control antibody of anti-IκB kinase antibody (lane 3) or the anti-A238Lp antibody N2 (lane 4) were transferred onto nitrocellulose. The upper half of the membrane was probed with an anti-p65 antibody, while the lower half was probed with either a monoclonal antibody to IκBα or the anti-A238Lp antibody, N2. Western blot analysis confirmed that the 37-kDa protein was IκBα, which co-precipitated a 65-kDa protein detected with anti-NF-κB p65 antibody (lane 1). In a reciprocal manner, immunoprecipitation with NF-κB p65 antiserum (lane 2) followed by Western blot analysis with NF-κB p65 antibody (upper panel) and IκBα antibody (middle panel) also identified the 65-kDa/37-kDa complex as NF-κB p65 and IκBα. When immunoprecipitates of p65 were generated from ASFV-infected cells and analyzed by Western blot using antibody N2, which detects both forms of A238Lp, a 32-kDa band was seen (lane 2, bottom panel), thus identifying the 32-kDa protein as A238L p32. A control immunoprecipitation with anti-IκB kinase antibody (Fig. 2 B, lane 3) demonstrated that the Western blotting was specific. When immunoprecipitates of A238Lp were generated and transferred to nitrocellulose and the membrane was probed with the N2 anti-A238Lp antiserum, both A238L p28 and A238L p32 were seen (lane 4, bottom panel); however, Western blotting of the A238L immunocomplex with anti-p65 did not detect NF-κB p65 (lane 4, top panel). Interestingly, therefore, this result suggests that either N2 did not recognize A238Lp complexed to p65 or that the antibody displaced p65 from A238L p32. The interaction of p65 with A238L p32 was established further in the next experiment. A sequential reimmunoprecipitation approach was taken to confirm the identify of the 32-kDa protein associated with NF-κB p65 in infected cells (Fig. 2 C). Lysates from an equal number of infected cells were immunoprecipitated with either N1 anti-A238Lp antiserum (lane 1) or anti-p65 antiserum (lane 2). The complex of three proteins (p65, IκBα, and p32) in the anti-p65 immunoprecipitate were dissociated at room temperature with 1% deoxycholate and reprecipitated with the N1 antibody specific for the 32-kDa form of A238Lp (Fig. 2 C, lane 4). A single band at 32 kDa was detected, confirming the identity of the viral protein precipitating with p65 as the higher molecular weight form of A238Lp. A control using normal rabbit serum to reimmunoprecipitate the complex is shown (lane 5). Surprisingly, a comparison of lanes 1 and 2 of Fig.2 C showed that more A238L p32 was recovered from lysates with anti-p65 antibody (lane 2) than when the same lysate was immunoprecipitated with excess N1 antibody specific for A238L p32 (lane 1). The results suggested that most of the A238Lp in cells was bound to NF-κB p65 and that the epitope on A238Lp recognized by the anti-N-terminal peptide antibody was masked by NF-κB p65. This was consistent with two observations: first, that increased levels of A238L p32 could be recovered from the complex with p65 if they were first dissociated in deoxycholate and then reprecipitated (comparing Fig. 2 C, lanes 1 and4); second, p65 is not detected by Western blot of an N2 immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2 B, lane 4). An experiment was performed to investigate whether a trimolecular complex existed between p65, IκBα, and A238L p32 (Fig.2 D). Lysates from Vero cells infected for 8 h with ASFV were immunoprecipitated with an excess of anti-IκBα antiserum, revealing proteins at 37 kDa (IκBα), 65 kDa (p65), and 70 kDa (perhaps other Rel proteins) but not at 32 kDa (Fig. 2 D,lane 1). This result indicated IκBα bound p65 separately from A238L p32. The supernatant from this IκBα-depleted lysate was then immunoprecipitated with NF-κB p65 antiserum and showed two major proteins at 65 and 32 kDa and a reduced amount of IκBα at 37 kDa (Fig. 2 D, lane 2). NF-κB p65-IκBα complexes were much reduced but not completely absent from this sample, probably due to low affinity of the IκBα antibody (as seen in Fig.2 B, lane 1). These results indicate that A238L p32 bound to NF-κB p65 that was not complexed with IκBα. In infected cells, therefore, NF-κB p65 exists as two pools, either complexed to IκBα or to A238L p32 (Fig. 2 D, lane 3). The localization of the NF-κB p65-A238L p32 complex was determined in infected cells after pulse labeling and fractionation into cytoplasm and nuclei. Nuclear or cytoplasmic fractions were immunoprecipitated with N1 or N2 anti-A238Lp or with anti-p65 antibodies. Both forms of A238L, p28 and p32, were found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 3, N1 and N2), as was the complex of NF-κB p65 with A238L p32 (Fig. 3, α p65). Interestingly, NF-κB p65 was only found in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Upon infection of cells, many viruses stimulate the signal transduction pathway leading to IκBα degradation (17Baeuerle P.A. Baichwal V.R. Adv. Immunol. 1997; 65: 111-137Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In resting cells, NF-κB is held in an inactive complex with IκBα. Upon cell stimulation, phosphorylation of IκBα by an IκB kinase complex provides a signal for ubiquitination and degradation of IκBα by cytosolic proteasomes (8Karin M. Ben-Neriah Y. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 2000; 18: 621-663Crossref PubMed Scopus (4084) Google Scholar,24Palombella V.J. Rando O.J. Goldberg A.L. Maniatis T. Cell. 1994; 78: 773-785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1916) Google Scholar). The released NF-κB dimer enters the nucleus to increase antiviral and proinflammatory gene transcription. To investigate the possible activation of the NF-κB signal transduction pathway by ASFV, steady state levels of IκBα were analyzed in the presence and absence of the proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (Fig.4 A, middle panel). Lysates from equal numbers of uninfected cells, either untreated (Fig.4 A, lane 1) or treated with MG132 (Fig.4 A, lane 2) were transferred to membranes along with lysates from ASFV-infected cells either untreated (Fig.4 A, lane 3) or treated with MG132 (Fig.4 A, lane 4). Steady state IκBα levels were lower in infected cells compared with uninfected cells and were increased toward normal by proteasome inhibition. These results show that ASFV infection itself stimulates IκBα degradation by proteasomes. Significantly, therefore, the signal transduction pathway leading to IκB kinase activation and resulting in IκB phosphorylation is not blocked during ASFV infection, since signal-induced phosphorylation of IκB is a prerequisite for its degradation. Synthetic rates of IκBα were measured in infected cells by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation with anti-IκBα antiserum (Fig. 4 A, top panel). IκBα synthesis decreased in cells after proteasome inhibition (lane 2), showing that the synthesis of IκBα is dependent on its own degradation (25Chiao P.J. Miyamoto S. Verma I.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 22-32Crossref Scopus (390) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the results show that synthesis of IκBα was increased in ASFV-infected cells (lane 3) compared with uninfected cells (lane 1), and this increase could be blocked by proteasome inhibition (lane 4). Although ASFV inhibits p65 activity, other members of the Rel family have been shown to up-regulate the IκBα promoter activity (18Le Bail O. Schmidt-Ullrich R. Israel A. Embo J. 1993; 12: 5043-5049Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). IκBα is also transcriptionally regulated by transforming growth factor-β (19Arsura M. Wu M. Sonenshein G.E. Immunity. 1996; 5: 31-40Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar), a cytokine that has been shown to be up-regulated in ASFV infection (15Powell P.P. Dixon L.K. Parkhouse R.M.E. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8527-8533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The results demonstrate a complex regulation of the IκBα gene, which is under further investigation. The high synthetic rate of IκBα together with its low steady-state level in infected cells indicates that ASFV infection provides a potent signal for IκBα degradation. One explanation for the observed suppression of NF-κB gene transcription by A238L protein could be the formation of a complex with A238Lp where the viral protein is resistant to proteasomal degradation. The relative stabilities of IκBα and the two forms of A238Lp in response to cell stimulation were therefore tested. Vero cells, either uninfected or infected with ASFV for 8 h, were incubated with cycloheximide for 1 h either in the presence or absence of PMA/LPS (Fig. 4 B). Levels of both IκBα and"

This system revealed that (i) low expression of both mutants exerted toxicity sensitive to both Ac-DEVD-CHO (DEVD) and glutathione ethyl ester (GEE), whereas wild-type APP (wtAPP) only at higher expression levels caused GEE/DEVD-resistant death to lesser degrees; (ii) toxicity by the V642I mutation was entirely GEE/DEVD sensitive; and (iii) toxicity by higher expression of NL-APP was GEE/DEVD resistant. The GEE/DEVD-sensitive death was sensitive to pertussis toxin and was due to Go-interacting His657-Lys676 domain. The GEE/DEVD-resistant death was due to C-terminal Met677-Asn695. APP mutants lacking either domain unraveled elaborate intracellular cross-talk between these domains. E618Q-APP, responsible for non-AD type of a human disease, only exerted GEE/DEVD-resistant death at higher expression. Therefore, (i) different FAD mutations in APP cause neuronal cell death through different cytoplasmic domains via different sets of mechanisms; (ii) expression levels of FAD genes are critical in activating specific death mechanisms; and (iii) toxicity by low expression of both mutants most likely reflects the pathogenetic mechanism of FAD.

Genetic studies of early-onset FAD have demonstrated that structural alterations in APP cause AD. There are at least two different types of mutations reported in APP as established causes for FAD: Ile/Phe/Gly mutations at Val642 or the Asn/Leu mutation at Lys595/Met596 in APP695 (the numbering follows Kang et al.

Despite the fact that neuronal death is a central abnormality in AD, exactly how these FAD-linked mutants of APP cause neuronal death has been little understood. Multiple groups (2Yamatsuji T.

Presenilin-2 is a member gene of the PS family, whose mutation is responsible for certain forms of FAD. One potential mechanism underlying the neurotoxicity of these FAD mutants is that neuronal death occurs by deposition of Aβ, particularly Aβ1–42/43, a longer version of Aβ polypeptides. Indeed, the deposition of AβX−42/43 is the earliest abnormality observed in AD brains (8Iwatsubo T. Odaka A. Suzuki N. Mizusawa H. Nukina N. Ihara Y.

Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar), and caspase-dependent pathways (18Nakagawa T. Zhu H. Morishima N. Li E. Xu J. Yankner B.A. Yuan J. Nature. 2000; 403: 98-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (2966) Google Scholar), mediate Aβ amyloid-induced neurotoxicity. Taken together, these observations suggest that countermeasures against neuronal cell death in these types of FAD and even sporadic AD might be feasible even after Aβ deposition if the countermeasures could suppress intracellular toxicity signals inside the neurons expressing the FAD genes or in the neurons exposed to Aβ-related insults. Therefore, it is important to understand fully the entire body of intracellular death signals generated by the expression of AD-causative genes. The aforementioned studies also suggest that FAD mutants of both APP and presenilin-2 may cause neuronal cell death through a common mechanism. On the other hand, it has not been determined whether the function of K595N/M596L-APP (NL-APP), another established cause of FAD, is relevant to neuronal cell death. In contrast, virus-mediated overexpression of wtAPP causes significant death in neuronal cells (19Nishimura I. Uetsuki T. Dani S.U. Ohsawa Y. Saito I. Okamura H. Uchiyama Y. Yoshikawa K. J.

The present study was thus conducted to investigate whether expression of NL-APP causes death in neuronal cells, like V642I-APP, and if so, whether both FAD mutants kill neuronal cells through the same mechanism, and in what relationship between the mutation-specific mechanisms and the toxicity of wtAPP. Here we report unexpectedly complicated potential of FAD mutants to cause neurotoxicity through different cytoplasmic domains via different sets of distinct mechanisms. wtAPP gene, the full-length APP695 cDNA (2Yamatsuji T. Okamoto T. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Nishimoto I. Science. 1996; 272: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), was subcloned into pIND plasmid (Invitrogen). V642I-APP cDNA was described previously (2Yamatsuji T. Okamoto T. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N. Asami-Odaka A. Ireland S. Kinane T.B. Nishimoto I. Science. 1996; 272: 1349-1352Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and E618Q-APP was constructed by a site-directed mutagenesis, using a QuikChange Site-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene), with confirmation of generated mutations by sequencing. The sense and antisense primers used for E618Q construction were 5′-CTGGTGTTCTTTGCTCAAGATGTGGGTTCGAACAAAGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCTTTGTTCGAACCCACATCTTGAGCAAAGAACACCAG-3′, respectively. NL-APP cDNA was provided by Dr. T. Okamoto (RIKEN, Wako, Japan). These mutant APP cDNAs were subcloned to pIND with sequence confirmation. The pIND-encoded wtAPP, V642I-APP, or NL-APP was named as pIND-wtAPP, pIND-V642I-APP, or pIND-NL-APP, respectively. EGFP cDNA was purchased from CLONTECH (pEGFP-N1), and was also subcloned to pIND (pIND-EGFP). Glutathione ethyl ester (GEE) and PTX were from Sigma and Calbiochem-Novabiochem, respectively, and Ac-DEVD-CHO was from Peptide Institute Inc. Ponasterone (Invitrogen) was employed as EcD. Vitamin E and Aβ1–43 were from Wako Pure Chemicals and BACHEM, respectively. F11 cells were grown in Ham's F-12 plus 18% FBS and antibiotics. F11 cells are the hybrid of a rat embryonic day 13 primary cultured neuron with a mouse neuroblastoma NTG18. These cells are one of the best models for primary cultured neurons, exhibiting without differentiation factor treatment, a number of characteristics for primary neurons, including generation of action potentials (21Platika D. Boulos M.H. Baizer L. Fishman M.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 3499-3503Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). F11 cells (F11/EcR cells) overexpressing both EcR and RXR were established using the co-expression vector pVgRXR and Zeocin selection (Invitrogen). For transient transfection of the pIND plasmids, F11/EcR cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate and cultured in Ham's F-12 plus 18% FBS for 12–16 h and transfected with EcD-inducible pIND plasmids (1 μg of pIND plasmids, 2 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 4 μl of plus reagent) in the absence of serum for 3 h. After subsequent incubation with Ham's F-12 plus 18% FBS for 12–16 h, cells were cultured with or without inhibitors in Ham's F-12 plus 10% FBS for 2 h, and EcD was then added to the media. Cell mortality was measured by trypan blue exclusion assay at 72 h after the onset of EcD treatment. Transfection efficiency was assessed with pEGFP-N1 by fluorescence microscopy. F11/EcR cells were transfected with this plasmid (1 μg of plasmid, 2 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 4 μl of plus reagent) in the absence of serum for 3 h. After subsequent incubation with Ham's F-12 plus 10% FBS for 48 h, transfection efficiency was assessed by: (i) dividing the number of green fluorescent cells by the total cell number in the same randomly chosen fields in each transfection; and (ii) calculating the mean ± S. D. of these ratios for each transfection. The mean ± S.E. of independent transfections was then calculated. For the Aβ experiment, F11/EcR cells were seeded at 7 × 104 cells/well in a 6-well plate or a 35 mm-dish and cultured in Ham's F-12 plus 18% FBS for 12–16 h. Cells were transfected with EcD-inducible pIND plasmids (1 μg of pIND plasmids, 2 μl of LipofectAMINE, and 4 μl of plus reagent) in the absence of serum for 3 h, then reseeded at 1.4 × 104cells/well in a 24-well plate, and cultured in Ham's F-12 plus 18% FBS for 18 h. Cells were then cultured with or without 25 μm Aβ1–43 in Ham's F-12 plus 10% FBS. Two hours after the onset of Aβ treatment, various concentrations of EcD or equivalent volumes of EtOH were added to the culture media and cells were cultured for an additional 72 h. Cell mortality was then measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. Trypan blue exclusion assay was performed as follows. At the termination of experiments, cells were suspended by pipetting gently, and 50 μl of 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma) was mixed with 200 μl of the cell suspension (final concentration 0.08%) at room temperature. Stained cells were counted within 3 min after the mixture with trypan blue solution. The mortality of cells was then determined as a percentage of trypan blue-stained cells in total cells. The cell mortality assessed by this method thus represents the population of dead cells in total cells, including both adhesive and floating cells at the termination of experiments. The basal death rates with or without pIND vector transfection with or without EcD treatment indicated the actual fraction of dead cells, but not artificial cell death occurred after detaching cells, as in situ staining of trypan blue-positive cells indicated the presence of similar fractions of dead cells. In all experiments shown in each figure presented in this study, we performed the experiments examining cell mortality (i) in the presence or absence of 40 μm EcD without transfection and (ii) in the presence or absence of 40 μmEcD with empty pIND transfection, both of which were constantly as low as the basal cell mortality in the absence of EcD with pIND-APP construct transfection (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of expressed APP constructs and endogenous tubulin was performed as follows. Cell lysates (20 μg/lane) were submitted to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and separated proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride sheets. After blocking, the blots were probed with the primary antibody (2.5 μg/ml anti-APP monoclonal antibody 22C11 (Roche Diagnostics) or 1/3000 dilution of anti-αtubulin monoclonal antibody TU-02 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology)) and 1/5000 dilution of the secondary antibody horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (Bio-Rad), followed by visualization of the immunoreactive bands by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The densities of the 120-kDa APP immunoreactive band and the 50-kDa tubulin band were, respectively, measured by densitometrical analysis. All of the experiments described in this study were repeated at least three times with independent transfections and treatments, each of which yielded essentially the same result. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's t test. We transfected F11/EcR cells with pIND-encoded mutant APP cDNA driven by an integrated EcD-responsive promoter (22No D. Yao T.P. Evans R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 3346-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar); about 1 day after transfection, we treated cells with EcD. In this context, the cDNA-encoding protein should express in a single cell in an EcD dose-dependent manner, uninfluenced by the variation in transfection efficiency. In addition, the transfection efficiency in F11/EcR cells with the present lipofection method was appreciably high and stable. We performed three independent transfections of F11/EcR cells with (constitutively active promoter-driven) pEGFP-N1 plasmid, which revealed the transfection efficiency to be 68.0 ± 3.1% as the mean ± S.E. (Fig.1 A). As expected, when F11/EcR cells were transfected with pIND-EGFP and treated with increasing concentrations of EcD, the expression of EGFP in a single cell was unidirectionally augmented, as the concentration of EcD became higher (Fig. 1 B), suggesting that a single-cell expression of pIND-encoded cDNA can be controlled by altering the concentrations of EcD in this system. We also confirmed that the expression of EGFP by ≤40 μm EcD was not affected by 100 μmAc-DEVD-CHO, 1 mm GEE, or 1 μg/ml PTX in cells transfected with pIND-EGFP (data not shown). We next examined whether wtAPP, V642I-APP, or NL-APP was expressed in proportion to the concentration of treated EcD (Fig. 1 C). Cells were transfected with pIND-encoded APP genes and treated with EcD. The result revealed that expression of either V642I-APP or NL-APP was not linearly augmented by EcD, and reached saturation by >10 μm EcD. In contrast, wtAPP was expressed proportionally to the EcD concentration under the same condition. From the literature (2Yamatsuji T. Okamoto T. Takeda S. Fukumoto H. Iwatsubo T. Suzuki N.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3769-3777Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we reasoned that in this system, V642I-APP and NL-APP may be induced by EcD similarly to the induction of wtAPP, but degraded through mechanisms involving caspase activation by the FAD mutants themselves, resulting in certain balanced expression. In accord with this idea, in the presence of 100 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO, an established cell-permeable inhibitor of caspases, expression of either FAD mutant became linear in relation to EcD concentrations (Fig. 1 C, right). Under the same conditions, expression of wtAPP was not affected by Ac-DEVD-CHO. These data suggest that the two FAD genes in pIND, like wtAPP in the same vector, were induced in proportion to the EcD concentration, and that both FAD mutants, but not wtAPP, were degraded by activating DEVD-sensitive mechanisms. The transfection of either pIND-encoded FAD gene in the presence of Ac-DEVD-CHO or in the transfection of pIND-wtAPP in its presence or absence, treatment with 10, 20, and 40 μm EcD resulted in the expression of APP immunoreactivity ∼2.5-, ∼4-, and ∼7-fold, respectively, of the basal expression, indicating that 10, 20, and 40 μm EcD caused ∼1.5-, ∼3-, and ∼6-fold expression of the transfected APP constructs, respectively. In F11/EcR cells, we examined whether and how robustly FAD mutants in pIND (pIND-V642I-APP and pIND-NL-APP) cause cell death by various concentrations of EcD. Fig.2 A indicates that in cells transfected with either pIND-V642I-APP or pIND-NL-APP, EcD augmented cell mortality dose dependently. In contrast, the vehicle ethanol caused no increase in cell mortality in either case. Treatment of non-transfected F11/EcR cells or vector-transfected F11/EcR cells with or without EcD resulted in low cell mortality around 10% for 72 h, the basal death rate of these cells (Fig. 2 A, upper panel). Considering that transfection efficiency was 60–70%, it followed that induction of either V642I-APP or NL-APP by ≥10 μm EcD caused death in most of the transfected cells after 72 h. Expression of wtAPP resulted in a different dose-response curve for death (Fig. 2 B, red closed circles). EcD caused little death in pIND-wtAPP-transfected cells at <20 μm, and stimulated death dose-dependently only at ≥20 μm, and to lesser degrees than the toxicity by the same concentrations of EcD in cells transfected with either pIND-FAD mutant. These data indicate that expression of V642I-APP or NL-APP as low as endogenous APP effectively killed neuronal cells and that wtAPP was toxic at only higher levels of expression. We next investigated whether Ac-DEVD-CHO affects cell death by either FAD gene. EcD-induced death of pIND-V642I-APP-transfected cells was greatly suppressed by 100 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig.2 B, blue closed circles). Surprisingly, the dose-response curve of V642I-APP-induced death in the presence of 100 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO was virtually identical to the dose-response curve of wtAPP-induced death. This was also the case with GEE, a cell-permeable antioxidant (Fig. 2 C, green closed circles). The dose-response curve of V642I-APP-induced death in the presence of 1 mm GEE was again virtually identical to its dose-response curve in the presence of 100 μmAc-DEVD-CHO and the curve of wtAPP-induced death. The EcD dependence of pIND-V642I-APP expression in the presence of 100 μmAc-DEVD-CHO was linear, equivalent to that in the presence of 1 mm GEE (data not shown), and virtually identical to that of pIND-wtAPP expression (Fig. 1 C, right). These data indicated that V642I turned on a specific death mechanism sensitive to both Ac-DEVD-CHO and GEE, and also suggested that death by wtAPP was resistant to both. In fact, toxicity by wtAPP was totally resistant to 100 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 2 D, blue closed circles) and 1 mm GEE (Fig. 2 D, green closed circles). Neither Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 1 C) nor GEE (data not shown) affected the EcD-dependent expression of wtAPP. These data indicate that toxicity by wtAPP was through a mechanism completely different from the toxicity stimulated by the V642I mutation. Therefore, a novel possibility was raised that K595N/M596L might induce neuronal cell death through further different mechanisms. Both Ac-DEVD-CHO and GEE inhibited NL-APP-induced death, but not in the same curves as V642I-APP-induced death in the presence of either reagent (Fig.2 E). In the presence of 100 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO or 1 mm GEE, death by NL-APP occurred in mutually equivalent dose-response curves. The dose-response curve of NL-APP-induced death revealed that death by low expression of NL-APP was completely suppressed by Ac-DEVD-CHO and GEE, whereas death by higher induction of NL-APP was resistant to both reagents. EcD dependence of pIND-NL-APP expression was linear and equivalent to that of pIND-wtAPP in the presence of 100 μm Ac-DEVD-CHO (Fig. 1 C, right) or 1 mm GEE (data not shown). These data indicate that (i) low expression of both FAD mutants caused neuronal cell death GEE/DEVD sensitively, whereas wtAPP only at higher expression caused GEE/DEVD resistant death to lesser degrees; (ii) toxicity given by V642I was entirely GEE/DEVD-sensitive; and (iii) toxicity by higher induction of NL-APP was GEE/DEVD-resistant. To confirm that GEE acts on reactive oxygen species to block cell death by low induction of both FAD genes, we examined the effects of vitamin E and Aβ. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant at 10–100 μm, and Aβ induces or enhances oxidative stress in neuronal cells (26Harris M.E. Hensley K. Butterfield D.A. Leedle R.A. Carney J.M. Exp. Neurol. 1995; 131: 193-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar, 27Manelli A.M. Puttfarcken P.S. Brain Res. Bull. 1995; 38: 569-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Fu W. Luo H. Parthasarathy S. Mattson M.P. Neurobiol. Dis. 1998; 5: 229-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3 A, 100 μmvitamin E suppressed cell death by V642I-APP and NL-APP in dose-response curves virtually identical to those of V642I-APP-and NL-APP-induced death in the presence of 1 mm GEE, respectively. These data indicate that vitamin E precisely mimics the inhibitory effect of GEE. In contrast, Aβ potentiated the toxic actions of both V642I-APP and NL-APP. In cells with no transfection or with empty-pIND transfection, 25 μm Aβ1–43 had no effect on cell death (Table I). However, in the presence of 25 μm Aβ1–43, both V642I-APP and NL-APP exerted cytotoxicity at lower expression than that in the absence of Aβ, and caused death at 5–10% higher rates (Fig.3 B). These data suggest that Aβ enhances oxidative stress induced by both APP mutants, consistent with the study of Lockhartet al. (29Lockhart B.P. Benicourt C. Junien J.L. Privat A. J. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 39: 494-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) reporting that Aβ peptide renders hippocampal neurons more sensitive to free radical attack without direct action on free radical generation.Table IToxic effect of Aβ amyloid on the basal death ratesNo transfectionpIND transfectionAbeta (−)Abeta (+)Abeta (−)Abeta (+)EcD (−)7.1 ± 1.3%9.2 ± 0.3%9.2 ± 0.7%8.0 ± 0.7%EcD (+)8.4 ± 1.4%8.1 ± 1.3%8.5 ± 0.6%8.9 ± 1.6%F11/EcR cells were transfected with (pIND transfection) or without (no transfection) empty pIND and treated with (Abeta (+)) or without (Abeta (−)) 25 μm Aβ1–43 with 40 μm EcD (EcD (+)) or an equivalent volume of EtOH (EcD (−)).

Cell mortality was measured by trypan blue exclusion assay 72 h after the onset of EcD treatment. The values indicate mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments (in % dead cells of total cells). We next investigated the domains in APP responsible for each mechanism for death by V642I-APP, NL-APP, or wtAPP. A clue was that the His657-Lys676 domain (Domain 20) in APP interacts directly and specifically with the PTX-sensitive G protein Go in vitro (30Nishimoto I. Okamoto T. Matsuura Y. Okamoto T.

As shown in Fig.4 A, 1 μg/ml PTX completely suppressed death stimulated by the V642I mutation (but not completely by V642I-APP), indicating that the GEE/DEVD-sensitive mechanism for death by V642I-APP is entirely PTX-sensitive. This was also the case with NL-APP (Fig. 4 B). The dose-response curve of NL-APP-induced death indicated that (i) the GEE/DEVD-sensitive mechanism for death by low expression of NL-APP was totally sensitive to PTX; and (ii) the GEE/DEVD-resistant death mechanism by higher induction of NL-APP was resistant to PTX. In contrast, PTX did not affect the dose-response curve of wtAPP-induced death (Fig.2 C), indicating that (i) the observed PTX effects on death by FAD mutants were not artifacts; and (ii) wtAPP-induced death was PTX/GEE/DEVD-resistant. In the presence of 1 μg/ml PTX, EcD dependence of the expression of pIND-V642I-APP or pIND-NL-APP was similar to that of pIND-wtAPP (data not shown).

https://openalex.org/W2167968442,"Incomplete RNA splicing is a key feature of the retroviral life cycle. This is in contrast to the processing of most cellular pre-mRNAs, which are usually spliced to completion. In Rous sarcoma virus, splicing control is achieved in part through acis-acting RNA element termed the negative regulator of splicing (NRS). The NRS is functionally divided into two parts termed NRS5′ and NRS3′, which bind a number of splicing factors. The U1 and U11 small nuclear ribonucleoproteins interact with sequences in NRS3′, whereas NRS5′ binds several proteins including members of the family of proteins. Among the proteins that specifically bind NRS5′ is a previously unidentified 55-kDa protein (p55). In this report we describe the isolation and identification of p55. The p55 binding site was localized by UV cross-linking to a 31-nucleotide segment, and a protein that binds specifically to it was isolated by RNA affinity selection and identified by mass spectrometry as hnRNP H. Antibodies against hnRNP H immunoprecipitated cross-linked p55 and induced a supershift of a p55-containing complex formed in HeLa nuclear extract. Furthermore, UV cross-linking and electrophoretic mobility shift assays indicated that recombinant hnRNP H specifically interacts with the p55 binding site, confirming that hnRNP H is p55. The possible roles of hnRNP H in NRS function are discussed."

https://openalex.org/W2088818435,"We have recently identified integrin αvβ3 and the associated CD47/integrin-associated protein (IAP) together with three other proteins as the potential tumor cell receptors for the α3 chain of basement membrane type IV collagen (Shahan, T.A., Ziaie, Z., Pasco, S., Fawzi, A., Bellon, G., Monboisse, J. C., and Kefalides, N. A. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 4584–4590). Using different cell lines expressing αvβ3, αIIbβ3, and/or CD47 and a liquid phase receptor capture assay, we now provide direct evidence that the synthetic and biologically active α3(IV)185–206 peptide, derived from the α3(IV) chain, interacts with the β3 subunit of integrin αvβ3, independently of CD47. Increased α3(IV) peptide binding was observed on transforming growth factor-β1-stimulated HT-144 cells shown to up-regulate αvβ3 independently of CD47. Also, incubation of HT-144 melanoma cells in suspension induced de novo exposure of ligand-induced binding site epitopes on the β3 subunit similar to those observed following Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) stimulation. However, RGDS did not prevent HT-144 cell attachment and spreading on the α3(IV) peptide, suggesting that the α3(IV) binding domain on the β3subunit is distinct from the RGD recognition site. α3(IV) peptide binding to HT-144 cells in suspension stimulated time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, while the RGDS peptide did not. Two major phosphotyrosine proteins of 120–130 and 85 kDa were immunologically identified as focal adhesion kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). A direct involvement of PI3-kinase in α3(IV)-dependent β3 integrin signaling could be documented, since pretreatment of HT-144 cells with wortmannin, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, reverted the known inhibitory effect of α3(IV) on HT-144 cell proliferation as well as membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase gene expression. These results provide evidence that the α3(IV)185–206 peptide, by directly interacting with the β3 subunit of αvβ3, activates a signaling cascade involving focal adhesion kinase and PI3-kinase. We have recently identified integrin αvβ3 and the associated CD47/integrin-associated protein (IAP) together with three other proteins as the potential tumor cell receptors for the α3 chain of basement membrane type IV collagen (Shahan, T.A., Ziaie, Z., Pasco, S., Fawzi, A., Bellon, G., Monboisse, J. C., and Kefalides, N. A. (1999) Cancer Res. 59, 4584–4590). Using different cell lines expressing αvβ3, αIIbβ3, and/or CD47 and a liquid phase receptor capture assay, we now provide direct evidence that the synthetic and biologically active α3(IV)185–206 peptide, derived from the α3(IV) chain, interacts with the β3 subunit of integrin αvβ3, independently of CD47. Increased α3(IV) peptide binding was observed on transforming growth factor-β1-stimulated HT-144 cells shown to up-regulate αvβ3 independently of CD47. Also, incubation of HT-144 melanoma cells in suspension induced de novo exposure of ligand-induced binding site epitopes on the β3 subunit similar to those observed following Arg-Gly-Asp-Ser (RGDS) stimulation. However, RGDS did not prevent HT-144 cell attachment and spreading on the α3(IV) peptide, suggesting that the α3(IV) binding domain on the β3subunit is distinct from the RGD recognition site. α3(IV) peptide binding to HT-144 cells in suspension stimulated time-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, while the RGDS peptide did not. Two major phosphotyrosine proteins of 120–130 and 85 kDa were immunologically identified as focal adhesion kinase and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase). A direct involvement of PI3-kinase in α3(IV)-dependent β3 integrin signaling could be documented, since pretreatment of HT-144 cells with wortmannin, a PI3-kinase inhibitor, reverted the known inhibitory effect of α3(IV) on HT-144 cell proliferation as well as membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase gene expression. These results provide evidence that the α3(IV)185–206 peptide, by directly interacting with the β3 subunit of αvβ3, activates a signaling cascade involving focal adhesion kinase and PI3-kinase. focal adhesion kinase Chinese hamster ovary ligand-induced binding site monoclonal antibody matrix metalloproteinase membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase noncollagenous domain 1 phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase transforming growth factor TGF-β1 integrin-associated protein anterior lens capsule polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-PCR Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Tris-buffered saline 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide Tumor cell invasion and metastasis are complex multistep processes that involve cell attachment to basement membrane or extracellular matrix proteins, degradation of adhesive proteins, and migration through the proteolytically modified tumor cell microenvironment (1Liotta L.A. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5054s-5059sPubMed Google Scholar,2Lester B.R. McCarthy J.B. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1992; 11: 31-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Anchorage of tumor cells to basement membrane proteins is mediated in part by integrins, a large family of heterodimeric cell surface receptors, that function not only as cell adhesion receptors but also as signaling receptors regulating cell growth, cell death, migration, and tissue remodeling (3Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar, 4Clark E.A. Brugge J.S. Science. 1995; 268: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (2809) Google Scholar). Since integrins are devoid of an intrinsic kinase activity, the outside-in signaling process initiated through ligand binding is thought to result in conformational changes of the receptor that are propagated from the ectodomain across the plasma membrane to the integrin cytoplasmic tails, allowing their interaction with intracellular signaling proteins. Integrin signaling leads to the activation of various kinases, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK),1phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-kinase), mitogen-activated protein kinase (3Schwartz M.A. Schaller M.D. Ginsberg M.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1995; 11: 549-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar), as well as integrin-linked kinase (5Hannigan G.E. Leung-Hagesteijn C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Coppolino M.G. Radeva G. Filmus J. Bell J.C. Dedhar S. Nature. 1996; 379: 91-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar). Alternatively, integrin signaling can be mediated through transmembrane receptors that are associated with integrins in the cell membrane (6Hemler M.E. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). Integrin-associated protein (IAP) or CD47 is a widely expressed 50-kDa transmembrane protein that was initially identified through copurification with integrin αvβ3 from human placenta (7Brown E. Hooper L. Ho T. Gresham H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 2785-2794Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). CD47, which is composed of an N-terminal (extracellular) IgG variable domain, followed by five membrane-spanning hydrophobic helices and a cytoplasmic tail, is found in association with β3 and other integrins and has been implicated in multiple β3 integrin-mediated functions, such as enhanced αvβ3-dependent cell spreading or chemotaxis and, in platelets, αIIbβ3-dependent cell spreading and aggregation (8Frazier W.A.

Both αvβ3 and IAP have been shown to stimulate FAK phosphorylation; however, in contrast to αvβ3, CD47-dependent downstream signaling does not involve PI3-kinase but appears to require a pertussis toxin-sensitive, heterotrimeric Gi protein, allowing activation of c-Src, which in turn phosphorylates SYK and FAK (8Frazier W.A.

Brown J.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Type IV collagen is an heterotrimer formed by three of six genetically distinct α chains (α1 to α6) (11Hudson B.G.

The α(IV) chains contain a typical collagenous domain of about 1400 amino acids and a COOH-terminal NC1 domain of about 230 amino acids. Type IV collagen and synthetic peptides derived from type IV collagen have been shown to promote cell adhesion, spreading, and migration (14Chelberg M.K. McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P. Furcht L.T.

We have previously shown that the anterior lens capsule (ALC) type IV collagen, which contains an α3(IV) chain, as well as the NC1 domain derived from the α3(IV) chain inhibited HT-144 melanoma cell proliferation and migration, whereas Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm collagen, which does not contain the α3(IV) chain, did not (17Pasco S.

Furthermore, within the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain, we have identified a peptide sequence, comprising residues 185–203, that is unique to the α3 chain and reproduces the same inhibitory effect on tumor cell proliferation as native ALC type IV collagen (18Han J.

This peptide also inhibits tumor cell migration by down-regulating integrin αvβ3as well as the membrane type 1-matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP), known to activate matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) (17Pasco S. Han J. Gillery P. Bellon G. Maquart F.X. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. Monboisse J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar). Although the precise physiological role of this α3(IV) collagen chain is still unknown, comparative analysis of the distribution of α1(IV) and α3(IV) chains in normal and neoplastic lung tissues revealed a selective localization of α3(IV) chains in alveolar basement membranes of normal lung tissue, in contrast to its pronounced localization at the interface between invasive tumor cell clusters and stroma in neoplastic lung tissue (19Polette M.

Pathol. 1997; 182: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), suggesting that one of the functional roles of α3(IV) chains could be to limit tumor development in the host tissue by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation.In an attempt to identify the tumor cell receptor interacting with the α3 chain of type IV collagen, we have previously identified the αvβ3-CD47 complex and three other proteins as the potential receptors for the α3(IV)179–208 peptide (20Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that the α3(IV) peptide identifies a novel type IV collagen binding site on the β3 subunit of integrin αvβ3, distinct from the RGD recognition site, and initiates an αvβ3-dependent intracellular signaling process leading to FAK and PI3-kinase phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESReagents and AntibodiesHorseradish peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Roosendaal, The Netherlands).

Horton (Bone and Mineral Center, Department of Medecine, University College London, United Kingdom)), and anti-LIBS1 and anti-LIBS2 (Dr. M. H. Ginsberg, Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA).Cell CultureThe human metastatic melanoma cell line HT-144 was a gift from Dr. P. Braquet (Bioinova, Plaisir, France). The Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line CRL9096 was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). The CHO cell clones expressing human β3 (CHO A13), human αvβ3 (CHO A06), or human αIIbβ3 (CHO A10) have been established in our laboratory (22Kieffer N. Melchior C. Guinet J.M. Michels S. Gouon V. Bron N. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1996; 4: 25-39Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All cell lines were grown in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (IMDM) (BioWhittaker, Verviers, Belgium), supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm glutamine, and penicillin-streptomycin (100 units/ml). Cells were routinely passaged with EDTA buffer, pH 7.4 (126 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, and 50 mm HEPES).Immunofluorescence and Flow CytometryFor flow cytometry analysis, cells were detached from culture plates with EDTA buffer and washed twice with IMDM. The cells (5 × 105) were then incubated for 30 min with the primary antibody or with the biotinylated α3(IV)185–206 peptide, washed with IMDM, and further incubated for 30 min with a FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody or with FITC-conjugated streptavidin. Cells were then washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (136 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KOH, 8 mm Na2HPO4, 1.8 mmKH2PO4, pH 7.4) and subsequently analyzed on an Epics Elite ESP flow cytometer (Coulter Corp., Hialeah, FL). For immunofluorescence microscopy, the labeled cells were fixed by methanol on a glass coverslip, mounted in PBS-glycerol, and examined with a Leica DMRB microscope using a × 63 oil immersion objective.Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot AnalysisPreparation of Cell LysatesCells were detached with EDTA buffer, washed twice in cold PBS, and lysed for 30 min in ice-cold lysis buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the protein concentration was determined using Lowry's modified method (23Dulley J.R. Grieve P.A. Anal. Biochem. 1975; 64: 136-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (848) Google Scholar). For the identification of phosphotyrosine proteins in total cell extracts, HT-144 melanoma cells were resuspended in IMDM and serum-starved for 90 min at 37 °C. The cells (106/ml) were then incubated with the α3(IV)185–206 peptide (20 μg/ml) or the corresponding scrambled peptide for different time points, centrifuged for 2 min at 1200 × g, and lysed with 2% SDS in lysis buffer B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 2 mm sodium orthovanadate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin). Lysates were immediately heated at 90 °C for 5 min prior to protein concentration determination.ImmunoprecipitationCell lysate (1 mg of protein) was incubated overnight at 4 °C with the anti-αvβ3 mAb 23C6 or the anti-CD47 mAb B6H12. Immune complexes were precipitated with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were then washed three times with lysis buffer A, and the precipitates were recovered by boiling the beads in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4.6% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bromphenol blue). For phosphotyrosine protein immunoprecipitation, HT-144 melanoma cells were incubated with the α3(IV)185–206 peptide as described above and lysed with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate in lysis buffer B. Cell extracts (1 mg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with either the polyclonal anti-FAK or the anti-PI3-kinase antibody, and the immune complexes were processed as described above.Western Blot AnalysisImmunoprecipitates or total cell lysates (50 μg of protein) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred onto nitrocellulose Hybond C membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a semidry transblot apparatus (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were blocked overnight in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 137 mm NaCl) containing 0.1% Tween and 5% nonfat dry milk and subsequently incubated for 2 h at room temperature with the anti-β3 mAb 4D10G3 or the anti-CD47 mAb B6H12. Following several washes in TBS-Tween, the membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG in TBS-Tween containing 5% nonfat dry milk, washed in TBS-Tween, and finally processed using a chemiluminescence kit (SuperSignal; Pierce). For membrane stripping, the membranes were incubated at 50 °C in stripping buffer (62.5 mm Tris, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and extensively washed. For identification of phosphotyrosine proteins, the blots were blocked with TBS containing 0.1% Tween and 1% bovine serum albumin and probed with the anti-phosphotyrosine mAb PY-20.Liquid Phase Receptor Capture Assay Using the Biotinylated α3(IV)185–206 PeptideCell extracts (2 mg of protein) were incubated overnight at 4 °C with 5 μg of the biotinylated α3(IV)185–206 peptide in 10 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmCaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and aprotinin. Streptavidin-Sepharose beads were then added and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were extensively washed with the same buffer, and the captured receptors were recovered by boiling the beads in 30 μl of SDS sample buffer. Recovered proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose. The membranes were blocked and then incubated with either the anti-β3 (4D10G3), anti-αv (VNR139), or anti-αIIb (S1.3) mAbs as described above.Adhesion Assay96-Well plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with fibrinogen (20 μg/ml in PBS buffer), the NC1 domain of ALC type IV collagen (20 μg/ml), or the α3(IV)185–206 peptide (20 μg/ml in 0.05m sodium carbonate/sodium bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and then blocked for 1 h at 37 °C with 20 mg/ml of sterile-filtered, heat-inactivated bovine serum albumin in PBS. Prior to use, the plates were washed twice with PBS. The cells were detached with EDTA buffer, washed, preincubated for 15 min with RGDS (2 mm) or the α3(IV)185–206 peptide (20 μm), and subsequently transferred to the wells (30,000 cells/well). After a 2-h incubation at 37 °C, individual microtiter wells were microphotographed using a Nikon inverted microscope equipped with phase contrast.Cell Proliferation AssayCells were detached with EDTA buffer, washed and resuspended in IMDM, and then added to 96-well plates coated with poly-l-lysine. After a 3-h incubation at 37 °C, the peptide (20 μg/ml in IMDM) was added to the wells, and the cells were further incubated for 48 h at 37 °C. At the end of the incubation period, the cells were quantitated using the modified 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (24Loveland B.E. Johns T.G. Mackay I.R. Vaillant F. Wang Z.X. Hertzog P.J. Biochem. Int. 1992; 27: 501-510PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MTT was added to each well to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, the culture medium was removed, and 100 μl of Me2SO was added to each well. The absorbance of the samples was measured at 570 nm. A MTT calibration curve was performed with samples of known cell concentration to correlate the measured absorbance with cell number. Each assay was carried out in triplicate.Semiquantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA was extracted with guanidinium/phenol/chloroform (25Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62982) Google Scholar). For semiquantitative RT-PCR, 2 μg of total RNA were transcribed to cDNA with an RNA PCR kit (TaKaRa Biomedicals) using an antisense primer for MT1-MMP together with the antisense primer β-actin used here as an internal control. The MT1-MMP cDNA was then amplified together with the β-actin cDNA in a single tube for 25 cycles. The following antisense primers were used: 5′-ACATCAAAGTCTGGGAAGGA-3′ for MT1-MMP and 5′-GACGATGCCGTGCTCGATG-3′ for β-actin. Sense primers were 5′-AGCAGGGAACGCTGGCAGT-3′ for MT1-MMP and 5′-GATCCGCCGCCCGTCCACA-3′ for β-actin. cDNA amplification was performed on a Perkin-Elmer GeneAmp PCR System 2400, and the cycling program included a 20-s denaturation step at 95 °C and a 30-s annealing step at 55 °C, followed by a 30-s elongation step at 72 °C. The RT-PCR cDNA products were electrophoresed through a 1.5% agarose gel and visualized after ethidium bromide staining of the gel.DISCUSSIONBasement membranes are thin specialized extracellular matrices that are functionally important for embryonic development, maintenance of tissue architecture, tissue remodeling during development and wound healing, and protection of tissues and organs from mechanical stress or exogenous factors (29Sado Y.

A major component of all basement membranes is type IV collagen (10Timpl R. Brown J.C. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 123-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar), which promotes cell adhesion and migration (14Chelberg M.K. McCarthy J.B. Skubitz A.P. Furcht L.T. Tsilibary E.C. J.

Tumor cell interactions with type IV collagen have been shown to rely on α3β1 or αvβ3 integrins, leading to changes in their invasive properties as well as changes in their expression of various MMPs, such as MMP-1 or MMP-2 (30Lauer J.L. Gendron C.M. Fields G.B. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 5279-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 31Seftor R.E. Seftor E.A. Gehlsen K.R. Stetler-Stevenson W.G. Brown P.D. Ruoslahti E. Hendrix M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 1557-1561Crossref PubMed Scopus (432) Google Scholar). We have previously reported that a peptide sequence corresponding to residues 185–203 in the α3(IV) chain of type IV collagen was able to inhibit in vitro tumor cell proliferation and migration through reconstituted basement membranes. The peptide sequence contains a SNS triplet in position 189–191 that is unique to the α3(IV) collagen chain, and replacement of each of the two serine residues by an alanine abolished its biological activity (17Pasco S. Han J. Gillery P. Bellon G. Maquart F.X. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. Monboisse J.C. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 467-473PubMed Google Scholar, 18Han J. Ohno N. Pasco S. Monboisse J.C. Borel J.P. Kefalides N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20395-20401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The cysteine residue at position 185 is also required for the biological activity of the α3(IV) peptide. Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm type IV collagen, which lacks the α3(IV) chain, failed to inhibit tumor cell proliferation and migration. Finally, a tentative affinity chromatography of melanoma cell extract on a α3(IV)179–208 peptide column identified the αvβ3-CD47 complex as the tumor cell receptors (20Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar).In the present study, we have characterized in detail the α3(IV)185–206 peptide binding site on the αvβ3-CD47 complex and provide evidence that the peptide specifically interacts with the β subunit of integrin αvβ3. Indeed, cells expressing αvβ3 interacted with the α3(IV)185–206 peptide, independently of the presence or absence of CD47, whereas cells expressing CD47 in the absence of αvβ3 did not. Furthermore, to demonstrate a direct interaction of αvβ3 with the α3(IV)185–206 peptide, we performed receptor capture experiments using the biotinylated α3(IV)185–206 peptide and cell extracts of various cell types. When HT-144 melanoma cell extract was used, the αvβ3-CD47 complex was recovered, in accordance with our previous data (20Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar). The α3(IV)185–206 peptide also interacted with αvβ3 in the absence of CD47, whereas it was unable to capture CD47 in the absence of αvβ3. Since we have previously shown that the blocking anti-CD47 mAb B6H12 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of the α3(IV) peptide on tumor cell proliferation (20Shahan T.A. Ziaie Z. Pasco S. Fawzi A. Bellon G. Monboisse J.C. Kefalides N.A. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 4584-4590PubMed Google Scholar), a possible explanation for this result could be an antibody-dependent steric hindrance of the αvβ3/peptide interaction. Indeed, data by Gresham et al. (32Gresham H.D. Goodwin J.L. Allen P.M. Anderson D.C. Brown E.J. J.

Alternatively, the blocking anti-CD47 mAb could induce conformational changes of αvβ3, preventing its interaction with the α3(IV) peptide. This hypothesis is supported by data showing that stimulation of CD47 by its agonist 4N1K, a peptide derived from the COOH-terminal cell binding domain of thrombospondin, spontaneously activates αIIbβ3, as demonstrated by enhanced binding of the conformationally sensitive mAb PAC-1 (9Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar).Integrin αvβ3 constitutively interacts with a large variety of RGD-containing adhesive proteins present in the extracellular matrix (33Cheresh D.A. Spiro R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17703-17711Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and this interaction is mediated through the metal ion-dependent adhesion site-like domain of the β3 subunit (34Tozer E.C.

By using different cell lines expressing either αvβ3 or αIIbβ3, we provide evidence that the α3(IV) peptide binds to the β3 subunit. However, the α3(IV) peptide binding site is clearly distinct from the RGD recognition site, since inhibition experiments with an RGDS peptide did not inhibit melanoma cell adhesion to immobilized α3(IV)185–206 peptide, whereas RGDS completely inhibited melanoma and CHO αvβ3 cell adhesion to immobilized fibrinogen.Ligand binding to β3 integrins is known to induce conformational changes of the integrin receptor ectodomain, reflecting the most earliest events in integrin-dependent outside-in signaling. These conformational changes can be monitored with monoclonal antibodies to neoepitopes known as LIBS (35Pelletier A.J. Kunicki T. Quaranta V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1364-1370Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Interestingly, similar to RGDS, the α3(IV)185–206 peptide was able to induce LIBS epitope expression on the β3 integrin subunit. More surprising"

L1 supports homophilic L1-L1 binding that involves several Ig domains but can also bind with high affinity to the proteoglycan neurocan. It has been reported that neurocan can block homophilic binding; however, the mechanism of inhibition and the precise binding sites in both molecules have not been determined. By using fusion proteins, site-directed mutagenesis, and peptide blocking experiments, we have characterized the neurocan-binding site in the first Ig-like domain of human L1. Results from molecular modeling suggest that the sequences involved in neurocan binding are localized on the surface of the first Ig domain and largely overlap with the G-F-C β-strands proposed to interact with the fourth Ig domain during homophilic binding. This suggests that neurocan may sterically hinder a proper alignment of L1 domains. We find that the C-terminal portion of neurocan is sufficient to mediate binding to the first Ig domain of L1, and we suggest that the sushi domain cooperates with a glycosaminoglycan side chain in forming the binding site for L1.

In the human, mutations in the L1 gene product cause abnormal brain development, characterized by mental retardation and defects in central nervous system axon tracts such as the corpus callosum and corticospinal tract (5Kenwrick S. Doherty P. BioEssays. 1998; 20: 668-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Beside the nervous system, L1 is expressed in hematopoietic and certain epithelial cells and by many human tumors suggesting a more expanded role of the molecule than presently recognized (6Ebeling O. Duczmal A. Aigner S. Geiger C. Schöllhammer S. Kemshead J.T. Möller P. Schwartz- Albiez R. Altevogt P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar, 7Pancook J.D.

L1 consists of 6 Ig-like domains and five fibronectin type III repeats followed by a transmembrane region and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. L1 not only acts as an adhesive molecule but has also signaling potential that is essential for its function (1Brümmendorf T. Kenwrick S. Rathjen F.G. Curr. Opin.

Proteoglycans are assumed to have important roles for modulating cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions during nervous tissue histogenesis in the embryonic and early postnatal phase (11Oohira A. Katoh S.R. Watanabe E. Matsui F. Neurosci. Res. 1994; 20: 195-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 12Oohira A. Matsui F. Tokita Y. Yamauchi S. Aono S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 2000; 374: 24-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). L1 has been found to bind to the proteoglycan neurocan (13Rauch U. Gao P. Janetzko A. Flaccus A. Hilgenberg L. Tekotte H. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14785-14801Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neurocan has been identified as one of the most abundant chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans in the developing rat brain (14Friedlander D.R. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The extracellular matrix of the developing brain is particularly rich in chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (15Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. Chang L.B. Preti C. Biochemistry. 1975; 14: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). These molecules have in various instances been implicated in the formation of barriers for cell migration and in the inhibition of neuronal outgrowth (16Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Experientia (Basel ). 1993; 49: 429-446Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). However, in the thalamocortical system, L1 bearing thalamocortical afferent fibers were found to extend into neurocan-immunoreactive regions while growing through the proteoglycan-enriched cortical subplate (17Fukuda T. Kawano H. Ohyama K. Li H.P. Takeda Y. Oohira A. Kawamura K. J. Comp. Neurol. 1997; 382: 141-152Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Earlierin vitro studies have shown that neurocan can inhibit neural adhesion and neurite outgrowth on L1-coated surfaces (14Friedlander D.R. Milev P. Karthikeyan L. Margolis R.K. Margolis R.U. Grumet M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 669-680Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar) and is capable of blocking the homophilic L1 interaction in aggregation assays using purified L1-coated covaspheres (18Grumet M. Flaccus A. Margolis R.U. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 815-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). However, the biochemical basis of this binding and the mechanism of inhibition have not been established. A recent study has proposed a model for homophilic L1-L1 binding (19Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Björkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). By using the crystal structure of hemolin, a related member of the I class of Ig domain molecules, it was proposed that in the nonengaged resting state the N-terminal Ig domains adopt a horseshoe-like structure due to an intramolecular binding between domains 1 and 4 or 2 and 3, respectively (19Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Björkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). The backfolding of domains is facilitated by an amino acid spacer leading to a sharp bend between domains 2 and 3 (19Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Björkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). When engaged in homophilic binding between adjacent cells, L1 could undergo a conformational change leading to a pairwise antiparallel alignment of Ig domains 1–4 and 2–3 (19Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Björkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In previous work we have studied the interaction of L1 with neurocan and integrins (20Oleszewski M. Beer S. Katich S. Geiger C. Zeller Y. Rauch U. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24602-24610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In order to understand better the mechanism of inhibition of L1-L1 homophilic binding by neurocan, we have now examined the binding in more detail. Our results show that the first domain of L1 is the only binding site and that neurocan contacts the same site in the first domain used for interaction with the domain 4. We conclude that neurocan binding inhibits homophilic binding by preventing a proper domain alignment. We also demonstrate that the binding site in neurocan is located in the C-terminal part and that the sushi domain and a GAG side chain cooperate in the formation. The mouse T cell hybridoma IH3-1-expressing cell surface neurocan, CHO1cells, and CHO-L1 cells stably transfected with mouse L1 were described elsewhere (20Oleszewski M. Beer S. Katich S. Geiger C.

Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 2667-2675Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IH3-1 cells were kept at 37 °C, 5% CO2, and 100% humidity and were cultivated in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2-mercaptoethanol, and glutamine. CHO cells were kept in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum and glutamine. The construction and characterization of recombinant fusion proteins containing the Fc portion of human IgG1 and the entire ectodomain (L1-Fc) or the Ig domains 1, 1–5, 1–6, and 6 of mouse L1 have been described (20Oleszewski M.

Additional proteins containing Ig domains 2–5, 2–6, or the 5 fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats were constructed by PCR. Ig domains 2–5 were amplified using sense primer 5′-TCAGTAGTTCTGCCTTGCAA-3′ and the 5′-ATGAATTCACTTACCCAGGAGCCCATGCTGGTTGCG-3′ reverse primer. Ig domains 2–6 were amplified using the sense primer 5′-TGCAACCCTCCACCCAGTGCAGCCCCA-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-ATGAATTCACTTACCGGCCACACAACTGTAGTTGCCCT-3′. For amplification of the FNIII repeats the sense primer was 5′-CTGCTGA-AGCAGAGCCAGGTGCACTTG-3′ and the reverse primer was 5′-ATGAATTCACTTACCCACAGGGCCAGTTCCATTAGT-3′. To the latter fragment an L1 signal peptide was added as described previously for the single 6. domain fusion protein 6.L1-Fc (6Ebeling O. Duczmal A. Aigner S. Geiger C. Schöllhammer S. Kemshead J.T. Möller P. Schwartz- Albiez R. Altevogt P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). All reverse primers for amplification of 2–5, 2–6, and FNIII repeats contained an artificial splice donor site and an EcoRI restriction site to allow subsequent directional cloning into the pIg vector (6Ebeling O. Duczmal A. Aigner S. Geiger C. Schöllhammer S. Kemshead J.T. Möller P. Schwartz- Albiez R. Altevogt P. Eur. J.

An Fc fusion protein containing the first Ig domain of human L1 (1.L1-Fc) was constructed by PCR using an human L1 cDNA clone as template (obtained from Dr. V. Lemmon, Cleveland, OH) and the primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCAGAAAGATGGTCGTGGCGCTGC-3′ (containing aHindIII site, a Kozak sequence and the start codon) and the 5′-ATGAATTCACTTACCGAGCCGGATCTCATGGGA-3′ reverse primer which contained an overhang with an artificial splice donor site and anEcoRI restriction site. For all PCRs 2 units ofTaq polymerase expanded long template mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) were used. Amplified fragments with the expected size were digested with EcoRI andHindIII and cloned into the pIg vector as described (6Ebeling O. Duczmal A. Aigner S. Geiger C. Schöllhammer S. Kemshead J.T. Möller P. Schwartz- Albiez R. Altevogt P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2508-2516Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Single mutations L120V and G121S in the first domain of human L1 were introduced using the QuickchangeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Heidelberg, Germany). For this, human 1.L1-Fc encoding cDNA was excised from the pIg vector and subcloned into the PCR blunt cloning vector (Invitrogen). Conditions for mutagenesis PCR were 95 °C (30 s) for one cycle, 95 (30 s), 64 (30 s), and 70 °C (8, 5 min) for 16 cycles, and one cycle at 72 °C for 10 min. Mutated cDNAs were digested with EcoRI andHindIII and reinserted into the pIg vector. For construction of a human 1.L1-Fc domain expressing amino acids encoded by exon 2, cDNA from a neuronal cell line Kelly, which expresses exon 2, was used as template for PCR using sense primer 5′-CCCAAGCTTGCAGAAAGATGGTCGTGGCGCTGC-3′ (containing aHindIII site, a Kozak sequence, and the start codon) and reverse primer 5′-TCGTCACCCGCTCGTCCTGCTTGATGT-3′. The amplified product was digested with HindIII and BglII. This fragment was ligated to human 1.Ig domain in pIg previously cut withHindIII and BglII. All sequences and point mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid DNA was transfected into COS-7 cells, and supernatants containing the Fc fusion protein were collected. The recombinant proteins were quantitated by ELISA and characterized by SDS-PAGE as described before (20Oleszewski M. Beer S. Katich S. Geiger C. Zeller Y. Rauch U. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24602-24610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Construction of recombinant full-length neurocan and the neurocan fragment D925, L639, and 773M, respectively, has been described previously (22Retzler C. Gohring W. Rauch U. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27304-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The production and characterization of all other neurocan fragments are described in full detail in a separate paper (23Talts U. Kuhn U. Roos G. Rauch U. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 259: 378-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In fragments D925ΔS and D925ΔT a stop codon was introduced after threonine 1153 and after arginine 1216, respectively. For the NCΔL construct, lacking the second EGF repeat, glutamic acid 985 was fused via an artificial leucine replacing isoleucine 986 with glycine 1152. Recombinant full-length neurocan and the fragments were produced in HEK 293 cells and purified from the culture supernatant either by immunoaffinity chromatography on 1D1 Sepharose columns or by DEAE-Sephacel anion exchange chromatography (20Oleszewski M.

Purified neurocan and subfragments were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis as described previously (22Retzler C. Gohring W. Rauch U. J. Biol.

Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry and purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography. They were characterized further by analytical high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy. The following β-strand peptides of the first Ig domain of human L1 were selected according to Suet al. (19Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Björkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) and used as inhibitors in cell adhesion assays (predicted β-strand are in bold letters): A, PVITEQS; A′, RLVVFP; B, TDDISLKCEASG; C, EVQFRWTRDG, C′, VHFKPKE; D, ELGVTVYQS; E, HSGSFTITG; F, FQGIYRCFASNK; and G, GTAMSHEIRLMAE. The control peptide sequence was WKTMNIRGE. For the binding of IH3-1 cells to Fc fusion proteins, the proteins were adsorbed to LABTEK glass chamber slides (Nunc, Wiesbaden, Germany) precoated for 16 h with anti-human IgG-Fc (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) to allow directional coating. Equal coating of the wells was controlled in parallel by an anti-human Fc-specific ELISA. For cell binding to neurocan fragments, the proteins (10 μg/ml) were adsorbed to glass slides for 16 h at 4 °C. After coating, the wells were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, washed with Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm Hepes, and used for the assay. For the adhesion assay, cells (5 × 106/ml) were suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 mm Hepes, and 0.2-ml aliquots were added to the coated slides for 30 min at room temperature without shaking. The slides were then fixed in 4% glutaraldehyde in PBS after briefly dipping into PBS. For peptide-blocking studies, IH3-1 cells were preincubated with peptides at the indicated concentration for 10 min at room temperature and then transferred to the chamber slides. Antibody-mediated blocking of adhesion was done as described before (20Oleszewski M. Beer S. Katich S. Geiger C. Zeller Y. Rauch U. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24602-24610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Binding of CHO-L1 cells to neurocan fragments was performed in the absence or presence of 2 μg/ml laminarin sulfate (kind gift from Dr. I. Vlodavsky, Hadassah Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel) where indicated. Cell binding was measured by counting six independent 10× fields by video microscopy using IMAGE 1.47 software. For the analysis of L1-neurocan interaction, 0.5 μg of neurocan or its fragments were adsorbed to Immobilon membranes (Millipore) using a dot blot apparatus. Membranes were incubated with Fc fusion proteins at the indicated dilutions and the respective secondary antibodies followed by ECL detection as described above for Western blots. For laminarin sulfate inhibition studies, the incubation of the membrane-adsorbed neurocan with human 1.L1-Fc proteins was done in the presence of 1 μg/ml laminarin sulfate. Glycanase treatment of neurocan fragment D925ΔT was done in the presence of 1 unit/ml chondroitinase ABC lyase (EC 4.2.2.4) or heparinase III (EC 4.2.2.8) for 1 h at 37 °C as described before (20Oleszewski M.

After enzyme treatment an aliquot of the reaction was analyzed by Western blot analysis using a polyclonal antibody to neurocan as described previously (20Oleszewski M. Beer S. Katich S. Geiger C. Zeller Y. Rauch U. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24602-24610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The remaining portion was adsorbed to Immobilon, and the the immobilized fragment was probed with the C-terminal fragment-specific mAb 1D1 or with 1.L1-Fc as described above. Dot intensities were quantitated by densitometric scanning using Lumi Imager (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). In a previous study we have shown that a binding site for neurocan is located in the first Ig domain of L1 (20Oleszewski M. Beer S. Katich S. Geiger C. Zeller Y. Rauch U. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24602-24610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). This conclusion was based on the observation that only L1-Fc fusion proteins containing the first domain could support neurocan binding. To investigate whether the first domain was the only binding site, we generated additional fusion proteins containing Ig domains 2–5, 2–6, or the five fibronectin type III repeats. The fusion proteins were purified and characterized as described before and revealed the expected sizes of 80 kDa (2–5.L1-Fc), 91 kDa (2–6.L1-Fc), and 96 kDa (FNIII-Fc) as revealed by SDS-PAGE. Neurocan-mediated binding was studied using IH3-1 cells that express neurocan at the cell surface but are negative for L1 (20Oleszewski M. Beer S. Katich S. Geiger C. Zeller Y. Rauch U. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24602-24610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). In addition, these cells can bind to the 6. domain of L1 using αvβ3 (20Oleszewski M. Beer S.

The assay was therefore carried out in the absence of divalent cations in order to suppress integrin-mediated binding to L1 (20Oleszewski M. Beer S. Katich S. Geiger C. Zeller Y. Rauch U. Altevogt P. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24602-24610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). As presented in Fig.1 A, IH3-1 cells showed comparable binding levels to the fusion proteins containing L1 domains 1, 1–5, and 1–6. In contrast, all fusion protein constructs (2–5, 2–6, and FNIII) lacking the first Ig domain showed a profound reduction in adhesion.Figure 2Effect of point mutations and exon 2 expression on L1-neurocan binding.

Note that equal concentrations of Fc proteins in the supernatant was controlled by parallel enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To corroborate the cell binding data, we analyzed the interaction of Fc proteins with recombinant neurocan using a dot blot immunoassay. As shown in Fig. 1 B, strong binding of L1-Fc, 1–5.L1-Fc, and 1–6.L1-Fc to neurocan was observed in a concentration-dependent fashion. In contrast, no binding was detected with 2–5.L1-Fc, 2–6.L1-Fc, and FNIII-Fc proteins. Collectively, these data suggested that the first Ig domain was the only neurocan-binding site in mouse L1. We wished to study whether the first Ig domain of human L1 was a binding partner for neurocan, too. Therefore, we generated a fusion protein of the human L1 first Ig domain (1.L1-Fc). As shown in Fig. 2 B, also the human 1.L1-Fc protein could support neurocan-mediated adhesion of IH3-1 cells. Additional experiments indicated that the human 1.L1-Fc could bind to recombinant neurocan in a dot blot immunoassay (see TableI).Table IIdentification of potential L1 binding domains in neurocanConstructBinding of neurocan control%L63994 ± 7.1773M5 ± 0.8D92596 ± 12.6D925ΔS1 ± 0.1D925ΔT88 ± 6.3NCΔL56 ± 8.2Recombinant neurocan fragments (0.5 μg) were immobilized to Immobilon membranes using a dot blot apparatus.

Two pathological mutations in the first Ig domain of human L1 have been studied (24Bateman A. Jouet M. MacFarlane J. Du J.S. Kenwrick S. Chothia C.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 4744-4753Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). To examine the effects of these mutations on neurocan binding, we constructed mutated forms of human 1.L1-Fc, L120V and G121S, respectively. The different forms are schematically represented in Fig. 2 A. In addition, due to alternative splicing of exon 2, the L1 extracellular domain can occur with or without the amino acid motive YEGHH preceding the first Ig domain (Fig. 2 A). The L1 isoform containing this exon is restricted to neuronal cells (26Takeda Y. Asou H. Murakami Y. Miura M. Kobayashi M. Uyemura K. J. Neurochem. 1996; 66: 2338-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). To test a putative influence of exon 2 expression on neurocan binding, we constructed a first domain fusion protein in which the YEGHH motive was present. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the presence or absence of this motive did not influence the neurocan-mediated binding of IH3-1 cells. In contrast, cell adhesion was reduced by approximately 71% in the L120V mutant and 43% in the G121S mutant, respectively (Fig.2 B). Equal coating of the wells with recombinant proteins was controlled in parallel by performing an anti-human Fc specific ELISA (data not shown). To map closer the neurocan-binding site in the first Ig domain, peptide inhibition studies were employed. Peptides of variable length were selected on the basis of the predicted folding of the L1 first Ig domain. We concentrated on peptide sequences expressed on β-strands as originally proposed by Su et al. (19Su X.D. Gastinel L.N. Vaughn D.E. Faye I. Poon P. Björkman P.J. Science. 1998; 281: 991-995Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar) based on the crystal structure of hemolin. The sequence and localization of the selected peptides is depicted in Fig.3 A. As shown in Fig.3 B, at 2 μm peptide concentration none of the peptides affected the integrin-mediated binding of IH3-1 cells to immobilized vitronectin used for control purposes. In contrast, the neurocan-mediated adhesion to the human 1.L1-Fc was clearly inhibited by peptides C and G (see Fig. 3 C). Additional experiments shown in Fig. 3 D demonstrated that the two peptides inhibited the binding of IH3-1 cells to 1.L1-Fc in a dose-dependent fashion, whereas peptide F showed only a weak inhibitory effect. The control peptide did not reveal any inhibition. To visualize the topography of β-strands and point mutations affecting L1-neurocan binding, the first Ig domain of L1 was subjected to computer-based modeling using molecular coordinates from hemolin (19Su X.D.

Whether side chain carboxylates or alternatively main chain carbonyls of these glutamates project into the pore to form the ion-binding locus has been uncertain. We have addressed this question by examining effects of sulfhydryl-modifying agents (methanethiosulfonates) on 20 cysteine-substituted mutant forms of an L-type Ca2+ channel. Sulfhydryl modifiers partially blocked whole oocyte Ba2+ currents carried by wild type channels, but this block was largely reversed with washout. In contrast, each of the four EEEE locus glutamate → cysteine mutants (0 position) was persistently blocked by sulfhydryl modifiers, indicating covalent attachment of a modifying group to the side chain of the substituted cysteine. Cysteine substitutions at positions immediately adjacent to the EEEE locus glutamates (±1 positions) were also generally susceptible to sulfhydryl modification. Sulfhydryl modifiers had lesser effects on channels substituted one position further from the EEEE locus (±2 positions). These results indicate that the carboxylate-bearing side chains of the EEEE locus glutamates and their immediate neighbors project into the water-filled lumen of the pore to form an ion-binding locus.

The structural basis of the high ion selectivity that underlies exclusive transport of Ca2+ ions through voltage-gated Ca2+ channels is under active investigation; it has been found that each of the four homologous motifs of these channels contributes one glutamate residue to the ion selectivity filter in the pore (1Kim M.S.

Mechanistically, ion selectivity in Ca2+ channels relies upon differences between ions in affinity for the EEEE locus. For a solution containing both Ca2+ and Na+, for example, Ca2+ is permeant and Na+ is not because Ca2+ binds more tightly to the locus than does Na+ (4Yang J. Ellinor P.T. Sather W.A. Zhang J.F. Tsien R.W. Nature. 1993; 366: 158-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar, 7Almers W. McCleskey E.W. J. Physiol. 1984; 353: 585-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar, 8Hess P.

Upon identification of the EEEE locus as the essential structural feature underlying Ca2+ channel selectivity, it was generally presumed that the carboxylate-bearing side chains of the EEEE locus glutamates projected into the aqueous pore where they could form a cation-binding structure rather like that of organic chelators such as EGTA. Evidence supporting this idea has been provided by studies of proton block of Ca2+ channel currents. In these studies, amino acid substitutions in the EEEE locus were shown to disrupt proton block of Ca2+ channel currents, and the nature of the disruptions could be most readily described by a structural model requiring projection of carboxylate groups into the aqueous pore (11Chen X.H. Bezprozvanny I. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1996; 108: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 12Klockner U. Mikala G. Schwartz A. Varadi G. J. Biol.

For any single residue, steric constraints do not allow main chain carbonyls and side chain carboxylates to project in the same direction, so that the relative orientation of the amino acid chain lining the pore of a channel with a carboxylate-based EEEE locus would differ by ∼180° axial rotation from the orientation of the pore-lining chain in a channel with a carbonyl-based EEEE locus. In contrast to the proposed carboxylate-based ion-binding sites in the selectivity filter of Ca2+ channels, ion-binding sites in the selectivity filter of K+ channels are probably formed by main chain carbonyl groups. Evidence for carbonyl-based binding sites in K+ channels is provided by the x-ray crystallographic structure of a bacterial K+ channel, which has revealed that carbonyl groups of the main peptide chain project into the pore to form K+-binding sites in this channel's selectivity filter (14Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A. Gulbis J.M. Cohen S.L. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R. Science. 1998; 280: 69-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (5743) Google Scholar). The bacterial K+ channel has a signature sequence and pore structure that are closely related to those of eukaryotic K+ channels (15Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar, 16MacKinnon R. Cohen S.L. Kuo A. Lee A. Chait B.T. Science. 1998; 280: 106-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar), indicating that the selectivity filter of eukaryotic K+ channels is likely to be very similar in structure to that of the ancestral bacterial K+ channel. Indeed, before the bacterial K+channel structure had been solved, eukaryotic K+ channels had been predicted to utilize main chain carbonyl groups to form selectivity filter K+-binding sites (15Heginbotham L. Lu Z. Abramson T. MacKinnon R. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1061-1067Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (688) Google Scholar). The K+ channel images are so compelling that the idea that Ca2+ channels, like K+ channels, might utilize main chain carbonyl groups to bind and select permeant ions has become more plausible. Furthermore, the fact that Ba2+ block of K+ channels results from the binding of Ba2+ to selectivity filter carbonyls (17Jiang Y. MacKinnnon R. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 269-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) resonates with this contrarian view of selectivity filter structure in Ca2+ channels because Ba2+ is a divalent cation that binds with high affinity in both K+ and Ca2+ channels. Hence, it is possible that over the course of evolution Ca2+ channels may have preserved features of the selectivity filter structure first evolved in K+ channels and, in particular, the reliance upon carbonyls to form high affinity binding sites for permeant ions. To test these competing descriptions of selectivity filter structure in Ca2+ channels, we have used the substituted cysteine accessibility method to examine whether pore-lining amino acids project side chains into the pore lumen or whether they instead project side chains away from the lumen and into the bulk of the protein (18Akabas M.H.

Cysteine substitutions were introduced into the α1C subunit of an L-type Ca2+ channel using a megaprimer polymerase chain reaction method, as described previously (5Ellinor P.T. Yang J. Sather W.A.

Wild type and mutant L-type Ca2+ channels with a subunit composition of α1Cβ2bα2δ1awere heterologously expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, as described previously (43Sather W.A. Tanabe T. Zhang J.F. Mori Y. Adams M.E. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1993; 11: 291-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In a recently proposed systematic nomenclature, this channel is referred to as α11.2a/β2b/α2δ1a (44Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P.

Oocytes were injected with cRNAs encoding α1C (0.3 μg/μl), α2δ1a(0.3 μg/μl), and β2b (0.8 μg/μl) subunits in a ∼1:1:1 molar ratio. Injected oocytes were incubated for 4–12 days prior to electrophysiological recording. Two-electrode voltage-clamp records of Ca2+channel currents were obtained as described previously (43Sather W.A. Tanabe T. Zhang J.F. Mori Y. Adams M.E. Tsien R.W. Neuron. 1993; 11: 291-303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In the present work, Ba2+ currents carried by Ca2+channels were elicited every 15 s by 150-ms depolarizing test pulses from a holding potential of −80 mV. Currents were filtered at 1kHz (−3dB; 4-pole Bessel filter), sampled at 2 kHz, and leak- and capacitance-subtracted. Oocytes were perfused continuously (∼1 ml/min) with a solution containing 40 mmBa(OH)2, 52 mm tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 5 mm HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 using methane sulfonic acid. Methanethiosulfonate (MTS)1 reagents were dissolved in the 40 mm Ba2+ solution immediately prior to their application (<2 min) via the bath perfusion system, at approximately equi-effective concentrations: 2 mm MTSEA+, 1 mm MTSET+, or 10 mm MTSES− (Toronto Research Chemicals, Toronto, Canada). The effects of a higher concentration of MTSEA+ (10 mm) on WT and the 20 cysteine substitution mutants were indistinguishable from the effects of 2 mm MTSEA+. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–23 °C). Data are reported as means ± S.E., with the number of measurements (n) in parentheses. Fig.1 indicates the locations of each of the single cysteine substitutions introduced into the Ca2+channel selectivity filter (substituted positions enclosed in diamonds). In total, 20 single substitution mutants were made: for each of the four EEEE locus glutamates (position 0) and for all 16 sequence neighbors at their nearest two amino- and carboxyl-terminal positions (−2, −1, +1, and +2 positions). Before testing the action of sulfhydryl-modifying agents, the effects of cysteine substitution on channel function were examined. Voltage-clamp currents were collected for each of the cysteine substitution mutants, and their large amplitudes showed that the mutants expressed well in oocytes. In Fig.2 A, examples of superimposed families of voltage-clamp currents are illustrated for WT and all five of the motif I substitution mutants. For the other 15 mutants, maximum inward currents were comparable in size with those shown in Fig.2 A. Current-voltage relationships constructed from these data showed that both gating and selectivity were altered in some of the mutants. Regarding gating changes, it can be seen in Fig. 2 B that mutant channel activation between −20 and 0 mV was dispersed over a range of ∼10 mV, with the WT data falling in the middle of the range. In addition to the effects on steady-state gating, the kinetics of gating were also affected in some cases; compare, for example, the inactivation kinetics of the M392C mutant with those of WT (Fig.2 A). Overall, however, the effects of cysteine substitution on gating were small in size, and they therefore had little consequence for the study of sulfhydryl modifier action. More significant than altered gating were, for some of the substitutions, the relatively large changes in reversal potential. In motif I, the −1 (M392C) and +1 (G394C) substitutions were virtually identical to WT in reversal potential, the −2 (T391C) and +2 (W395C) substitutions differed from WT by 10–15 mV, and the position 0 substitution (E393C) differed by ∼30 mV from WT (Fig. 2 B). The effects of cysteine substitution on reversal potential are summarized for all of the mutants in Fig. 2 C; the Glu → Cys (position 0) substitutions exhibited the largest reductions in reversal potential, corresponding to the largest reductions in selectivity for Ba2+ over K+. Substitutions at other positions (e.g. T391C) clearly differed from WT in reversal potential, but about half of the substitutions were little different from WT. Selectivity can also be examined by measuring the ability of one permeant ion to block the flux of another permeant ion species, which provides the relative binding affinity for the higher affinity ion. A pairing of Cd2+ and Ba2+ is useful for this purpose because Cd2+ permeates Ca2+ channels but at such a low rate that it blocks the flux of other ions, including Ba2+ (46Lansman J.B. Hess P. Tsien R.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1986; 88: 321-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (431) Google Scholar). For WT and the motif IV substitutions, examples of Cd2+ block of Ba2+ currents and corresponding dose inhibition relationships are illustrated in Fig.3 (A and B). Relative to WT, some motif IV mutants were more potently blocked by Cd2+ (A1447C, +1 position), and others were less potently blocked (W1448C, +2 position). Considering all 20 mutants, half-block (IC 50) values ranged from 0.15 to 1.5 μm, as compared with an IC 50 of 0.6 μm for WT (Fig. 3 C). Thus mutantIC 50 values differed only modestly from the WT value. Cysteine substitution of EEEE locus glutamates did not reduce Cd2+ binding affinity, unlike what has been described previously for aspartate, glutamine, and alanine substitution in the EEEE locus (5Ellinor P.T.

Some cysteine substitution mutants (E1446C and A1447C) even bound Cd2+ more tightly than did WT. The unique behavior of the cysteine substitutions was not surprising, though, because Cd2+ avidly binds to thiol groups of cysteines. Taken together, the effects of cysteine substitution on Ca2+ channel expression, gating, and selectivity were, with the exception of reversal potential for Glu → Cys mutants, rather modest in size. In addition, the increased Cd2+ binding affinity exhibited by some of the cysteine mutants hints that at least some of the tested positions project side chains into the pore and particularly that E1446 projects its side chain into the pore. A more telling examination of side chain orientation was carried out using methanethiosulfonate reagents, which, unlike Cd2+, do not have significant affinity for carboxylate groups. Methanethiosulfonates are sulfhydryl-specific reagents that can covalently modify exposed cysteine residues. The MTS reagents MTSEA+, MTSET+, and MTSES−covalently attach ethylamine, ethyltrimethylammonium, or ethylsulfonate moieties, respectively, to the thiol group on the cysteine side chain. For exposed cysteine thiols in the narrow region of a channel pore, attachment of these moieties can obstruct the flow of ions, so that testing for persistent MTS block provides an indication of cysteine side chain accessibility and, by extension, of side chain orientation in the WT channel. We first examined the action of MTS reagents on WT channels to test for effects via endogenous thiols. Application of the cationic methanethiosulfonate reagent MTSEA+ to oocytes expressing WT channels produced partial block of Ba2+ current (Fig.4 A). WT currents were blocked by 11 ± 1% (n = 9; Fig.5 A), but this block was reversed when MTSEA+ was washed out of the recording chamber (Fig. 4 B, top). Two other MTS reagents, MTSET+ and MTSES−, had similarly small effects that reversed with wash when tested on WT channels (block was 11 ± 3%, n = 8 and 13 ± 1%, n = 8 respectively; Fig. 5, B and C).Figure 5Block by MTS reagents of Ba2+current carried by Cys substitution mutants.

C, fractional block by 10 mmMTSES−, an anionic MTS reagent. Maximum fractional block during MTS reagent application is plotted. For all three MTS reagents, wash readily reversed block of WT, whereas block of the mutants was persistent.

Holding potential, −80 mV; test potential, +20 mV.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Examples of the action of MTSEA+ on each of the four Glu → Cys substitution mutants are also presented in Fig. 4. MTSEA+ blocked nearly all of the Ba2+ current in each of these mutants, but unlike the case for WT, current did not fully recover subsequent to MTSEA+ washout. Modification by MTSEA+ could not be reversed by application of the disulfide reducing agent dithiothreitol (DTT) in three of the four Glu → Cys mutants, but DTT was able to slowly reverse the action of MTSEA+ on the motif IV Glu → Cys mutant (E1446C,bottom panel in Fig. 4 B). It may be that DTT cannot fit into the pore of these latter three MTSEA+-modified channels. Fractional block by MTSEA+ is summarized for all 20 cysteine substitution mutants in Fig. 5 A. The results were similar, but not identical, across the four motifs, with the general pattern within motifs as follows. MTSEA+ block was greatest in size for the mutants at position 0 (Glu → Cys; 94–97% block), followed by that for the mutants at the ±1 positions (45–89% block), and block at the ±2 positions was in most cases smaller yet or nonexistent. The only significant deviations from this pattern were in motif II (+2 position) and motif III (±2 positions). For these three ±2 position mutants, block by MTSEA+ was as large as that observed for the ±1 positions. We tested two other MTS reagents on the cysteine substitution mutants. MTSET+ differs from MTSEA+ in two ways: (i) MTSET+ is larger in molecular diameter (Fig. 1); and (ii) it cannot cross the cell membrane owing to its permanent charge, whereas MTSEA+, a primary amine, spends a fraction of the time in its neutral form and is thus able to cross the cell membrane (47Holmgren M. Liu Y. Yellen G. Neuropharmacology. 1996; 35: 797-804Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Fig. 5 B shows the pattern for MTSET+ block of the substitution mutants. The MTSET+ pattern was similar to that for MTSEA+ in that the Glu → Cys mutants exhibited large fractional block, and the +1 position mutants were sensitive to MTSET+. Also, the +2 position of motifs II and III was sensitive to MTSET+, whereas the +2 position of motifs I and IV was not, just as was observed for MTSEA+. Two aspects of the MTSET+ block pattern differed from that for MTSEA+: no −2 position mutant was susceptible to MTSET+ block, and only one of the four −1 position mutants (motif IV) was sensitive to MTSET+, perhaps because MTSET+ is too bulky to reach and modify these deeper positions or perhaps because MTSET+ cannot cross the membrane to reach these positions. The anionic MTS reagent MTSES− was also tested on the cysteine substitution mutants. The pattern of block by MTSES− was even more restricted than that for MTSET+, but nevertheless, all of the Glu → Cys mutants were blocked by this reagent (Fig. 5 C). The only one of the eight −2 or −1 position mutants that may have been sensitive to MTSES− was the −1 position mutant in motif IV, and the percentage of block of current carried by this mutant was small. Among the eight +1 and +2 position mutants, only those in motif II (+2) and motif III (+1 and +2) exhibited significant sensitivity to MTSES−. Thus MTSES− was able to modify at least some superficial pore entrance positions and all of the EEEE locus positions, but deeper positions were apparently inaccessible to MTSES−. That anionic MTSES− could enter the selectivity filter of a strongly cation-selective Ca2+channel was not anticipated and is considered under “Discussion.” Block that persists after removal of an MTS reagent can in principle be reversed by agents that reduce the disulfide bond that attaches MTS reagent headgroups to exposed cysteine thiols. Within the narrow confines of an ion channel pore, however, disulfide reducing agents may not physically have access to the disulfide bond formed between an MTS reagent and a substituted cysteine. In such cases, persistent block by MTS reagents would not be reversible by a disulfide reducing agent. For Ca2+ channels, this seems to be the case for many of selectivity filter cysteine substitution mutants: 11 of the 20 substitution mutants were blocked persistently by MTSET+, but the disulfide reducing agent DTT was able to clearly reverse modification in only six of these. Of the six mutants whose block could be reversed by DTT, four bore cysteine substitutions at the more superficial +1 or +2 positions in motifs II, III, and IV, and the other two bore cysteine substitutions at positions 0 and −1 of motif IV. Examples of reversibility with 2 mm DTT for four +1 and +2 position substitution mutants are shown in Fig. 6. In these mutants, DTT was able to largely and relatively rapidly reverse persistent block by MTSET+. In addition to the +1 position mutant in motif IV, the 0 and −1 position mutants in this motif were also susceptible to DTT reversal of MTS block. The bottom panels of Fig. 4 showed that persistent MTSEA+ block of E1446C (motif IV) could be slowly reversed by DTT, and similar results were obtained for MTSET+ and MTSES−. MTSEA+ and MTSET+ modification of the adjacent −1 position, G1445C, could also be reversed by DTT, as evidenced by the reversal of block in this mutant during DTT application (not shown). MTSES− did not modify this position and therefore showed no reversal with DTT. It is unclear why DTT has a greater ability to reverse MTS block in motif IV, although one possibility is that this motif is somewhat more externally disposed than are the others. The main finding in this work is that the side chains of the EEEE locus glutamate residues are likely to project into the aqueous pore lumen. Side chains of all residues at the −1 and +1 neighboring positions also project into the pore lu"

Vitamin K administration partially corrects this deficiency. To characterize L394R, we purified recombinant mutant L394R and wild-type carboxylase expressed in baculovirus-infected insect cells. By kinetic studies, we analyzed the catalytic activity of mutant L394R and its binding to factor IX's propeptide and vitamin KH2. Mutant L394R differs from its wild-type counterpart as follows: 1) 110-fold higher K i for Boc-mEEV, an active site-specific, competitive inhibitor of FLEEL; 2) 30-fold lower V max/K mtoward the substrate FLEEL in the presence of the propeptide; 3) severely reduced activity toward FLEEL carboxylation in the absence of the propeptide; 4) 7-fold decreased affinity for the propeptide; 5) 9-fold higher K m for FIXproGla, a substrate containing the propeptide and the Gla domain of human factor IX; and 6) 5-fold higher K m for vitamin KH2. The primary defect in mutant L394R appears to be in its glutamate-binding site. To a lesser degree, the propeptide and KH2 binding properties are altered in the L394R mutant.

Chem. 1976; 251: 5648-5656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a process necessary for the biological activity of these proteins. In addition to the glutamate substrate, γ-glutamyl carboxylation requires carbon dioxide, oxygen, and the essential cofactor vitamin K hydroquinone (KH2), which is the reduced form of vitamin K (6Esmon C.T. Sadowski J.A. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4744-4748Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The formation of Gla from glutamate is coupled with the conversion of vitamin KH2 to vitamin K 2,3-epoxide. Both of these activities occur in the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase (7Wallin R.

Abnormality of the vitamin K epoxide reductase was ruled out because the patients had undetectable serum levels of vitamin K epoxide, and the hepatic vitamin K intake and skeletal development were both normal (18Brenner B.

Because the coagulation activities of these patients were partially corrected by administration of vitamin K and because prothrombin with impaired Gla-mediated calcium binding was identified, a defect in the vitamin K-dependent carboxylase was suspected (16Brenner B.

In this report, we compare the functional properties of the L394R mutant γ-glutamyl carboxylase to those of its wild-type counterpart. Our results indicate that the major defect of mutation L394R is at or near its glutamate-binding site. Furthermore, an augmented allosteric effect between the propeptide- and glutamate-binding sites is observed in the L394R mutant.

The engineered DNA constructs, coding for wild-type and mutant carboxylase, were subcloned into the pVL1392 vector, and the proteins were expressed in baculovirus-infected High Five cells as described (28Stanley T.B.

Cells (8–10 × 108) harvested from 1 liter of a culture were washed with 300 ml of cold buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mmNaCl, and 15% glycerol.

The homogenate was centrifuged at 4300 × g avgat 4 °C for 15 min. The supernatant was recovered and centrifuged at 150,000 × g avg for 1 h. at 4 °C. Solubilization of the microsomal pellet and the subsequent purification of carboxylase using the HPC4 antibody affinity resin were performed as described (28Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J.

Purified carboxylase was analyzed by silver-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (10% polyacrylamide gels; Bio-Rad) and by Western blot analysis. For Western blot analysis, the proteins transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were probed with the anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (1.4 μg/ml) and then with the peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (0.07 μg/ml). The FLAG tag-containing proteins were detected by chemiluminescence following incubation of the membranes with ECL reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and autoradiography on Hyperfilm (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The wild-type and mutant carboxylases were quantitated by dot blot analysis on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes using known amounts of Met FLAG-bacterial alkaline phosphatase as standards. The FLAG tag-containing carboxylase and the standard were detected using anti-FLAG M2 antibody. Quantification was made based on the analysis of autoradiographs using an ImageQuant densitometer (Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). The in vitrocarboxylase activity assays were performed as described (24Wu S.M. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Reactions were performed at 20 °C in 25 mm MOPS, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl, 0.16% phosphatidylcholine, 0.16% CHAPS, 222 μm vitamin KH2, 1.4 mm NaH14CO3(10 μCi), and various concentrations of FLEEL or FIXproGla. In FLEEL carboxylation assays, ProFIX19 at 5 μm was also included. Carboxylations of FLEEL in the presence of 5 μm ProFIX19 were performed as described above, except that unlabeled NaHCO3 was used. FLEEL concentrations of 1 and 12 mm were used in the wild-type and mutant reactions, respectively. Vitamin K epoxide formation was quantitated as described (30Thijssen H.H. Janssen C.A. Drittij-Reijnders M.J. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1986; 35: 3277-3282Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). For the kinetic studies of FLEEL carboxylation, 5 μm ProFIX19 was included. All components used in the assay were premixed except vitamin KH2 and NaH14CO3, which were added to start the reaction. The assays were carried out for 30 min for carboxylation of FLEEL and 1 h for carboxylation of FIXproGla. In vitamin KH2 kinetic studies, the concentration of dithiothreitol was kept constant (6 mm) in all reactions, which were performed for 30 min. The tripeptide Boc-mEEV, containing a modified amino acid (2S,4S)-4-methylglutamic acid, is a strong competitive inhibitor of carboxylase toward FLEEL carboxylation (25Azerad R. Decottignies-Le Maréchal P. Ducrocq C. Righini-Tapie A. Vidal-Cros A. Bory S. Dubois J. Gaudry M. Marquet A. Suttie J.W. Current Advances in Vitamin K Research.

Boc-mEEV was used to compete with 0.8 mm FLEEL for the wild-type carboxylase and with 10 mm FLEEL for the mutant L394R. We examined the effect of the free propeptide on the carboxylation of FIXproGla, which contains a propeptide covalently linked to the Gla domain of factor IX. ProFIX19 was used to compete with 0.5 μm FIXproGla for the wild-type carboxylase and with 4.0 μm FIXproGla for the mutant L394R. The reactions were carried out as described above, using 1 mmof FLEEL for the wild-type carboxylase and 12 mm of FLEEL for the mutant L394R and varying the ProFIX19 concentration up to 2.4 μm. The recombinant wild-type and L394R mutant carboxylase, expressed in baculovirus-infected High Five cells, contain FLAG tags at their amino termini and HPC4 tags at their carboxyl termini. These epitopes, which lie outside the coding region of the carboxylase, facilitate the identification, purification, and quantification of the recombinant proteins. The recombinant carboxylase was affinity-purified using an HPC4 antibody column. The purification method employed provides carboxylase of high purity (Fig.1). The estimated molecular mass of the proteins is around 95 kDa, similar to that reported for the purified carboxylase (32Wu S.M. Morris D.P. Stafford D.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 2236-2240Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed a single antibody-reactive band at 95 kDa in both the wild-type and mutant carboxylase preparations (Fig. 1) and indicates the absence of proteolysis in either preparation. The free propeptide of the vitamin K-dependent coagulation proteins has been shown to enhance the rate of carboxylation of small glutamate-containing peptide substrates that lack a covalently linked propeptide sequence (33Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cheung A. Engelke J.A. Sanders C. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1989; 274: 574-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). We therefore used ProFIX19, the propeptide sequence of factor IX, to compare its effect on the carboxylation of FLEEL by the wild-type and mutant carboxylases. In the absence of the free propeptide, the wild-type carboxylase exhibits significant activity toward FLEEL carboxylation. As shown in Fig.2, the rate of FLEEL carboxylation by the wild-type carboxylase increased 5–6-fold when saturating amounts of ProFIX19 were added. In contrast, mutant L394R showed almost undetectable activity toward FLEEL in the absence of the free propeptide. However, this deficiency can be ameliorated by adding ProFIX19. Compared with its wild-type counterpart, a higher concentration of ProFIX19 was required to achieve maximal stimulation of FLEEL carboxylation by mutant L394R. The concentrations of proFIX19 determined for half-maximal stimulation were 26 ± 3 and 409 ± 27 nm for the wild type and mutant L394R, respectively. These results demonstrate that mutant L394R has a decreased affinity for ProFIX19 when compared with the wild-type enzyme. Kinetic constants for FLEEL carboxylation were determined in the presence of saturating concentrations of ProFIX19 (Table I). As shown in Fig.3, substrate inhibition was apparent at high concentrations of FLEEL. This phenomenon was previously seen in the purified bovine carboxylase (8Morris D.P. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 8735-8742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition occurred when FLEEL concentrations were greater than 9 mm for the wild type and 18 mm for the mutant L394R. All kinetic constants were derived from the Michaelis-Menten equation using data below the inhibitory concentrations of FLEEL. Comparison ofV max for FLEEL carboxylation showed that the reaction rate of mutant L394R was 2.5-fold slower than that of the wild-type (Fig. 3, Table I). The K m of FLEEL for mutant L394R is 6.49 ± 0.72 mm, which is 12-fold higher than that of the wild-type (0.54 ± 0.10 mm). It was impossible to determine the K m of FLEEL for mutant L394R in the absence of the propeptide, even when FLEEL concentrations were increased up to 60 mm, because its activity is almost undetectable under such conditions.Table IComparison of the kinetic parameters of wild-type and L394R carboxylasesSubstrateEnzymeK mV maxV max/K mμmpmol 14 CO2/h/pmol enzymepmol 14 CO2/h/pmol enzyme/μmFLEEL 1-aDetermined at 5 μm ProFIX19.Wild type541 ± 97446 ± 730.87 ± 0.19L394R6490 ± 724178 ± 150.028 ± 0.005FIXproGlaWild type0.23 ± 0.0347 ± 2205 ± 18L394R2.08 ± 0.2398 ± 2048 ± 9Vitamin KH2 1-bDetermined at 1.2 and 10.0 μm FIXproGla in wild-type and mutant enzyme reactions, respectively.Wild type7.0 ± 1.242 ± 36.1 ± 0.8L394R32.8 ± 5.478 ± 82.3 ± 0.5Values were determined as described under “Experimental Procedures.”1-a Determined at 5 μm ProFIX19.1-b Determined at 1.2 and 10.0 μm FIXproGla in wild-type and mutant enzyme reactions, respectively.

Decottignies-Le Maréchal P. Ducrocq C. Righini-Tapie A. Vidal-Cros A. Bory S. Dubois J. Gaudry M. Marquet A. Suttie J.W. Current Advances in Vitamin K Research. Elsevier, New York1988: 17-23Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.4, by fitting the data into the competitive inhibition equation, the K i of Boc-mEEV is 0.013 ± 0.002 mm for wild-type carboxylase compared with 1.44 ± 0.16 mm for mutant L394R. These results revealed a 110-fold difference in the apparent affinities of wild type and L394R for Boc-mEEV. The rate of vitamin K epoxide formation was 20.3 ± 0.5 pmol of KO/min/pmol of mutant L394Rversus 36.6 ± 3.9 pmol of KO/min/pmol of wild-type carboxylase. This 1.8-fold reduction in epoxide formation observed in mutant L394R compared with the wild type carboxylase parallels the 2.5-fold difference observed in FLEEL carboxylation, suggesting that the L394R mutant's carboxylase and epoxidase activities remain coupled (8Morris D.P.

Chem. 1988; 263: 3234-3239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). FIXproGla, a peptide substrate containing the propeptide covalently linked to the Gla domain of human factor IX, mimics the physiological substrate of vitamin K-dependent carboxylase (24Wu S.M. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Stanley T.B. Wu S.M. Houben R.J. Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Carboxylation of FIXproGla by the wild-type and mutant L394R carboxylase follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics. The K m of FIXproGla by wild-type carboxylase was 0.23 ± 0.03 μm, which is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that for FLEEL and is in agreement with previous reports (24Wu S.M. Soute B.A. Vermeer C. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13124-13129Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Hubbard B.R. Jacobs M. Ulrich M.M. Walsh C. Furie B. Furie B.C. J. Biol.

Chem. 1988; 263: 9697-9702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.5 and Table I, the K mof FIXproGla is 2.08 ± 0.23 μm for mutant L394R, which is 9-fold higher than that of the wild-type carboxylase. Interestingly, the V max of FIXproGla carboxylation by mutant L394R was 2-fold higher than that by the wild-type carboxylase. The propeptide of factor IX has been shown to be a competitive inhibitor of FIXproGla carboxylation (28Stanley T.B. Jin D.Y. Lin P.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 16940-16944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 35Stanley T.B. Wu S.M. Houben R.J. Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). To obtain a better estimate of their relative affinities for the propeptide, we compared theK i values of the wild type and L394R mutant for the inhibition of FIXproGla carboxylation by ProFIX19. TheK i values determined for wild-type and mutant L394R carboxylases were 63 ± 13 and 459 ± 28 nm, respectively (Fig. 6). This observed decrease in the relative affinity toward ProFIX19 by the mutant L394R agrees with our results obtained from studies of ProFIX19 activation of FLEEL carboxylation. Since mutant L394R has a higher K m for FIXproGla than that of the wild-type carboxylase (Table I), 10.0 and 1.2 μmFIXproGla were used for mutant L394R and for the wild-type carboxylase, respectively, in this study; the experiment was designed so that the substrates were 5-fold greater than the K m for each enzyme. As shown in Fig. 7 and Table I, the K m of vitamin KH2 was 7.0 ± 1.2 μm for the wild-type carboxylase and 32.8 ± 5.4 μm for mutant L394R. The V max of vitamin KH2 for the carboxylation of FIXproGla was 1.9-fold higher for the mutant L394R than that for the wild-type carboxylase. The purposes of this study were to identify the mechanistic defect of mutant L394R γ-glutamyl carboxylase (16Brenner B. Tavori S. Zivelin A. Keller C.B. Suttie J.W. Tatarsky I. Seligsohn U. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 75: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Brenner B. Sanchez-Vega B. Wu S.M. Lanir N. Stafford D.W. Solera J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to relate the functional properties of the mutant enzyme to the clinical symptoms of patients bearing this mutation. Our data suggest that the major defect of L394R is its ability to bind glutamate-containing substrates. The most convincing evidence for this conclusion is that theK i of the competitive inhibitor of FLEEL carboxylation, Boc-mEEV, is 110-fold higher for L394R than that for the wild-type carboxylase (Fig. 4). Furthermore, our results demonstrate that, in the absence of the propeptide, the catalytic activity of L394R toward FLEEL carboxylation is less than 1% of the wild type's activity. It is striking that saturating concentrations of the factor IX propeptide increased carboxylation of FLEEL by L394R 200–300 times (compared with 5–6 times for wild-type carboxylase). Nevertheless, primarily because of its 12-fold increased K m, the catalytic efficiency (V max/K m) of L394R toward the small substrate FLEEL was, in the presence of propeptide, still 30-fold lower than wild-type carboxylase (Table I). While theK m can only be used as an approximation of substrate affinity, the increased K m for FLEEL is consistent with our results with the competitive inhibitor Boc-mEEV. Thus, the mutation of leucine 394 to arginine results in a striking defect in the catalytic efficiency of the carboxylase toward the small substrate FLEEL. In contrast to FLEEL, the more physiological substrate, FIXproGla, which has 12 Glu residues, has a slightly higher (∼2-fold)V max and a 9-fold higher K mfor the mutant enzyme than for the wild-type γ-glutamyl carboxylase. Other carboxylase mutations with higher V max andK m have been reported (39Sugiura I. Furie B. Walsh C.T. Furie B.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17837-17844Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The increasedV max for the mutant is consistent with our previous suggestions that product release is the rate-limiting step for propeptide-containing substrates (the propeptide of the vitamin K-dependent proteins is the primary binding site for the carboxylase-substrate interaction (35Stanley T.B. Wu S.M. Houben R.J. Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Jorgensen M.J. Cantor A.B. Furie B.C. Brown C.L. Shoemaker C.B. Furie B. Cell. 1987; 48: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar)) and that all carboxylations occur during a single binding event (41Morris D.P. Stevens R.D. Wright D.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30491-30498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Since the assay measures only CO2 incorporation and not complete carboxylation of a 12-Glu substrate, any decrease in peptide affinity can increase theV max, due to an increased off-rate, and may also result in undercarboxylated products. For L394R, FLEEL'sV max is slower because CO2incorporation, rather than off-rate, is the rate-limiting step. L394R also has smaller but significant effects on the propeptide and vitamin K interactions. The propeptide concentration required for half-maximal stimulation of FLEEL carboxylation was 15-fold higher, while the K i for the inhibition of CO2incorporation into FIXproGla by FIX's propeptide was 7-fold higher for L394R than for the wild-type enzyme. L394R's K m for vitamin K was also 5-fold higher than that of the wild-type enzyme. These results seem consistent with previous studies suggesting that the propeptide, vitamin K, and glutamate binding site are functionally linked (33Knobloch J.E. Suttie J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 15334-15337Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Cheung A. Engelke J.A. Sanders C. Suttie J.W. Arch. Biochem.

Haemostasis. 1992; 68: 521-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Thus, while the primary defect in L394R is glutamate substrate binding, linkage of this site to the other substrate sites results in a complex, multifaceted effect on enzyme activity. There are several features of this mutation that make it interesting. First, the mutated residue is one of 20 contiguous amino acids that are identical in human (19Wu S.M. Cheung W.F. Frazier D. Stafford D.W. Science. 1991; 254: 1634-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar), bovine (20Rehemtulla A. Roth D.A. Wasley L.C. Kuliopulos A. Walsh C.T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Kaufman R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4611-4615Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), rat (21Romero E.E. Deo R. Velazquez-Estades L.J. Roth D.A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 248: 783-788Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar), Drosophila(22Li T. Yang C.T. Jin D. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18291-18296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), mouse, whale, toadfish, and chicken (23Begley, G. S., Furie, B. C., Czerwiec, E., Taylor, K. L., Furie, G. L., Bronstein, L., Stenflo, J., and Furie, B. (July 12, 2000) J. Biol. Chem. 10.1074/jbc. M003944200.Google Scholar). Second, the mutation is a drastic one, a hydrophobic residue to a charged residue. This almost certainly means that the mutation is a surface residue. If it were not, we would expect a very unstable protein with little activity. However, mutant L394R is stable and, under appropriate conditions, has substantial activity. Surface hydrophobic amino acids are often found to be important for protein-protein or protein-substrate interactions (43Clackson T. Ultsch M.H. Wells J.A. de Vos A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 277: 1111-1128Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar); therefore, it is likely that leucine 394 is a surface residue that contributes to substrate binding. Thus, although not previously implicated in glutamate binding (44Kuliopulos A. Nelson N.P. Yamada M. Walsh C.T. Furie B. Furie B.C. Roth D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21364-21370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), we postulate that this region of the carboxylase is a functionally important part of the glutamate-binding site. The most interesting question, then, is how to relate our observations on the purified carboxylases to the symptoms of the patients carrying the mutation L394R. The original reports (16Brenner B. Tavori S. Zivelin A. Keller C.B. Suttie J.W. Tatarsky I. Seligsohn U. Br. J. Haematol. 1990; 75: 537-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 18Brenner B. Sanchez-Vega B. Wu S.M. Lanir N. Stafford D.W. Solera J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that vitamin K administration partially ameliorated the patients' bleeding problems. Therefore, we originally hypothesized that the defect in L394R is in the vitamin K interaction. As described here, however, reduced interactions with vitamin K are apparently not the principal defect. As mentioned above, it has been shown that the propeptide of the vitamin K-dependent proteins provides the primary binding site for the enzyme-substrate interaction (35Stanley T.B. Wu S.M. Houben R.J. Mutucumarana V.P. Stafford D.W. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13262-13268Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 40Jorgensen M.J. Cantor A.B. Furie B.C. Brown C.L. Shoemaker C.B. Furie B. Cell. 1987; 48: 185-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). We have also shown that patients who synthesize carboxylation-deficient factor IX, when the vitamin K concentration is reduced by warfarin therapy, have a factor IX propeptide with reduced affinity for the γ-glutamyl carboxylase (45Chu K. Wu S.M. Stanley T. Stafford D.W. High K.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1619-1625Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Furthermore, carboxylation appears to occur processively and, during a single binding event, modifies all of the glutamic acids that will be carboxylated (41Morris D.P. Stevens R.D. Wright D.J. Stafford D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30491-30498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Thus, anything that reduces the affinity of the substrate for the carboxylase will result in a shorter residence time of the substrate on the carboxylase, resulting in its more rapid release and leading, potentially, to partially carboxylated, inactive products. Similarly, anything that decreases the rate of CO2 incorporation may result in the normal residence time being insufficient for complete carboxylation before the product is released. Thus, any mutation that reduces the affinity of the substrate for γ-glutamyl carboxylase or reduces the rate of CO2 incorporation has the potential to result in undercarboxylated products. To understand how the effects listed above might explain the therapeutic efficacy of vitamin K, we examined the effect of vitamin K on the rate of carboxylation at a low FIXproGla concentration, near theK m of the FIXproGla substrate for the wild-type enzyme. It is often assumed that for maximum control of rates, substrates are present in vivo at concentrations near theirK m. Results (Fig. 8) show that, in contrast to high FIXproGla concentrations, L394R has a lower V max than wild-type carboxylase at lower concentrations of substrate, but the activity is increased from a low level to approximately 33% of wild type by increasing vitamin K. Based on our results, we conclude that the effect of vitamin K is merely an increased rate of carboxylation, driving the processive carboxylation of the vitamin K-dependent protein toward completion. After all, vitamin K is the only substrate whose in vivoconcentration can be clinically manipulated. It should also be noted that vitamin K only partially corrects this deficiency, and, consistent with results shown in Fig. 8, the coagulation activity of these individuals remains below the normal range after vitamin K treatment. (18Brenner B. Sanchez-Vega B. Wu S.M. Lanir N. Stafford D.W. Solera J. Blood. 1998; 92: 4554-4559Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) Thus, the defect can be explained by a reduced rate of carboxylation, which is a result of a defective glutamate binding site and increasedK m for vitamin K. This effect would be exacerbated by the apparent decreased affinity of the carboxylase for the propeptide, resulting in a reduced residence time for the substrate on the carboxylase. The combination of these two effects would result in partially carboxylated vitamin K-dependent proteins. In summary, we have presented a plausible scenario to explain the amelioration of the patients' symptoms in response to vitamin K therapy. Our data show that the L394R mutant γ-glutamyl carboxylase has an impaired glutamate-binding site that is more pronounced in the absence of the propeptide. We also note that, to a lesser degree, the mutation affects the propeptide and KH2 binding properties of the enzyme. These apparent defects in binding propeptide and KH2 probably arise because of linkage between different binding sites on the carboxylase. We thank Dr. D. L. Straight and Dr. H. H. Thijssen for critically reviewing the manuscript and Jonathan D'Amore and Dr. Laura Gabiger for editorial assistance."

In addition, it has been shown that the mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and the pulmonary surfactant protein A (SPA) are able to act on C1qRp and enhance phagocytic function of human monocytes in vitro(17Tenner A.J. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Taken together, these findings suggest that C1qRp is a common component of a receptor for C1q, MBL, and SPA, which have been shown to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (18Medzhitov R. Janeway C. Immunol. Rev. 2000; 173: 89-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (1147) Google Scholar). It is now accepted that these “defense collagens” can also bind to apoptotic cells or toxic cell debris and thus would constitute a link between a “nonself” target and macrophages bearing phagocytic receptors (e.g. complement receptor type 3, CR3) (for review see Ref.19Eggleton P. Tenner A.J. Reid K.B.M. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 2000; 120: 406-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). It is possible that the binding of C1q, MBL, or SPA to C1qRp is instrumental in the intracellular signaling and the clearance of invaders or toxic cell debris by phagocytes as part of an efficient innate immune response. Of interest, particularly with respect to the role of C1q in the clearance of potentially toxic cell debris, is the recent finding that C1q-deficient mice show a profound impairment in the removal of apoptotic cells, which then accumulate in the kidney leading to glomerulonephritis (20Botto M. DellAgnola C. Bygrave A.E. Thompson E.M. Cook H.T. Petry F. Loos M. Pandolfi P.P. Walport M.J. Nat. Gen. 1998; 19: 56-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (1256) Google Scholar). In addition, two independent groups have shown that C1q can bind directly and specifically to surface blebs of UV-induced apoptotic cells leading to the activation of the classical pathway of the complement system (21Korb L.C. Ahearn J.M. J. Immunol. 1997; 158: 4525-4528PubMed Google Scholar, 22Mevorach D. Zhou J.L. Song X. Elkon K.B. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 387-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). As yet, the major role of mouse AA4/human C1qRp remains elusive, although it seems likely that signaling through this receptor will lead to enhancement of cellular functions and cell-cell interactions (10Petrenko O. Beavis A. Klaine M. Kittappa R. Godin I. Lemischka I.R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 691-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar,17Tenner A.J. Immunobiology. 1998; 199: 250-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 23Eggleton P. Reid K.B.M. Tenner A.J. Trends. Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 428-431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The simpliest view is that AA4/C1qRp is a critical signaling component of a pattern recognition receptor complex involved in the clearance of target cells opsonized with defense collagens. It is now generally recognized that many protein modules containing part or all of the CTLD motif serve functions other than carbohydrate recognition (12Drickamer K. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 1999; 9: 585-590Crossref PubMed Scopus (532) Google Scholar). Conceivably, it is therefore possible that the CTLD of AA4/C1qRp may well prove to be involved in the binding to target cells through specific moieties yet to be characterized. To gain further insight into the role of AA4/C1qRp, we have cloned the rat homolog of the mouse AA4 and the human C1qRp and characterized its cellular/tissue expression pattern. In this manuscript, we present the full-length cDNA sequence and highlight the modular architecture of rat AA4. Rat AA4 bears a striking domain composition and organization very similar to that of thrombomodulin (TM), a natural anticoagulant membrane protein (for review see Ref. 24Esmon C.T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1477: 349-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Interestingly, rat AA4 was concentrated to sites also known to express abundant levels of TM. AA4 was found on endothelial cells, platelets, and undifferentiated monocytes (ED1+ cells) and, unexpectedly, on all circulating NK cells. Close examination of the immunofluorescent staining pattern, including confocal microscopy imaging of AA4-CHO transfected cells, indicated that AA4 is distributed at the cell membrane (5–30% of the staining) and is also contained within intracytoplasmic components (vesicles). Our understanding of the structure/function relationship of AA4/C1qRp together with that of TM is still in its infancy. Nevertheless, the current perception from this study and previous published observations is that AA4/C1qRp is involved in the enhancement of cell-cell interactions (e.g. phagocytosis and adhesion) leading to an efficient innate immune response against pathogens and toxic cell debris (10Petrenko O. Beavis A. Klaine M. Kittappa R. Godin I. Lemischka I.R. Immunity. 1999; 10: 691-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 17Tenner A.J.

Rat tissues were from adult male PVG obtained from the animal house of the University of Wales College of Medicine (University of Wales College of Medicine, Cardiff, UK) unless otherwise stated. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against rat cell markers were, respectively, from PharMingen (Cambridge, UK): CD3, CD8a, NKR-P1A, and CD45RA, and from Serotec (Oxford, UK): ED1, whereas CD11b/c (clone OX42), Thy1.1 (clone OX7), and ED2 antibodies were used as tissue culture supernatants prepared from hybrydomas grown in house. All the hybridoma cell lines were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. The mouse (clone OX23) and the rabbit anti-human factor H (irrelevant antibody) were generously provided by Dr M. Fontaine (INSERM U519, Rouen, France). Primary cultures of rat endothelial cells were prepared from embryonic PVG rat hearts (18 days postcoitum). Briefly, tissues were dissected and minced with a scalpel in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS). After three washings in HBSS, tissues were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C in HBSS with DNase I (2 μg/ml), 0.025% Trypsin (w/v), and collagenase type III (5 μg/ml). After enzymatic digestion, dissociated cells were resuspended and washed in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated (30 min, 56 °C) fetal calf serum and filtered through a 70-μm nylon sieve. Cells were then plated out at 105 cells/collagen-coated glass coverslip (16 mm in size). The culture medium was changed every day until day 3 when the cells where used for immunostaining. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line (CHO-K1) obtained from the European Collection of Animal Cell Culture (Salisbury, UK) was cultured in F-12 medium. The rat alveolar macrophage cell line (NR8383), kindly provided by Dr. D. P. Ramji (University of Cardiff), was cultured in F-12K medium. Cells were grown in medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 50 units/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 1 μg/ml amphotericin B. All reagents used for cell culture were from Life Technologies, Inc. Cultures were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. Rat leukocytes where isolated from fresh blood (adult male Wistar) as follows. Whole blood (5 ml) in 10 mm EDTA was spun at 1300 × g for 20 min. The buffy coat was harvested and washed in RPMI medium, diluted to 10 ml in RPMI, and then underlayed with 5 ml of Histopaque-1083 (Sigma) and centrifuged for 30 min at 900 × g at room temperature. The leukocyte-containing interface was harvested, washed in PBS/bovine serum albumin three times then standardized to a cell density of 106 cells/ml. Five oligonucleotide primers were chosen within highly conserved regions between the mouse AA4 and the human C1qRp cDNA sequence (Accession numbers AF081789 and HSU94333 respectively) using the DNAstar Software (DNASTAR Inc, Madison, WI). Their sequences from 5′ to 3′ and their positions on the mouse cDNA coding sequence were as follows: 5′-TTTGTTCCTGCTGCTGGGGC-3′ (18 up), 5′-GCTGTGCCTTTTGCCTCTGTAGCCA-3′ (637 up), 5′-CACCACCCACCCAGCTGAAG-3′ (336 down), 5′-ACAGAGGCAAAAGGCACAGC-3′ (637 down), and 5′-TCAGCAGTCTGTCCCTGGTG-3′ (1916 down). Primers were from Life Technologies, Inc. Total RNA was extracted from rat spleen using the UltraspecTM RNA isolation kit (Biotecx, Houston, TX) according to the manufacturer's procedure. An aliquot of total RNA (2 μg) was reverse-transcribed at 37 °C for 1 h in a 30-μl final reaction volume with 60 units of RNasin (Promega, Southampton, UK), 0.5 mm dNTPs (Bioline, London, UK), 250 pmol of random hexamer primers (pdN6; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and 400 units of Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (RT; Life Technologies, Inc.) in the reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 15 mmKCl, 0.6 mm MgCl2, and 5 mmdithiothreitol). PCR was carried out with 3 μl of reverse-transcribed RNA mixture, in a 50-μl final reaction volume with 20 pmol of each AA4 primer (637 up and 1916 down), 0.2 mm dNTPs, and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase in 10× buffer B (Promega). The cycling parameters comprised 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 90 s for a total of 30 cycles, with a final extension cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. All PCR were performed using a Hybaid Omnigene (Teddington, UK) thermocycler. The RT-PCR product of 1.3 kb was purified on agarose gel using the Geneclean® DNA purification kit (Bio 101, Anachem Ltd, Luton, UK) and subcloned into the pGEM®-T vector (Promega). This construct was used as template to PCR amplify a 1.3-kb coding region fragment. The cDNA library was made as described previously (25Akatsu H. Miwa T. Sakurada C. Fukuoka Y. Ember J.A. Yamamoto T. Hugli T.E. Okada H. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 41: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, the library was constructed using the λZAP® II vector and poly(A) lung RNA isolated from rats (Wistar) injected with lipopolysaccharide. The library was plated out onto 12 NZY agar plates (140 mm) to give ∼50,000 colonies/plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C for 8 h, and then duplicate colony lifts were taken from each plate onto Hybond-N nylon membranes (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The membranes were sequentially washed in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 mNaOH, in 1.5 m NaCl and 0.5 m Tris-HCl (pH 8), and then in 0.2 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 2× SSC. Membranes were then air dried on Whatman paper, and the DNA was cross-linked to the membrane using the Stratalinker 2400 UV cross-linker (120,000 μJ of UV energy for 30 s) from Stratagene (Cambridge, UK). Membranes were prehybridized for 1 h in Rapid-Hyb buffer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at 65 °C and then incubated overnight at 65 °C with labeled rat AA4 1.3-kb cDNA probe diluted in the same buffer. Membranes were washed twice in 1× SSC/0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 15 min and exposed on x-ray film (Kodak, Sigma) overnight at −70 °C. Positive colonies were identified by comparison of the colony lifts, and agar plugs (∼10-mm diameter) were taken from these areas on the primary plates. Phages were eluted by incubating the plugs in SM buffer (100 mm NaCl, 8 mm MgSO4, 7H2O, 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.01% (w/v) gelatin) overnight at 4 °C. Eluates (0.2 ml) from 44 positive agar plugs were centrifuged to remove debris. The supernatants were ethanol precipitated, and the pellets, after centrifugation, were resuspended in 10 mm Tris. Phage solutions (20 μl) were PCR amplified as described above using 20 pmol of each 18 up and 336 down primers. The cycling parameters comprised 94 °C for 45 s, 60 °C for 45 s, and 72 °C for 60 s for a total of 35 cycles, with a final extension cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were resolved on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel in 1× Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE buffer). Three original positive phage clones were isolated by secondary and tertiary screening. They were transferred from the UNI-ZAP vector to SOLR bacteria by in vivo excision using the ExAssist/SOLR system (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Bacteria containing the desired phagemid were then grown overnight in 10 ml of LB broth. Bacterial lysates were PCR screened using 18 up and 336 down primers as described above. Positive samples were then selected for further analysis. The phagemid was isolated from the SOLR bacteria using the QIAprep Spin Miniprep Kit (QIAgen Ltd., Crawley, UK) and used for sequencing using an automated sequencer ABI model 373A (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and Prism labeling kit (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). A small AA4 specific cDNA fragment () subcloned into pGEM-T vector was PCR amplified using T7 and SP6 primers. The cDNA was labeled using the Megaprime DNA labeling system and [α-32P]dCTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Unincorporated nucleotides were removed using a ProbeQuant G-50 Micro Column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The probe was denaturated at 95 °C for 5 min before hybridization. For Northern blot analysis, total RNA (20 μg) from various rat tissues (adult male Wistar) were prepared by Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions, heat denaturated for 15 min at 65 °C, and then separated by electrophoresis into 1% (w/v) agarose formaldehyde gel. The RNA was transferred overnight in 20× SSC onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and UV cross-linked to the membrane. The membrane was prehybridized at 65 °C for 1 h in QuickHyb solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized in the presence of the radiolabeled probe at 65 °C. After washing once in 2× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 10 min at room temperature and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS for 15 min at 65 °C, the membrane was exposed to x-ray film (Sigma) for 2.5 days at −80 °C. RT was performed using the same amount (2 μg) of total RNA from each tissue using the protocol as described above. PCR was performed using the following specific primers: 5′-GCCACAGGCAGCCGACTCAT-3′ (rat 1646 up) and 5′-TCAGCAGTCCGTCCCAGGTG-3′ (rat 1913 down). These rat-specific primers were selected on the basis that they will overlap the boundary between exons 1 and 2 as recently described for the mouse AA4 gene. The mouse AA4 genomic sequence (NCBI accession number AF074856) reveals a unique intronic sequence of 248 bp localized at position 1911 on the cDNA sequence (11Norsworthy P.J. Taylor P.R. Walport M.J. Botto M. Mammalian Genome. 1999; 10: 789-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). All samples were subjected to RT-PCR for GAPDH as a housekeeping gene and positive control. GAPDH primers were 5′-GAACGGGAAGCTTGTCATCA-3′ (sense) and 5′-TGACCTTGCCCACAGCCTTG-3′ (antisense). RT-PCR products were resolved into 1% (w/v) agarose gel (containing 25 μg ethidium bromide/100 ml gel) in 1× TBE buffer and visualized under UV light. RT-PCR products were sequenced as described above to assess the specificity. Sense and antisense riboprobes were prepared byin vitro transcription of a rat AA4 cDNA fragment () cloned into pGEM-T in the presence of digoxigenin-11-UTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A test strip was used to confirm the equal digoxigenin label incorporation between sense and antisense probes. Rat lung and heart were isolated and snap frozen in isopentane. Frozen sections were cut on a cryotome® SME (Shandon, Cheshire, UK) and adhered to super-frost glass slides (Surgipath Europe Ltd., Peterborough, UK). Rehydrated sections 12 μm thick were fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 15 min in PBS and washed three times in PBS. Sections were hybridized and developed as described previously (26Coulouarn Y. Lihrmann I. Jegou S. Anouar Y. Tostivint H. Beauvillain J.C. Conlon J.M. Bern H.A. Vaudry H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15803-15808Crossref PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar,27Singhrao S.K. Neal J.W. Rushmere N.K. Morgan B.P. Gasque P. Lab. Invest. 1999; 79: 1247-1259PubMed Google Scholar). The sections were allowed to air dry and then rapidly dehydrated in alcohol, cleared in xylene, and mounted in a neutral mounting medium (XAM) from BDH (Poole, UK). The coding region for rat AA4 was amplified using a 5′-specific primer containing a XbaI site (in bold type) and a 3′-specific primer containing a BamHI site (in bold type). The sequences of these primers were as follows: 5′-GCTCTAGAGAATGGTCACCTCAACTGGTTTGC-3′ (sense) and 5′-CGGGATCCTCAGCAGTCCGTCCCAGGTG-3′ (antisense). The ATG start codon is underlined. The PCR product was subcloned intoXbaI and BamHI sites of the expression vector pDR2ΔEF1-α kindly provided by Dr I. Anegon (INSERM U437, Nantes, France). This vector containing the insert or without insert (vector control) was transfected into CHO using the LipofectAMINE PlusTM Reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Stable transfectants were selected in F-12 medium containing 400 μg/ml of hygromycin B (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 2 weeks and maintained in medium containing 100 μg/ml of hygromycin B. The level of expression of AA4 was tested by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (cell in suspension) and by immunofluorescent staining of adherent cells cultured on glass coverslips (see above). To generate a soluble recombinant form of the rat AA4, a cDNA encoding the first 235 (amino terminus) amino acids of the mature protein including the whole CTLD was amplified by PCR using Pwo DNA proofreading polymerase (Hybaid GmbH, Ashford, UK). The plasmid containing the full-length rat AA4 cDNA was used as a template. Primers used for amplification incorporated restriction sites enabling ligation into the expression vector Signal pIgplus (R & D Systems, Abingdon, UK) following digestion of the PCR product with XBaI andBamHI (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and the vector with NheI and BamHI. Primers were as follows: 5′-TTCTCTAGAGCTGCTGCTGATTCAGAGGCT-3′ (sense) and 5′-TTGGGATCCCTGACACAGAGAGGGCCTGAGCTGC-3′ (antisense). The PCR product was ligated into the expression vector Signal pIgplus according to the manufacturer's instructions, ensuring that it was in frame with DNA encoding the hinge and Fc regions of human IgG1. Expression would result in soluble form of rat AA4 consisting of 235 amino acids, from Ala21 to Val255 (see Fig. 2), linked to the Fc domain of human IgG1 (AA4-Ig). Ligation into the multiple cloning site resulted in addition of five amino acids to the amino terminus of the mature protein (Asp-Lys-Leu-Ala-Arg-). To obtain high level of secretion, DNA encoding the AA4-Fc fusion protein was subcloned into the expression vector pDR2ΔEF1-α. Sequencing of the entire cDNA construct confirmed that no errors had been introduced by PCR. CHO cells were transfected with this plasmid as described above. A stable cell line was generated, and culture supernatant was harvested. AA4-Ig construct was purified from the supernatant by protein A (Prosep A from Bioprocessing, Consett, UK) affinity chromatography, a 0.1m citrate buffer (pH 5) wash was used to remove weakly bound contaminants (bovine Ig present in the fetal calf serum), and fusion protein was eluted using 0.1 m glycine-HCl (pH 2.5). Fractions containing AA4-Ig were pooled and neutralized with 1m Tris. After SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, Coomassie staining was used to estimate the concentration and the purity of the fusion protein. A multiple array, rat AA4 peptide VCGDEAESKTNYYLCKETTAGVFHW (MAP-AA4 peptide) presenting the least homology between the mouse AA4 and the human C1qRp and corresponding to amino acid residues 223–247 (see Fig. 2) was synthesized on a Synergy synthesizer (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). Anti-peptide antiserum was raised in New Zealand White rabbit by repeated subcutaneous immunization (nine in total) with MAP-AA4 peptide (100 μg/immunization) and AA4-Ig (200 μg/immunization) in complete Freund's adjuvant for the first time and followed by incomplete Freund's adjuvant (ICN pharmaceuticals Ltd, Oxford, UK). Contaminant rabbit Abs (anti-bovine Ig and anti-human IgG1 Fc portion) were immunoadsorbed from the antiserum. For this purpose, 10 mg of bovine IgG (Sigma) and 10 mg of human IgG (made in house) were coupled to 4 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), according to the manufacturer's specifications. The antiserum was loaded into this column, and the breakthrough was collected for further purification. Rat AA4-Ig (12 mg) was coupled to 2.5 g of CNBr-activated Sepharose. The rabbit anti-rat AA4 bovine and human IgG free antiserum was loaded into the column at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, specific Abs against the CTLD of AA4 were eluted using 50 mm diethylamine. The eluate was concentrated (final concentration, 100 μg/ml) and buffer exchanged into PBS by ultrafiltration using an Amicon concentrator (Amicon Ltd., Gloucestershire, UK). Mock-transfected or AA4 transfected CHO cells were solubilized on ice for 1 h in 1 ml of lysis buffer (2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 10 mm EDTA, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). An aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of nonreducing sample loading buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8), 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.002% (w/v) bromphenol blue) and subjected to 10% (w/v) SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were Western blotted onto nitrocellulose which was subsequently blocked with PBS containing 5% (w/v) nonfat dried milk (PBS/milk). Blots were probed with the affinity purified rabbit anti-rat AA4 (25 ng/ml) for 1 h at room temperature, washed three times in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBS/Tween), and then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad) in PBS/milk. Following three washes in PBS/Tween, the presence of bound horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary Ab was detected using SuperSignal® West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce and Warriner, Chester, UK) and exposed to x-ray film (Sigma). No bands were detected on blots incubated with secondary Ab only (data not shown). Rat mononucleated cells were prepared as described above. Cells (105/100 μl) were cytospun on super-frost glass slides (Surgipath Europe Ltd) at 500 rpm for 5 min. The cells were fixed in acetone for 2 min at room temperature, washed in PBS, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with primary Ab diluted in PBS/bovine serum albumin. Sections were washed in PBS and incubated for 1 h at room temperature with fluorescein-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG and rhodamine-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson Laboratori"

Whereas the SLP-76 and LAT adaptor proteins are expressed in T, natural killer, and myeloid cells and platelets, BLNK is preferentially expressed in B cells and monocytes. Although BLNK is structurally homologous to SLP-76, BLNK interacts with a variety of downstream signaling proteins that interact directly with both SLP-76 and LAT. Here, we demonstrate that neither SLP-76 nor LAT alone is sufficient to restore the signaling deficits observed in BLNK-deficient B cells. Conversely, the coexpression of SLP-76 and LAT together restored BCR-inducible calcium responses as well as activation of all three families of mitogen-activated protein kinases.

The Src kinases (Lck and Fyn in T cells and Lyn, Blk, and Fyn in B cells) phosphorylate two tyrosine residues within each of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs encoded within the signaling polypeptides of the T and B cell antigen receptors. Phosphorylation of both tyrosines within the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif provides docking sites for the binding of the Syk family of PTKs (Syk and ZAP-70) with the receptor. The localization of the Syk PTKs to the receptor and Src PTKs results in enzymatic activation of ZAP-70 and Syk, which is required for efficient generation of downstream second messengers. In addition to the Src and Syk families of PTKs, the Tec family of PTKs (Rlk and Itk in T cells and Btk in B cells) is also activated following receptor engagement (reviewed in Refs. 4Schaeffer E. Schwartzberg P. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 282-288Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 5Yang W. Collette Y. Nunes J. Olive D. Immunity. 2000; 12: 373-382Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This third family of PTKs plays a requisite role in regulating increases in free cytoplasmic calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) following receptor engagement. The efficient and coordinated generation of a number of second messengers is required for normal lymphocyte function (reviewed in Ref.6Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar). These second messengers include increases in [Ca2+]i and the generation of GTP-bound forms of Ras and Rho GTPases. Increases in [Ca2+]i require the enzymatic activation of the γ1 and γ2 isoforms of phospholipase C (PLCγ1 and PLCγ2), which is mediated, in part, by the tyrosine phosphorylation of these enzymes by antigen receptor-activated PTKs (7Nishibe S.

These calcium transients activate many Ca2+-dependent enzymes, including the calcineurin serine/threonine phosphatase, to control the subcellular localization of the NF-AT (nuclear factor ofactivated T cells) transcription factor. The generation of GTP-bound forms of Ras and the Rho family of GTPases is mediated by a variety of exchange factors (reviewed in Ref. 10Genot E. Cantrell D. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2000; 12: 289-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Recruitment of Sos, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, to the plasma membrane through the Grb2 adaptor molecule results in the generation of Ras-GTP and the activation of the Raf-MEK-ERK pathway. In addition, diacylglycerol can bind and activate Ras-GTP, which, in turn, may couple changes in diacylglycerol and possibly [Ca2+]i to Ras activation (11Ebinu J. Bottorff D. Chan E. Stang S. Dunn R. Stone J. Science. 1998; 280: 1082-1086Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). The Rho family of GTPases is regulated, in part, by the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor (12Crespo P.

Activation of Vav regulates a number of downstream signaling pathways, including the activity of all three MAPK families, [Ca2+]i, and activation of protein kinase Cθ, the latter of which is also required for the activation of NF-κB (13Fischer K.-D.

The assembly of Vav·SLP-76·Nck complexes co-localizes the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor for GTPases with some of its targets, including the Rho GTPase-dependent Pak serine/threonine kinase.

The assembly of these macromolecular complexes may, in turn, provide mechanisms for cross-talk among different signaling pathways for signal integration. Consistent with this model, SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells also demonstrate defects in [Ca2+]i and ERK activation following TCR engagement (36Yablonski D. Kuhne R.M. Kadlecek T. Weiss A.

Similar to the phenotypes of LAT- and SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells, BLNK-deficient DT40 B cells do not increase [Ca2+]i and do not efficiently activate the three families of MAPKs after B cell antigen receptor (BCR) cross-linking (42Ishiai M.

Although BLNK is structurally homologous to SLP-76 (∼33% amino acid homology), BLNK also binds downstream effectors such as PLCγ and Grb2. In T cells, these latter effectors interact directly with LAT. Hence, BLNK is capable of interacting with downstream effectors that bind both SLP-76 and LAT. To test the functional homologies between the T and B cell linker proteins, we examined the ability of the T cell SLP-76 and LAT linker molecules to complement the function of the B cell BLNK protein. Conditions for growth ofBLNK −/− DT40 B cells and JCaM2 and J14 T cells have been previously described (30Finco T. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A.

SLP-76, LAT, and BLNK were subcloned into the pApuro vector and linearized prior to electroporation. Cells were electroporated at 300 V, 960 microfarads, and resistance setting (R9) with a BTX Electroporator. Forty-eight hours following electroporation, cells were selected in puromycin (0.5 μg/ml)-containing medium. Cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline at 108 cells/ml and rested at 37 °C for 15 min prior to stimulation. Cells were stimulated with 2 μg/ml anti-BCR mAb M4 for the indicated time points; quickly sedimented by centrifugation; and lysed at 108 cell/ml in 10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 1% Nonidet P-40 with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described previously (38Fu C.

Cell debris was sedimented by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Clarified supernatants were readied for additional analysis. For NF-AT assays, 107 cells were transfected with 40 μg of the desired cDNA and 30 μg of an NF-AT-responsive luciferase reporter construct. Forty-eight hours following transfection, the cells were incubated with medium alone, medium containing 2 μg/ml mAb M4, or medium containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin as described previously (38Fu C. Turck C. Kurosaki T. Chan A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 93-103Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Cells were loaded with Fura-2 (Molecular Dynamics, Inc.), and fluorescence was monitored using a Hitachi F2000 fluorescence spectrophotometer at wavelengths of 340 and 540 nm according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Cells were rested for 15 min at 37 °C prior to stimulation with soluble mAb M4 (2 μg/ml). Maximal fluorescence was determined following lysis of cells with 1% Triton X-100; minimal fluorescence was measured following chelation of [Ca2+]i with 10 mm EGTA. To determine whether SLP-76 and LAT represent functional homologues of BLNK, cDNAs encoding either SLP-76 or LAT were expressed in BLNK −/− DT40 B cells as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Immunoblot analysis of representative clones of SLP-76 and LAT revealed a spectrum of expression levels. Clones expressing comparable or greater levels of each of these linker proteins compared with the endogenous proteins expressed in Jurkat T cells were selected for further analysis (Fig. 1, Aand B). To examine the functions of both SLP-76 and LAT relative to BLNK, we also generated stable clones that expressed both SLP-76 and LAT in BLNK −/− DT40 B cells. Immunoblot analysis of the representative clones revealed a ratio of expression of SLP-76 and LAT in the BLNK-deficient cells that was comparable to that in Jurkat T cells (Fig. 1 C). Quantitation of actin was performed to control for equalization of protein loading in each lane (Fig. 1, A–C, lower panels). Each of the clones selected for analysis expressed comparable levels of surface BCR expression as judged by fluorescence-activated cell sorter staining (data not shown).Figure 1Expression levels of linker proteins inBLNK −/− DT40 B cells expressing LAT, SLP-76, or LAT and SLP-76.

The SLP-76 expressed in the three representative clones was epitope-tagged with an N-terminal Myc epitope, which accounts for its slower migration compared with endogenous SLP-76 in Jurkat T cells (22Bubeck Wardenburg J. Fu C.F. Jackman J. Flotow H. Wilkinson S. Williams D. Kong G.H. Johnson R. Chan A.C. Findell P. J. Biol.

Cells expressing LAT (clones 5E11 and 7G11) were analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-LAT Ab (lanes 2 and 3). The LAT expressed in the two representative clones was epitope-tagged at the C terminus, which accounts for its slower migration compared with endogenous LAT in Jurkat T cells (lane 1). An anti-actin blot is shown in thelower panel. C, expression of SLP-76 and LAT proteins in double transfectants.BLNK −/− DT40 B cells expressing both SLP-76 and LAT were blotted with an anti-SLP-76 mAb (upper panel), anti-LAT antiserum (middle panel), or anti-actin antiserum (lower panel). Two representative clones (6F7 and 7B9) expressing both SLP-76 and LAT are shown in lanes 2 and 3, and Jurkat T cell lysates are analyzed in lane 1 for comparison.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since BLNK is required for the BCR-induced increase in [Ca2+]i following BCR cross-linking (Fig.2, A and B), we analyzed the ability of the single transfectants expressing either SLP-76 or LAT to increase [Ca2+]i following BCR engagement. Expression of SLP-76 alone inBLNK −/− cells failed to restore BCR-induced calcium responses (Fig. 2, C and D). Analysis of additional clones that expressed up to 4-fold greater levels of SLP-76 as compared with clone 2A2 failed to produce any additional calcium responses (data not shown). Most clones expressing SLP-76 alone demonstrated undetectable calcium transients that were comparable to those of the 2A2 clone, although a small calcium flux (maximal [Ca2+]i increase of 20 nm) was detected in clone 1C4 following BCR cross-linking. Similarly, no tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 was detected in these clones following BCR cross-linking (data not shown). Conversely,BLNK −/− cells expressing LAT gave rise to a BCR-inducible calcium response that was approximately one-fourth of the level in cells expressing wild-type BLNK in all clones analyzed (Fig. 2, E and F; and data not shown). Consistent with this attenuated calcium response, cells expressing LAT alone demonstrated tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 that was significantly diminished compared with cells expressing wild-type BLNK (data not shown). Cells expressing either SLP-76 or LAT alone also demonstrated significantly diminished BCR-induced NF-AT-regulated responses (Fig.2 G). The small degree of receptor-induced response shown for clones 4A10 (expressing SLP-76) and 7G11 (expressing LAT) represented the maximal response observed among the panel of clones analyzed. Experiments using transient transfections of either SLP-76 or LAT cDNAs into BLNK −/− B cells also failed to result in any receptor-inducible activation of the NF-AT-responsive reporter gene (data not shown). Hence, neither SLP-76 nor LAT alone is sufficient to reconstitute the BLNK-mediated calcium or calcium-dependent responses. As BLNK is also required for the efficient activation of all three families of MAPKs, ERK, JNK, and p38 (42Ishiai M. Kurosaki T. Pappu R. Okawa K. Ronko I. Fu C. Shibata M. Iwamatsu A. Chan A.C. Kurosaki T. Immunity. 1999; 10: 117-125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar), we next analyzed the ability of SLP-76 or LAT to regulate these three MAPKs. WhereasBLNK −/− cells demonstrated an attenuated level and kinetics of ERK2 activation compared with cells expressing wild-type BLNK, cells expressing either LAT or SLP-76 alone did not reconstitute ERK2 activation to levels found in cells expressing wild-type BLNK irrespective of the duration of stimulation (Fig. 3 A). Analysis of other LAT- or SLP-76-expressing clones revealed a similar defect (data not shown). In addition to ERK2, we next examined the activation of JNK or p38 (Fig. 3, B and C). Similar to the analysis of ERK2, BLNK −/− cells expressing either SLP-76 or LAT did not reconstitute the activation of JNK or p38 following BCR cross-linking to the levels observed in cells expressing wild-type BLNK. Hence, neither SLP-76 nor LAT alone is sufficient to reconstitute the BCR-mediated activation of any of the three families of MAPKs. Since tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76 and LAT is required for their ability to activate downstream signaling functions (22Bubeck Wardenburg J. Fu C.F. Jackman J. Flotow H. Wilkinson S. Williams D.

Immunol. 1997; 159: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar), we analyzed the phosphorylation status of SLP-76 or LAT in resting and BCR-activated cells expressing either one of these linker molecules. Both SLP-76 and LAT were phosphorylated following BCR cross-linking (Fig. 4, A and B) at levels that were comparable to those observed in Jurkat T cells when normalized for protein expression levels (data not shown). Hence, the inability of either SLP-76 or LAT to restore the functions mediated by BLNK is not merely due to defects in their phosphorylation in theBLNK −/− DT40 cells. Since neither SLP-76 nor LAT alone can restore BLNK-mediated activation of downstream signaling events, we tested whether the combination of SLP-76 and LAT could functionally complement the absence of BLNK. Cells expressing both SLP-76 and LAT demonstrated BCR-induced and sustained calcium fluxes that were comparable to or greater than those observed in wild-type cells (Fig.5 A and data not shown). In addition, the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ2 was restored to levels detected in cells expressing wild-type BLNK (data not shown). Consistent with the restoration of receptor-induced increases in [Ca2+]i, the NF-AT-regulated response was also restored to levels comparable to or greater than those observed in cells expressing wild-type BLNK (Fig. 5 B). The coexpression of SLP-76 and LAT also restored the ability ofBLNK −/− cells to activate ERK, JNK, and p38 following BCR cross-linking (Fig.6, A–C). In fact, the level of activated ERK, JNK, and p38 observed in cells expressing both SLP-76 and LAT was consistently higher compared with cells expressing wild-type BLNK (Fig. 6 B). This increased activation may simply reflect a greater molar ratio of expressed SLP-76 and LAT compared with endogenous BLNK or may suggest that the down-regulation of antigen receptor function by SLP-76 and LAT differs from that regulated by BLNK. Finally, we analyzed the phosphorylation status of coexpressed SLP-76 and LAT. Similar to cells expressing SLP-76 or LAT alone, SLP-76 and LAT were inducibly phosphorylated in cells expressing both SLP-76 and LAT (Fig. 7, A andB). In addition, whereas tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT co-immunoprecipitated with SLP-76 in Jurkat T cells following TCR cross-linking (Fig. 7 A, lane 6), the slower migrating epitope-tagged LAT was also phosphorylated and co-immunoprecipitated with SLP-76 following BCR cross-linking (Fig.7 A, lanes 8 and 10; and data not shown). Together, these data suggest that SLP-76 and LAT together are required to complement BLNK function. Our studies here demonstrate a requirement for both SLP-76 and LAT to complement the absence of BLNK.BLNK −/− cells expressing LAT alone were unable to efficiently increase [Ca2+]i or activate the three MAPK families following BCR cross-linking. However, a small increase in free [Ca2+]i was consistently observed in these LAT-expressingBLNK −/− cells, which is consistent with the attenuated, but measurable, calcium responses observed in SLP-76-deficient Jurkat T cells andslp-76 −/− mast cells following TCR and Fcε receptor type I engagement, respectively (36Yablonski D. Kuhne R.M. Kadlecek T. Weiss A. Science. 1998; 281: 413-416Crossref PubMed Scopus (357) Google Scholar, 45Pivniouk V. Martin T. Lu-Kuo J. Katz H. Oettgen H. Geha R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1737-1743PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, SLP-76-expressingBLNK −/− cells demonstrated a minimal (if any) increase in [Ca2+]i following receptor engagement, which is consistent with the decreased to absent calcium response observed in LAT-deficient Jurkat T cells andlat −/− mast cells (30Finco T. Kadlecek T. Zhang W. Samelson L.E. Weiss A. Immunity. 1998; 9: 617-626Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). In contrast, the coexpression of both SLP-76 and LAT to levels similar to the ratio expressed in Jurkat T cells was sufficient to restore calcium and MAPK responses to the levels detected in cells expressing wild-type BLNK. Since tyrosine-phosphorylated BLNK interacts with downstream effector proteins (including Vav, Nck, PLCγ, Grb2, and Btk) that directly interact with both SLP-76 (Vav and Nck) and LAT (PLCγ, Gads, and Grb2), the studies presented here support the notion that BLNK not only serves as a functional and structural homologue of SLP-76 in B cells, but also encompasses the downstream signaling functions of LAT. In addition to SLP-76 and LAT, Gads, a member of the Grb2 family of adaptor proteins, constitutively associates with SLP-76 and can also bind tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT (25Asada H. Ishii N.

Biol. 1999; 9: 67-75Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). Studies in T cells andin vitro mapping analysis have suggested a role for Gads in linking the LAT and SLP-76 signaling complexes (25Asada H. Ishii N. Sasaki Y. Endo K. Kasai H. Tanaka N. Takeshita T. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Sugamura K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In our studies here, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate tyrosine-phosphorylated LAT with SLP-76 following BCR cross-linking in cells expressing both SLP-76 and LAT. Since Gads protein and mRNA are not detected in DT40 cells (data not shown), the presence of Gads is not absolutely required in these clones. However, the additional expression of Gads inBLNK −/− DT40 cells that coexpress SLP-76 and LAT is able to further augment NF-AT-regulated promoter responses (data not shown). These data are consistent with the notion that Gads can promote the efficient assembly of LAT·SLP-76 complexes following receptor activation (25Asada H. Ishii N. Sasaki Y. Endo K. Kasai H. Tanaka N. Takeshita T. Tsuchiya S. Konno T. Sugamura K. J. Exp. Med. 1999; 189: 1383-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In addition, whereaslat −/− andslp-76 −/− mice accumulate CD4−CD8− double-negative thymocytes and do not develop CD4+CD8+ or single-positive (CD4+ or CD8+) thymocytes,gads −/− mice develop some CD4+CD8+ and CD4+/CD8+thymocytes, although the presence of Gads is required for efficient TCR function. 2C. Pham, Y. Iizuka, J. Yoder, S. Liu, J. McGlade, and A. M. Cheng, submitted for publication. Hence, the pre-TCR, which can utilize either ZAP-70 or Syk to facilitate the transition of double-negative to double-positive T cells, can activate some downstream signaling functions to generate double-negative T cells in the absence of Gads (47Cheng A.M. Negishi I. Anderson S.J. Chan A.C. Bolen J. Loh D.Y. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 9797-9801Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar).2 The ability of the cells described here that express both SLP-76 and LAT to compensate for BLNK in the absence of Gads might also reflect the expression of Gads-related molecules, such as Grap and Grb2, in this system (46Trub T. Frantz J.D. Miyazaki M. Band H. Shoelson S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 894-902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar,48Feng G.S. Ouyang Y.B. Hu D.P. Shi Z.Q. Gentz R. Ni J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12129-12132Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Finally, although the coexpression of SLP-76 and LAT was able to compensate for the absence of BLNK in the DT40 B cell system, the expression of BLNK in LAT-deficient (JCaM2) or SLP-76 deficient (J14) Jurkat T cells failed to reconstitute TCR-mediated calcium and MAPK responses (data not shown). The failure of this reconstitution was, in part, due to the inability of BLNK to be efficiently phosphorylated following TCR cross-linking (data not shown). Furthermore, expression of a membrane-localized form of BLNK was also unable to be phosphorylated or to restore TCR-mediated functions following TCR engagement (data not shown). Hence, it is likely that additional B cell-specific molecules are required to properly localize BLNK to the receptor-activated PTKs for efficient phosphorylation. Preliminary studies suggest that the SH2 domain of BLNK may mediate this localization, 3M. Kelly and A. C. Chan, unpublished data. and additional studies are ongoing to identify the molecules that mediate this interaction."

Cytotoxicity assays reveal that the HBV transfected cells are more sensitive to a wide range of compounds known to be detoxified by GST Alpha conjugation. Although no significant difference in protein half-life between the two cell lines was found, semi-quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction shows a reduced amount of GST Alpha mRNA in the transfected cells. Because the HBV x protein (HBx) seems to play a role in HBV transfection, we also demonstrated that expression of the HBx gene into HepG2 cells decreased the amount of GST Alpha protein. Transient transfection experiments using both rat and human GST Alpha (rGSTA5 and hGSTA1) promoters in HepG2 cells show a decreased CAT activity upon HBx expression, supporting a transcriptional regulation of both genes by HBx. This effect is independent of HBx interaction with Sp1. Treatment with oltipraz, an inducer of GST Alpha, partially overcomes the effect of HBx on both promoters. Promoter deletion studies indicate that oltipraz works through responsive elements distinct from AP1 or NF-κB transcription factors.

Strikingly, the incidence of HCC is even greater in areas where there is also exposure to liver carcinogens such as aflatoxins (6Wild C.P. Jansen L.A. Montesano R. Environ.

Different mechanisms have been suggested as significant in the development of HCC following HBV infection. An activated host immune response and increased production of reactive oxygen species have been shown to be important in triggering abnormal liver cell growth (9Nakamoto Y. Guidotti L.G. Kuhlen C.V. Fowler P. Chisari F.V. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 341-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). In addition, HBV encodes a small protein x (HBx) that seems to play a critical role in hepatocarcinogenesis both in humans and in animal models (10Kim C-M. Koike K. Saito I. Miyamura T. Jay G.

The processes that associate development of HCC with viral infection, HBx biological properties, and the role and action of concomitant exposure to liver carcinogens are still not clear. The glutathione S-transferases are members of a family of detoxification enzymes that metabolize a variety of carcinogens by conjugating lipophilic electrophiles to glutathione. They also bind nonsubstrate ligands including bile acids and bilirubin (27Mannervik B. Adv. Enzymol. Relat. Areas Mol. Biol. 1985; 57: 357-417PubMed Google Scholar, 28Boyer T.D. Vessey D.A. Hepatology. 1987; 7: 843-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The mammalian cytosolic GST isozymes are dimeric and have been divided into seven classes: Alpha, Kappa, Mu, Pi, Sigma, Theta, and Zeta. Alpha GSTs in all species are designated as GSTA1–GSTA5. The human GSTA1 shows a high degree of homology with rat GSTA5. In human and rodent liver, GST Alpha is the predominant form expressed, and GST Pi protein is not found in normal adult hepatocytes. GST Mu is absent in approximately 50% of the general population as a result of a frequent mutation (29Warholm M. Guthenberg C. Mannervik B. van Bahr C. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1981; 98: 512-519Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The fact that GSTs represent as much as 5% of the cytosolic protein in the liver suggests that they may play an important role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. The various GST isozymes have different catalytic activities and patterns of tissue distribution, suggesting that they may be a contributing factor in tissue-specific susceptibility to the carcinogenic process. Some highly reactive chemicals are able to conjugate glutathione directly; however, in most cases the biotransformation of these compounds via phase I activation results in a more electrophilic molecule. For instance, AFB1-8,9-epoxide, the hepatocarcinogenic derivative of AFB1, is detoxified by the formation of a glutathionyl-AFB1 conjugate. Studies with purified rat isozymes demonstrate that this reaction is catalyzed by enzymes containing Alpha class subunits of GST (30Coles B. Meyer D.J. Ketterer B. Stanton C.A. Garner R.C. Carcinogenesis. 1985; 6: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 31Kensler T.W. Enger P.A. Dolan P.M. Groopman J.D. Roebuck B.D. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4271-4277PubMed Google Scholar). The GST Alpha isozyme can be induced by agents such as phenobarbital and oltipraz (31Kensler T.W. Enger P.A. Dolan P.M. Groopman J.D. Roebuck B.D. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 4271-4277PubMed Google Scholar, 32Morel F. Fardel O. Meyer D.J. Langouet S. Gilmore K.S. Meunier B. Tu C-P.D. Kensler T.W. Ketterer B. Guillouzo A. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 231-234PubMed Google Scholar). Oltipraz (4-methyl-5-pyrazinyl-H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione) has been found to have cancer chemoprotective properties (33Kensler T.W. Helzlsouer K.J.

Inhibition of phase I enzymes, induction of phase II xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes, regulation of oxygen reactive metabolites, and enhancement of DNA repair processes are known properties of oltipraz (35Langouet S.

Cillard P. Cillard J. Carcinogenesis. 1997; 18: 21113-22117Google Scholar). Because GST Alpha from human liver is inducible by oltipraz, Alpha GSTs may also reduce the susceptibility to hepatocarcinogenesis by enhancing carcinogen detoxification and elimination (36Swenson D.H. Lin J.K. Miller E.C. Miller J.A. Cancer Res. 1977; 37: 172-181PubMed Google Scholar, 38Primiano T. Egner P.A. Sutter T.R. Kelloff G.J. Roebuck B.D. Kensler T.W. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 4319-4324PubMed Google Scholar). Although much is known about the structure and function of GSTs, little work has focused on the changes that occur in the different GSTs following liver disease. In malignant hepatocytes from clinical specimens, Alpha subunit expression is almost always dramatically decreased. The reduction in expression appears to parallel the cellular transformation process, because adenomas demonstrate intermediary levels of GST Alpha (42Hayes P.C. Portmann B. Aldis P.M. Williams R.

Harris J. Meyer D. Peter S. Ketterer B. Sies H. Carcinogenesis. 1990; 11: 2179-2183Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). This loss of GST protection could increase the susceptibility of preneoplastic populations of hepatocytes to further contribute to genotoxic injury by chemicals during malignant progression. In these studies, we reasoned that HBV transfection could diminish normal cellular detoxification potential, and thus, concomitant exposure to chemical carcinogens would be more likely to contribute to HCC development. We have identified changes that occur specifically in GST Alpha following the expression of HBV gene products in hepatocytes. Furthermore, we have determined the potential of oltipraz to overcome this effect. The human hepatoblastoma cell line, HepG2, and its HBV transfected counterpart, HepG2/HBV (kindly provided by Dr. Wands, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA; Ref. 47Sells M.A. Chen M-L. Acs G.

CCL13 cells are human liver epithelial cells. These cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, and 50 μg/ml of gentamicin. The 293GPG packaging cell line (48Galipeau J.

All cells were maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. Drosophila SL2 cells were cultured in Grace's insect cell culture medium (Life Technologies, Inc.), supplemented with 10% FBS and kept at room temperature. RNA extractions and Northern blot analyses were performed according to standard protocols (49Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). 15 μg of each RNA sample was electrophoresed in 2% agarose/formaldehyde gel at 100 V for 3 h, followed by transfer onto Zeta-Probe membrane (Bio-Rad). An EcoRI fragment of pGEM-adw2 containing the entire HBV viral genome was radiolabeled with [α-32P]dCTP by random primer extension (Oligo Labeling Kit; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and used as probe. Hybridization was carried out at 42 °C using 50% formamide, 4× SSC, 4× Denhardt's reagent, 1.2% SDS, and 0.2 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. Final washes of blots were done with 2× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 65 °C. The same membrane was reprobed with β-actin cDNA to control for sample loading and transfer efficiency. The turnover of GST Alpha was measured in exponentially growing HepG2 and HepG2/HBV cultures. Cells were incubated in complete medium supplemented with 150 μg/ml cycloheximide (ICN Biomedicals Inc., Mississauga, Canada) for 2, 4, 8, and 10 h. Following these time periods the cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed by resuspending them in 1 ml of lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 60 mm KCl, 1 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 μg/ml pepstatin, 0.5 μg/ml aprotinin/4 × 107 cells). Cytosolic extracts from the various cell lines were prepared by cell lysis and centrifugation of debris at 12,000 × g for 1 h. Protein concentrations were determined according to the method of Lowry, using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Total GST activity was assayed using 2-chloro-1,3-dinitrobenzene as the substrate (43Stalker M.J. Kocal T.E. Quinn B.A. Gordon S.G. Hayes M.T. Hepatology. 1994; 20: 149-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Selenium-independent glutathione peroxidase activity was assayed using cumene hydroperoxide (44Howie A.F. Forrester L.M.

Cells were plated in 100 μl of medium at a concentration of 2–10 × 103 cells/flat bottomed well in 96-well microtiter plates that were incubated for 24 h at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. 100 μl of medium containing drug dissolved in appropriate solvent were added to triplicate wells and incubated for a further 72 h. Medium (180 μl) was then removed from each well and replaced by 150 μl of medium containing 10 mm 1,4-piperazinediethane sulfonic acid, pH 7.4, and 50 ml of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (Sigma) at 2 mg/ml in PBS. Plates were then wrapped in aluminum foil and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C. The formazan crystals were dissolved in 180 μl of dimethyl sulfoxide (Fisher) and 25 μl glycine buffer (0.1 m glycine, 0.1 m NaCl, pH 10.5) by mixing on a shaker for 5 min. The formazan product formed by viable cells was then quantitated by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 570 nm on a microtiter plate reader. IC50 was determined by plotting the percentage of surviving cellsversus the log of drug concentration. Statistical analysis was performed using Student's t test for paired samples. The expression vectors for the HBx protein used in this study were: pCMV-HBx, consisting of the HBx gene from the HBV ayw subtype (nucleotides 1241–1991) ligated into theHindIII site of the pRc-CMV vector (Invitrogen, La Jolla, CA).

The pRc-CMV plasmid was used as a negative control and referred to as pRc-CMV. pAP2 is a retroviral expression vector encoding for a bicistronic nonsplicing retrovector that incorporates a multiple cloning sites, allowing insertion of sequences, linked by an IRES to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter.

Virol. 1995; 69: 1851-1859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was subcloned into the XhoI-BamHI sites of the pAP2 vector and referred to as pAP2-HBx. The pAP2 vector was used as a negative control. Retroviral producer cell lines were generated for both pAP2 and pAP2-HBx by stably transfecting the 293GPG packaging cell line (48Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2383-2394Google Scholar). VSVG pseudotyped retroparticles were collected as described (48Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J.

Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2383-2394Google Scholar) using LipofectAMINE according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Life Technologies, Inc.). Selection for cells stably transfected with pAP2 or pAP2-HBx was performed in 3 weeks in 293 cell medium containing 100 μg/ml of Zeocin (Invitrogen). Fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis was performed to determine the percentage of producer cells that expressed the GFP reporter protein. Cells expressing GFP were selected using a fluorescence-activated cell sorter STAR PLUS TURBO (530–30; FL-1) cell sorter and immediately frozen or kept in culture. When cells reached 60% confluence, the selection medium was removed and replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, penicillin, and streptomycin (50 units/ml and 50 μg/ml, respectively). Three days after tetracyclin withdrawal, the supernatant was collected, filtered, and frozen daily for 6–7 days. Supernatants were thawed and pooled, and retroviral particles AP2 and AP2-HBx were concentrated 20–30 times (v/v) by ultracentrifugation as described (48Galipeau J. Li H. Paquin A. Sicilia F. Karpati G. Nalbantoglu J. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 2383-2394Google Scholar). Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to the method of Laemmli using a 4% polyacrylamide stacking gel layered over a 12% resolving gel. 25 μg of cytosolic protein from HepG2 and HepG2/HBV, treated with 45 μ moltipraz for 36 h and left untreated, were run at 100 V and transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane by electroblotting at 15 V for 16 h. The membranes were blocked with 10% bovine serum albumin/PBS and incubated overnight in 0.5% bovine serum albumin containing a 1:3000 dilution of polyclonal rabbit antiserum directed against human GSTA1 (kindly provided by Dr. A. J. Townsend, Bowman Gray School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC). The membranes were blocked with 10% low fat milk in PBS and incubated overnight with the corresponding antibody. Enhanced chemiluminescence detection was performed using ECL detection reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Blots were subsequently stripped in 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 2% SDS, 62.5 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.7, 50 °C for 30 min and then immunoblotted with monoclonal anti-GAPDH (clone 6C5, Cedarlane Laboratories, Hornby, Ontario, Canada). Densitometric analysis was performed using a Hoefer scanning densitometer, model GS300 (Hoefer Scientific, San Francisco, CA). Total RNA was isolated from HepG2 and HepG2/HBV treated and untreated with 45 μm oltipraz for 36 h, using the RNeasy Total RNA Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Chastworth, CA). The RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I and further cleaned (RNeasy Total RNA kit). Each RNA sample (1 μg) was reverse transcribed using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) and oligo(dT) primer for 1 h at 37 °C. PCR amplification of hGSTA1 and GAPDH cDNAs were performed using 50 pmol of each primer, 5 μCi of [α-32P]dCTP, and 2.5 units of Taqpolymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The appropriate cDNA volumes were 1100 for hGSTA1 and 15000 for GAPDH. These dilutions were determined to be in a linear range of each standard curve. Samples were run on a 10% acrylamide gel dried and exposed. The quantification was performed using the Bio-Rad Gelscan Phosphoimager and the Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) software program. The primer sequences for GAPDH are 5′-ccatggagaaggctgggg-3′ (forward) and 5′-caaagttgtcatggatgacc-3′ (reverse); and those for hGSTA1 are 5′-cgtgatggactccggtgacggg-3′ (forward) and 5′-gatggagttgaaggtagtttcgtg-3′ (reverse). Cells were seeded at 2.7 × 105 cells/35-mm-diameter dish using 6-well plates and grown overnight in the appropriate media. The following day, the cells were transiently transfected, using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) with hGSTA1-CAT or rGSTA5-CAT together with pCMV-HBx or pRc-CMV. As controls, pERE3-CAT was co-transfected with pCMV-HBx or pRc-CMV. LipofectAMINE was used at a concentration of 3 μg/1 μg of DNA. pRc-CMV was added to equalize the amount of DNA transfected in each well when necessary. Cells were incubated with DNA-LipofectAMINE complexes for 6 h, after which cells were washed gently and cultured in fresh serum-supplemented medium. When treatment with oltipraz was performed, 16 h after transfection oltipraz was added at a final concentration of 45 μm/well. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection, and protein extracts were used to determine CAT activity as described (53Fotouhi-Ardakani N. Schecter R.L. Batist G. Mol. Biol. Evol. 2000; 17: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). The quantification of the reaction products in the CAT assay was performed using the Bio-Rad Gelscan Phosphoimager and the Molecular Analyst (Bio-Rad) software program. The percentage of chloramphenicol conversion to its acetylated metabolites was determined for each sample in at least three independent experiments. For CAT assay, 8 × 105cells/35-mm-diameter dish were plated and grown overnight in appropriate medium. The following day, cells were transiently transfected with pERE3-CAT reporter plasmid (1 μg/well) as described above. After 6 h of incubation with LipofectAMINE-DNA complexes, medium was removed, and cells were transduced with 20× concentrated retroviral supernatant obtained from pAP2 or pAP2-HBx 293GPG producer cells and 1 μg/μl of Polybrene (Sigma). Samples were collected 24 h later, and CAT assays were performed as described above. For immunoblot analysis and RT-PCR, cells were plated at a concentration of 1 × 106 cells/35 mm plate and transduced the following day with concentrated viral supernatant. A final concentration of 1 μg/μl of Polybrene (Sigma) was added to each well. Cells were harvested 24 h later, and 5 × 105 cells were resuspended in the appropriate medium to quantify GFP expression by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. The remaining cells were used either to isolate total RNA for RT-PCR or whole cell extract for immunoblot analysis. Total cell extracts from cells transduced with AP2 and AP2-HBx retroviral particles were used to examine the expression of the endogenous hGSTA1 protein by Western blot analysis as described above. The expression of hGSTA1 mRNA was evaluated by semiquantitative RT-PCR. Isolation of total RNA and reverse transcription was performed as described above.

In this study, we demonstrate that autophosphorylation of the recombinant Src family kinase Hck leads to a 20-fold increase in its specific enzymatic activity. Hck was found to autophosphorylate readily to a stoichiometry of 1.3 mol of phosphate per mol of enzyme, indicating that the kinase autophosphorylated at more than one site. Solid phase sequencing and two-dimensional mapping of the phosphopeptide fragments derived from the autophosphorylated enzyme revealed that the kinase can undergo autophosphorylation at the following two sites: (i) Tyr-388, which is located to the consensus autophosphorylation site commonly found in the activation loop of many protein kinases, and (ii) Tyr-29, which is located in the unique domain of Hck. Hck purified from mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages could also autophosphorylate in vitro at both Tyr-388 and Tyr-29, indicating that naturally occurring Hck can also autophosphorylate at Tyr-29. Furthermore, Hck transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells was found to be phosphorylated at Tyr-29 and Tyr-388, proving that Hck can also undergo autophosphorylation at both sitesin vivo. The recombinant enzyme carrying the mutation of Tyr-388 to Phe was also able to autophosphorylate at Tyr-29, albeit at a significantly slower rate. A 2-fold increase in the specific enzymatic activity was seen with this mutant despite the stoichiometry of autophosphorylation only approaching 0.2 mol of phosphate per mol of enzyme. This indicates that autophosphorylation of Tyr-29 contributes significantly to the activation of Hck.

Biol. 1997; 13: 513-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (2145) Google Scholar for review). The catalytic activity of the Src family kinases is indispensable to their ability to carry out their cellular functions. Members of the Src family kinases share the same overall structural organization of domains as follows: (i) an N-terminal fatty acid-acylation domain, (ii) a unique domain, (iii) a Src homology 3 (SH3)1 domain, (iv) a Src homology 2 (SH2) domain, (v) a catalytic domain, and (vi) a C-terminal regulatory domain. Phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue within the C-terminal regulatory domain of Src family kinases by another protein tyrosine kinase called the C-terminal Src kinase (CSK) or its cellular homologue (Chk) leads to inactivation of the kinase. In contrast, autophosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine residue within the kinase domain leads to activation. The recently determined crystal structures for Src and Hck provide the structural basis for the inactivation of Src family kinases by phosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue (3Sicheri F. Moarefi I. Kuriyan J. Nature. 1997; 385: 602-609Crossref PubMed Scopus (1041) Google Scholar, 4Xu W. Harrison S.C. Eck M.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 7261-7271Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The inactive conformation of Src or Hck is stabilized by a tripartite intramolecular interaction involving binding of the phosphorylated C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue to the SH2 domain, and binding of the SH3 domain to a linker sequence between the SH2 and catalytic domains (SH2-CD linker) of the kinase that is capable of adopting a poly-proline type II helical conformation. Such interactions impart conformational constraints on the kinase domain such that it is unable to bind ATP, thus maintaining the enzyme in an inactive conformation. Activation of the enzyme may be achieved either by dephosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine residue (Tyr-499 in murine Hck) by a tyrosine phosphatase, engagement of the SH2 domain by a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein, or binding of the SH3 domain to a specific PXXP motif-containing cellular protein (7Moarefi I.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).In addition to regulating the catalytic activity, the SH2 and SH3 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases are also involved in mediating their physical association with other proteins (8Songyang Z.

Such interactions are important for association of the kinases with substrates and targeting the kinases to their specific subcellular localizations.The unique domain is also implicated as contributing significantly to the differences in regulatory properties and functions of the Src family kinases, as it is the region of the enzymes containing most sequence variation between different Src family members. The unique domain of Lck, for example, mediates its interaction with the transmembrane receptor-like proteins CD4 and CD8 in T-lymphocytes (11Campbell K.S. Buder A. Deuschle U. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2391-2408Google Scholar). The unique domain of Src can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (12Roth C., W. Richert N.D. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10768-10773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C (13Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Cooper J.A. Buss J.E. Shallaway D. Hunter T.

Cell. 1989; 57: 775-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) under various conditions. The functional significance of phosphorylation by these serine/threonine kinases is not yet known, although phosphorylation by p34Cdc2 was suggested to enhance activation by dephosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine of Src by the upstream protein tyrosine phosphatase (29Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).In this paper, we report that autophosphorylation of Hck occurs at a novel site in addition to the consensus autophosphorylation site at Tyr-388 2The numbering system for the amino acid residue is based upon the sequence of the 56-kDa isoform of mouse Hck (GenBankTM accession number NM010407) with the novel autophosphorylation site, the consensus autophosphorylation site, and the C-terminal regulatory phosphorylation being Tyr-29, Tyr-388, and Tyr-499, respectively. For the 59-kDa isoform, these phosphorylation sites correspond to Tyr-50, Tyr-409, and Tyr-520.2The numbering system for the amino acid residue is based upon the sequence of the 56-kDa isoform of mouse Hck (GenBankTM accession number NM010407) with the novel autophosphorylation site, the consensus autophosphorylation site, and the C-terminal regulatory phosphorylation being Tyr-29, Tyr-388, and Tyr-499, respectively. For the 59-kDa isoform, these phosphorylation sites correspond to Tyr-50, Tyr-409, and Tyr-520. of the activation loop of the catalytic domain (27Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). This novel site is identified to be Tyr-292 in the unique domain. Autophosphorylation of Tyr-29 and Tyr-388 is shown to follow an intermolecular mechanism. Analysis of the activities and stoichiometric levels of phosphorylation of recombinant Hck mutants, containing a Tyr to Phe mutation at either Tyr-388 or Tyr-29, showed that phosphorylation at Tyr-29 contributes to the activation of Hck by autophosphorylation. In vitroautophosphorylation of Tyr-29 in Hck isolated from macrophages andin vivo phosphorylation of Tyr-29 in Hck overexpressed in the human embryonic kidney 293T cells were also demonstrated, indicating that autophosphorylation of Tyr-29 in Hck is of physiological significance.DISCUSSIONThe recent study by Moarefi et al. (7Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 629-653Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar), showing activation of Hck by SH3 domain displacement, used a truncated form of Hck without the fatty acid acylation domain and unique domain. As such, they would only have noticed phosphorylation at Tyr-388, and phosphorylation at Tyr-29 of the unique domain would have gone unnoticed. The use of intact recombinant Hck and Hck isolated from macrophages enabled us to demonstrate autophosphorylation of Hck at both Tyr-29 and Tyr-388. More importantly, our demonstration of thein vivo phosphorylation of Hck at Tyr-29 indicates that phosphorylation of this novel site is of physiological significance. Furthermore, evidence supporting the notion that phosphorylation at Tyr-29 may contribute to the regulation of catalytic activity is provided in Fig. 6. Since activation of protein kinases by autophosphorylation normally results from phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine and/or a threonine residue in the activation loop or the kinase domain, activation of Hck by phosphorylation of Tyr-29 in the unique domain may represent a new and novel mechanism of activation of protein kinases (27Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the structural basis of activation of Hck by Tyr-29 phosphorylation may reveal this new activation mechanism.The modulation of catalytic activity of Hck by phosphorylation at Tyr-29 shows that there must be some cross-talk between the unique and catalytic domains. As the recent crystal structure determination of Hck also used the truncated mutant excluding the unique domain, it is not known how phosphorylation at Tyr-29 may impart conformational change such that catalytic activity may be enhanced. From the known structural data of Hck, it is likely that the unique domain makes contact with the SH3 and/or the catalytic domain. Therefore, it is possible that phosphorylation at Tyr-29 may produce structural changes in the unique domain which is then transmitted to either or both of these domains. As Moarefi et al. (7Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 629-653Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar) have shown, displacement of the SH3 domain from the SH2 kinase domain linker serves to activate the kinase, which is likely to occur through providing for rotation of the α-C helix such that ion pairing occurs between Glu-303 and Lys-288. Consequently, ATP binding is made feasible which in turn allows for autophosphorylation to occur. It is possible that phosphorylation at Tyr-29 may impart conformational change to the SH3 domain that will further destabilize the tripartite interactions among the SH3 domain, the SH2-CD linker, and the catalytic domain. As the enzyme can be visualized as being in a fluid state of conformational equilibrium, such a change may act to move the equilibrium more toward the active conformation.Phosphorylation at Tyr-29 of the isolated recombinant unique domain of Hck by full-length Hck is shown to occur with low efficiency (Fig. 13). It is likely that the unique domain must be situated in the context of the intact enzyme to provide for the structural requirements for efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-29. It may be that the intermolecular interaction between two molecules allowing for the autophosphorylation of Tyr-388 places the unique domain in the correct structural alignment for the efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-29. Activation of the enzyme by autophosphorylation at the consensus site would further increase the propensity for phosphorylation at Tyr-29. Alternatively, interactions made with the unique domain by adjacent domains such as the SH3 and catalytic domains may provide for enhanced affinity of Tyr-29 for the active site of Hck.Interestingly, upon sequence comparison between different Src family kinases, the YXXDPT motif corresponding to29YVPDPT in murine Hck was found to occur also in Lyn (32YVRDPT), Fgr (32YYPDPT), Fyn (29YGTDPT), and Yrk (29YDPDPT). As this motif is repeated several times in the Src family of kinases and occurs at either residue number 29 or 32 in each case, it may be of general regulatory significance for the members in which it occurs.Similar to most tyrosine phosphorylation sites in protein tyrosine kinases, the phospho-Tyr-29 may also act as a docking site for specific cellular proteins containing SH2 and/or protein tyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. Comparison of the sequence around phospho-Tyr-29 with those of known SH2 domain and PTB domain binding motifs does not reveal any significant homology. Some degree of homology can be found between the GPVpY29 sequence and the consensus NPXpY motif recognized by the Shc PTB domain (28van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K. Stephens R. White M.F. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the Shc PTB domain bound to the ligand reveals that the conserved Pro residue is essential for the formation of the β-turn recognized by the Shc PTB domain. As the GPVpY29 motif of Hck is predicted to have a propensity to form a β-turn, it is possible that this motif is the docking site of an as yet to be identified PTB domain. Elucidation of the cellular functions of the phosphorylation of Tyr-29 in addition to modulation of activity awaits the isolation and identification of the putative cellular protein(s) which selectively bind to the sequence around Tyr-29. The Src family of protein tyrosine kinases consists of nine members documented to participate in a variety of cellular functions such as cellular growth and differentiation (see Refs. 1Courtneidge S.A.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In addition to regulating the catalytic activity, the SH2 and SH3 domains of Src family tyrosine kinases are also involved in mediating their physical association with other proteins (8Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W., G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley C.

Such interactions are important for association of the kinases with substrates and targeting the kinases to their specific subcellular localizations. The unique domain is also implicated as contributing significantly to the differences in regulatory properties and functions of the Src family kinases, as it is the region of the enzymes containing most sequence variation between different Src family members. The unique domain of Lck, for example, mediates its interaction with the transmembrane receptor-like proteins CD4 and CD8 in T-lymphocytes (11Campbell K.S. Buder A. Deuschle U. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 2391-2408Google Scholar). The unique domain of Src can be phosphorylated by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (12Roth C., W. Richert N.D. Pastan I. Gottesman M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 10768-10773Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), protein kinase C (13Gould K.L. Woodgett J.R. Cooper J.A. Buss J.E. Shallaway D. Hunter T.

Cell. 1989; 57: 775-786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) under various conditions. The functional significance of phosphorylation by these serine/threonine kinases is not yet known, although phosphorylation by p34Cdc2 was suggested to enhance activation by dephosphorylation of the C-terminal regulatory tyrosine of Src by the upstream protein tyrosine phosphatase (29Zheng X.-M. Resnick R.J. Shalloway D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 964-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report that autophosphorylation of Hck occurs at a novel site in addition to the consensus autophosphorylation site at Tyr-388 2The numbering system for the amino acid residue is based upon the sequence of the 56-kDa isoform of mouse Hck (GenBankTM accession number NM010407) with the novel autophosphorylation site, the consensus autophosphorylation site, and the C-terminal regulatory phosphorylation being Tyr-29, Tyr-388, and Tyr-499, respectively. For the 59-kDa isoform, these phosphorylation sites correspond to Tyr-50, Tyr-409, and Tyr-520.2The numbering system for the amino acid residue is based upon the sequence of the 56-kDa isoform of mouse Hck (GenBankTM accession number NM010407) with the novel autophosphorylation site, the consensus autophosphorylation site, and the C-terminal regulatory phosphorylation being Tyr-29, Tyr-388, and Tyr-499, respectively. For the 59-kDa isoform, these phosphorylation sites correspond to Tyr-50, Tyr-409, and Tyr-520. of the activation loop of the catalytic domain (27Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). This novel site is identified to be Tyr-292 in the unique domain. Autophosphorylation of Tyr-29 and Tyr-388 is shown to follow an intermolecular mechanism. Analysis of the activities and stoichiometric levels of phosphorylation of recombinant Hck mutants, containing a Tyr to Phe mutation at either Tyr-388 or Tyr-29, showed that phosphorylation at Tyr-29 contributes to the activation of Hck by autophosphorylation. In vitroautophosphorylation of Tyr-29 in Hck isolated from macrophages andin vivo phosphorylation of Tyr-29 in Hck overexpressed in the human embryonic kidney 293T cells were also demonstrated, indicating that autophosphorylation of Tyr-29 in Hck is of physiological significance. DISCUSSIONThe recent study by Moarefi et al. (7Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 629-653Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar), showing activation of Hck by SH3 domain displacement, used a truncated form of Hck without the fatty acid acylation domain and unique domain. As such, they would only have noticed phosphorylation at Tyr-388, and phosphorylation at Tyr-29 of the unique domain would have gone unnoticed. The use of intact recombinant Hck and Hck isolated from macrophages enabled us to demonstrate autophosphorylation of Hck at both Tyr-29 and Tyr-388. More importantly, our demonstration of thein vivo phosphorylation of Hck at Tyr-29 indicates that phosphorylation of this novel site is of physiological significance. Furthermore, evidence supporting the notion that phosphorylation at Tyr-29 may contribute to the regulation of catalytic activity is provided in Fig. 6. Since activation of protein kinases by autophosphorylation normally results from phosphorylation of a conserved tyrosine and/or a threonine residue in the activation loop or the kinase domain, activation of Hck by phosphorylation of Tyr-29 in the unique domain may represent a new and novel mechanism of activation of protein kinases (27Johnson L.N. Noble M.E. Owen D.J. Cell. 1996; 85: 149-158Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1160) Google Scholar). Elucidation of the structural basis of activation of Hck by Tyr-29 phosphorylation may reveal this new activation mechanism.The modulation of catalytic activity of Hck by phosphorylation at Tyr-29 shows that there must be some cross-talk between the unique and catalytic domains. As the recent crystal structure determination of Hck also used the truncated mutant excluding the unique domain, it is not known how phosphorylation at Tyr-29 may impart conformational change such that catalytic activity may be enhanced. From the known structural data of Hck, it is likely that the unique domain makes contact with the SH3 and/or the catalytic domain. Therefore, it is possible that phosphorylation at Tyr-29 may produce structural changes in the unique domain which is then transmitted to either or both of these domains. As Moarefi et al. (7Moarefi I. LaFevre-Bernt M. Sicheri F. Huse M. Lee C.-H. Kuriyan J. Miller W.T. Nature. 1997; 385: 629-653Crossref Scopus (536) Google Scholar) have shown, displacement of the SH3 domain from the SH2 kinase domain linker serves to activate the kinase, which is likely to occur through providing for rotation of the α-C helix such that ion pairing occurs between Glu-303 and Lys-288. Consequently, ATP binding is made feasible which in turn allows for autophosphorylation to occur. It is possible that phosphorylation at Tyr-29 may impart conformational change to the SH3 domain that will further destabilize the tripartite interactions among the SH3 domain, the SH2-CD linker, and the catalytic domain. As the enzyme can be visualized as being in a fluid state of conformational equilibrium, such a change may act to move the equilibrium more toward the active conformation.Phosphorylation at Tyr-29 of the isolated recombinant unique domain of Hck by full-length Hck is shown to occur with low efficiency (Fig. 13). It is likely that the unique domain must be situated in the context of the intact enzyme to provide for the structural requirements for efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-29. It may be that the intermolecular interaction between two molecules allowing for the autophosphorylation of Tyr-388 places the unique domain in the correct structural alignment for the efficient phosphorylation of Tyr-29. Activation of the enzyme by autophosphorylation at the consensus site would further increase the propensity for phosphorylation at Tyr-29. Alternatively, interactions made with the unique domain by adjacent domains such as the SH3 and catalytic domains may provide for enhanced affinity of Tyr-29 for the active site of Hck.Interestingly, upon sequence comparison between different Src family kinases, the YXXDPT motif corresponding to29YVPDPT in murine Hck was found to occur also in Lyn (32YVRDPT), Fgr (32YYPDPT), Fyn (29YGTDPT), and Yrk (29YDPDPT). As this motif is repeated several times in the Src family of kinases and occurs at either residue number 29 or 32 in each case, it may be of general regulatory significance for the members in which it occurs.Similar to most tyrosine phosphorylation sites in protein tyrosine kinases, the phospho-Tyr-29 may also act as a docking site for specific cellular proteins containing SH2 and/or protein tyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. Comparison of the sequence around phospho-Tyr-29 with those of known SH2 domain and PTB domain binding motifs does not reveal any significant homology. Some degree of homology can be found between the GPVpY29 sequence and the consensus NPXpY motif recognized by the Shc PTB domain (28van der Geer P. Wiley S. Gish G.D. Lai V.K. Stephens R. White M.F. Kaplan D. Pawson T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 963-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Structural analysis of the Shc PTB domain bound to the ligand reveals that the conserved Pro residue is essential for the formation of the β-turn recognized by the Shc PTB domain. As the GPVpY29 motif of Hck is predicted to have a propensity to form a β-turn, it is possible that this motif is the docking site of an as yet to be identified PTB domain. Elucidation of the cellular functions of the phosphorylation of Tyr-29 in addition to modulation of activity awaits the isolation and identification of the putative cellular protein(s) which selectively bind to the sequence around Tyr-29.

https://openalex.org/W2095089675,"The 90-kDa ribosomal S6 kinases, the p90 Rsks, are a family of intracellular serine/threonine protein kinases distinguished by two distinct kinase domains. Rsks are activated downstream of the ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in diverse biological contexts, including progression through meiotic and mitotic M phases in Xenopus oocytes and cycling Xenopus egg extracts, and are critical for the M phase functions of Xenopus p42 MAPK. Here we report the cloning and biochemical characterization of Xenopus Rsk2.Xenopus Rsk1 and Rsk2 are specifically recognized by commercially available RSK1 and RSK2 antisera on immunoblots, but both Rsk1 and Rsk2 are immunoprecipitated by RSK1, RSK2, and RSK3 sera. Rsk2 is about 20-fold more abundant than the previously describedXenopus Rsk1 protein; their concentrations are approximately 120 and 5 nm, respectively. Rsk2, like Rsk1, forms a heteromeric complex with p42 MAP kinase. This interaction depends on sequences at the extreme C terminus of Rsk2 and can be disrupted by a synthetic peptide derived from the C-terminal 20 amino acids of Rsk2. Finally, we demonstrate that p42 MAP kinase can activate recombinant Rsk2 in vitro to a specific activity comparable to that found in Rsk2 that has been activated maximally in vivo. These findings underscore the importance of the Rsk2 isozyme in the M phase functions of p42 MAP kinase and provide tools for further examining Rsk2 function.

Dev. 1994; 4: 82-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (897) Google Scholar).One of the best-studied MAPK cascades consists of the p42 and p44 (or ERK2 and ERK1) MAPKs, the MEK1 and MEK2 MAPKKs, and the Raf and Mos MAPKKKs. Raf and Mos can phosphorylate MEK1 and MEK2 on two serine residues in MEK's T-loop, thereby activating the MEK. Active MEK in turn can phosphorylate p42 or p44 at threonine and tyrosine residues within the sequence Thr-Glu-Tyr in MAPK's T-loop, thereby activating the MAPK.p42 and p44 MAPK are probably best-known for their roles in mitogenesis and cell fate induction (4Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 1-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these proteins have also been implicated in the regulation of meiotic and mitotic M phase. Much of the work on the M phase roles of MAPKs has been carried out inXenopus laevis oocytes, eggs, and cycling egg extracts, where the relevant MAPK is p42 (ERK2) MAPK (5Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 6Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Sagata N.

Cell Cycle Res. 1995; 1: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).The first indication that p42 MAPK might play a role in M phase regulation came from studies of Xenopus oocyte maturation. Maturation is a key step in the production of a fertilizable egg, and its study has a long history of providing important insights into the biochemistry of M phase regulation. Fully grown Xenopusoocytes are arrested in a G2-like state with an intact germinal vesicle (nucleus) and inactive Cdc2/cyclin B and p42 MAPK. Progesterone releases oocytes from this arrest state and brings about a resumption of meiosis I. Progesterone-treated oocytes undergo germinal vesicle breakdown, complete the first meiotic division, progress through interkinesis, enter meiosis II, and then spontaneously arrest in metaphase of meiosis II. Germinal vesicle breakdown is immediately preceded by the activation of the Mos/MEK1/p42 MAPK cascade and Cdc2/cyclin B. Interfering with the activation of any member of the MAPK cascade can delay or inhibit Cdc2 activation and oocyte maturation (9Huang C.-Y.F. Ferrell Jr., J.E.

The main Cdc2-inhibitory kinase present in oocytes is Myt1 (43Murakami M.S. Vande Woude G.F. Development. 1998; 125: 237-248PubMed Google Scholar, 44Mueller P.R. Coleman T.R. Kumagai A. Dunphy W.G. Science. 1995; 270: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). Xenopus Rsk(s) have been found to associate with the C terminus of Myt1 and can phosphorylate and inactivate Myt1in vitro (23Palmer A. Gavin A.C. Nebreda A.R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 5037-5047Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Rsks in turn can be phosphorylated and activated by p42 MAPK (45Sturgill T.W. Ray L.B. Erikson E. Maller J.L. Nature. 1988; 334: 715-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (752) Google Scholar). Thus, p42 MAPK can release Cdc2 from the negative effects of Myt1, through the intermediacy of Rsk.The Mos/MEK/p42 MAPK cascade remains active throughout the remainder of maturation and in mature, unfertilized eggs. It plays a critical role in suppressing DNA replication and promoting Cdc2 activation between meiosis I and meiosis II (46Furuno N. Nishizawa M. Okazaki K. Tanaka H. Iwashita J. Nakajo N. Ogawa Y. Sagata N. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 2399-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 47Verlhac M.H. Kubiak J.Z. Weber M. Geraud G. Colledge W.H. Evans M.J. Maro B. Development. 1996; 122: 815-822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). p90 Rsk may mediate this effect of p42 MAPK; expression of a constitutively active form of p90 Rsk restores many aspects of a normal meiosis I/II transition to oocytes treated with a pharmacological inhibitor of the MAPK cascade (15Gross S.D.

Biol. 2000; 10: 430-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar).The MAPK cascade is also required for the establishment of the cytostatic factor arrest in unfertilized eggs. The cascade suppresses cyclin destruction and keeps unfertilized eggs arrested in metaphase of meiosis II until fertilization occurs (48Sagata N. Watanabe N. Vande Woude G.F. Ikawa Y.

Again, p90 Rsk appears to be a critical mediator of p42 MAPK. Depleting Rsk from a cyclingXenopus egg extract prevents the extract from undergoing mitotic arrest in response to p42 MAPK activation (51Bhatt R.R. Ferrell Jr., J.E. Science. 1999; 286: 1362-1365Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and expression of constitutively active p90 Rsk causes embryos to arrest in M phase (52Gross S.D. Schwab M.S. Lewellyn A.L. Maller J.L. Science. 1999; 286: 1365-1367Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar).Given the importance of Rsk in the function of the MAPK cascade inXenopus oocytes and eggs, we set out to determine what forms of Rsk were present in these systems. Four closely related Rsk cDNAs, RSK1, RSK2, RSK3, and RSK4, plus the more distantly related RSK-B and RLPK/MSK1 cDNAs, have been cloned from humans (53Moller D.E. Xia C.H. Tang W. Zhu A.X. M J. Am.

EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4426-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The only Xenopus Rsk cDNAs reported to date have been Rsk1 homologs (57Jones S.W. Erikson E. Blenis J. Maller J.L. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 3377-3381Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, there is clear biochemical evidence for at least one more Rsk-like kinase in Xenopus oocytes;Xenopus Rsk-like kinase activities fractionate into two chromatographically discrete peaks, designated S6 kinase I and S6 kinase II, which copurify with related but distinct 90- to 92-kDa proteins (24Erikson E. Maller J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 742-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 58Erikson E. Maller J.L. Erikson R.

Therefore, we have carried out a degenerate PCR screen for Xenopus Rsk-like cDNAs. Here we present the isolation and characterization of a new Xenopus Rsk cDNA, the Xenopus homolog of Rsk2, which represents the major Rsk isozyme in Xenopus oocytes and eggs.DISCUSSIONWe have cloned the Xenopus homolog of human RSK2.Xenopus Rsk2 appears to be the main Rsk isozyme inXenopus oocytes and eggs; its concentration is approximately 120 nm, compared with approximately 5 nm for Rsk1. The predicted sequence of Rsk2 indicates that this protein, rather than Rsk1, represents the principal component of S6 kinase II. Thus, in a happy coincidence of nomenclature, the numbers of the cDNA (Rsk2) and the biochemical activity (S6 kinase II) correspond. It will be of interest to determine whether Rsk1 represents S6 kinase I.The abundances of Rsk2 and Rsk1 are sufficient to account for the total Rsk-like activity in mature oocytes. We cannot rule out some contribution from a Rsk3 or Rsk4 isozyme, although we did not detect Rsk3- or Rsk4-like sequences by RT-PCR.Xenopus Rsk2 is very closely related to its human homolog RSK2. Much of the sequence difference between these two proteins lies near the N terminus, between amino acids 13 and 45. The Rsk1 cDNAs also differ from Rsk2 and from each other in this region, and the RSK3 cDNA has its distinctive nuclear localization sequence in this region. There is a stretch of sequence in the interkinase linker region (amino acids 387–405) that is well conserved between the two Rsk2 s but differs in sequence from Rsks 1, 3, and 4; if there are Rsk2-specific regulators or substrates, this region may be involved. Otherwise, Rsks 1–4 are very closely related to each other.Although both protein kinase domains are very well conserved amongXenopus Rsk2 and the other Rsk family members, there is somewhat better conservation of the N-terminal kinase domain than of the C-terminal kinase domain. This is particularly apparent from the phylograms shown in Fig. 2. Current evidence suggests that the N-terminal kinase domain of Rsk interacts with multiple downstream substrates, whereas the C-terminal kinase domain interacts only with the ERK MAPKs and with Rsk itself (70Bjørbaek C. Zhao Y. Moller D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18848-18852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 71Fisher T.L. Blenis J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1212-1219Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Thus the N-terminal kinase domain may be under more stringent pressure to remain unchanged than is the C-terminal kinase domain.Like Xenopus Rsk1 and mammalian Rsks, XenopusRsk2 can form a complex with phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated p42 MAPK. This finding suggests that Rsks play particularly important roles in MAPK signal transduction, and, indeed, Rsks have now been implicated in MAPK M phase functions (15Gross S.D. Schwab M.S.

These findings suggest a potential way of specifically interfering with Rsk activation in vivo.Purified recombinant Xenopus Rsk2 can be activated to high specific activity by incubation with purified recombinant MEK R4F and p42 MAPK. This activation process involves phosphorylation by p42 MAPK as well as MAPK-induced autophosphorylation of Ser-383 by the C-terminal Rsk kinase domain. In addition, the protein kinase PDK1 has been implicated in Rsk activation, and PDK1−/− embryonic stem cells are defective in activating p90 Rsks (32Williams M.R. Arthur J.S. Balendran A. van der Kaay J. Poli V. Cohen P. Alessi D.R. Curr. Biol. 2000; 10: 439-448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). There are two candidate PDK1 sites in Rsk2; Ser-383 and Ser-224. The latter site lies in the sequence Tyr-Ser-Phe in the T-loop of the N-terminal kinase domain. In view of our finding that Rsk2 can undergo Ser-383 phosphorylation in the absence of PDK1, PDK1 is most likely essential for the phosphorylation of Ser-224.Frödin and coworkers have recently proposed a sequential model for the activation of Rsks by MAPKs, based on their studies of various deletion mutants of rat Rsk2 expressed in COS7 cells (33Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) and other studies of Rsk activation in vitro and in transfected cells (31Dalby K.N.

Chem. 1996; 271: 29773-29779Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). The first step is the docking of MAPK at the C terminus of Rsk and the phosphorylation of Rsk in the C-terminal kinase domain activation loop and the interkinase linker region by MAPK. The second step is the autophosphorylation of Ser-383 (using theXenopus Rsk2 numbering; in rat Rsk2 the corresponding residue is Ser-386) by the C-terminal kinase domain. The third step is the docking of PDK1 at the phosphorylated Ser-383, which results in activation of PDK1. The final step is the phosphorylation of Ser-224 (Ser-227 in rat Rsk2) in the N-terminal kinase domain by PDK1. At first it might seem difficult to reconcile the final step of this model with our finding that purified Rsk2 can be fully activated by MEK R4F plus p42 MAPK (with no added PDK1). We suspect that Xenopus Rsk2 has a substantial level of Ser-224 phosphorylation when isolated from insect cells. Similarly, Dalby et al. (31Dalby K.N. Morrice N. Caudwell F.B. Avruch J. Cohen P. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1496-1505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) have reported that inactive rat Rsk1 is partially phosphorylated at Ser-222 (the corresponding residue) when isolated from unstimulated COS-1 cells, even though the MAPK phosphorylation sites and MAPK-dependent autophosphorylation sites are essentially non-phosphorylated. Frödin et al. (33Frodin M. Jensen C.J. Merienne K. Gammeltoft S. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2924-2934Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar) have hypothesized that the phosphorylation of Ser-224 persists longer than the phosphorylation of the MAPK sites and autophosphorylation sites. This hypothesis would account for our observation that purified recombinant Rsk2 can be fully activated by MEK R4F and p42 MAPK, and Dalby's observation that Ser-222 is partially phosphorylated when Rsk1 is inactive. The hypothesis remains to be tested directly. The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)1 cascade is a three-kinase module comprising a MAPK, a MAP kinase kinase (MAPKK), and a MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) (1Lewis T.S. Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. Adv. Cancer Res. 1998; 74: 49-139Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2English J. Pearson G. Wilsbacher J. Swantek J. Karandikar M. Xu S. Cobb M.H. Exp.

One of the best-studied MAPK cascades consists of the p42 and p44 (or ERK2 and ERK1) MAPKs, the MEK1 and MEK2 MAPKKs, and the Raf and Mos MAPKKKs. Raf and Mos can phosphorylate MEK1 and MEK2 on two serine residues in MEK's T-loop, thereby activating the MEK. Active MEK in turn can phosphorylate p42 or p44 at threonine and tyrosine residues within the sequence Thr-Glu-Tyr in MAPK's T-loop, thereby activating the MAPK. p42 and p44 MAPK are probably best-known for their roles in mitogenesis and cell fate induction (4Ferrell Jr., J.E. Curr. Top. Dev. Biol. 1996; 33: 1-60Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, these proteins have also been implicated in the regulation of meiotic and mitotic M phase. Much of the work on the M phase roles of MAPKs has been carried out inXenopus laevis oocytes, eggs, and cycling egg extracts, where the relevant MAPK is p42 (ERK2) MAPK (5Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 833-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar, 6Ferrell Jr., J.E. Bioessays. 1999; 21: 866-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 7Sagata N.

The first indication that p42 MAPK might play a role in M phase regulation came from studies of Xenopus oocyte maturation. Maturation is a key step in the production of a fertilizable egg, and its study has a long history of providing important insights into the biochemistry of M phase regulation. Fully grown Xenopusoocytes are arrested in a G2-like state with an intact germinal vesicle (nucleus) and inactive Cdc2/cyclin B and p42 MAPK. Progesterone releases oocytes from this arrest state and brings about a resumption of meiosis I. Progesterone-treated oocytes undergo germinal vesicle breakdown, complete the first meiotic division, progress through interkinesis, enter meiosis II, and then spontaneously arrest in metaphase of meiosis II. Germinal vesicle breakdown is immediately preceded by the activation of the Mos/MEK1/p42 MAPK cascade and Cdc2/cyclin B. Interfering with the activation of any member of the MAPK cascade can delay or inhibit Cdc2 activation and oocyte maturation (9Huang C.-Y.F. Ferrell Jr., J.E.

The MAPK requirement appears not to be absolute; many batches of oocytes ultimately do activate their Cdc2 and mature even when MAPK activation has been suppressed (14Fabian J.R. Morrison D.K.

Cak1p phosphorylates and activates Cdc28p, the major cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) in yeast, and is thereby required for passage through the yeast cell cycle. In this paper, we explore the kinetics of CDK phosphorylation by Cak1p, and we examine the role of the catalytic step in the reaction mechanism. Cak1p proceeds by a sequential reaction mechanism, binding to both ATP and CDK2 with reasonable affinities, exhibitingK d values of 7.2 and 0.6 μm, respectively. Interestingly, these values are approximately the same as the K M values, indicating that the binding of substrates is fast with respect to catalysis and that the most likely reaction mechanism is rapid equilibrium random. Cak1p is a slow enzyme, with a catalytic rate of only 4.3 min−1. The absence of a burst phase indicates that product release is not rate-limiting.

The major CDK in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is Cdc28p. Cdc28p binds to distinct cyclins to promote each of the transitions from G1through the entry into mitosis. The essential activating phosphorylation of Cdc28p occurs on Thr-169. This phosphorylation is carried out by Cak1p, the Cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase of budding yeast (1Espinoza F.H.

Cak1p is an unusual protein kinase whose sequence is significantly diverged from other members of the protein kinase superfamily, especially within highly conserved domains of the protein kinase catalytic core region.Cak1p appears to bind ATP differently than do other protein kinases.

Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). This residue interacts with both the α- and β-phosphates of ATP and is the site of covalent attack and inactivation by the ATP analog 5′-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (4Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Sowadski J.M. Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). Cak1p, however, is completely insensitive to 5′-fluorosulfonylbenzoyladenosine (6Kaldis P. Russo A.A. Chou H.S. Pavletich N.P. Solomon M.J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2545-2560Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar) and its binding of ATP is only modestly weakened by mutation of the corresponding lysine residue (Lys-31) (5Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Mutation of Lys-31 has only minor effects on the kinase activity of Cak1p (5Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol.

Remarkably, Cak1p can support growth of yeast even after removal of its first 31 amino acids, including the glycine loop region and Lys-31, although its kinase activity was below the limit of detection (5Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).Several other amino acids that are conserved in the protein kinase core sequence are not present in Cak1p (2Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 553-564Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), further suggesting that the structure and catalytic mechanism of Cak1p may be diverged from those of other protein kinases. An understanding of the mechanism by which Cak1p catalyzes the activating phosphorylation of CDKs is important not only for understanding cell cycle regulation but also for examining the ability of an unusual protein kinase to phosphorylate its substrates. Due to the important role of Cak1p as a cell cycle regulator, and because it possesses unusual nucleotide binding properties, Cak1p may be an effective target for an anti-fungal agent. An understanding of the rate-limiting step and kinetic mechanism of the Cak1p-mediated phosphorylation reaction will be useful for the design of effective drug screens.Mechanistic studies have been performed on other protein kinases to determine the order of binding for formation of the ternary complex. Both ordered and random mechanisms have been reported for PKA (9Cook P.F. Neville M.E.J. Vrana K.E. Hartl F.T. Roskoski R.J.

Stopped-flow kinetics and viscosity experiments showed that PKA exhibits a rapid “burst” phase, with a turnover rate of 250 s−1, followed by a slower, linear phase (21 s−1) that is limited by ADP release (12Adams J.A.

The mechanisms of some tyrosine kinases, including pp60c-Src, C-terminal Src kinase, insulin receptor kinase, and the epidermal growth factor receptor, are rapid equilibrium random (15Yuan C.-J.

Garbers D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 4137-4142Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This implies that the catalytic step for these enzymes is slow with respect to the binding of substrates. Among other serine/threonine kinases, calmodulin kinase II and p38 MAP kinase proceed with an ordered mechanism, with ATP binding first for calmodulin kinase II (20Kwiatkowski A.P. Huang C.Y. King M.M. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 153-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) and protein substrate binding first for p38 MAP kinase (21LoGrasso P.V. Frantz B. Rolando A.M. O'Keefe S.J. Hermes J.D. O'Neill E.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 10422-10427Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). Cyclin D1-CDK4 proceeds via an ordered Bi Bi reaction in which ATP binds first, and phosphorylated protein product is released last (22Konstantinidis A.K. Radhakrishnan R. Gu F. Rao R.N. Yeh W.-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26506-26515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of IκB by the IκB kinase proceeds by a random mechanism (23Burke J.R.

Chem. 1998; 273: 12041-12046Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar).In this paper we characterize the protein kinase activity of Cak1p and its interaction with its nucleotide and protein substrates. Specifically, we examine the binding of Cak1p to its substrates, ATP and human CDK2, and the role of the catalytic step in the Cak1p reaction mechanism. The results of these studies indicate that the rate-limiting step in the phosphorylation of CDK2 is most likely catalytic and that the reaction proceeds by a sequential mechanism with a random addition of substrates to form the ternary complex.DISCUSSIONWe have examined the parameters governing the ability of Cak1p to phosphorylate CDK2. Cak1p is not only an important cell cycle protein that is responsible for activation of the major cyclin-dependent kinase in yeast but is also an unusual protein kinase that lacks a number of conserved protein kinase core amino acids. Insight into the kinetic mechanism of Cak1p may provide us with information on how it is regulated in vivo and will also serve to illuminate the similarities and differences between an unusual protein kinase and other members of the protein kinase family. These studies may also be useful in the design of inhibitory compounds for Cak1p.Kinetics of the Phosphorylation ReactionThe rate constant (k cat) for the phosphorylation of CDK2 by Cak1p (4.3 min−1) is slow in comparison to a number of other protein kinases. For example, PKA phosphorylates a peptide substrate, Kemptide, with a k cat of 1260 min−1 (12Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Grant B.D. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2022-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Lew J. Taylor S.S. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6717-6724Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) or ∼300-fold higher than thek cat for Cak1p phosphorylation of CDK2. Likewise, pp60c-src has a k cat of 3100 min−1 or ∼700-fold higher than that of Cak1p (18Boerner R.J. Barker S.C. Knight W.B. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16419-16423Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of CDC2-cyclin B complexes by p40MO15 is at least 40 min−1 (30Solomon M.J. Harper J.W. Shuttleworth J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3133-3142Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). However, other protein kinases display catalytic rates similar to Cak1p. p38 MAP kinase, for example, phosphorylates a GST fusion protein of activating transcription factor 2 (GST-ATF2) with ak cat of only 4.8 min−1at saturation, whereas the reported k cat for the phosphorylation of histone H1 by CDK2-cyclin A complexes is 5.1 min−1 (32Jeffrey P.D. Russo A.A. Polyak K. Gibbs E. Hurwitz J. Massagué J. Pavletich N.P. Nature. 1995; 376: 313-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1208) Google Scholar). The slow rate of catalysis by Cak1p explains the observation that the K M values for both ATP and CDK2 are low in comparison to other kinases (5Enke D.A. Kaldis P. Holmes J.K. Solomon M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 1949-1956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). TheK M is dependent upon the catalytic rate as well as the dissociation constant. Other more catalytically efficient kinases typically have higher K M values, as high concentrations of substrate are necessary to keep the enzyme half-saturated in the face of rapid catalysis, whereas theK M of Cak1p is dominated by equilibrium binding (i.e. the K d), and substrates are only slowly siphoned off into products.We investigated the possible causes for the slow turnover rate exhibited by Cak1p. The kinetic analysis indicated that there is no “burst phase” and that the off-rate of product from Cak1p is not rate-limiting. In contrast, kinetic studies of PKA have shown that the production of phosphorylated Kemptide is characterized by a burst phase, with a rate constant of 250 s−1, followed by a linear phase of 21 s−1. This indicates that the k cat of PKA is limited by release of product from the ternary complex, specifically ADP (12Adams J.A. Taylor S.S. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 8516-8522Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 13Grant B.D. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 2022-2029Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 14Lew J. Taylor S.S. Adams J.A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 6717-6724Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar).The observation that the K M ∼K d for both ATP and CDK2 suggested that the catalytic step was slow with respect to the on/off rates of the substrates. This conclusion was supported by experiments examining the effect of deuterated solvent on V max. If the rate-limiting step in the chemical reaction is due to the slow removal of the proton from the incoming substrate hydroxyl, the presence of deuterated solvent should decrease the overall rate of the reaction (17Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30880-30887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Yoon M.-Y. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4118-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). We observed a 60–80% decrease inV max in the presence of deuterated solvent, supporting the conclusion that catalysis is rate-limiting. In contrast, PKA displays only a small isotope effect (1.6-fold), which is indicative of its rapid catalytic step (33Yoon M.-Y. Cook P.F. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4118-4125Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Human c-SRC kinase (CSK), also a reportedly slow catalytic protein kinase, displays only a small solvent isotope effect (0.74-fold) (17Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30880-30887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), indicative of an asymmetric transition state, which has been reported for other protein tyrosine kinases (15Yuan C.-J. Jakes S. Elliot S. Graves D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 16205-16209Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).The Kinetic Mechanism for Cak1pCak1p appears to bind ATP and CDK2 independently of each other. The initial velocity experiments indicated that the K d was close to theK M for both ATP and CDK2. This result indicated that there was no binding synergy between the two substrates (34Viola R.E. Raushel F.M. Rendina A.R. Cleland W.W. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 1295-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), as binding of ATP to Cak1p did not influence the binding affinity for CDK2 and vice versa. If, for example, binding of ATP had a large positive effect on CDK2 binding, then we would expectK d(CDK2) to be significantly larger thanK M(CDK2). This conclusion was supported by the observations that Cak1p had ATPase activity in the absence of protein substrate and that the K M(ATP)as measured by the ATPase assay was similar to theK M(ATP) measured in the presence of CDK2. Furthermore, ATP significantly stabilized the enzyme in response to increasing temperature in the absence of CDK2 (Fig. 5), again indicating that Cak1p can bind ATP in the absence of a protein substrate. The kinetic mechanism of the phosphorylation reaction between Cak1p and CDK2 is therefore most likely rapid equilibrium random with respect to the addition of substrates (17Cole P.A. Burn P. Takacs B. Walsh C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30880-30887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Rudolph F.B. Fromm H.J. Methods Enzymol. 1979; 63: 138-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), although we cannot definitively exclude the possibility of an ordered reaction with ATP binding first. We were unable to perform assays with dead-end inhibitors due to the absence of any peptide substrates for Cak1p; therefore, we could not confirm the reaction mechanism by this traditional method.In conclusion, we have shown that the catalytic step of the Cak1p-mediated phosphorylation of CDK2 was rate-limiting in vitro. The determination of the kinetic parameters for both ATP and CDK2 indicated that the reaction most likely proceeds by a rapid equilibrium random pathway. Due to the unusual nature of the Cak1p ATP binding pocket, and the important role played by this enzyme in the yeast cell cycle, Cak1p is an intriguing target for potential anti-fungal agents. Elucidation of the crystal structure of Cak1p could provide additional insights into the catalytic mechanism of this protein kinase. Cell cycle progression is driven by the sequential activities of cyclin-dependent protein kinases (CDKs).1 Full activation of CDKs requires binding to regulatory proteins termed cyclins as well as phosphorylation on a key residue (Thr-160 for human CDK2) within the so-called T-loop (activation segment). The major CDK in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is Cdc28p. Cdc28p binds to distinct cyclins to promote each of the transitions from G1through the entry into mitosis. The essential activating phosphorylation of Cdc28p occurs on Thr-169. This phosphorylation is carried out by Cak1p, the Cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase of budding yeast (1Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Morgan D.O. Science. 1996; 273: 1714-1717Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 2Kaldis P. Sutton A. Solomon M.J.

Cak1p is an unusual protein kinase whose sequence is significantly diverged from other members of the protein kinase superfamily, especially within highly conserved domains of the protein kinase catalytic core region. Cak1p appears to bind ATP differently than do other protein kinases. A “glycine loop” found near the N terminus of the catalytic domain of virtually all protein kinases contains a GXGXXG motif, which stabilizes the β-phosphate of ATP (4Taylor S.S. Knighton D.R. Zheng J. Sowadski J.M. Gibbs C.S. Zoller M.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 84-89Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). In contrast, Cak1p lacks a recognizable glycine loop (1Espinoza F.H. Farrell A. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P. Morgan D.O.

The transcriptional activation of a 152-base pair lacUV5promoter (synlac promoter) with a CRP consensus binding site sequence (syncon promoter) was enhanced by an average factor of 12.3 ± 0.5 with the cAMP-ligated complexes of CRP/mutants and cGMP-ligated T127L, although their promoter binding site affinities varied by a factor of 5. However, in the presence of bound RNA polymerase, the binding affinities only ranged from 0.8 ± 0.2 × 107 m − 1for cAMP-ligated CRP* to 1.8 ± 0.3 × 107 m − 1 for cAMP-ligated CRP, indicating that the CRP/mutant interacts with the bound RNA polymerase, which would account for the near constancy of the enhancement factors. The corresponding enhancement factors for the synlacpromoter and a promoter with a different CRP binding site sequence (syngal promoter) were also nearly the same, 7.2 ± 0.7 and 6 ± 1, respectively. The binding reaction of thesyncon promoter to the RNA polymerase is exothermic, with a binding constant (K b) = 2.1 ± 0.2 × 107 m −1."
