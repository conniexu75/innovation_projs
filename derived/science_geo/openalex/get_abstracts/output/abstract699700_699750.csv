We show that intestinal microbiota protects against development of obesity, metabolic syndrome, and pre-diabetic phenotypes by inducing commensal-specific Th17 cells. High-fat, high-sugar diet promoted metabolic disease by depleting Th17-inducing microbes, and recovery of commensal Th17 cells restored protection. Microbiota-induced Th17 cells afforded protection by regulating lipid absorption across intestinal epithelium in an IL-17-dependent manner. Diet-induced loss of protective Th17 cells was mediated by the presence of sugar. Eliminating sugar from high-fat diets protected mice from obesity and metabolic syndrome in a manner dependent on commensal-specific Th17 cells. Sugar and ILC3 promoted outgrowth of Faecalibaculum rodentium that displaced Th17-inducing microbiota. These results define dietary and microbiota factors posing risk for metabolic syndrome. They also define a microbiota-dependent mechanism for immuno-pathogenicity of dietary sugar and highlight an elaborate interaction between diet, microbiota, and intestinal immunity in regulation of metabolic disorders.

https://openalex.org/W4293461777,"We use computational design coupled with experimental characterization to systematically investigate the design principles for macrocycle membrane permeability and oral bioavailability. We designed 184 6-12 residue macrocycles with a wide range of predicted structures containing noncanonical backbone modifications and experimentally determined structures of 35; 29 are very close to the computational models. With such control, we show that membrane permeability can be systematically achieved by ensuring all amide (NH) groups are engaged in internal hydrogen bonding interactions. 84 designs over the 6-12 residue size range cross membranes with an apparent permeability greater than 1 × 10-6 cm/s. Designs with exposed NH groups can be made membrane permeable through the design of an alternative isoenergetic fully hydrogen-bonded state favored in the lipid membrane. The ability to robustly design membrane-permeable and orally bioavailable peptides with high structural accuracy should contribute to the next generation of designed macrocycle therapeutics."
https://openalex.org/W4293462133,"Individual memories are often linked so that the recall of one triggers the recall of another. For example, contextual memories acquired close in time can be linked, and this is known to depend on a temporary increase in excitability that drives the overlap between dorsal CA1 (dCA1) hippocampal ensembles that encode the linked memories. Here, we show that locus coeruleus (LC) cells projecting to dCA1 have a key permissive role in contextual memory linking, without affecting contextual memory formation, and that this effect is mediated by dopamine. Additionally, we found that LC-to-dCA1-projecting neurons modulate the excitability of dCA1 neurons and the extent of overlap between dCA1 memory ensembles as well as the stability of coactivity patterns within these ensembles. This discovery of a neuromodulatory system that specifically affects memory linking without affecting memory formation reveals a fundamental separation between the brain mechanisms modulating these two distinct processes."

https://openalex.org/W4293585786,"Patients with COVID-19 usually recover and return to normal health, however some patients may have symptoms that last for weeks or even months after recovery. This persistent state of ill health is known as Long COVID if it continues for more than three months and are not explained by an alternative diagnosis. Long Covid has been overlooked, especially in the low- and middle-income countries. Therefore, we conducted an online survey among the COVID-19 survivors in the community to explore their Long COVID symptoms, factors associated with Long COVID and how Long COVID affected their work. A total of 732 COVID-19 survivors responded, with 56% were without or with mild symptoms during their acute COVID-19 conditions. One in five COVID-19 survivors reported of experiencing Long COVID. The most commonly reported symptoms were fatigue, brain fog, depression, anxiety and insomnia. Females had 58% higher odds (95% CI: 1.02, 2.45) of experiencing Long COVID. Patients with moderate and severe levels of acute COVID-19 symptoms had OR of 3.01 (95% CI: 1.21, 7.47) and 3.62 (95% CI: 1.31, 10.03) respectively for Long COVID. Recognition of Long COVID and its associated factors is important in planning prevention, rehabilitation, clinical management to improve recovery from COVID-19."
https://openalex.org/W4293585919,"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infects the liver and causes chronic infection. Several mutations in the viral genome have been associated with drug resistance development. Currently, there is no approved vaccine against the HCV. The employment of computational biology is the primary and crucial step for vaccine design or antiviral therapy which can substantially reduce the duration and cost of studies. Therefore, in this study, we designed a multi-epitope vaccine using various immunoinformatics tools to elicit the efficient human immune responses against the HCV. Initially, various potential (antigenic, immunogenic, non-toxic and non-allergenic) epitope segments were extracted from viral structural and non-structural protein sequences using multiple screening methods. The selected epitopes were linked to each other properly. Then, toll-like receptors (TLRs) 3 and 4 agonists (50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 and human β-defensin 2, respectively) were added to the N-terminus of the final vaccine sequence to increase its immunogenicity. The 3D structure of the vaccine was modeled. Molecular dynamics simulations studies verified the high stability of final free vaccines and in complex with TLR3 and TLR4. These constructs were also antigenic, non-allergenic, nontoxic and immunogenic. Although the designed vaccine traits were promising as a potential candidate against the HCV infection, experimental studies and clinical trials are required to verify the protective traits and safety of the designed vaccine."

Limited research works were conducted on customers' adoption intentions to obtain a real image of the evolution of WPD in China. This study aims to investigate the effects of Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Conditions (FC), Hedonic Motivation (HM), Perceived Trust (PT), and Lifestyle Compatibility (LC) on the intention to adopt WPD among Chinese consumers by expanding unified theory of acceptance and use of technology with two impelling determinants (i.e. PT and LC). Using an online survey, empirical data were collected from 298 respondents in China. In a two-stage data analysis, partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) were employed to analyse the causal effects and associations between independent and dependent variables, whereas artificial neural networks (ANN) were used to evaluate the research model prediction capability. The (PLS-SEM) findings indicated that PE, SI, FC, HM, LC, and PT had substantial positive impacts on adoption intention, whilst EE had no impact on adoption intention among Chinese consumers. The ANN analysis proved the high prediction accuracy of data fitness, with ANN findings highlighting the importance of PT, FC, and PE on the intention to adopt WPD. It was suggested that the study findings assist WPD service providers and the smart wearable device industry practitioners in developing innovative products and implementing efficient marketing strategies to attract the existing and potential WPD users in China."
https://openalex.org/W4293585865,"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a primary causative agent of chronic periodontitis. Moreover, it leads to several systemic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and Alzheimer’s diseases. It seems that the development of a vaccine against this bacterium is necessary. Thus, this study decided to identify novel immunogenic targets and developed multiple epitope-based vaccines against P . gingivalis . For this purpose, the pan/core-proteome of this bacterium was studied, and the suitable vaccine targets were selected based on different properties, including exposed localization of proteins, antigenicity, non-allergenicity, non-similarity to host proteome, stability, B-cell epitopes and MHC II binding sites, sequence conservation, molecular docking, and immune simulation. Through the quartile scoring method, 12 proteins with ≥ 20 scores were considered as suitable immunogenic targets. The results of the protein domain and functional class search showed that most of the immunogenic proteins were involved in the transport and metabolism of inorganic ions and lipids. In addition, two unknown function proteins, including WP_004584259.1 and WP_099780539.1 were detected as immunogenic targets. Three constructions carrying multi-epitopes were generated including Naked, LCL, and as chimeric structures. Among them, FliC chimeric protein had the strongest affinity to the human TLR2, 4, and 6, while the LCL platform represented the highest level of immune stimulation response. The obtained results from this study revealed new insights into prophylactic routes against P . gingivalis by introducing novel immunogenic targets. However, further investigations, including site-directed mutation and immunoassay are needed to confirm the pathogenic role and protectivity of these novel proteins."
https://openalex.org/W4293353629,"Transcription dysregulation is common in sarcomas driven by oncogenic transcription factors. Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue (CCSST) is a rare sarcoma with poor prognosis presently with no therapy. It is characterized by a balanced t(12;22) (q13;q12) chromosomal translocation, resulting in a fusion of the Ewing’s sarcoma gene EWSR1 with activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) to give an oncogene EWSR1-ATF1. Unlike normal ATF1, whose transcription activity is dependent on phosphorylation, EWSR1-ATF1 is constitutively active to drive ATF1-dependent gene transcription to cause tumorigenesis. No EWSR1-ATF1-targeted therapies have been identified due to the challenges in targeting intracellular transcription factors. Through proteomics screening to identify potential druggable targets for CCSST, we discovered protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as a novel protein to interact with EWSR1-ATF1. PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase to symmetrically dimethylate arginine residues in substrate proteins to regulate a diverse range of activities including gene transcription, RNA splicing, and DNA repair. We found that PRMT5 enhances EWSR1-ATF1-mediated gene transcription to sustain CCSST cell proliferation. Genetic silencing of PRMT5 in CCSST cells resulted in severely impaired cell proliferation and EWSR1-ATF1-driven transcription. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the clinical-stage PRMT5 inhibitor JNJ-64619178 potently and efficaciously inhibited CCSST cell growth in vitro and in vivo. These results provide new insights into PRMT5 as a transcription regulator and warrant JNJ-64619178 for further clinical development to treat CCSST patients.

The standard treatment for localized disease is to perform wide surgical resection or whole limb amputation. However, up to 85% of the patients develop the recurrence and eventual metastasis (2Enzinger F.M. Clear-cell Sarcoma of tendons and aponeuroses.

Since most of the patients are adolescents and young adults, the overall life years lost due to CCSST are more substantial. CCSST is notorious for its insensitivity to existing chemotherapies or radiation therapy. No therapies exist for CCSST. The hallmark of CCSST is characterized by a balanced t(12;22) (q13;q12) chromosomal translocation, which results in a gene fusion between the Ewing’s sarcoma gene EWSR1 and activating transcription factor 1 (ATF1) to give an oncogene EWSR1-ATF1 (10Zucman J.

Cancer. 2002; 99: 560-567Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). EWSR1 is known as an RNA-binding protein (13Ohno T. Ouchida M. Lee L. Gatalica Z. Rao V.N. Reddy E.S. The EWS gene, involved in Ewing family of tumors, malignant melanoma of soft parts and desmoplastic small round cell tumors, codes for an RNA binding protein with novel regulatory domains.Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3087-3097PubMed Google Scholar). ATF1 is a member of the cAMP-responsive element (CRE)–binding protein (CREB) family transcription factors (14Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. CREB: A stimulus-induced transcription factor activated by a diverse array of extracellular signals.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1807) Google Scholar, 15Xiao X.

The gene fusion retains the C-terminal basic leucine-zipper (bZIP) DNA-binding domain of ATF1. The CREB family of transcription factors requires phosphorylation at Ser133 of CREB1 or Ser63 of ATF1 by protein Ser/Thr kinases including cAMP-regulated protein kinase A (PKA) in order to be transcriptionally active (16Gonzalez G.A. Montminy M.R. Cyclic AMP stimulates somatostatin gene transcription by phosphorylation of CREB at serine 133.Cell. 1989; 59: 675-680Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). However, in the case of EWSR1-ATF1 fusion, the serine-tyrosine-glycine-glutamine (SYGQ)–rich domain present in the N-terminal portion of EWSR1 is a strong transcription activation domain (17Lee J. Nguyen P.T. Shim H.S. Hyeon S.J. Im H. Choi M.H. et al.A multifunctional protein, regulates cellular function and aging via genetic and epigenetic pathways.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol. Basis Dis. 2019; 1865: 1938-1945Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Therefore, EWSR1-ATF1 is constitutively active in driving CREB1/ATF1-depenent gene transcription through its bZIP domain independent of phosphorylation (18Feng L. Lee K.A. A repetitive element containing a critical tyrosine residue is required for transcriptional activation by the EWS/ATF1 oncogene.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4161-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Genetic mouse modeling studies have established that expression of EWSR1-ATF1 is sufficient to drive the development of CCSST in mice, resembling human pathologies (19Yamada K. Ohno T. Aoki H.

Besides the initial discovery of type 1 EWSR1-ATF1 fusion in CCSST patients, 6 other types of EWSR1-ATF1 fusion and EWSR1-CREB1 have also been reported in CCSST patients (22Wang W.L. Mayordomo E. Zhang W. Hernandez V.S. Tuvin D. Garcia L. et al.Detection and characterization of EWSR1/ATF1 and EWSR1/CREB1 chimeric transcripts in clear cell sarcoma (melanoma of soft parts).Mod. Pathol. 2009; 22: 1201-1209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, these gene fusions have been observed in other CCS-like disease pathologies in other parts of the body including the gastrointestinal tract and other abdominal surfaces (5Hocar O. Le Cesne A. Berissi S. Terrier P. Bonvalot S. Vanel D. et al.Clear cell sarcoma (malignant melanoma) of soft parts: A clinicopathologic study of 52 cases.Dermatol. Res. Pract. 2012; 2012984096Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Together, the identification of EWSR1-ATF1 and EWSR1-CREB1 fusion underscores the critical role of constitutive CREB1/ATF1-mediated gene transcription in the development of CCSST and other CCS-like cancers that lack effective therapies. However, it is unclear how EWSR1-ATF1 can activate CREB1/ATF1-dependent gene transcription without phosphorylation. Lack of this mechanistic understanding inhibits our capability to identify novel therapeutics for these sarcomas. In this paper, we describe the identification of protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as a new EWSR1-ATF1 binding co-activator to stimulate its transcription activity. We further employed genetic and chemical means to inhibit PRMT5 to demonstrate that PRMT5 is a novel druggable vulnerability in EWSR1-ATF1-driven CCSST. The most common fusion between EWSR1 and ATF1 generates EWSR1(2–325)-ATF1(66–271) fusion containing N-terminal portion of EWSR1 and C-terminal portion of ATF1 with its intact bZIP DNA-binding domain (23Hisaoka M. Ishida T. Kuo T.T. Matsuyama A. Imamura T. Nishida K. et al.Clear cell sarcoma of soft tissue: A clinicopathologic, immunohistochemical, and molecular analysis of 33 cases.Am. J. Surg. Pathol. 2008; 32: 452-460Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Genetic studies have provided compelling evidence that the growth and survival of CCSST cells are critically dependent on the continuous expression of EWSR1-ATF1 and its transcription activity (19Yamada K. Ohno T. Aoki H. Semi K. Watanabe A. Moritake H. et al.EWS/ATF1 expression induces sarcomas from neural crest-derived cells in mice.J. Clin. Invest. 2013; 123: 600-610PubMed Google Scholar, 24Davis I.J. Kim J.J. Ozsolak F. Widlund H.R. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Granter S.R. et al.Oncogenic MITF dysregulation in clear cell sarcoma: Defining the MiT family of human cancers.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). As a fusion protein between an RNA-binding protein EWSR1 and a transcription factor ATF1, the major portion of EWSR1-ATF1 fusion protein is predicted to be unstructured. Indeed, when the fusion protein sequence was analyzed by PONDR (Predictor of Natural Disordered Regions) algorithm (25Romero P. Obradovic Z. Li X. Garner E.C. Brown C.J. Dunker A.K. Sequence complexity of disordered protein.Proteins. 2001; 42: 38-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (1411) Google Scholar), the majority of the EWSR1 region is found to be unstructured (Fig. 1A). As expected, the bZIP domain in the C-terminal portion of ATF1 is ordered. Consistent with this prediction, the artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm AlphaFold (26Jumper J. Evans R. Pritzel A. Green T. Figurnov M. Ronneberger O. et al.Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold.Nature. 2021; 596: 583-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (9093) Google Scholar) also predicts that EWSR1 portion is unstructured, while a good fraction of ATF1 including the bZIP domain is structured (Fig. 1B). Even within the structured region of ATF1, no obvious small-molecule-binding sites can be readily identified (Fig. S1A). As a consequence, direct targeting of EWSR1-ATF1 by small molecules is challenging and no direct small-molecule inhibitors of EWSR1-ATF1 have been developed. Despite EWSR1-ATF1 being largely unstructured, it has been reported that it functions as a constitutively active transcription factor (18Feng L. Lee K.A. A repetitive element containing a critical tyrosine residue is required for transcriptional activation by the EWS/ATF1 oncogene.Oncogene. 2001; 20: 4161-4168Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To confirm this, we created the in-frame Flag-tagged fusion between EWSR1(2–325) and ATF1(66–271) (Fig. S1B). When EWSR1-ATF1 was expressed along with our previously described CREB1/ATF1 transcription reporter plasmid (CRE-RLuc) in HEK 293T cells (27Li B.X. Xiao X. Discovery of a small-molecule inhibitor of the KIX-KID interaction.Chembiochem. 2009; 10: 2721-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), we found that the exogenously expressed EWSR1-ATF1 is transcriptionally active in driving CREB1/ATF1-depedent gene transcription (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, this transcription activity is independent of phosphorylation as adding PKA activator forskolin (Fsk) did not further enhance its transcription activity (Fig. 1D). These results support that EWSR1-ATF1 is constitutively active in driving CREB1/ATF1-dependent gene transcription. Since EWSR1-ATF1 has been established as the genetic driver for CCSST development and maintenance, targeting this driver represents a potentially promising approach to develop effective therapeutics. However, the lack of a well-folded structural pocket for small-molecule binding in EWSR1-ATF1 creates challenges in developing direct small-molecule inhibitors to inhibit its transcription activity as potential therapeutics. To circumvent this intrinsic challenge, we sought to identify critical proteins that would interact with EWSR1-ATF1 to support its constitutive transcription activity and hypothesized that these proteins might serve as potential drug targets for CCSST. Therefore, we expressed Flag-tagged EWSR1-ATF1 in HEK 293T cells. To identify the proteins that would interact with EWSR1-ATF1, the expressed EWSR1-ATF1 was subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-Flag (M2) followed by mass spectrometry (IP-MS) analysis (Fig. 2A). An IgG control pulldown was also included. This analysis identified 157 proteins that presented higher abundance in the anti-Flag sample (Table S1). Gene ontology (GO) analysis of these 157 proteins in the biological processes using g:Profiler (28Raudvere U. Kolberg L. Kuzmin I. Arak T. Adler P. Peterson H. et al.Profiler: A web server for functional enrichment analysis and conversions of gene lists (2019 update).Nucleic Acids Res. 2019; 47: W191-W198Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar) revealed that many processes involving RNA molecules are enriched (Table S2). The top 15 biological processes enriched are shown in Fig. 2B, which include both RNA catabolic and metabolic processes. Among these processes, the mRNA metabolic process contains protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) that has recently become a druggable target (29Wang Y. Hu W. Yuan Y. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as an anticancer target and its inhibitor discovery.J. Med. Chem. 2018; 61: 9429-9441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Various PRMT5 inhibitors have been developed, and at least 5 of them are in phase 1/2 clinical trials for different malignancies (30Chen Y. Shao X. Zhao X. Ji Y. Liu X. Li P. et al.Targeting protein arginine methyltransferase 5 in cancers: roles, inhibitors and mechanisms.Biomed. Pharmacother. 2021; 144112252Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Additionally, PRMT5 is one of only 6 proteins (PPM1B, KIF11, PRMT5, ACTR3, HBB, and PTGES3) that interact with EWSR1-ATF1 specifically and have 3 or more unique peptide identifications (Fig. 2C, S2 and Table S1). Furthermore, while PRMT5 has not previously been shown to interact with EWSR1-ATF1, it was reported that PRMT5 could function as a transcription co-activator for CREB1 in hepatocytes to enhance CREB1-mediated gene transcription (31Tsai W.W. Niessen S. Goebel N. Yates 3rd, J.R. Guccione E. Montminy M. PRMT5 modulates the metabolic response to fasting signals.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2013; 110: 8870-8875Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). For these reasons, we focused our investigation on PRMT5 as a putative critical target for EWSR1-ATF1-driven CCSST. PRMT5 is a type II protein arginine methyltransferase leading to symmetric arginine dimethylation of both histone and non-histone proteins to regulate a diverse range of activities including gene transcription, RNA splicing, and DNA repair (32Hwang J.W.

To confirm the proteomics findings, we expressed Flag-tagged EWSR1-ATF1 in HEK 293T cells and immunoprecipitated the cell lysates using anti-Flag antibody (M2). Then, the bound proteins were analyzed by Western blot. Indeed, strong PRMT5 signal was detected in the M2 immunoprecipitate, but not in the control IgG immunoprecipitate (Fig. 2D). CREB1 can form a heterodimer with the C-terminal domain of ATF1 through its bZIP domain that is retained in EWSR1-ATF1. Indeed, CREB1 was detected in the M2 immune complex (Fig. 2D). Conflicting reports exist to show that EWSR1-ATF1 constitutively interacts with CREB-binding protein (CBP) to support its constitutive transcription activity (33Araya N. Hirota K. Shimamoto Y. Miyagishi M. Yoshida E. Ishida J. et al.Cooperative interaction of EWS with CREB-binding protein selectively activates hepatocyte nuclear factor 4-mediated transcription.J. Biol.

The Ewing's sarcoma gene product functions as a transcriptional activator.Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 2690-2695PubMed Google Scholar). In our co-IP analysis, the constitutive interaction between EWSR1-ATF1 and CBP was not detected. As a control, GAPDH was not detected in either of the immune complexes (Fig. 2B). Together, these results demonstrate that EWSR1-ATF1 interacts with PRMT5 in the cells to possibly function as a transcription co-activator to support EWSR1-ATF1-mediated gene transcription. The results presented above suggest that PRMT5 might be a potential transcription co-activator for EWSR1-ATF1. To test if PRMT5 is bound to the gene promoter region of EWSR1-ATF1 target gene c-Fos (24Davis I.J. Kim J.J. Ozsolak F. Widlund H.R. Rozenblatt-Rosen O. Granter S.R. et al.Oncogenic MITF dysregulation in clear cell sarcoma: Defining the MiT family of human cancers.Cancer Cell. 2006; 9: 473-484Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) in CCSST cells, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed in CCSST cell line DTC-1. After the cells were cross-linked with formaldehyde, they were subjected to ChIP analysis using IgG, anti-CREB1, or anti-PRMT5. CREB1 forms a heterodimer with EWSR1-ATF1 (Fig. 2D) and served as a positive control for the ChIP assay. Indeed, the CRE site in the c-Fos promoter region is occupied by CREB1 (Fig. 3A). Importantly, this site is also occupied by PRMT5 (Fig. 3A), suggesting that PRMT5 may enhance EWSR1-ATF1’s transcription activity by binding to the promoter region of its target genes. To investigate if PRMT5 is required for sustained transcription of c-Fos in CCSST cells, its expression was silenced in SU-CCS-1 cells using two different shRNA constructs. Both of these constructs efficiently knocked down the expression of PRMT5 (Fig. 3B). When the expression of PRMT5 was reduced, the expression of EWSR1-ATF1’s target gene c-Fos was also significantly reduced, as assessed by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis (Fig. 3C), suggesting that PRMT5 is critical for enhancing EWSR1-ATF1’s transcription activity. Similar knocking down results were also obtained in another CCSST cell line DTC-1 (Fig. 3, D and E). We further evaluated PRMT5’s role in supporting EWSR1-ATF1-mediated gene transcription using a CREB1/ATF1 transcription reporter assay in DTC-1 cells. The cells were transduced with a lentivirus containing renilla luciferase reporter gene under the control of three tandem copies of CRE that could bind EWSR1-ATF1 (27Li B.X. Xiao X. Discovery of a small-molecule inhibitor of the KIX-KID interaction.Chembiochem. 2009; 10: 2721-2724Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Upon PRMT5 knockdown by two different shRNAs, the CREB1/ATF1 transcription reporter activity was significantly reduced (Fig. 3F). These evaluations of the transcription reporter and endogenous gene expression in CCSST cells showed that PRMT5 is critical for the constitutive EWSR1-ATF1-driven transcription. Because EWSR1-ATF1-driven transcription is critical for sustained CCSST cell proliferation, we investigated if silencing the expression of PRMT5 would impact CCSST cellular proliferation. To this end, the expression of PRMT5 was silenced in both SU-CCS-1 and DTC-1 cells using two independent shRNA constructs. Upon PRMT5 knockdown (Fig. 3, B and D), the proliferation of both SU-CCS-1 and DTC-1 cells was significantly impaired (Fig. 4A), suggesting that PRMT5 is critical for the proliferation of CCSST cells. Given the potentially important role of PRMT5 in CCSST cells and druggability of PRMT5 (29Wang Y. Hu W. Yuan Y. Protein arginine methyltransferase 5 (PRMT5) as an anticancer target and its inhibitor discovery.J. Med. Chem. 2018; 61: 9429-9441Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), we investigated the potential efficacy of PRMT5 inhibitors in inhibiting CCSST cell growth. We selected 3 highly potent and selective PRMT5 inhibitors representing two different modes of inhibition of PRMT5 to assess their efficacy in CCSST models. GSK591 and GSK3326595 bind at the protein substrate-binding pocket (35Chan-Penebre E. Kuplast K.G. Majer C.R. Boriack-Sjodin P.A. Wigle T.J.

Cancer Ther. 2021; 20: 2317-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The inhibitors were tested in 3 different CCSST cell lines: SU-CCS-1, DTC-1, and CCS292. The cells were incubated with different PRMT5 inhibitors for either 3 days or 6 days. Then, viable cells were quantified using the MTT reagent and the GI50 values were calculated, which are the concentrations needed to inhibit the cell growth by 50% (38Xie F. Li B.X. Kassenbrock A.

Chem. 2015; 58: 5075-5087Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 4C and Fig. S4, A–C, different PRMT5 inhibitors showed differential sensitivity profiles in the panel of CCSST cell lines. GSK591 and GSK3326595 were only weakly active in DTC-1 and SU-CCS-1 cells with GI50s in the high μM concentration range although its activity in CCS292 cells was much more potent. On the other hand, JNJ-64619178 displayed more potent activities in both DTC-1 and SU-CCS-1 cells with GI50 = 377 and 347 nM, respectively, during a 3-day incubation period. Thus, JNJ-64619178 was further evaluated in a 6-day treatment protocol. Upon this extended exposure, JNJ-64619178 showed dramatically improved activity with GI50 = 29.3, 445.8, and 3.8 nM in DTC-1, SU-CCS-1, and CCS292 cells, respectively (Fig. 4C and S4D).

During the preparation of this manuscript, additional PRMT5 inhibitors became available. Therefore, we evaluated another clinical-stage SAM-competitive PRMT5 inhibitor PF-0693999 (39Jensen-Pergakes K. Tatlock J. Maegley K.A. McAlpine I.J.

As shown in Fig. S5, these additional inhibitors presented varied potencies in the CCSST cells. But they are all less potent than JNJ-64619178, further supporting that differential binding modes can contribute to the differential sensitivity irrespective of their potencies in biochemical PRMT5 inhibition.

https://openalex.org/W4293569839,"In Bacillus subtilis, sporulation is a sequential and highly regulated process. Phosphorylation events by histidine kinases are key points in the phosphorelay that initiates sporulation, but serine/threonine protein kinases also play important auxiliary roles in this regulation. PrkA has been proposed to be a serine protein kinase expressed during the initiation of sporulation and involved in this differentiation process. Additionally, the role of PrkA in sporulation has been previously proposed to be mediated via the transition phase regulator ScoC, which in turn regulates the transcriptional factor σK and its regulon. However, the kinase activity of PrkA has not been clearly demonstrated, and neither its autophosphorylation nor phosphorylated substrates have been unambiguously established in B. subtilis. We demonstrated here that PrkA regulation of ScoC is likely indirect. Following bioinformatic homology searches, we revealed sequence similarities of PrkA with the ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities ATP-dependent Lon protease family. Here, we showed that PrkA is indeed able to hydrolyze α-casein, an exogenous substrate of Lon proteases, in an ATP-dependent manner. We also showed that this ATP-dependent protease activity is essential for PrkA function in sporulation since mutation in the Walker A motif leads to a sporulation defect. Furthermore, we found that PrkA protease activity is tightly regulated by phosphorylation events involving one of the Ser/Thr protein kinases of B. subtilis, PrkC. Taken together, our results clarify the key role of PrkA in the complex process of B. subtilis sporulation."

This study aims to evaluate the effects of combined therapies, commonly used in subjects with acute myocardial infarction, in the quality of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. Methods Prospective, open-label trial, included patients with acute myocardial infarction. Patients were randomized to antiplatelet treatment (ticagrelor or clopidogrel) and subsequently to lipid-lowering therapy (rosuvastatin or simvastatin/ezetimibe) and were followed up for six months. Nonlinear optical properties of LDL samples were examined by Gaussian laser beam (Z-scan) to verify the oxidative state of these lipoproteins, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to analyze structural changes on these particles, dynamic light scattering (DLS) to estimate the particle size distribution, ultra violet (UV)-visible spectroscopy to evaluate the absorbance at wavelength 484 nm (typical from carotenoids), and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Lipoprint) to analyze the LDL subfractions. Results Simvastatin/ezetimibe with either clopidogrel or ticagrelor was associated with less oxidized LDL, and simvastatin/ezetimibe with ticagrelor to lower cholesterol content in the atherogenic subfractions of LDL, while rosuvastatin with ticagrelor was the only combination associated with increase in LDL size. Conclusions The quality of LDL particles was influenced by the antiplatelet/lipid-lowering strategy, with ticagrelor being associated with the best performance with both lipid-lowering therapies.

However, the big data for AI in smart farm is not studied well; the effect of differences among varieties within a crop remains unclear. Therefore, the response of two varieties of blueberry, 'Suziblue' and 'Star', to light was tested using SAPD meter in order to demonstrate the environmental responses could be different among varieties within the same species. The results showed that those two varieties had significant differences in SPAD values based on the leaf's position and time, whereas 'Star' did not. This indicates that the effect of light depends on the variety, which implies that other traits and other crops may show similar differences. These results are based on a simple experiment. However, it is enough to elucidate that it is extremely important to characterize responses to the environment not only for each crop but also for each variety to collect data for smart farming to increase accuracy for modeling; consequently, to maximize the efficiency of these facilities."

However, there is persistent controversy regarding their outcomes. We aimed to analyze accumulated clinical and laboratory data from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who underwent GT at our institution in the last 10 years to determine optimal parameters to estimate the GT effect. We hypothesized that patients grouped according to prognostic factors would have inconsistent clinical outcomes.In this single-center retrospective study, we collected medical records of 219 GT-treated patients diagnosed with AML from 2009 to 2019. Prognostic factors, including clinical and laboratory parameters, were assessed. Serial measurements of laboratory parameters before and after GT were collected, and the area under the curve of the white blood cells (AUC-WBC) was calculated using the trapezoidal method. A prognostic scoring system using 8 factors from multivariate analysis was analyzed. The primary outcome was survival at 30 days (D30) after GT initiation.The 8 factors for the prognosis scoring system included secondary AML, mean AUC-WBC, prothrombin time, and levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN), bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), phosphorus, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Patients were grouped into 4 risk groups (low, medium, high, and very high), and the D30 survival rates for each group were as follows: 87.6% (99/113), 55.9% (33/59), 21.1% (4/19), and 0% (0/19), respectively. Hematopoiesis, liver, and renal function affected the outcome. FLT3 mutation acted as a favorable factor for D30 survival.GT response in patients with AML seemed to be reflected by 8 score markers, and GT was significantly effective in the low-risk group. We suggest that it is important to evaluate the risk assessment of patients before GT to achieve better outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4293679851,"Candidalysin, a peptide toxin produced specifically from hyphae of Candida albicans, plays a crucial role in C. albicans pathogenesis in the oral cavity and vagina. Synthetic peptides have been widely used in previous studies to investigate the bioactivity of candidalysin. Although the solubility of the peptide, which is expected to have a hydrophobic property, has not been well characterized, candidalysin solutions are usually prepared in water. In this study, we prepared the synthetic peptide candidalysin in water (CLw) or in dimethyl sulfoxide (CLd) and compared their cytotoxicity and interleukin (IL)-1β-producing activity to determine whether the activity of the peptide would be affected. In addition, we evaluated whether the NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome pathway or other pathways were involved in their activities. Unexpectedly, we found that CLw was not completely solubilized and contained abundant insoluble microparticles. CLw was active at comparably high concentrations (≥ 10 μM). In contrast, CLd is completely solubilized and sufficiently active at low concentrations, that is, 1 μM or less. CLw showed weak cytotoxicity and NLRP3-dependent and cathepsin B-dependent IL-1β-producing activity, whereas CLd showed strong cytotoxicity and cathepsin B-dependent IL-1β-producing activity. Fractionation of CLw revealed that NLRP3-dependent activity was caused by insoluble microparticles. Furthermore, nanoparticle tracking of CLd revealed that the peptide was present as nanoparticles with a size of 96 nm. CLw contained a small amount of such nanoparticles. Thus, the bioactivities of the synthetic peptide candidalysin, especially the IL-1β-producing activity, are affected by the solubility of the peptide depending on the solvent employed. The NLRP3-dependent activity of the synthetic peptide is caused by insoluble microparticles and may not be the intrinsic activity of candidalysin."

Here we show that the mean-field approximation of the quantum adiabatic annealing leads to equations similar to those of thermal mean-field annealing. However, a new type of sigmoid function replaces the thermal one.

https://openalex.org/W3211925124,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has changed our lives and still poses a challenge to science. Numerous studies have contributed to a better understanding of the pandemic. In particular, inhalation of aerosolised pathogens has been identified as essential for transmission. This information is crucial to slow the spread, but the individual likelihood of becoming infected in everyday situations remains uncertain. Mathematical models help estimate such risks. In this study, we propose how to model airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 at a local scale. In this regard, we combine microscopic crowd simulation with a new model for disease transmission. Inspired by compartmental models, we describe virtual persons as infectious or susceptible. Infectious persons exhale pathogens bound to persistent aerosols, whereas susceptible ones absorb pathogens when moving through an aerosol cloud left by the infectious person. The transmission depends on the pathogen load of the aerosol cloud, which changes over time. We propose a 'high risk' benchmark scenario to distinguish critical from non-critical situations. A parameter study of a queue shows that the new model is suitable to evaluate the risk of exposure qualitatively and, thus, enables scientists or decision-makers to better assess the spread of COVID-19 and similar diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3214322774,"In this study, we merged methods from engineering control theory, machine learning, and human neuroimaging to critically test the putative role of the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) in goal-directed performance monitoring during an emotion regulation task. Healthy adult participants (n = 94) underwent cued-recall and re-experiencing of their responses to affective image stimuli with concurrent functional magnetic resonance imaging and psychophysiological response recording. During cued-recall/re-experiencing trials, participants engaged in explicit self-regulation of their momentary affective state to match a pre-defined affective goal state. Within these trials, neural decoding methods measured affect processing from fMRI BOLD signals across the orthogonal affective dimensions of valence and arousal. Participants' affective brain states were independently validated via facial electromyography (valence) and electrodermal activity (arousal) responses. The decoded affective states were then used to contrast four computational models of performance monitoring (i.e., error, predicted response outcome, action-value, and conflict) by their relative abilities to explain emotion regulation task-related dACC activation. We found that the dACC most plausibly encodes action-value for both valence and arousal processing. We also confirmed that dACC activation directly encodes affective arousal and also likely encodes recruitment of attention and regulation resources. Beyond its contribution to improving our understanding of the roles that the dACC plays in emotion regulation, this study introduced a novel analytical framework through which affect processing and regulation may be functionally dissociated, thereby permitting mechanistic analysis of real-world emotion regulation strategies, e.g., distraction and reappraisal, which are widely employed in cognitive behavioral therapy to address clinical deficits in emotion regulation."
https://openalex.org/W4226034509,"Human perception and behavior are affected by the situational context, in particular during social interactions. A recent study demonstrated that humans perceive visual stimuli differently depending on whether they do the task by themselves or together with a robot. Specifically, it was found that the central tendency effect is stronger in social than in non-social task settings. The particular nature of such behavioral changes induced by social interaction, and their underlying cognitive processes in the human brain are, however, still not well understood. In this paper, we address this question by training an artificial neural network inspired by the predictive coding theory on the above behavioral data set. Using this computational model, we investigate whether the change in behavior that was caused by the situational context in the human experiment could be explained by continuous modifications of a parameter expressing how strongly sensory and prior information affect perception. We demonstrate that it is possible to replicate human behavioral data in both individual and social task settings by modifying the precision of prior and sensory signals, indicating that social and non-social task settings might in fact exist on a continuum. At the same time, an analysis of the neural activation traces of the trained networks provides evidence that information is coded in fundamentally different ways in the network in the individual and in the social conditions. Our results emphasize the importance of computational replications of behavioral data for generating hypotheses on the underlying cognitive mechanisms of shared perception and may provide inspiration for follow-up studies in the field of neuroscience."
https://openalex.org/W4293353613,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), which is part of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTORC2, controls cellular metabolism in response to levels of nutrients and other growth signals. A hallmark of mTORC2 activation is the phosphorylation of Akt, which becomes upregulated in cancer. How mTORC2 modulates Akt phosphorylation remains poorly understood. Here, we found that the RNA-binding protein, AUF1 (ARE/poly(U)-binding/degradation factor 1), modulates mTORC2/Akt signaling. We determined that AUF1 is required for phosphorylation of Akt at Thr308, Thr450, and Ser473 and that AUF1 also mediates phosphorylation of the mTORC2-modulated metabolic enzyme glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 1 at Ser243. In addition, AUF1 immunoprecipitation followed by quantitative RT-PCR revealed that the mRNAs of Akt, glutamine fructose-6-phosphate amidotransferase 1, and the mTORC2 component SIN1 associate with AUF1. Furthermore, expression of the p40 and p45, but not the p37 or p42, isoforms of AUF1 specifically mediate Akt phosphorylation. In the absence of AUF1, subcellular fractionation indicated that Akt fails to localize to the membrane. However, ectopic expression of a membrane-targeted allele of Akt is sufficient to allow Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation despite AUF1 depletion. Finally, conditions that enhance mTORC2 signaling, such as acute glutamine withdrawal, augment AUF1 phosphorylation, whereas mTOR inhibition abolishes AUF1 phosphorylation. Our findings unravel a role for AUF1 in promoting membrane localization of Akt to facilitate its phosphorylation on this cellular compartment. Targeting AUF1 could have therapeutic benefit for cancers with upregulated mTORC2/Akt signaling."

This report describes the protocol of the HOLISTIC Cohort Study, including survey development, recruitment strategy, and data management and analysis.An interprofessional student research team has been organized with the goal of providing continuous assessment of study design and implementation across the seven health science colleges (applied health sciences, dentistry, medicine, nursing, pharmacy, public health, and social work) at the University of Illinois Chicago in Chicago, IL. To be eligible to participate in the HOLISTIC Cohort Study, students are required to be 1) age 18 years or older; 2) enrolled full- or part-time in one or more of UIC's seven health science colleges; and 3) enrolled in a program that prepares its graduates to enter a healthcare profession. The study protocol includes a series of three recruitment waves (Spring 2021 [April 14, 2021, to May 5, 2021; completed], Spring 2022, Spring 2023). In the first recruitment wave, eligible students were sent an invitation via electronic mail (e-mail) to complete an online survey. The online survey was based on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2019 survey and the 2014 World Health Organization Report of the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts Working Group Vaccine Hesitancy Scale. Electronic informed consent and study data are collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools. This study utilizes convenience sampling from all seven health science colleges at UIC with a target recruitment total of 2,000 participants.A total of 555 students across all seven health science colleges (10.8% of 5,118 students who were invited; 27.6% of target sample size) enrolled in the cohort during the first recruitment wave. The pilot data establishes the feasibility of the study during the COVID-19 pandemic. Adaptations to overcome barriers to study implementation, including the use of remote, rather than in-person, study meetings, staff training, and participant recruitment are discussed. For the second and third waves of recruitment, the student research team will seek institutional review board (IRB) approval to implement additional enrollment strategies that are tailored to each health science college, such as online newsletters, virtual townhalls, flyers on bulletin boards near classrooms tailored to each health science college."

Jacaranda mimosifolia being the most frequently observed species was used in this study to test expert opinion and the adequacy of citizen science records in detecting the influence of climatic conditions on this species' flowering phenology. Generalised Additive Models for Location Scale and Shape were used to explore the occurrence and intensity of flowering of Jacaranda in relation to rainfall, temperature, and sun exposure. Jacaranda flowering onset was influenced by winter cold exposure, while flowering intensity was related to increasing sun exposure as spring progresses, and both were influenced by the conditions for flowering in the former flowering seasons (i.e., sun exposure and highest temperatures reached, respectively). Our models provide the first attempt to describe the climate drivers for Jacaranda mimosifolia flowering in the southern hemisphere and identify where climatic changes will most likely alter this tree's phenology in Australia and benefit or challenge its reproductive ability. They also support the choice of species for citizen science programs based on expert opinion."
https://openalex.org/W4293579629,"Laboratory animals are used for scientific research in various fields. In recent years, there has been a concern that the gut microbiota may differ among laboratory animals, which may yield different results in different laboratories where in-vivo experiments are performed. Our knowledge of the gut microbiota of laboratory-reared common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) is limited; thus, in this study, we analyzed the daily changes in fecal microbiome composition, individual variations, and effects of the birth facility in healthy female laboratory-reared marmosets, supplied by three vendors. We showed that the marmoset fecal microbiome varied among animals from the same vendor and among animals from different vendors (birth facility), with daily changes of approximately 37%. The fecal microbiome per vendor is characterized by alpha diversity and specific bacteria, with Bifidobacterium for vendor A, Phascolarctobacterium for vendor B, and Megamonas for vendor C. Furthermore, we found that plasma progesterone concentrations and estrous cycles were not correlated with daily fecal microbiome changes. In contrast, animals with an anovulatory cycle lacked Megamonas and Desulfovibrio bacteria compared to normal estrous females. This study suggests that the source of the animal, such as breeding and housing facilities, is important for in-vivo experiments on the marmoset gut microbiota."

Herein, we exposed the 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -treated epithelium-like Caco-2 monolayer to FeCl 3 to demonstrate the inhibitory effect of ferric ion on 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -induced transepithelial calcium transport. We found that a 24-h exposure to FeCl 3 on the apical side significantly decreased calcium transport, while increasing the transepithelial resistance (TER) in 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -treated monolayer. The inhibitory action of FeCl 3 was considered rapid since 60-min exposure was sufficient to block the 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -induced decrease in TER and increase in calcium flux. Interestingly, FeCl 3 did not affect the baseline calcium transport in the absence of 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 treatment. Furthermore, although ascorbic acid is often administered to maximize calcium solubility and to enhance intestinal calcium absorption, it apparently had no effect on calcium transport across the FeCl 3 - and 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -treated Caco-2 monolayer. In conclusion, apical exposure to ferric ion appeared to negate the 1,25(OH) 2 D 3 -stimulated calcium transport across the intestinal epithelium. The present finding has, therefore, provided important information for development of calcium and iron supplement products and treatment protocol for specific groups of individuals, such as thalassemia patients and pregnant women."
https://openalex.org/W4293579702,"Stature is one of the significant parameters to confirm a biological profile besides sex, age, and ancestry. Sabah is in the Eastern part of Malaysia and is populated by multi-ethnic groups. To date, limited studies on stature estimation have been conducted in Sabah. Hence, this study aims to construct population-specific stature estimation equations for the large ethnic groups in Sabah, Malaysia.The aim is to propose linear models using different hand dimensions (hand span, handbreadth, hand length, middle finger length, and the second inter-crease in the middle finger) for the young adult male and females of the major ethnic groups in Sabah.This cross-sectional study framework used stratified random sampling on 184 male and 184 female young adults. An unpaired t-test and a one-way ANOVA were used to assess the differences in the mean between sex and ethnicities, respectively. The link between the response variable and explanatory variables was initially investigated using simple linear regression, followed by multiple linear regression.The present study demonstrated the highest association for the quantitative explanatory variables among hand length and stature (right side: r = 0.833; left side: r = 0.842). Simple equations were specifically developed without sex indicators, and ethnic and multiple linear regression was developed with sex and ethnic indicators. Multiple linear regression provided good estimation r2 = 0.7886 and adjusted r2 = 0.7853. The stature of 18 to 25 year old large ethnic groups in Sabah can be estimated using the developed models 90.218 + 3.845 LHL -5.950 Sex-2.308 Bajau -1.673 KadazanDusun + 2.676 L2ICL.

Sestrin 2 (Sesn2) deficiency has been shown to partially suppress pulmonary emphysema. The aim of this study was to evaluate Sesn2 levels in COPD patients and its possible associations with the presence of emphysema and blood eosinophils. All patients underwent lung function testing and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) of the chest. The presence of emphysematous lesions in >15% of the pulmonary parenchyma was considered as significant emphysema. Sixty-seven patients were included in the study. 40/67 patients were characterized as having significant emphysema. Patients with significant emphysema had higher levels of Sesn2 (ng/ml) [median (IQR) 6.7 (2.7,10.3 vs 1.09 (0.9,1.9), p<0.001)] and significantly lower % and absolute blood eosinophil counts (cells/μL) compared to patients without emphysema [1 (0, 2) vs 4 (2, 4) p<0.001 and 62 (0, 110) vs 248 (180, 300), p<0.001 respectively]. Sesn2 presented a significant positive correlation to the score of emphysema in HRCT (rs = 0.87, p<0.001) and similar positive but weaker correlation to FRC (rs = 0.27, p = 0.024). Negative correlations were observed between Sesn2 and either the % of blood eosinophils and/or the absolute blood eosinophil count (rs = -0.79, p<0.001, and rs = -0.78, p<0.001 respectively). Sesn2 levels above 1.87 ng/ml showed a high diagnostic performance for the presence of significant emphysema in HRCT with an AUC 0.93, 95% CI (0.85,0.98), p<0.001. Sesn2 could serve as a potential biomarker of emphysema."

B. cereus NC7401 strain successfully expressing and secreting lipase with maximal lipolytic activity was subjected to a submerged fermentation process with five different carbon (starch, glucose, maltose, fructose, and lactose) and five different nitrogen (tryptone, ammonium nitrate, peptone, urea, yeast extract) sources to produce lipase enzyme. Maximum enzyme activity was found with starch (30.6 UmL-1), maltose (40 UmL-1), and tryptone (38.6 UmL-1), and the lipases produced using these sources were named lipase A, B, and C respectively. The total protein content of 8.56, 8.86, and 2.75 μg mL-1 were obtained from B. cereus NC7401 cultured using starch, maltose, and tryptone respectively. Lipase was stable between temperature range 30-80°C and pH 5-10 whereas optimally active at 55°C and pH 8.0. The enzyme was relatively stable for 10 days at 4°C and its optimum reaction time with the substrate was 30 minutes. It was tolerant to 1.5% (v/v) methanol as an organic solvent, 1.5% (v/v) Triton X-100 as a media additive and 1.5% (w/v) Ni2+ as a metal ion. SDS, n-hexane, and Ag+ inhibited lipolytic activity. Oil stains were removed from cotton fabric which showed oil removal efficiency enhancement in the presence of a lipase. Fat hydrolysis of 20, 24, and 30% was achieved following 6 hours of incubation of the fat particles with lipase A, B, and C respectively at a concentration of 20 mg mL-1. To as best of our knowledge, this study on lipases extracted from bacteria of Azad Kashmir, Pakistan origin has never been reported before."

However, there is limited understanding of the HIV testing-to-care continuum among newly diagnosed in this setting.We conducted an exploratory study that analyzed de-identified data, including demographic characteristics and biomedical outcomes, from the electronic medical records of individuals newly diagnosed with HIV from 2016-2020 at the only public safety-net, county-run health department HIV clinic in SPA 6. We used Pearson Chi-square and Fisher's Exact test to explore associations with HIV outcomes and a Kaplan-Meier survival curve to assess the time to linkage to care.A total of 281 patients were identified. The majority (74.1%) presented with a baseline CD4 <500, many of which presented with a CD4<200 (39.2%). We found twice as many newly diagnosed Black individuals in our study population (48.2%) when compared to LAC (23%), despite only accounting for 27.4% of residents in SPA 6. The majority were linked to care within 30 days of positive test and prescribed anti-retroviral therapy. Viral suppression (59.8%) and undetectable VL (52.6%) were achieved within the year following diagnosis, with 9.3% lost to follow-up. Of those who became virally suppressed, 20.7% experienced viral rebound within the year following diagnosis.The large proportion of patients with a baseline CD4 <500 raises concerns about late diagnoses. Despite high rates of linkage to care and ART prescription, achievement of sustained viral suppression remains low with high rates of viral rebound. Longitudinal studies are needed to understand the barriers to early testing, retention in care, and treatment adherence to develop strategies and interventions with community organizations that respond to the unique needs of people living with HIV in South Los Angeles."
https://openalex.org/W4293681079,"Introduction In central nervous system neurodegenerative disorders, stem cell-based therapies should be considered as a promising therapeutic approach. The safe use of human Neural Stem Cells (hNSCs) for the treatment of several neurological diseases is currently under evaluation of phase I/II clinical trials. Clinical application of hNSCs require the development of GMP standardized protocols capable of generating high quantities of reproducible and well characterized stem cells bearing stable functional and genetic properties. Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate possible instabilities or modifications of the microsatellite loci in different culture passages because high culture passages represent an in vitro replicative stress leading to senescence. Experimental method: The hNSCs were characterized at different culture time points, from passage 2 to passage 25, by genetic typing at ten microsatellite loci. Conclusion We showed that genetic stability at microsatellite loci is maintained by the cells even at high passages adding a further demonstration of the safety of our hNSCs GMP culture method."
https://openalex.org/W4293701520,"Continuous and rapid renewal of the colonic epithelium is crucial to resist the plethora of luminal deleterious agents. Subepithelial fibroblasts contribute to this turnover by regulating epithelial proliferation and differentiation. However, when intestinal homeostasis is disturbed, fibroblasts can acquire an activated phenotype and play a major role in the progression of intestinal pathologies. To evaluate the involvement of fibroblasts in the regulation of colonocytes under homeostatic or pathological conditions, we established resting and activated conditionally immortalized fibroblast cell lines (nF and mF) from mouse colonic mucosa. We then studied the epithelial-mesenchymal interactions between activated or resting fibroblasts and the normal mouse colonocytes (Co) using a co-culture model. Both fibroblastic cell lines were characterized by RT-qPCR, western blot and immunofluorescence assay. Our results showed that nF and mF cells were positive for fibroblastic markers such as vimentin and collagen 1, and negative for cytokeratin 18 and E-cadherin, attesting to their fibroblastic type. They also expressed proteins characteristic of the epithelial stem cell niche such as Grem1, CD90 or Wnt5a. Only rare nF fibroblasts were positive for α-SMA, whereas all mF fibroblasts strongly expressed this marker, supporting that mF cells were activated fibroblasts/myofibroblasts. In coculture, nF fibroblasts and Co cells strongly interacted via paracrine exchanges resulting in BMP4 production in nF fibroblasts, activation of BMP signaling in Co colonocytes, and decreased growth of colonocytes. Activated-type mF fibroblasts did not exert the same effects on Co cells, allowing colonocytes free to proliferate. In conclusion, these two colonic fibroblast lines, associated with Co cells in coculture, should allow to better understand the role of mesenchymal cells in the preservation of homeostasis and the development of intestinal pathologies."
https://openalex.org/W4293701859,"The gaur (Bos gaurus) is found throughout mainland South and Southeast Asia but is listed as an endangered species in Thailand with a decreasing population size and a reduction in suitable habitat. While gaur have shown a population recovery from 35 to 300 individuals within 30 years in the Khao Phaeng Ma (KPM) Non-Hunting Area, this has caused conflict with villagers along the border of the protected area. At the same time, the ecotourism potential of watching gaurs has boosted the local economy. In this study, 13 mitochondrial displacement-loop sequence samples taken from gaur with GPS collars were analyzed. Three haplotypes identified in the population were defined by only two parsimony informative sites (from 9 mutational steps of nucleotide difference). One haplotype was shared among eleven individuals located in different subpopulations/herds, suggesting very low genetic diversity with few maternal lineages in the founder population. Based on the current small number of sequences, neutrality and demographic expansion test results also showed that the population was likely to contract in the near future. These findings provide insight into the genetic diversity and demography of the wild gaur population in the KPM protected area that can inform long-term sustainable management action plans."
https://openalex.org/W4293701947,"Objectives This study examines the contents of official communication from United States governors’ offices related to the COVID-19 pandemic to assess patterns in communication and to determine if they correlate with trends for COVID cases and deaths. Methods We collected text data for all COVID-19 related press releases between March 1 and December 31, 2020 from the US governors’ office websites in all 50 states. An automated parsing and sentiment analyzer assessed descriptive statistics and trends in tone, including positivity and negativity. Results We included a total of 7,720 press releases in this study. We found that both positive and negative sentiments were homogenous across states at the beginning of the pandemic but became heterogeneous as the pandemic evolved. The same trend applied to the frequency and tone of press releases. Sentiments across states were overall positive with a small level of negativity. We observed a reactive official communication to the evolution of the number of COVID-19 cases rather than responsive or preventive. Conclusions The findings of both positivity and negativity in press communications suggest that the effect of discounted importance was present in official communications. Our findings support a state-dependent optimal communication frequency and tone, agreeing with the curvilinear communication model of organizational theory and implying that feedback cycles between government officials and public response should be shortened to rapidly maximize communication efficacy during the pandemic. Future research should identify and evaluate the drivers of the large differences in communication tone across states and validate the reactive characteristics of COVID-19 official communications."
https://openalex.org/W4293378104,"TFIIH is an evolutionarily conserved complex that plays central roles in both RNA polymerase II (pol II) transcription and DNA repair. As an integral component of the pol II preinitiation complex, TFIIH regulates pol II enzyme activity in numerous ways. The TFIIH subunit XPB/Ssl2 is an ATP-dependent DNA translocase that stimulates promoter opening prior to transcription initiation. Crosslinking-mass spectrometry and cryo-EM results have shown a conserved interaction network involving XPB/Ssl2 and the C-terminal Hub region of the TFIIH p52/Tfb2 subunit, but the functional significance of specific residues is unclear. Here, we systematically mutagenized the HubA region of Tfb2 and screened for growth phenotypes in a TFB6 deletion background in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We identified six lethal and 12 conditional mutants. Slow growth phenotypes of all but three conditional mutants were relieved in the presence of TFB6, thus identifying a functional interaction between Tfb2 HubA mutants and Tfb6, a protein that dissociates Ssl2 from TFIIH. Our biochemical analysis of Tfb2 mutants with severe growth phenotypes revealed defects in Ssl2 association, with similar results in human cells. Further characterization of these tfb2 mutant cells revealed defects in GAL gene induction, and reduced occupancy of TFIIH and pol II at GAL gene promoters, suggesting that functionally competent TFIIH is required for proper pol II recruitment to preinitiation complexes in vivo. Consistent with recent structural models of TFIIH, our results identify key residues in the p52/Tfb2 HubA domain that are required for stable incorporation of XPB/Ssl2 into TFIIH and for pol II transcription."
https://openalex.org/W4293579610,"In the Adirondack Park region of northern New York, USA, white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and moose (Alces alces) co-occur along a temperate-boreal forest ecotone. In this region, moose exist as a small and vulnerable low-density population and over-browsing by white-tailed deer is known to reduce regeneration, sustainability, and health of forests. Here, we assess the distribution and abundance of white-tailed deer at a broad spatial scale relevant for deer and moose management in northern New York. We used density surface modeling (DSM) under a conventional distance sampling framework, tied to a winter aerial survey, to create a spatially explicit estimate of white-tailed deer abundance and density across a vast, northern forest region. We estimated 16,352 white-tailed deer (95% CI 11,762-22,734) throughout the Adirondack Park with local density ranging between 0.00-5.73 deer/km2. Most of the Adirondack Park (91.2%) supported white-tailed deer densities of ≤2 individuals/km2. White-tailed deer density increased with increasing proximity to anthropogenic land cover such as timber cuts, roads, and agriculture and decreased in areas with increasing elevation and days with snow cover. We conclude that climate change will be more favorable for white-tailed deer than for moose because milder winters and increased growing seasons will likely have a pronounced influence on deer abundance and distribution across the Adirondack Park. Therefore, identifying specific environmental conditions facilitating the expansion of white-tailed deer into areas with low-density moose populations can assist managers in anticipating potential changes in ungulate distribution and abundance and to develop appropriate management actions to mitigate negative consequences such as disease spread and increased competition for limiting resources."
https://openalex.org/W4293579617,"Background Prenatal phthalates exposures have been related to adiposity in peripuberty in a sex-specific fashion. Untargeted metabolomics analysis to assess circulating metabolites offers the potential to characterize biochemical pathways by which early life exposures influence the development of cardiometabolic risk during childhood and adolescence, prior to becoming evident in clinical markers. Methods Among mother-child dyads from the Early Life Exposure in Mexico to ENvironmental Toxicants (ELEMENT) birth cohort, we measured 9 phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A in maternal spot urine samples obtained during each trimester of pregnancy, corrected for urinary specific gravity and natural log-transformed. In 110 boys and 124 girls aged 8–14 years, we used a mass-spectrometry based untargeted metabolomics platform to measure fasting serum metabolites, yielding 572 annotated metabolites. We estimated the associations between trimester-specific urinary toxicants and each serum metabolite, among all children or stratified by sex and adjusting for child age, BMI z-score, and pubertal onset. We accounted for multiple comparisons using a 10% false discovery rate (q&lt;0.1). Results Associations between exposures and metabolites were observed among all children and in sex-stratified analyses (q&lt;0.1). First trimester MEP, MiBP, and MCPP were associated with decreased 2-deoxy-D-glucose among all children. Among girls, third trimester concentrations of MECPP, MEHHP, MEHP, and MCPP were associated with 15, 13, 1, and 10 metabolites, respectively, including decreased choline and increased acylcarnitines and saturated FAs (FA). Among boys, third trimester MIBP was positively associated with 9 features including long chain saturated FAs, and second trimester MBzP was inversely associated with thyroxine. Conclusions Metabolomics biomarkers may reflect sex- and exposure timing-specific responses to prenatal phthalate exposures manifesting in childhood that may not be detected using standard clinical markers of cardiometabolic risk."
https://openalex.org/W4293579626,"We propose an evolutionary model for the emergence of shared linguistic convention in a population of agents whose social structure is modelled by complex networks. Through agent-based simulations, we show a process of convergence towards a common language, and explore how the topology of the underlying networks affects its dynamics. We find that small-world effects act to speed up convergence, but observe no effect of topology on the communicative efficiency of common languages. We further explore differences in agent learning, discriminating between scenarios in which new agents learn from their parents (vertical transmission) versus scenarios in which they learn from their neighbors (oblique transmission), finding that vertical transmission results in faster convergence and generally higher communicability. Optimal languages can be formed when parental learning is dominant, but a small amount of neighbor learning is included. As a last point, we illustrate an exclusion effect leading to core-periphery networks in an adaptive networks setting when agents attempt to reconnect towards better communicators in the population."
https://openalex.org/W4293579628,"In the engineering and economic management fields, optimisation models frequently involve different decision-making levels. These are known as multi-level optimisation problems. Because the decision-making process of such problems are hierarchical, they are also called a hierarchical optimisation problems. When the problem involves only two-level decision-making, the corresponding optimisation model is referred to as a bilevel programming problem(BLPP). To address the complex nonlinear bilevel programming problem, in this study, we design an evolutionary algorithm embedded with a surrogate model-that it is a approximation method and correlation coefficients. First, the isodata method is used to group the initial population, and the correlation coefficients of the individuals in each group are determined based on the rank of the leader and follower objective functions. Second, for the offspring individuals produced by the evolutionary operator, the surrogate model is used to approximate the solution of the follower's programming problem, during which the points in the population are screened by combining the correlation coefficients. Finally, a new crossover operator is designed by the spherical search method, which diversifies the generated offspring. The simulation experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can effectively obtain an optimal solution."

https://openalex.org/W4293579663,"B cells represent a critical component of the adaptive immune response whose development and differentiation are determined by antigen-dependent and antigen-independent interactions. In this study, we explored the effects of IL-4 and pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) ligands on B cell development and differentiation by investigating their capacity to drive the in vitro maturation of human transitional B cells. In the presence of IL-4, ligands for TLR7/8, TLR9, and NOD1 were effective in driving the in vitro maturation of cord blood transitional B cells into mature, naïve B cells as measured by CD23 expression, ABCB1 transporter activation and upregulation of sIgM and sIgD. In addition, several stimulation conditions, including TLR9 ligand alone, favored an expansion of CD27 + IgM memory B cells. Transitional B cells stimulated with TLR7/8 ligand + IL-4 or TLR9 ligand, with or without IL-4, induced a significant subpopulation of CD23 + CD27 + B cells expressing high levels of sIgM and sIgD, a minor B cell subpopulation found in human peripheral blood. These studies illustrate the heterogeneity of the B cell populations induced by cytokine and PRR ligand stimulation. A comparison of transitional and mature, naïve B cells transcriptomes to identify novel genes involved in B cell maturation revealed that mature, naïve B cells were less transcriptionally active than transitional B cells. Nevertheless, a subset of differentially expressed genes in mature, naïve B cells was identified including genes associated with the IL-4 signaling pathway, PI3K signaling in B lymphocytes, the NF-κB signaling pathway, and the TNFR superfamily. When transitional B cells were stimulated in vitro with IL-4 and PRR ligands, gene expression was found to be dependent on the nature of the stimulants, suggesting that exposure to these stimulants may alter the developmental fate of transitional B cells. The influence of IL-4 and PRR signaling on transitional B cell maturation illustrates the potential synergy that may be achieved when certain PRR ligands are incorporated as adjuvants in vaccine formulations and presented to developing B cells in the context of an inflammatory cytokine environment. These studies demonstrate the potential of the PRR ligands to drive transitional B cell differentiation in the periphery during infection or vaccination independently of antigen mediated BCR signaling."

Specifically, this study examined the effects of PM2.5 index changes on residents’ decision to participate in outdoor exercise and the duration of outdoor exercise participation. The empirical results show that the increase of PM2.5 index has a significant inhibitory effect on residents’ participation in outdoor exercise, and has passed the robustness test and endogeneity test. Further testing found that the inhibitory effect was significantly different between urban and rural areas, and in the central, north-eastern and western regions where economic development was relatively backward, the conclusion that air pollution inhibited residents’ outdoor exercise behaviour still holds true. However, the level of air pollution had no significant effect on the outdoor exercise behaviour of residents in the eastern region. So, while air pollution discourages residents from participating in outdoor exercise, the results are more applicable to less economically developed areas."

Evidence from other disciplines has demonstrated area-based estimates may be biased if there is spatial heterogeneity in product distribution, but this bias has not yet been assessed in the context of contraceptive supply estimates. The Consumer's Marker for Family Planning (CM4FP) study conducted censuses and product audits of contraceptive outlets across 12 study sites and 2-3 rounds of quarterly data collection in Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. We assessed bias in estimates of contraceptive product availability by comparing estimates from simulations of area-based sampling approaches with census counts among all audited facilities for each study site and round of data collection. We found evidence of bias in estimates of contraceptive availability generated from simulated area-based sampling. Within specific study sites and rounds, we observed biased sampling estimates for several but not all contraceptive method types, with bias more likely to occur in sites with heterogeneity in both spatial distribution of outlets and product availability within outlets. In simulations varying size of enumeration areas (EA) and number of outlets sampled per EA, we demonstrated that the likelihood of substantial bias decreases as EA size decreases and as the number of outlets sampled per EA increases. Straightforward approaches such as increasing sample size per EA or applying statistical weights may be used to reduce area-based sampling bias, indicating a pragmatic way forward to improve estimates where design-based sampling is infeasible. Such approaches should be considered in development of improved methods for area-based estimates of contraceptive supply-side environments."
https://openalex.org/W4293585902,"Researchers have long observed that foreign-educated immigrants earn lower wages and hold less-skilled jobs than U.S. natives who have the same level of educational attainment, but the reasons for the disparity have been less clear. This paper tests the hypothesis favored by the human capital model of earnings and employment-namely, that foreign-educated immigrants struggle in the U.S. labor market primarily because they possess fewer marketable skills than workers with U.S. degrees. Standardized tests administered as part of the Program for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies reveal that foreign-educated immigrants score 0.82 and 0.54 standard deviations lower on measures of literacy and numeracy, respectively, compared to natives who have the same age and educational attainment. The gaps remain significant after controlling for self-assessed English reading ability. When these skill measures are incorporated into regression analyses, the wage and skilled-employment penalties experienced by foreign-educated immigrants fall by half or more, providing strong evidence for the human capital model. However, this analysis cannot rule out additional explanatory factors, such as legal and social obstacles that foreign-educated immigrants may face."

Measures of daytime sleepiness and other sleep parameters (sleep duration on weekdays and weekends), eating habits, and mood depression questionnaires were reported.Differences in BMI between males and females were statistically significant (26.12 ± 4.5 vs. 24.4 ± 4.3; p < 0.01). There was a negative linear association (p < 0.01) between the students' BMI and the weekday/ weekend sleep duration. The average weekday and weekend sleep duration ranged from 5.7 hours (weekdays) to 9.3 hours(weekend). The study showed that an increase in BMI was correlated to mood depression (r = 0.396, p<0.01). In terms of eating habits, there was a significant association between eating unhealthy food and sleep duration; 72.6% of students who slept less than 6 hours reported unhealthy eating habits (p <0.05).The study showed a clear association between short sleep duration and obesity among adolescents in the UAE.

One cause of adverse drug events is the underlying genetic variation that can alter drug responses. Pharmacogenomics is a growing field that seeks to better understand the relationship between a patient's genetics and drug efficacy. Currently, pharmacogenomics relies largely on human trials, as there is not a well-developed animal model for studying preventative measures and alternative treatments. Here, we analyzed pharmacogene expression at two developmental time points in zebrafish to demonstrate the potential of using this model organism for high-throughput pharmacogenomics research. We found that 76% of tiered human pharmacogenes have a zebrafish ortholog, and of these, many have highly conserved amino acid sequences. Additional gene ontology analysis was used to classify pharmacogenes and identify candidate pathways for future modeling in zebrafish. As precision medicine burgeons, adopting a high-throughput in vivo model such as the zebrafish could greatly increase our understanding of the molecular pathology underlying adverse drug events."

Similarly, levels of PPD-specific T cell activation markers (HLA-DR, CD-38) were significantly lower in smear positive PTB patients following treatment, whereas a consistent decline in these markers was less apparent among smear negative PTB patients at the sixth month.After six months of standard anti-TB therapy, persistent levels of activation of HLA-DR and CD-38 from PPD specific CD4+T cells in this study could indicate that those markers have little value in monitoring and predicting anti-TB treatment response in smear negative pulmonary TB patients in Ethiopian context."
https://openalex.org/W4293677452,"Busana et al. (doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.00871.2020) published 5 patients with COVID-19 in whom the fraction of non-aerated lung tissue had been quantified by computed tomography. They assumed that shunt flow fraction was proportional to the non-aerated lung fraction, and, by randomly generating 106 different bimodal distributions for the ventilation-perfusion ([Formula: see text]) ratios in the lung, specified as sets of paired values {[Formula: see text]}, sought to identify as solutions those that generated the observed arterial partial pressures of CO2 and O2 (PaCO2 and PaO2). Our study sought to develop a direct method of calculation to replace the approach of randomly generating different distributions, and so provide more accurate solutions that were within the measurement error of the blood-gas data. For the one patient in whom Busana et al. did not find solutions, we demonstrated that the assumed shunt flow fraction led to a non-shunt blood flow that was too low to support the required gas exchange. For the other four patients, we found precise solutions (prediction error < 1x10-3 mmHg for both PaCO2 and PaO2), with distributions qualitatively similar to those of Busana et al. These distributions were extremely wide and unlikely to be physically realisable, because they predict the maintenance of very large concentration gradients in regions of the lung where convection is slow. We consider that these wide distributions arise because the assumed value for shunt flow is too low in these patients, and we discuss possible reasons why the assumption relating to shunt flow fraction may break down in COVID-19 pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W4293700724,"Understanding normative retinal thickness characteristics is critical for diagnosis and monitoring of pathology, particularly in those predisposed to retinal disease. The macular retinal layer thickness of Australian Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children was examined using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography.High-resolution macular optical coherence tomography imaging was performed on 100 Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children and 150 non-Indigenous visually healthy children aged 4-18 years. The imaging protocol included a 6-line radial scan centred on the fovea. Images were segmented using semi-automated software to derive thickness of the total retina, inner and outer retina, and individual retinal layers across the macular region. Repeated measures ANOVAs examined variations in thickness associated with retinal region, age, gender and Indigenous status.Retinal thickness showed significant topographical variations (p < 0.01), being thinnest in the foveal zone, and thickest in the parafovea. The retina of Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children was significantly thinner than non-Indigenous children in the foveal (p < 0.001), parafoveal (p = 0.002), and perifoveal zones (p = 0.01), with the greatest difference in the foveal zone (mean difference: 14.2 μm). Inner retinal thickness was also thinner in Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children compared to non-Indigenous children in the parafoveal zone (p < 0.001), and outer retinal thickness was thinner in the foveal (p < 0.001) and perifoveal zone (p < 0.001). Retinal thickness was also significantly greater in males than females (p < 0.001) and showed a statistically significant positive association with age (p = 0.01).There are significant differences in macular retinal thickness between Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander children and non-Indigenous children, which has implications for interpreting optical coherence tomography data and may relate to risk of macula disease in this population."
https://openalex.org/W4293701530,"Background and objectives The 6-minute walk test (6MWT) is a field test commonly used to predict peak oxygen consumption (VO 2peak ) in people after stroke. Inclusion of cardiodynamic variables measured by impedance cardiography (ICG) during a 6MWT has been shown to improve prediction of VO 2peak in healthy adults but these data have not been considered in people after stroke. This study investigates whether the prediction of VO 2peak can be improved by the inclusion of cardiovascular indices derived by impedance cardiography (ICG) during the 6MWT in people after stroke. Methods This was a cross-sectional study. Patients diagnosed with stroke underwent in random order, a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET) and 6MWT in separate dates. Heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV) and cardiac output (CO) were measured by ICG during all tests. Oxygen consumption was recorded by a metabolic cart during the CPET. Recorded data were subjected to multiple regression analyses to generate VO 2peak prediction equations. Results Fifty-nine patients, mean age 50.0±11.7 years were included in the analysis. The mean distance covered in the 6MWT (6MWD) was 294±13 m, VO 2peak was 19.2±3.2 ml/min/kg. Mean peak HR, SV and CO recorded during 6MWT were 109±6 bpm, 86.3±8.8 ml, 9.4±1.2 L/min and during CPET were 135±14 bpm, 86.6±9 ml, 11.7±2 L/min respectively. The prediction equation with inclusion of cardiodynamic variables: 16.855 + (-0.060 x age) + (0.196 x BMI) + (0.01 x 6MWD) + (-0.416 x SV 6MWT ) + (3.587 x CO 6MWT) has a higher squared multiple correlation ( R 2 ) and a lower standard error of estimate (SEE) and SEE% compared to the equation using 6MWD as the only predictor. Conclusion Inclusion of SV and CO measured during the 6MWT in stroke patients further improved the VO 2peak prediction power compared to using 6MWD as a lone predictor."
