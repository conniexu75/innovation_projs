https://openalex.org/W1801185313,"Consistent expanding urbanization dramatically transforms natural habitats and exposes organisms to novel environmental challenges, often leading to reduced species richness and diversity in cities. However, it remains unclear how individuals are affected by the urban environment and how they can or cannot adjust to the specific characteristics of urban life (e.g. food availability). In this study, we used an integrative multi-component approach to investigate the effects of urbanization on the nutritional status of house sparrows (Passer domesticus). We assessed several morphological and physiological indices of body condition in both juveniles (early post-fledging) and breeding adults from four sites with different levels of urbanization in France, Western Europe. We found that sparrows in more urbanized habitats have reduced body size and body mass compared to their rural conspecifics. However, we did not find any consistent differences in a number of complementary indices of condition (scaled mass index, muscle score, hematocrit, baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels) between urban and rural birds, indicating that urban sparrows may not be suffering nutritional stress. Our results suggest that the urban environment is unlikely to energetically constrain adult sparrows, although other urban-related variables may constrain them. On the other hand, we found significant difference in juvenile fat scores, suggesting that food types provided to young sparrows differed highly between habitats. In addition to the observed smaller size of urban sparrows, these results suggest that the urban environment is inadequate to satisfy early-life sparrows' nutritional requirements, growth, and development. The urban environment may therefore have life-long consequences for developing birds."

The cytochrome P450 51 (CYP51) inhibitor voriconazole is currently the drug of choice, yet the treatment efficiency remains low, calling for rational development of more efficient agents. A. fumigatus has two CYP51 genes, CYP51A and CYP51B, which share 59% amino acid sequence identity. CYP51B is expressed constitutively, whereas gene CYP51A is reported to be inducible. We expressed, purified, and characterized A. fumigatus CYP51B, including determination of its substrate preferences, catalytic parameters, inhibition, and x-ray structure in complexes with voriconazole and the experimental inhibitor (R)-N-(1-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-2-(1H-imidazol-1-yl)ethyl)-4-(5-phenyl-1,3,4-oxadiazol-2-yl)benzamide (VNI). The enzyme demethylated its natural substrate eburicol and the plant CYP51 substrate obtusifoliol at steady-state rates of 17 and 16 min−1, respectively, but did not metabolize lanosterol, and the topical antifungal drug miconazole was the strongest inhibitor that we identified. The x-ray crystal structures displayed high overall similarity of A. fumigatus CYP51B to CYP51 orthologs from other biological kingdoms but revealed phylum-specific differences relevant to enzyme catalysis and inhibition. The complex with voriconazole provides an explanation for the potency of this relatively small molecule, whereas the complex with VNI outlines a direction for further enhancement of the efficiency of this new inhibitory scaffold to treat humans afflicted with filamentous fungal infections."

Only a few drugs are available to treat diseases such as leishmaniasis, Chagas' disease, human African trypanosomiasis and malaria. Since drug development is lengthy and expensive, a drug repurposing strategy offers an attractive fast-track approach to speed up the process. A set of 100 registered drugs with drug repositioning potential for neglected diseases was assembled and tested in vitro against four protozoan parasites associated with the aforementioned diseases. Several drugs and drug classes showed in vitro activity in those screening assays. The results are critically reviewed and discussed in the perspective of a follow-up drug repositioning strategy where R&D has to be addressed with limited resources."

In addition to its role in maintaining and improving the health status of individuals and households, it impacts the economic prosperity of a society through its positive effects on labor productivity. Given this context, this paper assesses socioeconomic-differentials in the impact of out-of-pocket-health-expenditure (OOPHE) on impoverishment in China and India, two of the fastest growing economies of the world.The paper uses data from the World Health Organisation's Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (WHO SAGE), and Bivariate as well as Multivariate analyses for investigating the socioeconomic-differentials in the impact of out-of-pocket-health-expenditure (OOPHE) on impoverishment in China and India.Annually, about 7% and 8% of the population in China and India, respectively, fall in poverty due to OOPHE. Also, the percentage shortfall in income for the population from poverty line due to OOPHE is 2% in China and 1.3% in India. Further, findings from the multivariate analysis indicate that lower wealth status and inpatient as well as outpatient care increase the odds of falling below poverty line significantly (with the extent much higher in the case of in-patient care) due to OOPHE in both China and India. In addition, having at least an under-5 child in the household, living in rural areas and having a household head with no formal education increases the odds of falling below poverty line significantly (compared to a head with college level education) due to OOPHE in China; whereas having at least an under-5 child, not having health insurance and residing in rural areas increases the odds of becoming poor significantly due to OOPHE in India."
https://openalex.org/W1733092092,"Pelagic ecosystems can become depleted of dissolved oxygen as a result of both natural processes and anthropogenic effects. As dissolved oxygen concentration decreases, energy shifts from macrofauna to microorganisms, which persist in these hypoxic zones. Oxygen-limited regions are rapidly expanding globally; however, patterns of microbial communities associated with dissolved oxygen gradients are not yet well understood. To assess the effects of decreasing dissolved oxygen on bacteria, we examined shifts in bacterial community structure over space and time in Hood Canal, Washington, USA-a glacial fjord-like water body that experiences seasonal low dissolved oxygen levels known to be detrimental to fish and other marine organisms. We found a strong negative association between bacterial richness and dissolved oxygen. Bacterial community composition across all samples was also strongly associated with the dissolved oxygen gradient, and significant changes in bacterial community composition occurred at a dissolved oxygen concentration between 5.18 and 7.12 mg O2 L(-1). This threshold value of dissolved oxygen is higher than classic definitions of hypoxia (<2.0 mg O2 L(-1)), suggesting that changes in bacterial communities may precede the detrimental effects on ecologically and economically important macrofauna. Furthermore, bacterial taxa responsible for driving whole community changes across the oxygen gradient are commonly detected in other oxygen-stressed ecosystems, suggesting that the patterns we uncovered in Hood Canal may be relevant in other low oxygen ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2129909745,"Background The overarching goal of this project is to establish a patient-derived bladder cancer xenograft (PDX) platform, annotated with deep sequencing and patient clinical information, to accelerate the development of new treatment options for bladder cancer patients. Herein, we describe the creation, initial characterization and use of the platform for this purpose. Methods and Findings Twenty-two PDXs with annotated clinical information were established from uncultured unselected clinical bladder cancer specimens in immunodeficient NSG mice. The morphological fidelity was maintained in PDXs. Whole exome sequencing revealed that PDXs and parental patient cancers shared 92–97% of genetic aberrations, including multiple druggable targets. For drug repurposing, an EGFR/HER2 dual inhibitor lapatinib was effective in PDX BL0440 (progression-free survival or PFS of 25.4 days versus 18.4 days in the control, p = 0.007), but not in PDX BL0269 (12 days versus 13 days in the control, p = 0.16) although both expressed HER2. To screen for the most effective MTT, we evaluated three drugs (lapatinib, ponatinib, and BEZ235) matched with aberrations in PDX BL0269; but only a PIK3CA inhibitor BEZ235 was effective (p<0.0001). To study the mechanisms of secondary resistance, a fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 inhibitor BGJ398 prolonged PFS of PDX BL0293 from 9.5 days of the control to 18.5 days (p<0.0001), and serial biopsies revealed that the MAPK/ERK and PIK3CA-AKT pathways were activated upon resistance. Inhibition of these pathways significantly prolonged PFS from 12 day of the control to 22 days (p = 0.001). To screen for effective chemotherapeutic drugs, four of the first six PDXs were sensitive to the cisplatin/gemcitabine combination, and chemoresistance to one drug could be overcome by the other drug. Conclusion The PDX models described here show good correlation with the patient at the genomic level and known patient response to treatment. This supports further evaluation of the PDXs for their ability to accurately predict a patient’s response to new targeted and combination strategies for bladder cancer."
https://openalex.org/W1574604144,"Disease modifying treatments for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) constitute a major goal in medicine. Current trends suggest that biomarkers reflective of AD neuropathology and modifiable by treatment would provide supportive evidence for disease modification. Nevertheless, a lack of quantitative tools to assess disease modifying treatment effects remains a major hurdle. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical markers such as total tau, p-tau and Ab42 are well established markers of AD; however, global quantitative biochemical changes in CSF in AD disease progression remain largely uncharacterized. Here we applied a high resolution open discovery platform, dMS, to profile a cross-sectional cohort of lumbar CSF from post-mortem diagnosed AD patients versus those from non-AD/non-demented (control) patients. Multiple markers were identified to be statistically significant in the cohort tested. We selected two markers SME-1 (p<0.0001) and SME-2 (p = 0.0004) for evaluation in a second independent longitudinal cohort of human CSF from post-mortem diagnosed AD patients and age-matched and case-matched control patients. In cohort-2, SME-1, identified as neuronal secretory protein VGF, and SME-2, identified as neuronal pentraxin receptor-1 (NPTXR), in AD were 21% (p = 0.039) and 17% (p = 0.026) lower, at baseline, respectively, than in controls. Linear mixed model analysis in the longitudinal cohort estimate a decrease in the levels of VGF and NPTXR at the rate of 10.9% and 6.9% per year in the AD patients, whereas both markers increased in controls. Because these markers are detected by mass spectrometry without the need for antibody reagents, targeted MS based assays provide a clear translation path for evaluating selected AD disease-progression markers with high analytical precision in the clinic."

Although RAF inhibitors produce high response rates, the degree of tumor regression is heterogeneous. Compensatory/adaptive responses to targeted inhibitors are frequently initiated by the activation of growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases, including ErbB3, and factors from the tumor microenvironment may play an important role. We have shown previously that mutant v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) melanoma cells have enhanced activation of ErbB3 following RAF inhibition. However, the source of neuregulin 1 (NRG1), the ligand for ErbB3, is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that NRG1 is highly expressed by dermal fibroblasts and cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) isolated from mutant BRAF melanomas. Conditioned medium from fibroblasts and CAFs enhanced ErbB3 pathway activation and limited RAF inhibitor cytotoxicity in V600 mutant BRAF-harboring melanomas. Targeting the ErbB3/ErbB2 pathway partially reversed the protective effects of fibroblast/CAF-derived NRG1 on cell growth properties of RAF inhibitor-treated melanoma cells. These findings support the idea that NRG1, acting in a paracrine manner, promotes resistance to RAF inhibitors and emphasize that targeting the ErbB3/ErbB2 pathway will likely improve the efficacy of RAF inhibitors for mutant BRAF melanoma patients.

https://openalex.org/W1131085297,"Rhodanese is a component of the mitochondrial H2S oxidation pathway. Rhodanese catalyzes the transfer of sulfane sulfur from glutathione persulfide (GSSH) to sulfite generating thiosulfate and from thiosulfate to cyanide generating thiocyanate. Two polymorphic variations have been identified in the rhodanese coding sequence in the French Caucasian population. The first, 306A→C, has an allelic frequency of 1% and results in an E102D substitution in the encoded protein. The second polymorphism, 853C→G, has an allelic frequency of 5% and leads to a P285A substitution. In this study, we have examined differences in the stability between wild-type rhodanese and the E102D and P285A variants and in the kinetics of the sulfur transfer reactions. The Asp-102 and Ala-285 variants are more stable than wild-type rhodanese and exhibit kcat/Km,CN values that are 17- and 1.6-fold higher, respectively. All three rhodanese forms preferentially catalyze sulfur transfer from GSSH to sulfite, generating thiosulfate and glutathione. The kcat/Km,sulfite values for the variants in the sulfur transfer reaction from GSSH to sulfite were 1.6- (Asp-102) and 4-fold (Ala-285) lower than for wild-type rhodanese, whereas the kcat/Km,GSSH values were similar for all three enzymes. Thiosulfate-dependent H2S production in murine liver lysate is low, consistent with a role for rhodanese in sulfide oxidation. Our studies show that polymorphic variations that are distant from the active site differentially modulate the sulfurtransferase activity of human rhodanese to cyanide versus sulfite and might be important in differences in susceptibility to diseases where rhodanese dysfunction has been implicated, e.g. inflammatory bowel diseases."
https://openalex.org/W1760837124,"Microvascular changes in the skin due to pharmacological and physiological provocations can be used as a marker for vascular function. While laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) has been used extensively for measurement of skin microvascular responses, Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) and Tissue Viability Imaging (TiVi) are novel imaging techniques. TiVi measures red blood cell concentration, while LDF and LSCI measure perfusion. Therefore, the aim of this study was to compare responses to provocations in the skin using these different techniques.Changes in skin microcirculation were measured in healthy subjects during (1) iontophoresis of sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and noradrenaline (NA), (2) local heating and (3) post-occlusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) using LDF, LSCI and TiVi.Iontophoresis of SNP increased perfusion (LSCI: baseline 40.9±6.2 PU; 10-min 100±25 PU; p<0.001) and RBC concentration (TiVi: baseline 119±18; 10-min 150±41 AU; p = 0.011). No change in perfusion (LSCI) was observed after iontophoresis of NA (baseline 38.0±4.4 PU; 10-min 38.9±5.0 PU; p = 0.64), while RBC concentration decreased (TiVi: baseline 59.6±11.8 AU; 10-min 54.4±13.3 AU; p = 0.021). Local heating increased perfusion (LDF: baseline 8.8±3.6 PU; max 112±55 PU; p<0.001, LSCI: baseline 50.8±8.0 PU; max 151±22 PU; p<0.001) and RBC concentration (TiVi: baseline 49.2±32.9 AU; max 99.3±28.3 AU; p<0.001). After 5 minutes of forearm occlusion with prior exsanguination, a decrease was seen in perfusion (LDF: p = 0.027; LSCI: p<0.001) and in RBC concentration (p = 0.045). Only LSCI showed a significant decrease in perfusion after 5 minutes of occlusion without prior exsanguination (p<0.001). Coefficients of variation were lower for LSCI and TiVi compared to LDF for most responses.LSCI is more sensitive than TiVi for measuring microvascular changes during SNP-induced vasodilatation and forearm occlusion. TiVi is more sensitive to noradrenaline-induced vasoconstriction. LSCI and TiVi show lower inter-subject variability than LDF. These findings are important to consider when choosing measurement techniques for studying skin microvascular responses."
https://openalex.org/W2214009233,"Background There is limited and inconclusive evidence that space environment, especially microgravity condition, may affect microstructure of human brain. This experiment hypothesized that there would be modifications in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) of the brain due to microgravity. Method Eighteen male volunteers were recruited and fourteen volunteers underwent -6° head-down bed rest (HDBR) for 30 days simulated microgravity. High-resolution brain anatomical imaging data and diffusion tensor imaging images were collected on a 3T MR system before and after HDBR. We applied voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics analysis to investigate the structural changes in GM and WM of brain. Results We observed significant decreases of GM volume in the bilateral frontal lobes, temporal poles, parahippocampal gyrus, insula and right hippocampus, and increases of GM volume in the vermis, bilateral paracentral lobule, right precuneus gyrus, left precentral gyrus and left postcentral gyrus after HDBR. Fractional anisotropy (FA) changes were also observed in multiple WM tracts. Conclusion These regions showing GM changes are closely associated with the functional domains of performance, locomotion, learning, memory and coordination. Regional WM alterations may be related to brain function decline and adaption. Our findings provide the neuroanatomical evidence of brain dysfunction or plasticity in microgravity condition and a deeper insight into the cerebral mechanisms in microgravity condition."

Inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) is composed of two molecules of phosphate (Pi) linked by a phosphoanhydride bond. PPi has been proposed as an evolutionary precursor of ATP and GTP (1Liu C.L. Hart N. Peck H.D. Inorganic pyrophosphate: energy source for sulfate-reducing bacteria of the genus Desulfotomaculum.Science. 1982; 217: 363-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) because this structurally simple compound can be formed spontaneously, and the hydrolysis of PPi produces high energy (2Gest H.

If ancestral organisms could utilize only PPi or polyphosphates as an energy and/or phosphate donor for enzymatic reactions, there should have been an event in which new enzymes utilizing ATP/GTP arose. This further raises the question of how organisms change the major substrate: by accumulation of mutation on the enzyme to change the substrate specificity from PPi to nucleotide triphosphate or the substitution of PPi-utilizing enzymes by an independently emerging functional homolog that utilizes nucleotide triphosphates. To gain insight into the evolutionary transition from PPi to nucleotide triphosphate, the evolutionary relationship between the extant PPi- and ATP/GTP- utilizing enzymes has been examined (4Mertens E.

In glycolytic/gluconeogenic pathways and the closely related reactions in current organisms, three enzymatic reactions that can utilize PPi as the substrate have been reported.

In higher plants, it has been shown that PPi-PFK works in the opposite direction, at least during internode developmental stages (14van der Merwe M.J. Groenewald J.-H. Stitt M. Kossmann J. Botha F.C.

Therefore, PPi-PFK can catalyze both PPi-utilizing and PPi-producing reactions not only in vivo but also in vitro. ATP- and PPi-PFK share a common origin, but the evolutionary history is highly complex. Change of the phosphate donors in PFKs occurred more than once, as suggested by phylogenetic analyses of ATP- and PPi-PFKs (6Siebers B. Klenk H.P. Hensel R.

Biochem. 1997; 250: 698-704Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The complex evolution of substrate utility in PFK suggests that, at least in PFK, the transition of PPi-utilizing and nucleotide triphosphate-utilizing ability can have occurred relatively easily. Indeed, mutation of just a few amino acids can change the substrate preference from PPi to ATP, based on the ratio of kcat/Km (8Chi A. Kemp R.G. The primordial high energy compound: ATP or inorganic pyrophosphate?.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35677-35679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The second reaction utilizing PPi is catalyzed by pyruvate phosphate dikinase (PPDK; EC 2.7.9.1). PPi + AMP + PEP ⇔ Pi + ATP + pyruvateREACTION 3 PEP-pyruvate conversion is also catalyzed by PPi-independent enzymes, PEP synthase (EC 2.7.9.2; Reaction 4) and pyruvate kinase (EC 2.7.1.40; Reaction 5). Pi + AMP + PEP ⇔ ATP + pyruvateADP + PEP ⇒ ATP + pyruvateREACTIONS 4 AND 5 PPDK and PEP synthase share conserved domains, whereas overall amino acid sequence similarity is not high (16Niersbach M. Kreuzaler F. Geerse R.H. Postma P.W. Hirsch H.J. Cloning and nucleotide sequence of the Escherichia coli K-12 ppsA gene, encoding PEP synthase.Mol. Gen. Genet. 1992; 231: 332-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neither PPDK nor PEP synthase shows substantial similarity to pyruvate kinase at the primary structure level. This case is apparently distinguishable from that of PFK because transition of substrate utility for the PEP-pyruvate conversion has not occurred by simple amino acid substitutions, as seen in PFK. The third mechanism is a PEP-oxaloacetate interconverting reaction catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). Because PEP is a key intermediate in a variety of metabolic processes in all living organisms (17Davies D. The central role of phosphoenolpyruvate in plant metabolism.Annu. Rev.

According to the phosphate donor to oxaloacetate, PEPCK can be divided into three types: GTP-PEPCK (EC 4.1.1.32), ATP-PEPCK (EC 4.1.1.49), and PPi-PEPCK (EC 4.1.1.38). PEPCK reactions are fundamentally reversible; however, ATP- and GTP-PEPCKs prefer a PEP-producing reaction, whereas PPi-PEPCK prefers an oxaloacetate-producing reaction, at least in vitro (19Siu P.M.

PEP carboxylase (EC 4.1.1.31) also catalyzes PEP-oxaloacetate interconversion, but this reaction is irreversible and requires HCO3− instead of CO2 (18Sauer U. Eikmanns B.J.

ATP-PEPCKs are mainly present in bacteria, yeast, and plants, whereas GTP-PEPCKs are mostly present in higher eukaryotes, archaea, and some bacteria (21Fukuda W. Fukui T. Atomi H. Imanaka T.

Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 4620-4627Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). PEP carboxylase exists in various bacteria and in limited archaea and eukaryotes. Although there is no discernible similarity in the overall structure of these proteins, the residues implicated for the binding to metal, oxaloacetate/PEP, and nucleotides are conserved between ATP- and GTP-PEPCKs (22Aich S.

In contrast, the information on PPi-PEPCK, which is also called PEP carboxytransphosphorylase, is limited. Although PPi-PEPCK was previously purified from P. freudenreichii subsp. shermanii (19Siu P.M. Wood H.G.

Both the distribution of PPi-PEPCK among the three domains of life and the evolutionary relationship between other PEP-oxaloacetate interconverting enzymes were totally obscure. In the present study, we identified the protein for PPi-PEPCK activity and its encoding gene from E. histolytica and P. freudenreichii. The identification of PPi-PEPCK finally enabled us to compare the amino acid sequences of all three types of PEPCKs as well as PEP carboxylase. It also allowed us to estimate the distribution of PPi-PEPCK in the tree of life. Last, we described the complex evolutionary history of proteins utilizing different substrates for the same catalytic reaction. Trophozoites of E. histolytica clonal strain HM-1:IMSS Cl6 were maintained axenically in Diamond's BI-S-33 medium at 35.5 °C as described previously (28Diamond L.S. Harlow D.R. Cunnick C.C.

Cells were grown to the late logarithmic phase (2–3 days after inoculation), harvested by the addition of ice-cold PBS buffer to culture flasks, after discarding the medium, and followed by centrifugation at 300 × g for 5 min at 4 °C. For protein purification, the harvested cell pellets were stored at −80 °C until use. PPi and oxaloacetate-producing direct PEPCK activity was assayed by measuring the oxidation of NADH by detecting the decrease of absorbance at 340 nm as described previously (27Reeves R.E. Phosphopyruvate carboxylase from Entamoeba histolytica.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1970; 220: 346-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture contained 10 mm potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.4 mm PEP, 0.1 mm CoCl2, 20 mm KHCO3, 10 mm MgCl2, 2.0 units/ml malate dehydrogenase (from rabbit muscle; Sigma), 0.25 mm NADH, and an enzyme solution. Reaction was started by adding PEP, and the NADH oxidizing activity without the addition of PEP was subtracted as the base line. To obtain the absolute active value, 400 μl of the reaction mixture was added in 1.0-cm path length cuvettes, and absorbance was monitored by a spectrometer. To obtain the relative activity during the purification, 100 μl of the mixture was put in a 96-well plate and incubated at 37 °C, and 340 nm was monitored by a microplate reader. One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme oxidizing 1 μmol of NADH/min. EhPEPCK was purified from 5 g of wet cells as follows. The cells were suspended in 15 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mm CoCl2 (buffer A) and 0.5 mg/ml E-64 and disrupted by freezing and thawing, and cell debris was then removed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h. After the supernatant was diluted to 30 ml with buffer A, ammonium sulfate was added to give 30% saturation. The samples were then applied to a Butyl-Toyopearl column (22 × 15 cm; Tosoh, Tokyo, Japan) equilibrated with buffer A supplemented with ammonium sulfate at 30% saturation. All chromatography steps were performed using an ÄKTA purifier system (GE Healthcare) at room temperature. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of ammonium sulfate from 30 to 0% at a flow rate of 4 ml/min. The active fractions were desalted using a PD10 column (GE Healthcare) and then applied to a MonoQ HR 5/5 column (bed volume, 1 ml; GE Healthcare) equilibrated with buffer A. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of NaCl from 0 to 500 mm for 20 column volumes at a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. The active fractions were pooled and loaded onto a Superdex 200 (10/300) column (GE Healthcare). Proteins were eluted with buffer A supplemented with 150 mm NaCl. ∼130 kDa bands were excised from silver-stained gel and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis at the W. M. Keck Biomedical Mass Spectrometry Laboratory (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). The analysis was performed in almost the same manner as before (29Marumo K. Nakada-Tsukui K. Tomii K. Nozaki T. Ligand heterogeneity of the cysteine protease binding protein family in the parasitic protist Entamoeba histolytica.Int. J. Parasitol. 2014; 44: 625-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar); the only difference was that 5 μl of the extract was injected to a reversed-phase capillary column, and peptides were eluted over 0.3 h. To estimate the relative ratio of EhPEPCK1, -2, and -3 in the analyzed sample, the peak area for the selected ion chromatogram of the monoisotopic mass of the most abundant charge state (±0.02 Da) for each peptide was quantified. Three peptides conserved in all three proteins, specific to EhPEPCK1, and conserved only in EhPEPCK2 and -3, respectively, and one peptide unique to EhPEPCK2 or -3, respectively, were selected for the analysis because these peptides were detected in all three samples: immunoprecipitated samples (see below) using EhPEPCK1-HA, EhPEPCK2-HA, and purified PPi-PEPCK from the wild-type amoeba lysate. The sum of the peak area value of the three peptides conserved in all was used for normalization. For expression in Escherichia coli, the protein coding sequences of EhPEPCK1 (XP_654765.1) and EhPEPCK2 (XP_650862.1) genes were PCR-amplified from E. histolytica cDNA using the following pair of forward and reverse primers: 5′-TCGAAGGTAGGCATATGTTTAATCAAGAAAAAGGTACC-3′ (PEPCK_1_pCold_F) and 5′-ATTCGGATCCCTCGATTAATGTTTCATGCATTTGTATG-3′ (PEPCK_1_2_pCold_R) for PEPCK1 and 5′-TCGAAGGTAGGCATATGTTTAATCAAGAACAAGGTA-3′ (PEPCK_2_pCold_F) and PEPCK_1_2_pCold_R for PEPCK2. For expression in E. histolytica trophozoites with a hemagglutinin (HA) tag at the C termini, the protein coding sequences of EhPEPCK1 and -2 genes were PCR-amplified using the following primers: 5′-ACACATTAACAGATCATGTTTAATCAAGAAAAAGGTAC-3′ (PEPCK_1_pEhExHA_F) and 5′-ATGGATACATAGAATGTTTCATGCATTTGTATG-3′ (PEPCK_1_2_pEhExHA_R) and 5′-ACACATTAACAGATCATGTTTAATCAAGAACAAGGTA-3′ (PEPCK_2_pEhExHA_F) and PEPCK_1_2_pEhExHA_R, respectively. pColdI (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and pEhExHA (30Nakada-Tsukui K.

The amplified fragments were inserted into the plasmids cut with NdeI and XhoI (pColdI) or BglII (pEhExHA) using the In-Fusion HD cloning system (Takara). The PPi-PEPCK gene from P. freudenreichii subsp. freudenreichii (PfPEPCK; LC062511) was PCR-amplified from the genomic DNA (DSM 20271) purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures using the primers 5′-TCGAAGGTAGGCATAATGTCCGTAGTCGAACGC-3′ (Pf_PEPCK_pCold_F) and 5′-ATTCGGATCCCTCGATCAGACGAACCTGGGCTG-3′ (Pf_PEPCK_pCold_R) and cloned into pColdI as described above. The plasmids for bacterial expression were introduced into E. coli BL21 CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL (EhPEPCK1 and -2; Agilent) and E. coli BL21 Star (DE3) (PfPEPCK; Life Technologies, Inc.). The hosts transformed with the expression plasmids were inoculated into 400 ml or Luria-Bertani medium in a 1-liter conical flask containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol if necessary. After cultivating the cells aerobically at 37 °C until the A600 reached ∼0.5, protein expressions were induced by cooling the culture on ice for 30 min and adding 0.1 mm isopropyl thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to the medium, followed by overnight cultivation at 15 °C. Harvested cells (∼8 g of wet cells from 1.2 liters of culture) were disrupted by adding BugBuster (∼5 ml/g of wet cells; Merck), and cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Imidazole and NaCl concentrations in the supernatant were adjusted to 10 and 300 mm, respectively. The supernatant was then applied to an open column packed with Ni-NTA-agarose (1.5-ml bed volume; Qiagen). After washing the column with 16 bed volumes of 50 mm Tris-HCl, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 8.0), the His-tagged protein was eluted with 4 bed volumes of the same buffer containing 250 mm imidazole-HCl. The eluted proteins were further purified using a MonoQ column as described above. To make anti-EhPEPCK antisera, full-length EhPEPCK1 with a His tag at the N terminus was expressed in E. coli, purified using Ni-NTA and MonoQ columns as described above, and used as the antigen. The anti-EhPEPCK1 antisera from rabbit were commercially raised by Operon Biotechnology (Tokyo, Japan). The specificity of these antibodies was confirmed using E. histolytica lysates by Western blotting (WB) analysis (data not shown). The plasmids generated as described above were introduced into E. histolytica trophozoites by lipofection as described previously (31Nozaki T. Asai T. Sanchez L.B. Kobayashi S. Nakazawa M.

Approximately 40 μl of the transfection medium containing 3–5 μg of one of the plasmids was mixed with 10 μl of PLUSTM reagent (Life Technologies) and kept at room temperature for 15 min. This mixture was combined with 20 μl of LipofectamineTM transfection reagent mixed with 30 μl of transfection medium, kept at room temperature for 15 min, diluted with 400 μl of transfection medium, and added to the seeded trophozoites attached to a 12-well plate after removing the medium. The plate was then incubated at 35.5 °C for 5 h, and cells were transferred to a tube containing 5.5 ml of BI-S-33 medium. About 24 h after transfection, BI-S-33 medium was changed into fresh medium with 1 μg/ml G418 and gradually increased for ∼2 weeks until the G418 concentration reached 10 μg/ml. Protein concentrations were measured using a Bio-Rad protein assay DC dye. Bovine γ-globulin was used as a standard. Protein samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE after boiling at 95 °C for 3 min with SDS-PAGE loading buffer. Proteins in the gel were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane and then blocked with 5% (w/v) skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20 (TBST) overnight at 4 °C. Proteins on the membrane were reacted with antibodies in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. Primary antibodies were used at a 1:5000 dilution for anti-EhPEPCK rabbit antibody and at a 1:1000 dilution for anti-cysteine synthase 1 (32Nozaki T. Asai T. Kobayashi S. Ikegami F. Noji M. Saito K.

The blots were visualized using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit or mouse IgG antibody (1:2000 dilution; Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA) with AP Color Reagent (Bio-Rad) according to the manufacturer's protocol. To examine the interaction between EhPEPCKs, 0.08 g of wet cells expressing PEPCK1-HA, PEPCK2-HA, or only HA were lysed with 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm CoCl2, 0.2% Triton X-100, 0.5 mg/ml E-64) for 10 min on ice. After centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatants were precleaned with 150 μl of Protein G-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h. After removing the beads by centrifugation, the precleared supernatant samples were mixed and incubated with 50 μl of anti-HA monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) for 4 h. The agarose beads were washed with 400 μl of lysis buffer without E-64 five times (9300 × g for 1 min each) to remove the unbound proteins, and the bound proteins were eluted by incubating with 200 μl of lysis buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml HA peptide (Sigma-Aldrich) overnight. The eluted samples were collected by centrifugation at 800 × g for 3 min. All of the centrifugations and incubations were done at 4 °C otherwise mentioned. Homologues of PPi-PEPCK were searched by BLASTP analysis against the non-redundant protein sequence database using EhPEPCK1 as a query (May 5, 2015). In addition, we also retrieved the homologues of Mastigamoeba balamuthi and Spironucleus barkhanus by tBLASTN analysis against the whole genome shotgun reads and the expressed sequence tag database, respectively. Other eukaryotic counterparts were retrieved by tBLASTN analysis against the Marine Microbial Eukaryote Transcriptome Sequencing Project database (34Keeling P.J. Burki F. Wilcox H.M. Allam B.

https://openalex.org/W1923153985,"The proximal tibia (pT) is a common site for bone tumors. Improvements in imaging, chemotherapy and surgical technique made limb salvage surgery the treatment of choice. Yet, reconstructions of the pT have been associated with less favorable outcome compared to other parts of the extremities. The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcome of patients with a modular endoprosthetic reconstruction of the pT.Eighty-one consecutive patients with an average age of 29 years underwent endoprosthetic reconstruction of the pT. Postoperative complications were categorized according to the ISOLS classification, and revision-free survival until first complication (any Type 1-5), soft tissue failure (Type 1), aseptic loosening (Type 2), structural failure (Type 3), infection (Type 4), and local tumor progression (Type 5) was estimated by using a Fine-Gray model for competing risk analyses for univariate and multivariable regression with Firth's bias correction.A total of 45 patients (56%) had at least one complication. Cumulative incidence for complication Types 1 to 5 at 5 years with death and amputation as competing events revealed a risk of 41% for the first complication, 14% for Type 1, 16% for Type 2, 11% for Type 3, 17% for Type 4, and 1% for Type 5.Despite inclusion of amputation and death as strong competing events, pT replacements are still associated with a high risk of postoperative failures. The results suggest that infection and soft tissue failures (Type 1 and 5) seem to depend from each other. Sufficient soft tissue reconstruction and closure allow better function and reduce the risk of infection as the most prominent complication. The use of a rotating hinge design has significantly reduced structural failures over time."
https://openalex.org/W1140804260,"Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a common and potentially life-threatening complication in patients with hematological malignancies and therapy-induced neutropenia. Administration of broad spectrum antibiotics has substantially decreased the mortality rate in febrile neutropenia, but bacterial infection is documented in only one-third or fewer of the cases. BSI is typically diagnosed by blood culture; however, this method can detect only culturable pathogens.In the present study, a total of 130 blood samples from hematological patients receiving dose-intensive antitumoural treatment were subjected to 16S rRNA PCR and 62 of them were cultured. PCR positive samples were processed to high throughput sequencing by amplifying the V1-V3 regions of the 16S rRNA gene to obtain a full spectrum of bacteria present in BSI.Five phyla and 30 genera were identified with sequencing compared to 2 phyla and 4 genera with culture. The largest proportion of bacteria detected by sequencing belonged to Proteobacteria (55.2%), Firmicutes (33.4%) and Actinobacteria (8.6%), while Fusobacteria (0.4%) and Bacteroidetes (0.1%) were also detected. Ninety-eight percent of the bacteria identified by sequencing were opportunistic human pathogens and 65% belonged to the normal human microbiota.The present study indicates that BSIs in neutropenic hosts contain a much broader diversity of bacteria, likely with host origin, than previously realized. The elevated ratio of Proteobacteria in BSI corroborates the results found in other systemic inflammatory diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease or mucosal infections. This knowledge may become of value for tailoring antimicrobial drug administration."
https://openalex.org/W1938370355,"Our study explores inhibitory control across a range of widely recognised memory and behavioural tasks. Eighty-seven never-depressed participants completed a series of tasks designed to measure inhibitory control in memory and behaviour. Specifically, a variant of the selective retrieval-practice and the Think/No-Think tasks were employed as measures of memory inhibition. The Stroop-Colour Naming and the Go/No-Go tasks were used as measures of behavioural inhibition. Participants completed all 4 tasks. Task presentation order was counterbalanced across 3 separate testing sessions for each participant. Standard inhibitory forgetting effects emerged on both memory tasks but the extent of forgetting across these tasks was not correlated. Furthermore, there was no relationship between memory inhibition tasks and either of the main behavioural inhibition measures. At a time when cognitive inhibition continues to gain acceptance as an explanatory mechanism, our study raises fundamental questions about what we actually know about inhibition and how it is affected by the processing demands of particular inhibitory tasks."
https://openalex.org/W2160385897,"X-ray structures, molecular dynamics simulations, and mutational analysis have previously indicated that an extended water hydrogen bond network between trans-membranes I–III, VI, and VII constitutes an allosteric interface essential for stabilizing different active and inactive helical constellations during the seven-trans-membrane receptor activation. The neurokinin-1 receptor signals efficiently through Gq, Gs, and β-arrestin when stimulated by substance P, but it lacks any sign of constitutive activity. In the water hydrogen bond network the neurokinin-1 has a unique Glu residue instead of the highly conserved AspII:10 (2.50).

Mutational changes in the interface between GluII:10 and AsnVII:16 created receptors that selectively signaled through the following: 1) Gq only; 2) β-arrestin only; and 3) Gq and β-arrestin but not through Gs. Interestingly, increased constitutive Gs but not Gq signaling was observed by Ala substitution of four out of the six core polar residues of the network, in particular SerIII:15.

Surprisingly, the structures revealed that in the inactive state almost no hydrogen bonds are observed between the polar residues themselves. Instead, they interact through a number of structural water molecules generating the extended hydrogen bond network as shown for the inactive adenosine A2A receptor (A2AAR) and B2AR structures in Fig. 1, A–C (10Cherezov V.

In these structures, the sodium ion is coordinated by the highly conserved AspII:10 (2.50) in TM-II, SerIII:15 (3.39) in TM-III and nearby water molecules in a position previously shown to be taken up by either structural water molecules or left as a relatively large “empty space” in x-ray structures of inactive forms of other 7TM receptors (28Gutiérrez-de-Terán H.

Importantly, in the active structure of the B2AR and the active-like structures of the A2AAR, this region has undergone major conformational changes, including the well recognized major tilts of the intracellular parts of TM-V (inward) and TM-VI (outward) combined with an inward tilt of TM-VII (more than 2 Å combined with rotation), and an axial shift of TM-III (29Rasmussen S.G.

These movements eliminate much of the space occupied by water and the sodium ion in the inactive conformation so that in the active state the polar residues instead mainly make hydrogen bonds directly with each other (Fig. 1C). The notion that a sodium ion stabilizes the inactive conformation of 7TM receptors, and acts as negative allosteric modulators, was well established 1½ decades ago through studies of the α2A adrenergic receptor, the A2AAR, the μ- and δ-opioid receptors, and the D2 dopamine receptor, for example (31Costa T.

However, we now have structural proof of this interaction in the A2AAR and the δ-opioid receptor, which provides a detailed picture of how other residues besides AspII:10 (2.50) (in particular SerIII:15 (3.39)) are also involved in the binding of the allosteric negative regulator Na+ (16Liu W.

In this study, we investigate the relative role of different residues in the conserved polar interface in the neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptor, which is activated by substance P and signals through both the Gq and the Gs pathway (38Holst B.

A unique structural feature of the NK1 receptor is a glutamic acid residue in position II:10 (2.50), in contrast to aspartic acid found in more than 98% of other family A receptors (42Mirzadegan T.

Interestingly, the unstimulated NK1 receptor is very “silent” with no evidence of constitutive activity resulting from spontaneous transition to the active state. For more than 2 decades we have performed structural-functional studies on the NK1 receptor and have never observed measurable constitutive activity, and in contrast to most other 7TM receptors, we have never identified an NK1 mutant showing ligand-independent signaling (38Holst B.

This is particularly surprising as it is generally known in the field that it is rather easy to find mutations in 7TM receptors that make them signal with high constitutive activity. We now find that in molecular models of the NK1 receptor the γ-carboxylic acid group of the larger GluII:10 (2.50) side chain (compared with Asp) is located at or very close to the position where the negative allosteric modulating sodium ion is found in the A2AAR, the δ-opioid receptor, and the β1-adrenergic receptor, for example (27Fenalti G.

Mutational analysis indicates that GluII:10 and its two hydrogen bond partners in different ways are involved in tuning Gs versus Gq and β-arrestin signaling and that negative modulatory Na+ effects could be induced in the NK1 receptor by “reintroducing” Asp in position II:10. The sequence of the human NK1 receptor was obtained at the Uniprot web page. The distinct x-ray structures (available at the time the modelings were conducted) of 7TM receptors in inactive-like states (adenosine A2A (PDB code 4EIY), β1-adrenergic receptor (PDB code 2VT4), β2-adrenergic receptor (PDB code 2RH1), chemokine CXCR4 (PDB code 3ODU), chemokine CCR5 (PDB code 4MBS), dopamine D3 (PDB code 3PBL), histamine H1 (PDB code 3RZE), muscarinic M2 (PDB code 3OUN), muscarinic M3 (PDB code 4DAJ), serotonin 5HT1B (PDB code 4IAR), serotonin 5HT2B (PDB code 4IB4), μ-opioid (PDB code 4DKL), δ-opioid (PDB code 4EJ4), κ-opioid (PDB code 4DJH), nociceptin (PDB code 4EA3), protease-activated receptor 1 (PDB code 3VW7), sphingosine S1P (PDB code 3V2Y), and rhodopsin (PDB code 1GZM)) as well as the structures in active-like states (adenosine A2A (PDB code 3QAK), β2-adrenergic receptor (PDB code 3SN6), muscarinic M2 (PDB code 4MQS), neurotensin 1 receptor (PDB code 4GRV)) were obtained from the PDB database. The structures were superimposed with respect to the intracellular half of TM-I–III and -VII using the CEAlign protocol in PyMOL. Pairwise sequence alignments and comparative homology models (excluding intra- and extracellular loops) of the NK1 receptor were produced in ICM 3.7b using the inactive- and active-like structures of A2AAR and B2AR as templates that devised reasonable high sequence identity to the intracellular half of TM-I–III and -VII. GluII:10 was assumed to be negatively charged as it is located in-between SerIII:15 and ThrVII:13 in an optimal position to be involved in hydrogen bond interactions, the hydroxyl side chain of SerIII:15, and the co-existence of “conserved” bulky water molecules observed in other receptors with similar environments. Initially, hydrogen atoms and side chains were optimized using the comparative modeling protocol in ICM. When modeling the inactive state of NK1R, the sodium ion and structural water molecules of the template structures were “copied” to the comparative NK1 receptor models. The location of the sodium ion and water molecules was initially accessed in the presence of a fixed NK1 receptor model. The sodium ion and a nearby water molecule, which are involved in hydrogen bond interactions with AspII:10 and SerIII:15 in the parent A2AAR and B2AR structures, were removed from the NK1 receptor models as they make steric clashes with the larger (compared with Asp) carboxyl acid side chain of GluII:10 in the NK1 receptor models. Local optimization of side chains within 8 Å of this co-localized sodium ion/water molecule was unable to release the strain when optimizing all atoms using the biased probability Monte Carlo optimization protocol (200 global moves and 100 local minimization calls). To ensure acceptance of the remaining water molecules, side chains and water molecules were globally optimized using the Monte Carlo conformational sampling procedure in the presence of a fixed main chain conformation in ICM 3.7b. Finally, the resulting NK1 models were minimized in 300 steps of steepest decent, using the MMFF force field, and all atoms were free to move.

Geometric morphometric description of shape variation in the cephalic plate, forcipular coxosternite, and tergite of the ultimate leg-bearing segment provides additional criteria for distinguishing species. Colouration patterns in some Scolopendra species show a high degree of fit to phylogenetic trees at the population level. The most densely sampled species, Scolopendra dehaani Brandt, 1840, has three subclades with allopatric distributions in mainland SE Asia. The molecular phylogeny of S. pinguis Pocock, 1891, indicated ontogenetic colour variation among its populations. The taxonomic validation of S. dawydoffi Kronmüller, 2012, S. japonica Koch, 1878, and S. dehaani Brandt, 1840, each a former subspecies of S. subspinipes Leach, 1814 sensu Lewis, 2010, as full species was supported by molecular information and additional morphological data. Species delimitation in these taxonomically challenging animals is facilitated by an integrative approach that draws on both morphology and molecular phylogeny."
https://openalex.org/W1138859462,"The aim of this study is to assess the depression of pregnant women in the aftermath of an earthquake, and to identify the social support that they obtained, their coping styles and socio-demographic factors associated with depression.A total of 128 pregnant women from three hospitals in the epicenter area were recruited immediately after the Ya'an earthquake. Their depression was investigated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) with a cutoff score of 14; the social support that they obtained was measured using the Social Support Questionnaire; and their coping styles were assessed using the Coping Styles Questionnaire.Immediately after the earthquake, the incidence rate of depression in pregnant women was 35.2%, higher than that of the general pregnant population (7%-14%). The EPDS scores were significantly correlated with gestation age at the time of the earthquake, objective support, subjective support, use of support, negative coping style, and positive coping style. The regression analysis indicated that risk factors of prenatal depression include the number of children, relatives wounded, subjective support, and coping styles. A further analysis of the interaction between social support and two types of coping styles with depression showed that there was interaction effect between subjective social support and positive coping styles in relation to EPDS scores. There was an inverse relationship between low EPDS scores and positive coping styles and high social support, and vice versa.The timing of the occurrence of the earthquake may not necessarily affect the progress of the illness and recovery from depression, and psychological intervention could be conducted in the immediate aftermath after the earthquake. The impact of coping styles on prenatal depression appeared to be linked with social support. Helping pregnant women to adopt positive coping styles with good social support after a recent major earthquake, which is a stressor, may reduce their chances of developing prenatal depression."
https://openalex.org/W1766702213,"Introduction Although aspiration pneumonia is the most common complication of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), the clinical impact of aspiration pneumonia on disease course and survival has not been fully estimated. Thus, we retrospectively analyzed the prognostic factors and clinical consequences of pneumonia in PSP. Methods The clinical course of patients with aspiration pneumonia was surveyed. The association between baseline clinical features (2 years from disease onset) and latency to the initial development of pneumonia was investigated using survival time and Cox regression analyses. Results Ninety patients with a clinical diagnosis of PSP were observed for 5.1±3.8 years (mean±SD), and 22 had aspiration pneumonia. Subsequently, 20 patients (91%) had to discontinue oral feeding entirely and 13 (59%) died, whereas, of 68 patients without pneumonia, only three patients (4%) died. Time to initial development of pneumonia was strongly correlated with survival time (Spearman R = 0.92, P<0.001), with a mean latency of 2.3 years to death. Among baseline clinical features, early fall episodes and cognitive decline were significant predictors of pneumonia (P = 0.001 and P<0.001, respectively, log rank test). Cox regression analysis demonstrated that early fall episodes (adjusted hazard ratio: 3.9, 95% confidence interval: 1.2–12.5, P = 0.03) and cognitive decline (adjusted hazard ratio: 5.2, 95% confidence interval: 1.4–19.3, P = 0.02) independently predicted pneumonia. By contrast, dysphagia was not associated with pneumonia (P = 0.2, log rank test). Conclusion Initial development of pneumonia indicates an unfavorable clinical course and predicts survival time (mean survival time 2.3 years). Patients with early falls and cognitive decline were at high risk of early development of pneumonia."
https://openalex.org/W2158346570,"Diabetes mellitus comprises a heterogeneous group of disorders with the main feature of hyperglycemia. Chronic hyperglycemia increases the severity of periodontal disease via an exacerbated inflammatory response, activated by advanced glycation end products and their receptor, RAGE. Therefore, anti-inflammatory agents represent potential inhibitors of this pathological interaction. In particular, green tea has been shown to possess anti-inflammatory properties mediated by its polyphenol content. Objectives: This study investigated the mechanisms by which green tea attenuates the spontaneous onset of diabetes-induced periodontitis. Methods: Diabetes was induced in rats via a single intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ). Diabetic and control animals were divided into water-treated and green tea-treated subgroups and were analyzed at 15, 30, 60 and 90 days after diabetes induction. Immunohistochemistry was performed to quantitatively evaluate tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL), osteoprotegerin (OPG), interleukin-10 (IL-10) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX-2) expression in serial sections of each hemimaxilla. Morphometric measurements of the distance from the cementum-enamel junction (CEJ) of the superior distal root of the first molar to the alveolar bone crest (ABC) were performed to assess bone loss. Results: Diabetes resulted in significant bone loss and alterations in the number of cells that stained positive for inflammatory mediators. In the diabetic rats treated with green tea, we observed a decreased number of cells expressing RANKL and TNF-α compared with that observed in the diabetic rats treated with water. Additionally, green tea increased the numbers of cells that stained positive for OPG, RUNX-2 and IL-10 in the diabetic rats. Conclusion: Green tea intake reduces expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α and the osteoclastogenic mediator RANKL to normal levels while increasing expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, the osteogenesis-related factor RUNX-2 and the anti-osteoclastogenic factor OPG. Therefore, green tea represents a potential therapeutic agent for the treatment of diabetes-related periodontal disease."
https://openalex.org/W2381786691,"Modulator of apoptosis 1 (MOAP-1) is a BH3-like protein that plays key roles in cell death or apoptosis. It is an integral partner to the tumor suppressor protein, Ras association domain family 1A (RASSF1A), and functions to activate the Bcl-2 family pro-apoptotic protein Bax. Although RASSF1A is now considered a bona fide tumor suppressor protein, the role of MOAP-1 as a tumor suppressor protein has yet to be determined. In this study, we present several lines of evidence from cancer databases, immunoblotting of cancer cells, proliferation, and xenograft assays as well as DNA microarray analysis to demonstrate the role of MOAP-1 as a tumor suppressor protein. Frequent loss of MOAP-1 expression, in at least some cancers, appears to be attributed to mRNA down-regulation and the rapid proteasomal degradation of MOAP-1 that could be reversed utilizing the proteasome inhibitor MG132. Overexpression of MOAP-1 in several cancer cell lines resulted in reduced tumorigenesis and up-regulation of genes involved in cancer regulatory pathways that include apoptosis (p53, Fas, and MST1), DNA damage control (poly(ADP)-ribose polymerase and ataxia telangiectasia mutated), those within the cell metabolism (IR-α, IR-β, and AMP-activated protein kinase), and a stabilizing effect on microtubules. The loss of RASSF1A (an upstream regulator of MOAP-1) is one of the earliest detectable epigenetically silenced tumor suppressor proteins in cancer, and we speculate that the additional loss of function of MOAP-1 may be a second hit to functionally compromise the RASSF1A/MOAP-1 death receptor-dependent pathway and drive tumorigenesis.

https://openalex.org/W1807647196,"Patients with sickle cell disease have significant morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary hypertension is suggested to be an important contributor but its nature and severity in these patients and how best to non-invasively assess it are controversial. We hypothesised that a high-output state rather than primary pulmonary vascular pathology may be the major abnormality in sickle cell disease. This study aimed to evaluate the characteristics and severity of pulmonary hypertension in patients with sickle cell disease using detailed echocardiography.We undertook a prospective study in 122 consecutive stable outpatients with sickle cell disease and 30 age, gender and ethnicity-matched healthy controls. Echocardiographic evaluation included 3D ventricular volumes, sphericity, tissue Doppler, and non-invasive estimation of pulmonary vascular resistance. 36% of patients had a tricuspid regurgitant velocity ≥2.5 m.s(-1) but only 2% had elevated pulmonary vascular resistance and the prevalence of right ventricular dysfunction was very low. Patients with raised tricuspid regurgitant velocity had significantly elevated biventricular volumes and globular left ventricular remodelling, related primarily to anaemia. In a subgroup of patients who underwent cardiac catheterization, invasive pulmonary haemodynamics confirmed the echocardiographic findings.Elevated cardiac output and left ventricular volume overload secondary to chronic anaemia may be the dominant factor responsible for abnormal cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in patients with sickle cell disease. 3D echocardiography with non-invasive estimation of pulmonary vascular resistance represents a valuable approach for initial evaluation of cardiopulmonary haemodynamics in sickle cell disease."
https://openalex.org/W1794500876,"Objective Despite high mortality associated with serious mental illness, risk of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) remains unclear, especially for patients with bipolar disorder. The main objective was to investigate the relative risk of AMI associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorders in a national sample. Method Using nationwide administrative data, an 11-year historic cohort study was assembled, comprised of cases aged 18 and above who had received a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, compared to a random sample of all other adults excluding those with diagnoses of serious mental illness. Incident AMI as a primary diagnosis was ascertained. Hazard ratios stratified by age and gender were calculated and Cox regression models were used to adjust for other covariates. Results A total of 70,225 people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder and 207,592 people without serious mental illness were compared. Hazard ratios in men adjusted for age, income and urbanization were 1.15 (95% CI 1.01~1.32) for schizophrenia and 1.37 (1.08~1.73)for bipolar disorder, and in women, 1.85 (1.58~2.18) and 1.88(1.47~2.41) respectively. Further adjustment for treated hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidaemia attenuated the hazard ratio for men with schizophrenia but not the other comparison groups. Hazard ratios were significantly stronger in women than men and were stronger in younger compared to older age groups for both disorders; however, gender modification was only significant in people with schizophrenia, and age modification only significant in people with bipolar disorder. Conclusions In this large national sample, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder were associated with raised risk of AMI in women and in the younger age groups although showed differences in potential confounding and modifying factors."
https://openalex.org/W2102271070,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis harbors over 160 genes encoding PE/PPE proteins, several of which have roles in the pathogen’s virulence. A number of PE/PPE proteins are secreted via Type VII secretion systems known as the ESX secretion systems. One PE protein, LipY, has a triglyceride lipase domain in addition to its PE domain. LipY can regulate intracellular triglyceride levels and is also exported to the cell wall by one of the ESX family members, ESX-5. Upon export, LipY’s PE domain is removed by proteolytic cleavage. Studies using cells and crude extracts suggest that LipY’s PE domain not only directs its secretion by ESX-5, but also functions to inhibit its enzymatic activity. Here, we attempt to further elucidate the role of LipY’s PE domain in the regulation of its enzymatic activity. First, we established an improved purification method for several LipY variants using detergent micelles. We then used enzymatic assays to confirm that the PE domain down-regulates LipY activity. The PE domain must be attached to LipY in order to effectively inhibit it. Finally, we determined that full length LipY and the mature lipase lacking the PE domain (LipYΔPE) have similar melting temperatures. Based on our improved purification strategy and activity-based approach, we concluded that LipY’s PE domain down-regulates its enzymatic activity but does not impact the thermal stability of the enzyme."
https://openalex.org/W1795739696,"Rapid and accurate diagnosis of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) and virus serotyping are of paramount importance for control of this disease in endemic areas where vaccination is practiced. Ideally this virus characterization should be achieved without the need for virus amplification in cell culture. Due to the heterogeneity of FMD viruses (FMDVs) in different parts of the world, region specific diagnostic tests are required. In this study, hydrolysable probe-based real time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were developed for specific detection and serotyping of the FMDVs currently circulating in West Eurasia. These assays were evaluated, in parallel with pan-FMDV diagnostic assays and earlier serotype-specific assays, using field samples originating from Pakistan and Afghanistan containing FMD viruses belonging to different sublineages of O-PanAsia, A-Iran05 and Asia-1 (Group-II and Group-VII (Sindh-08)). In addition, field samples from Iran and Bulgaria, containing FMDVs belonging to the O-PanAsiaANT-10 sublineage were also tested. Each of the three primer/probe sets was designed to be specific for just one of the serotypes O, A and Asia-1 of FMDV and detected the RNA from the target viruses with cycle threshold (CT) values comparable with those obtained with the serotype-independent pan-FMDV diagnostic assays. No cross-reactivity was observed in these assays between the heterotypic viruses circulating in the region. The assays reported here have higher diagnostic sensitivity (100% each for serotypes O and Asia-1, and 92% [95% CI = 81.4–100%] for serotype A positive samples) and specificity (100% each for serotypes O, A and Asia-1 positive samples) for the viruses currently circulating in West Eurasia compared to the serotyping assays reported earlier. Comparisons of the sequences of the primers and probes used in these assays and the corresponding regions of the circulating viruses provided explanations for the poor recognition of some of the viruses by the earlier assays. These new assays should help in the early detection and typing of serotype O, A and Asia-1 FMDVs circulating in West Eurasia to enable improved disease control."
https://openalex.org/W1123136887,"Recent papers on monitoring of health services affirmed that while antenatal care (ANC) is an effective measure, quality is still a problem. Quality in maternal services ""…involves providing a minimum level of care to all pregnant women…"" Yet adherence to a minimum level of recommended ANC content appears to be unmet. Comprehensive review of ANC content rendered in environments with rapid changes in demographic, socio-economic, lifestyle and morbidity was sparse. Malaysia is such a country that has undergone these transitions with tremendous progress in health. However, recent progress in pregnancy outcomes is stagnating. This study aims to analyse adherence to recommended ANC; specifically, to examine the extent of adherence to recommended ANC content and to determine the factors influencing ANC content score.A retrospective cohort study of 522 randomly selected women who used ANC was conducted. Data were extracted from individual records. The study examined adherence to essential ANC guidelines using weighted scoring for physical examination, health screening, case management, and health education. GLM Univariate analysis procedure was used to determine the factors associated with ANC content score. Binary logistic regression was used to assess ANC content level and pregnancy outcomes, controlled for ANC utilisation.Around half of the women had <80% of recommended ANC content documented. Health education had the lowest mean score, at around 35%. The low-risk pregnancies had a higher ANC content score than the high-risk pregnancies (78% vs. 75%; P = 0.002). The smallest clinics had a higher ANC content score than the bigger clinics (78% vs. 74-76%; P<0.001). ANC content score among the women with ""adequate"" ANC utilisation, as defined by the modified Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilisation Index, was lower than the women with ""adequate-plus"" ANC utilisation (75% vs. 78%, P<0.001). Assessment of symphysis-fundal height, foetal presentation and foetal heart auscultation were initiated earlier than recommended. Inadequate ANC content was associated with higher prevalence of preterm birth.Our findings indicate the presence of issues related to delivery of recommended ANC content. We advocate for all pregnant women to be ensured of adherence to the recommended ANC content. We also recommend monitoring the delivery of health advice. Conforming to recommended timing of initiation for ANC practices is essential due to resource implication and possible implication on maternal wellbeing. The association of inadequate ANC content and preterm birth may be due to lesser opportunities to receive some of the care because of lower number of ANC visits among preterm birth; this may also indicate the importance of having adequate ANC content."
https://openalex.org/W1625782110,"PLEKHA7 is a junctional protein, which participates in a complex that stabilizes E-cadherin at the zonula adhaerens. Since E-cadherin is involved in epithelial morphogenesis, signaling, and tumor progression, we explored PLEKHA7 expression in cancer. PLEKHA7 expression was assessed in invasive ductal and lobular carcinomas of the breast by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and quantitative RT-PCR. PLEKHA7 was detected at epithelial junctions of normal mammary ducts and lobules, and of tubular and micropapillary structures within G1 and G2 ductal carcinomas. At these junctions, the localization of PLEKHA7 was along the circumferential belt (zonula adhaerens), and only partially overlapping with that of E-cadherin, p120ctn and ZO-1, as shown previously in rodent tissues. PLEKHA7 immunolabeling was strongly decreased in G3 ductal carcinomas and undetectable in lobular carcinomas. PLEKHA7 mRNA was detected in both ductal and lobular carcinomas, with no observed correlation between mRNA levels and tumor type or grade. In summary, PLEKHA7 is a junctional marker of epithelial cells within tubular structures both in normal breast tissue and ductal carcinomas, and since PLEKHA7 protein but not mRNA expression is strongly decreased or lost in high grade ductal carcinomas and in lobular carcinomas, loss of PLEKHA7 is a newly characterized feature of these carcinomas."
https://openalex.org/W1856803660,"Since adaptive features such as memory were discovered in mammalian innate immunity, interest in the immunological status of primitive vertebrates after infections has grown. In this context, we used zebrafish (Danio rerio), a primitive vertebrate species suited to molecular and genetic studies to explore transcriptional memories of the immune system in long-term survivors of viral haemorrhagic septicemia virus infections. Immune-gene targeted microarrays designed in-house, multipath genes, gene set enrichment, and leading-edge analysis, reveal unexpected consistent correlations between the viral-survivor phenotype and several innate multigene families. Thus, here we describe in survivors of infections the upregulation of the multigene family of proteasome subunit macropains, zebrafish-specific novel gene sets, mitogen activated protein kinases, and epidermal growth factor. We also describe the downregulation of the multigene families of c-reactive proteins, myxovirus-induced proteins and novel immunoglobulin-type receptors. The strength of those immunological memories was reflected by the exceptional similarity of the transcriptional profiles of survivors before and after re-infection compared with primary infected fish. On the other hand, the high levels of neutralizing antibodies in the blood plasma of survivors contrasted with the depletion of transcripts specific for most cell types present in lymphoid organs. Therefore, long-term survivors maintained unexpected molecular/cellular memories of previous viral encounters by modulating the expression levels of innate multigene families as well as having specific adaptive antibodies. The implications of the so-called ""trained immunity"" for future research in this field are also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1193429260,"In tropical rainforests, termites constitute an important part of the soil fauna biomass, and as for other soil arthropods, variations in soil composition create opportunities for niche partitioning. The aim of this study was twofold: first, we tested whether soil-feeding termite species differ in the foraging substrate; second, we investigated whether soil-feeding termites select their foraging sites to enhance nutrients intake. To do so, we collected termites and analysed the composition and structure of their feeding substrates. Although Anoplotermes-group members are all considered soil-feeders, our results show that some species specifically feed on abandoned termite nests and very rotten wood, and that this substrate selection is correlated with previous stable isotope analyses, suggesting that one component of niche differentiation among species is substrate selection. Our results show that the composition and structure of bare soils on which different termite species foraged do not differ, suggesting that there is no species specialization for a particular type of bare soil. Finally, the bare soil on which termites forage does not differ from random soil samples. Overall, our results suggest that few species of the Anoplotermes-group are specialized toward substrates rich in organic matter, but that the vast majority forage on soil independently of its structural and chemical composition, being ecologically equivalent for this factor."
https://openalex.org/W2274049290,"Gait initiation is the task commonly used to investigate the anticipatory postural adjustments necessary to begin a new gait cycle from the standing position. In this study, we analyzed whether and how foot-floor interface characteristics influence the gait initiation process. For this purpose, 25 undergraduate students were evaluated while performing a gait initiation task in three experimental conditions: barefoot on a hard surface (barefoot condition), barefoot on a soft surface (foam condition), and shod on a hard surface (shod condition). Two force plates were used to acquire ground reaction forces and moments for each foot separately. A statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis was performed in COP time series. We compared the anterior-posterior (AP) and medial-lateral (ML) resultant center of pressure (COP) paths and average velocities, the force peaks under the right and left foot, and the COP integral x force impulse for three different phases: the anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) phase (Phase 1), the swing-foot unloading phase (Phase 2), and the support-foot unloading phase (Phase 3). In Phase 1, significantly smaller ML COP paths and velocities were found for the shod condition compared to the barefoot and foam conditions. Significantly smaller ML COP paths were also found in Phase 2 for the shod condition compared to the barefoot and foam conditions. In Phase 3, increased AP COP velocities were found for the shod condition compared to the barefoot and foam conditions. SPM analysis revealed significant differences for vector COP time series in the shod condition compared to the barefoot and foam conditions. The foam condition limited the impulse-generating capacity of COP shift and produced smaller ML force peaks, resulting in limitations to body-weight transfer from the swing to the support foot. The results suggest that footwear and a soft surface affect COP and impose certain features of gait initiation, especially in the ML direction of Phase 1."
https://openalex.org/W1488260370,"The catalytic reaction of copper amine oxidase proceeds through a ping-pong mechanism comprising two half-reactions. In the initial half-reaction, the substrate amine reduces the Tyr-derived cofactor, topa quinone (TPQ), to an aminoresorcinol form (TPQamr) that is in equilibrium with a semiquinone radical (TPQsq) via an intramolecular electron transfer to the active-site copper. We have analyzed this reductive half-reaction in crystals of the copper amine oxidase from Arthrobacter globiformis. Anerobic soaking of the crystals with an amine substrate shifted the equilibrium toward TPQsq in an conformation, in which the 4-OH group ligated axially to the copper center, which was probably reduced to Cu(I). When the crystals were soaked with substrate in the presence of halide ions, which act as uncompetitive and noncompetitive inhibitors with respect to the amine substrate and dioxygen, respectively, the equilibrium in the crystals shifted toward the off-copper conformation of TPQamr. The halide ion was bound to the axial position of the copper center, thereby preventing TPQamr from adopting the on-copper conformation. Furthermore, transient kinetic analyses in the presence of viscogen (glycerol) revealed that only the rate constant in the step of TPQamr/TPQsq interconversion is markedly affected by the viscogen, which probably perturbs the conformational change. These findings unequivocally demonstrate that TPQ undergoes large conformational changes during the reductive half-reaction."
https://openalex.org/W1812282895,"Pestiviruses express a peculiar protein named Erns representing envelope glycoprotein and RNase, which is important for control of the innate immune response and persistent infection. The latter functions are connected with secretion of a certain amount of Erns from the infected cell. Retention/secretion of Erns is most likely controlled by its unusual membrane anchor, a long amphipathic helix attached in plane to the membrane. Here we present results of experiments conducted with a lipid vesicle sedimentation assay able to separate lipid-bound from unbound protein dissolved in the water phase. Using this technique we show that a protein composed of tag sequences and the carboxyterminal 65 residues of Erns binds specifically to membrane vesicles with a clear preference for compositions containing negatively charged lipids. Mutations disturbing the helical folding and/or amphipathic character of the anchor as well as diverse truncations and exchange of amino acids important for intracellular retention of Erns had no or only small effects on the proteins membrane binding. This result contrasts the dramatically increased secretion rates observed for Erns proteins with equivalent mutations within cells. Accordingly, the ratio of secreted versus cell retained Erns is not determined by the lipid affinity of the membrane anchor."

https://openalex.org/W1772958444,"Earlier observations indicate that free heme is selectively toxic to cells lacking heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) but how this enzyme prevents heme toxicity remains unexplained. Here, using A549 (human lung cancer) and immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells incubated with exogenous heme, we find knock-down of HO-1 using siRNA does promote the accumulation of cell-associated heme and heme-induced cell death. However, it appears that the toxic effects of heme are exerted by “loose” (probably intralysosomal) iron because cytotoxic effects of heme are lessened by pre-incubation of HO-1 deficient cells with desferrioxamine (which localizes preferentially in the lysosomal compartment). Desferrioxamine also decreases lysosomal rupture promoted by intracellularly generated hydrogen peroxide. Supporting the importance of endogenous oxidant production, both chemical and siRNA inhibition of catalase activity predisposes HO-1 deficient cells to heme-mediated killing. Importantly, it appears that HO-1 deficiency somehow blocks the induction of ferritin; control cells exposed to heme show ~10-fold increases in ferritin heavy chain expression whereas in heme-exposed HO-1 deficient cells ferritin expression is unchanged. Finally, overexpression of ferritin H chain in HO-1 deficient cells completely prevents heme-induced cytotoxicity. Although two other products of HO-1 activity–CO and bilirubin–have been invoked to explain HO-1-mediated cytoprotection, we conclude that, at least in this experimental system, HO-1 activity triggers the induction of ferritin and the latter is actually responsible for the cytoprotective effects of HO-1 activity."
https://openalex.org/W1819009908,Concentric magnetic structures (ring and square) with domain wall (DW) pinning geometry are designed for biological manipulation. Magnetic beads collection was firstly demonstrated to analyse the local magnetic field generated by DWs and the effective regions to capture magnetic targets of size 1 μm. Primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are magnetically labeled by internalizing poly (styrene sulfonic acid) stabilized magnetic nanoparticles (PSS-MNPs) and then are selectively trapped by head-to-tail DWs (HH DWs) or tail-to-tail DWs (TT DWs) to be arranged into linear shape or cross shape. The morphologies and the nuclear geometry of the cells growing on two kinds of concentric magnetic structures are shown to be distinctive. The intracellular magnetic forces generated by the local magnetic field of DWs are found to influence the behaviour of cells.
https://openalex.org/W1179659939,"Thymic epithelial cells (TECs) support T cell development in the thymus. Cortical thymic epithelial cells (cTECs) facilitate positive selection of developing thymocytes whereas medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) facilitate the deletion of self-reactive thymocytes in order to prevent autoimmunity. The mTEC compartment is highly dynamic with continuous maturation and turnover, but the genetic regulation of these processes remains poorly understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important regulators of TEC genetic programs since miRNA-deficient TECs are severely defective. However, the individual miRNAs important for TEC maintenance and function and their mechanisms of action remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that miR-205 is highly and preferentially expressed in mTECs during both thymic ontogeny and in the postnatal thymus. This distinct expression is suggestive of functional importance for TEC biology. Genetic ablation of miR-205 in TECs, however, neither revealed a role for miR-205 in TEC function during homeostatic conditions nor during recovery from thymic stress conditions. Thus, despite its distinct expression, miR-205 on its own is largely dispensable for mTEC biology."
https://openalex.org/W2102926248,"It has been suggested that working memory deficits is a core feature of symptomatology of schizophrenia, which can be detected in patients and their unaffected relatives. The impairment of working memory has been found related to the abnormal activity of human brain regions in many functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. This study investigated how brain region activation was altered in schizophrenia and how it was inherited independently from performance deficits.The authors used fMRI method during N-back task to assess working memory related cortical activation in four groups (N = 20 in each group, matching task performance, age, gender and education): schizophrenic patients, their unaffected biological parents, young healthy controls for the patients and older healthy controls for their parents.Compared to healthy controls, patients showed an exaggerated response in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (brodmann area [BA] 46) and bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, and had reduced activation in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA 9). In the conjunction analysis, the effect of genetic risk (parents versus older control) shared significantly overlapped activation with effect of disease (patients versus young control) in the right middle frontal gyrus (BA 46) and left inferior parietal gyrus (BA 40).Physiological inefficiency of dorsal prefrontal cortex and compensation involvement of ventral prefrontal cortex in working memory function may one physiological characteristics of schizophrenia. And relatively inefficient activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex probably can be a promising intermediate phenotype for schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W1810471038,"Parasitoid host selection behaviour has been extensively studied in experimentally simplified tritrophic systems formed by one single food chain (one plant, one herbivore and one parasitoid species). The ""Mother knows best"" hypothesis predicts that the preference for a plant-host complex should be positively correlated with plant quality for offspring performance. We studied the host selection behaviour of the generalist endoparasitoid Aphidius matricariae towards the black bean aphid Aphis fabae in the intercrop system including Vicia faba as a focal plant and its companion plant Camelina sativa. Dual-choice laboratory bioassays revealed that parasitoid females preferred to orientate towards (1) the plant-aphid complex over the non-infested plant whatever the complex (2) the C. sativa-A. fabae complex over the V. faba-A. fabae complex. In dual choice attack rate bioassays, parasitoid females showed more interest towards the aphids on C. sativa but paradoxically chose to oviposit more in aphids on V. faba. Ultimately, parasitoids that had developed on the V. faba-A. fabae complex exhibited better fitness parameters. By demonstrating that parasitoid females were able to discriminate the aphid host that offered the highest fitness to their offspring but selected beforehand the least suitable plant-aphid complex, we provide key insight into the disruption in their host selection behaviour potentially triggered by diverse habitats. This suggests that the ""Mother knows best"" hypothesis could be thwarted by increasing the complexity of the studied systems."
https://openalex.org/W1203142557,"Plant WRKY transcription factors are known to regulate various biotic and abiotic stress responses. In this study we identified a total of 30 putative WRKY unigenes in a transcriptome dataset of the Chinese wild Hazel, Corylus heterophylla, a species that is noted for its cold tolerance. Thirteen full-length of these ChWRKY genes were cloned and found to encode complete protein sequences, and they were divided into three groups, based on the number of WRKY domains and the pattern of zinc finger structures. Representatives of each of the groups, Unigene25835 (group I), Unigene37641 (group II) and Unigene20441 (group III), were transiently expressed as fusion proteins with yellow fluorescent fusion protein in Nicotiana benthamiana, where they were observed to accumulate in the nucleus, in accordance with their predicted roles as transcriptional activators. An analysis of the expression patterns of all 30 WRKY genes revealed differences in transcript abundance profiles following exposure to cold, drought and high salinity conditions. Among the stress-inducible genes, 23 were up-regulated by all three abiotic stresses and the WRKY genes collectively exhibited four different patterns of expression in flower buds during the overwintering period from November to April. The organ/tissue related expression analysis showed that 18 WRKY genes were highly expressed in stem but only 2 (Unigene9262 and Unigene43101) were greatest in male anthotaxies. The expression of Unigene37641, a member of the group II WRKY genes, was substantially up-regulated by cold, drought and salinity treatments, and its overexpression in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in better seedling growth, compared with wild type plants, under cold treatment conditions. The transgenic lines also had exhibited higher soluble protein content, superoxide dismutase and peroxidase activiety and lower levels of malondialdehyde, which collectively suggets that Unigene37641 expression promotes cold tolerance."
https://openalex.org/W1795417285,"We developed a lateral flow strip using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) which allows for rapid antigen detection and serotyping of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV). This FMDV serotyping strip was able to detect all 7 serotypes and distinguish serotypes O, A, C and Asia1. Its sensitivities ranged from 10(3) to 10(4) of a 50% tissue culture infectious dose of each FMDV stain; this is equal to those of the commercial product Svanodip (Boehringer Ingelheim Svanova, Uppsala, Sweden), which can detect all seven serotypes of FMDV, but does not distinguish them. Our evaluation of the FMDV serotyping strip using a total of 118 clinical samples (vesicular fluids, vesicular epithelial emulsions and oral and/or nasal swabs) showed highly sensitive antigen detection and accuracy in serotyping in accordance with ELISA or RT-PCR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on any FMDV serotyping strip that provides both rapid antigen detection and serotyping of FMDV at the same time on one strip without extra devices. This method will be useful in both FMD-free countries and FMD-infected countries, especially where laboratory diagnosis cannot be carried out."

In rodent models, the microenvironment of mammary gland involution is sufficient to induce enhanced tumor cell growth, local invasion, and metastasis. Therefore, a deeper understanding of the physiological regulation of involution may provide in-depth information on breast cancer therapy. We herein identified Nucling as an important regulator of involution of the mammary gland. A knock-out mouse model was generated and revealed that postpartum involution were impaired in mice lacking Nucling. Involution is normally associated with an increase in the activation of NF-κB and STAT3, which is required for the organized regulation of involution, and was observed in WT glands, but not in the absence of Nucling. Furthermore, the loss of Nucling led to the suppression of Calpain-1, IL-6, and C/EBPδ factors, which are known to be essential for normal involution. The number of M2 macrophages, which are crucial for epithelial cell death and adipocyte repopulation after weaning, was also reduced in Nucling-KO glands. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that Nucling played an important role in mammary gland involution by regulating NF-κB and STAT3 signaling pathways.

We retrospectively identified and evaluated the post-operative complications as per the modified Clavien classification system in 152 living liver donors at at the First Affiliated Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University between December, 2006 and June, 2014. Post-operative complications were observed in 61 patients (40.1%) in the present study, but no mortality was reported. Complications developed in 58 (40.0%) right, 1 (33.3%) left, and 2 (66.7%) lateral left hepatectomy donors. The prevalence of re-operation was 1.3%. Grade I and II complications were observed in 38 (25.0%) and 11 (7.2%) donors, respectively. Grade IIIa complications developed in 9 (5.9%) donors and only 3 (2.0%) patients reported grade IIIb complications. The most common complication was pleural effusion that occurred in 31 (20.4%) donors. No significant prognostic baseline factor was identified in this study. In conclusion, living donors experienced various complications, which were usually mild and had a good prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W1156844425,A 4.1 μs molecular dynamics simulation of the NR4A1 (hNur77) apo-protein has been undertaken and a previously undetected druggable pocket has become apparent that is located remotely from the 'traditional' nuclear receptor ligand-binding site. A NR4A1/bis-indole ligand complex at this novel site has been found to be stable over 1 μs of simulation and to result in an interesting conformational transmission to a remote loop that has the capacity to communicate with a NBRE within a RXR-α/NR4A1 heterodimer. Several features of the simulations undertaken indicate how NR4A1 can be affected by alternate-site modulators.
https://openalex.org/W1781882130,"Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare hereditary stroke caused by mutations in NOTCH3 gene. We report the first case of CADASIL in an indigenous Rungus (Kadazan-Dusun) family in Kudat, Sabah, Malaysia confirmed by a R54C (c.160C>T, p.Arg54Cys) mutation in the NOTCH3. This mutation was previously reported in a Caucasian and two Korean cases of CADASIL. We recruited two generations of the affected Rungus family (n = 9) and found a missense mutation (c.160C>T) in exon 2 of NOTCH3 in three siblings. Two of the three siblings had severe white matter abnormalities in their brain MRI (Scheltens score 33 and 50 respectively), one of whom had a young stroke at the age of 38. The remaining sibling, however, did not show any clinical features of CADASIL and had only minimal changes in her brain MRI (Scheltens score 17). This further emphasized the phenotype variability among family members with the same mutation in CADASIL. This is the first reported family with CADASIL in Rungus subtribe of Kadazan-Dusun ethnicity with a known mutation at exon 2 of NOTCH3. The penetrance of this mutation was not complete during the course of this study."
https://openalex.org/W1938575839,"Our recent prospective study found equivalent accuracy of magnifying chromoendoscopy (MC) and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) for diagnosing the invasion depth of colorectal cancer (CRC); however, whether these tools show diagnostic differences in categories such as tumor size and morphology remains unclear. Hence, we conducted detailed subset analysis of the prospective data.In this multicenter, prospective, comparative trial, a total of 70 patients with early, flat CRC were enrolled from February 2011 to December 2012, and the results of 66 lesions were finally analyzed. Patients were randomly allocated to primary MC followed by EUS or to primary EUS followed by MC. Diagnoses of invasion depth by each tool were divided into intramucosal to slight submucosal invasion (invasion depth <1000 μm) and deep submucosal invasion (invasion depth ≥1000 μm), and then compared with the final pathological diagnosis by an independent pathologist blinded to clinical data. To standardize diagnoses among examiners, this trial was started after achievement of a mean κ value of ≥0.6 which was calculated from the average of κ values between each pair of participating endoscopists.Both MC and EUS showed similar diagnostic outcomes, with no significant differences in prediction of invasion depth in subset analyses according to tumor size, location, and morphology. Lesions that were consistently diagnosed as Tis/T1-SMS or ≥T1-SMD with both tools revealed accuracy of 76-78%. Accuracy was low in borderline lesions with irregular pit pattern in MC and distorted findings of the third layer in EUS (MC, 58.5%; EUS, 50.0%).MC and EUS showed the same limited accuracy for predicting invasion depth in all categories of early CRC. Since the irregular pit pattern in MC, distorted findings to the third layer in EUS and inconsistent diagnosis between both tools were associated with low accuracy, further refinements or even novel methods are still needed for such lesions.University hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry UMIN 000005085."
https://openalex.org/W1750701438,"Statistical mechanics provides the link between microscopic properties of many-particle systems and macroscopic properties such as pressure and temperature. Observations of similar “microscopic” quantities exist for the motion of zooplankton, as well as many species of other social animals. Herein, we propose to take average squared velocities as the definition of the “ecological temperature” of a population under different conditions on nutrients, light, oxygen and others. We test the usefulness of this definition on observations of the crustacean zooplankton Daphnia pulicaria. In one set of experiments, D. pulicaria is infested with the pathogen Vibrio cholerae, the causative agent of cholera. We find that infested D. pulicaria under light exposure have a significantly greater ecological temperature, which puts them at a greater risk of detection by visual predators. In a second set of experiments, we observe D. pulicaria in cold and warm water, and in darkness and under light exposure. Overall, our ecological temperature is a good discriminator of the crustacean’s swimming behavior."

Here we study graft function (eGFR) trajectories using linear mixed models, which provide effect estimates on both slope and baseline level of GFR and offer increased statistical power.Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of CSA treated kidney transplant recipients with stable graft function assigned to receive 0.1 mg/kg/day TAC (target 5-8 ng/ml) or to continue CSA based immunosuppression (target 70-150 ng/ml) at a 2:1 ratio. Renal graft function was estimated via the MDRD (eGFRMDRD) and CKD-EPI (eGFRCKD-EPI) formulas.Forty-five patients continued CSA and 96 patients were converted to TAC with a median follow up of 24 months. Baseline demographics (except for recipient age) including native kidney disease, transplant characteristics, kidney graft function, medication use and comorbid conditions did not differ between groups. In respect to long-term renal graft function, linear mixed models showed significantly improved eGFR trajectories (eGFRMDRD: p<0.001, eGFRCKD-EPI: p<0.001) in the TAC versus CSA group over 24 months of follow up. Estimated eGFRCKD-EPI group differences between TAC and CSA were -3.49 (p = 0.019) at 3 months, -5.50 (p<0.001) at 12 months, and -4.48 ml/min/1.73m2 (p = 0.003) at 24 months of follow up. Baseline eGFR was a significant predictor of eGFR trajectories (eGFRMDRD: p<0.001, eGFRCKD-EPI: p<0.001). Significant effects for randomization group were evident despite short-term trough levels in the supratherapeutic range (27% (n = 26) of TAC patients at week one). Median TAC trough levels were within target range at week 4 after conversion.Conversion of CSA treated kidney transplant recipients with stable graft function to TAC (target 5-8 ng/ml) showed significantly improved long-term eGFR trajectories when compared to CSA maintenance (target 70-150 ng/ml).ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00182559 EudraCT identifier: 2004-004209-98."
https://openalex.org/W2119112724,"Background Sustained or consistent use of condoms by men remains a challenge. A study was carried out to identify factors associated with failure to use condoms consistently by men attending STD clinics in Pune, India. Method Among 14137 STI clinic attendees, 8360 HIV sero-negative men were enrolled in a cohort study. The changes in condom usage behavior were studied among 1284 men who returned for first scheduled quarterly follow up, 309 reported consistent condom use at the time of enrollment in the cohort. Data pertaining to heterosexual men practicing high risk behavior were analyzed to identify factors associated with change in condom use behavior using logistic regression model. Demographic, behavioral and biological factors observed to be associated with condom use were fitted in five Cox proportional hazards models to calculate hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals to identify independent predictors of failure to sustain condom use behavior. Results The univariate analysis showed that men who were 30 years or older in age (p = 0.002) and those who did not have contact female sex worker (FSW) were more likely to fail to sustain consistent condom use. However both these factors did not show significant association in multivariable analysis. Marital status and contact with Hijra (eunuch) in lifetime were associated with failure to change in their condom use behavior [AOR 0.33 (CI 0.13–0.82; p = 0.017)]. During the follow up of 2 years, 61 events (15.5 per 100 person years, 95% CI 12.3–19.5 years) of ‘failure of condom use’ were recorded despite counseling. Older age, contact with non CSW partner and presence of genital ulcer disease / discharge syndrome were significant predictors of failure to sustain condom use. Discussion Married monogamous older men, who report contact with sex worker and present with genital ulcer disease are at risk of failure to use condom after first exposure to voluntary HIV counseling and testing. This is a scenario of primary prevention program. Condom promotion and counseling needs to be reinforced through follow up counseling among this population."
