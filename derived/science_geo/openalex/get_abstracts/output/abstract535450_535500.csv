Upon stimulation, neutrophils release their chromosomal DNA to trap and kill microorganisms and inhibit their dissemination. These chromatin traps are termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and are decorated with granular and cytoplasm proteins. NET release can be induced by several microorganism membrane components, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate as well as by amyloid fibrils, insoluble proteinaceous molecules associated with more than 40 different pathologies among other stimuli. The intracellular signaling involved in NET formation is complex and remains unclear for most tested stimuli. Herein we demonstrate that a metabolic shift toward the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is necessary for NET release because glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), an important enzyme from PPP, fuels NADPH oxidase with NADPH to produce superoxide and thus induce NETs. In addition, we observed that mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, which are NADPH-independent, are not effective in producing NETs. These data shed new light on how the PPP and glucose metabolism contributes to NET formation. Neutrophils are the main defense cells of the innate immune system.

Neutrophils are highly specialized cells of the innate immune system that are the first to reach a site of infection (1Nathan C. Neutrophils and immunity: challenges and opportunities.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). Neutrophils possess a myriad of microbicide mechanisms to deal with infection (1Nathan C. Neutrophils and immunity: challenges and opportunities.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 173-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (2075) Google Scholar). Among them, neutrophils can release granules containing proteases and microbicide peptides, and produce extracellular and intracellular reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS). 5The abbreviations used are: ROSreactive oxygen speciesRNSreactive nitrogen speciesG6Pglucose 6-phosphateG6PDglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase6-AN6-aminonicotinamideAFamyloid fibrilsPMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePPPpentose phosphate pathwayNETneutrophil extracellular trapMPOmyeloperoxidaseNoxNADPH oxidaseLDHlactate dehydrogenaseRotrotenoneAAantimycin A2-DG2-deoxyglucoseHBSSHanks' balanced salt solutionDPIdiphenyleneiodoniumDHRdihydrorhodamine-123PKCiPKC inhibitorAktiAkt IV inhibitorNCSno carbon sourceANOVAanalysis of varianceMFImean fluorescence intensityCTRLcontrol.

Today, there is a vast range of data suggesting that not only bacteria, but viruses, fungi, protozoa, and non-microbial molecules are able to induce NET release from human neutrophils (2Guimarães-Costa A.

Our data showed that, once tangled within the NETs, AF are digested by NET-associated elastase forming small oligomeric species that are toxic to cells in culture. This suggests that AF may be a reservoir of toxic species in amyloidogenic diseases, and the NET-associated proteases might trigger their formation. We also observed the presence of NET co-localizing with AF in postmortem tissues of amyloidotic patients, suggesting that AF-induced NET formation can take place in vivo (5Azevedo E.P.

Although the factors that regulate NET formation remain unclear for most NET-inducing agents, many groups have described the participation of myeloperoxidase (MPO (7Papayannopoulos V. Metzler K.D.

The production of ROS, which is necessary for NET formation, arises mainly from the cytosolic NADPH oxidase (Nox) (11Cooper P.R. Palmer L.J. Chapple I.L.

Nox can be directly activated by several protein kinases such as PKC through phosphorylation of the gp91phox component (13Raad H. Paclet M.H. Boussetta T. Kroviarski Y. Morel F. Quinn M.T. Gougerot-Pocidalo M.A. Dang P.M. El-Benna J.

How the ROS signal induces NET formation is still unknown. Nox produces superoxide from oxygen using reduced NADPH as a cofactor (14Lambeth J.D. Neish A.S. Nox enzymes and new thinking on reactive oxygen: a double-edged sword revisited.Annu. Rev. Pathol. 2014; 9: 119-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). NADPH is mainly produced from NADP+-dependent dehydrogenases, such as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), an important enzyme responsible for the first reaction of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) (15Stanton R.C. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, NADPH, and cell survival.IUBMB Life. 2012; 64: 362-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). The importance of the PPP for neutrophil function is clearly observed in patients with G6PD deficiency or impairment, in which the development of infections is common due to dysfunctional neutrophil microbicide mechanisms (16Perner A. Nielsen S.E. Rask-Madsen J. High glucose impairs superoxide production from isolated blood neutrophils.Intensive Care Med. 2003; 29: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Gray G.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Naiman S.C. Kliman M.R. Klebanoff S.J. Austin T. Yoshida A. Robinson G.C. Neutrophil dysfunction, chronic granulomatous disease, and non-spherocytic haemolytic anaemia caused by complete deficiency of G6PD.Lancet. 1973; 2: 530-53410.1016/S0140-6736(73)92350-7Abstract PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The poor neutrophil function caused by this impairment is directly associated with less NADPH and with less ROS production (16Perner A. Nielsen S.E. Rask-Madsen J. High glucose impairs superoxide production from isolated blood neutrophils.Intensive Care Med. 2003; 29: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Some mutations in G6PD can severely affect the G6PD activity, causing the neutrophils and monocytes to be unresponsive to phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and thus producing less ROS than wild-type cells (18Tsai K.J. Hung I.J. Chow C.K. Stern A. Chao S.S. Chiu D.T. Impaired production of nitric oxide, superoxide, and hydrogen peroxide in glucose 6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficient granulocytes.FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although there are data showing that G6PD activity is important for ROS production (16Perner A. Nielsen S.E. Rask-Madsen J. High glucose impairs superoxide production from isolated blood neutrophils.Intensive Care Med. 2003; 29: 642-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 17Gray G.R. Stamatoyannopoulos G.

Herein we investigate whether human neutrophils stimulated by either AF or PMA depend on the PPP to generate the majority of the cellular ROS and induce NET formation. We demonstrate that mitochondrial ROS elicited by PMA or antimycin A/rotenone treatment are not effective in producing NETs from human neutrophils. To highlight the importance of PPP in NET formation, we demonstrate that G6PD activity increases after PMA or AF stimulation and when G6PD activity is blocked by the NADPH competitive inhibitor 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN), NET formation is abrogated, reinforcing the role of PPP and glucose to neutrophil function in innate response. The procedures using human biological samples were performed in accordance with institution regulations and approved by the Institutional Review Board for Human Subjects (CAAE#03102012.4.1001.5257; Hospital Universitário Clementino Fraga Filho, Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil). Briefly, human neutrophils were isolated from buffy coats of healthy blood donors using a density gradient centrifugation (Histopaque, Sigma) as described (19Guimarães-Costa A.B. Nascimento M.T. Froment G.S. Soares R.P. Morgado F.N. Conceição-Silva F. Saraiva E.M. Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes induce and are killed by neutrophil extracellular traps.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6748-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). NET-DNA was quantified in the supernatant of 1 × 106 human neutrophils using PicoGreen reagent (Invitrogen) as described (19Guimarães-Costa A.B. Nascimento M.T. Froment G.S. Soares R.P. Morgado F.N. Conceição-Silva F. Saraiva E.M. Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes induce and are killed by neutrophil extracellular traps.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2009; 106: 6748-6753Crossref PubMed Scopus (406) Google Scholar). 2-Deoxyglucose (2-DG) at 2 mm was incubated with neutrophils for 3 h in RPMI 1640, and NET release was measured accordingly. A25T, a highly amyloidogenic variant of transthyretin, was expressed heterologously and purified, and amyloid fibrils were grown as described (20Azevedo E.P. Pereira H.M. Garratt R.C. Kelly J.W. Foguel D. Palhano F.L.

To ensure that no endotoxin was present, all recombinant proteins were further purified using a polymyxin-B-conjugated resin (Thermo Scientific). Amyloid fibrils were diluted to 2 μm and incubated with 40 μm thioflavin-T (Sigma) for 5 min. Thioflavin-T fluorescence was read in a spectrofluorometer at 440 nm excitation and 480 nm emission and plotted using the GraphPad Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad Software). Amyloid was also characterized using transmission electron microscopy as described (5Azevedo E.P. Guimarães-Costa A.B. Torezani G.S. Braga C.A. Palhano F.L. Kelly J.W. Saraiva E.M. Foguel D. Amyloid fibrils trigger the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), causing fibril fragmentation by NET-associated elastase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 37206-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Human neutrophils were treated accordingly and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed, and unspecific sites were blocked with 5% BSA for 1 h. Afterward, cells were incubated with primary antibodies such as anti-human MPO (1:150; Calbiochem) and anti-human elastase (1:150; Calbiochem) for 24 h at 4 °C. Cells were washed and incubated with secondary antibody donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, Invitrogen) and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (1:500; Invitrogen) and mounted using Prolong antifade reagent (Invitrogen). Images were obtained using a confocal microscope Leica TCS SPE (Leica, Germany) and processed using the LAS AF Lite and Adobe Photoshop 7.0 software. Freshly isolated human neutrophils were incubated in RPMI 1640 without phenol red with Akt IV inhibitor (Akti; Calbiochem) at 10 μm, 6-AN at 10 mm, rotenone (Rot) at 2 μg/ml, diphenyleneiodonium (DPI) at 10 μg/ml, and antimycin A (AA) at 1 μm for 30 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. All inhibitors were purchased from Sigma, unless stated otherwise. For experiments testing different fuel sources, we incubated neutrophils in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS) (0.137 m NaCl, 5.4 mm KCl, 0.25 mm Na2HPO4, 0.44 mm KH2PO4, 1.3 mm CaCl2, 1.0 mm MgSO4, and 4.2 mm NaHCO3, pH 7.3, and filtered using 0.22-μm -filters). HBSS was supplemented with d-glucose (5.5 mm) or d-fructose (5.6 mm) or used without supplementation (no carbon source (NCS)). Afterward, dihydrorhodamine-123 (DHR, 1.2 μm, Sigma), annexin V, and MitoSOX were added, and then neutrophils were stimulated with PMA at 100 nm or A25T-AF at 3 μm for 15 min at 37 °C, 5% CO2. The fluorescence intensity of individual cells was analyzed by flow cytometry with a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Graphs were plotted as mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) or the percentage of cells that were DHR+ (percentage of DHR-positive neutrophils) and MitoSOX-positive neutrophils. G6PD activity was measured according to Ref. 21Worthington K. Worthington V. Worthington Manual: Enzymes and Related Biochemicals. 1st Ed. Worthington Biochemical Corporation, Freehold, NJ1988: 159-161Google Scholar. 2 × 107 neutrophils were lysed at −80 °C and vortexed, and cell debris was separated by centrifugation. Protein content was measured using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Briefly, 0.055 m Tris-HCl, 0.0033 m MgCl2, pH 7.8, 0.006 m NADP+, 0.1 m glucose 6-phosphate were added to each well in a clear bottom 96-well plate and incubated at 30 °C for 10 min to equilibrate and to establish a blank rate. Then, 3.3 μl of neutrophil lysates were added to wells, and optical density at 340 nm was monitored using a plate reader for 30 min at a 1-min rate. As controls, a well containing no lysate and a well containing purified recombinant G6PD (Sigma) were also monitored during experimentation. Enzyme activity was measured according to the following equation: units/mg = (ΔA340 nm/min)/6.22 × mg of protein/ml of reaction volume. Intracellular ATP was measured in neutrophil lysates using the Mitochondrial ToxGlo kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Intracellular pyruvate production was assessed using a commercial pyruvate measuring kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Abcam). Human neutrophils were incubated for 5 h in HBSS alone or supplemented with 5.5 mm glucose or 5.6 mm fructose, in RPMI 1640 with 10 mm 6-AN or with 1% Triton X-100 as a positive control, and 50 μl of neutrophil supernatant were removed and added to opaque bottom wells and tested for LDH activity using the commercial kit CytoTox-One homogeneous membrane integrity assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Statistical analyses (one-way ANOVA and Student's t test) were performed using the software GraphPad Prism 5.0, as described in the legend for each experiment. As a NET inducer, initially we chose AF composed of A25T, a highly amyloidogenic variant of transthyretin that forms amyloid fibrils as observed by transmission electron microscopy (Fig. 1A, inset) and thioflavin-T binding (not shown (5Azevedo E.P. Guimarães-Costa A.B. Torezani G.S. Braga C.A. Palhano F.L. Kelly J.W. Saraiva E.M. Foguel D.

Chem. 2012; 287: 37206-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar)). As seen in Fig. 1A, the extent of DNA release as a measure of NET formation was dependent on the concentration of AF, beginning to level off at ∼3–6 μm AF. We also noticed that DNA release was time-dependent (5Azevedo E.P. Guimarães-Costa A.B. Torezani G.S. Braga C.A. Palhano F.L. Kelly J.W. Saraiva E.M. Foguel D.

Chem. 2012; 287: 37206-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), reaching a maximum after 3 h of incubation in the presence of 3 μm AF, a time window in which the neutrophils remain viable in solution. We emphasize that the NET formation observed herein is donor-dependent for both AF-induced NET (5Azevedo E.P. Guimarães-Costa A.B. Torezani G.S. Braga C.A. Palhano F.L. Kelly J.W. Saraiva E.M. Foguel D. Amyloid fibrils trigger the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), causing fibril fragmentation by NET-associated elastase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 37206-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and PMA-induced NET as seen in Fig. 1B, where 100 nm PMA was used as a NET inducer for 1.5 h. Although for some neutrophils the addition of PMA led to a very modest increase in DNA release (Fig. 1B, donors 5–9), in samples from other donors, there was a 5–6-fold increment (Fig. 1B, donors 1–4). It is unclear why neutrophils from some donors are more effective in producing NET. Based on these data, in the next experiments, we used 3 μm AF composed of A25T or 100 nm PMA during 1.5 h for NET induction, unless otherwise stated. Neutrophils rely mainly on glycolysis to obtain the energy necessary for metabolic reactions and survival (22van Raam B.J. Sluiter W. de Wit E. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. Kuijpers T.W. Mitochondrial membrane potential in human neutrophils is maintained by complex III activity in the absence of supercomplex organisation.PLoS One. 2008; 3e2013 Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 23Maianski N.A.

Invest. 2013; 93: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). Therefore, we asked whether NET could be induced effectively when neutrophils were deprived of glucose. For this purpose, we incubated isolated human neutrophils in HBSS, a saline solution that contains Ca2+ and Mg2+, but no glucose or other source of carbohydrate, lipid, or protein (NCS). We compared the amount of NET released by these neutrophils with that released by neutrophils that were from the same donors but maintained in HBSS containing 5.5 mm d-glucose, a concentration similar to the RPMI 1640 medium used in previous experiments (5Azevedo E.P. Guimarães-Costa A.B. Torezani G.S. Braga C.A. Palhano F.L. Kelly J.W. Saraiva E.M. Foguel D. Amyloid fibrils trigger the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), causing fibril fragmentation by NET-associated elastase.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 37206-37218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Initially, both neutrophil populations were challenged with AF and DNA release was evaluated for a maximum of 5 h (Fig. 1C). After 1.5 h in the presence of AF, neutrophils incubated in the absence (G−, white squares) or in the presence of glucose (G+, black squares) showed similar amounts of DNA release, but after 3 or 5 h of induction, the neutrophils incubated in the presence of glucose continued releasing DNA, whereas the starved neutrophils did not present this enhancement (Fig. 1C). Viability assays (LDH) performed with untreated neutrophils (CTRL) incubated for 5 h in solutions containing no glucose or fructose (G−F−), only fructose (G−F+), or only glucose (G+F−) showed equal viability, suggesting that starvation or the absence of glucose do not compromise neutrophil viability (Fig. 1C, inset). Also, we tested whether an inhibitor of glycolysis, 2-DG, was able to inhibit NET release when the cells were incubated in the presence of glucose. As seen in Fig. 1D, AF- and PMA-treated neutrophils that were pretreated with 2-DG were not able to produce NETs, but were still viable (Fig. 1D and inset). Taken together these data suggest that NET formation might be a glycolysis-dependent process. When glucose enters the cell, it is readily phosphorylated by hexokinase, generating glucose 6-phosphate (G6P), which can flow through two different pathways: the glycolytic pathway, generating fructose 6-phosphate that is metabolized to lactate, producing ATP (Fig. 2A), or the PPP-forming ribulose-5-phosphate with the concomitant formation of NADPH (Fig. 2A, routes 1 and 2, respectively). It is important to recall that NADPH is important for Nox activity and ROS production (2Guimarães-Costa A. B Nascimento M.T. Wardini A.B. Pinto-da-Silva L.H. Saraiva E.M. ETosis: a microbicidal mechanism beyond cell death.J. Parasitol. Res. 2012; 2012929743 Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), an element necessary in NET formation. In addition to the aforementioned fates of glucose, this sugar can also be used in glycogen synthesis and protein glycosylation (25Plesner L. Plesner I.W. Esmann V.

Differences in protein and glycoprotein patterns between mature and immature neutrophil leukocytes.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 317: 394-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar), but these fates of glucose were not addressed in the present study. To assess the relative importance of glycolytic pathway and PPP for NET production, we performed a NET release experiment in which human neutrophils were stimulated with AF or PMA for 3 h in HBSS containing NCS, 5.5 mm glucose, or 5.6 mm fructose (Fig. 2B). Although it is not known whether neutrophils possess fructose transporters, we observed that fructose was able to enter neutrophils and generate ATP and pyruvate (Fig. 2, L and M, respectively) in levels comparable with those obtained in the presence of glucose. Also, previous data have shown that the uptake of [14C]fructose by neutrophils induces 14CO2 production, an indication that fructose is, to some extent, metabolized by neutrophils (27Litchfield W.J. Wells W.W. Selectivity of the 2-deoxyglucose transport system in human and guinea pig polymorphonuclear leukocytes.Infect. Immun. 1977; 16: 189-197Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Inside the cell, fructose is phosphorylated by hexokinase to form fructose 6-phosphate, which follows the glycolytic pathway and is metabolized into lactate and ATP (Fig. 2A) (28Martin S.P. McKinney G. R Green R. The metabolism of human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.Ann. N.Y. Acad. Sci. 1955; 59: 996-1002Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, because fructose 6-phosphate is downstream from the entry into PPP, when cells are incubated in its presence, we expect this pathway to be shut down, decreasing the levels of NADPH, an important element for Nox activity and NET formation. As seen in Fig. 2B, significant DNA release was observed only when neutrophils were incubated in the presence of glucose and challenged by AF and PMA. Cells incubated in fructose or in HBSS containing NCS released NET similarly to unchallenged neutrophils (Fig. 2B). To confirm this observation, NET formation was evaluated through the use of a DNA marker (Hoechst; blue) and antibodies against neutrophil elastase (green) and MPO (red), two enzymes that decorate the NETs (Fig. 2, C–K). Neutrophils that do not form NETs remained circular and contained lobulated nuclei, and enzyme immunoreactivity was contained to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2, C–H). Again, only the neutrophils incubated with glucose and challenged with AF or PMA underwent NET formation (Fig. 2, J and K), whereas the cells incubated with NCS (Fig. 2, D and E) or fructose (Fig. 2, G and H) did not. Note that neutrophils treated with fructose or glucose produced similar amounts of ATP (Fig. 2L), but did not release NETs (Fig."

Here we report data from 243 healthy adults aged 40–97, for whom we measured clinical and functional parameters, serum cytokines, cytokines and gene expression in stimulated and unstimulated PBMC, PBMC phenotypes, and cytokine-stimulated pSTAT signaling in whole blood. Although highly heterogeneous across individuals, many of these assays revealed trends by age, sex, and CMV status, to greater or lesser degrees. Age, then sex and CMV status, showed the greatest impact on the immune system, as measured by the percentage of assay readouts with significant differences. An elastic net regression model could optimally predict age with 14 analytes from different assays. This reinforces the importance of multivariate analysis for defining a healthy immune system. These data provide a reference for others measuring immune parameters in older people."

This study quantified the metabolic adaptation capacity by studying challenge response curves. After a high-fat challenge, the 8 h response curves of 61 biomarkers related to adipose tissue mass and function, systemic stress, metabolic flexibility, vascular health, and glucose metabolism was compared between 3 metabolic health stages: 10 healthy men, before and after 4 wk of high-fat, high-calorie diet (1300 kcal/d extra), and 9 men with metabolic syndrome (MetS). The MetS subjects had increased fasting concentrations of biomarkers representing the 3 core processes, glucose, TG, and inflammation control, and the challenge response curves of most biomarkers were altered. After the 4 wk hypercaloric dietary intervention, these 3 processes were not changed, as compared with the preintervention state in the healthy subjects, whereas the challenge response curves of almost all endocrine, metabolic, and inflammatory processes regulating these core processes were altered, demonstrating major molecular physiologic efforts to maintain homeostasis. This study thus demonstrates that change in challenge response is a more sensitive biomarker of metabolic resilience than are changes in fasting concentrations."

This modification is catalyzed by a family of transmembrane S-acyltransferases that contain a conserved zinc finger DHHC (zDHHC) domain. Typically, eukaryote genomes encode for 7–24 distinct zDHHC enzymes, with two members also harboring an ankyrin repeat (AR) domain at their cytosolic N termini. The AR domain of zDHHC enzymes is predicted to engage in numerous interactions and facilitates both substrate recruitment and S-acylation-independent functions; however, the sequence/structural features recognized by this module remain unknown. The two mammalian AR-containing S-acyltransferases are the Golgi-localized zDHHC17 and zDHHC13, also known as Huntingtin-interacting proteins 14 and 14-like, respectively; they are highly expressed in brain, and their loss in mice leads to neuropathological deficits that are reminiscent of Huntington's disease.

https://openalex.org/W1490506267,"Peripheral neuropathy is a major dose-limiting side effect of paclitaxel and cisplatin chemotherapy. In the current study, we tested the involvement of a novel class of neurotoxic sphingolipids, the 1-deoxysphingolipids. 1-Deoxysphingolipids are produced when the enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase uses l-alanine instead of l-serine as its amino acid substrate. We tested whether treatment of cells with paclitaxel (250 nM, 1 µM) and cisplatin (250 nM, 1 µM) would result in elevated cellular levels of 1-deoxysphingolipids. Our results revealed that paclitaxel, but not cisplatin treatment, caused a dose-dependent elevation of 1-deoxysphingolipids levels and an increase in the message and activity of serine palmitoyltransferase (P < 0.05). We also tested whether there is an association between peripheral neuropathy symptoms [evaluated by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy-20 (CIPN20) instrument] and the 1-deoxysphingolipid plasma levels (measured by mass spectrometry) in 27 patients with breast cancer who were treated with paclitaxel chemotherapy. Our results showed that there was an association between the incidence and severity of neuropathy and the levels of very-long-chain 1-deoxyceramides such as C24 (P < 0.05), with the strongest association being with motor neuropathy (P < 0.001). Our data from cells and from patients with breast cancer suggest that 1-deoxysphingolipids, the very-long-chain in particular, play a role as molecular intermediates of paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy."
https://openalex.org/W2210685164,"The ability of the Blood Brain Barrier (BBB) to maintain proper barrier functions, keeping an optimal environment for central nervous system (CNS) activity and regulating leukocytes' access, can be affected in CNS diseases. Endothelial cells and astrocytes are the principal BBB cellular constituents and their interaction is essential to maintain its function. Both endothelial cells and astrocytes express the receptors for the bioactive sphingolipid S1P. Fingolimod, an immune modulatory drug whose structure is similar to S1P, has been approved for treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS): fingolimod reduces the rate of MS relapses by preventing leukocyte egress from the lymph nodes. Here, we examined the ability of S1P and fingolimod to act on the BBB, using an in vitro co-culture model that allowed us to investigate the effects of S1P on endothelial cells, astrocytes, and interactions between the two. Acting selectively on endothelial cells, S1P receptor signaling reduced cell death induced by inflammatory cytokines. When acting on astrocytes, fingolimod treatment induced the release of a factor, granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that reduced the effects of cytokines on endothelium. In an in vitro BBB model incorporating shear stress, S1P receptor modulation reduced leukocyte migration across the endothelial barrier, indicating a novel mechanism that might contribute to fingolimod efficacy in MS treatment."

In order to understand the complex interrelationships among different countries and economic sectors, as well as their dynamics, a holistic view on the underlying structural properties of this network is necessary. This study employs multi-regional input-output data to decompose 186 national economies into 26 industry sectors and utilizes the approach of interdependent networks to analyze the substructure of the resulting international trade network for the years 1990–2011. The partition of the network into national economies is observed to be compatible with the notion of communities in the sense of complex network theory. By studying internal versus cross-subgraph contributions to established complex network metrics, new insights into the architecture of global trade are obtained, which allow to identify key elements of global economy. Specifically, financial services and business activities dominate domestic trade whereas electrical and machinery industries dominate foreign trade. In order to further specify each national sector’s role individually, (cross-)clustering coefficients and cross-betweenness are obtained for different pairs of subgraphs. The corresponding analysis reveals that specific industrial sectors tend to favor distinct directionality patterns and that the cross-clustering coefficient for geographically close country pairs is remarkably high, indicating that spatial factors are still of paramount importance for the organization of trade patterns in modern economy. Regarding the evolution of the trade network’s substructure, globalization is well-expressed by trends of several structural characteristics (e.g., link density and node strength) in the interacting network framework. Extreme events, such as the financial crisis 2008/2009, are manifested as anomalies superimposed to these trends. The marked reorganization of trade patterns, associated with this economic crisis in comparison to “normal” annual fluctuations in the network structure is traced and quantified by a new widely applicable generalization of the Hamming distance to weighted networks."
https://openalex.org/W2155900219,"Antimicrobial resistance remains a growing and significant concern in human and veterinary medicine. Current laboratory methods for the detection and surveillance of antimicrobial resistant bacteria are limited in their effectiveness and scope. With the rapidly developing field of whole genome sequencing beginning to be utilised in clinical practice, the ability to interrogate sequencing data quickly and easily for the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes will become increasingly important and useful for informing clinical decisions. Additionally, use of such tools will provide insight into the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic samples such as those used in environmental monitoring.Here we present the Search Engine for Antimicrobial Resistance (SEAR), a pipeline and web interface for detection of horizontally acquired antimicrobial resistance genes in raw sequencing data. The pipeline provides gene information, abundance estimation and the reconstructed sequence of antimicrobial resistance genes; it also provides web links to additional information on each gene. The pipeline utilises clustering and read mapping to annotate full-length genes relative to a user-defined database. It also uses local alignment of annotated genes to a range of online databases to provide additional information. We demonstrate SEAR's application in the detection and abundance estimation of antimicrobial resistance genes in two novel environmental metagenomes, 32 human faecal microbiome datasets and 126 clinical isolates of Shigella sonnei.We have developed a pipeline that contributes to the improved capacity for antimicrobial resistance detection afforded by next generation sequencing technologies, allowing for rapid detection of antimicrobial resistance genes directly from sequencing data. SEAR uses raw sequencing data via an intuitive interface so can be run rapidly without requiring advanced bioinformatic skills or resources. Finally, we show that SEAR is effective in detecting antimicrobial resistance genes in metagenomic and isolate sequencing data from both environmental metagenomes and sequencing data from clinical isolates."

BHK cells harboring ABCA1-MM were generated using the mifepristone-inducible GeneSwitch system (Invitrogen) as described previously (20Oram J.F. Vaughan A.M. Stocker R.

Human ABCA1-MM cDNA was inserted into pGene/V5-HisA(blasticidin), in which the original Zeocin resistance gene was replaced by the blasticidin resistance gene.

After the selection, a clone in which ABCA1-MM expression was highly induced by mifepristone was isolated. Mouse and hamster cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and in DMEM/F-12 (DF) supplemented with 7.5% FBS, respectively. All cells were grown in humidified CO2 incubators at 37 °C. Media used were designated as follows: medium A contains 10 or 7.5% FBS as described above; medium B contains 0.1% BSA; medium D contains 5% delipidated FBS; medium F contains no supplements. Incubation of MEFs in medium F for up to 24 h did not cause significant cell death, as demonstrated by flow cytometric measurement of the incorporation of 7-amino-actinomycin D (BD Biosciences) into cells (viability ≥97%). Five different assays were employed to study retrograde transport of sterol from PM. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2.5 × 105 cells/well for MEFs or at 2.0 × 105 cells/well for CHO and BHK cells and were treated as indicated in the figure legends before labeling. First, cells were pulse-labeled with [3H]acetate for 1 h at 37 °C and then chased in medium F for various times as indicated to monitor the conversion of precursor sterols to cholesterol by a method employed previously (8Yamauchi Y. Reid P.C. Sperry J.B. Furukawa K. Takeya M. Chang C.C. Chang T.Y. Plasma membrane rafts complete cholesterol synthesis by participating in retrograde movement of precursor sterols.J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 34994-35004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Second, the conversion of [3H]lanosterol to [3H]cholesterol was monitored. Cells were pulse-labeled with 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]lanosterol (added to medium B as 0.1% ethanolic solution) in medium B for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by washing cells with medium B twice and chasing in medium F for various times as indicated. Sterols were extracted, saponified, and analyzed by TLC as above. Third, to monitor retrograde movement of cholesterol, the conversion of [3H]cholesterol to [3H]cholesteryl ester was monitored; cells were pulse-labeled with 0.1 μCi/ml [3H]cholesterol (added to medium B as 0.1% ethanolic solution without adding unlabeled cholesterol as carrier) in medium B for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by chasing as above. Alternatively, cells were incubated with [3H]cholesterol for 8 h in medium A and further incubated for 16 h in medium A in the absence of [3H]cholesterol to reach cellular [3H]cholesterol distribution at the steady-state level. Cellular lipids were separated by TLC; radioactivities in cholesterol and cholesteryl oleate fractions were counted. In certain experiments as indicated, agents were included in medium during the chase period. When using mifepristone-induced ABCA1 expression system, cells were either treated or untreated with mifepristone and then used to perform the pulse/chase experiments; counts in [3H]cholesteryl ester formed in untreated cells were subtracted from those formed in mifepristone-treated cells, to calculate ABCA1-dependent esterification. Fourth, ACAT1 activity in intact cells was monitored by feeding cells with [14C]oleate for 3 h and determined the incorporation of [14C]oleate into CE according to procedures described previously (16Yamauchi Y.

Fifth, intracellular transport of LDL-derived cholesterol (LDL-Chol) was monitored by using [3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing LDL; cells were incubated with [3H]cholesteryl oleate-containing LDL for 4 h at 18 °C and chased in medium D at 37 °C for various times. After the chase period, cells were treated with 4% methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MCD) for 10 min at 4 °C to determine PM-associated [3H]cholesterol. LDL uptake was determined by measuring the sum of 3H counts present in cells and in medium. Rabbit anti-human ABCA1 antiserum was described previously (15Arakawa R. Yokoyama S.

Seventy two hours after transfection, cells were subjected to further analyses. Total RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). mRNA levels of various genes were determined by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) and quantified by using the ΔΔCT method; Hprt expression was used as an internal control as described previously (24Bryleva E.Y.

Cells cultured on glass-bottom dishes in medium A for 2 days were washed with phenol red-free DF. Cells were then incubated with mCherry-D4 (16 μg/ml) in phenol red-free DF at room temperature for 10 min. After several washes with phenol red-free DF, cell were further incubated in phenol red-free DF at room temperature. Cell images were acquired within 15 min without fixation by using a Zeiss LSM 700 confocal microscope equipped with PLAN-NEOFLUAR ×20 (0.5 NA) objective (Zeiss). Images were then processed with LSM 700 software Zen (Zeiss) and ImageJ software. Cell surface GM1 levels were examined by flow cytometry. Cells were detached by trypsin and incubated with 1 μg/ml biotin-conjugated cholera toxin B subunit (biotin-CTxB) (List Biological Laboratories) for 60 min at 4 °C. After washing cells with ice-cold PBS, they were incubated with FITC-conjugated avidin for 60 min and washed extensively, followed by fluorescence measurement using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences). Gated 10,000 cells were analyzed for each sample, and mean fluorescence intensity was determined. Total cholesterol, free cholesterol, and choline-PLs were measured by colorimetric enzymatic assay systems as described (16Yamauchi Y. Chang C.C. Hayashi M. Abe-Dohmae S. Reid P.C. Chang T.Y.

https://openalex.org/W994640441,"Inflammation is an important feature of carcinogenesis. Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) can be associated with either poor or improved prognosis, depending on their properties and polarization. Current knowledge of the prognostic significance of TAMs in bladder cancer is limited and was investigated in this study. We analyzed 184 urothelial bladder cancer patients undergoing transurethral resection of a bladder tumor or radical cystectomy. CD68 (pan-macrophage marker), MAC387 (polarized towards type 1 macrophages), and CLEVER-1/Stabilin-1 (type 2 macrophages and lymphatic/blood vessels) were detected immunohistochemically. The median follow-up time was 6.0 years. High macrophage counts associated with a higher pT category and grade. Among patients undergoing transurethral resection, all studied markers apart from CLEVER-1/Stabilin-1 were associated with increased risk of progression and poorer disease-specific and overall survival in univariate analyses. High levels of two macrophage markers (CD68/MAC387+/+ or CD68/CLEVER-1+/+ groups) had an independent prognostic role after transurethral resection in multivariate analyses. In the cystectomy cohort, MAC387, alone and in combination with CD68, was associated with poorer survival in univariate analyses, but none of the markers were independent predictors of outcome in multivariate analyses. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that macrophage phenotypes provide significant independent prognostic information, particularly in bladder cancers undergoing transurethral resection."
https://openalex.org/W1916898367,"In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the essential nuclear helicase Sen1 is required for efficient termination of transcription of short noncoding RNA genes by RNA polymerase II. However, the mechanism by which Sen1 promotes transcription termination is not known. Prior biochemical studies on the Sen1 homolog from Schizosaccharomyces pombe showed that it can bind and unwind both DNA and RNA, but the S. pombe protein is not essential and has not been demonstrated to function in transcription. Furthermore, Sen1 from either yeast has not previously been expressed as a recombinant protein, due to its large molecular mass (252 kDa in S. cerevisiae). Here, we report the purification and characterization of the 89-kDa S. cerevisiae Sen1 helicase domain (Sen1-HD) produced in Escherichia coli. Sen1-HD binds single-stranded RNA and DNA with similar affinity in the absence of ATP, but it binds RNA more stably than DNA in the presence of ATP, apparently due to a slower translocation rate on RNA. Translocation occurs in the 5′ to 3′ direction, as for the S. pombe protein. When purified from E. coli at a moderate salt concentration, Sen1-HD was associated with short RNAs that are enriched for the trinucleotide repeat (CAN)4. We propose that Sen1 binds to RNAs and prevents their stable pairing with DNA, consistent with in vivo studies by others showing increased R-loop (RNA/DNA hybrid) formation when Sen1 activity is impaired by mutations. Our results are consistent with a model in which Sen1 promotes transcription termination by resolving R-loops."
https://openalex.org/W1616573322,"Formation of foam cell macrophages, which sequester extracellular modified lipids, is a key event in atherosclerosis. How lipid loading affects macrophage phenotype is controversial, with evidence suggesting either pro- or anti-inflammatory consequences. To investigate this further, we compared the transcriptomes of foamy and non-foamy macrophages that accumulate in the subcutaneous granulomas of fed-fat ApoE null mice and normal chow fed wild-type mice in vivo. Consistent with previous studies, LXR/RXR pathway genes were significantly over-represented among the genes up-regulated in foam cell macrophages. Unexpectedly, the hepatic fibrosis pathway, associated with platelet derived growth factor and transforming growth factor-β action, was also over-represented. Several collagen polypeptides and proteoglycan core proteins as well as connective tissue growth factor and fibrosis-related FOS and JUN transcription factors were up-regulated in foam cell macrophages. Increased expression of several of these genes was confirmed at the protein level in foam cell macrophages from subcutaneous granulomas and in atherosclerotic plaques. Moreover, phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of SMAD2, which is downstream of several transforming growth factor-β family members, was also detected in foam cell macrophages. We conclude that foam cell formation in vivo leads to a pro-fibrotic macrophage phenotype, which could contribute to plaque stability, especially in early lesions that have few vascular smooth muscle cells."
https://openalex.org/W1473982830,"The cutaneous inflammation associated with acne vulgaris is caused by the anaerobic bacterium Propionibacterium acnes through activation of the innate immune system in the skin. Current standard treatments for acne have limitations that include adverse effects and poor efficacy in many patients, making development of a more effective therapy highly desirable. In the present study, we demonstrate the protective effects of a novel customized α-helical cationic peptide, P5, against P. acnes-induced inflammatory responses in vitro and in vivo. Application of P5 significantly reduced expression of two inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and TNF-α in P. acnes-treated primary human keratinocytes, where P5 appeared to act in part by binding to bacterial lipoteichoic acid, thereby suppressing TLR2-to-NF-κB signaling. In addition, in a mouse model of acne vulgaris, P5 exerted both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects against P. acnes, but exerted no cytotoxic effects against skin cells. These results demonstrate that P5, and perhaps other cationic antimicrobial peptides, offer the unique ability to reduce numbers P. acnes cells in the skin and to inhibit the inflammation they trigger. This suggests these peptides could potentially be used to effectively treat acne without adversely affecting the skin."

Results show that global financial markets are resilient to shocks caused by earthquakes even if these are domestic. Our analysis reveals that, in a few instances, some macroeconomic variables and earthquake characteristics (gross domestic product per capita, trade openness, bilateral trade flows, earthquake magnitude, a tsunami indicator, distance to the epicenter, and number of fatalities) mediate the impact of earthquakes on stock market returns, resulting in a zero net effect. However, the influence of these variables is market-specific, indicating no systematic pattern across global capital markets. Results also demonstrate that stock market volatility is unaffected by earthquakes, except for Japan."
https://openalex.org/W2153923260,"Alpine plants are considered to be particularly vulnerable to climate change and related extreme episodes, such as heat waves. Despite growing interest in the impact of heat waves on alpine plants, knowledge about their effects on regeneration is still fragmentary. Recruitment from seeds will be crucial for the successful migration and survival of these species and will play a key role in their future adaptation to climate change. In this study, we assessed the impacts of heat waves on the seed germination of 53 high mountain plants from the Northern Apennines (Italy). The seeds were exposed to laboratory simulations of three seasonal temperature treatments, derived from real data recorded at a meteorological station near the species growing site, which included two heat wave episodes that occurred both in spring 2003 and in autumn 2011. Moreover, to consider the effect of increasing drought conditions related to heat waves, seed germination was also investigated under four different water potentials. In the absence of heat waves, seed germination mainly occurred in spring, after seeds had experienced autumn and winter seasons. However, heat waves resulted in a significant increase of spring germination in c. 30% of the species and elicited autumn germination in 50%. When heat waves were coupled with drought, seed germination decreased in all species, but did not stop completely. Our results suggest that in the future, heat waves will affect the germination phenology of alpine plants, especially conditionally dormant and strictly cold-adapted chorotypes, by shifting the emergence time from spring to autumn and by increasing the proportion of emerged seedlings. The detrimental effects of heat waves on recruitment success is less likely to be due to the inhibition of seed germination per se, but rather due to seedling survival in seasons, and temperature and water conditions that they are not used to experiencing. Changes in the proportion and timing of emergence suggest that there may be major implications for future plant population size and structure."
https://openalex.org/W1643496306,"White-Nose Syndrome (WNS) is an epizootic disease in hibernating bats caused by the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans. Surveillance for P. destructans at bat hibernacula consists primarily of visual surveys of bats, collection of potentially infected bats, and submission of these bats for laboratory testing. Cryptic infections (bats that are infected but display no visual signs of fungus) could lead to the mischaracterization of the infection status of a site and the inadvertent spread of P. destructans. We determined the efficacy of visual detection of P. destructans by examining visual signs and molecular detection of P. destructans on 928 bats of six species at 27 sites during surveys conducted from January through March in 2012-2014 in the southeastern USA on the leading edge of the disease invasion. Cryptic infections were widespread with 77% of bats that tested positive by qPCR showing no visible signs of infection. The probability of exhibiting visual signs of infection increased with sampling date and pathogen load, the latter of which was substantially higher in three species (Myotis lucifugus, M. septentrionalis, and Perimyotis subflavus). In addition, M. lucifugus was more likely to show visual signs of infection than other species given the same pathogen load. Nearly all infections were cryptic in three species (Eptesicus fuscus, M. grisescens, and M. sodalis), which had much lower fungal loads. The presence of M. lucifugus or M. septentrionalis at a site increased the probability that P. destructans was visually detected on bats. Our results suggest that cryptic infections of P. destructans are common in all bat species, and visible infections rarely occur in some species. However, due to very high infection prevalence and loads in some species, we estimate that visual surveys examining at least 17 individuals of M. lucifugus and M. septentrionalis, or 29 individuals of P. subflavus are still effective to determine whether a site has bats infected with P. destructans. In addition, because the probability of visually detecting the fungus was higher later in winter, surveys should be done as close to the end of the hibernation period as possible."
https://openalex.org/W965281197,"Endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (ENGase), which catalyzes hydrolysis of N-linked oligosaccharides, is a useful tool for analyzing oligosaccharide contents of glycoproteins. However, there are only a few known ENGases that can catalyze the hydrolysis of human complex type oligosaccharides, and although commercially available, they are expensive. Here, we report the cloning of two ENGase encoding cDNAs from the basidiomycete fungus Coprinopsis cinerea, Endo-CC1 and Endo-CC2. We successfully expressed recombinant His6-tagged Endo-CC1 and Endo-CC2 in Escherichia coli and purified them for enzymatic characterization. Both Endo-CC1 and Endo-CC2 showed hydrolytic activity on high-mannose and complex type oligosaccharides. Since Endo-CC1 could be prepared more easily than Endo-CC2 from E. coli cultures, we examined the enzymatic properties of Endo-CC1 in detail. Our results showed that Endo-CC1 acted on both N-linked high-mannose type and sialobiantennary type complex oligosaccharides of glycoproteins RNase B and human transferrin, respectively, but not on the sialotriantennary type complex oligosaccharide of glycoprotein fetuin. Examination of the transglycosylation activity of Endo-CC1 revealed that the wild-type Endo-CC1 could not transfer the sialobiantennary type complex oligosaccharide onto the deglycosylated RNase B. To obtain an Endo-CC1 mutant with desired transglycosylation activity, we performed mutation analysis of the active site residue Asn 180 (N180), known to be important for catalysis, by individually replacing it with the remaining 19 amino acid residues. Transglycosylation analyses of these mutants led us to identify one mutant, namely Endo-CC1N180H, which exhibited the desired transglycosylation activity. Taken together, we suggest that Endo-CC1 would potentially be a valuable tool for analyzing oligosaccharides on glycoproteins, as large quantities of it could be made available more easily and less expensively than the currently used enzyme, Endo-M."
https://openalex.org/W2139647689,"The neural crest (NC) is a transient, migratory cell population that differentiates into a large variety of tissues including craniofacial cartilage, melanocytes, and peripheral nervous system. NC is initially induced at the border of neural plate and non-neural ectoderm by balanced regulation of multiple signaling pathways among which an intermediate bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling is essential for NC formation. ets1, a proto-oncogene playing important roles in tumor invasion, has also been implicated in delamination of NC cells. In this study, we investigated Ets1 function in NC formation using Xenopus. Overexpression of ets1 repressed NC formation through down-regulation of BMP signaling. Moreover, ets1 repressed the BMP-responsive gene id3 that is essential for NC formation. Conversely, overexpression of id3 can partially rescue the phenotype of NC inhibition induced by ectopic ets1. Mechanistically, we found that Ets1 binds to id3 promoter as well as histone deacetylase 1, suggesting that Ets1 recruits histone deacetylase 1 to the promoter of id3, thereby inducing histone deacetylation of the id3 promoter. Thus, our studies indicate that Ets1 regulates NC formation through attenuating BMP signaling epigenetically."
https://openalex.org/W1012205537,"The cell wall integrity pathway (CWI) plays an important role in the biogenesis of the cell wall in Candida albicans and other fungi. In the present work, the C. albicans MKK2 gene that encodes the putative MAPKK of this pathway was deleted in different backgrounds and the phenotypes of the resultant mutants were characterised. We show here that Mkk2 mediates the phosphorylation of the Mkc1 MAPK in response to cell wall assembly interfering agents such as zymolyase or tunicamycin and also to oxidative stress. Remarkably, mkk2 and mkc1 mutants display related but distinguishable- cell wall associated phenotypes and differ in the pattern of MAPK phosphorylation under different stress conditions. mkk2 and mkc1 mutants display an altered expression of GSC1, CEK1 and CRH11 genes at different temperatures. Combined deletion of MKK2 with HST7 supports a cooperative role for the Cek1-mediated and CWI pathways in regulating cell wall architecture under vegetative growth. However, and in contrast to Mkc1, Mkk2 does not seem to play a role in the virulence of C. albicans in the mouse systemic model or the Galleria mellonella model of infection."
https://openalex.org/W2248623199,"Sepsis is a deadly disease characterized by an overwhelming release of inflammatory mediators and the activation of different types of cells. This altered state of cell activation, termed leukocyte reprogramming, contributes to patient outcome. However, the understanding of the process underlying sepsis and the role of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in sepsis remains to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the role of CCR4, the CCL17/CCL22 chemokine receptor, in the innate and acquired immune responses during severe sepsis and the role of Tregs in effecting the outcome. In contrast with wild-type (WT) mice subjected to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) sepsis, CCR4-deficient (CCR4-/-) septic mice presented an increased survival rate, significant neutrophil migration toward the infection site, a low bacterial count in the peritoneum, and reduced lung inflammation and serum cytokine levels. Thus, a better early host response may favor an adequate long-term response. Consequently, the CCR4-/- septic mice were not susceptible to secondary fungal infection, in contrast with the WT septic mice. Furthermore, Tregs cells from the CCR4-/- septic mice showed reduced suppressive effects on neutrophil migration (both in vivo and in vitro), lymphocyte proliferation and ROS production from activated neutrophils, in contrast with what was observed for Tregs from the WT septic mice. These data show that CCR4 is involved in immunosuppression after severe sepsis and suggest that CCR4+ Tregs negatively modulate the short and long-term immune responses."
https://openalex.org/W1579707036,"Pollen forecasts are in use everywhere to inform therapeutic decisions for patients with allergic rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC). We exploited data derived from Twitter in order to identify tweets reporting a combination of symptoms consistent with a case definition of ARC and those reporting the name of an antihistamine drug. In order to increase the sensitivity of the system, we applied an algorithm aimed at automatically identifying jargon expressions related to medical terms. We compared weekly Twitter trends with National Allergy Bureau weekly pollen counts derived from US stations, and found a high correlation of the sum of the total pollen counts from each stations with tweets reporting ARC symptoms (Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.95) and with tweets reporting antihistamine drug names (Pearson's correlation coefficient: 0.93). Longitude and latitude of the pollen stations affected the strength of the correlation. Twitter and other social networks may play a role in allergic disease surveillance and in signaling drug consumptions trends."
https://openalex.org/W987734449,"Individuals vary within a species in many ecologically important ways, but the causes and consequences of such variation are often poorly understood. Foraging behavior is among the most profitable and risky activities in which organisms engage and is expected to be under strong selection. Among social insects there is evidence that within-colony variation in traits such as foraging behavior can increase colony fitness, but variation between colonies and the potential consequences of such variation are poorly documented. In this study, we tested natural populations of the red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta, for the existence of colony and regional variation in foraging behavior and tested the persistence of this variation over time and across foraging habitats. We also reared single-lineage colonies in standardized environments to explore the contribution of colony lineage. Fire ants from natural populations exhibited significant and persistent colony and regional-level variation in foraging behaviors such as extra-nest activity, exploration, and discovery of and recruitment to resources. Moreover, colony-level variation in extra-nest activity was significantly correlated with colony growth, suggesting that this variation has fitness consequences. Lineage of the colony had a significant effect on extra-nest activity and exploratory activity and explained approximately half of the variation observed in foraging behaviors, suggesting a heritable component to colony-level variation in behavior."
https://openalex.org/W2242267305,"Background The significance of right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF), independent of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), following isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and valve procedures remains unknown. The aim of this study is to examine the significance of abnormal RVEF by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), independent of LVEF in predicting outcomes of patients undergoing isolated CABG and valve surgery. Methods From 2007 to 2009, 109 consecutive patients (mean age, 66 years; 38% female) were referred for pre-operative CMR. Abnormal RVEF and LVEF were considered <35% and <45%, respectively. Elective primary procedures include CABG (56%) and valve (44%). Thirty-day outcomes were perioperative complications, length of stay, cardiac re-hospitalizations and early mortaility; long-term (> 30 days) outcomes included, cardiac re-hospitalization, worsening congestive heart failure and mortality. Mean clinical follow up was 14 months. Findings Forty-eight patients had reduced RVEF (mean 25%) and 61 patients had normal RVEF (mean 50%) (p<0.001). Fifty-four patients had reduced LVEF (mean 30%) and 55 patients had normal LVEF (mean 59%) (p<0.001). Patients with reduced RVEF had a higher incidence of long-term cardiac re-hospitalization vs. patients with normal RVEF (31% vs.13%, p<0.05). Abnormal RVEF was a predictor for long-term cardiac re-hospitalization (HR 3.01 [CI 1.5-7.9], p<0.03). Reduced LVEF did not influence long-term cardiac re-hospitalization. Conclusion Abnormal RVEF is a stronger predictor for long-term cardiac re-hospitalization than abnormal LVEF in patients undergoing isolated CABG and valve procedures."
https://openalex.org/W953473434,"Iron is an essential chemical element for human life. However, in some pathological conditions, such as hereditary hemochromatosis type 1 (HH1), iron overload induces the production of reactive oxygen species that may lead to lipid peroxidation and a change in the plasma-membrane lipid profile. In this study, we investigated whether iron overload interferes with the Na,K-ATPase activity of the plasma membrane by studying erythrocytes that were obtained from the whole blood of patients suffering from iron overload. Additionally, we treated erythrocytes of normal subjects with 0.8 mM H2O2 and 1 μM FeCl3 for 24 h. We then analyzed the lipid profile, lipid peroxidation and Na,K-ATPase activity of plasma membranes derived from these cells. Iron overload was more frequent in men (87.5%) than in women and was associated with an increase (446%) in lipid peroxidation, as indicated by the amount of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and an increase (327%) in the Na,K-ATPase activity in the plasma membrane of erythrocytes. Erythrocytes treated with 1 μM FeCl3 for 24 h showed an increase (132%) in the Na,K-ATPase activity but no change in the TBARS levels. Iron treatment also decreased the cholesterol and phospholipid content of the erythrocyte membranes and similar decreases were observed in iron overload patients. In contrast, erythrocytes treated with 0.8 mM H2O2 for 24 h showed no change in the measured parameters. These results indicate that erythrocytes from patients with iron overload exhibit higher Na,K-ATPase activity compared with normal subjects and that this effect is specifically associated with altered iron levels."

In this study we show that YY1 is tyrosine-phosphorylated in multiple cell types. Using a combination of pharmacological inhibition, kinase overexpression, and kinase knock-out studies, we demonstrate that YY1 is a target of multiple Src family kinases in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, we have identified multiple sites of YY1 phosphorylation and analyzed the effect of phosphorylation on the activity of YY1-responsive retroviral and cellular promoters. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 383 interferes with DNA and RNA binding, leading to the down-regulation of YY1 activity.

https://openalex.org/W993492462,"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is a relatively long-lived signaling molecule that plays an essential role in oocyte maturation, implantation, as well as early embryonic development. Exposure to relatively high levels of H2O2 functions efficiently to accelerate oocyte aging and deteriorate oocyte quality. However, little precise information exists regarding intra-oocyte H2O2 concentrations, and its diffusion to the oocyte milieu. In this work, we utilized an L-shaped amperometric integrated H2O2-selective probe to directly and quantitatively measure the real-time intra-oocyte H2O2 concentration. This investigation provides an exact measurement of H2O2 in situ by reducing the possible loss of H2O2 caused by diffusion or reactivity with other biological systems. This experiment suggests that the intra-oocyte H2O2 levels of oocytes obtained from young animals are reasonably high and remained constant during the procedure measurements. However, the intra-oocyte H2O2 concentration dropped significantly (40-50% reduction) in response to catalase pre-incubation, suggesting that the measurements are truly H2O2 based. To further confirm the extracellular diffusion of H2O2, oocytes were incubated with myeloperoxidase (MPO), and the diffused H2O2 triggered MPO chlorinating activity. Our results show that the generated hypochlorous acid (HOCl) facilitated the deterioration in oocyte quality, a process that could be prevented by pre-incubating the oocytes with melatonin, which was experimentally proven to be oxidized utilizing HPLC methods. This study is the first to demonstrate direct quantitative measurement of intracellular H2O2, and its extracellular diffusion and activation of MPO as well as its impact on oocyte quality. These results may help in designing more accurate treatment plans in assisted reproduction under inflammatory conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1537338489,"Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men with limited treatment options for the hormone-resistant forms. Development of novel therapeutic options is critically needed to target advanced forms. Here we demonstrate that combinatorial treatment with the thiazolidinedione troglitazone (TZD) and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) can induce significant apoptosis in various PCa cells independent of androgen receptor status. Because TZD is known to activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), we determined whether AMPK is a molecular target mediating this apoptotic cascade by utilizing PCa cell lines stably overexpressing AMPKα1 dominant negative (C4-2-DN) or empty vector (C4-2-EV). Our results indicated a significantly higher degree of apoptosis with TRAIL-TZD combination in C4-2-EV cells compared with C4-2-DN cells. Similarly, results from a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed a larger reduction of viability of C4-2-EV cells compared with C4-2-DN cells when treated with TRAIL-TZD, thus suggesting that C4-2-DN cells were more apoptosis-resistant. Additionally, siRNA-mediated knockdown of endogenous AMPKα1 expression showed a reduction of TRAIL-TZD-induced apoptosis, further confirming the participation of AMPK in mediating this apoptosis. Apoptosis induction by this combinatorial treatment was also associated with a cleavage of β-catenin that was inhibited in both C4-2-DN cells and those cells in which AMPKα1 was knocked down. In addition, time course studies showed an increase in pACCS79 (AMPK target) levels coinciding with the time of apoptosis. These studies indicate the involvement of AMPK in TRAIL-TZD-mediated apoptosis and β-catenin cleavage and suggest the possibility of utilizing AMPK as a therapeutic target in apoptosis-resistant prostate cancer."

The participants underwent oral- and intravenous glucose tolerance tests for estimation of glucose tolerance and surrogate measures of insulin sensitivity. Anthropometric measures were retrieved and biochemical measures of the plasma lipid profile and serum YKL-40 levels were obtained. Association-analyses between serum YKL-40 and obesity-related traits and estimates of the narrow sense heritability of YKL-40 were based on a polygenic variance component model.Fasting serum levels of YKL-40 were positively associated with waist-hip-ratio (p<0.001) and fasting plasma triglyceride levels (p<0.001). None of the insulin sensitivity indexes were significantly associated with YKL-40. According to the AE model, the familiality-estimate h2 of YKL-40 was 0.45 (SE 0.13). When the ACE-model was applied, the heritability-estimate h2 of YKL-40 did not reach statistical significance.Our results suggest a role of serum YKL-40 in obesity-related low grade inflammation, but do not indicate that YKL-40 is directly involved in the development of T2D."
https://openalex.org/W1935433464,"Specific G protein coupled receptors (GPRs) regulate the proper positioning, function, and development of immune lineage subsets. Here, we demonstrate that GPR18 regulates the reconstitution of intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) of the small intestine following bone marrow transplantation. Through analysis of transcriptional microarray data, we find that GPR18 is highly expressed in IELs, lymphoid progenitors, and mature follicular B cells. To establish the physiological role of this largely uncharacterized GPR, we generated Gpr18-/- mice. Despite high levels of GPR18 expression in specific hematopoietic progenitors, Gpr18-/- mice have no defects in lymphopoiesis or myelopoiesis. Moreover, antibody responses following immunization with hapten-protein conjugates or infection with West Nile virus are normal in Gpr18-/- mice. Steady-state numbers of IELs are also normal in Gpr18-/- mice. However, competitive bone marrow reconstitution experiments demonstrate that GPR18 is cell-intrinsically required for the optimal restoration of small intestine TCRγδ+ and TCRαβ+ CD8αα+ IELs. In contrast, GPR18 is dispensable for the reconstitution of large intestine IELs. Moreover, Gpr18-/- bone marrow reconstitutes small intestine IELs similarly to controls in athymic recipients. Gpr18-/- chimeras show no changes in susceptibility to intestinal insults such as Citrobacter rodentium infections or graft versus host disease. These data reveal highly specific requirements for GPR18 in the development and reconstitution of thymus-derived intestinal IEL subsets in the steady-state and after bone marrow transplantation."
https://openalex.org/W2137519748,"Background Kaposi’s sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is the etiologic agent of KS, the most common AIDS-related malignancy. The majority of KS tumor cells harbor latent KSHV virus but only a small percentage undergoes spontaneous lytic replication. Viral reactivation from latency is crucial for the pathogenesis and development of KS, but the cellular mechanisms underlying the switch between viral latency and replication are not well understood. Methods The level of let-7 miRNAs and MAP4K4 in KSHV infected 293T cells were quantified by real-time PCRs. Let-7 expression was silenced by the miRNA sponge technique. In let-7a transfected 293T cells, the expression of MAP4K4 was measured by real-time PCR and western blot. Luciferease expression was employed to examine the effect of let-7a on the 3’-untranslated region (UTR) of the MAP4K4 gene in 293T cells. Real-time PCR was used to quantify the KSHV copy numbers in BC-3 cells in which the expression of let-7a and/or MAP4K4 were altered. Finally, ERK, JNK and p38 protein production and their phosphorylation status were detected by western blots in let-7a or MAP4K4 transfected BCBL-1 cells. Results The expression of microRNA let-7 was dramatically decreased in KSHV infected 293T cells, but that of MAP4K4 was increased significantly. Let-7a is physically associated with and targets the MAP4K4 3’UTR, and inhibits MAP4K4 expression at both mRNA and protein levels. MAP4K4 stimulates KSHV reactivation from latency, whereas let-7a inhibits the function of MAP4K4 by reversing the function of MAP4K4 on JNK, phospho-JNK and phospho-ERK1/2 levels. Conclusion Our results establish that let-7a specifically suppresses MAP4K4 expression, and further inhibits KSHV reactivation by interfering with the function of MAP4K4 on the MAPK pathway, highlighting let-7a as a potential treatment for KS."
https://openalex.org/W969398723,"Among many other virulence factors, Clostridium perfringens produces three sialidases NanH, NanI and NanJ. NanH lacks a secretion signal peptide and is predicted to be an intracellular enzyme, while NanI and NanJ are secreted. Previously, we had identified part of an operon encoding NanE (epimerase) and NanA (sialic acid lyase) enzymes. Further analysis of the entire operon suggests that it encodes a complete pathway for the transport and metabolism of sialic acid along with a putative transcriptional regulator, NanR. The addition of 30 mM N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) to a semi-defined medium significantly enhanced the growth yield of strain 13, suggesting that Neu5Ac can be used as a nutrient. C. perfringens strain 13 lacks a nanH gene, but has NanI- and NanJ-encoding genes. Analysis of nanI, nanJ, and nanInanJ mutants constructed by homologous recombination revealed that the expression of the major sialidase, NanI, was induced by the addition of Neu5Ac to the medium, and that in separate experiments, the same was true of a nanI-gusA transcriptional fusion. For the nanI and nanJ genes, primer extension identified three and two putative transcription start sites, respectively. Gel mobility shift assays using purified NanR and DNA from the promoter regions of the nanI and nanE genes showed high affinity, specific binding by NanR. We propose that NanR is a global regulator of sialic acid-associated genes and that it responds, in a positive feedback loop, to the concentration of sialic acid in the cell."

Here, we asked whether CK2 interacts with other proteins involved in processes at the NMJ, which would be consistent with the previous observation that CK2 appears enriched at the NMJ.

To further characterize the interaction of CK2 with these key players at the NMJ, we identified the epitopes within Rapsyn, Rac1, 14-3-3γ, and Dok-7 that interact with the protein kinase CK2. Additionally, CK2 even phosphorylated 14-3-3γ and Dok-7 but not Rac1 and Rapsyn in vitro. For Rapsyn, we predicted serine 224 as a potential CK2 target in vivo, and we demonstrated that a phosphomimetic Rapsyn mutant was able to bind CK2 with higher affinity. Serine residue 235 of 14-3-3γ was identified to be a CK2 phosphorylation target site. Tellingly, Dok-7 was strongly phosphorylated at several serine residues by CK2. Dok-7 phosphomimetic mutants improved AChR aggregation on C2C12 myotubes. For GST pulldown experiments and co-immunoprecipitation studies, the coding sequences of various mouse genes were cloned into pcDNA3–6HA to generate the respective expression plasmids.

Casein kinase 2-dependent serine phosphorylation of MuSK regulates acetylcholine receptor aggregation at the neuromuscular junction.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1800-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). For epitope mapping studies, different epitopes of mouse Dok-7, 14-3-3γ, Rapsyn, and Rac1 were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEX-KG to generate GST fusions, and the recombinant GST fusion proteins were purified from Escherichia coli. For generating mutants (carboxyl-terminal truncations) of Dok-7, 14-3-3γ, Rapsyn, and Rac1, appropriate primers were used. For in vitro CK2 phosphorylation studies, different PCR-amplified epitopes of mouse Dok-7 and 14-3-3γ were fused to GST using pGEX-KG and the restriction sites BamHI and HindIII or BamHI and XhoI. Substitutions of serine or threonine residues by alanines, aspartates, or glutamates were introduced into the full-length Dok-7, 14-3-3γ, or Rapsyn plasmids after cloning into pGEX-KG or pcDNA3-6HA and in the Dok-7 fragments aa238–282 and aa283–347 after insertion into pGEX-KG using the QuikChange XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or the Q5® site-directed mutagenesis kit (New England Biolabs) following the manufacturers' protocols. All mutations were verified by sequencing (LGC Genomics) after each cloning step. Phosphorylation site predictions were conducted using KinasePhos 2.0 (14Wong Y.H. Lee T.Y. Liang H.K. Huang C.M. Wang T.Y. Yang Y.H. Chu C.H. Huang H.D. Ko M.T. Hwang J.K.

HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (FCS; Invitrogen). HEK293 cells were transfected using PEI (Sigma-Aldrich). 10-cm plates were transfected with 10 μg of vector and 31 μl of 1× PEI for 12–24 h. Cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. Cells were washed twice with cold 1× PBS and lysed in lysis buffer containing 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA (pH 8), and a mixture of proteinase inhibitors (1 mm PMSF and 10 μg/μl aprotinin and leupeptin). For detection of proteins in Western blot analysis, monoclonal antibodies directed against the myc epitope (Cell Signaling Technology), the hemagglutinin epitope (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), CK2β (Olaf-Georg Issinger, Odense, Denmark), Dok-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and GAPDH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) served as primary antibodies, and anti-mouse or -rabbit Ig-coupled horseradish peroxidase (Cell Signaling Technology) was used as secondary antibodies. For detection, the ECL detection system (Amersham Biosciences) was used. Gastrocnemius and soleus muscles were dissected from wild type mice, dissolved in 3 ml of lysis buffer (1 m HEPES (pH 7.9), 1 m KCl, 0.5 m EDTA, 1 m DTT, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) supplemented with Nonidet P-40, and homogenized on ice. 250 μl of 5 m NaCl were added, the solution was rotated for 15 min at 4 °C and centrifuged, and the supernatant was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. For each extract of transiently transfected HEK293 cells, the expression level of the desired protein was analyzed by Western blotting. Then, for co-immunoprecipitation studies, 1 μl of a monoclonal antibody against the myc epitope was added, and the samples were incubated overnight at 4 °C under constant rotation. Next, 20 μl of PBS-equilibrated protein A-Sepharose CL-4B beads (Amersham Biosciences) were added, and incubation continued for another 2–4 h at 4 °C. After washing the beads in 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin, the precipitated proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For GST pulldowns, BL21 bacteria were transformed with the respective constructs, grown in 200-ml cultures at 37 °C until A600 was between 0.4 and 0.6, and induced by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 4–6 h at 37 °C to express the GST fusion proteins. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation, incubated in sonication buffer (50 mm NaH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μl/ml Triton X-100, 10 μg/ml DNase I, and 15 units/μl Lysozyme) at 4 °C for 30 min, lysed by sonication for a total time of 1 min, and centrifuged. The supernatants containing the GST fusion proteins were supplemented with 30 μl of equilibrated glutathione beads and incubated under constant rotation at 4 °C for 2–12 h. After washing three times with washing buffer (4.3 mm Na2HPO4, 1.47 mm KH2PO4, 137 mm NaCl, and 2.7 mm KCl), an aliquot of the beads, now carrying the GST fusion protein, was incubated with the extract from HEK293 cells expressing the desired protein after transient transfection. After washing the beads another three times with washing buffer containing 137 mm NaCl or 20 mm NaCl, proteins bound to the beads were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. For purification of recombinant Dok-7- and Rapsyn-GST fusion proteins, a different protocol was used. The bacterial pellet was resuspended in ice-cold STE buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 1 mm EDTA, and 150 mm NaCl). Then, after adding 0.1 mg/ml lysozyme, the bacterial pellet was incubated on ice for 15 min, supplemented with 10 mm DTT and 1.2% Sarkosyl, and sonicated for a total time of 1 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was diluted with STE buffer so that the concentration of Sarkosyl reached 0.7%, and Triton X-100 was added at a concentration of 2%. The lysate was incubated for 1 h on ice, then supplemented with PBS-equilibrated glutathione beads, and incubated with agitation at 4 °C for 2–12 h. Finally, the beads were washed three times with cold PBS. Recombinant purified full-length proteins or the indicated domains of CK2-interacting proteins were phosphorylated in vitro by CK2α (20 pmol; Kinase Logistics ApS, Denmark) alone or together with CK2β (20 pmol; Kinase Logistics ApS) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8), 10 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm DTT. After addition of [γ-32P]ATP, samples were incubated for 30 min at 30 °C; the reactions were stopped by addition of Laemmli buffer, and samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. As a positive control, CK2 activity was analyzed using a previously described synthetic peptide substrate (RRRDDDSDDD) (1Cheusova T. Khan M.A. Schubert S.W. Gavin A.C. Buchou T. Jacob G. Sticht H. Allende J. Boldyreff B. Brenner H.R. Hashemolhosseini S. Casein kinase 2-dependent serine phosphorylation of MuSK regulates acetylcholine receptor aggregation at the neuromuscular junction.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1800-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A 0.2 mm concentration of the peptide was incubated in 50 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.5), 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm DTT, 50 mm NaCl, and 50 μm [γ-32P]ATP (specific activity, 3500–7800 cpm/pmol) with recombinant CK2α from Xenopus laevis for 30 min (verification by SDS-PAGE) at 30 °C. The verification of the phosphorylation experiment by SDS-PAGE required [γ-32P]ATP with a specific activity of 20,000 cpm/pmol. The reaction was spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose paper and washed three times in ice-cold 75 mm H3PO4. Paper-associated radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. Control values obtained in assays without added enzyme were subtracted. For each peptide, the experiment was performed three times independently. For verification, reactions were analyzed by 14% SDS-PAGE. Radioactive bands were detected on a Molecular Imager FX apparatus (Bio-Rad). For immunohistochemical analysis, musculus gastrocnemius cross-sections were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for 5 min, and permeabilized for 5 min with PBS supplemented with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Then, sections were blocked in blocking solution (10% FCS and 1% BSA in PBS) for 1–2 h. For the monoclonal mouse α-CK2β (a gift from Olaf-Georg Issinger, Odense, Denmark), blocking was performed with a 1:40 dilution of M.O.M reagent (Vector Laboratories) under equivalent conditions to reduce unspecific binding. Thereafter, the sections were stained with the respective antibodies (dissolved in the blocking solution) at 4 °C overnight. For detection, primary antibodies α-CK2β (gift from Olaf-Georg Issinger, Odense, Denmark), α-Dok-7 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-14-3-3γ (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), α-Rapsyn (Acris), and α-Rac1 (Millipore) were combined with secondary antibodies α-Alexa Fluor 488 (Molecular Probes) and α-Cy3 (Dianova). Secondary antibodies were applied for 2 h at room temperature. Subsequently, sections were washed six times for 5 min in PBS and embedded with Mowiol. Electroporation with the NucleofectorTM kit V (Lonza) was used for transfection of C2C12 myoblasts. The cells were cultured on a 10-cm plate until confluence reached 60%, washed with sterile PBS, trypsinized, and harvested by centrifugation for 10 min at 90 × g. The pellet was resuspended in 100 μl of Nucleofector reagent, and the total amount of plasmid was added (4 μg total; 3.5 μg of expression construct + 0.5 μg of pCMV GFP-NLS). The cells were then electroporated in a Nucleofector cuvette, diluted in 15 ml of proliferation medium (DMEM, 20% FCS, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin), and distributed to 3.5-cm plates that had previously been coated with 25 μl of Matrigel. After 24 h, the medium was changed to differentiation medium (DMEM, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 5% horse serum). Prior to staining, C2C12 cells were fixed with cold 2% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. To visualize AChR clusters, rhodamine- or Alexa Fluor 647-coupled α-bungarotoxin (α-BTX) was applied at a 1:2,500 dilution in PBS, and cells were incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After three 5-min washes in PBS and 5 min of 1:5,000 DAPI staining, the cells were embedded with Mowiol. Analysis of clustering was performed as follows. Three independent transfections, each performed applying newly thawed and cultured C2C12 cells, were differentiated for 6 days with differentiation medium (DMEM, 5% horse serum, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin) and subjected to BTX staining. Myotubes showing BTX signals larger than 5 μm in length in a circumferential area of 10 μm around a transfected nucleus, as indicated by the green fluorescence of GFP-NLS, were counted in relation to the transfected tubes. Every tube was only counted once even if multiple nuclei were transfected to minimize confounding effects. This proportion for each condition was normalized to the respective proportion observed in pcDNA3-transfected controls from each transfection set, and the values were plotted and analyzed using GraphPad Prism. Data are presented as the mean values, and the error bars indicate ±S.D. The number of biological replicates per experimental variable (n) is usually >5 or as indicated in the figure legends. The significance was calculated by unpaired two-tailed t test or as indicated by the figure legends and is provided as real p values that are categorized for different significance levels: ***, p < 0.001; **, p < 0.01; or *, p < 0.05. Previously, we performed yeast two-hybrid screens and detected the interaction of protein kinase CK2 (subunit β and to a weaker extent subunit α) with the receptor tyrosine kinase MuSK at the NMJ (1Cheusova T. Khan M.A. Schubert S.W. Gavin A.C. Buchou T. Jacob G. Sticht H. Allende J. Boldyreff B. Brenner H.R. Hashemolhosseini S. Casein kinase 2-dependent serine phosphorylation of MuSK regulates acetylcholine receptor aggregation at the neuromuscular junction.Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 1800-1816Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here, we addressed whether other proteins that are located at the NMJ are also able to interact with CK2. To this end, we used GST fusion proteins of protein kinase CK2 subunit α or β with cell lysates of HEK293 cells that were transiently transfected with plasmids overexpressing one of the following genes for GST pulldown assays: AChRα, AChRβ, AChRγ, AChRδ, AChRϵ, MuSK, Rapsyn, Dok-7, Src, RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, 14-3-3γ, Dsh, and the cytosolic domain of Lrp4 (Fig. 1a). As reported previously, MuSK and Dsh interacted with CK2β and to lower extent with CK2α (Fig. 1a) (1Cheusova T. Khan M.A. Schubert S.W. Gavin A.C. Buchou T. Jacob G. Sticht H. Allende J. Boldyreff B. Brenner H.R. Hashemolhosseini S.

Brink M. Wodarz A. Varmus H. Nusse R. Casein kinase 2 associates with and phosphorylates dishevelled.EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). An almost similar interaction strength with both subunits of CK2 was detected for Rapsyn and Rac1 (Fig. 1a). 14-3-3γ and Dok-7 interacted better with CK2β than CK2α (Fig. 1a). Two of the AChR subunits (α and β) appeared to weakly interact with both CK2 subunits (Fig. 1a). Next, co-immunoprecipitations were implemented to verify protein/protein interactions between CK2β and Rapsyn, Rac1, 14-3-3γ, and Dok-7 (Fig. 1b). In fact, all these proteins interacted again with CK2β as well as with the previously known interactors MuSK and Dsh (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, we confirmed these interactions in a more physiological context by using GST fusion proteins of Rapsyn, Rac1, 14-3-3γ, and Dok-7 to pull down endogenous CK2β from hind limb muscle cell lysates of wild type mice (Fig. 1, c–f). To gain a better understanding of how CK2 interacts with Rapsyn, the epitope of Rapsyn that interacts with CK2β was mapped. Three mutants of Rapsyn were cloned, all of which carry differentially combined deletions of the RING domain, coiled coil motif, or only the amino-terminal domain until the end of TPR4 (Fig. 2a). The DNAs encoding these Rapsyn protein fragments were fused in-frame to GST, and recombinant fusion proteins were purified from bacteria and used for GST pulldown assays. The qualities of the purified GST-Rapsyn fusion proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2b). Rapsyn variants were able to pull down CK2β as long as they contained TPRs 5–7 (Fig. 2c). To further narrow the epitope of Rapsyn that interacts with CK2β, we generated additional Rapsyn mutants composed only of TPRs 5–7 or TPR6, respectively. Both Rapsyn fragments were able to interact with CK2β (Fig. 2d). We conclude that TPR6 of Rapsyn is sufficient to mediate interaction with CK2β. We next asked whether protein kinase CK2 phosphorylates Rapsyn. Increasing amounts of purified recombinant GST-Rapsyn fusion protein were incubated together with recombinant CK2 and subjected to a [γ-32P]ATP incorporation assay (Fig. 2, e–g). These experiments were done by applying catalytically active CK2α subunit or CK2 holoenzyme. In none of these experiments was CK2 able to phosphorylate the GST part of the fusion protein (Fig. 2f). Neither CK2α nor CK2 holoenzyme was able to phosphorylate any Rapsyn protein, not even by using high amounts of Rapsyn (Fig. 2, f and g). When CK2 holoenzyme was used, phosphorylation of both CK2α and CK2β subunits by CK2 itself was detected (Fig. 2g). Interestingly, we identified in silico (KinasePhos 2.0) serine 224 of Rapsyn within a strongly suitable phosphorylation motif for CK2 (Fig. 2a). Although we did not detect any Rapsyn phosphorylation by CK2 in vitro, we cannot rule out the possibility that CK2 phosphorylates Rapsyn in vivo. To this end, we investigated binding patterns of Rapsyn mutants with CK2β. In fact, a phosphomimetic Rapsyn mutant (Ser-224 to Asp) was able to pull down more CK2β than wild type Rapsyn protein (Fig. 2, h and i). By immunofluorescence studies, we confirmed co-localization of Rapsyn and CK2β at NMJs of hind limb gastrocnemius/soleus muscle of wild type mice (Fig. 2j). Altogether, protein kinase CK2 interacts with TPR6 epitope of Rapsyn but does not phosphorylate it in vitro. Next, the nature of the interaction between Rac1 and CK2 was characterized. Four Rac1 mutants were generated by different truncations of wild type Rac1 at its carboxyl-terminal end (Fig. 3a). The full-size Rac1 and its mutants were fused to GST, recombinantly expressed, and purified from bacteria. The qualities of the purified proteins were confirmed by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3b). Loss of the Switch I domain of Rac1 abolished its interaction with CK2β (Fig. 3c). Subsequently, we asked whether CK2 phosphorylates Rac1. To this end, increasing amounts of recombinant GST-Rac1 protein were incubated together with CK2α or the whole CK2 holoenzyme. The grade of purity of GST-Rac1 was verified by analyzing increasing protein amounts by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3d). Using in vitro phosphorylation assays, we failed to detect CK2 phosphorylation of any Rac1 (Fig. 3, e and f). Only CK2 subunits α and β were phosphorylated by CK2 itself (Fig. 3f). Finally, a perfect co-localization was detected between CK2β and Rac1 on frozen sections of wild type murine hind limb muscle by immunofluorescence staining (Fig. 3g). A number of carboxyl-terminal truncations of 14-3-3γ protein were generated, purified as recombinant proteins, quality-controlled by SDS-PAGE, and subjected to GST pulldown assays (Fig. 4, a–c). The carboxyl-terminal part of the 14-3-3γ protein, ranging from amino acid residues 166 to 210, was required for interaction with CK2β (Fig. 4c). In vitro phosphorylation experi"

Methods Human TGFBI cDNA with R124H mutation was used to make a transgenic mouse expressing human protein (TGFBIR124H mouse). Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) was performed to analyze TGFBIR124H expression. A total of 226 mice including 23 homozygotes, 106 heterozygotes and 97 wild-type mice were examined for phenotype. Affected mice were also examined by histology, immunohistochemistry and electron microcopy. Results RT-PCR confirmed the expression of TGFBIR124H in transgenic mice. Corneal opacity defined as granular and lattice deposits was observed in 45.0% of homozygotes, 19.4% of heterozygotes. The incidence of corneal opacity was significantly higher in homozygotes than in heterozygotes (p = 0.02). Histology of affected mice was similar to histology of human disease. Lesions were Congo red and Masson Trichrome positive, and were observed as a deposit of amorphous material by electron microscopy. Subepithelial stroma was also stained with thioflavin T and LC3, a marker of autophagy activation. The incidence of corneal opacity was higher in aged mice in each group. Homozygotes were not necessarily more severe than heterozygotes, which deffers from human cases. Conclusions We established a granular corneal dystrophy type 2 mouse model caused by R124H mutation of human TGFBI. Although the phenotype of this mouse model is not equivalent to that in humans, further studies using this model may help elucidate the pathophysiology of this disease."
https://openalex.org/W2264721366,"Pili are fibrous appendages expressed on the surface of a vast number of bacterial species, and their role in surface adhesion is important for processes such as infection, colonization, andbiofilm formation. The human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae expresses two different types of pili, PI-1 and PI-2, both of which require the concerted action of structural proteins and sortases for their polymerization. The type PI-1 streptococcal pilus is a complex, well studied structure, but the PI-2 type, present in a number of invasive pneumococcal serotypes, has to date remained less well understood. The PI-2 pilus consists of repeated units of a single protein, PitB, whose covalent association is catalyzed by cognate sortase SrtG-1 and partner protein SipA. Here we report the high resolution crystal structures of PitB and SrtG1 and use molecular modeling to visualize a “trapped” 1:1 complex between the two molecules. X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy reveal that the pneumococcal PI-2 backbone fiber is formed by PitB monomers associated in head-to-tail fashion and that short, flexible fibers can be formed even in the absence of coadjuvant proteins. These observations, obtained with a simple pilus biosynthetic system, are likely to be applicable to other fiber formation processes in a variety of Gram-positive organisms.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is a frequent colonizer of the human upper respiratory tract and is one of the main causative agents of pneumonia, meningitis, and septicemia (1Mehr S. Wood N. Streptococcus pneumoniae: a review of carriage, infection, serotype replacement, and vaccination.Paediatr. Respir. Rev. 2012; 13: 258-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Despite the development of multi-valent polysaccharide-based vaccines, pneumococcal infection still continues to be a worldwide problem, affecting mostly the elderly and the very young, notably in developing countries (2Bogaert D. Hermans P.W. Adrian P.V. Rümke H.C. de Groot R. Pneumococcal vaccines: an update on current strategies.Vaccine. 2004; 22: 2209-2220Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 3Feldman C. Anderson R. Recent advances in our understanding of Streptococcus pneumoniae infection.F1000Prime Rep. 2014; 6: 82Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). One of the key steps for infection initiation is adherence of pneumococci to eukaryotic surfaces, which is mostly achieved through the interaction between bacterial surface-exposed proteins and host carbohydrates in a lectin-like fashion or through the direct action of adhesins that recognize the extracellular matrix (4Izoré T. Contreras-Martel C. El Mortaji L. Manzano C. Terrasse R. Vernet T. Di Guilmi A.M. Dessen A.

Some adhesins have been shown to be located at the furthermost tip of pili, hair-like, proteinaceous surface structures that aid in bacterial adhesion to host molecules but also play key roles in biofilm formation and evasion from the immune system (7Chagnot C. Zorgani M.A. Astruc T. Desvaux M. Proteinaceous determinants of surface colonization in bacteria: bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation from a protein secretion perspective.Front. Microbiol. 2013; 4: 303Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The study of the molecular machineries from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens have revealed not only key differences in the mechanisms of pilus formation by the two different bacterial types (8Proft T. Baker E.N. Pili in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria: structure, assembly, and their role in disease.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2009; 66: 613-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (360) Google Scholar) but have also underscored the importance of the detailed comprehension of the pilus formation systems for the exploration of novel anti-adhesion strategies that could lead to the development of new antimicrobials. The pilus-forming building blocks (pilins) of Gram-positive bacterial species are covalently associated by dedicated sortases, cysteine transpeptidases whose genes are located within the same pathogenicity islet as the pilin-encoding genes. Pili have now been extensively studied in a number of organisms, including Corynebacterium, Enterococcus, and Streptococcus species (9Kang H.J. Baker E.N. Structure and assembly of Gram-positive bacterial pili: unique covalent polymers.Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2012; 22: 200-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Notably, genome sequencing studies revealed the existence of more than one pilus islet in many species (10Danne C. Dramsi S. Pili of Gram-positive bacteria: roles in host colonization.Res. Microbiol. 2012; 163: 645-658Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Specifically, S. pneumoniae carries two pilus-encoding pathogenicity islets, PI-1 and PI-2. PI-1, also known as the rlrA islet, spans a 14-kb region and encodes three pilins (RrgA, the adhesin; RrgB, the backbone; RrgC, the bridging element) and three class C sortases (4Izoré T.

The PI-2 islet encodes two pilins (PitA and PitB), two sortases (SrtG1 and SrtG2) and one signal peptidase-like protein (SipA) (18Zähner D. Gudlavalleti A. Stephens D.S. Increase in pilus islet 2-encoded pili among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, Atlanta, Georgia, USA.Emerg. Infect. Dis. 2010; 16: 955-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Notably, both PitA and SrtG2 are dispensable for PI-2 formation, indicating that PitB is the backbone pilin, and its covalent association is catalyzed by SrtG1 (19Bagnoli F. Moschioni M. Donati C.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5480-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The function of SipA is more controversial despite the fact that its homologs are present in pilus-related pathogenicity islets of a number of streptococcal species (Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus agalactiae) (20Zähner D. Gandhi A.R. Yi H. Stephens D.S. Mitis group streptococci express variable pilus islet 2 pili.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e25124 Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, it has been suggested to function as a chaperone for pilus polymerization (19Bagnoli F. Moschioni M. Donati C. Dimitrovska V. Ferlenghi I. Facciotti C. Muzzi A. Giusti F. Emolo C. Sinisi A.

Bacteriol. 2008; 190: 5480-5492Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), notably by associating with a partially unfolded pilin to facilitate folding and subsequent polymerization (21Young P.G. Proft T. Harris P.W. Brimble M.A. Baker E.N.

The catalytic mechanism of sortases as well as their structures and those of pilin molecules have been the object of much interest in the past few years. Sortases have been classified into four classes (A-D) based on their primary sequences and substrate recognition motif (22Dramsi S. Trieu-Cuot P. Bierne H. Sorting sortases: a nomenclature proposal for the various sortases of Gram-positive bacteria.Res. Microbiol. 2005; 156: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar). Their three-dimensional folds all display a central β-barrel motif, but they are involved in processes that range from iron uptake to pilus polymerization and covalent attachment of virulence factors to the bacterial cell wall (23Schneewind O. Missiakas D.M. Protein secretion and surface display in Gram-positive bacteria.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 2012; 367: 1123-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Most pilus-forming sortases (class C), in addition to the classic β-barrel, also carry “lid” sequences that cover the active site and could play a role in substrate recognition (24Manzano C. Contreras-Martel C. El Mortaji L. Izoré T. Fenel D. Vernet T. Schoehn G. Di Guilmi A.M. Dessen A.

A notable exception is the pilus-related sortase from Streptococcus pyogenes, which lacks a lid and was shown to be structurally similar to class B sortases (29Kang H.J. Coulibaly F. Proft T. Baker E.N. Crystal structure of Spy0129, a Streptococcus pyogenes class B Sortase involved in pilus assembly.PLoS ONE. 2011; 6e15969 Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which have been reported to be involved in anchoring virulence factors to the cell wall in the case of iron acquisition (22Dramsi S.

Microbiol. 2005; 156: 289-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar, 30Mazmanian S.K. Skaar E.P. Gaspar A.H. Humayun M. Gornicki P. Jelenska J. Joachmiak A. Missiakas D.M. Schneewind O. Passage of heme-iron across the envelope of Staphylococcus aureus.Science. 2003; 299: 906-909Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). Sortases recognize the cell wall sorting signal of a target protein, notably an LPXTG-like motif, and associate it to an amino group located on the cell surface. In the case of pilin substrates, the active site Cys residue of the sortase enzyme performs a nucleophilic attack on the link between Thr and Gly of the target motif, resulting in the formation of an amide bond joining the newly formed C-terminal Thr carboxylate to the ϵ-amino group of a Lys residue from the adjacent pilin subunit (31Ton-That H.

Thus, the identity of the surface-exposed Lys that is involved in covalent association between pilins is relevant for the understanding of the pilus formation process at a mechanistic level. On the other hand, the building blocks responsible for pilus formation have been reported to fold into independent domains associated to each other as beads on a necklace, which provides the necessary flexibility for pilus recognition of target surfaces (24Manzano C. Contreras-Martel C. El Mortaji L. Izoré T. Fenel D. Vernet T. Schoehn G. Di Guilmi A.M. Dessen A.

Stabilizing isopeptide bonds revealed in Gram-positive bacterial pilus structure.Science. 2007; 318: 1625-1628Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). One notable exception, however, is the adhesin RrgA, which displays interdependent domains, one of which mimics the eukaryotic VWA motif (4Izoré T. Contreras-Martel C. El Mortaji L. Manzano C.

Structural basis of host cell recognition by the pilus adhesin from Streptococcus pneumoniae.Structure. 2010; 18: 106-115Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, despite the advances in structural and functional characterization, a complete understanding of the association between sortases and pilins as well as pilins themselves in atomic detail is still lacking due to the complexity of the multiprotein pilus systems and the difficulty in “trapping” a complex between an active sortase and a pilin molecule. In this work we have solved the high resolution structures of PitB and SrtG1, the backbone pilin, and cognate sortase from the type II pilus (PI-2) of S. pneumoniae and used molecular docking to understand the first step before nucleophilic attack; that is, association of the target LPXTG motif onto the sortase recognition platform. In addition, we have also visualized the type II pilus fiber using x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy. This work thus allows a more complete comprehension of pilus biosynthesis in Gram-positive organisms in that it provides a snapshot of a key step of an essential reaction in atomic detail as well as insight into the mechanism of type II pilus formation. The pitB gene was amplified by PCR from S. pneumoniae clinical strain 19F Taiwan 14 (a gift from M. Barocchi, Novartis) using conventional PCR techniques. The amplified fragment was cloned into pET151 (Invitrogen) in-frame with an N-terminal His tag using a TOPO® cloning kit (Invitrogen), generating pET151-PitB. Subsequently, to perform phasing experiments, two methionine residues were incorporated into the sequence by site-specific mutagenesis. We thus generated mutants PitB-L242M/L307M, which were produced using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The mutated amino acids, Leu-242 and Leu-307, were selected based on a homology model built using MODELLER (36Webb B. Sali A. Protein structure modeling with MODELLER.Methods Mol. Biol. 2014; 1137: 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were transformed with pET151-PitB and grown in LB medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml) at 37 °C to an optical density value (A600 nm) of 0.6 absorbance units. Protein expression was triggered by the addition of 0.5 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Inalco), and cells were incubated for 4 h at 25 °C with shaking. Cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in buffer A (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and then disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged to remove cell debris (18,000 × g for 25 min) and loaded onto a 5-ml Ni2+ Chelating SepharoseTM column (GE Healthcare). After extensive washing using buffer A supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, PitB was eluted using a linear gradient from 80 to 300 mm imidazole. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against buffer A. The N-terminal His6 tag was removed by incubating the protein overnight with tobacco etch virus protease; uncleaved PitB and tobacco etch virus protease were removed by reloading the sample onto the Ni2+ column. PitB was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200TM 16/60 GL (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated in buffer A. Selenomethionylated PitB was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells in M9 minimal medium supplemented with thiamine (0.2 mg/ml). Thirty minutes before induction with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside, a solution of leucine (50 mg/ml), valine (50 mg/ml), isoleucine (50 mg/ml), lysine (100 mg/ml), phenylalanine (100 mg/ml), threonine (100 mg/ml), and selenomethionine (60 mg/ml) was added to the culture to inhibit the methionine biosynthesis pathway and to drive the incorporation of selenomethionine. Expression and purification of selenomethionylated PitB were performed as for the native protein; 1 mm DTT was added to the gel filtration buffer to prevent sample oxidation. Native PitB crystals were obtained at 20 °C by vapor diffusion using a 20 mg/ml protein stock solution and, as precipitant, a solution containing 3 m NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES, pH 7.0.

Crystals belonged to space group P43, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 54.21 Å and c = 361.41 Å.

Malcolm B.A. Two-stage PCR protocol allowing introduction of multiple mutations, deletions and insertions using QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis.BioTechniques. 1999; 26: 680-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (491) Google Scholar). Mutations were confirmed by sequencing. Four microliters of purified PitB at ∼0.05 mg/ml were adsorbed onto the clean face of a carbon film on a mica sheet (carbon/mica interface) and negatively stained with 2% (w/v) neutral sodium silicotungstate, pH 7.5. Micrographs were taken under low dose conditions with a Tecnai12 LaB6 electron microscope working at 120 kV and with nominal magnifications of 23,000× and 49,000× using a Gatan OriusTM SC1000 CCD camera. For experiments involving SrtG1 addition, purified PitB and SrtG1 were incubated at a molar ratio of 1:2. Four μl of this mix (leading to a final concentration of 0.05 mg/ml of PitB) were loaded onto grids and observed by negative staining electron microscopy as described above. The srtg1 gene was amplified by PCR from S. pneumoniae clinical strain 19F Taiwan 14. The amplified fragment (encompassing residues 46–260) was cloned into the pET151 vector (Invitrogen) in-frame with an N-terminal His tag using a TOPO® Cloning kit (Invitrogen), generating pET151-SrtG1. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells (Novagen) were transformed with pET151-SrtG1 and grown in LB media at 37 °C, supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). Protein expression was triggered by 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (Inalco) until the culture reached an optical density (A600) of 0.7. After a 4 h incubation at 28 °C, bacteria were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl) and then disrupted by sonication. The lysate was centrifuged to remove cell debris (18,000 × g for 25 min) and loaded onto a column containing 5 ml of Ni2+-charged Chelating SepharoseTM (GE Healthcare). After extensive washing using the lysis buffer supplemented with 20 mm imidazole, SrtG1 was eluted by a linear gradient from 80 to 300 mm imidazole. Fractions were pooled and dialyzed for 2 h at 4 °C against dialysis buffer (30 mm Tris pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). The His tag was removed by incubating the protein overnight with tobacco etch virus protease; uncleaved SrtG1 and tobacco etch virus protease were removed by reloading onto the Ni2+ column. SrtG1 was further purified by gel filtration using a Superdex 200TM 16/60 GL (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 30 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl. SrtG1 was concentrated to 25 mg/ml and used for crystallization tests.

Serum anti-ganglioside antibodies were measured in GBS patients and controls. Genome sequencing was used to determine the phylogenetic relationship among three C. jejuni strains from a patient with GBS (ICDCCJ07001), a patient with gastroenteritis (ICDCCJ07002) and a healthy carrier (ICDCCJ07004), which were all associated with the outbreak. The ganglioside-like structures of the lipo-oligosaccharides of these strains were determined by mass spectrometry. Seventeen (53%) of the GBS patients had anti-GT1a IgG antibodies. GT1a mimicry was found in the lipo-oligosaccharides of strain ICDCCJ07002 and ICDCCJ07004; but a combination of GM3/GD3 mimics was observed in ICDCCJ07001, although this patient had anti-GT1a IgG antibodies. A single-base deletion in a glycosyltransferase gene caused the absence of GT1a mimicry in ICDCCJ07001. The phylogenetic tree showed that ICDCCJ07002 and ICDCCJ07004 were genetically closer to each other than to ICDCCJ07001. C. jejuni, bearing a GT1a-like lipo-oligosaccharide, might have caused the GBS outbreak and the loss of GT1a mimicry may have helped ICDCCJ07001 to survive in the host."

Here, we investigate the effects of phosphorylation on the structure and nucleotide binding properties of NBD1. Phosphorylation sites in SUR2B NBD1 are located in an N-terminal tail that is disordered. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data indicate that phosphorylation of the N-terminal tail affects multiple residues in NBD1, including residues in the NBD2-binding site, and results in altered conformation and dynamics of NBD1.

Increased nucleotide binding of phosphorylated NBD1 and NBD1-ΔN, compared with non-phosphorylated NBD1, suggests that by disrupting the interaction of the NBD core with the N-terminal tail, phosphorylation also exposes the MgATP-binding site on NBD1.

https://openalex.org/W1792879434,"Developing countries often have rich natural resources but poor infrastructure to capitalize on them, which leads to significant challenges in terms of balancing poverty alleviation with conservation. The underlying premise in development strategies is to increase the socio-economic welfare of the people while simultaneously ensuring environmental sustainability, however these objectives are often in direct conflict. National progress is dependent on developing infrastructure such as effective transportation networks, however roads can be ecologically catastrophic in terms of disrupting habitat connectivity and facilitating illegal activity. How can national development and conservation be balanced? The proposed Serengeti road epitomizes the conflict between poverty alleviation on one hand, and the conservation of a critical ecosystem on the other. We use the Serengeti as an exemplar case-study in which the relative economic and social benefits of a road can be assessed against the ecological impacts. Specifically, we compare three possible transportation routes and ask which route maximizes the socio-economic returns for the people while minimizing the ecological costs. The findings suggest that one route in particular that circumnavigates the Serengeti links the greatest number of small and medium sized entrepreneurial businesses to the largest labour force in the region. Furthermore, this route connects the most children to schools, provisions the greatest access to hospitals, and opens the most fertile crop and livestock production areas, and does not compromise the ecology and tourism revenue of the Serengeti. This route would improve Tanzania's food security and self-reliance and would facilitate future infrastructure development which would not be possible if the road were to pass through the Serengeti. This case study provides a compelling example of how a detailed spatial analysis can balance the national objectives of poverty alleviation while maintaining ecological integrity."

There is considerable variation in active TB case finding preferences amongst HCWs of different gender, occupation, and testing history. Attention to heterogeneity in preferences should optimize screening utilization of target HCW populations."
https://openalex.org/W1554697669,Background Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the intermediate stage of the cognitive changes between normal aging and dementia. KLOTH is an age-related gene that may contribute to the risk of MCI. The aim of our study was to explore the association between KLOTHO promoter methylation and MCI in Xinjiang Uygur and Han populations. Methods DNA methylation assay was performed using the bisulphite pyrosequencing technology among 96 Uygur (48 MCI and 48 controls) and 96 Han (48 MCI and 48 controls) Chinese individuals from Xinjiang province of China. Results We found significant association between KLOTHO promoter methylation and MCI in the Han Chinese (CpG1: p = 3.77E-06; CpG2: p = 1.91E-07; CpG3: p = 5.83E-07; CpG4: p = 2.23E-05; CpG5: p = 3.03E-06) but not in the Uygur Chinese. Higher KLOTHO promoter methylation levels were found in Han MCI patients than Uygur MCI patients for all the five CpGs (adjusted p values by age < 0.02). Conclusion Our results showed that KLOTHO promoter hypermethylation contributed to the MCI risk in Xinjiang Han Chinese but not in Xinjiang Uygur Chinese. The population difference of KLOTHO methylation in the risk of MCI required further investigation in the future.
https://openalex.org/W988085359,"Seed dispersal by ants (myrmecochory) is found worldwide, but the benefits that plants obtain from this mutualism remain uncertain. In the present study, we conducted laboratory experiments to demonstrate seed predator avoidance as a benefit of myrmecochory using the annual ant-dispersed herb Lamium amplexicaule, the disperser ant Tetramorium tsushimae, and the seed predatory burrower bug Adomerus rotundus. We compared the predation intensity of Lamium amplexicaule seeds by Adomerus rotundus under the presence or absence of Tetramorium tsushimae. Both the number of seeds sucked by Adomerus rotundus adults and the feeding duration of sucked seeds by nymphs were significantly reduced in the presence of ants. This effect was most likely due to the behavioral alteration of Adomerus rotundus in response to the ant presence, because ants seldom predated Adomerus rotundus during the experiment. Our results demonstrated that the presence of ants decreases post-dispersal seed predation, even when the ants do not bury the seeds. The present study thus suggests that the non-consumptive effects of ants on seed predators benefit myrmecochorous plants."
https://openalex.org/W968737614,"The expansion of the agricultural frontier by the clearing of remnant forests has led to human-dominated landscape mosaics. Previous studies have evaluated the effect of these landscape mosaics on arthropod diversity at local spatial scales in temperate and tropical regions, but little is known about fragmentation effects in crop systems, such as the complex tropical traditional crop systems that maintain a high diversity of weeds and arthropods in low-Andean regions. To understand the factors that influence patterns of diversity in human-dominated landscapes, we investigate the effect of land use types on plant and arthropod diversity in traditionally managed cornfields, via surveys of plants and arthropods in twelve traditional cornfields in the Colombian Andes. We estimated alpha and beta diversity to analyze changes in diversity related to land uses within a radius of 100 m to 1 km around each cornfield. We observed that forests influenced alpha diversity of plants, but not of arthropods. Agricultural lands had a positive relationship with plants and herbivores, but a negative relationship with predators. Pastures positively influenced the diversity of plants and arthropods. In addition, forest cover seemed to influence changes in plant species composition and species turnover of herbivore communities among cornfields. The dominant plant species varied among fields, resulting in high differentiation of plant communities. Predator communities also exhibited high turnover among cornfields, but differences in composition arose mainly among rare species. The crop system evaluated in this study represents a widespread situation in the tropics, therefore, our results can be of broad significance. Our findings suggest that traditional agriculture may not homogenize biological communities, but instead could maintain the regional pool of species through high beta diversity."
https://openalex.org/W951397387,"The capacity of natural killer (NK) cells to mediate Fc receptor-dependent effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), largely contributes to their clinical application. Given that activation-induced C-type lectin (AICL), an identified ligand for the NK-activating receptor NKp80, is frequently highly expressed on leukemia cells, the lack of therapeutic AICL-specific antibodies limits clinical application. Here we explore a strategy to reinforce NK anti-leukemia reactivity by combining targeting AICL-expressing leukemia cells with the induction of NK cell ADCC using NKp80-Fc fusion proteins. The NKp80-Fc fusion protein we generated bound specifically to leukemia cells in an AICL-specific manner. Cell binding assays between NK and leukemia cells showed that NKp80-Fc significantly increased NK target cell conjugation. In functional analyses, treatment with NKp80-Fc clearly induced the ADCC effect of NK cells. NKp80-Fc not only promoted NK-mediated leukemia cell apoptosis in the early stage of cell conjugation but also enhanced NK cell degranulation and cytotoxicity activity in the late stage. The bifunctional NKp80-Fc could redirect NK cells toward leukemia cells and triggered NK cell killing in vitro. Moreover, NKp80-Fc enhanced the lysis of NK cells against tumors in leukemia xenograft non-obese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficiency mice. Taken together, our results demonstrate that NKp80-Fc potently amplifies NK cell anti-leukemia effects in vitro and in vivo through induction of the NK cell ADCC effect. This method could potentially be useful for molecular targeted therapy, and the fusion proteins may be a promising drug for immunotherapy of leukemia.

https://openalex.org/W978852152,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to utilize cholesterol as a carbon source, and this ability is linked to its virulence in macrophages and in the mouse model of infection. The M. tuberculosis cytochrome P450 Cyp125 plays a key role in cholesterol metabolism being involved in the first steps of its degradation. Cyp125 is a cholesterol hydroxylase which is essential for cholesterol catabolism in M. bovis BCG and some strains of M. tuberculosis. We generated an unmarked, in-frame deletion of Cyp125 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. The deletion strain was able to grow as well as wild-type in medium containing glucose as the carbon source. The Cyp125 deletion strain was more sensitive to growth inhibition by clotrimazole consistent with the ability of Cyp125 to bind azoles with high affinity. The deletion strain showed no difference in sensitivity to nitric oxide or hydrogen peroxide and was not attenuated for growth inside THP-1 human macrophage-like cells. These data suggest that the attenuation of virulence seen in operon deletion strains is not linked to the lack of Cyp125 alone."
https://openalex.org/W1631462271,"We aimed at unveiling patterns in live and dead manatee sightings in the Lower Sanaga Basin, Cameroon. For this purpose, the expert opinions of 133 local fishers were collected during in-person interviews, distilled using categorical data analysis, and checked against scientific literature. The five main results are as follows: manatees were sighted averagely once a week in lakes, rivers, and the coast & estuaries, mostly in group sizes of 2-3; the odds of sighting live manatees (respectively dead manatees) decreased (respectively increased) from inland lakes to estuaries and the coast, via rivers; manatee carcasses were reported in all habitats, albeit more frequently in rivers; a distribution map based on fishers' reports show two manatee concentration areas: Lake Ossa and the Malimba-Mbiako section of River Sanaga; the number of manatees was perceived as increasing despite incidental and directed catches. Thus, our findings corroborate earlier assessments of the Lower Sanaga Basin as being a major manatee conservation area. Additionally, from these results and the literature, we identified three hypotheses about local manatee persistence: deep pools such as lakes offer year round sanctuaries, not just dry-season refugia; seasonality of specific habitat variables determine manatee occurrence patterns; and local variability in habitat encroachment mediate the meta-population dynamics of manatee in the Lower Sanaga Basin. Finally, we examine the implications for data requirements in light of the small ecological scale at which the surveyed fishers ply their trade. Thus, consonant with the Malawi principles for the ecosystem approach to management (www.cbd.int/ecosystem), we recommend collecting data preferably at landscape scale, through a participatory monitoring program that fully integrates scientific and traditional knowledge systems. This program should include, amongst others, a standardised necropsy protocol for collecting mortality and biological data together with sonar and radio-telemetry technology to discern manatee use and movements between critical habitat components."
https://openalex.org/W1609559573,"Pose estimation aims at measuring the position and orientation of a calibrated camera using known image features. The pinhole model is the dominant camera model in this field. However, the imaging precision of this model is not accurate enough for an advanced pose estimation algorithm. In this paper, a new camera model, called incident ray tracking model, is introduced. More importantly, an advanced pose estimation algorithm based on the perspective ray in the new camera model, is proposed. The perspective ray, determined by two positioning points, is an abstract mathematical equivalent of the incident ray. In the proposed pose estimation algorithm, called perspective-ray-based scaled orthographic projection with iteration (PRSOI), an approximate ray-based projection is calculated by a linear system and refined by iteration. Experiments on the PRSOI have been conducted, and the results demonstrate that it is of high accuracy in the six degrees of freedom (DOF) motion. And it outperforms three other state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of accuracy during the contrast experiment."
https://openalex.org/W1958949129,"Substance P is endogenously released in the adult lamprey spinal cord and accelerates the burst frequency of fictive locomotion. This is achieved by multiple effects on interneurons and motoneurons, including an attenuation of calcium currents, potentiation of NMDA currents and reduction of the reciprocal inhibition. While substance P also depolarizes spinal cord neurons, the underlying mechanism has not been resolved. Here we show that effects of substance P on background K+ channels are the main source for this depolarization. Hyperpolarizing steps induced inward currents during whole-cell voltage clamp that were reduced by substance P. These background K+ channels are pH sensitive and are selectively blocked by anandamide and AVE1231. These blockers counteracted the effect of substance P on these channels and the resting membrane potential depolarization in spinal cord neurons. Thus, we have shown now that substance P inhibits background K+ channels that in turn induce depolarization, which is likely to contribute to the frequency increase observed with substance P during fictive locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W993272437,"Both sodium chloride and sodium sulfate are able to stabilize yeast frataxin, causing an overall increase of its thermodynamic stability curve, with a decrease in the cold denaturation temperature and an increase in the hot denaturation one. The influence of low concentrations of these two salts on yeast frataxin stability can be assessed by the application of a theoretical model based on scaled particle theory. First developed to figure out the mechanism underlying cold denaturation in water, this model is able to predict the stabilization of globular proteins provided by these two salts. The densities of the salt solutions and their temperature dependence play a fundamental role."
https://openalex.org/W1948820177,"To determine the relationship between the subventricular zone (SVZ) and astrocytoma based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and whether SVZ involvement can be used to distinguish solitary cerebral metastases (SCMs) from astrocytomas.This retrospective study involved 154 patients with solitary low-grade astrocytoma (LGA), high-grade astrocytoma (HGA), and SCM, who underwent T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), Gd-DTPA-enhanced T1WI, and T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) or fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) T2WI. The spatial relationship between the tumor and SVZ was classified as ""involvement"" or ""segregation"" on contrast-enhanced T1WI for enhanced tumors and T2WI/FLAIR T2WI for non-enhanced tumors. Patient-based SVZ-contact rates were compared between the LGA, HGA, and SCM groups. The frequencies of involvement of various lateral ventricle regions by astrocytoma were compared. The correlation between SVZ involvement and tumor necrosis was analyzed.Patient-based SVZ-contact rates in SCM, LGA, and HGA were 24.1%, 68.8%, and 85.4%, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that the SVZ-contact rate was significantly different between SCM and astrocytoma (24.1% vs. 75.2% P < 0.001), also between LGA and HGA (68.1% vs. 85.4% P=0.037). After the tumor volume was adjusted as a covariate, SVZ-contact rates still differed between SCMs and astrocytomas (Odds ratio [OR]: 4.58, 95% Confidence interval [CI]: 1.65 to 12.8, P=0.004). Tumor volume differed between LGA and HGA (P< 0.001), and influenced the association between SVZ involvement and astrocytoma grade (P = 0.05). Among the lateral ventricle regions, the frontal horn was the most frequently involved by astrocytomas. SVZ-contact rates were higher in necrosis group compared with non-necrosis groups (83.9% vs. 50.0%, P < 0.001) among astrocytoma patients. Necrosis positively correlated with SVZ involvement in astrocytomas (rs = 0.342, P < 0.001), but did not correlate with SVZ involvement in SCMs (P = 0.193).Compared to SCMs, solitary cerebral astrocytomas exhibited spatial proximity to the SVZ, which might distinguish the supratentorial astrocytomas from SCMs."
