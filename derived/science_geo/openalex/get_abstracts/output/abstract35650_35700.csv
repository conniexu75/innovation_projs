https://openalex.org/W2029323550,"The response of the human circadian pacemaker to light was measured in 45 resetting trials. Each trial consisted of an initial endogenous circadian phase assessment, a three-cycle stimulus which included 5 hours of bright light per cycle, and a final phase assessment. The stimulus induced strong (type 0) resetting, with responses highly dependent on the initial circadian phase of light exposure. The magnitude and direction of the phase shifts were modulated by the timing of exposure to ordinary room light, previously thought to be undetectable by the human pacemaker. The data indicate that the sensitivity of the human circadian pacemaker to light is far greater than previously recognized and have important implications for the therapeutic use of light in the management of disorders of circadian regulation."

https://openalex.org/W2001793234,"The scaling of bone and muscle geometry in mammals suggests that peak stresses (ratio of force to cross-sectional area) acting in these two support elements increase with increasing body size. Observations of stresses acting in the limb bones of different sized mammals during strenuous activity, however, indicate that peak bone stress is independent of size (maintaining a safety factor of between 2 and 4). It appears that similar peak bone stresses and muscle stresses in large and small mammals are achieved primarily by a size-dependent change in locomotor limb posture: small animals run with crouched postures, whereas larger species run more upright. By adopting an upright posture, large animals align their limbs more closely with the ground reaction force, substantially reducing the forces that their muscles must exert (proportional to body mass) and hence, the forces that their bones must resist, to counteract joint moments. This change in limb posture to maintain locomotor stresses within safe limits, however, likely limits the maneuverability and accelerative capability of large animals."

Abdominal body temperatures of ground squirrels hibernating in outdoor burrows were recorded with temperature-sensitive radiotransmitter implants. Body temperatures and soil temperatures at hibernaculum depth reached average minima during February of -1.9 degrees and -6 degrees C, respectively. Laboratory-housed ground squirrels hibernating in ambient temperatures of -4.3 degrees C maintained above 0 degree C thoracic temperatures but decreased colonic temperatures to as low as -1.3 degrees C. Plasma sampled from animals with below 0 degree C body temperatures had normal solute concentrations and showed no evidence of containing antifreeze molecules."
https://openalex.org/W2031985285,"By in situ hybridization analysis and immunoprecipitations following transfection of COS cells, we show that the Rev protein of the human immunodeficiency virus is necessary for envelope protein expression, which is correlated with the appearance in the cytoplasm of envelope-specific RNA. In the absence of cotransfection with a plasmid expressing Rev, envelope-specific RNA is retained in the nucleus. Several cis-acting sites in the envelope are involved, one of which is between nucleotides 7330 and 7735 and is required for the response to Rev. Other sequences (nucleotides 5797-7330 and 7735-7989) are involved in the apparent retention of the envelope-specific RNA in the nucleus in the absence of Rev and its response element. Because Rev affects the localization of envelope RNA both in the presence and in the absence of the normal splice sites on the RNA, the mechanism of Rev action is independent of splicing."

https://openalex.org/W1982224993,The possibility of using the vascular endothelial cell as a target for gene replacement therapy was explored. Recombinant retroviruses were used to transduce the lacZ gene into endothelial cells harvested from mongrel dogs. Prosthetic vascular grafts seeded with the genetically modified cells were implanted as carotid interposition grafts into the dogs from which the original cells were harvested. Analysis of the graft 5 weeks after implantation revealed genetically modified endothelial cells lining the luminal surface of the graft. This technology could be used in the treatment of atherosclerosis disease and the design of new drug delivery systems.
https://openalex.org/W2037404178,"Deletion mutants of the rabbit progesterone receptor were used to identify two major mechanisms of its nuclear localization. A putative signal sequence, homologous to that of the SV40 large T antigen, was localized around amino acids 638-642 and shown to be constitutively active. When amino acids 638-642 were deleted, the receptor became cytoplasmic but could be shifted into the nucleus by the addition of hormone (or anti-hormone); it was almost fully active. The second mechanism consisted of the activation of the DNA binding domain. By deleting epitopes recognized by monoclonal antibodies, it was possible to follow different receptor mutants inside the same cells. In the absence of ligand, the receptor was transferred into the nucleus as a monomer. After administration of hormone (or anti-hormone) a ""cytoplasmic"" monomer was transferred into the nucleus through interaction with a ""nuclear"" monomer. These interactions occurred through the steroid binding domains of both monomers."

https://openalex.org/W1988399537,"The mammalian hippocampal formation appears to play a major role in the generation of internal representations of spatial relationships. In rats, this role is reflected in the spatially selective discharge of hippocampal pyramidal cells. The principal metric for coding spatial relationships might be the organism's own movements in space, that is, the spatial relationship between two locations is coded in terms of the movements executed in getting from one to the other. Thus, information from the motor programming systems (or ""motor set"") may contribute to coding of spatial location by hippocampal neurons. Spatially selective discharge of hippocampal neurons was abolished under conditions of restraint in which the animal had learned that locomotion was impossible. Therefore, hippocampal neuronal activity may reflect the association of movements with their spatial consequences."
https://openalex.org/W2157906742,"Mouse endothelioma cells expressing the polyoma middle T oncogene induced hemangiomas in a variety of species such as mice, rats, chicks, and quails. In embryos and newborn mice the hemangiomas expanded within 10â€“18 hr of injection, disrupting the vasculature and causing the death of the animal. In contrast, the hemangiomas formed a stable structure reminiscent of benign human hemangiomas in adult mice within 5 days. Analysis of the cells comprising the hemangioma revealed that over 95% of the endothelial cells were host derived. No induction of host cell proliferation was detected, and no endothelial mitogens were secreted by the endothelioma cells in vitro. The maintenance of the hemangioma appeared to require the continuous presence of endothelioma cells. The results indicate that these endothelioma cells act as a potent stimulating agent in the rapid formation of hemangiomas by recruiting nonproliferating host endothelial cells."

https://openalex.org/W2154675484,"The lin-12 gene of C. elegans encodes a predicted transmembrane protein that controls a decision by two cells, Z1.ppp and Z4.aaa, between the anchor cell (AC) and ventral uterine precursor cell (VU) fates. We performed laser ablation experiments to demonstrate that specification of the VU fate of Z1.ppp or Z4.aaa depends on an ""AC-to-VU"" signal from the presumptive AC. We generated genetic mosaics in which defined cells lacked lin-12 activity. By correlating the fates of Z1.ppp and Z4.aaa with the lin-12 genotype of nearly every cell in these mosaics, we conclude that lin-12 function is VU cell autonomous. We present a model in which lin-12 functions in the receiving mechanism for the ""AC-to-VU"" signal leading to the specification of the AC and VU fates of Z1.ppp and Z4.aaa."

https://openalex.org/W2020768312,"Information relevant to the folding and unfolding of alpha helices has been extracted from an analysis of protein structures. The alpha helices in protein crystal structures have been found to be hydrated, either externally by a water molecule hydrogen bonding to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom, or internally by inserting into the helix hydrogen bond and forming a hydrogen-bonded bridge between the backbone carbonyl oxygen and the amide nitrogen atoms. The water-inserted alpha-helical segments display a variety of reverse-turn conformations, such as type III, type II, type I, and opened out, that can be considered as folding intermediates that are trapped in the folding-unfolding process of alpha helices. Since the alpha helix, most turns, and the extended beta strand occupy contiguous regions in the conformational space of phi, psi dihedral angles, a plausible pathway can be proposed for the folding-unfolding process of alpha helices in aqueous solution."
https://openalex.org/W2024789985,"A neuron that is an integral member of the pyloric neural network of the lobster stomatogastric nervous system leaves this network and instead fires exclusively with another stomatogastric nervous system network, the cardiac sac network, whenever the cardiac sac network is active. This switch is associated with the neuron losing, in a long-lasting fashion, regenerative oscillatory membrane properties that underlie its participation in the pyloric network. Functional membership of neurons in central networks is thus not fixed, and long-lasting neuromodulatory influences, controlled at least in part by sensory inputs, can switch neurons from one network to another."
https://openalex.org/W2068757102,"The robustness of five common food web properties is examined by varying the resolution of the data through aggregation of trophic groupings. A surprising constancy in each of these properties is revealed as webs are collapsed down to approximately half their original size. This analysis of 60 invertebrate-dominated community food webs confirms the existence of all but one of these properties in such webs and addresses a common concern held by critics of food web theory that observed food web properties may be sensitive to trophic aggregation. The food web statistics (chain length; predator/prey ratio; fraction of top, intermediate, and bottom species; and rigid circuits) are scaling in the sense that they remain roughly invariant over a wide range of data resolution. As such, within present standards of reporting food web data, these statistics may be used to compare systems whose trophic data are resolved differently within a factor of 2."

In the present experiments, lean hamsters were more susceptible to starvation-induced anestrus than fat hamsters. However, anestrus was not caused by changes in any dimension of body size per se, but instead by the availability of metabolic fuels. Simultaneous pharmacological blockade of both fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis inhibited reproduction, but, as long as one of these metabolic pathways could be used, estrous cycles continued. Thus, reproduction in female Syrian hamsters is sensitive to the general availability of oxidizable metabolic fuels."
https://openalex.org/W2094208472,"In the adult, the peptide hormone angiotensin II (AII) is primarily known as a regulator of circulatory homeostasis, but recent evidence also suggests a role in cell growth. This study of AII in late gestation rat fetuses revealed the unexpected presence of receptors in skeletal muscle and connective tissue, in addition to those in recognized adult target tissues. The AII receptors in this novel location decreased by 80 percent 1 day after birth and were almost undetectable in the adult. Studies in fetal skin fibroblasts showed that the receptors were coupled to phospholipid breakdown, with concomitant increases in inositol phosphate and cytosolic calcium. The abundance, timing of expression, and unique localization of functional AII receptors in the fetus suggest a role for AII in fetal development."

https://openalex.org/W1480703691,"We have investigated the level of early DNA repair synthesis in nucleosome subpopulations, varying in histone acetylation, from normal human fibroblasts treated with sodium butyrate. We find that repair synthesis occurring during the first 30 min after UV irradiation is significantly enhanced in hyperacetylated mononucleosomes. Nucleosomes with an average of 2.3 acetyl residues/H4 molecule contained approximately 1.8-fold more repair synthesis than nucleosomes with an average of 1.5 or 1.0 acetyl residues/H4 molecule. Fractionation of highly acetylated nucleosomes by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis yielded an additional 2.0-fold enrichment of repair synthesis in nucleosomes containing 2.7 acetyl residues/H4 molecule as compared to nucleosomes containing 1.9 acetyl residues/H4 molecule. This enhanced repair synthesis is associated primarily with nucleosome core regions and does not appear to result from increased UV damage in hyperacetylated chromatin. In addition, the distribution of repair synthesis within nucleosome core DNA from hyperacetylated chromatin is nonrandom, showing a bias toward the 5' end which is similar to that obtained for bulk (unfractionated) chromatin. These results provide strong evidence that enhanced repair occurs within nucleosome cores of hyperacetylated chromatin in butyrate-treated human cells. Finally, pulse-chase experiments demonstrate that the association of enhanced repair synthesis with hyperacetylated nucleosomes is transient, lasting only about 12 h after UV damage."

https://openalex.org/W1504110485,"We have demonstrated that hepatic very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) secretion requires active phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis via either the CDP-choline pathway or phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) methylation pathway (Yao, Z., and Vance, D.E. (1988) J. Biol. Chem. 263, 2998-3004). In the present work, the head group specificity of phospholipid synthesis required for lipoprotein secretion was investigated in cultured hepatocytes isolated from choline-deficient rats. When N-monomethylethanolamine (0.1 mM) or N,N-dimethylethanolamine (0.1 mM) was added to the culture medium, the cells synthesized correspondingly phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine (PMME) or phosphatidyldimethylethanolamine (PDME). However, the synthesis of PDME could correct the impaired VLDL secretion only to a limited extent, whereas the synthesis of PMME inhibited VLDL secretion. Although dimethylethanolamine did not promote VLDL secretion as well as choline, dimethylethanolamine altered the increased triacylglycerol synthesis in the choline-deficient cells as effectively as choline. Supplementation of the culture medium with ethanolamine (0.1 mM) had little effect on cellular PE or PC levels, nor was normal VLDL secretion resumed. However, the amounts of cellular PC and PE were both decreased when the medium was supplemented with N-monomethylethanolamine or N,N-dimethylethanolamine. These results suggest that the choline head group moiety of PC is specifically required for normal VLDL secretion and cannot be replaced with ethanolamine, monomethylethanolamine, or dimethylethanolamine. In addition, the impaired VLDL secretion from the choline-deficient hepatocytes could also be corrected by supplementation of betaine (0.2 mM) and homocysteine (0.2 mM), indicating the utilization of a methyl group from betaine for PC formation via methylation of PE."
https://openalex.org/W2012698052,"ALTHOUGH glucocorticoids and progestins control vastly different physiological processes, the receptors mediating the effects of these hormones interact with the same DNA sequences1â€“4. Transfer experiments involving synthetic genes5 and in vitro binding studies6 have shown that progesterone and glucocorticoid receptors both recognize the same 15-base pair DNA element (TGTACAGGATGTTCT), raising the question of how the two steroids affect gene expression selectively. We considered the possibility that their selectivity arises from either the differential expression of the receptors in target cells or the differential dependence of receptor function on additional transcription factors. To test these alternatives we introduced a progesterone-receptor expression pi asm id into the rat hepatoma cell line Fto2B-3 which contains glucocorticoid receptor but is devoid of progesterone receptor. We report that expression of the progesterone receptor in Fto2B-3 cells renders endogenous glucocorticoid-regulated genes inducible by progestins. Our data show that the responsive-ness of a cell to external stimuli can be reprogrammed by the expression of a single transcription factor and that differential expression of hormone receptors is at least one mechanism by which steroid-specific gene activation is achieved."
https://openalex.org/W1493639935,"We have described previously a gene transfer system for the isolation of human DNA sequences that determine expression of a mammalian GDP-fucose: beta-D-galactoside-2-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase (alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase) (Ernst, L. K., Rajan, V. P., Larsen, R. D., Ruff, M. M., and Lowe, J. B. (1989) J. Biol. Chem. 264, 3436-3447). With this system, we found that de novo expression of the fucosyltransferase in mouse recipient cells was associated with the transfer and stable genomic integration of characteristic human DNA restriction fragments. We report here the results of experiments designed to determine the genetic origin of the fucosyltransferase determined by these sequences. First, we characterize the fucosyltransferases found in these mouse transfectants and in the human cell line used as a DNA donor. We compare their properties to those displayed by the human H and Secretor blood group fucosyltransferases. We find that the enzymes in the transfected cells have properties similar or identical to those of the human H alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase. However, their properties differ significantly from the properties of the human Secretor alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase and are also distinct from the properties of a murine alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase. To confirm further that these transfected human sequences determine the H phenotype of the transfectants, we cloned the two human EcoRI restriction fragments common to each H-expressing secondary transfectant. The larger of these two fragments directs de novo expression of an alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase when transfected into COS-1 cells. The pH activity profile of this alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase and its apparent Michaelis constants for substrate and acceptor mirror those we determined for the human H alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase. We conclude that genetic information sufficient to determine expression of this alpha-(1,2)-fucosyltransferase resides within the 3.4-kilobase pair human EcoRI restriction fragment and that this most likely represents the human H blood group locus."

A notable change in one aspect of this background, number of siblings, is occurring as fertility is becoming extremely low. Examination of the negative relation between individuals' sibling number and years of schooling indicates that education among those with many siblings is disproportionately cut short before high school graduation. Because there is a strong negative relation between number of siblings and scores on tests measuring verbal ability, recent reductions in sibling number would be expected to contribute to enhanced verbal ability and increasing years of schooling for those born now in the United States."
https://openalex.org/W1606503313,"To investigate the origin of stomach expression of lysozyme in ruminants; we surveyed clones from a cow stomach cDNA library with a lysozyme cDNA probe. Ten percent of the clones in this library were lysozyme-specific. Thirty of the lysozyme clones were sequenced, and seven types of lysozyme mRNA sequence were found. They encode the three previously identified stomach isozymes of lysozyme. The seven sequences are closely related to one another and represent the products of a minimum of 4 of the approximately 10 cow lysozyme genes detected by genomic blotting. The most abundant form of stomach lysozyme (form 2) is encoded by at least two genes, whereas forms 1 and 3 are possibly each encoded by only one gene. The number of genes encoding each isozyme appears to contribute the largest factor in the relative abundance of each isozyme. The multiple lysozyme genes expressed in the cow stomach are the result of gene duplications that occurred during ruminant evolution. The recruitment of lysozyme as a major enzyme in the stomach may thus have involved an early regulatory event and a later 4-7-fold increase in expression allowed by gene amplification. During this period, the amino acid sequences of these lysozymes have been evolving more slowly than those of nonruminant lysozymes."
https://openalex.org/W2093675852,"Transcriptionally active extracts were prepared from chick red cells isolated at different stages of development. The template activity of cloned beta-globin genes is highest in extracts from definitive red cells, where the endogenous gene is normally expressed, and lowest in extracts from primitive red cells or nonerythroid tissues. This system has been used to identify regulatory elements and to assign functions to the proteins that bind within the beta-globin promoter. Regulation of expression is achieved, in part, by factors whose composition changes during red cell development. Two proteins, PAL and CON, bind at adjacent sites but have opposite effects on transcription in vitro. Levels of PAL, a potent repressor, are highest in mature red cells while those of CON, an activator, are highest in actively transcribing red cells. The effect of PAL can be overcome by blocking its binding site with a protein having a similar recognition sequence but a dissimilar function."

https://openalex.org/W47592222,"Abstract The major antifreeze polypeptide (AFP) from winter flounder (37 amino acid residues) is a single alpha-helix. Aspartic acid and arginine are found, respectively, at the amino and carboxyl-termini. These charged amino acids are ideally located for stabilizing the alpha-helical conformation of this AFP by means of charge-dipole interaction (Shoemaker, K. R., Kim, P.S., York, E.J., Stewart, J. M., and Baldwin, R. L. (1987) Nature 326, 563-567). In order to understand these and other molecular interactions that maintain the AFP structure, we have carried out the chemical synthesis of AFP analogs and evaluated their conformations by circular dichroism spectroscopy. We synthesized the entire AFP molecule (37-mer) and six COOH-terminal peptide fragments (36-, 33-, 27-, 26-, 16-, and 15-mers). Peptides containing acidic NH2-terminal residues displayed greater helix formation and thermal stability compared to those peptides of similar size, but with neutral NH2-terminal residues. Helix formation was maximum above pH 9.2. The peptide conformations also displayed a pH-dependent sensitivity to changes in ionic strength. Helix formation was reduced in the presence of acetonitrile. We conclude that the AFP helix is most likely stabilized by: charge-dipole interactions between charged terminal amino acids and the helix dipole, a charge interaction between Lys18 and Glu22 (either a salt bridge or a hydrogen bond), and hydrophobic interactions."
https://openalex.org/W1602088802,"The mechanisms by which triiodothyronine (T3) regulates gene transcription are inadequately understood. In order to examine the effect of T3 on transcriptional mechanisms, we utilized several techniques to characterize trans-acting factors which interact with cis-regulatory elements of the promoter for the T3-responsive rat malic enzyme gene. Transcription of deletion mutants of the promoter by HeLa extracts revealed the existence of three cis-regulatory elements at âˆ’144 to âˆ’123, âˆ’70 to âˆ’50, and âˆ’30 to +5 (relative to the cap site at +1). DNase I footprinting disclosed the presence of proteins which bound to each of these regions. Gel mobility shift assays showed that specific binding of liver nuclear proteins to two of these regions (âˆ’144/âˆ’114 and âˆ’76/âˆ’47) was diminished in hypothyroid and elevated in hyperthyroid rats. Similar but less marked effects of T3 on the binding of kidney (a T3-responsive tissue) nuclear proteins to the âˆ’76/âˆ’47 and cap site regions were observed while binding of testis (a T3-nonresponsive tissue) nuclear proteins was unaffected by T3 treatment. Changes in the magnitude and time course of binding of liver proteins to this promoter correlated closely with previously documented T3-induced increases in the hepatic malic enzyme gene transcription rate. These results are consistent with a model in which the regulation of malic enzyme gene transcription by T3 in responsive tissues is mediated in part by hormone-induced increases in the binding of trans-acting factors to cis-regulatory elements."
https://openalex.org/W1489938702,"Abstract We have identified and functionally characterized DNA sequences that are required for the inducible and cell-restricted expression of the murine alpha 4-interferon gene. Hybrid plasmids in which the alpha 4 promoter region or its 5' deletions were inserted upstream of the CAT gene were constructed, and the expression of these hybrid genes was studied in mouse L-cells both in permanent and transient assays with comparable results. Inducible expression was not affected by deletions up to -109; however, when the deletion was extended to -96, inducibility by Newcastle disease virus was abolished; however, this hybrid plasmid was expressed constitutively. Further deletion to -88 did not permit either constitutive or inducible expression. Insertion of the 35-base pair-long sequence (-109 to -75 base pairs) from the alpha 4 promoter region 5' of the minimal alpha 4 or human immunodeficiency virus promoter region, conferred inducibility to these two inactive promoters. The 5' deleted hybrids or plasmids containing the inducible element were induced only at low levels in transfected NIH/3T3 cells that do not express endogenous alpha 4 gene efficiently, indicating that the inducible region also determines the cell-specific expression. A tandem repeat of AGTGAA, which is present in the -109 to -88 region of alpha 4 in two copies, showed both basal levels of expression and inducibility in L-cells, while its analogue AATGAA was highly inducible but was not expressed constitutively. The inducibility of the synthetic hexamer repeats did not show cell type-restricted expression, suggesting that their response does not fully reflect the range of expression observed for the inducible region and the endogenous alpha genes."
https://openalex.org/W1484971872,"Abstract An N-acylaminoacyl-peptide hydrolase has been purified to homogeneity (7,000-fold with 20% yield) from rabbit muscle. This overall enrichment and its general properties as a soluble protein suggest that it is of cytosolic origin and not a component of ribosomes or other cellular organelles. The enzyme has an Mr of 230,000-245,000 and a subunit Mr of 76,000-80,000. An extensive survey of the substrate specificity of the pure enzyme reveals that our earlier conclusions (Radhakrishna, G., and Wold, F. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 9572-9575) that the enzyme is specific for Ac-Met-peptides are wrong. The enzyme catalyzes the rapid removal of Ac-Thr, Ac-Ala, Ac-Met, Ac-Ser, and more slowly Ac-Gly from peptides of different lengths. Other acetylated amino acids (Cys, Tyr, Asp, Val, Phe, Ile, Leu) may be removed at 1% or less of the rate of the above good substrates from some peptide substrates. The nature of the amino acid in the second position of the acetylated peptide generally has only a minor effect on the reaction rate; however, with charged amino acids (Arg, Asp) in the second position the reaction is retarded, and with proline it is virtually abolished. Except for slow rate of hydrolysis of acetylated dipeptides, the hydrolase does not appear to be severely affected by the peptide length in the range studied (from 2 to 11 amino acid residues). The hydrolase also cleaves formylamino acids from formylated peptides. The biological function of the enzyme is not clear."
https://openalex.org/W1572955037,"Abstract Membrane transport pathways for transplacental transfer of CO2/HCO3 were investigated by assessing the possible presence of a Cl/HCO3 exchange mechanism in the maternal-facing membrane of human placental epithelial cells. Cl/HCO3 exchange was tested for in preparations of purified brush border membrane vesicles by 36Cl tracer flux measurements and determinations of acridine orange fluorescence changes. Under 10% CO2/90% N2 the imposition of an outwardly directed HCO3- concentration gradient (pHo 6/pHi 7.5) stimulated Cl- uptake to levels approximately 2-fold greater than observed at equilibrium. Maneuvers designed to offset the development of ion gradient-induced diffusion potentials (valinomycin, Ko = Ki) significantly reduced HCO3- gradient-driven Cl- uptake but concentrative accumulation of Cl- persisted. Early time point determinations performed in the presumed absence of membrane potential suggests the reduced level of HCO3- gradient-driven Cl- uptake resulted from a more rapid dissipation of the HCO3- concentration gradient. Concentrative accumulation of Cl- was not observed in the presence of a pH gradient alone under 100% N2, suggesting a preference of HCO3- over OH- as a substrate for transport. As monitored by acridine orange fluorescence the Cl- gradient-dependent collapse of an imposed pH gradient (pHo 8.5/pHi 6) was accelerated in the presence of CO2/HCO3 when compared with its absence, indicating coupling of HCO3- influx to Cl- efflux. Increasing concentrations of the anion exchange inhibitor 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid were observed to cause a stepwise reduction in HCO3- gradient-driven Cl- uptake (I50 approximately 25 microM) further suggesting the presence of a Cl/HCO3 exchange mechanism. The results of this study provide evidence for a 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive Cl/HCO3 exchange mechanism in the maternal-facing membrane of human placental epithelial cells. The identification of an ion-coupled HCO3- transport pathway in placental epithelia may suggest functional roles in mediating transplacental transfer of CO2 as well as maintenance of fetal acid/base balance."
https://openalex.org/W1614579638,"Abstract Genes for the various isoactins define two classes of actin. Class I actin genes code for Met-Asp(Glu)-actin, and class II actin genes code for Met-X-Asp(Glu)-actin where X is usually cysteine. Amino termini of both are removed in an acetylation-dependent processing reaction yielding acetyl-Asp(Glu)-actin. Both classes are processed at approximately equal rate (t1/2 = 15 min) in vivo. In vitro, class II actins are 90% processed by endogenous enzymes after 60 min in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system, whereas class I actins are only minimally processed during this period. Using site-directed mutagenesis of a human skeletal muscle isoactin coupled with in vitro transcription and translation methods, we have synthesized a pseudo-class I actin in which the penultimate cysteine has been changed to an aspartic acid, thus placing a class I amino terminus on an otherwise class II actin molecule. The pseudo-class I actin was less than 20% processed during the translation period as determined by peptide mapping. It was further processed by exogenous processing enzyme at a rate compatible with a class I actin. These results indicate that the major actin determinant controlling differential actin-processing rates is the amino-terminal residue being cleaved, not the remaining structure of the actin molecule. We have also demonstrated for the first time that N-acetylmethionine is the immediately released product from the amino terminus of a pseudo-class I actin during processing."

https://openalex.org/W1649603085,"The oxygen isotope effect at the substrate O2 on the oxygenase reaction of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase from spinach is pH and metal dependent. The pH dependence between pH 7.4 and 8.9 is different with Mg2+ (steady decrease in this isotope effect from 1.036 to 1.030) and Mn2+ (minimum isotope effect of 1.028 at pH 8.0). Deuteration of the substrate ([3-2H]ribulose bisphosphate) has no influence on the isotope effect. The results are interpreted as a direct participation of the metal ion in the oxygen-sensitive step, i.e. carbon-oxygen bond formation and the stabilization of the intermediates. In the overall reaction oxygen addition is a major rate-limiting step, and the observed isotope effect is probably close to the intrinsic oxygen isotope effect of the reaction. The basic mechanisms for carboxylation and oxygenation of ribulose bisphosphate appear to be the same."
https://openalex.org/W1601379212,"Abstract The binding between complementary polymerization sites of fibrin monomers plays an essential role in the formation of the fibrin clot. One set of polymerization sites involved in the interaction of fibrin monomers is believed to pre-exist in fibrinogen, while the complementary set of binding sites is exposed after the cleavage of fibrinopeptides from fibrinogen. The polymerization sites present in fibrinogen and its derivatives mediate their binding to fibrin. Although the binding of fibrinogen and its derivatives to fibrin have been qualitatively studied, there has been no systematic, quantitative investigation of their interaction with forming or preformed clots. In the present study, the binding of fibrinogen and fragments DD, D1, and E1 was measured using a sonicated suspension of plasminogen- and thrombin-free human cross-linked fibrin as a model of a preformed clot. Dissociation constants of 0.056, 0.19, and 2.44 microM, and the number of binding sites corresponding to 0.10, 0.21, and 0.13/fibrin monomer unit of fibrin polymer were found for fibrinogen, fragment DD, and fragment D1, respectively. Fragment E1 did not bind to sonicated noncross-linked or cross-linked fibrin suspensions. However, it was bound to forming fibrin clots as well as to fibrin-Celite, suggesting that the binding sites on fibrin involved in the interaction with fragment E1 may have been altered upon sonication. Affinity chromatography of various fibrinogen derivatives on a fibrin-Celite column showed that only part of the bound fragment DD was displaced by arginine, whereas fragments D1 and E1 were completely eluted under the same conditions. The results indicate that interaction of fibrinogen with the preformed fibrin clots is characterized by affinity in the nanomolar range and that binding between fibrin monomers, in the process of clot formation, could be characterized by even a higher affinity."
