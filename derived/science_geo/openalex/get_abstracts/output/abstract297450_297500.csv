https://openalex.org/W2092811313,"Axius serratus, a crustacean thought to be extremely rare, was discovered in large numbers in polluted regions of the Strait of Canso. The shrimp may live deeper than 3 meters in the sediment; burrows are kept open to at least 2.5 meters. Sediment contained in old filled burrows is anomalous in its distribution of particle size and its content of water, organic carbon, and trace elements. These anomalous qualitites affect the geotechnical properties of sediments on the sea floor."
https://openalex.org/W2081734322,"Recently discovered Paleogene land vertebrates from the Eureka Sound Formation at about latitude 78 degrees north in Arctic Canada include fish, turtles, an alligatorid, and several taxa of mammals. The assemblage, which is probably early or middle Eocene in age, adds to previously known paleobotanical evidence in suggesting temperate to warm-temperate climatic conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2067609352,"Seismic reflection profiles and the structure of sediments in box cores from Ontong-Java Plateau indicate large-scale land sliding and sediment flow processes, respectively. The topographic morphology of sliding and slumping is depth- dependent, suggesting control by dissolution processes."

https://openalex.org/W1967275333,"If there is indeed an effect of the variable sun on the weather, the physical cause for it remains quite elusive (12). We should keep in mind the possibility that there may be several causes and several effects. The situation may change through the 11-year sunspot cycle and the 22-year solar magnetic cycle, as well as on longer time scales. Work is proceeding at a lively pace at the institutions mentioned in this article and at many others around the world. The Soviet Union has long had considerably more workers interested in this field than has any other country. A bilateral agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States has considerably increased the interactions between workers interested in this subject, including an exchange of extended visits between the two countries. A detailed knowledge of solar causes of geomagnetic activity is only now beginning to emerge after many years of scientific efforts. This suggests that a possible successful solution to the sun-weather problem will require a similar magnitude of effort. We look forward with interest and optimism to the results of the next few years."
