https://openalex.org/W2124850594,"Amplicon sequencing has been the method of choice in many high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) applications. To date there has been a heavy focus on the means by which to analyse the burgeoning amount of data afforded by HTS. In contrast, there has been a distinct lack of attention paid to considerations surrounding the importance of sample preparation and the fidelity of library generation. No amount of high-end bioinformatics can compensate for poorly prepared samples and it is therefore imperative that careful attention is given to sample preparation and library generation within workflows, especially those involving multiple PCR steps. This paper redresses this imbalance by focusing on aspects pertaining to the benchtop within typical amplicon workflows: sample screening, the target region, and library generation. Empirical data is provided to illustrate the scope of the problem. Lastly, the impact of various data analysis parameters is also investigated in the context of how the data was initially generated. It is hoped this paper may serve to highlight the importance of pre-analysis workflows in achieving meaningful, future-proof data that can be analysed appropriately. As amplicon sequencing gains traction in a variety of diagnostic applications from forensics to environmental DNA (eDNA) it is paramount workflows and analytics are both fit for purpose."
https://openalex.org/W2064953814,"Objective Though most patients wish to discuss end-of-life (EOL) issues, doctors are reluctant to conduct end-of-life conversations. Little is known about the barriers doctors face in conducting effective EOL conversations with diverse patients. This mixed methods study was undertaken to empirically identify barriers faced by doctors (if any) in conducting effective EOL conversations with diverse patients and to determine if the doctors’ age, gender, ethnicity and medical sub-specialty influenced the barriers reported. Design Mixed-methods study of multi-specialty doctors caring for diverse, seriously ill patients in two large academic medical centers at the end of the training; data were collected from 2010 to 2012. Outcomes Doctor-reported barriers to EOL conversations with diverse patients. Results 1040 of 1234 potential subjects (84.3%) participated. 29 participants were designated as the development cohort for coding and grounded theory analyses to identify primary barriers. The codes were validated by analyses of responses from 50 randomly drawn subjects from the validation cohort (n= 996 doctors). Qualitative responses from the validation cohort were coded and analyzed using quantitative methods. Only 0.01 % doctors reported no barriers to conducting EOL conversations with patients. 99.99% doctors reported barriers with 85.7% finding it very challenging to conduct EOL conversations with all patients and especially so with patients whose ethnicity was different than their own. Asian-American doctors reported the most struggles (91.3%), followed by African Americans (85.3%), Caucasians (83.5%) and Hispanic Americans (79.3%) in conducting EOL conversations with their patients. The biggest doctor-reported barriers to effective EOL conversations are (i) language and medical interpretation issues, (ii) patient/family religio-spiritual beliefs about death and dying, (iii) doctors’ ignorance of patients’ cultural beliefs, values and practices, (iv) patient/family's cultural differences in truth handling and decision making, (v) patients’ limited health literacy and (vi) patients’ mistrust of doctors and the health care system. The doctors' ethnicity (Chi-Square = 12.77, DF = 4, p = 0.0125) and medical subspecialty (Chi-Square = 19.33, DF = 10, p =0.036) influenced their reported barriers. Friedman’s test used to examine participants relative ranking of the barriers across sub-groups identified significant differences by age group (F statistic = 303.5, DF = 5, p < 0.0001) and medical sub-specialty (F statistic =163.7, DF = 5, p < 0.0001). Conclusions and Relevance Doctors report struggles with conducting effective EOL conversations with all patients and especially with those whose ethnicity is different from their own. It is vital to identify strategies to mitigate barriers doctors encounter in conducting effective EOL conversations with seriously ill patients and their families."
https://openalex.org/W1975578701,"Purpose Programmed Death-1 (PD-1) and its ligand, PD-L1, are regulators of immune/ inflammatory mechanisms. We explored the potential involvement of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in the inflammatory response and tissue damage in cardiac injury models. Experimental Design Ischemic-reperfused and cryoinjured hearts were processed for flow cytometry and immunohistochemical studies for determination of cardiac PD-1 and PD-L1 in the context of assessment of the growth arrest- and DNA damage-inducible protein 153 (GADD153) which regulates both inflammation and cell death. Further, we explored the potential ability of injured cardiac cells to influence proliferation of T lymphocytes. Results The isolated ischemic-reperfused hearts displayed marked increases in expression of PD-1 and PD-L1 in cardiomyocytes; however, immunofluorescent studies indicate that PD-1 and PD-L1 are not primarily co-expressed on the same cardiomyocytes. Upregulation of PD-1/PD-L1 was associated with a) marked increases in GADD153 and interleukin (IL)-17 but a mild increase in IL-10 and b) disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (ψm) as well as apoptotic and necrotic cell death. Importantly, while isotype matching treatment did not affect the aforementioned changes, treatment with the PD-L1 blocking antibody reversed those effects in association with marked cardioprotection. Further, ischemic-reperfused cardiac cells reduced proliferation of T lymphocytes, an effect partially reversed by PD-L1 antibody. Subsequent studies using the cryoinjury model of myocardial infarction revealed significant increases in PD-1, PD-L1, GADD153 and IL-17 positive cells in association with significant apoptosis/necrosis. Conclusions The data suggest that upregulation of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway in cardiac injury models mediates tissue damage likely through a paracrine mechanism. Importantly, inhibition of T cell proliferation by ischemic-reperfused cardiac cells is consistent with the negative immunoregulatory role of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, likely reflecting an endogenous cardiac mechanism to curtail the deleterious impact of infiltrating immune cells to the damaged myocardium. The balance of these countervailing effects determines the extent of cardiac injury."
https://openalex.org/W1995205576,"Objective The problems and needs of advanced cancer patients and proxies normally increase as the disease progresses. Home-based advanced cancer patients and their proxies benefit from collaborations between primary care physicians and hospital-based palliative care specialists when confronted with complex problems in the last phase of life. Telemedicine might facilitate direct, patient-centered communication between patients and proxies, primary care physicians, and specialist palliative care teams (SPCTs). This study focuses on the impact of teleconsultation technologies on the relationships between home-based palliative care patients and hospital-based palliative care specialists. Methods This work consists of a qualitative study among patients, family members, and caregivers that utilizes long-term direct observations, semi-structured interviews, and open interviews following the observations. Results The analysis of the empirical data resulted in three key concepts that describe the impact of teleconsultation on the patient-professional relationship in palliative homecare: transcending the institutional walls of home and hospital; transparency of teleconsultation technology; and technologized, intimate patient-professional relationships. Teleconsultation offers (1) condensed encounters between home-based palliative care patients and distant professionals, (2) a unique insight into the patients’ daily lives for palliative care specialists, and (3) long-term interaction that results in trustful relationships and experiences of intimacy and relief. Conclusions Teleconsultation fits the practice of home-based palliative care. Teleconsultation can, if well applied, facilitate computer-mediated but empathic patient-palliative care specialist relationships, which enable professional care attuned to the patient’s context as well as patient involvement. This article proposes a teleconsultation implementation guide for optimal use of teleconsultation in daily palliative care practice."

Here, we have demonstrated that intraplantar injections of low dose STZ evoked acute polymodal hypersensitivities in mice. These hypersensitivities were inhibited by a TRPA1 antagonist and were absent in TRPA1-null mice. In wild type mice, systemic STZ treatment (180 mg/kg) evoked a loss of cold and mechanical sensitivity within an hour of injection, which lasted for at least 10 days. In contrast, Trpa1−/− mice developed mechanical, cold, and heat hypersensitivity 24 h after STZ. The TRPA1-dependent sensory loss produced by STZ occurs before the onset of diabetes and may thus not be readily distinguished from the similar sensory abnormalities produced by the ensuing diabetic neuropathy. In vitro, STZ activated TRPA1 in isolated sensory neurons, TRPA1 cell lines, and membrane patches. Mass spectrometry studies revealed that STZ oxidizes TRPA1 cysteines to disulfides and sulfenic acids. Furthermore, incubation of tyrosine with STZ resulted in formation of dityrosine, suggesting formation of peroxynitrite. Functional analysis of TRPA1 mutants showed that cysteine residues that were oxidized by STZ were important for TRPA1 responsiveness to STZ. Our results have identified oxidation of TRPA1 cysteine residues, most likely by peroxynitrite, as a novel mechanism of action of STZ. Direct stimulation of TRPA1 complicates the interpretation of results from STZ models of diabetic sensory neuropathy and strongly argues that more refined models of diabetic neuropathy should replace the use of STZ.

Sensory neuropathy is one of the most common and serious long term complications of diabetes, and the prevalence of diabetic neuropathy is rising with the global increase in type 2 diabetes (1.Edwards J.L.

Mechanisms of diabetic complications.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93: 137-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (1506) Google Scholar). Pain and loss of sensation are major symptoms associated with diabetic neuropathy and constitute an immense burden to patients and society (1.Edwards J.L. Vincent A.M. Cheng H.T. Feldman E.L.

Diabetic neuropathy: cellular mechanisms as therapeutic targets.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2011; 7: 573-583Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Pain is an early manifestation of neuropathy in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients, with about half of patients experiencing pain particularly during the early stages when they suffer from a range of symptoms, including burning and shooting pains and aches initially in the distal limbs (4.Dworkin R.H. O'Connor A.B. Backonja M. Farrar J.T. Finnerup N.B. Jensen T.S. Kalso E.A. Loeser J.D. Miaskowski C. Nurmikko T.J. Portenoy R.K. Rice A.S. Stacey B.R. Treede R.D. Turk D.C. Wallace M.S.

Although loss of sensitivity is the most common manifestation of sensory neuropathy, some patients also experience hypersensitivities to mechanical (pressure and light touch) and thermal (cold/heat) stimuli. In rodent studies of STZ-induced diabetic neuropathy, rats typically display mechanical and thermal hyperalgesia, whereas mice develop mechanical and thermal hypoalgesia (5.Obrosova I.G. Diabetic painful and insensate neuropathy: pathogenesis and potential treatments.Neurotherapeutics. 2009; 6: 638-647Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy and pain has hampered the development of mechanism-based therapies. The major current treatments target the management of pain with anti-convulsant, anti-depressant, and opioid drugs that often have limited efficacy or unacceptable side effects (4.Dworkin R.H.

The ion channel TRPA1 is expressed in a subset of nociceptive sensory neurons where it acts as a promiscuous receptor for oxidants and electrophilic agents, but it is also activated by a number of nonreactive compounds (6.Zygmunt P.M. Högestätt E.D. Trpa1. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2014; 222: 583-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Covalent modification of cysteine residues present in the intracellular N terminus of TRPA1 is thought to underlie the agonist activity of oxidants and electrophilic agonists (7.Hinman A. Chuang H.H.

Noxious compounds activate TRPA1 ion channels through covalent modification of cysteines.Nature. 2007; 445: 541-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). Several inflammatory mediators and transmitters sensitize or activate TRPA1 indirectly through G-protein-coupled receptors (9.Dai Y. Wang S. Tominaga M. Yamamoto S. Fukuoka T. Higashi T. Kobayashi K.

Here, we have examined the sensory effects of topical and systemic STZ treatment before the onset of diabetes and the development of diabetic neuropathy. We noticed that topical STZ produced a rapid proalgesic effect, whereas systemic administration of STZ evoked a loss of mechanical and cold sensitivity within an hour of injection. We have identified TRPA1 as the target for the pronociceptive actions of STZ. Using TRPA1-expressing cell lines and cultured sensory neurons, we demonstrate that STZ stimulates TRPA1 directly. Finally, we show that STZ decomposition generates peroxynitrite, which oxidizes TRPA1 cysteine residues found in the TRPA1 N terminus, in good agreement with our current understanding of how oxidants and electrophilic compounds activate TRPA1. Animal studies were performed according to the UK Home Office Animal Procedures Act (1986) after in-house ethical review. C57BL/6J mice were obtained from Harlan UK Ltd., and Trpa1−/− mice were bred from heterozygous mice kindly provided by Drs. Kelvin Kwan and David Corey (Harvard Medical School, Boston) (20.Kwan K.Y. Allchorne A.J. Vollrath M.A. Christensen A.P. Zhang D.S. Woolf C.J. Corey D.P. TRPA1 contributes to cold, mechanical, and chemical nociception but is not essential for hair-cell transduction.Neuron. 2006; 50: 277-289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). The mice were backcrossed onto the C57Bl/6J background for 10 generations prior to this set of experiments. The TRPA1 antagonist AP18 was prepared in PBS containing 1% DMSO and 0.5% Tween 80 and administered by either intraperitoneal (2.5 mg/kg in 0.3 ml) or intraplantar (5 μg in 25 μl) injections. STZ stock solutions were prepared in 0.1 mm citric acid (pH 4.5) and adjusted to pH 7.4 (NaHCO3) just before administration. STZ was administered by intraplantar (1–100 μg in 25 μl) or intraperitoneal (180 mg/kg in 0.2 ml) injections. Blood glucose levels were monitored using a Contour XT blood glucose meter (Bayer Healthcare). Before nociceptive testing, the mice were kept in their holding cages to acclimatize (10–15 min) to the experimental room. Thermal sensitivity was assessed using a commercially available hot and cold plate (Ugo Basile, Milan, Italy), by placing a hind paw of a lightly restrained mouse onto the plate surface and measuring the latency to paw withdrawal as described previously (21.Gentry C. Stoakley N. Andersson D.A. Bevan S. The roles of iPLA2, TRPM8 and TRPA1 in chemically induced cold hypersensitivity.Mol. Pain. 2010; 6: 4Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Paw withdrawal latencies were determined with the plate set at a chosen temperature (50 °C for hot plate and 10 °C for cold plate tests). Mechanical sensitivity was assessed by measuring paw withdrawal thresholds to an increasing mechanical force applied to the dorsal surface of the paw using an Analgesymeter (Ugo-Basile). The nociceptive threshold was defined as the force in grams at which the mouse withdrew its paw. To avoid tissue injury, the maximum force applied was set to 150 g. DRG neurons were prepared from adult male or female Trpa1+/+ and Trpa1−/− C57Bl/6J mice using methods described previously (22.Bevan S. Winter J. Nerve growth factor (NGF) differentially regulates the chemosensitivity of adult rat cultured sensory neurons.J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 4918-4926Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated neurons were plated on poly-d-lysine-coated coverslips and maintained at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 in MEM AQ (containing 5.6 mm glucose, Sigma, Poole, UK) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 50 ng/ml NGF (Promega, Southampton, UK) and used for experimentation within 48 h. Untransfected CHO cells and CHO cells expressing mouse TRPA1 were grown in MEM AQ supplemented with penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), FCS (10%), and hygromycin (200 μg/ml). TRPA1 expression was under the control of a tetracycline-inducible promoter, and expression was induced by addition of tetracycline before experimentation (23.Story G.M. Peier A.M. Reeve A.J.

HEK 293t cells were transfected with plasmids of hTRPA1 or mutant hTRPA1 (1 μg each) using Nanofectin (PAA, Pasching, Austria). 24 h after transfection, cells were plated onto poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips and used for calcium imaging experiments the same day. Human TRPA1 cDNA and cDNA of a mutant hTRPA1 lacking cysteine residues with or without lysine 710 in the intracellular domain (C621S/C641S/C665S±K710R) were the kind gift from Dr. Sven-Eric Jordt (Department of Pharmacology, Yale University, New Haven, CT). For some experiments, HEK 293t cells stably expressing hTRPA1 were used. CHO, HEK 293t cells, and DRG neurons were loaded with 2.5–3 μm Fura-2 AM in the presence (CHO and DRG) or absence (HEK 293t) of 1 mm probenecid for ∼45–60 min in a physiological saline solution containing (in millimolars) either 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 glucose, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, and 1 MgCl2, buffered to pH 7.4 (NaOH) or NaCl 145, KCl 5, CaCl2 1.25, MgCl2 1, glucose 10, HEPES 10. Images of groups of cells were captured every 1 or 2 s at 340 and 380 nm excitation wavelengths with emission measured at >520 nm with a microscope-based imaging system (either PTI, New Jersey, or Visitron Systems GmbH, Puchheim, Germany). Analyses of emission intensity ratios at 340/380 nm excitation (R, in individual cells) were performed with ImageMaster or VisiView 2.1.1 software. In experiments on HEK cells, the background fluorescence was subtracted before calculation of ratios; cells were stimulated with 250 μm carvacrol to functionally identify transfected cells, and 5 μm ionomycin was applied as a control at the end of each experiment. Averaged results are reported as means (± S.E.) of area under the curve (Δ ratio F340/380 nm). CHO cells and DRG neurons were studied under voltage clamp conditions using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and pClamp 10.0 software (Axon Instruments). Borosilicate glass pipettes (3–6 megohms, 75–80% series resistance compensation) were filled with (in millimolars) 140 KCl (CHO cells) or CsCl (DRG neurons), 1 CaCl2, 2 MgATP, 10 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with KOH or CsOH as appropriate). The physiological saline solution detailed for the Ca2+ measurements above was used extracellularly. Cells studied under Ca2+-free conditions were superfused with (in millimolars) 140 NaCl, 5KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4, NaOH), and the pipettes were filled with 140 KCl, 2 MgATP, 5 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, KOH). Inside-out patches were recorded with (in millimolars) 140 NaCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, NaOH) in the pipette. The intracellular face of the patch was superfused with (in millimolars) 140 KCl, 2 MgATP, 1 EGTA, and 10 HEPES (pH 7.4, KOH). Streptozotocin was diluted as late as possible, usually after a giga-seal had been established. HEK 293t cells were recorded using an EPC10 HEKA amplifier (HEKA Elektronik, Lamprecht, Germany). Pipettes were filled with (in millimolars) KCl 140, MgCl2 2, EGTA 5, HEPES 10 (pH 7.4 with KOH), and the external solution contained (in millimolars) NaCl 140, KCl 5, MgCl2 2, CaCl2 2, HEPES 10, and glucose 10 (pH 7.4 with tetramethylammonium hydroxide). A model peptide of the intracellular N-terminal sequence of hTRPA1 comprising amino acids 607–670 (UniProt database, O75762; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Schwerte, Germany) was synthesized. Ultra high resolution ESI-TOF mass spectrometry was performed on a maXis mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) on 50 μm peptide in 20 mm ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) that was treated with 500 μm STZ for 75 min. Additionally, one set of samples was incubated with STZ and 1 mm dimedone for 75 min. After the treatment, samples were incubated with iodoacetamide (45 min at 50 °C), mixed with acetonitrile (1:1, v/v), and 0.1% formic acid and sprayed directly into the ion source. The instrumental parameters were as follows: injection rate 180 μl/h; source temperature 320 °C; capillary voltage 4.5 kV; and collision voltage 10 kV. All experiments were carried out in the positive ion mode, and the obtained spectra were deconvoluted and further processed in data analysis software provided by Bruker Daltonics. For the time-resolved MS, STZ was added to 20 mm ammonium carbonate buffer (pH 7.4), and the spectra were continuously monitored during 45 min. The effect of STZ on cysteine oxidation was assessed by Ellman's reaction, whereas the effects on dihydrorhodamine oxidation and dityrosine formation were studied by following the characteristic emission wavelengths, as described previously (24.Filipović M.R. Stanić D. Raicević S. Spasić M. Niketić V. Consequences of MnSOD interactions with nitric oxide: nitric oxide dismutation and the generation of peroxynitrite and hydrogen peroxide.Free Rad.

Ganglia from two animals were pooled together and lysed in N-ethylmaleimide-containing buffer, and TRPA1 was purified by immunoprecipitation (25.Eberhardt M. Dux M. Namer B. Miljkovic J. Cordasic N.

The samples were run on gradient gels, and the band was visualized by using a ChemiDocTM MP System (Bio-Rad). Fura-2 AM was from Life Technologies, Inc., and dissolved in DMSO with 10% pluronic acid (Life Technologies, Inc.). MnTM-PyP-CL5 was provided by M. R. Filipovic. AP18 was from Maybridge (Tintagel, Cornwall, UK) and HC030031 from TOSLab (Ekaterinburg, Russia). Streptozotocin, salts, and all other reagents were from Sigma. STZ stock solutions were prepared in 0.1 mm citrate (pH 4.5) and adjusted to pH 7.4 just before administration. AP18 was dissolved in 1% DMSO, 0.5% Tween 80, in 0.9% saline for behavioral experiments and in DMSO for cellular assays. Differences in cellular and behavioral response amplitudes, thresholds, and latencies were analyzed by Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or analysis of variance followed by Tukey's HSD test. We initially performed a dose-response experiment with intraplantar (i.pl.) injections of STZ (1–100 μg in 25 μl) in C57Bl/6J mice to determine whether STZ exerts a local effect on sensory function in vivo. The sensitivities to mechanical (paw pressure test) and cold stimulation (cold plate) were monitored for 24 h after injections to establish the time course of any effects. Intraplantar STZ rapidly exerted a pronociceptive effect and reduced the mechanical withdrawal threshold significantly at each examined dose, whereas vehicle administration was without effect (Fig. 1A). The mechanical hypersensitivity was evident within 30 min of administration and showed no sign of reversal within 6 h, but after 24 h, the paw withdrawal thresholds had returned to the naive, preinjection levels. STZ (1–100 μg, i.pl.) produced a similar but less pronounced reduction in the paw-withdrawal latency in the cold plate test, with a somewhat delayed onset compared with the mechanical hypersensitivity (Fig. 1B). TRPA1 mediates cellular and behavioral responses to stimulation with a number of oxidants and electrophilic chemicals (20.Kwan K.Y. Allchorne A.J. Vollrath M.A. Christensen A.P. Zhang D.S. Woolf C.J.

To determine whether TRPA1 was responsible for the pronociceptive effect of STZ, we examined the effect of the selective TRPA1 antagonist AP18 (12.Petrus M. Peier A.M. Bandell M. Hwang S.W. Huynh T. Olney N. Jegla T. Patapoutian A. A role of TRPA1 in mechanical hyperalgesia is revealed by pharmacological inhibition.Mol. Pain. 2007; 3: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Intraperitoneal injections of AP18 (2.5 mg/kg, 5 h after 1 μg i.pl. STZ) completely inhibited the STZ-induced reduction in paw withdrawal threshold (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, i.pl. co-injection of AP18 (5 μg) together with STZ (1 μg) prevented the development of mechanical hyperalgesia for at least 3 h, demonstrating that AP18 and STZ act locally in the paw (Fig. 1D). At later time points when AP18 is likely to have been cleared from the tissue (12.Petrus M. Peier A.M. Bandell M. Hwang S.W. Huynh T. Olney N. Jegla T. Patapoutian A. A role of TRPA1 in mechanical hyperalgesia is revealed by pharmacological inhibition.Mol. Pain. 2007; 3: 40Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar), mechanical hyperalgesia developed to a similar level to that observed in the vehicle-treated STZ group. We next examined the effect of i.pl. injections of STZ (1 μg) in Trpa1+/+ and Trpa1−/− mice. STZ produced the expected pronounced mechanical hyperalgesia in wild type mice (Fig. 1E). In contrast, STZ was without any effect on the paw withdrawal threshold in Trpa1−/− mice, suggesting an obligatory role for TRPA1 in the acute STZ-evoked hyperalgesia (Fig. 1E), consistent with the inhibitory effects of AP18 noted above. TRPA1 is primarily expressed in TRPV1-positive, heat-sensitive nociceptive neurons, but it is not involved in the transduction of heat, either in vivo or in vitro. Nevertheless, TRPA1 activation in vivo elicits thermal hyperalgesia (26.Bautista D.M. Jordt S.E. Nikai T. Tsuruda P.R. Read A.J. Poblete J. Yamoah E.N. Basbaum A.I. Julius D.

SSBs also directly interact with many different genome maintenance proteins to stimulate their enzymatic activities and/or mediate their proper cellular localization. We have identified an interaction formed between Escherichia coli SSB and ribonuclease HI (RNase HI), an enzyme that hydrolyzes RNA in RNA/DNA hybrids. The RNase HI·SSB complex forms by RNase HI binding the intrinsically disordered C terminus of SSB (SSB-Ct), a mode of interaction that is shared among all SSB interaction partners examined to date. Residues that comprise the SSB-Ct binding site are conserved among bacterial RNase HI enzymes, suggesting that RNase HI·SSB complexes are present in many bacterial species and that retaining the interaction is important for its cellular function. A steady-state kinetic analysis shows that interaction with SSB stimulates RNase HI activity by lowering the reaction Km. SSB or RNase HI protein variants that disrupt complex formation nullify this effect.

Significance: Formation of the RNase HI·SSB complex could be important for RNase HI-mediated removal of RNA/DNA hybrids that threaten genome stability. RNA/DNA hybrids are essential nucleic acid structures that are formed during cellular DNA replication and transcription reactions. In replication, the RNA components of RNA/DNA hybrids serve as primers from which replicative polymerases extend DNA chains (1.Kornberg A. Baker T.A. DNA Replication.2nd Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York1992: 275-283Google Scholar). Thousands of such RNA primers must be made and degraded during each round of genome replication in Escherichia coli (2.Hingorani M.M. O'Donnell M. Higgins N.P. The Bacterial Chromosome. ASM Press, Washington, D. C2005: 193-216Google Scholar). In transcription, RNA polymerase forms RNA/DNA hybrids as it synthesizes RNA using single-stranded (ss) 2The abbreviations used are: sssingle-strandedSSBssDNA-binding proteinSSB-CtSSB C terminusTAPtandem affinity purificationITCisothermal titration calorimetryNTAP-SSBN-terminally TAP-tagged SSBHSQCheteronuclear single quantum coherenceIBHQIowa Black Hole Quencher.

These hybrids are normally transient and occluded within the RNA polymerase active site. However, accumulating evidence suggests that the 5′ portions of nascent RNAs that have exited RNA polymerase can invade homologous duplex DNA, thereby displacing non-template ssDNA and generating hybrid structures called R-loops (4.Maduike N.Z.

Using proteomic, structural, and biochemical approaches we have identified a complex formed between E. coli RNase HI and SSB. RNase HI co-purifies with affinity-tagged SSB expressed in E. coli, and the two proteins directly interact with one another in vitro. The RNase HI/SSB interaction is similar to other SSB protein complexes both in terms of the stability of the complex and its reliance on the SSB-Ct sequence. Structural analyses of E. coli RNase HI bound to a peptide comprising the SSB-Ct sequence reveal a conserved interface that mediates complex formation. Steady-state kinetic analysis of the effects of SSB on RNase HI activity show that interaction with SSB increases wild-type RNase HI catalytic efficiency through a 10-fold reduction in the enzyme Km. Consistent with RNase HI·SSB complex formation being required for enzymatic stimulation, SSB or RNase HI variants that have lost the ability to interact with one another do not maintain the enhanced activity observed with the wild-type complex. Taken together, these data demonstrate that E. coli RNase HI and SSB directly interact to form a complex that confers heightened nuclease activity. The E. coli ssb open reading frame was amplified by PCR and subcloned into pBS1761 (N-terminal TAP tag vector) (45.Puig O. Caspary F. Rigaut G. Rutz B. Bouveret E. Bragado-Nilsson E. Wilm M.

To produce an inducible expression vector, the N-terminally TAP-tagged SSB (NTAP-SSB) was then subcloned into pET28b (pNTAP-SSB). pNTAP-SSB was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells and grown at 37 °C in lysogeny broth (LB) (46.Sambrook J.

At midlog phase (A600 nm ∼ 0.6), 1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to induce RNase HI overexpression, and growth was continued for 3.5 h. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 2 mm PMSF, 2 mm benzamidine) with the addition of 1× protease inhibitor tablet (Roche Applied Science) and then lysed by sonication on ice. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation (30 min at 34,500 × g), and solid ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to 0.45 g/ml on ice over 15 min. Samples were centrifuged, and pelleted material was resuspended in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm DTT and dialyzed against Buffer A (20 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 6.8, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) at 4 °C. The dialyzed sample was loaded onto a HiPrep Heparin Fast Flow column (GE Healthcare), and a gradient from 0 to 100% Buffer B (20 mm HEPES-HCl, pH 6.8, 750 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol) was used to elute RNase HI at ∼0.6 m NaCl. RNase HI-enriched fractions were pooled, dialyzed against Buffer A at 4 °C, and loaded onto an SP-Sepharose Fast Flow ion exchange column (GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted with a gradient from 0.02 to 0.6 m NaCl. Fractions containing RNase HI were pooled and further purified through a Sephacryl S-100 size exclusion column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in Buffer B. Pure RNase HI fractions were pooled, dialyzed against storage buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50% (v/v) glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT), and stored at −20 °C. Purification of the RNase HI* variant in which the three natural Cys residues are replaced with Ala used in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments was performed as described previously (49.Dabora J.M.

E. coli RNase HI (or variants), SSB, SSB-113, and SSBΔF were dialyzed at 25 °C against 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and brought to a final concentration of ∼30 μm for RNase HI and 550 μm (monomers) for SSB, SSB-113, and SSBΔF. Titrations were performed at 25 °C using a MicroCalTM VP-ITC (GE Healthcare) as follows. SSB was titrated (1 × 1-μl, 4 × 4-μl, and 28 × 8-μl injections) in a thermostated sample cell containing RNase HI. Data were fit to a single site model (one SSB monomer binding to one RNase HI) using Origin software. SSB-Ct peptide aliquots were titrated into 15N-labeled RNase HI* (1.34 mm) in 50 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.5 at 25 °C. 1H-15N heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra were collected at 0:1, 0.5:1, 1:1, and 2:1 peptide:RNase HI* molar ratios. Normalized changes in chemical shift positions between the 0:1 and 2:1 spectra were calculated from the equation Δppm = [(Δ1H ppm)2 + (Δ15N ppm × αN)2]0.5 where Δppm is the difference in ppm between the chemical shifts of the RNase HI* and RNase HI*·SSB-Ct complex and 0.1 serves as the scaling factor (based on the ∼10-fold lower gyromagnetic ratio of 15N relative to 1H) of the nitrogen chemical shift changes (αN) (52.Schweimer K.

Oligonucleotides were mixed in a 1:1 molar ratio in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl; incubated at 95 °C for 4 min; and then slow cooled to 25 °C over a ∼6-h period. For Michaelis-Menten kinetic measurements, the RNA/DNA hybrid substrate concentration was varied from 0.25 to 10 μm (nucleotides) (equivalent to 2.55–102 nm (molecules)), and the SSB concentration was adjusted to maintain one SSB tetramer/substrate molecule in reaction buffer.

https://openalex.org/W2077631914,"Chronic wounds, including pressure ulcers, compromise the health of 6.5 million Americans and pose an annual estimated burden of $25 billion to the U.S. health care system. When treating chronic wounds, clinicians must use meticulous documentation to determine wound severity and to monitor healing progress over time. Yet, current wound documentation practices using digital photography are often cumbersome and labor intensive. The process of transferring photos into Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) requires many steps and can take several days. Newer smartphone and tablet-based solutions, such as Epic Haiku, have reduced EMR upload time. However, issues still exist involving patient positioning, image-capture technique, and patient identification. In this paper, we present the development and assessment of the SnapCap System for chronic wound photography. Through leveraging the sensor capabilities of Google Glass, SnapCap enables hands-free digital image capture, and the tagging and transfer of images to a patient’s EMR. In a pilot study with wound care nurses at Stanford Hospital (n=16), we (i) examined feature preferences for hands-free digital image capture and documentation, and (ii) compared SnapCap to the state of the art in digital wound care photography, the Epic Haiku application. We used the Wilcoxon Signed-ranks test to evaluate differences in mean ranks between preference options. Preferred hands-free navigation features include barcode scanning for patient identification, Z(15) = -3.873, p < 0.001, r = 0.71, and double-blinking to take photographs, Z(13) = -3.606, p < 0.001, r = 0.71. In the comparison between SnapCap and Epic Haiku, the SnapCap System was preferred for sterile image-capture technique, Z(16) = -3.873, p < 0.001, r = 0.68. Responses were divided with respect to image quality and overall ease of use. The study’s results have contributed to the future implementation of new features aimed at enhancing mobile hands-free digital photography for chronic wound care."
https://openalex.org/W2023864022,"Intervention fidelity refers to the degree to which an experimental manipulation has been implemented as intended, but simple, robust methods for quantifying fidelity have not been well documented. Therefore, we aim to illustrate a rigorous quantitative evaluation of intervention fidelity, using data collected during a high-intensity interval training intervention.Single-group measurement study.Seventeen adolescents (mean age ± standard deviation [SD] 14.0 ± 0.3 years) attended a 10-week high-intensity interval training intervention, comprising two exercise sessions per week. Sessions consisted of 4-7 45-s maximal effort repetitions, interspersed with 90-s rest. We collected heart rate data at 5-s intervals and recorded the peak heart rate for each repetition. The high-intensity exercise criterion was ≥ 90% of individual maximal heart rate. For each participant, we calculated the proportion of total exercise repetitions exceeding this threshold. A linear mixed model was applied to properly separate the variability in peak heart rate between- and within-subjects. Results are presented both as intention to treat (including missed sessions) and per protocol (only participants with 100% attendance; n=8).For intention to treat, the median (interquartile range) proportion of repetitions meeting the high-intensity criterion was 58% (42% to 68%). The mean peak heart rate was 85% of maximal, with a between-subject SD of 7.8 (95% confidence interval 5.4 to 11.3) percentage points and a within-subject SD of 15.1 (14.6 to 15.6) percentage points. For the per protocol analysis, the median proportion of high-intensity repetitions was 68% (47% to 86%). The mean peak heart rate was 91% of maximal, with between- and within-subject SDs of 3.1 (-1.3 to 4.6) and 3.4 (3.2 to 3.6) percentage points, respectively.Synthesising information on exercise session attendance and compliance (exercise intensity) quantifies the intervention dose and informs evaluations of treatment fidelity."

Method RBC from fifteen healthy volunteers (HC) and four patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) were separated in seven subpopulations by Percoll density gradient centrifugation. Results The proportion of old RBC was significantly higher in DM compared to HC. In both groups, in vivo aging was marked by changes in RBC shape and decreased cell volume. RBC nitrite, as marker for NO, was higher in DM and increased in both HC and DM during aging. RBC deformability was lower in DM and significantly decreased in old compared to young RBC in both HC and DM. RBC-NOS Serine1177 phosphorylation, indicating enzyme activation, increased during aging in both HC and DM. Arginase I activity remained unchanged during aging in HC. In DM, arginase I activity was significantly higher in young RBC compared to HC but decreased during aging. In HC, concentration of L-arginine, the substrate of RBC-NOS and arginase I, significantly dropped from young to old RBC. In DM, L-arginine concentration was significantly higher in young RBC compared to HC and significantly decreased during aging. In blood from healthy subjects, RBC-NOS activation was additionally inhibited by N5-(1-iminoethyl)-L-Ornithine dihydrochloride which decreased RBC nitrite, and impaired RBC deformability of all but the oldest RBC subpopulation. Conclusion This study first-time showed highest RBC-NOS activation and NO production in old RBC, possibly to counteract the negative impact of cell shrinkage on RBC deformability. This was even more pronounced in DM. It is further suggested that highly produced NO only insufficiently affects cell function of old RBC maybe because of isolated RBC-NOS in old RBC thus decreasing NO bioavailability. Thus, increasing NO availability may improve RBC function and may extend cell life span in old RBC."

We investigated the association between the FLI and the risk of type 2 diabetes and evaluated to what extent single FLI components contribute to the diabetes risk. We analysed a case-cohort study (random sub-cohort: 1922; incident cases: 563) nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study. The proportion of exposure effect (PEE) explained by single FLI components was evaluated and effect decomposition using inverse probability weighting (IPW) was applied. Women and men with a FLI ≥60 compared to those with a FLI <30 had a multivariable-adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR) of 17.6; 95% confidence interval (CI) 11.1-28.0 and HR: 10.9; 95% CI 6.22-19.2, respectively. Adjustment for BMI or waist circumference attenuated this association in men [PEEBMI (95% CI) = 53.8% (43.9%-65.8%); PEEwaist (95% CI) = 54.8% (44.2%-68.8%)]. In women, adjustment for waist circumference attenuated the association to a lesser degree than in men [PEEwaist (95% CI) = 31.1%; (21.9%-43.1%)] while BMI had no appreciable effect [PEEBMI (95% CI) = 11.0% (2.68%-21.0%)]. γ-glutamyltransferase and triglycerides showed only a small attenuation in women [PEEGGT(95% CI) = 3.11% (-0.72%-4.48%); PEETG (95% CI) = 6.36% (3.81%-9.92%)] and in men [PEEGGT = 0%; PEETG (95% CI) = 6.23% (2.03%-11.8%)]. In women, the total effect was decomposed into a direct effect and 4 indirect effects (HRBMI = 1.10; HRwaist = 1.28; HRGGT = 0.97 and HRTG = 1.03). In men, the 4 indirect effects were HRBMI = 1.25; HRwaist = 1.29; HRGGT = 0.97 and HRTG = 0.99. These data suggest that the FLI, as a proxy for fatty liver, is associated with risk of type 2 diabetes. This association is only partly explained by standard estimates of overall and abdominal body fatness, particularly among women."
https://openalex.org/W2005107057,"Light is the fundamental driver of primary productivity in the marine environment. Reduced light availability has the potential to alter the distribution, community composition, and productivity of key benthic primary producers, potentially reducing habitat and energy provision to coastal food webs. We compared the underwater light environment of macroalgal dominated shallow subtidal rocky reef habitats on a coastline modified by human activities with a coastline of forested catchments. Key metrics describing the availability of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) were determined over 295 days and were related to macroalgal depth distribution, community composition, and standing biomass patterns, which were recorded seasonally. Light attenuation was more than twice as high in shallow subtidal zones along the modified coast. Macroalgal biomass was 2–5 times greater within forested sites, and even in shallow water (2m) a significant difference in biomass was observed. Long-term light dose provided the best explanation for differences in observed biomass between modified and forested coasts, with light availability over the study period differing by 60 and 90 mol photons m−2 at 2 and 10 metres, respectively. Higher biomass on the forested coast was driven by the presence of larger individuals rather than species diversity or density. This study suggests that commonly used metrics such as species diversity and density are not as sensitive as direct measures of biomass when detecting the effects of light limitation within macroalgal communities."
https://openalex.org/W2079439893,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) provide a non-invasive accessible source of tumor material from patients with cancer. The cellular heterogeneity within CTC populations is of great clinical importance regarding the increasing number of adjuvant treatment options for patients with metastatic carcinomas, in order to eliminate residual disease. Moreover, the molecular profiling of these rare cells might lead to insight on disease progression and therapeutic strategies than simple CTCs counting. In the present study we investigated the feasibility to detect KRAS, BRAF, CD133 and Plastin3 (PLS3) mutations in an enriched CTCs cell suspension from patients with colorectal cancer, with the hypothesis that these genes` mutations are of great importance regarding the generation of CTCs subpopulations. Subsequently, we compared CTCs mutational status with that of the corresponding primary tumor, in order to access the possibility of tumor cells characterization without biopsy. CTCs were detected and isolated from blood drawn from 52 colorectal cancer (CRC) patients using a quantum-dot-labelled magnetic immunoassay method. Mutations were detected by PCR-RFLP or allele-specific PCR and confirmed by direct sequencing. In 52 patients, discordance between primary tumor and CTCs was 5.77% for KRAS, 3.85% for BRAF, 11.54% for CD133 rs3130, 7.69% for CD133 rs2286455 and 11.54% for PLS3 rs6643869 mutations. Our results support that DNA mutational analysis of CTCs may enable non-invasive, specific biomarker diagnostics and expand the scope of personalized medicine for cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W1973540232,"There has been an increasing interest in seafloor exploitation such as mineral mining in deep-sea hydrothermal fields, but the environmental impact of anthropogenic disturbance to the seafloor is poorly known. In this study, the effect of such anthropogenic disturbance by scientific drilling operations (IODP Expedition 331) on seabed landscape and megafaunal habitation was surveyed for over 3 years using remotely operated vehicle video observation in a deep-sea hydrothermal field, the Iheya North field, in the Okinawa Trough. We focused on observations from a particular drilling site (Site C0014) where the most dynamic change of landscape and megafaunal habitation was observed among the drilling sites of IODP Exp. 331. No visible hydrothermal fluid discharge had been observed at the sedimentary seafloor at Site C0014, where Calyptogena clam colonies were known for more than 10 years, before the drilling event. After drilling commenced, the original Calyptogena colonies were completely buried by the drilling deposits. Several months after the drilling, diffusing high-temperature hydrothermal fluid began to discharge from the sedimentary subseafloor in the area of over 20 m from the drill holes, 'artificially' creating a new hydrothermal vent habitat. Widespread microbial mats developed on the seafloor with the diffusing hydrothermal fluids and the galatheid crab Shinkaia crosnieri endemic to vents dominated the new vent community. The previously soft, sedimentary seafloor was hardened probably due to barite/gypsum mineralization or silicification, becoming rough and undulated with many fissures after the drilling operation. Although the effects of the drilling operation on seabed landscape and megafaunal composition are probably confined to an area of maximally 30 m from the drill holes, the newly established hydrothermal vent ecosystem has already lasted 2 years and is like to continue to exist until the fluid discharge ceases and thus the ecosystem in the area has been altered for long-term."
https://openalex.org/W2080469723,"Multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC) have attracted interest for their cytotherapeutic potential, partly due to their immunomodulatory abilities. The aim of this study was to test the robustness of our equine cord blood (CB) MSC isolation protocol, to characterize the CB-MSC before and after cryopreservation, and to evaluate their immunosuppressive phenotype. We hypothesized that MSC can be consistently isolated from equine CB, have unique and reproducible marker expression and in vitro suppress lymphoproliferation. Preliminary investigation of constitutive cytoplasmic Toll-like receptor (TLR) 3 and 4 expression was also preformed due to their possible association with anti- or pro-inflammatory MSC phenotypes, respectively. Surface markers were assessed for antigen and mRNA expression by flow cytometry and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Immunomodulatory properties were evaluated in mixed lymphocyte reaction assays, and TLR3 and TLR4 expression were measured by qPCR and immunocytochemistry (ICC). CB-MSC were isolated from each off nine cord blood samples. CB-MSC highly expressed CD29, CD44, CD90, and lacked or had low expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, MHC-II, CD4, CD8, CD11a/18 and CD73 before and after cryopreservation. CB-MSC suppressed in vitro lymphoproliferation and constitutively expressed TLR4. Our findings confirmed CB as a reliable MSC source, provides an association of surface marker phenotype and mRNA expression and suggest anti-inflammatory properties of CB-MSC. The relationship between TLRs and lymphocyte function warrants further investigation."
https://openalex.org/W2015250025,"Cell-adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily play critical roles in brain development, as well as in maintaining synaptic plasticity, the dysfunction of which is known to cause cognitive impairment. Recently dysfunction of KIRREL3, a synaptic molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily, has been implicated in several neurodevelopmental conditions including intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, and in the neurocognitive delay associated with Jacobsen syndrome. However, the molecular mechanisms of its physiological actions remain largely unknown. Using a yeast two-hybrid screen, we found that the KIRREL3 extracellular domain interacts with brain expressed proteins MAP1B and MYO16 and its intracellular domain can potentially interact with ATP1B1, UFC1, and SHMT2. The interactions were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation and colocalization analyses of proteins expressed in human embryonic kidney cells, mouse neuronal cells, and rat primary neuronal cells. Furthermore, we show KIRREL3 colocalization with the marker for the Golgi apparatus and synaptic vesicles. Previously, we have shown that KIRREL3 interacts with the X-linked intellectual disability associated synaptic scaffolding protein CASK through its cytoplasmic domain. In addition, we found a genomic deletion encompassing MAP1B in one patient with intellectual disability, microcephaly and seizures and deletions encompassing MYO16 in two unrelated patients with intellectual disability, autism and microcephaly. MAP1B has been previously implicated in synaptogenesis and is involved in the development of the actin-based membrane skeleton. MYO16 is expressed in hippocampal neurons and also indirectly affects actin cytoskeleton through its interaction with WAVE1 complex. We speculate KIRREL3 interacting proteins are potential candidates for intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Moreover, our findings provide further insight into understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the physiological action of KIRREL3 and its role in neurodevelopment."

The disease was first reported in Japan in the 1920s and has since been frequently observed. Initially only race 0 isolates were reported, but since the consecutive introduction of resistance genes Cf-2, Cf-4, Cf-5 and Cf-9 new races have evolved. Here we first determined the virulence spectrum of 133 C. fulvum isolates collected from 22 prefectures in Japan, and subsequently sequenced the avirulence (Avr) genes Avr2, Avr4, Avr4E, Avr5 and Avr9 to determine the molecular basis of overcoming Cf genes. Twelve races of C. fulvum with a different virulence spectrum were identified, of which races 9, 2.9, 4.9, 4.5.9 and 4.9.11 occur only in Japan. The Avr genes in many of these races contain unique mutations not observed in races identified elsewhere in the world including (i) frameshift mutations and (ii) transposon insertions in Avr2, (iii) point mutations in Avr4 and Avr4E, and (iv) deletions of Avr4E, Avr5 and Avr9. New races have developed by selection pressure imposed by consecutive introductions of Cf-2, Cf-4, Cf-5 and Cf-9 genes in commercially grown tomato cultivars. Our study shows that molecular variations to adapt to different Cf genes in an isolated C. fulvum population in Japan are novel but overall follow similar patterns as those observed in populations from other parts of the world. Implications for breeding of more durable C. fulvum resistant varieties are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W1981318638,"EPH kinases are the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinases, and their ligands, ephrins (EFNs), are also cell surface molecules. This work presents evidence that EPHB4 on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is involved in blood pressure regulation. We generated gene KO mice with smooth muscle cell-specific deletion of EPHB4. Male KO mice, but not female KO mice, were hypotensive. VSMCs from male KO mice showed reduced contractility when compared with their WT counterparts. Signaling both from EFNBs to EPHB4 (forward signaling) and from EPHB4 to EFNB2 (reverse signaling) modulated VSMC contractility. At the molecular level, the absence of EPHB4 in VSMCs resulted in compromised signaling from Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) to myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to myosin light chain, the last of which controls the contraction force of motor molecule myosin. Near the cell membrane, an adaptor protein GRIP1, which can associate with EFNB2, was found to be essential in mediating EPHB4-to-EFNB reverse signaling, which regulated VSMC contractility, based on siRNA gene knockdown studies. Our research indicates that EPHB4 plays an essential role in regulating small artery contractility and blood pressure. Background: The role of EPHB4 blood pressure regulation was not previously known. Results: Male but not female smooth muscle cell-specific Ephb4 gene knock-out mice were hypotensive; bi-directional signaling between EFNBs and EPHB4 modulated small artery contractility. Conclusion: EPHB4 in vascular smooth muscle cells regulates blood pressure. Significance: A new mechanism of blood pressure regulation has been discovered."
https://openalex.org/W1980140560,"Histatins (Hsts) are histidine-rich peptides exclusively present in the saliva of higher primates. In this study, we explored the effects of Hsts on cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesion. Histatin (Hst)-1 caused a significant (>2-fold) increase (EC50 = 1 µM) in the ability of human adherent cells to attach and spread, even in conditions that impaired cell spreading. Other tested Hsts did not stimulate cell spreading, indicating a specific effect of Hst1. The effect of Hst1 on cell-cell adhesion was investigated by using transepithelial resistance (TER) measurements in the human cell line Caco-2, a widely used model for the epithelial layer. We found that 10 µM Hst1 caused a 20% increase in TER compared to the negative control, indicating a function for Hst1 in intercellular cell adhesion and epithelial integrity. A role for Hst1 in both cell-substrate and cell-cell adhesion is highly conceivable, because these 2 modes of adhesion are closely related via shared components and connected signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2073498077,"Prevention of brain injury in woodpeckers under high deceleration during the pecking process has been an intriguing biomechanical problem for a long time. Several studies have provided different explanations, but the function of the hyoid bone, one of the more interesting skeletal features of a woodpecker, still has not been fully explored. This paper studies the relationship between a woodpecker head's response to impact and the hyoid bone. Based on micro-CT scanning images, the material point method (MPM) is employed to simulate woodpecker's pecking process. The maximum shear stress in the brainstem (SSS) is adopted as an indicator of brain injury. The motion and deformation of the first cervical vertebra is found to be the main reason of the shear stress of the brain. Our study found that the existence of the hyoid bone reduces the SSS level, enhances the rigidity of the head, and suppresses the oscillation of the endoskeleton after impact. The mechanism is explained by a brief mechanical analysis while the influence of the material properties of the muscle is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2126680686,"Transcriptional alterations are characteristic of persistent pain states, but the key regulators remain elusive. HDAC4 is a transcriptional corepressor that has been linked to synaptic plasticity and neuronal excitability, mechanisms that may be involved in peripheral and central sensitization. Using a conditional knockout (cKO) strategy in mice, we sought to determine whether the loss of HDAC4 would have implications for sensory neuron transcription and nociception. HDAC4 was found to be largely unnecessary for transcriptional regulation of naïve sensory neurons but was essential for appropriate transcriptional responses after injury, with Calca and Trpv1 expression consistently down-regulated in HDAC4 cKO compared to levels in the littermate controls (0.2-0.44-fold change, n = 4 in 2 separate experiments). This down-regulation corresponded to reduced sensitivity to 100 nM capsaicin in vitro (IC50 = 230 ± 20 nM, 76 ± 4.4% wild-type capsaicin responders vs. 56.9 ± 4.7% HDAC4 cKO responders) and to reduced thermal hypersensitivity in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) model of inflammatory pain (1.3-1.4-fold improvement over wild-type controls; n = 5-12, in 2 separate experiments). These data indicate that HDAC4 is a novel inflammatory pain mediator and may be a good therapeutic target, capable of orchestrating the regulation of multiple downstream effectors."
https://openalex.org/W2026614452,"As the intensity and speed of environmental change increase at both local and global scales it is imperative that we gain a better understanding of the ecological implications of community shifts. While there has been substantial progress toward understanding the drivers and subsequent responses of community change (e.g. lake trophic state), the ecological impacts of food web changes are far less understood. We analyzed Wabash River fish assemblage data collected from 1974-2008, to evaluate temporal variation in body-size structure and functional group composition. Two parameters derived from annual community size-spectra were our major response variables: (1) the regression slope is an index of ecological efficiency and predator-prey biomass ratios, and (2) spectral elevation (regression midpoint height) is a proxy for food web capacity. We detected a large assemblage shift, over at least a seven year period, defined by dramatic changes in abundance (measured as catch-per-unit-effort) of the dominant functional feeding groups among two time periods; from an assemblage dominated by planktivore-omnivores to benthic invertivores. There was a concurrent increase in ecological efficiency (slopes increased over time) following the shift associated with an increase in large-bodied low trophic level fish. Food web capacity remained relatively stable with no clear temporal trends. Thus, increased ecological efficiency occurred simultaneous to a compensatory response that shifted biomass among functional feeding groups."
https://openalex.org/W2046151891,"Haemophilus ducreyi resists the cytotoxic effects of human antimicrobial peptides (APs), including α-defensins, β-defensins, and the cathelicidin LL-37. Resistance to LL-37, mediated by the sensitive to antimicrobial peptide (Sap) transporter, is required for H. ducreyi virulence in humans. Cationic APs are attracted to the negatively charged bacterial cell surface. In other gram-negative bacteria, modification of lipopolysaccharide or lipooligosaccharide (LOS) by the addition of positively charged moieties, such as phosphoethanolamine (PEA), confers AP resistance by means of electrostatic repulsion. H. ducreyi LOS has PEA modifications at two sites, and we identified three genes (lptA, ptdA, and ptdB) in H. ducreyi with homology to a family of bacterial PEA transferases. We generated non-polar, unmarked mutants with deletions in one, two, or all three putative PEA transferase genes. The triple mutant was significantly more susceptible to both α- and β-defensins; complementation of all three genes restored parental levels of AP resistance. Deletion of all three PEA transferase genes also resulted in a significant increase in the negativity of the mutant cell surface. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that LptA was required for PEA modification of lipid A; PtdA and PtdB did not affect PEA modification of LOS. In human inoculation experiments, the triple mutant was as virulent as its parent strain. While this is the first identified mechanism of resistance to α-defensins in H. ducreyi, our in vivo data suggest that resistance to cathelicidin LL-37 may be more important than defensin resistance to H. ducreyi pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2070871468,"In recent years, researchers have found that adiponectin (ANP) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and low serum concentrations of ANP are associated with AD. Higher plasma ANP level have a protective effect against the development of cognitive decline, suggesting that ANP may affect AD onset. Meanwhile, accumulating evidence supports the crucial role of ANP in the pathogenesis of AD. To study the relationship between ANP gene polymorphisms (rs266729, -11377C>G and rs1501299, G276T) and late-onset AD (LOAD), we carried out a case-control study that included 201 LOAD patients and 257 healthy control subjects. Statistically significant differences were detected in the genotype and allelotype frequency distributions of rs266729 and rs1501299 between the LOAD group and the control group, with a noticeable increase in the G and T allelotype frequency distributions in the LOAD group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis using recessive model and additive model revealed that the rs266729 GG and rs1501299 TT genotypes are associated with a greater risk of LOAD. Haplotype analysis identified four haplotypes: CG, CT, GG, and GT. The frequencies of the CT and GG haplotypes were not significantly different (P > 0.05) between the LOAD group and control group, whereas the CG and GT haplotypes were significantly different (P < 0.05), suggesting a negative correlation between the CG haplotype and LOAD onset (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.57-0.96, P = 0.022), and a positive correlation between the GT haplotype and LOAD onset (OR = 2.29, 95% CI = 1.42-3.68, P = 0.005). Therefore, we speculated that the rs266729 and rs1501299 of ANP gene polymorphisms and the GT and CG haplotypes were associated with LOAD."
https://openalex.org/W1969958539,"Meroterpenoid chrodrimanins, produced from Talaromyces sp. YO-2, are known to paralyze silkworm (Bombyx mori) larvae, but their target is unknown. We have investigated the actions of chrodrimanin B on ligand-gated ion channels of silkworm larval neurons using patch-clamp electrophysiology. Chrodrimanin B had no effect on membrane currents when tested alone at 1 μM. However, it completely blocked the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-induced current and showed less pronounced actions on acetylcholine- and L-glutamate-induced currents, when delivered at 1 μM for 1 min prior to co-application with transmitter GABA. Thus, chrodrimanins were also tested on a wild-type isoform of the B. mori GABA receptor (GABAR) RDL using two-electrode voltage-clamp electrophysiology. Chrodrimanin B attenuated the peak current amplitude of the GABA response of RDL with an IC50 of 1.66 nM. The order of the GABAR-blocking potency of chrodrimanins B > D > A was in accordance with their reported insecticidal potency. Chrodrimanin B had no open channel blocking action when tested at 3 nM on the GABA response of RDL. Co-application with 3 nM chrodrimanin B shifted the GABA concentration response curve to a higher concentration and further increase of chrodrimanin B concentration to10 nM; it reduced maximum current amplitude of the GABA response, pointing to a high-affinity competitive action and a lower affinity non-competitive action. The A282S;T286V double mutation of RDL, which impairs the actions of fipronil, hardly affected the blocking action of chrodrimanin B, indicating a binding site of chrodrimanin B distinct from that of fipronil. Chrodrimanin B showed approximately 1,000-fold lower blocking action on human α1β2γ2 GABAR compared to RDL and thus is a selective blocker of insect GABARs."
https://openalex.org/W2047762833,"Background Multiple sclerosis (MS) is less prevalent among Indians when compared to white populations. Genetic susceptibility remaining the same it is possible that environmental associations may have a role in determining disease prevalence. Aims To determine whether childhood infections, vaccination status, past infection with Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori), diet, socioeconomic and educational status were associated with MS. Material and Methods 139 patients and 278 matched control subjects were selected. A validated environmental exposure questionnaire was administered. Estimation of serum H.pylori IgG antibody was done by ELISA. Patients and controls were genotyped for HLA-DRB1*15:01. Results In our cohort a significant association was seen with measles (p <0.007), vegetarian diet (p < 0.001, higher educational status (p <0.0001) and urban living (p <0.0001). An inverse relationship was seen with H.Pylori infection and MS (p <0.001). Measles infection (OR 6.479, CI 1.21- 34.668, p< 0.029) and high educational status (OR 3.088, CI 1.212- 7.872, p< 0.018) were significant risk factors associated with MS. H.pylori infection was inversely related to MS (OR 0. 319, CI 0.144- 0.706, p <0.005). Conclusions Environmental influences may be important in determining MS prevalence."
https://openalex.org/W2055606375,"S. flexneri is the leading cause of bacillary dysentery in the developing countries. Several temperate phages originating from this host have been characterised. However, all S. flexneri phages known to date are lambdoid phages, which have the ability to confer the O-antigen modification of their host. In this study, we report the isolation and characterisation of a novel Mu-like phage from a serotype 4a strain of S. flexneri. The genome of phage SfMu is composed of 37,146 bp and is predicted to contain 55 open reading frames (orfs). Comparative genome analysis of phage SfMu with Mu and other Mu-like phages revealed that SfMu is closely related to phage Mu, sharing >90% identity with majority of its proteins. Moreover, investigation of phage SfMu receptor on the surface of the host cell revealed that the O-antigen of the host serves as the receptor for the adsorption of phage SfMu. This study also demonstrates pervasiveness of SfMu phage in S. flexneri, by identifying complete SfMu prophage strains of serotype X and Y, and remnants of SfMu in strains belonging to 4 other serotypes, thereby indicating that transposable phages in S. flexneri are not uncommon. The findings of this study contribute an advance in our current knowledge of S. flexneri phages and will also play a key role in understanding the evolution of S. flexneri."
https://openalex.org/W2085148213,"Mitochondria in eukaryotic cells are derived from bacteria in evolution. Like bacteria, mitochondria contain DNA with unmethylated CpG motifs and formyl peptides, both of which have recently been shown to be damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and induce immune response and cell injury. Based on the facts that circulating mitochondrial DAMPs (mtDAMPs) are increased in the patients of trauma or burn injury who also have proteinuria, that mtDAMPs can activate immune cells which in turn secrete glomerular permeability factors, that renal intrinsic cells express a variety of DAMP receptors, and that mtDAMPs can directly increase endothelial cell permeability in vitro, we hypothesized that mtDAMPs may be novel circulating factors inducing proteinuria and kidney injury. We tested this hypothesis by directly injecting mtDAMPs into rodents and examining urinary protein and kidney histology. We prepared mtDAMP samples, including mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and mitochondrial debris (MTD), from rodent liver. In mice, injection of mtDNA for 20 μg/ml initial concentration in circulation (much higher than the clinical range), did not cause any renal manifestations. However, an increased dose leading to 45 μg/ml initial concentration in circulation resulted in a transient, slight increase in urinary albumin. In rats, MTD injection resulting in 450 μg/ml initial concentration of MTD protein in circulation, which was much higher than the clinical range, caused mild, transient proteinuria and lung lesions. Multiple injections of such large amount of either mtDNA or MTD into rodents on 3 consecutive days also failed in inducing proteinuria and kidney injury. In summary, clinical levels of circulating mtDAMPs do not induce proteinuria and clinically irrelevant high levels of mtDAMPs cause only a transient and slight increase in urinary protein in rodents, suggesting that circulating mtDAMPs may not be responsible for the proteinuria and kidney injury in patients with trauma, burn injury, and other diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2025629861,"Motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) are usually assessed with semi-quantitative tests such as the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) which are limited by subjectivity, categorical design, and low sensitivity. Particularly bradykinesia as assessed e.g. with speeded index finger tapping exhibits low validity measures. This exploratory study set out to (i) assess whether force transducer-based objective and quantitative analysis of motor coordination in index finger tapping is able to distinguish between PD patients and controls, and (ii) assess longitudinal changes. Sixteen early-stage and 17 mid-stage PD patients as well as 18 controls were included in the cross-sectional part of the study; thirteen, 16 and 16 individuals of the respective groups agreed in a reassessment 12 months later. Frequency, force, rhythmicity, regularity and laterality of speeded and metronome paced tapping were recorded by digitomotography using a quantitative motor system (""Q-Motor""). Analysis of cross-sectional data revealed most consistent differences between PD patients and controls in variability of tap performance across modalities assessed. Among PD patients, variability of taps and the ability to keep a given rhythm were associated with UPDRS motor and finger tapping scores. After 12 months, laterality parameters were reduced but no other parameters changed significantly. This data suggests that digitomotography provides quantitative and objective measures capable to differentiate PD from non-PD in a small cohort, however, the value of the assessment to track PD progression has to be further evaluated in larger cohorts of patients."
https://openalex.org/W2071970639,"Hyperthermia as an anticancer method has been paid increasing attention in recent years. Several studies have shown that hyperthermia can kill tumor cells by inducing apoptosis. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of hyperthermia-induced apoptosis are largely unknown. To investigate the effects and molecular mechanism of hyperthermia on the apoptosis in renal carcinoma 786-O cells, we firstly examined apoptosis and Ku expression in 786-O cell line treated with heat exposure (42°C for 0-4 h). The results showed that hyperthermia induced apoptosis of 786-O cells, and suppressed significantly Ku80 expression, but not Ku70 expression. Next, we knock-down Ku80 in 786-O cells, generating stable cell line 786-O-shKu80, and detected apoptosis, cell survival and cell cycle distribution. Our data showed higher apoptotic rate and lower surviving fraction in the stable cell line 786-O-shKu80 compared with those in control cells, exposed to the same heat stress (42°C for 0-4 h). Moreover, the results also showed suppression of Ku80 led to G2/M phase arrest in the stable cell line 786-O-shKu80 following heat treatment. Together, these findings indicate that Ku80 may play an important role in hyperthermia-induced apoptosis and heat-sensitivity of renal carcinoma cells through influencing the cell cycle distribution."
https://openalex.org/W2152786880,"Dietary influences may affect microbiome composition and host immune responses, thereby modulating propensity toward inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs): Crohn disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Dietary n-6 fatty acids have been associated with UC in prospective studies. However, the critical developmental period when (n-6) consumption may induce UC is not known. We examined the effects of transiently increased n-6 consumption during pediatric development on subsequent dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS)-induced acute murine colitis. The animals transiently became obese then rapidly lost this phenotype. Interestingly, mice were protected against DSS colitis 40 days after n-6 consumption. The transient high n-6-induced protection against colitis was fat type- and dietary reversal-dependent and could be transferred to germ-free mice by fecal microbiota transplantation. We also detected decreased numbers of chemokine receptor (Cxcr)5(+) CD4(+) T cells in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) of transiently n-6-fed mice. Further experiments revealed that anti-chemokine ligand (Cxcl)13 (the ligand of Cxcr5) antibody treatment decreased DSS colitis severity, implicating the importance of the Cxcr5-Cxcl13 pathway in mammalian colitis. Consecutively, we found elevated CXCL13 concentrations (CD: 1.8-fold, P = 0.0077; UC: 1.9-fold, P = 0.056) in the serum of untreated pediatric IBD patients. The human serologic observations supported the translational relevance of our findings."
https://openalex.org/W2064505741,"Among the many related issues of diabetes management, its complications constitute the main part of the heavy burden of this disease. The aim of this paper is to develop a risk advisor model to predict the chances of diabetes complications according to the changes in risk factors. As the starting point, an inclusive list of (k) diabetes complications and (n) their correlated predisposing factors are derived from the existing endocrinology text books. A type of data meta-analysis has been done to extract and combine the numeric value of the relationships between these two. The whole n (risk factors) - k (complications) model was broken down into k different (n-1) relationships and these (n-1) dependencies were broken into n (1-1) models. Applying regression analysis (seven patterns) and artificial neural networks (ANN), we created models to show the (1-1) correspondence between factors and complications. Then all 1-1 models related to an individual complication were integrated using the naïve Bayes theorem. Finally, a Bayesian belief network was developed to show the influence of all risk factors and complications on each other. We assessed the predictive power of the 1-1 models by R2, F-ratio and adjusted R2 equations; sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value were calculated to evaluate the final model using real patient data. The results suggest that the best fitted regression models outperform the predictive ability of an ANN model, as well as six other regression patterns for all 1-1 models."
https://openalex.org/W2010396882,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by a significant loss of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and a subsequent loss of dopamine (DA) within the striatum. Despite advances in the development of pharmacological therapies that are effective at alleviating the symptoms of PD, the search for therapeutic treatments that halt or slow the underlying nigral degeneration remains a particular challenge. Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor β superfamily, has been shown to play a role in the neuroprotection of midbrain neurons against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in vitro, suggesting that activin A may offer similar neuroprotective effects in in vivo models of PD. Using robust stereological methods, we found that intrastriatal injections of 6-OHDA results in a significant loss of both TH positive and NeuN positive populations in the SNpc at 1, 2, and 3 weeks post-lesioning in drug naïve mice. Exogenous application of activin A for 7 days, beginning the day prior to 6-OHDA administration, resulted in a significant survival of both dopaminergic and total neuron numbers in the SNpc against 6-OHDA-induced toxicity. However, we found no corresponding protection of striatal DA or dopamine transporter (DAT) expression levels in animals receiving activin A compared to vehicle controls. These results provide the first evidence that activin A exerts potent neuroprotection in a mouse model of PD, however this neuroprotection may be localized to the midbrain."
https://openalex.org/W1974746975,"The Implicit Association Test (IAT) aims to measure participants’ automatic evaluation of an attitude object and is useful especially for the measurement of attitudes related to socially sensitive subjects, e.g. doping in sports. Several studies indicate that IAT scores can be faked on instruction. But fully or semi-instructed research scenarios might not properly reflect what happens in more realistic situations, when participants secretly decide to try faking the test. The present study is the first to investigate IAT faking when there is only an implicit incentive to do so. Sixty-five athletes (22.83 years ± 2.45; 25 women) were randomly assigned to an incentive-to-fake condition or a control condition. Participants in the incentive-to-fake condition were manipulated to believe that athletes with lenient doping attitudes would be referred to a tedious 45-minute anti-doping program. Attitudes were measured with the pictorial doping brief IAT (BIAT) and with the Performance Enhancement Attitude Scale (PEAS). A one-way MANOVA revealed significant differences between conditions after the manipulation in PEAS scores, but not in the doping BIAT. In the light of our hypothesis this suggests that participants successfully faked an exceedingly negative attitude to doping when completing the PEAS, but were unsuccessful in doing so on the reaction time-based test. This study assessed BIAT faking in a setting that aimed to resemble a situation in which participants want to hide their attempts to cheat. The two measures of attitude were differentially affected by the implicit incentive. Our findings provide evidence that the pictorial doping BIAT is relatively robust against spontaneous and naïve faking attempts. (B)IATs might be less prone to faking than implied by previous studies."
https://openalex.org/W1967630750,"Targeting the consolidation of fear memories following trauma may offer a promising method for preventing the development of flashbacks and other unwanted re-experiencing symptoms that characterise Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Research has demonstrated that performing visuo-spatial tasks after analogue trauma can block the consolidation of fear memory and reduce the frequency of flashbacks. However, no research has yet used verbal techniques to alter memories during the consolidation window. This is surprising given that the most effective treatments for PTSD are verbally-based with exposure therapy and trauma-focused cognitive behavioural therapy gaining the most evidence of efficacy. Psychological therapies aim to reduce the conditioned fear response, which is in keeping with the preliminary finding that an increased propensity for fear conditioning may be a vulnerability factor for PTSD. Our research had two aims. We investigated the degree to which individual differences in fear conditioning predict the development of PTSD symptoms. We also compared the preventative effects of two clinically informed psychological techniques administered during the consolidation window: exposure to the trauma memory and updating the meaning of the trauma. 115 healthy participants underwent a fear conditioning paradigm in which traumatic film stimuli (unconditioned stimuli) were paired with neutral stimuli (conditioned stimuli). Participants were randomly allocated to an updating, exposure or control group to compare the effects on the conditioned fear response and on PTSD symptomatology. The results showed that stronger conditioned responses at acquisition significantly predicted the development of PTSD symptoms. The updating group, who verbally devalued the unconditioned stimulus within the consolidation window, experienced significantly lower levels of PTSD symptoms during follow-up than the exposure and control groups. These findings are consistent with clinical interventions for chronic PTSD and have important implications for identifying those at risk as well as for designing novel early interventions to prevent the development of PTSD."

Although not as tightly linked to tumor suppression as RB, tumor suppressive capacity has been assigned to these other family members in some contexts. In mouse studies, RB-deficient mice were prone to pituitary tumor formation (7.Jacks T. Fazeli A. Schmitt E.M. Bronson R.T. Goodell M.A. Weinberg R.A. Effects of an Rb mutation in the mouse.Nature. 1992; 359: 295-300Crossref PubMed Scopus (1514) Google Scholar), whereas mice deficient for RB and p107 or p130 developed retinoblastoma (8.Ajioka I.

Similarly, conditional loss of p130 in adult lung epithelial cells in a RB−/−/p53−/− null background enhanced development of small cell lung carcinoma (10.Schaffer B.E. Park K.S. Yiu G. Conklin J.F.

Thus, all three RB family members can act as tumor suppressors in specific contexts. retinoblastoma cyclin-dependent kinase embryonic stem instability element leukemia inhibitory factor triple knock out retinoic acid. In their roles as tumor suppressors, RB family members predominately function as transcriptional repressors of target genes through their antagonism of the E2F-DP family of transcription factors (11.Dyson N.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). Recent evidence suggests that RB also plays a positive role in transcriptional activation of some pro-apoptotic response genes, again in a mechanism requiring E2F activity (13.Ianari A. Natale T. Calo E. Ferretti E. Alesse E. Screpanti I. Haigis K. Gulino A. Lees J.A. Proapoptotic function of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein.Cancer Cell. 2009; 15: 184-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), although RB may also induce apoptosis through a mechanism that is independent of transcription (14.Hilgendorf K.I.

The retinoblastoma protein induces apoptosis directly at the mitochondria.Genes Dev. 2013; 27: 1003-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In this scenario, RB-mediated tumor suppression is enabled through blockade of gene products necessary for cell growth with concomitant invocation of cell death pathways. As key regulators of cell fate, the RB family is tightly controlled by CDK-mediated phosphorylation in response to environmental conditions (15.Buchkovich K. Duffy L.A. Harlow E.

Cell Biol. 2002; 3: 11-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (961) Google Scholar). In response to mitogenic signals, serial phosphorylation via cyclin D-CDK 4/6 and cyclin E-CDK2 renders RB family members inactive by disengaging their association with E2F complexes (19.Hinds P.W.

The retinoblastoma protein and cell cycle control.Cell. 1995; 81: 323-330Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4309) Google Scholar). Cyclin-CDK activity is also critically regulated during early steps in normal embryonic development (23.White J. Dalton S. Cell cycle control of embryonic stem cells.Stem Cell Rev. 2005; 1: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Rapidly dividing pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells of the early developing embryo employ constitutive CDK-mediated inhibition of RB proteins as a mechanism to maintain rapid cell division during blastocyst formation (24.Savatier P.

Cell. 2005; 16: 2018-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). As ES cells differentiate, CDK activity plummets, allowing RB family proteins to regulate E2F activity in a cell cycle-dependent manner (26.White J. Stead E. Faast R. Conn S. Cartwright P. Dalton S.

The retinoblastoma tumor suppressor and stem cell biology.Genes Dev. 2012; 26: 1409-1420Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Despite this unifying model for cyclin-CDK regulation, there are significant differences in the coordination of RB family member activities and steady state levels. For example, RB and p107 are active in cycling cells, whereas p130 functions predominately in quiescent cells that have exited from the cell cycle. Experiments performed with staged cells showed that steady state p130 levels peak in G0, in contrast to RB and p107, which increase as cells progress through G1 (28.Bhattacharya S. Garriga J. Calbó J. Yong T. Haines D.S. Graña X. SKP2 associates with p130 and accelerates p130 ubiquitylation and degradation in human cells.Oncogene. 2003; 22: 2443-2451Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 29.Tedesco D. Lukas J. Reed S.I.

Consistently, CDK4 activity has opposite effects on p107 and p130 steady state levels; inhibition of the enzyme leads to diminished levels of p107 and higher levels of p130 (30.Rivadeneira D.B. Mayhew C.N. Thangavel C. Sotillo E. Reed C.A. Graña X. Knudsen E.S.

Thus, RB family member activity and stability clearly respond differently to cyclin-CDK signaling during cell cycle progression. However, the mechanisms that link regulation of RB family activity to their turnover are poorly understood. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that the Drosophila melanogaster RB homologue Rbf1 is subjected to proteasome-mediated turnover during embryonic development (31.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32.Ullah Z. Buckley M.S. Arnosti D.N. Henry R.W. Retinoblastoma protein regulation by the COP9 signalosome.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2007; 18: 1179-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that Rbf1 turnover is influenced by an “instability element” (IE) located within its C-terminal regulatory domain. Importantly, the IE region is also critical for full repressor potency for some cell cycle-regulated genes but not for non-canonical targets whose expression is not usually integrated with the cell cycle (31.Acharya P. Raj N. Buckley M.S. Zhang L. Duperon S. Williams G. Henry R.W. Arnosti D.N. Paradoxical instability-activity relationship defines a novel regulatory pathway for retinoblastoma proteins.Mol. Biol. Cell. 2010; 21: 3890-3901Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33.Raj N. Zhang L. Wei Y. Arnosti D.N. Henry R.W. Ubiquitination of retinoblastoma family protein 1 potentiates gene-specific repression function.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 41835-41843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Rbf1 ubiquitination also enhanced specific activity at select cell cycle target genes (33.Raj N. Zhang L. Wei Y. Arnosti D.N. Henry R.W. Ubiquitination of retinoblastoma family protein 1 potentiates gene-specific repression function.J. Biol. Chem. 2012; 287: 41835-41843Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), suggesting that the potency of the repressor at specific genes and overall Rbf1 stability are coordinated. The IE region is well conserved within the mammalian p107 and p130 factors, and we hypothesized that the activity of mammalian RB family members may also be coordinated via integration of the cyclin-CDK signaling pathway with the ubiquitin-proteasome system. We demonstrate here that this regulatory mechanism is indeed shared among the human RB family proteins. The IE regions within the RB, p107, and p130 C-terminal domains negatively regulate repressor stability through a cyclin-CDK-responsive proteasome-dependent pathway and contribute to effective gene repression. These findings indicate that an evolutionarily conserved regulatory pathway links stability and potency for the mammalian RB family. Expression plasmids encoding mutant forms of human RB, p107, and p130 were obtained by site-directed mutagenesis of the pCMV-GFP-RB, pCMV-GFP-p107, and pCMV-GFP-p130 parental plasmids (34.Stengel K.R. Thangavel C. Solomon D.A. Angus S.P. Zheng Y. Knudsen E.S. Retinoblastoma/p107/p130 pocket proteins: protein dynamics and interactions with target gene promoters.J. Biol. Chem. 2009; 284: 19265-19271Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). To generate GFP fusion proteins, PCR-amplified instability elements from RB (residues 786–864), p107 (residues 964–1024), and p130 (residues 1035–1095) were fused in-frame between the HindIII and KpnI sites of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech). All plasmids were verified by sequencing for the desired mutation. Mouse R1 ES cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured on mitomycin-treated mouse embryonic fibroblasts in medium containing high glucose DMEM supplemented with fetal calf serum, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF), l-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and β-mercaptoethanol. J1-ES cells and the RB−/−, p107−/−, p130−/− triple knock out (TKO) ES cells were a kind gift from Julien Sage (35.Sage J. Mulligan G.J. Attardi L.D. Miller A. Chen S. Williams B. Theodorou E. Jacks T. Targeted disruption of the three Rb-related genes leads to loss of G1 control and immortalization.Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 3037-3050Crossref PubMed Scopus (508) Google Scholar). For ES cell differentiation, cells were plated on gelatin-coated plates to eliminate contaminating mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Differentiation was induced by growing cells in the presence of 10 μm retinoic acid (R2625, Sigma) for 72 h. Control cells were treated with DMSO for a similar time. For immunofluorescence analysis, ES cells were grown on Lab-Tek II chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) under similar conditions, and differentiation was induced as discussed above. Cells were fixed in 3.7% freshly made paraformaldehyde for 20 min and washed 3 times in wash buffer (phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 0.1% BSA, and 0.01% Tween 20). Cells were permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, washed, and blocked for 1 h at room temperature in blocking solution (PBS, pH 7.4, 1% BSA, and 0.01% Tween 20). Cells were incubated in primary antibody against anti-RB (G3245, mouse monoclonal, 1:100; BD Pharmingen), anti-p107 (SC-318, rabbit polyclonal, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or anti-p130 (SC-317, rabbit polyclonal, 1:100, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer either overnight at 4 °C (Fig. 1, A–C) or for 2 h at room temperature (Fig. 1, D–F). After three washes in wash buffer, cells were incubated in secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit A11008, Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse A11001; Life Technologies) for 1 h. After three washes in wash buffer, slides were mounted with Vectashield mounting media containing DAPI (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Images were obtained using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 filter-based laser scanning confocal microscope. ES cells were grown on T-125 flasks and treated with either DMSO or 10 μm retinoic acid (RA; R2625, Sigma) for 3 days. Cells were washed in PBS, trypsinized, suspended in DMEM, and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 18 h at 4 °C. Cells were then pelleted, washed with PBS, and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Soluble chromatin was prepared as previously described (36.Wang K. Sengupta S. Magnani L. Wilson C.A. Henry R.W. Knott J.G. Brg1 is required for Cdx2-mediated repression of Oct4 expression in mouse blastocysts.PloS ONE. 2010; 5: e10622Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Chromatin-bound protein complexes were immunoprecipitated in low salt buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X 100) using 5 μg of anti-RB (G3245, BD Biosciences) or anti-p107 (SC-318) or anti-p130 (SC-317) or 5 μg of rabbit nonspecific IgG (Millipore). Chromatin-antibody complexes were isolated using 50 μl of protein G Dynabeads (Life Technologies). Beads were washed once each in low salt buffer, high salt buffer (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 2 mm EDTA, 500 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X 100), LiCl buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA, 250 mm LiCl, 1% deoxycholate, 1% IGEPAL630), and twice with TE buffer (10 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.1, 1 mm EDTA). Chromatin-antibody complexes were eluted from the beads in 200 μl of elution buffer (100 mm NaHCO3, 1% SDS) at 65 °C for 30 min with occasional vortexing. Cross-linking was reversed by the addition of 8 μl of 5 m NaCl and incubation overnight at 65 °C. Extracts were then treated with 1 μl of RNase A (10 mg/ml) for 1 h. Subsequently, 13 μl of proteinase K buffer (8 μl of 1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 4 μl of 0.5 m EDTA and 1 μl of proteinase K (10 mg/ml) were added, and samples were incubated for an additional 1.5 h at 45 °C. Associated DNA was purified using QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on input DNA and antibody-specific ChIP DNA using SYBR Green Master Mix reagents with an ABI Step one plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) detection system. Enrichment of RB family members at target gene promoters was examined using primers spanning known E2F binding sites at the murine CCNA2 and MCM10 loci. An intergenic region on mouse chromosome 6 was used as a negative control. Primer sequences were as follows: CCNA2-F, AATAGTCGCGGGCTACTTGA; CCNA2-R, GAGCGTAGAGCCCAGGAG; MCM10-F, AGCGTCCTCCACAAATGAAC; MCM10-R, ACCCCGTGACGCTTACCTA; Intergenic mouse chr6F, TTTTCAGTTCACACATATAAAGCAGA; Intergenic mouse chr6R, TGTTGTTGTTGTTGCTTCACTG. Pluripotent or differentiated ES cells were harvested, snap-frozen, and stored at −80 °C. RNA was extracted using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Quantitative real-time PCR for RB, p107, and p130 was performed using gene-specific primers (10.Schaffer B.E. Park K.S. Yiu G. Conklin J.F. Lin C. Burkhart D.L. Karnezis A.N. Sweet-Cordero E.A. Sage J. Loss of p130 accelerates tumor development in a mouse model for human small-cell lung carcinoma.Cancer Res. 2010; 70: 3877-3883Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and SYBR Green Master Mix reagents with an ABI Step one plus thermocycler (Applied Biosystems) detection system. Primers sequences were as follows: RB-F, GCTTGGCTAACTTGGGAG; RB-R, CAACTGCTGCGATAAAGATG; p107-F, CCGAAGCCCTGGATGACTT; p107-R, GCATGCCAGCCAGTGTATAACTT; p130-F, AAGGCACATGCTAACCAATGAA; p130-R, GAGCAGTTACCGCAGCATGA. Transcript levels were measured using Taqman probes (Applied Biosystems) for Pou5f1 (Mm03053917_g1), Nanog (Mm02019550_s1), and the eukaryotic elongation factor 1a1 (Mm01966122_u1) as an endogenous control. Relative gene expression was measured by the 2−ΔΔCT method (37.Livak K.J. Schmittgen T.D. Analysis of relative gene expression data using real-time quantitative PCR and the 2(−ΔΔCT) method.Methods. 2001; 25: 402-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (123424) Google Scholar). To determine the effect of CDK4 inhibition on endogenous RB family stability, ∼5 × 105 U2OS cells were grown for 48 h in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin-streptomycin. Cells were then treated with 1 μm PD0332991 (Selleck Chemicals, Houston, TX) and cultured for an additional 24 h with or without 1 μm MG132 for the last 6 h. Cells were harvested, and the pellet was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Cell extracts were prepared in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100), and the total protein concentration determined using the Bradford assay. Equal amounts of whole cell extracts (50 μg) were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western analyses. Endogenous proteins were detected by using the following antibodies: anti-RB (G3245, mouse monoclonal, 1:1,000, BD Pharmingen), anti-p107 (SC-318, rabbit polyclonal, 1:1,000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-p130 (610261, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, BD Biosciences), anti-tubulin (mouse monoclonal, 1:20,000, Iowa Hybridoma Bank), and anti-actin (A5441, mouse monoclonal, 1:10,000, Sigma). In Fig. 2B, p130 was detected using the rabbit polyclonal antibody (SC-317, rabbit polyclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All antibody incubations were performed in 5% milk in TBST (20 mm Tris HCl, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20). Blots were developed using peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies as appropriate (1:5000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent substrate (Thermo Scientific). To measure the effect of CDK4 inhibition on recombinant RB family proteins, ∼5 × 105 U2OS cells were cultured for 24 h before transfection with GFP-tagged full-length or ΔIE mutant constructs using Nanojuice transfection reagent (Novagen, EMD Chemicals, San Diego, CA). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with 1 μm PD0332991 for an additional 24 h. Western analysis was performed as above using anti-GFP antibodies (SC-9996, mouse monoclonal, 1:1000, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The steady state abundance of GFP-tagged full-length, ΔIE, and 4KRA proteins (Fig. 3) was determined by Western blot analyses as described above. To determine the relative stability of GFP and GFP fused to the RB family instability elements, transfected cells were treated with 100 μm cycloheximide 40 h after transfection, and samples were harvested at 3, 6, and 9 h post treatment. For proteasome inhibitor treatments in Figs. 4B and 5A, cells were treated with DMSO or 1 μm MG132 for 24 h.FIGURE 4.The canonical instability elements in human p107 and p130 function as autonomously acting degrons. A, the p107 IE contributes to reduced steady expression of GFP. GFP fluorescence was measured in U2OS cells transfected with GFP alone or the GFP-IEp107 chimera containing GFP fused to residues 964–1024, corresponding to the p107 instability element. Cells were counterstained with DAPI to detect cellular DNA, and overlays (OL) of the GFP and DAPI signals are shown. GFP-IEp107 showed much reduced expression as compared with GFP in most, but not all, cells. B, GFP-IEp107 and GFP-IEp130 steady state expression is enhanced by proteasome inhibition. Anti-GFP Western blot analysis was performed on whole cell extracts derived from U2OS cells transfected with GFP (lanes 1 and 2), GFP-IEp107 (lanes 3 and 4) or GFP-IEp130 containing GFP fused to residues 1035–1095 corresponding to the p130 instability element (lanes 5 and 6) in the absence or presence of MG132 as indicated. Whereas GFP remained insensitive to the proteasome inhibition, the GFP-IE fusion proteins accumulated to higher levels during MG132 treatment, suggesting the involvement of the instability element in proteasome-mediated turnover. Actin was detected as a loading control and was refractory to proteasome inhibition. C, conserved positively charged amino acids contribute to autonomous IE function. Anti-GFP Western blot analysis was performed on cells extracts transfected with either wild type GFP-IEp107 (lane 2) or mutant GFP-IEp107 containing alanine substitutions of four positively charged resides within the IE (lane 3). Similar analysis was performed for wild type GFP-IEp130 (lanes 5 and 8) and mutant GFP-IEp130 (lanes 6 and 9). In all cases the GFP chimeras containing the wild type IE sequences were expressed at lower levels than GFP alone (lanes 1, 4, and 7), whereas alanine substitution within the IE resulted in increased steady state expression. The effect of alanine substitutions on GFP-IEp130 was more evident at a higher exposure of the same blot (lane 8 versus lane 9). Actin was detected as a loading control. D and E, the p107 and p130 instability elements contribute to enhanced protein turnover. Anti-GFP Western analyses was performed on cells expressing either GFP or the wild type GFP-IE chimeras incubated in the presence of the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) for 0, 3, 6, or 9 h as indicated. GFP exhibited a half-life >9 h, whereas the half-lives of the GFP-IE chimeras were <3 h. Actin was detected as a loading control, and its levels remained unperturbed by cycloheximide treatment.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 5.The non-canoni"
https://openalex.org/W2162209677,"Road trauma is a leading cause of death and injury in young people. Traffic offences are common, but their importance as a risk indicator for subsequent road trauma is unknown. This cohort study assessed whether severe road trauma could be predicted by a history of prior traffic offences.Clinical data of all adult road trauma patients admitted to the Western Australia (WA) State Trauma Centre between 1998 and 2013 were linked to traffic offences records at the WA Department of Transport. The primary outcomes were alcohol exposure prior to road trauma, severe trauma (defined by Injury Severity Score >15), and intensive care admission (ICU) or death, analyzed by logistic regression. Traffic offences directly leading to the road trauma admissions were excluded. Of the 10,330 patients included (median age 34 years-old, 78% male), 1955 (18.9%) had alcohol-exposure before road trauma, 2415 (23.4%) had severe trauma, 1360 (13.2%) required ICU admission, and 267 (2.6%) died. Prior traffic offences were recorded in 6269 (60.7%) patients. The number of prior traffic offences was significantly associated with alcohol-related road trauma (odds ratio [OR] per offence 1.03, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.05), severe trauma (OR 1.13, 95%CI 1.14-1.15), and ICU admission or death (OR 1.10, 95%CI 1.08-1.11). Drink-drinking, seat-belt, and use of handheld electronic device offences were specific offences strongly associated with road trauma leading to ICU admission or death--all in a 'dose-related' fashion. For those who recovered from road trauma after an ICU admission, there was a significant reduction in subsequent traffic offences (mean difference 1.8, 95%CI 1.5 to 2.0) and demerit points (mean difference 7.0, 95%CI 6.5 to 7.6) compared to before the trauma event.Previous traffic offences were a significant risk factor for alcohol-related road trauma and severe road trauma leading to ICU admission or death."

However, their effect on the physiologic functions of γ-secretase has not been tested in human model systems. γ-Secretase regulates fate determination of neural progenitor cells. Thus, we studied the impact of SGSMs on the neuronal differentiation of ReNcell VM (ReN) human neural progenitor cells (hNPCs). Quantitative PCR analysis showed that treatment of neurosphere-like ReN cell aggregate cultures with γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), but not SGSMs, induced a 2- to 4-fold increase in the expression of the neuronal markers Tuj1 and doublecortin. GSI treatment also induced neuronal marker protein expression, as shown by Western blot analysis. In the same conditions, SGSM treatment selectively reduced endogenous Aβ42 levels by ∼80%. Mechanistically, we found that Notch target gene expressions were selectively inhibited by a GSI, not by SGSM treatment. We can assert, for the first time, that SGSMs do not affect the neuronal differentiation of hNPCs while selectively decreasing endogenous Aβ42 levels in the same conditions. Our results suggest that our hNPC differentiation system can serve as a useful model to test the impact of GSIs and SGSMs on both endogenous Aβ levels and γ-secretase physiologic functions including endogenous Notch signaling."
https://openalex.org/W2018347723,"Despite their importance in nano-environmental health and safety, interactions between engineered nanomaterials and microbial life remain poorly characterized. Here, we used the model organism E. coli to study the penetration requirements, subcellular localization, induction of stress responses, and long-term fate of luminescent Mn-doped ZnS nanocrystals fabricated under “green” processing conditions with a minimized ZnS-binding protein. We find that such protein-coated quantum dots (QDs) are unable to penetrate the envelope of unmodified E. coli but readily translocate to the cytoplasm of cells that have been made competent by chemical treatment. The process is dose-dependent and reminiscent of bacterial transformation. Cells that have internalized up to 0.5 μg/mL of nanocrystals do not experience a significant activation of the unfolded protein or SOS responses but undergo oxidative stress when exposed to high QD doses (2.5 μg/mL). Finally, although they are stable in quiescent cells over temperatures ranging from 4 to 42°C, internalized QDs are rapidly diluted by cell division in a process that does not involve TolC-dependent efflux. Taken together, our results suggest that biomimetic QDs based on low toxicity inorganic cores capped by a protein shell are unlikely to cause significant damage to the microbial ecosystem."
https://openalex.org/W2078785212,"Background Management regimes for vegetation restoration of degraded grasslands can significantly affect the process of ecological succession. However, few studies have focused on variation in the soil seed bank during vegetation restoration under different management regimes, especially in saline-alkaline grassland habitats. Our aim was to provide insights into the ecological effects of grassland management regimes on soil seed bank composition and vegetation establishment in mown, fenced, transplanted and natural grassland sites, all dominated by the perennial rhizomatous grass Leymus chinensis. Methodology We studied species composition and diversity in both the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation in differently managed grasslands in Northeast China. An NMDS (nonmetric multidimensional scaling) was used to evaluate the relationship between species composition, soil seed banks, aboveground vegetation and soil properties. Principal Findings Fenced and mown grassland sites had high density and species richness in both the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation. The Transplanted treatment exhibited the highest vegetation growth and seed production of the target species L. chinensis. Seeds of L. chinensis in the soil occurred only in transplanted and natural grassland. Based on the NMDS analysis, the number of species in both the soil seed bank and aboveground vegetation were significantly related to soil Na+, Cl-, RSC (residual sodium carbonate), alkalinity, ESP (exchangeable sodium percentage) and AP (available phosphorus). Conclusions Soil seed bank composition and diversity in the saline-alkaline grassland were significantly affected by the management regimes implemented, and were also significantly related to the aboveground vegetation and several soil properties. Based on vegetative growth, reproductive output and maintenance of soil seed bank, the transplanting was identified as the most effective method for relatively rapid restoration of the target species L. chinensis. This approach could be beneficial for the restoration of dominant species in a wide range of degraded grassland ecosystems."
https://openalex.org/W2047609058,"In many different human cancers, one of the HRAS, NRAS, or KRAS genes in the RAS family of small GTPases acquires an oncogenic mutation that renders the encoded protein constitutively GTP-bound and thereby active, which is well established to promote tumorigenesis. In addition to oncogenic mutations, accumulating evidence suggests that the wild-type isoforms may also be activated and contribute to oncogenic RAS-driven tumorigenesis. In this regard, redox-dependent reactions with cysteine 118 (C118) have been found to promote activation of wild-type HRAS and NRAS. We sought to determine if this residue is also important for the activation of wild-type KRAS and promotion of tumorigenesis. Thus, we mutated C118 to serine (C118S) in wild-type KRAS to block redox-dependent reactions at this site. We now report that this mutation reduced the level of GTP-bound KRAS and impaired RAS signaling stimulated by the growth factor EGF. With regards to tumorigenesis, we also report that oncogenic HRAS-transformed human cells in which endogenous KRAS was knocked down and replaced with KRASC118S exhibited reduced xenograft tumor growth, as did oncogenic HRAS-transformed KrasC118S/C118S murine cells in which the C118S mutation was knocked into the endogenous Kras gene. Taken together, these data suggest a role for redox-dependent activation of wild-type KRAS through C118 in oncogenic HRAS-driven tumorigenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2072075761,"The serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates serotonergic neurotransmission by performing reuptake of released serotonin, and SERT is the primary target for antidepressants. SERT mediates the reuptake of serotonin through an alternating access mechanism, implying that a central substrate site is connected to both sides of the membrane by permeation pathways, of which only one is accessible at a time. The coordinated conformational changes in SERT associated with substrate translocation are not fully understood. Here, we have identified a Leu to Glu mutation at position 406 (L406E) in the extracellular loop 4 (EL4) of human SERT, which induced a remarkable gain-of-potency (up to >40-fold) for a range of SERT inhibitors. The effects were highly specific for L406E relative to six other mutations in the same position, including the closely related L406D mutation, showing that the effects induced by L406E are not simply charge-related effects. Leu406 is located >10 Å from the central inhibitor binding site indicating that the mutation affects inhibitor binding in an indirect manner. We found that L406E decreased accessibility to a residue in the cytoplasmic pathway. The shift in equilibrium to favor a more outward-facing conformation of SERT can explain the reduced turnover rate and increased association rate of inhibitor binding we found for L406E. Together, our findings show that EL4 allosterically can modulate inhibitor binding within the central binding site, and substantiates that EL4 has an important role in controlling the conformational equilibrium of human SERT.Background: The role of extracellular loop regions during substrate translocation in the serotonin transporter (SERT) is not well understood.Results: A mutation in the extracellular loop 4 of SERT disrupts the conformational equilibrium by favoring an outward-facing conformation.Conclusion: Extracellular loop 4 is important for conformational transitions in SERT.Significance: New insights are gained into the coordinated conformational changes associated with substrate translocation in SERT.

https://openalex.org/W2153392358,"Candidate biomarkers, indicative of disease or injury, are beginning to overwhelm the process of validation through immunological means. Recombinant antibodies developed through phage-display offer an alternative means of generating monoclonal antibodies faster than traditional immunization of animals. Peptide segments of putative biomarkers of laser induced injury in the rabbit, discovered through mass spectrometry, were used as targets for a selection against a library of phage-displayed human single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibodies. Highly specific antibodies were isolated to four of these unique peptide sequences. One antibody against the retinal protein, Guanine Nucleotide-Binding Protein Beta 5 (GBB5), had a dissociation constant ~300 nM and recognized the full-length endogenous protein in retinal homogenates of three different animal species by western blot. Alanine scanning of the peptide target identified three charged and one hydrophobic amino acid as the critical binding residues for two different scFvs. To enhance the utility of the reagent, one scFv was dimerized through a Fragment-crystallizable hinge region (i.e., Fc) and expressed in HEK-293 cells. This dimeric reagent yielded a 25-fold lower detection limit in western blots."
https://openalex.org/W2006801342,"Late Miocene ""Lake Pannon"" (~11.3 Ma) was a remnant of the Central Paratethyan Sea. Successive freshening and constantly changing environmental conditions, like oxygenation, nutrition and substrate led to a well-documented radiation in molluscs and ostracods. Among ostracods (small crustaceans), Cyprideis is one of the most common genera in ""Lake Pannon"", as well as in several other ancient lakes, showing numerous adaptations and speciations. Here, we present high-resolution data from an early transgression of ""Lake Pannon"" in the Eastern Styrian Basin (SE Austria). Mataschen clay pit is in the focus of geologic and paleontologic research since 20 years and its geologic and paleoecologic evolution is well-documented. We drilled five cores covering a ~2.3 m long section and completely sampled it in 5-mm thick intervals to reconstruct minute changes in the ostracod fauna over a transgression of a brackish water body. The dominant genus, Cyprideis, is represented by three species C. mataschensis, C. kapfensteinensis and C. ex gr. pannonica. Through morphometric analyses we highlight the variance of each taxon and suggest that there is no direct ecologic control on size or shape. Furthermore, we found a second, co-occurring morphotype of C. kapfensteinensis which is directly related to an elevation of salinities above 13 psu. The presence of two intermediate specimens between the two morphotypes in the sample directly below the first appearance of C. kapfensteinensis B leads us to the conclusion that we are facing a speciation event leading to four sympatric species of Cyprideis."
https://openalex.org/W2011291876,"RNA-Seq techniques generate hundreds of millions of short RNA reads using next-generation sequencing (NGS). These RNA reads can be mapped to reference genomes to investigate changes of gene expression but improved procedures for mining large RNA-Seq datasets to extract valuable biological knowledge are needed. RNAMiner—a multi-level bioinformatics protocol and pipeline—has been developed for such datasets. It includes five steps: Mapping RNA-Seq reads to a reference genome, calculating gene expression values, identifying differentially expressed genes, predicting gene functions, and constructing gene regulatory networks. To demonstrate its utility, we applied RNAMiner to datasets generated from Human, Mouse, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Drosophila melanogaster cells, and successfully identified differentially expressed genes, clustered them into cohesive functional groups, and constructed novel gene regulatory networks. The RNAMiner web service is available at http://calla.rnet.missouri.edu/rnaminer/index.html."
https://openalex.org/W2010704857,"Hiking is a demanding form of exercise that may cause delayed responses of the postural muscles and a loss of somatosensory information, particularly when repeatedly performed for several days. These effects may negatively influence the postural control of hikers. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a four-day hike on postural control. Twenty-six adults of both sexes travelled 262 kilometers, stopping for lunch and resting in the early evening each day. Force platforms were used to collect center of pressure (COP) data at 100 Hz for 70 seconds before hiking started and immediately after arriving at the rest station each day. The COP time course data were analyzed according to global stabilometric descriptors, spectral analysis and structural descriptors using sway density curve (SDC) and stabilometric diffusion analysis (SDA). Significant increases were found for global variables in both the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions (COP sway area, COP total sway path, COP mean velocity, COP root mean square value and COP range). In the spectral analysis, only the 80% power frequency (F80) in the anterior-posterior direction showed a significant increase, reflecting the increase of the sway frequencies. The SDC revealed a significant increase in the mean distance between peaks (MD) and a significant decrease in the mean peak amplitudes (MP), suggesting that a larger torque amplitude is required for stabilization and that the postural stability is reduced. The SDA revealed a decrease in the long-term slope (Hl) and increases in the short-term (Ks) and the long-term (Kl) intercepts. We considered the likelihood that the presence of local and general fatigue, pain and related neuromuscular adaptations and somatosensory deficits may have contributed to these postural responses. Together, these results demonstrated that four days of hiking increased sway frequencies and deteriorated postural control in the standing position."
https://openalex.org/W2033818742,"Previous researchers have tried to predict social and economic phenomena with indicators of public mood, which were extracted from online data. This method has been proved to be feasible in many areas such as financial markets, economic operations and even national suicide numbers. However, few previous researches have examined the relationship between public mood and consumption choices at society level. The present study paid attention to the ""Diaoyu Island"" event, and extracted Chinese public mood data toward Japan from Sina MicroBlog (the biggest social media in China), which demonstrated a significant cross-correlation between the public mood variable and sales of Sony cameras on Taobao (the biggest Chinese e-business company). Afterwards, several candidate predictors of sales were examined and finally three significant stepwise regression models were obtained. Results of models estimation showed that significance (F-statistics), R-square and predictive accuracy (MAPE) all improved due to inclusion of public mood variable. These results indicate that public mood is significantly associated with consumption choices and may be of value in sales forecasting for particular products."
https://openalex.org/W1981076993,"We identified a new holomycotrophic orchid that is related to the myco-heterotrophic Calypsoeae. Because chloroplast genes are primarily lacking or are highly divergent, key morphological characters are either reduced or lost from many myco-heterotrophs, and the phylogenetic relationships of weakly supported paraphyletic Calypsoeae within Epidendroideae have been poorly understood in previous molecular systematic studies. Using chloroplast rbcL, psaB, and matK and nuclear Xdh and ITS sequences, we determined the circumscription and systematic positions of the new orchid and the tribe. The results indicate that the epidendroid taxa include most of the clades that are successively sister to the grade of clades representing previously recognized tribes. Calypsoeae comprising four well-supported clades with 12 genera (except for the previous temporarily placed Wullschlaegelia) is supported as a monophyletic and sister clade to Epidendreae (excluding Coeliinae). The new orchid is nested in Calypsoeae and is a sister to Dactylostalix and/or Calypso. This new holomycotrophic orchid presents a subumbel inflorescence that grows underground, and flower with a long pedicel reputing the ground to open and two fragments at the base of the hook, which are obviously morphologically different from those of Calypsoeae. To accommodate this species in the current generic circumscription, a new genus Yunorchis was created."
https://openalex.org/W2001076892,"The knee is the weight-bearing joint most commonly associated with sports injuries, and therefore is most at risk of developing degenerative changes, including osteoarthritis. Skyrunners can be considered to be at risk of developing symptoms of post-traumatic osteoarthritis due to downhill running.The aim of this study was to analyze the health of the knee joints of a large group of these athletes via a specific self-report questionnaire.This study was carried out by asking the participants of seven official Skyraces (22.4±3.1 km length; 1596±393 m elevation) to fill out a questionnaire. Information regarding age, sex, downhill elevation (m) during training and competitions over the last month, and history of previous knee injury was also collected before the participants filled out the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS), which is a reliable and validated instrument designed to assess patients' opinions about their knees and associated problems that can result in post-traumatic osteoarthritis. Athletes were divided into six age groups (from 17 to 70 years) and 12 groups based on the downhill gradient they had covered over the last month (from 1,000 to 40,000 m).Six hundred twenty-one questionnaires were collected from 45% of the participants in the seven races. Multivariate analysis revealed that self-reported KOOS scores were unrelated to age, sex and monthly downhill gradient. Only 74 (12%) of the participants reported previous knee injuries. Significant differences in the five subscales of the KOOS were found between skyrunners with and without previous knee injuries (P<0.01).In the studied population, regular training for downhill running and participation in Skyraces could not be considered risk factors for subjective knee symptoms. Skyrunners with self-reported histories of knee injuries scored worse on all five subscales of the KOOS."
