The metabolic cost of movement is 904 joules per kilogram per meter, considerably more than that reported for other forms of locomotion. This high cost is primarily attributable to the production of the pedal mucus by which the slug adheres to the substratum."

The cloned viral DNA must be excised from the recombinant plasmid to infect, but need not be circularized and ligated in vitro. The cloned viral DNA lacks site-specific single-strand breaks found in DNA obtained directly from the virus. However, these breaks are reintroduced into the viral genome during multiplication of the virus in the plant host."

And yet the central importance of the notion appeared only during the last century-in a host of researches on special theories and on the foundations of geometry and analysis. Thus has arisen the general point of view of what may be called abstract mathematics. One comes in touch with the literature very conveniently by the mediation of Peano's Revue des Mathematiques.

General interest in abstract mathematics was aroused by Hil-mathematics was aroused by Hilbert's Gauss-Weber Festschrift of 1899: 'Ueber die Grundlagen der Geometrie,' a memoir rich in results and suggestive in methods; I refer to the reviews by Sommer,* Poincare,t Halsted,j Hedrick? and Veblen. 11 We have as a basal science logic, and as depending upon it the special deductive sciences which involve undefined symbols and whose propositions are not all capable of proof. The symbols denote either classes of 'elements or relations amongst elements. In any such science one may choose in various ways the system of undefined symbols and the system of undemonstrated or primitive propositions, or postulates. Every proposition follows from the postulates by a finite number of logical steps. A careful statement of the fundamental generalities is given by Padoa in a paperT? before the Paris Congress of Philosophy, 1900. Having in mind a definite system of undefined symbols and a definite system of postulates, we have first of all the notion of the compatibility of these postulates; that is, that it is impossible to prove by a finite number of logical steps the simultaneous validity of a statement and its contradictory statement; in the next place, the question of the independence of the postu* Bull.

Padoa introduces the notion of the irreducibility of the system of undefined symbols. A system of undefined symbols is said to be reducible if for one of the symbols, X, it is possible to establish, as a logical consequence of the assumption of the validity of the postulates, a nominal or symbolic definition of the form X A, where in the expression A there enter only the undefined symbols distinct from X. For the purpose of practical application, it seems to be desirable to modify the definition so as to call the system -of undefined symbols reducible if there is a nominal definition X -A of one of them X in terms of the others such that in any interpretation of the science the postulates retain their validity when instead of the initial interpretation of the symbol X there is placed the interpretation A of that symbol. If the system of symbols is reducible in the sense of the original definition it is in the sense' of the new definition, but not necessarily conversely, as appears for instance from the following example, occur-ring in the foundations of geometry. Hilbert uses the following undefined symbols: 'point, ' line,' 'plane,' ' incidence' of point and line, 'incidence' of point and plane, 'between,' and 'congruent.' Now it is possible to give for the symbol 'plane' a symbolic definition in terms of the other, undefined symbols-for instance, a plane is a certain class of points (as Peano showed in 1892), or again, a plane is a certain class of lines; while the notion 'incidence' of point and plane receives convenient definition. It is apparent from the fact that these definitions may be given in these two ways that Hilbert's system of undefined symbols is not in Padoa 's sense irreducible, at least, in so far as the symbols 'plane,' 'incidence' of point and plane are 402 SCIENCE.

https://openalex.org/W2072610425,"Bacterial luciferase activity was detected in light organ extracts of squids, fishes, and pyrosomes, suggesting that these systems are derived from bacteria-animal symbioses. In none of these cases was it possible to culture luminouis bacteria. Analyses of the decay kinetics show that the luciferases from the squid, ceratioid, and pyrosome light organs are all similar to bacterial luciferases from the genus Photobacterium, while those from the anomalopid light organs are different."

https://openalex.org/W2086541670,Two species of mesopelagic squid greatly altered the color of their bio-luminescence during counterillumination. The color change was triggered by changes in water temperature corresponding to those normally encountered by these vertically migrating animals. These squid can probably conceal themselves under the different colors of downwelling light that they encounter in their day and night habitats.

These data and the nonvesicularity of ash fragments are indicative of only a small eruptive magmatic component. The low amounts of soluble fluorine on the ashes pose no health problems. Violent magmatic activity is possible, and thus continued geochemical monitoring is advised."
https://openalex.org/W1989609128,"Many reactions catalyzed by soluble transition metal compounds proceed by way of organometallic intermediates, even though the original catalyst may be a simple salt. This generality is illustrated for three industrial syntheses of acetic acid that use homogeneous catalysts. Some developments in organometallic chemistry that may extend the utility of homogeneous catalysis are photoactivation of catalysts and the recognition of the importance of metallacyclic intermediates."
https://openalex.org/W2071132391,"Ophiolites are conventionally regarded as fragments of former oceanic lithosphere. Mineralogical and field evidence indicates that peridotite of the Neyriz ophiolite was intruded at high temperature into folded crystalline limestones, forming skarns. This excludes the formation of the ophiolite at a mid-ocean ridge but is consistent with its origin by intrusion during continental rifting."
