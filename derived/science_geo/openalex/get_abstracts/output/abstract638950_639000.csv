https://openalex.org/W2971662497,"Inferring the full genealogical history of a set of DNA sequences is a core problem in evolutionary biology, because this history encodes information about the events and forces that have influenced a species. However, current methods are limited, and the most accurate techniques are able to process no more than a hundred samples. As datasets that consist of millions of genomes are now being collected, there is a need for scalable and efficient inference methods to fully utilize these resources. Here we introduce an algorithm that is able to not only infer whole-genome histories with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art but also process four orders of magnitude more sequences. The approach also provides an 'evolutionary encoding' of the data, enabling efficient calculation of relevant statistics. We apply the method to human data from the 1000 Genomes Project, Simons Genome Diversity Project and UK Biobank, showing that the inferred genealogies are rich in biological signal and efficient to process."
https://openalex.org/W2971881424,"Changes in mitochondrial size and shape have been implicated in several physiologic processes, but their role in mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake regulation and overall cellular Ca2+ homeostasis is largely unknown. Here we show that modulating mitochondrial dynamics toward increased fusion through expression of a dominant negative (DN) form of the fission protein [dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1)] markedly increased both mitochondrial Ca2+ retention capacity and Ca2+ uptake rates in permeabilized C2C12 cells. Similar results were seen using the pharmacological fusion-promoting M1 molecule. Conversely, promoting a fission phenotype through the knockdown of the fusion protein mitofusin (MFN)-2 strongly reduced the mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake speed and capacity in these cells. These changes were not dependent on modifications in mitochondrial calcium uniporter expression, inner membrane potentials, or the mitochondrial permeability transition. Implications of mitochondrial morphology modulation on cellular calcium homeostasis were measured in intact cells; mitochondrial fission promoted lower basal cellular calcium levels and lower endoplasmic reticulum (ER) calcium stores, as indicated by depletion with thapsigargin. Indeed, mitochondrial fission was associated with ER stress. Additionally, the calcium-replenishing process of store-operated calcium entry was impaired in MFN2 knockdown cells, whereas DRP1-DN-promoted fusion resulted in faster cytosolic Ca2+ increase rates. Overall, our results show a novel role for mitochondrial morphology in the regulation of mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake, which impacts cellular Ca2+ homeostasis.-Kowaltowski, A. J., Menezes-Filho, S. L., Assali, E. A., Gonçalves, I. G., Cabral-Costa, J. V., Abreu, P., Miller, N., Nolasco, P., Laurindo, F. R. M., Bruni-Cardoso, A., Shirihai, O. Mitochondrial morphology regulates organellar Ca2+ uptake and changes cellular Ca2+ homeostasis."
https://openalex.org/W2971507339,"Chemotherapy resistance is one of the most common causes of death among patients with ovarian cancer, and identifying novel antitumor agents is a priority. Here, we report that the novel molecule 2-(anaphthoyl)ethyltrimethylammonium iodide (α-NETA) induces epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) cell pyroptosis through the gesdermin-d (GSDMD)/caspase-4 pathway. Furthermore, Cell Counting Kit-8 fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis showed that α-NETA treatment led to cell death in different ovarian cancer cell lines, including Ho8910, Ho8910PM, and A2780. Morphologic examination by electron microscopy indicated that cells treated with α-NETA produced multiple microbubbles, typical of cells undergoing pyroptosis. α-NETA also significantly increased expression of pyroptosis-associated molecules including caspase-4 and GSDMD in EOC cells. Knockdown of either caspase-4 or GSDMD in ovarian cancer cells strongly interfered with α-NETA cell-killing activity, indicating that α-NETA acts through the pyroptosis pathway. In vivo, α-NETA treatment dramatically decreased the size of EOC tumors in mice. Our findings suggest that α-NETA represents a potential new antitumor molecule or lead compound for EOC chemotherapy.-Qiao, L., Wu, X., Zhang, J., Liu, L., Sui, X., Zhang, R., Liu, W., Shen, F., Sun, Y., Xi, X. α-NETA induces pyroptosis of epithelial ovarian cancer cells through the GSDMD/caspase-4 pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2971943538,"Functional variability among boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is well recognised and complicates interpretation of clinical studies. We hypothesised that boys with DMD could be clustered into groups sharing similar trajectories of ambulatory function over time, as measured by the North Star Ambulatory Assessment (NSAA) total score. We also explored associations with other variables such as age, functional abilities, and genotype. Using the NorthStar Clinical Network database, 395 patients with >1 NSAA assessment were identified. We utilised latent class trajectory analysis of longitudinal NSAA scores, which produced evidence for at least four clusters of boys sharing similar trajectories versus age in decreasing order of clinical severity: 25% of the boys were in cluster 1 (NSAA falling to ≤ 5 at age ~10y), 35% were in cluster 2 (NSAA ≤ 5 ~12y), 21% in were cluster 3 (NSAA≤ 5 ~14y), and 19% in cluster 4 (NSAA > 5 up to 15y). Mean ages at diagnosis of DMD were similar across clusters (4.2, 3.9, 4.3, and 4.8y, respectively). However, at the first NSAA assessment, a significant (p<0.05) association was observed between earlier declining clusters and younger age, worse NSAA, slower rise from supine, slower 10 metre walk/run times, and younger age of steroid initiation. In order to assess the probability of observing complete loss of function for individual NSAA items, we examined the proportion of patients who shifted from a score of 1 or 2 at baseline to a score of 0. We also assessed the probability of gain of function using the inverse assessment and stratified the probability of deterioration, improvement-or static behavior-by age ranges and using baseline functional status. Using this tool, our study provides a comprehensive assessment of the NSAA in a large population of patients with DMD and, for the first time, describes discrete clusters of disease progression; this will be invaluable for future DMD clinical trial design and interpretation of findings."

Expansion of commensal ecology after birth is a critical period in human immune development. However, the initial fungal colonization of the primordial gut remains undescribed. To investigate primordial fungal ecology, we performed amplicon sequencing and culture-based techniques of first-pass meconium, which forms in the intestine prior to birth, from a prospective observational cohort of term and preterm newborns. Here, we describe fungal ecologies in the primordial gut that develop complexity with advancing gestational age at birth. Our findings suggest homeostasis of fungal commensals may represent an important aspect of human biology present even before birth. Unlike bacterial communities that gradually develop complexity, the domination of the fungal communities of some preterm infants by Saccromycetes, specifically Candida, may suggest a pathologic association with preterm birth.-Willis, K.

However, accurate viral and immunologic markers to predict clinical outcomes of this patient population are still lacking. Droplet digital PCR assays for influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were designed and performed in 64 respiratory samples from 23 patients with influenza virus infection and 73 samples from 19 patients with RSV infection. Samples of patients with hematologic malignancies, solid tumors, or sickle cell disease were included. Clinical information from institutional medical records was reviewed to assess disease severity. Samples from patients with fever or respiratory symptoms had a significantly higher viral loads than those from asymptomatic patients. Samples from patients with influenza virus and RSV infection collected at presentation had significantly higher viral loads than those collected from patients after completing a course of oseltamivir or ribavirin, respectively. RSV loads correlated positively with clinical symptoms in patients ≤5 years of age, whereas influenza viral loads were associated with clinical symptoms, irrespective of age. Patients receiving antivirals for influenza and RSV had a significant reduction in viral loads after completing therapy. Digital PCR offers an effective method to monitor the efficacy of antiviral treatment for respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts."
https://openalex.org/W2971857028,"Nowhere has the scale and scope of urbanization been larger than in China over the last few decades. We analyze Chinese city development between the years 1996 and 2014 using data for the urbanized components of prefecture-level cities. We show that, despite much variability and fast economic and demographic change, China is undergoing transformations similar to the historical trajectory of other urban systems. We also show that the distinguishing signs of urban economies—superlinear scaling of agglomeration effects in economic productivity and economies of scale in land use—also characterize Chinese cities. We then analyze the structure of economic change in Chinese cities using a variety of metrics, characterizing employment, firms and households. Population size estimates remain a major challenge for Chinese cities, as official numbers are often reported based on the Hukou registration system. We use the information in the residuals to scaling relations for economic quantities to predict actual resident population and show that these estimates agree well with data for a subset of cities for which counts of total resident population exist. We conclude with a list of issues that must be better understood and measured to make sense of present urban development trajectories in China."

The underpinning metabolic pathways that support the biosynthesis of these specialized chemicals in divergent plant species provide a rich arena for understanding the molecular evolution of complex metabolic traits. Rosmarinic acid (RA) is a phenolic natural product first discovered in plants of the mint family (Lamiaceae) and is recognized for its wide range of medicinal properties and potential applications in human dietary and medical interventions. Interestingly, the RA chemotype is present sporadically in multiple taxa of flowering plants as well as some hornworts and ferns, prompting the question whether its biosynthesis arose independently across different lineages. Here we report the elucidation of the RA biosynthetic pathway in Phacelia campanularia (desert bells). This species represents the borage family (Boraginaceae), an RA-producing family closely related to the Lamiaceae within the Lamiids clade. Using a multi-omics approach in combination with functional characterization of candidate genes both in vitro and in vivo, we found that RA biosynthesis in P. campanularia involves specific activities of a BAHD acyltransferase and two cytochrome P450 hydroxylases. Further phylogenetic and comparative structure–function analyses of the P. campanularia RA biosynthetic enzymes clearly indicate that RA biosynthesis has evolved independently at least twice in the Lamiids, an exemplary case of chemotypic convergence through disparate evolutionary trajectories.

Additionally, RA is an inhibitor of GABA transaminase and therefore serves as an antianxiety agent by modulating GABA levels in the central nervous system (15Awad R. Muhammad A. Durst T. Trudeau V.L. Arnason J.T. Bioassay-guided fractionation of lemon balm (Melissa officinalis L.) using an in vitro measure of GABA transaminase activity.Phytother.

RA is also an inhibitor of indoleamine-pyrrole 2,3-dioxygenase, which is an immune checkpoint molecule and has recently emerged as an important target for cancer immunotherapy (16Lee H.J. Jeong Y.-I.

The potential utility of RA as a therapeutic agent and in other biotechnological applications has propelled research regarding RA biosynthesis in Lamiaceae (17Bulgakov V.P. Inyushkina Y.V.

The resolved RA biosynthetic pathway from Coleus blumei (Lamiaceae) consists of a specialized acyltransferase, rosmarinic acid synthase (RAS), and a cytochrome P450 meta-hydroxylase, CYP98A14 (18Berger A.

Rosmarinic acid synthase is a new member of the superfamily of BAHD acyltransferases.Planta. 2006; 224 (17047986): 1503-151010.1007/s00425-006-0393-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Eberle D.

First, RAS catalyzes the transfer of the 4-coumaroyl acyl group from 4-coumaroyl-CoA to the acyl acceptor molecule (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate to produce 4-coumaroyl-(R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate, and CYP98A14 subsequently catalyzes a single meta-hydroxylation reaction on each of the aromatic rings of 4-coumaroyl-(R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate to yield RA (Fig. 2A) (18Berger A.

Rosmarinic acid synthase is a new member of the superfamily of BAHD acyltransferases.Planta. 2006; 224 (17047986): 1503-151010.1007/s00425-006-0393-yCrossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Eberle D.

Although common in the Lamiaceae, RA is a specialized metabolite that is distributed only sporadically throughout the plant kingdom (Fig. 1), primarily within angiosperms but also in some ferns and hornworts (20Petersen M. Abdullah Y. Benner J. Eberle D. Gehlen K. Hücherig S. Janiak V. Kim K.H. Sander M. Weitzel C. Wolters S. Evolution of rosmarinic acid biosynthesis.Phytochemistry. 2009; 70 (19560175): 1663-167910.1016/j.phytochem.2009.05.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This scattered taxonomic distribution pattern in land plants suggests the complex evolutionary history of RA biosynthesis. RA biosynthesis could have emerged once in early land plants and subsequently been lost in many taxa. Independent loss of ancestral metabolic traits has been well-documented in the case of pale beach mice, where the light pigment phenotypes of beach mouse populations from different parts of the world have been found to be caused by independently arising mutations (21Manceau M. Domingues V.S. Linnen C.R. Rosenblum E.B. Hoekstra H.E. Convergence in pigmentation at multiple levels: mutations, genes and function.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2010; 365 (20643733): 2439-245010.1098/rstb.2010.0104Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). Alternatively, RA biosynthesis might have evolved independently multiple times during land plant evolution, which has been a common evolutionary phenomenon in plant-specialized metabolism (22Pichersky E. Lewinsohn E. Convergent evolution in plant specialized metabolism.Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2011; 62 (21275647): 549-56610.1146/annurev-arplant-042110-103814Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To date, there is no sufficient evidence to distinguish between these two evolutionary scenarios. Here we examined a family of plants within the Lamiids clade, closely related to Lamiaceae: the borage family (Boraginaceae, order Boraginales). Previous studies have demonstrated that many sampled members of the Boraginaceae also produce RA, like the Lamiaceae (20Petersen M. Abdullah Y. Benner J. Eberle D. Gehlen K. Hücherig S. Janiak V.

In contrast, plants from Solanales, an order immediately sister to Boraginales (Fig. 1), are not RA producers (20Petersen M. Abdullah Y. Benner J. Eberle D. Gehlen K. Hücherig S. Janiak V. Kim K.H. Sander M. Weitzel C. Wolters S. Evolution of rosmarinic acid biosynthesis.Phytochemistry. 2009; 70 (19560175): 1663-167910.1016/j.phytochem.2009.05.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). Notably, no other family under the order Lamiales besides the Lamiaceae has been shown to produce RA (20Petersen M. Abdullah Y. Benner J. Eberle D. Gehlen K. Hücherig S. Janiak V. Kim K.H. Sander M. Weitzel C. Wolters S. Evolution of rosmarinic acid biosynthesis.Phytochemistry. 2009; 70 (19560175): 1663-167910.1016/j.phytochem.2009.05.010Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This intriguing distribution of RA in taxa closely related to and within the Lamiids led us to investigate the biosynthetic origin of RA in Boraginaceae. Using a candidate-based approach, we discovered the RA biosynthetic pathway in the Boraginaceae plant Phacelia campanularia and provide substantial evidence supporting independent evolution of RA in two closely related Lamiid families. To study RA biosynthesis in the Boraginaceae family, a little-studied family of nonmodel plants, we selected P. campanularia, colloquially known as desert bells or California bluebells, as our experimental species (Fig. 1). P. campanularia grows easily in standard greenhouses, and its transcriptome has been sequenced previously through the 1000 Plants (1KP) initiative (26Matasci N. Hung L.-H. Yan Z. Carpenter E.J.

Using LC high-resolution accurate-mass MS-based metabolic profiling, we confirmed that laboratory-grown P. campanularia produces RA (Fig. S1A). We hypothesized that the Boraginaceae RAS, like that of Lamiaceae, is a relatively highly expressed BAHD acyltransferase and mined the P. campanularia transcriptome for genes that fit this criteria (Table S1) (18Berger A.

Of the top 20 most highly expressed BAHD acyltransferase-encoding genes, the 15 that harbored full-length ORFs were cloned and transiently expressed in the leaf tissue of Nicotiana benthamiana using Agrobacterium-mediated infiltration (29Sainsbury F. Thuenemann E.C. Lomonossoff G.P. pEAQ: versatile expression vectors for easy and quick transient expression of heterologous proteins in plants.Plant Biotechnol.

Of all 15 candidates tested, only the second most highly expressed P. campanularia BAHD gene yielded the RAS product; it is hereafter referred to as PcRAS (Table S1 and Fig. 3, A and C). Molecular phylogenetic analysis of PcRAS together with other related BAHD acyltransferases from a variety of plant species revealed a Boraginaceae-specific RAS clade distinct from the Lamiaceae RAS clade (Fig. 2B). Although Lamiaceae RAS enzymes appear to have evolved from the hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:shikimate hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (HCTs), which produce 4-coumaroyl shikimate, a key intermediate in the conserved plant phenylpropanoid metabolism, Boraginaceae RAS enzymes share an ancestor with the spermidine hydroxycinnamoyltransferases (SHTs), which produce hydroxycinnamoylspermidine conjugates reported to accumulate in the pollen coat of Arabidopsis thaliana (30D'Auria J.C.

Compared with most of the BAHD enzymes represented in the phylogeny, which accept negatively charged acyl acceptor substrates, SHT is unique because it prefers the positively charged acyl acceptor spermidine. Although BAHD acyltransferases are well-recognized for their relaxed substrate selectivity, they tend to be specific with regard to the charge identity of their acyl acceptor substrates, as this property is generally dictated by the electrostatic properties of the acyl acceptor binding pocket within the enzyme active site (35Sander M. Petersen M.

It is therefore intriguing that Boraginaceae RAS, which has evolved to accommodate the negatively charged acyl acceptor substrate (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate, is closely related to SHT. Functional analysis demonstrated that PcRAS does not retain SHT function, suggesting that it has lost its ancestral activity (Fig. S2). Our phylogenetic analysis also revealed that P. campanularia contains a presumed ortholog of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:quinate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (HQT), which is involved in chlorogenic acid biosynthesis (37Ulbrich B. Zenk M.H. Partial purification and properties of hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA: quinate hydroxycinnamoyl transferase from higher plants.Phytochemistry. 1979; 18: 929-93310.1016/S0031-9422(00)91451-1Crossref Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Indeed, metabolic profiling of P. campanularia leaf tissue revealed the presence of chlorogenic acid (Fig. S1B). Our enzymatic assays further confirmed the activity of PcHQT (Fig. 4A). To complete our model of RA biosynthesis, we took an example from the Lamiaceae pathway, hypothesizing that the Boraginaceae 4-coumaroyl-(R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate meta-hydroxylases descended from the highly conserved 4-coumaroyl ester 3′-hydroxylase (C3′H) (19Eberle D. Ullmann P. Werck-Reichhart D. Petersen M. cDNA cloning and functional characterisation of CYP98A14 and NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase from Coleus blumei involved in rosmarinic acid biosynthesis.Plant Mol. Biol. 2009; 69 (18982412): 239-25310.1007/s11103-008-9420-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). C3′H belongs to the CYP98A family of P450s and catalyzes the first meta-hydroxylation of the key phenylpropanoid pathway intermediate 4-coumaroyl shikimate (34Weng J.-K. Chapple C. The origin and evolution of lignin biosynthesis.New Phytol. 2010; 187 (20642725): 273-28510.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03327.xCrossref PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar). Our phylogenetic analyses of P450s related to C3′H from a variety of plant species revealed two Boraginaceae-specific clades (Fig. 2C) distinct from the conserved C3′H clade and the clade containing known Lamiaceae 4-coumaroyl-(R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate meta-hydroxylases (19Eberle D. Ullmann P. Werck-Reichhart D. Petersen M. cDNA cloning and functional characterisation of CYP98A14 and NADPH: cytochrome P450 reductase from Coleus blumei involved in rosmarinic acid biosynthesis.Plant Mol. Biol. 2009; 69 (18982412): 239-25310.1007/s11103-008-9420-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We designated the two presumed P. campanularia orthologs from each of these Boraginaceae-specific clades PcCYP98A112 and PcCYP98A113, and the presumed P. campanularia ortholog of C3′H was designated PcCYP98A111 (Table S2). To test the function of these newly identified P. campanularia P450s, we coinfiltrated combinations of PcRAS, PcCYP98A112, and PcCYP98A113, as well as PcHQT and PcCYP98A111 as negative controls, into N. benthamiana leaves in the presence or absence of the RA precursors 4-coumarate and (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate (Fig. 3). Although neither PcHQT nor PcCYP98A111 produced any on-pathway RA intermediates, transgenic expression of PcRAS was sufficient to produce 4-coumaroyl-(R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate (Fig. 3, A and C). The in planta function of PcRAS was further corroborated by stable transgenic expression of PcRAS in A. thaliana (Fig. 3D). Additionally, coinfiltration of PcRAS, PcCYP98A112, and PcCYP98A113 was sufficient to produce RA in a substrate-dependent manner (Fig. 3, B and C). Interestingly, the combination of PcRAS and PcCYP98A113, excluding PcCYP98A112, was sufficient to produce small quantities of RA. This observation suggests that an endogenous N. benthamiana meta-hydroxylase, perhaps the conserved C3′H, may be able to perform some degree of PcCYP98A112 function, especially in the presence of excess substrate. This is consistent with the observation that PcCYP98A112 is phylogenetically more closely related to C3′H (Fig. 2C). PcCYP98A113, on the other hand, exhibits a more distant phylogenetic pattern, reflected in the relative length of the branch to the CYP98A113 clade, and also appears to have a more specialized biochemical function. We expressed and purified recombinant PcHCT, PcHQT, and PcRAS from E. coli and carried out Michaelis–Menten kinetics assays (Fig. 4A and Table 1) to examine the substrate specificity of these enzymes toward a panel of acyl acceptor compounds in the presence of 4-coumaroyl-CoA as the common acyl donor at a saturating concentration, chosen based on previously reported Km values for HCT and RAS enzymes (27Landmann C. Hücherig S. Fink B. Hoffmann T. Dittlein D. Coiner H.A. Schwab W. Substrate promiscuity of a rosmarinic acid synthase from lavender (Lavandula angustifolia L.).Planta. 2011; 234 (21424826): 305-32010.1007/s00425-011-1400-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 38Walker A.M.

As expected, PcHCT, PcHQT, and PcRAS were specific toward shikimate, quinate, and (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate, respectively. However, we observed that both the Km and Vmax measured for PcRAS against (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate were inferior relative to CbRAS (Table S3) and those reported in the literature for other Lamiaceae RASs, demonstrating that PcRAS may not be as catalytically efficient under our experimental conditions (27Landmann C.

To rule out the possibility that an alternative substrate is preferred by PcRAS, we screened many possible variations in acyl donor and acyl acceptor compounds in accordance with possible RA pathway intermediates as well as different acyl acceptor stereoisomers (Fig. S3). Additionally, we quantified the absolute RA content across multiple tissues of C. blumei (Lamiaceae) and P. campanularia, ruling out the possibility that P. campanularia produces significantly lower quantities of RA than a Lamiaceae plant (Table S4). Collectively, these results suggest that, despite kinetic parameters differing from those of Lamiaceae RASs, PcRAS is likely sufficient to support RA accumulation in vivo. Alternatively, there may be additional levels of regulation that improve the catalytic efficiency of PcRAS in vivo.Table 1Summary of kinetic parameters derived from Michaelis-Menten ki"

Methods Data was collected from ninety-four players who participated in the study (age: 17.4 ± 0.74 years; height: 199.0 ± 0.1 cm; body mass: 87.1 ± 13.1 kg) competing in the Euroleague Basketball Next Generation Tournament. Players’ movements during the games were measured using a portable local positioning system (LPS) (WIMU PRO®, Realtrack Systems SL, Almería, Spain) and included relative distance (total distance / playing duration), relative distance in established speed zones, high-intensity running (18.1–24.0 km·h-1) and sprinting (> 24.1 km·h-1). player load, peak speed (km·h-1) and peak acceleration (m·s-2) number of total accelerations and total decelerations, high intensity accelerations (> 2 m·s-2) and decelerations (< -2 m·s-2). Results There was an overall decrease in distance covered, player load, number of high intensity accelerations and decelerations between the first and last quarter of the games in all playing positions. A classification tree analysis showed that the first quarter had much influence of distance covered (above 69.0 meters), distance covered <6.0 km·h-1 and accelerations (> 2 m·s-2), whereas the fourth quarter performance had much influence of distance covered (below 69.0) and distance covered 12.1–18.0 km·h-1. Conclusions A significant reduction in physical demands occurs during basketball, especially between first and last quarter for players in all playing positions during basketball games of under 18 elite players."
https://openalex.org/W2972267467,"The aims of this study were to analyze the shoulder functional profile of young male and female tennis players and to establish the relationship among physical variables and serve speed.A total of 128 Spanish tennis players (Under-13 (n = 32/32 males/females) and Under-15 (n = 36/28 males/females), were tested during National training camps. Tests included passive shoulder range of motion (ROM) for both internal (IR) and external rotation (ER) and isometric strength (i.e., IR and ER) of the dominant/non-dominant shoulders, medicine ball throws (MBT), and serve speed. Age and sex pairwise comparisons were carried using the Hedges' g index (dg).Results showed age and sex effects on serve speed and all MBT, with males showing greater changes (1.51≤dg≤1.98) with age than females (0.92≤dg≤1.35; p<0.05). U15 males showed higher (p<0.05) absolute shoulder IR and ER strength than U13, with only significant differences between males and females in the U15. Regarding ROM, U15 males showed a decreased IR ROM compared to U13 (dg = -0.84; p<0.05) and higher significant IR bilateral deficit (dg = 0.51; p<0.05). The distances obtained in the different MBT were the variables more correlated to serve speed.The present results suggest that shoulder strength, medicine ball throws and serve speed increased along with age in young elite tennis players of both sexes. However, a decreased range of motion and bilateral deficit for glenohumeral internal rotation is evident in male under-15 tennis players. Muscle strength, power and shoulder range of motion are key factors for serve speed in young tennis players."

Here, an enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) approach in fibroblasts from GM1 gangliosidosis patients with recombinant human β-gal (rhβ-gal) produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells enabled direct and precise rhβ-gal delivery to acidified lysosomes. A single, low dose (3 nm) of rhβ-gal was sufficient for normalizing β-gal activity and mediating substrate clearance for several weeks. We found that rhβ-gal uptake by the fibroblasts is dose-dependent and saturable and can be competitively inhibited by mannose 6-phosphate, suggesting cation-independent, mannose 6-phosphate receptor-mediated endocytosis from the cell surface. A single intracerebroventricularly (ICV) administered dose of rhβ-gal (100 μg) resulted in broad bilateral biodistribution of rhβ-gal to critical regions of pathology in a mouse model of GM1 gangliosidosis. Weekly ICV dosing of rhβ-gal for 8 weeks substantially reduced brain levels of ganglioside and oligosaccharide substrates and reversed well-established secondary neuropathology. Of note, unlike with the ERT approach, chronic lentivirus-mediated GLB1 overexpression in the GM1 gangliosidosis patient fibroblasts caused accumulation of a prelysosomal pool of β-gal, resulting in activation of the unfolded protein response and endoplasmic reticulum stress. This outcome was unsurprising in light of our in vitro biophysical findings for rhβ-gal, which include pH-dependent and concentration-dependent stability and dynamic self-association. Collectively, our results highlight that ICV-ERT is an effective therapeutic intervention for managing GM1 gangliosidosis potentially more safely than with gene therapy approaches."
https://openalex.org/W2972007009,"Freshly isolated, uncultured, autologous adipose derived regenerative cells (ADRCs) have emerged as a promising tool for regenerative cell therapy. The Transpose RT system (InGeneron, Inc., Houston, TX, USA) is a system for isolating ADRCs from adipose tissue, commercially available in Europe as a CE-marked medical device and under clinical evaluation in the United States. This system makes use of the proprietary, enzymatic Matrase Reagent for isolating cells. The present study addressed the question whether the use of Matrase Reagent influences cell yield, cell viability, live cell yield, biological characteristics, physiological functions or structural properties of the ADRCs in final cell suspension. Identical samples of subcutaneous adipose tissue from 12 subjects undergoing elective lipoplasty were processed either with or without the use of Matrase Reagent. Then, characteristics of the ADRCs in the respective final cell suspensions were evaluated. Compared to non-enzymatic isolation, enzymatic isolation resulted in approximately twelve times higher mean cell yield (i.e., numbers of viable cells/ml lipoaspirate) and approximately 16 times more colony forming units. Despite these differences, cells isolated from lipoaspirate both with and without the use of Matrase Reagent were independently able to differentiate into cells of all three germ layers. This indicates that biological characteristics, physiological functions or structural properties relevant for the intended use were not altered or induced using Matrase Reagent. A comprehensive literature review demonstrated that isolation of ADRCs from lipoaspirate using the Transpose RT system and the Matrase Reagent results in the highest viable cell yield among published data regarding isolation of ADRCs from lipoaspirate."
https://openalex.org/W2971688050,"Background Recent studies are suggesting a U-shaped relationship between antenatal iron exposure and birth outcomes. Little is known about the iron status and associated birth outcomes of pregnant women in South Africa. Our aim was to assess iron status at early, mid- and late pregnancy, and to determine associations with gestational age and birth weight in women in Johannesburg, South Africa. Methods In this prospective study of 250 pregnant women, we measured haemoglobin, biomarkers of iron status and inflammation at <18, 22 and 36 weeks of gestation, plus birth weight and gestational age at delivery. Associations of anaemia and iron status with birth outcomes were determined using regression models adjusted for confounders. Results At enrolment, the prevalence of anaemia, iron depletion (ID) and iron deficiency erythropoiesis (IDE) was 29%, 15% and 15%, respectively, and increased significantly with pregnancy progression. Anaemia and ID at 22 weeks, as well as IDE at 36 weeks were associated with higher birth weight (β = 135.4; 95% CI: 4.8, 266.1 and β = 205.4; 95% CI: 45.6, 365.1 and β = 178.0; 95% CI: 47.3, 308.7, respectively). Women in the lowest ferritin quartile at 22 weeks gave birth to babies weighing 312 g (95% CI: 94.8, 528.8) more than those in the highest quartile. In contrast, IDE at 22 weeks was associated with a higher risk for premature birth (OR: 3.57, 95% CI: 1.24, 10.34) and women in lower haemoglobin quartiles at <18 weeks had a shorter gestation by 7 days (β = -6.9, 95% CI: -13.3, -0.6) compared to those in the highest quartile. Conclusion Anaemia, ID and IDE prevalence increased during pregnancy despite routine iron supplementation. ID and anaemia at mid-pregnancy were associated with higher birth weight, while IDE was associated with premature birth. These results suggest that current antenatal screening and supplementation practices in South Africa need to be revisited."
https://openalex.org/W2971921627,"Because of climate change, heat stress (HS) causes more and more impacts on dairy animals to decrease lactation performance. The neuroendocrine system is key in regulating systemic physiological processes and milk synthesis. However, the hypothalamic-pituitary axis response to HS is still unclear. In this study, a group of lactating mice underwent a daily 2-h heat treatment (36°C) for 14 d to explore possible cross-talk between the hypothalamic-pituitary axis and mammary gland under HS. Transcriptome analyses by multitissue RNA-Seq indicated the possible mechanisms of reduced lactation performance in animals under HS. In the hypothalamus, the cAMP signaling pathway was activated to resist neuronal death, and the expression of downstream genes was increased to promote cell survival under HS. Reduced food intake might be caused by down-regulated appetite-related peptide, whereas up-regulated neuropeptide Y acted to attenuate reduced food intake. In pituitary, energy stress from lower food intake might result in reduced secretion of prolactin and growth hormone. Under HS, the mammary gland may undergo hypoxic stress, causing mammary epithelial cell apoptosis. Together, these data showed systemic changes in tissues to accommodate the effects of HS on lactation.-Han, J., Shao, J., Chen, Q., Sun, H., Guan, L., Li, Y., Liu, J., Liu, H.

https://openalex.org/W2971768733,"Whole mitogenome sequences (mtDNA) have been exploited for insect ecology studies, using them as molecular markers to reconstruct phylogenies, or to infer phylogeographic relationships and gene flow. Recent Anopheles phylogenomic studies have provided information regarding the time of deep lineage divergences within the genus. Here we report the complete 15,393 bp mtDNA sequences of Anopheles aquasalis, a Neotropical human malaria vector. When comparing its structure and base composition with other relevant and available anopheline mitogenomes, high similarity and conserved genomic features were observed. Furthermore, 22 mtDNA sequences comprising anopheline and Dipteran sibling species were analyzed to reconstruct phylogenies and estimate dates of divergence between taxa. Phylogenetic analysis using complete mtDNA sequences suggests that A. aquasalis diverged from the Anopheles albitarsis complex ~28 million years ago (MYA), and ~38 MYA from Anopheles darlingi. Bayesian analysis suggests that the most recent ancestor of Nyssorhynchus and Anopheles + Cellia was extant ~83 MYA, corroborating current estimates of ~79–100 MYA. Additional sampling and publication of African, Asian, and North American anopheline mitogenomes would improve the resolution of the Anopheles phylogeny and clarify early continental dispersal routes."

Previously, we reported that tumor necrosis factor-α time-dependently alters CLDN-2 expression in tubular epithelial cells. Here, we found a similar expression pattern in a mouse kidney injury model (unilateral ureteral obstruction), consisting of an initial increase followed by a drop in CLDN-2 protein expression. CLDN-2 silencing in LLC-PK1 tubular cells induced activation and phosphorylation of guanine nucleotide exchange factor H1 (GEF-H1), leading to Ras homolog family member A (RHOA) activation. Silencing of other claudins had no such effects, and re-expression of an siRNA-resistant CLDN-2 prevented RHOA activation, indicating specific effects of CLDN-2 on RHOA. Moreover, kidneys from CLDN-2 knockout mice had elevated levels of active RHOA. Of note, CLDN-2 silencing reduced LLC-PK1 cell proliferation and elevated expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor P27 (P27KIP1) in a GEF-H1/RHOA-dependent manner. P27KIP1 silencing abrogated the effects of CLDN-2 depletion on proliferation. CLDN-2 loss also activated myocardin-related transcription factor (MRTF), a fibrogenic RHOA effector, and elevated expression of connective tissue growth factor and smooth muscle actin. Finally, CLDN-2 down-regulation contributed to RHOA activation and smooth muscle actin expression induced by prolonged tumor necrosis factor-α treatment, because they were mitigated by re-expression of CLDN-2. Our results indicate that CLDN-2 suppresses GEF-H1/RHOA. CLDN-2 down-regulation, for example, by inflammation, can reduce proliferation and promote MRTF activation through RHOA.

Apical cytoskeletons and junctional complexes as a combined system in epithelial cell sheets.Ann. N.Y. Acad.

Biosci. 2008; 13 (18508686): 6662-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the small GTPase RHOA, a master regulator of the cytoskeleton, plays a central role in TJ remodeling (4Citi S. Guerrera D. Spadaro D. Shah J. Epithelial junctions and Rho family GTPases: the zonular signalosome.Small GTPases. 2014; 5 (25496424, 25496262, 25483304, 25483302, 25483301, 25425145): 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). RHOA cycles between inactive (GDP-bound) and active (GTP-bound) states. Its activity is tightly controlled by three classes of regulators: guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), GTPase-activating proteins, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (5Cherfils J. Zeghouf M. Regulation of small GTPases by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs.Physiol. Rev. 2013; 93 (23303910): 269-30910.1152/physrev.00003.2012Crossref PubMed Scopus (776) Google Scholar). Activation of RHOA is promoted by GEFs, which constitute a large family with >70 members. Interestingly, the state of the TJs also affects RHOA and the cytoskeleton, likely via the binding of RHOA regulators at the TJs. One such protein is the Dbl family guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF-H1 (ARHGEF2). GEF-H1 binds to the microtubules and to TJ adapter proteins, including cingulin and paracingulin, that control its activity (6Guillemot L. Paschoud S. Jond L. Foglia A. Citi S. Paracingulin regulates the activity of Rac1 and RHOA GTPases by recruiting Tiam1 and GEF-H1 to epithelial junctions.Mol. Biol.

In our previous work we showed that GEF-H1 mediated TNFα-induced RHOA activation in epithelial cells (9Kakiashvili E. Speight P. Waheed F. Seth R. Lodyga M. Tanimura S. Kohno M. Rotstein O.D.

Claudins, a family of 27 small, tetraspan membrane proteins are an integral part of the TJs and are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (10Fromm M. Piontek J. Rosenthal R. Günzel D. Krug S.M. Tight junctions of the proximal tubule and their channel proteins.Pflugers Arch. 2017; 469 (28600680): 877-88710.1007/s00424-017-2001-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). They bind their counterparts in neighboring cells in homo- and heterotypic interactions and thus seal off the paracellular space. Some claudins generate selective paracellular channels for ions and water (pore-forming claudins), and they have unique permeability properties (10Fromm M. Piontek J. Rosenthal R. Günzel D. Krug S.M. Tight junctions of the proximal tubule and their channel proteins.Pflugers Arch. 2017; 469 (28600680): 877-88710.1007/s00424-017-2001-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The differential expression profile of claudins is the basis for tissue-specific epithelial permeability. The cytoplasmic tail of claudins binds PDZ domain–containing adapter proteins (11Guillemot L. Paschoud S. Pulimeno P. Foglia A. Citi S. The cytoplasmic plaque of tight junctions: a scaffolding and signalling center.Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2008; 1778 (18339298): 601-61310.1016/j.bbamem.2007.09.032Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These adapters generate multiprotein complexes that link claudins to the junctional actomyosin ring, which contributes to dynamic TJ regulation (3Ivanov A.I. Actin motors that drive formation and disassembly of epithelial apical junctions.Front. Biosci. 2008; 13 (18508686): 6662-6681Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). TJs are also important signaling platforms, providing input for diverse functions such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation (4Citi S. Guerrera D. Spadaro D. Shah J. Epithelial junctions and Rho family GTPases: the zonular signalosome.Small GTPases. 2014; 5 (25496424, 25496262, 25483304, 25483302, 25483301, 25425145): 1-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 11Guillemot L.

Many epithelial cancers display altered claudin expression that correlates with prognosis (12Singh A.B. Uppada S.B. Dhawan P. Claudin proteins, outside-in signaling, and carcinogenesis.Pflugers Arch. 2017; 469 (27988840): 69-7510.1007/s00424-016-1919-1Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), suggesting that claudins might directly affect tumor growth and metastasis. Nevertheless, the exact mechanistic details of such noncanonical functions remain incompletely understood. Claudin-2 (CLDN-2) is a pore-forming claudin expressed in epithelial layers with high paracellular permeability such as proximal tubules and the intestine (reviewed in Ref. 10Fromm M. Piontek J. Rosenthal R. Günzel D. Krug S.M. Tight junctions of the proximal tubule and their channel proteins.Pflugers Arch. 2017; 469 (28600680): 877-88710.1007/s00424-017-2001-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). It forms dynamically gated paracellular cation channels (13Weber C.R. Liang G.H. Wang Y. Das S. Shen L. Yu A.S. Nelson D.J. Turner J.R.

The S2 segment of the proximal tubules of CLDN-2−/− mice showed significantly reduced transepithelial reabsorption of Na+, Cl−, and water. Higher energy demand of active transcellular Na+ absorption compensating for lack of CLDN-2–mediated passive paracellular transport resulted in medullary hypoxia and augmented ischemic kidney injury (22Pei L.

Thus, the transport function of CLDN-2 appears to be crucial for minimizing oxygen consumption in the kidney and thereby protecting it from injury. In cancer cell lines manipulation of CLDN-2 expression was shown to alter proliferation (23Ikari A. Watanabe R. Sato T. Taga S. Shimobaba S. Yamaguchi M. Yamazaki Y. Endo S. Matsunaga T. Sugatani J. Nuclear distribution of claudin-2 increases cell proliferation in human lung adenocarcinoma cells.Biochim. Biophys.

Papin M. Bonnans C. Darido C. Raye W.S. Garambois V. Pélegrin A. Bourgaux J.F. Pannequin J. Joubert D. Hollande F. Symplekin promotes tumorigenicity by up-regulating claudin-2 expression.Proc. Natl.

CLDN-2 overexpression in lung adenocarcinoma, colorectal, and breast cancer was associated with poor prognosis (26Paquet-Fifield S. Koh S.L. Cheng L. Beyit L.M. Shembrey C. Mølck C. Behrenbruch C.

Thus, it is conceivable that altered CLDN-2 expression plays a direct pathogenic role through effects on cancer growth and metastasis. In light of these findings, it is noteworthy that CLDN-2 expression is dynamically modulated by a variety of stimuli through several pathways (28Szaszi K. Amoozadeh Y. New insights into functions, regulation, and pathological roles of tight junctions in kidney tubular epithelium.Int. Rev. Cell Mol. Biol. 2014; 308 (24411173): 205-27110.1016/B978-0-12-800097-7.00006-3Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In intestinal cells, cytokines caused significant up-regulation of CLDN-2, likely contributing to permeability increase in inflammatory bowel disease (29Mankertz J. Schulzke J.D. Altered permeability in inflammatory bowel disease: pathophysiology and clinical implications.Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol. 2007; 23 (17545772): 379-38310.1097/MOG.0b013e32816aa392Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). TNFα-induced changes in CLDN-2 abundance were more complex in tubular cells, where an initial increase in CLDN-2 levels caused by reduced degradation was followed by a drop in mRNA and protein expression (19Amoozadeh Y. Dan Q. Xiao J. Waheed F. Szászi K. Tumor necrosis factor-α induces a biphasic change in claudin-2 expression in tubular epithelial cells: role in barrier functions.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 309 (25948735): C38-C5010.1152/ajpcell.00388.2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In cultured tubular cells, a variety of pathologically relevant chronic stimuli were shown to reduce CLDN-2 expression. These include metabolic acidosis (30Balkovetz D.F. Chumley P. Amlal H. Downregulation of claudin-2 expression in renal epithelial cells by metabolic acidosis.Am. J. Physiol.

Remodeling of the tight junction during recovery from exposure to hydrogen peroxide in kidney epithelial cells.Free Radic. Biol.

Because CLDN-2 affects proliferation, it is conceivable that its loss may modify recovery from kidney injury. Nevertheless, the consequences of altered tubular CLDN-2 expression beyond transport remain largely undefined. Considering these gaps in our knowledge, the overall objective of this study was to explore how CLDN-2 expression is affected by kidney injury and to obtain mechanistic insights into downstream consequences of altered tubular CLDN-2 expression. Because TJs can affect RHOA signaling, we explored the effects of CLDN-2 on RHOA. Our data demonstrate that CLDN-2 is a negative regulator of RHOA signaling. Loss of CLDN-2 causes RHOA-dependent decrease in proliferation and promotes fibrogenic epithelial reprogramming. These findings highlight the potential functional significance of cytokine-induced CLDN-2 changes beyond effects on permeability. We have previously shown that in cultured tubular cells TNFα altered expression of the channel forming TJ protein CLDN-2 in a biphasic manner, with an initial increase followed by a drop (19Amoozadeh Y. Dan Q. Xiao J. Waheed F. Szászi K. Tumor necrosis factor-α induces a biphasic change in claudin-2 expression in tubular epithelial cells: role in barrier functions.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 309 (25948735): C38-C5010.1152/ajpcell.00388.2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, the effects of kidney injury and inflammation on CLDN-2 expression in vivo remained unknown. Therefore, we used unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) in mice, as in our earlier studies (34Rozycki M. Bialik J.F. Speight P. Dan Q. Knudsen T.E. Szeto S.G. Yuen D.A. Szászi K. Pedersen S.F. Kapus A. Myocardin-related transcription factor regulates Nox4 protein expression: linking cytoskeletal organization to redox state.J. Biol.

Rep. 2019; 9 (30867502): 432310.1038/s41598-019-40764-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), to evaluate changes in CLDN-2 abundance. UUO is an obstructive nephropathy model, in which the primary trigger for injury is epithelial mechanical stretch caused by elevated intratubular pressure after ureteral ligation (36Klahr S. Morrissey J. Obstructive nephropathy and renal fibrosis.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283 (12372761): F861-F87510.1152/ajprenal.00362.2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). Injury causes tubulointerstitial inflammation characterized by the presence of a large array of cytokines. Significant tubulointerstitial fibrosis develops by day 7 (36Klahr S. Morrissey J. Obstructive nephropathy and renal fibrosis.Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 2002; 283 (12372761): F861-F87510.1152/ajprenal.00362.2001Crossref PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1(A, see right panel for quantitation, and B), UUO caused a time-dependent change in the abundance of CLDN-2 protein and mRNA, normalized to tubulin (protein) or GAPDH (mRNA). Initially, CLDN-2 protein and mRNA levels significantly increased (day 3). This was followed by a large drop in CLDN-2 protein by day 7, when fibrosis developed. Interestingly, although the protein dropped significantly below the basal level at day 7, mRNA expression was reduced compared with day 3 but remained around the baseline (sham) level. This suggests that the observed decrease in CLDN-2 protein was likely due to augmented degradation. In contrast to CLDN-2, the mRNA of claudin-1 and 7 showed a substantial and significant increase in UUO at 7 days (Fig. 1C). UUO causes tubular injury, and therefore we wished to exclude the possibility that loss of tubular cells accounts for reduced CLDN-2 levels. Although the lack of change in CLDN-2 mRNA suggests that at this time point proximal tubular cells are viable, to further substantiate this conclusion, we measured mRNA levels of the sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2), that is expressed exclusively in the proximal tubules. We found no difference in SGLT-2 mRNA expression in sham and UUO at any time point (Fig. 1D). Finally, we used laser capture microdissection (LCM) as earlier (34Rozycki M. Bialik J.F. Speight P. Dan Q. Knudsen T.E. Szeto S.G. Yuen D.A. Szászi K. Pedersen S.F. Kapus A. Myocardin-related transcription factor regulates Nox4 protein expression: linking cytoskeletal organization to redox state.J.

LCM allows the isolation of the tubular compartment, and thus the quantification of mRNA is not confounded by a change in other cell types, e.g. by influx of immune cells. As shown in Fig. 1E, UUO did not change expression of Na+/Cl− co-transporter (NCC), basic amino acid transporter 1 (BAT1), or Tamms–Horsfall protein, markers of various tubular segments. Taken together, CLDN-2 protein changes are specific, and the late reduction is unlikely to be due to a mass loss of proximal tubule cells. Cytokines play a crucial role in the development of fibrosis, and prolonged exposure to TNFα reduced CLDN-2 expression in tubular cells (19Amoozadeh Y. Dan Q. Xiao J. Waheed F. Szászi K. Tumor necrosis factor-α induces a biphasic change in claudin-2 expression in tubular epithelial cells: role in barrier functions.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 309 (25948735): C38-C5010.1152/ajpcell.00388.2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Therefore, we next tested the effects of other relevant cytokines that are increased in UUO. We exposed LLC-PK1 tubular cells to IL1β and found that short-term (3 h) stimulation caused an increase in CLDN-2 expression but had no effect on Cldn-1 or 7 (Fig. 1F). In contrast, in cells exposed to IL1β for 24 h, abundance of CLDN-2 but not the other claudins showed a significant drop. Moreover, this effect was accompanied by a significant drop in CLDN-2 mRNA, suggesting a reduction in synthesis (Fig. 1G). This time-dependent biphasic effect is similar to the effects of TNFα we reported earlier (19Amoozadeh Y. Dan Q. Xiao J. Waheed F. Szászi K. Tumor necrosis factor-α induces a biphasic change in claudin-2 expression in tubular epithelial cells: role in barrier functions.Am. J. Physiol. Cell Physiol. 2015; 309 (25948735): C38-C5010.1152/ajpcell.00388.2014Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Next, we assessed the effect of TGFβ1, the main pro-fibrotic cytokine on claudin expression. As shown on Fig. 1H, none of the claudins were affected by short-term TGFβ1 treatment. In contrast, long-term TGFβ1 treatment significantly reduced both CLDN-2 protein and mRNA expression (Fig. 1, H and I), similarly to IL1β. Interestingly, long-term TGFβ1 treatment significantly elevated Cldn-1 and -7 protein expression (Fig. 1H). This was likely due to increased synthesis, because mRNA of these claudins also showed an increase, although the combined effect at this time point did not reach statistical significance for Cldn-1 (Fig. 1I). Taken together, these data suggest that inflammatory/fibrogenic cytokines affect expression of various claudins during kidney injury and inflammation. Specifically, CLDN-2 expression changes in a time-dependent manner, and CLDN-2 levels drop in conjunction with the development of renal fibrosis. We next aimed at establishing the consequences of CLDN-2 loss. To this end, we silenced CLDN-2 in LLC-PK1 cells using two different siRNAs, both of which caused >80% reduction in CLDN"

In this study, using membrane yeast two-hybrid and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays, we probed recombint flax transferase enzymes, previously shown to contribute to PUFA enrichment of TAG, for physical interactions with each other under in vivo conditions. We found that diacylglycerol acyltransferases, which catalyze the fil reaction in acyl-CoA–dependent TAG biosynthesis, interact with the acyl-editing enzymes phosphatidylcholine: diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase, and lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase. Physical interactions among the acyl-editing enzymes were also identified.

https://openalex.org/W2971793097,"Metabolic syndrome has become a global health challenge and was recently reported to be positively correlated with increased sucrose consumption. Mechanistic analyses of excess sucrose-induced progression of metabolic syndrome have been focused mainly on abnormal hepatic lipogenesis, and the exact contribution of excess sucrose to metabolic disorders remains controversial. Considering that carbohydrate and lipid metabolisms exhibit clear circadian rhythms, here we investigated the possible contribution of diurnal oscillations to responses of hepatic lipid metabolism to excess sucrose. We found that excess sucrose dose-dependently promotes fatty liver and hyperlipidemia in in rats fed a high-sucrose diet (HSD). We observed that excess sucrose enhances the oscillation amplitudes of the expression of clock genes along with the levels of hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism-related mRNAs that increase lipogenesis. We did not observe similar changes in the levels of the transcription factors regulating the expression of these genes. This suggested that the excess sucrose-induced, circadian rhythm–dependent amplification of lipogenesis is post-transcriptionally regulated via the stability of metabolic gene transcripts. Of note, our findings also provide evidence that fructose causes some of the HSD-induced, circadian rhythm–dependent alterations in lipogenic gene expression. Our discovery of HSD-induced circadian rhythm–dependent alterations in lipogenesis at the post-transcriptional level may inform future studies investigating the complex relationships among sucrose uptake, circadian rhythm, and metabolic enzyme expression.

Our findings could contribute to the design of chrono-nutritional interventions to prevent or manage the development of fatty liver and hyperlipidemia in sucrose-induced metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome has become a global health problem, representing an increased risk for developing type-2 diabetes mellitus or cardiovascular diseases (1Huang P.L.

Lifestyle changes, such as a lack of exercise, excess energy consumption from processed foods, and increased stress, promote metabolic syndrome prevalence (1Huang P.L.

Intervention on diets, especially a high-fat diet, has been focused on controlling metabolic syndrome development, whereas the threat of added sugars to public health has also been recognized (3Lustig R.H.

Distinct from a high-fat diet accelerating metabolic diseases via obesity, excess sucrose contributes to noncommunicable diseases independently of excess energy intake (4Roncal-Jimenez C.A.

Fructose has been considered to provide a rapid substrate flux for lipogenesis, partially due to its being less controlled by rate-limiting enzymes than glucose (6Tappy L. Lê K.A. Tran C. Paquot N. Fructose and metabolic diseases: new findings, new questions.Nutrition. 2010; 26 (20471804): 1044-104910.1016/j.nut.2010.02.014Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 8Sun S.Z. Empie M.W.

Recent biochemistry textbooks also state that the rapid substrate influx from fructose into the lipogenesis pathway is the main reason for fatty liver induced by excess fructose (10Berg J.M. Tymoczko J.L. Gatto Jr., G.J. Stryer L. Biochemistry.8th Ed. W. H. Freeman, New York2015: 232-234Google Scholar, 11Rodwell V.W. Bender D. Botham K.M. Kennelly P.J. Weil P.A. Harpers Illustrated Biochemistry 30th Edition. McGraw-Hill, New York2015: 465-466Google Scholar). It does not appear that the rapid substrate influx can explain accumulation of lipids in blood and liver. Despite accumulating evidence implicating sucrose in metabolic syndrome-associated symptoms (3Lustig R.H. Schmidt L.A. Brindis C.D.

Moreover, on the molecular level, several animal studies generated conflicting results with regard to whether the expression of sucrose- or fructose-induced enzymes involved in lipogenesis increased or was unaffected (12Zakim D. Pardini R.S. Herman R.H. Sauberlich H.E. Mechanism for the differential effects of high carbohydrate diets on lipogenesis in rat liver.Biochim. Biophys.

Circadian rhythms can play important roles in metabolism homeostasis in mammals (16Bass J. Circadian topology of metabolism.Nature. 2012; 491 (23151577): 348-35610.1038/nature11704Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). In contrast to the suprachiasmatic nucleus located in the hypothalamus that mainly receives the regulation by light signals, cell-autonomous circadian oscillations in peripheral tissues (including the liver, adipose tissue, and gastrointestinal tract) are sensitive to feeding and diet (17Asher G. Sassone-Corsi P. Time for food: the intimate interplay between nutrition, metabolism, and the circadian clock.Cell. 2015; 161 (25815987): 84-9210.1016/j.cell.2015.03.015Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). For instance, feeding-regulated insulin can function as a synchronizer for the liver clock (18Yamajuku D. Inagaki T. Haruma T. Okubo S. Kataoka Y. Kobayashi S. Ikegami K. Laurent T. Kojima T. Noutomi K. Hashimoto S. Oda H. Real-time monitoring in three-dimensional hepatocytes reveals that insulin acts as a synchronizer for liver clock.Sci. Rep. 2012; 2 (22666542): 43910.1038/srep00439Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Numerous metabolites and gene expression oscillations can increase energy efficiency and prevent futile cycles (19Panda S. Circadian physiology of metabolism.Science. 2016; 354 (27885007): 1008-101510.1126/science.aah4967Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). Previously, we reported that an effective intervention strategy, time-restricted feeding, can alleviate metabolic disorders induced by excess sucrose (20Sun S. Hanzawa F. Umeki M. Ikeda S. Mochizuki S. Oda H. Time-restricted feeding suppresses excess sucrose-induced plasma and liver lipid accumulation in rats.PLoS One. 2018; 13 (30110343): e020126110.1371/journal.pone.0201261Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although several questions remain regarding this feeding regimen (19Panda S.

These findings suggest the possibility of circadian rhythm–dependent metabolic responses to various diets, and to investigate the responses of lipid metabolism to a high-sucrose diet (HSD), 3The abbreviations used are: HSDhigh-sucrose dietCDcontrol starch dietANOVAanalysis of varianceHGDhigh-glucose dietHFGDhigh-fructose and -glucose dietHFDhigh-fructose dietPPPpentose phosphate pathwayCGDcontrol glucose dietOPLS-DAorthogonal partial least-squares discriminant analysisNAFLDnonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseFFAfree fatty acidUTRuntranslated regionH&Ehematoxylin and eosin. we studied rhythmic changes in the expression patterns of clock genes and lipogenic genes.

To confirm the pathogenetic effects of excess sucrose, rats were fed with diets containing either starch (control starch diet (CD)) or sucrose (HSD) as a sole carbohydrate source, for 4 weeks. In agreement with our previous study (20Sun S. Hanzawa F. Umeki M. Ikeda S. Mochizuki S. Oda H. Time-restricted feeding suppresses excess sucrose-induced plasma and liver lipid accumulation in rats.PLoS One. 2018; 13 (30110343): e020126110.1371/journal.pone.0201261Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), rats showed no significant differences in body weight gain (Fig. 1a) or food intake (Fig. 1b). Fasting plasma triglyceride and cholesterol concentrations significantly increased in HSD rats (Fig. 1, c and d). The results of two-way repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed different variation patterns over days on these two different diets, which showed a more robust elevation according to the days on diets in HSD group. This result showed that the HSD induced hyperlipidemia in rats. Liver weights also significantly increased in HSD rats, with obvious hepatic lipid accumulation (Fig. 1, e–g). Hepatic lipid-fraction analysis showed that the triglyceride level was most strongly induced by HSD and that cholesterol and phospholipids were also robustly induced (Fig. 1f). Analysis of liver histology revealed that hepatic macrovesicular steatosis occurred in rats fed an HSD (Fig. 1g). Substantial formation of lipid droplets were observed in periportal regions, which was consistent with sucrose-induced periportal steatosis found previously with metabolic zonation of the liver (24Hijmans B.S. Grefhorst A. Oosterveer M.H. Groen A.K. Zonation of glucose and fatty acid metabolism in the liver: mechanism and metabolic consequences.Biochimie. 2014; 96 (23792151): 121-12910.1016/j.biochi.2013.06.007Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Nonfasting serum triglyceride levels on the final experimental day displayed diurnal rhythmic variations (JTK_CYLCE analysis: CD, p = 0.0034; HSD, p = 0.0014), with ∼1.5-fold increased amplitude in HSD rats (Fig. 1h and Table S2). Cholesterol levels were not rhythmic during the day (p = 1) but were induced by the HSD (Fig. 1i and Table S2). To determine whether the induction of lipid accumulation by the HSD correlated with dose of sucrose, rats were fed diets containing different ratios of starch and sucrose as carbohydrate sources (described under “Experimental procedures”). Although the sucrose doses in the diets did not influence body weight gain (Fig. 1j) or food intake (Fig. 1k) in rats during the 4-week experiment, liver weights increased linearly with greater sucrose doses. And a significant difference from the CD group appeared at a dose of 43.5 g sucrose per 100 g of diet (Fig. 1l). Hepatic total lipids and triglycerides were also significantly increased at a dose of 43.5 g of sucrose/100 g of diet (Fig. 1, m and n), whereas a significant difference in serum triglyceride levels was found at a higher dose of 65.3 g of sucrose/100 g of diet (Fig. 1o). Despite these significant differences, approximately linear corrections between sucrose doses and lipid accumulation in the liver and blood were observed. Considering that the monosaccharide fructose has been speculated to be responsible for most excess sucrose-related complications (25Havel P.J. Dietary fructose: implications for dysregulation of energy homeostasis and lipid/carbohydrate metabolism.Nutr. Rev. 2005; 63 (15971409): 133-15710.1111/j.1753-4887.2005.tb00132.xCrossref PubMed Google Scholar), we investigated the role of fructose in HSD-induced fatty liver and hyperlipidemia. Rats were fed a CD, high-glucose diet (HGD), HSD, high-fructose and -glucose diet (HFGD; 1:1 ratio by weight), or high-fructose diet (HFD) ad libitum for 4 weeks. The liver weights increased significantly in the HSD, HFGD, and HFD groups when compared with the CD group, but not in the HGD group (Fig. 2a). Similar variations were found in hepatic lipids, including total lipids, triglycerides, and cholesterol (Fig. 2, b–d). These changes clearly occurred in a fructose-dependent manner. Although fructose dose dependence was not observed (as 2-fold more fructose was present in the HFD than in HSD and HFGD), the liver weights and hepatic lipids did not double. Serum triglycerides and cholesterol were also increased by diets containing fructose (HSD, HFGD, and HFD), and triglycerides, but not cholesterol, showed larger increases at Zeitgeber time 2 (ZT2; ZT0 is defined as the point when the lights were turned on), which was similar to the results shown in Fig. 1, h and i (Fig. 2, e and f). To investigate how excess sucrose affects lipid metabolism by influencing the circadian system, we analyzed oscillations in the expression levels of genes that play important roles in regulating metabolism, including clock genes, transcription factor genes, lipid– and carbohydrate metabolism–related genes, and amino acid metabolism–related genes. All rhythmic analysis results pertaining to rhythmic assessment (p values), phases, and amplitudes are shown in Table S2. Cell-autonomous circadian oscillations consist of molecular transcription feedback loops that further mediate circadian rhythm-controlled gene expression (16Bass J. Circadian topology of metabolism.Nature. 2012; 491 (23151577): 348-35610.1038/nature11704Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). BMAL1 (also known as ARNTL1; aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like 1) and CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) proteins form heterodimers that function as core activators in the circadian transcription feedback loop (16Bass J. Circadian topology of metabolism.Nature. 2012; 491 (23151577): 348-35610.1038/nature11704Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The mRNA levels of BMAL1 and CLOCK showed clear diurnal oscillations with slightly shifted phases (2 h) induced by the HSD, although the amplitudes did not change (0.5 < -fold change < 1.5) between groups (Fig. 3 (a and b) and Table S2) (20Sun S. Hanzawa F. Umeki M. Ikeda S. Mochizuki S. Oda H.

The HSD did not affect the mRNA expression levels of several other rhythmically expressed genes, including RORα (retinoic acid–related orphan receptor α), DBP (D site of albumin promoter-binding protein), HLF (hepatic leukemia factor), DECs (deleted in esophageal cancer 1 and 2), TEF (thyrotroph embryonic factor), and E4BP4 (also known as NFIL3; nuclear factor, interleukin 3–regulated), whose products all play important roles in regulating carbohydrate and lipid metabolism homeostasis (26Bass J.

There are important transcription factors controlling the expression of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism–related genes downstream of the core clock transcriptional feedback loop, such as SREBP1 (sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1) and ChREBP (carbohydrate-responsive element–binding protein).

Although core clock genes and transcription factors were not significantly changed by the HSD, the enzymes that directly participate in lipid metabolism showed different rhythmic expression patterns between the CD and HSD groups. ACLY (ATP citrate lyase), ACACA (acetyl-CoA carboxylase α), and FASN (fatty acid synthase) contribute to de novo lipogenesis from citrate, and the amplitudes of their mRNA oscillations all increased by approximately twice (amplitude -fold change: 2.04, 1.81, and 1.99, respectively), with slightly shifted phases (2 h), in rats fed an HSD (Fig. 4 (a–c) and Table S2). Fatty acid elongase ELOVL6 (elongation of very long chain fatty acids protein 6) and desaturase FADS1 (fatty acid desaturase 1), FADS2, and SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1) also showed larger mRNA expression amplitudes (-fold change: 4.44, 2.12, 1.71, and 2.19, respectively) in rats of the HSD group (Fig. 4 (d–g) and Table S2). In contrast, MTTP (microsomal triglyceride transfer protein), which plays a central role in the assembly of lipoproteins, such as very low-density lipoprotein, was not rhythmically expressed in the CD group (p > 0.05). However, the HSD induced de novo diurnal oscillations in its mRNA levels (Fig. 4h and Table S2). Lipogenesis requires NADPH as an energy source. The major source of NADPH in animal cells is the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), and we found that expression of G6PD (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase), which encodes the rate-limiting enzyme mediating the reaction step of NADPH production in the PPP (31Tian W.N. Braunstein L.D. Pang J. Stuhlmeier K.M. Xi Q.C. Tian X. Stanton R.C. Importance of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity for cell growth.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273 (9553122): 10609-1061710.1074/jbc.273.17.10609Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar), showed a slightly shifted phase (2 h) and a largely increased amplitude (-fold change: 2.84) (Fig. 4i and Table S2). These variations were similar to those found in the enzymes that catalyze fatty acid synthesis, including ACLY, ACACA, and FASN. Another reaction step producing NADPH in the PPP is regulated by PGD (phosphogluconate dehydrogenase), which showed little difference in mRNA levels between two groups (Fig. S2a and Table S2). A third source of NADPH production mediated by the NADP+-dependent ME (malic enzyme) also displayed mRNA levels with an ∼4-fold increased amplitude of mRNA levels in the HSD group (Fig. 4j and Table S2). Finally, we also studied whether HSD affected fatty acid oxidation. CPT1A (carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A) is the essential enzyme of the long-chain fatty acid shuttle system that helps long-chain fatty acids enter the mitochondria to become oxidized. Our results showed similar mRNA oscillation patterns between the CD and HSD groups (Fig. 4k and Table S2). However, the expression of ACOX1 (acyl-CoA oxidase 1), whose gene product catalyzes the first step of peroxisomal very long-chain fatty acid oxidation, was induced de novo rhythmicity by the HSD (Fig. 4l and Table S2). Overall, the results described above indicated that the HSD induced circadian rhythm–dependent mRNA expression changes in lipid metabolism–related genes, including shifted phases, increased amplitudes, or de novo rhythmic oscillations; these changed patterns could mostly be attributable to increases in the light phase, rather than the dark phase. These circadian rhythm–dependent changes could have contributed to the large increase in lipogenesis found in rats fed an HSD, leading to the promotion of fatty liver and hyperlipidemia. Because de novo lipogenesis was induced to display circadian rhythm–dependent amplifications by the HSD, we further investigated carbohydrate catabolism, which supplies substrates for lipogenesis. The enzyme in the catabolic pathway important for both fructose and glucose catabolism, PKLR (pyruvate kinase, liver, and red blood cell type), showed rhythmic expression in the HSD group, but not in the CD group, and an obvious increase in mRNA amplitude (Fig. 5a and Table S2). Rate-limiting enzymes of the glycolysis pathway, such as GCK (glucokinase) and PFKL (phosphofructokinase, liver type), showed oscillatory mRNA levels, but the oscillations were not largely changed by the HSD (Fig. 5 (b and c) and Table S2). However, an enzyme that regulates fructolysis, KHK (ketohexokinase), showed similar variations in rats fed an HSD, displaying de novo rhythmic expression and approximately a 5-fold increase in the mRNA amplitude (Fig. 5d and Table S2). ALOB (aldolase B) also showed an increased mRNA amplitude and a 4-h delayed phase in the HSD group, whereas TPI (triosephosphate isomerase) expression did not change between the groups (Fig. 5 (e and f) and Table S2). In contrast, the HSD barely affected the mRNA expression levels of genes whose products mediate gluconeogenesis, such as PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate kinase), FBP1 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase), and G6PC (glucose-6-phosphatase, catalytic subunit) (Fig. 5 (g–i) and Table S2). Amino acid and ammonia metabolism-related genes, such as GOT1 (aspartate aminotransferase), GPT1 (also known as ALAT, alanine"

Numerous pathways underlying the onset of these diseases have been identified in rodents using a social defeat stress protocol, whereby socially defeated individuals exhibit depression- and/or anxiety-like phenotypes that typically manifest as social avoidance behavior. However, most studies in this field have been conducted using young adult mice; therefore, information about social defeat stress-related behavioral phenotypes in older mice is limited. In this study, we exposed groups of young adult (8-16 weeks old) and aged (24 months old) C57BL/6J mice to mild social defeat stress by challenging them with aggressive CD1 mice while restricting the intensity of aggression to protect the animals from severe injuries. We then identified stress-induced behavioral changes and compared their expression between the age groups and with a non-defeated (non-stressed) control group. We found that the stressed mice in both age groups exhibited similar reduced social interactions that were indicative of increased social avoidance behavior. Moreover, unlike the young stressed and control groups, only the aged stressed group showed a reduced preference for sucrose, which was correlated with social avoidance behavior. Also, the aged stressed mice exhibited an attenuated defeat-induced increase in water intake. These findings reveal that aging alters behavioral phenotypes after social defeat and that the hedonic behavior of aged mice is more vulnerable to social defeat compared with younger mice."
https://openalex.org/W2972057736,"In the United States, breast cancer is one of the most common and the second leading cause of cancer-related death in women. Treatment modalities for mammary tumor are surgical removal of the tumor tissue followed by either chemotherapy or radiotherapy or both. Radiation therapy is a whole body irradiation regimen that suppresses the immune system leaving hosts susceptible to infection or secondary tumors. Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) in that regard is more selective, the cells that are mostly affected are those that are loaded with 109 or more 10B atoms. Previously, we have described that liposomal encapsulation of boron-rich compounds such as TAC and MAC deliver a high payload to the tumor tissue when injected intravenously. Here we report that liposome-mediated boron delivery to the tumor is inversely proportional to the size of the murine mammary (EMT-6) tumors. The plausible reason for the inverse ratio of boron and EMT-6 tumor size is the necrosis in these tumors, which is more prominent in the large tumors. The large tumors also have receding blood vessels contributing further to poor boron delivery to these tumors. We next report that the presence of boron in blood is essential for the effects of BNCT on EMT-6 tumor inhibition as direct injection of boron-rich liposomes did not provide any added advantage in inhibition of EMT-6 tumor in BALB/c mice following irradiation despite having a significantly higher amount of boron in the tumor tissue. BNCT reaction in PBMCs resulted in the modification of these cells to anti-tumor phenotype. In this study, we report the immunomodulatory effects of BNCT when boron-rich compounds are delivered systemically."

However, to understand recruitment success, seed dispersal and survival in habitats of different complexity remains to be quantified. We tested the single and synergistic effects of three commonly distributed ecosystem engineers-eelgrass (Zostera marina), oysters (Magellana gigas) and blue mussels (Mytilus edulis)-on trapping of Z. marina seeds in a hydraulic flume under currents. Our results suggest that seed retention increases with habitat complexity and further reveal insights into the underlying mechanisms. In eelgrass canopy, trapping occurred mostly through direct blocking of a seed's pathway, while trapping in bivalve patches was mainly related to altered hydrodynamics in the lee side, i.e. behind each specimen. With increasing flow velocity (24-30 cm s-1 in eelgrass canopy, 18-30 cm s-1 in bivalve patches), modifications of the sediment surface through increased turbulence and erosive processes became more important and resulted in high seed trapping rates. Furthermore, we show that while monospecific patches of seagrass and bivalves had different trapping optima depending on flow velocities, intermixing resulted in consistently high trapping rates throughout the investigated hydrodynamic gradient. Our results highlight the importance of positive interactions among ecosystem engineers for seed retention and patch emergence in eelgrass."

In this study, we used molecular screening of viral capsid protein 2 (VP2) from 2015 to 2017, to assess the prevalence of CPPV-1 infection in 9 live-trapped (LT) and 17 vehicle collision (VC)-affected free-living leopard cats (Prionailurus bengalensis chinensis). In addition, we conducted the phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the possible transmission of CPPV-1 between domestic carnivores and leopard cats. We identified the circulation of feline parvovirus and variants of canine parvovirus (CPV), including CPV-2a, CPV-2b, and CPV-2c, in the free-living leopard cat population. The partial sequences of different variants of VP2 obtained from the leopard cats were identical with those obtained from the domestic dogs and cats in Taiwan. Our result suggested that CPPV-1 was currently transmitted between domestic carnivores and leopard cats in Taiwan. A plan of conservation measures based on vaccination program for domestic carnivores, strict controls on populations of free-living dogs and cats and limiting road development only to low-risk areas for leopard cats should be encouraged."
https://openalex.org/W2972285637,"The biological significance of regional cladoceran morphotypes in the montane regions of the central Palearctic remains poorly understood. In the Holarctic Daphnia longispina complex (Cladocera: Daphniidae), several variants, lineages and species have been proposed as endemic for Southern Siberia. Daphnia turbinata Sars, for example, named after its unusual head shape, is known only from Southern Siberia. Here we sequence DNA of Daphnia from three mitochondrial genes (12S rRNA, 16S rRNA, and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2, ND2) from 57 localities in Russia and Mongolia (the majority being from Southern Siberia) and place them in evolutionary context with existing data. Our aim was to examine regional endemism of the Daphnia longispina complex in Southern Siberian; to improve the phylogenetic understanding with improved taxonomic and regional sampling, and to better understand the influence of Pleistocene glaciation on the biogeography of these lineages. At least three lineages showed genetic evidence for endemism in Southern Siberia. There was strong support for D. turbinata as a sister lineage to to D. longispina/D. dentifera. Another endemic, Siberian D. cf. longispina, is a sister group to the longispina group in general. Within D. longispina s. str. there was an endemic Siberian clade with a western range boundary near the Yenisei River Basin. Gene flow estimates among populations (based on FST values) were very low for clades of D. longispina on a regional (the original 12S dataset), and on a pan-Eurasian (the extended 12S dataset) scale. Negative values of Fu's FS and Tajima's D tests prevailed for the species examined with significant values found for two D. longispina clades, D. dentifera, D. galeata and D. cristata. Our results support the notion that Southern Siberia is an important biogeographic region for cladocerans as it contained unexpected diversity of endemics (such as D. turbinata, D. cf. longispina and lineages of D. umbra and D. longsipina s.str.) and from being the geographic meeting place of expanding postglacial lineages from eastern and western refugia."
https://openalex.org/W2971506850,"Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Their highly invasive character and the heterogeneity of active oncogenic pathways within single tumors complicate the development of curative therapies and cause poor patient prognosis. Glioma cells express the intermediate filament protein glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the level of its alternative splice variant GFAP-δ, relative to its canonical splice variant GFAP-α, is higher in grade IV compared with lower-grade and lower malignant glioma. In this study we show that a high GFAP-δ/α ratio induces the expression of the dual-specificity phosphatase 4 (DUSP4) in focal adhesions. By focusing on pathways up- and downstream of DUSP4 that are involved in the cell-extracellular matrix interaction, we show that a high GFAP-δ/α ratio equips glioma cells to better invade the brain. This study supports the hypothesis that glioma cells with a high GFAP-δ/α ratio are highly invasive and more malignant cells, thus making GFAP alternative splicing a potential therapeutic target.-Van Bodegraven, E.

This study aimed to obtain reliable data on the current state of the kelch13 molecular marker for artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum in Cameroon. DNA was extracted from the dried blood spots collected from epidemiologically distinct endemic areas in the Center, Littoral and North regions of Cameroon. Nested PCR products from the Kelch13-propeller gene were sequenced and analyzed on an ABI 3730XL automatic sequencer. Of 219 dried blood spots, 175 were sequenced successfully. We identified six K13 mutations in 2.9% (5/175) of samples, including 2 non-synonymous, the V589I allele had been reported in Africa already and one new allele E612K had not been reported yet. These two non-synonymous mutations were uniquely found in parasites from the Littoral region. One sample showed two synonymous mutations within the kelch13 gene. We also observed two infected samples with mixed K13 mutant and K13 wild-type infection. Taken together, our data suggested the circulation of the non-synonymous K13 mutations in Cameroon. Albeit no mutations known to be associated with parasite clearance delays in the study population, there is need for continuous surveillance for earlier detection of resistance as long as ACTs are used and scaled up in the community."
https://openalex.org/W2972297857,"Unlearned tendencies to approach animate creatures are of great adaptive value, especially for nidifugous social birds that need to react to the presence of potential social companions shortly after hatching. Domestic chicks’ preferences for taxidermized hens provided the first evidence of social predispositions. However, the nature of the stimuli eliciting this predisposition is not completely understood. Here we explore the unlearned preferences of visually naïve domestic chicks for taxidermized animals. Visually naive chicks were tested for their approach preferences between a target stimulus (an intact stuffed animal whose head region was clearly visible) and a control stimulus. After confirming the predisposition for the intact stuffed fowl hen (Exp. 1), we found an analogous preference for a taxidermized, young domestic chick over a severely scrambled version of the same stimulus, whose body structure was completely disrupted, extending to same-age individuals the results that had been obtained with taxidermized hens (Exp. 2). We also directly tested preferences for specimens whose head region is visible compared to ones whose head region was occluded. To clarify whether chicks are sensitive to species-specific information, we employed specimens of female mallard ducks and of a mammalian predator, the polecat. Chicks showed a preference for the duck stimulus whose wings have been covered over a similar stimulus whose head region has been covered, providing direct evidence that the visibility of the head region of taxidermized models drive chicks’ behaviour in this test, and that the attraction for the head region indeed extends to females of other bird species (Exp. 3). However, no similar preference was obtained with the polecat stimuli (Exp. 4). We thus confirmed the presence of unlearned visual preferences for the head region in newly-hatched chicks, though other factors can limit the species-generality of the phenomenon."
https://openalex.org/W2971363771,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) initiates a complex pathophysiological cascade leading to epithelial cell death. Recent studies identify autophagy, a key intracellular process that degrades cytoplasmic constituents, as protective against AKI. We have previously reported that the protein thrombospondin-1 and its receptor CD47 are induced in AKI; however, the mechanism underlying their regulation of injury is unknown. Here, we investigated whether CD47 signaling affects autophagy to regulate AKI. Wild-type (WT) and CD47-/- mice were challenged with renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. All animals underwent analysis of renal function and biomolecular phenotyping. CD47-/- mice were resistant to AKI, with decreased serum creatinine and ameliorated histologic changes compared with WT animals. These mice also displayed increased abundance of key autophagy genes, including autophagy-related gene (Atg)5, Atg7, beclin-1, and microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3 (LC3) at baseline and post-AKI, which were significantly reduced in WT mice. Changes in protein expression correlated with increased autophagosome and autolysosome formation in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs). In mouse kidney transplantation, treatment with a CD47-blocking antibody that improved function was associated with increased autophagy compared with control mice. Primary isolated RTECs from CD47-/- mice demonstrated increased basal expression of several autophagy components that was preserved under hypoxic stress. These data suggest that activated CD47 promotes AKI through inhibition of autophagy and point to CD47 as a target to preserve renal function following injury.-El-Rashid, M., Ghimire, K., Sanganeria, B., Lu, B., Rogers, N. M. CD47 limits autophagy to promote acute kidney injury."
https://openalex.org/W2971439438,"Human ether-à-go-go-related gene (Kv11.1, or hERG) is a potassium channel that conducts the delayed rectifier potassium current (IKr) during the repolarization phase of cardiac action potentials. hERG channels have a larger pore than other K+channels and can trap many unintended drugs, often resulting in acquired LQTS (aLQTS). R-roscovitine is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that induces apoptosis in colorectal, breast, prostate, multiple myeloma, other cancer cell lines, and tumor xenografts, in micromolar concentrations. It is well tolerated in phase II clinical trials. R-roscovitine inhibits open hERG channels but does not become trapped in the pore. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type (WT) or hERG pore mutant channels (T623A, S624A, Y652A, F656A) demonstrated that compared to WT hERG, T623A, Y652A, and F656A inhibition by 200 μM R-roscovitine was ~ 48%, 29%, and 73% weaker, respectively. In contrast, S624A hERG was inhibited more potently than WT hERG, with a ~ 34% stronger inhibition. These findings were further supported by the IC50 values, which were increased for T623A, Y652A and F656A (by ~5.5, 2.75, and 42 fold respectively) and reduced 1.3 fold for the S624A mutant. Our data suggest that while T623, Y652, and F656 are critical for R-roscovitine-mediated inhibition, S624 may not be. Docking studies further support our findings. Thus, R-roscovitine’s relatively unique features, coupled with its tolerance in clinical trials, could guide future drug screens."
https://openalex.org/W2972295294,"Intercellular communication between lymphocytes plays a fundamental role in numerous immune responses. Previously, we demonstrated that hyperhomocysteinemia (HHcy) induced T cell intracellular glycolytic-lipogenic reprogramming and IFN-γ secretion via pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2) to accelerate atherosclerosis. Usually, B cells partially obtain help from T cells in antibody responses. However, whether PKM2 activation in T cells regulates B cell antibody production is unknown. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are important cellular communication vehicles. Here, we found that PKM2 activator TEPP46-stimulated T-cell-derived EVs promoted B-cell IgG secretion. Conversely, EVs secreted from PKM2-null T cells were internalized into B cells and markedly inhibited B-cell mitochondrial programming, activation, and IgG production. Mechanistically, lipidomics analyses showed that increased ceramides in PKM2-activated T-cell EVs were mainly responsible for enhanced B cell IgG secretion induced by these EVs. Finally, quantum dots (QDs) were packaged with PKM2-null T cell EVs and anti-CD19 antibody to exert B-cell targeting and inhibit IgG production, eventually ameliorating HHcy-accelerated atherosclerosis in vivo. Thus, PKM2-mediated EV ceramides in T cells may be an important cargo for T-cell-regulated B cell IgG production, and QD-CD19-PKM2-null T cell EVs hold high potential to treat B cell overactivation-related diseases.-Yang, J., Dang, G., Lü, S., Liu, H., Ma, X., Han, L., Deng, J., Miao, Y., Li, X., Shao, F., Jiang, C., Xu, Q., Wang, X., Feng, J.

https://openalex.org/W2972232537,"During the mating season, Iberian red deer males (Cervus elaphus hispanicus) present a large visible dark ventral area in their abdomen. This characteristic dark-haired area is formed by the impregnation of the hair with sprayed urine and gland secretions and contains volatile compounds that can be used in intraspecific communication. Here, we used gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to describe the lipophilic chemicals from the dark ventral patch of males from different populations with different levels of intrasexual competition. Amongst all the compounds found, m-cresol, benzoic acid, cholesterol and 4-hydroxy-benzenopropanoic acid were the most abundant. The proportions of these compounds varied with age as well as with the level of intra-sexual competition, independently of age. In particular, red deer males experiencing higher intra-sexual competition had lower proportions of aromatic compounds (especially m-cresol) but higher proportions of carboxylic acids on their dark bellies. Males in a high male-male competition situation, invest in volatile compounds that can reveal their age, dominance status and condition, and that, in addition, enhance this signal. On the contrary, males from low intra-sexual competition populations have chemical profiles more characteristic of young individuals. This research shows a first glance of how secretion of volatile compounds of male deer can be modulated due to the intensity of male-male competition in the population."
https://openalex.org/W2971538710,"Skeletal muscle myosin has potent procoagulant activity that is based on its ability to enhance thrombin generation due to binding coagulation factors Xa and Va and accelerating prothrombin activation. A well-studied myosin inhibitor that binds to myosin's neck region inhibits myosin-dependent prothrombin activation. Hence, to identify a potential binding site(s) on skeletal muscle myosin for factor Xa, 19 peptides (25-40 residues) representing the neck region, which consists of a regulatory light chain, an essential light chain, and a heavy chain (HC), were screened for inhibition of myosin-supported prothrombin activation. Peptide HC796-835 comprising residues 796-835 of the heavy chain strongly inhibited myosin-enhanced prothrombin activation by factors Xa and Va (50% inhibition at 1.2 μm), but it did not inhibit phospholipid vesicle-enhanced prothrombin activation. Peptide inhibition studies also implicated several myosin light chain sequences located near HC796-835 as potential procoagulant sites. A peptide comprising HC796-835's C-terminal half, but not a peptide comprising its N-terminal half, inhibited myosin-enhanced prothrombin activation (50% inhibition at 1.2 μm). This inhibitory peptide (HC816-837) did not inhibit phospholipid-enhanced prothrombin activation, indicating its specificity for inhibition of myosin-dependent procoagulant mechanisms. Binding studies showed that purified factor Xa was bound to immobilized peptides HC796-835 and HC816-837 with apparent Kd values of 0.78 and 1.3 μm, respectively. In summary, these studies imply that HC residues 816-835 in the neck region of the skeletal muscle myosin directly bind factor Xa and, with contributions from light chain residues in this neck region, contribute to provision of myosin's procoagulant surface."
https://openalex.org/W2971638742,"Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is widely regarded as a major public health concern with last resort MRSA treatments like vancomycin now encountering resistant strains. TFDs (Transcription Factor Decoys) are oligonucleotide copies of the DNA-binding sites for transcription factors. They bind to and sequester the targeted transcription factor, thus inhibiting transcription of many genes. By developing TFDs with sequences aimed at inhibiting transcription factors controlling the expression of highly conserved bacterial cell wall proteins, TFDs present as a potential method for inhibiting microbial growth without encountering typical resistance mechanisms. However, the efficient protection and delivery of the TFDs inside the bacterial cells is a critical step for the success of this technology. Therefore, in our study, specific TFDs against S. aureus were complexed with two different types of nanocarriers: cationic nanostructured lipid carriers (cNLCs) and chitosan-based nanoparticles (CS-NCs). These TFD-carrier nanocomplexes were characterized for size, zeta potential and TFD complexation or loading efficiency in a variety of buffers. In vitro activity of the nanocomplexes was examined alone and in combination with vancomycin, first in methicillin susceptible strains of S. aureus with the lead candidate advancing to tests against MRSA cultures. Results found that both cNLCs and chitosan-based carriers were adept at complexing and protecting TFDs in a range of physiological and microbiological buffers up to 72 hours. From initial testing, chitosan-TFD particles demonstrated no visible improvements in effect when co-administered with vancomycin. However, co-delivery of cNLC-TFD with vancomycin reduced the MIC of vancomycin by over 50% in MSSA and resulted in significant decreases in viability compared with vancomycin alone in MRSA cultures. Furthermore, these TFD-loaded particles demonstrated very low levels of cytotoxicity and haemolysis in vitro. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at a combined antibiotic/oligonucleotide-TFD approach to combatting MRSA and, as such, highlights a new avenue of MRSA treatment combining traditional small molecules drugs and bacterial gene inhibition."
https://openalex.org/W2972003357,"The unknown role of the carrier protein transthyretin (TTR) in mechanisms of functional recovery in the postischemic brain prompted us to study its expression following experimental stroke. Male C57/B6 mice (age 9 to 10 weeks) were subjected to permanent focal ischemia induced by photothrombosis (PT) and brain tissues were analyzed for ttr expression and TTR levels at 24 hours, 48 hours, 7 days and 14 days following the insult by RT-PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Fourteen days after PT, non-specific TTR-like immunoreactive globules were found in the ischemic core and surrounding peri-infarct region by immunohistochemistry that could not be allocated to DAPI positive cells. No TTR immunoreactivity was found when stainings were performed with markers for neurons (Neuronal Nuclei, NeuN), reactive astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein, GFAP) or microglia (cluster of differentiation 68, CD68). In addition, we could not find TTR by immunoblotting in protein extracts obtained from the ischemic territory nor ttr expression by RT-PCR at all time points following PT. In all experiments, ttr expression in the choroid plexus and TTR in the mouse serum served as positive controls and recombinant legumain peptide as negative control. Together, our results indicate that TTR is not synthesized in brain resident cells in the ischemic infarct core and adjacent peri-infarct area. Thus, it seems unlikely that in situ synthesized TTR is involved in mechanisms of tissue reorganization during the first 14 days following PT."

Molecular assays, which are more sensitive and specific, are now increasingly used for identification and screening. Here, the molecular epidemiology of cryptosporidiosis is explored for the first time. Samples from 33 patients infected during an outbreak of 146 laboratory confirmed cases that occurred in Haifa and Western Galilee in 2015 were genotyped, as well as samples from 36 patients sporadically infected during 2014–2018 in different regions. The results suggest that Cryptosporidium subtypes found in Israel are more similar to those reported in the neighboring countries Jordan and Egypt than in European countries. C. hominis was the predominant species in the center and the north of Israel, implicating human-to-human transmission. C. hominis IeA11G3T3 was the most prevalent subtype contributing to morbidity."
https://openalex.org/W2972028500,"Tree stems swell and shrink daily, which is thought to reflect changes in the volume of water within stem tissues. We observed these daily patterns using automatic dendrometer bands in a diverse group of mangrove species over five mangrove forests across Australia and New Caledonia. We found that mangrove stems swelled during the day and shrank at night. Maximum swelling was highly correlated with daily maxima in air temperature. Variation in soil salinity and levels of tidal inundation did not influence the timing of stem swelling over all species. Medium-term increases in stem circumference were highly sensitive to rainfall. We defoliated trees to assess the role of foliar transpiration in stem swelling and shrinking. Defoliated trees showed maintenance of the pattern of daytime swelling, indicating that processes other than canopy transpiration influence the temporary stem diameter increments, which could include thermal swelling of stems. More research is required to understand the processes contributing to stem shrinking and swelling. Automatic Dendrometer Bands could provide a useful tool for monitoring the response of mangroves to extreme climatic events as they provide high-frequency, long-term, and large-scale information on tree water status."

The objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of PDR in Cuban adults infected with HIV-1.A cross-sectional study in Cuban adults infected with HIV-1 over 18 years was conducted. The probability proportional to size method for the selection of municipalities and patients without a prior history of antiretroviral treatment during the period from January 2017 to June 2017 was used. The plasma from 141 patients from 15 municipalities for the determination of viral subtype and HIV drug resistance was collected. Some clinical and epidemiological variables were evaluated.80. 9% of the patients corresponded to the male sex and 76.3% were men who have sex with other men (MSM). The median CD4 count was 371 cells / mm3 and the median viral load was 68000 copies / mL. The predominant genetic variants were subtype B (26.9%), CRF19_cpx (24.1%), CRF 20, 23, 24_BG (23.4%) and CRF18_cpx (12%). Overall, the prevalence of PDR was 29.8% (95%, CI 22.3-38.1). The prevalence was 12.8% (95%, CI 6.07-16.9) for any nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), 23.4% (95%, CI 16.7-31.3) for any non-reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) and 1.4% (95%, CI 0.17-5.03) for any protease inhibitor (PI). The most frequent mutations detected were K103N (12.9%), G190A (6.4%) and Y181C (4.8%).The NNRTI prevalence above 10% in our study indicates that the first-line antiretroviral therapy in Cuba may be less effective and supports the need to look for new treatment options that contribute to therapeutic success and help the country achieve the global goals 90-90-90 set forth by UNAIDS."
https://openalex.org/W2971816730,"Background Chronic fluid overload is common in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and can with time lead to poor prognosis regarding to the cardiovascular events. Serum NT-proBNP and OH/ECW might reflect fluid status of the patients, and the maximal tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRVmax) could reflect systolic pulmonary artery pressure (SPAP). We investigated the relationship between markers of volume status and marker of pulmonary hypertension (PH) in non-dialysis CKD5 (CKD5-ND) patients. Methods Bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS), echocardiography, and measurement of serum NT-proBNP were performed in 137 consecutive patients on the same day. TRVmax greater than or equal to 2.9 m/s, corresponding to SPAP of approximately 36 mmHg, was used as a definition of the possibility of PH in the absence of left heart disease and chronic respiratory disease (PH group). Results Patients with possibility of PH (TRVmax ≥ 2.9 m/s) was found in 27 (19.70%) patients. Among the values obtained from BIS, those reflecting the fluid balance (OH, OH/ECW, and E/I ratio) were significantly higher in the PH group. The OH/ECW in patients with PH were significantly higher than those patients without (26.76 ± 15.07 vs. 13.09 ± 15.05, P < 0.001). NT-proBNP was also significantly higher in PH group compared to the non-PH group (median = 10,112 pg/ml, IQR = 30,847 pg/ml vs. median = 1,973 pg/ml, IQR = 7,093 pg/ml, P < 0.001). OH/ECW was positively associated with TRVmax (r = 0.235, P = 0.006). Multivariate logistic regression revealed that increased OH/ECW and serum NT-proBNP were significantly associated with an increased risk of PH. Conclusions A significant number of patients showed increased TRVmax, which was closely related to volume status in CKD5-ND patients. Echocardiography and BIS could be important players in a high possibility of PH detection and treatment in asymptomatic CKD patients. Therefore, these measures could be helpful to improve the cardiac outcomes after initiating renal replacement therapy. Further research may be needed to validate the consistency of this association across other stages of CKD."
https://openalex.org/W2971383600,"The relationship between hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions in environmental water and hair was investigated for both domestic cats (Felis catus) and dogs (Canis lupus familiaris). A strong, but different, covariance was measured between the hydrogen and oxygen stable isotopic compositions of local precipitation and hair keratin from both cats and dogs. These isotopic differences are most likely a result of the differences between the dietary and drinking water needs of cats compared to dogs. Moreover, the δ2H and δ18O values of hair from captive and wild felids and canids, such as cougars (Puma concolor), bobcats (Lynx rufus), and wolves (Canis lupus) are broadly consistent with these measurements. This evidence indicates that while the water budgets of terrestrial mammalian carnivores need to be considered in isotopic applications, it is clear that felids and canids may be placed on tissue-specific hydrogen and oxygen isotopic landscapes for ecological, provenance, or forensic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2971949235,"Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) is a technique allowing visualization and quantification of over 40 biological parameters in a single experiment with subcellular spatial resolution, however most IMC experiments are limited to endpoint analysis with antibodies and DNA stains. Small molecules containing tellurium are promising probes for IMC due to their cell permeability, synthetic versatility, and most importantly their application to sequential labelling with isotopologous probes (SLIP) experiments. SLIP experiments with tellurium-containing probes allow quantification of intracellular biology at multiple timepoints with IMC. Despite the promise of tellurium in IMC, there are unique challenges in image processing associated with tellurium IMC data. Here, we address some of these issues by demonstrating the removal of xenon background signal, combining channels to improve signal-to-noise ratio, and calculating isotope transmission efficiency biases. These developments add accuracy to the unique temporal resolution afforded by tellurium IMC probes."
https://openalex.org/W2972070202,"Introduction Reproducible research is increasingly gaining interest in the research community. Automating the production of research manuscript tables from statistical software can help increase the reproducibility of findings. Logistic regression is used in studying disease prevalence and associated factors in epidemiological studies and can be easily performed using widely available software including SAS, SUDAAN, Stata or R. However, output from these software must be processed further to make it readily presentable. There exists a number of procedures developed to organize regression output, though many of them suffer limitations of flexibility, complexity, lack of validation checks for input parameters, as well as inability to incorporate survey design. Methods We developed a SAS macro, %svy_logistic_regression, for fitting simple and multiple logistic regression models. The macro also creates quality publication-ready tables using survey or non-survey data which aims to increase transparency of data analyses. It further significantly reduces turn-around time for conducting analysis and preparing output tables while also addressing the limitations of existing procedures. In addition, the macro allows for user-specific actions to handle missing data as well as use of replication-based variance estimation methods. Results We demonstrate the use of the macro in the analysis of the 2013–2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a complex survey designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. The output presented here is directly from the macro and is consistent with how regression results are often presented in the epidemiological and biomedical literature, with unadjusted and adjusted model results presented side by side. Conclusions The SAS code presented in this macro is comprehensive, easy to follow, manipulate and to extend to other areas of interest. It can also be incorporated quickly by the statistician for immediate use. It is an especially valuable tool for generating quality, easy to review tables which can be incorporated directly in a publication."
https://openalex.org/W2972281041,"For small-scale societies, transitions from self-sufficiency to cash-based labor in market economies have been associated with the exacerbation of existing, and the emergence of new, social incongruities. Social incongruity occurs when two or more of a person’s status determinants (e.g. age, gender, wealth) conflict, resulting in reduced social status. A central focus of theory and research on social incongruity is the relationship between the cultural prototype of what is needed to live a good life–or lifestyle–and status determinants. Assessment of status determinants is challenging because of their relative nature at multiple levels of analysis. This study uses theory and methods from cognitive anthropology to investigate whether and how individual knowledge of a cultural lifestyle prototype conflicts with status determinants at two levels of economic transition among 101 adults from a small-scale society of forager-horticulturalists in Bolivian Amazonia, the Tsimane’. Results support cultural consensus in a 38-item model labeled market lifestyle (explaining 72.7% of sample variance). While the model includes both overlapping traditional (e.g. weaving) and market-related (e.g. education) items and behaviors, most market alternatives were rated higher. When market lifestyle was tested for social incongruity against other status determinants, only gender predicted variation. Thematically, when lifestyle was stratified by gender, men rated several items of relational wealth higher than women did. Analysis of model residual agreement revealed heterogeneity in the form of a syncretic lifestyle model (explaining 18.2% of additional variance). Participants whose knowledge better matched syncretic lifestyle rated traditional items and market alternatives closer to parity. Agreement with the syncretic model correlated with lower material wealth and less market integration. In sum, the findings document a modern, market-oriented form of Tsimane’ lifestyle that varies ontologically from past modelling and ethnographic accounts in preferred forms of livelihood and wealth."

Dysregulation of both protein kinase and protein phosphatase activity is common in many human diseases, including cancer.

WT P53-Induced Phosphatase 1 (WIP1), 5The abbreviation used is: WIP1WT P53-Induced Phosphatase 1. encoded by the PPM1D gene, is a serine/threonine protein phosphatase belonging to the PPM (formerly PP2C) family. WIP1 was first described as a protein induced by P53 in response to ionizing radiation (8Fiscella M. Zhang H. Fan S. Sakaguchi K. Shen S. Mercer W.E. Vande Woude G.F. O'Connor P.M. Appella E.

For example, a biochemical assay measuring the hydrolysis of FDP by WIP1 contributed to the discovery of GSK2830371 (29Gilmartin A.G. Faitg T.H. Richter M. Groy A. Seefeld M.A. Darcy M.G. Peng X.

However, compared with phosphopeptides from native substrates, the activity of WIP1 toward the small-molecule substrates, pNPP and FDP, is substantially lower (Fig. 1). Additionally, the use of artificial substrates in HTS can lead to the identification of hits with reduced biological and pharmacological relevance. For example, discrepancies in the potencies of Nucleotide Pyrophosphatase/Phosphodiesterase 1 (NPP1) inhibitors, depending on the substrate used, have been reported (41Chang L. Lee S.Y. Leonczak P.

Full-length phosphoprotein substrates need to be co-expressed with a kinase or phosphorylated in vitro and often show poor solubility, which make them challenging for HTS applications (43Sergienko E.A. Phosphatase high-throughput screening assay design and selection.Methods Mol. Biol. 2013; 1053 (23860645): 7-2510.1007/978-1-62703-562-0_2Crossref PubMed Scopus (2) Google Scholar, 44Acker M.G.

Phosphopeptide substrates have a greater physiological relevance than artificial small-molecule substrates and have also been successfully incorporated into WIP1 activity assays for HTS. One study utilized the IQTM Phosphatase Assay technology (Pierce), based on fluorescence intensity quenching of a fluorophore-labeled peptide after a proprietary iron-containing compound binds the phosphoryl group (45Belova G.I. Demidov O.N. Fornace Jr., A.J. Bulavin D.V. Chemical inhibition of Wip1 phosphatase contributes to suppression of tumorigenesis.Cancer Biol. Ther. 2005; 4 (16258255): 1154-115810.4161/cbt.4.10.2204Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Another study applied AlphaScreen technology (PerkinElmer) to measure phosphorylation of a biotinylated phospho-P38 peptide with a mouse phospho-specific anti-P38 mAb (46Rayter S. Elliott R. Travers J. Rowlands M.G. Richardson T.B. Boxall K. Jones K. Linardopoulos S. Workman P. Aherne W. Lord C.J. Ashworth A. A chemical inhibitor of PPM1D that selectively kills cells overexpressing PPM1D.Oncogene. 2008; 27 (17700519): 1036-104410.1038/sj.onc.1210729Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The AlphaScreen signal is proportional to the proximity of streptavidin-coated donor beads and anti-mouse IgG-coated acceptor beads. Both of these assay formats required conjugation of a label to the phosphopeptide substrate (rhodamine fluorophore or biotin), which can alter the interaction between the substrate and enzyme. Also, both assays measure the substrate concentration (phosphorylated peptide) rather than the reaction products (dephosphorylated peptide or Pi), which means that the assay sensitivity is limited in the early phase of the reaction with 15–20% substrate turnover. Here we report the development, optimization, and validation of orthogonal WIP1 activity assays using unmodified native phosphopeptide substrates. The first assay uses RapidFire MS to quantify the dephosphorylated reaction product in a 384-well format. The second assay applies a previously described phosphate binding protein with a red-shifted fluorescence reporter (47Okoh M.P. Hunter J.L. Corrie J.E. Webb M.R.

Both optimized assays were validated by screening the NCATS Pharmaceutical Collection (NPC) (49Huang R. Southall N. Wang Y. Yasgar A. Shinn P. Jadhav A. Nguyen D.T. Austin C.P. The NCGC pharmaceutical collection: a comprehensive resource of clinically approved drugs enabling repurposing and chemical genomics.Sci. Transl.

Confirmed hits from the primary screens were further evaluated by a variety of additional assays to characterize their activities, including binding studies by surface plasmon resonance (SPR). We developed a sensitive assay in a 384-well format to measure WIP1 activity toward a phosphopeptide substrate using RapidFire MS to quantify the dephosphorylated reaction product (Fig. 2A). Following quenching of the reaction with formic acid, accurate product quantification was enabled by spiking assay samples with 1 μm of a 13C-labeled product analyte as an internal calibration standard. The integrated detection peak areas were linear for concentrations of the peptide standard between 0 and 2.5 μm (R2 = 0.94, Fig. 2B). The limit of quantitation (LOQ) for the reaction product peptide was determined to be 28.3 nm (Fig. 2C). The previously described WIP1 inhibitor GSK2830371 was used as a control for 100% enzyme inhibition and the optimized assay was robust with a signal-to-background value of 80 and Z′-factor value of 0.74 (Fig. 2D). Addition of DMSO vehicle up to 1.9% (v/v) did not reduce assay performance (Fig. 2E). The optimized RapidFire MS WIP1 activity assay was used to evaluate the initial reaction velocities with substrate concentrations ranging from 0.75 to 20 μm (Fig. 2F). The data were fit to the Michaelis-Menten model with an apparent Km value of 1.85 ± 0.14 μm (Fig. 2G).

This assay technology enables the use of any phosphopeptide substrate and provides a real-time measurement of WIP1 activity through detection of the reaction product, Pi (Fig. 3A). Moreover, the high sensitivity and dynamic range enabled miniaturization to a 1,536-well format. With 10 μm Rh-PBP, the red-fluorescence readout was linear for phosphate concentrations between 0 and 10 μm (Fig. 3B), with a 5-fold dynamic range. Inclusion of a phosphate standard curve in each microwell plate enables quantification of the phosphate concentration from the measured fluorescence. We measured the activity of WIP1 toward a phosphopeptide substrate derived from P53 as the rate of product formation over time and observed no reduction in the activity in the presence of DMSO vehicle concentrations up to 1.6% (v/v) (Fig. 3C). As expected, GSK2830371 reduced the WIP1 reaction rate in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D). GSK2830371 was used as a control for 100% enzyme inhibition and the optimized assay was robust with a Z′-factor value of 0.74 (Fig. 3E). Quantification of real-time activity is convenient for initial velocity measurements (Fig. 3F) to evaluate Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 3G), which enabled an estimation of the apparent Km of the phosphopeptide substrate at 10 μm. The optimized RapidFire MS WIP1 activity assay was validated by screening the NPC (49Huang R. Southall N. Wang Y. Yasgar A. Shinn P. Jadhav A. Nguyen D.T. Austin C.P.

https://openalex.org/W2971374243,"Previous research has demonstrated that people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) have difficulties with the perceptual discrimination of rhythms, relative to healthy controls. It is not however clear if this applies only to simpler rhythms (a so called “beat-based” deficit), or if it is a more generalized deficit that also applies to more complex rhythms. Further insight into how people with PD process and perceive rhythm can refine our understanding of the well known problems of temporal processing in the disease. In this study, we wanted to move beyond simple/complex-dichotomy in previous studies, and further investigate the effect of tempo on the perception of musical rhythms. To this end, we constructed ten musical rhythms with a varied degree of complexity across three different tempi. Nineteen people with PD and 19 healthy controls part-took in an internet based listening survey and rated 10 different musical rhythms for complexity and likeability. In what we believe is the first study to do so, we asked for the participants subjective ratings of individual rhythms and not their capacity to directly compare or discriminate between them. We found an overall between-group difference in complexity judgments that was modulated by tempo, but not level of complexity. People with PD rated all rhythms as more complex across tempi, with significant group differences in complexity ratings at 120 and 150bpm, but not at 90bpm. Our analysis found a uniform elevated baseline for complexity judgments in the PD-group, and a strong association between the two groups’ rank-ordering the rhythms for complexity. This indicates a preserved ability to discriminate between relative levels of complexity. Finally, the two groups did not significantly differ in their subjective scoring of likeability, demonstrating a dissimilarity between judgment of complexity and judgment of likeability between the two groups. This indicates different cognitive operations for the two types of judgment, and we speculate that Parkinson’s disease affects judgment of complexity but not judgment of likeability."
https://openalex.org/W2971894819,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common arrhythmia. Patients with valvular heart disease (VHD) frequently have AF. Growing evidence demonstrates that a specifically altered pattern of microRNA (miRNA) expression is related to valvular heart disease with atrial fibrillation (AF-VHD) processes. However, the combinatorial regulation by multiple miRNAs in inducing AF-VHD remains largely unknown.The work identified AF-VHD-specific miRNAs and their combinations through mapping miRNA expression profile into differential co-expression network. The expressions of some dysregulated miRNAs were measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The regulations of signaling pathways by the combinatorial miRNAs were predicted by enrichment analysis tools.Thirty-two differentially expressed (DE) miRNAs were identified to be AF-VHD-specific, some of which were new findings. These miRNAs interacted to form 5 combinations. qRT-PCR confirmed the different expression of several identified miRNAs, which illustrated the reliability and biomarker potentials of 32 dysregulation miRNAs. The biological characteristics of combinatorial miRNAs related to AF-VHD were highlighted. Twelve signaling pathways regulated by combinatorial miRNAs were predicted to be possibly associated with AF-VHD.The AF-VHD-related signaling pathways regulated by combinatorial miRNAs may play an important role in the occurrence of AF-VHD. The work brings new insights into biomarkers and miRNA combination regulation mechanism in AF-VHD as well as further biological experiments."

We quantified corneal neovascularization, induced by superficial silver nitrate cautery, in male and female inbred albino Sprague-Dawley, inbred albino Fischer 344, outbred pigmented Hooded Wistar and inbred pigmented Dark Agouti rats of a range of ages. Corneal neovascular area was quantified on haematoxylin-stained corneal flatmounts by image analysis. Pro-and anti-angiogenic gene expression was measured early in the neovascular response by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Androgen and estrogen receptor expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Male rats from all strains, with or without ocular pigmentation, exhibited significantly greater corneal neovascular area than females: Sprague-Dawley males 43±12% (n = 8), females 25±5% (n = 12), p = 0.001; Fischer 344 males 38±10% (n = 12) females 27±8% (n = 8) p = 0.043; Hooded Wistar males 32±6% (n = 8) females 22±5% (n = 12) p = 0.002; Dark Agouti males 37±11% (n = 9) females 26±7% (n = 9) p = 0.015. Corneal vascular endothelial cells expressed neither androgen nor estrogen receptor. The expression in cornea post-cautery of Cox-2, Vegf-a and Vegf-r2 was significantly higher in males compared with females and Vegf-r1 was significantly lower in the cornea of males compared to females, p<0.001 for each comparison. These data suggest that male corneas are primed for angiogenesis through a signalling nexus involving Cox-2, Vegf-a, and Vegf receptors 1 and 2. Our findings re-enforce that pre-clinical animal models of human diseases should account for sex-based differences in their design and highlight the need for well characterized and reproducible pre-clinical studies that include both male and female animals."
https://openalex.org/W2971609583,"Maternal undernutrition is known to reduce glomerular number but it may also affect tubulointerstitium, capillary density, and response to oxidative stress. To investigate whether the latter elements are affected, we examined the response to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), an established model of renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis, in the kidney of offspring from control and nutrient restricted rats. Six-week old male offspring from rats given food ad libitum (CON) and those subjected to 50% food restriction throughout pregnancy (NR) were subjected to UUO for 7 days. Body weight was significantly lower in NR. Systolic blood pressure and blood urea nitrogen increased similarly in CON and NR after UUO. Tubular necrosis in the obstructed kidney, on the other hand, was more extensive in NR. Also, the collagen area, a marker of fibrosis, of the obstructed kidney was significantly increased compared with the contralateral kidney only in NR. Capillary density was decreased similarly in the obstructed kidney of CON and NR compared with the contralateral kidney. Urine nitrate/nitrite, a marker of nitric oxide production, from the obstructed kidney was significantly increased in NR compared with CON. Nitrotyrosine, a marker of nitric oxide-mediated free radical injury, was increased in the obstructed kidney compared with the contralateral kidney in both CON and NR, but the extent was significantly greater in NR. In conclusion, more severe tubular necrosis and fibrosis after UUO was observed in NR, which was thought to be due to increased nitrosative stress."

It causes lymph nodes and pulmonary tuberculosis in patients living in countries of the Horn of Africa, including Djibouti. The environmental reservoirs of M. canettii are still unknown. We aimed to further decrypt these potential reservoirs by using an original approach of High-Throughput Carbon and Azote Substrate Profiling. The Biolog Phenotype profiling was performed on six clinical strains of M. canettii and one M. tuberculosis strain was used as a positive control. The experiments were duplicated and authenticated by negative controls. While M. tuberculosis metabolized 22/190 (11%) carbon substrates and 3/95 (3%) nitrogen substrates, 17/190 (8.9%) carbon substrates and three nitrogen substrates were metabolized by the six M. canettii strains forming the so-called corebiologome. A total at 16 carbon substrates and three nitrogen substrates were metabolized in common by M. tuberculosis and the six M. canettii strains. Moreover, at least one M. canettii strain metabolized 36/190 (19%) carbon substrates and 3/95 (3%) nitrogen substrates for a total of 39/285 (13%) substrates. Classifying these carbon and nitrogen substrates into ten potential environmental sources (plants, fruits and vegetables, bacteria, algae, fungi, nematodes, mollusks, mammals, insects and inanimate environment) significantly associated carbon and nitrogen substrates metabolized by at least one M. canettii strain with plants (p = 0.006). These results suggest that some plants endemic in the Horn of Africa may serve as ecological niches for M. canettii. Further ethnobotanical studies will indicate plant usages by local populations, then guiding field microbiological investigations in order to prove the definite environmental reservoirs of this opportunistic tuberculous pathogen."

In this study, we demonstrated that SCTR/AT1R complex can mediate ANGII-induced aldosterone secretion/release through potentiating calcium mobilization. Through IHC and cAMP studies, we showed the presence of functional SCTR and AT1R in the primary zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells of C57BL/6N (C57), and functional AT1R and non-functional SCTR in SCTR knockout (SCTR-/-) mice. Calcium mobilization studies revealed the important role of SCTR on ANGII-mediated calcium mobilization in adrenal gland. The fluo4-AM loaded primary adrenal ZG cells from the C57 mice displayed a dose-dependent increase in intracellular calcium influx ([Ca2+]i) when exposed to ANGII but not from the SCTR-/- ZG cells. Synthetic SCTR transmembrane (TM) peptides STM-II/-IV were able to alter [Ca2+]i in C57 mice, but not the mice with mutated STM-II/-IV (STM-IIm/IVm) peptides. Through enzyme immunoassay (EIA), we measured the aldosterone release from primary ZG cells of both C57 and SCTR-/- mice by exposing them to ANGII (10nM). SCTR-/- ZG cells showed impaired ANGII-induced aldosterone secretion compared to the C57 mice. TM peptide, STM-II hindered the aldosterone secretion in ZG cells of C57 mice. These findings support the involvement of SCTR/AT1R heterodimer complex in aldosterone secretion/release through [Ca2+]i."
https://openalex.org/W2971593007,"Identification of the most influential spreaders that maximize information propagation in social networks is a classic optimization problem, called the influence maximization (IM) problem. A reasonable diffusion model that can accurately simulate information propagation in social networks is the key step to efficiently solving the IM problem. Synergism of neighbor nodes plays an important role in information propagation dynamics. Some known diffusion models have considered the reinforcement mechanism in defining the activation threshold. Most of these models focus on the synergetic effects of nodes on their common neighbors, but the accumulation of synergism has been neglected in previous studies. Inspired by these facts, we first discuss the catalytic role of synergism in the spreading dynamics of social networks and then propose a novel diffusion model called the synergism-based three-step cascade model (TSSCM) based on the above analysis and the three-degree influence theory. Finally, we devise an algorithm for solving the IM problem based on the TSSCM. Experiments on five real large-scale social networks demonstrate the efficacy of our method, which achieves competitive results in terms of influence spreading compared to the four other algorithms tested."
