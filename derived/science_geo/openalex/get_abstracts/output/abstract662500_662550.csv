https://openalex.org/W3094609450,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which is the cause of a present pandemic, infects human lung alveolar type 2 (hAT2) cells. Characterizing pathogenesis is crucial for developing vaccines and therapeutics. However, the lack of models mirroring the cellular physiology and pathology of hAT2 cells limits the study. Here, we develop a feeder-free, long-term, three-dimensional (3D) culture technique for hAT2 cells derived from primary human lung tissue and investigate infection response to SARS-CoV-2. By imaging-based analysis and single-cell transcriptome profiling, we reveal rapid viral replication and the increased expression of interferon-associated genes and proinflammatory genes in infected hAT2 cells, indicating a robust endogenous innate immune response. Further tracing of viral mutations acquired during transmission identifies full infection of individual cells effectively from a single viral entry. Our study provides deep insights into the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 and the application of defined 3D hAT2 cultures as models for respiratory diseases."
https://openalex.org/W3097882514,"In late 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first detected in China and has since caused a pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The first case of COVID-19 in New York City was officially confirmed on 1 March 2020 followed by a severe local epidemic1. Here, to understand seroprevalence dynamics, we conduct a retrospective, repeated cross-sectional analysis of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies in weekly intervals from the beginning of February to July 2020 using more than 10,000 plasma samples from patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. We describe the dynamics of seroprevalence in an 'urgent care' group, which is enriched in cases of COVID-19 during the epidemic, and a 'routine care' group, which more closely represents the general population. Seroprevalence increased at different rates in both groups; seropositive samples were found as early as mid-February, and levelled out at slightly above 20% in both groups after the epidemic wave subsided by the end of May. From May to July, seroprevalence remained stable, suggesting lasting antibody levels in the population. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 was introduced in New York City earlier than previously documented and describe the dynamics of seroconversion over the full course of the first wave of the pandemic in a major metropolitan area."

Although neurons can release stimulatory factors to accelerate PDAC tumorigenesis, the metabolic contribution of peripheral axons has not been explored. We found that peripheral axons release serine (Ser) to support the growth of exogenous Ser (exSer)-dependent PDAC cells during Ser/Gly (glycine) deprivation. Ser deprivation resulted in ribosomal stalling on two of the six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF) by PDAC cells to promote tumor innervation. Consistent with this, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors grew slower and displayed enhanced innervation in mice on a Ser/Gly-free diet. Blockade of compensatory neuronal innervation using LOXO-101, a Trk-NGF inhibitor, further decreased PDAC tumor growth. Our data indicate that axonal-cancer metabolic crosstalk is a critical adaptation to support PDAC growth in nutrient poor environments.

Our data indicate that axonal-cancer metabolic crosstalk is a critical adaptation to support PDAC growth in nutrient poor environments. A common symptom of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients is neuropathic pain that can necessitate invasive procedures for palliation. Indeed, a majority of PDAC tumors display perineural invasion, which is associated with poor patient outcomes (Ceyhan et al., 2009bCeyhan G.O. Demir I.E. Rauch U. Bergmann F. Müller M.W. Büchler M.W.

Along these lines, genetic analyses of PDAC have revealed frequent mutations in regulators of axon guidance, suggesting a role for neuronal support in tumorigenesis (Biankin et al., 2012Biankin A.V.

Furthermore, surgical denervation or ablation of nerves with capsaicin increases survival of PDAC-bearing mice (Renz et al., 2018aRenz B.W. Takahashi R. Tanaka T. Macchini M. Hayakawa Y. Dantes Z.

To date, the mechanisms have focused on the release of neurotrophic factors or neurotransmitters into the tumor. Another defining feature of PDAC is an extraordinary metabolic plasticity, which allows them to adapt to nutrient poor environments by upregulating scavenging pathways, such as autophagy (Perera et al., 2015Perera R.M. Stoykova S. Nicolay B.N. Ross K.N. Fitamant J. Boukhali M. Lengrand J. Deshpande V. Selig M.K.

Neurons also are known to release amino acid-derived neurotransmitters, such as glycine (Gly) and D-serine (Monaghan et al., 1989Monaghan D.T. Bridges R.J. Cotman C.W.

Toxicol. 1999; 39: 431-456Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar), which raises the possibility that neurons can support the metabolic needs of PDAC cells in nutrient-poor environments via their peripheral axons. However, the metabolic contribution of nerves in PDAC tumors has not been explored. Serine (Ser) is a conditionally essential amino acid (AA) that can be obtained from the microenvironment or produced via the Ser biosynthesis pathway (SBP) from glucose and is the second most abundant AA found in human proteins (Mauro and Chappell, 2014Mauro V.P. Chappell S.A. A critical analysis of codon optimization in human therapeutics.Trends Mol. Med. 2014; 20: 604-613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Ser is also used to generate Gly, which can be used to synthesize proteins or glutathione. It also participates in the production of certain lipids and the folate cycle to generate one-carbon units required for the synthesis of nucleotides and methylation units (Gantner et al., 2019Gantner M.L. Eade K. Wallace M. Handzlik M.K. Fallon R. Trombley J. Bonelli R. Giles S. Harkins-Perry S. Heeren T.F.C. et al.Serine and Lipid Metabolism in Macular Disease and Peripheral Neuropathy.N. Engl. J.

Vousden K.H. Serine and one-carbon metabolism in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2016; 16: 650-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). Because Ser is necessary for multiple metabolic pathways, it can become rate-limiting for growth and survival for several types of cancers (Sullivan et al., 2019Sullivan M.R. Mattaini K.R. Dennstedt E.A. Nguyen A.A. Sivanand S. Reilly M.F. Meeth K. Muir A. Darnell A.M. Bosenberg M.W. et al.Increased Serine Synthesis Provides an Advantage for Tumors Arising in Tissues Where Serine Levels Are Limiting.Cell Metab. 2019; 29: 1410-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, mouse PDAC cells derived from the genetically engineered KPC (KrasG12D/+; Tp53flox/+; Pdx-Cre) model can upregulate SBP enzymes and are insensitive to Ser limitation (Maddocks et al., 2017Maddocks O.D.K. Athineos D. Cheung E.C. Lee P. Zhang T. van den Broek N.J.F. Mackay G.M. Labuschagne C.F. Gay D. Kruiswijk F. et al.Modulating the therapeutic response of tumours to dietary serine and glycine starvation.Nature. 2017; 544: 372-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Whether human PDAC cells also upregulate the SBP or whether there are other mechanisms of obtaining extracellular Ser is not clear. In this study, we investigated the role of peripheral axons in providing metabolic support to PDAC cells in nutrient-deprived environments. We found a subset of human PDAC cell lines that lacked expression of the SBP enzymes and were dependent on exogenous Ser (exSer) for growth. We demonstrate that axons release AA, such as Ser, and this is able to rescue growth of exSer-dependent PDAC cells in Ser/Gly-deprived conditions. Surprisingly, Ser deprivation specifically decreased the mRNA translation efficiency of two out of six Ser codons, TCC and TCT, and allowed the selective translation and secretion of nerve growth factor (NGF). Consistent with these observations, exSer-dependent PDAC tumors from mice on Ser/Gly-free diet were smaller and exhibited increased tumor innervation when Ser is limiting. These data establish a metabolic axis between PDAC and neurons to promote tumor growth under nutrient-poor conditions. Neurons that innervate tumors are conceptually ideal to supply nutrients to poorly perfused areas in the tumor microenvironment. While the axons may be located in the nutrient-poor tumor, the neuronal cell body has access to high levels of nutrients in the circulation. We assessed whether the axons of sensory nerves could supply nutrients through secretion of metabolites. Rat dorsal root ganglion cells (DRGs) were grown in microfluidic devices that isolated axons from the neuronal body (Figures 1A–1C; Taylor et al., 2005Taylor A.M. Blurton-Jones M. Rhee S.W. Cribbs D.H. Cotman C.W. Jeon N.L. A microfluidic culture platform for CNS axonal injury, regeneration and transport.Nat. Methods. 2005; 2: 599-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (788) Google Scholar), simulating the in vivo situation, whereby the tumors are only exposed to the axons. Hydrostatic pressure was established to isolate the nutrient-deprived axonal media from the nutrient-rich neuronal media. Conditioned media collected from the axonal side had increased levels of several AA, including Ser (35% D-Ser and 65% L-Ser) and Gly (Figures 1D and 1E). We focused on Ser, because unlike other AA that can be obtained by macropinocytosis, serum albumin does not contribute to the intracellular Ser pools in PDAC (Davidson et al., 2017Davidson S.M. Jonas O. Keibler M.A. Hou H.W. Luengo A. Mayers J.R. Wyckoff J. Del Rosario A.M. Whitman M. Chin C.R. et al.Direct evidence for cancer-cell-autonomous extracellular protein catabolism in pancreatic tumors.Nat. Med. 2017; 23: 235-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Ser has gained recent attention as critical in supporting growth of several cancer types. Interestingly, the release of Ser and Gly from axons was not action potential-dependent (Figures 1F and S1A), and axons were able to secrete Ser and Gly when cultured in a range of Ser/Gly concentrations (Figure 1G). Together, these data indicate that axons can release AA into nutrient-poor environments.Figure S1A Subset of Human, but Not Mouse, PDAC Cells Require ExSer for Growth, Related to Figures 1 and 2Show full caption(A), Representative traces (left) of spontaneous action potentials, depolarization-evoked action potentials and Na+ currents in the absence (black), presence (red), and washout (blue) of 1μM TTX in rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons.

Pearson correlation values are represented by r (M-O). (∗p < 0.05, ∗∗p < 0.01, ∗∗∗p < 0.005, ∗∗∗∗p < 0.0001). Mouse KPC PDAC cells can upregulate Ser synthesis and are insensitive to Ser/Gly starvation (Figure S1B). By contrast, we find that human PDAC cells show heterogeneity in their dependency on exSer with ∼40% of human PDAC cell lines being completely dependent on exSer for proliferation under various nutrient conditions (Figures 2A, 2B , and S1C). Furthermore, exSer-dependent PDAC cells exhibit a dose-dependent growth over a range of Ser concentrations (Figure S1D) and are incapable of adapting even after long periods of Ser/Gly deprivation (Figure S1E). Unlike exSer-independent PDAC cells, exSer-dependent PDAC cells lack the expression and ability to upregulate PHGDH and PSAT1 to convert glucose into Ser (Figures 2C–2F, S1F, and S1G). Ectopic expression of PHGDH and/or PSAT1 was not sufficient to restore growth of exSer-dependent PDAC cells in Ser/Gly-deprived conditions. However, after long-term culture, only exSer-dependent PDAC clones expressing both PHGDH and PSAT1 were able to adapt to the absence of Ser/Gly (Figures S1H and S1I). Adapted PHGDH and PSAT1-expressing PDAC cells expressed higher levels of the SBP enzymes and were able to grow in the absence of Ser/Gly (Figures S1I and S1J). Together, these data indicate that high expression of SBP enzymes are required to grow in the absence of Ser/Gly. We also found that ∼40% of human PDAC tumors lacked PHGDH (Figures 2G and 2H). However, expression of SBP genes were not associated with molecular subtypes in PDAC cell lines or clinical samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas (The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017The Cancer Genome Atlas Research NetworkIntegrated Genomic Characterization of Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma.Cancer Cell. 2017; 32: 185-203Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar; Figures S1K and S1L; Table S1). The inability to express and upregulate sufficient levels of SBP genes was observed to be negatively associated with methylation levels (Figures S1M–S1O), suggestive of epigenetic or transcriptional issues in exSer-dependent PDAC cells. ExSer-dependent PDAC growth in Ser/Gly-deprived media was rescued when co-cultured with axons (Figures 3A and 3B ). Because axons were found to release both L- and D-Ser, and reported to form synaptic gap junctions with gliomas (Venkataramani et al., 2019Venkataramani V. Tanev D.I. Strahle C. Studier-Fischer A. Fankhauser L. Kessler T. Körber C. Kardorff M. Ratliff M.

Ni L. et al.Electrical and synaptic integration of glioma into neural circuits.Nature. 2019; 573: 539-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), we wanted to assess these effects on exSer-dependent PDAC cell growth. We found that the D-Ser was not able to restore growth in exSer-dependent PDAC cells under Ser/Gly-deprived conditions (Figure S2A). Furthermore, we did not observe gap junctions between axons and PDAC cells (Figures S2B and S2C; Abbaci et al., 2008Abbaci M. Barberi-Heyob M. Blondel W. Guillemin F. Didelon J. Advantages and limitations of commonly used methods to assay the molecular permeability of gap junctional intercellular communication.Biotechniques. 2008; 45: 33-52, 56–62Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Although axons were found to release ∼5 μM of Ser after 24 h, which is not sufficient to support proliferation in monoculture assays, axons likely restore growth by replenishing steady-state levels of Ser that are consumed by exSer-dependent PDAC cells in co-culture assays. Indeed, repeated supplementation of low dose of Ser was able to stimulate growth of exSer-dependent PDAC cells (Figure S2D). Together, these observations indicate that neurons are able to release sufficient levels of L-Ser via their axons to metabolically support PDAC cells.Figure S2ExSer-Dependent PDAC Cells Require L-Ser from Nerves to Grow in Ser/Gly-Deprived Media, Related to Figure 3Show full caption(A), Growth of PATU-8902 (exSer-dependent) cells in the absence of L-Ser and Gly or L-Ser alone in presence of several concentrations of exogenous D-Serine after 48 hours (n = 3 technical replicates and repeated once).(B), Schematic of outcomes if synaptic gap junctions form between nerves and exSer-dependent PDAC cells 6 days after co-culture in the microfluidics device.

https://openalex.org/W3097539776,"Hydroamination of alkenes, the addition of the N-H bond of an amine across an alkene, is a fundamental, yet challenging, organic transformation that creates an alkylamine from two abundant chemical feedstocks, alkenes and amines, with full atom economy1-3. The reaction is particularly important because amines, especially chiral amines, are prevalent substructures in a wide range of natural products and drugs. Although extensive efforts have been dedicated to developing catalysts for hydroamination, the vast majority of alkenes that undergo intermolecular hydroamination have been limited to conjugated, strained, or terminal alkenes2-4; only a few examples occur by the direct addition of the N-H bond of amines across unactivated internal alkenes5-7, including photocatalytic hydroamination8,9, and no asymmetric intermolecular additions to such alkenes are known. In fact, current examples of direct, enantioselective intermolecular hydroamination of any type of unactivated alkene lacking a directing group occur with only moderate enantioselectivity10-13. Here we report a cationic iridium system that catalyses intermolecular hydroamination of a range of unactivated, internal alkenes, including those in both acyclic and cyclic alkenes, to afford chiral amines with high enantioselectivity. The catalyst contains a phosphine ligand bearing trimethylsilyl-substituted aryl groups and a triflimide counteranion, and the reaction design includes 2-amino-6-methylpyridine as the amine to enhance the rates of multiple steps within the catalytic cycle while serving as an ammonia surrogate. These design principles point the way to the addition of N-H bonds of other reagents, as well as O-H and C-H bonds, across unactivated internal alkenes to streamline the synthesis of functional molecules from basic feedstocks."
https://openalex.org/W3096777956,"Psoriasis is an inflammatory and chronic skin disorder associated with physical and psychological burden impairing patients’ quality of life. In the last decade, biologic drugs have widely changed treatment of moderate-severe psoriasis and their number is increasing overtime. To early identify expected/unexpected adverse events (AEs) with biologic treatments, pharmacovigilance programs are needed. We designed a post-marketing active pharmacovigilance program to monitor and analyse AEs and/or serious adverse events (SAEs) reports. All consecutive patients treated with one biologic drug during a two-years period and satisfying inclusion criteria have been enrolled in five Dermatology tertiary units. Demographic and clinical features of patients, type of treatment used, therapy discontinuation, failures, switch/swap to another biologic, and possible onset of AEs were collected. Overall, 512 patients with a diagnosis of psoriasis (286; 55.9%) or arthropathic psoriasis (226; 44.1%) have been enrolled. Eighty-two (16%) patients with AEs and 5 (1%) with SAEs have been identified. Further, 59 (11.5%) had a primary/secondary failure (mainly on infliximab and etanercept). The adverse events and SAEs were reported with golimumab (4/12), adalimumab (32/167), infliximab (9/48), etanercept (31/175) and ustekinumab (11/73), no adverse events have occurred with secukinumab (0/37). Infliximab and etanercept were significantly associated with primary/secondary failures, whereas no differences have been highlighted for AEs insurgence. On the other hand, ustekinumab seems to be associated with a low rate of AEs (p = 0.01) and no adverse events or failures have been reported with secukinumab (p = 0.04 and 0.03, respectively). Our study, even though limited by a small sample size and a brief follow-up period, provide useful data on widely used biologic drugs and their tolerability, discontinuation rate and the incurrence of severe adverse events. Further studies are necessary to include the recently approved biologic drugs and to increase the sample size for more detailed analysis."

Analyses of the signaling pathways required for development of the hPSC-derived endocardial cells identified a novel role for BMP10 in the specification of this lineage from cardiovascular mesoderm. One of the earliest stages of heart development is the formation of the primitive heart tube that consists of an inner layer of specialized endothelial cells, known as endocardial cells, surrounded by an outer layer of cardiomyocytes (Buijtendijk et al., 2020Buijtendijk M.F.J.

These endocardial cells play a pivotal role in heart development, as they are responsible for inducing the first functional population of cardiomyocytes, namely, trabecular cardiomyocytes that form the earliest heart muscle tissue known as trabecular myocardium (Del Monte-Nieto et al., 2018Del Monte-Nieto G.

Induction of the trabecular fate is mediated through neuregulin/ERBB2 signaling via neuregulin secreted by the endocardial cells. In addition to promoting trabecular development, the embryonic endocardium serves as the source of progenitors of several other cell types in the heart (Nakano et al., 2016Nakano A. Nakano H.

From a developmental perspective, the endocardium can be distinguished from other endothelial populations by the fact that it is specified from a progenitor population that expresses NKX2-5, a key cardiac transcription factor, and ISL1, a regulator of secondary heart field development (Cai et al., 2003Cai C.L.

Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 431-439PubMed Google Scholar). During endocardial development, NKX2-5 directly activates ETV2, a transcription factor essential for development of the endothelial and endocardial lineages (Ferdous et al., 2009Ferdous A.

USA. 2009; 106: 814-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Within the pool of NKX2-5+ progenitors, ETV2 functions to upregulate NFATC1 expression, which in turn promotes endocardial development at the expense of the cardiomyocyte fate (Palencia-Desai et al., 2011Palencia-Desai S. Kohli V. Kang J. Chi N.C. Black B.L. Sumanas S. Vascular endothelial and endocardial progenitors differentiate as cardiomyocytes in the absence of Etsrp/Etv2 function.Development. 2011; 138: 4721-4732Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The signaling pathways that regulate these transcription factors within the developing endocardial lineage in the early embryo are not well defined. However, as these cells develop from a NKX2-5+ population (Stanley et al., 2002Stanley E.G. Biben C. Elefanty A. Barnett L. Koentgen F. Robb L. Harvey R.P. Efficient Cre-mediated deletion in cardiac progenitor cells conferred by a 3’UTR-ires-Cre allele of the homeobox gene Nkx2-5.Int. J. Dev. Biol. 2002; 46: 431-439PubMed Google Scholar), pathways that play a role in the specification of these progenitors in vivo, including BMP, FGF, and Wnt, are likely candidates to function at some level in endocardial specification (Alsan and Schultheiss, 2002Alsan B.H. Schultheiss T.M. Regulation of avian cardiogenesis by Fgf8 signaling.Development. 2002; 129: 1935-1943PubMed Google Scholar; Barron et al., 2000Barron M. Gao M. Lough J.

Role of bone morphogenetic proteins in cardiac differentiation.Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Given the central role of the endocardial lineage in heart development, the ability to generate these endothelial cells from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) would provide an unlimited source of cells for studying their developmental origin, for engineering cardiac tissues for disease modeling and drug screening, and for generating coronary endothelial cells and biological valves for therapeutic applications. Several previous studies have shown that it is possible to generate hPSC-derived endothelial cells that express some markers of the endocardial lineage (Bao et al., 2017Bao X. Bhute V.J. Han T.

One report also demonstrated that the population was able to undergo EndoMT and give rise to mesenchymal derivatives in vitro (Neri et al., 2019Neri T. Hiriart E. van Vliet P.P. Faure E. Norris R.A. Farhat B. Jagla B. Lefrancois J. Sugi Y. Moore-Morris T. et al.Human pre-valvular endocardial cells derived from pluripotent stem cells recapitulate cardiac pathophysiological valvulogenesis.Nat. Commun. 2019; 10: 1929Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). While these findings are encouraging, none of the studies showed expression of the key endocardial marker NKX2-5 in the population and none evaluated full functional potential of the cells. In this study, we used a NKX2-5:GFP reporter hPSC cell line (Elliott et al., 2011Elliott D.A. Braam S.R. Koutsis K. Ng E.S. Jenny R. Lagerqvist E.L. Biben C. Hatzistavrou T. Hirst C.E. Yu Q.C. et al.NKX2-5(eGFP/w) hESCs for isolation of human cardiac progenitors and cardiomyocytes.Nat. Methods. 2011; 8: 1037-1040Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) to identify and characterize the regulatory pathways that promote the development of a NKX2-5+CD31+ endocardial-like population. We show that BMP10 signaling plays a pivotal role in the generation of a population that expresses the collection of markers that define the endocardial lineage in vivo and one that shows a high level of transcriptional similarity to primary human fetal endocardium. These hPSC-derived NKX2-5+CD31+ endocardial-like cells display the capacity to induce a trabecular fate following co-culture with target cardiomyocytes, as well as an ability to undergo EndoMT to give rise to mesenchymal cells that express markers of the VIC lineage. As previous studies have shown that both FGF and BMP signaling are involved in the specification of NKX2-5+ cardiac progenitors in vivo (Alsan and Schultheiss, 2002Alsan B.H. Schultheiss T.M. Regulation of avian cardiogenesis by Fgf8 signaling.Development. 2002; 129: 1935-1943PubMed Google Scholar; Barron et al., 2000Barron M. Gao M. Lough J. Requirement for BMP and FGF signaling during cardiogenic induction in non-precardiac mesoderm is specific, transient, and cooperative.Dev. Dyn. 2000; 218: 383-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), we used a transgenic HES3-NKX2-5eGFP/w reporter line to evaluate the role of these pathways in the generation of a NKX2-5+CD31+ population, that we propose represents the earliest stage of human endocardial development. We used either BMP4 or BMP10 as both are expressed in the early cardiomyocytes that develop adjacent to the endocardial cells (Neuhaus et al., 1999Neuhaus H. Rosen V. Thies R.S.

Role of bone morphogenetic proteins in cardiac differentiation.Cardiovasc. Res. 2007; 74: 244-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). These pathways were manipulated in cardiogenic mesoderm induced with the concentrations of activin and BMP4 (6 ng/mL Activin A, 10 ng/mL BMP4) used in our previous studies (Lee et al., 2017Lee J.H. Protze S.I. Laksman Z. Backx P.H. Keller G.M. Human Pluripotent Stem Cell-Derived Atrial and Ventricular Cardiomyocytes Develop from Distinct Mesoderm Populations.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 21: 179-194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) to generate ventricular cardiomyocytes (Figure 1A). We first evaluated the effects of varying concentrations of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in the presence of BMP4 (10 ng/mL) or BMP10 (10 ng/mL) added in the following time intervals: days 3–9, 5–9, or 7–9. At day 9, the populations were harvested and analyzed for the presence of NKX2-5+ and CD31+ cells. None of the populations induced with BMP4 or BMP10 alone in the absence of bFGF contained CD31+ cells indicating that exogenous FGF signaling is required for endothelial development under these conditions (Figure 1B). bFGF alone did not induce large NKX2-5+CD31+ populations, regardless of the concentration used. When paired with exogenous FGF signaling, the addition of either BMP4 or BMP10 significantly increased the proportion of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells generated. The addition of BMP from days 5–9 induced a higher proportion of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells than the extended addition of agonist from days 3 to 9 (Figures 1C and 1D). Within the day 5–9 time frame, the highest frequency of these cells was generated by the combination of BMP10 and 50 or 100 ng/mL of bFGF (Figure 1C). Addition of BMP from days 7–9 promoted the development of comparable frequencies of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells but did induce larger NKX2-5–CD31+ subpopulations in the BMP10/FGF50- and BMP10/FGF100-treated groups (Figure 1E). Based on these observations and on the number of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells generated (Figure 1F), we chose to use 50 ng/mL of bFGF together with BMP10 added from days 5–9 for the following experiments. We next determined the optimal amount of BMP required for specification of the NKX2-5+CD31+ population and found that 10 ng/mL of BMP10 added together with 50 ng/mL of bFGF generated the highest frequency and number of these cells (Figures 1G–1I). The above studies were carried out with a modified cardiomyocyte protocol, which normally includes a WNT inhibition step between days 3 and 5. To investigate the role of Wnt signaling in the generation of the NKX2-5+CD31+ population, we either activated the pathway with the GSK-3 inhibitor CHIR99021 or inhibited it by the addition of IWP2 for 2, 4, or 6 days, beginning at day 3 of differentiation (Figures S1A–S1E). Inhibition of WNT during each of these different time intervals resulted in a significant reduction in the frequency and number of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells generated. The addition of CHIR did not impact the total number of NKX2-5+CD31+ produced in the cultures, but addition for 6 days led to a decrease in their frequency. Together, these findings indicate that WNT signaling is required for the formation of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells and that the amount produced endogenously by the differentiating cells is sufficient for their development. Next, we investigated the role of exogenous VEGF/KDR signaling in the generation of the NKX2-5+CD31+ population as the day 3 mesoderm and derivative cells express low levels of KDR (data not shown). Addition of different concentrations of VEGF during the time intervals outlined in Figure S1F did not increase the number of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells generated (Figures S1G and S1J). Rather, when added for the 3–9 day window, the highest concentration of agonist led to a significant decrease in the total number of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells produced and a corresponding increase in the number of NKX2-5–CD31+ cells (Figures S1G–S1J). Given these observations, VEGF was not included in the protocol for the generation of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells for the studies described below. Kinetic analyses using the above optimized culture conditions revealed that, following either BMP4 or BMP10 specification, NKX2-5+CD31+ cells emerged at day 8 of culture and persisted to day 12 (Figure 2B). Although the frequency of NKX2-5+CD31+ cells that developed did not differ between the two groups at day 8, the total number of these cells generated at days 8 and 9 in the BMP10-induced populations was significantly higher than in the BMP4-treated populations (Figure 2E). Exploiting the above observation that high concentrations of VEGF promotes the development of a NKX2-5–CD31+ population, we treated the cells with VEGF and bFGF without BMP, in an effort to generate NKX2-5–CD31+ non-endocardial endothelial cells. As shown in Figure 2B, the addition of VEGF/bFGF from days 3–9 induced a NKX2-5–CD31+ population that could be detected as early as day 6 and persisted to day 12 of differentiation. As expression of NKX2-5 was not upregulated at any stage under these conditions, we reasoned that these cells should represent non-endocardial endothelial cells and used them as “control” cells in the following studies. Given the findings from these kinetic analyses and the fact that the protocol was optimized in the previous experiments for a day 9 population, we chose to isolate the NKX2-5+CD31+ cells from day 9 cultures for the following studies. To further characterize the NKX2-5+ and CD31+ populations, they were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and analyzed for the expression of genes known to distinguish endocardial cells from other endothelial cells including neuregulin, the transcription factors GATA4, GATA5, and NFATC1, and the atrial natriuretic peptide receptor NPR3 (Charron and Nemer, 1999Charron F.

As shown in Figure 3B, the NKX2-5+CD31+ cells expressed significantly higher levels of all of the genes defining the endocardial lineage compared to the control endothelial population. The levels of expression of NFATC1, NRG1, GATA4, and GATA5 were similar in the NKX2-5+CD31+ and the NKX2-5–CD31+ populations, whereas the levels of NPR3 were significantly higher in the NKX2-5+CD31+cells. These findings suggest that both populations contain endocardial-like cells. The differences in NPR3 expression may reflect differences in the stage of maturation. The NKX2-5+CD31– cells expressed higher levels of the progenitor markers, NKX2-5, ETV2, and ISL1 than the NKX2-5+CD31+ and NKX2-5–CD31+ cells suggesting that this population contains the endocardial progenitors. Taken together, the findings from these molecular analyses are consistent with the interpretation that the BMP10-induced NKX2-5+CD31+ and NKX2-5–CD31+ populations represent the human endocardial lineage. To determine whether the method of induction impacted the molecular profile of the NKX2-5+CD31+ population, we compared the expression patterns in cells induced with either BMP4 or BMP10. Although the levels of GATA4, GATA5, and NFATC1 expression were similar in both, the BMP10-induced population expressed higher levels of NRG1 than the cells induced with BMP4 (Figure 3C). Collectively, the findings from the above comparative studies demonstrate that BMP10 is more effective than BMP4 at specifying the NKX2-5+CD31+ cell fate from cardiogenic mesoderm. To further investigate differences between these pathway agonists, we cultured BMP10-induced NKX2-5+CD31+ cells in the presence of different concentrations of either BMP4 or BMP10 for 8 days. VEGF was added to maintain the endothelial phenotype of the cells during this culture period. Analyses of the cultured populations revealed that BMP10 was more effective than BMP4 in maintaining the NKX2-5+CD31+ cell phenotype at all concentrations of agonist tested (Figure 3D). The cells cultured in BMP10 also sustained higher levels of NRG1 than those maintained in BMP4 (Figure 3E). Together, these findings demonstrate that BMP10 signaling is essential for maintaining endocardial-like cells in culture. Notably, the addition of BMP10 to the control endothelial population during this culture period did not lead to the upregulation of NRG1 expression indicating that this agonist does not directly upregulate NRG1 in non-endocardial endothelial cells. Immunostaining analysis of the BMP10-induced NKX2-5+CD31+ endocardial-like cells showed that they expressed NKX2-5 and GATA4 protein, consistent with the qRT-PCR expression profiles (Figures S2A and S2B). The control endothelial cells, by contrast, showed no expression. NFATC1 was detected in the nuclei of both the NKX2-5+CD31+ endocardial-like and control endothelial cells, indicating that this marker alone does not distinguish these populations (Figure S2C). If the NKX2-5+CD31+ cells represent the equivalent of endocardium, they should be able to induce a trabecular fate in target cardiomyocytes (Del Monte-Nieto et al., 2018Del Monte-Nieto G.

The CoW exhibits considerable anatomical variations which may have clinical importance, but the variability is insufficiently characterised in the general population. We assessed the anatomical variability of CoW variants in a community-dwelling sample (N = 1,864, 874 men, mean age = 65.4, range 40–87 years), and independent and conditional frequencies of the CoW’s artery segments. CoW segments were classified as present or missing/hypoplastic (w/1mm diameter threshold) on 3T time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiography images. We also examined whether age and sex were associated with CoW variants. We identified 47 unique CoW variants, of which five variants constituted 68.5% of the sample. The complete variant was found in 11.9% of the subjects, and the most common variant (27.8%) was missing both posterior communicating arteries. Conditional frequencies showed patterns of interdependence across most missing segments in the CoW. CoW variants were associated with mean-split age (P = .0147), and there was a trend showing more missing segments with increasing age. We found no association with sex (P = .0526). Our population study demonstrated age as associated with CoW variants, suggesting reduced collateral capacity with older age."

Limited by medical resources shortage and uneven facilities distribution, online help-seeking becomes an essential approach to cope with public health emergencies for many ordinaries. This study explores the driving forces behind the retransmission of online help-seeking posts. We built an analytical framework that emphasized content characteristics, including information completeness, proximity, support seeking type, disease severity, and emotion of help-seeking messages. A quantitative content analysis was conducted with a probability sample consisting of 727 posts. The results illustrate the importance of individual information completeness, high proximity, instrumental support seeking. This study also demonstrates slight inconformity with the severity principle but stresses the power of anger in help-seeking messages dissemination. As one of the first online help-seeking diffusion analyses in the COVID-19 period, our research provides a reference for constructing compelling and effective help-seeking posts during a particular period. It also reveals further possibilities for harnessing social media’s power to promote reciprocal and cooperative actions as a response to this deepening global concern."
https://openalex.org/W3021110394,"State government-mandated social distancing measures have helped to slow the growth of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Many of the current predictive models of the development of COVID-19, especially after mitigation efforts, partially rely on extrapolations from data collected in other countries. Since most states enacted stay-at-home orders towards the end of March, the resulting effects of social distancing should be reflected in the death and infection counts by the end of April. Using the data available through April 25th, we investigate the change in the infection rate due to the mitigation efforts and project death and infection counts through September 2020 for some of the most heavily impacted states: New York, New Jersey, Michigan, Massachusetts, Illinois, and Louisiana. We find that with the current mitigation efforts, five of those six states have reduced their base reproduction number to a value less than one, stopping the exponential growth of the pandemic. We also project different scenarios after the mitigation is relaxed."
https://openalex.org/W3097754497,"Poly(ADP-ribose) Polymerase 2 (PARP2) is one of three DNA-dependent PARPs involved in the detection of DNA damage. Upon binding to DNA double-strand breaks, PARP2 uses nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide to synthesize poly(ADP-ribose) (PAR) onto itself and other proteins, including histones. PAR chains in turn promote the DNA damage response by recruiting downstream repair factors. These early steps of DNA damage signaling are relevant for understanding how genome integrity is maintained and how their failure leads to genome instability or cancer. There is no structural information on DNA double-strand break detection in the context of chromatin. Here we present a cryo-EM structure of two nucleosomes bridged by human PARP2 and confirm that PARP2 bridges DNA ends in the context of nucleosomes bearing short linker DNA. We demonstrate that the conformation of PARP2 bound to damaged chromatin provides a binding platform for the regulatory protein Histone PARylation Factor 1 (HPF1), and that the resulting HPF1•PARP2•nucleosome complex is enzymatically active. Our results contribute to a structural view of the early steps of the DNA damage response in chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W3138615294,"Plant species of the Poaceae family are not only used as fodder and forage but also contribute substantially to the treatment of various health disorders, particularly in livestock. Consequently, the present study was aimed to document the therapeutic uses of Poaceae practiced by the inhabitants of the Punjab Province for the treatment of various veterinary health disorders. Semi structured interviews, group discussion and field walks were conducted to collect the data. Quantitative indices including cultural significance index (CSI), relative frequency of citations (RFC), fidelity level (FL), relative popularity level (RPL), and Jaccard Index (JI) were used for the data analysis. Traditional uses of 149 species belonging to 60 genera and 16 tribes of 5 sub families of Poaceae were recorded. Whole plants and leaves were the most consistently used parts with 40.94 and 29.53%. The plants were mainly given orally as fodder (59 reports) without processing followed by decoction (35 reports). Most of the species were employed to treat infectious diseases (25.93%), and digestive disorders (14.10%). Triticum aestivum had the highest CSI, RFC and RPL levels at 8.00, 0.96, 1.00, respectively, followed by Oryza sativa and Poa annua. Likewise, T. aestivum and Saccharum spontaneum had 100% FL and ROP. Jaccard index ranged from 12.25 to 0.37. Twelve plant species namely Chrysopogon zizanioides (anti-inflammatory), Pennisetum lanatum (improve bull fertility), Cymbopogon citratus (glandular secretion), Sorghum saccharatum and Themeda triandra (malaria), Aristida funiculate (anticancer), Koeleria argentia (skin allergies), Tetrapogon villosus (antibacterial), Cynodon radiatus (eyes infection), Sporobolus nervosa (Jaundice), Enneapogon persicus (antifungal), and Panicum repens (dysfunctional cattle organs) were reported for the first time, with novel ethnoveterinary uses. The inhabitants of the study area had a strong association with their surrounding plant diversity and possessed significant knowledge on therapeutic uses of Poaceae to treat various health disorders in animals. Plant species with maximum cultural and medicinal values could be a potential source of novel drugs to cure health disorders in animals and human as well."
https://openalex.org/W3096200616,"During the last decade, a number of pain assessment tools based on facial expressions have been developed for horses. While all tools focus on moveable facial muscles related to the ears, eyes, nostrils, lips, and chin, results are difficult to compare due to differences in the research conditions, descriptions and methodologies. We used a Facial Action Coding System (FACS) modified for horses (EquiFACS) to code and analyse video recordings of acute short-term experimental pain (n = 6) and clinical cases expected to be in pain or without pain (n = 21). Statistical methods for analyses were a frequency based method adapted from human FACS approaches, and a novel method based on co-occurrence of facial actions in time slots of varying lengths. We describe for the first time changes in facial expressions using EquiFACS in video of horses with pain. The ear rotator (EAD104), nostril dilation (AD38) and lower face behaviours, particularly chin raiser (AU17), were found to be important pain indicators. The inner brow raiser (AU101) and eye white increase (AD1) had less consistent results across experimental and clinical data. Frequency statistics identified AUs, EADs and ADs that corresponded well to anatomical regions and facial expressions identified by previous horse pain research. The co-occurrence based method additionally identified lower face behaviors that were pain specific, but not frequent, and showed better generalization between experimental and clinical data. In particular, chewing (AD81) was found to be indicative of pain. Lastly, we identified increased frequency of half blink (AU47) as a new indicator of pain in the horses of this study."
https://openalex.org/W3096701338,"Sub-Saharan Africa is experiencing rapid urban growth. Cities enable greater access to health services and improved water and sanitation infrastructure, leading to some improvements in health. However, urban settings may also be associated with more sedentary, stressful lifestyles and consumption of less nutritious food. C-reactive protein (CRP) is a measure of chronic inflammation predictive of cardiovascular disease, and high body mass index (BMI), a ratio of weight to height, indicates overweight or obesity and is associated with an increased risk of many chronic diseases. To explore the association between urbanicity and these two markers, we overlaid data from the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) with a satellite-derived measure of built environment. Linear regression models were constructed for the outcomes of BMI and CRP, by 1) administratively defined urban/rural categorization from the DHS, 2) satellite derived built environment, and 3) built environment stratified by urban/rural. A total of 2,212 women were included; 23% had elevated CRP, 21% were overweight or obese. A third (33%) lived in a highly built up area and 29% lived in an area classified as urban. A strong positive association between both CRP and BMI and built environment was detected; log CRP increased 0.43 in the highest built up areas compared to not built up (p<0.05); log BMI increased 0.02 in the most built up areas compared to not built up (p<0.05). However, comparing urban to rural category was only significant in unadjusted models. Models stratified by urban/rural category highlight that the variation in CRP and BMI by built environment is mainly driven by rural areas; within urban areas there is less variation. Our findings highlight the potential negative effects of urbanicity on chronic disease markers, with potentially more change detected for those transitioning from rural to urban lifestyles. Satellite-derived urbanicity measures are reproducible and provide more nuanced understanding of effects of built environment on health."
https://openalex.org/W3096261089,"This study examines the influence of intermittent exposure to cold, hypobaric hypoxia, and their combination, in gut microbiota and their metabolites in vivo, and explores their effects on the physiology of the host. Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to cold (4°C), hypobaric hypoxia (462 torr), or both simultaneously, 4 h/day for 21 days. Biometrical and hematological parameters were monitored. Gut bacterial subgroups were evaluated by qPCR and short-chain fatty acids were determined by gas chromatography in caecum and feces. Cold increased brown adipose tissue, Clostridiales subpopulation and the concentration of butyric and isovaleric acids in caecum. Hypobaric hypoxia increased hemoglobin, red and white cell counts and Enterobacteriales, and reduced body and adipose tissues weights and Lactobacilliales. Cold plus hypobaric hypoxia counteracted the hypoxia-induced weight loss as well as the increase in white blood cells, while reducing the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio and normalizing the populations of Enterobacteriales and Lactobacilliales. In conclusion, intermittent cold and hypobaric hypoxia exposures by themselves modified some of the main physiological variables in vivo, while their combination kept the rats nearer to their basal status. The reduction of the Bacteroidetes:Firmicutes ratio and balanced populations of Enterobacteriales and Lactobacilliales in the gut may contribute to this effect."
https://openalex.org/W3096080740,"Background Pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators are released during and after cardiac arrest, which may be unfavourable. Small case-series and observational studies suggested that unselective hemoadsorption may reduce inadequately high cytokine levels during sepsis or cardiac surgery. We aimed to assess the effect of cytokine adsorbtion on mortality in patients following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest by comparing a patient cohort with hemoadsorption after resuscitation for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest to a control cohort without adsorption within the HAnnover COling REgistry (HACORE). Methods We adopted an early routine use of hemoadsorption in patients after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest with increased vasopressor need and performed a 1:2 match according to age, gender, time to return of spontaneous circulation, initial left-ventricular ejection fraction, extracorporeal membrane-oxygenation or left-ventricular unloading by Impella, need for renal replacement therapy, admission lactate, pH, glomerular filtration rate to patients without an adsorber from HACORE. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality. Results Twenty-four patients receiving hemoadsorption were matched to 48 patients without hemoadsorption (mean age 62±13 years, 83% male). While there was no significant difference in baseline parameters, 30-day mortality was higher in patients treated with hemoadsorption than in the matched control group (83% vs 65%, Log rank p = 0.011). Conclusions Routine use of hemoadsorption did not reduce, but seems to be associated with higher 30-day mortality in patients after OHCA. Prior to routine adoption in daily practice, hemoadsorption should be evaluated in properly sized randomized controlled trials."
https://openalex.org/W3097640455,"Introduction Contraception plays a significant role in fertility regulation and determines the reproductive health rights of women. Studies in other parts of the world have found that sexual violence has negative effects on unmet need for contraception. There has not been any study on the association between these two phenomena in sub-Saharan Africa using current nationally-representative survey data. We investigated the association between sexual violence and unmet need for contraception among married and cohabiting women in sub-Saharan Africa. Materials and methods This study was based on secondary datasets from 26 sub-Saharan African countries’ Demographic and Health Surveys conducted between 2010 and 2018. A sample of 101,968 women in sexual unions (married and cohabiting) with complete information on sexual violence and all the variables of interest were included in the analyses. Both bivariate and multilevel logistic regression analyses were carried out to examine the association between sexual violence and unmet need for contraception. Other individual and contextual level socio-economic and demographic variables were considered as covariates. Crude odds ratios [cOR] and adjusted odds ratios [aOR] with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals [CI], signifying precision, were presented. Level of statistical significance was declared at p<0.05. Results The overall prevalence of sexual violence and unmet need for contraception in the 26 sub-Saharan African countries were 8.7% and 28.7% respectively. Experience of sexual violence within the last 12 months resulted in 10% increase in unmet need for contraception [OR = 1.10, CI = 1.03–1.14] and 5% increase in unmet need for contraception after controlling for individual and contextual level factors [aOR = 1.05, CI = 1.01–1.11]. With the individual level factors, women with 4 or more births [aOR = 4.85, CI = 4.41–5.33], those cohabiting [aOR = 1.43, CI = 1.37–1.47], those in female headed households [aOR = 1.22, CI = 1.18–1.27] and those who watched television at least once a week [aOR = 1.12, CI = 1.07–1.16] had higher odds of unmet need for family planning. However, those aged 30–34 [aOR = 0.56, CI = 0.52–0.61], those with secondary/higher level of education [AOR = 0.80, CI = 0.77–0.84], those who read newspaper less than once a week [aOR = 0.75, CI = 0.71–0.79] and those who listened to radio at least once a week [aOR = 0.94, CI = 0.90–0.97] had lower odds of unmet need for contraception. In terms of the contextual factors, women in rural areas [aOR = 0.87, CI = 0.84–0.91] and those in the richest wealth quintile households [aOR = 0.80, CI = 0.75–0.85] had lower odds of unmet need for contraception. Conclusion Our study has shown an association between sexual violence and unmet need for contraception in sub-Saharan Africa. Experiencing sexual violence increases the likelihood of unmet need for contraception in sub-Saharan Africa. It is also worthy to note that having four or more children, cohabiting with a male partner, and living in female-headed households are some of the key variables associated with unmet need for contraception in sub-Saharan Africa. Our study recommends that, successful contraceptive initiatives should focus on reducing sexual violence, while taking into consideration other significant factors that increase unmet need for contraception. Meanwhile, in doing this, contextual factors ought to be prioritised."

The degree to which cats manifest beneficial changes in response to RS intake was examined. Healthy cats (N = 36) were fed identically formulated foods processed under high (n = 17) or low (n = 19) shear extrusion conditions (low and high RS levels [LRS and HRS], respectively). Fecal samples collected after 3 and 6 weeks' feeding were assayed for stool firmness score, short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and changes to the global metabolome and microbiome; fecal immunoglobulin A (IgA) was analyzed at week 6. Few differences were seen in proximate analyses of the foods; stool firmness scores did not differ. In cats consuming HRS food, concentrations of fecal butyrate and the straight chain:branched chain fatty acid ratio were significantly greater in feces at both weeks 3 and 6, while fecal ammonia was reduced at week 6 relative to feces from LRS-fed cats. Fecal IgA concentrations were significantly higher at week 6 with HRS food. RS consumption altered 47% of the fecal metabolome; RS-derived sugars and metabolites associated with greater gut health, including indoles and polyamines, increased in the cats consuming HRS food relative to those fed the LS food, while endocannabinoid N-acylethanolamines decreased. Consumption of HRS food increased concentrations of the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate in feces and elevated concentrations of reduced members of NADH-coupled redox congeners and NADH precursors. At the microbiome genus-level, 21% of operational taxonomic units were significantly different between food types; many involved taxa with known saccharolytic or proteolytic proclivities. Microbiome taxa richness and Shannon and Simpson alpha diversity were significantly higher in the HRS group at both weeks. These data show that feline consumption of grain-derived RS produces potentially beneficial shifts in microbiota-mediated metabolism and increases IgA production."
https://openalex.org/W3096219925,"A phase 3 randomized double blind controlled, trial in 238 people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and at least one nonsense mutation (nmCF) investigated the effect of ataluren on FEV1. The study was of 48 weeks duration and failed to meet its primary endpoint. Unexpectedly, while FEV1 declined, chest computed tomography (CT) scores using the Brody-II score as secondary outcome measures did not show progression in the placebo group. Based on this observation it was concluded that the role of CT scans in CF randomized clinical trials was limited. However, more sensitive scoring systems were developed over the last decade warranting a reanalysis of this unique dataset. The aim of our study was to reanalyse all chest CT scans, obtained in the ataluren phase 3 study, using 2 independent scoring systems to characterize structural lung disease in this cohort and to compare progression of structural lung disease over the 48 weeks between treatment arms. 391 study CT scans from 210 patients were reanalysed in random order by 2 independent observers using the CF-CT and Perth-Rotterdam Annotated Grid Morphometric Analysis for CF (PRAGMA-CF) scoring systems. CF-CT and PRAGMA-CF subscores were expressed as %maximal score and %total lung volume, respectively. PRAGMA-CF subscores %Disease (p = 0.008) and %Mucus Plugging (p = 0.029) progressed over 48 weeks. CF-CT subscores did not show progression. There was no difference in progression of structural lung disease between treatment arm and placebo independent of tobramycin use. PRAGMA-CF Chest CT scores can be used as an outcome measure to study the effect of potential disease modifying drugs in CF on lung structure."

The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used to compare groups and a Spearman correlation used with p<0.05 for significance.Eighty patients with positive RT-PCR were analysed. The mean age was 55 years ± 16, with 42 males (53%). The most frequent symptoms were fever (60/80, 75%) and cough (59/80, 74%), the mean NEWS was 1.7±2.3. All LDCT could be analysed and 23/80 (28%) were normal. The major imaging finding was GGOs in 56 cases (67%). The COVID19-LDCT score (mean value = 19±29) was correlated with NEWS (r = 0.48, p<0.0001). No symptoms were risk factor to have pulmonary involvement. Univariate analysis shown that dyspnea, high respiratory rate, hypertension and diabetes are associated to a COVID19-LDCT score superior to 50.COVID19-LDCT score did correlate with NEWS. It was significantly different in the clinical low-risk and high-risk groups. Further work is needed to validate the COVID19-LDCT score against patient prognosis."
https://openalex.org/W3096455457,"Biophoton emission is a well-known phenomenon in living organisms, including plant species; however, the underlying mechanisms are not yet well elucidated. Nevertheless, non-invasive stress detection is of high importance when in plant production and plant research. Therefore, the aim of our work was to investigate, whether biophoton emission is suitable for the detection of cadmium stress in the early phase of stress evolution and to identify certain stress-related events that occur rapidly upon cadmium exposure of barley seedlings parallel to biophoton emission measurements. Changes of biophoton emission, chlorophyll content estimation index, ascorbate level, the activity of ascorbate- and guaiacol peroxidase enzymes and lipid oxidation were measured during seven days of cadmium treatment in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings. The results indicate that the antioxidant enzyme system responded the most rapidly to the stress caused by cadmium and the lipid oxidation-related emission of photons was detected in cadmium-treated samples as early as one day after cadmium exposure. Furthermore, a concentration-dependent increase in biophoton emission signals indicating an increased rate of antioxidative enzymes and lipid oxidation was also possible to determine. Our work shows evidence that biophoton emission is suitable to identify the initial phase of cadmium stress effectively and non-invasively."
https://openalex.org/W3094892085,"Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in our society and economy and is already having an impact on our daily life in many different ways. From several perspectives, machine learning is seen as the new engine of productivity and economic growth. It can increase the business efficiency and improve any decision-making process, and of course, spawn the creation of new products and services by using complex machine learning algorithms. In this scenario, the lack of actionable accountability-related guidance is potentially the single most important challenge facing the machine learning community. Machine learning systems are often composed of many parts and ingredients, mixing third party components or software-as-a-service APIs, among others. In this paper we study the role of copies for risk mitigation in such machine learning systems. Formally, a copy can be regarded as an approximated projection operator of a model into a target model hypothesis set. Under the conceptual framework of actionable accountability, we explore the use of copies as a viable alternative in circumstances where models cannot be re-trained, nor enhanced by means of a wrapper. We use a real residential mortgage default dataset as a use case to illustrate the feasibility of this approach."
https://openalex.org/W3095392271,"Silver diamine fluoride (SDF) is commonly used to arrest caries lesions, especially in early childhood caries. Recently, it was suggested that SDF can be combined with potassium iodide (KI) to minimize the discoloration of demineralized dentine associated with SDF application. However, the antibacterial efficacy of SDF alone or combined with KI on in-situ biofilm is unknown. Hence, we compared the anti-plaque biofilm efficacy of two different commercially available SDF solutions, with or without KI, using an in-situ biofilm, analysed using viability real-time PCR with propidium monoazide (PMA). Appliance-borne in-situ biofilm samples (n = 90) were grown for a period of 6 h in five healthy subjects who repeated the experiment on three separate occasions, using a validated, novel, intraoral device. The relative anti-biofilm efficacy of two SDF formulations; 38.0% Topamine (SDFT) and 31.3%, Riva Star (SDFR), KI alone, and KI in combination with SDFR (SDFR+KI) was compared. The experiments were performed by applying an optimized volume of the agents onto the biofilm for 1min, mimicking the standard clinical procedure. Afterwards the viability of the residual biofilm bacteria was quantified using viability real-time PCR with PMA, then the percentage of viable from total bacteria was calculated. Both SDF formulations (SDFT and SDFR) exhibited potent antibacterial activities against the in-situ biofilm; however, there was non-significant difference in their efficacy. KI alone did not demonstrate any antibacterial effect, and there was non-significant difference in the antibacterial efficacy of SDF alone compared to SDF with KI, (SDFT v SDFR/KI). Thus, we conclude that the antibacterial efficacy of SDF against plaque biofilms is not modulated by KI supplements. Viability real-time PCR with PMA was successfully used to analyze the viability of naturally grown oral biofilm; thus, the same method can be used to test the antimicrobial effect of other agents on oral biofilms in future research."
https://openalex.org/W3096711841,"Glaucoma filtration surgery is one of the most effective methods for lowering intraocular pressure in glaucoma. The surgery efficiently reduces intra-ocular pressure but the most common cause of failure is scarring at the incision site. This occurs in the conjunctiva/Tenon’s capsule layer overlying the scleral coat of the eye. Currently used antimetabolite treatments to prevent post-surgical scarring are non-selective and are associated with potentially blinding side effects. Developing new treatments to target scarring requires both a better understanding of wound healing and scarring in the conjunctiva, and new means of delivering anti-scarring drugs locally and sustainably. By combining plastic compression of collagen gels with a soft collagen-based layer, we have developed a physiologically relevant model of the sub-epithelial bulbar conjunctiva/Tenon’s capsule interface, which allows a more holistic approach to the understanding of subconjunctival tissue behaviour and local drug delivery. The biomimetic tissue hosts both primary human conjunctival fibroblasts and an immune component in the form of macrophages, morphologically and structurally mimicking the mechanical proprieties and contraction kinetics of ex vivo porcine conjunctiva. We show that our model is suitable for the screening of drugs targeting scarring and/or inflammation, and amenable to the study of local drug delivery devices that can be inserted in between the two layers of the biomimetic. We propose that this multicellular-bilayer engineered tissue will be useful to study complex biological aspects of scarring and fibrosis, including the role of inflammation, with potentially significant implications for the management of scarring following glaucoma filtration surgery and other anterior ocular segment scarring conditions. Crucially, it uniquely allows the evaluation of new means of local drug delivery within a physiologically relevant tissue mimetic, mimicking intraoperative drug delivery in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W3095084877,"Around the world, cervical cancer is one of the most common neoplastic diseases among women, and the prognosis of patients in an advanced stage remains poor. To reduce the mortality rate of cervical cancer, early diagnosis and treatment are essential. DNA methylation is an important aspect of gene regulation, and aberrant DNA methylation contributes to carcinogenesis and cancer progression in various cancers. Although 5-methylcytosine (5mC) has been analyzed intensively, the function of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) has not been clarified. The purpose of our study was to identify the molecular biomarkers for early diagnosis of cervical tumors due to epigenetic alterations. To assess the clinical relevance of DNA methylation, we used immunohistochemistry (IHC) to characterize the level of 5hmC in 102 archived human cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) samples and cervical cancer specimens. The level of 5hmC was significantly decreased between CIN2 and CIN3. The progression of cervical tumors is caused by a reduction of TP53 and RB1 because of HPV infection. We observed that Tp53 and Rb1 were knocked down in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), a model of normal cells. The level of 5hmC was reduced in Tp53-knockdown cells, and the expression levels of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase 1 (TET1) were induced. In contrast, there was no significant change in Rb1-knockdown cells. Mechanistically, we focused on apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme, catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) 3B (A3B) as a cause of 5hmC reduction after TP53 knockdown. In the human cell line HHUA with a wild-type TP53 gene, A3B was induced in TP53-knockdown cells, and A3B knockdown recovered 5hmC levels in TP53-knockdown cells. These data indicate that TP53 suppression leads to 5hmC reduction in part through A3B induction. Moreover, IHC showed that expression levels of A3B in CIN3 were significantly higher than those in both normal epithelium and in CIN2. In conclusion, 5hmC levels are decreased between CIN2 and CIN3 through the TP53-A3B pathway. Since A3B could impair genome stability, 5hmC loss might increase the chances of accumulating mutations and of progressing from CIN3 to cervical cancer. Thus, these epigenetic changes could predict whether CINs are progressing to cancer or disappearing."
https://openalex.org/W3096183064,"Objective To develop a scale for evaluating knowledge and practice of midwives on Respectful Maternity Care (RMC). Methods An exploratory sequential mixed method study was conducted from January 2018 to July 2019 in two non-teaching public hospitals in Tehran, Iran. In the first part of the study, a literature review and qualitative study were carried out in order to develop the preliminary item pool. Then face, content and construct validity and reliability (internal consistency and test-retest) were assessed. Results The MKP-RMC scale has 23-item in knowledge and 23-item in practice section that loaded in three factors: Giving emotional support, providing safe care and preventing mistreatment. Exploratory factor analysis accounted for 43.47% and 58.62% of observed variance in knowledge and practice sections, respectively. The internal consistency and internal correlation coefficient of both section of MKP-RMC indicated acceptable reliability. Conclusion The MKP-RMC is a valid and reliable tool for measuring midwives' knowledge and practice of respectful care during labor and childbirth. The MKP-RMC could be used in maternity services to evaluate and improve quality of childbirth care through development of educational interventions for effective behavioral change. Confirmation of validity and reliability of translated version of the scale in other maternity care providers and different contexts is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W3095421108,"Intimate partner violence is the most common type of violence against women. Attitudes towards this violence are increasingly recognized as key to understanding this social and public health problem because a social environment that accepts or even supports it creates a climate that breeds further violence and encourages their perpetration. The evidence available shows that these attitudes are influenced by different individual, organizational and community factors, and that the supportive attitudes are generally more common among males, and among older and less educated people. This paper presents two cross-sectional studies which aim to obtain a deeper understanding of supportive attitudes towards intimate partner violence against women in a Spanish-speakers context. Results obtained show that the two questionnaires used may be useful for evaluating supporting attitudes towards this violence in Spanish-speaking samples. Thus, the Inventory of Distorted Thoughts about Women and Violence (IPDMV), one of the one of the most widely used tools to this aim among Spanish-speakers, includes information regarding the minimization of this violence and the responsibility of perpetrators, and it seems better able to capture the effect of previous training, which would be consistent with the fact that it was initially designed to detect the effects of interventions; and the Inventory of Beliefs about Intimate Partner Violence (IBIPV), a new tool recently designed to this aim, is more focused on supportive attitudes and seems more effective for capturing differences between men and women in blaming victims and exonerating perpetrators. Additionally, the results obtained allow us to complement previous studies on the effects that factors such as gender, age, or previous training have on supportive attitudes towards intimate partner violence against women."
https://openalex.org/W3096004452,"In-person (face-to-face) data collection methods offer many advantages but can also be time-consuming and expensive, particularly in areas of difficult access. We take advantage of the increasing mobile phone penetration rate in rural areas to evaluate the feasibility of using cell phones to monitor the provision of key health and nutrition interventions linked to the first 1,000 days of life, a critical period of growth and development. We examine response rates to calendarized text messages (SMS) and phone calls sent to 1,542 households over a period of four months. These households have children under two years old and pregnant women and are located across randomly selected communities in Quiche, Guatemala. We find that the overall (valid) response rate to phone calls is over 5 times higher than to text messages (75.8% versus 14.4%). We also test whether simple SMS reminders improve the timely reception of health services but do not find any effects in this regard. Language, education, and age appear to be major barriers to respond to text messages as opposed to phone calls, and the rate of response is not correlated with a household's geographic location (accessibility). Moreover, response veracity is high, with an 84-91% match between household responses and administrative records. The costs per monitored intervention are around 1.12 US dollars using text messages and 85 cents making phone calls, with the costs per effective answer showing a starker contrast, at 7.76 and 1.12 US dollars, respectively. Our findings indicate that mobile phone calls can be an effective, low-cost tool to collect reliable information remotely and in real time. In the current context, where in-person contact with households is not possible due to the COVID-19 crisis, phone calls can be a valuable instrument for collecting information, monitoring development interventions, or implementing brief surveys."
https://openalex.org/W3096267147,"The DNA topoisomerase complement of Streptococcus pneumoniae is constituted by two type II enzymes (topoisomerase IV and gyrase), and a single type I enzyme (topoisomerase I). These enzymes maintain the DNA topology, which is essential for replication and transcription. While fluoroquinolones target the type II enzymes, seconeolitsine, a new antimicrobial agent, targets topoisomerase I. We compared for the first time the in vitro effect of inhibition of topoisomerase I by seconeolitsine and of the type II topoisomerases by the fluoroquinolones levofloxacin and moxifloxacin. We used three isogenic non-encapsulated strains and five non-vaccine serotypes isolates belonging to two circulating pneumococcal clones, ST638 (2 strains) and ST1569V (3 strains). Each group contained strains with diverse susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Minimal inhibitory concentrations, killing curves and postantibiotic effects were determined. Seconeolitsine demonstrated the fastest and highest bactericidal activity against planktonic bacteria and biofilms. When fluoroquinolone-susceptible planktonic bacteria were considered, seconeolitsine induced postantibiotic effects (1.00−1.87 h) similar than levofloxacin (1.00−2.22 h), but longer than moxifloxacin (0.39−1.71 h). The same effect was observed in sessile bacteria forming biofilms. Seconeolitsine induced postantibiotic effects (0.84−2.31 h) that were similar to those of levofloxacin (0.99−3.32 h) but longer than those of moxifloxacin (0.89−1.91 h). The greatest effect was observed in the viability and adherence of bacteria in the postantibiotic phase. Seconeolitsine greatly reduced the thickness of the biofilms formed in comparison with fluoroquinolones: 2.91 ± 0.43 μm (seconeolitsine), 7.18 ± 0.58 μm (levofloxacin), 17.08 ± 1.02 μm (moxifloxacin). When fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria were considered, postantibiotic effects induced by levofloxacin and moxifloxacin, but not by seconeolitsine, were shorter, decreasing up to 5-fold (levofloxacin) or 2-fold (moxifloxacin) in planktonic cells, and up to 1.7 (levofloxacin) or 1.4-fold (moxifloxacin) during biofilm formation. Therefore, topoisomerase I inhibitors could be an alternative for the treatment of pneumococcal diseases, including those caused by fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates."
https://openalex.org/W3095327941,"Export marketing strategy has become an exciting research topic in strategic management literature because of its momentous role in sustainable competitive advantage and performance of firms. However, it is not yet recognized what factors enable top management team in adaptation of the export marketing strategy. This research aims to unleash how the intangible skills; creativity, business experience and intellectual capital facilitate marketing managers in adaptation of the expert marketing strategy (product, price, promotion and distribution) that can spur sustainable competitive performance. We collected data from 293 SMEs and used structural equation modeling for testing the hypotheses. The results indicate that the intangible skills; creativity, experience and intellectual capital do not directly contribute to sustainable competitive performance. However, creativity has a significant influence on product, price, promotion and distribution strategy, experience has a significant influence on product, price and promotion strategy and intellectual capital is only a significant predictor of product strategy. In the dimensions of export marketing strategy, product, price and distribution significantly while promotion does not significantly contribute to sustainable competitive performance. Moreover, export marketing strategy adaptation fully mediates the relationship between creativity and sustainable competitive performance as well as between experience and sustainable competitive performance while it does not mediate the path between intellectual capital and sustainable competitive performance. The findings recommend SMEs to emphasize highly skilled marketing staff who have competencies (experience, creative and intellectual) in order to build an effective export marketing strategy—resulting sustainable competitive performance. Further implications are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W3096580810,"Identification of individuals at risk for heart failure is needed to deliver targeted preventive strategies and maximize net benefit of interventions. To examine the clinical utility of the recently published heart failure-specific risk prediction model, the Pooled Cohort Equations to Prevent Heart Failure, we sought to demonstrate the range of risk values associated with diverse risk factor combinations in White and Black men and women. We varied individual risk factors while holding the other risk factors constant at age-adjusted national mean values for risk factors in each race-sex and age group. We also examined multiple combinations of risk factor levels and examined the range of predicted 10-year heart failure risk using the Pooled Cohort Equations to Prevent Heart Failure risk tool. Ten-year predicted heart failure risk varied widely for each race-sex group across a range of ages and risk factor scenarios. For example, predicted 10-year heart failure risk in a hypothetical 40 year old varied from 0.1% to 9.7% in a White man, 0.5% to 12.3% in a Black man, <0.1% to 9.3% in a White woman, and 0.2% to 28.0% in a Black woman. Higher risk factor burden (e.g. diabetes and hypertension requiring treatment) consistently drove higher risk estimates in all race-sex groups and across all ages. Our analysis highlights the importance of a race and sex-specific multivariable risk prediction model for heart failure to personalize the clinician-patient discussion, inform future practice guidelines, and provide a framework for future risk-based prevention trials for heart failure."
https://openalex.org/W3097170559,"Background Unsafe food becomes a global public health and economic threat to humans. The health status, personal hygiene, knowledge, and practice of food handlers have crucial impact on food contamination. Hence, this study is aimed at assessing the knowledge, practice, and prevalence of Salmonella, Shigella, and intestinal parasites among food handlers in Eastern Tigrai prison centers, Northern Ethiopia. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was carried out from April to September 2019 among food handlers in Eastern Tigrai prison centers, Northern Ethiopia. A structured questionnaire was used to collect the demographic characteristics, the knowledge, and the practice of the study participants. Direct wet mount and formol-ether concentration techniques were applied to identify intestinal parasites. Culture and biochemical tests were used to isolate the Salmonella and the Shigella species. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility tests to selected antibiotics were performed using Kirby-Baur disk diffusion method. We used SPSS version 23 software for statistical analysis. Results Thirty-seven (62.7%, 37/59) of the participants had harbored one or more intestinal parasites. The protozoan Entamoeba histolytica/dispar was detected among 23.7% (14/59) of the study participants who provided stool specimen. Besides, 6.8% (4/59) of the samples were positive for either Salmonella or Shigella species. The Salmonella isolates (n = 2) were sensitive to Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin, Ceftriaxone, and Clarithromycin but resistant to Amoxicillin, Ampicillin, and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. Similarly, the two Shigella isolates were susceptible to Gentamicin, Ciprofloxacin, and Ceftriaxone but showed resistance to Amoxicillin, Tetracycline, and Chloramphenicol. Further, 60.6% (40/66) of the participants had good level of knowledge, and 51.5% (34/66) had good level of practice on foodborne diseases and on food safety. Conclusions We conclude that foodborne pathogens are significant health problems in the study areas. Regular health education and training programs among the food handlers are demanded to tackle foodborne diseases at the prison centers."
https://openalex.org/W3097499856,"We introduce a unified simulation framework that generates natural sensing environments and produces biosonar echoes under various sensing scenarios. This framework produces rich sensory data with environmental information completely known, thus can be used for the training of robotic algorithms for biosonar-based Unmanned Aerial Vehicles. The simulated environment consists of random trees with full geometry of the tree foliage. To simulate a single tree, we adopt the Lindenmayer system to generate the initial branching pattern and integrate that with the available measurements of the 3D computer-aided design object files to create natural-looking branches, sub-branches, and leaves. A forest is formed by simulating trees at random locations generated by using an inhomogeneous Poisson process. While our simulated environments can be generally used for testing other sensors and training robotic algorithms, in this study we focus on testing bat-inspired Unmanned Aerial Vehicles that recreate bat’s flying behavior through biosonar sensors. To this end, we also introduce an foliage echo simulator that produces biosonar echoes while mimicking bat’s biosonar system. We demonstrate the application of the proposed simulation framework by generating real-world scenarios with multiple trees and computing the resulting impulse responses under static or dynamic motions of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle."
https://openalex.org/W3095327779,"Bats possess wings comprised of a flexible membrane and a jointed skeletal structure allowing them to execute complex flight maneuvers such as rapid tight turns. The extent of a bat's tight turning capability can be explored by analyzing a 180-degree U-turn. Prior studies have investigated more subtle flight maneuvers, but the kinematic and aerodynamic mechanisms of a U-turn have not been characterized. In this work, we use 3D optical motion capture and aerodynamic simulations to investigate a U-turn maneuver executed by a great roundleaf bat (Hipposideros armiger: mass = 55 g, span = 51 cm). The bat was observed to decrease its flight velocity and gain approximately 20 cm of altitude entering the U-turn. By lowering its velocity from 2.0 m/s to 0.5 m/s, the centripetal force requirement to execute a tight turn was substantially reduced. Centripetal force was generated by tilting the lift force vector laterally through banking. During the initiation of the U-turn, the bank angle increased from 20 degrees to 40 degrees. During the initiation and persisting throughout the U-turn, the flap amplitude of the right wing (inside of the turn) increased relative to the left wing. In addition, the right wing moved more laterally closer to the centerline of the body during the end of the downstroke and the beginning of the upstroke compared to the left wing. Reorientation of the body into the turn happened prior to a change in the flight path of the bat. Once the bat entered the U-turn and the bank angle increased, the change in flight path of the bat began to change rapidly as the bat negotiated the apex of the turn. During this phase of the turn, the minimum radius of curvature of the bat was 5.5 cm. During the egress of the turn, the bat accelerated and expended stored potential energy by descending. The cycle averaged total power expenditure by the bat during the six wingbeat cycle U-turn maneuver was 0.51 W which was approximately 40% above the power expenditure calculated for a nominally straight flight by the same bat. Future work on the topic of bat maneuverability may investigate a broader array of maneuvering flights characterizing the commonalities and differences across flights. In addition, the interplay between aerodynamic moments and inertial moments are of interest in order to more robustly characterize maneuvering mechanisms."
https://openalex.org/W3095833793,"Asset-intensive industries (including water and power utilities, mineral resources and energy) are those which require significant levels of capital investment in their assets in order to operate. These industries face challenges from uncertainty in resource availability and demand for end products, the intricate and complicated nature of their assets, and the complexity of the economic, ecological and social settings in which they operate. In these industries, the application of decision frameworks that account for this uncertainty and complexity in guiding asset investment and development is standard practice. Lessons from asset-intensive industries were applied during the concept feasibility phase of the Reef Restoration and Adaptation Program (RRAP) to establish the investment case for research and development into interventions to help the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) resist, adapt to, and recover from the impacts of climate change. The authors worked with RRAP partners to define a decision framework that included structured decision-making processes (SDM), a cost-benefit analysis (CBA), and a value of information (VoI) analysis, to establish the investment case for intervening on the GBR which led to success in securing Australian Government commitment for the next phase of the Program. With climate change expected to drive increased demand for significant levels of restoration and adaptation investment in large integrated social, ecological and economic assets (such as the GBR), the lessons from RRAP offer insights for the application of decision frameworks to inform public and private investment priorities."
https://openalex.org/W3096708694,"Background To explore if early perfusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (PWI) may be a promising imaging biomarker to predict local recurrence (LR) of brain metastases after stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS). Methods This is a prospective pilot study of adult brain metastasis patients who were treated with SRS and imaged with PWI before and 1 week later. Relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) parameter maps were calculated by normalizing to the mean value of the contralateral white matter on PWI. Cox regression was conducted to explore factors associated with time to LR, with Bonferroni adjusted p<0.0006 for multiple testing correction. LR rates were estimated with the Kaplan-Meier method and compared using the log-rank test. Results Twenty-three patients were enrolled from 2013 through 2016, with 22 evaluable lesions from 16 patients. After a median follow-up of 13.1 months (range: 3.0–53.7), 5 lesions (21%) developed LR after a median of 3.4 months (range: 2.3–5.7). On univariable analysis, larger tumor volume (HR 1.48, 95% CI 1.02–2.15, p = 0.04), lower SRS dose (HR 0.45, 95% CI 0.21–0.97, p = 0.04), and higher rCBV at week 1 (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.003–1.14, p = 0.04) had borderline association with shorter time to LR. Tumors >2.0cm3 had significantly higher LR than if ≤2.0cm3: 54% vs 0% at 1 year, respectively, p = 0.008. A future study to confirm the association of early PWI and LR of the high-risk cohort of lesions >2.0cm3 is estimated to require 258 patients. Conclusions PWI at week 1 after SRS may have borderline association with LR. Tumors <2.0cm3 have low risk of LR after SRS and may be low-yield for predictive biomarker studies. Information regarding sample size and potential challenges for future imaging biomarker studies may be gleaned from this pilot study."
https://openalex.org/W3096924331,"Nutrigenomic evidence supports the idea that Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) arises due to the interactions between the transcriptome, individual genetic profiles, lifestyle, and diet. Since eggs are a nutrient dense food containing bioactive ingredients that modify gene expression, our goal was to examine the role of whole egg consumption on the transcriptome during T2DM. We analyzed whether whole egg consumption in Zucker Diabetic Fatty (ZDF) rats alters microRNA and mRNA expression across the adipose, liver, kidney, and prefrontal cortex tissue. Male ZDF (fa/fa) rats (n = 12) and their lean controls (fa/+) (n = 12) were obtained at 6 wk of age. Rats had ad libitum access to water and were randomly assigned to a modified semi-purified AIN93G casein-based diet or a whole egg-based diet, both providing 20% protein (w/w). TotalRNA libraries were prepared using QuantSeq 3' mRNA-Seq and Lexogen smallRNA library prep kits and were further sequenced on an Illumina HighSeq3000. Differential gene expression was conducted using DESeq2 in R and Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted P-values controlling for false discovery rate at 5%. We identified 9 microRNAs and 583 genes that were differentially expressed in response to 8 wk of consuming whole egg-based diets. Kyto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes/Gene ontology pathway analyses demonstrated that 12 genes in the glutathione metabolism pathway were upregulated in the liver and kidney of ZDF rats fed whole egg. Whole egg consumption primarily altered glutathione pathways such as conjugation, methylation, glucuronidation, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. These pathways are often negatively affected during T2DM, therefore this data provides unique insight into the nutrigenomic response of dietary whole egg consumption during the progression of T2DM."
https://openalex.org/W3097000903,"Background Sustainability of hand hygiene is challenging in low resource settings. Adding ownership and goal setting to the WHO-5 multimodal intervention may help sustain high compliance. Aim To increase and sustain compliance of nursing and medical staff with hand hygiene in a tertiary referral center with limited resources. Methods A quality improvement initiative was conducted over two years (2016–2018). After determining baseline compliance rates, the WHO-5 multimodal intervention was implemented with staff education and training, system change, hospital reminders, direct observation and feedback, and hospital safety climate. Additionally, the medical staff was responsible for continuous surveillance of compliance (ownership) until rates above 90% were achieved and sustained (goal setting). Results Of 2987 observations collected between August 2016 and April 2018, 1630 (54.5%) were before, and 1357 (45.5%) were after patient encounters. The average overall compliance with hand hygiene was sustained at 94% for nursing and medical staff. Two instances of drops below 90% were associated with incidence of nosocomial Rotavirus infections. There were no similar infections during intervention periods with compliance rates above the set goal. Analysis using p-charts revealed significant improvement in compliance rates from baseline (χ2 (1) = 7.94, p = 0.005). Conclusion Adding ownership and goal setting to the WHO-5 multimodal intervention may help achieve, and sustain high rates of compliance with hand hygiene. Involving health care workers in quality improvement initiatives is feasible, durable, reliable, and cheap, especially in settings with limited financial resources."
https://openalex.org/W3097196602,"Objective To assess usage patterns, perceived usability, and effects of institution-specific guidelines (ISGs) for antimicrobials on clinicians’ prescribing behavior and the additional benefits of the mobile application (app), a single-center survey among medical doctors was performed. Methods The study was carried out in a 1451-bed tertiary-care academic medical center in Leipzig, Germany. To ensure optimal empirical antibiotic therapies, appropriate diagnostics, and targeted antimicrobial prophylaxis, ISGs were provided as printed pocket guides (since 2014), a PDF version on ward computers, and a mobile app (since 2017). For the survey, we used an electronically structured cross-sectional questionnaire with 31 items, ordinal Likert scales, and percent bars, allowing for quantitative comparisons. Results Of the 914 doctors contacted by email, 282 (31%) responded, and 254 (28%) surveys were eligible. ISGs were reported to be the most commonly used source of information for antimicrobial prescribing among the respondents. Ninety-four percent used ISGs at least once and 55% at least weekly. On average, participants reported using them in 38% of antibiotic prescriptions and to adhere to consulted recommendations in 87% of cases. Young clinicians (≤ 30 years) reported significantly higher use of the ISGs than their older colleagues (47% vs. 35% of antibiotic prescriptions, p = 0.004). Ninety-six percent of users found ISGs to be user-friendly, and nearly 100% recommended ISGs to other colleagues. Forty-five percent regarded the app as the most user-friendly way to access ISGs, and app users were significantly more likely to use ISGs regularly (p = 0.024). Eighty-four percent reported behavioral changes regarding at least one aspect of antimicrobial therapy (e.g. duration, application mode, prescription frequency), while 54% reported changes regarding the choice of specific substance groups. Conclusions ISGs are used regularly and appear to have a relevant impact on clinicians’ prescribing habits. A mobile app may be the most effective way to provide ISGs, although multiple platforms seem to add value. While the majority of participants reported perceived effects on their prescribing behavior, this study does not allow any conclusions to be drawn about the extent of the effects of ISGs on antibiotic use and patient outcomes."

Somatic cells can be reprogramed into pluripotent stem cells by overexpression of a set of nuclear factors Oct4/Sox2/Klf4/c-Myc (OKSM) or Yamanaka factors (1Takahashi K. Yamanaka S.

This revolutionary technic, which was termed induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), promised a great opportunity in regeneration medicine. Previously, the reprogramming by OKSM was low in efficiency and dynamics, and the use of oncogene c-Myc, raising the concern of tumorigenicity for the resulting iPSCs. Thus, the alteration of the reprogramming factors, especially the use of nononcogenes or other non-Yamanaka factors, will offer us a safer somatic cell reprogramming technique and new insight(s) for the underlying mechanism in somatic cell reprogramming. Indeed, a set of nuclear factors were reported to play roles in iPSC induction by replacing or combining with the Yamanaka factors. Generally, these nuclear factors can be categorized into two groups: (1) transcriptional factors, which can facilitate somatic cell reprogramming by binding to specific nuclear sequences or motifs, such as Glis1 (3Maekawa M.

Despite the discovery of a set of nuclear factors that facilitate reprogramming, the systematic comparison of their effects, especially in efficiency and dynamics, on reprogramming is lacking. A function ranking of these factors on reprogramming may help us to diagnose the key points of the underlying mechanisms systematically and comprehensively. Previously, we reported a combination of seven factors reprogramming cocktails (Nanog-Esrrb-Glis1-Jdp2-Kdm2b-Sall4-Mkk6) (15Wang B. Wu L. Li D. Liu Y. Guo J. Li C. Yao Y. Wang Y. Zhao G. Wang X.

Yu S. et al.Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Jdp2-Jhdm1b-Mkk6-Glis1-Nanog-Essrb-sall4.Cell Rep. 2019; 27: 3473-3485.e3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), in which the dropout of Sall4 led a max reduction in the reprogramming efficiency, suggesting an outstanding role for Sall4 in cell fate determination. Consistently, Sall4 is reported to play an important role in a range of biological processes, such as somatic cell reprograming (5Tsubooka N. Ichisaka T. Okita K. Takahashi K. Nakagawa M. Yamanaka S. Roles of Sall4 in the generation of pluripotent stem cells from blastocysts and fibroblasts.Genes Cells. 2009; 14: 683-694Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), tumorigenesis, and early embryonic development (16Tatetsu H. Kong N.R. Chong G. Amabile G. Tenen D.G. Chai L. SALL4, the missing link between stem cells, development and cancer.Gene. 2016; 584: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, the underlying mechanism for such an important role remains unclear. In this study, by comparing the efficiency and dynamics of a set of nuclear factors on somatic cell reprogramming, we confirm the critical role of Sall4 on somatic cell reprogramming and identified that a new factor Cecr2, a histone acetyl-lysine reader, can promote the efficiency of somatic cell reprogramming as an effect of Sall4, attempting to improve our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate cell fate transition. Previously, we have reported a group of 7F factors (Nanog-Esrrb-Glis1-Jdp2-Kdm2b-Sall4-Mkk6) that can reprogram mouse fibroblasts into pluripotent stem cells with a ∼10% efficiency (15Wang B. Wu L. Li D. Liu Y. Guo J. Li C. Yao Y. Wang Y. Zhao G. Wang X. Fu M. Liu H. Cao S. Wu C. Yu S. et al.Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Jdp2-Jhdm1b-Mkk6-Glis1-Nanog-Essrb-sall4.Cell Rep. 2019; 27: 3473-3485.e3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In order to see any synergistic or cumulative effect(s) with the classic Yamanaka factors, we performed reprogramming experiments by adding each of the seven factors into Oct4, Sox2, Klf4 (Fig. 1A), and showed that five of the seven factors promote OKS-induced reprogramming (Fig. 1B and Fig. S1, A–B). Notably, Sall4, a member of the spalt-like family members (16Tatetsu H. Kong N.R. Chong G. Amabile G. Tenen D.G. Chai L. SALL4, the missing link between stem cells, development and cancer.Gene. 2016; 584: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), is the most powerful one among them, in agreement with earlier works (17Li D. Liu J. Yang X. Zhou C. Guo J. Wu C. Qin Y. Guo L. He J. Yu S. Liu H. Wang X. Wu F. Kuang J. Hutchins A.P. et al.Chromatin accessibility dynamics during iPSC reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 21: 819-833.e816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 18Thompson P.J. Norton K.A. Niri F.H. Dawe C.E. McDermid H.E. CECR2 is involved in spermatogenesis and forms a complex with SNF2H in the testis.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 415: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We then further examined the reprogramming dynamics for Sall4 in the context of OKS-induced reprogramming with DsRed as Control and showed that Sall4 could promote iPS cell generation as early as day 3 when no iPSC colonies appear in the control group, and finally achieved ∼16% efficiency at day 7, comparing with 7% reprogramming efficiency in the control group (Fig. 1, C–D and Fig. S1, C–E). To reveal any new insight or mechanism for Sall4 in the process of somatic cell reprogramming, we performed time-lapse RNA-seq for OKS+Sall4– or OKS+DsRed–induced reprogramming at day 0, day 1, day 3, day 5, and day 7, respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) for RNA-seq data showed a similar but distinct path from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to embryonic stem cells (ESCs) (Fig. 2A), with an end point at day 7 more closer to ESCs in OKS-Sall4 than in OKS-DsRed, consistent with the fact that the pluripotent genes such as Nanog, Esrrb, and Dppa3 were expressed much higher in OKS-Sall4 samples than in OKS-DsRed samples (Fig. S2, A–B). More importantly, we showed that 921 genes are upregulated and 753 genes are downregulated by Sall4 overexpression, respectively (Fig. 2B). We further showed the sequential activation of the key pluripotent genes by heatmap in a day-by-day manner (Fig. 2C). It is quite clear that the pluripotent genes are activated faster in the OKS+Sall4 group than in the OKS+DsRed group. Consistently, among the GO terms derived from Sall4 upregulated genes are terms such as stem cell population maintenance, maintenance of cell number, and regionalization, whereas among the GO terms derived from the Sall4 downregulated genes are terms such as cellular response to interferon-beta and positive regulation of defense response (Fig. 2D). We then performed ATAC-seq and showed by PCA analysis that, similar to RNA-seq, OKS+Sall4 modulates the chromatin structure toward an ESC-like state more quickly than OKS+DsRed (Fig. 2E). We further investigated the chromatin accessibility dynamics as we described previously (Fig. 2F) (17Li D. Liu J. Yang X. Zhou C. Guo J. Wu C. Qin Y. Guo L. He J. Yu S. Liu H. Wang X. Wu F. Kuang J. Hutchins A.P. et al.Chromatin accessibility dynamics during iPSC reprogramming.Cell Stem Cell. 2017; 21: 819-833.e816Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). We show that, in general, the total number of OC, CO, or PO peaks are quite similar, with 3151 CO peaks, 59,075 OC peaks, and 16,700 PO peaks shared under both conditions (Fig. 2G). Specifically, we found that Sall4 opens the loci of pluripotent genes such as Nanog and Zfp42 and closes those of fibroblast/mesenchymal genes such as Snai1 and Zeb2, suggesting the important role for sall4 in activating and silencing critical genes (Fig. 2H). To further investigate the downstream effector(s) of Sall4 for promoting reprogramming, we first reanalyzed the time-course RNA-Seq data for the 7F factors-induced reprogramming we reported previously (15Wang B. Wu L. Li D. Liu Y. Guo J. Li C. Yao Y. Wang Y. Zhao G. Wang X. Fu M. Liu H. Cao S. Wu C. Yu S. et al.Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Jdp2-Jhdm1b-Mkk6-Glis1-Nanog-Essrb-sall4.Cell Rep. 2019; 27: 3473-3485.e3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). By comparing the gene expression profiles, we generated a panel of candidate genes regulated by Sall4 (Fig. S3A). GO analysis showed that genes responsible for stem cell population maintenance, stem cell differentiation, and stem cell proliferation are upregulated by Sall4 in 7F-induced reprogramming (Fig. S3B). We then compared the expression of stem cell–related genes in both OKS+Sall4– and 7F-induced reprogramming system and showed by Venn diagram for the common or specific genes regulated by Sall4 between the two systems (Fig. S3C, Table S3). To this end, we identified nine genes, Tfcp2l1, Nup210, Lin28a, Cecr2, Trh, Dppa5a, Hmgb2, Rcor2, and Tdh, for further functional analysis based on their relevant expression to Sall4 over-expression in 7F-induced reprogramming system (Fig. S3, D–E). We then over-expressed these nine genes in the OKS-induced reprogramming system and found that Cecr2 is the only hit that could significantly promote somatic cell reprogramming (Fig. 3A, Fig. S3F). We further measured the dynamics of iPSC colonies generated by Cecr2 with Oct4-GFP reporter MEFs and showed that Cecr2 mainly promoted reprogramming at the late stage of reprograming (Fig. 3, B–C). To further confirm these observations, we use Oct4-GFP/Dppa5a-Tdtomato double reporter MEFs as the starting cells and show very similar results (Fig. 3D and Fig. S3G). Consistently, Cecr2 is not activated without Sall4 in the 7F reprogramming system (Fig. 3E), whereas it is activated significantly when Sall4 is over-expressed in the OKS reprogramming system (Fig. 3F). These data suggest that Cecr2 may be regulated by Sall4 directly. To test this further, we performed ChIP(Chromatin Immunoprecipitation)-seq experiments with Sall4 antibody in mESC (Fig. 3G) and detected peaks in the TSS region of Cecr2 locus where open chromatin is evident with ATAC-seq. To test the significance of these peaks, we constructed two reporters by inserting two fragments near Cecr2 TSS as illustrated and found that Sall4 can activate both constructs with luciferase activity (Fig. 3H), suggesting that Sall4 regulated the expression of Cecr2 by directly binding to the transcription start site(TSS) region. We further showed that Cecr2 can slightly replace Sall4 in 7F-induced reprograming functionally (Fig. 3I), whereas there was no synergistic effect with Sall4 in OKS-induced reprogramming (Fig. S3H).We further showed that iPSC colonies derived from OKS+Cecr2 were similar to ESCs in morphology (Fig. S3I) and RNA expression profile (Fig. S3J). These data suggested that Cecr2 is a downstream effector of Sall4 in somatic cell reprogramming. To further investigate the mechanism through which Cecr2 facilitates OKS reprogramming, we performed RNA-seq on OKS+Cecr2 and OKS+DsRed reprogramming cells at D0, D1, D3, D5, and D7. PCA analysis shows little differences between OKS+Cecr2 and OKS+DsRed samples (Fig. 4A). Yet, pluripotent genes, such as Fzd10, Zfp42, and Zscan10, Fbxo15, have higher expression levels at later stage when Cecr2 overexpressed (Fig. 4B), consistent with the higher efficiency. Furthermore, we can identify 615 genes upregulated and 396 downregulated by Cecr2, respectively (Fig. 4C). Gene Ontology or GO analysis reveals that genes upregulated by Cecr2 are enriched in GO terms such as maintenance of cell number, stem cell population maintenance, chromosome organization, and DNA repair, and those downregulated by Cecr2 as regulation of ribonuclease activity, axonogenesis, regulation of nuclease activity, etc. (Fig. 4D). The discrepancy between the overall RNA-seq results and select gene expression in Figure 4A versus Figure 4, B–C suggests that Cecr2 may regulate only a specific set of genes. To confirm this, we performed ATAC-seq on OKS+Cecr2 and OKS+DsRed reprogramming cells at D0, D1, D3, D5, and D7. Indeed, unlike RNA-seq data, PCA analysis for ATAC-seq data demonstrates quite clear divergent paths between OKS+Cecr2 and OKS+DsRed (Fig. 4E). Consistent with the RNA-seq data, the total number of CO, OC, or PO peaks between the two conditions are quite similar (Fig. 4F), with 4404 CO peaks, 55,406 OC peaks, and 17,565 PO peaks shared in both conditions (Fig. 4G). However, the chromatin loci near pluripotent genes such as Zfp42 and Tcl1 are opened more quickly in the Cecr2 group than in the DsRed control group (Fig. 4H), suggesting that Cecr2 promoted reprogramming by reorganizing chromatin structure at late stage of reprogramming. To further investigate the similarities or differences upon the impact to the pluripotent regulation network between Cecr2 and Sall4, we compared the RNA-seq data from OKS+DsRed, OKS+Sall4, and OKS+Cecr2 by heatmap and Gene Ontology analysis and further compared them by using a set of stem cell–related genes and showed that 8 genes such as T, Cdx2, Wdr62, Esrrb, Nanog, Zscan10, Fancc, and Dppa2 are regulated by both CECR2 and SALL4; 3 genes such as Sall4, Sema4a, and Nrtn are regulated by CECR2; 26 genes such as Tet1, Sall1, Tbx3, Tfap2c, Lin28a, and Fgf4 are regulated by SALL4, respectively. (Fig. 4I, Table S3). We also compared the chromatin accessibility dynamics data from OKS+DsRed, OKS+Sall4, and OKS+Cecr2, and PCA analysis showed that the chromatin state of Cecr2 is very close to Sall4 group at the late stage of reprogramming (Fig. S4, A–C). These data suggested that CECR2 plays a significant role in reorganizing chromatin in the late stage of reprogramming. CECR2 is a multidomain transcription factor (19Chen J. Liu J. Yang J. Chen Y. Chen J. Ni S. Song H. Zeng L. Ding K. Pei D. BMPs functionally replace Klf4 and support efficient reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts by Oct4 alone.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) that may modulate chromatin remodeling through its DDT (involved in chromatin remodeling with ISWI), BRD (bromodomain, binds acetylated lysine residue), AT hook, or NLS domains separately or in combination (Fig. 5A). To see which one is responsible for enhancing reprogramming, we generated a set of constructs as shown in Figure 5A and show that the deletion of the DDT domain results in loss of ability to promote OKS reprogramming (Fig. 5B). Previously, Cecr2 was reported to remodel the chromatin structure by forming a complex with SNF2L(SMARCA1) (18Thompson P.J. Norton K.A. Niri F.H. Dawe C.E. McDermid H.E. CECR2 is involved in spermatogenesis and forms a complex with SNF2H in the testis.J. Mol. Biol. 2012; 415: 793-806Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar)，a member of the ISWI family of protein. By co-overexpressing CECR2-HA and SMARCA-3×FLAG in 293 cells, we confirmed this interaction by coimmunoprecipitation (coIP) experiment (Fig. 5C) and further showed that the DDT domain was necessary for this protein–protein interaction (Fig. 5D). Furthermore, we checked this interaction by IP-MS experiment and showed by heatmap that CECR2 could enrich SMARCA1, whereas Cecr2-DTT could not (Fig. 5E, Fig. S5A). Consistently, GO analysis for CECR2-specific interaction proteins showed a significant enrichment in GO term for chromatin remodeling (Fig. 5F, Fig. S5B). These data indicated that CECR2 regulates somatic cell reprogramming by DTT domain–mediated chromatin remodeling. To further investigate the role Cecr2 may play in pluripotency and differentiation, we inactivated Cecr2 by CRISPR-Cas9–mediated gene editing in mESC (Fig. 6A) and confirmed the inactivation of Cecr2 at RNA (Fig. 6B) and protein levels (Fig. 6C). Cecr2 single or double allele knockout ESC are very similar to WT ESC in morphology (Fig. 6D), expression of pluripotent genes (Fig. 6E), and also the three germ layer markers expression when undergoing embryoid bodies differentiation in vitro (Fig. 6F). These data demonstrate that Cecr2 is dispensable for pluripotency or early embryonic development. We further tested the development potential of double allele knockout ESC by injecting the cells into diploid or tetraploid embryos followed by a transfer to pseudo pregnant mouse (Fig. 6G). No live embryos were obtained at 13.5 d.p.c(days post coitum) in tetraploid injection group, whereas 10 live chimera embryos were obtained in the diploid injection group (Fig. S6A), with 2 of 10 showing typical neural tube defected exencephaly (Fig. 6H). We further purified Cere2 KO MEFs by puromycin selection for MEFs derived from E13.5 chimera embryos (Fig. 6H). The Cecr2 KO MEF could be reprogramed into iPSC colonies successfully at an efficiency of ∼5% (Fig. 6I). Consistently, knockdown of Cecr2 by shRNA shows little impact on the reprogramming efficiency (Fig. S6B). These data suggested that Cecr2 is not essential for iPSC generation. However, Sall4 promotes reprogramming more significantly in WT MEFs than in Cecr2 KO MEFs (Fig. 6J). These data suggested that SALL4 promotes somatic cell reprogramming partially by CECR2. Transcriptional factor–based somatic reprogramming is a promising tool for both the study of fundamental mechanism in cell biology and the cell-based therapies in regenerative medicine. A challenge regarding optimization and standardization of this technic is the identification of a gene set that can achieve rapid and efficient iPSC generation in a quantifiable and predictable way. Previously, we demonstrated that Sall4 is the most indispensable transcriptional factor among a new set of 7F reprogramming factor cocktails by which high-quality iPSC colonies could be achieved rapidly and efficiently (15Wang B. Wu L. Li D. Liu Y. Guo J. Li C. Yao Y. Wang Y. Zhao G. Wang X. Fu M. Liu H. Cao S. Wu C. Yu S. et al.Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Jdp2-Jhdm1b-Mkk6-Glis1-Nanog-Essrb-sall4.Cell Rep. 2019; 27: 3473-3485.e3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In this study, we first confirmed the significant role of Sall4 overexpression in the classic Yamanaka factors Oct4/Sox2/Klf4–induced somatic cell reprogramming and further investigated the chromatin accessibility and gene expression dynamics. Importantly, we identified Cecr2, a histone acetyl-lysine reader, is an important responder of SALL4 in somatic cell reprogramming. These results indicate that Cecr2 acts as an effector of Sall4 to modulate the landscape of chromatin accessibility (Fig. 7), which improved our understanding for transcription factors-induced cell fate transition in lineage specification, trans-differentiation, and somatic cell reprogramming. In addition to the classic Yamanaka factors, a series of transcriptional factors have been reported to mediate somatic cell reprogramming (19Chen J. Liu J. Yang J. Chen Y. Chen J. Ni S. Song H. Zeng L. Ding K. Pei D. BMPs functionally replace Klf4 and support efficient reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts by Oct4 alone.Cell Res. 2011; 21: 205-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Among them, Oct4 was regarded to be the most important one, as single Oct4 alone can reprogram MEFs into the pluripotent state (20Lee K.C. Wong W.K. Feng B. Decoding the pluripotency network: the emergence of new transcription factors.Biomedicines. 2013; 1: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Previously, Sall4 has been described as a “star” factor that links between stem cells, development, and cancer (16Tatetsu H. Kong N.R. Chong G. Amabile G. Tenen D.G. Chai L. SALL4, the missing link between stem cells, development and cancer.Gene. 2016; 584: 111-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), and amounts of regulators, partners and targets of SALL4 were identified. Recently, our finding indicated that Sall4 showed an increasing importance beyond other reprogramming factors by a dropout assay in a newly setup 7F reprogramming cocktails (15Wang B. Wu L. Li D. Liu Y. Guo J. Li C. Yao Y. Wang Y. Zhao G. Wang X. Fu M. Liu H. Cao S. Wu C. Yu S. et al.Induction of pluripotent stem cells from mouse embryonic fibroblasts by Jdp2-Jhdm1b-Mkk6-Glis1-Nanog-Essrb-sall4.Cell Rep. 2019; 27: 3473-3485.e3475Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The identification of CECR2 extends the reprogramming factor family members. More importantly, CECR2 has been reported to be a member of an important family of chromatin modification complexes, and this finding will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which Sall4 regulates somatic reprogramming through epigenetic mechanisms, in particular by altering chromatin accessibility. Chromatin modification complexes such as BAF have been reported to be involved in regulating somatic reprogramming (14Singhal N. Graumann J. Wu G. Araúzo-Bravo M.J. Han D.W. Greber B. Gentile L. Mann M. Schöler H.R. Chromatin-remodeling components of the BAF complex facilitate reprogramming.Cell. 2010; 141: 943-955Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). CECR2 has been reported to be involved in somatic reprogramming for the first time. Interestingly, CECR2 has been reported to form chromatin modification complex with SNF2L (20Lee K.C. Wong W.K. Feng B. Decoding the pluripotency network: the emergence of new transcription factors.Biomedicines. 2013; 1: 49-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), suggesting that this complex may be involved in chromatin accessibility changes during Sall4-driven somatic reprogramming, thereby facilitating the somatic reprogramming process. It is important to note whether this CECR2-dependent SALL4-driven chromatin modification process is specific to somatic reprogramming or not. In addition, it is necessary to investigate whether there are similar mechanisms in the fate determination of other cells. Male Oct4–GFP transgenic allele carrying mice (CBA/CaJ × C57BL/6J) were bred with 129Sv/Jae female mice to get OG2MEFs from 13.5 d.p.c mouse embryos. ODMEFs were isolated from 13.5 d.p.c mouse embryos from hybrids of Dppa5a-tdTomato reporter male mice (129) and OG2 female mice (CBA/CaJ × C57BL/6J). MEFs and PlatE cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), non-essential amino acids(NEAA) and GlutaMAX supplement. mESCs were maintained on feeder layers with mES+2i medium (DMEM, 15% FBS, NEAA, GlutaMAX, β-Mercaptoethanol, PD0325901, Chir99021, LIF) or feeder free with N2B27+2i medium (knockout/DMEM, DMEM, N2, B27, NEAA, GlutaMAX, β-ME, PD0325901, Chir99021, LIF). A total of 8 × 106 plat-E cells were seeded into 100-mm dish 1 day before transfection. Calcium phosphate transfection was performed when cell confluence reached 80%. Retrovirus supernatants were collected 48 and 72 h post transfection and filtered by 0.45-μm filter (Millipore). Retrovirus supernatants could be stored at room temperature for 24 h About 12 to 24 h before infection, MEFs were seeded into 12- or 24-well plate at a density of 5000 cells/cm2. Each retrovirus supernatant and MEFs culture medium were mixed at a ratio of 1:1 with 4 g/ml polybrene to infect MEFs. After twice infection, MEFs were changed to iCD1 medium (21Chen J. Liu J.

We focus on whether the experience of having just competed in a contest, beyond its outcome, would have an impact on other-regarding decisions towards an individual who was not part of the preliminary contest. In addition, in light of inconclusive results in the existing literature regarding the effect of contest outcome on subsequent prosociality, we reexamine this effect. In line with our hypothesis, participation in a contest was found to reduce prosociality. Additionally, we found that winning a contest reduced prosociality only when decisions were framed as “giving” decisions and not as “dividing” decisions. This finding suggests that the effect of contest outcome may depend on specific elements of the presented situations."
https://openalex.org/W3096300568,"Little information exists on songbird roosting habits and the types of habitats that songbirds select. To better understand a species' habitat requirements, all aspects of its biology should be studied. The Cerulean Warbler (Setophaga cerulea, Wilson) is a Nearctic-Neotropical migrant that is a species of conservation concern across its range. It is one of the fastest declining species of wood-warbler (Parulidae) in North America. Since 2007, a breeding population of Cerulean Warblers has been monitored in southern Indiana, as part of the Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment. The Hardwood Ecosystem Experiment is a 100 yr project that studies the effects of different forest management practices on plant and animal communities. During the 2017 breeding season, 10 male Cerulean Warblers were tracked to roost locations. Roost sites selected by male Cerulean Warbler were characterized with less basal area, higher canopy cover, greater grapevine (Vitis spp., L.) presence, less shrubs, steeper slopes, and less white oak (Quercus alba, L.) abundance. With this new knowledge we can incorporate additional features of habitat in the formulation of a management plan for this declining species."
https://openalex.org/W3096491152,"Recipients of Medical Aid, a government-funded social assistance program for the poor, have a shorter life expectancy than National Health Insurance beneficiaries in Korea. This study aims to explore the contributions of age and major causes of death to the life expectancy difference between the two groups. We used the National Health Information Database provided by the National Health Insurance Service individually linked to mortality registration data of Statistics Korea between 2008 and 2017. Annual abridged life tables were constructed and Arriaga’s life expectancy decomposition method was employed to estimate age- and cause-specific contributions to the life expectancy gap between National Health Insurance beneficiaries and Medical Aid recipients. The life expectancy difference between National Health Insurance beneficiaries and Medical Aid recipients was 14.5 years during the period of 2008–2017. The age groups between 30 and 64 years accounted for 78.7% and 67.5% of the total life expectancy gap in men and women, respectively. Cancer was the leading cause of death contributing to excess mortality among Medical Aid recipients compared to National Health Insurance beneficiaries. More specifically, alcohol-attributable deaths (such as alcoholic liver disease, liver cancer, liver cirrhosis, and alcohol/substance abuse), suicide, and cardiometabolic risk factor–related deaths (such as cerebrovascular disease, ischemic heart disease, and diabetes) were the leading contributors to the life expectancy gap. To decrease excess deaths in Medical Aid recipients and reduce health inequalities, effective policies for tobacco and alcohol regulation, suicide prevention, and interventions to address cardiometabolic risk factors are needed."
https://openalex.org/W3096742202,"Background The Healthcare Access and Quality (HAQ) index, developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, uses estimates of amenable mortality to quantify health system performance over time. While much is known about general health system performance globally, few studies have portrayed the performance of surgical systems. In order to quantify access to quality surgical care, evaluate changes over time, and link these changes to health care investments, surgical and non-surgical Health Access and Quality sub-indices were developed. Design We categorized 32 amenable mortality causes as either surgical or non-surgical conditions. Using principal components analysis and scaled amenable mortality rates, we constructed a surgical and non-surgical Health Access and Quality sub-index. Using these sub-indices, relative improvement over time was compared. An expenditure model with country fixed effects was built to explore drivers of differences in relative improvement of sub-indices. Results Compared to low-income countries, high-income countries have been 2.77 times more effective at improving surgical care (p < .05). Government expenditure on healthcare has a larger effect on improving surgical Health Access and Quality (p < 0.05) while development assistance for health has a larger effect on improving non-surgical Health Access and Quality (p < 0.05). Conclusions and relevance Global health investment must prioritize strengthening health systems as opposed to the historically favored vertical programming. In order to achieve health equity in low-income countries, more focus should be placed on domestic financing of surgical systems. Health Access and Quality sub-indices can be used by countries to identify targets, monitor progress, and evaluate interventions aimed at improving access to quality surgical healthcare."
https://openalex.org/W3096776785,"Background Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive disease with a high morbidity and mortality. Some of the mechanisms of fibrosis development have been described using rodent models; however, the relevance of findings in these animal models is difficult to assess. New innovative models are needed that closely mimic IPF disease pathology. Methods To overcome this unmet need of investigating IPF with a relevant model, we utilized tree shrews, which are genetically, anatomically, and metabolically similar to primates and humans. Using human antibodies and primers, we investigated the role of macrophage phenotypic switching in normal and IPF subjects and bleomycin-injured tree shrews. Results Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells from tree shrews expressed human markers, and there was recruitment of monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) to the lung in IPF subjects and bleomycin-injured tree shrews. MDMs were polarized to a profibrotic phenotype in IPF and in bleomycin-injured tree shrews. Resident alveolar macrophages (RAMs) expressed proinflammatory markers regardless of bleomycin exposure. Tree shrews developed bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis with architectural distortion in parenchyma and widespread collagen deposition. Conclusion The profibrotic polarization of macrophages has been demonstrated to be present in IPF subjects and in fibrotic mice. Although the lung macrophages have long been considered to be homogeneous, recent evidence indicates that these cells are heterogeneous during multiple chronic lung diseases. Here, we show new data that indicate a critical and essential role for macrophage-fibroblast crosstalk promoting fibroblast differentiation and collagen production. in the development and progression of fibrosis. The current data strongly suggest development of therapeutics that attenuate of the profibrotic activation of MDMs may mitigate macrophage-fibroblast interaction. These observations demonstrate that tree shrews are an ideal animal model to investigate the pathogenesis of IPF as they are genetically, anatomically, and metabolically closer to humans than the more commonly used rodent models."
https://openalex.org/W3097102424,"The impact of influenza vaccination is largely measured by estimating vaccine effectiveness (VE), which vary in different seasons. Strain mutations and waning immunity present two key mechanisms affecting VE. We sought to quantify the relative effect of these mechanisms by projecting VE and the reduction of illness due to vaccination. We developed a stochastic age-structured agent-based simulation model of influenza transmission dynamics to encapsulate intraseason waning of immunity post-vaccination, and mutation-induced antigenic distance between circulating strains and vaccine strains. Parameterizing the model with published estimates, we projected the temporal and overall VE during an epidemic season, and estimated the reduction of infection for high (70%) and low (30%) vaccine efficacies to reflect the levels of vaccine-induced protection in randomized control trials. Both temporal and overall VE decreased as the attack rate increased, with lower median values for epidemics starting with strains that were antigenically more distant from vaccine strains. We observed a higher rate of temporal decline with considerably lower median values of the overall VE in the presence of intraseason waning of immunity compared with only the antigenic distance effect. The highest benefit of vaccination in preventing influenza infection was achieved at moderate attack rates in the range of 6%-15%. The results show that even when VE is relatively low in the population and almost negligible for older age groups (i.e., 50+ years), vaccination can still prevent significant illness in high-risk individuals; thereby reducing healthcare resource utilization and economic burden. Our study indicates that early vaccination remains an important strategy for alleviating the burden of seasonal influenza. Policy discussions on optimal timing of vaccination to reduce the effect of intraseason waning of immunity should be considered in the context of strain mutations within the epidemic course."
https://openalex.org/W3097700764,"An MSK model of care for hip and knee patients integrated with an electronic referral solution (eReferral) has been deployed within four subregions across Ontario. Referrals are sent from primary care offices to a central intake (CI), where the referral forms are reviewed and forwarded, if appropriate, to a rapid access clinic (RAC) where patients are assessed by an advanced practice clinician (APC). The pragmatic design of eReferral allows for a seamless flow of electronic orthopedic referrals from primary care to CI. It also enables CI to process and transcribe faxed referrals into the eReferral system for a smooth flow of data electronically to the RACs. In general, wait time is the time interval between receiving the patient’s referral at CI or the surgeon’s office until receiving the orthopedic surgeon's first consultation. Wait time is further broken down into wait 1 a and wait 1 b. Wait 1 a is the time between the receipt of the referral at CI until the date of the first initial assessment at the RAC. This study aimed at: a) assessing the processing time of orthopedic referrals at central intakes (CI) to be forwarded to the RAC, b) assessing the wait time (wait 1 a) of orthopedic referrals processed through the eReferral system to receive an initial assessment at the RACs. c) comparing the ability of the RACs to meet the target wait time for assessment (four weeks) by the method of referral (eReferrals vs. fax). d) evaluating patients’ satisfaction with the length of time they waited to receive care at the RACs with eReferral. We used Ocean eReferral database to access MSK hip and knee referral data processed through the system. Patients whose referrals were initiated electronically through the system and opted to receive email notification of their referral status had the opportunity to take an online satisfaction survey embedded in the booked appointment notification message. There were 1,723 patients initially referred electronically for hip, and knee pain consults, while 13,780 referrals started as paper-based and transcribed into the system to be forwarded later electronically by CI to a RAC. Higher mean processing time at CI by 21.76 days for paper-based referral was detected as opposed to referrals received electronically (p<0.001). RACs took significantly less time to book appointments for referrals initiated electronically with a shorter average wait 1a of 21.42 days for eReferrals compared to paper-based referrals (p<0.001). RACs timeframe to book an appointment was significantly shorter for eReferrals versus fax referrals. A total of 393 patients completed the patient satisfaction survey with a response rate of 16%. Overall, 87.7% were satisfied with their experience with the eReferral process, and 81% agreed that they had waited a reasonable time to receive the needed care. eReferral can elicit faster processing of referrals and shorter wait time for patients, which improved patient satisfaction with the referral process."
