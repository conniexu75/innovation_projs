https://openalex.org/W2803040262,"Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) and other diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs) with mutated histone H3 K27M (H3-K27M)1-5 are aggressive and universally fatal pediatric brain cancers 6 . Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-expressing T cells have mediated impressive clinical activity in B cell malignancies7-10, and recent results suggest benefit in central nervous system malignancies11-13. Here, we report that patient-derived H3-K27M-mutant glioma cell cultures exhibit uniform, high expression of the disialoganglioside GD2. Anti-GD2 CAR T cells incorporating a 4-1BBz costimulatory domain 14 demonstrated robust antigen-dependent cytokine generation and killing of DMG cells in vitro. In five independent patient-derived H3-K27M+ DMG orthotopic xenograft models, systemic administration of GD2-targeted CAR T cells cleared engrafted tumors except for a small number of residual GD2lo glioma cells. To date, GD2-targeted CAR T cells have been well tolerated in clinical trials15-17. Although GD2-targeted CAR T cell administration was tolerated in the majority of mice bearing orthotopic xenografts, peritumoral neuroinflammation during the acute phase of antitumor activity resulted in hydrocephalus that was lethal in a fraction of animals. Given the precarious neuroanatomical location of midline gliomas, careful monitoring and aggressive neurointensive care management will be required for human translation. With a cautious multidisciplinary clinical approach, GD2-targeted CAR T cell therapy for H3-K27M+ diffuse gliomas of pons, thalamus and spinal cord could prove transformative for these lethal childhood cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2797293309,"We develop a Bayesian mixed linear model that simultaneously estimates single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-based heritability, polygenicity (proportion of SNPs with nonzero effects), and the relationship between SNP effect size and minor allele frequency for complex traits in conventionally unrelated individuals using genome-wide SNP data. We apply the method to 28 complex traits in the UK Biobank data (N = 126,752) and show that on average, 6% of SNPs have nonzero effects, which in total explain 22% of phenotypic variance. We detect significant (P < 0.05/28) signatures of natural selection in the genetic architecture of 23 traits, including reproductive, cardiovascular, and anthropometric traits, as well as educational attainment. The significant estimates of the relationship between effect size and minor allele frequency in complex traits are consistent with a model of negative (or purifying) selection, as confirmed by forward simulation. We conclude that negative selection acts pervasively on the genetic variants associated with human complex traits. BayesS estimates SNP-based heritability, polygenicity, and the relationship between effect size and minor allele frequency using genome-wide SNP data. Applying BayesS to UK Biobank data identifies signatures of natural selection for 23 complex traits."
https://openalex.org/W2797145001,"Cancer and other cells residing in the same niche engage various modes of interactions to synchronize and buffer the negative effects of environmental changes. Extracellular microRNAs (miRNAs) have recently been implicated in the intercellular crosstalk. Here we show a mechanistic model involving breast-cancer-secreted, extracellular-vesicle-encapsulated miR-105, which is induced by the oncoprotein MYC in cancer cells and, in turn, activates MYC signalling in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to induce a metabolic program. This results in the capacity of CAFs to display different metabolic features in response to changes in the metabolic environment. When nutrients are sufficient, miR-105-reprogrammed CAFs enhance glucose and glutamine metabolism to fuel adjacent cancer cells. When nutrient levels are low and metabolic by-products accumulate, these CAFs detoxify metabolic wastes, including lactic acid and ammonium, by converting them into energy-rich metabolites. Thus, the miR-105-mediated metabolic reprogramming of stromal cells contributes to sustained tumour growth by conditioning the shared metabolic environment. Consistent crosstalk between cancer cells and stromal cells exists in the tumour microenvironment. Yan et al. show that exosomal miR-105 derived from cancer cells confers metabolic plasticity in recipient cancer-associated fibroblasts to adapt to nutrient-replete and -deplete conditions, thereby sustaining tumour growth."
https://openalex.org/W2803062674,"Explaining the genetics of many diseases is challenging because most associations localize to incompletely characterized regulatory regions. Using new computational methods, we show that transcription factors (TFs) occupy multiple loci associated with individual complex genetic disorders. Application to 213 phenotypes and 1,544 TF binding datasets identified 2,264 relationships between hundreds of TFs and 94 phenotypes, including androgen receptor in prostate cancer and GATA3 in breast cancer. Strikingly, nearly half of systemic lupus erythematosus risk loci are occupied by the Epstein-Barr virus EBNA2 protein and many coclustering human TFs, showing gene-environment interaction. Similar EBNA2-anchored associations exist in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and celiac disease. Instances of allele-dependent DNA binding and downstream effects on gene expression at plausibly causal variants support genetic mechanisms dependent on EBNA2. Our results nominate mechanisms that operate across risk loci within disease phenotypes, suggesting new models for disease origins."
https://openalex.org/W2797749276,"The reactivity of aluminium compounds is dominated by their electron deficiency and consequent electrophilicity; these compounds are archetypal Lewis acids (electron-pair acceptors). The main industrial roles of aluminium, and classical methods of synthesizing aluminium-element bonds (for example, hydroalumination and metathesis), draw on the electron deficiency of species of the type AlR3 and AlCl31,2. Whereas aluminates, [AlR4]-, are well known, the idea of reversing polarity and using an aluminium reagent as the nucleophilic partner in bond-forming substitution reactions is unprecedented, owing to the fact that low-valent aluminium anions analogous to nitrogen-, carbon- and boron-centred reagents of the types [NX2]-, [CX3]- and [BX2]- are unknown3-5. Aluminium compounds in the +1 oxidation state are known, but are thermodynamically unstable with respect to disproportionation. Compounds of this type are typically oligomeric6-8, although monomeric systems that possess a metal-centred lone pair, such as Al(Nacnac)Dipp (where (Nacnac)Dipp = (NDippCR)2CH and R = t Bu, Me; Dipp = 2,6- i Pr2C6H3), have also been reported9,10. Coordination of these species, and also of (Î·5-C5Me5)Al, to a range of Lewis acids has been observed11-13, but their primary mode of reactivity involves facile oxidative addition to generate Al(III) species6-8,14-16. Here we report the synthesis, structure and reaction chemistry of an anionic aluminium(I) nucleophile, the dimethylxanthene-stabilized potassium aluminyl [K{Al(NON)}]2 (NON = 4,5-bis(2,6-diisopropylanilido)-2,7-di-tert-butyl-9,9-dimethylxanthene). This species displays unprecedented reactivity in the formation of aluminium-element covalent bonds and in the C-H oxidative addition of benzene, suggesting that it could find further use in both metal-carbon and metal-metal bond-forming reactions."
https://openalex.org/W2783798065,"Prostate cancer represents a substantial clinical challenge because it is difficult to predict outcome and advanced disease is often fatal. We sequenced the whole genomes of 112 primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples. From joint analysis of these cancers with those from previous studies (930 cancers in total), we found evidence for 22 previously unidentified putative driver genes harboring coding mutations, as well as evidence for NEAT1 and FOXA1 acting as drivers through noncoding mutations. Through the temporal dissection of aberrations, we identified driver mutations specifically associated with steps in the progression of prostate cancer, establishing, for example, loss of CHD1 and BRCA2 as early events in cancer development of ETS fusion-negative cancers. Computational chemogenomic (canSAR) analysis of prostate cancer mutations identified 11 targets of approved drugs, 7 targets of investigational drugs, and 62 targets of compounds that may be active and should be considered candidates for future clinical trials. Joint analysis of new and previously published sequencing data for primary and metastatic prostate cancers identifies new candidate driver mutations and provides insights into disease progression and potential drug targets."
https://openalex.org/W2797715364,"Structural variants (SVs) can result in changes in gene expression due to abnormal chromatin folding and cause disease. However, the prediction of such effects remains a challenge. Here we present a polymer-physics-based approach (PRISMR) to model 3D chromatin folding and to predict enhancer-promoter contacts. PRISMR predicts higher-order chromatin structure from genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. Using the EPHA4 locus as a model, the effects of pathogenic SVs are predicted in silico and compared to Hi-C data generated from mouse limb buds and patient-derived fibroblasts. PRISMR deconvolves the folding complexity of the EPHA4 locus and identifies SV-induced ectopic contacts and alterations of 3D genome organization in homozygous or heterozygous states. We show that SVs can reconfigure topologically associating domains, thereby producing extensive rewiring of regulatory interactions and causing disease by gene misexpression. PRISMR can be used to predict interactions in silico, thereby providing a tool for analyzing the disease-causing potential of SVs."
https://openalex.org/W2797892668,"The primary output cells of the cerebellar cortex, Purkinje cells, make kinematic predictions about ongoing movements via high-frequency simple spikes, but receive sensory error information about that movement via low-frequency complex spikes (CS). How is the vector space of sensory errors encoded by this low-frequency signal? Here we measured Purkinje cell activity in the oculomotor vermis of animals during saccades, then followed the chain of events from experience of visual error, generation of CS, modulation of simple spikes, and ultimately change in motor output. We found that while error direction affected the probability of CS, error magnitude altered its temporal distribution. Production of CS changed the simple spikes on the next trial, but regardless of the actual visual error, this change biased the movement only along a vector that was parallel to the Purkinje cell's preferred error. From these results, we inferred the anatomy of a sensory-to-motor adaptive controller that transformed visual error vectors into motor-corrections."

https://openalex.org/W2801745895,"This work presents a novel method for learning a model that can diagnose Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), as well as Autism, using structural texture and functional connectivity features obtained from 3-dimensional structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 4-dimensional resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of subjects. We explore a series of three learners: (1) The LeFMS learner first extracts features from the structural MRI images using the texture-based filters produced by a sparse autoencoder. These filters are then convolved with the original MRI image using an unsupervised convolutional network. The resulting features are used as input to a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. (2) The LeFMF learner produces a diagnostic model by first computing spatial non-stationary independent components of the fMRI scans, which it uses to decompose each subject's fMRI scan into the time courses of these common spatial components. These features can then be used with a learner by themselves or in combination with other features to produce the model. Regardless of which approach is used, the final set of features are input to a linear support vector machine (SVM) classifier. (3) Finally, the overall LeFMSF learner uses the combined features obtained from the two feature extraction processes in (1) and (2) above as input to an SVM classifier, achieving an accuracy of 0.673 on the ADHD-200 holdout data and 0.643 on the ABIDE holdout data. Both of these results, obtained with the same LeFMSF framework, are the best known, over all hold-out accuracies on these datasets when only using imaging data-exceeding previously-published results by 0.012 for ADHD and 0.042 for Autism. Our results show that combining multi-modal features can yield good classification accuracy for diagnosis of ADHD and Autism, which is an important step towards computer-aided diagnosis of these psychiatric diseases and perhaps others as well."
https://openalex.org/W2799524808,"Proliferating cells, compared with quiescent cells, are more dependent on glucose for their growth. Although glucose transport in keratinocytes is mediated largely by the Glut1 facilitative transporter, we found that keratinocyte-specific ablation of Glut1 did not compromise mouse skin development and homeostasis. Ex vivo metabolic profiling revealed altered sphingolipid, hexose, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolism in Glut1-deficient keratinocytes, thus suggesting metabolic adaptation. However, cultured Glut1-deficient keratinocytes displayed metabolic and oxidative stress and impaired proliferation. Similarly, Glut1 deficiency impaired in vivo keratinocyte proliferation and migration within wounded or UV-damaged mouse skin. Notably, both genetic and pharmacological Glut1 inactivation decreased hyperplasia in mouse models of psoriasis-like disease. Topical application of a Glut1 inhibitor also decreased inflammation in these models. Glut1 inhibition decreased the expression of pathology-associated genes in human psoriatic skin organoids. Thus, Glut1 is selectively required for injury- and inflammation-associated keratinocyte proliferation, and its inhibition offers a novel treatment strategy for psoriasis. Keratinocytes require glucose for injury- or inflammation-driven but not homeostatic proliferation, and glucose-transport blockade blocks psoriasis-like pathology in experimental models."

https://openalex.org/W2802584574,"In the absence of an effective and safe vaccine against HIV-1, the administration of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) represents a logical alternative approach to prevent virus transmission. Here, we introduced two mutations encoding amino acid substitutions (M428L and N434S, collectively referred to as âLSâ) into the genes encoding the crystallizable fragment domains of the highly potent HIV-specific 3BNC117 and 10-1074 bNAbs to increase their half-lives and evaluated their efficacy in blocking infection following repeated low-dose mucosal challenges of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) with the tier 2 SHIVAD8-EO. A single intravenous infusion of 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibodies markedly delayed virus acquisition for 18 to 37 weeks (median, 27 weeks), whereas the protective effect of the 3BNC117-LS bNAb was more modest (provided protection for 11â23 weeks; median, 17 weeks). Serum concentrations of the 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibody gradually declined and became undetectable in all recipients between weeks 26 and 41, whereas the 3BNC117-LS bNAb exhibited a shorter half-life. To model immunoprophylaxis against genetically diverse and/or neutralization-resistant HIV-1 strains, a combination of the 3BNC117-LS plus 10-1074-LS monoclonal antibodies was injected into macaques via the more clinically relevant subcutaneous route. Even though the administered mixture contained an amount of each bNAb that was nearly threefold less than the quantity of the single monoclonal antibody in the intravenous injections, the monoclonal antibody combination still protected macaques for a median of 20 weeks. The extended period of protection observed in macaques for the 3BNC117-LS plus 10-1074-LS combination could translate into an effective semiannual or annual immunoprophylaxis regimen for preventing HIV-1 infections in humans."

https://openalex.org/W2797102036,"Behaviorally and pathologically relevant cortico-thalamo-cortical oscillations are driven by diverse interacting cell-intrinsic and synaptic processes. However, the mechanism that gives rise to the paroxysmal oscillations of absence seizures (ASs) remains unknown. Here we report that, during ASs in behaving animals, cortico-thalamic excitation drives thalamic firing by preferentially eliciting tonic rather than T-type Ca 2+ channel (T-channel)-dependent burst firing in thalamocortical (TC) neurons and by temporally framing thalamic output via feedforward reticular thalamic (NRT)-to-TC neuron inhibition. In TC neurons, overall ictal firing was markedly reduced and bursts rarely occurred. Moreover, blockade of T-channels in cortical and NRT neurons suppressed ASs, but such blockade in TC neurons had no effect on seizures or on ictal thalamic output synchrony. These results demonstrate ictal bidirectional cortico-thalamic communications and provide the first mechanistic understanding of cortico-thalamo-cortical network firing dynamics during ASs in behaving animals."

https://openalex.org/W2949240801,"Changes in behavioral state can profoundly influence brain function. Here we show that behavioral state modulates performance in delay eyeblink conditioning, a cerebellum-dependent form of associative learning. Increased locomotor speed in head-fixed mice drove earlier onset of learning and trial-by-trial enhancement of learned responses that were dissociable from changes in arousal and independent of sensory modality. Eyelid responses evoked by optogenetic stimulation of mossy fiber inputs to the cerebellum, but not at sites downstream, were positively modulated by ongoing locomotion. Substituting prolonged, low-intensity optogenetic mossy fiber stimulation for locomotion was sufficient to enhance conditioned responses. Our results suggest that locomotor activity modulates delay eyeblink conditioning through increased activation of the mossy fiber pathway within the cerebellum. Taken together, these results provide evidence for a novel role for behavioral state modulation in associative learning and suggest a potential mechanism through which engaging in movement can improve an individualâs ability to learn. Albergaria et al. demonstrate that ongoing locomotor activity modulates cerebellum-dependent associative learning. Optogenetic circuit dissection reveals a site of locomotor modulation within the mossy fiber pathway in the cerebellum."
https://openalex.org/W2798256710,"Major depressive disorder (MDD) is considered a âcircuitopathyâ, and brain stimulation therapies hold promise for ameliorating MDD symptoms, including hippocampal dysfunction. It is unknown whether stimulation of upstream hippocampal circuitry, such as the entorhinal cortex (Ent), is antidepressive, although Ent stimulation improves learning and memory in mice and humans. Here we show that molecular targeting (Ent-specific knockdown of a psychosocial stress-induced protein) and chemogenetic stimulation of Ent neurons induce antidepressive-like effects in mice. Mechanistically, we show that Ent-stimulation-induced antidepressive-like behavior relies on the generation of new hippocampal neurons. Thus, controlled stimulation of Ent hippocampal afferents is antidepressive via increased hippocampal neurogenesis. These findings emphasize the power and potential of Ent glutamatergic afferent stimulationâpreviously well-known for its ability to influence learning and memoryâfor MDD treatment."
https://openalex.org/W2797779767,"Identifying targets of antibacterial compounds remains a challenging step in the development of antibiotics. We have developed a two-pronged functional genomics approach to predict mechanism of action that uses mutant fitness data from antibiotic-treated transposon libraries containing both upregulation and inactivation mutants. We treated a Staphylococcus aureus transposon library containing 690,000 unique insertions with 32 antibiotics. Upregulation signatures identified from directional biases in insertions revealed known molecular targets and resistance mechanisms for the majority of these. Because single-gene upregulation does not always confer resistance, we used a complementary machine-learning approach to predict the mechanism from inactivation mutant fitness profiles. This approach suggested the cell wall precursor Lipid II as the molecular target of the lysocins, a mechanism we have confirmed. We conclude that docking to membrane-anchored Lipid II precedes the selective bacteriolysis that distinguishes these lytic natural products, showing the utility of our approach for nominating the antibiotic mechanism of action. Use of a combined Tn-seq and machine-learning approach for predicting mechanisms and targets of antibiotic action in Staphylococcus aureus shows that the natural product lysocin E (LysE) binds Lipid II on the cell surface and damages the membrane."
https://openalex.org/W2801930502,"Current measures of social cognition have shown inconsistent findings regarding the effects of healthy aging. Moreover, no tests are currently available that allow clinicians and researchers to examine cognitive and affective theory of mind (ToM) and understanding of social norms within the same test. To address these limitations, we present the Edinburgh Social Cognition Test (ESCoT) which assesses cognitive and affective ToM and inter- and intrapersonal understanding of social norms. We examined the effects of age, measures of intelligence and the Broader Autism Phenotype (BAP) on the ESCoT and established tests of social cognition. Additionally, we investigated the convergent validity of the ESCoT based on traditional social cognition measures. The ESCoT was administered alongside Reading the Mind in Films (RMF), Reading the Mind in Eyes (RME), Judgement of Preference and Social Norm Questionnaire to 91 participants (30 aged 18-35 years, 30 aged 45-60 years and 31 aged 65-85 years). Poorer performance on the cognitive and affective ToM ESCoT subtests were predicted by increasing age. The affective ToM ESCoT subtest and RMF were predicted by gender, where being female predicted better performance. Unlike the ESCoT, better performance on the RMF was predicted by higher verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning abilities, while better performance on the RME was predicted by higher verbal comprehension scores. Lower scores on inter-and intrapersonal understanding of social norms were both predicted by the presence of more autism-like traits while poorer interpersonal understanding of social norms performance was predicted by increasing age. These findings show that the ESCoT is a useful measure of social cognition and, unlike established tests of social cognition, performance is not predicted by measures of verbal comprehension and perceptual reasoning. This is particularly valuable to obtain an accurate assessment of the influence of age on our social cognitive abilities."
https://openalex.org/W2797602212,"A robust network of transcription factors and an open chromatin landscape are hallmarks of the naive pluripotent state. Recently, the acetyllysine reader Brd4 has been implicated in stem cell maintenance, but the relative contribution of Brd4 to pluripotency remains unclear. Here, we show that Brd4 is dispensable for self-renewal and pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESCs). When maintained in their ground state, ESCs retain transcription factor binding and chromatin accessibility independent of Brd4 function or expression. In metastable ESCs, Brd4 independence can be achieved by increased expression of pluripotency transcription factors, including STAT3, Nanog or Klf4, so long as the DNA methylcytosine oxidases Tet1 and Tet2 are present. These data reveal that Brd4 is not essential for ESC self-renewal. Rather, the levels of pluripotency transcription factor abundance and Tet1/2 function determine the extent to which bromodomain recognition of protein acetylation contributes to the maintenance of gene expression and cell identity."
https://openalex.org/W2799358787,"Tumor-initiating cells (TIC) represent a subset of tumor cells with increased self-renewal capability. TICs display resistance to frontline cancer treatment and retain the ability to repopulate a tumor after therapy, leading to cancer relapse. NOTCH signaling has been identified as an important driver of the TIC population, yet mechanisms governing regulation of this pathway in cancer remain to be fully elucidated. Here we identify a novel mechanism of NOTCH regulation and TIC induction in breast cancer via the miR-106b-25 miRNA cluster. We show that the miR-106b-25 cluster upregulates NOTCH1 in multiple breast cancer cell lines, representing both estrogen receptor (ER+) and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) through direct repression of the E3 ubiquitin ligase, NEDD4L. We further show that upregulation of NOTCH1 is necessary for TIC induction downstream of miR-106b-25 in both ER + and TNBC breast cancer cells, and that re-expression of NEDD4L is sufficient to reverse miR106b-25-mediated NOTCH1 upregulation and TIC induction. Importantly, we demonstrate a significant positive correlation between miR-106b-25 and NOTCH1 protein, yet a significant inverse correlation between miR-106b-25 and NEDD4L mRNA in human breast cancer, suggesting a critical role for the miR106b-25/NEDD4L/NOTCH1 axis in the disease. Further, we show for the first time that NEDD4L expression alone is significantly associated with a better relapse-free prognosis for breast cancer patients. These data expand our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying NOTCH activation and TIC induction in breast cancer, and may provide new avenues for the development of therapies targeting this resistant subset of tumor cells."

https://openalex.org/W2801486690,"Background The effect of cigarette smoking on the onset of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is unclear, especially that associated with drinking small amounts of alcohol. We conducted a longitudinal study to investigate the relationship between cigarette smoking and NAFLD onset, which was stratified according to the amount of alcohol consumed. Methods We enrolled 7,905 Japanese subjects who had received annual health checkups more than twice between April 2003 and August 2013, 4,045 of whom met at least one of the following exclusion criteria and were excluded: (a) fatty liver at baseline; (b) hepatitis B or hepatitis C; (c) alcohol consumption (men: â¥210 g/wk; women: â¥140 g/wk); (d) change in alcohol drinking status between baseline and the studyâs endpoint; (e) change in cigarette smoking habits between baseline and the studyâs endpoint; or (f) current treatment with antidiabetic agents, antihypertensive agents, and/or lipid-lowering agents. The remaining 3,860 subjects (1,512 men, 2,348 women) were divided into two groups based on average alcohol consumption. Results After adjusting for the variables associated with metabolic disease, smoking was associated with fatty liver disease onset compared with nonsmokers in nondrinkers (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.988, 95% confidence interval 1.057â3.595; p = 0.034). No association was found between smoking and fatty liver disease onset in the low alcohol consumption group (men: <210 g alcohol/week; women: <140 g alcohol/week). The fatty liver disease incidence increased significantly among the nondrinkers as the number of cigarettes smoked increased (p = 0.001). Conclusions Cigarette smoking may be a significant risk factor associated with NAFLD onset in nondrinkers. These results may help clinicians to identify patients who are at a high risk of developing NAFLD and to prevent the progression of NAFLD by promoting earlier interventions that help people discontinue unhealthy lifestyle habits."
https://openalex.org/W2799935755,"Induction of selective thrombosis and infarction in tumor-feeding vessels represents an attractive strategy to combat cancer. Here we took advantage of the unique coagulation properties of staphylocoagulase and genetically engineered it to generate a new fusion protein with novel anti-cancer properties. This novel bi-functional protein consists of truncated coagulase (tCoa) and an NGR (GNGRAHA) motif that recognizes CD13 and Î±vÎ²3 integrin receptors, targeting it to tumor endothelial cells. Herein, we report that tCoa coupled by its C-terminus to an NGR sequence retained its normal binding activity with prothrombin and avÎ²3 integrins, as confirmed in silico and in vitro. Moreover, in vivo biodistribution studies demonstrated selective accumulation of FITC-labeled tCoa-NGR fusion proteins at the site of subcutaneously implanted PC3 tumor xenografts in nude mice. Notably, systemic administration of tCoa-NGR to mice bearing 4T1 mouse mammary xenografts or PC3 human prostate tumors resulted in a significant reduction in tumor growth. These anti-tumor effects were accompanied by massive thrombotic occlusion of small and large tumor vessels, tumor infarction and tumor cell death. From these findings, we propose tCoa-NGR mediated tumor infarction as a novel and promising anti-cancer strategy targeting both CD13 and integrin Î±vÎ²3 positive tumor neovasculature."
https://openalex.org/W2799847583,"Mutations in PITX2 have been implicated in several genetic disorders, particularly Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome. In order to determine the most reliable bioinformatics tools to assess the likely pathogenicity of PITX2 variants, the results of bioinformatics predictions were compared to the impact of variants on PITX2 structure and function. The MutPred, Provean, and PMUT bioinformatic tools were found to have the highest performance in predicting the pathogenicity effects of all 18 characterized missense variants in PITX2, all with sensitivity and specificity >93%. Applying these three programs to assess the likely pathogenicity of 13 previously uncharacterized PITX2 missense variants predicted 12/13 variants as deleterious, except A30V which was predicted as benign variant for all programs. Molecular modeling of the PITX2 homoedomain predicts that of the 31 known PITX2 variants, L54Q, F58L, V83F, V83L, W86C, W86S, and R91P alter PITX2âs structure. In contrast, the remaining 24 variants are not predicted to change PITX2âs structure. The results of molecular modeling, performed on all the PITX2 missense mutations located in the homeodomain, were compared with the findings of eight protein stability programs. CUPSAT was found to be the most reliable in predicting the effect of missense mutations on PITX2 stability. Our results showed that for PITX2, and likely other members of this homeodomain transcription factor family, MutPred, Provean, PMUT, molecular modeling, and CUPSAT can reliably be used to predict PITX2 missense variants pathogenicity."
https://openalex.org/W2803030655,"A growing body of evidence shows that the development and progression of gastric cancer (GC) is mainly associated to the presence of gastric cancer stem-like cells (GCSLCs). However, it is unclear how GCSLC population is maintained. This study aimed to explore the role of capillary morphogenesis gene 2 (CMG2) in GCSLC maintenance and the relevance to GC progression. We found that CMG2 was highly expressed in GC tissues and the expression levels were associated with the invasion depth and lymph node metastasis of GC, and inversely correlated with the survival of GC patients. Sorted CMG2High GC cells preferentially clustered in CD44High stem-like cell population, which expressed high levels of stemness-related genes with increased capabilities of self-renewal and tumorigenicity. Depletion of CMG2 gene resulted in reduction of GCSLC population with attenuated stemness and decrease of invasive and metastatic capabilities with subdued epithelialâmesenchymal transition phenotype in GC cells. Mechanistically, CMG2 interacted with LRP6 in GCSLCs to activate a Wnt/Î²-catenin pathway. Thus, our results demonstrate that CMG2 promotes GC progression by maintaining GCSLCs and can serve as a new prognostic indicator and a target for human GC therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2800075939,"Hedgehog (Hh) pathway plays a pivotal role in diverse aspects of development and postnatal physiology. Perturbation of Hh signaling and activation of GLI1 (glioma-associated oncogene 1), a dedicated transcription factor for Hh pathway, are highly associated with several cancers, such as medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma. Dynamic and precise control of GLI1 activity is thus important to ensure proper homeostasis and tumorigenesis. Here we show that MEKK2 (MAP3K2) and MEKK3 (MAP3K3) inhibit GLI1 transcriptional activity and oncogenic function through phosphorylation on multiple Ser/Thr sites of GLI1, which reduces GLI1 protein stability, DNA-binding ability, and increases the association of GLI1 with SUFU. Interestingly, MEKK2 and MEKK3 are responsible for FGF2-mediated inhibition on Hh signaling. Moreover, expression of MEKK2 and MEKK3 inhibits medulloblastoma cell proliferation and negatively correlates with Hh pathway activity in medulloblastoma clinical samples. Together, these findings reveal a novel noncanonical GLI1 regulation and provide a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of cancers with aberrant Hh pathway activation, such as medulloblastoma."
https://openalex.org/W2800755480,"Antineoplastic platinum agents are used in first-line treatment of ovarian cancer, but treatment failure frequently results from platinum drug resistance. Emerging observations suggest a role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the resistance of cancer drugs including platinum drugs. However, the molecular link between ROS and cellular survival pathway is poorly understood. Using quantitative high-throughput combinational screen (qHTCS) and genomic sequencing, we show that in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer elevated ROS levels sustain high level of IL-11 by stimulating FRA1-mediated IL-11 expression and increased IL-11 causes resistance to platinum drugs by constitutively activating JAK2âSTAT5 via an autocrine mechanism. Inhibition of JAK2 by LY2784544 or IL-11 by anti-IL-11 antibody overcomes the platinum resistance in vitro or in vivo. Significantly, clinic studies also confirm the activated IL-11âJAK2 pathway in platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients, which highly correlates with poor prognosis. These findings not only identify a novel ROSâIL-11âJAK2-mediated platinum resistance mechanism but also provide a new strategy for using LY2784544- or IL-11-mediated immunotherapy to treat platinum-resistant ovarian cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2801797875,"Bacterial infectious diseases produced by Vibrio are the main cause of economic losses in aquaculture. During recent years it has been shown that the expression of virulence genes in some Vibrio species is controlled by a population-density dependent gene-expression mechanism known as quorum sensing (QS), which is mediated by the diffusion of signal molecules such as N-acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs). QS disruption, especially the enzymatic degradation of signalling molecules, known as quorum quenching (QQ), is one of the novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of bacterial infections. In this study, we present the detection of AHLs in 34 marine Vibrionaceae strains. Three aquaculture-related pathogenic Vibrio strains, V. mediterranei VibC-Oc-097, V. owensii VibC-Oc-106 and V. coralliilyticus VibC-Oc-193 were selected for further studies based on their virulence and high production of AHLs. This is the first report where the signal molecules have been characterized in these emerging marine pathogens and correlated to the expression of virulence factors. Moreover, the results of AHL inactivation in the three selected strains have been confirmed in vivo against brine shrimps (Artemia salina) and Manila clams (Venerupis philippinarum). This research contributes to the development of future therapies based on AHL disruption, the most promising alternatives for fighting infectious diseases in aquaculture."
https://openalex.org/W2796520534,"Human papillomavirus (HPV)-driven cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) is the most common cancer in immunosuppressed patients. Despite indications suggesting that HPV promotes genomic instability during cSCC development, the molecular pathways underpinning HPV-driven cSCC development remain unknown. We compared the transcriptome of HPV-driven mouse cSCC with normal skin and observed higher amounts of transcripts for Porcupine and WNT ligands in cSCC, suggesting a role for WNT signaling in cSCC progression. We confirmed increased Porcupine expression in human cSCC samples. Blocking the secretion of WNT ligands by the Porcupine inhibitor LGK974 significantly diminished initiation and progression of HPV-driven cSCC. Administration of LGK974 to mice with established cSCC resulted in differentiation of cancer cells and significant reduction of the cancer stem cell compartment. Thus, WNT/Î²-catenin signaling is essential for HPV-driven cSCC initiation and progression as well as for maintaining the cancer stem cell niche. Interference with WNT secretion may thus represent a promising approach for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2798153493,"Despite advances in the field, colorectal cancer (CRC) remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Research into bioactive sphingolipids over the past two decades has played an important role in increasing our understanding of the pathogenesis and therapeutics of CRC. In the complex metabolic network of sphingolipids, ceramidases (CDases) have a key function. These enzymes hydrolyze ceramides into sphingosine (SPH) which in turn is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinases (SK) 1 and 2 to generate sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P). Importantly, we have recently shown that inhibition of neutral CDase (nCDase) induces an increase of ceramide in colon cancer cells which decreases cellular growth, increases apoptosis and modulates the WNT/Î²-catenin pathway. We have also shown that the deletion of nCDase protected mice from the onset and progression of colorectal cancer in the AOM carcinogen model. Here, we demonstrate that AKT is a key target for the growth suppressing functions of ceramide. The results show that inhibition of nCDase activates GSK3Î² through dephosphorylation, and thus is required for the subsequent phosphorylation and degradation of Î²-catenin. Our findings show that inhibition of nCDase also inhibits the basal activation status of AKT, and we further establish that a constitutively active AKT (AKT T308D, S473D; AKTDD) reverses the effect of nCDase on Î²-catenin degradation. Functionally, the AKTDD mutant is able to overcome the growth suppressive effects of nCDase inhibition in CRC cells. Moreover, nCDase inhibition induces a growth delay of xenograft tumors from control cells, whereas xenograft tumors from constitutively active AKT cells become resistant to nCDase inhibition. Taken together, these results provide important mechanistic insight into how nCDase regulates cell proliferation. These findings demonstrate a heretofore unappreciated, but critical, role for nCDase in enabling/maintaining basal activation of AKT and also suggest that nCDase is a suitable novel target for colon cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2800222243,"Patients on dialysis are often elderly and frail, with multiple comorbid conditions, and are heavy users of Emergency Department (ED) services. However, objective data on the frequency and pattern of ED utilization by dialysis patients are sparse. Such data could identify periods of highest risk for ED visits and inform health systems interventions to mitigate these risks and improve outcomes.To describe the pattern and frequency of presentation to ER by dialysis patients.Retrospective cohort study using administrative data collected over ten years (2000-2009) in the Province of Manitoba, Canada.Patients presenting to any of 9 ED's in Winnipeg and Brandon Manitoba. These departments serve >90% of the population of Manitoba, Canada (population 1.2 million).All patients presenting to an ED in any of 9 emergency departments in Manitoba, Canada.Dialysis status.Presentation to the ED.Over 2.1 million ED visits by more than 1.2 million non-dialysis patients and 17,782 ED visits by 3257 dialysis patients were included. Dialysis patients presented 8.5 times more frequently to the ED than the general population (age and sex adjusted, p<0.001). For dialysis patients, ED utilization was significantly higher following the long interdialytic interval (33.6% higher Mondays and 19.5% higher Tuesdays vs. other days of the week, p<0.001) and was 10-fold higher in the 7 days before and after the initiation of dialysis.The heavy use of ED services by dialysis patients spikes upward following the long interdialytic interval and also in the week before and after dialysis initiation. The relative risks associated with these vulnerable periods were much higher than those reported for clinical patient characteristics. We propose that intrinsic gaps in the structure of care delivery (e.g. 3 times a week dialysis, imperfect surveillance and clinical monitoring of patients with low GFR) may be the fundamental drivers of this periodicity. Strategies to mitigate this excess health risk are needed."

https://openalex.org/W2797194783,"RNA interference (RNAi) is a major, powerful platform for gene perturbations, but is restricted by off-target mechanisms. Communication between RNAs, small RNAs, and RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) is a pervasive feature of cellular RNA networks. We present a crosstalk scenario, designated as âcrosstalk with endogenous RBPsâ (ceRBP), in which small interfering RNAs or microRNAs with seed sequences that overlap RBP motifs have extended biological effects by perturbing endogenous RBP activity. Systematic analysis of small interfering RNA (siRNA) off-target data and genome-wide RNAi cancer lethality screens using 501 human cancer cell lines, a cancer dependency map, identified that seed-to-RBP crosstalk is widespread, contributes to off-target activity, and affects RNAi performance. Specifically, deconvolution of the interactions between gene knockdown and seed-mediated silencing effects in the cancer dependency map showed widespread contributions of seed-to-RBP crosstalk to growth-phenotype modulation. These findings suggest a novel aspect of microRNA biology and offer a basis for improvement of RNAi agents and RNAi-based functional genomics. This study presents evidence that siRNAs or miRNAs with seed sequences that overlap RBP motifs have extended biological effects by perturbing RBP activity. Seed-to-RBP crosstalk contributes to off-target activity and growth phenotype modulation."

The objective of this study was to identify predictors (independent variables) of visual outcomes, and to define their relationship with neurological disability and retinal atrophy when assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). We performed a cross-sectional analysis of 119 consecutive patients with MS, assessing vision using high contrast visual acuity (LogMar), 2.5% and 1.25% low contrast visual acuity (Sloan charts), and color vision (Hardy-Rand-Rittler plates). Quality of vision is a patient reported outcome based on an individual's unique perception of his or her vision and was assessed with the Visual Functioning Questionnaire-25 (VFQ-25) with the 10 neuro-ophthalmologic items. MS disability was assessed using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), the MS functional composite (MSFC) and the brief repetitive battery-neuropsychology (BRB-N). Retinal atrophy was assessed using spectral domain OCT, measuring the thickness of the peripapillar retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) and the volume of the ganglion cell plus inner plexiform layer (GCIPL). The vision of patients with MS was impaired, particularly in eyes with prior optic neuritis. Retinal atrophy (pRNFL and GCIPL) was closely associated with impaired low contrast vision and color vision, whereas the volume of the GCIPL showed a trend (p = 0.092) to be associated with quality of vision. Multiple regression analysis revealed that EDSS was an explanatory variable for high contrast vision after stepwise analysis, GCIPL volume for low contrast vision, and GCIPL volume and EDSS for color vision. The explanatory variables for quality of vision were high contrast vision and color vision. In summary, quality of vision in MS depends on the impairment of high contrast visual acuity and color vision due to the disease."

https://openalex.org/W2797018392,"Gyrase is an essential bacterial molecular motor that supercoils DNA using a conformational cycle in which chiral wrapping of > 100 base pairs confers directionality on topoisomerization. To understand the mechanism of this nucleoprotein machine, global structural transitions must be mapped onto the nucleotide cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis and product release. Here we investigate coupling mechanisms using single-molecule tracking of DNA rotation and contraction during Escherichia coli gyrase activity under varying nucleotide conditions. We find that ADP must be exchanged for ATP to drive the rate-limiting remodeling transition that generates the chiral wrap. ATP hydrolysis accelerates subsequent duplex strand passage and is required for resetting the enzyme and recapturing transiently released DNA. Our measurements suggest how gyrase coordinates DNA rearrangements with the dynamics of its ATP-driven protein gate, how the motor minimizes futile cycles of ATP hydrolysis and how gyrase may respond to changing cellular energy levels to link gene expression with metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2801609070,"Undigestible food ingredients are converted by the microbiota into a large range of metabolites, predominated by short chain fatty acids (SCFA). These microbial metabolites are subsequently available for absorption by the host mucosa and can serve as an energy source. Amino acids fermentation by the microbiota expands the spectrum of fermentation end-products beyond acetate, propionate and butyrate, to include in particular branched-SCFA. Here the long-term effects of high protein-diets on microbial community composition and functionality in mice were analyzed. Determinations of the microbiota composition using phylogenetic microarray (MITChip) technology were complemented with metatranscriptome and SCFA analyses to obtain insight in in situ expression of protein fermentation pathways and the phylogenetic groups involved. High protein diets led to increased luminal concentrations of branched-SCFA, in accordance with protein fermentation in the gut. Bacteria dominantly participating in protein catabolism belonged to the Lachnospiraceae, Erysipelotrichaceae and Clostridiaceae families in both normal- and high- protein diet regimes. This study identifies the microbial groups involved in protein catabolism in the intestine and underpins the value of in situ metatranscriptome analyses as an approach to decipher locally active metabolic networks and pathways as a function of the dietary regime, as well as the phylogeny of the microorganisms executing them."
https://openalex.org/W2802700555,"Pyrexia of unknown origin (PUO) is defined as a temperature of >38.3Â°C that lasts for >3 weeks, where no cause can be found despite appropriate investigation. Existing protocols for the work-up of PUO can be extensive and costly, motivating the application of recent advances in molecular diagnostics to pathogen testing. There have been many reports describing various analytical methods and performance of metagenomic pathogen testing in clinical samples but the economics of it has been less well studied. This study pragmatically evaluates the feasibility of introducing metagenomic testing in this setting by assessing the relative cost of clinically-relevant strategies employing this investigative tool under various cost and performance scenarios using Singapore as a demonstration case, and assessing the price and performance benchmarks, which would need to be achieved for metagenomic testing to be potentially considered financially viable relative to the current diagnostic standard. This study has some important limitations: we examined only impact of introducing the metagenomic test to the overall diagnostic cost and excluded costs associated with hospitalization and makes assumptions about the performance of the routine diagnostic tests, limiting the cost of metagenomic test, and the lack of further work-up after positive pathogen detection by the metagenomic test. However, these assumptions were necessary to keep the model within reasonable limits. In spite of these, the simplified presentation lends itself to the illustration of the key insights of our paper. In general, we find the use of metagenomic testing as second-line investigation is effectively dominated, and that use of metagenomic testing at first-line would typically require higher rates of detection or lower cost than currently available in order to be justifiable purely as a cost-saving measure. We conclude that current conditions do not warrant a widespread rush to deploy metagenomic testing to resolve any and all uncertainty, but rather as a front-line technology that should be used in specific contexts, as a supplement to rather than a replacement for careful clinical judgement."
https://openalex.org/W2801711119,"Erythritol, a non-nutritive polyol, is the main component of the artificial sweetener TruviaÂ®. Recent research has indicated that erythritol may have potential as an organic insecticide, given its harmful effects on several insects but apparent safety for mammals. However, for erythritol to have practical use as an insecticide in agricultural settings, it must have neutral to positive effects on crop plants and other non-target organisms. We examined the dose-dependent effects of erythritol (0, 5, 50, 500, 1000, and 2000 mM) on corn (Zea mays) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) seedling growth and seed germination. Erythritol caused significant reductions in both belowground (root) and aboveground (shoot) dry weight at and above the typical minimum insecticidal dose (500 mM erythritol) in tomato plants, but not in corn plants. Both corn and tomato seed germination was inhibited by erythritol but the tomato seeds appeared to be more sensitive, responding at concentrations as low as 50 mM erythritol (in contrast to a minimum damaging dose of 1000 mM erythritol for corn seeds). Our results suggest erythritol may have damaging non-target effects on certain plant crops when used daily at the typical doses needed to kill insect pests. Furthermore, if erythritol's damaging effects extend to certain weed species, it also may have potential as an organic herbicide."

However, it is still unclear the HPV-relatedness definition with best diagnostic accuracy and prognostic value.The aim of this study was to compare different staging system models proposed for HPV-related OPC patients: 7th edition AJCC TNM, RPA stage with non-anatomic factors (Princess Margaret), RPA with N categories for nasopharyngeal cancer (MD-Anderson) and AHR-new (ICON-S), according to different HPV-relatedness definitions: HPV-DNA detection plus an additional positive marker (p16INK4a or HPV-mRNA), p16INK4a positivity alone or the combination of HPV-DNA/p16INK4a positivity as diagnostic tests.A total of 788 consecutive OPC cases diagnosed from 1991 to 2013 were considered eligible for the analysis. Of these samples, 66 (8.4%) were positive for HPV-DNA and (p16INK4a or HPV-mRNA), 83 (10.5%) were p16INK4a positive and 58 (7.4%) were double positive for HPV-DNA/p16INK4a. ICON-S model was the staging system, which performed better in our series when using at least two biomarkers to define HPV-causality. When the same analysis was performed considering only p16INK4a-positivity, RPA stage with non-anatomic factors (Princess Margaret) has the best classification based on AIC criteria.HPV-relatedness definition for classifying HPV-related OPC patient do impact on TNM classification and patients' survival. Further studies assessing HPV-relatedness definitions are warranted to better classify HPV-related OPC patients in the era of de-escalation clinical trials."
https://openalex.org/W2801312297,"Central-venous oxygen saturation (ScvO2) is a key parameter of hemodynamic monitoring and has been suggested as therapeutic goal for resuscitation. Several devices offer continuous monitoring features. The CeVOX-device (Pulsion Medical Systems) uses a fibre-optic probe inserted through a conventional central-venous catheter (CVC) to obtain continuous ScvO2.Since there is a lack of studies validating the CeVOX, we prospectively analyzed data from 24 patients with CeVOX-monitoring. To increase the yield of lower ScvO2-values, 12 patients were equipped with a femoral CVC.During the 8h study period ScvO2_CeVOX was documented immediately before withdrawal of blood to measure ScvO2 by blood gas analysis (ScvO2_BGA) 6min, 1h, 4h, 5h and 8h after the initial calibration. No further calibrations were performed.In patients with jugular CVC (primary endpoint; 60 measurements), bias, lower and upper limits of agreement (LLOA; ULOA) and percentage error (PE) of the estimate of ScvO2 (ScvO2_CeVOX_jug) were acceptable with 0.45%, -13.0%, 13.9% and 16.6%, respectively. As supposed, ScvO2 was lower in the femoral compared to the jugular measurements (69.5Â±10.7 vs. 79.4Â±5.8%; p<0.001). While the bias (0.64%) was still acceptable, LLOA (-23.8%), ULOA (25.0%) and PE (34.5%) were substantially higher for femoral assessment of ScvO2 by the CeVOX (ScvO2_CeVOX_fem). Analysis of the entire data-pool with jugular as well as femoral CVCs allowed for a multivariate analysis which demonstrated that the position of the CVC per se was not independently associated with the bias ScvO2_CeVOX-ScvO2_BGA. The amount of the bias |ScvO2_CeVOX-ScvO2_BGA| was independently associated with the amount of the change of ScvO2_CeVOX compared to the initial calibration to ScvO2_BGA_baseline (|ScvO2_CeVOX-ScvO2_BGA_baseline|) as well as with low values of ScvO2_BGA_baseline. Furthermore, increasing time to the initial calibration was associated to the amount of the bias with borderline significance. A statistical model based on |ScvO2_CeVOX-ScvO2_BGA_baseline| and ""time to last calibration"" derived from an evaluation dataset (80 of 120 datasets, 16 of 24) provided a ROC-AUC of 0.903 to predict an amount of the bias |ScvO2_CeVOX-ScvO2_BGA| â¥5% in an independent validation group (40 datasets of 8 patients).These findings suggest that the CeVOX device is capable to detect stability or instability of ScvO2_BGA. ScvO2_CeVOX accurately estimates ScvO2_BGA in case of stable values. However, intermittent measurement of ScvO2_BGA and re-calibration should be performed in case of substantial changes in ScvO2_CeVOX compared to baseline. Therefore, continuous measurement of ScvO2 with the CeVOX cannot replace ScvO2_BGA in instable patients. On the other hand, CeVOX might be useful for the monitoring of stable patients as a pre-test tool for more differentiated monitoring in case of changes in ScvO2_CeVOX."
https://openalex.org/W2801608667,"The usual cultivation mode of the green microalga Chlamydomonas is liquid medium and light. However, the microalga can also be grown on agar plates and in darkness. Our aim is to analyze and compare gene expression of cells cultivated in these different conditions. For that purpose, RNA-seq data are obtained from Chlamydomonas samples of two different labs grown in four environmental conditions (agar@light, agar@dark, liquid@light, liquid@dark). The RNA seq data are analyzed by surprisal analysis, which allows the simultaneous meta-analysis of all the samples. First we identify a balance state, which defines a state where the expression levels are similar in all the samples irrespectively of their growth conditions, or lab origin. In addition our analysis identifies additional constraints needed to quantify the deviation with respect to the balance state. The first constraint differentiates the agar samples versus the liquid ones; the second constraint the dark samples versus the light ones. The two constraints are almost of equal importance. Pathways involved in stress responses are found in the agar phenotype while the liquid phenotype comprises ATP and NADH production pathways. Remodeling of membrane is suggested in the dark phenotype while photosynthetic pathways characterize the light phenotype. The same trends are also present when performing purely statistical analysis such as K-means clustering and differentially expressed genes."

We interviewed 333 incident T1D cases and 660 controls from 2008-2011 in Melbourne, Australia. Enteroviral indices (ribonucleic acid by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and Coxsackie B virus antibody levels) in peripheral blood were measured in nested case control samples. Parent occupational social contact was assessed by the number of well or sick children, adults or animals contacted daily through work. Higher parental occupational social contact was strongly associated with reduced T1D risk with evidence of dose response (contact with the well or sick score, Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) per category: 0.73 (95% Confidence Interval (CI): 0.66, 0.81); P<0.001 or AOR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.75); P<0.001) respectively). Nine of the ten parental social contact indices, were significant mediated through one or more enteroviral indices. The strength of association between enterovirus presence and T1D onset increased with child age (1.2 fold increase per year; P = 0.05). Lower child hand hygiene enhanced the adverse effect of low parental occupational contact with the sick; Synergy Index 5.16 (95% CI: 3.61, 7.36). The interaction between hand washing and parental occupational contact is more consistent with protection against parental enteroviral shedding than the sharing of a protective infectious agent or microbiome."

For each age group, the chest CT scans were divided into two subgroups. A cut-off value used was the 75th percentile of size-specific dose estimates (SSDE), age-specific diagnostic reference level (DRL): less than the 75th percentile of SSDE (Group A, n = 238) and greater than the 75th percentile of SSDE (Group B, n = 77). All CT scans were performed with the same protocol using automatic tube voltage selection and current modulation techniques. The morphologic factors of the patients including body mass index (BMI), arm angles, presence of medical devices in the scan field, and degree of off-centering within the CT gantry were compared between groups A and B.Group B showed narrower arm angles on scout and coronal reformatted images, higher frequency of the presence of devices and higher BMI than group A (P < 0.001, P < 0.001; P = 0.018, and P < 0.001, respectively). In multivariate analysis, narrower arm angles, the presence of devices on the scout images and higher BMI were independently associated with higher SSDE (P = 0.001, P = 0.037, and P < 0.001, respectively).During acquisition of the scout images, arms-down position and the presence of medical devices were associated with a high radiation dose above age-specific DRLs in pediatric chest CT, regardless of repositioning before the actual scanning.

https://openalex.org/W2801509307,"The International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Children (ISAAC) Wheezing Module is commonly used to characterize pediatric asthma in epidemiological studies, including nearly all airway cohorts participating in the Environmental Influences on Child Health Outcomes (ECHO) consortium. However, there is no consensus model for operationalizing wheezing severity with this instrument in explanatory research studies. Severity is typically measured using coarsely-defined categorical variables, reducing power and potentially underestimating etiological associations. More precise measurement approaches could improve testing of etiological theories of wheezing illness.We evaluated a continuous latent variable model of pediatric wheezing severity based on four ISAAC Wheezing Module items. Analyses included subgroups of children from three independent cohorts whose parents reported past wheezing: infants ages 0-2 in the INSPIRE birth cohort study (Cohort 1; n = 657), 6-7-year-old North American children from Phase One of the ISAAC study (Cohort 2; n = 2,765), and 5-6-year-old children in the EHAAS birth cohort study (Cohort 3; n = 102). Models were estimated using structural equation modeling.In all cohorts, covariance patterns implied by the latent variable model were consistent with the observed data, as indicated by non-significant Ï2 goodness of fit tests (no evidence of model misspecification). Cohort 1 analyses showed that the latent factor structure was stable across time points and child sexes. In both cohorts 1 and 3, the latent wheezing severity variable was prospectively associated with wheeze-related clinical outcomes, including physician asthma diagnosis, acute corticosteroid use, and wheeze-related outpatient medical visits when adjusting for confounders.We developed an easily applicable continuous latent variable model of pediatric wheezing severity based on items from the well-validated ISAAC Wheezing Module. This model prospectively associates with asthma morbidity, as demonstrated in two ECHO birth cohort studies, and provides a more statistically powerful method of testing etiologic hypotheses of childhood wheezing illness and asthma."
