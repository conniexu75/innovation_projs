Membranes from mice that had been subjected to long-term ethanol treatment were relatively resistant to this fluidizing effect. The data suggest that the membranes themselves had adapted to the drug, a novel form of drug tolerance."

https://openalex.org/W1987834587,"Guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) metabolism in developing eye rudiments of Xenopus laevis embryos in culture is disrupted by the phosphodiesterase inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine. At low concentrations of inhibitor the rudiments develop normally, but at higher concentrations of the inhibitor, cyclic GMP accumulates in the rudiments and the retinal photoreceptor cells degenerate selectively. The isobutylmethylxanthine-induced photoreceptor degeneration is associated with an accumulation of cyclic GMP and, in this respect, it stimulates an early biochemical defect in the inherited degenerative disease of rd mice."
https://openalex.org/W1577885145,"Murine 3T3-L1 fibroblasts enter a differentiation program subsequent to prolonged maintenance in the confluent state and develop into adipocytes. The hormone sensitivity of adenylate cyclase and the physiological responsiveness to insulin were compared in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and adipocytes. The following observations, comprising several distinct categories of hormone responsiveness, were made. (a) (2.5 micronM) isoproterenol stimulated adenylate cyclase 15-fold in adipocyte homogenates, but only 2.5-fold in preadipocyte preparations, suggesting a considerable magnification in beta-adrenergic responsiveness during development. (b) A totally new control element, adrenocorticotropic hormone responsiveness, was incorporated into the adenylate cyclase system of the adipocytes. (c) Sensitivity to prostaglandin E1 was observed in both preadipocytes and adipocytes, but no change in responsiveness could be detected in the differentiated cells. (d) Glucagon-sensitive adenylate cyclase could not be detected in either preadipocytes or adipocytes. (e) Both preadipocytes and adipocytes possess considerable insulin binding activity, but near physiological levels of insulin stimulate the conversion of glucose to CO2 and lipid only in the differentiated cells."

https://openalex.org/W1976717199,"The discharge correlates of pontine reticular formation units were investigated in unrestrained cats. In agreement with previous investigations using immobilized preparations, we found that these cells had high rates of activity in rapid eye movement sleep, and responded in waking to somatic, auditory, and vestibular stimuli at short latencies, many having polysensory responses and exhibiting rapid ""habituation."" However, despite the sensory responses of these cells, most unit activity could not be explained by the presence of sensory stimuli. Intense firing occurred in association with specific movements. Units deprived of their adequate somatic, vestibular, and auditory stimuli showed undiminished discharge rates during motor activity. Discrete sensory stimuli evoked sustained unit firing only when they also evoked a motor response. We conclude that activity in pontine reticular formation neurons is more closely related to motor output than to sensory input."

The kinase activity was purified approximately 6000-fold with an overall recovery of approximately 20%. The product isolated by affinity chromatography contained both cGMP-binding and cGMP-dependent histone kinase activity, indicating that the enzyme was not dissociated into regulatory and catalytic components by the immobilized cGMP derivative. The enzyme had a molecular weight of approximately 165,000 and a sedimentation coefficient of 7.8 S. The purified kinase displayed several characteristics similar to that of the partially purified enzyme including specificity for cGMP and stimulation by high concentrations of magnesium. On sodium dodecyl sulfate gels, only one major polypeptide chain was present having a molecular weight of approximately 81,000. This subunit bound 1 mol of cGMP and exhibited cGMP-dependent protein kinase activity. It is proposed that the native enzyme consists of two identical subunits (Mr=81,000), each of which binds cGMP and catalyzes protein phosphorylation."

The medium was then replaced by serum-free medium supplemented with heparin. Both cell cultures secreted collagenase, and this activity was inhibited by a cartilage-derived protein of low molecular weight. Since cartilage is rarely invaded by neoplasms, the presence of this inhibitor may play an important role in the regulation of tumor invasion."
https://openalex.org/W2023634197,"Electrical stimuli were applied to the angular bundle of the freely moving rat, and the neuronal responses were recorded ipsilaterally in the dentate gyrus and the CA1 field of the hippocampus. The number of neurons responding monosynaptically in the dentate gyrus was relatively small when the animal was alert and not moving but was much greater both during slow-wave sleep and during rapid eye movement sleep. In Ca1, however, the trisynaptic population response was considerably smaller during rapid eye movement sleep and when the animal was alert than during slow-wave sleep. These findings are interpreted in terms of a set of behaviorally dependent ""neural gates"". Measurement of the synaptic current at the dentate gyrus induced monosynaptically by stimulation of the angular bundle further suggests that the mechanism by which gating occurs at this level is either a tonic inhibitory synaptic influence exerted upon the granule cells during the alert state, a tonic excitatory influence during slow-wave sleep, or both."

https://openalex.org/W1512258142,"Canine HDL1 and canine and swine HDLc were fractionated into several lipoprotein subpopulations by heparin/manganese precipitation. The ability of the various subfractions of HDL1 or HDLc to compete with 125I-labeled low density lipoproteins (LDL) for binding and degradation by human fibroblasts was compared. The HDL1 or HDLc which precipitated at the lowest concentration of heparin (a concentration which precipitates LDL) were the most effective in competing with 125I-LDL for binding, internalization, and degradation. A striking characteristic of these lipoproteins was the occurrence of a prominence of the arginine-rich apoprotein. The HDL1 or HDLc subfractions which were not precipitated by heparin/managanese lacked detectable arginine-rich apoprotein and did not compete significantly with the 125I-LDL for binding and degradation. Furthermore, the lipid to protein ratio differed in the precipitable and nonprecipitable lipoproteins, with those which were most efficiently bound and degraded containing more cholesterol. Specific lipoprotein interaction with heparin and with the cell surface receptors may occur by a common mechanism; namely, through a positively charged region on the lipoprotein surface which may reside with the B and arginine-rich apoproteins."
https://openalex.org/W1558356706,"A crystal field analysis of EPR data for various low spin ferric cytochromes P-450 suggests that in all of them, regardless of source or method of induction, the heme ligands are a sulfur atom, presumably from cysteine, and an imidazole from histidine. The imidazole can be displaced in the ferric protein by cyanide, guanidine, or by an amine, analogous to its displacement by CO or NO in the ferrous protein. The resulting changes in the EPR parameters for the ferric protein are consistent with similar substitutions in heme thiol model compounds. The analysis of the latter can be understood on the basis of alterations of the electronic structure of the ligands to the heme iron."

https://openalex.org/W2018190671,"The human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 does not require estrogen for growth, but paradoxically its growth is inhibited by antiestrogens. Our results show that, unlike normal target cells, MCF-7 cells carry most of their estrogen receptors in their nuclei even when these receptors are not charged with estrogens. The receptors for androgen and for progesterone, on the other hand, are localized in the cytoplasm as usual. Therefore, it is possible that the growth of these abnormal cells is stimulated by estrogen receptor in spite of the absence of the hormone and that the binding of antiestrogen molecules antagonize this stimulation."
https://openalex.org/W1518014074,"A thermostable inhibition of ATP-protein phosphotransferase (EC 2.7.1.37) (protein kinase) which is present in crude tissue extracts has been resolved by gel chromatography (Sephadex G-100) into two molecular forms. These two forms will be referred to as type I and type II inhibitor. The type I inhibitor (Mr approximately or equal to 24,000) is specific for cAMP-dependent protein kinase and corresponds to the inhibitor described earlier (Walsh, D. A., Ashby, C. D., Gonzalez, C., Calkins, D., Fisher, E. H., and Krebs, E. G. (1971) J. Biol. Chem. 246, 1977-1985). The type II inhibitor (Mr approximately or equal to 15,000) competes for the enzyme with various substrate proteins (histone, alpha-casein, and Leu-Arg-Arg-Ala-Ser-Leu-Gly (kemptide). The type II inhibitor blocks protein phosphorylation catalyzed by several types of protein kinases (cAMP- and cGMP-dependent or cyclic nucleotide-independent protein kinases). The type II inhibitor from rat brain has been purified 1500-fold; this protein is thermostable, has acidic characteristics, and does not require Ca2+ ions for its activity. Different ratios and concentrations of type I and type II inhibitors of protein kinase are found in rat skeletal muscle, pancreas, cerebellum and corpus striatum, and in lobster tail muscle."

https://openalex.org/W1999970975,"Carbamylcholine (30 micronM) increased the concentration of guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) in guinea pig pancreatic lobules about eight-to tenfold over the basal concentration in 30 seconds with a concomitant increase in the rate of amylase secretion. The concentration of cyclic GMP rapidly declined to a plateau value of about 16 percent of the peak level in 10 minutes. Cellular cyclic GMP decreased, mostly because the nucleotide was secreted into medium; cellular adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP), however did not change, nor was this nucleotide secreted into the medium. An immunocytochemical technique showed that cyclic GMP was distributed in the apical plasmalemma membrane and lumen of the pancreas. Carbamylcholine increased the cyclic GMP fluorescence in tha apical plasmalemma membrane within 30 seconds, and in zymogen granules and the plasma membrane in the apical part of acinar cells in 10 minutes. The islets of Langerhans did not show any change in cyclic GMP. Fluorescence of cyclic AMP in pancreatic lobules was not altered by carbamylcholine and was localized along the apical portion of plasmalemma and cytoplasm. Cyclic GMP may thus participate either in the process of exocytosis or in the activation of enzymes secreted from the pancreas."

In experiments reported here, the amounts of cyclic AMP present in the anterior and posterior portions of pseudoplasmodia were measured using a protein binding assay, and the levels obtained normalized to protein and DNA. For a variety of pseudoplasmodia migration conditions examined, the anterior portion was found to contain cyclic AMP concentrations 40 to 70% higher than the posterior portions."
https://openalex.org/W1488158652,"Rat liver plasma membranes bind prostaglandins E1 and E2 (PGE) with high affinity and specificity. We have solubilized plasma membranes, prelabeled with radioactive PGE1, in water solutions of Triton X-100. We sedimented this material into sucrose density gradient containing H2O and D2O. From numerical integration of the sedimentation equation, taking explicitly into account the density and viscosity gradients present during the centrifugation, we have determined a value of s20,w = 5.6 to 5.7 X 10(-13) s and a partial specific volume, v = 0.80 to 0.81 cm3/g, for the PGE binding protein-Triton X-100 composed of 60% (w/w) protein and 40% (w/w) detergent. Gel filtration in water solutions of Triton X-100 gives a Stokes radius of 53 A for the complex. These data imply a molecular weight of 105,000 for the detergent-free binding protein and a frictional ratio of 1.3 for the complex. If the detergent is bound to the protein in a monolayer, about 40% of the PGE binding protein's surface would be covered with detergent. The procedures used in the analysis of the sedimentation behavior of the PGE binding protein-detergent complex, when coupled with a gel filtration measurement of the Stokes radius, allow valid determination of the size, shape, and extent of detergent binding of a wide variety of membrane proteins, even when they are present as minor components of complex mixtures."

https://openalex.org/W1968489845,"PREVIOUS studies from this laboratory have described the preparation, from HVJ virions solubilised with a non-ionic detergent, of a reassembled envelope fraction free of nucleocapsids. Such reconstituted envelopes still retain neuraminidase, haemagglutinating, cell fusion and haemolytic activities1–3. Since intact virions release their nucleoproteins into the cytoplasm after fusion with mammalian cells, it seemed possible that any given macromolecule contained within such a reassembled viral envelope might be introduced into susceptible mammalian cells by this means. We report here the successful application of this method to the introduction of CRM45, a non-toxic mutant protein related to diphtheria toxin4, into mouse L cells, a strain that is normally toxin resistant. Although CRM45 is a potent NAD : elongation factor 2-ADP ribosyl (NAD : EF2-ADPR) transferase5,6 and thus blocks protein synthesis in eukaryotic cell extracts, it is non-toxic for animal cells because it lacks a C-terminal sequence of amino acids necessary to bind to susceptible cell membranes and thus cannot reach the cell interior7. If a few molecules of CRM45 could be introduced into the living cell cytoplasm, they should block protein synthesis and kill the cells. This has now been accomplished by fusion of CRM45-containing reassembled HVJ envelopes with cultured mouse L cells."
https://openalex.org/W1539841211,"Rat parotid acinar cells dispersed by a combination of enzymatic treatments remain sensitive to adrenergic and cholinergic agonists. Previous studies have implicated Ca2+ in both adrenergic and cholinergic responses. This paper describes the effects of adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation upon 45Ca2+ fluxes in isolated parotid acinar cells. Suspensions of dispersed cells took up 45Ca2+ from the medium. The net rate of isotope influx was increased by the adrenergic agonists epinephrine, norepinephrine, isoproterenol, and phenylephrine, and by the cholinergic agonists acetylcholine and carbamylcholine. In 1 mM Ca2+, epinephrine was capable of increasing the 45Ca2+ influx in 40 min to three times that of resting cells. Isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist, was only half as effective as epinephrine in stimulating maximal calcium uptake although it was equally effective in stimulating maximal amylase release in the same cells. Experiments with the alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine, the beta-adrenergic antagonist propranolol, and the cholinergic antagonist atropine confirmed that alpha- and beta-adrenergic and cholinergic stimulation each had a direct stimulatory effect on 45Ca2+ uptake. N6,O2'-Dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate also caused some stimulation of net calcium uptake. Direct measurement of Ca2+ efflux indicated that the increased calcium uptake in the presence of epinephrine was not the indirect result of a decrease in efflux. The rates of both basal and epinephrine-stimulated calcium uptake increased with increasing calcium concentration in the medium. Epinephrine had little effect on the rate of calcium uptake at 0.15 mM Ca2+. Although the energy poison NaCN had little effect on the basal rate of calcium uptake, the stimulable component of calcium uptake was inhibited by NaCN at all calcium concentrations tested (0.2 to 4.1 mM)."

https://openalex.org/W1573311248,"The introduction of a new spin-labeled anionic ligand, 1-gamma-aminobutyrate-5-N-(1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-aminopiperidinyl)-2,4-dinitrobenzene, is reported. Under the experimental conditions, the first molar equivalent of this ligand is 93% bound to human serum albumin. With the addition of palmitate, the free spin label concentration decreases greatly, by almost 80%, in the presence of a fatty acid:albumin ratio of 3:1 to 4:1. The spectral characteristics of the bound spin label are also affected. The changes seen in the intensity of and the splitting between the high and low field extrema are indicative of perturbations of the protein molecule. It is seen then that the binding of each molar equivalent of fatty acid effects the conformation state of albumin and allosterically affects albumin binding properties. Computer spectral subtractions, furthermore, suggest that the binding of the first molar equivalent of palmitate specifically increases the affinity of the first two 1-gamma-amino-butyrate-5-N-(1-oxyl-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-4-aminopiperidinyl)-2,4-dinitrobenzene binding sites. The present results indicate that fluctuations in serum free fatty acid levels within the physiological range may have a major modulatory effect on the free serum levels of certain drugs and/or physiological substances that bind to albumin."
https://openalex.org/W1597074738,"Studies on the effect of a series of alpha, omega-diadenosine 5'-polyphosphate (ApnA; n = 2 to 6) on carbamyl phosphate synthetase showed that only Ap5A is an effective inhibitor. Ap5A also inhibits two partial reactions catalyzed by the enzyme: bicarbonate-dependent ATPase and ATP synthesis from carbamyl phosphate and ADP. The data indicate that Ap5A binds to the enzyme sites that interact with ATP. Of a variety of ATP-utilizing enzymes (kinases, hydrolases, synthetases), only adenylate kinase (Leinhard, G. E., and Secemski, I. I. (1973) J. Biol. Chem. 248, 1121--1123) and carbamyl phosphate synthetase are inhibited by Ap5A. The present findings provide strong evidence that carbamyl phosphate synthetase has two separate binding sites for ATP in which the gamma-phosphate moeities of ATP are bound in close proximity to the bicarbonate binding site of the enzyme."

https://openalex.org/W1533130784,"Arginine kinase (adenosine 5'-triphosphate: L-arginine phosphotransferase, EC 2.7.3.3) was purified from the larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta (L). This enzyme catalyzes the production of L-phosphoarginine, which is the principal reserve of high energy phosphate compounds in insect muscle. The enzyme also phosphorylates L-canavanine, a guanidinooxy analogue of arginine which severely disrupts all developmental stages of this insect. Evaluations of certain kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the reactions with arginine and canavanine suggest that reactions known to be much more sensitive to canavanine, such as protein synthesis or genome expression, rather than phosphagen formation and function account for the pronounced toxicity of canavanine in this insect. Sedimentation equilibrium and electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing sodium dodecyl sulfate indicate that this insect enzyme has a molecular weight of about 40,000. This value is consistent with molecular weights of arginine kinases of non-insect arthropods. Its amino acid composition is also very similar to that of other arthropod arginine kinases. Km values for the enzyme are: L-arginine, 0.5 mM; Mg-ATP, 2.5 mM; L-canavanine, 22 mM; L-phosphoarginine, 0.7 mM; Mg-ADP, 0.45 mM; and L-phosphocanavanine, 27 mM.

A monospecific antibody against homogeneously purified preparations of rat liver histidase has been elaborated in the goat. Employing this antibody in immunotitration experiments, it has been demonstrated that the elevations of hepatic histidase activity elicited by administration in vivo of estradiol-17beta, cortisol acetate, glucagon, and N6,O2'-dibutyryl adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (dibutyryl cAMP) are paralleled, in each instance, by equivalent increments in immunoprecipitable histidase protein. Following administration of each of the three hormones and dibutyryl cAMP, rates of [14C]leucine incorporation in vivo into rat liver histidase, isolated by immunoprecipitation, relative to incorporation rates into total soluble hepatic protein, increase in magnitudes which are comparable to increases in enzyme amount and catalytic activity. It is thus inferred that estrogen, glucocorticoids, and glucagon, via cAMP, each regulate rat liver histidase development at specific postnatal stages by inducing increases in histidase biosynthetic rates."
https://openalex.org/W1603465696,"We have determined the sequence of 59 base pairs in the DNA preceding the site for initiation of transcription in the galactose operon.

Analyses of RNA transcripts derived from this fragment and a variety of direct DNA sequence analyses allowed us to deduce the following sequence for the DNA in this fragment: (formula: see text) Position +1 corresponds to the site for initiation of gal mRNA synthesized in the presence of cyclic AMP and its receptor protein, CRP. Transcription experiments indicate, however, that this fragment lacks some element of the gal promoter required for the stimulation of transcription by CRP-cAMP. There are, nonetheless, some similarities between the gal sequence preceding the transcription start site and the sequences of other promoter regions.

Four moles of cofactor are bound/mol of tetrameric enzyme; the binding sites are equivalent and independent. The dissociation constants for NAD and NADH are 16 and 0.25 micronM, respectively. As measured by gel filtration in the absence of cofactor, 0.4 mol of estradiol-17 beta is bound/mol of tetrameric enzyme. Data obtained from isotope exchange at equilibrium indicate that the binding of the cofactor to the enzyme is favored over the binding of steroid, although each may bind in the absence of the other. The rates of cofactor dissociation from the ternary complexes are slower than the rates of steroid dissociation; cofactor dissociation is probably the rate-limiting step. Cofactor analogs modified in the pyridine moiety are cosubstrates, whereas modified adenine derivatives are not.

Although solubilization either by detergents or by chaotropic salts has been demonstrated with several membrane proteins, the effects these agents have on the properties and activity of an enzyme may be quite different. This is illustrated by the effects on mammalian mitochondrial dihydroorotate dehydrogenase. Stability of the solubilized enzymic activity is dependnet on the presence of a detergent and maximum enzymic activity is observed at the critical micelle concentration of the detergent. Addition of low concentrations of various anions of the chaotropic series further enhances activity while higher concentrations of these anions, although increasing solubility of the enzyme, irreversibly inhibit catalysis."
