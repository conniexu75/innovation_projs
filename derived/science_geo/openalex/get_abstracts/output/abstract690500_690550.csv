https://openalex.org/W4220702606,"Abstract Living bacteria therapies have been proposed as an alternative approach to treating a broad array of cancers. In this study, we developed a genetically encoded microbial encapsulation system with tunable and dynamic expression of surface capsular polysaccharides that enhances systemic delivery. Based on a small RNA screen of capsular biosynthesis pathways, we constructed inducible synthetic gene circuits that regulate bacterial encapsulation in Escherichia coli Nissle 1917. These bacteria are capable of temporarily evading immune attack, whereas subsequent loss of encapsulation results in effective clearance in vivo. This dynamic delivery strategy enabled a ten-fold increase in maximum tolerated dose of bacteria and improved anti-tumor efficacy in murine models of cancer. Furthermore, in situ encapsulation increased the fraction of microbial translocation among mouse tumors, leading to efficacy in distal tumors. The programmable encapsulation system promises to enhance the therapeutic utility of living engineered bacteria for cancer."

Waiting lists have long been associated with a variety of negative psychological responses, however there is little understanding behind young adults' personal experiences of such delays within mental health services. The current study aimed to explore young adults' experiences of waiting lists in mental healthcare in the UK. Seven young adults were interviewed in the current study (aged 19-22). Interpretive phenomenological analysis was utilised to explore participant accounts. Three super-ordinate themes were generated: Reliance on Alternative Methods of Support; Inability to Function Sufficiently; and Emergence of Negative Beliefs, Emotions and Thoughts. Participants primarily reported a variety of negative psychological and behavioural consequences associated with waiting lists in mental health services, as well as exacerbated existing physical and psychological health issues. In accordance with the limited number of previous studies, waiting lists are considered by patients to be barriers to mental health support and intervention. Future direction is advised."
https://openalex.org/W4220897394,"RNA-catalyzed RNA methylation was recently shown to be part of the catalytic repertoire of ribozymes. The methyltransferase ribozyme MTR1 catalyzes the site-specific synthesis of 1-methyladenosine (m1A) in RNA, using O6-methylguanine (m6G) as a methyl group donor. Here, we report the crystal structure of MTR1 at a resolution of 2.8 Å, which reveals a guanine-binding site reminiscent of natural guanine riboswitches. The structure represents the postcatalytic state of a split ribozyme in complex with the m1A-containing RNA product and the demethylated cofactor guanine. The structural data suggest the mechanistic involvement of a protonated cytidine in the methyl transfer reaction. A synergistic effect of two 2'-O-methylated ribose residues in the active site results in accelerated methyl group transfer. Supported by these results, it seems plausible that modified nucleotides may have enhanced early RNA catalysis and that metabolite-binding riboswitches may resemble inactivated ribozymes that have lost their catalytic activity during evolution."
https://openalex.org/W4220980488,"Known ribozymes in contemporary biology perform a limited range of chemical catalysis, but in vitro selection has generated species that catalyze a broader range of chemistry; yet, there have been few structural and mechanistic studies of selected ribozymes. A ribozyme has recently been selected that can catalyze a site-specific methyl transfer reaction. We have solved the crystal structure of this ribozyme at a resolution of 2.3 Å, showing how the RNA folds to generate a very specific binding site for the methyl donor substrate. The structure immediately suggests a catalytic mechanism involving a combination of proximity and orientation and nucleobase-mediated general acid catalysis. The mechanism is supported by the pH dependence of the rate of catalysis. A selected methyltransferase ribozyme can thus use a relatively sophisticated catalytic mechanism, broadening the range of known RNA-catalyzed chemistry."
https://openalex.org/W4220879808,"Background The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown pose a threat for adolescents’ mental health, especially for those with an earlier vulnerability. Accordingly, these adolescents may need increased support from family and friends. This study investigated whether family functioning and peer connectedness protects adolescents with earlier internalizing or externalizing symptoms from increased depressive symptoms during the first Dutch COVID-19 lockdown in a low-risk community sample. Methods This sample comprised 115 adolescents ( M ag e = 13.06; 44% girls) and their parents ( N = 111) and is part of an ongoing prospective study on child development. Internalizing and externalizing symptoms were self-reported a year before the COVID-19 lockdown. In an online survey during the first Dutch lockdown (April-May 2020), adolescents reported depressive symptoms and perceived peer connectedness, and parents reported family functioning. Results Twenty-four percent of adolescents reported clinically relevant symptoms of depression during the first COVID-19 lockdown. Depressive symptoms were significantly predicted by earlier internalizing, but not externalizing symptoms. Furthermore, higher quality of family functioning, but not peer connectedness, predicted fewer adolescent depressive symptoms. Family functioning and peer connectedness did not moderate the link between pre-existing internalizing symptoms and later depressive symptoms. Conclusions In a low-risk community sample, one-in-four adolescents reported clinically relevant depressive symptoms at the first COVID-19 lockdown. Higher earlier internalizing symptoms and lower quality of family functioning increased risks. These results indicate that even in low-risk samples, a substantial group of adolescents and their families are vulnerable during times of crisis."
https://openalex.org/W4220892730,"Anhydrobiosis is considered to be an adaptation of important applicative implications because it enables resistance to the lack of water. The phenomenon is still not well understood at molecular level. Thus, a good model invertebrate species for the research is required. The best known anhydrobiotic invertebrates are tardigrades (Tardigrada), considered to be toughest animals in the world. Hypsibius. exemplaris is one of the best studied tardigrade species, with its name ""exemplaris"" referring to the widespread use of the species as a laboratory model for various types of research. However, available data suggest that anhydrobiotic capability of the species may be overestimated. Therefore, we determined anhydrobiosis survival by Hys. exemplaris specimens using three different anhydrobiosis protocols. We also checked ultrastructure of storage cells within formed dormant structures (tuns) that has not been studied yet for Hys. exemplaris. These cells are known to support energetic requirements of anhydrobiosis. The obtained results indicate that Hys. exemplaris appears not to be a good model species for anhydrobiosis research."
https://openalex.org/W4220917701,"The bidirectional associations between negative self-conscious emotions such as shame and guilt and substance use are poorly understood. Longitudinal research is needed to examine the causes, consequences, and moderators of negative self-conscious emotions in people who use substances.Using parallel process latent growth curve modeling, we assessed bidirectional associations between shame and guilt and substance use (i.e., number of days in the past 30 used stimulants, alcohol to intoxication, other substances, or injected drugs) as well as the moderating role of positive emotion. Emotions were assessed using the Differential Emotions Scale. The sample included 110 sexual minority cisgender men with biologically confirmed recent methamphetamine use, enrolled in a randomized controlled trial in San Francisco, CA. Participants self-reported emotions and recent substance use behaviors over six time points across 15 months.Higher initial levels of shame were associated with slower decreases in stimulant use over time (b = 0.23, p = .041) and guilt was positively associated with stimulant use over time (β = 0.85, p < .0001). Initial levels of guilt and alcohol use were positively related (b = 0.29, p = .040), but over time, they had a negative relationship (β = -0.99, p < .0001). Additionally, higher initial levels of other drug use were associated with slower decreases in shame over time (b = 0.02, p = .041). All results were independent of depression, highlighting the specific role of self-conscious emotions.Shame and guilt are barriers to reducing stimulant use, and expanded efforts are needed to mitigate the deleterious effects of these self-conscious emotions in recovery from a stimulant use disorder."
https://openalex.org/W4221003105,"Curcumin is a polyphenol compound that alleviates several neuroinflammation-related diseases including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy and cerebral injury. However, the therapeutic efficacy of curcumin is limited by its poor physicochemical properties. The present study aimed to develop a new carrier-linked curcumin prodrug, curcumin diethyl γ-aminobutyrate (CUR-2GE), with improved physicochemical and anti-neuroinflammatory properties. CUR-2GE was designed and synthesized by conjugating curcumin with gamma-aminobutyric acid ethyl ester (GE) via a carbamate linkage. The carbamate linkage was selected to increase stability at acidic pH while GE served as a promoiety for lipophilic enhancement. The synthesized CUR-2GE was investigated for solubility, partition coefficient, stability, and bioconversion. The solubility of CUR-2GE was less than 0.05 μg/mL similar to that of curcumin, while the lipophilicity with log P of 3.57 was significantly increased. CUR-2GE was resistant to chemical hydrolysis at acidic pH (pH 1.2 and 4.5) as anticipated but rapidly hydrolyzed at pH 6.8 and 7.4. The incomplete hydrolysis of CUR-2GE was observed in simulated gastrointestinal fluids which liberated the intermediate curcumin monoethyl γ-aminobutyric acid (CUR-1GE) and the parent curcumin. In plasma, CUR-2GE was sequentially converted to CUR-1GE and curcumin within 1 h. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated BV-2 microglial cells, CUR-2GE effectively attenuated the pro-inflammatory mediators by decreasing the secretion of nitric oxide and cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6) to a greater extent than curcumin due to an increase in cellular uptake. Altogether, the newly developed acid-stable CUR-2GE prodrug is a potential pre-clinical and clinical candidate for further evaluation on neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects."
https://openalex.org/W4221132308,"Background Despite high exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis , a small proportion of South African goldminers resist TB infection. We determined, among long-service gold miners i) the proportion who were TB uninfected and ii) epidemiological factors associated with being uninfected. Methods We enrolled HIV-negative gold miners aged 33–60 years with ≥15 years’ service and no history of TB or silicosis. Miners were defined as TB uninfected if i) QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus (QFT-Plus) negative or ii) in a stricter definition, QFT-Plus-negative and zero-response on TST and as resisters if they were of Black/African ethnicity and negative on both tests. Logistic regression was used to identify epidemiological factors associated with being TB uninfected. Results Of 307 participants with a QFT-Plus result, median age was 48 years (interquartile range [IQR] 44–53), median time working underground was 24 years (IQR 18–28), 303 (99%) were male and 91 (30%) were QFT-Plus-negative. The odds of being TB uninfected was 52% lower for unskilled workers (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.27–0.85; p = 0.013). Among 281 participants of Black/African ethnicity, 71 (25%) were QFT-Plus negative. Miners with a BMI ≥30 were less likely to be TB uninfected (OR 0.38; 95% CI 0.18–0.80). Using the stricter definition, 44.3% (136/307) of all miners were classified as either TB uninfected (35; 26%) or infected, (101; 74%) and the associations remained similar. Among Black/African miners; 123 were classified as either TB uninfected (23; 19%) or infected (100; 81%) using the stricter definition. No epidemiological factors for being TB uninfected were identified. Conclusions Despite high cumulative exposure, a small proportion of miners appear to be resistant to TB infection and are without distinguishing epidemiological characteristics."
https://openalex.org/W4220733075,"In Ethiopia, more than four million children are anticipated to live under particularly difficult circumstances. Street children are subject to violence, a lack of health care, and a lack of education. Which denies them the right to live in a secure environment and exposes them to different health problems. Currently, little is known about the prevalence of Streetism, including health conditions. Therefore, this study was aimed to assess the health status of street children and determinants of Streetism.Mixed methods (sequential) were employed from February 1 to 28, 2021. Quantitative cross-sectional study design and phenomenological qualitative designs were applied. Overall, 220 street children were involved in the study. The most common reason that forced the children to resort to a street way of life is to look for a job and quarreled with parents. The data were collected using interviews methods. Chi-square test and multiple binary logistic regression were applied to examine the variations among variables with the health status of street children. Qualitative data were analyzed using the thematic analysis technique.The study included a total of 220 street children. As to the quantitative study, the majority of study participants (92.73%) drank alcohol regularly. Depression (39.22%) and peer pressure (43.14%) were the most common initiation causes of drinking alcohol. According to a qualitative study report, ""Street children are mostly affected by the communicable disease"" and… They are addicted to substances like benzene"" which had a profound effect on their health."" Furthermore, the study discovered a statistically significant association between respondents' health status and sociodemographic characteristics (age and educational status), job presence, and drug use.This study identified the factors that drove street children to live on the streets, such as the inability to find work and disagreements with their parents. The majority of the street children were affected by preventable and treatable diseases. Unfortunately, almost all street children reported drinking alcohol, which exposed them to a variety of health problems. In general, the study discovered that street children require immediate attention. Decision-makers and academicians should collaborate to develop a plan for these children's health and social interventions."
https://openalex.org/W4220865391,"Nepal has made significant progress in decreasing the number of malaria cases over the last two decades. Prevention and timely management of malaria are critical for the National Malaria Program in its quest for elimination. The study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitudes and behaviour towards malaria prevention and treatment among people living in rural villages of Khatyad Rural Municipality in Nepal.This qualitative study collected information through virtual in-depth interviews (N = 25) with female and male participants aged between 15 and 72 years.More than half of the participants knew about the causes of malaria, were aware of the complications of untreated malaria and knew that anti-malarial medicines were provided for free at the public health facilities. Participants indicated that their first choice of health care were public health facilities, however limited supply of medications and diagnostics deviated patients to the private sector. While tertiary care costs were not financially viable, participants opted against traditional care for malaria. Factors such as cost of treatment, distance to the health facility and the decision making authority in households influenced health related decisions in the family. Although long-lasting insecticidal nets were distributed and indoor residual spraying was done periodically, several barriers were identified.Increased awareness of malaria prevention and treatment among people living in malaria risk areas is important for the National Malaria Program in its quest for malaria elimination in Nepal."

We aimed to assess serum vitamin D levels in patients with (HS) in Jordan. a cross-sectional comparative study conducted among 110 patients with HS and 110 matched controls, who didn't previously receive vitamin D therapy. Serum vitamin D was measured and classified into normal (>30 ng/ml), insufficient (20-30 ng/ml), and low (<20 ng/ml). The mean age of the cases was 43.1 ± 12.9 years and the mean disease duration was 19.4 months. The mean body mass index among patients with HS was 30 and about 34% of them were smokers. The mean Vitamin D level was 8.4 ng/ml and all HS patients were vitamin D deficient. Patients of HS were more likely to have vitamin D deficiency compared to healthy controls. Most of the study subjects and particularly all of the patients with HS have low vitamin D levels. Smoking and high BMI, were associated with HS. We suggest the implementation standard public dietary recommendations of Vitamin D supplementation, smoking cessation, and weight reduction behaviors with further assessment of disease course among HS patients."

https://openalex.org/W4221052086,"The high incidence and mortality rates make lung cancer a global public health issue. Socioeconomic conditions and the provision of health services may be associated with this reality. This study investigates the spatial distribution of advanced-stage diagnosis and mortality due to lung cancer and its association with the healthcare services supply and demographic and socioeconomic indicators in Brazil. This is an ecological study with 161 Intermediate Regions of Urban Articulation. Mortality data were extracted from the Mortality Information System, and the cases of lung cancer were obtained from the Integrator of Hospital-Based Cancer Registries from 2011 to 2015. Analyses employed Moran's I, local indicators of spatial association, and the multivariable model. The proportion of advanced-stage diagnosis was 85.28% (95% CI 83.31-87.10) and was positively associated with the aging rate (Moran's I 0.11; p = 0.02), per capita income (Moran's I 0.05; p = 0.01) and negatively associated with Gini Index (Moran's I -0.16; p = 0.01). The mean age-adjusted mortality rates was 12.82 deaths/100,000 inhabitants (SD 5.12). The age-adjusted mortality rates for lung cancer presented a positive and statistically significant spatial association with all demographic, socioeconomic and healthcare services supply indicators, except for the ""density of family health teams"" (Moran's I -0.02 p = 0.28). The multivariable model for the mortality rates was constituted by the variables ""Density of facilities licensed in oncology"", ""Per capita income"", and ""Health plan coverage"". The per capita income presented positive association and health plan coverage negative association with age-adjusted mortality rates. Both associations were statistically significant. The variable density of facilities licensed in oncology showed no significant association with age-adjusted mortality rates. There is a high proportion of advanced-stage diagnosis across the Brazilian territory and inequalities in lung cancer mortality, which are correlated with the most developed areas of the country."
https://openalex.org/W4220740020,"Hydroxyurea (HDU) is a widely used medication for various malignancies, thalassemia, and sickle cell anemia with reported side effects. The current study investigated HDU- induced hepatic injury and the protective potential of the royal jelly (RJ) against this hepatotoxic effect in the light of hepatic oxidative/ antioxidative status, pro-inflammatory cytokine, apoptosis signaling pathway, and histopathology. Sixty albino rats were used (n = 10/group) for 60 days: control, RJ (100 mg/kg body weight, orally), HDU (225 mg/kg body weight, orally), 2HDU (450 mg/kg body weight, orally), and HDU + RJ groups. HDU-treated rats showed significant elevation of liver function tests as aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase, as well as malondialdehyde and nitric oxide (oxidative biomarkers) and significant decreased hepatic antioxidant molecules (reduced glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase), compared to a control group, that more pronounced in the high dose of HDU. In addition, HDU induced significant upregulation of TNF-α and the Caspase-3 apoptotic pathway. Moreover, the liver of HDU treated groups showed various hepatic lesions from mild to severe necrotic changes related to the HDU dose. However, administration of RJ with HDU improved liver function tests, liver histology, and hepatic oxidative/antioxidative status concerning HDU groups. Furthermore, oral RJ administration with HDU significantly lessens the immune-expression area % of TNF-α and Caspase-3. Thus, the royal jelly has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-apoptotic properties against HDU- induced hepatic injury and could be, therefore, used as adjuvant therapy in patients with long-term HDU medication."
https://openalex.org/W4220745990,"Purpose To identify preferred burnout interventions within a resident physician population, utilizing the Nominal Group Technique. The results will be used to design a discrete choice experiment study to inform the development of resident burnout prevention programs. Methods Three resident focus groups met (10–14 participants/group) to prioritize a list of 23 factors for burnout prevention programs. The Nominal Group Technique consisted of three steps: an individual, confidential ranking of the 23 factors by importance from 1 to 23, a group discussion of each attribute, including a group review of the rankings, and an opportunity to alter the original ranking across participants. Results The total number of residents (36) were a representative sample of specialty, year of residency, and sex. There was strong agreement about the most highly rated attributes which grouped naturally into themes of autonomy, meaning, competency and relatedness. There was also disagreement on several of the attributes that is likely due to the differences in residency specialty and subsequently rotation requirements. Conclusion This study identified the need to address multiple organizational factors that may lead to physician burnout. There is a clear need for complex interventions that target systemic and program level factors rather than focus on individual interventions. These results may help residency program directors understand the specific attributes of a burnout prevention program valued by residents. Aligning burnout interventions with resident preferences could improve the efficacy of burnout prevention programs by improving adoption of, and satisfaction with, these programs. Physician burnout is a work-related syndrome characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment [1]. Burnout is present in epidemic proportions and was estimated to occur in over 50 percent of practicing physicians and in up to 89 percent of resident physicians pre-COVID 19. The burnout epidemic is growing; a recent national survey of US physicians reported an 8.9 percent increase in burnout between 2011 and 2014 [2]. Rates of physician burnout have also increased [3] during the COVID-19 pandemic with a new classification of “pandemic burnout” experienced by over 52 percent of healthcare workers as early as June of 2020 [4]. Physician burnout can lead to depression, suicidal ideation, and relationship problems that may progress to substance abuse, increased interpersonal conflicts, broken relationships, low quality of life, major depression, and suicide [5–7]. The estimated rate of physician suicide is 300–400 annually [8–10]."
https://openalex.org/W4220866394,"The present study evaluated the cytotoxicity, antioxidant potential, and antimicrobial effect on the antibiotic activity modulation of gelatin nanoparticles containing buriti oil (OPG). The cytotoxicity analysis was performed on Chinese Hamster Ovary Cells (CHO) using a MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] test. The antioxidant potential of buriti oil and OPG was determined by total antioxidant capacity, reducing power, and the ABTS (2,2'-azinobis-3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) test. The modulating antimicrobial activity was evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) concentration against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, gentamicin and norflaxacillin. The nanoformulation of OPG did not show a cytotoxic effect on CHO cells and had a higher antioxidant potential than free buriti oil (p<0.05). The combination of antibiotics with free buriti oil and OPG was more efficient in inhibiting E. coli and P. aeruginosa than isolated norfloxacillin and gentamicin (p<0.05). Regarding the inhibition of S. aureus, OPG in combination with norfloxacillin reduced MIC by 50%. Nanoencapsulation was a viable alternative to enhance functionality and adding commercial value to buriti oil."

Three versions of this game at different difficulty levels were made with the StarCraft Editor, and the gaze movements of seven Expert and nine Low Skill players were analyzed while they played the games. The gaze of Expert players covered a significantly larger area in the horizontal direction than the gaze of Low Skill players. Furthermore, the magnitude and number of saccadic eye movements were greater, and saccade velocity was faster in the Expert than in the Low Skill players. In conclusion, StarCraft experts have a specific gaze control ability that enables them to quickly and widely take visual information from all over the monitor. This could be one of the factors enabling StarCraft experts to perform better than players with lower skills when playing games that require task-switching ability."
https://openalex.org/W4221004942,"The response of small business managers to an external event such as the pandemic can have a profound effect on the work environment, health and well-being for themselves and their employees. Previous research on small business managers during the pandemic has mainly focused on traditional pathogenic effects, and there is a lack of studies looking at the issue from a salutogenic health promotion perspective. The aim of this study is to explore whether a sense of coherence and general resistance resources were experienced by small business managers in Sweden and Norway during the Covid-19 pandemic.A qualitative design was applied through exploratory interviews with 16 managers of small businesses in Sweden and Norway. A content analysis of the interviews was conducted using the sense of coherence concept by Aaron Antonovsky, with the three main components of comprehensibility, meaningfulness and manageability acting as a conceptual framework for the analysis process.Within the three main sense-of-coherence categories, six general resistance resources were identified as being important for the managers to handle uncertainty during the pandemic. These were understanding rules and regulations, social support, optimism, proactivity, problem-solving and flexibility and cooperation.The small business managers handled the pandemic in a way that worked well in their contexts, and the pandemic generally did not have a negative effect on their businesses or themselves. A salutogenic approach, through which the managers focused on identifying and using resources, was an important factor for managing stressors and adversity during the pandemic. Hence, the concept of salutogenesis may be used as an intervention to foster better health in small businesses, both at a personal and organisational level in order to handle future challenges effectively."
https://openalex.org/W4221007003,"Objective Sijunzi decoction (SJZD) was used to treat patients with colorectal cancer (CRC) as an adjuvant method. The aim of the study was to investigate the therapeutic targets and pathways of SJZD towards the tumor microenvironment of CRC via network pharmacology and the ESTIMATE algorithm. Methods The ESTIMATE algorithm was used to calculate immune and stromal scores to predict the level of infiltrating immune and stromal cells. The active targets of SJZD were searched in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology Database and Analysis Platform (TCMSP) and UniProt database. The core targets were obtained by matching the differentially expressed genes in CRC tissues and the targets of SJZD. Then, GO, KEGG and validation in TCGA were carried out. Results According to the ESTIMATE algorithm and survival analysis, the median survival time of the low stromal score group was significantly higher than that of the high stromal score group ( P = 0.018), while the patients showed no significant difference of OS between different immune groups ( P = 0.19). A total of 929 genes were upregulated and 115 genes were downregulated between the stromal score groups (|logFC| &gt; 2, adjusted P &lt; 0.05); 357 genes were upregulated and 472 genes were downregulated between the immune score groups. The component-target network included 139 active components and 52 related targets. The core targets were HSPB1 , SPP1 , IGFBP3 , and TGFB1 , which were significantly associated with poor prognosis in TCGA validation. GO terms included the response to hypoxia, the extracellular space, protein binding and the TNF signaling pathway. Immunoreaction was the main enriched pathway identified by KEGG analysis. Conclusion The core genes ( HSPB1 , SPP1 , IGFBP3 and TGFB1 ) affected CRC development and prognosis by regulating hypoxia, protein binding and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in the extracellular matrix."
https://openalex.org/W4221009210,"Background Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) toxin in Staphylococcus aureus has been associated with both severe pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infections. However, there are only limited data on how this virulence factor may influence the clinical course or complications of bacteremic S . aureus infections. Methods Between September 2016 and March 2018, S . aureus isolates from clinical cultures from hospitals in an academic medical center underwent comprehensive genomic sequencing. Four hundred sixty-nine (29%) of 1681 S . aureus sequenced isolates were identified as containing the genes that encode for PVL. Case patients with one or more positive blood cultures for PVL were randomly matched with control patients having positive blood cultures with lukF/lukS-PV negative (PVL strains from a retrospective chart review). Results 51 case and 56 control patients were analyzed. Case patients were more likely to have a history of injection drug use, while controls more likely to undergo hemodialysis. Isolates from 78.4% of case patients were methicillin resistant as compared to 28.6% from control patients. Case patients had a higher incidence of pneumonia and skin and soft tissue infection and longer duration of fever without differences in length of bacteremia. Clinical cure or expiration was comparable. Conclusions These results are consistent with prior observations associating the PVL toxin with both community-acquired MRSA strains as well as severe staphylococcal pneumonia. The presence of the PVL toxin does not appear to otherwise influence the natural history of bacteremic S . aureus disease other than in prolonging the duration of fever."
https://openalex.org/W4221095248,"Adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) is the most commonly mutated gene in colon cancer and can cause familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Hypermethylation of the APC promoter can also promote the development of breast cancer, indicating that APC is not limited to association with colorectal neoplasms. However, no pan-cancer analysis has been conducted. We studied the location and structure of APC and the expression and potential role of APC in a variety of tumors by using The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases and online bioinformatics analysis tools. The APC is located at 5q22.2, and its protein structure is conserved among H. sapiens, M. musculus with C. elaphus hippelaphus. The APC identity similarity between homo sapiens and mus musculus reaches 90.1%. Moreover, APC is highly specifically expressed in brain tissues and bipolar cells but has low expression in most cancers. APC is mainly expressed on the cell membrane and is not detected in plasma by mass spectrometry. APC is low expressed in most tumor tissues, and there is a significant correlation between the expressed level of APC and the main pathological stages as well as the survival and prognosis of tumor patients. In most tumors, APC gene has mutation and methylation and an enhanced phosphorylation level of some phosphorylation sites, such as T1438 and S2260. The expressed level of APC is also involved in the level of CD8+ T-cell infiltration, Tregs infiltration, and cancer-associated fibroblast infiltration. We conducted a gene correlation study, but the findings seemed to contradict the previous analysis results of the low expression of the APC gene in most cancers. Our research provides a comparative wholesale understanding of the carcinogenic effects of APC in various cancers, which will help anti-cancer research."
https://openalex.org/W4221128002,"Human anxiety is a grave mental health concern that needs to be addressed in the appropriate manner in order to develop a healthy society. In this study, an objective human anxiety assessment framework is developed by using physiological signals of electroencephalography (EEG) and recorded in response to exposure therapy. The EEG signals of twenty-three subjects from an existing database called ""A Database for Anxious States which is based on a Psychological Stimulation (DASPS)"" are used for anxiety quantification into two and four levels. The EEG signals are pre-processed using appropriate noise filtering techniques to remove unwanted ocular and muscular artifacts. Channel selection is performed to select the significantly different electrodes using statistical analysis techniques for binary and four-level classification of human anxiety, respectively. Features are extracted from the data of selected EEG channels in the frequency domain. Frequency band selection is applied to select the appropriate combination of EEG frequency bands, which in this study are theta and beta bands. Feature selection is applied to the features of the selected EEG frequency bands. Finally, the selected subset of features from the appropriate frequency bands of the statistically significant EEG channels were classified using multiple machine learning algorithms. An accuracy of 94.90% and 92.74% is attained for two and four-level anxiety classification using a random forest classifier with 9 and 10 features, respectively. The proposed state anxiety classification framework outperforms the existing anxiety detection framework in terms of accuracy with a smaller number of features which reduces the computational complexity of the algorithm."

Semi-structured interview techniques were applied among participants, made up of 15 lecturers in the Humanities Faculty, Diponegoro University, Indonesia, and thematic analysis was used to analyze the data obtained. The results showed the focus of lecturers' information literacy experience was primarily on student interactions and knowledge of various online learning platforms. However, information repackaging was a significant initial consideration during virtual classes, after identifying salient student characteristics. In summary, the present study have contributed to the theoretical understanding of information literacy and may be of benefit to the teaching faculties for enhancing teaching and learning activities, as well as providing student support."
https://openalex.org/W4221025455,"Recently, it was shown that fracture risk assessment in patients with femoral bone metastases using Finite Element (FE) modeling can be performed using a calibration phantom or air-fat-muscle calibration and that non-patient-specific calibration was less favorable. The purpose of this study was to investigate if phantomless calibration can be used instead of phantom calibration when different CT protocols are used. Differences in effect of CT protocols on Hounsfield units (HU), calculated bone mineral density (BMD) and FE failure loads between phantom and two methods of phantomless calibrations were studied. Five human cadaver lower limbs were scanned atop a calibration phantom according to a standard scanning protocol and seven additional commonly deviating protocols including current, peak kilovoltage (kVp), slice thickness, rotation time, field of view, reconstruction kernel, and reconstruction algorithm. The HUs of the scans were calibrated to BMD (in mg/cm3) using the calibration phantom as well as using air-fat-muscle and non-patient-specific calibration, resulting in three models for each scan. FE models were created, and failure loads were calculated by simulating an axial load on the femur. HU, calculated BMD and failure load of all protocols were compared between the three calibration methods. The different protocols showed little variation in HU, BMD and failure load. However, compared to phantom calibration, changing the kVp resulted in a relatively large decrease of approximately 10% in mean HU and BMD of the trabecular and cortical region of interest (ROI), resulting in a 13.8% and 13.4% lower failure load when air-fat-muscle and non-patient-specific calibrations were used, respectively. In conclusion, while we observed significant correlations between air-fat-muscle calibration and phantom calibration as well as between non-patient-specific calibration and phantom calibration, our sample size was too small to prove that either of these calibration approaches was superior. Further studies are necessary to test whether air-fat-muscle or non-patient-specific calibration could replace phantom calibration in case of different scanning protocols."

The present study aims to explore whether these externalizing characteristics together have a potential group-forming role in AUD using latent profile analysis (LPA).Externalizing characteristics of 102 AUD patients were analyzed using LPA to explore the group-forming role of externalizing symptoms; groups were compared in terms of demographic and alcohol-related variables, indices of psychopathological, depressive and anxiety symptom severity.LPA revealed and supported a two-group model based on externalizing symptoms. The group with higher levels of externalizing symptoms showed significantly elevated levels of alcohol-related and anxio-depressive symptoms.Externalizing characteristics converge and have a group-forming role in chronic AUD, and are associated with a more severe form of AUD. By making the diagnostic category less heterogeneous, these different subtypes within AUD may provide aid in tailoring treatments to patients' specific needs."
https://openalex.org/W4221087054,"Alcohol-based hand sanitizers (ABHS) have been an important hand hygiene tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, ABHS from non-traditional drug manufacturers have entered the market, triggered by a lack of ABHS availability. Some of these ABHS contain high levels of chemical impurities that may be harmful with frequent exposure. Additionally, the use of refillable dispensers designed to accept ABHS from bulk containers allows for mixing and evaporation that may compromise ABHS integrity. To understand the risks associated with low quality ABHS and bulk refilling practices, we collected 77 ABHS samples sourced from community settings (restaurants, grocery stores, etc.) and 40 samples from a single school district. All samples were obtained from bulk refillable dispensers that were in use. Samples were analyzed for alcohol content, chemical impurities, aesthetic qualities, and presence of drug labeling information. Additionally, we performed laboratory-based experiments to determine the impact of dispenser design on alcohol evaporation rates. Over 70% of samples for which photos were available showed lack of essential labeling information, including missing ""Drug Facts Labels"". For ABHS samples acquired from community settings, nearly 14% of samples had visible impurities, and over 30% of samples had concentrations of acetal and acetaldehyde in excess of FDA interim limits. Subpotent ethanol concentrations were observed in 9.09% and 82.05% of samples from community settings and the school district, respectively, with the school district sample results being associated with dispenser misuse. Laboratory-based experiments show dispenser design significantly impacts the rate of ethanol evaporation of ABHS products, especially if stored in open refillable dispensers without an internal reservoir. This study demonstrates risks associated with use of inferior ABHS and bulk refilling practices. Regulatory agencies should issue guidance on best practices in community settings to ensure the integrity of ABHS as an essential public health tool to prevent the spread of COVID-19 and other transmissible diseases."
https://openalex.org/W4220727295,"In virtually any practical field or application, discovering and implementing near-optimal decision strategies is essential for achieving desired outcomes. Workflow planning is one of the most common and important problems of this kind, as sub-optimal decision-making may create bottlenecks and delays that decrease efficiency and increase costs. Recently, machine learning has been used to attack this problem, but unfortunately, most proposed solutions are “black box” algorithms with underlying logic unclear to humans. This makes them hard to implement and impossible to trust, significantly limiting their practical use. In this work, we propose an alternative approach: using machine learning to generate optimal, comprehensible strategies which can be understood and used by humans directly. Through three common decision-making problems found in scheduling, we demonstrate the implementation and feasibility of this approach, as well as its great potential to attain near-optimal results."
https://openalex.org/W4220928454,"Serum amyloid A (SAA) is an acute phase inflammatory protein that we previously described as a robust biomarker of colorectal inflammation in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) in clinical remission. However, what induces SAA expression in UC remains unclear. This study demonstrates that SAA is significantly expressed in the intestinal tract of UC mouse models when compared with C-reactive protein, another inflammatory biomarker. Moreover, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α were found to promote SAA1 expression, as were Toll-like receptor ligands flagellin and lipopolysaccharide. Furthermore, results suggested that the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway may be involved in the promotion of SAA1 expression by flagellin, which was inhibited by treatment with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). Therefore, the flagellin/NF-κB/SAA1 axis may represent one of the mechanisms by which 5-ASA suppresses intestinal inflammation."
https://openalex.org/W4220955642,"Individual differences in tempo and timing of biological maturity, especially in adolescents, has been argued as a potential underlying cause of relative age effects observed in Physical education (PE). Indeed, differences in maturation could influence pupils`achievement in PE where motor behavior and physical activity are central tenets. However, the timing of biological maturity has not previously been investigated in the context of academic achievement in PE. Therefore, the current study`s aim was to investigate the association between timing of biological maturity and relative age on adolescents`academic achievement in PE. The data material consists of two samples from lower secondary schools (13–16 years old). Sample 1 (45 boys and 31 girls) was used to compare differences in anthropometrics and indicators of biological maturity between pupils with different grades (i.e., 3/4, 5, 6), while in sample 2 (114 boys and 127 girls) differences in mean grade were compared between birth quartiles. Pupils`final grade in PE were collected for both samples as a proxy for academic achievement. A one-way analysis of variance indicated a moderate-to-large association between timing of biological maturity, through age at peak height velocity, and academic achievement in PE, where later maturing pupils received a higher grade compared to earlier maturing pupils. Results from a factorial analysis of variance indicated an interaction effect between gender and birth quartile on academic achievement in PE. Post hoc analysis revealed that relatively younger boys received significantly lower grades as opposed to their relatively older peers. This effect was not present for girls. Collectively, these results indicate that developmental differences are associated with academic achievement in PE. Hence, PE teachers should be aware of these individual constraints in their teaching and assessment practice to accommodate fair and equal opportunities for achievement in the subject."
https://openalex.org/W4221024552,"In the context of the Belt and Road Initiative, China Railway Express achieved rapid development. Determining how to achieve effective marking and determining how to adopt the optimal competitive strategy are the main challenges for CR Express operators. By choosing long-distance transportation as the research object, this research established a competitive model between CR Express and maritime transportation based on game theory. First, we determined the participants of this competition. By dividing common goods into the categories of high-value and high-time-sensitiveness, high-value and low-time-sensitiveness, low-value and high-time-sensitiveness, and low-value and low-time-sensitiveness, the model was used to simulate four situations and to obtain optimal strategies for operators. For CR Express, it was always effective to adopt a service optimizing strategy to improve the service level and earn market share. For maritime transportation, this strategy was effective only for high-value and low-time-sensitiveness goods as well as low value and low-time-sensitiveness goods. Therefore, transportation service suppliers should make competitive strategies based on different good types, and it is effective to use differentiation strategies to earn market share and improve competitiveness only for suitable types of goods."
https://openalex.org/W4221043138,"Background Coronavirus disease 2019 has had a global effect on people’s lifestyles. Many people have developed irregular eating patterns and become physically inactive, which leads to an aggravation of lifestyle-related diseases and unhealthier lifestyles; these, subsequently raise the severity of coronavirus disease 2019. This study aimed to assess lifestyle changes during coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic in Gondar town, North West, Ethiopia. Method Community-based cross-sectional study design was conducted among households at Gondar town from June to August 2021. The study participants were selected by a systematic random sampling technique from proportionally allocated kebeles. Data were collected using face-to-face interview techniques and were entered and analyzed by using a statistical package for the social sciences version 24; P -values &lt; 0.05 were considered as statistically significant. Result Overall, 348 study participants were included in the study. Among those respondents, 52.3% (182) were female study participants and the mean age of the respondents was 30.95±14.4. In this study, there was a significant decrement in non-homemade food from 20.4% to 13.4% at ( P = &lt;0.001). Concerning water intake, 11.5% (40) of respondents consumed ≥8 cups/day before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, and the percentage increased to 14.7% (51) during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic (p = 0.01). Of the participants, 46% participants were reported never engaging in any physical activity before the coronavirus pandemic, and the percentage decreased to 29.9% during the pandemic ( P = 0.002). The respondents also exhibited increment tension in large from 4.9% to 22.7% before and during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, respectively. Furthermore, about 6.3% of the study participants slept badly before the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemics and the effects of sleeping badly and restlessly increased to 25.9% during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic ( P = &lt;0.001). Conclusion The current study demonstrates that there is a noticeable alteration in food consumption, food choices, regular mealtime, sleeping habits, mental exhaustion, and practice of physical activity."
https://openalex.org/W4221049511,"The incidence of achilles tendon rupture varies by gender, age, and seasonal variation. However, there has been no study as yet linking achilles tendon rupture to daily fluctuations in outdoor temperature. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between outdoor temperature and achilles tendon rupture using a Korea Meteorological Administration database and a Korean National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database. Between 2002 and 2015, all instances of achilles tendon repair were retrieved from the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database to examine sociodemographic factors, specifically sex, age, residential area, and income level. Minimum age requirement was 20 years. Outdoor temperatures recorded at 16 observation points in South Korea were also acquired from the Korea Meteorological Administration data center for analysis. Overall, 850 (0.119%) of 713,456 individuals in the National Health Insurance Service-National Sample Cohort database underwent achilles tendon repair between 2002 and 2015. Yearly procedural totals increased with advancing age, peaking at ages 30-39 years (14.6 per 100,000 persons) and declining thereafter. Minimum, median, and maximum outdoor temperatures were associated with achilles tendon repair (p<0.05), as did household income. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, outdoor temperatures, sex, age, and household income emerged as factors significantly associated with achilles tendon repair. Outcomes of this study confirm an association between incidence of achilles tendon repair and outdoor temperature, the latter denoting a novel index and likely surrogate measure of vigorous physical activity afforded by warmer weather."

The aim of this study was to compare the effect of autoclave sterilization on two NiTi rotary instruments that undergo different manufacturing treatments: The electro-polished Race and the heat-treated Race Evo, using scanning electron microscope analysis. In this in-vitro study, Race and Race-Evo instruments were subjected to a number of autoclaving cycles (0, 1, 3, 5, and 10). Scanning electron microscopy images were obtained at 3 mm from the tip of the file at 450x and 1000x magnifications. Surface roughness parameters were measured using ImageJ software. The results showed that autoclave sterilization caused a significant decrease in conventional NiTi Race surface roughness. While in Race Evo, surface roughness increased following the first autoclaving cycle. After 10 autoclaving cycles, surface roughness significantly decreased for both Race and Race Evo files."
https://openalex.org/W4221134317,"Fur seal populations in the Southern Hemisphere were plundered in the late 1700s and early 1800s to provide fur for a clothing industry. Millions of seals were killed resulting in potentially major ecosystem changes across the Southern Hemisphere, the consequences of which are unknown today. Following more than a century of population suppression, partly through on-going harvesting, many of the fur seal populations started to recover in the late 1900s. Australian fur seals (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus), one of the most geographically constrained fur seal species, followed this trend. From the 1940s to 1986, pup production remained at approximately 10,000 per year, then significant growth commenced. By 2007, live pup abundance had recovered to approximately 21,400 per year and recovery was expected to continue However, a species-wide survey in 2013 recorded a 20% decline, to approximately 16,500 live pups. It was not known if this decline was due to 2013 being a poor breeding year or a true population reduction. Here we report the results of a population-wide survey conducted in 2017 and annual monitoring at the most productive colony, Seal Rocks, Victoria that recorded a large decline in live pup abundance (-28%). Sustained lower pup numbers at Seal Rocks from annual counts between 2012-2017 (mean = 2908 ± 372 SD), as well as the population-wide estimate of 16,903 live pups in 2017, suggest that the pup numbers for the total population have remained at the lower level observed in 2013 and that the 5-yearly census results are not anomalies or representative of poor breeding seasons. Potential reasons for the decline, which did not occur range-wide but predominantly in the most populated and long-standing breeding sites, are discussed. To enhance adaptive management of this species, methods for future monitoring of the population are also presented. Australian fur seals occupy several distinct regions influenced by different currents and upwellings: range-wide pup abundance monitoring enables comparisons of ecosystem status across these regions. Forces driving change in Australian fur seal pup numbers are likely to play across other marine ecosystems, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere where most fur seals live."
https://openalex.org/W4220814550,"To solve the problems in the existing fully homomorphic encryption (FHE)-based secure multi-party computation (SMC) protocols such as low efficiency, the FHE scheme that supports multi-bit encryption was modified during the generation of the public key so that the users could generate their public keys independently without the common random string (CRS) matrix. Further, a multi-bit Gentry-Sahai-Waters scheme (MGSW) scheme without CRS was constructed. The modified LinkAlgo algorithm was adopted to expand the single-key ciphertext into the multi-key ciphertext and simplify the way of generating the expanded ciphertext. In this way, a multi-key FHE (MFHE) scheme was achieved based on the MGSW scheme. Finally, a three-round SMC protocol without CRS was constructed using the MFHE scheme and the decisional learning with errors (DLWE) assumption, which was secure in the semi-malicious model. Compared to the existing protocols, the protocol proposed herein can support multi-bit encryption and is found with smaller ciphertext size and lower storage overhead and generate the expanded ciphertext in a simpler way. Overall performance is better than existing protocols."

The study aimed to investigate the potential risk factors for hospital admission in patients returning to the ED within 72 hours with a final diagnosis of infectious diseases.This retrospective cohort study analyzed return visits to the ED from January to December 2019. Adult patients aged >20 years who had a return visit to the ED within 72 hours with an infectious disease were included herein. In total, 715 eligible patients were classified into the intravenous antibiotics and non-intravenous antibiotics group (reference group). The outcome studied was hospital admission to general ward and intensive care unit (ICU) at the return visits.Patients receiving intravenous antibiotics at index visits had significantly higher risk-approximately two times-for hospital admission at the return visits than those did not (adjusted odds ratio = 2.47, 95% CI = 1.34-4.57, p = 0.004). For every 10 years increase in age, the likelihood for hospital admission increased by 38%. Other factors included abnormal respiratory rate and high C-reactive protein levels.Intravenous antibiotic administration at the index visit was an independent risk factor for hospital admission at return visits in patients with an infection disease.

The M-SPADI had good face validity; item and scale content validity indexes (I-CVI, S-CVI) were >0.79 except for Disability Item 3 (I-CVI = 0.75), and exploratory factor analysis showed that M-SPADI had a bidimensional structure. There was a strong positive correlation between M-SPADI and NRS (rPain = 0.845, rDisability = 0.722, rTotal = 0.795, p <0.001) and a negative correlation between M-SPADI and shoulder AROM with the following correlation ranges (rPain = -0.316 to -0.637, rDisability = -0.419 to -0.708, rTotal = -0404 to -0.697, p<0.001). M-SPADI's total score was higher in participants with shoulder pain (Mdn: 33.8, IQR = 37.3) compared to no shoulder pain (Mdn:0, IQR = 0.8) and the difference was statistically significant (U = 238.5, z = -13.89, p<0.001). M-SPADI had no floor or ceiling effects (floor/ceiling <15%), high internal consistency (Cronbach's αPain = 0.914, Cronbach's αDisability = 0.945) and good to excellent test-retest reliability (ICCPain = 0.922, ICCDisability = 0.859, ICCTotal = 0.895).M-SPADI has a bi-dimensional structure with no floor or ceiling effects, established face, content and construct validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability.

Two studies were performed. In Study 1, attachment security was primed by showing pictures that depicted relationships with attachment figures; the outgroup was the homeless and humanization was measured considering the attribution of uniquely human and non-uniquely human emotions to this group. In Study 2, the sense of interpersonal security was activated by inviting participants to relive a recent interaction that left them with a feeling of safety and warmth. Outgroup members were the Roma, and humanization was measured considering the attribution of uniquely human and human nature traits to them. In Study 2, the mediation effect of intergroup emotions was investigated. In both studies, outgroup humanization effects were highlighted. In Study 2, these effects were mediated by increased empathy toward the outgroup. Interestingly, the positive impact of security activation was not moderated by chronic attachment orientations. Findings suggest strategies that can be used to improve intergroup relations in specific contexts and in society at large."
https://openalex.org/W4221033714,"Introduction The healthcare industry is increasingly concerned about medical errors, which are the leading cause of death worldwide and also compromise patient safety. This medical error is even more serious in developing countries where healthcare is not supported by technology. Because of the traditional paper-based prescription system, Ethiopia has an overall medication prescribing error rate of 58.07% that could be avoided if an electronic prescription system was in place. Therefore, this study aims to assess physicians’ perceptions towards electronic prescription implementation. Methods From February 1 to April 5, 2021, an institution-based cross-sectional study was conducted among physicians working in public hospitals in the Amhara region. 384 physicians were selected using a simple random sampling method. The data was collected using a self-administered questionnaire and analysed using SPSS, version 21. To assess factors associated with perception among physicians, a binary and multivariable logistic regression analysis were performed. A P.05 value, at a 95% confidence interval, was considered statistically significant. The validity of the questionnaire was determined based on expert opinion, as well as its reliability was determined by calculating the value of Cronbach alpha (α = .78). Results In this study, 231 (76.5%) of study participants had a positive perception of electronic prescription. Around 70.8% had more than 5 years of computer usage experience. Nearly 90% of participants claimed that their prescriptions were legible; however, 89% believe that paper-based prescriptions are prone to error. According to multivariable logistic regression analysis, technical skill [AOR] 4.7, 95% confidence interval [CI] (1.27–17.41), good internet access (AOR 2.82, % CI 1.75–4.54), and perceived usefulness of e-prescription system (AOR 3.31, 95% CI 1.01–12.12) were significantly associated with perception. Conclusions The majority of respondents have a positive perception of electronic prescription. The most notable factors associated with physician perception were organizational factors, internet access, perceived usefulness of the system, and technical skill."

This study was performed to understand patient lived experiences related to amputation and patient involvement in shared decision making. Materials and methods Phenomenological interviews were conducted with Veterans 6–12 months post transtibial or transmetatarsal amputation due to CLTI. Interviews were read and summarized by two analysts who discussed the contents of each interview and relationships between interviews to identify emergent, cross-cutting elements of patient experience. Results Twelve patients were interviewed between March and August 2019. Three cross cutting elements of patient lived experience and participation in shared decision making were identified: 1) Lacking a sense of decision making; 2) Actively working towards recovery as response to a perceived loss of independence; and 3) Experiencing amputation as a Veteran. Conclusions Patients did not report a high level of involvement in shared decision making about their amputation or amputation level. Understanding patient experiences and priorities is crucial to supporting shared decision making for Veterans with amputation due to CLTI."

Methods and results In this case-control study, 46 children with STS and 184 healthy children and adolescents were recruited. Demographic characteristics, lifestyle habits, allergy history, and family history were investigated using a questionnaire. The changes in heart rate and blood pressure from supine to sitting were monitored using a sitting test. The possible differences between STS patients and healthy children were analyzed using univariate analysis. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the independent risk factors for STS. Univariate analysis showed that the daily sleeping time of the STS children were significantly shorter than that of the control group [(8.8 ± 1.2) hours/day vs. (9.3 ± 1.0) hours/day, P = 0.009], and the proportion of positive family history of syncope in the STS patients was higher than the controls (4/42 vs. 3/181, P = 0.044). Multivariate logistic regression studies showed that reduced daily sleeping time was an independent risk factor of STS in children (P = 0.006). Furthermore, when daily sleeping time was prolonged by 1 h, the risk of STS was decreased by 37.3%. Conclusion Reduced daily sleeping was an independent risk factor for STS in children and adolescents."
https://openalex.org/W4220652077,"This study aimed to investigate alterations in white matter (WM) microstructure in patients with psychotic and non-psychotic bipolar disorder (PBD and NPBD, respectively). We used 3T-magnetic resonance imaging to examine 29 PBD, 23 NPBD, and 65 healthy control (HC) subjects. Using tract-based spatial statistics for diffusion tensor imaging data, we compared fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusion (MD) pairwise among the PBD, NPBD, and HC groups. We found several WM areas of decreased FA or increased MD in the PBD and NPBD groups compared to HC. PBD showed widespread FA decreases in the corpus callosum as well as the bilateral internal capsule and fornix. However, NPBD showed local FA decreases in a part of the corpus callosum body as well as in limited regions within the left cerebral hemisphere, including the anterior and posterior corona radiata and the cingulum. In addition, both PBD and NPBD shared widespread MD increases across the posterior corona radiata, cingulum, and sagittal stratum. These findings suggest that widespread WM microstructural alterations might be a common neuroanatomical characteristic of bipolar disorder, regardless of being psychotic or non-psychotic. Particularly, PBD might involve extensive inter-and intra-hemispheric WM connectivity disruptions."
https://openalex.org/W4220738186,"Central to cognitive load theory is the concept of element interactivity , which reflects the complexity of material. The complexity of linear equations depends on the number of operational and relational lines and the nature of the operation (balance versus inverse) in the solution procedure. A relational line refers to the quantitative relation whereby the right-hand side of the equation equals to its left-hand side. An operational line refers to the application of an operation and such a procedural step preserves the equality of the linear equation. The balance method and inverse method differ in the operational line (e.g., + 3 on both sides vs.– 3 becomes + 3) where the inverse operation imposes half the level of element interactivity as the balance method. Seventy-five students randomly assigned to either the balance group or inverse group to complete (i) one-step equations (Experiment 1), (ii) two-step equations (Experiment 2), and (iii) one-step and two-step equations with a focus on equations with negative pronumerals (Experiment 3). Performance favoured the inverse group when the gap between the low and high element interactivity equations was substantial enough. Both groups performed better and invested lower mental effort on the inverse operation than the balance operation."

This study assesses the impact of Domestic Violence Report and Referral (DVRR), a digital mandatory reporting compliance system with integrated direct-to-advocacy referrals sent with patient consent, on survivors' likelihood of receiving advocacy by race/ethnicity and gender.We assessed ED charts between 2014-2018 in an urban, Level 1 trauma center for DV-related positive screening, chief concern, or documentation in medical/social work notes. We matched these visits by name to local DV advocacy agency records. Using logistic regression, we assessed survivor odds of reaching advocacy by DVRR receipt, race/ethnicity and gender. We used predicted probabilities to identify between-group differences in advocacy services received.Of the 1366 visits, 740 received the DVRR intervention; 323 received advocacy services Without DVRR, compared to white, female survivors (n = 87), male survivors (n = 132) had 0.20 (95% CI: 0.07-0.56) times the odds of reaching advocacy compared to female survivors; Latinx survivors (n = 136) had 2.53 (95% CI: 1.58-4.07) times the odds of reaching advocacy compared to white survivors. With DVRR, the odds and predicted probabilities of reaching advocacy increased significantly for all survivors. White, female survivors (n = 74) who received DVRR experienced 2.60 (95% CI: 1.66-4.07) times the odds of connecting with advocacy. Compared to this reference group, Black survivors (n = 480) who received DVRR experienced 4.66 additional times the odds of reaching advocacy services (95% CI: 3.09-7.04) and male survivors (n = 84) experienced 8.96 additional times the odds (95% CI: 2.81-28.56). Overall, we predict 43% (95% CI: 38-53%) of Latinx survivors (n = 177), 36% (95% CI: 31-40%) of Black survivors (n = 480) and 23% (95% CI: 14-32%) of white survivors (n = 83); 37% (95% CI: 33-40%) of women (n = 656) and 29% (95% CI: 18-42%) of men (n = 84) received advocacy services with DVRR.Direct-to-advocacy ED referrals facilitated by eHealth technology improve access to advocacy care for all survivors in this sample; marginalized racial and ethnic groups most often victimized by DV appear to have the highest rates of connection to advocacy."
https://openalex.org/W4220769332,"In reinforcement learning, reward-driven feature learning directly from high-dimensional images faces two challenges: sample-efficiency for solving control tasks and generalization to unseen observations. In prior works, these issues have been addressed through learning representation from pixel inputs. However, their representation faced the limitations of being vulnerable to the high diversity inherent in environments or not taking the characteristics for solving control tasks. To attenuate these phenomena, we propose the novel contrastive representation method, Action-Driven Auxiliary Task (ADAT), which forces a representation to concentrate on essential features for deciding actions and ignore control-irrelevant details. In the augmented state-action dictionary of ADAT, the agent learns representation to maximize agreement between observations sharing the same actions. The proposed method significantly outperforms model-free and model-based algorithms in the Atari and OpenAI ProcGen, widely used benchmarks for sample-efficiency and generalization."

The autonomic nervous system and its regulatory influence on the cardiovascular system also play a key role in the physiological response to psychosocial stressors. It is unclear whether the disease-related impairment of cardiac autonomic control in people with type 2 diabetes affects the stress response. The aim of this study was therefore to examine the cardiac autonomic and the psychological stress response of people with type 2 diabetes compared to healthy control participants.We used the trier social stress test to induce stress in n = 51 participants with type 2 diabetes and n = 47 healthy controls. We assessed heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) using six ECG samples before, during and after the stress test. We measured participants' psychological stress response using visual analogue scales.Longitudinal multilevel models showed an attenuated HR increase in response to the stress test combined with a slower HR recovery after the stress test, in people with type 2 diabetes. This pattern was accompanied by significantly lower low frequency HRV but no differences in high frequency HRV between the groups. Additionally, people with type 2 diabetes showed an increased level of self-reported psychological tension 45 minutes after the stress test.The impairment of the autonomic nervous system found in people with type 2 diabetes is reflected in the HR response to stress-but not in the HRV response-and partially mirrored in the psychological stress response. Our results underline the importance of considering the interplay of psychosocial stress and disease-related changes in the physiological stress response system in research and treatment of type 2 diabetes."

This study uses video sequences from animal-borne cameras to capture time- and scale-dependent grazing behaviour variables related to sward explanatory conditions. We observed grazing 'through' the sheep's eyes using point-of-view (POV) cameras coupled with event logging software. Time-specific sward features were measured by sampling 'really' grazed patches identified by applying a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) precision-grazing approach. Sward variables on a Mediterranean native sward were measured for two years during the active spring plant-growth cycle. Overall, the results demonstrate that POV cameras were able to capture grazing behaviour fine-tuning to changes in sward characteristics. Sheep compensate for the decrease in sward quantity and nutritive value by increasing the size and duration at each behavioural scale (i.e., meal, bout, and station) while increasing the bout rate and decreasing the station rate. Diet composition also changed as sward matured. The proportion of forbs in the diet remained high in early and late spring, and forbs and legumes were preferred to grasses in early spring. Grazing selectivity was more pronounced in late spring, with sheep favouring the middle stratum of the sward's vertical structure, preferring green vegetative material, while enlarging the feeding niches' span and spending more time at each niche, consequently reducing the station rate. Although data collected by individual animal-borne POV cameras were representative of the flock behaviour, they may underestimate the total grazing time outside major meals. The results indicate that the use of animal-borne video cameras is suitable for assessing variations in sheep grazing behaviour patterns in complex swards."
https://openalex.org/W4220998910,"People living with HIV (PLHIV) present impaired muscle metaboreflex, which may lead to exercise intolerance and increased cardiovascular risk. The muscle metaboreflex adaptations to exercise training in these patients are unknown. The present study aims to investigate the effects of a supervised multimodal exercise training on hemodynamic and autonomic responses to muscle metaboreflex activation in PLHIV.In this randomized clinical trial protocol, 42 PLHIV aged 30-50 years will be randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 into an intervention or a control group. The intervention group will perform exercise training (3x/week during 12 weeks) and the control group will remain physically inactive. A reference group composed of 21 HIV-uninfected individuals will be included. Primary outcomes will be blood pressure and heart rate variability indices assessed during resting, mental stress, and activation of muscle metaboreflex by a digital sphygmomanometer and a heart rate monitor; respectively. Mental stress will be induced by the Stroop Color-Word test and muscle metaboreflex will be activated through a post-exercise circulatory arrest (PECA) protocol, being the latter performed without and with the application of a capsaicin-based analgesic balm in the exercised limb. Secondary outcomes will be heart rate, peripheral vascular resistance, stroke volume, cardiac output, blood lactate, anthropometric markers and handgrip maximal voluntary contraction. The intervention and control groups of PLHIV will be evaluated at baseline and after the intervention, while the HIV-uninfected reference group only at baseline.The findings of the present study may help to elucidate the muscle metaboreflex adaptations to exercise training in PLHIV.This study will be performed at University of Rio de Janeiro State following registration at ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04512456 on August 13, 2020."
