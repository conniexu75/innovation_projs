https://openalex.org/W2799278992,"Quantum key distribution (QKD)1,2 allows two distant parties to share encryption keys with security based on physical laws. Experimentally, QKD has been implemented via optical means, achieving key rates of 1.26 megabits per second over 50 kilometres of standard optical fibre 3 and of 1.16 bits per hour over 404 kilometres of ultralow-loss fibre in a measurement-device-independent configuration 4 . Increasing the bit rate and range of QKD is a formidable, but important, challenge. A related target, which is currently considered to be unfeasible without quantum repeaters5-7, is overcoming the fundamental rate-distance limit of QKD 8 . This limit defines the maximum possible secret key rate that two parties can distil at a given distance using QKD and is quantified by the secret-key capacity of the quantum channel 9 that connects the parties. Here we introduce an alternative scheme for QKD whereby pairs of phase-randomized optical fields are first generated at two distant locations and then combined at a central measuring station. Fields imparted with the same random phase are 'twins' and can be used to distil a quantum key. The key rate of this twin-field QKD exhibits the same dependence on distance as does a quantum repeater, scaling with the square-root of the channel transmittance, irrespective of who (malicious or otherwise) is in control of the measuring station. However, unlike schemes that involve quantum repeaters, ours is feasible with current technology and presents manageable levels of noise even on 550 kilometres of standard optical fibre. This scheme is a promising step towards overcoming the rate-distance limit of QKD and greatly extending the range of secure quantum communications."
https://openalex.org/W2800767913,"Tissues that undergo rapid cellular turnover, such as the mammalian haematopoietic system or the intestinal epithelium, are dependent on stem and progenitor cells that proliferate to provide differentiated cells to maintain organismal health. Stem and progenitor cells, in turn, are thought to rely on signals and growth factors provided by local niche cells to support their function and self-renewal. Several cell types have been hypothesized to provide the signals required for the proliferation and differentiation of the intestinal stem cells in intestinal crypts1-6. Here we identify subepithelial telocytes as an important source of Wnt proteins, without which intestinal stem cells cannot proliferate and support epithelial renewal. Telocytes are large but rare mesenchymal cells that are marked by expression of FOXL1 and form a subepithelial plexus that extends from the stomach to the colon. While supporting the entire epithelium, FOXL1+ telocytes compartmentalize the production of Wnt ligands and inhibitors to enable localized pathway activation. Conditional genetic ablation of porcupine (Porcn), which is required for functional maturation of all Wnt proteins, in mouse FOXL1+ telocytes causes rapid cessation of Wnt signalling to intestinal crypts, followed by loss of proliferation of stem and transit amplifying cells and impaired epithelial renewal. Thus, FOXL1+ telocytes are an important source of niche signals to intestinal stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2801746582,"Loss of dopamine in Parkinson's disease is hypothesized to impede movement by inducing hypo- and hyperactivity in striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs) of the direct (dSPNs) and indirect (iSPNs) pathways in the basal ganglia, respectively. The opposite imbalance might underlie hyperkinetic abnormalities, such as dyskinesia caused by treatment of Parkinson's disease with the dopamine precursor L-DOPA. Here we monitored thousands of SPNs in behaving mice, before and after dopamine depletion and during L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Normally, intermingled clusters of dSPNs and iSPNs coactivated before movement. Dopamine depletion unbalanced SPN activity rates and disrupted the movement-encoding iSPN clusters. Matching their clinical efficacy, L-DOPA or agonism of the D2 dopamine receptor reversed these abnormalities more effectively than agonism of the D1 dopamine receptor. The opposite pathophysiology arose in L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia, during which iSPNs showed hypoactivity and dSPNs showed unclustered hyperactivity. Therefore, both the spatiotemporal profiles and rates of SPN activity appear crucial to striatal function, and next-generation treatments for basal ganglia disorders should target both facets of striatal activity."

https://openalex.org/W2801786525,"Transdifferentiation is a complete and stable change in cell identity that serves as an alternative to stem-cell-mediated organ regeneration. In adult mammals, findings of transdifferentiation have been limited to the replenishment of cells lost from preexisting structures, in the presence of a fully developed scaffold and niche1. Here we show that transdifferentiation of hepatocytes in the mouse liver can build a structure that failed to form in development-the biliary system in a mouse model that mimics the hepatic phenotype of human Alagille syndrome (ALGS)2. In these mice, hepatocytes convert into mature cholangiocytes and form bile ducts that are effective in draining bile and persist after the cholestatic liver injury is reversed, consistent with transdifferentiation. These findings redefine hepatocyte plasticity, which appeared to be limited to metaplasia, that is, incomplete and transient biliary differentiation as an adaptation to cell injury, based on previous studies in mice with a fully developed biliary system3-6. In contrast to bile duct development7-9, we show that de novo bile duct formation by hepatocyte transdifferentiation is independent of NOTCH signalling. We identify TGFβ signalling as the driver of this compensatory mechanism and show that it is active in some patients with ALGS. Furthermore, we show that TGFβ signalling can be targeted to enhance the formation of the biliary system from hepatocytes, and that the transdifferentiation-inducing signals and remodelling capacity of the bile-duct-deficient liver can be harnessed with transplanted hepatocytes. Our results define the regenerative potential of mammalian transdifferentiation and reveal opportunities for the treatment of ALGS and other cholestatic liver diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2801711247,"β-arrestins are critical regulator and transducer proteins for G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). β-arrestin is widely believed to be activated by forming a stable and stoichiometric GPCR-β-arrestin scaffold complex, which requires and is driven by the phosphorylated tail of the GPCR. Here we demonstrate a distinct and additional mechanism of β-arrestin activation that does not require stable GPCR-β-arrestin scaffolding or the GPCR tail. Instead, it occurs through transient engagement of the GPCR core, which destabilizes a conserved inter-domain charge network in β-arrestin. This promotes capture of β-arrestin at the plasma membrane and its accumulation in clathrin-coated endocytic structures (CCSs) after dissociation from the GPCR, requiring a series of interactions with membrane phosphoinositides and CCS-lattice proteins. β-arrestin clustering in CCSs in the absence of the upstream activating GPCR is associated with a β-arrestin-dependent component of the cellular ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) response. These results delineate a discrete mechanism of cellular β-arrestin function that is activated catalytically by GPCRs."
https://openalex.org/W2800175679,"Despite intense interest in discovering drugs that cause G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to selectively stimulate or block arrestin signalling, the structural mechanism of receptor-mediated arrestin activation remains unclear1,2. Here we reveal this mechanism through extensive atomic-level simulations of arrestin. We find that the receptor's transmembrane core and cytoplasmic tail-which bind distinct surfaces on arrestin-can each independently stimulate arrestin activation. We confirm this unanticipated role of the receptor core, and the allosteric coupling between these distant surfaces of arrestin, using site-directed fluorescence spectroscopy. The effect of the receptor core on arrestin conformation is mediated primarily by interactions of the intracellular loops of the receptor with the arrestin body, rather than the marked finger-loop rearrangement that is observed upon receptor binding. In the absence of a receptor, arrestin frequently adopts active conformations when its own C-terminal tail is disengaged, which may explain why certain arrestins remain active long after receptor dissociation. Our results, which suggest that diverse receptor binding modes can activate arrestin, provide a structural foundation for the design of functionally selective ('biased') GPCR-targeted ligands with desired effects on arrestin signalling."
https://openalex.org/W2801019684,"Fast chemical communication in the nervous system is mediated by neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. The prototypical member of this class of cell surface receptors is the cation-selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. As with most ligand-gated ion channels, nicotinic receptors assemble as oligomers of subunits, usually as hetero-oligomers and often with variable stoichiometries 1 . This intrinsic heterogeneity in protein composition provides fine tunability in channel properties, which is essential to brain function, but frustrates structural and biophysical characterization. The α4β2 subtype of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is the most abundant isoform in the human brain and is the principal target in nicotine addiction. This pentameric ligand-gated ion channel assembles in two stoichiometries of α- and β-subunits (2α:3β and 3α:2β). Both assemblies are functional and have distinct biophysical properties, and an imbalance in the ratio of assemblies is linked to both nicotine addiction2,3 and congenital epilepsy4,5. Here we leverage cryo-electron microscopy to obtain structures of both receptor assemblies from a single sample. Antibody fragments specific to β2 were used to 'break' symmetry during particle alignment and to obtain high-resolution reconstructions of receptors of both stoichiometries in complex with nicotine. The results reveal principles of subunit assembly and the structural basis of the distinctive biophysical and pharmacological properties of the two different stoichiometries of this receptor."
https://openalex.org/W2802438942,"How our internal state is merged with our visual perception of an impending threat to drive an adaptive behavioural response is not known. Mice respond to visual threats by either freezing or seeking shelter. Here we show that nuclei of the ventral midline thalamus (vMT), the xiphoid nucleus (Xi) and nucleus reuniens (Re), represent crucial hubs in the network controlling behavioural responses to visual threats. The Xi projects to the basolateral amygdala to promote saliency-reducing responses to threats, such as freezing, whereas the Re projects to the medial prefrontal cortex (Re→mPFC) to promote saliency-enhancing, even confrontational responses to threats, such as tail rattling. Activation of the Re→mPFC pathway also increases autonomic arousal in a manner that is rewarding. The vMT is therefore important for biasing how internal states are translated into opposing categories of behavioural responses to perceived threats. These findings may have implications for understanding disorders of arousal and adaptive decision-making, such as phobias, post-traumatic stress and addictions."

https://openalex.org/W2800140232,"Several lineages of symbiotic bacteria in insects selfishly manipulate host reproduction to spread in a population 1 , often by distorting host sex ratios. Spiroplasma poulsonii2,3 is a helical and motile, Gram-positive symbiotic bacterium that resides in a wide range of Drosophila species 4 . A notable feature of S. poulsonii is male killing, whereby the sons of infected female hosts are selectively killed during development1,2. Although male killing caused by S. poulsonii has been studied since the 1950s, its underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we identify an S. poulsonii protein, designated Spaid, whose expression induces male killing. Overexpression of Spaid in D. melanogaster kills males but not females, and induces massive apoptosis and neural defects, recapitulating the pathology observed in S. poulsonii-infected male embryos5-11. Our data suggest that Spaid targets the dosage compensation machinery on the male X chromosome to mediate its effects. Spaid contains ankyrin repeats and a deubiquitinase domain, which are required for its subcellular localization and activity. Moreover, we found a laboratory mutant strain of S. poulsonii with reduced male-killing ability and a large deletion in the spaid locus. Our study has uncovered a bacterial protein that affects host cellular machinery in a sex-specific way, which is likely to be the long-searched-for factor responsible for S. poulsonii-induced male killing."
https://openalex.org/W2800801906,"The chemokine CXCL12 has been shown to regulate breast tumor growth, however, its mechanism in initiating distant metastasis is not well understood. Here, we generated a novel conditional allele of Cxcl12 in mice and used a fibroblast-specific Cre transgene along with various mammary tumor models to evaluate CXCL12 function in the breast cancer metastasis. Ablation of CXCL12 in stromal fibroblasts of mice significantly delayed the time to tumor onset and inhibited distant metastasis in different mouse models. Elucidation of mechanisms using in vitro and in vivo model systems revealed that CXCL12 enhances tumor cell intravasation by increasing vascular permeability and expansion of a leaky tumor vasculature. Furthermore, our studies revealed CXCL12 enhances permeability by recruiting endothelial precursor cells and decreasing endothelial tight junction and adherence junction proteins. High expression of stromal CXCL12 in large cohort of breast cancer patients was directly correlated to blood vessel density and inversely correlated to recurrence and overall patient survival. In addition, our analysis revealed that stromal CXCL12 levels in combination with number of CD31+ blood vessels confers poorer patient survival compared to individual protein level. However, no correlation was observed between epithelial CXCL12 and patient survival or blood vessel density. Our findings describe the novel interactions between fibroblasts-derived CXCL12 and endothelial cells in facilitating tumor cell intrvasation, leading to distant metastasis. Overall, our studies indicate that cross-talk between fibroblast-derived CXCL12 and endothelial cells could be used as novel biomarker and strategy for developing tumor microenvironment based therapies against aggressive and metastatic breast cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2801913957,"Background Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T1DM and T2DM) are caused by beta(β)-cell loss and functional impairment. Identification of mechanisms of β-cell death and therapeutic interventions to enhance β-cell survival are essential for prevention and treatment of diabetes. Oxidative stress is a common feature of both T1DM and T2DM; elevated biomarkers of oxidative stress are detected in blood, urine and tissues including pancreas of patients with DM. Islet transplantation is a promising treatment for diabetes. However, exposure to stress (chemical and mechanical) and ischemia-reperfusion during isolation and transplantation causes islet loss by generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Human intracellular antioxidant enzymes and related molecules are essential defenses against ROS. Antioxidant enzyme levels including superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) have been shown to be low in islet cells. However, little is known about the expression and function of antioxidant enzymes within islet cell subsets. We evaluated the expression of the key antioxidant enzymes in β- and alpha(α)-cell and accessed effects of oxidative stress, islet isolation and transplantation on β/α-cell ratio and viability in human islets. Methods Human pancreata from T1DM, T2DM and non-diabetic deceased donors were obtained and analyzed by confocal microscopy. Isolated islets were (I) transplanted in the renal sub-capsular space of streptozotocin-induced diabetic nude mice (in vivo bioassay), or (II) exposed to oxidative (H2O2) and nitrosative (NO donor) stress for 24 hrs in vitro. The ratio, % viability and death of β- and α-cells, and DNA damage (8OHdG) were measured. Results and conclusions Catalase and GPX expression was much lower in β- than α-cells. The β/α-cell ratio fells significantly following islet isolation and transplantation. Exposure to oxidative stress caused a significantly lower survival and viability, with higher DNA damage in β- than α-cells. These findings identified the weakness of β-cell antioxidant capacity as a main cause of vulnerability to oxidative stress. Potential strategies to enhance β-cell antioxidant capacity might be effective in prevention/treatment of diabetes."
https://openalex.org/W2799534169,"Several talent identification and development (TID) programs in soccer have implemented diagnostics to measure players' motor performance. Yet, there is a lack of research investigating the relationship between motor development in adolescence and future, adult performance. This longitudinal study analyzed the three-year development of highly talented young soccer players' speed abilities and technical skills and examined the relevance of this development to their adult success. The current research sample consisted of N = 1,134 players born between 1993 and 1995 who were selected for the German Soccer Association's TID program and participated in nationwide motor diagnostics (sprinting, agility, dribbling, ball control, shooting) four times between the Under 12 (U12) and Under 15 (U15) age class. Relative age (RA) was assessed for all players, and a total motor score was calculated based on performances in the individual tests. In order to investigate players' future success, participants were divided into two groups according to their adult performance level (APL) in the 2014/2015 season: Elite (1st-5th German division; N = 145, 12.8%) and non-elite players (lower divisions; N = 989, 87.2%). Using multilevel regression analyses each motor performance was predicted by Time, Time2 (level-1 predictors), APL, and RA (level-2 covariates) with simultaneous consideration for interaction effects between the respective variables. Time and Time2 were significant predictors for each test performance. A predictive value for RA was confirmed for sprinting and the total motor score. A significant relationship between APL and the motor score as well as between APL and agility, dribbling, ball control, and shooting emerged. Interaction effects distinctly failed to reach significance. The study found a non-linear improvement in players' performance for all considered motor performance factors over a three-year period from early to middle adolescence. While their predictive value for future success was confirmed by a significant relationship between APL and most of the considered factors, there was no significant interaction between APL and Time. These findings indicate that future elite players had already been better at the beginning of the TID program and maintained this high level throughout their promotion from U12 to U15."
https://openalex.org/W2802932711,"Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the third leading cause of cancer-related death. Therapeutic options remain very limited and are based on classical chemotherapies. Energy metabolism reprogramming appears as an emerging hallmark of cancer and is considered a therapeutic target with considerable potential. Myoferlin, a ferlin family member protein overexpressed in PDAC, is involved in plasma membrane biology and has a tumor-promoting function. In the continuity of our previous studies, we investigated the role of myoferlin in the context of energy metabolism in PDAC. We used selected PDAC tumor samples and PDAC cell lines together with small interfering RNA technology to study the role of myoferlin in energetic metabolism. In PDAC patients, we showed that myoferlin expression is negatively correlated with overall survival and with glycolytic activity evaluated by 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography. We found out that myoferlin is more abundant in lipogenic pancreatic cancer cell lines and is required to maintain a branched mitochondrial structure and a high oxidative phosphorylation activity. The observed mitochondrial fission induced by myoferlin depletion led to a decrease of cell proliferation, ATP production, and autophagy induction, thus indicating an essential role of myoferlin for PDAC cell fitness. The metabolic phenotype switch generated by myoferlin silencing could open up a new perspective in the development of therapeutic strategies, especially in the context of energy metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2802713998,"Background Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common inherited heart disease. Reported prevalence rates vary substantially between 1:500 (0.2%) and 1:3,000 (0.03%), which may be attributed to different study designs and population characteristics. Prevalence data for Germany is not available. Consequently, this study aimed (1) to quantify age- and gender-specific clinically diagnosed HCM prevalence in Germany based on the analysis of health care claims data of > 5 million insurants in 2015, and (2) to analyze temporal prevalence trends from 2011 to 2015. Methods Data were extracted from the InGef (Insitute for Applied Health Research) database, which is an anonymized healthcare claims database with longitudinal data from patients insured in one of approximately 70 German social health insurances (SHIs). Patients were classified as HCM prevalent, if they had at least one verified ambulatory or one hospital main- or secondary discharge diagnosis of HCM (I42.1 or I42.2). Results In 2015, HCM was prevalent in 4,000 out of 5,490,810 patients (0.07%; 1:1,372). HCM prevalence increased gradually with age from 7.4/100,000 persons (95% CI 5.2–10.1) in 0–9 years old to 298.7/100,000 persons (95% CI 276.4–322.4) in patients > 80 years. In all age categories, men had a numerically higher prevalence than women with significant differences in patients > 30 years. There was a gradual annual prevalence increase from 75.8 (95% CI 75.2–76.4) in 2011 to 84.2 (95% CI 83.5–84.8) in 2015 per 100,000 persons. Conclusions Overall, prevalence of clinically diagnosed HCM in Germany is lower than in systematic population studies based on echocardiographic diagnosis. Prevalence increased with advancing age and showed a constant yearly rise. Those observations may improve our understanding of the burden of this genetic heart disease on the health care system in Germany, increase the diagnostic awareness among clinicians and shape future screening and management strategies."
https://openalex.org/W2802476730,"Mechanical insults, such as stent implantation, can induce endothelial injury, vascular inflammation, and ultimately lead to vascular neointimal hyperplasia. Resolvin E1 (RvE1), derived from the ω3 fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid, can facilitate the resolution of inflammation in many settings. We therefore aimed to determine if there was a role for RvE1 in preventing neointimal formation after arterial injury and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Vascular inflammation and neointimal hyperplasia were induced by wire injury in the femoral arteries of mice. Administration of exogenous RvE1 and endogenously generated RvE1 via dietary supplementation with eicosapentaenoic acid and aspirin markedly reduced vascular neointima formation in this model. Mechanistically, RvE1 was found to inhibit vascular neutrophil infiltration, promote macrophage polarization toward an M2-like phenotype, suppress T-cell trafficking by reducing RANTES secretion from vascular smooth muscle cells, and inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell migration. In summary, RvE1 demonstrated a protective role against vascular inflammation and remodeling in response to mechanical injury, suggesting that it may serve as an adjuvant therapeutic agent for percutaneous coronary interventions, such as stent implantation.-Liu, G., Gong, Y., Zhang, R., Piao, L., Li, X., Liu, Q., Yan, S., Shen, Y., Guo, S., Zhu, M., Yin, H., Funk, C.

https://openalex.org/W2799604518,"Reactive oxygen species are well known for induction of oxidative stress conditions through oxidation of vital biomarkers leading to cellular death via apoptosis and other process, thereby causing devastative effects on the host organs. This effect is believed to be linked with pathological alterations seen in several neurodegenerative disease conditions. Many phytochemical compounds proved to have robust antioxidant activities that deterred cells against cytotoxic stress environment, thus protect apoptotic cell death. In view of that we studied the potential of glucomoringin-isothiocyanate (GMG-ITC) or moringin to mitigate the process that lead to neurodegeneration in various ways. Neuroprotective effect of GMG-ITC was performed on retinoic acid (RA) induced differentiated neuroblastoma cells (SHSY5Y) via cell viability assay, flow cytometry analysis and fluorescence microscopy by means of acridine orange and propidium iodide double staining, to evaluate the anti-apoptotic activity and morphology conservation ability of the compound. Additionally, neurite surface integrity and ultrastructural analysis were carried out by means of scanning and transmission electron microscopy to assess the orientation of surface and internal features of the treated neuronal cells. GMG-ITC pre-treated neuron cells showed significant resistance to H2O2-induced apoptotic cell death, revealing high level of protection by the compound. Increase of intracellular oxidative stress induced by H2O2 was mitigated by GMG-ITC. Thus, pre-treatment with the compound conferred significant protection to cytoskeleton and cytoplasmic inclusion coupled with conservation of surface morphological features and general integrity of neuronal cells. Therefore, the collective findings in the presence study indicated the potentials of GMG-ITC to protect the integrity of neuron cells against induced oxidative-stress related cytotoxic processes, the hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2801606942,"Objective Cognitive impairment (CI) has been described in 3–80% of Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients but only short-term studies evaluated its over-time changes, suggesting that CI is usually a stable finding. We aimed at evaluating the changes of SLE-related CI in a 10-years prospective single center cohort study. Methods We evaluated 43 patients (M/F 5/38; mean age = 45.7±10.1 years; mean disease duration = 230.8±74.3 months) at baseline (T0) and after 10 years (T1). A test battery designed to detect fronto-subcortical dysfunction across five domains (memory, attention, abstract reasoning, executive and visuospatial function) was administered. A global cognitive dysfunction score (GCD) was obtained and associated with clinical and laboratory features. Results Prevalence of CI was 20.9% at T0 and 13.9% at T1 (P = NS). This impairment was prevalently mild at T0 (55.5%) and mild or moderate at T1 (36.3% for both degrees). After 10 years, CI improved in 50% of patients, while 10% worsened. Impaired memory (P = 0.02), executive functions (P = 0.02) and abstract reasoning (P = 0.03) were associated with dyslipidemia at T0. Worsening of visuospatial functions was significantly associated with dyslipidemia and Lupus Anticoagulant (P = 0.04 for both parameters). Finally, GCD significantly correlated with chronic damage measured by SLICC/damage index at T0 (r = 0.3; P = 0.04) and T1 (r = 0.3; P = 0.03). Conclusions For the first time, we assessed CI changes over 10-years in SLE. CI improved in the majority of the patients. Furthermore, we observed an improvement of the overall cognitive functions. These results could suggest that an appropriate management of the disease during the follow-up could be able to control SLE-related CI."
https://openalex.org/W2800893296,"Aim Acute and subacute cardiotoxicity are characterized by prolongation of the corrected QT interval (QTc) and other measures derived from the QTc interval, such as QTc dispersion (QTdc) and transmural dispersion of repolarization (DTpTe). Although anthracyclines prolong the QTc interval, it is unclear whether breast cancer patients who undergo the ACT chemotherapy regimen of anthracycline (doxorubicin: A), cyclophosphamide (C) and taxane (T) may present with QTc, QTdc and DTpTe prolongation. Methods Twenty-three consecutive patients with breast cancer were followed prospectively during ACT chemotherapy and were analyzed according to their QT measurements. QTc, QTdc and DTpTe measurements were determined by a 12-lead electrocardiogram (EKG) prior to chemotherapy (baseline), immediately after the first phase of anthracycline and cyclophosphamide (AC) treatment, and immediately after T treatment. Serum troponin and B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels were also measured. Results Compared to baseline values, the QTc interval was significantly prolonged after the AC phase (439.7 ± 33.2 ms vs. 472.5 ± 36.3 ms, p = 0.001) and after T treatment (439.7 ± 33.2 ms vs. 467.9 ± 42.6 ms, p < 0.001). Troponin levels were elevated after the AC phase (23.0 pg/mL [min-max: 6.0–85.0] vs. 6.0 pg/mL [min-max: 6.0–22.0], p < 0.001) and after T treatment (25.0 pg/mL [min-max: 6.0–80.0] vs. 6.0 pg/mL [min-max: 6.0–22.0], p < 0.001) compared to baseline values. Conclusion In this prospective study of patients with non-metastatic breast cancer who underwent ACT chemotherapy, significant QTc prolongation and an elevation in serum troponin levels were observed."
https://openalex.org/W2800257759,"Background Several observational cohort and meta-analytical studies in humans have shown that statin users have a lower risk of fractures or greater bone mineral densities (BMD) than nonusers. However, some studies including randomized clinical trials have the opposite results, particularly in Asian populations. Objective This study investigates the impacts of statins on new-onset osteoporosis in Taiwan. Methods In a nationwide retrospective population-based cohort study, 45,342 subjects aged between 50–90 years having received statin therapy (statin-users) since January 1 2001, and observed through December 31 2013 were selected from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan. Likewise, 115,594 patients had no statin therapy (statin-non-users) were included as controls in this study. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards analysis for drug exposures was employed to evaluate the association between statin treatment and new-onset of osteoporosis risk. We also used the long-rank test to evaluate the difference of probability of osteoporosis-free survival. Results During the 13-year follow-up period, 16,146 of all enrolled subjects (10.03%) developed osteoporosis, including 3097 statin-users (6.83%) and 13,049 statin-non-users (11.29%). Overall, statin therapy reduced the risk of new-onset osteoporosis by 48% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.52; 95% CI 0.50 to 0.54). A dose-response relationship between statin treatment and the risk of new-onset osteoporosis was observed. The adjusted hazard ratios for new-onset osteoporosis were 0.84 (95% CI, 0.78 to 0.90), 0.56 (95% CI, 0.52 to 0.60) and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.21 to 0.25) when cumulative defined daily doses (cDDDs) ranged from 28 to 90, 91 to 365, and more than 365, respectively, relative to nonusers. Otherwise, high-potency statins (rosuvastatin and atorvastatin) and moderate-potency statin (simvastatin) seemed to have a potential protective effect for osteoporosis. Conclusions In this population-based cohort study, we found that statin use is associated with a decreased risk of osteoporosis in both genders. The osteoprotective effect of statins seemed to be more prominent with a dependency on the cumulative dosage and statin intensity."
https://openalex.org/W2800318229,"Objective This study assessed the ability of the Acute Physiologic and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score, Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, and out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) score to predict the outcome of OHCA patients who underwent therapeutic hypothermia (TH). Methods This study included OHCA patients treated with TH between January 2010 and December 2013. The APACHE II score, SAPS II, and SOFA score were calculated at the time of admission and 24 h and 48 h after intensive care unit admission. The OHCA score was calculated at the time of admission. The area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic curve and logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate outcome predictability. Results Data from a total of 173 patients were included in the analysis. The APACHE II score at 0 h and 48 h, SAPS II at 48 h, and OHCA score had moderate discrimination for mortality (AUC: 0.715, 0.750, 0.720, 0.740). For neurologic outcomes, the APACHE II score at 0 h and 48 h, SAPS II at 0 h and 48 h, and OHCA score showed moderate discrimination (AUC: 0.752, 0.738, 0.771, 0.771, 0.764). The APACHE II score, SAPS II and SOFA score at various time points, in addition to the OHCA score, were independent predictors of mortality and a poor neurologic outcome. Conclusions The APACHE II score, SAPS II, SOFA score, and OHCA score have different capabilities in discriminating and estimating hospital mortality and neurologic outcomes. The OHCA score, APACHE II score and SAPS II at time zero and 48 h offer moderate predictive accuracy.

In a microRNA screen we first identified microRNA-449a as most significantly differentially expressed between these two tumour types. miR-449a has a target dependent effect, inhibiting cell growth and migration by downregulation of CCND1 and suppressing neural phenotypes by inhibition of G protein coupled-receptor (GPR) 158. GPR158 promotes glioma stem cell differentiation and induces apoptosis and is highest expressed in the cerebral cortex and in oligodendrogliomas, lower in IDH mutant astrocytomas and lowest in the most malignant form of glioma, IDH wild-type glioblastoma. The correlation of GPR158 expression with molecular subtypes, patient survival and therapy response suggests a possible role of GPR158 as prognostic biomarker in human gliomas."
https://openalex.org/W2801298184,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, and its incidence is increasing worldwide. One method used to restore sinus rhythm is direct current cardioversion (DCCV). Despite the high success rate of DCCV, AF typically recurs within the first 2 weeks. However, our understanding of the pathophysiology of AF recurrence, incidence, and progression are highly limited. Lipidomic profiling was applied to identify altered lipids in plasma from patients with AF using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Partial least-squares discriminant analysis revealed a clear separation between AF patients and healthy controls. The levels of several lipid species, including fatty acids and phospholipids, were different between AF patients and healthy controls, indicating that oxidative stress and inflammation are associated with the pathogenesis of AF. Similar patterns were also detected between recurrent and non-recurrent AF patients. These results suggest that the elevated saturated fatty acid and reduced polyunsaturated fatty acid levels in AF patients may be associated with enhanced inflammation and that free fatty acid levels may play a crucial role in the development and progression of AF."
https://openalex.org/W2801434707,"Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic and progressive neuromuscular disorder caused by mutations and deletions in the dystrophin gene. Although there is currently no cure, one promising treatment for DMD is aimed at increasing endogenous levels of utrophin A to compensate functionally for the lack of dystrophin. Recent studies from our laboratory revealed that heparin treatment of mdx mice activates p38 MAPK, leading to an upregulation of utrophin A expression and improvements in the dystrophic phenotype. Based on these findings, we sought to determine the effects of other potent p38 activators, including the cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor celecoxib. In this study, we treated 6-wk-old mdx mice for 4 wk with celecoxib. Immunofluorescence analysis of celecoxib-treated mdx muscles revealed a fiber type switch from a fast to a slower phenotype along with beneficial effects on muscle fiber integrity. In agreement, celecoxib-treated mdx mice showed improved muscle strength. Celecoxib treatment also induced increases in utrophin A expression ranging from ∼1.5- to 2-fold in tibialis anterior diaphragm and heart muscles. Overall, these results highlight that activation of p38 in muscles can indeed lead to an attenuation of the dystrophic phenotype and reveal the potential role of celecoxib as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of DMD.-Péladeau, C., Adam, N. J., Jasmin, B. J. Celecoxib treatment improves muscle function in mdx mice and increases utrophin A expression."
https://openalex.org/W2802334156,"Tumor recurrence occurs in more than 70% of ovarian cancer patients, and the majority eventually becomes refractory to treatments. Ovarian Cancer Stem Cells (OCSCs) are believed to be responsible for the tumor relapse and drug resistance. Therefore, eliminating ovarian CSCs is important to improve the prognosis of ovarian cancer patients. However, there is a lack of effective drugs to eliminate OCSCs because the core signaling pathways regulating OCSCs remain unclear. Also it is often hard for biologists to identify a few testable targets and infer driver signaling pathways regulating CSCs from a large number of differentially expression genes in an unbiased manner. In this study, we propose a straightforward and integrative analysis to identify potential core signaling pathways of OCSCs by integrating transcriptome data of OCSCs isolated based on two distinctive markers, ALDH and side population, with regulatory network (Transcription Factor (TF) and Target Interactome) and signaling pathways. We first identify the common activated TFs in two OCSC populations integrating the gene expression and TF-target Interactome; and then uncover up-stream signaling cascades regulating the activated TFs. In specific, 22 activated TFs are identified. Through literature search validation, 15 of them have been reported in association with cancer stem cells. Additionally, 10 TFs are found in the KEGG signaling pathways, and their up-stream signaling cascades are extracted, which also provide potential treatment targets. Moreover, 40 FDA approved drugs are identified to target on the up-stream signaling cascades, and 15 of them have been reported in literatures in cancer stem cell treatment. In conclusion, the proposed approach can uncover the activated up-stream signaling, activated TFs and up-regulated target genes that constitute the potential core signaling pathways of ovarian CSC. Also drugs and drug combinations targeting on the core signaling pathways might be able to eliminate OCSCs. The proposed approach can also be applied for identifying potential activated signaling pathways of other types of cancers."
https://openalex.org/W2801433444,"The main goal of this cross-sectional study was to detect whether women with fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) have altered postural control and to study the sensory contribution to postural control. We also explored the possibility that self-induced anxiety and lower limb strength may be related to postural control. For this purpose, 129 women within an age range of 40 to 70 years were enrolled. Eighty of the enrolled women had FMS. Postural control variables, such as Ellipse, Root mean square (RMS) and Sample entropy (SampEn), in both directions (i.e. mediolateral and anteroposterior), were calculated under five different conditions. A force plate was used to register the center of pressure shifts. Furthermore, isometric lower limb strength was recorded with a portable dynamometer and normalized by lean body mass. The results showed that women with FMS have impaired postural control compared with healthy people, as they presented a significant increase in Ellipse and RMS values (p<0.05) and a significant decrease in SampEn in both directions (p<0.05). Postural control also worsens with the gradual alteration of sensory inputs in this population (p<0.05). Performing a stressor dual task only impacts Ellipse in women with FMS (p>0.05). There were no significant correlations between postural control and lower limb strength (p>0.05). Therefore, women with FMS have impaired postural control that is worse when sensory inputs are altered but is not correlated with their lower limb strength."

At entry into the cohort, a standardized medical history and extensive laboratory tests profile, including autoantibodies were completed. Follow-up occurred every 3-6 months with assessment of lupus characteristics, comorbidities, and treatment. After a mean follow-up of six-years, cross-sectional evaluation of cognitive function was done with standardized tests, and in a subset of patients an extended profile of autoantibodies, cytokines and chemokines was measured in serum and CSF.At enrollment into the cohort, patients were 26.4±8.2 years of age and lupus duration 5.3±3.7 months. Moderate/severe cognitive dysfunction was diagnosed in 16 patients; in comparison to patients with normal cognitive function, they had lower education 9 vs. 12 years (P = 0.006), higher body mass index 26.7 vs. 24.3 (P = 0.03), positive IgG anticardiolipin antibodies 50% vs 18% (P = 0.009), and a higher median number of concomitant NPSLE syndromes 3 vs. 1, (P = 0.04). The prevalence of cardiovascular-risk factors, other auto-antibodies, lupus activity, treatment, and incidence of critical events did not differ. In serum and CSF, the levels of autoantibodies, cytokines and chemokine were similar, only CCL2 was elevated in CSF [886.1 (374.9-1439.7) vs. 515.8 (3.2-1958.2) pg/mL, P = 0.04].Scant evidence of inflammation in SLE patients with cognitive dysfunction was observed.

https://openalex.org/W2801466560,"Human cancer cells display extensive heterogeneity in their sensitivities to the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade). The molecular mechanisms underlying this heterogeneity remain unclear, and strategies to overcome resistance are limited. Here, we discover that inherent differences in eIF2α phosphorylation among a panel of ten human pancreatic cancer cell lines significantly impacts bortezomib sensitivity, and implicate the HRI (heme-regulated inhibitor) eIF2α kinase as a novel therapeutic target. Within our panel, we identified a subset of cell lines with defective induction of eIF2α phosphorylation, conferring a high degree of sensitivity to bortezomib. These bortezomib-sensitive cells exhibited impaired translation attenuation followed by toxic accumulation of protein aggregates and reactive oxygen species (ROS), whereas the bortezomib-resistant cell lines displayed increased phosphorylation of eIF2α, decreased translation, few protein aggregates, and minimal ROS production. Importantly, we identified HRI as the primary bortezomib-activated eIF2α kinase, and demonstrated that HRI knockdown promoted cell death in the bortezomib-resistant cells. Overall, our data implicate inducible HRI-mediated phosphorylation of eIF2α as a central cytoprotective mechanism following exposure to bortezomib and provide proof-of-concept for the development of HRI inhibitors to overcome proteasome inhibitor resistance."

The objective of this study is to identify genomic modifications occurring in nasal carriage strains of S. aureus as they progress to bacteremia in a cohort of hospitalized patients.Eight patients with S. aureus bacteremia were identified. Genomic sequences of the bloodstream isolates were compared with 57 nasal isolates collected longitudinally prior to the occurrence of bacteremia, which covered a timespan of up to 326 days before bacteremia.Within each subject, nasal colonizing strains were closely related to bacteremia strains. Within a subject, the number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) observed between time points was greater than within a single time point. Co-colonization and strain replacement were observed in one case. In all cases colonization progressed to bacteremia without addition of new virulence genes. In one case, a mutation in the accessory gene regulator gene caused abrogation of agr function.S. aureus evolves in the human nares at a variable rate. Progression of S. aureus nasal colonization to nosocomial infection is seldom associated with acquisition of new virulence determinants. Mutation in the agr gene with abrogation of function was associated with progression to bacteremia in one case."
https://openalex.org/W2800173186,"Placenta-specific 1 (Plac1) has been found to be essential for placentation, and abnormal Plac1 expression and distribution is highly correlated with preeclampsia and implantation failure; however, its function in mammalian oocytes has not been elucidated. Here, we report that Plac1 was more prominent in mouse oocytes and enriched at the membrane region throughout meiosis. On the one hand, Plac1 knockdown severely disrupted microvillus organization; however, on the other hand, Plac1 significantly decreased oocyte maturation and increased aneuploidy, consequently disrupting normal fertilization. On the basis of immunoprecipitate matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, we established a working model, then verified and suggested that, at the germinal vesicle stage, Plac1 enriches the membrane to activate furin, and active furin subsequently activates IGF-1 receptor to maintain regular microvillus organization. Upon meiosis onset, active furin/IGF- 1 receptor relocates into the cytoplasm to activate (phosphorylate) Akt to promote meiosis. In summary, our finding suggests that Plac1, a protein that is crucial for placentation, is also essential for oocyte meiosis and fertilization.—Shi, L.-Y., Ma, Y., Zhu, G.-Y., Liu, J.-W., Zhou, C.-X., Chen, L.-J., Wang, Y., Li, R.-C., Yang, Z.-X., Zhang, D.

https://openalex.org/W2800496873,"Cell free hemoglobin impairs vascular function and blood flow in adult cardiovascular disease. In this study, we investigated the hypothesis that free fetal hemoglobin (fHbF) compromises vascular integrity and function in the fetoplacental circulation, contributing to the increased vascular resistance associated with fetal growth restriction (FGR). Women with normal and FGR pregnancies were recruited and their placentas collected freshly postpartum. FGR fetal capillaries showed evidence of erythrocyte vascular pacκing and extravasation. Fetal cord blood fHbF levels were higher in FGR than in normal pregnancies (P < 0.05) and the elevation of fHbF in relation to heme oxygenase-1 suggests a failure of expected catabolic compensation, which occurs in adults. During ex vivo placental perfusion, pathophysiological fHbF concentrations significantly increased fetal-side microcirculatory resistance (P < 0.05). fHbF sequestered NO in acute and chronic exposure models (P <0.001), and fHbF-primed placental endothelial cells developed a proinflammatory phenotype, demonstrated by activation of NF-κB pathway, generation of IL-1ä and TNF-ä (both P < 0.05), uncontrolled angiogenesis, and disruption of endothelial cell flow alignment. Elevated fHbF contributes to increased fetoplacental vascular resistance and impaired endothelial protection. This unrecognized mechanism for fetal compromise offers a novel insight into FGR as well as a potential explanation for associated poor fetal outcomes such as fetal demise and stillbirth.—Brooκ, A., Hoaκsey, A., Gurung, R., Yoong, E.

Since inflammation is one of the underlying mechanisms involved in the development of obesity-associated metabolic dysfunctions, we aimed to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with MOS on inflammation and metabolic homeostasis in lean and diet-induced obese mice. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed either a low fat diet (LFD) or a high fat diet (HFD) with, respectively, 10% or 45% energy derived from lard fat, with or without 1% MOS for 17 weeks. Body weight and composition were measured throughout the study. After 12 weeks of intervention, whole-body glucose tolerance was assessed and in week 17 immune cell composition was determined in mesenteric white adipose tissue (mWAT) and liver by flow cytometry and RT-qPCR. In LFD-fed mice, MOS supplementation induced a significant increase in the abundance of macrophages and eosinophils in mWAT. A similar trend was observed in hepatic macrophages. Although HFD feeding induced a classical shift from the anti-inflammatory M2-like macrophages towards the pro-inflammatory M1-like macrophages in both mWAT and liver from control mice, MOS supplementation had no effect on this obesity-driven immune response. Finally, MOS supplementation did not improve whole-body glucose homeostasis in both lean and obese mice.Altogether, our data showed that MOS had extra-intestinal immune modulatory properties in mWAT and liver. However these effects were not substantial enough to significantly ameliorate HFD-induced glucose intolerance or inflammation."

Empirical life history parameters (von Bertalanffy growth) are widely fitted to cross-sectional size-at-age data sampled from fish populations. This method often assumes that environmental factors affecting growth remain constant over time. The current study utilized longitudinal life history information contained in otoliths from 412 juveniles and adults of gilthead seabream, Sparus aurata, a commercially important species fished and farmed throughout the Mediterranean. Historical annual growth rates over 11 consecutive years (2002-2012) in the Gulf of Lions (NW Mediterranean) were reconstructed to investigate the effect of temperature variations on the annual growth of this fish. S. aurata growth was modelled linearly as the relationship between otolith size at year t against otolith size at the previous year t-1. The effect of temperature on growth was modelled with linear mixed effects models and a simplified linear model to be implemented in a cohort Integral Projection Model (cIPM). The cIPM was used to project S. aurata growth, year to year, under different temperature scenarios. Our results determined current increasing summer temperatures to have a negative effect on S. aurata annual growth in the Gulf of Lions. They suggest that global warming already has and will further have a significant impact on S. aurata size-at-age, with important implications for age-structured stock assessments and reference points used in fisheries."
https://openalex.org/W2802182459,"The kidney exchange programs bring new insights in the field of organ transplantation. They make the previously not allowed surgery of incompatible patient-donor pairs easier to be performed on a large scale. Mathematically, the kidney exchange is an optimization problem for the number of possible exchanges among the incompatible pairs in a given pool. Also, the optimization modeling should consider the expected quality-adjusted life of transplant candidates and the shortage of computational and operational hospital resources. In this article, we introduce a bio-inspired stochastic-based Ant Lion Optimization, ALO, algorithm to the kidney exchange space to maximize the number of feasible cycles and chains among the pool pairs. Ant Lion Optimizer-based program achieves comparable kidney exchange results to the deterministic-based approaches like integer programming. Also, ALO outperforms other stochastic-based methods such as Genetic Algorithm in terms of the efficient usage of computational resources and the quantity of resulting exchanges. Ant Lion Optimization algorithm can be adopted easily for on-line exchanges and the integration of weights for hard-to-match patients, which will improve the future decisions of kidney exchange programs.

Methods/Results Twenty-three participants performed a DS protocol. Before and after stretching, SWS was measured in the belly of the resting medial gastrocnemius muscle (MGM) using shear wave elastography. DS produced small improvements in maximum dorsiflexion (+1.5° ±1.5; mean difference ±90% confidence limits) and maximum plantarflexion (+2.3° ±1.8), a small decrease in fascicle strain (-2.6% ±4.4) and a small increase in SWS at neutral resting angle (+11.4% ±1.5). There was also a small increase in muscle thickness (+4.1mm ±2.0). Conclusions Through the use of elastography, this is the first study to suggest that DS increases muscle stiffness, decreases fascicle strain and increases muscle thickness as a result of improved RoM. These results can be beneficial to coaches, exercise and clinical scientists when choosing DS as a muscle conditioning or rehabilitation intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2802354648,"Environmental cues can influence basic perceptual and attentional processes especially in an emotional context. In the current study, we aimed to investigate the effect of a non-emotional common environmental cue-a traffic light-on a higher cognitive operation-inhibition. In two experiments, we administered a novel version of the stop-signal task, in which the go task was to determine the color of a traffic light. In order to investigate the influence of each of the cues on inhibitory processes, separate tracking procedures (one for each cue) were applied simultaneously to the stop-signal delay. In Experiment 1, we found that reaction time in no-stop-signal trials was faster when a green traffic light was present, whereas stop-signal reaction time was longer when a red traffic light was present. In Experiment 2, neutral control cues were used in addition to a red and green light. The results indicate that the differences between red and green stem from an association between the color red and stop processes (rather than from the green-go association). These results strengthen previous findings showing the effect of environmental cues on attentional processes and go beyond them by showing that the effect is not restricted to emotional cues. Most importantly, the current study results suggest that environmental cues can also influence complex cognitive operations such as inhibitory control. These results might have specific implications for our understanding of the processes that underlie specific psychiatric disorders characterized by inhibitory deficit."
https://openalex.org/W2800665778,"Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1 (SREBP-1) is a conserved transcription factor of the basic helix-loop-helix leucine zipper family (bHLH-Zip) that plays a central role in regulating expression of genes of carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism in the liver. SREBP-1 activity is essential for the control of insulin-induced anabolic processes during the fed state. In addition, SREBP-1 regulates expression of key molecules in the insulin signaling pathway, including insulin receptor substrate 2 (IRS2) and a subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) complex, PIK3R3, suggesting that feedback mechanisms exist between SREBP-1 and this pathway. Nevertheless, the overall contribution of SREBP-1 activity to maintain insulin signal transduction is unknown. Furthermore, Akt is a known activator of mTORC1, a sensor of energy availability that plays a fundamental role in metabolism, cellular growth and survival. We have silenced SREBP-1 and explored the impact on insulin signaling and mTOR in mice under fed, fasted and refed conditions. No alterations in circulating levels of insulin were observed. The studies revealed that depletion of SREBP-1 had no impact on IRS1Y612, AktS473, and downstream effectors GSK3αS21 and FoxO1S256 during the fed state. Nevertheless, reduced levels of these molecules were observed under fasting conditions. These effects were not associated with changes in phosphorylation of mTOR. Overall, our data indicate that the contribution of SREBP-1 to maintain insulin signal transduction in liver is modest."

We designed a benefit-risk and cost assessment of oral anticoagulants. Design We followed the roadmap proposed by IMI-PROTECT and the considerations of emerged good practice to perform Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA). The roadmap defines the following steps: (1) planning, (2) evidence gathering and data preparation, (3) analyses, (4) explorations, and (5) conclusions. We defined two reference points (0–100) to allocate numerical values for scores and weights, and used an analogue numeric scale to assess physicians’ preferences. As benefits of the anticoagulant therapy, we included reductions in stroke and all-cause mortality; intracranial haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, minor bleeding and myocardial infarction were considered risks. We also made an estimation of the annual drug cost per person. Main results The scores were: Apixaban 33, Dabigatrán 25, warfarin 18 and Rivaroxaban 14 this score reveals the most preferred up to the less preferred option, considering the benefit-risk ratio and drug costs altogether. The relative model weights were: 51.1% for risks, 40.4% for benefits and 8.5% for cost. The sensitivity analysis confirms the model robustness. Conclusions From this analysis, apixaban should be considered as the preferred anticoagulant option -due to a better benefit-risk balance and a minor cost influence- followed by dabigatran, warfarin and rivaroxaban."

Organophosphorus mineralization regulated by microbial alkaline phosphatase provides available nutrients for bloom regeneration. To uncover the dynamics of bacterial alkaline phosphatase activity and microbial backgrounds in relation to organophosphorus mineralization during the decomposition process of cyanobacterial blooms, the response of alkaline phosphatase PhoX-producing bacteria were explored using a 23-day mesocosm experiment with three varying densities of Microcystis biomass from eutrophic Lake Taihu. Our study found large amounts of soluble reactive phosphorus and dissolved organophosphorus were released into the lake water during the decomposition process. Bacterial alkaline phosphatase activity showed the peak values during days 5~7 in groups with different chlorophyll-a densities, and then all decreased dramatically to their initial experimental levels during the last stage of decomposition. Bacterial phoX abundances in the three experimental groups increased significantly along with the decomposition process, positively related to the dissolved organic carbon and organophosphorus released by the Microcystis blooms. The genotypes similar to the phoX genes of Alphaproteobacteria were dominant in all groups, whereas the genotypes most similar to the phoX genes of Betaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria were also abundant in the low density (~15 μg L-1 chlorophyll-a) group. At the end of the decomposition process, the number of genotypes most similar to the phoX of Betaproteobacteria and Cyanobacteria increased in the medium (~150 μg L-1 chlorophyll-a) and high (~1500 μg L-1 chlorophyll-a) density groups. The released organophosphorus and increased bacterial phoX abundance after decomposition of Microcystis aggregates could potentially provide sufficient nutrients and biological conditions for algal proliferation and are probably related to the regeneration of Microcystis blooms in eutrophic lakes."

And their cellular responses of MG63 were investigated compared with Sandblast and acid-etching (SLA) surface. Scanning electron microscope (SEM), Surface profiler, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and Contact angle instrument were employed to assess the surface morphologies, roughness, chemistry and wettability respectively. Hierarchical structures with micro holes of 10–30 μm in diameter and nano pits of tens of nanometers in diameter formed on both E and SE surfaces. The size of micro holes is very close to osteoblast cell, which makes them wonderful beds for osteoblast. Moreover, these two kinds of surfaces possess similar roughness and superior hydrophilicity to SLA. Reactive oxygen species were detected on E and SE surface, and thus considerable antimicrobial performance and well fixation can be speculated on them. The cell experiments also demonstrated a boost in cell attachment, and that proliferation and osteogenic differentiation were achieved on them, especially on SE surface.

Methods A cross-sectional study was undertaken of 1680 patients presenting to Westmead Hospital (Sydney, Australia) for evaluation of potential CAD. Baseline digital retinal photographs, cardiovascular risk factor measurements, fasting blood tests and self-reported diabetes by patient questionnaire was recorded. Extent and severity of CAD was assessed using Extent and Gensini scores from angiography findings, respectively. Multivariate analysis including age and hypertension was undertaken to assess the association between retinal vessel calibre and IFG or DM. Results A total of 748 patients were included; 96 (12.8%) and 189 (25.3%), respectively, had IFG or DM (together termed ‘hyperglycaemia’). No consistent association between hyperglycaemia and retinal arteriolar calibre was apparent. Wider retinal venular calibre (second and third tertile) carried a significantly higher odds of DM in men only (multivariable-adjusted OR 2.447, p = 0.005; and OR 2.76, p = 0.002; respectively). No equivalent association was apparent in women. This association was marginally significant (p = 0.08) in patients with CAD Extent scores below the median (i.e. less diffuse CAD). Retinal vessel calibre was not associated with impaired fasting glucose. Conclusions This study reports a significant association between retinal venular widening and diabetes mellitus in men. This association was marginally stronger among participants with less diffuse CAD."
https://openalex.org/W2802765173,"Background Aortic stiffness assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (CF-PWV) is a predictor of mortality in several populations. However, little is known in kidney transplant recipients. Our objectives were to evaluate the ability of CF-PWV measured 3 months following transplantation to predict mortality, graft loss and its potential links to measured Glomerular Filtration Rate (mGFR) or kidney graft microvasculature parameters. Methods The study is based on a monocentric retrospective cohort including 220 adult kidney graft recipients evaluated three months after transplantation. CF-PWV measures, clinical, laboratory and histological data performed at 3 (M3) and 12 months (M12) following transplantation were retrospectively collected. The two primary endpoints were all-cause mortality and occurrence of end stage renal disease (ESRD) defined by initiation of dialysis. Results After a median follow up of 5.5 years [1.9; 8.8], death and graft loss occurred in 10 and 12 patients respectively. M3 CF-PWV was an independent mortality risk factor (HR = 1.29 [1.03; 1.61]; p = 0.03), despite no aortic stiffness variation during the first year of transplantation. Of notice, M3 CF-PWV was not associated with M12 mGFR or ESRD outcome. Graft microcirculation assessed by Banff vascular fibrous intimal thickening score (cv) worsened between M3 and M12 (p = 0.01), but no link was found with CF-PWV, mGFR or ESRD outcome. Surprisingly, acute rejections at M3 were associated after adjustment with mortality (p = 0.03) but not ESRD. Conclusion Aortic stiffness measured 3 months after kidney transplantation is a strong predictor of mortality with no obvious influence on kidney graft microvasculature or graft loss."

The phosphorylation of SLC11A1 is almost completely blocked by treatment with PP2, a selective inhibitor of Src family kinases. Furthermore, we found that SLC11A1 is a direct substrate for active c-Src kinase and siRNA-mediated knockdown of cellular Src (c-Src) expression results in a significant decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation. We found that PMA induces the interaction of SLC11A1 with c-Src kinase. We demonstrated that SLC11A1 is phosphorylated by Src family kinases at tyrosine 15 and this type of phosphorylation is required for SLC11A1-mediated modulation of NF-κB activation and nitric oxide (NO) production induced by LPS. Our results demonstrate important roles for c-Src tyrosine kinase in phosphorylation and activation of SLC11A1 in macrophages."

SUPER-H168 were investigated by real-time quantitative PCR when various carbohydrates, including glucose, sucrose, maltose, amylose, amylopectin and corn flour, were used as carbon source. Genes, including an α-glucosidase gene Amy33 (2997 bp), an α-amylase gene Amy365-1 (1749 bp) and a glycogen debranching enzyme gene Amy130 (2487 bp), were overexpressed, and four overexpression transformants were constructed, respectively. When Amy365-1 and Amy130 were co-overexpressed, relative expression levels of seven hypocrellin biosynthesis genes and four related genes in central carbon catabolism were all increased. Expression of Amy33 was also increased along with increase of Amy365-1 and Amy130. Under liquid state fermentation, biomasses and hypocrellin productions were both gradually increased in four overexpression strains than those of wild type strain. Under SSF, hypocrellin production of Amy365-1 and Amy130 co-expression strain reached 71.85 mg/gds, which was 2.83 fold than that of wild type strain, and residual sugar was decreased from 35.47% to 16.68%. These results can provide a practical approach for other secondary metabolites by filamentous fungi under SSF when raw starch material is used as carbon source."
https://openalex.org/W2802088743,"The impact of children’s interactions with parents in the context of out-of-home placements is receiving much-needed cross-disciplinary attention. However, the paucity of instruments that can reliably represent young children’s experiences of such interactions precludes a nuanced evaluation of their impact on wellbeing and development. In response to this empirical gap, the present study investigates children’s relational withdrawal as a clinically salient, easily observable and conceptually valid measure of infants’ and toddlers’ responses to parents. Relational withdrawal, challenging behaviors and salivary cortisol were assessed before, during and after parental visits. Conceptually, the findings suggest that observations of relational withdrawal correlate meaningfully with measure of neurobiological reactivity. Clinically, three profiles of cross-variable responses in children appeared, distinguishing between groups that experience increased, decreased or unchanged levels of stress in response to parental visits. Taken together, the findings lend empirical support to systematic observations of relational withdrawal to bolster evaluations of young children’s experience of parental visitation during out-of-home placements."
https://openalex.org/W2802057120,"To plan experiments, a biologist needs to evaluate a growing set of empirical findings and hypothetical assertions from diverse fields that use increasingly complex techniques. To address this problem, we operationalized principles (e.g., convergence and consistency) that biologists use to test causal relations and evaluate experimental evidence. With the framework we derived, we then created a free, open-source web application that allows biologists to create research maps, graph-based representations of empirical evidence and hypothetical assertions found in research articles, reviews, and other sources. With our ResearchMaps web application, biologists can systematically reason through the research that is most important to them, as well as evaluate and plan experiments with a breadth and precision that are unlikely without such a tool."
