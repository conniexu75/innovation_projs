https://openalex.org/W3178627911,"We provide an assessment of the impact of government closure and containment measures on deaths from COVID-19 across sequential waves of the COVID-19 pandemic globally. Daily data was collected on a range of containment and closure policies for 186 countries from January 1, 2020 until March 11th, 2021. These data were combined into an aggregate stringency index (SI) score for each country on each day (range: 0-100). Countries were divided into successive waves via a mathematical algorithm to identify peaks and troughs of disease. Within our period of analysis, 63 countries experienced at least one wave, 40 countries experienced two waves, and 10 countries saw three waves, as defined by our approach. Within each wave, regression was used to assess the relationship between the strength of government stringency and subsequent deaths related to COVID-19 with a number of controls for time and country-specific demographic, health system, and economic characteristics. Across the full period of our analysis and 113 countries, an increase of 10 points on the SI was linked to 6 percentage points (P < 0.001, 95% CI = [5%, 7%]) lower average daily deaths. In the first wave, in countries that ultimately experiences 3 waves of the pandemic to date, ten additional points on the SI resulted in lower average daily deaths by 21 percentage points (P < .001, 95% CI = [8%, 16%]). This effect was sustained in the third wave with reductions in deaths of 28 percentage points (P < .001, 95% CI = [13%, 21%]). Moreover, interaction effects show that government policies were effective in reducing deaths in all waves in all groups of countries. These findings highlight the enduring importance of non-pharmaceutical responses to COVID-19 over time."
https://openalex.org/W3179835754,"Synthetic fibers are increasingly seen to dominate microplastic pollution profiles in aquatic environments, with evidence pointing to textiles as a potentially important source. However, the loss of microfibers from textiles during laundry is poorly understood. We evaluated microfiber release from a variety of synthetic and natural consumer apparel textile samples (n = 37), with different material types, constructions, and treatments during five consecutive domestic laundry cycles. Microfiber loss ranged from 9.6 mg to 1,240 mg kg-1 of textile per wash, or an estimated 8,809 to > 6,877,000 microfibers. Mechanically-treated polyester samples, dominated by fleeces and jerseys, released six times more microfibers (161 ± 173 mg kg-1 per wash) than did nylon samples with woven construction and filamentous yarns (27 ± 14 mg kg-1 per wash). Fiber shedding was positively correlated with fabric thickness for nylon and polyester. Interestingly, cotton and wool textiles also shed large amounts of microfibers (165 ± 44 mg kg-1 per wash). The similarity between the average width of textile fibers here (12.4 ± 4.5 μm) and those found in ocean samples provides support for the notion that home laundry is an important source of microfiber pollution. Evaluation of two marketed laundry lint traps provided insight into intervention options for the home, with retention of up to 90% for polyester fibers and 46% for nylon fibers. Our observation of a > 850-fold difference in the number of microfibers lost between low and high shedding textiles illustrates the strong potential for intervention, including more sustainable clothing design."

Consequently, environmental exposures, including air pollution, have been hypothesized to contribute to the etiology of neurodegeneration. Because persistently elevated rates of AD mortality in the southern Piedmont area of North Carolina (NC) have been documented, we studied mortality and hospital admissions for AD, non-AD dementia, and PD in residential populations aged 65+ with long-term exposures to elevated levels of ambient air particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5) exceeding the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality standards (≥10μg/m3). Health data were obtained from the State Center for Health Statistics and the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project. PM2.5 levels were obtained from the MODIS/MISR and SeaWiFS datafiles. Residents in the Study group of elevated air particulate matter (87 zip codes with PM2.5≥10μg/m3) were compared to the residents in the Control group with low levels of air particulate matter (81 zip codes with PM2.5≤7.61μg/m3), and were found to have higher age-adjusted rates of mortality and hospital admissions for AD, non-AD dementia, and PD, including a most pronounced increase in AD mortality (323/100,000 vs. 257/100,000, respectively). After adjustment for multiple co-factors, the risk of death (odds ratio, or OR) from AD in the Study group (OR = 1.35, 95%CI[1.24-1.48]) was significantly higher than ORs of non-AD dementia or PD (OR = 0.97, 95%CI[0.90-1.04] and OR = 1.13, 95%CI[0.92-1.31]). The OR of hospital admissions was significantly increased only for AD as a primary case of hospitalization (OR = 1.54, 95%CI[1.31-1.82]). Conclusion: NC residents aged 65+ with long-term exposures to ambient PM2.5 levels exceeding the WHO standard had significantly increased risks of death and hospital admissions for AD. The effects for non-AD dementia and PD were less pronounced."
https://openalex.org/W3182707437,"Recognizing the importance of road infrastructure to promote human health and economic development, actors around the globe are regularly investing in both new roads and road improvements. However, in many contexts there is a sparsity—or complete lack—of accurate information regarding existing road infrastructure, challenging the effective identification of where investments should be made. Previous literature has focused on overcoming this gap through the use of satellite imagery to detect and map roads. In this piece, we extend this literature by leveraging satellite imagery to estimate road quality and concomitant information about travel speed. We adopt a transfer learning approach in which a convolutional neural network architecture is first trained on data collected in the United States (where data is readily available), and then “fine-tuned” on an independent, smaller dataset collected from Nigeria. We test and compare eight different convolutional neural network architectures using a dataset of 53,686 images of 2,400 kilometers of roads in the United States, in which each road segment is measured as “low”, “middle”, or “high” quality using an open, cellphone-based measuring platform. Using satellite imagery to estimate these classes, we achieve an accuracy of 80.0%, with 99.4% of predictions falling within the actual or an adjacent class. The highest performing base model was applied to a preliminary case study in Nigeria, using a dataset of 1,000 images of paved and unpaved roads. By tailoring our US-model on the basis of this Nigeria-specific data, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 94.0% in predicting the quality of Nigerian roads. A continuous case estimate also showed the ability, on average, to predict road quality to within 0.32 on a 0 to 3 scale (with higher values indicating higher levels of quality)."
https://openalex.org/W3182568060,"Symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi are ecologically important for medicinal and aromatic plants. Endophytic fungi highly affect the quantity and quality of herbal products. In this study, a pot experiment was carried out in the greenhouse to investigate the interactive effects of Piriformospora indica and arbuscular mycorrhizal (AMF) inoculation on the chlorophyll fluorescence, essential oil composition, and antioxidant enzymes of peppermint under saline condition. The results showed that Fo, YNPQ, YNO, and NPQ values were obviously increased under salinity conditions, while essential oil content, chlorophyll a and b, gs, Fm, Fv, ETR, ФPSII and Fv/Fm ratio decreased by increasing salinity. In addition, salt induced the excess Na + uptake, whereas the opposite trend was observed for P and K + . The synergistic association of P . indica and AMF caused a considerable increase in the antioxidant ability, essential oil content, Fv/Fm ratio, ФPSII, and amount of P and K + uptake in salt-stressed plants. The main peppermint oil constituents, menthol, menthone, and 1,8-cineole increased considerably in inoculated plants. Besides, the applied endophytic fungi positively enhanced the ability of peppermint to alleviate the negative effect of the salinity stress."
https://openalex.org/W3180872358,"Pundits and academics across disciplines note that the human toll brought forth by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in the United States (U.S.) is fundamentally unequal for communities of color. Standing literature on public health posits that one of the chief predictors of racial disparity in health outcomes is a lack of institutional trust among minority communities. Furthermore, in our own county-level analysis from the U.S., we find that counties with higher percentages of Black and Hispanic residents have had vastly higher cumulative deaths from COVID-19. In light of this standing literature and our own analysis, it is critical to better understand how to mitigate or prevent these unequal outcomes for any future pandemic or public health emergency. Therefore, we assess the claim that raising institutional trust, primarily scientific trust, is key to mitigating these racial inequities. Leveraging a new, pre-pandemic measure of scientific trust, we find that trust in science, unlike trust in politicians or the media, significantly raises support for COVID-19 social distancing policies across racial lines. Our findings suggest that increasing scientific trust is essential to garnering support for public health policies that lessen the severity of the current, and potentially a future, pandemic."
https://openalex.org/W3178720314,"Autosomal dominant optic atrophy is one of the most common inherited optic neuropathies. This disease is genetically heterogeneous, but most cases are due to pathogenic variants in the OPA1 gene: depending on the population studied, 32–90% of cases harbor pathogenic variants in this gene. The aim of this study was to provide a comprehensive overview of the entire spectrum of likely pathogenic variants in the OPA1 gene in a large cohort of patients. Over a period of 20 years, 755 unrelated probands with a diagnosis of bilateral optic atrophy were referred to our laboratory for molecular genetic investigation. Genetic testing of the OPA1 gene was initially performed by a combined analysis using either single-strand conformation polymorphism or denaturing high performance liquid chromatography followed by Sanger sequencing to validate aberrant bands or melting profiles. The presence of copy number variations was assessed using multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification. Since 2012, genetic testing was based on next-generation sequencing platforms. Genetic screening of the OPA1 gene revealed putatively pathogenic variants in 278 unrelated probands which represent 36.8% of the entire cohort. A total of 156 unique variants were identified, 78% of which can be considered null alleles. Variant c.2708_2711del/p.(V903Gfs*3) was found to constitute 14% of all disease-causing alleles. Special emphasis was placed on the validation of splice variants either by analyzing cDNA derived from patients´ blood samples or by heterologous splice assays using minigenes. Splicing analysis revealed different aberrant splicing events, including exon skipping, activation of exonic or intronic cryptic splice sites, and the inclusion of pseudoexons. Forty-eight variants that we identified were novel. Nine of them were classified as pathogenic, 34 as likely pathogenic and five as variant of uncertain significance. Our study adds a significant number of novel variants to the mutation spectrum of the OPA1 gene and will thereby facilitate genetic diagnostics of patients with suspected dominant optic atrophy."
https://openalex.org/W3181673878,"Context Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a severe hematological disorder. The most common acute complication of SCD is vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), but SCD is a systemic disease potentially involving all organs. SCD prevalence estimates rely mostly on extrapolations from incidence-based newborn screening programs, although recent improvements in survival may have led to an increase in prevalence, and immigration could account for a substantial number of prevalent patients in Europe. The primary objective of this study was to estimate SCD prevalence in France. Methods A cross-sectional observational study was conducted using a representative sample of national health insurance data. SCD patients followed up in France between 2006 and 2011 were captured through hydroxyurea reimbursement and with the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10) SCD specific code D570.1.2, excluding code D573 (which corresponds to sickle cell trait (SCT)). Nevertheless, we assumed that ICD-10 diagnosis coding for inpatient stays could be imperfect, with the possibility of SCT being miscoded as SCD. Therefore, prevalence was analyzed in two groups of patients [with at least one (G1) or two (G2) inpatient stay ] based on the number of SCD-related inpatient stays in the six-year study period, assuming that SCT patients are rarely rehospitalized compared to SCD. The prevalence of SCD in the sample, which was considered to be representative of the French population, was then extrapolated to the general population. The rate of vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) events was estimated based on hospitalizations, emergencies, opioid reimbursements, transfusions, and sick leave. Results Based on the number of patients identified for G1 and G2, the 2016 French prevalence was estimated to be between 48.6 per 100,000 (G1) or 32,400 patients and 29.7 per 100,000 (G2) or 19,800 patients. An average of 1.51 VOC events per year were identified, with an increase frequency of 15 to 24 years of age. The average annual number of hospitalizations was between 0.70 (G1) and 1.11 (G2) per patient. Intensive care was observed in 7.6% of VOC-related hospitalizations. Fewer than 34% of SCD patients in our sample received hydroxyurea at any point in their follow-up. The annual average cost of SCD care is €5,528.70 (G1) to €6,643.80 (G2), with most costs arising from hospitalization and lab testing. Conclusion Our study estimates SCD prevalence in France at between 19,800 and 32,400 patients in 2016, higher than previously published. This study highlights the significant disease burden associated with vaso-occlusive events."
https://openalex.org/W3177821975,"Environmental properties are important factors in structuring soil microbial communities. The primary driving factors vary in different ecosystems. In the present work, we analyzed the microbial communities of rhizosphere and bulk soils associated with the halophyte Alhagi sparsifolia across three salt/water gradients in the desert area around Ebinur Lake Basin, China, using high-throughput sequencing technology. We found that there were significant differences in soil water content (SWC), soil salinity (SAL), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP) contents between the three water/salt gradients. In the L (low water and salt) plot, Actinobacteria was the most abundant bacterial phylum while Ascomycota was the dominant fungal phylum. The relative abundance of Actinobacteria was negatively correlated with soil pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), TP, and available phosphorus (AP). The abundance of Bacteroidetes was significantly positively correlated with soil SOC, SWC, SAL, pH, TN, and TP (P < 0.05). The abundance of fungal phylum Chytridiomycota was significantly positively correlated with pH (P < 0.01), SWC, AP, and sulfate ion (P < 0.05). SOC and nitrate nitrogen were the main factors impacting the bacterial community, while ammonium nitrogen (NH4+) and TP were the main driving forces for the fungal community. Soil nutrients were the main contributors to the dissimilarities in the bacterial and fungal communities, explaining 48.06% and 44.45% of the variation. SWC, SAL, and pH explained only a small percentage of the microbial community dissimilarity. In conclusion, soil microbial community structure was affected by SWC, SAL, pH, and soil nutrients, with soil nutrients as the main driving factors. Nitrogen has a differential effect on the different microbial communities: bacterial communities of Alhagi sparsifolia were mainly affected by nitrate nitrogen, while fungal communities were mainly driven by ammonium nitrogen."
https://openalex.org/W3178957061,"Based on a communication-centered approach, this article examines how researchers approach societal impact, that is, what they think about societal impact in research governance, what their societal goals are, and how they use communication formats. Hence, this study offers empirical evidence on a group that has received remarkably little attention in the scholarly discourse on the societal impact of research-academic researchers. Our analysis is based on an empirical survey among 499 researchers in Germany conducted from April to June 2020. We show that most researchers regard societal engagement as part of their job and are generally in favor of impact evaluation. However, few think that societal impact is a priority at their institution, and even fewer think that institutional communication departments reach relevant stakeholders in society. Moreover, we show that researchers' societal goals and use of communication formats differ greatly between their disciplines and the types of organization that they work at. Our results add to the ongoing metascientific discourse on the relationship between science and society and offer empirical support for the hypothesis that assessment needs to be sensitive to disciplinary and organizational context factors."
https://openalex.org/W3179829399,"The Dunkin Hartley is the most common guinea pig strain used in biomedical research, particularly for studies of asthma, allergy, infectious disease, reproduction, and osteoarthritis. Minimally invasive blood tests, such as complete blood counts and serum biochemistry profiles, are often collected for diagnostics and laboratory analyses. However, reference intervals for these assays have not yet been well-documented in this strain. The purpose of this study was to establish reference intervals for hematologic and biochemical parameters of Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs and determine age- and sex-related differences. Hematologic and biochemical parameters were retrospectively obtained from 145 male and 68 female guinea pigs between 2 and 15 months of age. All blood parameters were analyzed by a veterinary clinical pathology laboratory. Reference intervals were established according to the American Society for Veterinary Clinical Pathology guidelines. Age- and sex-related differences were determined using unpaired t-tests or nonparametric Mann-Whitney tests. Hematocrit, red blood cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, white blood cell count, heterophils, monocytes, eosinophils, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, calcium, magnesium, total protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, aspartate aminotransferase, gamma glutamyl transferase, and bicarbonate increased with age. Mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, cellular hemoglobin concentration mean, platelets, lymphocytes, phosphorus, albumin/globulin ratio, alkaline phosphatase, anion gap, and calculated osmolality decreased with age. Males had higher hemoglobin, hematocrit, red blood cell count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration, white blood cell count, heterophils, Foa-Kurloff cells, alanine aminotransferase, and bicarbonate and lower mean corpuscular volume, red blood cell distribution width, platelets, mean platelet volume, eosinophils, total protein, albumin, globulin, cholesterol, potassium, anion gap, calculated osmolality, and iron compared to females. Establishing age and sex differences in hematologic and biochemical parameters of Dunkin Hartley guinea pigs provides valuable insight into their physiology to better evaluate diagnostics and experimental results."
https://openalex.org/W3182632749,"To investigate any associations between cigarette smoking and retinal microvascular changes in diabetic patients without visible retinopathy.Retrospective, cross-sectional study.1099 eyes from 1099 diabetic patients with no clinical evidence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) were included in this study.Diabetic patients underwent optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) scanning at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital and Trauma Center between April 2018 and September 2019. Patient demographic and clinical information was collected. Standard bivariate statistics and multivariate linear regression were performed.OCTA parameters included metrics related to the foveal avascular zone (FAZ; area, perimeter, circularity), perfusion density (PD; full, center, inner), and vessel length density (VLD; full, center, inner).The study population included 750 non-smokers and 349 smokers. FAZ perimeter was the only OCTA parameter that was significantly different between the two groups on uncontrolled analysis (P = 0.033). Multivariate regression analyses revealed significant associations between lower VLD full (β = -0.31, P = 0.048), lower VLD inner (β = -0.35, P = 0.046) and a history of smoking. No significant associations between cigarette smoking and either FAZ or PD were detected.Our results suggest that smoking is likely associated with deleterious changes in the retinal microvasculature of patients with a history of diabetes and no visible DR. Based on these findings, diabetic patients with a history of smoking may benefit from higher prioritization in terms of ophthalmic screening."
https://openalex.org/W3182947911,"Protected areas in Malaysia have always been managed using top-down approach that often exclude the local communities, who are the main users of ecosystem services, from the planning and management. However, a newly established multiple-use marine park in Malaysia, Tun Mustapha Park (TMP), aims for inclusivity in managing the park. This research explores different participatory approaches (i.e. participatory mapping and Photovoice) to understand the ecosystem services and the dynamics surrounding the services in TMP. Community-based organisations and a mariculture farm in TMP were invited to participate in this work. The participants mapped the ecosystem services and provided in-depth qualitative data that supported the maps, besides highlighting ecological, sociocultural and economic issues surrounding the ecosystem services. Furthermore, the participants provided suggestions and recommendations that carry political effects. Therefore, the participatory approaches employed here had provided rich visual and spatial data to enhance the ecosystem-based management of TMP besides empowering the participants to voice out for their communities. The results generated from this work were also further utilised to fill in the gaps of knowledge in a separate ecosystem service assessment matrix. However, the output from participatory approaches should not be considered as the ultimate outcome but rather as supplement to the planning and management of TMP due to potential human errors and biases. Although the participatory approaches came with limitations and challenges that may have affected the findings here, these nonetheless had provided support to the capability of local communities to provide information crucial for management of protected areas as well as room for improvement for further work."
https://openalex.org/W3178169371,"The adaptation of interventions for new contexts is a rapidly developing research area. To date there is no consensus-based guidance to support decision-making and recommend adaptation processes. The ADAPT study is developing such guidance. This aim of the qualitative component of the study was to explore stakeholders' understandings of adaptation, as to date there has limited consideration of how different concepts and meanings shape decision-making and practice.A case study research design was used. Participants/cases were purposefully sampled based on study outcome, study design, expertise, context and country. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of researchers (n = 23); representatives from research funding panels (n = 6); journal editors (n = 5) and practitioners (n = 3). Data were analysed using the Framework approach. Overarching themes were discussed with the ADAPT study team, with further iterative refinement of subthemes.The results generated four central themes. Four themes related to stakeholders' understanding: 1) definitions of adaptation and related concepts; 2) rationales for undertaking adaptation; 3) the appropriate timing for adaptation; and 4) ensuring fidelity when implementing adapted interventions.The findings highlight the lack of clarity around key concepts and uncertainty about central decision-making processes, notably why interventions should be adapted, when and to what extent. This has informed the ADAPT study's guidance, shaping the scope and nature of recommendations to be included and surfacing key uncertainties that require future consideration."
https://openalex.org/W3178797919,"Conidia of Aspergillus fumigatus are inhaled by humans on daily basis. As a consequence, these conidia can cause infections that differ in severity ranging from allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis to invasive aspergillosis. In this study we compared virulence of five A. fumigatus isolates in four different infection models to address the predictive value of different model systems. Two of the A. fumigatus strains were isolated from dogs with a non-invasive sino-nasal aspergillosis (DTO271-B5 and DTO303-F3), while three strains were isolated from human patients with invasive aspergillosis (Af293, ATCC46645 and CEA10). Infection models used encompassed cultured type II A549 lung epithelial cells, Protostelium aurantium amoeba, Galleria melonella larvae and zebrafish embryos. No major differences in virulence between these five strains were observed in the lung epithelial cell model. In contrast, strain ATCC46645 was most virulent in the amoeba and zebrafish model, whereas it was much less virulent in the Galleria infection model. DTO303-F3 was most virulent in the latter model. In general, reference strain Af293 was less virulent as compared to the other strains. Genome sequence analysis showed that this latter strain differed from the other four strains in 136 SNPs in virulence-related genes. Together, our results show that virulence of individual A. fumigatus strains show significant differences between infection models. We conclude that the predictive value of different model systems varies since the relative virulence across fungal strains does not hold up across different infection model systems."
https://openalex.org/W3178977520,"Background To determine the impact of health care interruption (HCI), on clinical status of the patients reincorporated to an outpatient clinic for rheumatic diseases (OCDIR), from a tertiary care level center who was temporally switched to a dedicated COVID-19 hospital, and to provide a bioethical analysis. Methods From March to June 2020, the OCDIR was closed; since June, it is limited to evaluate 25% of the ongoing outpatients. This cross-sectional study surveyed 670 consecutive rheumatic outpatients between June 24 th and October 31 th , concomitant to the assessment of the rheumatic disease clinical status by the attendant rheumatologist, according to disease activity level, clinical deterioration and adequate/inadequate control. Multiple logistic regression analysis identified factors associated to HCI and to clinical deterioration. Results Patients were middle-aged females (86.7%), with median disease duration of 10 years, comorbidity (38.5%) and 138 patients (20.6%) had discontinued treatment. Primary diagnoses were SLE and RA, in 285 (42.5%) and 223 (33.3%) patients, respectively. There were 344 patients (51.3%) with HCI. Non-RA diagnosis (OR: 2.21, 95%CI: 1.5–3.13), comorbidity (OR: 1.7, 95%CI: 1.22–2.37), patient’s need for rheumatic care during HCI (OR: 3.2, 95%CI: 2.06–4.97) and adequate control of the rheumatic disease (OR: 0.64, 95%CI: 0.45–0.9) were independently associated to HCI. There were 160 patients (23.8%) with clinical deterioration and associated factors were disease duration, substantial disease activity previous HCI, patients need for rheumatic care and treatment discontinuation. Conclusions HCI during COVID-19 pandemic impacted course of rheumatic diseases and need to be considered in the bioethical analysis of virus containment measures."
https://openalex.org/W3181878559,"Unintended pregnancy is an important global health problem and frequently occurs during the immediate postpartum period. However, few studies have examined postpartum family planning (PPFP) intentions among adolescent girls and young women. This study assessed whether perceived norms and personal agency predicted PPFP intentions among first-time mothers age 15–24 in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of Congo. Data were derived from the 2018 Momentum Project baseline survey. Analysis was based on 2,418 nulliparous pregnant women age 15–24 who were approximately six months pregnant with their first child in six health zones of Kinshasa. Overall PPFP intentions were low and ten to thirteen percent of women stated they were very likely to discuss PPFP next month with (a) their husband/male partner and (b) a health worker, and to (c) obtain and (d) use a contraceptive method during the first six weeks following childbirth. The results of multivariable linear regression models indicated that the PPFP intention index was predicted by description norms, perceptions of the larger community’s approval of PPFP, normative expectations, perceived behavioral control, self-efficacy, and autonomy. Rejection of family planning myths and misconceptions was also a significant predictor. Interaction terms suggested that the association of normative expectations with PPFP intentions varied across ethnic groups and that the positive association of injunctive norms with PPFP intentions was significantly increased when the larger community was perceived to disapprove of PPFP use. Normative expectations and PPFP-related self-efficacy accounted for two-thirds of the variance in PPFP intentions. The results suggested that understanding different normative influences may be important to motivate women to use contraception in the immediate postpartum period. In addition to addressing institutional, individual, and social determinants of PPFP, programs should consider integrating norm-based and empowerment strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3177670365,"The urinary microbiota is the collection of microbes present in urine that may play a role in host health. Studies of urine microbiota have traditionally relied upon culturing methods aimed at identifying pathogens. However, recent culture-free sequencing studies of the urine microbiota have determined that a diverse array of microbes is present in health and disease. To study these microbes and their potential role in diseases like bladder cancer or interstitial cystitis, consistent extraction and detection of bacterial DNA from urine is critical. However, urine is a low biomass substrate, requiring sensitive methods to capture DNA and making the risk of contamination high. To address this challenge, we collected urine samples from ten healthy dogs and extracted DNA from each sample using five different commercially available extraction methods. Extraction methods were compared based on total and bacterial DNA concentrations and bacterial community composition and diversity assessed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Significant differences in the urinary microbiota were observed by dog and sex but not extraction method. The Bacteremia Kit yielded the highest total DNA concentrations (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.165, not significant) and the highest bacterial DNA concentrations (Kruskal-Wallis, p = 0.044). Bacteremia also extracted bacterial DNA from the greatest number of samples. Taken together, these results suggest that the Bacteremia kit is an effective option for studying the urine microbiota. This work lays the foundation to study the urine microbiome in a wide range of urogenital diseases in dogs and other species."
https://openalex.org/W3178585493,"Automated monitoring of websites that trade wildlife is increasingly necessary to inform conservation and biosecurity efforts. However, e-commerce and wildlife trading websites can contain a vast number of advertisements, an unknown proportion of which may be irrelevant to researchers and practitioners. Given that many wildlife-trade advertisements have an unstructured text format, automated identification of relevant listings has not traditionally been possible, nor attempted. Other scientific disciplines have solved similar problems using machine learning and natural language processing models, such as text classifiers. Here, we test the ability of a suite of text classifiers to extract relevant advertisements from wildlife trade occurring on the Internet. We collected data from an Australian classifieds website where people can post advertisements of their pet birds (n = 16.5k advertisements). We found that text classifiers can predict, with a high degree of accuracy, which listings are relevant (ROC AUC ≥ 0.98, F1 score ≥ 0.77). Furthermore, in an attempt to answer the question ‘how much data is required to have an adequately performing model?’, we conducted a sensitivity analysis by simulating decreases in sample sizes to measure the subsequent change in model performance. From our sensitivity analysis, we found that text classifiers required a minimum sample size of 33% (c. 5.5k listings) to accurately identify relevant listings (for our dataset), providing a reference point for future applications of this sort. Our results suggest that text classification is a viable tool that can be applied to the online trade of wildlife to reduce time dedicated to data cleaning. However, the success of text classifiers will vary depending on the advertisements and websites, and will therefore be context dependent. Further work to integrate other machine learning tools, such as image classification, may provide better predictive abilities in the context of streamlining data processing for wildlife trade related online data."
https://openalex.org/W3179426760,"The enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX) catalyzes the myo-inositol into glucuronic acid. In this study, 6 MIOX genes were identified from all of the three diploid cotton species ( Gossypium arboretum , Gossypium herbaceum and Gossypium raimondii ) and Gossypioides kirkii , 12 MIOX genes were identified from two domesticated tetraploid cottons Gossypium hirsutum , Gossypium barbadense , and 11 MIOX genes were identified from three wild tetraploid cottons Gossypium tomentosum , Gossypium mustelinum and Gossypium darwinii . The number of MIOX genes in tetraploid cotton genome is roughly twice that of diploid cotton genome. Members of MIOX family were classified into six groups based on the phylogenetic analysis. Integrated analysis of collinearity events and chromosome locations suggested that both whole genome duplication and segmental duplication events contributed to the expansion of MIOX genes during cotton evolution. The ratios of non-synonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitution rates revealed that purifying selection was the main force driving the evolution of MIOX genes. Numerous cis-acting elements related to light responsive element, defense and stress responsive element were identified in the promoter of the MIOX genes. Expression analyses of MIOX genes based on RNA-seq data and quantitative real time PCR showed that MIOX genes within the same group shared similar expression patterns with each other. All of these results provide the foundation for further study of the biological functions of MIOX genes in cotton environmental adaptability."
https://openalex.org/W3179477613,"The endothelial glycocalyx (EG) is essential for proper function of the endothelium and for vascular integrity, but its role in premature atherogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been studied yet. EG impairment can play a role in pathogenesis of vascular disease, and one of its characteristics is shedding of syndecan-1 from endothelial cells. Syndecan-1 shedding is mediated by matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) and counteracted by tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP)-1. Cardiovascular disease risk in RA is reversible by disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), but the exact modes of action are still unclear. Therefore, we examined effects of DMARDs on syndecan-1, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 in RA patients, and searched for associations between these parameters and inflammatory activity. From the observational PSARA study, we examined 39 patients starting with methotrexate (MTX) monotherapy (in MTX naïve patients, n = 19) or tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in combination with MTX (in MTX non-responders, n = 20) due to active RA. Serum syndecan-1, MMP-9 and TIMP-1 were measured at baseline and after six weeks of treatment. Serum syndecan-1 (p = 0.008) and TIMP-1 (p<0.001) levels decreased after six weeks of anti-rheumatic treatment. Levels of MMP-9 also decreased, but the difference was not statistically significant. The improvement in syndecan-1 levels were independent of changes in inflammatory activity. There was no significant difference in changes in syndecan-1 levels from baseline to 6 weeks between the MTX and TNFi groups, however the change was significant within the MTX group. Six weeks of antirheumatic treatment was associated with reduction in serum levels of syndecan-1, which might reflect reduced syndecan-1 shedding from EG. Thus, it is possible that EG-preserving properties of DMARDs might contribute to their cardioprotective effects. These effects may be at least partly independent of their anti-inflammatory actions. Our findings do not support the notion that syndecan-1 shedding in RA is mediated mainly by increased MMP-9 or decreased TIMP-9 serum concentration."
https://openalex.org/W3181162233,"Proteins make up a large percentage of the Brassica seed and are second only to the oil in economic importance with uses for both animal and human nutrition. The most abundant proteins reported in the seeds of Brassica are the seed storage proteins cruciferin and napin, belonging to the 12S globulin and 2S albumin families of proteins, respectively. To gain insight into the Brassica rapa seed proteome and to confirm the presence and relative quantity of proteins encoded by candidate seed storage genes in the mature seed, shotgun proteomics was carried out on protein extracts from seeds of B. rapa inbred line R-o-18. Following liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, a total of 34016 spectra were mapped to 323 proteins, where 233 proteins were identified in 3 out of 4 biological replicates by at least 2 unique peptides. 2S albumin like napin seed storage proteins (SSPs), 11/12S globulin like cruciferin SSPs and 7S globulin like vicilin SSPs were identified in the samples, along with other notable proteins including oil body proteins, namely ten oleosins and two oil body-associated proteins. The identification of vicilin like proteins in the mature B. rapa seed represents the first account of these proteins in the Brassicaceae and analysis indicates high conservation of sequence motifs to other 7S vicilin-like allergenic proteins as well as conservation of major allergenic epitopes in the proteins. This study enriches our existing knowledge on rapeseed seed proteins and provides a robust foundation and rational basis for plant bioengineering of seed storage proteins."
https://openalex.org/W3179876992,"The identification of a target-indication pair is regarded as the first step in a traditional drug discovery and development process. Significant investment and attrition occur during discovery and development before a molecule is shown to be safe and efficacious for the selected indication and becomes an approved drug. Many drug targets are functionally pleiotropic and might be good targets for multiple indications. Methodologies that leverage years of scientific contributions on drug targets to allow systematic evaluation of other indication opportunities are critical for both patients and drug discovery and development scientists.We introduced a network-based approach to systematically screen and prioritize disease indications for drug targets. The approach fundamentally integrates disease genomics data and protein interaction network. Further, the methodology allows for indication identification by leveraging state-of-art network algorithms to generate and compare the target and disease subnetworks.We first evaluated the performance of our method on recovering FDA approved indications for 15 randomly selected drug targets. The results showed superior performance when compared with other state-of-art approaches. Using this approach, we predicted novel indications supported by literature evidence for several highly pursued drug targets such as IL12/IL23 combination.Our results demonstrated a potential global approach for indication expansion strategies. The proposed methodology enables rapid and systematic evaluation of both individual and combined drug targets for novel indications. Additionally, this approach provides novel insights on expanding the role of genes and pathways for developing therapeutic intervention strategies."
https://openalex.org/W3180749230,"Background In Italy, in recent years, vaccination coverage for key immunizations as MMR has been declining to worryingly low levels, with large measles outbreaks. As a response in 2017, the Italian government expanded the number of mandatory immunizations introducing penalties to unvaccinated children’s families. During the 2018 general elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the government in-charge blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new government (formerly in the opposition) established in 2018 temporarily relaxed penalties and announced the introduction of forms of flexibility. Objectives and methods First, we supplied a definition of disorientation, as the “lack of well-established and resilient opinions among individuals, therefore causing them to change their positions as a consequence of sufficient external perturbations”. Second, procedures for testing for the presence of both short and longer-term collective disorientation in Twitter signals were proposed. Third, a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian during 2018 on immunization topics, and related polarity evaluations, were used to investigate whether the contrasting announcements at the highest political level might have originated disorientation amongst the Italian public. Results Vaccine-relevant tweeters’ interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of retained tweets, 70.0% resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.4% unfavourable, and 13.6% undecided, respectively. The smoothed time series of polarity proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable proportion, superimposed to a clear up-and-down trend synchronized with the switch between governments in Spring 2018, suggesting evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusions The reported evidence of disorientation for opinions expressed in online social media shows that critical health topics, such as vaccination, should never be used to achieve political consensus. This is worsened by the lack of a strong Italian institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts to contrast misinformation and the ensuing spread of hesitancy. It remains to be seen how this disorientation will impact future parents’ vaccination decisions."
https://openalex.org/W3181266684,"Prostate cancer is the most common male cancer in Morocco. Although sporadic forms account for a large proportion of patients, familial forms of prostate cancer are observed in 20% of cases and about 5% are due to hereditary transmission. Indeed, germline mutations in BRCA1 / 2 genes have been associated with prostate cancer risk. However, the spectrum of these mutations was not investigated in Moroccan Prostate cancer patients. Thereby, the aim of this study was to characterize and to estimate the prevalence of germline BRCA1 / 2 mutations and large rearrangements in Moroccan patients with familial prostate cancer. The entire coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes have been analyzed by next generation sequencing (NGS) in a total of 30 familial prostate cancer patients. Three pathogenic mutations were detected in four unrelated patients (13.3%). One BRCA1 mutation (c.1953_1956delGAAA) and two BRCA2 mutations (c.7234_7235insG and BRCA2ΔE12). In addition, sixty-three distinct polymorphisms and unclassified variants have been found. Early identification of germline BRCA1 / 2 mutations may be relevant for the management of Moroccan prostate cancer patients."
https://openalex.org/W3178952651,"The Barents Sea is a subarctic shelf sea which has experienced major changes during the past decades. From ecological time-series, three different food-web configurations, reflecting successive shifts of dominance of pelagic fish, demersal fish, and zooplankton, as well as varying trophic control have been identified in the last decades. This covers a relatively short time-period as available ecological time-series are often relatively short. As we lack information for prior time-periods, we use a chance and necessity model to investigate if there are other possible configurations of the Barents Sea food-web than those observed in the ecological time-series, and if this food-web is characterized by a persistent trophic control. We perform food-web simulations using the Non-Deterministic Network Dynamic model (NDND) for the Barents Sea, identify food-web configurations and compare those to historical reconstructions of food-web dynamics. Biomass configurations fall into four major types and three trophic pathways. Reconstructed data match one of the major biomass configurations but is characterized by a different trophic pathway than most of the simulated configurations. The simulated biomass displays fluctuations between bottom-up and top-down trophic control over time rather than persistent trophic control. Our results show that the configurations we have reconstructed are strongly overlapping with our simulated configurations, though they represent only a subset of the possible configurations of the Barents Sea food-web."
https://openalex.org/W3180849630,"Although regulatory improvements for air quality in the European Union have been made, air pollution is still a pressing problem and, its impact on health, both mortality and morbidity, is a topic of intense research nowadays. The main goal of this work is to assess the impact of the exposure to air pollutants on the number of daily hospital admissions due to respiratory causes in 58 spatial locations of Portugal mainland, during the period 2005-2017. To this end, INteger Generalised AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedastic (INGARCH)-based models are extensively used. This family of models has proven to be very useful in the analysis of serially dependent count data. Such models include information on the past history of the time series, as well as the effect of external covariates. In particular, daily hospitalisation counts, air quality and temperature data are endowed within INGARCH models of optimal orders, where the automatic inclusion of the most significant covariates is carried out through a new block-forward procedure. The INGARCH approach is adequate to model the outcome variable (respiratory hospital admissions) and the covariates, which advocates for the use of count time series approaches in this setting. Results show that the past history of the count process carries very relevant information and that temperature is the most determinant covariate, among the analysed, for daily hospital respiratory admissions. It is important to stress that, despite the small variability explained by air quality, all models include on average, approximately two air pollutants covariates besides temperature. Further analysis shows that the one-step-ahead forecasts distributions are well separated into two clusters: one cluster includes locations exclusively in the Lisbon area (exhibiting higher number of one-step-ahead hospital admissions forecasts), while the other contains the remaining locations. This results highlights that special attention must be given to air quality in Lisbon metropolitan area in order to decrease the number of hospital admissions."
https://openalex.org/W3181546289,"Dissolved organic matter (DOM) is a ubiquitous component of aquatic systems, impacting aquatic health and drinking water quality. These impacts depend on the mixture of organic molecules that comprise DOM. Changing climates are altering both the amount and character of DOM being transported from the terrestrial system into adjacent surface waters, yet DOM composition is not monitored as often as overall concentration. Many DOM characterization methods exist, confounding comparison of DOM composition across different studies. The objective of this research is to determine which parameters in a suite of relatively simple and common DOM characterization techniques explain the most variability in DOM composition from surface and groundwater sites. Further, we create a simple visualization tool to easily compare compositional differences in DOM. A large number of water samples (n = 250) was analyzed from six Canadian ecozones for DOM concentration, ultraviolet-visible light absorbance, molecular size, and elemental ratios. Principal component analyses was used to identify quasi-independent DOM compositional parameters that explained the highest variability in the dataset: spectral slope, specific-UV absorbance at 255nm, humic substances fraction, and dissolved organic carbon to dissolved organic nitrogen ratio. A ‘Composition Wheel’ was created by plotting these four parameters as a polygon. Our results find similarities in DOM composition irrespective of site differences in vegetation and climate. Further, two main end-member Composition Wheel shapes were revealed that correspond to DOM in organic-rich groundwaters and DOM influenced by photodegradation. The Composition Wheel approach uses easily visualized differences in polygon shape to quantify how DOM evolves by natural processes along the aquatic continuum and to track sources and degradation of DOM."
https://openalex.org/W3181787154,"Background Undernutrition is responsible for a significant proportion of maternal and child morbidity and mortality. Lactating women are nutritionally vulnerable groups because this period places a high nutritional demand on the mother and leads to nutritional stress. Poor nutrition during lactation has a significant negative consequence to mothers and children’s survival, growth, and development. Therefore this study aimed to assess the nutritional status of lactating mothers and associated factors in pastoral community, Afar region, Ethiopia. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted from January 5/2020 to February 10/2020, in the Abala district. The data were collected from a sample of 366 lactating mothers whose children aged less than 24 months. Data was collected through face-to-face interviews and anthropometric measurements. Study participants were recruited using a systematic sampling technique. Anthropometric measurements (both body mass index and mid-upper arm circumference) were taken from each mother using calibrated equipment and standardized techniques. Data were entered into Epi-data version 4.2 and exported to SPSS version 22 for analysis. Predictor variables with a P-value &lt; 0.25 at bivariable analysis were candidates for the final model. Statistical significance was declared at P-value of &lt; 0.05 in the multivariable logistic regression. Result This study showed that 120(32.8%) and 122(33.3%) surveyed mothers were undernourished using a cut-off body mass index &lt;18.5 kg/m 2 and mid-upper arm circumference &lt;23 Centimeter, respectively. Lactating mothers who didn’t meet the minimum dietary diversity score were more than five (Adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 5.103; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.128, 12.238) times more likely to be undernourished than those who met the minimum dietary diversity score. Mothers with short birth intervals were also more than four (AOR = 4.800; 95% CI: 2.408, 9.567) time more likely to be undernourished. Conclusion Nearly one-third of lactating mothers were undernourished. Undernutrition among lactating mothers was significantly associated with maternal dietary diversity score and birth interval. Health education on proper and adequate maternal dietary feeding practices, and proper family planning utilization during lactation should be emphasized."
https://openalex.org/W3182207667,"Access to essential medicines (EMs) is a basic human right. Non-availability and shortages of EMs are reported for Pakistan but there is insufficient data to define the nature and magnitude of this problem. The current study is designed to systematically analyze the medicines included in the National Essential Medicines List (NEML) for their availability through comprehensive document analysis.An expanded list of medicinal items was developed using the NEML of Pakistan (2018) to enlist individual medicines with their specifications. Registration status of the medicines was searched using three publicly accessible information sources; Pharmaguide 25th Edition, 2018-19, the on-line Drug Information System, and the Mobile Application Pharmapedia followed by a later 3-step validation of the data. The unregistered EMs were then further categorized into three subgroups in accordance with their possible remedial strategies.The 19 studied categories comprised 690 EMs and it was found that 179 (26%) of these EMs don not have a registration status. However, it was also identified that the availability of 47 (26.2%) out of 179 unregistered EMs can be enssured by strengthening compounding services, and prioritizing registration of age-appropriate formulations. Availability of another 39 (21.7%) such medicines can be ensured by revising the NEML or the product registrations for the slight differences in their different specifications. The categories showing high proportion of unregistered medicines included anti-Parkinson's medicines (100%), antidotes and other substances used in poisoning (60%), diuretics (47%), anticonvulsants/antiepileptics (42%), hormones and other endocrine medicines and contraceptives (38%), medicines for mental and behavioral disorders (30%), anti-infectives (27%), medicines for pain and palliative care (26%), medicines for neonatal care (25%), medicines for diseases of joint (25%), gastrointestinal medicines (24%) and cardiovascular medicines (15%).The study shows the absence of registration status of a significant number of EMs in Pakistan. This could be major barrier in their access. Strategies are needed to strengthen the processes of their registration on priority basis."
https://openalex.org/W3183071681,"Objective The association of body mass index (BMI) and all-cause mortality is controversial, frequently referred to as a paradox. Whether the cause is metabolic factors or statistical biases is still controversial. We assessed the association of BMI and all-cause mortality considering a wide range of comorbidities and baseline mortality risk. Methods Retrospective cohort study of Olmsted County residents with at least one BMI measurement between 2000–2005, clinical data in the electronic health record and minimum 8 year follow-up or death within this time. The cohort was categorized based on baseline mortality risk: Low, Medium, Medium-high, High and Very-high. All-cause mortality was assessed for BMI intervals of 5 and 0.5 Kg/m 2 . Results Of 39,739 subjects (average age 52.6, range 18–89; 38.1% male) 11.86% died during 8-year follow-up. The 8-year all-cause mortality risk had a “U” shape with a flat nadir in all the risk groups. Extreme BMI showed higher risk (BMI &lt;15 = 36.4%, 15 to &lt;20 = 15.4% and ≥45 = 13.7%), while intermediate BMI categories showed a plateau between 10.6 and 12.5%. The increased risk attributed to baseline risk and comorbidities was more obvious than the risk based on BMI increase within the same risk groups. Conclusions There is a complex association between BMI and all-cause mortality when evaluated including comorbidities and baseline mortality risk. In general, comorbidities are better predictors of mortality risk except at extreme BMIs. In patients with no or few comorbidities, BMI seems to better define mortality risk. Aggressive management of comorbidities may provide better survival outcome for patients with body mass between normal and moderate obesity."
https://openalex.org/W3182840620,"Sarcomas are rare, difficult to treat, mesenchymal lineage tumours that affect children and adults. Immunologically-based therapies have improved outcomes for numerous adult cancers, however, these therapeutic strategies have been minimally effective in sarcoma so far. Clinically relevant, immunologically-competent, and transplantable pre-clinical sarcoma models are essential to advance sarcoma immunology research. Herein we show that Cre-mediated activation of KrasG12D, and deletion of Trp53, in the hindlimb muscles of C57Bl/6 mice results in the highly penetrant, rapid onset undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (UPS), one of the most common human sarcoma subtypes. Cell lines derived from spontaneous UPS tumours can be reproducibly transplanted into the hindlimbs or lungs of naïve, immune competent syngeneic mice. Immunological characterization of both spontaneous and transplanted UPS tumours demonstrates an immunologically-'quiescent' microenvironment, characterized by a paucity of lymphocytes, limited spontaneous adaptive immune pathways, and dense macrophage infiltrates. Macrophages are the dominant immune population in both spontaneous and transplanted UPS tumours, although compared to spontaneous tumours, transplanted tumours demonstrate increased spontaneous lymphocytic infiltrates. The growth of transplanted UPS tumours is unaffected by host lymphocyte deficiency, and despite strong expression of PD-1 on tumour infiltrating lymphocytes, tumours are resistant to immunological checkpoint blockade. This spontaneous and transplantable immune competent UPS model will be an important experimental tool in the pre-clinical development and evaluation of novel immunotherapeutic approaches for immunologically cold soft tissue sarcomas."

The aim of the present paper is to report the results of performing one additional injection at the root of the edematous limb[s] to force the visualization of the LNs and/or to demonstrate the collateral lymphatic pathways in such patients.We retrospectively reviewed our database and found 99 patients [44 primary LLLE with 47 limbs injected and 55 with LLLE secondary to treatments for cancer with 64 limbs injected] where such an additional injection had been performed. In the 43 LLLE patients where no LNs were seen at the end of the classical exam [15 primary LLLE and 28 secondary LLLE], the extra injection showed lymphatic drainage toward LN[s] in all except 3 and when at least one LN was seen, the injection showed lymphatic drainage in every case toward the same ipsilateral [inguinal and/or iliac] LNs [as shown by the classical injection] and/or toward additional LNs. In 40.7% of patients, we observed one or more additional lymphatic pathways: prepubic superficial lymphatic vessels [LV] crossing the midline anteriorly toward contralateral inguinal LNs in 21 [18.9%], ""posterior"" LV [toward contralateral inguinal LNs and/or ipsi- or contralateral lumbo-aortic and/or para-renal LNs] in 14 [12.6%], but deep LV toward the ipsilateral common iliac LNs passing between the gluteal muscles in 32 [28.8%].Our work pinpoints one limitation of classical bipedal radionuclide lymphangiography. In patients with primary and secondary LLLE where inguinal and/or iliac LNs cannot be seen on bipedal radionuclide lymphangiography, this additional injection reveals the true lympho-nodal status and shows unexpected collateral lymphatic pathways in 40% of cases. Such information is of the utmost importance in LLLE management and its acquisition is consequently recommended in these patients."
https://openalex.org/W3177794039,"Bullying is an understudied global social problem. While school-level factors are a recognized influence on bullying victimization, the elements of a 'girl-friendly' school that may reduce the risk of bullying victimization among girls and prevent dropout is understudied in lower- and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study used baseline data from the evaluation of the Room-to-Read (RtR) Girls' Education Program (GEP) in Nepal to assess the relationship of a conceptually grounded gender-equitable school (GES) index with girls' risk of direct and relational bullying victimization, adjusted for potential confounders at the individual and school levels.The school sample included all 24 RtR GEP schools and 25 community schools attended by girls in a comparison cohort, representing 729 grade six girls with complete outcome data. We employed multilevel negative binomial regression to assess the relationship between the GES score (higher scores indicate greater support for girls), and girls' risk of peer victimization, controlling for individual- and school-level covariates.On average, girls reported 2.84 direct victimizations and 0.27 relational victimizations in the prior week. The first component of the GES index, a generalized measure of school-level support for girls, showed a significant negative relationship with weekly relational bullying victimization in models with all school- and individual-level covariates. In the full model, a one-point higher score on the generalized GES component accounted for a 26% lower risk of relational bullying victimization in the prior week.School-level policies, practices, and pedagogy designed to support girls may reduce their exposure to relational aggression, a form of bullying that girls most often perpetrate. In LMICs, the school may be an ideal place to raise awareness about the types and effects of peer bullying and to promote prosocial bystander behavior. Further research is needed to identify factors related to other forms of bullying."
https://openalex.org/W3179840933,"Avian brood parasitism is costly for the host, in many cases leading to the evolution of defenses like discrimination of parasitic eggs. The parasite, in turn, may evolve mimetic eggs as a counter-adaptation to host egg rejection. Some generalist parasites have evolved host-specific races (gentes) that may mimic the eggs of their main hosts, while others have evolved ‘jack-of-all-trades’ egg phenotypes that mimic key features of the eggs of several different host species. The Asian koel ( Eudynamys scolopaceus ) is a widely distributed generalist brood parasite that exploits a wide range of host species. Based on human vision, previous studies have described Asian koel eggs as resembling those of its main host, the house crow ( Corvus splendens ). Using measurements of egg length and breadth, digital image analysis, reflectance spectrophotometry and avian visual modelling, we examined Asian koel egg variation and potential mimicry in egg size and shape, and eggshell pattern and color in three sympatrically occurring host species in Bangladesh: the common myna ( Acridotheres tristis ), house crow, and long-tailed shrike ( Lanius schach ). We found some differences among Asian koel eggs laid in different host nests: a) Asian koel eggs in long-tailed shrike nests were larger than those laid in common myna and house crow nests, and b) Asian koel eggs in house crow nests were less elongated than those in common myna nests. However, these changes in Asian koel egg volume and shape were in the opposite direction with respect to their corresponding host egg characteristics. Thus, our study found no evidence for Asian koel host-specific egg mimicry in three sympatrically occurring host species."

Here we examine SARS-CoV-2 molecular-based test performance characteristics and summarize case-level data related to COVID-19 diagnosis. From January 11 through April 22, 2020, Public Health Ontario conducted SARS-CoV-2 testing of 86,942 specimens collected from 80,354 individuals, primarily using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) methods. We analyzed test results across specimen types and for individuals with multiple same-day and multi-day collected specimens. Nasopharyngeal compared to throat swabs had a higher positivity (8.8% vs. 4.8%) and an adjusted estimate 2.9 C t lower (SE = 0.5, p &lt;0.001). Same-day specimens showed high concordance (98.8%), and the median C t of multi-day specimens increased over time. Symptomatic cases had rRT-PCR results with an adjusted estimate 3.0 C t (SE = 0.5, p &lt;0.001) lower than asymptomatic/pre-symptomatic cases. Overall test sensitivity was 84.6%, with a negative predictive value of 95.5%.

https://openalex.org/W3179968472,"The untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs are involved in many posttranscriptional regulatory pathways. The rice OsMac1 mRNA has three splicing variants of the 5' UTR (UTRa, UTRb, and UTRc), which include a CU-rich region and three upstream open reading frames (uORFs). UTRc contains an additional 38-nt sequence, termed sp38, which acts as a strong translational enhancer of the downstream ORF; reporter analysis revealed translational efficiencies >15-fold higher with UTRc than with the other splice variants. Mutation analysis of UTRc demonstrated that an optimal sequence length of sp38, rather than its nucleotide sequence is essential for UTRc to promote efficient translation. In addition, the 5' 100 nucleotides of CU-rich region contribute to UTRc translational enhancement. Strikingly, three uORFs did not reveal their inhibitory potential within the full-length leader, whereas deletion of the 5' leader fragment preceding the leader region with uORFs nearly abolished translation. Computational prediction of UTRc structural motifs revealed stem-loop structures, termed SL1-SL4, and two regions, A and B, involved in putative intramolecular interactions. Our data suggest that SL4 binding to Region-A and base pairing between Region-B and the UTRc 3'end are critically required for translational enhancement. Since UTRc is not capable of internal initiation, we presume that the three-dimensional leader structures can allow translation of the leader downstream ORF, likely allowing the bypass of uORFs."
https://openalex.org/W3180504742,"Systemic inflammation may increase risk for prostate cancer progression, but the role it plays in prostate cancer susceptibility is unknown. From a cohort of over 10,000 men who had either a prostate biopsy or transurethral resection that yielded a benign finding, we analyzed 517 incident prostate cancer cases identified during follow-up and 373 controls with one or more white blood cell tests during a follow-up period between one and 18 years. Multilevel, multivariable longitudinal models were fit to two measures of systemic inflammation, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), to determine NLR and MLR trajectories associated with increased risk for prostate cancer. For both measures, we found no significant differences in the trajectories by case/control status, however in modeling NLR trajectories there was a significant interaction between race (white or Black and case-control status. In race specific models, NLR and MLR values were consistently higher over time among white controls than white cases while case-control differences in NLR and MLR trajectories were not apparent among Black men. When cases were classified as aggressive as compared to non-aggressive, the case-control differences in NLR and MLR values over time among white men were most apparent for non-aggressive cases. For NLR among white men, significant case-control differences were observed for the entire duration of observation for men who had inflammation in their initial prostate specimen. It is possible that, among white men, monitoring of NLR and MLR trajectories after an initial negative biopsy may be useful in monitoring prostate cancer risk."
https://openalex.org/W3180904881,"A major obstacle for tissue engineering ear-shaped cartilage is poorly developed tissue comprising cell-scaffold constructs. To address this issue, bioresorbable scaffolds of poly-ε-caprolactone (PCL) and polyglycolic acid nanofibers (nanoPGA) were evaluated using an ethanol treatment step before auricular chondrocyte scaffold seeding, an approach considered to enhance scaffold hydrophilicity and cartilage regeneration. Auricular chondrocytes were isolated from canine ears and human surgical samples discarded during otoplasty, including microtia reconstruction. Canine chondrocytes were seeded onto PCL and nanoPGA sheets either with or without ethanol treatment to examine cellular adhesion in vitro. Human chondrocytes were seeded onto three-dimensional bioresorbable composite scaffolds (PCL with surface coverage of nanoPGA) either with or without ethanol treatment and then implanted into athymic mice for 10 and 20 weeks. On construct retrieval, scanning electron microscopy showed canine auricular chondrocytes seeded onto ethanol-treated scaffolds in vitro developed extended cell processes contacting scaffold surfaces, a result suggesting cell-scaffold adhesion and a favorable microenvironment compared to the same cells with limited processes over untreated scaffolds. Adhesion of canine chondrocytes was statistically significantly greater (p ≤ 0.05) for ethanol-treated compared to untreated scaffold sheets. After implantation for 10 weeks, constructs of human auricular chondrocytes seeded onto ethanol-treated scaffolds were covered with glossy cartilage while constructs consisting of the same cells seeded onto untreated scaffolds revealed sparse connective tissue and cartilage regeneration. Following 10 weeks of implantation, RT-qPCR analyses of chondrocytes grown on ethanol-treated scaffolds showed greater expression levels for several cartilage-related genes compared to cells developed on untreated scaffolds with statistically significantly increased SRY-box transcription factor 5 (SOX5) and decreased interleukin-1α (inflammation-related) expression levels (p ≤ 0.05). Ethanol treatment of scaffolds led to increased cartilage production for 20- compared to 10-week constructs. While hydrophilicity of scaffolds was not assessed directly in the present findings, a possible factor supporting the summary data is that hydrophilicity may be enhanced for ethanol-treated nanoPGA/PCL scaffolds, an effect leading to improvement of chondrocyte adhesion, the cellular microenvironment and cartilage regeneration in tissue-engineered auricle constructs."
https://openalex.org/W3181949445,"Background Severe acute post-cesarean delivery (CD) pain has been associated with an increased risk for persistent pain and postpartum depression. Identification of women at increased risk for pain can be used to optimize post-cesarean analgesia. The impact of labor prior to CD (intrapartum CD) on acute post-operative pain and opioid use is unclear. We hypothesized that intrapartum CD, which has been associated with both increased inflammation and affective distress related to an unexpected surgical procedure, would result in higher postoperative pain scores and increased opioid intake. Methods This is a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study examining opioid use up to 2 weeks following CD. Women undergoing CD at six academic medical centers in the United States 9/2014-3/2016 were contacted by phone two weeks following discharge. Participants completed a structured interview that included questions about postoperative pain scores and opioid utilization. They were asked to retrospectively estimate their maximal pain score on an 11-point numeric rating scale at multiple time points, including day of surgery, during hospitalization, immediately after discharge, 1 st week, and 2 nd week following discharge. Pain scores over time were assessed utilizing a generalized linear mixed-effects model with the patient identifier being a random effect, adjusting for an a priori defined set of confounders. A multivariate negative binomial model was utilized to assess the association between intrapartum CD and opioid utilization after discharge, also adjusting for the same confounders. In the context of non-random prescription distribution, this model was constructed with an offset for the number of tablets dispensed. Results A total of 720 women were enrolled, 392 with and 328 without labor prior to CD. Patients with intrapartum CD were younger, less likely to undergo repeat CD or additional surgical procedures, and more likely to experience a complication of CD. Women with intrapartum CD consumed more opioid tablets following discharge than women without labor (median 20, IQR 10–30 versus 17, IQR 6–30; p = 0.005). This association persisted after adjustment for confounders (incidence rate ratio 1.16, 95% CI 1.05–1.29; p = 0.004). Pain scores on the day of surgery were higher in women with intrapartum CD (difference 0.91, 95% CI 0.52–1.30; adj. p = &lt;0.001) even after adjustment for confounders. Pain scores at other time points were not meaningfully different between the two groups. Conclusion Intrapartum CD is associated with worse pain on the day of surgery but not other time points. Opioid requirements following discharge were modestly increased following intrapartum CD."
https://openalex.org/W3152017590,"We investigated the spatial disparities and factors associated with gastric cancer (GC) Incidence in Manitoba.We combined information from Manitoba Cancer registry and Census data to obtain an age-sex adjusted relative risk (IRR) of GC incidence. We geocoded the IRR to the 96 regional health authority districts (RHADs) using the postal code conversion file (PCCF). Bayesian spatial and spatio-temporal Poisson regression models were used for the analysis.Adjusting for the effect of socio-economic score index (SESI), Indigenous, and immigrant population, 25 districts with high overall GC risk were identified. One unit increase in SESI was associated with reduced risk of cardia GC (CGC) by 14% (IRR = 0.859; 95% CI: 0.780-0.947) and the risk of non-cardia GC (NCGC) by approximately 10% (IRR = 0.898; 95% CI: 0.812-0.995); 1% increase in regional Indigenous population proportion reduced the risk of CGC by 1.4% (IRR = 0.986; 95% CI: 0.978-0.994). In the analysis stratified by sex, one unit increase in SESI reduced the risk of CGC among women by 26.2% (IRR = 0.738; 95% CI: 0.618-0.879), and a 1% increase in Indigenous population proportion reduced the risk of CGC among women by 1.9% (IRR = 0.981; 95% CI: 0.966-0.996).Our results support a significant association between SESI and NCGC. We report regional variation of GC IRR and a varying temporal pattern across the RHADs. These results could be used to prioritize interventions for regions with high and progressive risk of GC."
https://openalex.org/W3179092702,"During clinical reasoning case conferences, a learner-centered approach using teleconferencing can create a psychologically safe environment and help learners speak up. This study aims to measure the psychological safety of students who are supposed to self-explain their clinical reasoning to conference participants. This crossover study compared the effects of two clinical reasoning case conference methods on medical students' psychological safety. The study population comprised 4th-5th year medical students participating in a two-week general medicine clinical clerkship rotation, from September 2019 to February 2020. They participated in both a learner-centered approach teleconference and a traditional, live-style conference. Teleconferences were conducted in a separate room, with only a group of students and one facilitator. Participants in group 1 received a learner-centered teleconference in the first week and a traditional, live-style conference in the second week. Participants assigned to group 2 received a traditional, live-style conference in the first week and a learner-centered approach teleconference in the second week. After each conference, Edmondson's Psychological Safety Scale was used to assess the students' psychological safety. We also counted the number of students who self-explained their clinical reasoning processes during each conference. Of the 38 students, 34 completed the study. Six out of the seven psychological safety items were significantly higher in the learner-centered approach teleconferences (p<0.01). Twenty-nine (85.3%) students performed self-explanation in the teleconference compared to ten (29.4%) in the live conference (p<0.01). A learner-centered approach teleconference could improve psychological safety in novice learners and increase the frequency of their self-explanation, helping educators better assess their understanding. Based on these results, a learner-centered teleconference approach has the potential to be a method for teaching clinical reasoning to medical students."
https://openalex.org/W3179183026,"Cognitive performances on neuropsychological paper-and-pencil tests are generally evaluated quantitatively by examining a final score (e.g., total duration). Digital tests allow for a quantitative evaluation of ""how"" a patient attained a final score, which opens the possibility to assess more subtle cognitive impairment even when final scores are evaluated as normal. We assessed performance stability (i.e., the number of fluctuations in test performance) to investigate (1) differences in performance stability between patients with acquired brain injury (ABI) and healthy controls; (2) the added value of performance stability measures in patients with ABI; and (3) the relation between performance stability and cognitive complaints in daily life in patients with ABI.We administered three digital neuropsychological tests (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Trail Making Test, Stroop Colour and Word Test) and the Cognitive Complaints-Participation (CoCo-P) inventory in patients with ABI (n = 161) and healthy controls (n = 91).Patients with ABI fluctuated more in their performance on all tests, when compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, 4-15% of patients who performed inside normal range on the conventional final scores were outside normal range on the performance stability measures. The performance stability measures, nor the conventional final scores, were associated with cognitive complaints in daily life.Stability in test performance of patients was clearly dissociable from healthy controls, and may assess additional cognitive weaknesses which might not be observed or objectified with paper-and-pencil tests. More research is needed for developing measures better associated with cognitive complaints."
https://openalex.org/W3180284092,"The endangered Black-faced Spoonbill (Platalea minor) strictly breeds in marine environments and is threatened by the rapid loss of coastal wetlands within its breeding range. Adults with chicks are thought to gradually switch feeding sites from freshwater wetlands to coastal mudflats as the chicks' osmoregulatory system develops. We investigated age-dependent shifts in the diet of Black-faced Spoonbill chicks at four breeding colonies with varying freshwater habitat availability by examining stable isotopes (δ13C, δ15N) between the tip (grown at the age of 10 days) and middle (grown at the age of 22 days) portions of their primary feathers. The δ13C value of the middle portions was significantly higher than that of the tips, which suggested that the ratio of marine resources increased with the growth and development of chicks. A Bayesian isotope mixing model revealed that the diet proportion of marine prey in the early-chick rearing season was slightly higher than in the late-chick rearing season at three colonies in inshore areas, although this proportion was approximately 60% even in the early chick-rearing period. In contrast, isotopic values and reconstructed diet composition suggested that chicks in an offshore colony with limited freshwater wetlands relied more heavily on freshwater diets for both chick-rearing periods (>80%). Our results suggest that the shifts in feeding sites seen in previous studies might be related to the age-dependent dietary shift of chicks, highlighting the importance of freshwater wetlands for spoonbills on offshore islands without an inflow of freshwater in nearby intertidal mudflats. These findings emphasize the importance of freshwater prey and wetlands even for the endangered marine-breeding spoonbills, even though the negative impact of salt stress remains inconclusive."
https://openalex.org/W3180799436,"There are challenges related to collaboration among health professionals in resource-limited settings. Continuing Interprofessional Education initiatives grounded on workplace dynamics, structure and the prevailing attitudes and biases of targeted health professionals may be a vehicle to develop collaboration among health professionals. Workplace dynamics are revealed as health professionals interact. We argue that insights into the interaction patterns of health professionals in the workplace could provide guidance for improving the design and value of CIPE initiative. The study was conducted through rapid ethnography and data were collected from non-participant observations. The data were transcribed and analysed through an inductive iterative process. Appropriate ethical principles were applied throughout the study. Three themes emerged namely ""Formed professional identities influencing interprofessional interaction"", ""Diversity in communication networks and approaches"" and ""Professional practice and care in resource limited contexts"". This study revealed poor interaction patterns among health professionals within the workplace. These poor interaction patterns were catalyzed by the pervasive professional hierarchy, the protracted health professional shortages, limited understanding of professional roles and the lack of a common language of communication among the health professionals. Several recommendations were made regarding the design and development of Continuing Interprofessional Education initiatives for resource-limited settings."
https://openalex.org/W3181129857,"Given trained models from multiple source domains, how can we predict the labels of unlabeled data in a target domain? Unsupervised multi-source domain adaptation (UMDA) aims for predicting the labels of unlabeled target data by transferring the knowledge of multiple source domains. UMDA is a crucial problem in many real-world scenarios where no labeled target data are available. Previous approaches in UMDA assume that data are observable over all domains. However, source data are not easily accessible due to privacy or confidentiality issues in a lot of practical scenarios, although classifiers learned in source domains are readily available. In this work, we target data-free UMDA where source data are not observable at all, a novel problem that has not been studied before despite being very realistic and crucial. To solve data-free UMDA, we propose DEMS (Data-free Exploitation of Multiple Sources), a novel architecture that adapts target data to source domains without exploiting any source data, and estimates the target labels by exploiting pre-trained source classifiers. Extensive experiments for data-free UMDA on real-world datasets show that DEMS provides the state-of-the-art accuracy which is up to 27.5% point higher than that of the best baseline."

https://openalex.org/W3178997943,"Increasing attention is being paid to the operation of biomedical data repositories in light of efforts to improve how scientific data is handled and made available for the long term. Multiple groups have produced recommendations for functions that biomedical repositories should support, with many using requirements of the FAIR data principles as guidelines. However, FAIR is but one set of principles that has arisen out of the open science community. They are joined by principles governing open science, data citation and trustworthiness, all of which are important aspects for biomedical data repositories to support. Together, these define a framework for data repositories that we call OFCT: Open, FAIR, Citable and Trustworthy. Here we developed an instrument using the open source PolicyModels toolkit that attempts to operationalize key aspects of OFCT principles and piloted the instrument by evaluating eight biomedical community repositories listed by the NIDDK Information Network (dkNET.org). Repositories included both specialist repositories that focused on a particular data type or domain, in this case diabetes and metabolomics, and generalist repositories that accept all data types and domains. The goal of this work was both to obtain a sense of how much the design of current biomedical data repositories align with these principles and to augment the dkNET listing with additional information that may be important to investigators trying to choose a repository, e.g., does the repository fully support data citation? The evaluation was performed from March to November 2020 through inspection of documentation and interaction with the sites by the authors. Overall, although there was little explicit acknowledgement of any of the OFCT principles in our sample, the majority of repositories provided at least some support for their tenets."
https://openalex.org/W3181042083,"Maternal tobacco use is a global public health problem. In the literature, the focus was mainly on cigarette smoking, minimally on waterpipe use, and totally ignored dual use among pregnant women. We estimated the prevalence of current maternal tobacco use by tobacco product (cigarette, waterpipe, and dual use) over a period of ten years (2007 to 2017), and examined the socio-demographic patterning of maternal tobacco use.A secondary analysis of Jordan DHS four data waves was conducted for women who reported to be pregnant at the time of the survey. Current cigarette and waterpipe tobacco use were investigated. Prevalence estimates for cigarette-only, waterpipe-only, and dual use, as well as for cigarette, regardless of waterpipe, and waterpipe, regardless of cigarette, were reported. The effect of independent variables on cigarette smoking, waterpipe use, and dual use was assessed. Logistic regression models assessed the adjusted effects of socio-demographic variables on cigarette smoking, waterpipe use, and on dual use. For each outcome variable, a time-adjusted and a time-unadjusted logistic models were conducted.Over the last decade, the prevalence estimates of current cigarette-only smoking slightly decreased. The prevalence estimates of current waterpipe-only use exceeded those for cigarette-only after 2007 and showed a steady overall increase. Current dual use showed a continuous rise especially after 2009. Gradual increase in cigarette smoking (4.1%, in 2007, and 5.7% in 2017) and in waterpipe use (2.5% to 6.4%) were detected. Education showed an inverse relationship with cigarette and waterpipe smoking. Household wealth demonstrated a positive association with cigarette and waterpipe smoking.Tobacco use epidemic is expanding its roots among pregnant women in Jordan through not only waterpipe use but also dual cigarette-waterpipe smoking. Maternal and child services should consider tobacco counseling and cessation."
https://openalex.org/W3182346772,"Analysis using human body models has been performed to reduce the impact of accidents; however, no analysis has shown a relationship between lumbar and pelvic/spine angle and seat belts in reducing human damage from accidents. Lumbar and pelvic/spine angles were measured in 75 individuals and the measurements were used to create three different angles for the Total Human Model for Safety model. In the present study, we focused on lumber lordosis (LL) and pelvic angle (PA). A normal distribution and histogram were used for analysis of PA (01, 10, and 50). The Total Human Model for Safety, including LL and PA, was corrected using finite element software. Simulations were conducted under the conditions of the Japan New Car Assessment Programme (JNCAP) 56 kph full lap frontal impact. Using the results of the FEM, the amount of lap-belt cranial sliding-up, anterior movement of the pelvis, posterior tilt of the pelvis, head injury criterion (HIC), second cervical vertebrae (C2) compressive load, C2 moment, chest deflectiou (upper, middle, and lower), left and right femur load, and shoulder belt force were measured. The lap-belt cranial sliding-up was 1.91 and 2.37 for PA10 and PA01, respectively, compared to PA50; the anterior movement of the pelvis was 1.08 and 1.12 for PA10 and PA01, respectively; and the posterior tilt of the pelvis was 1.1 and 1.18 for PA10 and PA01, respectively. HIC was 1.13 for PA10 and 1.58 for PA01; there was no difference in C2 compressive load by PA, but C2 moment increased to 1.59 for PA10 and 2.72 for PA01. It was found that as LL increases and the PA decreases, the seat belt becomes likely to catch the iliac bone, making it harder to cause injury. This study could help to reconsider the safe seat and seatbelt position in the future."
