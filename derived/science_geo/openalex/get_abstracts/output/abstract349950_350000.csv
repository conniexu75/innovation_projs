Magnets tend to come with inseparable north and south poles, and there are no known magnetic monopoles despite concerted efforts to find them. But an intriguing theoretical study now proposes that magnetic monopoles may exist, not as elementary particles, but as emergent particles in exotic condensed matter magnetic systems such as 'spin ice'. The theory, based on an analogy to fractional electric charges seen, for example, in quantum Hall systems in two dimensions, can explain a mysterious phase transition that has been observed experimentally in spin ice. The cover, by Alessandro Canossa, depicts a magnetic monopole (red sphere) emerging from break-up of the dipole moment (arrows) of the underlying electronic degrees of freedom in spin ice. A theoretical study proposes that magnetic monopoles may appear not as elementary but as emergent particles in complex, strongly-correlated magnetic systems such as spin ice, in analogy to fractional electric charges in quantum Hall systems. This theory explains a mysterious phase transition in spin ice that has been observed experimentally. Electrically charged particles, such as the electron, are ubiquitous. In contrast, no elementary particles with a net magnetic charge have ever been observed, despite intensive and prolonged searches (see ref. 1 for example). We pursue an alternative strategy, namely that of realizing them not as elementary but rather as emergent particles—that is, as manifestations of the correlations present in a strongly interacting many-body system. The most prominent examples of emergent quasiparticles are the ones with fractional electric charge e/3 in quantum Hall physics2. Here we propose that magnetic monopoles emerge in a class of exotic magnets known collectively as spin ice3,4,5: the dipole moment of the underlying electronic degrees of freedom fractionalises into monopoles. This would account for a mysterious phase transition observed experimentally in spin ice in a magnetic field6,7, which is a liquid–gas transition of the magnetic monopoles. These monopoles can also be detected by other means, for example, in an experiment modelled after the Stanford magnetic monopole search8."

Here we describe that BRCA1 forms a complex with CtIP and MRN (Mre11/Rad50/Nbs1) in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Significantly, the complex formation, especially the ionizing radiation-enhanced association of BRCA1 with MRN, requires cyclin-dependent kinase activity. CtIP directly interacts with Nbs1. The in vivo association of BRCA1 with MRN is largely dependent on the association of CtIP with the BRCT domains at the C terminus of BRCA1, whereas the N terminus of BRCA1 also contributes to its association with MRN. CtIP, as well as the interaction of BRCA1 with CtIP and MRN, is critical for IR-induced single-stranded DNA formation and cellular resistance to radiation. Consistently, CtIP itself is required for efficient HR-mediated DSB repair, like BRCA1 and MRN. These studies suggest that the complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN is important for facilitating DSB resection to generate single-stranded DNA that is needed for HR-mediated DSB repair. Because cyclin-dependent kinase is important for establishing IR-enhanced interaction of MRN with BRCA1, we propose that the cell cycle-dependent complex formation of BRCA1, CtIP, and MRN contributes to the activation of HR-mediated DSB repair in the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle.

Individuals carrying germ line mutations in BRCA1 have an extremely high risk of developing breast or ovarian cancer (1Nathanson K.L. Wooster R. Weber B.L. Nat. Med. 2001; 7: 552-556Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). Compelling evidence suggests that BRCA1 plays important roles in the maintenance of genome stability (2Scully R. Livingston D.M.

Although BRCA1 possesses multiple cellular functions including checkpoint control, transcription regulation, ubiquitination, apoptosis, and DNA repair (3Venkitaraman A.R.

Two distinct BRCA1 super complexes have been identified, and one of them contains BRCA1, MRN, and the BRCA1 association protein CtIP (19Greenberg R.A. Sobhian B. Pathania S. Cantor S.B. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). CtIP was originally discovered as an interacting protein of CtBP (20Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) and was also found to be associated with Rb family members (21Fusco C.

CtIP interacts with BRCA1 through the BRCT domains of BRCA1, and clinically relevant mutations within the BRCT domains of BRCA1 abolish their interaction (23Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A.

Interestingly, the interaction of BRCA1 with CtIP requires phosphorylation of CtIP at Ser327 by CDK, which occurs in the late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (26Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). DSBs can be repaired by both homologous recombination (HR) 3The abbreviations used are: HRhomologous recombinationDSBdoublestrand breakIRionizing radiationCDKcyclin-dependent kinasessDNAsingle-stranded DNAshRNAsmall hairpin RNARNAiRNA interferenceGSTglutathione S-transferaseGFPgreen fluorescent proteinHAhemagglutininGygray(s). and nonhomologous end joining (27Pierce A.J. Stark J.M. Araujo F.D. Moynahan M.E. Berwick M. Jasin M. Trends Cell Biol. 2001; 11: S52-S59Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). The cell cycle stage is a major factor to determine which repair pathways are used (28Sonoda E. Hochegger H. Saberi A. Taniguchi Y. Takeda S. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). Nonhomologous end joining is primarily used in G1, whereas HR becomes a choice for DSB repair in S and G2 when sister chromatids are present (29Takata M. Sasaki M.S. Sonoda E. Morrison C.

Because homologous chromosomes are the only available homologous templates in G1, use of HR at this cell cycle stage would lead to a loss of heterozygosity.

Given the importance of cell cycle-regulated selection of repair pathways, it is tempting to understand how HR is activated as the cell cycle proceeds. It has been shown in yeast that CDKs are directly involved in the selection of HR to repair DSBs in S/G2 (32Ira G. Pellicioli A. Balijja A. Wang X. Fiorani S. Carotenuto W. Liberi G. Bressan D.

In mammalian cells, damage-induced Rad51 foci formation occurs predominantly in S/G2 (35Bishop D.K. Ear U. Bhattacharyya A. Calderone C. Beckett M. Weichselbaum R.R. Shinohara A. J. Biol.

Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). However, the detailed mechanisms by which CDKs regulate HR are still unknown. Recent studies identified homology of CtIP with the yeast proteins Sae2 and Ctp1 (37Limbo O. Chahwan C. Yamada Y. de Bruin R.A. Wittenberg C. Russell P. Mol.

Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), suggesting that CtIP is likely a functional counterpart of Sae2 and CtP1. Both Sae2 and Ctp1 function with the Mre11 complex to process DSB ends to generate ssDNA (37Limbo O. Chahwan C. Yamada Y. de Bruin R.A. Wittenberg C. Russell P. Mol.

In this report, we demonstrate that human CtIP is important for BRCA1 to interact with MRN. The complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN is cell cycle-dependent and requires CDK activity. We also show that CtIP, as well as the formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN complex, is needed for end resection activities at DSBs, thereby contributing to HR-mediated DSB repair. These findings suggest one important mechanism by which BRCA1 regulates DSB repair and also have significant implications for the cell cycle-dependent control of HR-mediated DSB repair. Cell Culture and Cell Synchronization—U2OS, T98G, BJ, and 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HBL100 and HCC1937 cells were cultured in RPMI with 10% fetal bovine serum. Primary fibroblast cell line GM07166 (Nbs1-deficient) was immortalized by hTERT (44Meyerson M. Counter C.M. Eaton E.N.

Insect cell line Sf21 was cultured in Grace's insect medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. For cell cycle synchronization, T98G cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.1% fetal bovine serum for 48 h and then released by adding 10% fetal bovine serum. Plasmids, Mutagenesis, and shRNA/RNAi—Recombinant baculoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged Nbs1 and Mre11 or HA-tagged CtIP were generated by using Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus expression systems (Invitrogen). Myc-tagged BRCA1 full-length and deletion mutant (248-end) were subcloned into a mammalian expression vector, pcDNA3β, containing the sequence encoding the Myc epitope (46Chen J. Silver D.P.

GST-fused CtIP fragments were constructed by cloning PCR products into pGEX4T-1 (GE Healthcare). Silencing of endogenous CtIP in U2OS and BJ cells was achieved by retroviral infection using pMKO vector to produce shRNAs (47Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B.

Immunoprecipitation, in Vitro Binding, and Immunofluorescence—Immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis were performed as described (46Chen J. Silver D.P. Walpita D. Cantor S.B. Gazdar A.F.

FLAG-Nbs1, FLAG-Mre11, or HA-CtIP was expressed in insect cells. FLAG-Nbs1 was purified using anti-FLAG M2 agarose (Sigma) and eluted with 3× FLAG peptide (Sigma). GST-fused CtIP fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified using glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare). In vitro binding was performed in NETN buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40). For immunostaining, the cells were fixed by 70% methanol and 30% acetone at -20 °C overnight, followed by immunostaining analysis as described (48Wu X. Petrini J.H. Heine W.F. Weaver D.T. Livingston D.M. Chen J. Science. 2000; 289: 11Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Antibodies—The polyclonal antibodies against Nbs1 (D29), Mre11 (D27), and the monoclonal antibody against Nbs1 (EE15) were described previously (49Wu X. Ranganathan V. Weisman D.S. Heine W.F.

BRCA1 polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with GST-fused BRCA1 fragments 1–324 or 1314–1863 and were affinity-purified. Monoclonal anti-CtIP antibody was generously provided by Richard Baer (51Yu X. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18541-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). The other antibodies used were purchased from Oncogene (RPA2), Upstate (Rad50), Cell Signaling Technology (Chk1-pS317), R & D Systems (Chk1), Cal-Biochem (monoclonal anti-BRCA1, MS110), Sigma (M2), Covance (HA 11), and Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Ku70). Homologous Recombination Assay—U2OS cells were transfected with DR-GFP (a generous gift from Andrew Pierce and Maria Jasin) (52Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar), and stable clones carrying a single copy of DR-GFP were identified by Southern blot analysis. To determine the efficiency of HR-mediated DSB repair in CtIP-proficient or -deficient cells, U2OS (DR-GFP) cells were infected with retroviruses expressing two different shRNAs against CtIP or empty vector. Subsequently, the cells were transfected with I-Sce1 expression vector (52Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar, 53Johnson R.D. Liu N. Jasin M. Nature. 1999; 401: 397-399Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGene HD transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science). 48 h after I-Sce1 transfection, flow cytometric analysis was used to determine GFP-positive cells. CDK Activity Is Required for Efficient Interaction of BRCA1 with MRN before and after DNA Damage—BRCA1 and MRN were colocalized at damage-induced foci, and their interaction was enhanced following IR treatment (9Zhong Q.

Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). CtIP was identified in a BRCA1- and MRN-containing complex (19Greenberg R.A. Sobhian B. Pathania S. Cantor S.B. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). To understand the biological function of the BRCA1·CtIP·MRN complex, we further analyzed the interaction of BRCA1 with MRN during the cell cycle and upon DNA damage. The interaction of BRCA1 and CtIP is cell cycle-dependent through the binding of the BRCT domain of BRCA1 with CtIP (26Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). We synchronized T98G cells by serum starvation and found that MRN was coimmunoprecipitated with BRCA1 when cells enter the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle in a similar manner as the association of BRCA1 with CtIP (Fig. 1A and data not shown). These data suggest that BRCA1, CtIP, and MRN form a protein complex when cells enter the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. The interaction of BRCA1 and Nbs1 is stimulated by IR treatment when cells are in S/G2 (Fig. 1B), similar to the results from asynchronized cells (11Wu X. Rathbun G. Lane W.S. Weaver D.T. Livingston D.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar, 19Greenberg R.A. Sobhian B. Pathania S. Cantor S.B. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). The interaction of BRCA1 and CtIP depends on CDK-mediated phosphorylation of Ser327 on CtIP (26Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). To examine whether the BRCA1 and MRN interaction is also CDK-dependent, we treated the human breast carcinoma cell line HBL-100 with the CDK inhibitor roscovitine. As shown in Fig. 1C, the interaction of BRCA1 and MRN is diminished after roscovitine treatment (compare immunoprecipitation samples without IR treatment with or without roscovitine). More strikingly, inhibition of CDK activities also abolished IR-enhanced interaction of BRCA1 and MRN. Similar results were obtained when T98G and U2OS cells were used (data not shown). These data suggest that CDK plays a critical role in the regulation of the interaction of BRCA1 with MRN. CtIP Directly Interacts with Nbs1 and Is Required for Efficient Interaction of BRCA1 with MRN—The similar binding patterns of BRCA1 with CtIP and with MRN prompted us to test whether the interaction of BRCA1 with MRN depends on CtIP. U2OS and T98G cells were infected with retroviruses expressing shRNAs against CtIP or the vector control MKO (47Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W.

The association of Nbs1 with BRCA1 was significantly reduced when the expression of CtIP was suppressed (Fig. 2A and data not shown). Consistently, a BRCA1 C-terminal truncation mutant deleted for the last 11 residues (Tyr1853 to stop) exhibits much weaker interaction with MRN compared with wild type BRCA1 (Fig. 2B, left panel). This BRCA1 truncation mutant destabilizes the BRCT folding (54Williams R.S. Green R. Glover J.N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 838-842Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 55Williams R.S.

Chem. 2003; 278: 53007-53016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar) and is impaired in binding with CtIP (24Li S. Chen P.L. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Tomlinson G. Osborne C.K. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 11334-11338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Moreover, as shown in Fig. 2B (right panel; and data not shown), the interaction of BRCA1 with MRN is much weaker in the BRCA1 mutant cell line HCC1937 than in its derivative cell line reconstituted with wild type BRCA1 (56Scully R. Ganesan S. Vlasakova K. Chen J. Socolovsky M. Livingston D.M. Mol. Cell. 1999; 4: 1093-1099Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). HCC 1937 expresses a BRCA1 truncation mutant deleted for one of the C-terminal tandem BRCT repeats, and thus these data suggest that the C-terminal part of BRCA1 is important for BRCA1 to interact with MRN. Furthermore, because the BRCT domains are required for BRCA1 to interact with CtIP, these results further support the idea that the interaction of BRCA1 with CtIP is needed for efficient interaction of BRCA1 with MRN. To test whether CtIP might directly interact with MRN, we infected insect cells with baculoviruses expressing FLAG-tagged Nbs1 and Mre11 as well as HA-tagged CtIP. Immunoprecipitation reveals that Nbs1, but not Mre11, directly interacts with CtIP (Fig. 2C). We also examined the interaction of FLAG-tagged Nbs1 expressed and purified from insect cells with a series of GST-tagged CtIP fragments produced and purified from bacteria. Both N- and C-terminal CtIP fragments efficiently interact with Nbs1 (Fig. 2D). Therefore, Nbs1 can directly interact with CtIP in the absence of BRCA1 in vitro and raises a possibility that CtIP bridges the interaction of BRCA1 with MRN. Although Nbs1 can directly interact with CtIP in vitro, the in vivo interaction of Nbs1 with CtIP is significantly strengthened when Nbs1 forms a complex with Mre11 and Rad50. Mutation of two conserved lysine residues (Lys686 and Lys690) to alanine residues completely abolished the interaction of Nbs1 with Mre11/Rad50 (data not shown). We transfected 293T cells with Myc-tagged Nbs1 and the Nbs1 mutant (K686A,K690A) along with HA-tagged CtIP. The association of the Nbs1 (K686A,K690A) mutant with CtIP is much weaker than that of wild type Nbs1 (Fig. 2E). These data suggest that forming the MRN complex is important for an efficient association of MRN with CtIP in vivo, although Nbs1 can directly interact with CtIP. Because BRCA1 is present in vivo, this optimal interaction of MRN with CtIP may be due to a stable complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN. Both the N Terminus and C Terminus of BRCA1 Are Important for Stable Complex Formation of BRCA1, CtIP, and MRN—Because the C-terminal BRCT domains are required for BRCA1 to interact with CtIP and MRN in vivo, we examined whether the C-terminal BRCA1 fragment is sufficient to bind MRN. The GST-BRCA1 C-terminal fragment (residues 1314–1863) was incubated with cell lysates prepared from U2OS cells. Intriguingly, this fragment does not sufficiently pull down MRN from mammalian cell lysates, although it strongly interacts with CtIP (Fig. 2F). These data suggest that although CtIP is important for the interaction of BRCA1 with MRN in vivo, it is not sufficient to bridge the interaction of MRN with the BRCA1 C-terminal fragment alone. Other parts of BRCA1 in addition to the CtIP binding domain (the BRCT repeats) may be required for BRCA1 to form a stable complex with MRN. It was described previously that the N-terminal fragment of BRCA1 interacts with MRN in vivo (11Wu X. Rathbun G. Lane W.S. Weaver D.T. Livingston D.M. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 2000; 65: 535-545Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). We further demonstrated that the GST-BRCA1 N-terminal fragment (residues 1–324) interacts with FLAG-Nbs1 expressed in insect cells (Fig. 2G). These data suggest that the N terminus of BRCA1 also directly contacts with Nbs1, and this interaction may contribute to stable complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN. Consistently, a BRCA1 N-terminal truncation mutant deleted for the first 247 residues is significantly impaired in its interaction with endogenous MRN (Fig. 2H). Collectively, our studies suggest that BRCA1 interacts with MRN through both the N and C termini of BRCA1 and CtIP bridges the C terminus interaction between BRCA1 and Nbs1 (Fig. 2I). Both N- and C-terminal interactions of BRCA1 are important for stable complex formation of BRCA1, CtIP, and MRN in vivo. Suppression of CtIP Expression Leads to a Defect in DSB Repair—Because both BRCA1 and MRN participate in DSB repair, association of CtIP with BRCA1 and MRN prompted us to investigate whether CtIP is also important for DSB repair. We inhibited the expression of endogenous CtIP in U2OS by retroviral infection of two shRNAs directed against different sites in CtIP mRNA (Fig. 3A, top panel), using retroviral shRNA vector MKO (47Masutomi K. Yu E.Y. Khurts S. Ben Porath I. Currier J.L. Metz G.B. Brooks M.W. Kaneko S. Murakami S. DeCaprio J.A. Weinberg R.A. Stewart S.A. Hahn W.C. Cell. 2003; 114: 241-253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (654) Google Scholar). Suppression of CtIP expression led to defective Chk1 phosphorylation after IR as described previously (Ref. 26Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar and Fig. 3B). We did not detect a significant difference in cell growth when the expression of CtIP was suppressed by shRNAs under the condition we used (data not shown). However, suppression of CtIP expression led to a significant increase of radiation sensitivity (Fig. 3C). These data suggest that CtIP may play an important role in DNA DSB repair. To more directly examine the role of CtIP in DSB repair, we performed the well established DSB repair assay using I-Sce1 endonuclease to introduce chromosomal DSBs in mammalian cells (57Johnson R.D. Jasin M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2001; 29: 196-201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A homologous recombination reporter DR-GFP composed of two mutated GFP cassettes, SceGFP and iGFP, in a directed orientation, was introduced into U2OS cells (Ref. 52Pierce A.J. Johnson R.D. Thompson L.H. Jasin M. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2633-2638Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar and Fig. 3D, left panel). In this assay, transient expression of I-Sce1 endonuclease would create a DSB and when such a DSB is repaired by a gene conversion event, a functional GFP gene is restored. U2OS cell lines carrying the intact DR-GFP substrate were infected with retroviruses expressing shRNAs against CtIP, and the vector MKO was used as a control. The percentage of GFP-positive cells was significantly lower in CtIP-shRNA-expressing cells compared with the vector control after I-Sce1 transfection (Fig. 3D, right panel). These data suggest that CtIP is important for efficient DSB repair through the HR pathway. To further examine whether the complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN is important for DSB repair, we took advantage of the CtIP mutant S327A, mutated at a critical CDK phosphorylation site and defective in BRCA1 binding (26Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). This mutant exhibited radiation sensitivity compared with wild type CtIP when endogenous CtIP expression is suppressed by RNAi (Fig. 3E). Because the interaction of BRCA1 with CtIP is required for efficient association of BRCA1 with MRN (Fig. 2, A and B), these data suggest that the complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN is critical for DSB repair, and CDK plays an important role in this respect through regulating the complex formation. CtIP and the C Terminus of BRCA1 Are Important for Generating ssDNA after IR—Ctp1, the fission yeast homolog of CtIP, is required for HR, and resection of DSB ends to generate ssDNA (37Limbo O. Chahwan C. Yamada Y. de Bruin R.A. Wittenberg C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 134-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, CtIP is required for ATR-mediated Chk1 phosphorylation that depends on ssDNA as activation signals (26Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Moreover, CtIP is in a complex with MRN that carries DSB resection function (16Jazayeri A. Falck J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 18Myers J.S. Cortez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9346-9350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). To test whether CtIP plays a similar role in processing DSBs as Ctp in fission yeast, we examined whether IR-induced RPA foci formation requires CtIP function. RPA directly binds to ssDNA and has been used as a readout for ssDNA formation (16Jazayeri A. Falck J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar, 18Myers J.S. Cortez D. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 9346-9350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar, 58Zou L. Elledge S.J. Science. 2003; 300: 1542-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (2059) Google Scholar). IR-induced RPA foci only occur in cyclin A-positive cells, suggesting that DSB resection is activated in S and G2 phases of the cell cycle (16Jazayeri A. Falck J. Lukas C. Bartek J. Smith G.C. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). Suppression of CtIP expression significantly reduced RPA foci formation after IR (Fig. 4A, left panel), consistent with the findings from other investigators (40Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). These data suggest that human CtIP is involved in processing DSB ends to form ssDNAs that are required for HR. Because BRCA1 is also required for Chk1 activation and ssDNA formation (59Yarden R.I. Pardo-Reoyo S. Sgagias M. Cowan K.H. Brody L.C. Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 285-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 60Schlegel B.P. Jodelka F.M. Nunez R. Cancer Res. 2006; 66: 5181-5189Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), we examined whether its interaction with CtIP and MRN are important for IR-induced ssDNA formation. We monitored RPA foci formation in HCC1937 and its derivative reconstituted with wild type BRCA1. Significantly, IR-induced RPA foci formation is impaired in HCC1937 compared with the wild type BRCA1 reconstituted cell line (Fig. 4A, right panel). Because the interaction of BRCA1 and MRN is impaired in HCC1937 (Fig. 2B, right panel), these data favors the idea that forming a functional complex of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN is important for facilitating DNA resection at DSB ends to generate ssDNA and thus is required for efficient checkpoint activation and HR-mediated DSB repair. IR-induced Damage Foci Formation of CtIP and MRN Is Independent from Each Other—In fission yeast, recruitment of Ctp to DSBs depends on Mre11 (37Limbo O. Chahwan C. Yamada Y. de Bruin R.A. Wittenberg C. Russell P. Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 134-146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, IR-induced CtIP foci are colocalized with that of Mre11 and Nbs1 (Fig. 4B). However, the foci formation of CtIP and MRN appears to be independent from each other. CtIP depletion does not influence Mre11 and Nbs1 foci formation (Fig. 4C). Similarly, CtIP forms similar levels of IR-induced foci in Nbs1-deficient cell line GM07166 and its derivative reconstituted with Nbs1 (Fig. 4D). These data suggest that although BRCA1, CtIP, and MRN form a complex that is stimulated by DNA damage, these proteins can be independently recruited to DSBs in mammalian cells. While our manuscript was under preparation, Sartori et al. (40Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) published results consistent with our findings that CtIP interacts with MRN and promotes DNA end resection. In our study, we further elucidate that BRCA1 forms a complex with CtIP and MRN in a cell cycle-regulated manner. Our studies suggest that not only CtIP and MRN, but also formation of the complex BRCA1·CtIP·MRN are important for DSB end resection and HR-mediated DSB repair. These studies underline a critical mechanism for BRCA1 to participate in HR-mediated-DSB repair. We demonstrate that BRCA1, CtIP, and MRN form a complex when cells enter the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, and the complex formation requires CDK activity. CtIP directly interacts with Nbs1 in vitro, and the in vivo interaction of BRCA1 with MRN is largely dependent on the presence of CtIP. It has been described that the interaction of BRCA1 and CtIP requires the CDK-mediated phosphorylation at Ser327 (26Yu X. Chen J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 9478-9486Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Here we show that the C-terminal BRCT domains, required for CtIP association, are also needed for efficient interaction of BRCA1 with MRN. Based on these studies, we favor the model that MRN is recruited by CtIP to form a complex with BRCA1 after CtIP is phosphorylated by CDK at least at Ser327 in late S and G2 phases of the cell cycle. Meanwhile, we showed that the N terminus of BRCA1 is also important for BRCA1 to interact with MRN in vivo. Thus, after MRN is recruited by CtIP to BRCA1 in S and G2, stable complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN requires both the N terminus and C terminus of BRCA1 (Fig. 2I). Significantly, our studies demonstrate that CDK is not only needed for BRCA1 to interact with MRN during the cell cycle but is also important for IR-stimulated association of BRCA1 with MRN. This regulation has important implications in the control of HR-mediated DSB repair in a cell cycle-dependent manner (see below). It has been described that checkpoint kinases contribute to the stimulation of the interaction of BRCA1 with MRN (19Greenberg R.A. Sobhian B. Pathania S. Cantor S.B. Nakatani Y. Livingston D.M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 34-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). We propose that CDK-dependent phosphorylation events initiate the complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN, whereas subsequent checkpoint-mediated phosphorylation events on each component of the complex may further strengthen the interaction and lead to more stable complex formation after IR. For instance, BRCA1 interacts with CtIP after it is phosphorylated by CDK at Ser327, recruiting MRN to form a complex with BRCA1, and this cell cycle-specific complex formation of BRCA1, CtIP, and MRN is a prerequisite for further checkpoint-mediated stimulation of the interactions among the subunits of the complex in response to DNA damage. Consistent with the work by Sartori et al. (40Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar), we showed that CtIP is important for DSB resection to generate ssDNA and HR-mediated DSB repair. CtIP is not only involved in end resection for camptothecin-induced DSBs in S phase (40Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) but is also needed when cells are treated with IR when DSBs are induced in S/G2 (this study). Our studies also further demonstrated that the BRCA1 C-terminal truncation mutants defective in CtIP and MRN association are significantly impaired in ssDNA formation at the early time points after IR. Moreover, CDK-mediated phosphorylation of CtIP at Ser327, a critical event to establish the association of BRCA1 with CtIP and thus the complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN, is important for cellular radiation resistance. Because CtIP-S327A impairs the association of BRCA1 with CtIP, but not the interaction of CtIP with MRN, 4L. Chen and X. Wu, unpublished data. our studies suggest a critical role of BRCA1 for HR-mediated DSB repair through its interaction with CtIP and MRN. It has been described that CtIP promotes the nuclease activity of Mre11 (40Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar). It will be interesting to examine whether the association of BRCA1 with CtIP·MRN further modulates the nuclease activity of Mre11, thereby facilitating ssDNA formation at DSBs. HR-mediated DSB repair is activated when cells enter the S and G2 phases of the cell cycle, and CDK activity is important for this control (28Sonoda E. Hochegger H. Saberi A. Taniguchi Y. Takeda S. DNA Repair. 2006; 5: 1021-1029Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms underlying this regulation and the CDK targets that are directly involved in DSB repair are not clear. Our studies highlight a critical role for the complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN in processing DSB ends to generate ssDNAs, thereby providing evidence of how BRCA1 participates in HR-mediated DSB repair. Because the complex is specifically formed in S and G2 phases and requires CDK activities, these studies suggest that one important mechanism by which CDK participates in the regulation of HR-mediated DSB repair is to regulate complex formation of BRCA1·CtIP·MRN.

A high concentration of the endogenous reducing agent, thioredoxin, is present in rheumatoid arthritis and may reduce secretion of matrix metalloproteinases by its inhibition of TRPC1 and TRPC5. Mammalian homologues of Drosophila melanogaster transient receptor potential (TRP) are a large family of multimeric cation channels that act, or putatively act, as sensors of one or more chemical factor1,2. Major research objectives are the identification of endogenous activators and the determination of cellular and tissue functions of these channels. Here we show the activation of TRPC5 (canonical TRP 5) homomultimeric and TRPC5–TRPC1 heteromultimeric channels3,4,5 by extracellular reduced thioredoxin, which acts by breaking a disulphide bridge in the predicted extracellular loop adjacent to the ion-selectivity filter of TRPC5. Thioredoxin is an endogenous redox protein with established intracellular functions, but it is also secreted and its extracellular targets are largely unknown6,7,8,9. Particularly high extracellular concentrations of thioredoxin are apparent in rheumatoid arthritis8,10,11,12, an inflammatory joint disease that disables millions of people worldwide13. We show that TRPC5 and TRPC1 are expressed in secretory fibroblast-like synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, that endogenous TRPC5–TRPC1 channels of the cells are activated by reduced thioredoxin, and that blockade of the channels enhances secretory activity and prevents the suppression of secretion by thioredoxin. The data indicate the presence of a previously unrecognized ion-channel activation mechanism that couples extracellular thioredoxin to cell function."
https://openalex.org/W1993103003,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is associated with the deposition of the 39- to 43-amino acid beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) in the brain. C-terminal fragments (CTFs) of amyloid precursor protein (APP) can accumulate in endosomally derived multivesicular bodies (MVBs). These intracellular structures contain intraluminal vesicles that are released from the cell as exosomes when the MVB fuses with the plasma membrane. Here we have investigated the role of exosomes in the processing of APP and show that these vesicles contain APP-CTFs, as well as Abeta. In addition, inhibition of gamma-secretase results in a significant increase in the amount of alpha- and beta-secretase cleavage, further increasing the amount of APP-CTFs contained within these exosomes. We identify several key members of the secretase family of proteases (BACE, PS1, PS2, and ADAM10) to be localized in exosomes, suggesting they may be a previously unidentified site of APP cleavage. These results provide further evidence for a novel pathway in which APP fragments are released from cells and have implications for the analysis of APP processing and diagnostics for Alzheimer's disease."
https://openalex.org/W2047330514,"Background Transcriptional profiling using microarrays provides a unique opportunity to decipher host pathogen cross-talk on the global level. Here, for the first time, we have been able to investigate gene expression changes in both Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a major human pathogen, and its human host cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. Methodology/Principal Findings In addition to common responses, we could identify eukaryotic and microbial transcriptional signatures that are specific to the cell type involved in the infection process. In particular M. tuberculosis shows a marked stress response when inside dendritic cells, which is in accordance with the low permissivity of these specialized phagocytes to the tubercle bacillus and to other pathogens. In contrast, the mycobacterial transcriptome inside macrophages reflects that of replicating bacteria. On the host cell side, differential responses to infection in macrophages and dendritic cells were identified in genes involved in oxidative stress, intracellular vesicle trafficking and phagosome acidification. Conclusions/Significance This study provides the proof of principle that probing the host and the microbe transcriptomes simultaneously is a valuable means to accessing unique information on host pathogen interactions. Our results also underline the extraordinary plasticity of host cell and pathogen responses to infection, and provide a solid framework to further understand the complex mechanisms involved in immunity to M. tuberculosis and in mycobacterial adaptation to different intracellular environments."

Here we report that in neurons of p62–/– mouse brain there is a detectable increase in ubiquitin staining paralleled by accumulation of insoluble ubiquitinated proteins. The absolute amount of each ubiquitin chain linkage measured by quantitative mass spectrometry demonstrated hyperaccumulation of Lys63 chains in the insoluble fraction recovered from the brain of p62–/– mice, which correlated with increased levels of Lys63-ubiquitinated TrkA receptor. The increase in Lys63 chains was attributed in part to diminished activity of the TRAF6-interacting the Lys63-deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), cylindromatosis tumor suppressor (CYLD). The interaction of CYLD with TRAF6 was dependent upon p62, thus defining a mechanism that accounts for decreased activity of CYLD in the absence of p62. These findings reveal that p62 serves as an adapter for the formation of this complex, thereby regulating the DUB activity of CYLD by TRAF6 interaction. Thus, p62 has a bifunctional role in regulation of an E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, TRAF6, and a DUB, CYLD, to balance the turnover of Lys63-polyubiquitinated proteins such as TrkA.

An attractive hypothesis would be that the UBA domain of p62 may have a role in sequestering ubiquitinated proteins to cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. However, there is limited information about the role that p62 could have in the formation of inclusions in, for example, the brain, which would be relevant to understanding its role in the initiation or progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, studies in animal models or genetically inactivated p62 would be instrumental for the establishment of such a potential novel role for p62. Interestingly, p62 has been demonstrated to be critically involved in the control of receptor trafficking, specifically of the neurotrophin receptor family, tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) A, B, and C (7Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We have shown that TrkA ubiquitination is essential for neurotrophin-dependent receptor internalization, cell differentiation, and signaling (8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). In this regard, the fact that p62 interacts with all members of the Trk family in a ligand-dependent manner (7Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggests that p62 may serve a common and conserved function in the neurotrophin signaling cascades. Importantly, there is a growing realization that the receptor trafficking pathways and pathways whereby inclusion bodies form, a hallmark of neurodegenerative diseases, share overlapping constituents (8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Here, we have established, using mice with genetic inactivation of p62, that this protein plays a critical role in regulating the turnover of lysine 63-ubiquitinated proteins, providing a new perspective on the role of this protein in its function as an adapter.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—Mouse TrkA (B-3), ubiquitin, HA, CYLD (cylindromatosis tumor suppressor), Myc, and rabbit Trk (C-14) were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, San Diego, CA. FLAG and tubulin antibodies were obtained from Sigma. 2.5 S nerve growth factor (NGF) was from Bioproducts for Science (Indianapolis, IN).Animal Model—Knock-out mice (p62–/–) were generated as described previously (9Rodriguez A. Duran A. Selloum M. Champy M. Diez-Guerra F. Flores J. Serrano M. Auwerx H. Diaz-Meco M.T. Moscat J. Cell Metab. 2006; 3: 211-222Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). All animals employed in this study were handled according to the Auburn University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, which abides by National Institutes of Health guidelines.Biochemical Fractionation—Soluble and insoluble fractions (RAB, RIPA, and formic acid (FA)) were prepared as described (10Tanemura K. Murayama M. Agagi T. Hashikawa T. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 133-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein was determined using the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories). For co-interaction/-immunoprecipitation, the cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCL, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm NaF, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 mg/ml leupeptin and aprotinin (3Seibenhener M.L.

Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For the immunoprecipitation of ubiquitin conjugates, 1% SDS was added to the lysis buffer. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and Western blotted with appropriate antibodies.Ubiquitin (Ub)-AQUA (Absolute Quantification of Proteins) Analysis—For mass spectrometry analysis, the FA fraction from wild type (WT) and p62–/– brain was neutralized with Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 (10Tanemura K. Murayama M. Agagi T. Hashikawa T. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 133-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and solubilized in RIPA buffer. Total ubiquitinated proteins or Trk receptors (C-14 antibody) were immunopurified and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Duplicate samples were processed for silver staining and Western blot. The gel region containing ubiquitin or Ub-TrkA (B-3) was aligned with the blot, excised, and digested using 15 ng/ml trypsin. Heavy isotope-labeled internal peptides corresponding to all seven types of human poly-Ub linkages were synthesized and quantified by amino acid analysis (Cell Signaling Technology, Inc., Beverly, MA). After in-gel digestion, the sample and heavy isotope-labeled internal standard were analyzed by LCQ-DECA XP ion mass spectrometer. This included analysis of di-glycine-tagged signature peptides at Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63. All seven linkages were quantified simultaneously in the same run as described (11Kirkpatrick D.S. Hathaway N.A. Hanna J. Elsasser S. Rush J. Finley D. King R.W. Gygi S.P. Nat. Cell Biol. 2006; 8: 700-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin chains were quantified by the ratio between endogenous peptide versus the internal standard. Each sample was quantified three times to obtain the relative standard deviation in measurements.Proteasome Assay—The peptidyl glutamyl peptide-hydrolyzing activity (PGPH) activity of the proteasome was measured with benzyloxycarbonyl-Leu-Leu-Glu-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (Z-LLE-AMC), a specific fluorogenic peptide substrate (12Vigouroux S. Furukawa Y. Farout L. Kish S.J. Briand M. Briand Y. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The subunit composition of the proteasome was analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to the 20 S subunits β1, β2, and β5 (Biomol International, Plymouth Meeting, PA).Histochemistry—The brains were dissected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. Each brain was processed and embedded in paraffin; 5-μm sections were cut for immunohistochemical staining with antibody to ubiquitin or TrkA (13Capsoni S. Ugolini G. Comparini A. Ruberti F. Berardi N. Cattaneo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6826-6831Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) and processed employing the Histostain DS kit from Zymed Laboratories, San Francisco, CA.Cell Culture and Transfection—Human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK) cells and pheochromocytoma (PC12) cells were grown as described (7Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells were transfected employing a calcium phosphate method using the mammalian cell transfection kit (Chemicon Int., Temecula, CA) and PC12 cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen).NGF Internalization—Iodinated NGF was prepared, and NGF internalization was examined by the acid wash technique (7Geetha T. Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Specific binding was calculated in the presence or absence of cold NGF.Deubiquitinating Enzyme (DUB) Assay—Lys63 chains were kindly provided by Cecile Pickart, Johns Hopkins University. The DUB assay was conducted as described (14Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Coutois G. Nature. 2003; 424: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar). In brief, CYLD was immunoprecipitated from 2 mg of 6-month-old WT and p62–/– brain homogenate prepared in 25 mm Tris, pH 7.2, 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm NaF, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and protease inhibitors and collected with agarose-coupled secondary antibody. The DUB activity of CYLD was measured in a 50-μl assay (DUB buffer: 50 mm HEPES, 0.5 mm EDTA, 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) along with 1 ng of Lys63 ubiquitin chains, with continuous shaking at 37 °C for 4 h, and then washing three times with DUB buffer. The chains were released by boiling in SDS-PAGE sample buffer, electrophoresed on 12% SDS-PAGE, and Western blotted with anti-ubiquitin and anti-CYLD.GST-UBA Pulldown Assay—JM109 Escherichia coli cells were induced with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and lysed in NETN buffer (20 mm, Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The GST-tagged UBA domain of p62 was bound to glutathione-agarose overnight at 4 °C followed by washing five times with NETN buffer (3Seibenhener M.L. Babu J.R. Geetha T. Wong H.C. Krishna N.R. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8055-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The purity of the preparation was validated by 12% SDS-PAGE, Coomassie blue staining, and/or Western blot analysis with GST antibody. The GST-UBA domain captured on agarose beads was washed three times with binding buffer prior to use in an interaction assay. Five μg of GST-UBA domain was added to 750 μg of PC12 cell lysate and rotated for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with binding buffer, and SDS-PAGE sample buffer was added and analyzed by 7.5% SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with HA antibody to detect bound ubiquitinated TrkA.Experimental Design—Unless otherwise noted, all experiments employing brain lysates were conducted on WT and p62–/– mice 6 months of age. All experiments were repeated at least three times, and statistical significance was tested employing Student's t test.RESULTSUbiquitin Accumulates in p62–/– Brain—To analyze the potential role of p62 in the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in brain, sections of brain from WT and p62–/– mice were immunostained with anti-ubiquitin antibody (Fig. 1A). Light microscopic analysis failed to detect any plaques, aggregates, or inclusions in neurons localized to the thalamus, hippocampus, cortex or amygdala of p62–/– mouse brain taken at 6 months of age or at later ages (up to 18 months; not shown). However, prominent staining of ubiquitin in the cell body and axons was noted. The solubility of polyubiquitin was examined by sequential extraction in high salt buffer (RAB) without and with detergent (RIPA). Finally, the RIPA-insoluble material was subjected to extraction with FA. This differential extraction method is often used as a quantitative measure of protein aggregation (10Tanemura K. Murayama M. Agagi T. Hashikawa T. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 133-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where the solubility of the aggregated insoluble protein shifts to the FA fraction. When lysates from WT and p62–/– brain were extracted in this manner, a shift in the solubility of the extracted ubiquitinated proteins from the soluble to the highly insoluble FA fraction was observed in p62–/– samples compared with those from WT mice (Fig. 1B). To better understand the timed sequential nature of this observation, FA fractions isolated from 2-, 6-, and 12-month-old animals reveal that the p62–/– mice did not accumulate significant amounts of polyubiquitin until 6 months of age (Fig. 1C). Because the proteasome may be overloaded by the accumulation of polyubiquitin-containing aggresomes (15Bennett E.J. Bence N.F. Jayakumar R. Kopito R.R. Mol. Cell. 2005; 17: 351-365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), the activity of the proteasome was tested by measuring PGPH activity (12Vigouroux S. Furukawa Y. Farout L. Kish S.J. Briand M. Briand Y. J. Neurochem. 2003; 84: 392-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Compared with WT, lysates from p62–/– brain exhibited a slight, but significant, decline in PGPH activity; however, no differences were observed in the activity of trypsin or chymotrypsin (not shown) or in the expression of proteasome subunits (Fig. 1D). No significant differences were observed in proteasome activity recovered from mice up to 12 months of age (not shown). Because such a distinct pattern of polyubiquitin accumulation was observed in the FA fraction from the p62–/– mice, we wondered whether there was a selective increase in a particular type ubiquitin chain. To address this question, quantitative mass spectrometry of ubiquitin revealed selective hyperaccumulation of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains in the samples recovered from p62–/– brain compared with WT (Fig. 2). To account for the selective increase in these chains, we reasoned that these chains might accumulate due to inhibition of an ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase-L1 (UCH-L1). This enzyme has been shown to colocalize with p62 in cultured cells (16Wang Z. Figueiredo-Pereira M.E. Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 2005; 29: 222-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). However, analysis of UCH-L1 activity (17Wilkinson K.D. Lee K.M. Deshpande S. Duerksen-Hughes P. Boxx J.M. Pohl S. Science. 1989; 246: 670-673Crossref PubMed Scopus (755) Google Scholar) in brain from WT and p62–/– mice revealed no significant differences. 3L. Yin, M. W. Wooten, and K. Wilkinson, unpublished observation.FIGURE 2Hyperaccumulation of Lys63-ubiquitin chains in p62–/– brain lysates.

Wooten M.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4730-4739Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and interaction with p62 is necessary for TrkA signaling, internalization, and differentiation through a TRAF6-dependent mechanism (8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). TRAF6 is a signaling adapter that plays an important role in the Lys63 polyubiquitination of several signaling proteins (2Moscat J.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Wooten M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 95-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). In light of these findings, together with the fact that the loss of p62 promotes the accumulation of Lys63-polyubiquitinated proteins (Fig. 2), we reasoned that an absence of p62 may lead to misdirection of TrkA and its accumulation. To test this idea, we subjected brain lysates to sequential detergent/acid extraction (10Tanemura K. Murayama M. Agagi T. Hashikawa T. Tominaga T. Ichikawa M. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 133-141Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The resulting insoluble material was immunoprecipitated with a pan-Trk antibody that recognizes Trk A, B, and C receptors. Ubiquitinated TrkA receptors accumulated in the FA fraction of p62–/– brain but not of WT (Fig. 3A). We next examined the immunostaining pattern of TrkA in WT and p62–/– brain sections (Fig. 3B). The staining of TrkA in pyramidal neurons from p62–/– mice was largely confined to the somatodendritic compartment (Fig. 3B, inset). Quantitative analysis of TrkA staining confirmed this observation was significant (Fig. 3B). This distinct localization pattern in p62–/– neurons suggest that p62 may affect TrkA trafficking. Analysis of immunopurified Trk by mass spectrometry revealed equal distribution of Lys63- and Lys48-linked ubiquitin chains associated with the receptor in samples from WT mice. However, Trk receptor recovered from p62–/– brain was predominantly of the Lys63 form (Fig. 3C). consistent with hyperaccumulation of Lys63-ubiquitinated proteins in the p62–/– brain (Fig. 2). These findings validated earlier studies employing cotransfection of tagged ubiquitin mutants (8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), which show that TrkA is Lys63-ubiquitinated and reveal a novel role for p62 in the control of the TrkA polyubiquitination state under basal conditions in vivo.FIGURE 3Accumulation of Lys63-ubiquitinated Trk p62–/– mouse brain. A, lysates (1 mg) from the brain of two mice each, WT and p62–/–, were differentially extracted in RAB, RIPA, and FA. Members of the Trk family (A, B, and C) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with C-14 antibody and Western blotted (WB) for TrkA (B-3) and ubiquitin. A fraction of the lysate (50 μg) was blotted for TrkA with B-3 antibody. B, matched paraffin sections from WT and p62–/– mouse brain was stained with TrkA antibody (B-3) and viewed at ×20. Inset: ×100. Three hundred pyramidal neurons were counted, and the presence or absence of somatodendritic TrkA was scored and covered to mean percentage ± S.D. (*, p < 0.05). C, Trks were immunopurified from the FA fraction of WT and p62–/– mouse brain. The distribution of ubiquitin between WT and p62–/– was expressed as the percentage of total ubiquitin (pmol).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The NGF-stimulated Lys63-ubiquitination site in TrkA has been mapped to Lys485 (8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Mutation of this site in TrkA impairs NGF-dependent ubiquitination, internalization, and signaling (8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Thus, we sought to determine whether the ubiquitinated receptor would interact with p62. Co-expression studies conducted in HEK cells revealed that the K485R mutation blocked interaction of p62 with TrkA (Fig. 4A). These findings suggest that ubiquitinated TrkA interacts with p62. To gain insight into the structural interactions between TrkA and p62, the domain of p62 necessary for interaction with TrkA was mapped by undertaking coexpression studies between full-length and either N-terminal or C-terminal UBA deletion mutants of p62 and TrkA (Fig. 4B). Expression of a p62 mutant lacking its UBA domain was defective in TrkA interaction. To further validate that the UBA domain of p62 binds Lys63-polyubiquitinated TrkA, various Lys to Arg mutants of ubiquitin (Lys29, Lys48, Lys63) were expressed in PC12 cells followed by immunoprecipitation of either the endogenous receptor or of the tagged ubiquitin, HA (Fig. 4C). Results from this experiment show that expression of K63R ubiquitin mutant exerts a dominant-negative effect on TrkA interaction with p62. A parallel experiment was conducted wherein the interaction of ubiquitinated TrkA with the UBA domain of p62 was examined in a pulldown assay. Mutation at either Lys29 or Lys48 did not inhibit interaction of polyubiquitin with the p62 UBA domain, whereas K63R completely blocked interaction with the UBA domain (Fig. 4D). Collectively, these findings reveal Lys63-polyubiquitinated TrkA interacts with the UBA domain of p62. We reasoned that if TrkA interaction with the UBA domain of p62 were needed for NGF internalization, the overexpression of a construct lacking the UBA domain might exert a dominant negative effect. Evaluation of NGF internalization revealed that ligand uptake was severely reduced in cells expressing the UBA deletion of p62 (Fig. 4E). Therefore, interaction of ubiquitinated TrkA with the UBA domain of p62 is necessary for TrkA-NGF internalization. Thus, an absence of p62 could lead to accumulation of Lys63-ubiquitinated TrkA.FIGURE 4TrkA interacts with the UBA domain of p62. A, HA-WT TrkA or HA-K485R TrkA was transfected in HEK cells followed by treatment with NGF (50 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated (IP; 1 mg) with anti-HA and immunoblotted with anti-HA and p62. The lysates (50 μg) were also Western blotted (WB) with HA to examine the expression of TrkA. B, HA-tagged TrkA along with Myc-tagged WT p62, ΔN-term, or ΔUBA (as shown) was expressed in HEK 293 cells followed by NGF stimulation (50 ng/ml) for 15 min. The cells were lysed with Triton lysis buffer, and the association of p62 with TrkA was determined by immunoprecipitation of the lysates with antibody to Myc and Western blotting with antibody to HA and Myc. As a control, a fraction of the lysate (50 μg) was blotted with HA antibody to examine expression of TrkA. Expression of Myc-tagged p62 constructs is shown with an arrow. C, PC12 cells were transfected with HA-Ub and various ubiquitin mutants (K39R, K48R, K64R) followed by treatment with NGF for 15 min. The cells were lysed with Triton lysis buffer followed by immunoprecipitation with Trk (C-14) antibody and Western blotting for p62 and TrkA (B-3). Alternatively, the lysates were immunoprecipitated with HA and Western blotted for TrkA (B-3) and p62. The same lysates (500 μg) were employed in a GST-p62 UBA domain pulldown assay, D, the pulldowns were blotted with HA to detect bound ubiquitinated TrkA. E, PC12 cells were transfected with either Myc-tagged p62 (OEp62), ΔUBA, or ΔN-term constructs. After 48 h the cells were incubated with 0.4 μCi/ml [125I]NGF alone or with an excess of unlabeled NGF (200 ng/ml) at 4 °C for 1 h and chased at 37 °C for 0 and 30 min. The cells were lysed, and the specific internalized counts ([125I]NGF internalized–[125I]NGF internalized in the presence of excess NGF) were determined by γ-counting. The mean percentage ± S.D. of NGF internalized was calculated from three different experiments. The data were analyzed using Student's t test (*, p < 0.001).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Association of p62 with a Lys63-DUB, CYLD, Regulates Its Activity—We have previously shown that p62 serves as a scaffold for the recruitment of the E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase, TRAF6, leading to TrkA Lys63 ubiquitination (8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Those observations would be in apparent contradiction with the accumulation of Lys63-ubiquitinated TrkA, a TRAF6 substrate (8Geetha T. Jiang J. Wooten M.W. Mol. Cell. 2005; 20: 301-312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar), in p62–/– brain. An attractive hypothesis that could explain these apparent paradoxical sets of data would be that p62, in addition to its well established role in the activation of TRAF6, might also regulate a DUB enzyme with specificity for Lys63 chains. Intriguingly, CYLD encodes a DUB with specificity toward proteins ubiquitinated through Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains (14Kovalenko A. Chable-Bessia C. Cantarella G. Israel A. Wallach D. Coutois G. Nature. 2003; 424: 801-805Crossref PubMed Scopus (839) Google Scholar) and has been shown to interact with TRAF6. Therefore, we first examined CYLD DUB activity in brain lysates from WT and p62–/– mice and observed that its deubiquitinating activity was significantly diminished in brain lysates taken from p62–/– mice as compared with WT controls (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, the autodeubiquitination of CYLD, a marker of activity (18Meray R.K. Lansbury P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10567-10575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), was likewise absent in p62–/– lysates (Fig. 5B), which is consistent with reduced CYLD DUB activity (Fig. 5A). These findings suggest that p62 serves as an adapter to regulate the ubiquitination of CYLD, which in turn regulates its ability to hydrolyze Lys63 chains. Because p62 has a TRAF6 binding site (2Moscat J.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Wooten M.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2007; 32: 95-100Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar), we first examined whether CYLD was physically associated with p62 (Fig. 5C). The association between CYLD and TRAF6 or p62 and CYLD was readily detected in brain lysates of WT but not p62–/– mice, sugges"

This study examined the kidney Sepp1 uptake pathway.

Neither the C terminus selenocysteine-rich domain of Sepp1 nor ApoER2 was required for Sepp1 uptake by proximal tubules. Tissue ligand binding assays using cryosections of Sepp1-/- kidneys revealed that the proximal tubule epithelium contained Sepp1-binding sites that were blocked by the receptor-associated protein, RAP, an inhibitor of lipoprotein receptor-ligand interactions. Ligand blotting assays of kidney membrane preparations fractionated by SDS-PAGE revealed that Sepp1 binds megalin, a lipoprotein receptor localized to the proximal tubule epithelium. Immunolocalization analyses confirmed the in vivo co-localization of Sepp1 and megalin in wild type kidneys and demonstrated the absence of proximal tubule Sepp1 uptake in megalin null mice.

Sepp1 is the only selenoprotein whose primary structure contains more than one selenocysteine residue, and human, mouse, and rat Sepp1 each contain 10 residues (2Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 2005; 25: 215-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Sepp1 is expressed in most tissues. However, the liver is the predominant site of its production and secretion to the blood, where it accounts for ∼65% of the plasma selenium content. Gpx3 also is expressed at low levels in several tissues, but the kidneys represent its principal site of production and secretion to blood (3Whitin J.C. Bhamre S. Tham D.M. Cohen H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F20-F28Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Both Sepp1 and Gpx3 are proposed to function as extracellular antioxidants. However, recent studies have demonstrated that Sepp1 also performs a critical role in selenium transport throughout the body. Mice with deletion of the selenoprotein P gene (Sepp1-/-) have reduced selenium levels in the brain, testis, and kidney (4Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F.

J. 2003; 370: 397-402Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar). These animals also show abnormal neurological function, male infertility, and reduced plasma Gpx3 activity, consistent with reduced brain, testis, and kidney selenium levels. Furthermore mice with liver-specific inactivation of selenoprotein synthesis show reduced levels of plasma and kidney glutathione peroxidase activity, which is further evidence that liver Sepp1 provides selenium to the kidney (6Schweizer U. Streckfuss F. Pelt P. Carlson B.A. Hatfield D.L. Kohrle J. Schomburg L. Biochem. J. 2005; 386: 221-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar); conversely Sepp1-/- mice with transgenic expression of human selenoprotein P (SEPP1), driven by liver-specific promoter, show increased levels of selenium in the brain, testis, and kidney, supporting the crucial role of hepatic Sepp1 in selenium transport to target organs (7Renko K. Werner M. Renner-Muller I. Cooper T.G. Yeung C.H. Hollenbach B. Scharpf M. Kohrle J. Schomburg L. Schweizer U. Biochem. J. 2007; 409: 741-749Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Intriguingly, selenium levels in the brain and kidney, but not in the testis, of Sepp1-/- mice are nearly restored to levels found in Sepp1+/+ mice by feeding supplemental selenium as sodium selenite (4Hill K.E.

These data raise the question of whether the organs that utilize Sepp1 as a selenium resource employ different mechanisms for its uptake and processing. selenoprotein P apolipoprotein E receptor-2 glutathione peroxidase-3 receptor-associated protein 2-(bis(2-hydroxyethyl)amino)-2-(hydroxymethyl)propane-1,3-diol.

Physiol. 2002; 283: F20-F28Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Sepp1 provides selenium that is utilized for kidney GPx3 synthesis, but it is not known whether Sepp1 is internalized by a receptor-dependent pathway or by specific kidney cell types. The potential for receptor-mediated Sepp1 uptake was suggested by early studies showing saturable binding of Sepp1 to membranes from a variety of organs including the kidney (10Wilson D.S. Tappel A.L. J. Inorg. Biochem. 1993; 51: 707-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We recently demonstrated that apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2/Lrp8) is required for Sepp1 uptake by the testis and that testes of ApoER2-/- males exhibited low selenium levels in comparison with testes of wild type animals (11Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Nagdas S.K. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). However, although deletion of the ApoER2 gene also reduces brain selenium, it does not affect kidney selenium content (12Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Olson G.E. Weeber E.J. Motley A.K. Winfrey V.P. Austin L.M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6207-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These data suggest that the kidney utilizes a distinct Sepp1 trafficking pathway to capture its selenium. The objectives of the present study were to define the cell types and potential receptor(s) that function in kidney Sepp1 uptake. Animals—Care and use of animals conformed to National Institutes of Health guidelines for humane animal care and use in research. The Vanderbilt Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal protocols. Mice were housed in an Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International (AAALAC)-approved facility on a 10-h:14-h light:dark cycle, with food and water provided ad libitum. The diet provided was either Purina rat chow 5001 or pelleted semisynthetic torula yeast diet supplemented with 0.25 or 1.0 mg of selenium, as sodium selenite, per kg of diet (Harlan-Teklad, Madison, WI). Sepp1-/- mice, ApoER2-/- mice, and Sepp1Δ240–361 mice, which express a truncated Sepp1 lacking amino acids 240–361 that includes 9 selenocysteine residuees, were produced and genotyped by PCR as described previously (4Hill K.E.

Mice were sacrificed using CO2, and their kidneys and testes were removed and immediately utilized in the following protocols. Most megalin null mice die at birth, so adult megalin+/- males and females were paired overnight, and the following morning, females were examined for plug formation, designated as day 1 of pregnancy. Mice were sacrificed at day 19 of pregnancy, fetuses were genotyped by PCR, and their kidneys were utilized in protocols described below. Kidney and Testis Membrane Preparation—Kidney and testis membrane preparations were prepared from wild type or Sepp1-/- adult mice using slight modifications of an established protocol (15Moestrup S.K.

Organs were placed in ice-cold 0.3 m sucrose, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing a protease inhibitor mixture (catalog number P8340, Sigma) of 1 mm 4-(2-aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride, 0.8 μm aprotinin, 20 μm leupeptin, 40 μm bestatin, 15 μm pepstatin A, and 14 μm E64) and homogenized with a Brinkmann POLYTRON. The homogenates were centrifuged 10 min at 1,000 × g at 4 °C, and the supernatant fraction was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TL100.3 rotor. The pellets were suspended in TBS (150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing protease inhibitors), homogenized, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g to obtain a membrane-enriched pellet. Membranes were solubilized in TBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 2 h at 4 °C, and particulate material was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. SDS-PAGE, Western Blotting, and Ligand Blotting—Protein levels of the membrane fractions were determined (16Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar), and aliquots were solubilized in sample buffer, with or without 50 mm dithiothreitol as a reducing agent, at 75 °C for 5 min. SDS-PAGE was performed on either 10% Bis-Tris or 3–8% Tris-acetate NuPAGE Novex acrylamide gels (Invitrogen). Polypeptide bands were either visualized by staining with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes for Western blot analysis (17Towbin H. Gordon J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1984; 72: 313-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (795) Google Scholar). Blots were rinsed in PBS (150 mm NaCl, 10 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4) and blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE). Blots were then incubated in primary antibody diluted 1:2,500 to 1:5,000 in Odyssey blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20; parallel control blots substituted equivalent levels of nonimmune IgG from the appropriate species. Primary antibodies included monoclonal rat anti-mouse Sepp1, which reacts with an epitope in its N-terminal region (provided by Dr. T. Naruse of Kaketsuken, The Chemo-Sero-Therapeutic Reseach Institute, Kumamoto, Japan) and polyclonal affinity-purified rabbit anti-megalin (gift from Dr. D. Biemesderfer, Yale University), which reacts with the C terminus region of megalin from several species (18Zou Z. Chung B. Nguyen T. Mentone S. Thomson B. Biemesderfer D. J. Biol.

Blots were then washed at least four times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween (PBST) and then incubated in Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated goat anti-rat IgG or goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen) diluted 1:5,000 in PBST. Blots were then washed extensively in PBST and imaged using an Odyssey infrared imager. Ligand-blotting analyses were performed to identify Sepp1-binding proteins in the kidney membrane preparations (19Moestrup S.K. Birn H. Fischer P.B. Petersen C.M. Verroust P.J. Sim R.B.

Mouse Sepp1 was immunoaffinity-purified from mouse plasma using monoclonal anti-Sepp1 conjugated to Aminolink coupling gel (Pierce Biotechnology), and its purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were blocked in Odyssey blocking buffer and then incubated overnight at 4 °C with, or for controls, without 0.7 μg/ml mouse Sepp1 diluted in Odyssey blocking buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 2 mm CaCl2. Blots were then washed in PBST containing 2 mm CaCl2 and fixed 10 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde in PBST. Blots were then rinsed in PBST containing 0.2% glycine and immunostained with monoclonal rat anti-Sepp1 as described above. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—Mouse kidneys were fixed 1 h at 4 °C with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, rinsed in phosphate buffer and infiltrated overnight at 4 °C in phosphate buffer containing 20% sucrose. Tissue was then immersed in OCT (optimal cutting temperature compound, Fisher Scientific, Atlanta GA), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -70 °C. Cryosections were rinsed with TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm sodium chloride, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.025% sodium azide) and blocked with TBST containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% glycine for 1 h. Sections were then incubated in rat monoclonal anti-Sepp1 and/or rabbit anti-megalin primary antibodies in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Control sections were incubated with equivalent levels of nonimmune rat or rabbit IgG. Sections were then washed 3 × 5 min in TBST and then incubated for 1 h in affinity-purified secondary antibodies diluted in blocking solution. These included Cy3- or Cy5-conjugated mouse anti-rat IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) and Alexa Fluor 488-goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen). Hoechst 33258 and Alexa Fluor 488-phalloidin, to stain f-actin, (Invitrogen) were added to the secondary antibody solution. For double antibody staining, additional controls validated that the secondary antibodies only bound to the appropriate primary antibody. Slides were washed 3 × 5 min with TBST and mounted in 50% glycerol in TBS. Specimens were examined by phase contrast and fluorescence microscopy, and images of experimental and control specimens were obtained using identical photographic exposures. Each immunostaining experiment was repeated using at least three animals, and the images shown are representative of all replicates. Tissue ligand binding assays were performed to localize Sepp1-binding sites in kidneys from Sepp1-/- mice (22Nykjaer A. Dragun D. Walther D. Vorum H. Jacobsen C. Herz J. Melsen F. Christensen E.I.

Cryosections, 4–5 μm in thickness, were blocked for 30 min in blocking solution of Hepes-buffered saline (HBS = 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mm sodium chloride, 2 mm calcium chloride, 0.25% sodium azide) containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 0.1% glycine. Slides were then incubated 1 h with 1–5 μg/ml affinity-purified mouse Sepp1 in blocking solution. Two controls were performed. In the first, sections were preincubated for 1 h in blocking solution containing 10 μg/ml GST·RAP (provided by Dr. E. Weeber, Vanderbilt University), an inhibitor of lipoprotein receptor-ligand interactions (21Bajari T.M. Strasser V. Nimpf J. Schneider W.J. Methods (Amst.). 2005; 36: 109-116Google Scholar, 23Herz J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 21162-21166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prior to incubation with Sepp1; the second control omitted the Sepp1 from the incubation solution. Slides were washed 3× with HBS and then fixed with 4% formaldehyde in HBS for 20 min. Slides were then rinsed with TBST and immunostained with rat anti-mouse Sepp1 and Alexa Flour 488-phalloidin as detailed above. Distribution of Sepp1 in the Kidney—Cryosections of adult wild type mouse kidneys immunostained with anti-Sepp1 revealed a discrete Sepp1 distribution pattern within the cortex, but no staining was detected in the medulla. Sepp1 displayed a punctate distribution at the luminal surface and within the apical cytoplasm of epithelial cells of the proximal tubule and of the urinary pole of the glomerulus (Fig. 1A). At the cell surface, Sepp1 localized just below the epithelial brush border, consistent with its endocytic uptake. Sepp1 staining was always detected in the proximal tubule as it emerged from the glomerulus, but not in its distal regions, suggesting an efficient mechanism for Sepp1 uptake from the glomerular filtrate. Sepp1 was not detected in any other kidney tubules. Specificity of the anti-Sepp1 staining was validated using two controls. First, wild type kidney sections immunostained by substituting nonimmune IgG for anti-Sepp1 displayed no detectable specific staining (not shown). Second, cryosections of kidneys from Sepp1-/- mice immunostained with anti-Sepp1 displayed no detectable fluorescence (Fig. 1, B and C); this demonstrates that Sepp1, not other proteins, accounts for the positive staining. These data suggested that Sepp1 passes from blood plasma into the glomerular filtrate, where it is removed by endocytic activity of the proximal tubule epithelium. Truncated Sepp1 Binds to the Proximal Tubule Epithelium—Kidneys of mice expressing only truncated Sepp1Δ240–361, which lacks the C terminus amino acids 240–361 containing the selenocysteine-rich domain (13Hill K.E. Zhou J. Austin L.M. Motley A.K. Ham A.J. Olson G.E. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10972-10980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), were immunostained with anti-Sepp1. Like full-length Sepp1, Sepp1Δ240–361 was detected at the apical surface of the proximal tubule epithelium (Fig. 1, D and E). This demonstrates that the C terminus domain is not required for Sepp1 binding and/or uptake by the proximal tubule epithelium. Sepp1 Uptake by the Proximal Tubules Does Not Utilize ApoER2—We recently demonstrated that Sepp1 uptake by the testis is mediated by ApoER2 and that testes of ApoER2-/- adult males displayed sharply reduced selenium levels, similar to those of Sepp1-/- males (11Olson G.E. Winfrey V.P. Nagdas S.K. Hill K.E. Burk R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 12290-12297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). To determine whether the ApoER2 pathway functions in the kidney Sepp1 uptake, we examined Sepp1 distribution in kidneys of ApoER2 null animals. The Sepp1 distribution pattern in kidneys of ApoER2 null animals appeared identical to those of wild types, with Sepp1 binding to the apical surface of proximal tubule epithelial cells (Fig. 1, F and G). This supports the finding that kidney total selenium levels between wild type and ApoER2 null animals are similar (12Burk R.F. Hill K.E. Olson G.E. Weeber E.J. Motley A.K. Winfrey V.P. Austin L.M. J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 6207-6211Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). These data demonstrate that ApoER2 is not required for kidney Sepp1 uptake and indicates that the kidney and testis utilize distinct Sepp1 uptake mechanisms. Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells of Sepp1-/- Mice Possess Sepp1-binding Sites—The above data demonstrate Sepp1 uptake by the proximal tubule epithelium but do not resolve whether it is a receptor-mediated process. To test whether a specific receptor(s) mediates proximal tubule Sepp1 uptake, cryosections of kidneys from Sepp1-/- mice were tested for Sepp1 binding activity. Sepp1 was immunoaffinity-purified from mouse plasma, and according to SDS-PAGE, it contained a major Coomassie Blue-stained band of Mr ≈ 50,000 (Fig. 2, lane 1). Western blotting confirmed that anti-Sepp1 recognizes the Mr ≈ 50,000 polypeptide (Fig. 2, lane 2), whereas control nonimmune primary IgG displays no detectable Sepp1 binding (Fig. 2, lane 3). Control sections verified the absence of endogenous Sepp1 in proximal tubules (Fig. 3, A–C). However, cryosections incubated with purified Sepp1 revealed Sepp1-binding sites as punctate structures located below the brush border of proximal tubule epithelial cells (Fig. 3, D–F) and indicated that these cells possess receptors for Sepp1. Although ApoER2 does not function in proximal tubule Sepp1 uptake (Fig. 1, F and G), it is possible that other lipoprotein receptors play that role. The receptor-associated protein RAP inhibits the ligand binding activity of all members of the lipoprotein receptor family (23Herz J. Goldstein J.L. Strickland D.K. Ho Y.K. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 21232-21238Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Kounnas M.Z. Argraves W.S. Strickland D.K. J. Biol.

Preincubation of kidney sections with RAP, prior to incubation with Sepp1, blocked Sepp1 binding (Fig. 3, G–I). These data suggest that a lipoprotein receptor, other than ApoER2, participates in Sepp1 uptake by the proximal tubule epithelium.FIGURE 3Tissue overlay experiments identify Sepp1-binding sites in kidney cryosections of Sepp1-/- mice.

Coomassie Blue staining revealed a high molecular weight band of Mr > 460,000 in kidney (Fig. 4, lane 1) but not testis (Fig. 4, lane 2) membrane lysates. To identify Sepp1-binding proteins, Western blot ligand-blotting assays were performed using kidney and testis membranes prepared from Sepp1-/- mice (Fig. 4, lanes 3–8). Blots incubated with purified Sepp1 and then immunostained with anti-Sepp1 demonstrated that Sepp1 bound the high molecular weight polypeptide that was present in kidney, but not testis, membranes (Fig. 4, lanes 3 and 4). Two controls were performed to verify Sepp1 binding specificity. First, blots not incubated with Sepp1 showed no positively immunostained bands (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6) and, second, blots immunostained using nonimmune primary antibody showed no positive staining (Fig. 4, lanes 7 and 8). The kidney Sepp1-binding protein (Fig. 4, lane 3) displayed an apparent molecular weight similar to that of megalin, a lipoprotein receptor family member that localizes to the apical membrane of proximal convoluted tubule epithelial cells (26Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R. Stamenkovic I. Strickland D.K. Brown D. Andres G. McCluskey R.T. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 531-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar, 27Kerjaschki D. Farquhar M.G. J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 66: 349-364PubMed Google Scholar). Western blots of membranes fractionated by nonreducing SDS-PAGE and immunostained with anti-megalin revealed a prominent megalin band in kidney membranes (Fig. 4, lane 9) that co-migrates with the Sepp1-binding protein identified by ligand blotting (lane 3), but no megalin was detected in testis membranes (Fig. 4, lane 10). Control blots immunostained with a nonimmune primary antibody displayed no immunoreactive bands (Fig. 4, lanes 11 and 12). These data show that megalin, a multispecific receptor in the apical plasma membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells, binds Sepp1. Sepp1 Co-localizes with Megalin in Proximal Tubule Epithelial Cells—Cryosections of adult wild type mouse kidney double immunostained for Sepp1 and megalin reveal their overlapping distribution in a subset of proximal tubules (Fig. 5, A and B). However, megalin, unlike Sepp1, which is only detected in tubule profiles near the glomerulus, is present throughout the length of the proximal tubules (Fig. 5, A and B). These results demonstrate that Sepp1 and megalin co-localize at sites of endocytic activity in the proximal tubule epithelium. Megalin Is Required for Sepp1 Uptake by the Proximal Tubule—The majority of megalin-/- mice die at birth (14Willnow T.E. Hilpert J. Armstrong S.A. Rohlmann A. Hammer R.E. Burns D.K. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8460-8464Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar). Therefore megalin+/- mice were mated, and pregnant females were sacrificed at day 19 of pregnancy. Double immunostaining of wild type and megalin+/- fetal kidneys revealed megalin at the apical surface of the proximal tubule epithelium and Sepp1 within the epithelium of a subset of the proximal tubules (Fig. 5, C and D). When compared with adult kidneys, those of day 19 wild type or megalin+/- fetuses show a more prominent accumulation of Sepp1 within vesicle-like structures in the epithelial cell cytoplasm in addition to Sepp1 at the cell surface. In contrast, neither megalin nor Sepp1 was detected in proximal tubules of megalin-/- fetuses (Fig. 5, E and F). These data indicate that Sepp1 uptake is megalin-dependent. This study demonstrates that the lipoprotein receptor megalin mediates Sepp1 uptake by the kidney proximal tubule, a tissue requiring a high selenium supply to support synthesis of GPx3 (3Whitin J.C. Bhamre S. Tham D.M. Cohen H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 283: F20-F28Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Megalin localizes to the apical plasma membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells, where it facilitates endocytic uptake of several proteins from the glomerular filtrate (26Zheng G. Bachinsky D.R.

This study shows that after Sepp1 passes into the glomerular filtrate, it is endocytosed by the initial portion of the proximal tubule. Kidneys of both Sepp1Δ240–361 mice, which only express truncated Sepp1 lacking the C-terminal selenocysteine-rich domain, and of wild type mice display the same pattern of Sepp1 immunostaining in the proximal tubule. These data indicate that the Sepp1 selenocysteine-rich C terminus domain is not required for megalin-dependent uptake. This finding also raises the question of whether all Sepp1 isoforms identified in blood plasma (32Ma S. Hill K.E. Caprioli R.M. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

Full-length mouse Sepp1 displays an apparent Mr of ∼50,000 by SDS-PAGE, which is near the size limit of the filtration barrier. In rats, full-length Sepp1 and three C terminus-truncated isoforms with 1, 2, or 6 selenocysteine residues, respectively, are present in blood plasma (32Ma S. Hill K.E. Caprioli R.M. Burk R.F. J.

It is intriguing that when fed a selenium-adequate diet, both Sepp1Δ240–361 and wild type mice display comparable kidney selenium levels (13Hill K.E. Zhou J. Austin L.M. Motley A.K. Ham A.J.

It is possible that only the truncated isoform(s) of Sepp1 can pass into the glomerular filtrate and that they provide sufficient selenium to support proximal tubule selenoprotein synthesis. Receptor-mediated Sepp1 uptake by the proximal tubule epithelium represents a mechanism to provide the selenium required for Gpx3 synthesis (3Whitin J.C. Bhamre S. Tham D.M. Cohen H.J. Am. J.

Megalin is a large ∼600-kDa glycoprotein whose extracellular domain, which possesses four large clusters of disulfide bond-stabilized ligand-binding repeats (31Christensen E.I. Birn H. Nat. Rev. Mol.

In contrast, ApoER2, the testis Sepp1 receptor, did not retain Sepp1 binding activity by ligand blotting; the extracellular domain of ApoER2 possesses only a single cluster of ligand-binding repeats (36Kim D.H.

These data raised the possibility that ligand blotting also failed to identify other Sepp1-binding proteins. However, the use of megalin null mice directly demonstrates that megalin is required for proximal tubule Sepp1 uptake. Megalin-/- mice display perinatal mortality; therefore day 19 fetuses were utilized since both glomerular filtration (38Chapon C. Franconi F. Roux J. Jeune Le J.J. Lemaire L. Anat. Embryol. (Berl.). 2005; 209: 263-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) and liver expression of Sepp1 (39Kasik J.W. Rice E.J. Placenta. 2002; 16: 67-74Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar) were established by this embryonic stage. Sepp1 was detected in both wild type and megalin+/- kidneys of day 19 fetuses, and its absence from the proximal tubule epithelium of the megalin-/- mice reflects the failure of its uptake from the glomerular filtrate. The accumulation of Sepp1 in endosomes and/or lysosomes of proximal tubules of day 19 fetuses differed from adult kidneys. This could reflect an immature lysosomal system in the fetal kidney since lysosome biogenesis in the proximal tubule epithelium is dependent upon endocytic uptake of hydrolases from the glomerular filtrate (40Nielsen R. Courtoy P.J. Jacobsen C. Dom G. Lima W.R. Jadot M. Willnow T.E. Devuyst O. Christensen E.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A critical question has been to elucidate mechanisms by which selenium is selectively accumulated by key target organs. Sepp1 is utilized for selenium delivery to the brain, testis, and kidney (4Hill K.E. Zhou J. McMahan W.J. Motley A.K. Atkins J.F. Gesteland R.F. Burk R.F. J. Biol.

The testis, which requires ApoER2 but does not express megalin, and the kidney, which utilizes megalin but not ApoER2, employ distinct lipoprotein receptors for Sepp1 uptake. It will be of interest to define the Sepp1 trafficking pathway in the brain since it expresses ApoER2 and megalin as well as other lipoprotein receptors (36Kim D.H. Iijima H. Goto K. Sakai J.

An important unresolved question is whether the kidney, testis, and brain utilize distinct Sepp1 isoforms to supply their selenium requirements or whether they compete for the same Sepp1 isoform. Future studies will examine the binding of the Sepp1 isoforms to both megalin and ApoER2 to assess whether these lipoprotein receptors recognize distinct domains of Sepp1 and define the mechanisms generating the different Sepp1 isoforms present in blood plasma.

https://openalex.org/W2134480847,"Unprecedented spread between birds and mammals of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) of the H5N1 subtype has resulted in hundreds of human infections with a high fatality rate. This has highlighted the urgent need for the development of H5N1 vaccines that can be produced rapidly and in sufficient quantities. Potential pandemic inactivated vaccines will ideally induce substantial intra-subtypic cross-protection in humans to warrant the option of use, either prior to or just after the start of a pandemic outbreak. In the present study, we evaluated a split H5N1 A/H5N1/Vietnam/1194/04, clade 1 candidate vaccine, adjuvanted with a proprietary oil-in- water emulsion based Adjuvant System proven to be well-tolerated and highly immunogenic in the human (Leroux-Roels et al. (2007) The Lancet 370:580-589), for its ability to induce intra-subtypic cross-protection against clade 2 H5N1/A/Indonesia/5/05 challenge in ferrets.All ferrets in control groups receiving non-adjuvanted vaccine or adjuvant alone failed to develop specific or cross-reactive neutralizing antibodies and all died or had to be euthanized within four days of virus challenge. Two doses of adjuvanted split H5N1 vaccine containing >or=1.7 microg HA induced neutralizing antibodies in the majority of ferrets to both clade 1 (17/23 (74%) responders) and clade 2 viruses (14/23 (61%) responders), and 96% (22/23) of vaccinees survived the lethal challenge. Furthermore lung virus loads and viral shedding in the upper respiratory tract were reduced in vaccinated animals relative to controls suggesting that vaccination might also confer a reduced risk of viral transmission.These protection data in a stringent challenge model in association with an excellent clinical profile highlight the potential of this adjuvanted H5N1 candidate vaccine as an effective tool in pandemic preparedness."
https://openalex.org/W2017945589,"Background We previously reported the in vitro spontaneous transformation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) generating a population with tumorigenic potential, that we termed transformed mesenchymal cells (TMC). Methodology/Principal Findings Here we have characterized the molecular changes associated with TMC generation. Using microarrays techniques we identified a set of altered pathways and a greater number of downregulated than upregulated genes during MSC transformation, in part due to the expression of many untranslated RNAs in MSC. Microarray results were validated by qRT-PCR and protein detection. Conclusions/Significance In our model, the transformation process takes place through two sequential steps; first MSC bypass senescence by upregulating c-myc and repressing p16 levels. The cells then bypass cell crisis with acquisition of telomerase activity, Ink4a/Arf locus deletion and Rb hyperphosphorylation. Other transformation-associated changes include modulation of mitochondrial metabolism, DNA damage-repair proteins and cell cycle regulators. In this work we have characterized the molecular mechanisms implicated in TMC generation and we propose a two-stage model by which a human MSC becomes a tumor cell."
https://openalex.org/W1984762468,"Background The Hox genes are involved in patterning the anterior-posterior axis. In addition to the protein coding Hox genes, the miR-10, miR-196 and miR-615 families of microRNA genes are conserved within the vertebrate Hox clusters. The members of the miR-10 family are located at positions associated with Hox-4 paralogues. No function is yet known for this microRNA family but the genomic positions of its members suggest a role in anterior-posterior patterning. Methodology/Principal Findings Using sensor constructs, overexpression and morpholino knockdown, we show in Zebrafish that miR-10 targets HoxB1a and HoxB3a and synergizes with HoxB4 in the repression of these target genes. Overexpression of miR-10 also induces specific phenotypes related to the loss of function of these targets. HoxB1a and HoxB3a have a dominant hindbrain expression domain anterior to that of miR-10 but overlap in a weaker expression domain in the spinal cord. In this latter domain, miR-10 knockdown results in upregulation of the target genes. In the case of a HoxB3a splice variant that includes miR-10c within its primary transcript, we show that the microRNA acts in an autoregulatory fashion. Conclusions/Significance We find that miR-10 acts to repress HoxB1a and HoxB3a within the spinal cord and show that this repression works cooperatively with HoxB4. As with the previously described interactions between miR-196 and HoxA7 and Hox-8 paralogues, the target genes are located in close proximity to the microRNA. We present a model in which we postulate a link between the clustering of Hox genes and post-transcriptional gene regulation. We speculate that the high density of transcription units and enhancers within the Hox clusters places constraints on the precision of the transcriptional control that can be achieved within these clusters and requires the involvement of post-transcriptional gene silencing to define functional domains of genes appropriately."

In the present study, we investigated stimulation of aldosterone production by CTRP1, since it was observed that CTRP1 was specifically expressed in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex, where aldosterone is produced. Increased aldosterone production by CTRP1 in cells of the human adrenal cortical cell line H295R was dose-dependent. Expression levels of aldosterone synthase CYP11B2 were examined to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which CTRP1 enhances the production of aldosterone. The expression of CYP11B2 was greatly increased by treatment with CTRP1, as was the expression of the transcription factors NGFIB and NURR1, which play critical roles in stimulation of CYP11B2 gene expression. It was also revealed that angiotensin II-induced aldosterone production is, at least in part, mediated by the stimulation of CTRP1 secretion, not by the increase of CTRP1 mRNA transcription. In addition, the levels of CTRP1 were significantly up-regulated in hypertensive patients' serum. As CTRP1 was highly expressed in obese subjects as well as up-regulated in hypertensive patients, CTRP1 may be a newly identified molecular link between obesity and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W2002850755,"The X-ray crystal structure of peroxiredoxin bound to sulphiredoxin is solved. In this structure of the co-complex, the carboxy terminus of peroxiredoxin is completely unfolded, and it is 'packed' onto the backside of sulphiredoxin, away from the sulphiredoxin active site. Binding studies and activity analyses of site-directed mutants at this interface show that the interaction is required for repair to occur. Typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs) have an important role in regulating hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell signalling1. In this process, Prxs can become inactivated through the hyperoxidation of an active site Cys residue to Cys sulphinic acid. The unique repair of this moiety by sulphiredoxin (Srx) restores peroxidase activity and terminates the signal2. The hyperoxidized form of Prx exists as a stable decameric structure with each active site buried. Therefore, it is unclear how Srx can access the sulphinic acid moiety. Here we present the 2.6 Å crystal structure of the human Srx–PrxI complex. This complex reveals the complete unfolding of the carboxy terminus of Prx, and its unexpected packing onto the backside of Srx away from the Srx active site. Binding studies and activity analyses of site-directed mutants at this interface show that the interaction is required for repair to occur. Moreover, rearrangements in the Prx active site lead to a juxtaposition of the Prx Gly-Gly-Leu-Gly and Srx ATP-binding motifs, providing a structural basis for the first step of the catalytic mechanism. The results also suggest that the observed interactions may represent a common mode for other proteins to bind to Prxs."

To determine mechanisms that underlie scarred versus scar-free healing, patient-matched dermal and oral mucosal fibroblasts were used as models of scarring and non-scarring fibroblast phenotypes. Specifically, differences in HA generation between these distinct fibroblast populations have been examined and related to differences in transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)-dependent proliferative responses and Smad signaling. There was a differential growth response to TGF-β1, with it inducing proliferation in dermal fibroblasts but an anti-proliferative response in oral fibroblasts. Both responses were Smad3-dependent. Furthermore, the two fibroblast populations also demonstrated differences in their HA regulation, with dermal fibroblasts generating increased levels of HA, compared with oral fibroblasts. Inhibition of HA synthesis in dermal fibroblasts was shown to abrogate the TGF-β1-mediated induction of proliferation. Inhibition of HA synthesis also led to an attenuation of Smad3 signaling in dermal fibroblasts. Microarray analysis demonstrated no difference in the genes involved in TGF-β1 signaling between dermal and oral fibroblasts, whereas there was a distinct difference in the pattern of genes involved in HA regulation.

Scarring is an important response to tissue injury that facilitates repair through replacement of damaged tissue with fibrous tissue. In the context of dermal injury, this restores tissue strength and aids in the repair of structural defects. However, in some injuries, deposition of scar tissue may have adverse consequences. Following injury to internal organs, repair by scarring can initiate a cascade of events that continue unabated leading to progressive accumulation of fibrous tissue and eventually resulting in loss of organ function (1Eckes B.

In an attempt to delineate the mechanisms that differentiate between scarring versus scar-free repair, we have used patient-matched oral mucosal and dermal fibroblasts, as models of non-scarring and scarring fibroblast phenotypes, respectively, to attempt to identify the mechanisms that could be exploited to prevent scarring following tissue injury.We have previously demonstrated clear differences between oral mucosal and dermal fibroblasts that can account for the differential wound healing profiles of the two tissues. Fibroblasts derived from the oral mucosa have been shown to demonstrate increased migration, experimental wound repopulation, and extracellular matrix re-organization as compared with fibroblasts derived from the dermis of the same individual (24Stephens P. Davies K.J. al-Khateeb T. Shepherd J.P. Thomas D.W. J. Dent. Res. 1996; 75: 1358-1364Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 25Stephens P. Davies K.J. Occleston N. Pleass R.D. Kon C. Daniels J. Khaw P.T. Thomas D.W. Br. J. Dermatol. 2001; 144: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). We have also shown recently that these same fibroblast populations demonstrate intrinsic differences in their ability to differentiate in response to the pro-fibrotic cytokine TGF-β1. Although dermal fibroblasts readily differentiate in response to TGF-β1, oral mucosal fibroblasts are resistant to TGF-β1-driven myofibroblastic differentiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the matrix polysaccharide hyaluronan (HA) plays a pivotal role in regulating TGF-β1-driven cellular differentiation in that it facilitates fibroblast-myofibroblast transition (21Meran S. Steadman R. Phillips A.O. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2006; 17: 126Google Scholar, 22Meran S. Stephens P. Thomas D.W. Phillips A.O. Steadman R. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 25687-25697Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The purpose of this study was to expand these observations by comparing differences in other TGF-β1-mediated cell responses in scarring and non-scarring fibroblast phenotypes. Furthermore, this work aimed to test the general applicability of the hypothesis that intrinsic differences in HA generation in the two fibroblast populations is the key to determining cellular responses and influencing wound healing outcomes.The data presented here show that fibroblasts derived from the dermis and patient-matched oral mucosa demonstrate a differential proliferative response to TGF-β1. Although TGF-β1 stimulates proliferation in dermal fibroblasts, it inhibits DNA synthesis and induces an anti-proliferative response in oral mucosal fibroblasts. The two fibroblast populations also demonstrate differences in their HA regulation, with dermal fibroblasts generating increased levels of HA as compared with oral fibroblasts. Furthermore, the data demonstrate that TGF-β1 regulates proliferation through Smad3 signaling in both fibroblast populations. However, the proliferative response to TGF-β1 in dermal fibroblasts appears to be directly linked to the increased levels of HA generated by these cells.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—All reagents were from Sigma unless otherwise stated. Reverse transcription and QPCR reagents and primers were purchased from Invitrogen and Applied Biosystems (Cheshire, UK). Radioisotopes were purchased from Amersham Biosciences.Cell Culture—Four donor-matched samples of dermal and oral mucosal fibroblasts were obtained by biopsy from consenting adults undergoing routine minor surgery, and ethical approval for the biopsies was obtained from the South East Wales Research Ethics Committee. The cells were isolated as described previously (25Stephens P. Davies K.J. Occleston N. Pleass R.D. Kon C. Daniels J. Khaw P.T. Thomas D.W. Br. J. Dermatol. 2001; 144: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and F-12 medium containing 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Biologic Industries Ltd., Cumbernauld, UK). The cells were maintained at 37 °C in a humidified incubator in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, and fresh growth medium was added to the cells every 3-4 days until confluent. The cells were incubated in serum-free medium for 48 h before use in experiments, and all experiments were done under serum-free conditions unless otherwise stated. All experiments were undertaken using cells at passage 6-10 and performed on confluent cultures except for those examining proliferation. These experiments used subconfluent cells to allow for cell growth.Analysis of Cell Proliferation[3H]Thymidine Proliferation Assay—Fibroblast proliferation was first assessed by the incorporation of d-[3H]thymidine into DNA. Cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and assessed at subconfluence. Metabolic labeling was performed by incubation with 1 μCi/ml d-[3H]thymidine for 24 h. The medium was then discarded, and the cells were washed repeatedly with PBS containing 1 mm thymidine prior to fixing with 500 μl of 5% trichloroacetic acid containing 1 mm thymidine at 4 °C for 1 h. The cell layer was extracted by incubation with 1 ml of 0.1 m NaOH at 20 °C for 24 h and neutralized with 0.1 m HCl. The radioactivity was determined by β-counting on a Packard Tri-Carb 1900 liquid scintillation analyzer, and the results are represented as disintegrations/min.alamarBlue™ Proliferation Assay—Analysis of cell growth was also assessed by the commercial alamarBlue™ assay (BIO-SOURCE), which is designed to measure cell viability and number. The assay utilizes an oxidation-reduction indicator that fluoresces in response to chemical reduction of growth medium resulting from cell growth and metabolism and demonstrates a linear relationship between the magnitude of fluorescence and cell number and viability. For this assay cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and assessed at subconfluence following a 48-h period of growth arrest. The cells were then stimulated with 10 ng/ml TGF-β1. Following 24 h, 10% alamarBlue was added to the medium for 1 h at 37 °C. 100-μl aliquots of the conditioned medium were removed and added to a clear 96-well plate. Subsequently fluorescence was measured in a Fluostar optima fluorescence meter (BMG Lab Technologies) with excitation wavelength at 540 nm and emission wavelength at 590 nm; and the results are expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units.Analysis of Cell ApoptosisFluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled annexin V and propidium iodide were used to confirm the presence of apoptotic cells in in vitro cultures. Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes, washed in PBS, and then harvested using trypsin/EDTA. The cells were then resuspended in 100 μl of the reaction mix made up of 90 μl of distilled water, 10 μl of 10× binding buffer (100 mm HEPES, 1.5 m NaCl, 50 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, and 18 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4), 5 μl of FITC-annexin-V (Pharmingen), and 5 μl of propidium iodide (PI) (Pharmingen). The cells were incubated in the dark for 20 min at room temperature, centrifuged, washed in PBS, and resuspended in 1× binding buffer. The samples were analyzed immediately by flow cytometry (FACSCalibur). The viable cells were annexin-V/PI-negative, and cells in early apoptosis were annexin-V-positive and PI-negative, and cells in late apoptosis/necrosis were annexin-V/PI-positive.Cell Cycle AnalysisThe distribution of cells within the cell cycle was determined by propidium iodide incorporation into DNA. Cells were grown in 35-mm dishes and assessed at subconfluence. Briefly, cells were harvested by treatment with trypsin/EDTA, pelleted by centrifugation, and then washed in PBS. The cells were then resuspended in cold 70% ethanol and maintained at 4 °C for 16 h. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged, washed in PBS, and then resuspended in 300 μl of binding buffer and 10 μl of 50 μg/ml PI solution along with 5 μl/sample RNase (10 mg/ml stock). The samples were then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min prior to FACS analysis. The percentage of cells in the different phases of the cell cycle were quantified using Cylchred version 1.0.2 software (Terry Hoy, University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, UK).Immunoblotting/Western AnalysisWestern blot analysis was used to assess expression of phosphorylated Smad2 and Smad3. Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and rinsed with cold PBS. Cells were then lysed using 1% protease inhibitor mixture, 1% phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1% sodium orthovanadate in RIPA lysis buffer (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The samples were scraped, collected, and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected, and protein concentrations were determined by Bradford assay, and the samples were stored at -70 °C until use. Equal amounts of protein were mixed with equal volumes of reducing SDS sample buffer and denatured for 5 min at 95 °C before loading onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Electrophoresis was carried out under reducing conditions at 150 V for 1 h, and the separated proteins were then transferred at 150 V over 90 min to a nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences). The membrane was blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 5% nonfat powdered milk for 1 h and then incubated with the primary antibody (anti-phosphorylated Smad3 or anti-phosphorylated Smad2, 1:500 dilution in TBS, host:rabbit) at 4 °C overnight (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers, MA). Expression of GAPDH was analyzed as a control to ensure equal loading (anti-GAPDH, 1:1000 dilution in TBS, host:rabbit). The blots were subsequently washed with TBS containing 1% Tween and then incubated with the secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature (anti-rabbit IgG:horseradish peroxidase, 1:12,000 dilution in TBS). Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The intensity of the bands was quantified by densitometry and corrected for the expression of GAPDH.Analysis of 3H-Radiolabeled HACells were grown to full confluence in T75 flasks. Metabolic labeling was performed by incubation with 20 μCi/ml d-[3H]glucosamine hydrochloride for the indicated times. The culture medium was then removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. The wash and medium were combined to form the conditioned medium extract (CM). The CM was then treated with an equal volume of 200 μg/ml Pronase in 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.05% sodium azide for 24 h. To remove any CD44-associated HA, the cells were treated with 10 μg/ml trypsin in PBS for 10 min at room temperature; this was designated the trypsin extract (TE). The TE was then treated with an equal volume of 200 μg/ml Pronase for 24 h. The cells remaining in the culture flask were incubated directly with 100 μg/ml Pronase for 24 h. The supernatant was decanted and designated the cell extract (CE).Each extract was passed over DEAE-Sephacel ion exchange columns equilibrated with 8 m urea in 20 mm BisTris buffer, pH 6, containing 0.2% Triton X-100. This removed any low molecular weight peptides and unincorporated radiolabel. HA was eluted in 8 m urea buffer containing 0.3 m NaCl. Each sample was split into two, and the HA was precipitated with 3 volumes of 1% potassium acetate in 95% ethanol in the presence of 50 μg/ml of each HA, heparin, and chondroitin sulfate as co-precipitants. The first half of each sample was resuspended in 500 μl of 4 m guanidine buffer and analyzed on a Sephacryl S-500 column equilibrated with 4 m guanidine buffer. To confirm that the chromatography profile generated was the result of radiolabeled HA, the second half of each sample was digested at 37 °C overnight with 1 unit of Streptomyces hyalurolyticus hyaluronidase (ICN Pharmaceuticals Ltd.) in 200 μl of 20 mm sodium acetate, pH 6.0, containing 0.05% sodium azide and 0.15 m sodium chloride. The sample was then mixed with an equal volume of 4 m guanidine buffer and analyzed on the same Sephacryl S-500 column equilibrated with 4 m guanidine buffer. To produce the chromatography profile the 3H activity for each half of the sample was normalized and corrected for dilution, and then the hyaluronidase-resistant counts were subtracted. The chromatography profiles depict only the hyaluronidase-sensitive activity in each fraction plotted against fraction number. The column was calibrated with [3H]glucosamine hydrochloride, Mr 215; [35S]chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycans, Mr 25 × 103; decorin, Mr 10 × 104; and [35S]versican, Mr 1.3 × 106. The radioactivity was determined by β-counting on a Packard Tri-Carb 1900 liquid scintillation analyzer, and the results are represented as disintegrations/min.Determination of HA ConcentrationCells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes, and the HA concentration in the cell culture supernatant was determined using a commercially available enzyme-linked HA-binding protein assay (HA “Chugai” quantitative test kit; Congenix, Petersborough, UK). The assay used microwells coated with a highly specific HA-binding protein (HABP) from bovine cartilage to capture HA and an enzyme-conjugated version of HABP to detect and measure HA in the samples. Briefly, diluted samples and HA reference solutions were incubated in HABP-coated microwells allowing binding of the HA in the samples to the immobilized HABP. The wells were then washed, and HABP conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was added to the wells forming complexes with bound HA. Following a second washing step, a chromogenic substrate (TMB:H2O2) was added to develop a colored reaction. Stopping solution was added to the wells, and the intensity of the resulting color was measured in optical density units using a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. HA concentrations were calculated by comparing the absorbance of the sample against a reference curve prepared from the reagent blank and five HA reference solutions (50, 100, 200, 500, and 800 ng/ml) included in the kit. The assay is sensitive to 10 ng/ml, with no cross-reactivity with other glycosaminoglycan compounds.Determination of TGF-β1 ProductionTGF-β1 concentration in the culture supernatant was determined by specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (R & D Systems Europe Ltd.). This assay has less than 1% cross-reactivity with TGF-β2 and TGF-β3. Briefly, high protein-binding 96-well plates were coated with TGF-β capture antibody (2 μg/ml in PBS) overnight at room temperature. Wells were washed, and the plate was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with block buffer (5% Tween 20, 5% sucrose in PBS) and then washed before addition of TGF-β standards and cell culture supernatant samples. Cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and growth-arrested in serum-free medium for 48 h. Subsequently the medium was changed to medium containing 0.5 mm 4MU or serum-free medium alone, and the incubations were continued for a further 24 h. 20 μl of 1 m HCl was then added to 100-μl samples of cell supernatants to acid-activate latent TGF-β1; and the samples were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. The acid-activated samples were neutralized with 20 μl of 1.2 m NaOH, 0.5 m HEPES. In parallel experiments, an equal number of 100-μl cell supernatant samples were analyzed without acid activation to quantify active rather than total TGF-β1 concentrations. Samples and standards were then added to the plate and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plate was washed, and detection antibody was added at 300 ng/ml in reagent diluent (1.4% delipidized bovine serum albumin/Tween 20 in PBS). The plate was then incubated for a further 2 h at room temperature and washed again. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (0.5% in reagent diluent) was added to each well, the plate was incubated in the dark for 20 min and then washed. Substrate solution (TMB/H2O2) was added to the wells, and the plate was incubated in the dark for 20 min before the addition of stop solution. The intensity of the resulting color was measured in optical density units using a spectrophotometer at 450 nm. TGF-β1 concentration was calculated by comparing the absorbance of the sample against a reference curve prepared from the reagent blank and the standards.Cytotoxicity AssayCytotoxicity of 4MU was assessed by the alamarBlue™ assay. Subconfluent dermal fibroblasts were incubated for 24 h in serum-free medium alone or serum-free medium containing 1, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, or 0.2 mm 4MU. Following 24 h 10% alamarBlue was added to the medium for 1 h at 37 °C. 100-μl aliquots of the conditioned medium were removed and added to a clear 96-well plate. Subsequently fluorescence was measured in a Fluostar optima fluorescence meter (BMG Lab Technologies) with excitation wavelength at 540 nm and emission wavelength at 590 nm; and the results are expressed as arbitrary fluorescence units.Smad3 siRNA TransfectionTransient transfection of dermal and oral fibroblasts with specific siRNA nucleotides targeting Smad3 expression was performed using siPORT amine transfection reagent (Ambion Ltd., Huntington, UK) in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, 8 μl of transfection agent was diluted in 100 μl of Opti-MEM reduced growth medium (Invitrogen) and left to incubate at room temperature for 10 min. Meanwhile, the specific Smad3 siRNA oligonucleotides were diluted in Opti-MEM reduced growth medium to give a final concentration of 20 μm in a total volume of 100 μl. The transfection agent mix and siRNA mix were then combined and incubated at room temperature for a further 10 min. The newly formed transfection complexes (200 μl) were dispensed into empty wells of 6-well culture plates. To each well, 2.3 × 105 cells were then added so that the total volume in each well was 2500 μl. As a control, cells were transfected with negative control siRNA (a scrambled sequence that bears no homology to the human genome). The cells were then incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 24 h in medium supplemented with 10% FBS followed by a 24-h incubation in serum-free medium prior to experimentation.Reverse Transcription (RT) and Quantitative PCR (QPCR)RT-QPCR was used to assess Smad3, HAS2, versican, and aggrecan mRNA expression in oral mucosal and dermal fibroblasts. The cells were grown to confluence in 35-mm dishes and washed with PBS prior to lysis with tri-reagent and RNA purification according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT was performed using the random hexamer method. 1 μg of RNA was added to 1 μl of 100 μm random hexamers, 2 μl of 10× PCR buffer, and 2 μl of 0.1 m dithiothreitol. The solution was heated to 95 °C for 5 min followed by 4 °C for 2 min. 1 μl of (40 units/μl) ribonuclease inhibitor RNasin (Promega) and 1 μl of (200 units/μl) Superscript were added to each sample and mixed. The solution was incubated at 20 °C for 10 min, 42 °C for 40 min, and then 95 °C for 5 min on a GeneAmp PCR System 9700. As a negative control RT was performed with sterile H2O replacing the RNA sample.QPCR was performed using the 7900HT fast real time PCR system from Applied Bioscie"

Proteins in the Bcl-2 family regulate this permeabilization, but the molecular composition of the mitochondrial outer membrane pore is under debate. We reported previously that at physiologically relevant levels, ceramides form stable channels in mitochondrial outer membranes capable of passing the largest proteins known to exit mitochondria during apoptosis (Siskind, L. J., Kolesnick, R. N., and Colombini, M. (2006) Mitochondrion 6, 118–125). Here we show that Bcl-2 proteins are not required for ceramide to form protein-permeable channels in mitochondrial outer membranes. However, both recombinant human Bcl-xL and CED-9, the Caenorhabditis elegans Bcl-2 homologue, disassemble ceramide channels in the mitochondrial outer membranes of isolated mitochondria from rat liver and yeast. Importantly, Bcl-xL and CED-9 disassemble ceramide channels in the defined system of solvent-free planar phospholipid membranes. Thus, ceramide channel disassembly likely results from direct interaction with these anti-apoptotic proteins. Mutants of Bcl-xL act on ceramide channels as expected from their ability to be anti-apoptotic.

Apoptosis is required for normal development and tissue homeostasis in multicellular organisms. Deregulation of apoptosis is fundamental to many diseases, such as cancer, stroke, heart disease, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune disorders, and viral diseases. During apoptosis, DNA fragments and other contents of the cell are packaged into apoptotic bodies that are consumed by phagocytosis. There are two main pathways for apoptosis, namely the extrinsic receptor-mediated pathway and an intrinsic mitochondria-mediated one. There is also cross-talk between these two pathways. The intrinsic pathway is initiated when one or more of a multitude of signals converge on mitochondria that ultimately result in an increase in the permeability of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). 2The abbreviations used are:MOMmitochondrial outer membraneBMKbaby mouse kidney epithelialC16-ceramideN-palmitoyl-sphingosineVDACvoltage-dependent anion-selective channelnSnanosiemensPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. This permeabilization leads to the release of intermembrane space proteins, including cytochrome c, procaspases, apoptosis-inducing factor, heat shock proteins, Smac/Diablo, and endonuclease G (1Saelens X.

The mechanism for the increased permeability of the MOM during the induction phase of apoptosis is currently highly debated. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins are released into the cytosol to facilitate apoptotic cell death. Some involve direct pore formation in the MOM. Several candidate pores exist, but most involve activated multidomain pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins, Bax and Bak (for example see Refs. 2Kuwana T.

Another model for MOM permeabilization involves channels formed by ceramide; ceramide can self-associate in membranes to form extremely large channels (6–10 nm in diameter) able to pass proteins (6Siskind L.J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 2005; 37: 143-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Ceramide (N-acylated sphingosine) is a sphingolipid found in membranes. Ceramide is generated by de novo synthesis, sphingomyelin hydrolysis, and recycling of sphingolipids. Ceramide is known to be involved in the regulation of several cellular processes, including differentiation, growth suppression, cell senescence, and apoptosis. Of these, the role of ceramide in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis has attracted much attention in recent years. Increases in cellular ceramide levels during apoptosis have been shown to occur prior to MOM permeabilization (7Witty J.P. Bridgham J.T. Johnson A.L.

Although channel formation by ceramide occurs in the MOM, it does not occur in the plasma membrane and thus is somehow influenced by the membrane environment (24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Remarkably, channel formation depends on the presence of the 4–5-trans double bond of the sphingoid base backbone of ceramide. Dihydroceramide, the precursor to ceramide in the de novo synthesis pathway, differs only from ceramide by lacking this double bond. This deficiency results in its inability to form channels (22Siskind L.J. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38640-38644Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar, 23Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol.

Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1618) Google Scholar). Thus, the ceramides that can induce apoptosis are also those that can form channels. Ceramide-induced permeabilization of the MOM shows the characteristics of an organized channel (23Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26796-26803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). As expected for a channel, ceramide allows the bi-directional flux of cytochrome c across the MOM and not just its release (23Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26796-26803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). Ceramide, when added to isolated mitochondrial suspensions, allows the release of other intermembrane space proteins, such as adenylate kinase (23Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26796-26803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In addition, unlike a detergent-like effect, there is a cutoff for the size of the mitochondrial intermembrane space proteins that are released through ceramide channels. This cutoff under the denaturing conditions of SDS-PAGE is about 60 kDa (23Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26796-26803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), but preliminary data indicate that it may be higher under nondenaturing conditions. 3J. Stiban and M. Colombini, unpublished observations. Unlike detergents, which irreversibly dissolve membranes, depletion of ceramide from the MOM restores its permeability barrier (23Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 26796-26803Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Studies with C16-ceramide indicate that less than 5% of the ceramide added to suspensions of isolated mitochondria actually inserts into the mitochondrial membranes (24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), and the permeability of the MOM is very sensitive to the amount of ceramide that inserts into mitochondria. Importantly, the formation of protein-permeable ceramide channels in MOMs occurs at physiologically relevant membrane concentrations (24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Only 4–8 pmol of ceramide/nmol of lipid phosphate is required for the formation of large protein-permeable channels in MOMs of isolated rat liver mitochondria (24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar), a level consistent with those reported to occur in mitochondria-enriched fractions during the early stages of apoptosis (16Birbes H.

However, a key question is whether protein release occurs through ceramide channels and, if so, whether or not these channels are regulated directly or indirectly by anti-apoptotic proteins in the MOM, such as Bcl-xL and Bcl-2. We address these questions here and find evidence that suggests that ceramide channels are good candidate pathways for protein release from mitochondria during the early stages of apoptosis. Materials—Phospholipids and ceramide were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Alabaster, AL. The ceramide was more than 99% pure. Cytochrome c, enzymes, and fatty acid-depleted bovine serum albumin were purchased from Sigma. Other materials used were reagent grade or as indicated below. Media and Growth Conditions—Wild-type and M22-2 (VDAC1 knock-out) yeast from frozen stocks were grown at 30 °C in lactic acid medium until they reached an OD600 of 0.6–0.8 (on HACH Co. spectrophotometer) at which point they were harvested for mitochondrial isolation as described previously (38Morizono H. Woolston J.E. Colombini M. Tuchman M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 86: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) Saccharomyces cerevisiae was transformed with either plasmid pAD4, a multicopy yeast expression vector carrying the LEU2 selectable marker, or pAD4-bcl-2, the same vector carrying the human BCL-2 gene under transcriptional control of the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH1) promoter (39Longo V.D. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D.E. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 137: 1581-1588Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Strains maintained on leucine-free dextrose (YPD) agar plates were grown on lactic acid/leucine medium at 30 °C until an OD600 of 0.6– 0.8 was reached. Mitochondria were isolated as described previously (38Morizono H. Woolston J.E. Colombini M. Tuchman M. Mol. Genet. Metab. 2005; 86: 431-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). All yeast mitochondria were finally resuspended in H-medium (10 mm HEPES, 0.6 m mannitol, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.2). Mitochondrial protein content and intactness of the MOM were measured as described previously (24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). The presence of Bcl-2 in mitochondria was confirmed via Western blot analysis utilizing rabbit anti-Bcl-2 polyclonal antibody (Chemicon International; Temecula, CA) and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA). Isolation of Rat Liver Mitochondria—Rat liver mitochondria were isolated from Sprague-Dawley males (150–300 g) by differential centrifugation; protein content was measured, and intactness of the MOM was determined as described previously (24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Isolated mitochondria were suspended in rH-buffer (0.28 m mannitol, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). Isolation of Mitochondria from Bax–/– Bak–/– Baby Mouse Kidney Epithelial (DKO BMK) Cells—DKO BMK cells, a kind gift from Dr. E. White (The Cancer Institute of New Jersey, Center for Advanced Biotechnology and Medicine), were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml of both penicillin and streptomycin, 0.3 mg/ml glutamine (Invitrogen) at 37 °C and humidified CO2 (5%). Cells were harvested by trypsinization, washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in 600 μl of Buffer A (68 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 0.05% (w/v) fatty-acid depleted bovine serum albumin, 50 μg/ml Pefabloc, and 15 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin). Cells were immediately lysed via 10 passages through a 28-guage insulin syringe, and the buffer was immediately made isotonic by the addition of 200 μl of 880 mm mannitol in Buffer A. Mitochondria were then isolated via differential centrifugation as described (24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) in homogenization medium (0.28 m mannitol, 5 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm EGTA, pH 7.4). Protein Purification—All proteins were purified in the complete absence of detergents. Full-length human Bcl-xL was purified using two different protocols as described (40Basanez G. Zhang J. Chau B.N. Maksaev G.I. Frolov V.A. Brandt T.A. Burch J. Hardwick J.M. Zimmerberg J. J. Biol.

Bcl-xL mutants (ΔN76, lacking amino acids 2–76; Δloop, lacking amino acids 26–83; ΔTM, lacking C-terminal amino acids 213–233 (42Clem R.J. Cheng E.H. Karp C.L. Kirsch D.G. Ueno K. Takahashi A.

Terrones O. Craig J.W. Basanez G. Hill R.B. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 14533-14542Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Measurement of the Permeability of the MOM Using the Complex IV Accessibility Assay—The permeability of the MOM to proteins was assessed by measuring the initial linear rate of oxidation of exogenously added reduced cytochrome c (24Siskind L.J. Kolesnick R.N. Colombini M. Mitochondrion. 2006; 6: 118-125Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) at room temperature (generally 23 °C). Mitochondria (80 μg total) were incubated at room temperature in 0.74 ml of either H-buffer (for yeast mitochondria) or rH-buffer (for rat liver mitochondria and those isolated from DKO BMK cells) supplemented with 0.1 mm carbonyl cyanide p-chlorophenylhydrazone and 5 μm antimycin A for 5 min prior to the incubation with a given test agent. When C16-ceramide (1 mg/ml isopropyl alcohol) was added to the mitochondrial suspension, it was added while vortexing to ensure rapid dispersion. At the end of the incubation period, the mitochondrial suspension was transferred to a cuvette, reduced cytochrome c added, and the absorbance at 550 nm monitored for 3 min. The initial linear portion of the rate (the first 30 s) was used as a measure of the permeability of the MOM to cytochrome c. This is expressed as a percentage of the rate measured in mitochondria whose outer membranes were lysed by hypotonic shock. These rates of cytochrome c oxidation in mitochondria with lysed outer membranes were as follows (in change in A550/s/μmol reduced cytochrome c added initially ± S.D. for at least three independent experiments): 11.1 ± 2.7, rat liver mitochondria; 5.6 ± 0.4, wild type yeast mitochondria; 4.9 ± 0.6, ΔVDAC1 mitochondria; 5.0 ± 0.7, BY4741 pAD4 mitochondria; 5.3 ± 0.9, BY4741 pAD4-Bcl-2 mitochondria; 3.3 ± 0.1 and Bax–/– Bak–/– mitochondria. This normalization allowed us to compare results from mitochondria isolated from different sources and combine data from different mitochondrial isolations. In addition, this normalization puts the data in a context where one can evaluate the percent MOM permeabilization. All vehicle controls were performed and found to have no effect on either MOM permeability or complex IV activity (tested by measuring the rate of cytochrome c oxidation in mitochondria with damaged outer membranes). In addition, all test agents (ceramide alone, protein alone, and ceramide and protein combined) were first tested on mitochondria whose outer membranes were damaged via hypotonic shock to ensure that there were no effects on complex IV activity. All experiments were produced in triplicate from three separate mitochondrial preparations. Measurement of MOM Permeability Using the Adenylate Kinase Release Assay—The release of adenylate kinase from the intermembrane space of isolated rat liver mitochondria was monitored as described previously (43Elrick M.J. Fluss S. Colombini M. Biophys. J. 2006; 91: 1749-1756Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). C16-ceramide (1 mg/ml isopropanol) was added to the mitochondrial suspension while vortexing to ensure rapid dispersion. The release of adenylate kinase indicates that the MOM was permeabilized at some point and therefore the % release is a measure of the percent permeabilization. All vehicle controls were performed and found to have no effect. The addition of CED-9 alone also had no significant effect on release of adenylate kinase. Experiments were performed in triplicate from three separate mitochondrial preparations. Electrophysiological Recordings—Solvent-free planar phospholipid membranes were produced by the monolayer method (44Montal M. Mueller P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 69: 3561-3566Crossref PubMed Scopus (1612) Google Scholar) as modified (45Colombini M. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 148: 465-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) across a 100-μm diameter hole in a Saran partition. Monolayers were produced using a solution of 0.5% (w/v) 1,2-diphytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, 0.5% (w/v) asolectin (polar extract of soybean phospholipids), 0.05% (w/v) cholesterol in hexane. The aqueous buffer bathing the planar phospholipid membranes consisted of 1.0 m KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm PIPES, pH 6.95. The transmembrane voltage was electronically clamped at –10 mV, and the current through the membrane was recorded. C16-ceramide was added to the cis side of the membrane while stirring from a stock solution of either 1 or 0.1 mg/ml in isopropyl alcohol. (The lower concentration is actually more effective in delivering ceramide to the membrane rather than aggregating in solution.) 5-, 10-, or 15-μl aliquots of the 0.1 mg/ml solution were stirred into 5 ml of solution on one side of the membrane depending on the vicissitudes of the experimental set up or the operator. Stirring was stopped after 15 s. Often multiple additions were needed to obtain the initial conductance increase. Typically this was followed by channel enlargement and stabilization at a particular conductance level. The solution was stirred again to ensure that the channel was indeed stable. Test proteins were then added while stirring to the aqueous solutions on both sides of the membrane. Ceramide-induced Permeabilization of the Mitochondrial Outer Membrane Is Inhibited by Bcl-xL and CED-9—To test whether ceramide channels are regulated by the anti-apoptotic proteins in the Bcl-2 family, ceramide-induced permeabilization of the outer membrane of isolated mitochondria was examined in the presence and absence of Bcl-xL. The complex IV accessibility assay was utilized as a means of measuring the permeability of the MOM. This assay measures the oxidation of exogenously added reduced cytochrome c by c"
https://openalex.org/W2017437397,"Long-term exposure to antivirals is associated with serious cellular toxicity to the kidney and other tissues. Organic anion transporters (OATs) are believed to mediate the cellular uptake, and hence cytotoxicity, of many antivirals. However, a systematic in vitro and ex vivo analysis of interactions between these compounds with various OAT isoforms has been lacking. To characterize substrate interactions with mOat1, mOat3, and mOat6, a fluorescence-based competition assay in Xenopus oocytes as well as wild-type and knock-out whole embryonic kidney (WEK) organ culture systems was developed using 6-carboxyfluorescein, 5-carboxyfluorescein, and fluorescein. Of nine common antiviral drugs assessed in oocytes, many manifested higher affinity for SLC22a6 (mOat1), originally identified as NKT (e.g. adefovir and cidofovir), two (ddC and ddI) manifested significantly higher affinity for mOat3, while mOat6 had comparatively low but measurable affinity for certain antivirals. A live organ staining approach combined with fluorescent uptake in WEK cultures allowed the visualization of OAT-mediated uptake ex vivo into developing proximal tubule-like structures, as well as quantification of substrate interactions of individual OAT isoforms. In general, antiviral specificity of SLC22a6 (Oat1) (in Oat3-/- WEK culture) and SLC22a8 (Oat3) (in Oat1-/- WEK culture) was consistent with the Xenopus oocyte data. The combined observations suggest SLC22a8 (Oat3) is the major transporter interacting with ddC and ddI. Finally, quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis of the nine antivirals' physicochemical descriptors with their OAT affinity indicates that antiviral preferences of mOat1 are explained by high polar surface areas (e.g. phosphate groups), whereas mOat3 prefers hydrogen bond acceptors (e.g. amines, ketones) and low rotatable bond numbers. In contrast, hydrogen bond donors (e.g. amides, alcohols) diminish binding to mOat6. This suggests that, despite sharing close overall sequence homology, Oat1, Oat3, and Oat6 have signficantly different binding pockets. Taken together, the data provide a basis for understanding potential drug interactions in combination antiviral therapy, as well as suggesting structural mdifications for drug design, especially in the context of targeting toward or away from specific tissues.

Since then, at least six OATs have been identified, all of which are members of the larger SLC22 family of transporters. Most closely related to SLC22a6 (Oat1) are SLC22a8 (Oat3), originally identified as Roct (6Brady K.P. Dushkin H. Fornzler D. Koike T. Magner F. Her H. Gullans S. Segre G.V. Green R.M. Beier D.R. Genomics. 1999; 56: 254-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), and the recently identified SLC22a20 (Oat6), expressed in olfactory mucosa (1Kaler G. Truong D.M. Sweeney D.E. Logan D.W.

Commun. 2004; 323: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Importantly, the OATs have been postulated to constitute the initial step in the uptake of antiviral nucleoside and nucleobase analog antiretroviral, uptake (8Burckhardt B.C. Burckhardt G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 146: 95-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 9Sweet D.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 198-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). To combat chronic disease because of HIV, herpes, smallpox, and other viruses, antiviral drugs are often administered, with HIV also requiring prolonged combination therapies as either triple or quadruple drug “cocktails” (10Young B. AIDS Patient Care STDS. 2005; 19: 286-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Unfortunately, long-term exposure to antivirals is often associated with nephrotoxicity, lactic acidosis, hepatic failure, and skeletal myopathy (11Lewis W. Prog. Cardiovasc.

Despite their plausible role via OAT transport in cytotoxicity, data on the relative affinity of antiviral drugs for OATs (Km or IC50) is limited mostly to Oat1 (13Wada S. Tsuda M. Sekine T. Cha S.H.

Y.). 2007; 24: 811-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). However, the relative contribution of each OAT to the uptake of antivirals in epithelial and other tissues is unknown. The analysis is further confounded by the presence of multiple, simultaneously expressed transporters; varying degrees of substrate specificity at the (individual) transporter level; as well as a complex pattern of tissue expression and cellular localization. These issues have yet to be addressed in a single system or in a single set of experiments; unfortunately, widely used heterologous systems for addressing OAT affinity do not take these issues into account. In the original description of NKT/Oat1, it was shown that the gene is expressed during kidney development (4Lopez-Nieto C.E. You G. Bush K.T. Barros E.J. Beier D.R. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6471-6478Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Whole organ culture could conceivably provide a system for studying substrate interactions in a complete environment, providing native cellular machinery recapitulating the whole tissue response ex vivo. Rat whole embryonic kidney (WEK) cultures have previously been shown to accumulate fluorescein in a probenecid-sensitive fashion (18Sweet D.H. Eraly S.A. Vaughn D.A. Bush K.T. Nigam S.K. Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 837-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Exploiting OATs expressed in WEKs, OAT isoform-specific fluorescent anion “trackers” capable of visualizing OAT-mediated uptake in organ systems could conceivably dissect the role of individual Oats in intact tissue. In fact, it has been shown that 6-carboxyfluorescein is an effective fluorescent tracer for studying hOat1-mediated translocation in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells (19Cihlar T. Ho E.S. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 283: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In general, carboxyfluoresceins (CF) have better kinetic properties for studying cellular OAT-mediated uptake than fluorescein, because the extra negative charge on the molecule allows for better cell retention (20De Clerck L.S. Bridts C.H. Mertens A.M. Moens M.M. Stevens W.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 172: 115-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). In light of this, we developed and characterized a fluorescence-based assay for Xenopus oocytes and WEKs for determining OAT isoform substrate interactions using differently substituted carboxyfluoresceins. Additionally, we have utilized the uptake of fluorescent OAT substrates in the in vitro and the whole organ system to determine the affinity values for a subset of nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI) and acyclic nucleotide/nucleoside antivirals interacting with mOat1, mOat3, and mOat6: adefovir, cidofovir, tenofovir, acyclovir, ddC, ddI, 3TC, d4T, and AZT (21De Clercq E. J. Clin. Virol. 2004; 30: 115-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). We demonstrate that mouse WEKs can be used for quantitative analyses and, using a novel live organ lectin staining procedure, localize distinct proximal tubule-like uptake patterns in WEK. By using mOat1 and mOat3 WEK knock-out strains, we confirm that adefovir and cidofovir interact predominantly with mOat1, although ddC and ddI seem to primarily interact with mOat3. The ex vivo data are generally consistent with our in vitro oocyte transport results obtained in this study. Finally, quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) analysis was used to correlate the physicochemical properties of the nine antiviral molecules with their relative binding interactions to mOat1, mOat3, and mOat6. These characteristics include polar surface area, presence of hydrogen bond donors and acceptors, and the number of rotatable bonds. Thus, we have quantitatively and systematically analyzed the interaction of commonly used antiviral drugs with OATs on multiple levels. These results should aid in the design of antivirals directed toward or away from OAT expressing tissues with the goal of enhancing or diminishing transport (and presumably toxicity) into tissue compartments, and help in predicting drug-drug interactions and cytotoxicity during combination therapy. The quantitative multilevel analysis should also help provide a “systems” basis for understanding antiviral handling via OATs. The radiolabeled tracers [3H]p-aminohippurate (PAH) (specific activity 4.2 Ci/mmol) and [3H]estrone-3-sulfate (ES) (57 Ci/mmol) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [3H]ddC (30 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals (Brea, CA). Fluorescent anions, TRITC-conjugated lectins (Dolichos biflorus lectin and Lotus lectin (Sigma)), and prototypical OAT compounds (ES, PAH), and fluorescent dyes (4-carboxyfluorescein dimethylester (4-CFDM), 5-carboxyfluorescein (5-CF), 6-carboxyfluorescein (6-CF), fluorescein, eosin Y, and resorufin) were obtained from Sigma. Antivirals (adefovir, cidofovir, tenofovir, acyclovir, zidovudine (AZT), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T), zalcitabane (ddC), and didanosine (ddI)) were obtained from Moravek Biochemicals or Sigma. Xenopus oocyte assays were performed as described previously (1Kaler G. Truong D.M. Sweeney D.E. Logan D.W. Nagle M. Wu W. Eraly S.A. Nigam S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Capped RNA was synthesized from linearized plasmid DNA for SLC22a6 (mOat1) (Image clone 4163278), SLC22a8 (mOat3) (Image clone 4239544), and SLC22a20 (mOat6) (Image clone 6309674;) using the mMessage mMachine in vitro transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). Briefly, oocytes were isolated and maintained in Barths buffer growth medium, injected with cRNA solution (0.5 μg/μl, 23 nl/oocyte), and allowed to mature for 3-4 days post-injection prior to transport assays. Experimental groups of 16-20 oocytes were placed in a 24-well plate with 1 ml of Barths buffer containing 1 μCi of a 3H-labeled organic anion tracer or a fluorescent anion tracer: 20 μm 6-CF (for mOat1-injected oocytes), 100 μm 5-CF (mOat3), or 30 μm fluorescein (mOat6). Samples contained different concentrations of an unlabeled organic anion. After a 1-h incubation at 25 °C, oocytes were washed 3 times with 4 °C Barths buffer and each experimental group was divided into four samples of 4-5 oocytes. Radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting (Rackbeta, Beckman-Coulter) or by fluorescence (PolarStar plate reader, BMG Labtechnologies, Durham, NC). To calculate the OAT-mediated component, the background tracer uptake was measured in uninjected oocytes and was subtracted from the uptake of OAT-injected oocytes in all experimental samples. Substrate activity was calculated for fluorescent tracers as the fluorescence clearance (CL) from the incubation medium (CL = Vtransport/S), by dividing the fluorescence (relative fluorescence units) absorbed per oocyte per unit time (Vtransport, relative fluorescence units/oocyte/h) by the tracer concentration in the incubation medium (S, relative fluorescence units/ml). [3H] transport rates utilize counts/min instead of the relative fluorescence unit term. Affinity of an inhibitor organic anion (IC50, Ki, or Km) was determined by measuring tracer uptake in the presence of 3-4 inhibitor concentrations in 10-fold increments. Each data point is the average of 2-3 experiments. Inhibition data were curve fitted using nonlinear regression in Prism software 5.0 (GraphPad Inc., San Diego, CA) to calculate the IC50 ± S.E., the Michaelis-Menten equation for Km, and the Ki value was determined as shown previously (23Kaler G. Truong D.M. Khandelwal A. Nagle M. Eraly S.A. Swaan P.W. Nigam S.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 23841-23853Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Maximum uptake (Vmax) was calculated as Vmax = CL · ([S]+ Ki), where CL values were measured in a single oocyte experiment with all fluorescent compounds tested at the concentration, S = 100 μm, and Ki values were from Table 1.TABLE 1OAT-binding affinities and transport characteristics of fluorescent substratesOATFluorescent substrateKiaCalculated from data of Fig. 1, the mean ± S.E.CLbFor each of the transporters, OAT-mediated clearance values were determined for all fluorescent tracers in a singie preparation of OAT-injected oocytes.

Kidney Int. 2006; 69: 837-845Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), whole kidneys were microdissected from embryonic day 13.5 mice (E13.5) and grown on polycarbonate Transwell filters with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Mediatech, Herndon, VA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Mediatech) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 37 °C for 4 days. All animal protocols conformed to NIH guidelines for acceptable animal use. Whole Embryonic Kidney Uptake Assay and Confocal Microscopy—After 4 days of culture, E13.5 kidneys were washed once in phosphate-buffered saline, and WEKs (on the filter) were incubated for 1 h at 25 °C in a minimal saline solution (phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1 mm CaCl2, and 1 mm MgCl2) with 1 μm fluorescent tracker (5-CF, 6-CF, or fluorescein) and with or without tracker uptake inhibitor (1-2 mm probenecid: PAH, ES, ddC, ddI, adefovir, or cidofovir). WEKs were also incubated with 20 μg/ml D. biflorus lectin, a collecting duct marker, or Lotus lectin, a proximal tubule marker (25Laitinen L. Virtanen I. Saxen L. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1987; 35: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Following the 1-h uptake, WEKs were washed 3 times in 4 °C phosphate-buffered saline, cut from the Transwell filter, and mounted on a glass slide with fluormount (Southern Biotech, Birmingham, AL). To prevent fluorescent tracker diffusion out of the cell, samples were kept on ice until imaged. Confocal images were taken with the Nikon D-eclipse C1 confocal microscope (A.G. Heinze, Lake Forest, CA). In each individual experiment images were taken using the same settings (e.g. gain, saturation) for intensity comparisons. Quantitative Image Analysis—Image analysis was carried out using the ImageJ software (NIH, Bethesda, MD) using pixel intensity measurements. Images were manually outlined twice to measure intensity, and then the average value obtained was taken as the total intensity of a kidney. Four representative background areas were traced in interstitial spaces. Average background measurements were then subtracted from the total intensity. Significance values were determined using the t test and all values represent triplicate kidney samples. QSAR Analysis—The antiviral affinity data for mOat1, mOat3, and mOat6 were correlated with physicochemical descriptors using multiple linear regression. IC50 values were converted to Ki before conversion to the -log value (pKi). The descriptors, molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds (RB), LogP, and the calculated molar refractivity were calculated using Sybyl software (Tripos Discovery Informatics, St. Louis, MO) where as number of hydrogen bond donor, number of hydrogen bond acceptor, and polar surface area (PSA) were calculated using the Chemaxon package. The affinity data (pKi) and various descriptors were used as dependent and independent variables, respectively. The final model for each OAT contains statistically significant descriptors (p < 0.05). Fluorescent Tracers for OAT-mediated Uptake—To identify fluorescent compounds with the potential to serve as tracers of OAT-mediated transport, a panel of six fluorescent anions was tested for suitable characteristics. Key criteria included a high Vmax (translocation rate) and a suitable Ki (affinity constant) to minimize the chance of tracer competition with the test compound. The affinity values for each fluorescent anion for mOat1, mOat3, and mOat6 were determined by inhibiting the uptake of a radiolabeled tracer, either PAH or ES (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The fluorescent compounds (fluorescein, 4-CFDM, 5-CF, 6-CF, eosin Y, and resorufin) were all found to have significant interaction with all OATs tested. Because this does not necessarily indicate they are substrates, the uptake rates (Vmax) of the fluorescent compounds were also determined for each transporter (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The uptake of 5 of the compounds (simultaneously tested at 100 μm and used to calculate the Vmax) were obtained in a single typical experiment. All compounds tested proved to be translocated by (i.e. to be substrates for) at least one of the three transporters. The data from Table 1 was then used to determine the best “tracers” (i.e. probes for cellular accumulation) and trackers (i.e. visualization of transport in organ culture systems) for the different transporters. Based on the Vmax values determined, 6-CF, 5-CF, and fluorescein had the best characteristics for being used as probes of the transport activities of, respectively, mOat1, mOat3, and mOat6. 6-CF had the best characteristics for mOat1 transport compared with other compounds tested exhibiting a Ki of 57.3 μm and a Vmax of 4.2 pmol/oocyte/h (Table 1). Although 6-CF binding affinity for mOat1 proved to be lower than that of fluorescein, 4-CFDM, eosin Y, and resorufin, the translocation rate, Vmax, was the highest (Table 1). Similarly, whereas 5-CF showed the poorest affinity for mOat3 (Ki, of 373.3 μm, compared with the second poorest, fluorescein, which was 35.1 μm), it had the highest Vmax value, 45.2 pmol/oocyte/h. Therefore, 5-CF has the best characteristics for use as a fluorescent mOat3 substrate. For mOat6, fluorescein had the second strongest binding affinity (Ki, 93.2 μm, compared with eosin Y, 5 μm) as well as the highest Vmax (5.1 pmol/oocyte/h), qualities that suggest its use as an effective tracer for mOat6. OAT Antiviral Affinities—Whereas mOat1 and mOat3 are coexpressed in many tissues, the relative proportion, as well as functionality, can be variable. For example, mOat1 is expressed in mouse olfactory mucosa (along with mOat6), whereas in retina, mOat3 expression appears higher than that of mOat1 (7Monte J.C. Nagle M.A. Eraly S.A. Nigam S.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 323: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, expression patterns are likely to be important determinants of tissue penetration for various antivirals. Using the identified fluorescent probes (5-CF, 6-CF, and fluorescein), binding affinities for a diverse group of antiviral drugs were determined for mOat1, mOat3, and mOat6 in Xenopus oocytes. The uptake of many of these compounds has been determined for hOat1 (8Burckhardt B.C. Burckhardt G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 146: 95-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 9Sweet D.H. Toxicol. Appl. Pharmacol. 2005; 204: 198-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 12Anderson P.L.

Due to structural homology, Oat3 and Oat6 might translocate them as well, although this remains to be determined. Because of this, and specifically for these compounds, IC50 (half-maximal inhibition of transport) should be a good approximation of transport affinity (Km), because translocation by a SLC22a family member has been established. Adefovir, tenofovir, cidofovir, and acyclovir all demonstrated significantly greater affinity for mOat1 than for its h"
https://openalex.org/W2024543323,"Plk1 (Polo-like kinase 1) has been documented as a critical regulator of many mitotic events. However, increasing evidence supports the notion that Plk1 might also have functions outside of mitosis. Using biochemical fractionation and RNA interference approaches, we found that Plk1 was required for both G1/S and G2/M phases and that DNA topoisomerase IIα (topoIIα) was a potential target for Plk1 in both interphase and mitosis. Plk1 phosphorylates Ser1337 and Ser1524 of topoIIα. Overexpression of an unphosphorylatable topoIIα mutant led to S phase arrest, suggesting that Plk1-associated phosphorylation first occurs in S phase. Moreover, overexpression of the unphosphorylatable topoIIα mutant activated the ATM/R-dependent DNA damage checkpoint, probably due to reduced catalytic activity of topoIIα, and resulted in accumulation of catenated DNA. Finally, we showed that wild type topoIIα, but not the unphosphorylatable mutant, was able to rescue topoIIα depletion-induced defects in sister chromatid segregation, indicating that Plk1-associated phosphorylation is essential for the functions of topoIIα in mitosis.

The cell cycle entails a series of macromolecular events that lead to cell division and the production of two daughter cells, each maintaining genetic information identical to that of the parental cell. DNA replication occurs during the S phase of the cell cycle and the duplicated chromosomes are distributed into two daughter cells during mitosis or the M phase. Precise temporal control of the cell cycle ensures a high fidelity of chromosome duplication/segregation, which occurs only when all covalent DNA links between replicated sister chromatids have been removed. The enzyme that decatenates covalently interlinked DNA molecules to disentangle intertwined chromosomes is DNA topoisomerase II (1Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar).

Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). It has been shown that the two isoforms are differentially regulated during cell cycle progression. Although the level of topoIIβ remains fairly constant across different phases of the cell cycle, topoIIα levels rise significantly in S phase, peak in G2/M phase, and then fall rapidly following mitosis (2Isaacs R.J.

In addition, the phosphorylation of topoIIα and topoIIβ is also regulated throughout the cell cycle. Mammalian topoIIα and topoIIβ are hyperphosphorylated at mitosis, and several M phase-specific phosphorylation sites have been identified (2Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J.

The role of phosphorylation in regulating topoIIα has been the subject of several publications, but no consistent pattern has emerged (2Isaacs R.J. Davies S.L. Sandri M.I. Redwood C. Wells N.J. Hickson I.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 121-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). In Drosophila, topoIIα was phosphorylated by a number of protein kinases, including casein kinase II, protein kinase C, and Cdc2 kinase. In all cases, phosphorylation stimulated enzyme activity (4Corbett A.H. Fernald A.W. Osheroff N. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 2090-2097Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In budding yeast, it was reported that dephosphorylation of topoIIα resulted in a loss of catalytic activity, suggesting that at least some phosphorylation was required for its activity (5Cardenas M.E. Gasser S.M. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 104: 219-225PubMed Google Scholar). However, studies with mammalian topoIIα yielded conflicting results. In one study, dephosphorylation of topoIIα by λ-phosphatase treatment had essentially no effect on its decatenation activity (6Escargueil A.E. Plisov S.Y. Filhol O. Cochet C. Larsen A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34710-34718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In a separate study, by mutating serine to alanine, Chikamori and colleagues showed that phosphorylation at Ser1106 in topoIIα positively regulated its enzymatic activity, and a kinase likely to be responsible for the phosphorylation was casein kinase II (7Chikamori K. Grabowski D.R. Kinter M. Willard B.B. Yadav S. Aebersold R.H. Bukowski R.M. Hickson I.D. Andersen A.H. Ganapathi R. Ganapathi M.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 12696-12702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In addition to cyclin-dependent kinases, Plk1 (Polo-like kinase 1) has also emerged as a key regulator involved in many cell cycle-related events, such as centrosome maturation, bipolar spindle formation, and cytokinesis (8Vugt van M.A. Medema R.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2844-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Barr F.A. Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Sufficient evidence also indicates that Plk1 plays a critical role in chromosome segregation at the onset of anaphase. In budding yeast, Cdc5-associated phosphorylation of cohesin subunit Scc1 strongly enhances its cleavage by separase, which leads to sister chromatid separation (10Alexandru G. Uhlmann F. Mechtler K. Poupart M.A. Nasmyth K. Cell. 2001; 105: 459-472Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). Using depletion experiments, Plx1, the Plk1 homolog in Xenopus, was shown to be required for cohesin displacement from chromosome arms in a phosphorylation-dependent manner (11Sumara I. Vorlaufer E. Stukenberg P.T. Kelm O. Redemann N. Nigg E.A. Peters J.M. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 515-525Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). In human cells, cohesin depletion-induced mitotic delay can be rescued by inhibition of topoII, suggesting that the accumulation of catenations by topoII inhibition in preseparated sister chromatids may overcome the reduced tension arising from cohesin depletion (12Toyoda Y. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2287-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Similarly, Plk1-associated phosphorylation of PICH, a centromere protein, also causes it to dissociate from chromatid arms to centromeres and lead to the formation of DNA threads connecting sister kinetochores. Remarkably, these PICH-positive threads are exacerbated by the inhibition of topoII or cohesin, suggesting that they represent stretched centromeric chromatin (13Baumann C. Korner R. Hofmann K. Nigg E.A. Cell. 2007; 128: 101-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The data accumulated so far are consistent with the model that topoII may act in the last step of sister kinetochore separation (13Baumann C. Korner R. Hofmann K. Nigg E.A. Cell. 2007; 128: 101-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In this paper, we show that topoIIα is also a Plk1 substrate both in vitro and in vivo, and the essential topoIIα functions during cell cycle progression might be regulated by Plk1-associated phosphorylation. Reagents—The phosphohistone H3 antibody (06-570) and Cdc2 antibody (06-923) were from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. The rabbit antibodies against TopoIIα and TopoIIβ were obtained from TopoGene. The mouse Plk1 antibody was ordered from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). The Ki-67 antibody was purchased from BD Transduction Laboratories. Vector Construction—To specifically deplete endogenous topoIIα in mammalian cells, plasmid pBS/U6-topoIIα was constructed as previously described (14Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). The targeting sequence of human topoIIα (accession number NM_001067) was GGTGAAGTTTAAGGCCCAAG, corresponding to 1242–1261 of the coding region relative to the first nucleotide of the start codon. Plasmid pBS/U6-topoIIα-1st half (sense strand) was used as a control vector. This control vector produces RNA that cannot form a hairpin structure to generate interfering RNA (RNAi). Plasmid pBS/U6-Plk1 was previously described (14Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Cell Culture and Synchronization—HeLa, U2OS, and hTERT-RPE1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units ml-1 penicillin, and 100 units ml-1 streptomycin at 37 °C in 8% CO2. To synchronize HeLa cells, cells were treated with 2.5 mm thymidine for 16 h, released for 8 h, and then treated with thymidine a second time for 16 h. After two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), cells were cultured for different times as indicated in each experiment and harvested. Based on our experience, cells enter S phase after 4 h of release and accumulate in G2 phase after 8 h of release into normal medium. Most cells arrest at mitosis after 12 h of release in the presence of 100 ng ml-1 of nocodazole, and 13.5 h of release in the absence of nocodazole results in at least 50% of cells at telophase/cytokinesis. Alternatively, cells were treated with 0.3 mm mimosine for 20 h, 4 mm hydroxyurea for 24 h, or 200 ng ml-1 nocodazole for 12 h to arrest at G1, S, or M phase, respectively. DNA Transfections—For phenotype analysis of gene depletion in randomly growing cells, HeLa cells were co-transfected with pBS/U6-topoIIα or pBS/U6-Plk1 and pBabe-puro at a ratio of 8:1 using GenePorter reagents. After 2 days of selection for transfection-positive cells with 2 μg ml-1 puromycin, floating cells were washed away with PBS, and the attached cells were incubated until harvesting for phenotypic analysis. To deplete topoIIα in well synchronized cells, cells were treated with thymidine for 16 h, co-transfected with pBS/U6-topoIIα and pBabe-puro, incubated for 8 h, and blocked with the second dose of thymidine in the presence of puromycin for 20 h. After synchronization/selection, the floating cells were removed, and the remaining cells were released into fresh medium for different times. To rescue the topoIIα depletion-induced phenotypes, cells growing on coverslips were co-transfected with pBS/U6-topoIIα and RNAi-resistant GFP-topoIIα (WT or Plk1 unphosphorylatable mutant) at a ratio of 5:1 and subjected to the thymidine block. Upon release into fresh medium for different times, cells were stained with 4′,6′-diamidino-2-phenylinodole (DAPI), and GFP-positive cells were analyzed. Isolation of Nuclear and Chromosome-binding Fractions—Cytosolic, nuclear, and chromosome-binding fractions from cell lysates were prepared by using a Qproteome nuclear protein kit (Qiagen). Briefly, harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer supplemented with detergent solution NP. After centrifugation for 5 min, the supernatant was collected as the cytoplasmic fraction. The nuclei pellet was resuspended in nuclear protein lysis buffer NL and centrifuged for 5 min. After removing the supernatant, the nuclear pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer NX1. After a 10-min spin, the supernatant was collected as the soluble nuclear fraction. The insoluble pellet was resuspended in extraction buffer NX2 supplemented with benzonase and incubated for 1 h with gentle agitation. After another 10-min spin, the supernatant was collected as the chromosome-binding fraction. Kinase Assay—Cdc2 was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with a Cdc2 antibody and resuspended in TBMD buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 2 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm sodium vanadate, 20 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate) supplemented with 25 μm ATP and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence of histone H1 as a substrate and resolved by SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, dried, and subjected to autoradiography. Mitotic Chromosome Spread—Chromosome spread analysis was performed as described (12Toyoda Y. Yanagida M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2287-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-topoIIα (WT or Plk1 unphosphorylatable mutant) and blocked at M phase with nocodazole treatment for 12 h. Mitotic cells were mechanically shaken off of plates, washed with PBS, and swollen in a hypotonic solution (75 mm KCl), followed by spreading using a 1000-rpm spin for 5 min. Spread cells were fixed by paraformaldehyde and subsequently stained with DAPI. Topoisomerase IIα Activity Assay—TopoIIα enzymatic activity was assayed by measuring the decatenation of kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) as described (15Shapiro P.S. Whalen A.M. Tolwinski N.S. Wilsbacher J. Froelich-Ammon S.J. Garcia M. Osheroff N. Ahn N.G. Mol. Cell Biol. 1999; 19: 3551-3560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A standard assay was carried out in a total volume of 20 μl, including 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 88 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm dithiothreitol, 100 μg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, and 125 ng of kDNA. The reaction mixture containing equal amounts of topoIIα (WT, S1337A/S1524A, or S1337E/S1524E) was incubated at 37 °C for different times, and the reaction was stopped by the addition of 5 μl of stop solution (5% SDS, 25% Ficoll, and 0.05% bromphenol blue). The samples were resolved by electrophoresis at 115 V using a 1% agarose gel in a Tris acetate-EDTA buffer. Following electrophoresis, the gel was stained with ethidium bromide and photographed under UV illumination. Plk1 Functions in G1/S Phase—It has been well documented that Plk1 is involved in many mitotic processes, such as mitotic entry, bipolar spindle formation in metaphase, and cytokinesis (8Vugt van M.A. Medema R.H. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 2844-2859Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 9Barr F.A. Sillje H.H. Nigg E.A. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 429-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). However, several recent reports indicate that Plk1 might have additional functions outside of mitosis. For example, Plk1 is required for recovery from the DNA replication checkpoint response, which occurs in S phase (16Yoo H.Y. Kumagai A. Shevchenko A. Shevchenko A. Dunphy W.G. Cell. 2004; 117: 575-588Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Based on immunofluorescence (IF) staining, it has long been believed that Plk1 starts to express in the cytoplasm at late S or early G2 phase (17Golsteyn R.M. Schultz S.J. Bartek J. Ziemiecki A. Ried T. Nigg E.A. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To further examine the possible non-M phase functions of Plk1, HeLa cells were synchronized with a double thymidine block protocol (16 h of thymidine treatment and 8 h of release, followed by a second 16-h incubation with thymidine). At different times after release from the block, cells were harvested and fractionated into cytoplasmic, nuclear, and chromosome-binding fractions. Different subcellular fractions were then analyzed by Western blot. Based on FACS analysis, cells were arrested at late G1 after the block, went though S phase at 4–6 h postrelease, reached G2 phase at 8 h postrelease, and entered mitosis at 10 h postrelease (data not shown). As shown in Fig. 1A, Plk1 was clearly detected at early S phase in HeLa cells (4 h after release). Significantly, Plk1 was mainly localized in the nucleus during S phase and G2 phase and was also localized to chromosomes during G2/M phase (Fig. 1A). This apparent inconsistency might be due to the fact that only cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed in the previous study. To determine whether the nuclear localization of Plk1 was a general phenomenon, U2OS, another tumor cell line, and hTERT-RPE1, a nontransformed cell line, were used to further analyze Plk1 localization and expression. Cells were treated with mimosine, hydroxyurea, or nocodazole to block at G1, S, or M phase, respectively. Cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were prepared for anti-Plk1 Western blot analysis. Nuclear localization of Plk1 during interphase was clearly detected in HeLa cells and U2OS cells but not in hTERT-RPE1 cells (Fig. 1B), indicating that the nuclear localization of Plk1 might be tumor cell-specific. Moreover, two tumor cell lines showed much higher overall levels of Plk1 than that of RPE1 cells, in agreement with the notion that Plk1 overexpression might be correlated with transformation (18Eckerdt F. Yuan J. Strebhardt K. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 267-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Nuclear localization of Plk1 in HeLa cells was also observed by IF staining, using a modified permeabilization/fixation protocol (Fig. 1C). Next, RNAi was used to test whether Plk1 was required for cell cycle progression in the early stages, such as G1 and S phases. Plk1 was depleted by using a vector-based RNAi approach in randomly growing cells as previously described (14Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Upon nocodazole treatment, control cells quickly accumulated at the G2/M phase, as shown by the increase in cell population with 4 n DNA content by FACS. In contrast, Plk1-depleted cells were much more resistant to nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1, D and E). To confirm this observation, we also examined the degradation rate of cyclin E, a G1/S marker protein. In control cells, cyclin E was almost completely degraded after 6 h of treatment with nocodazole. However, a significant amount of cyclin E was still detected in Plk1-depleted cells even after 12 h of nocodazole treatment (Fig. 1F), indicating that Plk1 might be required for G1/S phase. Finally, Plk1-depleted cells were also treated with nocodazole for shorter times and stained with a phosphohistone H3 antibody, a mitotic marker. The ratio between phosphohistone H3-positive cells and the cell population with 4 n DNA content was used to follow the G2/M transition. For control cells, the percentage of phosphohistone H3-positive cells out of cells with 4 n DNA content clearly increased upon nocodazole treatment. However, such an increase was not detected in the Plk1-depleted cells, supporting the notion that Plk1 is required for mitotic entry (Fig. 1G). To further appreciate the potential involvement of Plk1 in the early stages of cell cycle, we next tried to deplete Plk1 in a synchronized culture. Accordingly, HeLa cells were depleted of Plk1 and treated with thymidine for 24 h to block at the G1/S boundary. Cells were then released into fresh medium for different times in the presence or absence of nocodazole and harvested. The double thymidine block protocol is not ideal for these experiments, since Plk1 depletion also causes dramatic G2/M block. As indicated, Plk1 depletion was very efficient using such a protocol (Fig. 2A). To be consistent with the results obtained with an asynchronous culture as described above, Plk1-depleted cells showed an obvious G1 peak during the entire releasing period, even in the presence of nocodazole, whereas control cells quickly entered mitosis (Fig. 2, B and C). It has been documented that Plk1 depletion leads to cell cycle arrest, followed by apoptosis in HeLa cells (14Liu X. Erikson R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 5789-5794Crossref PubMed Scopus (437) Google Scholar). Thus, in addition to the normal 2 n, 4 n peaks, cells with sub-G1 DNA content (1 n peak) were detected at later stages of nocodazole treatment after Plk1 depletion (Fig. 1D). In a synchronized culture after Plk1 depletion, apoptotic cells with 1 n DNA content were also detected after 8 h of release from the thymidine block, even in the absence of nocodazole (Fig. 2B), indicating that the apoptotic cell death we observed in Fig. 1D is not due to nocodazole treatment. TopoIIα Interacts with Plk1 in Vivo—To search for a possible Plk1 target during interphase, we turned our attention to DNA topoIIα, which is well known to be overexpressed in tumor cells and has functions in both S and M phases (1Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In addition, topoIIα was also found to be one of several potential Plk1 substrates in a yeast two-hybrid screen to search for Plk1-interacting proteins. To test whether topoIIα is a binding partner of Plk1, cells were treated with mimosine, hydroxyurea, or nocodazole to block at G1, S, or M phase, respectively. Soluble nuclear and chromosome-binding fractions were combined and subjected to anti-Plk1 immunoprecipitation (IP), followed by anti-topoIIα Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 3A, topoIIα was co-immunoprecipitated with Plk1 in both hydroxyurea and nocodazole-treated cells, but not in mimosine-treated cells, indicating that the binding between topoIIα and Plk1 occurs during S and G2/M phase in vivo. Both topoIIα and Plk1 were clearly detected in the nuclei of randomly growing cells by Western blot analysis (Fig. 3B). TopoIIβ and Erk2 were used as loading controls to indicate efficient subcellular fractionation. The nuclear co-localization of topoIIα and Plk1 was further confirmed by IF analysis (Fig. 3C). Based on these data, we hypothesized that topoIIα might be a substrate of Plk1 in both interphase and mitosis. TopoIIα Is Required for Cell Proliferation—To investigate the functions of topoIIα during normal cell cycle progression, we first used vector-based RNAi to specifically deplete topoIIα in HeLa cells. As indicated by Western blot analysis, topoIIα was efficiently depleted with this approach (Fig. 4A). We next determined whether topoIIα depletion influences the proliferation of HeLa cells. Although transfection with the control vector did not affect the growth rate of cells, transfection with the plasmid pBS/U6-topoIIα strongly inhibited cell proliferation (Fig. 4B). We also examined the viability of topoIIα-depleted cells. Transfection with the control vector showed little effect on cell viability, whereas <10% of topoIIα-depleted cells were still attached to the culture dishes at 6 days post-transfection (Fig. 4C). To characterize the inhibition of cell growth by topoIIα depletion, cell cycle progression was analyzed by FACS. As shown in Fig. 4D, transfection with the control vector did not affect the cell cycle profile, whereas topoIIα depletion induced a slight increase of cell population in G2/M phase and obvious cell cycle arrest at S phase. Alternatively, these results may be due to the possibility that topoIIα-depleted cells undergo an aberrant mitosis, resulting in daughter cells with highly unequal DNA content. Starting from 5 days post-transfection, topoIIα-depleted cells showed a significant sub-G1 population (Fig. 4D), suggesting that these cells were undergoing apoptosis. To further analyze this phenotype in topoIIα-depleted cells, an anti-caspase 3 Western blot was performed (Fig. 4E). Caspase 3, the executioner caspase in apoptosis, was clearly activated in topoIIα-depleted cells, as shown by the cleavage of full-length protein. Finally, a BrdUrd labeling approach was used to confirm the S phase arrest induced by topoIIα depletion. As shown in Fig. 4F, at 3 days post-transfection, topoIIα-depleted cells showed a slightly higher percentage of BrdUrd-positive cells compared with that of control cells, indicating that topoIIα is not required for DNA synthesis per se but might be involved in other interphase functions. Depletion of TopoIIα Leads to Multiple Cell Cycle Defects—Considering that topoIIα is involved in chromosome condensation and segregation (1Nitiss J.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 63-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), we next examined the possible mitotic defects induced by topoIIα depletion. For that purpose, topoIIα was depleted in synchronized cells using the protocol shown in Fig. 5A. TopoIIα-depleted cells showed obvious defects in chromosome behavior during mitosis, especially in sister chromatid separation. As shown in Fig. 5B, topoIIα-depleted cells were eventually able to go through mitosis but with obvious connected DNA bridges between separated sister chromatids through all late mitotic stages, including anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis (Fig. 5B). To confirm the formation of DNA bridges, topoIIα-depleted cells were treated with either DNase or RNase (Fig. 5C). We found that these bridges were sensitive to DNase but not RNase treatment, indicating that they contain DNA. To further analyze topoIIα depletion-induced phenotypes, mitotic progression was followed by staining with a phosphohistone H3 antibody. Although no dramatic difference between control cells and topoIIα-depleted cells was detected, topoIIα-depleted cells showed a slight delay in mitotic exit (Fig. 5D). Interestingly, phosphohistone H3 staining was positive in the DNA bridges connecting the separating sister chromatids, even long after cell division (Fig. 5E). We also assessed the percentage of cells expressing the proliferation marker Ki67, which is normally expressed in cells in G1,S,G2, and M phases but not in G0 (19Gerdes J. Lemke H. Baisch H. Wacker H.H. Schwab U. Stein H. J. Immunol. 1984; 133: 1710-1715PubMed Google Scholar). Almost 100% of control cells were detected as Ki67-positive, whereas only about 33% of topoIIα-depleted cells were Ki67-positive, indicating that a significant portion of topoIIα-depleted cells had exited the cell cycle (Fig. 5F). Abnormal nuclear morphology was also observed in topoIIα-depleted cells. Based on DAPI staining, cells can be further categorized into three groups: cells with a normal nucleus, cells with a deformed nucleus, and multinucleated cells. For control cells, ∼95% contained normal nuclei, ∼5% of cells were multinucleated, and very few cells with deformed nuclei were detected. In striking contrast, almost 30% of topoIIα-depleted cells had deformed nuclei, and 20% of topoIIα-depleted cells were multinucleated (Fig. 5G). Taken together, these results indicate that topoIIα is required for chromosome segregation in mitosis. As a different approach, two topoII inhibitors were also utilized to study the effects on cell cycle progression. Accordingly, HeLa cells were synchronized using the double thymidine block, released for different times in the presence of VP16 or ICRF193, and harvested for FACS (Fig. 6). Since a much more stringent synchronization protocol was used here (double thymidine block in Fig. 6 versus a single thymidine block in Fig. 2), FACS profiles of control samples at 0 h points are slightly different, with a better synchronization result after the double thymidine block. Cells treated with VP16 were blocked in S phase over the entire releasing period, probably due to the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint. By inhibiting the religation activity of topoII, VP16 treatment leads to DNA double strand breaks (20Kaufmann S.H. Desnoyers S. Ottaviano Y. Davidson N.E. Poirier G.G. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3976-3985PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, ICRF193 is a topoII inhibitor that does not cause DNA damage but arrests the enzyme at a point in its catalytic cycle after strand passage and religation but before release of the passed DNA (21Roca J. Ishida R. Berger J.M. Andoh T. Wang J.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 1781-1785Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Cells treated with ICRF193 were able to progress into mitosis and blocked there. Therefore, topoII activity is not essential for DNA replication but is absolutely required for mitosis. That BrdUrd incorporation is not affected in topoIIα-depleted cells also supports such a notion (Fig. 4F). However, we do observe an increase of S phase population in"
https://openalex.org/W1995458985,"Polyploidization is a major evolutionary process in plants where hybridization and chromosome doubling induce enormous genomic stress and can generate genetic and epigenetic modifications. However, proper evaluation of DNA sequence restructuring events and the precise characterization of sequences involved are still sparse.Inter Retrotransposons Amplified Polymorphism (IRAP), Retrotransposons Microsatellite Amplified Polymorphism (REMAP) and Inter Simple Sequence Repeat (ISSR) largely confirmed the absence of any intraspecific variation in wheat, rye and triticale. The comparative analysis of banding profiles between wheat and rye inbred lines revealed 34% of monomorphic (common to both parental species) bands for the ten different primer combinations used. The analysis of triticale plants uncovered nearly 51% of rearranged bands in the polyploid, being the majority of these modifications, due to the loss of rye bands (83%). Sequence analysis of rye fragments absent in triticale revealed for instance homology with hydroxyproline-rich glycoproteins (HRGP), a protein that belongs to a major family of inducible defence response proteins. Conversely, a wheat-specific band absent in triticale comprises a nested structure of copia-like retrotransposons elements, namely Claudia and Barbara. Sequencing of a polyploid-specific band (absent in both parents) revealed a microsatellite related sequence. Cytological studies using Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization (FISH) with REMAP products revealed a widespread distribution of retrotransposon and/or microsatellite flanking sequences on rye chromosomes, with a preferential accumulation in heterochromatic sub-telomeric domains.Here, we used PCR-based molecular marker techniques involving retrotransposons and microsatellites to uncover polyploidization induced genetic restructuring in triticale. Sequence analysis of rearranged genomic fragments either from rye or wheat origin showed these to be retrotransposon-related as well as coding sequences. Further FISH analysis revealed possible chromosome hotspots for sequence rearrangements. The role of chromatin condensation on the origin of genomic rearrangements mediated by polyploidization in triticale is also discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2125797299,"Cardiac hypertrophy is regulated by a complex interplay of pro- and anti-hypertrophic factors. Here, we report a novel anti-hypertrophic pathway composed of catalase, protein kinase CK2 (CK2), and apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC). Our results showed that ARC phosphorylation levels, CK2 activity, and catalase expression levels were decreased in the hearts of the angiotensinogen transgenic mice and in cardiomyocytes treated with the hypertrophic stimuli, including phenylephrine, tumor necrosis factor-α, and angiotensin II. To understand the role of ARC in hypertrophy, we observed that enforced expression of ARC could inhibit hypertrophy. Knockdown of endogenous ARC or inhibition of its phosphorylation could sensitize cardiomyocytes to undergoing hypertrophy. The phosphorylatable, but not the nonphosphorylatable, ARC could inhibit hypertrophy. Thus, ARC is able to inhibit hypertrophy in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. In exploring the molecular mechanism by which CK2 activity is reduced, we found that CK2 was carbonylated in angiotensinogen transgenic mice and in cardiomyocytes treated with the hypertrophic stimuli. The decrease in catalase expression led to an elevated level of reactive oxygen species. The latter oxidatively modified CK2, resulting in its carbonylation. CK2 lost its catalytic activity upon carbonylation. ARC is phosphorylated by CK2, and ARC phosphorylation levels were reduced as a consequence of the decrease of CK2 activity. To understand the molecular mechanism by which ARC inhibits hypertrophy, we observed that ARC could inhibit the activation of mitochondrial permeability transition. These results suggest that catalase, CK2, and ARC constitute an anti-hypertrophic pathway in the heart. Cardiac hypertrophy is regulated by a complex interplay of pro- and anti-hypertrophic factors. Here, we report a novel anti-hypertrophic pathway composed of catalase, protein kinase CK2 (CK2), and apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain (ARC).

The decrease in catalase expression led to an elevated level of reactive oxygen species. The latter oxidatively modified CK2, resulting in its carbonylation. CK2 lost its catalytic activity upon carbonylation. ARC is phosphorylated by CK2, and ARC phosphorylation levels were reduced as a consequence of the decrease of CK2 activity. To understand the molecular mechanism by which ARC inhibits hypertrophy, we observed that ARC could inhibit the activation of mitochondrial permeability transition. These results suggest that catalase, CK2, and ARC constitute an anti-hypertrophic pathway in the heart. Cardiac hypertrophy is a common response to a variety of physiological as well as pathophysiological stimuli. The hypertrophic response enables the heart to meet the increased functional demands. However, sustained cardiac hypertrophy is often accompanied by maladaptive cardiac remodeling leading to heart failure. Cardiac hypertrophy remains a major dilemma; a growing number of hypertrophic inducers but, as yet, only a few inhibitors have been identified.

Its high cardiac expression levels make it a unique and central cardioprotective agent in the heart (1Koseki T. Inohara N. Chen S. Nunez G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although hypertrophy and apoptosis are two distinct cellular events, many stimuli can induce both hypertrophy and apoptosis. In particular, hypertrophic cells may convert to apoptotic cells. For example, angiotensin II (Ang II) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) can induce both hypertrophy and apoptosis (8Barlucchi L. Leri A. Dostal D.E. Fiordaliso F. Tada H. Hintze T.H. Kajstura J.

Furthermore, apoptosis may play a driving role in the transition from compensated hypertrophy to failure in the work-overloaded myocardium (10Crow M.T. Mani K. Nam Y.J. Kitsis R.N. Circ.

Hypertrophy is conveyed by a complex signal transduction pathway. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can mediate the hypertrophic signals. For example, TNF-α causes hypertrophy via the generation of ROS in cardiomyocytes (11Nakamura K. Fushimi K. Kouchi H. Mihara K. Miyazaki M. Ohe T. Namba M. Circulation. 1998; 98: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). ROS can mediate the hypertrophic signals of phenylephrine (PE) (12Tanaka K. Honda M. Takabatake T. J. Am. Coll. Cardiol. 2001; 37: 676-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) and Ang II (9Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although it is well known that catalase is a ROS scavenger, it remains largely unknown as to how catalase is integrated into the hypertrophic cascades. Protein kinase CK2 (CK2) is a serine/threonine protein kinase ubiquitously expressed in eukaryotic cells. It plays a key role in cell cycle control, cellular differentiation, and proliferation. CK2 is characterized by its constitutive activation. It has been shown that CK2 phosphorylates ARC at Thr-149 (13Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar, 14Zhang Y.Q. Herman B. J. Cell. Biochem. 2006; 99: 575-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It is not yet clear whether CK2 can regulate cardiac hypertrophy. Our present study showed that the expression levels of catalase were reduced in response to the hypertrophic stimulation. CK2 was oxidatively modified. As a consequence, ARC could not be phosphorylated and, thus, failed to inhibit the activation of mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT). Finally, hypertrophy was initiated. Our study reveals a novel anti-hypertrophic pathway that is composed of catalase, CK2, and ARC. Materials—PE, cyclosporin A, SP600125, TNF-α, 4,5,6,7-tetrabromo-2-azabenzimidazole (TBB), anti-dinitrophenyl (anti-DNP) antibody, catalase, N-acetyl-l-cysteine, pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate, and phalloidin-TRITC were purchased from (Sigma). 2′,7′-Dichlorofluorescein diacetate and tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester were purchased from Molecular Probes Inc. Anti-CK2-α antibody was from Upstate. Fostriecin and SB239063 were from Calbiochem. Anti-ARC antibody was from Chemicon. Anti-phospho Thr-149 antibody was from Eurogentec. CK2 was from Promega. The adenovirus harboring catalase was a kind gift from Dr. Joseph J. Cullen. Preparations and Transfection of ARC Antisense Oligonucleotides—ARC antisense oligonucleotides were synthesized to inhibit endogenous ARC expression. The sequences of phosphothioate-modified antisense oligonucleotides targeted to ARC were ARC antisense oligonucleotides (ARC-AS), 5′-TGGGCATGGAGGGTCATAGCT-3′; scrambled ARC antisense oligonucleotides (S-ARC-AS), 5′-GTAGGCTGAGGTCGATCGGTA-3′ and ARC sense oligonucleotides (ARC-S), 5′-AGCTATGACCCTCCATGCCCA-3′. The specificity of the oligonucleotides was confirmed by comparison with all other sequences in GenBank™ using nucleotide BLAST. There was no homology to other known rat DNA sequences. Cells were transfected with the oligonucleotides by using Lipofectin (Life Technology). Constructions of Adenoviruses Harboring ARC, Catalase RNAi, or CK2α RNAi—The adenoviruses harboring the wild-type rat ARC (AdARC), an ARC mutant with Thr-149 converted to an aspartic acid residue (AdARC149D) and an ARC mutant with Thr-149 converted to the alanine residue (AdT149A) were constructed using the Adeno-X™ expression system (Clontech). Viruses were amplified in HEK293 cells. The adenovirus containing β-galactosidase (Adβ-galactosidase) is described elsewhere (15Li P.F. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). The rat catalase RNAi target sequence is 5′-TGGCTATGGCTCACACACC-3′. A nonrelated, scrambled RNAi without any other match in the rat genomic sequence was used as a control (5′-CACTGACAGTCTGACTCCG-3′). The rat CK2α RNAi target sequence is 5′-ATCAAGATGACTACCAGCT-3′. A scrambled RNAi was used as a control (5′-ATCAAGACTACGACTTCAG-3′). The adenoviruses harboring these RNAi were constructed using the pSilencer™ adeno 1.0-CMV System (Ambion) according to the kit's instructions. The effects of these constructs on catalase and CK2α expression were tested. Our results showed that they could significantly inhibit the expression of catalase and CK2α, respectively, in rat cardiomyocytes. Cardiomyocytes Isolation and Culture—Cardiomyocytes were isolated from 1- to 2-day-old Wistar rats as described (16von Harsdorf R. Li P.F. Dietz R. Circulation. 1999; 99: 2934-2941Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). Briefly, after dissection hearts were washed and minced in HEPES-buffered saline solution (containing (mm): 130 NaCl, 3 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, 4 glucose, and 20 HEPES; pH adjusted to 7.35 with NaOH). Tissues were then dispersed in a series of incubations at 37°C in HEPES-buffered saline solution containing 1.2 mg/ml pancreatin and 0.14 mg/ml collagenase (Worthington). After centrifugation cells were re-suspended in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 (Amersham Biosciences) containing 5% heat-inactivated horse serum, 0.1 mm ascorbate, insulin-transferring-sodium selenite media supplement, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mm bromodeoxyuridine. The dissociated cells were pre-plated at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then diluted to 1 × 106 cells/ml and plated in 10 μg/ml laminin-coated different culture dishes according to the specific experimental requirements. Angiotensinogen Transgenic Mice—Angiotensinogen transgenic mice were as described elsewhere (17Kimura S. Mullins J.J. Bunnemann B. Metzger R. Hilgenfeldt U. Zimmermann F. Jacob H. Fuxe K. Ganten D. Kaling M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 821-827Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 18Kang N. Walther T. Tian X.L. Bohlender J. Fukamizu A. Ganten D. Bader M. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). They were maintained as a heterozygous transgenic line on the NMRI genetic background (Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany). Animals were maintained under standardized conditions with an artificial 12 h dark-light cycle, with free access to food and water. 9- to 10-week-old male and age-matched wild-type male mice were used in the experiments. This research was performed in compliance with the Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the local authorities. CK2 Activity Assay—CK2 activity was measured as previously described (13Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Reactions were carried out in buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 100 mm NaCl, 20 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 5 μCi GTP, and 0.1 mm CK2 peptide (Arg-Arg-Glu-Glu-Glu-Thr-Glu-Glu-Glu, from Biomol). Adenovirus Infection and CK2 Inhibition—Cardiomyocytes were infected with adenoviruses as previously described (15Li P.F. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). In experiments employing CK2 inhibitor, cells were pretreated with TBB for 50 min prior to inducing hypertrophy. Cell Surface Area Measurement—Cell surface area of F-actin-stained cells or unstained cells was measured 48 h after employing hypertrophic stimuli by computer-assisted planimetry. 100–200 cardiomyocytes in 20–50 fields were examined in each experiment. [3H]Leucine Incorporation—Cardiomyocytes were infected with AdARC or Adβ-galactosidase. 24 h after infection they were treated with the hypertrophic stimuli for 48 h in the presence of [3H]leucine (1.0 μCi/ml). Thereafter, cells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline, incubated with 5% trichloroacetic acid for 20 min at 4°C, and lysed with 0.5 m NaOH. Scintillation fluid was applied to the lysates, and the mixtures were counted in a liquid scintillation counter. Analysis of ANF Expression by Northern Blotting—Atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) expression was detected by Northern blotting as reported previously (19Li P.F. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. Circulation. 1997; 96: 3602-3609Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Briefly, pre-hybridization was conducted at 42 °C for 4 h in a pre-hybridization buffer: 50% formamide, 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent, 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 7% SDS (w/v), and 0.1% N-laurylsarkosine (w/v). Hybridization was performed in the same buffer and temperature for 30 h with digoxigenin-labeled ANF cDNA probe. For chemiluminescence detection, the membrane was blocked for 30 min in 2.5% blocking reagent and then incubated for 30 min with anti-digoxigenin antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. After two washes with 100 mm maleic acid buffer containing 0.3% Tween 20, CSPD substrate solution was added to the membrane, and the mixture was incubated for 10 min. The same membrane was stripped and re-probed with glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a loading control. Intracellular ROS and Mitochondrial Membrane Potential (Δψm) Analysis—Intracellular ROS levels were analyzed by employing ROS-sensitive dye, 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein diacetate as described (15Li P.F. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6027-6036Crossref PubMed Scopus (427) Google Scholar). Dichlorofluorescein fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry. For the detection of Δψm 100 nm tetramethylrhodamine ethyl ester was added, and the mixture was incubated for 15 min at 37°C. The fluorescence was measured by flow cytometry as described (20Li J. Li P.F. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. Apoptosis. 2002; 6: 511-517Crossref Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting—Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (13Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were lysed for 1 h at 4 °C in a lysis buffer ((mm), 20 Tris (pH 7.5), 2 EDTA, 3 EGTA, 2 dithiothreitol, 250 sucrose, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture). Samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Equal protein loading was controlled by Ponceau red staining of membranes. Blots were probed using antibodies. Determination of CK2 Oxidative Modification—The mice hearts were homogenized in a lysis buffer ((mm), 20 Tris (pH 7.5), 2 EDTA, 3 EGTA, 2 dithiothreitol, 250 sucrose, 0.1 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1% Triton X-100, and a protease inhibitor mixture). The cultured cardiomyocytes were lysed for 1 h at 4°C in the lysis buffer. To perform immunoprecipitation, the lysates were precleared with 10% (v/v) protein A-agarose for 1 h on a rocking platform. Anti-CK2-α antibody was added, and the mixture was rocked for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were captured with 10% (v/v) protein A-agarose for another hour. For the detection of CK2-α protein using immunoblotting, samples were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The membranes were incubated with the anti-CK2-α antibody for 1 h, and then with the horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. After detection of CK2-α protein, the membrane was stripped for the detection of CK2 carbonylation using the method described elsewhere (21Conrad C.C. Talent J.M. Malakowsky C.A. Gracy R.W. Biol. Procedures Online. 2000; 2: 39-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In brief, the membrane was equilibrated in 20% (v/v) methanol, 80% Tris-buffered saline for 5 min, and then incubated with 0.5 mm 2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine for 30 min at room temperature. After washing, the membrane was incubated with the anti-DNP antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence. TRITC-conjugated Phalloidin Staining—Actin filaments were visualized in cultured myocytes using TRITC-conjugated Phalloidin according to the manufacturer's instructions, and imaged using a laser scanning confocal microscope (Zeiss LSM 510 META). Statistical Analysis—The results are expressed as means ± S.E. The statistical comparison among different groups was performed by one-way analysis of variance. Paired data were evaluated by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. ARC Phosphorylation Levels, CK2 Activity, and Catalase Expression Levels Are Reduced in Cardiac Hypertrophy—Angiotensinogen transgenic mice have been shown to develop cardiac hypertrophy (18Kang N. Walther T. Tian X.L. Bohlender J. Fukamizu A. Ganten D. Bader M. J. Mol. Med. 2002; 80: 359-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). We examined the expression and phosphorylation levels of ARC in these mice. As shown in Fig. 1 (A and B), ARC expression levels remained unchanged, whereas its phosphorylation levels were decreased in angiotensinogen transgenic mice. We detected the CK2 activity in these mice, and a reduction in CK2 activity was observed (Fig. 1C). The levels of catalase expression in these mice also were reduced (Fig. 1, D and E). We further analyzed the levels of ARC expression and phosphorylation in cardiomyocytes upon treatment with the hypertrophic stimuli including PE, TNF-α, and Ang II. As shown in Fig. 1F, ARC protein levels were not altered, whereas its phosphorylation levels were reduced. Subsequently, we detected the CK2 activity, and observed a low level of CK2 activity in cardiomyocytes treated with PE, TNF-α, or Ang II (Fig. 1G). The expression levels of catalase were simultaneously reduced (Fig. 1H). Taken together, these data indicate that the levels of ARC phosphorylation, the activity of CK2, and the expression levels of catalase are decreased in the hypertrophic cascades. ARC Is Able to Inhibit Cardiomyocyte Hypertrophy—The reduction in ARC phosphorylation levels in the hypertrophic cascades led us to consider whether there is a relationship between ARC and hypertrophy. To this end, we detected whether ARC could influence cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. The hypertrophic models were set up by employing PE, TNF-α, or Ang II as described elsewhere (9Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar, 11Nakamura K. Fushimi K. Kouchi H. Mihara K. Miyazaki M. Ohe T. Namba M. Circulation. 1998; 98: 794-799Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Hypertrophy is characterized by an enlargement of individual cardiomyocyte, an increase in protein synthesis, and the expression of fetal genes such as ANF. Cardiomyocytes treated with PE (Fig. 2A) or TNF-α (Fig. 2B) showed an increase in cell surface area, which could be attenuated by ARC. ARC also could attenuate the increase in [3H]leucine incorporation (Fig. 2, C and D). 25 nm Ang II-induced hypertrophy could be attenuated by ARC as assessed by cell surface area measurement and [3H]leucine incorporation (data not shown). ANF expression in response to the stimulation with PE, TNF-α, or Ang II could be inhibited by ARC (Fig. 2E). Thus, it appears that ARC is able to antagonize cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Inhibition of Endogenous ARC Sensitizes Cells to Undergoing Hypertrophy—To understand whether endogenous ARC participates in regulating hypertrophy, we detected the susceptibility of cells to undergoing hypertrophy upon ARC knockdown by its antisense oligonucleotides (ARC-AS). Scrambled ARC-AS oligonucleotides and ARC sense oligonucleotides (ARC-S) were used as controls. ARC-AS was able to induce a reduction in ARC levels (Fig. 3A). Treatment of cells with a low dose of PE (0.1 μm) or TNF-α (2 ng/ml) could not lead to a significant increase in [3H]leucine incorporation. In contrast, a significant increase in [3H]leucine incorporation could be observed in cells pretreated with ARC-AS and then treated with the same doses of PE (Fig. 3B) or TNF-α (Fig. 3C). Thus, it appears that the endogenous ARC participates in the control of hypertrophy in response to the pathological insults. The Anti-hypertrophic Effect of ARC Depends on Its Thr-149 Phosphorylation—Because of the reduction in ARC phosphorylation levels in the hypertrophic pathway as shown in Fig. 1 (B and F), we tested whether ARC requires Thr-149 phosphorylation for its anti-hypertrophic function. To this end, we first compared the effect of phosphorylatable wtARC and nonphosphorylatable ARC149A on cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Sarcomere organization is a dominant marker of hypertrophy in the cultured cardiomyocytes. As shown in Fig. 4A, PE could lead to sarcomere organization that was blocked by wtARC but not ARC149A. Next, we tested whether ARC149D could functionally mimic phosphorylation. ARC149D but not ARC149A was able to inhibit hypertrophy (Fig. 4B). We finally detected whether endogenous ARC depends on phosphorylation in controlling hypertrophy. Because ARC is phosphorylated by CK2 (13Li P.F. Li J. Muller E.C. Otto A. Dietz R. Harsdorf von R. Mol. Cell. 2002; 10: 247-258Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), we employed TBB, a relative specific inhibitor of CK2 (22Loizou J.I. El-Khamisy S.F. Zlatanou A. Moore D.J. Chan D.W. Qin J. Sarno S. Meggio F. Pinna L.A. Caldecott K.W. Cell. 2004; 117: 17-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar), to inhibit the phosphorylation of endogenous ARC. Cells with a low phosphorylation level of ARC underwent hypertrophy upon stimulation with a low dose of PE (Fig. 4C) or TNF-α (Fig. 4D). These results indicated that inhibition of endogenous ARC phosphorylation results in an increased susceptibility of cells to undergoing hypertrophy. Taken together, our results suggest the necessity of Thr-149 phosphorylation for ARC to exert its anti-hypertrophic effect. Oxidative Modification Is Responsible for the Decrease in CK2 Activity—Due to the necessity of Thr-149 phosphorylation for the anti-hypertrophic effect of ARC and the responsibility of CK2 for ARC phosphorylation, we explored the mechanism by which CK2 activity is decreased in the hypertrophic cascades as shown in Fig. 1 (C and G). PE, TNF-α, or Ang II are able to induce ROS production in cardiomyocytes (9Hirotani S. Otsu K. Nishida K. Higuchi Y. Morita T. Nakayama H. Yamaguchi O. Mano T. Matsumura Y. Ueno H. Tada M. Hori M. Circulation. 2002; 105: 509-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). ROS can oxidatively modify proteins resulting in the loss of their functions (23Stadtman E.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2001; 928: 22-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). This led us to test whether CK2 could be oxidatively modified by ROS. Carbonylation is a marker for the oxidative modification of proteins (24Grune T. Merker K. Jung T. Sitte N. Davies K.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 39: 1208-1215Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We analyzed the carbonylation of CK2 in the hearts of angiotensinogen transgenic mice and in cardiomyocytes treated with TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 5A, carbonylation of CK2 could be observed in the hearts of angiotensinogen transgenic mice. CK2 carbonylation could be detected in cells treated with TNF-α. The antioxidants, N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) or pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC), could attenuate CK2 carbonylation (Fig. 5B). Thus, CK2 is oxidatively modified in hypertrophy. We asked whether the oxidative modification can lead to the loss of CK2 catalytic activity. To address this question, we firstly detected the catalytic activity of CK2 in cells treated with TNF-α in the absence or presence of antioxidants. As shown in Fig. 5C, the administration of NAC and PDTC could block the decrease in CK2 activity. Concomitantly, NAC and PDTC could inhibit TNF-α-induced hypertrophic responses as analyzed by cell surface area measurement (data not shown). We next analyzed whether the oxidative modification could directly alter CK2 activity. Hydrogen peroxide in the absence but not presence of catalase led to a reduction in CK2 activity (Fig. 5D). Taken together, these data suggest that the oxidative modification may be responsible for the loss of CK2 activity in the hypertrophic pathway. Knockdown of Catalase Leads to CK2 Oxidative Modification and a Reduction in ARC Phosphorylation Levels—The simultaneous occurrences of the decreases in catalase expression, CK2 activity, and ARC phosphorylation levels in hypertrophy as shown in Fig. 1 led us to consider whether these events are causally linked with each other. We detected the status of CK2 carbonylation and ARC phosphorylation upon catalase knockdown. We used a low dose of catalase RNAi to avoid the occurrence of apoptosis. Treatment of cells with catalase RNAi but not its scrambled form (catalase-S-RNAi) resulted in the carbonylation of CK2 (Fig. 6A) and a reduction in ARC phosphorylation levels (Fig. 6B). Concomitantly, hypertrophy could be observed upon catalase knockdown (Fig. 6C). Thus, the decrease in catalase expression can lead to CK2-oxidative modification and a reduction in ARC phosphorylation levels. Catalase Can Maintain ARC Phosphorylation Levels and Attenuate Hypertrophy—We subsequently tested whether catalase could influence ARC phosphorylation status in response to hypertrophic stimuli. Enforced expression of catalase could attenuate the reduction in ARC phosphorylation levels upon treatment with PE, TNF-α, or Ang II (Fig. 7A). Concomitantly, the increase in ROS levels (Fig. 7B) and hypertrophy (Fig. 7C) were attenuated by enforced expression of catalase. c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38"
https://openalex.org/W1979179771,"This work demonstrates how increased activity of copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) paradoxically boosts production of toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the intermembrane space (IMS) of mitochondria. Even though SOD1 is a cytosolic enzyme, a fraction of it is found in the IMS, where it is thought to provide protection against oxidative damage. We found that SOD1 controls cytochrome c-catalyzed peroxidation in vitro when superoxide is available. The presence of SOD1 significantly increased the rate of ROS production in mitoplasts, which are devoid of outer membrane and IMS. In response to inhibition of respiration with antimycin A, isolated mouse wild-type mitochondria increased ROS production, but the mitochondria from mice lacking SOD1 (SOD1-/-) did not. Also, lymphocytes isolated from SOD1-/- mice produced significantly less ROS than did wild-type cells and were more resistant to apoptosis induced by inhibition of respiration. Moreover, an increased amount of the toxic mutant G93A SOD1 in the IMS increased ROS production. The mitochondrial dysfunction and cell damage paradoxically induced by SOD1-mediated ROS production may be implicated in chronic degenerative diseases.

In response to inhibition of respiration with antimycin A, isolated mouse wild-type mitochondria increased ROS production, but the mitochondria from mice lacking SOD1 (SOD1-/-) did not. Also, lymphocytes isolated from SOD1-/- mice produced significantly less ROS than did wild-type cells and were more resistant to apoptosis induced by inhibition of respiration. Moreover, an increased amount of the toxic mutant G93A SOD1 in the IMS increased ROS production. The mitochondrial dysfunction and cell damage paradoxically induced by SOD1-mediated ROS production may be implicated in chronic degenerative diseases. Mitochondria are the major intracellular source of superoxide, the primary reactive oxygen species (ROS). 4The abbreviations used are:ROSreactive oxygen speciesSOD1copper-zinc superoxide dismutaseSOD2manganese superoxide dismutaseIMSintermembrane spaceDCF2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateTEMEDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamineALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosis. 4The abbreviations used are:ROSreactive oxygen speciesSOD1copper-zinc superoxide dismutaseSOD2manganese superoxide dismutaseIMSintermembrane spaceDCF2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetateTEMEDN,N,N′,N′-tetramethylethylenediamineALSamyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Superoxide anion radical is generated by one-electron reduction of oxygen. The two major pathways of superoxide production in mitochondria are autoxidation or complex III-catalyzed oxidation of ubisemiquinone (1Muller F.L. Liu Y. van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar) and complex I-catalyzed reduction through reversed electron flow upon the respiratory chain (2Liu Y. Fiskum G. Schubert D. J. Neurochem. 2002; 80: 780-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (959) Google Scholar). Despite its name, superoxide is not a superoxidant but rather a strong nucleophile and weak reductant, with the ability to actively react with a number of cellular targets. Instead of reverse oxidation of superoxide to oxygen, the detoxifying mechanism for superoxide includes dismutation to hydroperoxide and oxygen. There are three dedicated enzymes catalyzing this dismutation reaction: copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), which is localized mainly in the cytosol; manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2), which is found in the mitochondrial matrix; and extracellular superoxide dismutase (SOD3) (3Zelko I.N. Mariani T.J. Folz R.J. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 337-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (1554) Google Scholar).Unlike hydroperoxide, which freely diffuses through the membranes, superoxide cannot cross the mitochondrial inner membrane. In the matrix, SOD2 converts superoxide to hydroperoxide, which in turn is reduced to water by the matrix glutathione peroxidase (4Inoue M. Sato E.F. Nishikawa M. Park A.M. Kira Y. Imada I. Utsumi K. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 2495-2505Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In the mitochondrial intermembrane space (IMS), superoxide is produced presumably by complex III (1Muller F.L. Liu Y. van Remmen H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 49064-49073Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (757) Google Scholar). The fate of superoxide in this compartment is expected to be determined by SOD1 and cytochrome c, which is present in millimolar concentrations (5van Beek-Harmsen B.J. van der Laarse W.J. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2005; 53: 803-807Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Forman H.J. Azzi A. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 374-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Recently, cytosolic SOD1 was demonstrated in the yeast (7Sturtz L.A. Diekert K. Jensen L.T. Lill R. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 38084-38089Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (8Inarrea P. Moini H. Rettori D. Han D. Martinez J. Garcia I. Fernandez-Vizarra E. Iturralde M. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) IMS, where it has been suggested to be an important part of the mitochondrial superoxide-scavenging system by detoxification of ROS. Cytochrome c is a heme-containing protein that functions as an electron carrier between complex III and cytochrome oxidase in the respiratory chain. Cytochrome c can also efficiently oxidize superoxide to oxygen. In this respect, cytochrome c functions as a true antioxidant, scavenging superoxide without production of secondary ROS (9Pereverzev M.O. Vygodina T.V. Konstantinov A.A. Skulachev V.P. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 1312-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).However, cytochrome c also has the potential to catalyze oxidation by hydroperoxide. Notably, hydroperoxide oxidizes the prosthetic heme in the cytochrome c molecule to oxoferryl heme, forming the so-called peroxidase compound I-type intermediate, a highly reactive oxidant that is able to react with a number of intracellular targets, including proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids, causing cell damage (10Lawrence A. Jones C.M. Wardman P. Burkitt M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29410-29419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c peroxidase activity is controlled by the coordination state of heme iron, particularly by the sulfur ligand of Met-80, which can be easily displaced by hydroperoxide (11Qian S.Y.

Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15498-15503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The peroxidase activity of cytochrome c is increased by unfolding and post-translational modifications such as proteolytic cleavage, nitration, and oxidation (13Diederix R.E. Ubbink M. Canters G.W. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 13067-13077Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 14Jang B. Han S. Biochimie (Paris). 2006; 88: 53-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 15Everse J. Coates P.W. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2005; 38: 1296-1310Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar).We hypothesized that, upon mitochondrial stress, SOD1 might compete with cytochrome c for superoxide in the IMS and generate hydroperoxide, which then could react with cytochrome c and form the peroxidase compound I-type intermediate, eventually leading to a paradoxical increase in ROS production and cell injury (Fig. 1). Our results demonstrate how the presence of SOD1 activity in the IMS causes paradoxically augmented ROS production upon mitochondrial stress. Understanding the deleterious role of SOD1 in the mitochondrial IMS sheds light on cell death mechanisms of diseases in which mitochondrial pathology is implicated, including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESAnimals—The experiments were conducted according to the Council of Europe (Directive 86/609) and Finnish guidelines and approved by the State Provincial Office of Eastern Finland. 8-week-old male C57BL mice were decapitated under carbon dioxide anesthesia, and mitochondria from liver tissues were isolated. SOD1 knock-out (SOD1-/-) mice with a 129/CD1 background were bred with the CD1 strain of mice for at least eight generations. G93A SOD1 transgenic mice (B6.Cg-Tg-(SOD1-G93A)1Gur/J, The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME) carrying a high copy number of the human mutant G93A SOD1 were killed at 8 weeks of age.Isolation of Mitochondria—The liver tissue was homogenized using an all-glass Dounce homogenizer (Kontes) in ice-cold isolation buffer (320 mm sucrose, 1 mm EGTA, and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4). The homogenate was centrifuged for 3 min at 2000 × g, and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 × g. The resulting supernatant was discarded, and the pellet-containing mitochondrial fraction was washed once with wash buffer (0.2 m sucrose, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 0.1 mm EGTA, and 4 mm KH2PO4) and resuspended in the same buffer to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml. The protein concentrations were determined using Bio-Rad protein assay dye. For the ROS production studies, mitochondria were resuspended to a protein concentration of 10 mg/ml in standard medium (0.3 m mannitol, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm KH2PO4, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4). The purity of the mitochondrial fraction obtained was assessed by Western blotting (supplemental Fig. 1). The intactness and functional integrity of the isolated mitochondria were confirmed by measuring mitochondrial membrane potential with JC-1 dye (5,5′,6,6′-tetrachloro-1,1′,3,3′-tetraethylbenzimidazolylcarbocyanine iodide) and mitochondrial respiration with an oxygraph method (supplemental Fig. 2).Isolation of Mitoplasts—To obtain mitoplasts, mitochondria were incubated with 5× volume of cold hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) for 10 min on ice. After 10 min, 150 mm NaCl was added, and mitoplasts were incubated for 10 min on ice and centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Mitoplasts were washed and resuspended back to the original volume in standard medium.Measurements of Mitochondrial ROS Production—Measurements were carried out in 96-well plates by mixing 20 μl of mitochondrial suspension (containing 150 μg of mitochondrial protein) with 140 μl of standard medium and adding substrate mixture to final concentrations of 1.3 mm succinate and 10 μm 2,7-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCF) (Fluka). Antimycin A (at a 3 μm final concentration; Sigma) was added in experiments in which respiratory chain complex III was inhibited. Oxidized DCF fluorescence was recorded with a VICTOR multilabel reader (Wallac). The DCF oxidation rate in the absence of mitochondria was also measured, and even though the reagents (especially SOD1 and cytochrome c) increased the DCF oxidation rate in the absence of mitochondria, the rate was only up to 10% of the rate measured in the presence of mitochondria (supplemental Fig. 3). All samples were run in triplicates.Measurements of Cytochrome c-catalyzed Peroxidation—To study the role of SOD1 in cytochrome c-catalyzed DCF oxidation in the presence of a superoxide source, 15 μl of xanthine oxidase suspension (diluted 1:100 in 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8; Sigma) was mixed with xanthine solution to a 0.4 mm final concentration and complemented with 10 μm DCF. The total volume of the reaction mixture was 200 μl. DCF oxidation was recorded using the VICTOR multilabel reader. The fluorescence kinetics was recorded in the presence of 10 μm cytochrome c (Sigma) and together with purified human erythrocyte SOD1 (15, 30, 60, and 250 nm). Human SOD1 was isolated from erythrocytes by fractionated precipitation and DEAE ion exchange chromatography (16Yoo H.Y. Kim S.S. Rho H.M. J. Biotechnol. 1999; 68: 29-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The purity and identity of isolated SOD1 were confirmed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting. All samples were run in triplicates.IMS Isolation and Measurement of SOD1 Activity—SOD1 activity was measured in the mitochondrial IMS preparation (obtained in the presence of iodoacetamide) by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay and was expressed as a percentage of activated enzyme in the absence of iodoacetamide. To isolate the contents of the IMS, mitochondria (10 mg/ml) were treated with 0.1 mg of digitonin/mg of mitochondria for 1 h at room temperature. 100 mm iodoacetamide was added to samples to prevent SOD1 activation upon disruption of the outer membrane. After centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was assayed for SOD activity as quenching of nitro blue tetrazolium reduction by xanthine oxidase/xanthine reaction-generated superoxide anion radical (17Oberley L.W. Spitz D.R. Methods Enzymol. 1984; 105: 457-464Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar, 18Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9655) Google Scholar). SOD1 activity was measured in the mitochondrial IMS preparation (obtained in the presence of iodoacetamide) and was expressed as a percentage of activated enzyme in the absence of iodoacetamide (8Inarrea P. Moini H. Rettori D. Han D. Martinez J. Garcia I. Fernandez-Vizarra E. Iturralde M. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar).Kinetics of DCF Oxidation by Isolated Mitoplasts—ROS production by mitoplasts was measured in the presence of 1.3 mm succinate, 10 μm DCF, 3 μm antimycin A, and 10 μm cytochrome c as described above for ROS production by mitochondria. 100 nm purified human erythrocyte SOD1 was added to study the effect of SOD1 on ROS production.Flow Cytometry—Peroxide production in mouse blood lymphocytes in the presence of 3 μm antimycin A loaded with 10 μm DCF was analyzed by flow cytometry (FL1 - DCF fluorescence). Mouse (wild-type and SOD1-/-) blood lymphocytes were isolated by differential centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lymphocytes were washed and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 10 μm DCF. 10 min later, 3 μm antimycin A was added, and the samples were immediately analyzed using a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) at 30- and 90-min time points. 10,000 cells were counted altogether.The kinetics of antimycin A-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes was measured by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate binding. Mouse (wild-type and SOD1-/-) blood lymphocytes were isolated by differential centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque PLUS according to the manufacturer's instructions. Lymphocytes were washed and suspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution containing 20 μm antimycin A. Untreated cells and antimycin A-treated lymphocytes after 30, 60, and 90 min were sedimented by centrifugation and resuspended in binding buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 140 mm NaCl, and 2.5 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4. Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) was added to a final concentration of 0.45 μg/ml, and after incubation for 10 min, propidium iodide was added to a final concentration of 2 μg/ml. After another 10-min incubation, the samples were analyzed using the FACSCalibur flow cytometer. 10,000 cells were counted altogether.Zymography—SOD activity in the IMS preparations was assessed as described (18Beauchamp C. Fridovich I. Anal. Biochem. 1971; 44: 276-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (9655) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 μl of each sample (containing 0.2 μg/μl total protein) was loaded onto a 10% native polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis, the gels were washed with 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.8, for 10 min and then incubated in 1 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium solution in the same buffer for 15 min. After incubation, the gels were briefly washed with phosphate buffer and incubated in 0.25% TEMED solution containing 30 μm riboflavin for 15 min. The gels were rinsed in phosphate buffer and illuminated for 15 min with a fluorescent light source. SOD activity appeared as clear bands on a blue background. The gels were scanned with a Gel Doc scanner (Bio-Rad), and the bands were quantified with Image-Quant software (GE Healthcare). In case of mitoplast analysis, equal loading was assured by equal SOD2 activity bands. Samples were run in triplicates.Statistical Analyses—Results are shown as the means ± S.D. Differences between groups were determined by Student's t test. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.RESULTSSOD1 Controls Mitochondrial Hydroperoxide Production, and Its Substrate Oxidation Is Dependent on Cytochrome c—The isolated mouse liver mitochondria contained a considerable amount of SOD1. When analyzing the distribution of SOD1 in different subcellular fractions, the SOD1 concentration in the mitochondria was ∼30% (per unit of total protein) of the cytosolic SOD1 concentration. Within mitochondria, the SOD1 concentration was about six times higher in the IMS fraction than in the mitoplast fraction (supplemental Fig. 4). To investigate whether SOD activity in the IMS contributes to hydroperoxide production, mitochondria respiring in the presence of succinate were challenged with antimycin A, an inhibitor of complex III. Antimycin A has been shown previously to cause prompt superoxide production as determined by EPR (19Han D. Antunes F. Canali R. Rettori D. Cadenas E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5557-5563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). SOD activity in an IMS preparation was rapidly increased as a function of time in response to antimycin A (Fig. 2A). Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration also resulted in increased hydroperoxide production as determined in parallel by measurement of the fluorescence of DCF, a widely used hydroperoxide-sensitive probe (20Hempel S.L. Buettner G.R. O'Malley Y.Q. Wessels D.A. Flaherty D.M. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1999; 27: 146-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (640) Google Scholar). DCF is strongly oxidized to a fluorescent derivative in the presence of heme-containing catalysts such as cytochrome c (10Lawrence A. Jones C.M. Wardman P. Burkitt M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29410-29419Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In parallel, the hydroperoxide produced by mitochondria was measured using a luminol/horse-radish peroxidase assay and found to linearly correlate with the amount of mitochondrial proteins (supplemental Fig. 5). The possibility that DCF could also be oxidized by peroxynitrite after reaction of superoxide with nitric oxide was ruled out because inhibition of nitric-oxide synthase by Nω-nitro-l-arginine did not alter the DCF fluorescence rate (supplemental Fig. 6). The monitored fluorescence is thus a measure of the relative oxidative damage to cell constituents. An increase in DCF fluorescence was observed after a lag period in respiring isolated mitochondria. The lag period was remarkably shortened by antimycin A (Fig. 2C), and the response coincided with the maximal increase in SOD activity. In agreement with a previous study (8Inarrea P. Moini H. Rettori D. Han D. Martinez J. Garcia I. Fernandez-Vizarra E. Iturralde M. Cadenas E. Biochem. J. 2005; 387: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar), these kinetics of hydroperoxide production and SOD1 activity suggest a redox control of the dismutase activity in the IMS. SOD1 was essential for the increased hydroperoxide production because adding the SOD1 inhibitor ammonium tetrathiomolybdate or ammonium diethyldithiocarbamate significantly and dose-dependently reduced DCF fluorescence in isolated mitochondria (Fig. 2B and supplemental Fig. 7).FIGURE 2SOD1 in the IMS controls cytochrome c-catalyzed peroxidation. A, the burst of hydroperoxide production in wild-type mitochondria (▪) coincides with the peak of SOD1 activity in the IMS (▴). SOD1 activity was measured in the mitochondrial IMS preparation (obtained in the presence of iodoacetamide) by nitro blue tetrazolium reduction assay and is expressed as a percentage of fully activated enzyme in the absence of iodoacetamide. RU, response unit. B, inhibition of SOD1 activity reduces mitochondrial hydroperoxide production. Mitochondrial hydroperoxide production by mitochondria isolated from the livers of C57BL male mice was measured in the presence of 0, 10, and 50 μm tetrathiomolybdate (TTM). C, mitochondrial hydroperoxide production measured as DCF oxidation in wild-type and SOD1-/- mitochondria. In wild-type mitochondria (wt; •), hydroperoxide production was accelerated by antimycin A (AA; ▪). In contrast, SOD1-/- mitochondria (knock-out (ko); ▾) did not respond to antimycin A (▴) and produced significantly less hydroperoxide. D, rate of DCF oxidation by isolated mouse liver mitoplasts in the presence of 10 μm cytochrome c and upon addition of 100 nm SOD1. Addition of SOD1 caused a significant increase in the hydroperoxide production rate (p = 0.007). In the absence of cytochrome c, SOD1 only slightly increased the DCF oxidation rate. E, SOD1 controls cytochrome c-catalyzed peroxidation in vitro in a concentration-dependent manner. Slow DCF oxidation by superoxide (generated by xanthine oxidase (XO)/xanthine; ◂) was slightly enhanced by 5 μm cytochrome c ((CytC); ♦). SOD1 at 15 nm (▾), 30 nm (▴), 60 nm (•), and 250 nm (▪) significantly increased the rate of DCF oxidation. Cntr, control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)These results led us to the paradoxical hypothesis that mitochondria lacking SOD1 should produce less hydroperoxide when stressed by inhibition of respiration, resulting in lower cytochrome c-catalyzed DCF oxidation. To test this hypothesis, we isolated intact mitochondria from wild-type and SOD1-/- mice. Mitochondrial peroxide production was measured again by DCF oxidation in the presence and absence of antimycin A. Indeed, the mitochondria isolated from SOD1-deficient (SOD1-/-) mice produced substantially less DCF fluorescence and did not show any response to inhibition of complex III by antimycin A (Fig. 2C).These results indicate that, upon inhibition of mitochondrial respiration, elevated SOD1 activity is responsible for increased hydroperoxide production in the IMS, resulting in cytochrome c-catalyzed DCF oxidation. To test this hypothesis further, we used mitoplasts, e.g. mitochondria devoid of outer membrane and IMS, to reconstitute conditions for hydroperoxide production. No significant DCF oxidation could be detected in respiring mitoplasts even after inhibition of complex III by antimycin A (Fig. 2D). Addition of cytochrome c caused an increase in DCF fluorescence, possibly because of the reconstituted respiration and hydroperoxide escaping from the mitochondrial matrix. Notably, addition of 100 nm SOD1 more than doubled the rate of DCF oxidation in the presence of cytochrome c (Fig. 2D).To model the interaction of superoxide, cytochrome c, and SOD1 in the IMS, we reconstituted a reaction in which superoxide was generated through xanthine oxidase/xanthine. A slow oxidation of DCF occurred in the presence of this enzyme substrate pair. The rate of DCF oxidation was slightly elevated by 5 μm cytochrome c (Fig. 2E). However, addition of increasing concentrations of SOD1 to the reaction mixture strongly and dose-dependently increased the rate of DCF oxidation, indicating that SOD1 significantly enhances cytochrome c-catalyzed peroxidation. The effect of SOD1 was hydroperoxide-dependent because addition of 5 units/ml catalase completely abolished it (supplemental Fig. 8).SOD1 Increases Mitochondrial Peroxide Production in Lymphocytes and Contributes to Apoptosis—To investigate whether SOD1 also controls hydroperoxide production in the IMS of intact cells, we isolated lymphocytes from wild-type and SOD1-/- mouse blood by differential centrifugation and loaded them with DCF before adding antimycin A. As shown in Fig. 3 (A and B), flow cytometric analysis showed that antimycin A-induced DCF oxidation was attenuated in SOD1-/- lymphocytes at 90 min of incubation compared with hydroperoxide production in wild-type lymphocytes. The difference in hydroperoxide production was confirmed to be statistically significant by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.FIGURE 3SOD1-/- lymphocytes produce less ROS and are more resistant to antimycin A-induced apoptosis. A, flow cytometric analysis of peroxide production in mice blood lymphocytes in the presence of 3 μm antimycin A loaded with 10 μm DCF (FL1 - DCF fluorescence). B, SOD1-/- lymphocytes produce significantly less hydroperoxide after 90 min of incubation than do wild-type (wt) lymphocytes (confirmed by the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). 10,000 cells were counted altogether. C, kinetics of antimycin A-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes measured by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate binding. D, after 90 min of incubation in the presence of 20 μm antimycin A, SOD1-/- lymphocytes show only 30% apoptotic cells as measured by annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate binding, in contrast to 55% for wild-type lymphocytes. RU, response unit.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In addition to increased superoxide production in mitochondria, inhibition of complex III by antimycin A has also been shown to induce apoptosis (21Wolvetang E.J. Johnson K.L. Krauer K. Ralph S.J. Linnane A.W. FEBS Lett. 1994; 339: 40-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (378) Google Scholar). To test whether SOD1 activity is important for apoptosis, SOD1-/- and wild-type lymphocytes were challenged with antimycin A for 90 min, and apoptosis was determined by annexin V binding using flow cytometry. SOD1-/- lymphocytes showed significantly less apoptosis than did wild-type lymphocytes (Fig. 3(C and D) and supplemental Fig. 9).Increased SOD1 Activity Associated with G93A SOD1 in Spinal Cord Mitoplasts Leads to Elevated ROS Production—Mutations in SOD1 are known to cause the familial form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (22Rosen D.R. Siddique T. Patterson D. Figlewicz D.A. Sapp P. Hentati A. Donaldson D. Goto J. O'Regan J.P. Deng H.X. Rahmani Z. Krizus A. McKenna-Yasek D. Cayabyab A. Gaston S.M. Nature. 1993; 362: 59-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (5443) Google Scholar), a disease characterized by loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord, leading to muscle atrophy, paralysis of voluntary muscles, and death in 3-5 years (23Mulder D.W. Kurland L.T. Offord K.P. Beard C.M. Neurology. 1986; 36: 511-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar). Although the nature of the toxic gain of function in mutant SOD1 has not been identified, it is believed that altered generation of free radical and ROS is a leading contributor to the destruction of motor neurons. The most recent studies of familial ALS animal models indicate that mutant SOD1 causes selective mitochondrial dysfunction, resulting in increased ROS production. We hypothesized that the increased amount of SOD1 may be associated with SOD1 activity in the mitochondrial IMS and thereby boost ROS production.Thus, we studied mitochondrial SOD1 activity in transgenic mice expressing mutant G93A SOD1, a model of familial ALS (24Tu P.H.

The SOD1 mutant accumulates in mitochondria of the spinal cord, where it is associated with the inner membrane (25Liu J. Lillo C. Jonsson P.A. Vande Velde C. Ward C.M. Miller T.M. Subramaniam J.R.

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. 2006; 7: 22-24PubMed Google Scholar). The spinal cord is also the most affected tissue in ALS. The SOD1 activity of IMS preparations from the spinal cord was 6-fold greater in the G93A SOD1 mice than in the wild-type mice (Fig. 4, A and D). In addition, IMS SOD1 activity in the spinal cord was clearly higher in comparison with non-affected brain tissues of the same animals (Fig. 4, B and E). The SOD1 activity of the mitoplast preparations isolated from the transgenic spinal cord was twice as high as that from the transgenic brain (Fig. 4, C and F). To investigate whether the elevated activity and accumulation of mutant G93A SOD1 in mitoplasts result in increased ROS production, we measured DCF oxidation in the mitoplast preparations in the presence of cytochrome c. We found that the mitoplasts isolated from the transgenic spinal cord produced significantly more DCF fluorescence compared with the mitoplasts derived fro"
https://openalex.org/W1992938908,"The fully executed epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/Ras/MEK/ERK pathway serves a pro-survival role in renal epithelia under moderate oxidative stress. We and others have demonstrated that during severe oxidative stress, however, the activated EGFR is disconnected from ERK activation in cultured renal proximal tubule cells and also in renal proximal tubules after ischemia/reperfusion injury, resulting in necrotic death. Studies have shown that the tyrosine-phosphorylated p46/52 isoforms of the ShcA family of adaptor proteins connect the activated EGFR to activation of Ras and ERK, whereas the p66shc isoform can inhibit this p46/52shc function. Here, we determined that severe oxidative stress (after a brief period of activation) terminates activation of the Ras/MEK/ERK pathway, which coincides with ERK/JNK-dependent Ser36 phosphorylation of p66shc. Isoform-specific knockdown of p66shc or mutation of Ser36 to Ala, but not to Asp, attenuated severe oxidative stress-mediated ERK inhibition and cell death in vitro. Also, severe oxidative stress (unlike ligand stimulation and moderate oxidative stress, both of which support survival) increased binding of p66shc to the activated EGFR and Grb2. This binding dissociated the SOS1 adaptor protein from the EGFR-recruited signaling complex, leading to termination of Ras/MEK/ERK activation. Notably, Ser36 phosphorylation of p66shc and its increased binding to the EGFR also occurred in the kidney after ischemia/reperfusion injury in vivo. At the same time, SOS1 binding to the EGFR declined, similar to the in vitro findings. Thus, the mechanism we propose in vitro offers a means to ameliorate oxidative stress-induced cell injury by either inhibiting Ser36 phosphorylation of p66shc or knocking down p66shc expression in vivo."

These differentiated neuronal cells exhibit characteristic electrophysiological properties and elevated levels of the neuronal differentiation marker, growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43). To explore possible signaling pathways, we first analyzed the expression of various FGF receptors in mouse BMSCs. FGF receptor-1, -2, and -3 were detected, but only FGFR-1 was shown to be activated by bFGF. Small interfering RNA knock down of FGFR-1 in BMSCs significantly inhibited neuronal differentiation. Moreover, we have shown that the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) is persistently activated and blockage of ERK activity with the ERK-specific inhibitor U0126 prevents neuronal differentiation. It appears that activation of ERK cascade and neuronal differentiation of BMSCs induced by bFGF are independent of Ras activity but require functions of phospholipase C-γ pathway. Lastly, we examined the role of the immediate-early transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB and have found that phospholipase C-γ-dependent c-Jun and ERK-dependent c-fos, but not the NF-κB, are strongly activated by bFGF, which in turn regulates the neuronal differentiation of BMSCs. It has been reported recently that bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are able to differentiate into various neural cells both in vivo and in vitro (Egusa, H., Schweizer, F. E., Wang, C. C., Matsuka, Y., and Nishimura, I. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 23691–23697). However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown.

Allen T.D. Lajtha L.G. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 91: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Recent studies have demonstrated that BMSCs can be induced to generate not only the progenies of mesodermal lineages, such as adipocytes, chondrocytes, and myogenic cells, but also cells from different germ layers, such as neuronal cells (2Prockop D.J. Science. 1997; 276: 71-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (4116) Google Scholar, 3Pittenger M.F. Mackay A.M. Beck S.C. Jaiswal R.K. Douglas R. Mosca J.D. Moorman M.A. Simonetti D.W. Craig S. Marshak D.R.

Du J. Aldrich S. Lisberg A. Low W.C. Largaespada D.A. Verfaillie C.M. Nature. 2002; 418: 41-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (5142) Google Scholar). These neurogenic capacities of BMSCs have attracted tremendous attention because of their great potential as donor cells for cell supplementary therapy of neuronal disorders, with the advantages of fewer ethical concerns and less immune rejection (5Sanchez-ramos J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 880-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 6Corti S. Locatelli F. Papadimitriou D. Strazzer S. Comi G.P. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2004; 8: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the neuronal differentiation of BMSCs are not clear and the “transdifferentiation” hypothesis (7Lu P. Blesch A. Tuszynski M.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 174-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar) between different germ layers is yet to be proven with more solid data. A recent challenge indicated that such neuronal differentiation was attributed to the stress response of BMSCs to the chemicals used in neuronal differentiation protocols (8Jin K. Greenberg D.A. Exp. Neurol. 2003; 183: 255-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). It will be therefore worthwhile to study neuronal differentiation of BMSCs under physiological conditions and elucidate the relevant signaling pathways and nuclear events. bone marrow stromal cell basic fibroblast growth factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase FGF receptor FGF receptor substrate 2 c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase phospholipase C-γ small interfering RNA. bone marrow stromal cell basic fibroblast growth factor extracellular signal-regulated kinase FGF receptor FGF receptor substrate 2 c-Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase phospholipase C-γ small interfering RNA. The basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was the first to be used in studies elucidating the neuronal differentiation of BMSCs (9Woodbury D. Schwarz E.J. Prockop D.J. Black I.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar). bFGF has a wide range of biological effects on cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Recent studies revealed the neurogenic function of bFGF in animals (10Doniach T. Cell. 1995; 83: 1067-1070Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) and the induction of neuronal tube formation from embryonic stem cells by bFGF in vitro (11Chiba S. Kurokawa M.S. Yoshikawa H. Ikeda R. Takeno M. Tadokoro M. Sekino H. Hashimoto T. Suzuki N. Exp. Brain Res. 2005; 163: 86-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). More interestingly, cells from non-neuronal origin can also be induced by bFGF to adopt neuronal phenotypes, such as neuronal transdifferentiation of retina epithelium (12Pittack C. Jones M. Reh T.A. Development (Camb.). 1991; 113: 577-588Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and BMSCs (9Woodbury D. Schwarz E.J. Prockop D.J. Black I.B. J. Neurosci. Res. 2000; 61: 364-370Crossref PubMed Scopus (2466) Google Scholar), indicating its potent neuronal-inductive effects. The function of bFGF is achieved by binding to the fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs). There are at least four structurally related high affinity FGFRs that are expressed differentially in various tissues and cell types (13Eswarakumar V.P. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2005; 16: 139-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1477) Google Scholar). The affinity of bFGF with various FGFRs is different, and the downstream signaling pathways of different FGFRs are also varied (14Wang J.K. Gao G. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), although the signaling domains of FGFRs are highly conserved. Several signaling pathways can be activated by FGFRs, such as the cascades of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), Src, Crk, and SNT-1/FRS2 (15Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), some of which are implicated in bFGF-induced neurogenesis and differentiation (16Reuss B. von Bohlen und Halbach O. Cell Tissue Res. 2003; 313: 139-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). A recent study demonstrated that the MAPK/ERK cascade, an important target for the SNT-1/FRS2 signaling pathway, plays a crucial role in mediating the neurotrophic effect of bFGF (17Abe K. Saito H. Brain Res. Dev. Brain Res. 2000; 122: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Activated ERK kinase was also found to induce the neuronal transdifferentiation of retinal pigment cells (18Galy A. Neron B. Planque N. Saule S. Eychene A. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). These findings suggest a central role of ERK in the neuronal induction by bFGF. However, whether ERK is involved in bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation of BMSCs needs to be clarified. Neuronal differentiation is a complex process involving many molecules, some of which need to be newly transcribed and translated (19Ma Q. J. Physiol. 2006; 575: 379-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). It has been well established that the activated ERK induced by bFGF can be translocated into the nucleus and activate transcription factors (20Davis R.J. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1995; 42: 459-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Both bFGF and ERK can activate the immediate-early transcription factors AP-1 and NF-κB (21Whitmarsh A.J. Davis R.J. J. Mol. Med. 1996; 74: 589-607Crossref PubMed Scopus (1383) Google Scholar, 22Woodgett J.R. Pulverer B.J. Plyte S. Hughes K. Nikolakaki E. Pigment Cell Res. 1994; 7: 96-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), which in turn regulate neuronal differentiation (23Feng Z. Porter A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30341-30344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 24Leppa S. Eriksson M. Saffrich R. Ansorge W. Bohmann D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 4369-4378Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). For instance, in BMSCs the DNA binding activity of AP-1 was greatly induced by cytokines (25Xu Y.X. Pindolia K.R. Janakiraman N. Chapman R.A. Gautam S.C. Hematopathol. Mol. Hematol. 1997–1998; 11: 49-62PubMed Google Scholar) and NF-κB was shown to be activated during neuronal differentiation (26Yang Q. Jia Y.J. Yang J. Zhongguo Zhong Xi Yi Jie He Za Zhi. 2005; 25: 248-251PubMed Google Scholar). However, the exact functions of these factors in bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation of BMSCs have not been documented. In this study, we demonstrated that bFGF effectively induces neuronal differentiation of mouse BMSCs and that FGFR-1 is the main FGF receptor recognized and activated by bFGF. The signal transduction evoked by bFGF/FGFR-1 in BMSCs is mainly mediated by MAPK/ERK, which is downstream of PLC-γ activation. We further show that it is AP-1, but not NF-κB, that is activated and required for bFGF-induced neuronal differentiation of mouse BMSCs. Materials—Recombinant human bFGF was purchased from i-DNA Biotechnology. Insulin-like growth factor I, nerve growth factor, and platelet-derived growth factor were from Sigma. FGFR inhibitor SU5402, Src inhibitor PP2, Ras inhibitor FTI-277, PLC-γ inhibitor U-73122, and cross-linker dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) were from Calbiochem. MEK inhibitor U0126 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 were from Cell Signaling Technology. Superscript™ III RT, Lipofectamine 2000, G418, and Hygromycin B were from Invitrogen. Mouse monoclonal antibodies against phospho-ERK1/2 (Thr-202/Tyr-204), phospho-c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK) (Thr-183/Tyr-185), ERK1/2, and polyclonal rabbit antibodies against phospho-FRS2 α (Tyr-196), phospho-c-Raf (Ser-338), phospho-p90RSK (Ser-380), phospho-p38 MAP kinase (Thr-180/Tyr-182), phosphor-PKCθ (Thr-538), phospho-PKCδ (Thr-505), and phospho-PLC-γ1 (Tyr-783) were from Cell Signaling Technology. Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was from Upstate Biotechnology. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies against FGFR-1, FGFR-2, and FGFR-3 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Goat polyclonal antibody against FGFR-4 and mouse monoclonal antibody against bFGF were from R&D Systems (Abingdon, UK). Goat polyclonal antibody against GAP-43 and mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin were from Chemicon. Other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Cell Culture—Mouse BMSCs were obtained from 8-week-old male mice. Briefly, cells were harvested from mouse bone marrow and cultured in Dulbecco modified Eagle's medium-low glucose supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 10% fetal calf serum, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. The adhered cells were eventually purified by passaging, and a homogenous cell population with flat and fibroblast-like morphology at passages 10–20 was used in this study. Plasmids and DNA Constructs—The short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for mouse FGFRs were designed to target 19 nucleotides of the mouse FGFR transcripts (FGFR-1 siRNA, nucleotides 1542–1560, 5′-GATGTTGAAGTCCGACGCA-3′; FGFR-2 siRNA, nucleotides 1555–1573, 5′-GCAGTGGGAATCGATAAAG-3′; FGFR-3 siRNA, nucleotides 1453–1461, 5′-GCTATTGGCATCGACAAGG-3, which were cloned into an siRNA expression vector pSilencer 1.0-U6 (Ambion). The same vector containing a hairpin siRNA whose sequence is not found in the mouse data base supplied in the vector kit was used as a control. A dominant negative mutant of c-Jun, TAM67 (27Brown P.H. Chen T.K. Birrer M.J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 791-799PubMed Google Scholar), was cloned into XhoI/KpnI sites of pREP10 (Invitrogen) and tagged with V5 epitope at the C-terminal. Reverse Transcription PCR Analysis of FGFR Expression in BMSCs—Total RNA was extracted from mouse BMSCs using TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen), and 2 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified by PCR. The primers for FGFRs were as follows: FGFR-1: sense, 5′-CGCTCTACCTGGAGATCATT-3′, antisense, 5′-ATAAAGAGGACCATCCTGTG-3′; FGFR-2: sense, 5′-AGAAGCGTACGTGGTTGCC-3′, antisense, 5′-GCTCCTGCTTAAACTCCTTC-3′; FGFR-3: sense, 5′-AGCTAGAGGTTCTGTCCTTG-3′, antisense, 5′-TCCTTGTCGATGCCAATAG-3′; FGFR-4: sense, 5′-TGTGAATCTAGACCTGCCTC-3′, antisense, 5′-CACTTCCGAGACTCCAGAT-3′. β-actin was included in the PCR as an internal control. The PCR reaction consisted of 35 cycles of denaturing at 94 °C for 45 s, annealing at 54 °C for 45 s, and extension at 72 °C for 90 s. The PCR products for FGFR-1, 2, 3, and 4 were 560, 464, 532, and 476 bp, respectively. The PCR products of expected sizes were gel-purified and cloned into pGEM T-easy and were confirmed to be FGFR-related by sequencing. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and then extracted with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and Roche Applied Science's complete protease inhibitors) and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The proteins in the supernatant were measured using a Protein Assay Kit II (BioRad). For immunoprecipitation analysis, 500 μg of total cell lysates was precleared with protein A plus G-Sepharose before incubation with specific antibodies, followed by addition of protein A plus G-Sepharose. The precipitated proteins were resolved in 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer before electrophoresis. For Western blotting analysis, samples were separated by electrophoresis on 10–14% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore Corp.). After blocking with PBST (3.2 mm Na2HPO4, 0.5 mm KH2 PO4, 1.3 mm KCl, 140 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.4) containing 5% skim milk, membranes were incubated with primary antibodies. The membranes were further incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies and developed using Pierce's West Pico Chemiluminescence substrate. To determine the equivalence of protein amounts loaded among different samples, the developed membranes were stripped with a buffer consisting of 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS, and 100 mm 2-mercaptoethanol at 50 °C for 45 min, followed by incubation with control antibodies such as anti-β-actin for further blotting. In some cases, immunoblots were quantified by measuring the immunoreactive protein band density with the software ImageJ 1.34s. Cross-linking Experiment—After incubation with 10 ng/ml bFGF for 2 min, BMSCs were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline and cross-linked with 1 mm thiol-cleavable cross-linking reagent dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) at 4 °C for 2 h. Dithiobis (succinimidyl propionate) stock solution was freshly prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide. The reactions were stopped by the addition of glycine at a final concentration of 100 mm for 15 min at room temperature. The cells were extracted with lysis buffer, and the lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies against FGFR-1, 2, and 3. Finally, the precipitated proteins were treated or untreated with DDT (200 mm), followed by immunoblotting. Ras Activation Assay—Ras activity was detected using the Ras activation assay kit (Upstate Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer's specifications. Briefly, cell lysates were incubated with glutathione S-transferase-Raf-1 Ras binding domain-agarose beads and the GTP-bound Ras was precipitated, followed by immunoblotting with anti-pan Ras antibody. Electrophysiology—For whole-cell current recording, cells were clamped as previously described (28Sakaguchi D.S. Janick L.M. Reh T.A. Dev. Dyn. 1997; 209: 387-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). The bath solution contained (in mm): NaCl 150, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 2.2, Hepes 10, pH 7.3, with NaOH, and osmolarity was adjusted to 310 mosm with glucose. The pipette solution contained (in mm): aspartic acid potassium salt 120, MgCl2 5, EGTA 0.5, Hepes 10, ATP 2, GTP 0.3, pH 7.3, with KOH, and osmolarity was adjusted to 295 mosm. Whole-cell current was obtained under voltage clamp with Axopatch 200B amplifier (Axon Instruments), and the results were analyzed using the software pClamp8.1 (Axon Instruments). The current was sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Leak was subtracted on-line by using P/4 protocol. The pipette used was 1–2 mΩ, and the series resistance was typically <5 mΩ and compensated by 75%. The holding potential was set at –70 mV and depolarized with different voltages to evoke channel opening. Transfection and Gene Silencing with siRNA—5 × 105 cells were seeded on 60-mm tissue culture dishes and cultured overnight. 8 μg of pSilencer 1.0-U6-based recombinant plasmids (each containing a unique 19-bp insert targeting FGFR-1–3) and 0.8 μg of pEGFP-C2 vector were co-transfected into BMSCs using Lipofectamine 2000 following the manufacturer's instructions. Transfected cells were selected with G418 at 500 μg/ml, and the expression of FGFR-1, 2, and 3 in selected cell clones was determined by Western blotting with specific antibodies. Cell clones in which the expression of FGFR was significantly silenced were selected for further study. Similarly, cell clones with TAM67 were obtained by selection with 500 μg/ml hygromycin, and the expression of TAM67 was determined by Western blotting using antibodies against V5 epitope and C-terminal of c-Jun. Transcription Factor Report Assay—The DNA binding activity of c-Fos, c-Jun, and NF-κB were determined with the TransAM™ Assay kits (Active Motif) according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. Briefly, cells were stimulated by bFGF and 2–10 μg of nuclear extracts was incubated in oligonucleotide-coated 96-well plate for 1 h. After washing, the bound complexes were incubated with antibodies against c-Fos, phospho-c-Jun, or NF-κB p65 for 1 h. The plates were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies for another 1 h. Finally, the developing solution was added for 2–10 min, followed by the measurement of absorbance at 450 nm. Statistical Analysis—Data were expressed as means ± S.E. values. The group means were compared by analysis of variance, and significance of differences was determined by post-hoc testing using Bonferroni's method. A p value of <0.05 was considered significant. bFGF Induces Mouse BMSC Neuronal Differentiation-—In in vitro studies, BMSCs can be induced and differentiated into neuronal phenotype by several protocols, using various growth factors and even chemicals such as β-mercaptoethanol and dimethyl sulfoxide (5Sanchez-ramos J.R. J. Neurosci. Res. 2002; 69: 880-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 6Corti S. Locatelli F. Papadimitriou D. Strazzer S. Comi G.P. J. Cell. Mol. Med. 2004; 8: 329-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Thus, the neuronal differentiation of BMSCs has been recently challenged as a stress response of BMSCs to the toxicity of chemicals (7Lu P. Blesch A. Tuszynski M.H. J. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 77: 174-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (412) Google Scholar). However, the pilot observation of neuronal differentiation of BMSCs after transplantation in the brain (29Kopen G.C. Prockop D.J. Phinney D.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10711-10716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1545) Google Scholar) strongly argues that BMSCs can generate neuronal cells under physiological conditions. To seek more solid in vitro evidence, we examined several growth factors for their ability to induce neuronal differentiation of mouse BMSCs. Under normal culture conditions, mouse BMSCs at passages 10–20 were treated with various molecules for 1–9 days. Cell morphological changes were monitored under the microscope, and images were taken every 24 h. Among tested molecules, only bFGF was found to be able to potently induce neuronal differentiation of mouse BMSCs (Fig. 1A). The bFGF-treated cells exhibited a gradual shrinkage of cell body and long cell processes connecting to the neighboring cells. These morphological changes started from day 2 and could be maintained for at least 9 days (data not shown). In contrast, cells treated with all other growth factors, such as insulin-like growth factor I, platelet-derived growth factor, and nerve growth factor, did not show any obvious morphological change within 3 days (Fig. 1A), and a longer treatment (up to 9 days) did not change our conclusion (data not shown). To confirm that the neuronal differentiation is induced specifically by bFGF, we applied the FGFR inhibitor SU5402 (30Mohammadi M. McMahon G. Sun L. Tang C. Hirth P. Yeh B.K. Hubbard S.R. Schlessinger J. Science. 1997; 276: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) in the neuronal differentiation experiment. As shown in Fig. 1A, the neuronal morphological change induced by bFGF was completely inhibited by SU5402 and cells remained flattened with fibroblast-like morphology similar to the untreated cells. We also analyzed the expression of the neuronal differentiation marker growth-associated protein-43 (GAP-43), which has been shown to be involved in the axon growth (31Burry R.W. Lah J.J. Hayes D.M. J. Neurocytol. 1992; 21: 413-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). As expected, the expression level of GAP-43 was substantially up-regulated from day 1 of treatment and increased steadily afterward (Fig. 1B). In contrast, the bFGF-induced expression of GAP-43 was completely blocked by FGFR inhibitor SU5402. The differentiated BMSCs exhibited not only neuronal morphology and marker expression but also the relevant electrophysiological properties. The membrane current of differentiated BMSCs was measured with the whole-cell patch clamp technique. As shown in Fig. 1C, after 3 days of treatment with bFGF, the current of BMSCs was evoked by giving a train of stimulated pulses ranging from 30 to 90 mV, and the outward current from the differentiated cells was likely to be the K+ current. In contrast, no detectable outward current was observed in untreated BMSCs under the same conditions. These results indicate that the neuronal cells differentiated from BMSCs have characteristic electrophysiological properties. FGFR-1 Is the Major Receptor Mediating Neuronal Differentiation—To determine whether FGFRs in mouse BMSCs contribute to the specific neurogenic effects of bFGF, we measured the expression levels of various FGFRs. Semiquantitative reverse transcription PCR experiments showed that the mRNA expression levels of four FGFRs were markedly different (Fig. 2A). The level of receptor-1 was high and levels of receptor-2 and -3 were relatively weak. The mRNA level of FGF receptor-4 was nearly undetectable. Western blotting analysis showed similar FGFR protein pattern (Fig. 2B). Because the binding affinities between various FGFRs and bFGF were different (14Wang J.K. Gao G. Goldfarb M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 181-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar), we then analyzed the binding properties of bFGF with each FGFR in BMSCs. Results from the chemical cross-linking and immunoprecipitation experiments showed that bFGF mainly bound to the FGFR-1 under our experimental conditions (Fig. 2C). Upon the binding of bFGF, the cytoplasmic domain of FGFR is phosphorylated (15Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), which in turn activates its downstream molecules. We examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of total cellular proteins in bFGF-treated BMSCs. As expected, protein phosphorylation was detected in BMSCs within 2 min after bFGF treatment (Fig. 3A). Similarly, phosphorylation of FRS2, a key initiator in FGFR signaling (15Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), was also observed (Fig. 3B). To determine which FGFR initiated the activation of FRS2, we carried out co-immunoprecipitation experiments. As shown in Fig. 3C, the phosphorylated FRS2 only formed a complex with FGFR-1, whereas neither FGFR-2 nor FGFR-3 interacted with FRS2. These data further indicate that FGFR-1 is the major FGF receptor to transduce signals from bFGF engagement to cytoplasmic cascades in neuronal differentiation of BMSCs. To determine precisely the role of FGFR-1 in neuronal induction, we generated stable cell lines transfected with siRNA constructs specific to FGFR1–3. The control cell line was transfected with the same vector containing a random sequence that was not found in the mouse genome data base. Several cell clones from each siRNA transfection were obtained, and the expression levels of FGFR-1, 2, and 3 were evaluated (Fig. 4A). The clones with the most knockdown were chosen for the following experiments. In the presence of bFGF, both the wild-type BSMCs and control siRNA-transfected cells exhibited the neuronal morphology within 3 days (Fig. 4B). However, bFGF failed to induce neuronal morphology in the FGFR-1 siRNA cells (clone 6) (Fig. 4B). In contrast, under the same conditions, both FGFR-2 and FGFR-3 siRNA cells exhibited neuronal morphology induced by bFGF (data not shown). Besides neuronal morphology, the expression of the neuronal differentiation marker GAP-43 was undetectable in FGFR-1 siRNA cells in day 1 cells and dramatically decreased in day 2 cells as compared with that of control cells (Fig. 4C). These results indicate that both neuronal morphological changes and expression of GAP-43 are FGFR-1-dependent. ERK1/2 Pathway Plays a Central Role in Neuronal Differentiation of BMSCs—The activated FGFRs will initiate various signaling pathways to fulfill their biological functions (15Powers C.J. McLeskey S.W. Wellstein A. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2000; 7: 165-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar). Because ERK has been shown to be required for neuronal transdifferentiation of pigment cells (18Galy A. Neron B. Planque N. Saule S. Eychene A. Dev. Biol. 2002; 248: 251-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), we first determined the activity of ERK pathway. As shown in Fig. 5A, the phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was first detected within 2 min after bFGF treatment and sustained for more than 4 h. A similar activation was also observed for ERK1/2 immediate upstream molecule MEK and downstream target p90RSK. To clarify signaling pathways mediating the activation of ERK1/2, we sequentially analyzed the activation of Ras, Raf, p38 MAP kinase, JNK, AKT, and protein kinase C in this experiment. Interestingly, we detected the activation of Ras (Fig. 5B), Raf, and PLC-γ but not AKT, protein kinase C, p38, and JNK (Fig. 5A). These results suggest that both ERK activation and neuronal differentiation of BMSCs rely on neither phosphoinositide 3-kinase nor protein kinase C pathways and are also not involved in the stress-signaling pathways. To determine how bFGF activates the ERK pathway, we applied selected inhibitors in the ERK activation experiment."
https://openalex.org/W2030551094,"We report the discovery of conopressin-T, a novel bioactive peptide isolated from Conus tulipa venom. Conopressin-T belongs to the vasopressin-like peptide family and displays high sequence homology to the mammalian hormone oxytocin (OT) and to vasotocin, the endogenous vasopressin analogue found in teleost fish, the cone snail's prey. Conopressin-T was found to act as a selective antagonist at the human V1a receptor. All peptides in this family contain two conserved amino acids within the exocyclic tripeptide (Pro7 and Gly9), which are replaced with Leu7 and Val9 in conopressin-T. Whereas conopressin-T binds only to OT and V1a receptors, an L7P analogue had increased affinity for the V1a receptor and weak V2 receptor binding. Surprisingly, replacing Gly9 with Val9 in OT and vasopressin revealed that this position can function as an agonist/antagonist switch at the V1a receptor. NMR structures of both conopressin-T and L7P analogue revealed a marked difference in the orientation of the exocyclic tripeptide that may serve as templates for the design of novel ligands with enhanced affinity for the V1a receptor.

Trends Endocrinol. Metab. 2000; 11: 406-410Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In humans, AVP acts via three vasopressin receptors (vascular V1aR, pituitary V1bR, and renal V2R), whereas OT acts via one OT receptor (OTR). All targets are members of the G protein-coupled receptor family (2Barberis C. Mouillac B. Durroux T. J. Endocrinol. 1998; 156: 223-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Peripherally, they regulate water balance, the control of blood pressure, and contraction of uterine smooth muscle and mammary myoepithelium (3Treschan T.A. Peters J. Anesthesiology. 2006; 105 (quiz 639-540): 599-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Centrally, these peptides affect levels of aggression, depression, and young parent bonding (4Febo M. Numan M. Ferris C.F. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 11637-11644Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 5Ferris C.F. Lu S.F. Messenger T. Guillon C.D. Heindel N. Miller M. Koppel G. Bruns Robert F.

Endogenous analogues of OT and AVP have been reported in nonmammalian vertebrates, annelids, molluscs, and insects, suggesting an old lineage for these peptides (7Hoyle C.H. Brain Res. 1999; 848: 1-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Surprisingly, two variants were also found in the venom of predatory cone snails. The original discovery of these two AVP analogues, named conopressins, was based on the characteristic “scratching” effect observed upon intracerebral injection into mice (8Cruz L.J. Santos de V.

Although the sequences of conopressins are similar to vasopressin itself, they have an additional positive charge in position 4, which is only found in two other endogenous vasopressin analogues, cephalotocin (Octopus vulgaris) and annetocin (Eisenia foetida). Conopressin-S was isolated from Conus striatus, whereas conopressin-G was first isolated from Conus geographus venom but later found in Conus imperialis venom as well as in tissue extracts of the nonvenomous snails Lymnea stagnalis and Aplysia californica and the leech Erpobdella octoculata (9McMaster D.

Molluscs of the genus Conus produce bioactive peptides in a combinatorial fashion. As demonstrated for the snake toxins (12Fry B.G. Genome Res. 2005; 15: 403-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar), most conotoxins or conopeptides are believed to be derived from an endogenous structural template (13Dutertre S. Lumsden N.G. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3860-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Because conopressin-G is widely distributed, it may represent the endogenous hormone in Gastropods and Annelids. However, a role in prey capture has also been proposed (14Nielsen D.B. Dykert J. Rivier J.E. McIntosh J.M. Toxicon. 1994; 32: 845-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In this study, we report the discovery of conopressin-T isolated from Conus tulipa venom. Pharmacological characterizations of Con-T across human receptors revealed that it is a selective V1a antagonist, with partial agonist activity at the OT receptor and no detectable activity at V1b and V2 receptors. The exocyclic tripeptide segment of conopressin-T shows unusual sequence divergence. L7P-Con-T had increased affinity at the V1a receptor but minimal effect on the selectivity profile across all human receptors compared with Con-T. Interestingly, replacing Gly9 with Val9 in OT and AVP converted these peptides from full agonist to full antagonist at the V1a receptor, demonstrating the role of position 9 as an antagonist switch in these peptides. Finally, the NMR structures of conopressin-T and its L7P analogue provide new templates for the design of novel pharmacological agents with enhanced activity at the V1a receptor. Materials—t-Butoxycarbonyl-protected amino acids and reagents used during chain assembly and HPLC purification (dimethylformamide, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, and trifluoroacetic acid) were peptide synthesis grade purchased from Auspep (Melbourne, Australia) and Novabiochem (San Diego, CA). 4-methylbenzhydrylamine-NH2 resin was obtained from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA). Most standard chemicals were purchased from Sigma, Roche Applied Science, or Merck, unless otherwise indicated. AVP and OT came from Bachem (Bubendorf, Switzerland), and fetal calf serum was from Sigma. Myo-[2-3H]inositol was from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Minimal essential medium and Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were purchased from Invitrogen, and inositol-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium came from ICN Biochemicals (Orsay, France).

Isolation and Sequencing—Specimens of Conus tulipa were collected from the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Venom ducts were dissected, and crude venom prepared as previously described (15Lewis R.J. Nielsen K.J. Craik D.J. Loughnan M.L. Adams D.A. Sharpe I.A. Luchian T. Adams D.J. Bond T. Thomas L. Jones A. Matheson J.L. Drinkwater R. Andrews P.R. Alewood P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35335-35344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Initial fractionation of the venom was carried out by RP-HPLC, and fractions were stored at 4 °C until further use. Conopressin-T was purified from fraction 30 using a 1% linear gradient of 0-60% solvent B in A over 60 min (A = 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid (aqueous); B = 0.045% trifluoroacetic acid, 90% acetonitrile) on an analytical C18 Phenomenex column. The flow rate was 1 ml/min, and the absorbance was monitored at 214 nm. N-terminal sequencing was carried out on an Applied Biosystems Procise HT Protein Sequencer (BRF, Newcastle, Australia) using ∼20 pmol of purified peptide. Peptide Synthesis—Conopressin-T and analogues were synthesized using the method described in Ref. 13Dutertre S. Lumsden N.G. Alewood P.F. Lewis R.J. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 3860-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, with minor modifications. Briefly, conopressin-T and L7P-conopressin-T were synthesized manually using t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry with in situ neutralization protocols (16Schnolzer M. Alewood P. Jones A. Alewood D. Kent S.B. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1992; 40: 180-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (938) Google Scholar) on a 0.5-mmol scale for residues 9 and 8. The peptide was then nitrogen-dried and split into two syntheses of 0.25 mmol for the remaining 7 residues of conopressin-T and L7P-conopressin-T. After HF cleavage, the crude peptides were purified by semipreparative RP-HPLC using a linear gradient of 0-60% B at 3 ml/min while monitoring UV absorbance at 214 nm. Air oxidation was carried out by dissolving 10 mg of the crude peptides in 45 ml of 0.1 m NH4HCO3 (pH 8.25) with vigorous stirring at room temperature for 1 h. Whereas L7P-conopressin-T dissolved readily at concentrations up to 0.5 mg/ml, conopressin-T was found to aggregate instantly. To overcome this, 1 mg of reduced conopressin-T was first dissolved in a 2:1 ratio of solution A and B and then slowly added to the oxidation buffer. Prior to purification, the solution was acidified to pH 3 with neat trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed by analytical C18 HPLC and electrospray-MS. Oxidized conopressin-T and L7P-conopressin-T were then purified by semipreparative RP-HPLC using the same chromatographic conditions as above. Pure fractions, as determined by analytical RP-HPLC and mass spectrometry, were pooled and lyophilized. Stock solutions of conopressin-T and L7P-conopressin-T were made in MilliQ water and quantified by analytical HPLC using a commercial AVP standard. Cloning of Human OT Receptor—A 1.3-kb fragment of OT cDNA, containing the full coding region of the human OT receptor, was isolated from human placental cDNA constructed from total placental RNA using SuperScript™ III reverse transcriptase. The following forward (5′-GGTAGAGGATTCCCGCTCATTTG-3′) and reverse (5′-GGGGAGGGATACAAACTGATAGG-3′) primers were used to isolate the DNA fragment. This fragment was subcloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/V5-his-TOPO. Following sequence analysis, 8 nucleotide changes were found over the published OT sequence (NM_000916) encoding 7 amino acid changes with one change being conserved. The nucleotide changes were T47C, A281G, A256C, G532C, T646C, and A1121G, which correspond to amino acid changes of V16A, H73R, M86L, G178R, F216L, and N374S. These changes were mutated to the published sequence using a QuikChange™ XL site-directed mutagenesis kit. OT Receptor Expression and Membrane Preparation—DNA was prepared and used for transfection in CHO-K1 cells. CHO-K1 cells were propagated in 150-mm plates with F-12 medium containing 10% Serum Supreme at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2. Transient transfection was performed with an appropriate plasmid using the TransIT®-CHO transfection reagent method. Briefly, the method involved combining TransIT®-CHO reagent (72 μl) in serum-free F-12 medium incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Following the addition of receptor plasmid (24 μg), this mixture was incubated for 10 min at room temperature. CHO Mojo reagent (16 μl) was added to the mixture and incubated for 15 min at room temperature prior to the addition to the cells. The transfected cells were harvested within 24 h by the following method. Confluent 150-mm plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 2.7 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl), harvested by scraping into ice-cold harvest buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2), followed by homogenization with a Polytron homogenizer and centrifugation at 100 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were recovered and centrifuged at 22,000 × g for 1 h at 4 °C. Membrane pellets were resuspended in 0.5 ml of ice-cold assay buffer A (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, containing 10% glycerol and aliquots stored at -80 °C until use. Receptor Binding Studies—Receptor binding assays were performed using FlashBlue™ GPCR scintillation beads. Flash-Blue™ GPCR beads are 3-μm polystyrene scintillating beads with wheat germ agglutinin covalently attached on the surface. These beads allow development of a homogeneous GPCR radioligand binding assay using cellular membranes. Briefly, FlashBlue™ GPCR SPA binding assays were performed in 96-well white polystyrene plates with clear flat bottoms (Costar). Radioligand (OTR [3H]OT (2 nm), V1a 125I-labeled linear V1a antagonist (21 pm), V1b [3H]AVP (0.5 nm), V2 [3H]AVP (0.85 nm)) was added to each membrane preparation, followed by the addition of various concentrations of competing compounds (1 pm to 10 μm) in a total volume of 80 μl containing assay buffer A or B (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and either 5 mm MgCl2 (A) or 10 mm MgCl2 (B)) (OT and V2 assay, buffer A; V1a and V1b assay, buffer B). The final reaction volume per well comprised 20 μl of compound/buffer, 20 μl of FlashBlue™ GPCR beads (OTR, V1a, and V2, 100 μg; V1b, 200 μg), and 20 μl of membrane, and the assay was initiated by the addition of 20 μl of radioligand. The plate was then sealed with TopSeal-A sealing film and incubated with shaking for 1 h at room temperature. Radioligand binding was then assessed for 30 s/well on a 1450 Microbeta scintillation counter (Wallac). All binding data were analyzed using GraphPad PRISM (GraphPAD Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Each data point was performed in triplicate and derived from at least three separate experiments. The inhibitory dissociation constant (Ki) was calculated using the following formula: Ki = IC50/(1 + [L]/Kd), where [L] is the concentration of radioligand present, and Kd is the dissociation constant of radioligand (17Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12293) Google Scholar). Inositol Phosphate Assays—Inositol phosphate accumulation was determined as previously described (18Derick S. Cheng L.L. Voirol M.J. Stoev S. Giacomini M. Wo N.C. Szeto H.H. Mimoun Ben M. Andres M. Gaillard R.C. Guillon G. Manning M. Endocrinology. 2002; 143: 4655-4664Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, CHO cells stably transfected with AVP/OT receptors were plated at 100,000 cells/well. Cells were grown for 24 h in their respective culture medium (see above) and further incubated for another 24-h period in a serum- and inositol-free medium supplemented with 1 μCi·ml-1 myo-[2-3H]inositol. Cells were then washed twice with Hanks' buffered saline medium, incubated for 15 min in this medium supplemented with 20 mm LiCl, and further stimulated for 15 min with increasing concentrations of analogues to be tested. The reaction was stopped by adding perchloric acid (5%, v/v). Total inositol phosphates (IPs) accumulated were extracted and purified on a Dowex AGI-X8 anion exchange chromatography column and counted. NMR Spectroscopy—Samples for 1H NMR measurements contained ∼1 mm peptide in 95% H2O, 5% D2O (v/v) at pH ∼3. Spectra were recorded at 290 K on a Bruker AVANCE-600 spectrometer. Two-dimensional NMR spectra were recorded in phase-sensitive mode using time-proportional phase incrementation for quadrature detection in the t1 dimension (19Daly N.L. Ekberg J.A. Thomas L.

The two-dimensional experiments consisted of a TOCSY using a MLEV-17 spin lock sequence with a mixing time of 80 ms, DQF-COSY, and NOESY with mixing times of 200-300 ms. Solvent suppression was achieved using a modified WATERGATE sequence. Spectra were acquired over 6024 Hz with 4096 complex data points in F2 and 512 increments in the F1 dimension. 3JHN-Hα coupling constants were measured from a one-dimensional spectrum or from the DQF-COSY spectrum. Spectra were processed on a Silicon Graphics Indigo work station using XWINNMR (Bruker) software. The t1 dimension was zero-filled to 1024 real data points, and 90° phase-shifted sine bell window functions were applied prior to Fourier transformation. Structure Calculations—Preliminary structures were calculated using a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol within the program DYANA (21Guntert P. Mumenthaler C. Wuthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1997; 273: 283-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (2555) Google Scholar). Final structures were calculated using simulated annealing and energy minimization protocols within CNS version 1.1 (22Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Rice L.M. Structure. 1997; 5: 325-336Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). The starting structures were generated using random (φ,ψ) dihedral angles and energy-minimized to produce structures with the correct local geometry. A set of 50 structures was generated by a torsion angle simulated annealing protocol (19Daly N.L. Ekberg J.A. Thomas L. Adams D.J. Lewis R.J. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 25774-25782Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar, 20Rosengren K.J. Daly N.L. Plan M.R. Waine C. Craik D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 8606-8616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). This protocol involved a high temperature phase comprising 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics, a cooling phase with 4000 steps of 0.015 ps of torsion angle dynamics during which the temperature was lowered to 0 K, and finally an energy minimization phase comprising 500 steps of Powell minimization. Structures consistent with restraints were subjected to further molecular dynamics and energy minimization in a water shell, as described by Linge and Nilges (23Linge J.P. Nilges M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 13: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). The refinement in explicit water involved the following steps. First, heating to 500 K via steps of 100 K, each comprising 50 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Second, 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics at 500 K before a cooling phase where the temperature was lowered in steps of 100 K, each comprising 2500 steps of 0.005 ps of Cartesian dynamics. Finally, the structures were minimized with 2000 steps of Powell minimization. Structures were analyzed using PROMOTIF (24Hutchinson E.G. Thornton J.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (997) Google Scholar) and PROCHECK-NMR (25Laskowski R.A. Rullmannn J.A. MacArthur M.W. Kaptein R. Thornton J.M. J. Biomol. NMR. 1996; 8: 477-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (4428) Google Scholar). Isolation and Sequencing of Conopressin-T—A peptide with a monoisotopic mass of 1107.54 Da was purified from C. tulipa venom (Fig. 1, A-C). The Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine-reduced peptide displayed a mass of 1109.5 Da, suggesting the presence of one disulfide bond (data not shown). N-terminal sequencing produced the sequence CYIQNCLRV with a calculated mass of 1110.53 Da, consistent with one disulfide bond (-2 Da) and C-terminal amidation (-1 Da). A BLAST search revealed that this sequence belonged to the vasopressin peptide family characterized by a disulfide-containing ring (residues 1-6) and a short exocyclic C-terminal tripeptide (residues 7-9). Conopressin-T had 7 of 9 residues identical to vasotocin (AVT), including the first six residues also found in oxytocin and mesotocin, and Arg8 known to be essential for the pressor activity in vasopressin. However, two highly conserved residues, Pro7 and Gly9, found in other vasopressin-like peptides as well as conopressin-G and conopressin-S are modified to Leu7 and Val9 in conopressin-T. De novo mass spectrometry sequencing (data not shown) unambiguously confirmed the sequence of Con-T as CYIQNCLRV-NH2. Synthesis of Conopressin-T and L7P-Conopressin-T—Con-T and its analogues were synthesized on 4-methylbenzhydrylamine resin using solid-phase peptide synthesis t-butoxycarbonyl chemistry to further validate the primary sequence and allow characterization of its biological activity. Lyophilized crude peptides from HF cleavage were dissolved in 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and analyzed on analytical C18 Phenomenex RP-HPLC column. The chromatograms and electrospray-MS revealed that the syntheses contained >90% of the expected products; consequently, the oxidation was carried out directly on the crude peptides following the conditions described under “Experimental Procedures.” During synthesis, we noticed that the replacement of Leu7 by Pro7 had a marked effect on solubility. L7P-Con-T dissolved readily in oxidation buffer to 0.5 mg/ml, whereas Con-T aggregated instantly in this solvent. This difference suggested that a Leu or a Pro at position 7 significantly modified the physical properties of the peptides. Oxidized synthetic and native Con-T were indistinguishable when co-injected in a C18 Phenomenex analytical RP-HPLC column (Fig. 1D). Conopressin-T and L7P-Conopressin-T Are Selective V1a Receptor Antagonists—Con-T and L7P-Con-T were tested for their ability to displace radioligand from human AVP and OT receptors expressed in HEK and CHO cells (Fig. 2A and Table 1). Con-T showed the highest affinity for human OTR (Ki = 108 nm) and V1aR (Ki = 319 nm) and no detectable activity at V1b and V2 receptors at up to 10 μm peptide. In contrast, L7P-Con-T was 8-fold more potent than Con-T at the V1aR (Ki = 37 nm) but had similar affinity for OTR (Ki = 132 nm). L7P-Con-T was also found to have a weak effect at V2R (Ki = 1.8 μm), whereas no displacement of radioligand was detected at the V1bR at up to 10 μm peptide. For comparison, we also tested the activity of conopressin-S (Con-S) across these receptors. Con-S does not bind to V2R (up to 10 μm peptide), has similar affinity for OTR (Ki = 175 nm) but is less potent at V1a (Ki = 827 nm). In contrast to Con-T and L7P-Con-T, Con-S binds with high affinity to V1bR (Ki = 8.3 nm), although the displacement of specific [3H]AVP binding was incomplete (a 30-40% resistant component remained; see Fig. 2A). Therefore, conopressin-T, -S, and -L7P have distinct pharmacological profiles on human receptors, with the lack of effect of Con-T on radioligand binding to both V1b and V2 receptors being unique (supplemental Fig. 1).TABLE 1Binding affinities (Ki, nm) on human vasopressin and oxytocin receptorsCompoundV1aRV1bRV2ROTRCon-T319 ± 15>10,000>10,000108 ± 9L7P-Con-T37 ± 2>10,0001836 ± 392132 ± 10Con-S827 ± 768.3 ± 1.6>10,000175 ± 13AVP0.6 ± 0.020.085 ± 0.014.9 ± 0.32110 ± 25G9V-AVP25 ± 2170 ± 2224 ± 3114 ± 35OT37 ± 3222 ± 22823 ± 1221.5 ± 0.42G9V-OT466 ± 43>10,000>10,000464 ± 171Values are mean ± S.E. obtained from at least three separate experiments, each performed in triplicate.

However, Con-T at 10 μm showed partial agonist activity at the V1bR and OTR, producing 9 and 22% of AVP and OT maximal activity, respectively. L7P-Con-T displayed a similar profile, with no agonist activity at the V1aR at ≤10 μm and partial agonist activity at the V1bR and OTR (4 and 28% of AVP and OT maximal activity, respectively) at 10 μm peptide. In contrast, both Con-T and L7P-Con-T induced a potent and concentration-dependent inhibition of AVP-stimulated IP production in CHO cells expressing V1aR, with Kinact values of 329 and 90 nm, respectively (Table 2). These values correlated well with the binding affinities. Thus, both peptides are full antagonists at the human V1aR subtype and weak partial agonists for the V1bR and OTR (Fig. 2B). Due to the absence of significant binding to V2R, the functional activity of Con-T and L7P-Con-T was not investigated on this subtype.TABLE 2Antagonist and agonist actions of Con-T, L7P-Con-T, G9V-AVP, and G9V-OT on IP signaling through human vasopressin and oxytocin receptorsCompoundV1aRV1bROTRCon-TNo agonist activity at 10 μm (1 ± 7% of AVP maximum activity)Weak agonist activity (9 ± 3% of AVP max activity at 10 μm)Partial agonist (22 ± 3% of OT maximum activity; Kact 37 ± 30 nm)Antagonist, Kinact 329 ± 58 nmNo antagonist activity at 10 μmNo antagonist activity at 10 μmL7P-Con-TNo agonist activity at 10 μmWeak agonist activity at 10 μm (4 ± 2% of AVP max activity)Partial agonist (28 ± 3% of OT max activity; Kact = 16 nm)Antagonist, Kinact 90 ± 12 nmNo antagonist activity at 10 μmNo antagonist activity at 10 μmG9V-AVPNo agonist activity at 10 μmPartial agonist (5-10% of OT maximum activity; Kact 320 ± 145 nm)Antagonist, Kinact 40 ± 10 nmNDaND, not determined.No antagonist activity at 10 μmG9V-OTNo agonist activity at 10 μmPartial agonist (25-30% of OT maximum activity; Kact 124 ± 37 nm)Antagonist, Kinact 391 ± 85 nmNDNo antagonist activity at 10 μma ND, not determined. Open table in a new tab Gly9 → Val Replacement in OT and AVP Acts as an Antagonist Switch at the V1a Receptor—L7P-conopressin-T and vasotocin differs only at position 9, yet L7P-conopressin-T acts as a full antagonist at the V1a receptor (Fig. 2B), whereas the closely related vasotocin is known to function as an agonist (29Mahlmann S.

To investigate if the Val9 modification in conopressin-T could switch agonist to antagonist activity in related peptides, we tested this modification in OT and AVP. First, the binding properties of these analogues were assessed on human receptors (Fig. 3A and Table 1). G9V-AVP was equipotent at V1aR and V2R (∼25 nm) and 5-7-fold less potent at the OTR and V1bR (114 and 170 nm, respectively). Compared with AVP, G9V-AVP affinity ranged from 5-fold less at V2R to 2000-fold less at V1bR. In contrast, G9V-OT was equipotent at the V1a and OT receptors (∼465 nm), whereas it was unable to fully displace radioligands at the V1b and V2 subtypes at concentrations up to 10 μm. Compared with OT, G9V-OT affinity ranged from 13-fold less at V1aR to 309-fold less at OTR. The functional properties of G9V-AVP and G9V-OT were investigated on CHO cells expressing human receptors (Fig. 3B and Table 2). Both peptides failed to stimulate phospholipase C activity in cells expressing V1aR at ≤10 μm peptide. However, G9V-AVP and G9V-OT both acted as partial agonists at the OTR, eliciting ∼5-10% and ∼25-30% of OT maximal activity, respectively. In contrast, both peptides induced a potent and concentration-dependent inhibition of AVP-stimulated IP production in CHO cells expressing V1aR. The affinities (Kinact) of G9V-AVP (40 nm) and G9V-OT (391 nm) correlate well with the binding data at the V1a receptor (25 and 466 nm, respectively). Clearly, the G9V replacemen"
https://openalex.org/W2070364505,"Background Consultation rates of influenza-like illness (ILI) in an outpatient setting have been regarded as a good indicator of influenza virus activity in the community. As ILI-like symptoms may be caused by etiologies other than influenza, and influenza virus activity in the tropics and subtropics is less predictable than in temperate regions, the correlation between of ILI and influenza virus activity in tropical and subtropical regions is less well defined. Methodology and Principal Findings In this study, we used wavelet analysis to investigate the relationship between seasonality of influenza virus activity and consultation rates of ILI reported separately by General Out-patient Clinics (GOPC) and General Practitioners (GP). During the periods 1998–2000 and 2002–2003, influenza virus activity exhibited both annual and semiannual cycles, with one peak in the winter and another in late spring or early summer. But during 2001 and 2004–2006, only annual cycles could be clearly identified. ILI consultation rates in both GOPC and GP settings share a similar non-stationary seasonal pattern. We found high coherence between ILI in GOPC and influenza virus activity for the annual cycle, but this was only significant (p<0.05) during the periods 1998–1999 and 2002–2006. For the semiannual cycle high coherence (p<0.05) was also found significant during the period 1998–1999 and year 2003 when two peaks of influenza were evident. Similarly, ILI in GP setting is also associated with influenza virus activity for both the annual and semiannual cycles. On average, oscillation of ILI in GP and of ILI in GOPC preceded influenza virus isolation by approximately four and two weeks, respectively. Conclusions Our findings suggest that consultation rates of ILI precede the oscillations of laboratory surveillance by at least two weeks and can be used as a predictor for influenza epidemics in Hong Kong. The validity of our model for other tropical regions needs to be explored."
https://openalex.org/W1981003930,"Background Ticks are blood feeding arachnids that characteristically take a long blood meal. They must therefore counteract host defence mechanisms such as hemostasis, inflammation and the immune response. This is achieved by expressing batteries of salivary proteins coded by multigene families. Methodology/Principal Findings We report the in-depth analysis of a tick multigene family and describe five new anticomplement proteins in Ixodes ricinus. Compared to previously described Ixodes anticomplement proteins, these segregated into a new phylogenetic group or subfamily. These proteins have a novel action mechanism as they specifically bind to properdin, leading to the inhibition of C3 convertase and the alternative complement pathway. An excess of non-synonymous over synonymous changes indicated that coding sequences had undergone diversifying selection. Diversification was not associated with structural, biochemical or functional diversity, adaptation to host species or stage specificity but rather to differences in antigenicity. Conclusions/Significance Anticomplement proteins from I. ricinus are the first inhibitors that specifically target a positive regulator of complement, properdin. They may provide new tools for the investigation of role of properdin in physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms. They may also be useful in disorders affecting the alternative complement pathway. Looking for and detecting the different selection pressures involved will help in understanding the evolution of multigene families and hematophagy in arthropods."
https://openalex.org/W1971599740,"Pancreatic β-cell death is a critical event in type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and clinical islet transplantation. We have previously shown that prolonged block of ryanodine receptor (RyR)-gated release from intracellular Ca2+ stores activates calpain-10-dependent apoptosis in β-cells. In the present study, we further characterized intracellular Ca2+ channel expression and function in human islets and the MIN6 β-cell line. All three RyR isoforms were identified in human islets and MIN6 cells, and these endoplasmic reticulum channels were observed in close proximity to mitochondria. Blocking RyR channels, but not sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pumps, reduced the ATP/ADP ratio. Blocking Ca2+ flux through RyR or inositol trisphosphate receptor channels, but not SERCA pumps, increased the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1β). Moreover, inhibition of RyR or inositol trisphosphate receptor channels, but not SERCA pumps, increased the expression of presenilin-1. Both HIF-1β and presenilin-1 expression were also induced by low glucose. Overexpression of presenilin-1 increased HIF-1β, suggesting that HIF is downstream of presenilin. Our results provide the first evidence of a presenilin-HIF signaling network in β-cells. We demonstrate that this pathway is controlled by Ca2+ flux through intracellular channels, likely via changes in mitochondrial metabolism and ATP. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of the signaling pathways activated when intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis and metabolic activity are suppressed in diabetes and islet transplantation.

We have recently obtained evidence suggesting that apoptosis subsequent to RyR inhibition does not involve an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response despite the localization of RyR in the ER. 5D.

Excitotoxicity is unlikely to mediate ryanodine-induced apoptosis, as blocking RyR flux with a high dose of ryanodine suppressed, rather than enhanced, apoptosis caused by chronic hyperglycemia in β-cells (6Johnson J.D.

In neurons, blocking RyR with dantrolene also suppressed excitotoxicity and cell death caused by mutations in presenilin, a gene linked to familial Alzheimer disease (11Popescu B.O. Oprica M.

Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1358-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, because Ca2+ flux from the ER to the mitochondria in β-cells has been shown to contribute to the generation of ATP (13Tsuboi T. da Silva Xavier G. Holz G.G. Jouaville L.S. Thomas A.P. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 287-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), chronic block of RyR might cause cell death by reducing metabolic activity. Our previous experiments suggest that calpain-10 represents a common effector for hypoglycemia-induced β-cell death and ryanodine-induced apoptosis (6Johnson J.D. Han Z. Otani K. Ye H. Zhang Y. Wu H.

Other calpains have also been implicated in the response to hypoglycemia and hypoxia (14Vanderklish P.W. Bahr B.A. Int. J. Exp.

In this regard, it is interesting that calpain-10 has recently been shown to localize to the mitochondria (16Arrington D.D. Van Vleet T.R. Schnellmann R.G. Am. J. Physiol. 2006; 291: C1159-C1171Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), where it would be strategically positioned to respond to changes in metabolic activity. Changes in cellular metabolic activity induce the expression of hypoxia-inducible factors, transcription factors that can activate both pro-survival and pro-apoptotic programs. HIF-1β was reported to be the most significantly decreased gene in islets from type 2 diabetics, and mice lacking this gene had impaired glucose homeostasis (17Gunton J.E. Kulkarni R.N. Yim S. Okada T. Hawthorne W.J. Tseng Y.H. Roberson R.S. Ricordi C. O'Connell P.J. Gonzalez F.J. Kahn C.R.

Arntl2, a homologue of HIF-1β, has been identified as a type 1 diabetes candidate gene in the Iddm6 locus of the NOD mouse (19Hung M.S. Avner P. Rogner U.C. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2006; 15: 2732-2742Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). However, the signals that regulate hypoxia-inducible factors in β-cells are poorly characterized. Another family of proteins that has been implicated in the response to reduced cellular metabolic activity is the presenilins. Presenilin mutations lead to familial Alzheimer disease (20Koo E.H. Kopan R. Nat. Med. 2004; 10: S26-S33Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Presenilin is a critical component of the γ-secretase complex, which we have recently shown can regulate β-cell survival via the cleavage of Notch (21Dror V. Nguyen V. Walia P. Kalynyak T.B. Hill J.A. Johnson J.D. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 2504-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Presenilins have also been implicated in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis, apoptosis, and the response to hypoglycemia in neurons (12Mattson M.P. Zhu H. Yu J. Kindy M.S. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 1358-1364Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Gasparini L. Ghidoni R. Alberici A.C. Benussi L. Moratto D. Trabucchi M. Growdon J.H. Nitsch R.M. Binetti G. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Moreover, although the effects of mutant presenilins have been extensively researched, there are few studies on the endogenous regulators of these critical proteins. Interestingly, hypoxia has been shown to regulate the expression and the alternate splicing of presenilin-2 (24Mohuczy D. Qian K. Phillips M.I. Regul.

Conversely, HIF-1α mRNA was identified as one of the most up-regulated targets of presenilin-1 by both microarray (27Cui J.G. Fraser P.E. St. George-Hyslop P. Westaway D. Lukiw W.J. Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 2025-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and differential display (28Liauw J. Nguyen V. Huang J. St. George-Hyslop P. Rozmahel R. Brain Res. Mol.

In the present study, we sought to identify novel components of a β-cell survival gene network linked to RyR. We also sought to clarify the mechanisms associated with ryanodine-induced β-cell death and compare the effects of blocking RyR with inhibition of IP3R and SERCA. Analogies between ryanodine- and hypoxia-induced cell death caused us to focus our study on two key pathways that have been implicated in programmed cell death, namely the hypoxia-inducible pathway and the presenilins. We found that blocking RyR and/or IP3R, but not SERCA pumps, induced the expression of presenilins, as well as a hypoxia-inducible factor. We also determined that overexpression of presenilin-1 increased the levels of HIF-1β protein. Together these results provide the first evidence of a RyR-presenilin-HIF genetic network controlling β-cell survival. Reagents and Cell Culture—Ryanodine was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) or Tocris (Ellisville, MO) or Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Xestospongin C was purchased from AG Scientific (San Diego, CA). Thapsigargin was purchased from Calbiochem or Sigma. Carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone (CCCP) was from Calbiochem. All drugs were kept as 1000× stocks dissolved in Me2SO. Human islets were provided by Dr. Garth Warnock as part of the Centre for Human Islet Transplantation and Beta-cell Regeneration Core and cultured as described (29Johnson J.D. Bernal-Mizrachi E. Alejandro E.U. Han Z. Kalynyak T.B. Li H. Beith J.L. Gross J. Warnock G.L. Townsend R.R. Permutt M.A. Polonsky K.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Islets were kept in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and saturated humidity and were used within 3 days of their isolation from donors. MIN6 cells were cultured in 5 or 25 mm glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 2% penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen) as indicated. Cells were treated at a confluency of ∼80%. Single Cell Imaging—MIN6 cells were imaged through the ×100, 1.45 numerical aperture objective of a Zeiss 200M microscope. Images were deconvolved using Slidebook from Intelligent Imaging Innovations (Boulder, CO). For organelle studies, cells were transfected with fluorescent proteins targeted to ER using KDEL and calreticulin motifs or mitochondria using the pOCT sequence (gift from H. McBride, University of Ottawa). The ratiometric mitochondrial pericam was a gift from Tullio Pozzan, University of Padua. D1ER was a gift from Amy Palmer and Roger Tsien (University of California San Diego). Measurement of Apoptosis—Apoptosis was measured in single dispersed human islet cells, cultured overnight as indicated, using the ApoPercentage kit (Biocolor). This kit uses a dye that stains cells as they undergo the membrane “flip-flop” event that mediates phosphatidylserine translocation to the outer leaflet (28Liauw J. Nguyen V. Huang J. St. George-Hyslop P. Rozmahel R. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2002; 109: 56-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This event is considered diagnostic of apoptosis, but not necrosis. Apoptotic cells appeared bright pink against the white background of phenol red-free RPMI 1640 medium. Apoptosis in MIN6 cells was assayed using terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. MIN6 cells were counterstained with hematoxylin. ATP/ADP Ratio Assay—MIN6 cells were grown on tissue culture-treated 96-well luminometer assay plates and exposed to drugs as indicated. Following culture, cells were lysed and ATP/ADP ratios were measured using a commercial kit (Alexis, Axxora, San Diego, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A luminometer (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) was used to read the plates. Immunoblot and Reverse Transcriptase PCR—Western blots were performed as described (21Dror V. Nguyen V. Walia P. Kalynyak T.B. Hill J.A. Johnson J.D. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 2504-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The following primary antibodies were used: monoclonal pan-RyR clone 34C (Affinity Bioreagents), rabbit polyclonal calnexin (Sigma), calpain-10 (Abcam), HIF-1β (BD Biosciences), presenilin-1 (Cell Signaling), presenilin-2 (Cell Signaling), β-actin (Novus). Reverse transcriptase PCR was carried out as described (21Dror V. Nguyen V. Walia P. Kalynyak T.B. Hill J.A. Johnson J.D. Diabetologia. 2007; 50: 2504-2515Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) for 35 cycles. Primer sequences are available upon request. Gene Overexpression in MIN6 Cells—A full-length presenilin-1 clone in a CMV promoter vector (pCMV6-XL5-PSEN1) was purchased from Origene (Rockville, MD). MIN6 cells were transfected with 1 μg of pCDNA3 or green fluorescent protein (as controls) or pCMV6-XL5-PSEN1 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were incubated for 48 h in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2 and were subsequently harvested and subjected to Western blot analysis as described above. Relationship between β-Cell ER and Mitochondria—A close physical and functional relationship between the ER and mitochondria has been demonstrated in many cell types but has received less attention in β-cells. To assess the subcellular distribution of both organelles simultaneously, MIN6 cells were co-transfected with fluorescent proteins targeted to each organelle. ER was distributed widely throughout the cytoplasm, and mitochondria were typically found nearby (Fig. 1A). A similar pattern was observed when mitochondria were labeled with a Ca2+-sensitive probe, the ratiometric pericam. Apparent mitochondrial Ca2+ hotspots were observed near to ER (Fig. 1B). Together, these data suggest that ER and mitochondria have many sites of close proximity to each other in β-cells and illustrate the physical possibility of ER-to-mitochondria communication in these cells. In other cell types, ER calcium can be mobilized through both IP3R and RyR Ca2+ release channels. We employed the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent protein-based probe D1ER cameleon (30Palmer A.E. Jin C. Reed J.C. Tsien R.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 17404-17409Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar) to determine whether these channels are functional on β-cell ER. Indeed, both a stimulatory dose of ryanodine and the IP3-generating agonist carbachol could release Ca2+ from the ER lumen (Fig. 1C). This result provided further functional evidence that both RyRs and IP3Rs can be present in MIN6 β-cells. Identification of RyR Channel Isoforms in β-Cells—The presence of RyR mRNA in pancreatic β-cells remains controversial (31Beauvois M.C. Arredouani A. Jonas J.C. Rolland J.F. Schuit F. Henquin J.C. Gilon P. J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 141-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). With the knowledge that RyRs can be subject to alternate splicing (32George C.H. Rogers S.A. Bertrand B.M. Tunwell R.E. Thomas N.L. Steele D.S. Cox E.V. Pepper C. Hazeel C.J. Claycomb W.C. Lai F.A. Circ. Res. 2007; 100: 874-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), we used PCR primers targeting multiple regions of the mRNA for each of the three RyR genes. These experiments demonstrated that all three RyR genes are expressed in human islets and MIN6 cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Exons 6 and 45 of the RyR2 were also detected using additional primers (not shown). Overall, the expression of RyR2 appeared to be stronger and more consistent than that of RyR1 or RyR3. Together, these studies suggest RyRs are present in islet cells. Next we employed pan-RyR antibodies to study the subcellular localization of these channels in MIN6 β-cells. Consistent with our previous studies in human β-cells (7Johnson J.D. Kuang S. Misler S. Polonsky K.S. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 878-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), RyR immunoreactivity was not observed in insulin secretory granules but was found in endosomes (Fig. 2C). As expected, we also observed RyR staining in ER, especially in regions close to mitochondria (Fig. 2C). Together, these studies further point to a role for RyR in β-cell function. Blocking ER Ca2+ Channels Induces Apoptosis—We demonstrated in a previous study that chronically blocking RyR Ca2+ release channels led to a calpain-10-dependent form of programmed cell death in mouse islets (6Johnson J.D. Han Z. Otani K. Ye H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Horikawa Y. Misler S. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24794-24802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present study, we sought to confirm and extend these findings using other assays and β-cell models. Treatment of dispersed human islet cells for 48 h with 10 μm ryanodine increased the percentage of cells with exposure of phosphatidylserine on the outer plasma membrane to ∼50% from ∼14% in control cells (Fig. 3, A–C). Previous studies in primary T lymphocytes have demonstrated that this event can occur in caspase-3-independent modes of apoptosis (33Ferraro-Peyret C. Quemeneur L. Flacher M. Revillard J.P. Genestier L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 4805-4810Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). We also confirmed that MIN6 cells underwent programmed cell death in response to 48-h treatment with ryanodine, as indicated by increased terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining (Fig. 3, D and E). Our previous investigation also pointed to increased calpain-10 mRNA in ryanodine-treated primary mouse islets (6Johnson J.D. Han Z. Otani K. Ye H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Horikawa Y. Misler S. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24794-24802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). In the present study, we examined calpain-10 protein levels in human islets. We found that a blocking dose of ryanodine increased calpain-10 protein, predominantly a lower molecular weight splice variant preferentially expressed in islets (6Johnson J.D. Han Z. Otani K. Ye H.

Similar results were observed in MIN6 cells (not shown). Blocking ER IP3R Ca2+ release channels with 1 μm xestospongin C increased calpain-10 levels in human islets (Fig. 3F), but not MIN6 cells (not shown). Together, these results show that calpain-10 protein levels are increased when intracellular Ca2+ release is blocked in human islets. Effects of Intracellular Ca2+ Channels and Pumps on ATP/ADP—Ca2+ flux through intracellular release channels has been implicated in the control of mitochondrial function in many cell types, including β-cells (13Tsuboi T. da Silva Xavier G. Holz G.G. Jouaville L.S. Thomas A.P. Rutter G.A. Biochem. J. 2003; 369: 287-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our previous studies suggested the possibility that Ca2+ flux from RyR-gated intracellular Ca2+ stores was required to prevent a form of cell death that resembled hypoglycemia (6Johnson J.D. Han Z. Otani K. Ye H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Horikawa Y. Misler S. Bell G.I. Polonsky K.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 24794-24802Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). To directly test the hypothesis that RyRs control β-cell metabolism, we examined the effects of Ca2+ channel inhibitors on the ATP to ADP ratio using a luciferase-based assay in MIN6 β-cells. At both high and low glucose, 24-h treatment with a blocking dose of ryanodine significantly decreased the ATP to ADP ratio (Fig. 4). Thapsigargin increased the ATP to ADP ratio, suggesting the possibility that ATP was being spared from hydrolysis in the absence of SERCA activity. The mitochondrial uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone was used as a positive control, and its effect likely marks the lower limit of the ATP to ADP ratio. Thus, blocking Ca2+ flux via RyR reduced the ATP to ADP ratio by approximately half of what was seen with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone. In the low glucose condition, the ATP to ADP ratio was increased by opening RyR with a stimulatory low dose of ryanodine (6Johnson J.D. Han Z. Otani K. Ye H. Zhang Y. Wu H. Horikawa Y. Misler S.

FASEB J. 2004; 18: 878-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Activating RyR did not induce an additional increase in the ATP to ADP ratio in the presence of high glucose. Together, these studies indicate that normal Ca2+ flux through RyR is critical for the control of cellular metabolism in β-cells.FIGURE 5Opening RyR increases ATP. Stimulation of the RyR Ca2+ release channel with 1 nm ryanodine leads to a modest increase in ATP/ADP ratio in MIN6 cells after 2 h. This was not additive to the effects of high glucose (n = 3).

HIF-1β was recently shown to be the most significantly altered mRNA in islets from type 2 diabetic patients and was necessary for β-cell function in mice (17Gunton J.E. Kulkarni R.N. Yim S. Okada T. Hawthorne W.J. Tseng Y.H. Roberson R.S. Ricordi C. O'Connell P.J. Gonzalez F.J. Kahn C.R. Cell. 2005; 122: 337-349Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In human islets, blocking RyR with 100 μm ryanodine markedly increased HIF-1β protein levels (Fig. 6A). We also compared the role of IP3 receptors using the inhibitor xestospongin C and found that it did not alter HIF-1β levels in human islets. In MIN6 cells, blocking IP3R caused an increase in HIF-1β protein expression, whereas ryanodine had no consistent effect at this time point (Fig. 6B). Blocking SERCA with thapsigargin reduced HIF-1β expression in all cases. Together, these results indicate that when intracellular Ca2+ flux is compromised in β-cells a hypoxia-associated pathway is affected. We also directly examined the effects of different glucose concentrations on HIF-1β protein levels. The expression of HIF-1β was markedly induced at low glucose and suppressed at high glucose in MIN6 cells (Fig. 6C). ER Ca2+ Flux and Glucose Regulate in Presenilin—Studies in other cell types have implicated presenilins in the control of hypoxia-inducible factors and vice versa (25Lukiw W.J. Gordon W.C.

Neuroreport. 2004; 15: 2025-2028Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Microarray analysis of MIN6 cells treated with 100 μm ryanodine 6J. D. Johnson, unpublished data. pointed to the possibility that presenilin mRNA was increased when RyRs were blocked. To confirm the presence of presenilin proteins in β-cells, we performed immunofluorescent staining on MIN6 cells. Using deconvolution microscopy we observed that presenilin-1 was found in a punctate cytoplasmic and nuclear pattern in MIN6 cells (Fig. 7A) consistent with the observation that, in β-cells, presenilins are predominately found in the form of C-terminal fragments (see Fig. 8A below). Presenilin-2 was observed in a cytoplasmic pattern reminiscent of the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 7B). These findings are in agreement with the known subcellular location of presenilins in other cells types (35Lah J.J. Heilman C.J. Nash N.R. Rees H.D. Yi H. Counts S.E. Levey A.I. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1971-1980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Li J. Xu M. Zhou H. Ma J. Potter H. Cell. 1997; 90: 917-927Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). In human islets, reducing the glucose or blocking RyR dramatically increased presenilin-1 levels, whereas blocking IP3R or SERCA did not (Fig. 7, C and E). Presenilin-2 levels were not consistently altered in human islets by hypoglycemia or Ca2+ manipulation. In the MIN6 β-cell model, blocking either RyR or IP3R led to an increase in both presenilin-1 and presenilin-2 levels (Fig. 7F). This was observed at either 5 or 25 mm glucose (data not shown) and suggests that both channels play an im"
https://openalex.org/W2155398859,"Osteosarcoma is the most frequent primitive malignant tumor of the skeletal system, characterized by an extremely aggressive clinical course that still lacks an effective treatment. Src kinase seems to be involved in the osteosarcoma malignant phenotype. We show that the treatment of human osteosarcoma cell lines with a new pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine derivative Src inhibitor, namely SI-83, impaired cell viability, with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration of 12 microM in nonstarved cells and a kinetic different from that known for the Src inhibitor PP2. Analysis by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling, Hoechst, and flow cytometric assay showed that SI-83 induced apoptosis in SaOS-2 cells. Moreover, SI-83, by inhibiting Src phosphorylation, decreased in vivo osteosarcoma tumor mass in a mouse model. Finally, SI-83 showed selectivity for osteosarcoma, since it had a far lower effect in primary human osteoblasts. These results show that human osteosarcoma had Src-dependent proliferation and that modulation of Src activity may be a therapeutic target of this new compound with low toxicity for nonneoplastic cells."
https://openalex.org/W2062233743,"Actin cytoskeletal reorganization is essential for tumor cell migration, adhesion, and invasion. Cofilin and actin-depolymerizing factor (ADF) act as key regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics by stimulating depolymerization and severing of actin filaments. Cofilin/ADF are inactivated by phosphorylation of Ser-3 by LIM kinase-1 (LIMK1) and reactivated by dephosphorylation by Slingshot-1 (SSH1) and -2 (SSH2) protein phosphatases. In this study, we examined the roles of cofilin/ADF, LIMK1, and SSH1/SSH2 in tumor cell invasion, using an in vitro transcellular migration assay. In this assay, rat ascites hepatoma (MM1) cells were overlaid on a primary-cultured rat mesothelial cell monolayer and the number of cell foci that transmigrated underneath the monolayer in the presence of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) was counted. The knockdown of cofilin/ADF, LIMK1, or SSH1/SSH2 expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) significantly decreased the LPA-induced transcellular migration of MM1 cells and their motility in two-dimensional culture. Knockdown of LIMK1 also suppressed fibronectin-mediated cell attachment and focal adhesion formation. Our results suggest that both LIMK1-mediated phosphorylation and SSH1/SSH2-mediated dephosphorylation of cofilin/ADF are critical for the migration and invasion of tumor cells and that LIMK1 is involved in the transcellular migration of tumor cells by enhancing both adhesion and motility of the cells.

The most prominent features of malignant tumor cells are their invasive and metastatic capacities. Tumor metastasis proceeds by several sequential steps, including detachment from a primary tumor, invasion into surrounding tissues, intravasation, extravasation, and proliferation in distant organs (1Gupta G.P. Massagué J. Cell. 2006; 127: 679-695Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3288) Google Scholar). The transcellular migration of tumor cells through the host cell layers, such as the vascular endothelium and the mesothelium of the visceral cavity, is one of the critical steps for tumor cell invasion and metastasis, because these cell layers can act as a barrier against tumor cell invasion, intravasation, and extravasation. However, the mechanism underlying transcellular migration is not well understood. Because the regulation of actin cytoskeletal reorganization is essential for cell adhesion, motility, and morphological change, actin-modulating proteins and their upstream signaling molecules appear to play crucial roles in a variety of processes during tumor cell invasion and metastasis, including transcellular migration.

To examine the mechanisms of tumor cell invasion, an in vitro transcellular migration assay system has been developed (23Akedo H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Mori Y. Tateishi R. Tanaka K. Yamamoto R. Morishita T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2416-2422PubMed Google Scholar). In this assay, rat ascites hepatoma (AH130) cells are overlaid on a primary-cultured rat mesothelial cell monolayer and the number of AH130 cell colonies that penetrate the monolayer is counted. The invasive activity of AH130 cells determined by this in vitro system correlates well with the in vivo invasive capacity of the cells, as measured by implantation of the cells into the rat peritoneal cavity (24Mukai M. Shinkai K. Tateishi R. Mori Y. Akedo H. Cancer Res. 1987; 47: 2167-2171PubMed Google Scholar). Using this in vitro assay, previous studies have demonstrated that the transcellular migration of MM1 cells (a highly invasive clone derived from AH130 cells) through the mesothelial cell layer requires the presence of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and the activation of a Rho-ROCK signaling pathway (25Imamura F.

In this study, we have assessed the roles of cofilin/ADF, SSH1/SSH2, and LIMK1 in tumor cell invasion, using the in vitro transcellular migration assay. We show that suppression of cofilin/ADF, SSH1/SSH2, or LIMK1 expression by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) significantly reduces the transcellular migration of MM1 cells through the mesothelial cell monolayer as well as their motility in two-dimensional culture. We also show that knockdown of LIMK1, but not cofilin/ADF or SSH1/SSH2, inhibits the fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion of MM1 cells. These findings suggest that the proper regulation of cofilin/ADF activities by both LIMK1 and SSH1/SSH2 are critical for tumor cell invasion, and that LIMK1 is involved in the transcellular migration of MM1 cells by regulating both the adhesion and migration of tumor cells.

As a control, we used a nontargeting sequence, 5′-TCTTCCCCCAAGAAAGATA-3′, which does not exist in the rat genome. Cells and Cell Culture—MM1 cells, a highly invasive clone of rat ascites hepatoma AH130 cells (23Akedo H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Mori Y. Tateishi R. Tanaka K. Yamamoto R. Morishita T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2416-2422PubMed Google Scholar), were cultured in suspension in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Rat mesothelial cells were isolated from the mesentery of Donryu rats and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, as described (23Akedo H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Mori Y. Tateishi R. Tanaka K. Yamamoto R. Morishita T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2416-2422PubMed Google Scholar). The mesothelial cells and MM1 cells were cultured at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air. A monolayer of confluent mesothelial cells in a 35-mm dish was used for the transcellular migration assay. Plat-E cells were provided by Dr. T. Kitamura (University of Tokyo) and maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 μg/ml blasticidin (ICN Biochemicals, Irvine, CA), and 1 μg/ml puromycin (Sigma Aldrich) (33Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar). Transfection and Retrovirus Infection—To generate retroviral supernatants, Plat-E retrovirus packaging cells (33Morita S. Kojima T. Kitamura T. Gene Ther. 2000; 7: 1063-1066Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) were transfected with pLNCX-neo or pSUPER.retro.puro plasmids using FuGENE6 (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). At 48 h after transfection, the culture medium was centrifuged, and the viral supernatant was used for infection after the addition of 8 μg/ml polybrene. Infected MM1 cells were cultured for 24 h, washed, and selected by culturing for 48 h with 2 μg/ml puromycin for cells infected with pSUPER.retro.puro retrovirus or for 2 weeks with 250 μg/ml G418 (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) for cells infected with pLNCX retrovirus. Transcellular Migration Assay (In Vitro Invasion Assay)—The transcellular migration assay was performed, as described previously (23Akedo H. Shinkai K. Mukai M. Mori Y. Tateishi R. Tanaka K. Yamamoto R. Morishita T. Cancer Res. 1986; 46: 2416-2422PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, MM1 cells (2 × 105 cells) were seeded over a rat mesothelial cell monolayer and cultured in DMEM with or without 25 μm LPA (Sigma Aldrich). After incubation for 20 h, the supernatant was removed, and the resultant mesothelial cell monolayer and infiltrated MM1 cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde. The number of penetrated single tumor cells and tumor cell colonies (collectively called infiltrated cell foci) was counted with a phase-contrast microscope in 10 different visual fields (0.95-mm2 each). The in vitro transcellular migration activity was quantitatively determined as the number of infiltrated cell foci/dish. Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblot Analyses—Cell lysates were prepared and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described previously (12Nishita M. Aizawa H. Mizuno K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). To analyze endogenous LIMK1, the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-LIMK1 antibody before immunoblot analysis (30Okano I. Hiraoka J. Otera H. Nunoue K. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Hirai M. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31321-31330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Cell Adhesion Assay—MM1 cells (2 × 105 cells) cultured in suspension were washed twice with DMEM, suspended in 500 μl of DMEM containing 2.4% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and seeded onto 24-well uncoated dishes or dishes precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin (Sigma Aldrich). After incubation at 37 °C for 30 min in the presence of 25 μm LPA, the medium was carefully removed and the wells were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. The cells attached to the dish were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and stained with 0.2% crystal violet in 1% ethanol. After the wells were rinsed three times with water, the dye was extracted with 0.1 m sodium citrate in 50% ethanol, and the absorbance at 550 nm was measured by a microplate spectrophotometer (Bio-Rad). Focal Adhesion Formation Assay—MM1 cells were plated on coverslips precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin, cultured for 30 min, and then stimulated with 25 μm LPA for 1 h. Cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min, blocked with 5 mg/ml BSA for 1 h, and stained with anti-vinculin monoclonal antibody. Fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG was used as the second antibody. Stacked optical sections were obtained and measured using a laser scanning confocal imaging system (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss) equipped with a ×63 oil immersion objective lens. Cells displaying at least one distinct adhesion site were scored positive. Cell Migration Assay—The cell migration assay was performed using a Transwell culture chamber (8-μm pore size, Corning, New York, NY). The Transwell membrane was precoated with 10 μg/ml fibronectin, and the lower wells were filled with 600 μl of DMEM containing 2.4% BSA. MM1 cells (2 × 105 cells), suspended in 100 μl of DMEM containing 2.4% BSA, were loaded into the upper wells. LPA (25 μm) was added to both the lower and upper wells or to neither. After incubation for 3 h at 37 °C, the cells that had migrated into the lower wells were fixed and stained with crystal violet. The number of cells migrating to lower chamber was counted. Time-lapse Analysis—To analyze cell motility in two-dimensional culture, MM1 cells were seeded on fibronectin-coated glass-bottom dishes in DMEM containing 2.4% BSA and placed in a temperature- and CO2-controlled chamber of a microscope (TSC SP2, Leica) equipped with a ×40 objective lens. Images were collected every 1 min for up to 180 min after LPA stimulation. To trace the migration paths, cells were manually traced for each frame and geographical centers were recorded using Image J (NIH). The data were plotted with Microsoft Excel. Knockdown of Cofilin/ADF Suppresses Tumor Cell Invasion—To examine the role of cofilin and ADF in tumor cell invasion, we suppressed the expression of endogenous cofilin and ADF in MM1 rat ascites hepatoma cells with retrovirus-assisted siRNAs and analyzed the effects of their knockdown on the in vitro transcellular migration activity of MM1 cells. MM1 cells were infected with retrovirus coding for the siRNA sequences targeting rat cofilin or ADF, and the infected cells were selected by puromycin. Infection with cofilin and ADF siRNA retrovirus substantially reduced the expression of endogenous cofilin and ADF, respectively, in MM1 cells (Fig. 1A). The invasive capacity of MM1 cells was analyzed by an in vitro transcellular migration assay, in which MM1 cells were loaded on the cultured rat mesothelial cell monolayer and incubated for 20 h in the presence or absence of LPA, and the number of MM1 cell foci infiltrated into the monolayer was counted. Fig. 1B shows the phase-contrast image of control MM1 cells penetrated into the monolayer in the presence of LPA. Fig. 1C summarizes the quantitative data of the transcellular migration assays. As described previously (25Imamura F. Horai T. Mukai M. Shinkai K. Sawada M. Akedo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 497-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), LPA was required for the transcellular migration of MM1 cells (Fig. 1C). Whereas knockdown of cofilin or ADF individually had no apparent effect on the invasive activity of MM1 cells, knockdown of cofilin and ADF together significantly reduced the number of infiltrated cells, as compared with the cells infected with the control siRNA (Fig. 1C). These results indicate that cofilin/ADF proteins are critical for the invasive activity of MM1 cells. Expression of chick cofilin or ADF, whose expression was not affected by siRNAs targeting rat cofilin or ADF, partially blocked the inhibitory effect of cofilin/ADF double knockdown on the invasive activity of MM1 cells (Fig. 1D), indicating that the effects of cofilin/ADF siRNAs are due to the suppression of cofilin/ADF expression. Knockdown of SSH1/SSH2 Suppresses Tumor Cell Invasion—To investigate the role of SSH1/SSH2-mediated cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation in tumor cell invasion, we analyzed the effects of SSH1/SSH2 knockdown on the transcellular migration of MM1 cells. Infection with retrovirus coding for SSH1 and SSH2 siRNAs reduced the expression of endogenous SSH1 and SSH2, respectively (Fig. 2A). The P-cofilin/P-ADF levels increased in cells expressing SSH1/SSH2 siRNAs, compared with cells expressing control siRNA (supplemental Fig. S1), which suggests that SSH1/SSH2 are involved in cofilin/ADF dephosphorylation in MM1 cells. Whereas knockdown of SSH1 had no apparent effect on the transcellular migration of MM1 cells, knockdown of SSH2 slightly suppressed transmigration and double knockdown of SSH1 and SSH2 more evidently suppressed the transmigration (Fig. 2B). In MM1 cell lines stably expressing CFP-hSSH1 or mSSH2-CFP, whose expression was not affected by rat SSH1/SSH2 siRNA, double knockdown of rat SSH1/SSH2 did not affect the invasive activity of MM1 cells (Fig. 2B). Thus, the siRNA-resistant hSSH1 and mSSH2 have the potential to restore the invasive activity of SSH1/SSH2 siRNA cells, indicating that the effects of SSH1/SSH2 siRNAs are due to the suppression of endogenous SSH1/SSH2 expression. These findings suggest that SSH1 and SSH2 are required for the invasive activity of MM1 cells and that they can function redundantly in the invasion of MM1 cells. LIMK1 Is Critical for Tumor Cell Invasion—To examine the role of LIMK1 in the invasive activity of MM1 cells, we analyzed the effect of LIMK1 knockdown on the transcellular migration of MM1 cells. Infection with retrovirus coding for LIMK1 siRNA suppressed the expression of endogenous LIMK1 in MM1 cells (Fig. 3A). The transcellular migration assay revealed that knockdown of LIMK1 markedly suppressed the invasive activity of MM1 cells (Fig. 3B). The LIMK1 siRNA-induced inhibition of the invasive activity was significantly attenuated in MM1 cells stably expressing hLIMK1(WT)-CFP, which was unaffected by rat LIMK1 siRNA (Fig. 3B). In contrast, coexpression of a kinase-dead hLIMK1(D460A)-CFP with LIMK1 siRNA further suppressed the invasive activity of MM1 cells (Fig. 3B). Supplemental Fig. S2 shows the expression and kinase activity of hLIMK1(WT)-CFP and hLIMK1(D460A)-CFP. These results indicate that LIMK1 plays a critical role in the invasive activity of MM1 cells and LIMK1(D460A) functions as a dominant-negative form. To further examine whether the kinase activity of LIMK1 is required for tumor cell invasion, we analyzed the effect of a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of LIMK1 (S3 peptide) on the invasive activity of MM1 cells. The S3 peptide is composed of the N-terminal sequence of cofilin, which contains the phosphorylation site (Ser-3), and the cell-permeable sequence motif of penetratin (12Nishita M. Aizawa H. Mizuno K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 774-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). As a control, the reverse (RV) peptide containing the reverse sequence of cofilin and the penetratin sequence was also tested. Treatment with S3 peptide, but not RV peptide, reduced the P-cofilin/P-ADF levels in MM1 cells (supplemental Fig. S3), indicating that S3 peptide inhibits the kinase activity of LIMK1 in MM1 cells. In the transcellular migration assay, treatment of MM1 cells with S3 peptide, but not RV peptide, significantly decreased the number of the infiltrated cells, as compared with the untreated cells (Fig. 3C). These results further indicate that the kinase activity of LIMK1 is required for the invasive activity of MM1 cells. LIMK1 Is Critical for Fibronectin-mediated Cell Adhesion and Focal Adhesion Formation—A previous study showed that fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion is required for the transcellular migration of MM1 cells through the mesothelial cell layer (34Ayaki M. Mukai M. Imamura F. Iwasaki T. Mammoto T. Shinkai K. Nakamura H. Akedo H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To elucidate the mechanisms by which cofilin/ADF, SSH1/SSH2, and LIMK1 facilitate the transcellular migration of MM1 cells, we analyzed the effects of knockdowns of these proteins on the fibronectin-mediated cell adhesive activity of MM1 cells. MM1 cells infected with siRNAs targeting cofilin/ADF, SSH1/SSH2, or LIMK1 were seeded on uncoated or fibronectin-coated dishes, and incubated for 30 min. After washing, the number of cells attached to the dishes was estimated by crystal-violet staining. Fibronectin was required for the attachment of MM1 cells to the dishes (Fig. 4A). Whereas knockdowns of cofilin/ADF or SSH1/SSH2 had no apparent effect on the fibronectin-mediated adhesion of MM1 cells, knockdown of LIMK1 significantly decreased the number of cells that adhered to the fibronectin-coated dish (Fig. 4A). These data indicate that LIMK1, but not cofilin/ADF or SSH1/SSH2, is critically involved in fibronectin-mediated cell adhesion. Stimulation of MM1 cells with LPA induces the formation of focal adhesions (34Ayaki M. Mukai M. Imamura F. Iwasaki T. Mammoto T. Shinkai K. Nakamura H. Akedo H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 40-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To investigate the role of LIMK1 in focal adhesion formation, MM1 cells infected with control or LIMK1 siRNAs were cultured on fibronectin-coated dishes, stimulated with LPA for 1 h, and stained with anti-vinculin antibody. In control siRNA cells, both the number and size of vinculin-positive focal adhesions increased in response to LPA stimulation (Fig. 4B, upper panels). In contrast, in LIMK1 siRNA cells, no increase in vinculin staining was observed after LPA stimulation (Fig. 4B, lower panels). Quantitative analysis of the number of cells possessing vinculin-positive foci revealed that LIMK1 knockdown significantly suppressed LPA-induced focal adhesion formation in MM1 cells (Fig. 4C). These observations suggest that LIMK1 plays a crucial role in LPA-induced focal adhesion formation in MM1 cells. Cofilin/ADF, SSH1/SSH2, and LIMK1 Are Critical for Cell Motility and Morphological Change—We next examined the effects of cofilin/ADF, SSH1/SSH2, and LIMK1 knockdowns on the motility of MM1 cells using Transwell culture chambers. MM1 cells infected with retrovirus coding for each siRNA were seeded on the fibronectin-coated upper chamber and the number of cells that migrated into the lower chamber was counted after a 3-h incubation in the presence or absence of LPA in both chambers. In control siRNA cells, LPA stimulation increased the number of cells migrating into the lower chamber by about 35-fold (Fig. 5A). Knockdowns of SSH1/SSH2, LIMK1, and cofilin/ADF by siRNAs reduced the level of LPA-induced cell migration to 79, 51, and 51%, respectively, of that of the LPA-stimulated control siRNA cells (Fig. 5A),"
https://openalex.org/W2115456158,"In response to DNA damage, p73 plays a critical role in cell fate determination. In this study, we have found that Plk1 (polo-like kinase 1) associates with p73, phosphorylates p73 at Thr-27, and thereby inhibits its pro-apoptotic activity. During cisplatin-mediated apoptosis in COS7 cells in which the endogenous p53 is inactivated by SV40 large T antigen, p73 was induced to accumulate in association with a significant down-regulation of Plk1. Consistent with these observations, Plk1 reduced the stability of the endogenous p73. Immunoprecipitation and in vitro pulldown assay demonstrated that p73 binds to the kinase domain of Plk1 through its NH2-terminal region. Luciferase reporter assay and reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that Plk1 is able to block the p73-mediated transcriptional activation. Of note, kinase-deficient Plk1 mutant (Plk1(K82M)) retained an ability to interact with p73; however, it failed to inactivate the p73-mediated transcriptional activation, suggesting that kinase activity of Plk1 is required for the inhibition of p73. Indeed, in vitro kinase assay indicated that p73 is phosphorylated at Thr-27 by Plk1. Furthermore, small interference RNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous Plk1 in p53-deficient H1299 cells resulted in a significant increase in the number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content accompanied by the up-regulation of p73 and pro-apoptotic p53AIP1 as well as the proteolytic cleavage of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Thus, our present results suggest that Plk1-mediated dysfunction of p73 is one of the novel molecular mechanisms to inhibit the p53-independent apoptosis, and the inhibition of Plk1 might provide an attractive therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment.

Like the other p53 family members, p73 encodes multiple isoforms, including TA (transactivating), with distinct COOH-terminal extensions arising from alternative splicing events and ΔN (nontransactivating) variants generated by alternative promoter usage (2Melino G.

Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 3598-3602PubMed Google Scholar) and displays a dominant-negative behavior toward TAp73 as well as wild-type p53 (6Pozniak C.D. Radinovic S. Yang A. McKeon F. Kaplan D.R. Miller F.D. Science. 2000; 289: 304-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). TAp73 transactivates overlapping set of p53-target genes implicated in the induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, and plays an important role in the regulation of DNA damage response, which is closely linked to its DNA binding activity. The initial studies demonstrated that TAp73 does not induce enough to accumulate in response to DNA damage arising from UV exposure or actinomycin D treatment (1Kaghad M. Bonnet H. Yang A. Creancier L. Biscan J.C. Valent A. Minty A. Chalon P. Lelias J.M. Dumont X. Ferrara P. McKeon F. Caput D.

Further studies revealed that CDDP-mediated apoptosis is associated with phosphorylation of TAp73 at Ser-47 catalyzed by Chk1 (12Gonzalez S. Prives C. Cordon-Cordo C. Mol. Cell.

It has been shown that Plk1 is overexpressed in a variety of human tumors as compared with their corresponding normal tissues (20Ando K. Ozaki T. Yamamoto H. Furuya K. Hosoda M. Hayashi S.

In support with this notion, knockdown of the endogenous Plk1 induces G2/M cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis in various cell lines (23Spankuch-Schmitt B. Bereiter-Hahn J. Kaufmann M. Strebhardt K.

In this study, we have found that Plk1 has an ability to bind to and phosphorylate TAp73 at Thr-27, thereby inhibiting its transcriptional as well as pro-apoptotic activity. Cell Lines and Transfection—African green monkey kidney COS7, human osteosarcoma SAOS-2, U2OS, and human cervical carcinoma HeLa cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 50 μg/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen). Human lung carcinoma H1299 cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus antibiotics mixture. These cells were cultured in a 5% CO2 environment at 37 °C. Where indicated, cells were exposed to CDDP (Sigma). For transient transfection, COS7 and H1299 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of the expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 transfection reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used as a blank plasmid to balance the amount of DNA introduced in transient transfection. RNA Extraction and RT-PCR—Total RNA was prepared from the indicated cells by using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol and reverse-transcribed. The specific primers used were as follows: p73α, 5′-TCTGGAACCAGACAGCACCT-3′ and 5′-GTGCTGGACTGCTGGAAAGT-3′; p21WAF1, 5′-ATGAAATTCACCCCCTTTCC-3′ and 5′-CCCTAGGCTGTGCTCACTTC-3′; BAX, 5′-TTTGCTTCAGGGTTTCATCC-3′ and 5′-CAGTTGAAGTTGCCGTCAGA-3′; MDM2, 5′-ACTTGAGCCGAGGAGTTCAA-3′ and 5′-TTGCTCTGTCACCTGGACTG-3′; Plk1, 5′-ATCACCTGCCTGACCATTCCACCAAGG-3′ and 5′-AATTGCGGAAATATTTAAGGAGGGTGATCT-3′; p53AIP1, 5′-GATCTTCCTCTGAGGCGAGCT-3′ and 5′-TTACCCAGCCAGGTGTGTGT-3′; and GAPDH, 5′-ACCTGACCTGCCGTCTAGAA-3′ and 5′-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA-3′. The expression of GAPDH was measured as an internal control. Immunoblotting—Whole cells lysates were prepared by incubating cells in lysis buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 137 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 1% Triton X-100 and a commercial protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma) for 30 min on ice and subjected to a brief sonication for 10 s at 4 °C followed by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm at 4 °C for 10 min to remove insoluble materials. The protein concentrations were measured using the Bradford protein assay according to the manufacturer's instructions (Bio-Rad). The equal amounts of protein (50 μg) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore, Bedford, MA). The transferred membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk and 0.1% Tween 20 at 4 °C overnight. After blocking, the membranes were incubated with monoclonal anti-p73 (Ab-4; NeoMarkers, Fremont, CA), monoclonal anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), monoclonal anti-Plk1 (PL2 and PL6; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), monoclonal anti-PARP (F-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), polyclonal anti-p300 (H-272; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or with polyclonal anti-actin (20Ando K.

After incubation with primary antibodies, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) for 1 h at room temperature. Immunoblots were visualized by ECL detection reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). Immunoprecipitation—HeLa cells were treated with CDDP at a final concentration of 20 μm. Twenty-four hours after CDDP treatment, whole cell lysates (1 mg of protein) were pre-cleared with 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads and used for immunoprecipitation with the appropriate antibodies. After the addition of 30 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads, incubations were continued for additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were then collected by centrifugation and washed three times with the lysis buffer. The precipitated proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with the appropriate antibodies as described. GST Pulldown Assay—cDNA fragments encoding the indicated deletion mutants of p73α were generated by PCR-based strategy, and subcloned into GST fusion protein expression plasmid pGEX-4T-3 (Amersham Biosciences). GST and GST-p73α fusion proteins were expressed and purified by glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). FLAG-Plk1 was radiolabeled in vitro by using TnT QuickCoupled transcription/translation system (Promega, Madison, WI) in the presence of [35S]methionine and incubated with GST or GST-p73α deletion mutants for 2 h at 4 °C. After the addition of 30 μl of glutathione-Sepharose beads into the reaction mixture, incubations were continued for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 1 mm EDTA. The 35S-labeled bound proteins were eluted by 2× SDS sample buffer and separated by 10% SDS-PAGE. After electrophoresis, the gel was dried and exposed to an x-ray film with an intensifying screen. Indirect Immunofluorescence Staining—HeLa cells were fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature, permeabilized in 0.2% Triton X-100 for 5 min at room temperature, and then blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After blocking, cells were washed in PBS and incubated with polyclonal anti-p73 antibody (H-79; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and monoclonal anti-Plk1 antibody for 1 h at room temperature, followed by the incubation with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG and rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room temperature. Cell nuclei were stained with DAPI. Flow Cytometry—After transfection, both floating and attached cells were collected by low speed centrifugation, washed in PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol at -20 °C overnight. The cells were then stained with propidium iodide (50 μg/ml) in the presence of 50 μg/ml RNase A for 30 min at room temperature. The DNA content indicated by propidium iodide staining was analyzed by FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Luciferase Reporter Assay—p53-deficient H1299 cells were plated in 12-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well and transiently co-transfected with a constant amount of a luciferase reporter construct driven by p53/p73-responsive element derived from p21WAF1, Mdm2, or Bax promoter, Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-TK), and the HA-p73α expression plasmid together with or without the increasing amounts of the expression plasmid for Plk1. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were lysed, and their luciferase activities were measured by dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). The firefly luminescence signal was normalized based on the Renilla luminescence signal. Each experiment was performed at least three times in triplicate. Apoptotic Assay—H1299 cells were transfected with the indicated combinations of the expression plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were washed in PBS, fixed in 3.7% formaldehyde for 1 h at room temperature, and then permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min on ice. The cell nuclei were stained by DAPI. The number of GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei was counted. Construction of Mutant Forms of GST-p73α-(1–130)—To identify possible phosphorylation site(s) of p73α mediated by Plk1, the T27A mutation was introduced into the GST-p73α-(1–130) using PfuUltra™ high fidelity DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Details are available upon request. Nucleotide sequences of the PCR products were determined to verify the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of random mutations. In Vitro Kinase Reaction—To identify the possible Thr residue(s) of p73α that could be phosphorylated by Plk1, we used CycLex Polo-like kinase 1 assay kit (CycLex, Nagano, Japan) (29Liu Y. Shreder K.R. Gai W. Corral S. Ferris D.K. Rosenblum J.S. Chem. Biol. 2005; 12: 99-107Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). In brief, the purified Plk1 was added to the reaction mixture containing 50 μm ATP and polyclonal anti-phospho-Thr antibody and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After the incubation, horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody was mixed with the reaction mixture and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Finally, GST or the indicated GST-p73α deletion mutants dissolved in substrate solution were added into the reaction mixture and incubated for 5 min at room temperature, followed by the measurement of absorbance in each well using a spectrophotometric plate reader at dual wavelength of 450/540 nm. As a positive control, we used protein X that was supplied by the manufacturer. RNA Interference—To knock down the endogenous Plk1, H1299 cells were transiently transfected with the chemically synthesized siRNA targeting Plk1 or with the control siRNA (Dharmacon, Chicago) using Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Total RNA and whole cell lysates were prepared 48 h after transfection. siRNA-mediated Knockdown of Plk1 Results in a Massive Apoptosis—To ask whether Plk1 could protect cells from p53-independent apoptosis, p53-deficient human lung carcinoma H1299 cells were transfected with control siRNA or with siRNA against Plk1. As shown in Fig. 1A, Plk1 was successfully knocked down under our experimental conditions. The expression levels of p73α remained unchanged. Of note, the expression levels of pro-apoptotic p53AIP1, which is one o the p53/p73 target genes, were significantly induced in Plk1-knocked down cells. Immunoblot analysis clearly demonstrated that the proteolytic cleavage of PARP, which is one of the substrates of the activated caspase-3 (30Niizuma T. Nakamura Y. Ozaki T. Nakanishi H. Ohira M. Isogai E. Kageyama H. Imaizumi M. Nakagawara A. Oncogene. 2006; 26: 5046-5055Crossref Scopus (65) Google Scholar), is observed in Plk1-knocked down cells in association with a significant induction of pro-apoptotic p73α (Fig. 1B). FACS analysis revealed that siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous Plk1 causes a remarkable increase in number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content relative to control cells (Fig. 1C). Similar results were also obtained in H1299 cells transfected with other siRNAs against Plk1 (data not shown), suggesting that Plk1 might have an inhibitory effect on p73-mediated apoptosis. Similar results were also obtained in p53-proficient U2OS cells as well as p53-deficient SAOS-2 cells (supplemental Fig. S1). Thus, it is likely that siRNA-mediated knockdown of the endogenous Plk1 induces apoptosis regardless of p53 status. These findings showing that siRNA-mediated knockdown of Plk1 leads to a significant induction of the endogenous p73α at protein level prompted us to examine whether Plk1 could affect the protein stability of p73. For this purpose, H1299 cells were co-transfected with the constant amount of the expression plasmid for HA-p73α together with or without the increasing amounts of FLAG-Plk1 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 2A, left panel, Plk1 had undetectable effect on the expression levels of p73α mRNA. On the other hand, immunoblotting analysis revealed that Plk1 reduces the amounts of HA-p73α (Fig. 2A, right panel). Intriguingly, Plk1-mediated reduction of HA-p73α was not recovered in the presence of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also obtained in cells exposed to lactacystin (data not shown). In addition, enforced expression of FLAG-Plk1 significantly reduced the amounts of the endogenous p73α at protein level but not at the mRNA level (Fig. 2C). As described previously (31Hosoda M. Ozaki T. Miyazaki K. Hayashi S. Furuya K. Watanabe K. Nakagawa T. Hanamoto T. Todo S. Nakagawara A. Oncogene. 2005; 24: 7156-7169Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar), CDDP treatment led to a stabilization of the endogenous p73α in COS7 cells, whereas the endogenous Plk1 was down-regulated in response to CDDP accompanied by the induction of apoptosis (Fig. 3, A–C), indicating that there exists an inverse relationship between the expression levels of Plk1 and p73α in response to CDDP and that Plk1 might promote proteolytic degradation of p73α in a proteasome-independent manner. Furthermore, enforced expression of Plk1 decreased the sensitivity to CDDP in association with the reduction of CDDP-mediated proteolytic cleavage of PARP (supplemental Fig. S2). Plk1 Inhibits p73-mediated Transcriptional Activation and Pro-apoptotic Function—To address whether Plk1 could suppress the transcriptional activity of p73, we performed the luciferase reporter assays. H1299 cells were co-transfected with the constant amount of the expression plasmid for HA-p73α, the luciferase reporter construct carrying p53/p73-responsive p21WAF1, BAX, or MDM2 promoter, and Renilla luciferase cDNA (pRL-TK) together with or without the increasing amounts of FLAG-Plk1 expression plasmid. As shown in Fig. 4, A–C, enforced expression of FLAG-Plk1 significantly reduced the luciferase activities driven by the indicated promoters in a dose-dependent manner. Consistent with these results, HA-p73α-mediated up-regulation of the endogenous p21WAF1, BAX, and MDM2 mRNAs was abrogated by FLAG-Plk1 (Fig. 4D), suggesting that Plk1 has an ability to repress the transcriptional activity of p73α. To examine a possible effect of Plk1 on pro-apoptotic activity of p73, we carried out apoptotic assay. H1299 cells were co-transfected with the indicated combinations of the expression plasmids. Consistent with the previous observations (32Zeng X. Chen L. Jost C.A. Maya R. Keller D. Wang X. Kaelin Jr., W.G. Oren M. Chen J. Lu H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 3257-3266Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar), HA-p73α alone increased number of cells with apoptotic nuclei (Fig. 5A). As expected, FLAG-Plk1 had an ability to decrease GFP-positive cells with apoptotic nuclei caused by exogenous expression of HA-p73α. In accordance with these results, FACS analysis demonstrated that HA-p73α-mediated increase in number of cells with sub-G1 DNA content is inhibited by co-expression with FLAG-Plk1 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B), indicating that Plk1 suppresses the p73α-mediated apoptotic cell death. Interaction between Plk1 and p73 in Cells—To address whether Plk1 could associate with p73 in cells, we examined their subcellular distributions in response to CDDP. Human"

Although these compounds have markedly different molecular skeletons, their biosynthetic pathways share the same intermediate “compound X,” which is produced from l-tryptophan via indole-3-pyruvic acid imine. Compound X is a short-lived intermediate that is spontaneously converted to chromopyrrolic acid for indolocarbazole biosynthesis, whereas VioE transforms compound X into protodeoxyviolaceinic acid, which is further modified by other enzymes to produce violacein. Thus, VioE plays a key role in the construction of the molecular skeleton of violacein. Here, we present the crystal structure of VioE, which consists of two subunits, each of which forms a structure resembling a baseball glove. Each subunit has a positively charged pocket at the center of the concave surface of the structure. Mutagenesis analysis of the surface pocket and other surface residues showed that the surface pocket serves as an active site. We have also solved the crystal structure of a complex of VioE and phenylpyruvic acid as an analogue of a VioE-substrate complex. A docking simulation with VioE and the IPA imine dimer, which is proposed to be compound X, agreed with the results from the mutational analysis and the VioE-phenylpyruvic acid complex structure. Based on these results, we propose that VioE traps the highly reactive substrate within the surface pocket to suppress CPA formation and promote protodeoxyviolaceinic acid formation caused by proximity and orientation effects.

Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). After this process is completed, compound X is spontaneously converted into chromopyrrolic acid (CPA), a precursor of staurosporine (6Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In vivo and in vitro studies of the violacein biosynthetic pathway suggest that the novel enzyme VioE catalytically rearranges the skeleton of compound X to produce the short-lived intermediate product, protodeoxyviolaceinic acid (PVA), which is finally converted into violacein by other violacein biosynthesis enzymes (11Shinoda K. Hasegawa T. Sato H. Shinozaki M. Kuramoto H. Takamiya Y. Sato T. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Hoshino T. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2007; 28: 4140-4142Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). PVA is unstable in the presence of O2, and it is quickly converted into a dead end product prodeoxyviolacein (PDV) by autoxidation (Fig. 1). Furthermore, VioE does not catalyze the conversion of CPA into PVA and PDV (12Hoshino T. Kojima Y. Hayashi T. Uchiyama T. Kaneko K. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1993; 57: 775-781Crossref Scopus (45) Google Scholar). VioE is thus regarded as a key enzyme that “switches” the biosynthetic pathway through an intramolecular 1,2-shift of an indole ring. Interestingly, even though it catalyzes a major conversion of the molecular scaffold of the substrate, VioE does not require coenzymes or metals. indole-3-pyruvic acid chromopyrrolic acid protodeoxyviolaceinic acid prodeoxyviolacein phenylpyruvic acid dithiothreitol nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid selenomethionine. indole-3-pyruvic acid chromopyrrolic acid protodeoxyviolaceinic acid prodeoxyviolacein phenylpyruvic acid dithiothreitol nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid selenomethionine. Although a number of biochemical studies have examined the mechanisms underlying violacein biosynthesis, the detailed reaction mechanism of the VioE-mediated conversion of compound X to PVA remains to be elucidated. To address this issue, we have determined the crystal structure of VioE. This enzyme adopts a dimer structure with a positively charged pocket on the surface of each subunit. Mutagenesis analysis of the surface pocket as well as other surface residues suggested that the pocket serves as the active site of VioE. To examine the catalytic mechanism of VioE, we solved the crystal structure of the complex of VioE and phenylpyruvic acid (PPA) as a stable mimic of the VioE-substrate complex. In addition, we performed a docking simulation for VioE and the IPA imine dimer. Expression and Purification of VioE for Crystallization—The gene encoding C. violaceum VioE was amplified in a PCR using pETvioE (8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as a template and a pair of primers (forward, 5′-CGCCATATGGAAAACCGGGAACCGCC-3′; reverse, 5′-CGCGGATCCCTACTAGCGCTTGGCGGCGAAG-3′) and cloned using the TOPO-TA cloning system (Invitrogen). After sequencing, the amplified fragment was inserted into the NdeI-BamHI site of the pET-15b vector (Novagen). Protein expression in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells cultured in 2×YT medium was induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside when the A600 nm reached 0.4. After a 16-h incubation at 28 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C (Hitachi, Himac CR 22G). The pellets were resuspended in suspension buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) containing 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science; 2 tablets/100 ml) and sonicated (Branson Sonifier 250). After centrifugation (35,000 × g, 60 min), the supernatants were collected and loaded onto Ni-NTA Super-flow resin (Qiagen). After washing with 10 column volumes of suspension buffer, the buffer in the column was replaced with thrombin reaction buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol) containing thrombin protease (Novagen) to remove the His6 tag. After 16 h of incubation at 20 °C, VioE without the His tag was eluted using the suspension buffer. The VioE fractions were collected and further purified on a monoQ HR 16/10 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mm DTT; elution was performed with a 0-0.2 m NaCl gradient. E. coli BL21(DE3)-Codonplus RIL-X cells were used to express SeMet-substituted VioE. The cells were grown in LeMaster medium supplemented with 25 mg/l-seleno-l-methionine (Wako Pure Chemicals) (13LeMaster D.M. Richards F.M. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 7263-7268Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 14Hendrickson W.A. Horton J.R. Lemaster D.M. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1665-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar). Expression and Purification of VioE for the Enzymatic Assay—Wild-type VioE and the mutant protein variants used for the enzymatic activity assay were expressed as C-terminally hexa-histidine-tagged fusion proteins as previously described (8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Recombinant protein purification was performed using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and 100 μl of Ni-NTA (Qiagen) resin bed in a spin column container (Centri-Sep, Princeton Separations). The cells harvested from 4 ml of E. coli culture were washed with buffer A (50 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole at pH 7.4). The cells were resuspended in 500 μl of buffer A and sonicated. After centrifugation (15,000 rpm, 20 min, 4 °C), 400 μl of supernatant was applied to the spin column, mixed with the Ni-NTA resin, and incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation (2,000 rpm, 1 min, 4 °C) to remove undesired proteins, the matrix was washed with an additional 600 μl of buffer A and recentrifuged. Then 500 μl of buffer B (50 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 300 mm imidazole at pH 7.4) was added, and the samples were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C. After the incubation, the columns were centrifuged to elute the protein. The eluted proteins were dialyzed three times in buffer D (50 mm KH2PO4, 300 mm NaCl, and 0.1 mm DTT at pH 7.4) to yield the purified VioE samples. The concentrations of VioE were determined using the Bradford method (Protein assay kit I, Nippon Bio-Rad). Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Determination—The purified VioE was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4) and 1 mm DTT and then concentrated to 16 mg ml-1. VioE (14 mg ml-1) was crystallized using the sitting drop, vapor diffusion method. Single crystals were obtained using 6% PEG 4000 and 0.1 m citrate (pH 3.5) as a reservoir solution at 20 °C. To obtain a complex crystal with the IPA analogue PPA, the native VioE crystals were soaked with the harvest solution containing PPA (8% PEG 4000, 1 mm PPA, 5% Me2SO, and 0.1 m citrate at pH 3.5) for 24 h at 20 °C. The SeMet derivative was purified and crystallized in essentially the same way as the native protein. Native, SeMet-labeled, and PPA complex crystals were cryo-protected in 30% xylitol, 8% PEG 4000, and 0.1 m citrate at pH 3.5. Data from the native crystal were collected to 2.0 Å, and anomalous data for the SeMet-substituted crystal were collected to 2.1 Å at the SPring-8 beamlines BL41XU and BL44B2. The data were processed with HKL2000 (15Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38527) Google Scholar). The experimental phases were determined using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method and the program SOLVE/RESOLVE (16Terwilliger T.C. Berendzen J. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1999; 55: 849-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (3219) Google Scholar). Because of poor isomorphism between the native and the SeMet-labeled crystals (Table 1), the initial structure was modeled using the electron density data derived from the anomalous data, and a partial model was generated using RESOLVE. The initial structure was then used as a search model for molecular replacement with the native data set and MOLREP from CCP4 (17Computational Project, Number 4 CollaborativeActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar). The native structure was refined with the native datasets using LAFIRE (18Yao M. Zhou Y. Tanaka I. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2006; 62: 189-196Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), REFMAC5 from CCP4 (17Computational Project, Number 4 CollaborativeActa Crystallogr. Sect.

Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23229) Google Scholar). The complex structure with PPA was determined and refined using REFMAC5 from CCP4 (17Computational Project, Number 4 CollaborativeActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M.

As we were completing the model, TLS refinement with REFMAC5 (17Computational Project, Number 4 CollaborativeActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) was also carried out for both the native and PPA complex structures. The crystallographic and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The figures were drawn with PyMOL (21DeLano W.L. The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System.

Open table in a new tab Mutagenesis Analysis—Twenty VioE mutant proteins were constructed: Y17F, S19A, W21A, C35S, F50A, N51A, P52A, R61A, E66A, K77A, R84A, F109A, R140A, K143A, M160A, T162A, S170A, R172A, R172Q, and F174A. The mutations were introduced using a QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) and the pETvioE plasmid (8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar) as a template. The F174A mutant protein was not used for further analysis because of aggregation during the purification process. In the presence of StaD and VioE, IPA imine is converted into PDV via compound X and PVA (Fig. 1). Thus, the activities of wild-type and mutant VioE were measured by examining the formation of PDV using analytical HPLC. The reaction solution contained 300 nm VioE, 20 nm StaD (9Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Furumai T. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2006; 47: 473-475Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar), 1 mm IPA, 100 mm (NH4)2SO4, and 0.1 mm DTT in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.0. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, the enzymes were inactivated by the addition of 1% trifluoroacetic acid. Reaction mixtures were extracted three times with ethyl acetate, and the extracts were analyzed using HPLC at 610 nm, which is the maximum absorption wavelength of PDV. HPLC analysis was performed using an HP1100 system (Hewlett Packard) and a Cosmosil column (inner diameter, 4.6 mm; length, 250 mm; Nacalai Tesque). The temperature was set at 30 °C, and the flow rate was 1 ml/min. The solvent was acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in H2O. Elution was performed for 30 min using a 20-90% linear gradient of acetonitrile. The amount of PDV was calculated from the area under the elution profile monitored at 610 nm. Docking Simulation—Docking of the IPA imine dimer to the protein moiety of the VioE-PPA complex was performed using the AUTODOCK 4.0.1 program (22Morris G.M. Goodsell D.S. Halliday R.S. Huey R. Hart W.E. Belew R.K. Olson A.J. J. Comput. Chem. 1998; 19: 1639-1662Crossref Scopus (9158) Google Scholar). The initial structure of the IPA imine dimer was generated using Monomer Library Sketcher in CCP4 (17Computational Project, Number 4 CollaborativeActa Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19748) Google Scholar) and Chem3D Ultra 10.0. Compound X has three stereoisomers (RR, SS, and RS) because it has two equivalent chiral carbon atoms. All of these stereoisomers were examined in the docking study. All of the bonds connected to a benzylic β carbon were allowed to rotate, and VioE was modeled as a rigid protein. All default parameters except for the number of genetic algorithm runs were used for the simulation. The grid size was set to 40 × 40 × 40 Å3. Fifty Lamarckian genetic algorithm runs were performed, and each one provided a single solution (i.e. one predicted binding mode). Cluster analysis was performed at the end of the simulation. Solutions that were within a 1-Å root mean square deviation of each other were grouped in the same cluster, and the clusters were ranked according to their lowest energy member. The SS stereoisomer of compound X and chain C of the VioE-PPA complex resulted in the lowest energy binding mode, when compared with all of the other binding modes. Structural Determination—We have obtained an initial structural model using the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method and a 2.1 Å resolution anomalous data set obtained with a SeMet-labeled crystal. Structural refinement was performed with a 2.0 Å resolution data set obtained from a native crystal (an example of a typical electron density map is shown in Fig. 2A). Consistent with previous reports (6Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), VioE in the crystal formed a homodimer that does not include any coenzymes (Fig. 2, B and C). Each asymmetric unit contained three dimers (chains A + B, chains C + D, and chains E + F; Fig. 2B). With the exception of chain F, all of the chains were essentially identical to each other with root mean square deviations of 0.52-0.95 Å for the Cα atoms. The structure of chain F was different in that two loop regions (the β4-β5 loop and the β6-α2 loop; Fig. 2B) were closer to the center of the monomer. This structural deviation in chain F was probably a crystallographic artifact caused by contacts with the identical region of the symmetry-related chain C molecule in the crystal (data not shown). Indeed, the distortion of chain F was not observed in the SeMet-labeled crystal, nor was it seen in the crystal of the complex with PPA, presumably because of the larger unit cell volumes and the longer distances between the chain F and the symmetry-related chain C molecule in these crystals (data not shown). Here, we primarily focus on chain A from the native structure and chain C from the VioE-PPA complex structure, because their electron density maps are clearer than those of the other chains. Overall Structure of VioE—Each monomer of VioE assumes a configuration that resembles an opened baseball glove. The substrate fits into the “pocket” of the glove like a baseball as will be described in detail in a later section. An 11-stranded antiparallel β sheet (β1-β11) comprises the majority of the VioE structure; i.e. the β strands form a somewhat bent, single-layer sheet (Fig. 2, C and D). Three short helical structures (α1, α2, anda310 helix) are located between β3 and β4, between β6′ and β7, and in the C-terminal loop, respectively. Overall, the β sheet forms a concave surface in the center of the subunit. The other side of the subunit forms the dimer interface, which buries 3,400-3,500 Å2 of surface area from both subunits (Fig. 2C). The two subunits of the dimer are related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis that is almost parallel to β2 and β3 (Fig. 2C). The dimerization surfaces of the two subunits, which are complementary to each other, interact via hydrophobic and polar interactions (not shown). Unlike most β-barrel proteins, each subunit of VioE does not contain an obvious hydrophobic core, which suggests that VioE is unstable as a monomer. Therefore, the dimerization is likely to be required for the stabilization of the structure of VioE, and the large dimer interface serves as a structural core. Structural Similarities with Other Proteins—Searching a data base using SSM (23Krissinel E. Henrick K. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2256-2268Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar) revealed several bacterial homologues of VioE: the bacterial lipoprotein localization factors LolA and LolB, lipoprotein LppX from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (25Sulzenbacher G. Canaan S. Bordat Y. Neyrolles O. Stadthagen G. Roig-Zamboni V. Rauzier J. Maurin D. Laval F. Daffé M. Cambillau C. Gicquel B. Bourne Y. Jackson M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1436-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and an N-terminal domain of the σE factor regulatory protein RseB (26Kim D.Y. Jin K.S. Kwon E. Ree M. Kim K.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 8779-8784Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). These four proteins also have a baseball glove-like scaffold consisting of an 11-stranded antiparallel β sheet. In addition, the topologies of the β strands in these proteins are almost identical to that of VioE, although their sequences show low degrees of homology (identities < 17%). The structural features of LolA and LolB that were distinct from those of VioE included the α-helices attached to the concave surface of the β sheet, which result in a narrow hydrophobic cavity between the β sheet and the α-helices (24Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). This narrow cavity may facilitate the lipid binding that is essential for the functions of these proteins (24Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). LppX contains several helices on the edges of the concave surface, resulting in a larger hydrophobic pocket that can bind complex lipids, such as phthiocerol dimycocerosates (25Sulzenbacher G. Canaan S. Bordat Y. Neyrolles O. Stadthagen G. Roig-Zamboni V. Rauzier J. Maurin D. Laval F. Daffé M. Cambillau C. Gicquel B. Bourne Y. Jackson M. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 1436-1444Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). For RseB, which does not require a pocket that can bind to small molecules, the concave surface is occupied by several loops and helices. Because VioE and these proteins do not appear to be genetically or functionally related, the origin of the structural similarities is not clear. VioE and the homologous proteins, however, bind to small molecules because they carry out their functions, and one advantage of this structure is that the baseball glove fold includes a concave surface for the binding of exogenous ligands. Assuming that evolution has modified the loops and helices to optimize the size and shape of the β sheet for each substrate, the observed glove-like topology provides a suitable scaffold for enzymes and transporters, which hold molecules in place as they carry out their functions. The Positively Charged Surface Pocket—VioE binds a structurally unidentified substrate (compound X in Fig. 1), which is produced from two IPA imine molecules by VioB. As previously shown (6Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), the substrate itself spontaneously forms CPA in the absence of VioE (Fig. 1). Compound X has been predicted to have two carboxyl groups and two indole rings (8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar), because both the precursor of the substrate and CPA have two carboxyl groups and two indole rings. Thus, electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions are expected to play a role in the binding between compound X and VioE as has been observed between CPA and StaP, an enzyme in the staurosporine biosynthetic pathway that converts CPA into an indolocarbazole core (27Makino M. Sugimoto H. Shiro Y. Asamizu S. Onaka H. Nagano S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2007; 104: 11591-11596Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that the active site of this enzyme should contain a positively charged residue(s). To locate any relevant, positively charged residues at the active site, alanine-scanning mutagenesis was used to examine the basic residues on the surface of the protein (R61A, K77A, R84A, R140A, K143A, and R172A; the positions of the residues are shown in Fig. 5A). As shown in the left panel of Fig. 4, a substantial loss of enzymatic activity was only observed for the mutation at Arg172 (8% of the wild-type activity). Arg172 is located in the triangular surface pocket (∼15 Å long and 4 Å deep) near the center of the surface of the monomer. Several polar residues, including Tyr17, Ser19, and Cys35, surround Arg172, resulting in a positively charged base of the pocket (Fig. 5, A and B). A number of hydrophobic (Trp13, Trp21, Ile46, Phe50, Pro52, Met64, Phe109, Leu110, Pro111, Met160, and Phe174) and several hydrophilic (Glu66, Thr162, and Ser170) residues form the relatively hydrophobic edge of the pocket (Fig. 5B). Thus, alanine-scanning mutagenesis suggests that the surface pocket acts as an active site, which is consistent with the fact that many of the residues located in the pocket are well conserved among the VioE family proteins from J. lividum or Pseudoalteromonas tunicate D2.FIGURE 4Relative activities of the VioE mutant proteins. The reaction conditions are described under “Experimental Procedures.” The relative activity of a mutant protein was defined as the ratio of the amount of PDV produced by the mutant protein to that produced by wild-type VioE.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined 12 additional residues that are located in the pocket using site-directed mutagenesis (Y17F, S19A, W21A, C35S, F50A, N51A, P52A, E66A, F109A, M160A, T162A, and S170A). Moreover, to further explore the role of Arg172, glutamine was introduced at position 172 to remove the positive charge. The activities of these mutant proteins are summarized in the right panel of Fig. 4. The R172Q mutation also affected the activity of the enzyme, which again suggests that Arg172 is involved in the active site. Among the other variants, mutations at Ser19, Phe50, and Glu66 reduced the activity to less than 50% of the wild-type activity. Smaller but still significant losses of activity were observed for the N51A and Y17F mutant proteins. The activities of the other mutant enzymes (W21A, C35S, P52A, F109A, M160A, T162A, and S170A) were comparable with that of the wild-type enzyme (>80% relative activity). As shown in Fig. 5B, the mutated residues that reduced the activity of VioE (Tyr17, Ser19, Phe50, Asn51, Glu66, and Arg172) are clustered on the left edge and the bottom (the center in the figure) of the triangular pocket. Therefore, the results suggested that the triangular surface pocket and, in particular, the left side of the pocket in Fig. 5B serve as a substrate binding and/or catalytic site. Potential VioE-Substrate Interactions—The substrate of VioE is a short-lived intermediate that is spontaneously converted into CPA. Thus, it is very difficult to obtain a crystal structure of VioE complexed with its substrate. To overcome this difficulty and gain insights into the interactions between VioE and the substrate, we used PPA as a molecular probe and solved the crystal structure of the VioE-PPA complex; similar to compound X, PPA has both aromatic and pyruvate moieties. Fig. 5C shows the structure and omit electron density map for the surface pocket of the VioE-PPA complex. The significant electron density indicates that two molecules of PPA bind in the surface pocket. Overall, the structure of VioE is not altered upon PPA binding. The side chain of Arg172 in the pocket, however, extends from the bottom of the pocket, making the surface pocket substantially smaller than that of apo-VioE (Fig. 5C). These structural features were observed for all of the chains in the crystal structure of VioE-PPA complex. All of the residues that were suggested to be involved in the enzyme activity (Fig. 4; Tyr17, Ser19, Phe50, Asn51, Glu66, and Arg172) are located close to the bound PPA molecules (Fig. 5, B and C). Weaker but similar electron densities in the surface pocket as well as the reorientation of Arg172 were also observed for complexes with IPA or p-hydroxyphenyl pyruvic acid (structure not shown). These findings suggest that the VioE-PPA complex can be regarded as a stable mimic of the VioE-substrate complex and that the substrate occupies a similar position in the pocket. To examine the possibility that the IPA imine dimer, a potential substrate for VioE proposed by Balibar and Walsh (6Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), can be accommodated within the surface pocket, we carried out a docking simulation using the protein moiety of the VioE-PPA complex. Fig. 5D shows the lowest energy binding conformation. Our results demonstrate that the IPA imine dimer is able to fit into the surface pocket. The two indole rings point down into the pocket, where they interact with Glu66, Phe50, and Tyr17. Furthermore, the carboxyl and imino groups form polar interactions with Arg172, Asn51, and Ser19. As observed for the VioE-PPA complex, this binding mode is consistent with the results from the mutational analysis. It should also be noted that two indole rings are almost superim-posable onto the phenyl rings of PPA bound to VioE. Therefore, the structure shown in Fig. 5D, which details the extensive polar and hydrophobic interactions, represents a likely binding mode of VioE to the substrate. Implications about the Catalytic Mechanism—In vitro studies have revealed that VioB produces the VioE substrate, which is spontaneously converted into CPA or enzymatically transformed into PVA by VioE (6Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 11Shinoda K. Hasegawa T. Sato H. Shinozaki M. Kuramoto H. Takamiya Y. Sato T. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Hoshino T. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2007; 28: 4140-4142Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Balibar and Walsh (6Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) proposed a possible mechanism for the conversion of the IPA imine into PDV or CPA via an IPA imine dimer (Scheme 2 in Ref. 6Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The first step of the process, which can be accelerated by VioB or its homologous enzymes, is a coupling reaction of two IPA imine molecules at the benzylic β carbon atom, resulting in compound X. VioE converts the species into another intermediate with a cyclopropyl ring. A decarboxylation reaction with a concomitant reaction that opens the ring results in a 1,2-shift of the indole moiety. Finally, the pyrrole ring is formed to complete the violacein skeleton. For the spontaneous conversion into CPA, two imino groups in the IPA imine dimer are coupled to form the pyrrole ring of CPA. Thus, VioE suppresses the spontaneous formation of CPA as well as inducing the rearrangement of the indole ring. Formation of the intermediate with the cyclopropyl ring would explain these functions of VioE. Based on the mutational assay, the crystal structures of VioE and the PPA-VioE complex, and the in silico docking simulation, we propose a mechanism for PVA production by VioE as well as spontaneous CPA production (Fig. 6). In the absence of VioE, the two imino groups of compound X are closely associated to allow the intramolecular reaction required for CPA formation to proceed (6Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 8Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 9Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Furumai T. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2006; 47: 473-475Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Upon substrate binding, Arg172 moves to the edge of the pocket as was observed in the VioE-PPA complex structure. The relocated Arg172 residue forms a polar interaction with the substrate. Tyr17 and Ser19 also contribute to the substrate recognition site. Glu66 at the edge of the pocket likely interacts with the NH group of the indole moiety. These polar residues are important for substrate binding rather than the acid/base catalysis, because mutation of any these residues did not completely eliminate the activity of VioE. Phe50, which is located next to Glu66, forms π-π or hydrophobic interactions with the indole moiety. These polar and aromatic interactions keep the two imino groups away from each other to suppress CPA formation. The high reactivity of the short-lived substrate, the conformation of which is restrained in the surface pocket, allows VioE to direct the reaction to produce PVA. In other words, VioB produces the highly reactive intermediate species, whereas VioE is a key enzyme that regulates the intramolecular reaction of the intermediate species through proximity and orientation effects. Conclusions—In this report, we have presented the first structure of VioE, which dimerizes and has a positively charged surface pocket on each side of the dimer. We used structure-based mutational assays and a crystal structure of a complex of VioE and a substrate analogue to demonstrate that the positively charged pocket serves as an active site for PVA formation. Although determining the structure of the VioE-substrate complex is difficult because of the instability of the substrate, the present work provides the first structural model of the molecular-skeletal conversion catalyzed by VioE, in which a short-lived compound serves as a critical intermediate. The present findings will help to elucidate the underlying rearrangement mechanism, which should be helpful for the design of systems that allow the biosynthesis of novel indole-containing products. Addendum—While our manuscript was being revised, Hoshino and co-workers (11Shinoda K. Hasegawa T. Sato H. Shinozaki M. Kuramoto H. Takamiya Y. Sato T. Nikaidou N. Watanabe T. Hoshino T. Chem. Commun. (Camb.). 2007; 28: 4140-4142Crossref Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported new findings regarding the violacein biosynthesis pathway. We have therefore updated our article according to their work. We thank the staff of the BL44B2 and BL41XU beamlines at SPring-8 for providing the data collection facilities as well as for support. We also thank Dr. Hiroshi Sugimoto for helpful suggestions about crystal structure refinement and fruitful discussions about the VioE-PPA complex."

Without bound cofactors or metals, VioE, from the bacterium Chromobacterium violaceum, mediates a 1,2 shift of an indole ring and oxidative chemistry to generate prodeoxyviolacein, a precursor to violacein. Our 1.21 Å resolution structure of VioE shows that the enzyme shares a core fold previously described for lipoprotein transporter proteins LolA and LolB. For both LolB and VioE, a bound polyethylene glycol molecule suggests the location of the binding and/or active site of the protein. Mutations of residues near the bound polyethylene glycol molecule in VioE have identified the active site and five residues important for binding or catalysis. This structural and mutagenesis study suggests that VioE acts as a catalytic chaperone, using a fold previously associated with lipoprotein transporters to catalyze the production of its prodeoxyviolacein product.

A 22-kDa protein with few homologues based on sequence analysis, VioE is required for formation of prodeoxyviolacein 3, a precursor to violacein 5 (25Sánchez C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. ChemBio-Chem. 2006; 7: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Without the presence of VioE, a shunt product, chromopyrrolic acid 4, is produced, rather than 3 (25Sánchez C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. ChemBio-Chem. 2006; 7: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Onaka H. Tetrahedron Lett. 2007; 48: 2923-2926Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar). VioE is therefore required for the 1,2 shift of the indole ring and subsequent chemistry that gives violacein 5 its distinctive architecture. Surprisingly, despite carrying out this chemistry, VioE lacks any bound cofactors or metal ions (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Using genetic and biochemical analysis, an enzymatic pathway for violacein 5 production has been determined (Fig. 1), and intermediates have been identified (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), with the major exception that the substrate of VioE (product of VioB) is still unknown. It has, however, been established that the product of VioB is the substrate for VioE; when VioA and VioB are incubated in a reaction mixture with the VioA substrate l-tryptophan for 10 min, passed through a 10-kDa filter (removing VioA and VioB), and then incubated with VioE, prodeoxyviolacein 3 is produced (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By contrast, in the absence of VioE, no prodeoxyviolacein 3 is made (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). This result reveals three things: first, the VioB product is a small molecule that can pass through a 10-kDa filter; second, no interaction between VioB and VioE is necessary for product formation; and third, VioE is a catalyst. The small molecule passed through the filter (the product of VioB and substrate of VioE) has not yet been isolated, but it is known to convert spontaneously to chromopyrrolic acid 4 when VioE is not present; chromopyrrolic acid 4 itself is not a substrate for VioE (25Sánchez C. Braña A.F. Méndez C. Salas J.A. ChemBio-Chem. 2006; 7: 1231-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Homologues of VioB are RebD (36% identity), StaD (38% identity), InkD (34% identity), and AtmD (38% identity) from the rebeccamycin, staurosporine, K252a, and AT2433 biosynthetic pathways, respectively (28Howard-Jones A.R. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15652-15663Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Furumai T. Onaka H.

Each of these homologues produces chromopyrrolic acid 4 scaffolds as on-pathway products to generate indolocarbazole natural products, and each lacks a VioE homologue in its biosynthetic cluster (28Howard-Jones A.R. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 15652-15663Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, 29Asamizu S. Kato Y. Igarashi Y. Furumai T. Onaka H.

Yet, in vitro tests of RebD from the rebeccamycin biosynthetic pathway show that coincubation of a reaction mixture of RebD and IPA 5The abbreviations used are:IPAindole 3-pyruvic acidPEGpolyethylene glycol. imine 1 with VioE results in the production of prodeoxyviolacein 3 rather than chromopyrrolic acid 4 (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Thus, the presence of the enzyme VioE reroutes toward a violacein biosynthetic pathway and away from the related indolocarbazole biosynthetic pathways. indole 3-pyruvic acid polyethylene glycol. To characterize VioE, we solved its crystal structure to 1.21 Å resolution. The structure, which confirms that VioE lacks bound cofactors or metals, reveals the similarity of VioE to the core structure of the lipoprotein carrier proteins LolA and LolB (32Takeda K. Miyatake H. Yokota N. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Miki K. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 3199-3209Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Further, VioE resembles LolB in its binding of a PEG molecule in what appears to be the active site. To investigate whether the PEG molecule indeed identified the active site of VioE, we carried out site-directed mutagenesis on each of nine residues near the bound PEG molecule and further along the putative active site. Five of the altered proteins show significantly reduced production of prodeoxyviolacein 3 compared with wild-type VioE. This work suggests that the fold of a lipoprotein carrier protein has been co-opted to a catalytic function, enabling VioE to bind a chiefly hydrophobic molecule in a hydrophobic cavity and to catalyze a 1,2 shift reaction and oxidative chemistry, producing prodeoxyviolacein 3, rather than the unshifted shunt product chromopyrrolic acid 4. Protein Preparation and Crystallization—Eight liters of LB medium containing 30 mg/liter of kanamycin and 34 mg/liter of chloramphenicol were inoculated with a starting culture of Rosetta™ 2(DE3)pLysS (Novagen) transformed with pET24b-VioE (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). The cultures were grown at 21 °C to an A600 of 0.6 and then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside and grown for an additional 17 h at 21 °C at 250 rpm. Cell pellets (40 g) were frozen at ×20 °C overnight, then sonicated with lysozyme in 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 5 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and then centrifuged at 50,000 × g to pellet insoluble material. The supernatant was incubated with nickel (II)-loaded Chelating Sepharase™ Fast Flow (GE Biosciences) for 40 min at 4 °C. Unbound material was removed, and then the column was washed with 25 column volumes of 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Bound protein was then eluted with 300 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, 200 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. This sample was then loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex™ 75 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Fractions containing VioE were pooled and concentrated to 17 mg/ml in 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Protein was then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. VioE was crystallized at room temperature from this sample using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method by incubating 1.5 μl of protein with 1.5 μl of a precipitant solution (composed of 25% (v/v) PEG 400, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350, 0.1 m MgCl2, and 0.1 m Tris, pH 8.5) over a 0.5-ml precipitant well solution. Crystals appeared overnight and grew larger over subsequent days. Native crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, without additional cryoprotection, for x-ray data collection. Selenomethionine protein was prepared by inoculating minimal medium (6 g/liter Na2HPO4, 3 g/liter KH2PO4, 1 g/liter NH4Cl, 0.5 g/liter NaCl, 1 mm MgSO4, 0.4% (w/v) glucose, 30 mg/liter kanamycin, and 34 mg/liter chloramphenicol) with a starting culture of Rosetta™ 2(DE3)pLysS transformed with pET24b-VioE and growing cultures at 37 °C. At an A600 of 0.6, the cultures were supplemented with 100 mg/liter each l-lysine, l-threonine, and l-phenylalanine and 50 mg/liter each l-isoleucine, l-leucine, l-valine, and l-selenomethionine (33Van Duyne G.D. Standaert R.F. Karplus P.A. Schreiber S.L. Clardy J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 105-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (1091) Google Scholar) and grown for an additional 20 min. Protein expression was then induced with 0.1 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, and the cultures were grown for an additional 20 h at 21 °C at 250 rpm. Selenomethionine protein was purified identically to native protein, except that all of the buffers, excluding the final storage buffer, were supplemented with 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. A purified sample of the selenomethionine protein was assayed for incorporation of selenium using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and strong peaks were found from a 23,028-atomic mass unit species, corresponding to the incorporation of four seleniums, with weak peaks found from a 23,104-atomic mass unit species, corresponding to the incorporation of four oxidized seleniums. A small number of crystals with defects were produced in the same condition as the native protein, and these were used in streak seeding experiments to obtain crystals appropriate for x-ray data collection. Single selenomethionine-VioE crystals were flash frozen directly into liquid nitrogen for x-ray data collection. Data Collection and Processing—The data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source (Argonne, IL), beamline NE-CAT 24ID-C, with the Quantum 315 detector in a cryostream of 141.6 K. For the native crystal, the data were collected in two sweeps, one of 180° and one of 360°. A 180° sweep was first carried out in 1° oscillation steps to obtain data to 1.8 Å resolution. Next, a 360° sweep was carried out in 0.5° oscillation steps to full resolution. A small selenomethionine VioE crystal was used for a fluorescence scan to obtain the appropriate wave-lengths for anomalous dispersion data collection. A larger selenomethionine VioE crystal was then used to carry out a single-wavelength anomalous dispersion data collection at the selenium peak wavelength of 0.9792 Å, with a 360° sweep in 0.5° oscillation steps. All of the data were indexed and integrated in DENZO and scaled in SCALEPACK (34Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). The data processing statistics are shown in Table 1. Data to 1.21 Å resolution for the native and to 1.86 Å resolution for the selenomethionine derivative were used, despite the low completeness in the highest resolution bins (54.3 and 58.7%, respectively). The values of other statistics in these highest resolution bins (including Rsym, I/σ, and redundancy) suggest that the data are of high quality to these resolutions.TABLE 1Data collection and refinement statisticsNativeSelenomethionineaFor this data set, Bijovet pairs were not merged during data processing.Wavelength (Å)0.97950.9792Space groupP212121P212121Unit cell (Å)a = 53.5, b = 82.5, c = 90.6a = 53.4, b = 82.3, c = 90.6Resolution (Å)bThe values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution bin.50-1.21 (1.25-1.21)50-1.86 (1.93-1.86)RsymbThe values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution bin.,cRsym = (∑i∑hkl|Ii(hkl) - <I(hkl)>|)/∑hkl <I(hkl)>, where Ii(hkl) is the intensity of the ith measured reflection, and <I(hkl)> is the mean intensity for the reflection with the miller index (hkl).0.066 (0.258)0.060 (0.226)Completeness (%)bThe values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution bin.90.6 (54.3)95.0 (58.7)Unique reflections111,46561,353RedundancybThe values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution bin.13.9 (3.2)6.9 (3.8)I/σbThe values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution bin.35.7 (3.4)27.8 (5.1)Refinement statisticsResolution range (Å)50-1.21Rcryst (%)dRcryst = (∑hkl||Fobs(hkl)| - |Fcalc(hkl)||)/∑hkl |Fobs(hkl) |; Rfree is calculated identically, using 5% of reflections omitted from refinement.16.8Rfree (%)dRcryst = (∑hkl||Fobs(hkl)| - |Fcalc(hkl)||)/∑hkl |Fobs(hkl) |; Rfree is calculated identically, using 5% of reflections omitted from refinement.19.5No. nonhydrogen atomsProtein3183Water680PEG23Average B-factors (Å2)Protein15.0Water32.0PEG44.2Root mean squared deviation bond length (Å)0.006Root mean squared deviation bond angle (°)1.209Ramachandran plot (% residues)Most favored91.6Additionally allowed8.4Generously allowed0Disallowed0a For this data set, Bijovet pairs were not merged during data processing.b The values in parentheses indicate the highest resolution bin.c Rsym = (∑i∑hkl|Ii(hkl) - <I(hkl)>|)/∑hkl <I(hkl)>, where Ii(hkl) is the intensity of the ith measured reflection, and <I(hkl)> is the mean intensity for the reflection with the miller index (hkl).d Rcryst = (∑hkl||Fobs(hkl)| - |Fcalc(hkl)||)/∑hkl |Fobs(hkl) |; Rfree is calculated identically, using 5% of reflections omitted from refinement. Open table in a new tab Structure Building and Refinement—Six selenium sites were found using SHARP (35La Fortelle de E. Bricogne G. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 472-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar); these include three selenomethionines from each molecule of the two in the asymmetric unit and do not include the N-terminal methionines, which are disordered. The overall figure of merit (acentric) of data to 1.87 Å was calculated by SHARP to be 0.438. The native and selenomethionine data were scaled in SHARP to generate a single file used for all initial building and refinement. 2.0-Å resolution experimental maps from the SHARP output, solvent flattened with SOLOMON (36Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1996; 52: 30-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar), were used to build manually the entire main chain of the protein, with placement of most side chains. This model was then used in iterative rounds of CNS (37Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) refinement and manual adjustment of the model in COOT (38Emsley P. Cowtan K. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 2004; 60: 2126-2132Crossref PubMed Scopus (23628) Google Scholar) to the full 1.21 Å resolution of the native data, to generate a nearly complete structure with placement of a first set of water molecules. Iterative rounds of refinement were then continued in Refmac (39Murshudov G.N. Vagin A.A. Dodson E.J. Acta Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1997; 53: 240-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (13914) Google Scholar) with manual adjustment of the model in COOT, using only native data (with identically flagged reflections). Alternate conformations of side chains, additional water molecules, and PEG molecules were incorporated at this stage. Refinement was then carried out with incorporation of anisotropic B-factors, and, in final rounds of refinement, with incorporation and refinement of hydrogen atoms. Crystallized VioE contains 199 residues, including the C-terminal His6 tail with two linking residues. In both chains A and B of VioE, residues 1-4 are disordered; in chain A, residues 190-199 are additionally disordered, and in chain B, residues 195-199 are absent. The refinement statistics are listed in Table 1. Calculation of Buried Surface Area—The program AREAIMOL, from the CCP4i suite of programs (40Computational Project, Number 4 CollaborativeActa Crystallogr. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar), was used to calculate the accessible surface area for chain A alone, chain B alone, and the dimer, using a 1.4 Å probe radius. The buried surface area was taken as the sum of the accessible area for chain A and chain B, minus the accessible area for the dimer. The accessible area of chain A is 10,300 Å2, chain B is 10,700 Å2, and the dimer is 17,400 Å2. Sedimentation Velocity Experiments—Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out in a Beckman Coulter Optima XL-I analytical ultracentrifuge using a Beckman An60Ti rotor and a Beckman XL-A Monochrometer in the MIT Biophysical Instrumentation Facility. Absorbance data were collected during a velocity sedimentation run at 20.0 °C at 42,000 rpm. Protein samples were prepared as for crystallization, except that VioE eluting from a nickel (II)-loaded Chelating Sepharase™ Fast Flow (GE Biosciences) column was loaded onto a HiLoad Superdex™ 75 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 200 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0. VioE from the peak gel filtration fraction was then diluted in the identical buffer to concentrations of 8.6 and 2.3 μm, and the samples were loaded into one side of a sample cell, with buffer (200 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0) loaded into the other side of each sample cell. Sednterp (41Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Ridgeway T.M. Pelletier S. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science. Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992: 90-125Google Scholar) was used to derive values based on the experimental conditions and protein sequence for the density, partial specific volume, and mass extinction coefficient at 280 nm. These values were used to analyze the absorbance data from the sedimentation velocity experiments using SEDANAL (42Stafford W.F. Sherwood P.J. Biophys. Chem. 2004; 108: 231-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Gel Filtration—The oligomeric state of purified VioE was additionally assayed via gel filtration using a HiLoad Superdex™ 75 prep grade column (Amersham Biosciences) pre-equilibrated with 200 mm NaCl, 25 mm Tris, pH 8.0. Gel filtration standards (Bio-Rad) were used to calibrate this column. Mutagenesis and Mutant Protein Preparation—All VioE mutants were generated using splicing by overlap extension method (43Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) with the primers listed in supplemental Table S1. Two overlapping fragments (“a” and “b”) were generated from two initial PCRs, using 1 μl of miniprepped pET24b-VioE as a template, with 4 μm of each primer, 5% Me2SO, and 2× Phusion HF master mix (Invitrogen). After PCR purification using a GFX kit (GE Healthcare), the “a” and “b” fragments were mixed together and further amplified using the 5′-forward first primer from the “a” fragment reaction and the 3′-reverse second primer from the “b” fragment; all other components in the PCR were identical to those used in the first round of amplification. All of the PCRs were carried out using the following cycle parameters: 98 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98 °C for 15 s, 57 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1.5 min, followed by cooling to 4 °C. The PCR products were once again purified using the GFX kit and then subjected to digestion with NdeI/XhoI for 3 h. The resulting DNA was purified and ligated into a similarly digested pET24b vector using Quick Ligase (New England Biolabs). The ligation reactions were then transformed into chemically competent TOP10 cells plated on LB-agar-kanamycin plates. The resulting colonies were miniprepped, and the plasmids were sequenced at the Molecular Biology Core Facilities of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. The plasmids were then transformed into BL21(DE3) cells, and protein was prepared as described previously (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), using a dialysis rather than a gel filtration step to transfer protein into the final storage buffer. Activity Assays—Activity assays were carried out, as described previously (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), by incubation of l-tryptophan (500 μm) with VioA (5 μm), VioB (5 μm), VioE (5 μm), and 50 units of catalase in 75 mm glycine, pH 9.25. The reactions were quenched after 1 h with 20% (v/v) Me2SO and 200% (v/v) methanol, and, after removal of precipitated protein, the samples were analyzed via high pressure liquid chromatography, as described previously (26Balibar C.J. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 15444-15457Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Prodeoxyviolacein 3 peaks at 590 nm were integrated with 32 Karat Software (version 5.0, Build 1021, Beckman Coulter, Inc.). All of the activity assays were run in triplicate and compared with authentic standards of prodeoxyviolacein 3. Circular Dichroism—Circular dichroism spectra of native and mutant proteins were collected on an Aviv model 202 CD Spectrometer (software by Aviv, version 3.00C) at the MIT Biophysical Instrumentation Facility from 190 to 250 nm with a 1-nm wavelength step, an averaging time of 3 s, and a settling time of 0.333 s. The samples were processed in a 0.1-cm-path length rectangular quartz cuvette. All of the proteins, which were stored in a buffer solution composed of 50 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris, pH 8.4, and 10% glycerol, were diluted in degassed, double distilled water to 17 μm in 400-μl samples. A buffer solution, also diluted in degassed, double distilled water, with a final composition of 0.2% glycerol, 1 mm NaCl, and 0.4 mm Tris, pH 8.4, was analyzed between each sample, and the average values over 10 buffer samples were used for background subtraction before generation of a final graph. VioE crystallizes as a dimer, with each concave side of the curved β-sheet facing away from the interface (Fig. 2A) and with an average of 1800 Å2 of buried surface area per monomer. The large dimeric interface of the two chains is chiefly hydrophobic (63% of interacting residues) with water largely excluded (only 28 molecules of water in the interface) and with 17 hydrogen bonds that pair polar atoms with one another across the interface. To investigate the oligomeric state in solution of VioE, a sedimentation velocity experiment was carried out at each of two concentrations (8.6 and 2.3 μm). The results of the sedimentation velocity experiment are consistent with a dimer in solution (supplemental Fig. S1). The sedimentation velocity experiments are in contrast to the result from preparative scale gel filtration, which suggested that VioE eluted as a monomer, based on the gel filtration standards (supplemental Fig. S2). However, given the results of sedimentation velocity analysis, the large size of the dimeric interface, the predominance of hydrophobic residues, the general exclusion of water, and the presence of specific interactions distributed across much of the interface, the dimer appears to be the preferred oligomeric state of purified VioE. In each monomer, strand 1 begins in the center of the protein and initiates an anti-parallel β-sheet, building from β1 to β6 one half of the structure (Fig. 2B). Between β3 and β4isan intervening loop, which contains a four-amino acid α-helical turn, and β6 is composed of two short β-strands, termed 6a and 6b, which are connected by a loop region. From β6, a loop extends to a four-amino acid α-helical turn, which then extends via another loop to β7 on the opposite side of the protein. β7 to β11 then build up, via anti-parallel β-strands, the second half of the sheet, with β11 and β1 hydrogen-bonding to each other, bringing the two halves of the structure together. A loop continues from the C terminus of β11 into a loop including 310 α-helical turn, which terminates the ordered portion o"

Biosynthesis of the functional dimer involves the participation of several chaperones, termed cofactors A-E, that act on folding intermediates downstream of the cytosolic chaperonin CCT (1Tian G.

We show that cofactor D is also a centrosomal protein and that overexpression of either the full-length protein or either of two centrosome localization domains leads to the loss of anchoring of the γ-tubulin ring complex and of nucleation of microtubule growth at centrosomes. In contrast, depletion of cofactor D by short interfering RNA results in mitotic spindle defects. Because none of these changes in cofactor D activity produced a change in the levels of α-or β-tubulin, we conclude that these newly discovered functions for cofactor D are distinct from its previously described role in tubulin folding.

Thus, we describe a new role for cofactor D at centrosomes that is important to its function in polymerization of tubulin and organization of the mitotic spindle. Centrosomes are the major microtubule-organizing center in animal cells and are composed of two centrioles (barrel-shaped structures composed of α/β-tubulin heterodimers) surrounded by a dense fibrillar network of proteins called the pericentriolar material (PCM). 2The abbreviations used are:PCMpericentriolar materialCoDtubulin-specific co-chaperone cofactor DHAthe primary epitope from the hemagglutinin proteinγ-TuRCγ-tubulin ring complexsiRNAshort interfering RNAGCPγ-complex proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.2The abbreviations used are:PCMpericentriolar materialCoDtubulin-specific co-chaperone cofactor DHAthe primary epitope from the hemagglutinin proteinγ-TuRCγ-tubulin ring complexsiRNAshort interfering RNAGCPγ-complex proteinPIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. A key step in the initiation of new microtubule growth is the regulated recruitment to the PCM of γ-tubulin ring complexes (γ-TuRCs), consisting of γ-tubulin and γ-complex proteins (GCPs) (3Fava F.

In addition to nucleating new microtubule growth, centrosomes also organize cytosolic microtubules during interphase, spindle microtubules during mitosis, and axonemes in ciliogenesis (8Doxsey S.

Formation of α/β tubulin heterodimers is promoted by five tubulin-specific co-chaperones, termed cofactors A-E, that act on α- and β-tubulin folding intermediates in a stepwise process that generates polymerizable heterodimers (1Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Demonstration of the roles for these five cofactors in folding tubulin heterodimers comes from in vitro folding assays, which also allowed purification of the five co-chaperones (1Tian G. Huang Y.

That the tubulin-specific cofactors may play additional roles in regulating microtubule stability or dynamicity was first proposed by Tian et al. (2Tian G. Lewis S.A. Feierbach B. Stearns T. Rommelaere H. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 821-832Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), who found that overexpression of bovine CoD in HeLa cells led to the loss of microtubules and decreased levels of α-tubulin in cells. With additional in vitro data showing that purified bovine CoD disrupts the tubulin heterodimer, the authors proposed a role for CoD in heterodimer destruction, with a secondary loss of microtubules (19Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar, 20Martin L. Fanarraga M.L. Aloria K. Zabala J.C. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 93-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A regulated destructive pathway was suggested by the observations that increased expression of the small GTPase Arl2 could block the effects of CoD overexpression and could be co-immunoprecipitated with CoD (19Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Later, the majority of cellular Arl2 was shown to exist in a stable ∼300-kDa complex with CoD and the trimeric protein phosphatase, PP2A (21Shern J.F. Sharer J.D. Pallas D.C. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Reed M.S. Pohl J. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40829-40836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Neither the tubulin folding activity of CoD nor the GTP binding activity of Arl2 were detectable in the purified complex (21Shern J.F. Sharer J.D. Pallas D.C. Bartolini F. Cowan N.J. Reed M.S. Pohl J. Kahn R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40829-40836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), so we sought other functions for the complex constituents in cell regulation. Cloning and Plasmids—The plasmid directing expression in mammalian cells of bovine CoD fused to GFP was obtained from Nicholas Cowan (New York University) (19Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) and was used as a template to generate our HA-tagged bovine CoD expression constructs. A plasmid containing the entire open reading frame of human CoD was obtained from ATCC (clone MGC-1583; Manassas, VA) and used to generate both full-length and truncation mutant expression plasmids by PCR amplification using custom oligonucleotide primers. The parent plasmid in each case was pCDNA3.1/Myc-His (Invitrogen), and each open reading frame was cloned in at the NotI and XbaI sites. When N-terminal tags were added, they were included in the primers used in the PCR. Sequences were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmid-based siRNA experiments targeted four 19-nucleotide stretches within the CoD reading frame (GCGTAATAATGGACAAATA, CAACTGTTTCCTGGTTATA, TCTATGATCGTCAGTTATA, and TGACGCTCCTGCACTTTGA) that were synthesized and cloned into the pG-SHIN2 vector, a derivative of pSUPER that expresses EGFP from the constitutive SV40 early promoter, using BglII and HindIII (22Kojima S. Vignjevic D. Borisy G.G. BioTechniques. 2004; 36: 74-79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies—We generated rabbit polyclonal antibodies to CoD by injection of a 16-mer peptide (60FRVIMD-KYQEQPHLLC74) that was covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin through the C-terminal cysteine prior to injections in animals (Bioperformance; Affinity Bioreagents). Affinity purification of CoD antibodies was achieved using an Ultralink Iodoacetyl Gel (Pierce) column to which peptide was conjugated following the manufacturer's instructions (23Liu L.A. Engvall E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 38171-38176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 24Bicknell A.B. Lomthaisong K. Woods R.J. Hutchinson E.G. Bennett H.P. Gladwell R.T. Lowry P.J. Cell. 2001; 105: 903-912Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Other antibodies used in this study were monoclonal α-, β-, and γ-tubulin antibodies (Sigma), monoclonal and polyclonal His6 antibodies (Cell Signaling Technologies), monoclonal centrin-2 (a generous gift from Jeff Salisbury (Mayo Clinic, Minneapolis, MN)), and polyclonal antibodies against pericentrin and GCP-WD (gifts from Tim Stearns (Stanford University)). Cell Culture and Immunofluorescence—HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were transfected using either Lipofectamine 2000 or Lipofectamine Plus according to the manufacturer's directions (Invitrogen). The Smart Pool mixture of four synthetic RNAs targeting human CoD was purchased from Dharmacon, and transfections were performed using Dharmafect 1 according to the manufacturer's directions (Dharmacon). For immunofluorescence, cells were fixed using either methanol (-20 °C, 5-7 min) for centrosomal staining or PHEMO buffer (25Zhou C. Cunningham L. Marcus A.I. Li Y. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2476-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) (room temperature, 10 min) for α-tubulin staining of microtubules and in the nocodazole washout (aster formation) assay (25Zhou C. Cunningham L. Marcus A.I. Li Y. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2476-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Treatment of cells with nocodazole (15 μm, 2 h) was performed as described (25Zhou C. Cunningham L. Marcus A.I. Li Y. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2476-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Quantification of centrosomal staining intensities for CoD, γ-tubulin, centrin-2, pericentrin, and GCP-WD were performed by comparison with the staining observed in control cells and were scored by eye. Centrosome Purification—Cells were transfected, and 24 h later, centrosomes were isolated from cells using a modification of the method of Hsu and White (26Hsu L.C. White R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 12983-12988Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar) as described by Zhou et al. (25Zhou C. Cunningham L. Marcus A.I. Li Y. Kahn R.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2006; 17: 2476-2487Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were incubated with cytochalasin D (1 μg/ml) and nocodazole (0.2 μm) at 37 °C for 1 h. Cells were then washed, followed by incubation with shaking at 4 °C for 10 min in lysis buffer. Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. Lysates were added to a 60% sucrose solution, and tubes were centrifuged at 25,000 × g for 30 min to sediment centrosomes into the sucrose cushion. The bottom layer was collected, loaded onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient, and spun at 120,000 × g for 1 h. Fractions (0.2 ml each) were collected from the top, diluted in 2 ml of 10 mm PIPES, pH 7.2, and sedimented by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatant was removed, and pellet protein was resuspended and denatured in SDS sample buffer. Data Analysis—All experiments reported have been repeated at least three times with similar results. Fluorescence images were collected with an Olympus BX60 microscope with a ×100 oil immersion objective (Melville, NY), and images were taken using a Q-Imaging RETIGA 1300R camera. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop. Graphs were generated using GraphPad Prism. Standard epifluorescence images were obtained in each case, to facilitate viewing of structures or staining in different focal planes. This results in lower resolution in several of the images shown in the figures, as compared with the use of confocal data. In addition, and only in Fig. 7, some of the images shown were merged from epifluorescence images taken at different focal planes to allow depiction of the multiple pole/spindle phenotypes. CoD Is a Component of Centrosomes—Rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against a 15-mer peptide, located near the N terminus of human CoD and conserved in several mammalian CoD orthologs. The CoD antisera specifically recognized a ∼130-kDa protein in HeLa cell lysates (Fig. 1A, middle), and this band was clearly increased in immunoblots of cells expressing His6-tagged CoD (Fig. 1A). For this experiment only, we chose conditions of transfection that would allow low expression levels of CoD-His6 in order to visualize both endogenous and overexpressed protein at similar exposure times. Preimmune sera did not react with this protein (Fig. 1A, left), and the signal was effectively competed by preincubation of antiserum with the immunizing peptide (Fig. 1A, right). Affinity-purified antibodies yielded similar results, with a decrease in nonspecific binding and specific antibody titer so that there was substantially reduced CoD signal intensity (data not shown). Fractionation of HeLa cell lysates by centrifugation at 100,000 × g revealed that an estimated 90% or more of the protein fractionates in the S100 (data not shown), suggesting that the vast majority of CoD is cytosolic, as expected from the fact that CoD has twice been purified from cytosol (1Tian G. Huang Y. Rommelaere H. Vandekerckhove J. Ampe C. Cowan N.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 287-296Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 21Shern J.F. Sharer J.D. Pallas D.C.

Lewis S.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24054-24058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Indirect immunofluorescence of cultured mammalian cells revealed that CoD is also present at centrosomes, as seen by its co-localization with γ-tubulin in both interphase and mitotic HeLa cells (Fig. 1B). The specificity of this localization of endogenous CoD was confirmed, since centrosomal staining was absent when preimmune serum was used or when the immune serum was preincubated with the peptide antigen (data not shown). Because of the presence in immunoblots of a cross-reactive band of ∼75 kDa, we performed two additional tests of the presence of CoD at centrosomes. Human CoD carrying a N-terminal His6 tag was transiently expressed in HeLa cells prior to fixation and localization with antibodies directed against the His6 tag. We found that His6-CoD was also at centrosomes at early time points after transfection (Fig. 1C) and was also found to co-sediment with the peak of γ-tubulin in our centrosome purification protocol (Fig. 1D). Together, these data show that CoD is a component of the centrosomes. Endogenous CoD was also observed at centrosomes in U2OS, COS-7, or MCF-7 cells (data not shown). The intensity of staining of CoD at centrosomes increased during the cell cycle, similar to that of γ-tubulin, and appeared to occupy a larger area than that of centrin-2 at the centrioles (28Paoletti A. Moudjou M. Paintrand M. Salisbury J.L. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3089-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Blagden S.P. Glover D.M. Nat. Cell Biol. 2003; 5: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Thus, CoD is found in the PCM and is probably increasingly recruited during the course of the cell cycle. Human and Bovine CoD Display Differences in Effects on Microtubules When Expressed in HeLa Cells—Because CoD is involved in tubulin biosynthesis and localizes to centrosomes, we sought to determine if it also functions to regulate assembly of microtubules at the microtubule organizing center. Expression in HeLa cells of GFP-tagged bovine CoD was shown previously (19Bhamidipati A. Lewis S.A. Cowan N.J. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 149: 1087-1096Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar) to cause a dramatic reduction in the number of microtubules and decrease the amount of α-tubulin, which we repeated using this same construct (data not shown). We created a N-terminal HA-tagged bovine CoD, which also caused microtubule destruction and loss of α-tubulin (Fig. 2, A (middle) and B). Surprisingly, overexpression of either wild type (data not shown) or HA-tagged human CoD (Fig. 2A, top) did not noticeably alter microtubule integrity in HeLa cells, despite expression to levels comparable with the bovine protein, as determined by combined immunoblot analysis of transfected cell populations and similar transfection frequencies, determined by immunofluorescent analyses (Fig. 2B). We also observed no changes in the levels of α-, β-, or γ-tubulin in HeLa cells overexpressing human CoD (Fig. 2B). Thus, the previously reported effects of bovine CoD overexpression on microtubule density and α-tubulin levels in HeLa cells are completely reproducible but are not conserved in the human ortholog. Human and bovine CoD are 1192 and 1199 residues in length, respectively, and share 81.4% sequence identity. Recently, Shultz et al. (30Shultz T. Shmuel M. Hyman T. Altschuler Y. FASEB J. 2008; 22: 168-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) reported that deletion of the last 15 amino acids from bovine CoD inhibited its ability to disrupt microtubule integrity. The only differences between human and bovine CoD in this region are in 4 of the last 5 C-terminal residues (Fig. 2C). To determine if the C-terminal residues are critical for microtubule disruption, we constructed an N-terminal HA-tagged bovine CoD with these 4 amino acids changed to the human sequence (BtΔHs(4Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)). We expressed this protein in HeLa cells and observed neither an impact on the microtubule integrity nor any change in the levels of α-tubulin, despite the fact that the protein was expressed to levels comparable with those of wild type bovine CoD. These data reveal that the C terminus of bovine CoD is required for microtubule disruption (Fig. 2, A (middle) and B). In an effort to determine if the bovine residues were sufficient to confer the ability to disrupt microtubules onto human CoD, we also constructed an N-terminal HA-tagged human CoD with these 4 amino acids changed to the bovine sequence (HsΔBt(4Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar)). When expressed transiently in HeLa cells, we again did not see any changes in the density of microtubules (data not shown); nor were changes in the levels of α-tubulin detected by immunoblot analyses (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that these 4 residues are necessary for the microtubule disruption activity of bovine CoD but are not sufficient to confer this activity upon human CoD. Human CoD is predicted to be expressed in as many as five alternatively spliced variants or isoforms in the Expasy Uni-ProtKB data base (available on the World Wide Web) and as two in Entrez Gene (Gene ID: 6904). Variant 1 is predicted to be 1192 residues in length and is supported by over 500 expressed sequence tag sequences. A longer variant, variant 4, is predicted to include one additional exon, encoding 38 amino acids, but a BLAST search of this sequence yielded no matches in the expressed sequence tag data base. The other three predicted variants are much shorter in length (<700 residues), and tblastn searches of unique DNA sequences from each yielded four expressed sequence tag matches to one and only one to each of the others. Orthologs of CoD were also found in a variety of species, including mouse, rat, yeasts, plants, and worms, and each of these proteins is predicted to be between 1024 and 1232 residues in length. Thus, we conclude that human CoD is primarily, and possibly exclusively, expressed in tissues as the 1192-residue protein. All subsequent studies were performed with this variant 1 of human CoD. Increased Expression of CoD Causes Loss of Centrosomal γ-Tubulin and Aster Formation—Although the increased expression of human CoD in HeLa cells did not produce changes in α-tubulin levels or microtubule density, we did observe the loss of γ-tubulin staining at centrosomes (Fig. 3, top row). The effect of His6-CoD expression on γ-tubulin staining was thought to be dose-dependent, because at early times after transfection (e.g. 5 h, when protein expression is still low), γ-tubulin and His6-CoD were still retained on centrosomes (Fig. 1C). We also found that HA-tagged human, HsΔBt(4Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), and BtΔHs(4Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) CoDs each localized to centrosomes, although the staining of BtΔHs(4Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) at centrosomes was noticeably weaker than that of the other constructs. We did not detect any centrosomal staining of bovine HA-CoD, which may indicate that CoD localization to this organelle requires microtubules, since this is the only construct that resulted in their loss in cells. Cellular CoD-His6 staining was noticeably increased by 8 h post-transfection. By this time, the centrosomal staining of γ-tubulin was largely lost, and it was completely absent in transfected cells after 18 h (Fig. 3, top row). Similarly, expression of any of the HA-tagged bovine, human, HsΔBt(4Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar), or BtΔHs(4Murphy S.M. Urbani L. Stearns T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 663-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (178) Google Scholar) CoD proteins also resulted in the loss or reduction in γ-tubulin staining at centrosomes (data not shown). In contrast, expression of CoD-His6 did not alter centrin-2 staining at centrosomes at any of these times, compared with control cells (Fig. 3, bottom row). Centrin-2 is associated with centrioles and is required for centriolar and centrosomal duplication (28Paoletti A. Moudjou M. Paintrand M. Salisbury J.L. Bornens M. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 3089-3102Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Salisbury J.L. Suino K.M. Busby R. Springett M. Curr.

Cell. 1992; 76: 383-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The retention of centrin-2 at the centrosomes in cells transfected with CoD indicates that core components of centrosomes are not altered under these conditions and that, despite the loss of γ-tubulin, the integrity of the centrosomes is otherwise intact. We next determined whether cells overexpressing CoD were able to nucleate the growth of new microtubules as efficiently as control cells. Cells were treated with nocodazole to depolymerize microtubules and then washed to remove the drug, and the growth of new microtubules was observed by following the formation of microtubule asters emanating from centrosomes at early times after washout of the drug, by labeling fixed cells with α-tubulin antibodies. Cells overexpressing CoD failed to produce asters under these conditions and thus appear to be compromised in their ability to nucleate the growth of microtubules from centrosomes (Fig. 4A, top) but were able to nucleate cytosolic microtubules (arrows in 4A). Similar results were obtained with CoD overexpression in human osteosarcoma (U2OS), breast adenocarcinoma (MCF-7), and monkey kidney (COS-7) cells (data not shown). Even at 1 h after drug washout, we failed to observe asters in HeLa cells overexpressing CoD, despite the fact that the density of microtubules in these cells continued to increase over time (Fig. 4A, middle and bottom). We interpret these data as evidence that the presence of excess CoD in cells prevents the centrosome from acting as the primary site of microtubule nucleation but does not inhibit the machinery involved in such nucleation. This conclusion is also consistent with the fact that there was no evident difference in microtubule densities in these cultures prior to treatment of cells with nocodazole. Because such a profound loss of microtubule nucleation at centrosomes might be expected to have a more severe impact on cell survival or mitosis, cells overexpressing CoD were examined for 2 days post-transfection. Mitotic indices were scored as the percentage of transfected cells with condensed DNA. One day after transfection, we noted that the mitotic index had decreased to zero in cells staining positively for CoD expression, compared with mock-transfected cultures (0% versus 4.4% ± 0.3, with at least 100 cells counted in each of three independent experiments). However, by 48 h, mitosis had resumed in transfected cells, and no difference was observed in the mitotic index. Thus, the excess expression of CoD causes the loss of aster formation activity at centrosomes that probably contributes to a block in mitosis, but the transient nature of this arrest, due to the transience of the protein expression, is ample cause for caution in interpretation of these data. The construction of stable cell lines with inducible expression of CoD would probably shed additional light on this issue. CoD Contains Two Centrosomal Targeting Domains—CoD is a large (133-kDa) protein that is predicted to fold almost entirely into a series of α-helices with loops that form HEAT or armadillo repeats (33Grynberg M. Jaroszewski L. Godzik A. BMC Bioinformatics. 2003; 4: 46Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Recombinant human CoD is insoluble when expressed in bacteria, and we also failed to obtain soluble protein from insect or yeast (Pichia pastoris) cell expression systems. In efforts to define functional domains within CoD involved in the effects described above, we generated a series of plasmids directing expression of truncation mutants and tested them for effects on centrosomal proteins and functions. The typical levels of expression achieved in HeLa cells of the truncation mutants used in our study and pictorial representations of the mutants are shown in Fig. 4B. We first assayed the mutants for the ability to prevent aster formation in the nocodazole washout experiment, and each half (residues 1-610 and 611-1192) of CoD prevented aster formation as effectively as the full-length protein (Fig. 4C). Further truncations of CoD revealed that there are two different domains, found within residues 310-610 and 803-1054 (shaded bars in Fig. 4B), that are independently capable of preventing aster formation when expressed in HeLa cells.

The number of wild-type subunits to maintain a functional heterotetrameric channel differed among the four RyR1 mutants. The results indicate that homozygous RyR1 mutations associated with core myopathies abolish or greatly reduce sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ release during excitation-contraction coupling.

CCD is autosomal dominant disease, which results in the formation of large, centrally located cores or areas devoid of oxidizing enzymes and mitochondria. The majority of RyR1 mutations associated with CCD are located in the C-terminal, pore-forming region of RyR1. MmD is a recessive disease, characterized by the formation of multiple minicores. RyR1 MmD-related mutations appear to be distributed throughout the whole RyR1 genome and may result in silencing of one of the alleles in the affected individuals (6Zhou H. Jungbluth H. Sewry C.A.

Two of the four subunits are removed for clarity. The model is based on the known structure of the K+ channels (12Jiang Y. Lee A. Chen J. Cadene M. Chait B.T. MacKinnon R.

We identified by mutagenesis, in close proximity to the selectivity filter motif GGGIG, a conserved lumenal D4899/E4900 motif that has a critical role in RyR ion permeation and selectivity (15Wang Y.

Corresponding rabbit RyR1 mutants were expressed alone or together with wild type (WT) RyR1 in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK 293) cells and single channel properties were determined following incorporation in lipid bilayers. The four mutants when expressed alone all showed variably decreased K+ conductances and loss of Ca2+ conductance and Ca2+-dependent gating. Co-expression of WT and mutant RyR1 subunits resulted in three groups of single channels that differed in their activity and ion permeability. Our results suggest that heterozygous expression of RyR1 core myopathy mutants may result in the assembly of (i) functional channels that are gated by Ca2+ and conduct Ca2+, (ii) functional channels with a reduced Ca2+ conductance, and (iii) nonfunctional channels that do not conduct Ca2+.

Cells were maintained at 37 °C and 5% CO2 in high glucose Dulbecco's modified eagle medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and plated the day before transfection. For each 10-cm tissue culture dish, 3.5 μg of cDNA was used. Cells were harvested 48 h after transfection. Crude membrane fractions (21Gao L. Balshaw D. Xu L. Tripathy A. Xin C. Meissner G. Biophys.

Immunoblot Analysis—Membrane fractions (20 μg of protein) representing the total particulate matter were separated by 3–12% SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and probed with polyclonal antibody for RyR1 (23Du W.

Western blots were developed using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine and H2O2 as substrates and quantified using UN-SCAN-IT (Silk Scientific Co) analysis software. Stored Ca2+ Release—Stored Ca2+ release was determined using the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator dye Fluo 4-AM. HEK 293 cells were loaded with 5 μm Fluo 4-AM for 1 h at 37 °C in Krebs-Ringer-Henseleit (KRH) buffer (24Wang Y. Xu L. Duan H. Pasek D.A. Eu J.P. Meissner G. J. Biol.

Individual cells were defined as regions of interest, and average fluorescence was measured by using ImageMaster program (Photon Technology International). [3H]Ryanodine Binding—Ryanodine binds with high specificity to the RyRs and is widely used to determine their protein expression levels (25Sutko J.L. Airey J.A. Welch W. Ruest L. Pharmacol. Rev. 1997; 49: 53-98PubMed Google Scholar). Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were determined by incubating total particulate matter for 4 h at 24 °C with a saturating concentration of [3H]ryanodine (30 nm) in 20 mm imidazole, pH 7.0, 0.6 m KCl, 0.15 m sucrose, protease inhibitors, and 100 μm Ca2+. Specific [3H]ryanodine binding was determined by a filtration assay as described (24Wang Y. Xu L. Duan H. Pasek D.A. Eu J.P. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 15572-15581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Single Channel Recordings—Single channel measurements were performed using planar lipid bilayers containing a 5:3:2 mixture of bovine brain phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylcholine (11Xu L. Wang Y. Gillespie D. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2006; 90: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes containing the purified recombinant RyR1s were added to the cis (SR cytosolic side) chamber of a bilayer apparatus and fused in the presence of an osmotic gradient (250 mm cis KCl/20 mm trans KCl in 20 mm KHepes, pH 7.4, 2 μm Ca2+). After the appearance of channel activity, trans (SR lumenal) KCl concentration was increased to 250 mm. A strong dependence of single channel activities on cis Ca2+ concentration indicated that the large cytosolic “foot” region faced the cis chamber of the bilayers. The trans side of the bilayer was defined as ground. Electrical signals were filtered at 2 kHz (0.5 kHz for Ca2+ currents at 0 mV), digitized at 10 kHz, and analyzed as described (26Xu L. Tripathy A. Pasek D.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32680-32691Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To determine permeability ratios, single channel activities were recorded in symmetrical 250 mm KCl solution with 10 mm Ca2+ on the trans side and the reversal potential (Erev) was measured. The permeability ratio of Ca2+ versus K+ ions (PCa/PK) was calculated using modified form of the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz Equation 1, Erev=-RTFLn[K]12×[K]+4PCaPK[Ca]-12(Eq. 1) where [Ca] is the concentration of Ca2+ ions on trans side, and [K] is the concentration of K+ ions on the cis and trans sides. Biochemical Assays and Data Analysis—Free Ca2+ concentrations were obtained using solutions of Ca2+ and EGTA and were determined with a Ca2+-selective electrode. Results are given as mean ± S.E. Significance of differences in the data (p < 0.05) was determined using Student's t test. RyR1-D4899Q and RyR1 mutant channels associated with CCD and MmD were expressed alone or expressed together with WT-RyR1 in HEK293 cells to yield homotetrameric or heterotetrameric channel complexes. Fig. 1 shows the predicted location of RyR1-D4899Q (used as a control) and CCD-associated mutants RyR1-G4898E, -G4898R (“1”), and -ΔV4926/I4927 (“2”). The location of single site N-terminal RyR1-R110W and MmD-associated RyR1-R110W/L486V are not shown, as the two mutants are predicted to be a considerable distance away from the pore region of RyR1. Expression Levels and Functional Properties of Mutant RyR1 Channels—Quantitative analysis of immunoblots showed that averaged protein levels of RyR1 mutants were within a factor of 2 of WT levels in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells co-transfected with WT and mutant cDNAs in a 1:1 ratio had RyR1 protein bands with intensity comparable to WT (data not shown). The expression of functional RyR1 mutant channels was assessed by monitoring in HEK293 cells the fluorescence change in Fluo-4 in response to the addition of 10 mm caffeine and by determining Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding to membranes. With exception of G4898R, homotetrameric CCD and MmD mutants as well as RyR1-R110W showed a loss of function, as they failed to exhibit caffeine-induced Ca2+ release. Cells expressing G4898R showed reduced caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in 10–20% of cells compared with 50–60% in WT-expressing cells. All homotetrameric CCD and MmD mutants as well as RyR1-R110W bound negligible amounts of [3H]ryanodine (not shown), which suggested that the mutations have a major impact on the structure of the channels leading to aberrant channel behavior. In agreement with a previous study (15Wang Y. Xu L. Pasek D.A. Gillespie D. Meissner G. Biophys. J. 2005; 89: 256-265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), similar Bmax values of [3H]ryanodine binding were observed for cells expressing WT and D4899Q channels. Single Channel Analysis of Homotetrameric RyR1 Channels—Detergent-solubilized WT and mutant channels were purified on sucrose gradients and reconstituted in proteoliposomes. WT and mutant channels migrated on the gradients as a single peak with an apparent sedimentation coefficient of ∼30S, which indicated the presence of tetrameric channel complexes (27Lai F.A. Misra M. Xu L. Smith H.A. Meissner G. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16776-16785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteoliposomes containing the purified channel complexes were fused with planar lipid bilayers, and single channels were recorded in 250 mm KCl on both sides of the bilayer. The cis (cytosolic) bilayer chamber contained Ca2+ concentrations that either activated (2 μm) or only minimally activated (0.1 μm) WT-RyR1. In the upper left trace of Fig. 2A, a single partially activated WT-RyR1 channel is recorded in the presence of 2 μm free cytosolic Ca2+ at a bilayer potential of -35 mV. Reduction of cytosolic Ca2+ to 0.1 μm reduced channel open probability (Po) to near zero (Fig. 2A left, second trace). Channel currents of mutant RyR1s with R110 W (Fig. 2B) and G4898E (Fig. 2C) or G4898R (Fig. 2D) substitution were reduced compared with WT. In contrast to WT, single channel open probabilities were not substantially reduced in presence of 0.1 μm cytosolic Ca2+ (Fig. 2, B–D left, second traces, Table 1). Control experiments with vector-transfected cells indicated that the above measurements were not performed with channel activities endogenously expressed in HEK 293 cells. Because RyR1-G4898R exhibited caffeine-induced Ca2+ release in HEK 293 cells, we also tested the ability of caffeine to activate the channel complex. We found that single RyR1-G4898R channel activities did not respond to 10 mm caffeine.TABLE 1Single channel properties of homotetrameric WT and mutants in symmetric KCl solutionPoγIoErevPCa/PK2 μm cis Ca2+0.1 μm cis Ca2+10 mm trans Ca2+pSpAmVWT-RyR10.27 ± 0.08 (9)aNumber in parentheses indicates number of determinations0.004 ± 0.003 (7)781 ± 7 (12)–2.4 ± 0.1 (12)8.9 ± 0.1 (12)6.4 ± 0.1 (12)R110W0.61 ± 0.18 (6)0.50 ± 0.20 (3)441 ± 75 (8)≤0.1 (4)<0.3 (5)NDbND, not determinedR110W/L486V0.64 ± 0.15 (7)0.60 ± 0.23 (3)442 ± 77 (9)≤0.1 (4)<0.3 (4)NDG4898E0.41 ± 0.16 (9)0.56 ± 0.16 (7)410 ± 50 (11)≤0.1 (7)<0.3 (7)NDG4898R0.34 ± 0.12 (9)0.25 ± 0.13 (6)352 ± 61 (10)≤0.1 (6)<0.3 (6)NDD4899Q0.33 ± 0.10 (9)0.0002 ± 0.0001 (8)164 ± 4 (10)–0.4 ± 0.1 (4)1.7 ± 0.2 (4)1.0 ± 0.2 (4)ΔV4926/I49270.67 ± 0.13 (10)0.92 ± 0.02 (3)621 ± 66 (14)≤0.1 (5)<0.3 (5)NDa Number in parentheses indicates number of determinationsb ND, not determined Open table in a new tab Currents through R110W, G4898E, and G4898R channels measured in symmetrical 250 mm KCl showed a linear voltage-dependence similar to WT-RyR1 (Fig. 2, right). Averaged conductances were 441 ± 75 pS for R110W, 410 ± 50 pS for G4898E, and 352 ± 61 pS for G4898R compared with 781 ± 7 pS for WT-RyR1 (Table 1). To determine the ability of the mutant channels to conduct Ca2+, WT and mutant channels were recorded in 250 mm symmetrical KCl with 10 mm Ca2+ in the trans (SR lumenal) bilayer chamber. WT exhibited averaged unitary Ca2+ current of -2.4 ± 0.1 pA at 0 mV (Fig. 2A, left, third trace, Table 1). Addition of 10 mm Ca2+ to the trans chamber reduced single channel currents at negative and positive potentials and yielded averaged reversal potential (Erev) of +8.9 ± 0.1 mV (Fig. 2A, right, Table 1). Applying constant field theory by the equation given under “Experimental Procedures,” an averaged permeability ratio of Ca2+ over K+ (PCa/PK) of 6.4 ± 0.1 was calculated (Table 1). In contrast, addition of 10 mm trans Ca2+ to the three mutant channels did not generate a noticeable unitary Ca2+ current at 0 mV and was without effect on currents or reversal potentials (Fig. 2, B–D, Table 1). Taken together, the single channel data indicate that the R110W and G4898E or G4898R substitutions introduced major alterations to the RyR1 channel pore. The three mutants showed negligible Ca2+ permeation, loss of Ca2+ responsiveness and exhibited a reduced conductance in symmetric KCl medium. The single channel properties of homotetrameric RyR1-R110W/L486V (18Zhou H. Yamaguchi N. Xu L. Wang Y. Sewry C. Jungbluth H. Zorzato F. Bertini E. Muntoni F. Meissner G. Treves S. Hum. Mol.

Single Channel Analysis of Heterotetrameric RyR1 Channels—RyR1 is composed of four 565-kDa subunits. This suggests that simultaneous expression of mutant and WT-RyR1 subunits may result in the formation of heterotetrameric channel complexes and raises the question as to how these channels function in patients that carry both the WT and mutant alleles. We addressed this question by co-transfecting HEK 293 cells with WT and mutant cDNAs. Fig. 3A indicates the subunit distribution in channel complexes in cells expressing WT and mutants in 1:1 ratio, assuming a random distribution of the four subunits. We initially performed experiments with heteromeric channel complexes composed of WT and D4899Q subunits, because these were expected to show marked differences in their K+ conductance (Table 1). Single channels were recorded in 250 mm KCl on both sides of lipid bilayers. We observed in 38 single channel recordings five current levels (Fig. 3B). The averaged conductances were 795 ± 7 pS (n = 4), 632 ± 6 pS (n = 9), 483 ± 4 pS (n = 15), 300 ± 6 pS (n = 8), and 174 pS (n = 2). The highest and lowest currents levels were essentially identical to the averaged currents levels of homozygously expressed WT and D4899Q, respectively (Table 1). Single channel open probability did not vary significantly among the five groups of channel complexes (not shown). Multiple channel recordings were not analyzed. Reduction in cis Ca2+ from 2 μm to 0.1 μm Ca2+ reduced in all single channel recordings Po close to zero, which indicated that the five receptor populations maintained Ca2+ sensitivity (not shown). In Fig. 3E, a plot of K+ conductance versus group number yielded a straight line. To obtain the corresponding Ca2+ currents, channels were recorded at 0 mV in 250 mm symmetrical KCl in presence of 10 mm lumenal Ca2+ (Fig. 3C). Averaged unitary Ca2+ currents ranged from -2.4 ± 0.1 pA in Group 1 to -0.4 ± 0.1 pA in Group 5. Current-voltage relationships in presence of 10 mm lumenal Ca2+ yielded Erev ranging from 8.9 ± 0.1 mV for Group 1 to 1.7 mV for Group 5 (Fig. 3D, Table 2). PCa/PK ratios, calculated according to equation given under “Experimental Procedures,” decreased with Group number parallel with K+ conductance, except that channels in Groups 4 and 5 displayed a similar low permeability ratio close to 1 (Fig. 3E). Taken together, our findings suggest the presence of five groups of channel complexes having the six possible subunit distributions and arrangements shown in Fig. 3A. The results are best accounted for by the two channel configurations with two WT and two mutant subunits having a similar K+ conductance and Ca2+ selectivity, and hence Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 having 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 mutant subunits, respectively.TABLE 2Reversal potentials of homotetrameric and heterotetrameric WT and mutant channel complexes in symmetric KCl solution in the presence of 10 mm lumenal Ca2+ErevGroup 1Group 2Group 3Group 4Group 5mVmVmVmVmVR110W9.1 ± 0.2 (7)aNumber in parentheses indicates number of determinations7.5 ± 0.1 (13)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group6.1 ± 0.2 (3)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group4.8 ± 0.1 (3)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group<0.3 (4)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding groupR110W/L486V9.1 ± 0.2 (7)8.1 ± 0.1 (5)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding groupNDcND, not determinedND<0.3 (13)G4898E8.9 ± 0.1 (11)7.5 ± 0.1 (8)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group6.2 ± 0.2 (5)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group4.4 (2)<0.3 (10)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding groupG4898R9.0 ± 0.2 (5)7.4 ± 0.1 (7)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group6.4 ± 0.1 (6)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group4.5 ± 0.4 (4)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group<0.3 (6)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding groupD4899Q8.9 ± 0.1 (4)7.3 ± 0.3 (4)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group4.9 ± 0.2 (4)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group1.9 ± 0.6 (3)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group1.7 (2)ΔV4926/I49279.0 ± 0.2 (5)7.8 ± 0.1 (6)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding group6.1 ± 0.3 (3)bp < 0.05 compared to preceding groupND<0.3 (6)a Number in parentheses indicates number of determinationsb p < 0.05 compared to preceding groupc ND, not determined Open table in a new tab We next tested the possibility that WT and G4898E form heterotetrameric channel complexes with different ion permeation properties. HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with WT and mutant cDNAs at ratios ranging from 3:1 to 1:4. Fig. 4 shows a representative set of single channel recordings of co-expressed WT and G4898E channels in symmetric 250 mm KCl in absence (A) and presence (B) of 10 mm lumenal Ca2+. According to reversal potentials in presence of 10 mm lumenal Ca2+ (Fig. 4C, Table 2), five groups of single channels were observed. Twenty-six channels (Groups 1–4 in Fig. 4, A and D) maintained Ca2+-dependent channel activity and had a K+ conductance comparable to WT. Of these, 11 single channels had PCa/PK comparable to WT, which suggested that homotetrameric WT channels were recorded. The remaining 15 channels had lower PCa/PK values of 5.1 ± 0.1 (n = 8), 4.1 ± 0.2 (n = 5) and 2.6 ± 0.2 (n = 2), which suggested the presence of three groups (Groups 2–4 in Fig. 4D) of functional hybrid channels composed of WT and G4898E subunits. Single channel open probability at 2 μm cis Ca2+ did not significantly differ among Groups 1–4. Ten channels (Group 5 in Fig. 4) showed a channel behavior similar to homozygously expressed mutant channels. K+ conductance was reduced and Ca2+ dependent activity and Ca2+ permeation were not observed. Taken together, data of Fig. 4 and Table 2 indicate the presence of homotetrameric WT and G4898E channels and 3 different groups of WT:G4898E hybrid channels. The results with the hybrid channels are best rationalized by the channel complexes of Groups 2–4 having 1, 2, and 3 mutant subunits, respectively. As with D4899Q and G4898E, multiple groups of channels could be distinguished when HEK 293 cells were co-transfected with WT and G4898R, R110W, R110W/L486V, or ΔV4926/I4927 RyR1 cDNAs in ratios ranging from 3:1 to 1:4 (Fig. 5 and supplemental Figs. S1–S3). The ion permeation properties of purified channel complexes were determined in symmetric 250 mm KCl in absence and presence of 10 mm lumenal Ca2+ as described above. The results of these studies are summarized in Fig. 5, A–C. Solid and open symbols show channels that maintained Ca2+ sensitivity. Symbols with x-hair represent channels that did not respond to a change in Ca2+ concentration. Unexpectedly, channel complexes composed of WT and G4898E or G4898R subunits exhibited essentially identical ion permeation properties (Fig. 5A).

https://openalex.org/W2052512498,"Background Increased uncoupling protein-2 (UCP-2) expression has been associated with impaired insulin secretion, whereas UCP-3 protein levels are decreased in the skeleton muscle of type-2 diabetic subjects. In the present studies we hypothesize an opposing effect of glucose on the regulation of UCP-2 and UCP-3 in pancreatic islets. Methodology Dominant negative UCP-2 and wild type UCP-3 adenoviruses were generated, and insulin release by transduced human islets was measured. UCP-2 and UCP-3 mRNA levels were determined using quantitative PCR. UCP-2 and UCP-3 protein expression was investigated in human islets cultured in the presence of different glucose concentrations. Human pancreatic sections were analyzed for subcellular localization of UCP-3 using immunohistochemistry. Principal Findings Dominant negative UCP-2 expression in human islets increased insulin secretion compared to control islets (p<0.05). UCP-3 mRNA is expressed in human islets, but the relative abundance of UCP-2 mRNA was 8.1-fold higher (p<0.05). Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed co-localization of UCP-3 protein with mitochondria in human beta-cells. UCP-2 protein expression in human islets was increased ∼2-fold after high glucose exposure, whereas UCP-3 protein expression was decreased by ∼40% (p<0.05). UCP-3 overexpression improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Conclusions UCP-2 and UCP-3 may have distinct roles in regulating beta-cell function. Increased expression of UCP-2 and decreased expression of UCP-3 in humans with chronic hyperglycemia may contribute to impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. These data imply that mechanisms that suppress UCP-2 or mechanisms that increase UCP-3 expression and/or function are potential therapeutic targets to offset defects of insulin secretion in humans with type-2 diabetes."

ATF4 knock-out mice have reduced bone mass (severe osteoporosis) throughout life. Runx2 (runt-related transcription factor 2) is a runt domain-containing transcription factor that is essential for bone formation during embryogenesis and postnatal life. In this study, we identified general transcription factor IIAγ (TFIIAγ) as a Runx2-interacting factor in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Immunoprecipitation assays confirmed that TFIIAγ interacts with Runx2 in osteoblasts and when coexpressed in COS-7 cells or using purified glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay of MC3T3-E1 (clone MC-4) preosteoblast cells showed that in intact cells TFIIAγ is recruited to the region of the osteocalcin promoter previously shown to bind Runx2 and ATF4. A small region of Runx2 (amino acids 258–286) was found to be required for TFIIAγ binding. Although TFIIAγ interacts with Runx2, it does not activate Runx2. Instead, TFIIAγ binds to and activates ATF4. Furthermore, TFIIAγ together with ATF4 and Runx2 stimulates osteocalcin promoter activity and endogenous mRNA expression. Small interfering RNA silencing of TFIIAγ markedly reduces levels of endogenous ATF4 protein and Ocn mRNA in osteoblastic cells. Overexpression of TFIIAγ increases levels of ATF4 protein. Finally, TFIIAγ significantly prevents ATF4 degradation.

Skeletal integrity requires a balance between bone-forming cells (osteoblasts) and bone-resorbing cells or osteoclasts. Imbalance between bone formation and resorption results in metabolic bone diseases such as osteoporosis. Multipotential mesenchymal cells proliferate and differentiate into osteoblasts that synthesize and deposit the mineralizing extracellular matrix of bone. Osteoblast activity is regulated by a number of growth factors and hormones, including bone morphogenetic proteins, insulin-like growth factor 1, basic fibroblast growth factor 2, parathyroid hormone, tumor necrosis factor-α, and extracellular matrix signals (1Yang S.

One of the most striking characteristics of ATF4 protein is its very short half-life (30–60 min) in many cell types (26Hai T. Hartman M.G. Gene (Amst.). 2001; 273: 1-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). ATF4 is rapidly degraded via a ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway. This degradation requires the presence of the serine residue 219 in the context of DSGXXXS within the ATF4 molecule and its phosphorylation by an unknown kinase. This phosphorylation was shown to be required for subsequent recognition by the SCFβTrCP and degradation by the 26 S proteasome (27Lassot I. Segeral E. Berlioz-Torrent C. Durand H. Groussin L. Hai T. Benarous R. Margottin-Goguet F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2192-2202Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Although Atf4 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed, ATF4 protein preferentially accumulates in osteoblasts (28Yang X. Karsenty G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 47109-47114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This accumulation is explained by a selective reduction of proteasomal degradation in osteoblasts. Indeed, inhibition of the ubiquitin/proteasomal pathway by MG115, which blocks the N-terminal threonine in the active site of β-subunit of 26 S proteasomal complex (29Lee D.H. Goldberg A.L. J. Biol.

Chem. 2004; 279: 47109-47114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that modulation of ATF4 stability constitutes an important step to control its protein level and activity and, ultimately, osteoblast-specific gene expression and bone formation. Transcription factor IIA (TFIIA) is a general transcription factor consisting of three subunits designated TFIIAα, TFIIAβ, and TFIIAγ (31Hoiby T. Zhou H. Mitsiou D.J. Stunnenberg H.G. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2007; 1769: 429-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). TFIIA interacts with and stabilizes TFIID (also known as TBP, TATA box-binding protein) to DNA and activates transcription (32Zhou H. Spicuglia S. Hsieh J.J. Mitsiou D.J. Hoiby T. Veenstra G.J.

Although TFIIA was classified as a general transcription factor when it was first identified, more and more evidence shows that this elusive factor may play an important role in the regulation of tissue-specific gene expression via interactions with tissue- or cell type-specific transcription factors (34De Cesare D.

The Ocn promoter has been the major paradigm for unraveling the mechanisms mediating osteoblast-specific gene expression and defining a number of key transcription factors or cofactors (13Ducy P.

However, very few studies have focused on how tissue-specific transcription factors interface with general transcriptional initiation factors in osteoblasts. In this study, by using a combination of a yeast two-hybrid system and pulldown assays as well as functional assays, we show that TFIIAγ, the smallest subunit (12 kDa) of TFIIA (42DeJong J. Bernstein R. Roeder R.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 3313-3317Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), interacts with both Runx2 and ATF4. TFIIAγ delays ATF4 protein degradation and increases its activity. Together with ATF4 and Runx2, TFIIAγ enhances osteoblast-specific Ocn gene expression. Reagents—Tissue culture media were purchased from Invitrogen and fetal bovine serum from HyClone (Logan, UT). Other reagents were obtained from the following sources: antibodies against TFIIA-α, TFIIA-γ, ATF4, Runx2, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated mouse or goat IgG from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA), mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin from Sigma, and GST antibody from Amersham Biosciences. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. Cell Cultures—Mouse MC3T3-E1 subclone 4 (MC-4) cells were described previously (43Xiao G. Cui Y. Ducy P. Karsenty G. Franceschi R.T. Mol.

C2C12 myoblasts, a gift from Dr. Daniel Goldman (University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI), C3H10T1/2 fibroblasts (American Type Culture Collection), and 3T3-L1 mouse preadipocytes (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS. F9 teratocarcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) and rat ROS17/2.8 osteosarcoma cells (gift from Dr. Laurie McCauley, University of Michigan School of Dentistry) were grown in modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS. Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—A yeast pLexA two-hybrid system (Clontech) was used to identify proteins that bind to mouse Runx2. A cDNA fragment encoding the aa-263–351 region of Runx2 was subcloned into the BamHI/XhoI sites of pLexA, creating an in-frame fusion with the DNA binding domain of the LexA gene that is controlled by the strong yeast ADH1 promoter. The resultant plasmid pLexA-Runx2 (aa 263–351) was then transformed into a yeast reporter strain (YM4271), and the transformed cells (1 × 109) were mated for 24 h with cells (2.5 × 108) of a pretransformed two-hybrid library made from human brain cDNA. The resultant mating mixture was spread on 20 × 10-cm plates to select for expression of the LEU2 and lacZ reporter genes. Approximately 2 × 106 colonies were screened. Sixty four positive colonies were isolated. The prey plasmids were extracted from the positive colonies and the cDNA inserts in the plasmids were amplified by PCR and sequenced. Of the 64 positive colonies, 5 are the full-length TFIIAγ cDNAs, and the rest contained 16 different cDNAs.

The full-length cDNA of human TFIIA-γ was cloned by an RT-PCR strategy using total RNA from human Saos2 osteoblastic cells as a template and specific primers (forward, 5′-ATG GCA TAT CAG TTA TAC AGA AA-3′, and reverse, 5′-TTC TGT AGT ATT GGA GCC AGT A-3′). Digested PCR products were purified and subcloned into the NotI/BamHI sites of the pFLAG-5a expression vector (Sigma). Addition of a C-terminal FLAG sequence into the TFIIA-γ cDNA facilitates monitoring of expression levels and immunoprecipitation using M2 antibody (Sigma). GST-TFIIAγ fusion protein expression plasmid was constructed by subcloning the full-length TFIIAγ cDNA into the glutathione S-transferase gene fusion vector pGEX-4T-1 (Amersham Biosciences) in correct reading frame. The accuracy of DNA sequences was verified by automatic sequencing. The size of expressed proteins was confirmed by Western blot analysis using specific antibodies. For expression and functional studies, cells were plated on 35-mm dishes at a density of 5 × 104 cells/cm2. After 24 h, cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid DNAs (0.01 μg of pRL-SV40, 0.25 μg of test luciferase reporter, and 1.0 μg of expression plasmids balanced as necessary with β-galactosidase expression plasmid such that the total DNA was constant) and Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. After 36 h, whole cell extracts were prepared and used for Western blot analysis or dual luciferase assay using the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega, Madison, WI) on a Veritas™ microplate luminometer (Turner Biosystem, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). Firefly luciferase activity was normalized to Renilla luciferase activity for transfection efficiency. RNA Isolation and Reverse Transcription (RT)—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. RT was performed using 2 μg of denatured RNA and 100 pmol of random hexamers (Applied Biosystem, Foster, CA) in a total volume of 25 μl containing 12.5 units of MultiScribe reverse transcriptase (Applied Biosystem, Foster, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Regular PCR—Regular PCR was performed on a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystem, Foster, CA), using 2.5 μl of the cDNA (equivalent to 0.2 μg of RNA) and AmpliTaq DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) in a 25-μl reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA sequences of primers used for PCR were as follows: mouse/rat TFIIAγ, 5′-ATG GCA TAT CAG TTA TAC AGA AAT ACA-3′ (forward), 5′-GGT ATT TTT ACC ATC ACA GGC T-3′(reverse); mouse/rat Atf4, 5′-ATG GCT TGG CCA GTG CCT CAG A-3′ (forward), 5′-GCT CTG GAG TGG AAG ACA GAA C-3′ (reverse); mouse/rat Hprt, 5′-GTT GAG AGA TCA TCT CCA CC-3′ (forward), 5′-AGC GAT GAT GAA CCA GGT TA-3′ (reverse). For all primers the amplification was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 30s followed by 31 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s and extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplified PCR products were run on a 1.2% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Quantitative Real Time PCR—Quantitative real time PCR was performed on an iCycler (Bio-Rad) using a SYBR® Green PCR core kit (Applied Biosystem, Foster, CA) and cDNA equivalent to 10 ng of RNA in a 50-μl reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA sequences of primers used for real time PCR were as follows: mouse Ocn, 5′-TAG TGA ACA GAC TCC GGC GCT A-3′ (forward), 5′-TGT AGG CGG TCT TCA AGC CAT-3′ (reverse); mouse and rat 18 S rRNA, 5′-CGT CTG CCC TAT CAA CTT TCG ATG GTA G-3′ (forward), 5′-GCC TGC TGC CTT CCT TGG ATG T-3′ (reverse); mouse and rat TFIIAγ, 5′-TGG GGA ACA GTC TTC AAG AGA GCC TT-3′ (forward); 5′-TTC CTG ACT CTC TGA GCC AAT GCT G-3′ (reverse); rat Ocn, 5′-TGG TGA ATA GAC TCC GGC GCT ACC T-3′ (forward), 5′-CCT GGA AGC CAA TGT GGT CCG-3′ (reverse); rat Bsp:5′-GGC TGG AGA TGC AGA GGG CAA GGC-3′ (forward), 5′-TGG TGC TGG TGC CGT TGA CGA CCT-3′ (reverse); rat Opn, 5′-TGG TGA ATA GAC TCC GGC GCT ACC T-3′ (forward), 5′-CCT GGA AGC CAA TGT GGT CCG-3′ (reverse). For all primers the amplification was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 15 s and 60 °C for 60 s. Melting curve analysis was used to confirm the specificity of the PCR products. Six samples were run for each primer set. The levels of mRNA were calculated by the ΔCT method (46Wang J. Xi L. Hunt J.L. Gooding W. Whiteside T.L. Chen Z. Godfrey T.E. Ferris R.L. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1861-1866Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Ocn, Bsp, TFIIAγ, osteopontin (Opn), and Atf4 mRNAs were normalized to 18 S rRNA mRNA. Western Blot Analysis—Cells were washed with cold 1× phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1× Passive Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) at room temperature for 20 min. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation (20 min, 13,000 × g, 4 °C). Protein concentrations were determined by the method developed by Bio-Rad. Twenty μg of total protein were fractionated on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell). The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat milk in Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20 (TBST) buffer, probed with antibodies against TFIIA-γ (1:200), TFIIA-α (1:1000), ATF4 (1:1000), Runx2 (1:1000), Fra-1 (1:1000), GST (1:5000), or M2 (1:2000) followed by incubation with anti-goat-mouse or -rabbit antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (1:5000) and visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (Pierce). Finally, blots were stripped two times in buffer containing 65 mm Tris-Cl, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, and 0.7% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol at 65 °C for 15 min and re-probed with β-actin antibody (1:5000) for normalization. Immunoprecipitation—GST, GST-TFIIAγ, GST-ATF4, and GST-Runx2 fusion proteins were purified using the Bulk GST purification module kit (Amersham Biosciences) according the manufacturer's instructions. Whole cell extracts (500 μg), nuclear extracts (200 μg), or GST fusion proteins (1.0 μg) were pre-cleaned twice with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) for 30 min followed by pelleting of beads. The protein A/G-agarose beads were blocked with 10 μg/ml bovine serum albumin in 1× phosphate-buffered saline for 1 h before use to reduce nonspecific binding of proteins. Five μg of respective antibody was added and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with gentle rocking. The immune complexes were collected by addition of 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C followed by centrifugation. Precipitates were washed five times with 1× washing buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.25% Nonidet P-40, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride), and the immunoprecipitated complexes were suspended in SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using the indicated antibodies. ChIP Assays—ChIP assays were performed as described previously (41Roca H. Phimphilai M. Gopalakrishnan R. Xiao G. Franceschi R.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 30845-30855Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) using a protocol kindly provided by Dr. Dwight Towler (Washington University) (47Willis D.M. Loewy A.P.

After sonication, the amount of chromatin was quantified using the PicoGreen double-stranded DNA quantitation assay (Molecular Probes) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The equivalent of 10 μg of DNA was used as starting material (input) in each ChIP reaction with 2 μg of the appropriate antibody (TFIIAγ, or control rabbit IgG). Fractions of the purified ChIP DNA (5%) or inputs (0.02–0.05%) were used for PCR analysis. The reaction was performed with AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosystems) for 35 cycles of 60 s at 95 °C, 90 s at 58 °C, and 120 s at 68 °C. PCR primer pairs were generated to detect DNA segments located near the Runx2-binding site at -137/-131 (primers P1 and P2), ATF4-binding site at -55/-48 (primers P3 and P4) in mouse osteocalcin gene 2 (mOG2) proximal promoter, or the Runx2-binding site located between -370 and -42 in the proximal mouse Runx2 promoter region (primers P5 and P6) (48Xiao Z.S. Liu S.G. Hinson T.K. Quarles L.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 647-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the mOG2 gene region (+177/+311) (primers P7 and P8) (see Fig. 2A and Table"

The ERRα gene is estrogen-responsive in several mouse tissues and cell lines, and a multiple hormone-response element (MHRE) in the promoter is an important regulatory region for estrogen-induced ERRα gene expression. ERRα was recently shown to be a negative prognostic factor for breast cancer survival, with its expression being highest in cancer cells lacking functional ERα. The contribution of ERRα in breast cancer progression remains unknown but may have important clinical implications. In this study, we investigated ERRα gene expression and chromatin structural changes under the influence of 17β-estradiol in both ER-positive MCF-7 and ER-negative SKBR3 breast cancer cells. We mapped the nucleosome positions of the ERRα promoter around the MHRE region and found that the MHRE resides within a single nucleosome.

Interestingly, estrogen-induced chromatin structural changes could be repressed by estrogen antagonist ICI 182 780 in MCF-7 cells yet were enhanced in SKBR3 cells. We demonstrated, using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, that 17β-estradiol induces ERRα gene expression in MCF-7 cells through active recruitment of co-activators and release of co-repressors when ERRα and AP1 bind and ERα is tethered to the MHRE.

Upon binding of a single ligand molecule, the ERs homodimerize and interact directly with estrogen-response elements (ERE) in the regulatory sequences of estrogen target genes (5Klinge C.M.

In the absence of an ERE, the ERs may still engage via tethering to transcription factors that are bound to a target gene promoter (6Gaub M.P. Bellard M. Scheuer I. Chambon P. Sassone-Corsi P.

E2 also elicits various physiological responses that cannot be totally explained by classic ER-mediated actions in the nucleus (see review in 12 and references therein).

In contrast to the ERs, the estrogen-related receptors (ERR) -α,-β, and -γ all are orphan nuclear receptors with a high degree of sequence identity to the ERs but do not bind estrogens or any other known natural ligands (18Nuclear Receptors Nomenclature Committee Cell. 1999; 97: 161-163Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (945) Google Scholar, 19Giguere V.

ERα is reportedly present in 75% of clinical breast tumor samples and correlates to a more favorable response to endocrine therapy compared with ERα-negative cancers (42Clark G.M. McGuire W.L. Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 1983; 3: S69-S72Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Interestingly, recent clinical studies implicate ERRα as having a potential role in breast cancer progression (43Ariazi E.A. Clark G.M. Mertz J.E. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 6510-6518PubMed Google Scholar, 44Suzuki T. Miki Y. Moriya T. Shimada N. Ishida T. Hirakawa H. Ohuchi N. Sasano H. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4670-4676Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) based largely on its greater prevalence in ERα-negative tumors and correlation with ErbB2, a known marker of aggressive tumors (45Hynes N.E. Stern D.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1994; 1198: 165-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (1002) Google Scholar). Hence, positive ERRα expression is increasingly associated with an adverse clinical outcome and decreased chance of survival in breast cancer patients (46Ariazi E.A. Jordan V.C. Curr. Top. Med. Chem. 2006; 6: 203-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 47Stein R.A. McDonnell D.P. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 2006; 13: S25-S32Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). ERRα may promote the growth of breast cancers by increasing local estrogen synthesis as it is reported to stimulate the expression of CYP19A1 (P450 aromatase) (48Chen S. Zhou D. Okubo T. Kao Y.C. Yang C. Endocr.-Relat. Cancer. 1999; 6: 149-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 49Yang C. Zhou D. Chen S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 5695-5700PubMed Google Scholar) and SULT2A1 (50Seely J. Amigh K.S. Suzuki T. Mayhew B. Sasano H. Giguere V. Laganiere J. Carr B.R. Rainey W.E. Endocrinology. 2005; 146: 3605-3613Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), enzymes that contribute to estrogen biosynthesis. Furthermore, we have previously demonstrated that the ERRα gene, ESRRA, is an ER-dependent estrogen target in certain estrogen-responsive tissues and cell lines (21Shigeta H. Zuo W. Yang N. DiAugustine R. Teng C.T. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 19: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 51Liu D. Zhang Z. Gladwell W. Teng C.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4894-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). At this time, however, the contribution of ERRα to hormone resistance and tumor progression in breast cancers remains unknown but may have vital clinical implications. In eukaryotes, genomic DNA is associated with histone proteins to form nucleosomes, the basic unit of chromatin (52Luger K. Mader A.W. Richmond R.K. Sargent D.F. Richmond T.J. Nature. 1997; 389: 251-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (6927) Google Scholar). The structure of the nucleosome, and chromatin as a whole, is inherently prohibitive to gene expression because it precludes the access of transcription factors, such as the ERs and ERRs, to specific regulatory regions (53Chen J. Kinyamu H.K. Archer T.K. Mol. Endocrinol. 2006; 20: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 54Kouzarides T. Cell. 2007; 128: 693-705Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8092) Google Scholar, 55Li B. Carey M. Workman J.L. Cell. 2007; 128: 707-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2684) Google Scholar). Because ERRα is a constitutively active protein, transcriptional regulation of the ERRα gene may be a primary mechanism for modulating its activity. Hence, the chromatin structure of the ERRα gene warrants investigation. In this study, we used the breast cancer cell lines to characterize the nucleosomal arrangement in an area of the ERRα gene that is known to harbor an MHRE (51Liu D. Zhang Z. Gladwell W. Teng C.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4894-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that E2 modulates the local chromatin architecture and histone acetylation levels around the MHRE region in both ER-positive (ER+) and ER-negative (ER–) breast cancer cells. Further probing of mechanistic insights has shown that in ER+ cells ERRα gene expression requires ERRα and AP1 binding, along with ERα being tethered to the MHRE or a nearby AP1 element, favors recruitment of co-activators and release of co-repressors, and ultimately leads to increased ERRα gene expression. Although the mechanisms by which E2 modulates ERRα expression in ER– cells is not yet clear, our studies show that the nucleosome organization of the ERRα gene and E2-induced chromatin modification is similar to that in the ER+ cells. Furthermore, we have shown that the MAPK signaling pathway is required for estrogen action in both cell lines by using a MAPK inhibitor.

Anti-phosphorylated RNA polymerase II (Ab5131) was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, MA). Cells Culture and Nuclei Preparation—MCF-7 cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium. SKBR3 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. In both cases, the media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, and the cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with 5% CO2. At least 2 days prior to all hormonal treatments, the cells were switched to phenol red-free modified Eagle's medium containing 5% charcoal-stripped fetal bovine serum. Treatments consisted of vehicle (ethanol), 10 nm E2, 1 μm ICI, or 5 μm PD98059 or combinations thereof for multiple time points as indicated by the individual experiment. Nuclei were prepared as described previously (58Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were rinsed and detached from the dish using a rubber policeman in the presence of cold phosphate-buffered saline and pelleted by centrifugation at 750 × g at 4 °C for 5 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in homogenization buffer containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated on ice for 2 min before being lysed by 5 strokes of pestle A in a Dounce homogenizer. Nuclei were sedimented through a 10% sucrose pad by centrifugation at 1,400 × g for 20 min, washed with washing buffer to remove traces of Nonidet P-40, and collected by centrifugation at 750 × g for 5 min. The nuclei preparations were then kept on ice until use. Micrococcal Nuclease Analysis—Isolated nuclei were suspended in 200 μl of washing buffer supplemented with 1 mm CaCl2 and then digested with 0–50 units of MNase for 5 min at 30 °C. The reactions were stopped by the addition of 40 μ1 of 100 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA (pH 8.0). Genomic DNA was then purified, digested with the appropriate restriction enzyme (as indicated), and analyzed by Southern blot or reiterative PCR. The first control DNA (C1) was prepared by digestion of purified genomic DNA with 1 unit of MNase/ml for 5 min at 30 °C. The second control DNA (C2) was prepared by double digestion of purified genomic DNA with MNase/ml and the appropriate restriction enzyme. Southern Blotting and Reiterative PCR—For Southern blot analysis, 20 μg of MNase-digested DNA per sample was separated on a 1.5% agarose gel, transferred to Hybond N+ membrane (GE Healthcare), and probed with 32P-radiolabeled DNA fragments. Probe A was radiolabeled by PCR (Fig. 1), and probe B was radiolabeled by random priming (Ready-to-Go beads; GE Healthcare) of the PstI/SphI genomic fragment (Fig. 1) (51Liu D. Zhang Z. Gladwell W.

Nuclear protein extracts were prepared by using the BD™ TransFactor extraction kit according to the supplier's instruction (Clontech) and used for ERα and ERβ detection. Whole cell lysates were prepared for ERRα detection. Protein concentrations were determined (Bradford protein assay, Bio-Rad) and were separated by SDS-10% polyacrylamide gel and 4% stacking gel with Bio-Rad Miniprotein apparatus. After electrophoresis, the proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Invitrogen) and probed with antibodies specific to ERα and ERRα. RNA Isolation, Reverse Transcription, and Real Time RT-PCR—Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy mini kit according to the supplier's protocol (Qiagen). For RT-PCR analyses, cDNA was synthesized as described previously (59Fryer C.J. Archer T.K. Nature. 1998; 393: 88-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). Real time RT-PCR was performed for ERRα and β2-microglobulin gene with Applied Biosystems 7900HT real time PCR System and Taqman Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). Average cycle threshold (Ct) values for ERRα were calculated and normalized to Ct values for β2-microglobulin. Power SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) was used for pS2, c-Myc, and β2-actin genes. Average Ct values for pS2 or c-Myc were calculated and normalized to Ct values for β2-actin. All the primer and probe sequences are presented in Table 1. Restriction Enzyme Hypersensitivity Analysis—Cell nuclei were prepared after experimental treatment and digested in vivo with MslI, ApoI, or ApaI at 30 °C for 15 min as described previously (58Archer T.K. Cordingley M.G. Wolford R.G. Hager G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 688-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The genomic DNA was then purified and digested in vitro with StuI or SphI. The digested DNA fragments were then amplified by reiterative primer extension as described above. The PCR-extended products were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction, ethanol precipitation, and analyzed on 8% denaturing polyacrylamide gels. The bands densities were measured by Kodak 1D program, and the percentage of cleavage was calculated as in vivo band density relative to the total band density. In Vitro Protein Translation, Nuclear Protein Preparation, and Electrophoresis Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA)—ERα and ERβ were in vitro transcribed and translated using the TnT Coupled Reticulocyte Lysate Systems according to the supplier's instructions (Promega, Madison, WI). Nuclear proteins of the MCF-7 cells were prepared with the TransFactor extraction kit (Clontech). The MHRE fragment was cut from the AAB-CAT reporter (51Liu D. Zhang Z. Gladwell W. Teng C.T. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 4894-4904Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) by NheI and XhoI digestion, gel-purified, and used as the probe in EMSA. The double-stranded MHRE oligos were labeled with [32P]dGTP by fill-in with Klenow large fragment of DNA polymerase I. The antibodies for supershift experiments for ERα were TE111.5D11 from Neo-Marker (Fremont, CA), ERβ, clone 9.88, IgM, from Sigma, and human lactoferrin antibody prepared in our laboratory (60Teng C.T.

Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay—Native ChIP was used to evaluate histone modifications in cells following treatments (61O'Neill L.P. Turner B.M. Methods (San Diego). 2003; 31: 76-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Briefly, isolated nuclei were digested with MNase until the chromatin became mono- to trinucleosome in size. ChIP analyses were carried out by using the ChIP assay kit (Upstate Biotechnologies) with minor modifications. Native chromatin was diluted with ChIP dilution buffer and precleared with 80 μl of a salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose for 30 min with agitation at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight (10–14 h) at 4 °C with specific antibodies or with rabbit IgG as a control. After immunoprecipitation, 60 μl of salmon sperm DNA-protein A-agarose were added for 1 more h at 4 °C to capture the immune protein-DNA complexes. The immunoprecipitants were sequentially washed according to instructions, and the immune complexes were eluted with 1% SDS in 0.1 m NaHCO3, and the DNA was purified by phenol/ethanol extraction and precipitation. To study the transcription factor and co-regulator occupancy, standard ChIP was performed in which the chromatin was first cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37 °C for 20 min. The crude cell lysates were sonicated to shear the chromatin to 400–1200-bp size as verified by the agarose gel electrophoresis, and the ChIP assays were performed. After elution, the chromatin was reverse cross-linked with 0.2 m NaCl at 65 °C for 6 h and then the DNA was purified. In Re-ChIP experiments, complexes were eluted by incubation with 10 mm dithiothreitol at 37 °C for 30 min, diluted 1:50× in ChIP dilution buffer, followed by re-immunoprecipitation with the second antibodies (62Shang Y. Hu X. DiRenzo J. Lazar M.A. Brown M. Cell. 2000; 103: 843-852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1452) Google Scholar) or rabbit IgG as a control. DNA product was detected by PCR with specific forward and reverse primer sequences (Table 1). The PCR conditions were 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s for a total of 30–35 cycles. Real time PCR was performed with Power SYBR Green QPCR master mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the supplier's instruction. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were carried out using the Student t test. p values of <0.05 were considered to be statistically significant. The ERRα Gene MHRE Is Assembled Over a Single Nucleosome—We demonstrated previously that estrogen stimulation of the ERRα expression is mediated through the MHRE located between bp –709 to –649 of the ERRα promoter (51Liu D.

https://openalex.org/W2146473864,"Activation of the fibroblast growth factor (FGFR) and melanocyte stimulating hormone (MC1R) receptors stimulates B-Raf and C-Raf isoforms that regulate the dynamics of MAPK1,2 signaling. Network topology motifs in mammalian cells include feed-forward and feedback loops and bifans where signals from two upstream molecules integrate to modulate the activity of two downstream molecules. We computationally modeled and experimentally tested signal processing in the FGFR/MC1R/B-Raf/C-Raf/MAPK1,2 network in human melanoma cells; identifying 7 regulatory loops and a bifan motif. Signaling from FGFR leads to sustained activation of MAPK1,2, whereas signaling from MC1R results in transient activation of MAPK1,2. The dynamics of MAPK activation depends critically on the expression level and connectivity to C-Raf, which is critical for a sustained MAPK1,2 response. A partially incoherent bifan motif with a feedback loop acts as a logic gate to integrate signals and regulate duration of activation of the MAPK signaling cascade. Further reducing a 106-node ordinary differential equations network encompassing the complete network to a 6-node network encompassing rate-limiting processes sustains the feedback loops and the bifan, providing sufficient information to predict biological responses."

Because a chimeric integrin, αIIbβ3/β1, in which the β3 tail was replaced with the β1 tail was constitutively active, we searched for the residues responsible for integrin activation among the residues that differed between the β3 and β1 tails. Single amino acid substitutions of Ile-719 and Glu-749 in the β3 membrane-proximal and -distal regions, respectively, with the corresponding β1 residues or alanine rendered αIIbβ3 constitutively active. The I719M/E749S double mutant had the same ligand binding activity as αIIbβ3/β1. These β3 mutations also induced αVβ3 activation. Conversely, substitution of Met-719 or Ser-749 in the β1 tail with the corresponding β3 tail residue (M719I or S749E) inhibited αIIbβ3/β1 activation, and the M719I/S749E double mutant inhibited ligand binding to a level comparable with that of the wild-type αIIbβ3. Knock down of talin by short hairpin RNA inhibited the I719M- and E749S-induced αIIbβ3 activation. These results suggest that the β3 membrane-proximal and -distal residues cooperatively regulate talin-mediated αIIbβ3 activation. Integrin cytoplasmic tails regulate integrin activation that is required for high affinity binding with ligands.

Platelet integrin αIIbβ3 is a transmembrane receptor that mediates platelet adhesion and aggregation (1Shattil S.J. Newman P.J.

Investig. 2005; 115: 3363-3369Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). αIIbβ3 exists in a low affinity state in resting platelets and requires activation for high affinity binding with soluble ligands (1Shattil S.J.

Activation of αIIbβ3 is tightly linked to structural rearrangements of the αIIbβ3 molecule. Recent crystal and NMR structure studies have revealed the precise conformational changes that occur during these rearrangements, including separation of the cytoplasmic, transmembrane, and extracellular leg domains of the αIIb and β3 subunits, a switchblade-like extension from a bent to an extended conformation of the extracellular domains, outward swing of the hybrid domain, and structural rearrangements of the head domain containing a ligand binding pocket (3Vinogradova O.

This long range conformational transduction is initiated from the cytoplasmic tails of the αIIb and β3 subunits in the integrin activation process referred to as inside-out signaling. Several NMR analyses have identified multiple hydrophobic and electrostatic contacts within the membrane-proximal helices of the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic tails (3Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A.

Therefore, it is considered that the membrane-proximal regions of the αIIb and β3 cytoplasmic tails associate to form a clasp, maintaining αIIbβ3 in a low affinity state. On the other hand, the structural basis of the membrane-distal regions of the αIIb and β3 tails is less obvious. The structure of the αIIb membrane-distal region has been explored by NMR. Analysis of the myristoylated peptide containing the entire αIIb tail sequence revealed that the membrane-distal loop folded back toward the membrane-proximal helix, while this conformation was not observed in recent analysis of the αIIb tail in a membrane-embedding environment (5Vinogradova O.

These findings suggest that the membrane-distal region of the αIIb tail suppresses energy-dependent αIIbβ3 activation, although the mechanism responsible for activation of the αIIbβ3 mutants remains unclear.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that the β3 membrane-distal region plays a stimulatory, and not inhibitory, role in αIIbβ3 activation. In view of the link between integrin activation and allosteric structural rearrangements of the extracellular segments of integrins (23Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar), one would expect that structural changes in the β3 membrane-distal region containing binding sites for intracellular proteins would be relayed to the membrane-proximal region, leading to αIIbβ3 activation. However, there has been no evidence that structural rearrangement of the β3 membrane-distal region is directly linked to integrin activation. Except for the talin binding site, the structure of the β3 membrane-distal region is ill-defined, and no activating mutation has so far been reported in the β3 membrane-distal region. In this context, we considered that a previously reported αIIbβ3 mutant in which the β3 tail was replaced by the β1 tail was noteworthy (24Calderwood D.A. Huttenlocher A. Kiosses W.B. Rose D.M. Woodside D.G. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). This chimeric integrin, αIIbβ3/β1, was constitutively active. Because the β1 and β3 subunits have relatively high sequence homology, we reasoned that the residues differing between the β1 and β3 tails are responsible for αIIbβ3 activation. The β3 and β1 tails have 20 residues that differ, and 18 of them are located in the membrane-distal region, raising the possibility that the membrane-distal residue(s) may contribute to αIIbβ3 activation. In this study, we attempted to identify the critical residue(s) for regulation of αIIbβ3 activation using a model of activated αIIbβ3, αIIbβ3/β1. We obtained evidence that structural perturbation of specific residues in the β3 membrane-distal region can induce αIIbβ3 activation and that the membrane-proximal and -distal residues in the β3 tail cooperatively regulate talin-mediated αIIbβ3 activation.

Two recombinant β3 fragments were generated from a full-length β3 cDNA template by PCR with Pfu polymerase and complementary primers containing the desired mutations. These two fragments were combined and subjected to PCR using primers containing HindIII and XbaI restriction sites at the 5′- and 3′-ends of β3, respectively. The amplified PCR product was digested with HindIII/XbaI and cloned into a mammalian expression vector, pCDNA3 (Invitrogen). The nucleotide sequences of the inserts were confirmed by sequence analysis. Expression of Recombinant Integrins—The mutated β3 and wild-type αIIb cDNAs were cotransfected into Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Human 293T cells were also used for transfection. The cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum for 48 h to achieve cell surface expression of the recombinant integrins. Ligand Binding Assay—PAC1 and fibrinogen binding assays were performed as described previously (15Yamanouchi J. Hato T. Tamura T. Fujita S. Biochem.

CHO cells were suspended in Tyrode's buffer (137 mm NaCl, 12 mm NaHCO3, 2.6 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes, 5.5 mm glucose, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, pH 7.4) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with 10 μg/ml PAC1 and 5 μg/ml biotin-labeled 4B10 in the presence of 2 mm RGDS peptide or buffer. The cells were then washed and resuspended in a mixture of a 1:20 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgM antibody (BIOSOURCE, Camarillo, CA) and a 1:50 dilution of phycoerythrin-streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 25 min on ice. Then, 1 μl of 1 mg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma) was added. After 5 min the cells were washed and resuspended in 500 μl of ice-cold Tyrode's buffer and analyzed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). After electronic compensation, PAC1 binding (FL1) was analyzed on the gated subset of live cells (propidium iodide-negative, FL3) that were positive for αIIbβ3 expression (FL2). In the assays for fibrinogen binding to αIIbβ3, fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated fibrinogen was used instead of PAC1. The binding of fibrinogen to αVβ3 in CHO cells was measured as described previously (25Yamanouchi J. Hato T. Tamura T. Fujita S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Talin Knock Down—Knock down of talin expression in CHO cells was performed by the small interfering RNA technique according to the method of Tadokoro et al. (18Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). CHO cells were transfected with plasmids encoding αIIb cDNA, β3 cDNA, and shRNAs targeting talin-1. Scrambled shRNA was used as a control. A preparation without shRNA transfection was included as another control. The cells were cultured for 72 h to allow the shRNA to exert its maximal inhibitory effect (18Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). The transfected cells were then subjected to ligand binding assay as described above. To assess talin expression, CHO cells were transfected with shRNA and pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech). The cells were then fixed with 0.5% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% saponin, and incubated for 30 min at room temperature with anti-talin-1 and -2 monoclonal antibody 8d4 (Sigma). After washing, the cells were incubated for 30 min on ice with phycoerythrin-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (BIOSOURCE). They were then washed and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.025% saponin, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and 1 μg/ml propidium iodide. Binding of 8d4 antibody to talin was analyzed using flow cytometry by gating propium iodide-negative live cells that were positive for green fluorescent protein expression. Mutation of the Ile-719 and Glu-749 Residues in the β3 Tail Activates β3 Integrins—To identify the residues critical for regulation of αIIbβ3 activation in the β3 tail, we focused on amino acids in the β3 tail that differed from those in the β1 tail as the αIIbβ3/β1 chimeric integrin, in which the β3 tail is replaced with the β1 tail, has been reported to be constitutively active (24Calderwood D.A. Huttenlocher A. Kiosses W.B. Rose D.M. Woodside D.G. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). We produced 13 αIIbβ3 mutants in which the individual or group residues in the β3 tail were substituted with the corresponding β1 tail residues (Fig. 1). The αIIbβ3 mutants were expressed on the surface of CHO cells by cotransfection of mutant β3 and wild-type αIIb cDNAs, and surface expression of αIIbβ3 was determined by flow cytometry using a non-function-blocking anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody, 4B10 (15Yamanouchi J. Hato T. Tamura T. Fujita S. Biochem. J. 2004; 379: 317-323Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Yamanouchi J. Hato T. Tamura T. Fujita S. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2002; 87: 756-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The expression of αIIbβ3 mutants on the cell surface was 93-136% that of the wild-type αIIbβ3, indicating almost equivalent expression of the mutated integrins (Fig. 2A). Among these mutants, αIIbβ3 bearing the β3I719M or β3E749S mutation bound significantly higher levels of PAC1 than wild-type αIIbβ3 without any stimulation and the RGDS peptide abolished PAC1 binding to the mutants, indicating a constitutively active state (Fig. 2B). Other mutants, as well as wild-type αIIbβ3, were in a low affinity state. To determine whether activation of αIIbβ3 by I719M and E749S mutation is due to loss of Ile-719 and Glu-749 residues or insertion of methionine and serine into the β3 tail, we examined the effects on PAC1 binding of I719A and E749A mutants in which the residues concerned were replaced with alanine. I719A and E749A bound the same level of PAC1 as I719M and E749S did, suggesting that loss of the side chains of Ile-719 and Glu-749 residues is responsible for αIIbβ3 activation (Fig. 2B).FIGURE 2Homology-scanning mutagenesis of the β3 tail residues. A, expression of αIIbβ3 mutants in CHO cells. CHO cells were transfected with cDNAs for wild-type (WT) αIIb and β3 bearing the indicated mutation or WT β3. Binding of 4B10 anti-αIIbβ3 monoclonal antibody to cells was measured by flow cytometry. The amounts bound were expressed as percentages of the value for 4B10 binding to cells expressing WT αIIbβ3. B, PAC1 binding to αIIbβ3 mutants. PAC1 and 4B10 binding to cells was measured simultaneously by flow cytometry. The mean fluorescence intensity (mfi) of specific (RGDS-inhibitable) PAC1 binding was divided by that of 4B10 binding for assessment on a per-αIIbβ3 molecule basis. The data presented are means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. The asterisks denote a significant difference (p < 0.05) compared with the WT value.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although the I719M and E749S mutants were constitutively active, each exhibited less PAC1 binding than the αIIbβ3/β1-activating integrin in which the entire β3 tail was replaced by the β1 tail (Fig. 3). Because we screened all the β3 tail residues that were different from the β1 residues, it is unlikely that tail residues other than Ile-719 and Glu-749 are involved in αIIbβ3/β1 activation. To clarify whether the combination of I719M and E749S mutations was able to reproduce an activating state comparable with αIIbβ3/β1, we produced the I719M/E749S double mutant. This mutant was expressed normally on the surface of CHO cells and showed more PAC1 binding than the single mutants, reaching the same level of PAC1 binding as αIIbβ3/β1 (Fig. 3). Similar effects were observed when soluble fibrinogen, a physiological ligand for αIIbβ3, was used instead of PAC1 (Fig. 3). Similar results were also obtained when human 293T cells were used instead of CHO cells (data not shown). These results suggest that mutation of the membrane-proximal Ile-719 and membrane-distal Glu-749 residues in the β3 tail has an additive effect on αIIbβ3 activation and that activation of the chimeric integrin αIIbβ3/β1 can be recapitulated by double mutations of Ile-719 and Glu-749 residues in the β3 tail. The β3 subunit can associate with αIIb and αV subunits, forming αIIbβ3 and αVβ3 integrins. To determine whether the mutations of the β3 tail responsible for αIIbβ3 activation also give rise to αVβ3 activation, recombinant αVβ3 was expressed on the surface of CHO cells by transfection with wild-type αV and mutant β3 cDNAs. The surface expression of mutant αVβ3 was comparable with that of wild-type αVβ3. The αVβ3I719M and αVβ3E749S mutants exhibited significant fibrinogen binding without any stimulation, and the I719M/E749S double mutant bound more fibrinogen, reaching the same level of fibrinogen as αVβ3/β1 (Fig. 4). These results suggest that β3I719M and αVβ3E749S mutations activate αVβ3 as well as αIIbβ3. Introduction of the β3I719 and β3E749 Residues into the β1 Tail Suppresses Integrin Activation—The foregoing results showed that the I719M and E749S mutations were responsible for activation of the αIIbβ3/β1 chimeric integrin. We next examined whether the converse mutations, M719I and S749E, prevented αIIbβ3/β1 activation. The M719I and S749E αIIbβ3/β1 mutants reduced PAC1 binding significantly, even though expression of these mutants was sufficient (Fig. 5). The M719I/S749E double mutant reduced PAC1 binding to a level comparable with wild-type αIIbβ3. These results are consistent with the foregoing results obtained with αIIbβ3I719M and αIIbβ3E749S mutations and further suggest the cooperative role of the β3I719 and β3E749 residues in regulation of αIIbβ3 activation. The β3I719 and β3E749 Residues Suppress Talin-dependent αIIbβ3 Activation—To explore the mechanism of αIIbβ3 activation by the Ile-719 and Glu-749 mutations, we examined whether activation of these mutant integrins is mediated by talin, a final common element of signaling pathways to integrin activation (18Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Knock down of talin was carried out by the use of shRNA and was confirmed by inhibition of talin expression in CHO cells by 66% (Fig. 6A). This inhibitory effect was the same as that shown in the previous study (18Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar). Talin knock down significantly reduced PAC1 binding to the CHO cells expressing the mutant αIIbβ3, whereas control shRNA had no effect (Fig. 6B). This result indicates that both the I719M and E749S mutations induce αIIbβ3 activation in a talin-dependent manner, suggesting that the β3I719 and β3E749 residues suppress talin-mediated αIIbβ3 activation to retain αIIbβ3 in a default low affinity state. In this study, we have identified two residues in the β3 tail, Ile-719 and Glu-749, that are critical for maintaining αIIbβ3 in a low affinity state. Ile-719 is located in the membrane-proximal region of the β3 tail and binds to the αIIb tail in NMR structure models (3Vinogradova O. Velyvis A. Velyviene A. Hu B. Haas T. Plow E. Qin J.

Because the membrane-proximal interface between the α and β tails forms a clasp to maintain integrins at a low affinity state (23Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar), one would expect that mutations within the membrane-proximal clasping region would activate integrins. A simple explanation for αIIbβ3 activation by Ile-719 mutation is that loss of the bond between the β3I719 and the αIIb tail directly disrupts the membrane-proximal clasp. Although the Ile-719-mediated contact is only part of the multiple hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions within the clasp, disturbing this specific contact may weaken the interaction and facilitate αIIbβ3 activation. However, the Ile-719 mutation-induced αIIbβ3 activation is talin-dependent, as demonstrated in this study. A similar mutational effect on αIIbβ3 activation has been demonstrated for the Asp-723 residue in the β3 membrane-proximal region (18Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J. Eto K. Tai V. Liddington R.C. de Pereda J.M. Ginsberg M.H. Calderwood D.A. Science. 2003; 302: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (987) Google Scholar, 27Hughes P.E. Diaz-Gonzalez F. Leong L. Wu C.Y. McDonald J.A. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6571-6574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (511) Google Scholar). Talin binds to not only the β3 membrane-distal region but also the β3 membrane-proximal region, and a recent study has shown that binding of talin to the latter is critical for αIIbβ3 activation (17Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that structural changes around the β3 membrane-proximal Ile-719 and Asp-723 residues give access to the talin protein, thereby activating αIIbβ3. Another activating mutation of the β3 tail residue, Glu-749, is intriguing. Unlike Ile-719, Glu-749 is located in the β3 membrane-distal region. This region directly interacts with many signaling and cytoskeletal molecules, including tyrosine kinases and talin, that are involved in the inside-out signaling pathway (18Tadokoro S. Shattil S.J.

Cell Biol. 2004; 165: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Deletion or mutation of the β3 membrane-distal region has been reported to result in failure of αIIbβ3 activation by inside-out signaling (19Chen Y-P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.-M.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These studies clearly demonstrate that the β3 membrane-distal region functions as a receiver of intracellular signals activating αIIbβ3. Because integrin activation is brought about by allosteric structural rearrangement of each extracellular segment of integrins (23Hynes R.O. Cell. 2002; 110: 673-687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6955) Google Scholar), it is likely that the structural changes in the β3 membrane-distal region following interaction with intracellular molecules are relayed to the membrane-proximal region, leading to αIIbβ3 activation. However, there is no direct evidence that the structural rearrangement of the β3 membrane-distal region induces integrin activation. Our present study shows that a single amino acid mutation of the β3 membrane-distal residue Glu-749 activates αIIbβ3 in a talin-dependent manner. No such activating mutation has been found in the β3 membrane-distal region despite numerous reports of loss-of-function mutations in this region (19Chen Y-P. Djaffar I. Pidard D. Steiner B. Cieutat A.-M. Caen J.P. Rosa J.-P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10169-10173Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 20Wang R.G. Shattil S.J. Ambruso D.R. Newman P.J. J. Clin.

Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 329-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Our result provides experimental evidence that structural perturbation of the β3 membrane-distal region is linked to integrin activation through talin binding. Furthermore, we have found that the β3E749S mutation activates αVβ3 and that αVβ3/β1 is constitutively active although αV can associate with β1, forming integrin αVβ1. This finding suggests that E749S-induced integrin activation is not ascribed to simple dissociation of the β3 tail from the α tail but to the structural change in the β3 membrane-distal region. Talin binds to the 739WDTANNPLYK sequence that is outside Glu-749 (16Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). However, Glu-749 is adjacent to this talin binding site and NMR perturbation of Glu-749 by interaction with talin has been observed (16Garcia-Alvarez B. de Pereda J.M. Calderwood D.A. Ulmer T.S. Critchley D. Campbell I.D. Ginsberg M.H. Liddington R.C. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 49-58Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that the Glu-749 mutation has a direct effect on talin binding and thus affects αIIbβ3 activation through talin-mediated mechanism. To demonstrate this hypothesis, a direct binding assay for interaction of talin with recombinant β3 tails is necessary. Unfortunately, we were unable to perform such an assay because detection of low affinity integrin-talin interactions requires integrin tails connected with specially designed model proteins bearing coiled-coil and glycine spacer structures that were not commercially available (30Pfaff M. Liu S.C. Erle D.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6104-6109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Talin was recently reported to compete with filamin for binding to the β3 tail, and this competition may regulate integrin activation (31Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C.L. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Filamin binds to the 745PLYKEATSTFTN sequence encompassing Glu-749 (31Kiema T. Lad Y. Jiang P. Oxley C.L. Baldassarre M. Wegener K.L. Campbell I.D. Ylanne J. Calderwood D.A. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 337-347Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that reduced binding of filamin to the E749S mutant results in more talin binding, leading to αIIbβ3 activation. However, this mechanism is unlikely because the β1 tail bound much less filamin than the β7 tail although both tails have serine at the β3E749 position, indicating that E749S is not a determinant of filamin binding affinity (24Calderwood D.A. Huttenlocher A. Kiosses W.B. Rose D.M. Woodside D.G. Schwartz M.A. Ginsberg M.H. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 1060-1068Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). A recent NMR analysis has demonstrated that the β3 membrane-distal NPLY motif is anchored to the membrane surface and that this membrane anchoring may restrict binding of talin to the β3 tail to constrain αIIbβ3 in a default low affinity state (5Vinogradova O. Vaynberg J. Kong X. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4094-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Because Glu-749 lies within the helix flanking the NPLY loop (5Vinogradova O. Vaynberg J. Kong X. Haas T.A. Plow E.F. Qin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 4094-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar), Glu-749 mutation may release the membrane anchoring of the NPLY, thus facilitating talin binding to the β3 tail. This hypothesis could account for talin-dependent activation of αIIbβ3 by Glu-749 mutation. Structural analysis of the talin/Glu-749 mutant complex at the atomic level will be required to verify this hypothesis. Because the β3 membrane-distal region binds intracellular signaling molecules, it is possible that Glu-749 mutation affects the interaction of these proteins with the membrane-distal tail that regulates αIIbβ3 activation. The β3E749 residue is critical for binding of some phosphotyrosine-binding proteins, including Dok1 and Numb (32Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Dok1 competes with talin for binding to the β3 tail and has the ability to inhibit αIIbβ3 activation (17Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). It is therefore possible that reduced binding of Dok1 to the β3E749S tail results in increased binding of talin, thereby activating αIIbβ3, although overexpression of Dok1 is required for partial inhibition of αIIbβ3 activation (17Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). The effect of Numb on integrin signaling is unknown. Another phosphotyrosine-binding protein, Dab2, binds to the β3 tail and functions as a negative regulator of αIIbβ3 activation (33Huang C.L. Cheng J.C. Liao C.H. Stern A. Hsieh J.T. Wang C.H. Hsu H.L. Tseng C.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 42279-42289Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, it is unlikely that Dab2 is involved in the mechanism of E749S-induced αIIbβ3 activation because the E749S mutation had no effect on Dab2 binding (32Calderwood D.A. Fujioka Y. de Pereda J.M. Garcia-Alvarez B. Nakamoto T. Margolis B. McGlade C.J. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 2272-2277Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar). Because the Glu-749 residue is specific forβ3 among all the integrinβ subunits, it may interact with some β3-specific partner to restrain αIIbβ3 activation. Based on the present study, screening of intracellular proteins competent to bind the wild-type but not E749S mutant β3 tail may be useful for detecting novel regulators of αIIbβ3 activation. It should be noted that the mutational effects of the membrane-proximal Ile-719 and the membrane-distal Glu-749 residues were additive and talin-dependent. This result suggests that the conformational changes in both the membrane-proximal and -distal regions play a cooperative role in talin function. Very recently, Wegener et al. (17Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) demonstrated the cooperative roles of the membrane-proximal and -distal regions in the process of talin-mediated αIIbβ3 activation. They proposed a model of talin-induced integrin activation in which interaction of talin with the membrane-distal region anchors talin to the β subunit tail tightly and subsequent interaction of talin with the membrane-proximal region induces separation or reorientation of the integrin tails, leading to integrin activation. Disruption of either interaction with the membrane-proximal or -distal region by β3 tail mutations resulted in failure of αIIbβ3 activation (17Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar). Our study showed that either Ile-719 or Glu-749 mutation induced talin-dependent αIIbβ3 activation, thus supporting this recent model of talin-induced integrin activation in terms of gain-of-function mutations. Wegener et al. (17Wegener K.L. Partridge A.W. Han J. Pickford A.R. Liddington R.C. Ginsberg M.H. Campbell I.D. Cell. 2007; 128: 171-182Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar) employed F2/F3 fragments of talin to activate αIIbβ3. In contrast, we observed the effects of the endogenous intact talin molecule on integrin activation. Therefore, our findings may indicate the β3 tail site critical for interaction with the intact talin molecule. Although we could not define the mechanism underlying the activating effects of the β3 tail mutations, identification of the β3 tail residues as regulators of talin-mediated αIIbβ3 activation will help to unravel the molecular basis for inside-out signaling of integrins.

https://openalex.org/W2048612890,"Alpha-dystroglycan has been proved to be involved in lymphocyte activation by participating in immunological synapse (IS) formation. Considering the existence of IS formation in thymic development, we questioned whether alpha-dystroglycan was expressed in thymus and influenced thymic development. In this study, we demonstrated that alpha-dystroglycan was expressed on fetal thymocytes, especially on double-positive (DP, CD4(+)CD8(+)) cells. Blocking alpha-dystroglycan by treatment of fetal thymus organ culture (FTOC) with anti-alpha-dystroglycan antibody IIH6C4 decreased the number of DP cells compared with nontreated or isotype antibody controls. Down-regulation of alpha-dystroglycan by retroviruses carrying antisense cDNA of dystroglycan in reaggregate thymus organ culture (RTOC) further confirmed these results. Enhanced apoptosis of DP cells was observed after blocking alpha-dystroglycan. Interestingly, we found that blocking alpha-dystroglycan reduced IS formation between DP cells and thymic epithelial cells. Furthermore, blocking alpha-dystroglycan up-regulated CD95/CD95L expression and reduced Bcl-2 expression on DP cells in the developing thymus. Finally, the increase in the apoptosis of DP cells was associated with a consequent decrease in the positive selection, as indicated by the reduction of both ERK phosphorylation in DP cells and single-positive (SP, CD4(+) or CD8(+)) cell outcome. Altogether, these results indicated that alpha-dystroglycan was involved in positive selection of thymocytes by participating in the IS formation."
