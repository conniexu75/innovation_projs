https://openalex.org/W1979755285,"In vertebrates, Notch signaling is generally thought to inhibit neural differentiation. However, whether Notch can also promote specific early cell fates in this context is unknown. We introduced activated Notch1 (NIC) into the mouse forebrain, before the onset of neurogenesis, using a retroviral vector and ultrasound imaging. During embryogenesis, NIC-infected cells became radial glia, the first specialized cell type evident in the forebrain. Thus, rather than simply inhibiting differentiation, Notch1 signaling promoted the acquisition of an early cellular phenotype. Postnatally, many NIC-infected cells became periventricular astrocytes, cells previously shown to be neural stem cells in the adult. These results suggest that Notch1 promotes radial glial identity during embryogenesis, and that radial glia may be lineally related to stem cells in the adult nervous system."
https://openalex.org/W2011341845,"We are interested in the mechanisms of glial cell development in the vertebrate central nervous system. We have identified genes that can direct the formation of glia in the retina. rax, a homeobox gene, Hes1, a basic helix-loop-helix gene, and notch1, a transmembrane receptor gene, are expressed in retinal progenitor cells, downregulated in differentiated neurons, and expressed in Müller glia. Retroviral transduction of any of these genes resulted in expression of glial markers. In contrast, misexpression of a dominant-negative Hes1 gene reduced the number of glia. Cotransfection of rax with reporter constructs containing the Hes1 or notch1 regulatory regions led to the upregulation of reporter transcription. These data suggest a regulatory heirarchy that controls the formation of glia at the expense of neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2041619316,"Here we report the description of the Drosophila gene futsch, which encodes a protein recognized by the monoclonal antibody 22C10 that has been widely used to visualize neuronal morphology and axonal projections. The Futsch protein is 5327 amino acids in length. It localizes to the microtubule compartment of the cell and associates with microtubules in vitro. The N- and C-terminal domains of Futsch are homologous to the vertebrate MAP1B microtubule-associated protein. The central domain of the Futsch protein is highly repetitive and shows sequence similarity to neurofilament proteins of which no Drosophila homologs have been reported. Loss-of-function analyses demonstrate that during embryogenesis Futsch is necessary for dendritic and axonal growth. Gain-of-function analyses demonstrate a functional interaction of Futsch with other MAPs. In addition, we show that during development, futsch expression is negatively regulated in nonneuronal tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2162970979,"Mammalian transient receptor potential channels (TRPCs) form a family of Ca2+-permeable cation channels currently consisting of seven members, TRPC1–TRPC7. These channels have been proposed to be molecular correlates for capacitative Ca2+ entry channels. There are only a few studies on the regulation and properties of the subfamily consisting of TRPC4 and TRPC5, and there are contradictory reports concerning the possible role of intracellular Ca2+ store depletion in channel activation. We therefore investigated the regulatory and biophysical properties of murine TRPC4 and TRPC5 (mTRPC4/5) heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. Activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors or receptor tyrosine kinases induced Mn2+ entry in fura-2-loaded mTRPC4/5-expressing cells. Accordingly, in whole-cell recordings, stimulation of Gq/11-coupled receptors evoked large, nonselective cation currents, an effect mimicked by infusion of guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate (GTPγS). However, depletion of intracellular Ca2+ stores failed to activate mTRPC4/5. In inside-out patches, single channels with conductances of 42 and 66 picosiemens at −60 mV for mTRPC4 and mTRPC5, respectively, were stimulated by GTPγS in a membrane-confined manner. Thus, mTRPC4 and mTRPC5 form nonselective cation channels that integrate signaling pathways from G-protein-coupled receptors and receptor tyrosine kinases independently of store depletion. Furthermore, the biophysical properties of mTRPC4/5 are inconsistent with those ofI CRAC, the most extensively characterized store-operated current."
https://openalex.org/W2046511552,"The formation, stabilization, and growth of synaptic connections are dynamic and highly regulated processes. The glutamatergic neuromuscular junction (NMJ) in Drosophila grows new boutons and branches throughout larval development. A primary walking behavior screen followed by a secondary anatomical screen led to the identification of the highwire (hiw) gene. In hiw mutants, the specificity of motor axon pathfinding and synapse formation appears normal. However, NMJ synapses grow exuberantly and are greatly expanded in both the number of boutons and the extent and length of branches. These synapses appear normal ultrastructurally but have reduced quantal content physiologically. hiw encodes a large protein found at presynaptic terminals. Within presynaptic terminals, HIW is localized to the periactive zone surrounding active zones; Fasciclin II (Fas II), which also controls synaptic growth, is found at the same location."
https://openalex.org/W2161168395,"cry (cryptochrome) is an important clock gene, and recent data indicate that it encodes a critical circadian photoreceptor in Drosophila. A mutant allele, cry(b), inhibits circadian photoresponses. Restricting CRY expression to specific fly tissues shows that CRY expression is needed in a cell-autonomous fashion for oscillators present in different locations. CRY overexpression in brain pacemaker cells increases behavioral photosensitivity, and this restricted CRY expression also rescues all circadian defects of cry(b) behavior. As wild-type pacemaker neurons express CRY, the results indicate that they make a striking contribution to all aspects of behavioral circadian rhythms and are directly light responsive. These brain neurons therefore contain an identified deep brain photoreceptor, as well as the other circadian elements: a central pace-maker and a behavioral output system."
https://openalex.org/W2019184486,"Neuregulins (NRGs) and their receptors, the ErbB protein tyrosine kinases, are essential for neuronal development, but their functions in the adult CNS are unknown. We report that ErbB4 is enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) and associates with PSD-95. Heterologous expression of PSD-95 enhanced NRG activation of ErbB4 and MAP kinase. Conversely, inhibiting expression of PSD-95 in neurons attenuated NRG-mediated activation of MAP kinase. PSD-95 formed a ternary complex with two molecules of ErbB4, suggesting that PSD-95 facilitates ErbB4 dimerization. Finally, NRG suppressed induction of long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 region without affecting basal synaptic transmission. Thus, NRG signaling may be synaptic and regulated by PSD-95. A role of NRG signaling in the adult CNS may be modulation of synaptic plasticity."
https://openalex.org/W2083689477,"We present evidence that Futsch, a novel protein with MAP1B homology, controls synaptic growth at the Drosophila neuromuscularjunction through the regulation of the synaptic microtubule cytoskeleton. Futsch colocalizes with microtubules and identifies cytoskeletal loops that traverse the lateral margin of select synaptic boutons. An apparent rearrangement of microtubule loop architecture occurs during bouton division, and a genetic analysis indicates that Futsch is necessary for this process. futsch mutations disrupt synaptic microtubule organization, reduce bouton number, and increase bouton size. These deficits can be partially rescued by neuronal overexpression of a futsch MAP1B homology domain. Finally, genetic manipulations that increase nerve-terminal branching correlate with increased synaptic microtubule loop formation, and both processes require normal Futsch function. These data suggest a common microtubule-based growth mechanism at the synapse and growth cone."
https://openalex.org/W2006441826,"Increased oxidative stress has been reported in vivo in the diabetic state via the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Such stress is bound to play a key role on activation of circulating monocytes, leading to the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in diabetics. However the exact molecular mechanisms of monocyte activation by high glucose is currently unclear. Here, we demonstrate that chronic high glucose (CHG) causes a dramatic increase in the release of the inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), at least in part through enhanced TNFα mRNA transcription, mediated by ROS via activation of transcription factors nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and activating protein-1 (AP-1). TNFα accumulation in the conditioned media was increased 10-fold and mRNA levels were increased 11.5-fold by CHG. The following observations supported that both NF-κB and AP-1 mediated enhanced TNFα transcription by CHG: 1) A 295-base pair fragment of the proximal TNFα promoter containing NF-κB and AP-1 sites reproduced the effects of CHG on TNFα transcription in a luciferase reporter assay, 2) mutational analyses of both NF-κB and the AP-1 sites abrogated 90% of the luciferase activity, 3) gel-shift analysis using the binding sites showed activation of NF-κB and AP-1 in CHG nuclear extracts, and 4) Western blot analyses demonstrated elevated nuclear levels of p65 and p50 and decreased cytosolic levels of IκBα in CHG-treated monocytes. That ROS acted as a key intermediate in the CHG pathway was supported by the following evidence: 1) increased superoxide levels similar to those observed with PMA or TNFα, 2) increased phosphorylation of stress-responsive mitogen-activated protein kinases p38 and JNK-1, 3) counteraction of the effects of CHG on TNFα production, the 295TNFluc reporter activity, activation of NF-κB, and repression of IκBα by antioxidants and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitors. The study suggests that ROS function as key components in the regulatory pathway progressing from elevated glucose to monocyte activation.

Hyperglycemia in the blood stream could generate free radicals and peroxide species by slow “autooxidation” of glucose, causing oxidative stress to circulating monocytes (4.Tesfamaraiam B. Cohen R.A.

Furthermore, glycosylation of low density lipoprotein increases its susceptibility to oxidation, generating byproducts in circulation that preferentially accumulate in foam cell-generating monocytes/macrophages (6.Brehm M.

As peripheral blood glucose levels increase in hyperglycemia, there is simultaneous rise in intracellular glucose levels, utilizing the sorbitol pathway and altering the redox balance inside the cells. Hyperglycemia also leads to increased NADH/NAD+ ratio, thereby decreasing the availability of NAD+ as a co-factor for other metabolic events (12.Ido Y. Kilo C. Williamson J.R.

Immunol. 1998; 161: 3569-3574PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and interleukin-6 by activated rat smooth muscle cells was regulated by the p38 MAPK pathway (22.Yamakawa T. Eguchi S. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa Y. Kotaro N. Miyata I. Reynolds C.M. Motley E.D. Inagami T. Endocrinology. 1999; 40: 3562-3573Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Activation of the p38 MAPK has been observed in a number of physiological responses such as apoptosis of myocardial cells (25.Ishii H. Koya D. King G.L. J. Mol.

Altered NADH/NAD+ ratio caused by hyperglycemia results in de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol and activation of various protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms in cell/tissue-type and stimulus-specific manner (7.Ceolotto G.

That hyperglycemia induced ROS may function as a key intermediate leading to the activation of PKC has been shown in many cell types of human and porcine origin (22.Yamakawa T. Eguchi S. Matsumoto T.

PKC-dependent and -independent activation of p38 MAPK pathway was observed in smooth muscle cells (19.Igarashi M. Wakasaki H. Takahara N. Ishii H. Jiang Z. Yamauchi T. Kuboki K. Meier M. Rhodes C.J.

The inflammatory cytokine human tumor necrosis factor α (hTNFα) is produced by activated monocytes in response to a variety of signals including stress response, phorbol esters, cytokines, endotoxin, and substrate adherence (27.Joviage S.

TNFα gene expression is regulated both at the levels of transcription and post-transcription. Elevated levels of TNFα and other inflammatory cytokines have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques of diabetic and nondiabetic patients (32.Desfaits A.C. Serri O. Reiner G. Diabetes Care. 1998; 21: 487-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). The role of monocytes in increased foam cell formation in diabetic patients is well established (25.Ishii H. Koya D. King G.L. J. Mol. Med. 1998; 76: 21-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Hyperglycemia-induced oxidative stress, further accentuated by the inactivation of superoxide dismutase (12.Ido Y. Kilo C. Williamson J.R. Diabetologia. 1997; 40: 115-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar), along with soluble AGEs and products of lipid peroxidation possibly serve as key activators of circulating monocytes via the activation of upstream kinases, leading to induction of inflammatory gene expression. However the signaling kinases or transcription factors specifically involved in high glucose-induced monocyte activation leading to the production of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα are still unclear and are the focus of the present study. Activation of genes in response to inflammatory stimuli has been shown to involve coordinated participation of transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1. Regulation of many inflammatory cyokines, tissue factor, and matrix metalloproteinases involve dual transcriptional regulation by NF-κB and AP-1 (33.Yasumoto K. Okamoto S. Mukaida N. Murakami S.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar). NF-κB/Rel proteins are heterodimeric transcription factors retained in the cytoplasm of unstimulated cells by the inhibitory subunit IκB, the NF-κB/IκB forming an inactive ternary complex (37.Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Stimulation with stress-inducing agents or other proinflammatory mediators causes rapid phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of IκB-subunit, allowing translocation of NF-κB to the nucleus (37.Ghosh S. Baltimore D. Nature. 1990; 344: 678-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). NF-κB then induces transcription of several genes, including that of its inhibitor IκB (38.Karin M. Delhase M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9067-9069Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Another transcription factor regulated by cellular stress is AP-1, a transacting molecule consisting mainly of homodimers of Jun or heterodimers of Fos and Jun (39.Leitman D.C. Ribeiro R.C.J. Mackow E.R. Baxter J.D. West B.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9343-9346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The hTNFα gene has in its promoter region canonical binding sites for transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 (40.Aepfelbacher M. Essler M. Huber E. Czech A. Weber P.C. J. Immunol. 1996; 157: 5070-5075PubMed Google Scholar). Since the exact mechanism for the activation of monocytes leading to inflammatory cytokine production by hyperglycemia is currently unclear, we evaluated some of the key molecular and cellular events leading to TNFα secretion by high glucose. Our study suggests that CHG-induced monocyte activation, as evidenced by increased TNFα expression, was regulated at least in part through increased TNFα mRNA transcription. The process involved ROS-dependent and -independent pathways, requiring coordinate activation of both p38 MAPK and PKC as upstream kinases and NF-κB and AP-1 as downstream transcription factors. U937 (monoblastoid) cells and THP-1 (histiocytic) cells were obtained from ATCC and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 7% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, β-mercaptoethanol (50 μm), HEPES (10 mm), glutamine (2 mm), streptomycin (50 μg/ml), penicillin (50 units/ml), and 5.5 mm glucose (NG). For chronic high glucose (CHG) conditions, cells were cultured in 12.5, 15,or 25 mm glucose for 2 days before being depleted of serum and treated with various agents as indicated under “Results.” High glucose (HG) culturing was done in 15 mm glucose for 18 h. This HG condition was used to culture peripheral human monocytes for TNFα production and for 295TNFluc luciferase activity studies. CHG- or HG-treated cells were washed and resuspended in depletion medium containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 18 h or for other periods as indicated prior to stimulation. Fresh human monocytes were obtained from healthy donors using an approved Institutional Review Board protocol and isolated as described previously (41.Li Y. Zhu H. Kuppusamy P. Roubaud V. Zweier J.L. Trush M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 2015-2023Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Autologous serum was used for the attachment purification and culture of the monocytes. This assay was performed as described earlier (6.Brehm M. Schiller E. Zeller W.J. Toxicol. Lett. (Shannon). 1996; 87: 131-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) to measure superoxide anion (O2−). Briefly, U937 or THP-1 cells were cultured in NG versus CHG, depleted of serum using depletion media, and prepared for the assay. Cells were treated with TNFα (5 ng/ml) or PMA (10 ng/ml; positive control) for 60 min, washed in a balanced salt solution, and resuspended at 2 × 106 cells/ml in aerated balanced salt solution. 1 × 106 cells/ml was used for the assay. O2− was measured in intact cells by LCA. Cells from various treatments were added to a scintillation vial containing lucigenin (500 μm) in the aerated balanced salt solution. Photon emission was measured for 10 min using the Beckman LS6500 Multipurpose Scintillation counter measuring single photon emission. First, photon emission was measured using a buffer blank and dark-adapted lucigenin, and the blank reading was subtracted from the sample reading. A standard curve was generated using xanthine and xanthine oxidase. Superoxide dismutase (100 units/ml) was used as an inhibitor for superoxide production. H2O2was added to the buffer blanks or to the NG control cells to determine if the photon emission in the lucigenin assay was induced by O2− or peroxide species. N-Acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC; 100 μm) was purchased from Calbiochem. It was dissolved in phosphate-buffered saline, and the pH was adjusted to 7.2. Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC; Sigma; 50–100 μm) was dissolved in water. Me2SO was used to resuspend the rest of the inhibitors and was added to the control plates. p38 MAPK inhibitor SB202190 (SB, 10 μm) was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology. Mannitol, 3-O-methyl glucose, and 2-deoxyglucose were purchased from Sigma. U937 or THP-1 cells were cultured in NG or CHG, depleted of serum in depletion media, and cultured in NG, CHG, or NG + PMA for another 24 h. Quantitative detection of hTNFα in conditioned media was performed using a specific antibody sandwich CytoscreenTMenzyme-linked immunosorbent assay assay fromBIOSOURCE International using the manufacturer's suggested directions. Known concentrations of hTNFα were used to generate the standard curves. Supernatant from NG-cultured cells treated with PMA (10 ng/ml) for 24 h served as the positive control. Streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase served as the detection system. For each experiment, duplicate samples were measured. Data were represented as the mean (pg/106 cells) ± S.E. The assay was linear between 15.6 pg/ml and 1000 pg/ml. TNFα message was measured in U937 cells using the Quantitative RT-PCR Cytoexpress detection kit fromBIOSOURCE International. Cells were cultured and depleted as in the preceding paragraph above, and RNA was extracted from CHG or NG cells stimulated for 4 h with various concentrations of TNFα (0.25, 0.5, 1, or 5 ng/ml) or PMA (10 or 50 ng/ml). RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. A known copy number of exogenously synthesized DNA, known as the internal control standard (ICS) was mixed with sample cDNA before PCR amplification. The ICS contained PCR primer binding sites similar to the TNFα cDNA and a unique capture-binding site to distinguish the ICS amplicon from the TNFα amplicon. In samples containing ICS, two amplicon bands were visible following PCR amplification, the 382-base pair TNFα band and the 432-base pair ICS band. After amplification, the amplicons were hybridized to the ICS or TNFα-specific oligonucleotide-coated wells. Biotinylation of an original primer allowed streptavidin coupled to biotin to be used as the detection system. The signal generated in the hybridization reaction was proportional to the number of amplicons present in the starting cDNA. Since the ICS (known copy number) was amplified at the same frequency as the TNFα cDNA, it served to determine the copy number of TNFα cDNA in each sample (see Equation 1). Copy number of TNFα message=2×known ICS copy number×A in TNFα wellsA in ICS wellsEquation 1 The 295TNFα luciferase (295TNFluc) deletion construct from the human TNFα promoter was a kind gift from Dr. James S. Economou, UCLA (44.Patel N.A. Chalfant C.E. Yamamoto M. Watson J.E. Eichler D.C. Cooper D.R. FASEB J. 1999; 13: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 U937 or THP-1 cells were depleted of serum 2 h before transfection. The cells were transfected with 2 μg of the 295TNFluc deletion construct and co-transfected with 0.2 μg of reporter plasmid (RSVβGal) using the Effectene reagent (Qiagen Inc.) in 2% serum-containing media overnight. The cells were washed and depleted of serum for 4 h before stimulation with glucose (NGversus HG) and/or TNFα for 18 h. Alternatively, cells were cultured in NG or CHG for 24 h, washed, depleted for 4 h, and transfected with 295TNFluc plasmid overnight. On day 3, cells were washed, depleted of serum, and stimulated with NG or CHG plus/minus TNFα for 18 h, and stimulated luciferase activity was measured. Treatment with PMA served as the positive control for the stimulated luciferase activity. Inhibitors were added at the indicated concentrations 1 h before CHG culturing or before treatment with TNFα or PMA. The inhibitors were present throughout the culturing and the stimulation phase. The luciferase assay was performed using the firefly luciferase kit (Promega) using a Turner TD-20e luminometer measuring light intensity over a 5-log range. Results from the luciferase assay were normalized to β-galactosidase levels, and relative luciferase units were determined. The results were reported as fold stimulation over XP-1 control plasmids. Concentrations of inhibitors used for the study are listed under “Inhibitors and Reagents” of this section. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed at the NF-κB3 and the AP-1 sites using the Quick-changeTM site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene using the manufacturer's suggested directions. The NF-κB3 (GGGTTTCTCC) and AP-1 (TGAATGA) sequences were mutated to taGTTTCTCC (mNF-κB3) and gtAATGA (mAP-1), respectively, using primers as suggested in published protocols (47.Kuprash D.V. Udalova I.A. Turetskaya R.L. Kwaiatkowski D.K. Rice N.R. Nedospasov S.A. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 4045-4052PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in NG or CHG, depleted of serum in depletion media, and treated with TNFα or preincubated with the inhibitors at concentrations for the time indicated under “Results.” Nuclear and cytosolic extracts were made by a modification of the protocol of Linet al. (42.Lin T.H. Rosales C. Mondal K. Bolen J.B. Haskill S. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16189-16197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The cytosolic extracts (Western blot analysis) and nuclear extracts (gel-shift assay and Western blot analysis) were divided into aliquot and frozen at −70 °C for future use. The concentrations of inhibitors used for the study are listed above. Oligonucleotide probes for EMSA were synthesized in the City of Hope National Medical Center DNA synthesis facility. The proximal NF-κB (NF-κB3) and AP-1 sites from the TNFα promoter were used for the EMSA. The sequence for the NF-κB3 site was: GCTCATGGGTTTCTCCACCAAG. The sequence for the AP-1 site was: CCAGATGAGCTCATGGG. EMSA was performed according to published protocol (43.Economou J.S. Rhoades K. Essner R. McBride W.H. Gasson J.C. Morton D.L. J. Exp. Med. 1989; 170: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The probes were labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 kinase (Stratagene). Antibodies used for supershifting experiments, anti-p50 (NLS), anti-p65 (c-20), anti-C rel, anti-Rel B (C-19), and anti-p52 (K-27), were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The gels were dried and visualized using a PhosphorImager screen (Molecular Dynamics, San Jose, CA) and quantified using the Imagequant software (NIH, Bethesda, MD). Nuclear extracts (5 μg) were mixed with equal volume of 2× sample buffer (4% SDS, 10% glycerol, 0.006% bromphenol blue, and 2% β-mercaptoethanol), boiled for 5 min, and run on SDS-polyacrylamide reducing gel (20.Natarajan R. Scott S. Bai W. Yerini K.K.V. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 378-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Antibodies for Western analyses were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Western blot analysis was done using anti-p50, anti-p65, anti-IκBα, anti-IκBβ, and anti-Iκbε antibodies at a dilution of 1:1000. Anti-histone H1 (C-17), used at 1:10000 dilution, served as the loading control for nuclear extracts. Cytosolic extracts were treated the same way as the nuclear extracts, and Western blot analysis was done using anti-IκBα and anti-IκBε antibodies. Anti α-actin antibody (1:20000 dilution), purchased from Sigma, served as the loading control for the cytosolic extracts. Phosphorylated ERK 1/2, JNK-1, and p38 were detected by Western blot analysis using phosphorylated ERK 1/2 (pERK), JNK (pJNK), and p38 (pp38) mitogen-activated protein kinase antibodies purchased from New England Biolabs. Nonphosphorylated ERK 1/2, JNK-1, and p38 served as the loading controls. For these experiments, cells lysates were made using lysis buffer described earlier (20.Natarajan R. Scott S. Bai W. Yerini K.K.V. Nadler J. Hypertension. 1999; 33: 378-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All Western blots were developed using the ECL detection system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), following the protocol suggested by the manufacturer. Anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary antibody served as the detecting antibody. Stripping and reprobing of the membranes for Western blot analysis was performed according to stringent conditions suggested in the ECL handbook. Western blots were quantified with the Alpha Imager documentation and analysis system using the Alpha Imager 3.24 software. Results are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of the average responses in multiple experiments. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance followed by Tukey's test or by Student's t tests for paired components. To investigate whether CHG increased ROS in monocytic cell lines (U937 and THP-1), we examined the effect of CHG culturing alone on superoxide (O2−) production. CHG increased O2− levels significantly (p < 0.005) over NG-cultured U937 cells (2.3 ± 0.87-fold; Fig. 1 A). O2− levels generated by CHG were comparable with that observed in NG cells following treatment with the inflammatory cytokine TNFα or phorbol ester PMA (positive control) for 1 h. Treatment of cells with superoxide dismutase before measuring O2− levels by LCA quenched any detectable O2− produced in CHG-, TNFα-, or PMA-treated cells. Adding H2O2 to NG cells did not increase chemiluminescence counts, indicating that O2− but not peroxide was the contributor for the photon emission. THP-1 cells generated similar trends but had higher levels of O2−than U937 cells. An important measure of oxidative stress is the activation of upstream stress-responsive MAPKs. We therefore examined the effects of CHG on phosphorylation of p38 (pp38), JNK-1 (pJNK-1), and ERK 1/2 MAPKs using Western blot analysis. Fig.1 B, top panel 1, shows a representative immunoblot probed with antibodies to pp38. In themiddle panel, the same blot was stripped and re-probed with pJNK-1 antibody, and in the bottom panel, the blot was stripped further and probed with nonphosphorylated p38 antibody serving as loading control. THP-1 cells cultured in CHG showed a striking increase in basal levels of pp38 (Fig. 1 C, 2.6-fold) and pJNK-1 (Fig. 1 D, 2.3-fold) over NG controls. Treatment of cells with TNFα for 5 or 10 min (Fig. 1 C) showed a stronger increase in pp38 levels in NG (2.1-fold) compared with CHG (0.6-fold). On the contrary, the pJNK-1 levels (Fig. 1 D) following TNFα treatment showed a much stronger and faster increase (2.5-fold) in CHG compared with NG (1.7-fold). The activation profile of the two stress-responsive kinases in CHG showed positive correlation with O2− data. TNFα-induced elevated pp38 and pJNK-1 levels in CHG were additive. In contrast, the third member of the MAPK family, ERK 1/2, which generally is responsive to stress and mitogenic stimuli, showed no activation by either high glucose or TNFα in these monocytic cells. CHG or TNFα showed similar trends in U937 c"

Growth and survival factors inhibit the death-promoting activity of BAD by stimulating phosphorylation at multiple sites including Ser-112 and Ser-136. Phosphorylation at these sites promotes binding of BAD to 14-3-3 proteins, sequestering BAD away from the mitochondrial membrane where it dimerizes with Bcl-XL to exert its killing effects. We report here that the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-155 within the BH3 domain is a second phosphorylation-dependent mechanism that inhibits the death-promoting activity of BAD. Protein kinase A, RSK1, and survival factor signaling stimulate phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-155, blocking the binding of BAD to Bcl-XL.

Survival factors such as interleukin-3 activate a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-dependent pathway involving the activation of Akt followed by the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-136 (4del Peso L.

Membrane-based PKA has been identified as a BAD kinase that phosphorylates BAD at Ser-112 (12Harada H. Becknell B. Wilm M. Mann M. Huang L.J. Taylor S.S. Scott J.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. 1999; 3: 413-422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). Calcineurin, a calcium-dependent phosphatase, promotes apoptosis by dephosphorylating BAD at both Ser-112 and Ser-136 (13Wang H.-G. Pathan N. Ethell I.M. Krajewski S. Yamaguchi Y. Shibasaki F.

Phosphorylation at Ser-112 and Ser-136 creates binding sites for the phospho-specific binding of 14-3-3 proteins, which retain BAD in the cytoplasm and prevent cytotoxic interactions with Bcl-XL at the mitochondrial membrane (2Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar, 5Datta S.R. Dudek H. Tao X. Masters S. Fu H. Gotoh Y.

Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Although the precise mechanism these molecules use to induce cell death is still unknown, deletion analysis of BAD has demonstrated the importance of the BH3 domain in mediating both its heterodimerization with Bcl-XL and its death-promoting activity (14Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24101-24104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar). Site-specific mutagenesis of the closely related BH3 domain of BAX has revealed the importance of the hydrophobic surface of the BH3 α-helical face for dimerization and cell death activity (15Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). BAX is thought to interact with Bcl-XL at the mitochondrial membrane by fitting into an α-helical groove. The binding of Bcl-XL by the BH3 domain may cause Bcl-XL to release Apaf1 or regulate other Bcl-XL activities resulting in a caspase 9-initiated cascade of proteolysis and induction of apoptosis (16Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3268) Google Scholar, 17Martin S.J. Green D.R. Cell. 1995; 82: 349-352Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1263) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that BAD can be phosphorylated at Ser-155, which is located within the middle of the hydrophobic amphipathic face of the BH3 α helix. Phosphorylation at Ser-155, similar to phosphorylation at Ser-112 and Ser-136, inhibits BAD-induced death-promoting activity but does so in a different manner. Phosphorylation at Ser-155 does not induce 14-3-3 binding and cytoplasmic sequestration but instead directly blocks BH3-dependent dimerization with Bcl-XL. Forskolin, 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), TPA, isoproterenol, fetal calf serum, and mammalian cell culture medium were obtained from Sigma. Epidermal growth factor and insulin-like growth factor I were from Life Technologies, Inc. Phosphorylation state-specific anti-BAD(Ser-155) antibody, control anti-BAD antibodies, and the chemiluminescent Western detection kit were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology. Bcl-XL-specific antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz. RSK1-specific monoclonal antibody was from Transduction Laboratories. Protein kinase A, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, casein kinase I, casein kinase II, and ERK2 were purchased from New England Biolabs. Protein kinase C was purchased from Calbiochem, and the X-gal staining kit was from Invitrogen. The QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was obtained from Stratagene, and the FuGENE 6 transfection reagent was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. The GST·BAD mammalian expression vector was constructed by fusion of the complete coding sequence of BAD that has been amplified from a mouse brain cDNA library (CLONTECH) and cloned into theBamHI/NotI sites of the eukaryotic expression vector pEBG. pEBG expresses an amino-terminal GST fusion of the cloned gene under the control of the strong constitutively active human EF-1α promoter (18Mizushima S. Nagata S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 5322Crossref PubMed Scopus (1499) Google Scholar). GST·BAD S112A/S136A mammalian expression vectors were constructed as described previously (7Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). GST·BAD S155A and S155E mammalian expression vectors were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. pMT2·RSK1 was provided by Joseph Avruch and pMT2·RSK2 and RSK3 were provided by Christian Bjorbaek. The pEAK 10·Bcl-XL vector was constructed by fusion of the complete coding sequence of Bcl-XL amplified from pCMV·Bcl-XL (provided by Stanley Korsmeyer) and cloned into the EcoRI/NotI site of the pEAK10 vector. MBP·Bcl-XL vector was constructed by fusion of the complete coding sequence of Bcl-XL into the EcoRI/NotI of pMalC2 vector. The anti-phospho-BAD(Ser-155) antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with synthetic phosphopeptides covalently coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. The presence of phospho-specific immunoreactivity was detected by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using both phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides. After purification of IgG using protein A-agarose, phosphopeptide-specific antibodies were purified by first passing the antibodies over immobilized nonphosphorylated peptide to remove antibodies that are reactive to nonphosphorylated epitopes. The nonabsorbed fraction was then passed over a column of immobilized phosphopeptide. After extensive washing, the retained immunoglobulins were eluted at low pH, rapidly neutralized, dialyzed, and concentrated. 2 μg of GST·BAD protein were incubated with different kinases in 50 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mmNa3VO4, 10 mmMgCl2) and 200 μm ATP for 30 min at 30 °C. Kinase reactions were terminated with SDS sample buffer, and BAD phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting. HEK293 cells were maintained in modified minimum Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% (v/v) horse serum. Transient transfection of HEK293 cells was performed as described previously (19Tan Y. Rouse J. Zhang A. Cariati S. Cohen P. Comb M.J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4629-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (568) Google Scholar) with 2 μg of GST·BAD, GST·BAD S112A/S136A, or GST·BAD S155A and 10 μg of the catalytic subunit of PKA or 10 μg of pMT2·RSK1, RSK2, or RSK3 in 10-cm2 plates. The total amount of transfected DNA was maintained at 20 μg with pEGB. Following calcium phosphate transfections, cells were glycerol-shocked and incubated for 24 h in medium containing 10% horse serum and for 18 h without serum. Cells were treated with regulators for the indicated times. For the survival assay, HEK293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of Rous sarcoma virus β-galactosidase, 1 μg of GST·BAD or BAD mutants, and 0.5 μg of pMT2·RSK1 using FuGENE 6 transfection reagent. 24 h after transfection, cells were grown in medium without serum for 18 h and then fixed for X-gal staining. Cell extracts were prepared by lysing 5 × 105 cells in 100 μl of SDS sample buffer (2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 80 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 0.15 m2-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue). Extracts from 105 cells (20 μl) were fractionated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Blots were blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in TBST (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4 °C, incubated with goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase for 1 h at room temperature, and visualized using the chemiluminescent Western detection kit. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding pEAK10·Bcl-XL, wild-type GST·BAD, or GST·BAD containing S155A or S155E mutants as indicated. After 24 h, the cells were deprived of serum and 18 h later were harvested in cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Cell extracts were incubated with Bcl-XL polyclonal antibody overnight at 4 °C and protein A-conjugated beads for 2 h. Beads were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer for Western analysis. MBP·14-3-3 or MBP·Bcl-XL proteins bound to maltose beads were mixed with extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type BAD, BAD mutants, or pMT2-RSK1; treated with or without TPA; and lysed in cell lysis buffer. Cell extracts were incubated overnight at 4 °C, beads were washed twice with cell lysis buffer and twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer for Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 1, Ser-155 lies within the BH3 region of BAD (asterisk). Ser-155 is embedded in a canonical protein kinase A motif (RRXS) suggesting that this residue may be phosphorylated by basic directed protein kinases. To test the idea that phosphorylation at this residue might alter the proapoptotic function of the BAD BH3 domain, we generated a phosphorylation state-specific antibody (20Czernik A.J. Girault J.-A. Nairn A.C. Chen J. Snyder G. Kebabian J. Greengard P. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 201B: 264-283Crossref Scopus (112) Google Scholar) directed against Ser-155 of BAD as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The antibody was shown to be highly specific for the phosphorylated epitope by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (data not shown) and by Western blotting using phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated GST·BAD proteins (Fig. 2 A). We used this antibody to examine the ability of several different protein kinases to phosphorylate BAD at Ser-155 in vitro with a GST·BAD fusion protein as substrate. As demonstrated in Fig.2 A, of the protein kinases tested, only protein kinase A was able to phosphorylate BAD at Ser-155. This observation led us to test whether in vivo activation of protein kinase A using forskolin would stimulate phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-155. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding wild-type GST·BAD or GST·BAD S112A/S136A or S155A mutants. Cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted using phospho-specific antibodies directed against BAD Ser-155 and BAD Ser-112 as well as phosphorylation state-independent anti-BAD antibodies (Fig. 2 B). Forskolin increased the phosphorylation of GST·BAD at both Ser-155 and Ser-112. The site specificity of the anti-phospho-BAD(Ser-155) and -BAD(Ser-112) antibodies was analyzed using the mutant BAD proteins. As expected, mutation of either Ser-155 or Ser-112 to alanine eliminated immunoreactivity with the corresponding phospho-specific antibody. Although the S136A/S112A double mutant is unable to bind 14-3-3 (2Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar), it was phosphorylated at Ser-155 in response to forskolin, indicating that Ser-155 can be phosphorylated in the absence of phosphorylation at Ser-112 and Ser-136. As shown in Fig. 2 C, forskolin induced a rapid and sustained phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-155. Transfection of HEK293 cells with the catalytic subunit of protein kinase A also increased the phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-155 (Fig. 2 D).Figure 2PKA phosphorylates BAD at Ser-155 in vitro and in vivo. A, GST·BAD was phosphorylated using the indicated kinases and immunoblotted using anti-phospho-BAD(Ser-155) (P-Bad(S155)) antibody. CKI, casein kinase I; PKC, protein kinase C; CaMKII, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. B,forskolin stimulated BAD Ser-155 phosphorylation. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GST·BAD (Wt) or S112A/S136A (S112/136A) or S155A mutants as indicated. After 24 h, the cells were deprived of serum and 18 h later were treated with 30 μm forskolin and 0.5 mm IBMX for 30 min prior to harvest as indicated.

HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GST·BAD and the catalytic subunit of PKA (pMTCneo) as described above. Total cell extracts were prepared, and immunoblotting was carried out using anti-phospho-BAD(Ser-155) antibody (top) or anti-BAD antibody (bottom).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We also explored other agents that might stimulate phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-155. Treatment with TPA, isoproterenol, forskolin, or insulin-like growth factor produced the largest increase in phosphorylation at Ser-155 (Fig.3 A). TPA rapidly induced a sustained phosphorylation of BAD that was evident within 5 min of treatment and remained elevated 8 h after treatment (Fig.3 B). Because TPA activates RSK1 in these cells (7Tan Y. Ruan H. Demeter M.R. Comb M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34859-34867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), we next tested whether RSK1 phosphorylates BAD at Ser-155. RSK1 was immunoprecipitated from mock or TPA-treated HEK293 cells using a RSK1-specific monoclonal antibody. Immunocomplex kinase assays were performed using wild-type and mutant GST·BAD fusion proteins as substrates, and BAD phosphorylation was detected by immunoblotting using anti-phospho-BAD(Ser-155) antibody (Fig.4 A). Immunoprecipitated RSK1 phosphorylated BAD at Ser-155, and this activity was increased after treatment with TPA. To examine whether RSK1 might also phosphorylate BAD at Ser-155 in vivo, HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding RSK1 and GST·BAD. Overexpression of RSK1 induced BAD phosphorylation at Ser-155 in the absence of TPA treatment, and Ser-155 phosphorylation was further stimulated by TPA in cells transfected with RSK1 (Fig. 4 B). Overexpression of two closely related RSK isoforms, RSK2 and RSK3, also resulted in robust simulation of BAD phosphorylation at Ser-155 (Fig. 4 C). TPA and RSK1 both stimulate phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-112, binding of 14-3-3, and cytosolic sequestration (2Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J.

After 24 h, cells were deprived of serum and 18 h later were treated with TPA (200 nm) for 30 min as indicated prior to harvest.

Wild-type BAD, BAD S155A, and BAD S155E expressed from bacteria were phosphorylated in vitro with the catalytic subunit of PKA, and its ability to bind to Bcl-XL was measured by retention on immobilized MBP·Bcl-XL maltose beads. As shown in Fig. 5 A, PKA treatment strongly inhibited binding of wild-type BAD to Bcl-XL but had no effect on the binding of BAD S155A to Bcl-XL. Consistent with the inhibitory effect of phosphorylation at Ser-155, we also observed that BAD S155E blocked binding to Bcl-XL both in vitro (Fig.5 A) and in vivo (Fig. 5 B). As shown in Fig. 5 B, significant levels of wt BAD and BAD S155A were coimmunoprecipitated with Bcl-XL whereas BAD S155E was not. We also examined BAD·Bcl-XL complex formation using immobilized Bcl-XL to “pull down” BAD from extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transfected with BAD wt, S155A, or S155E. As shown in Fig.5 C, BAD wt and S155A were retained on the Bcl-XL beads whereas BAD S155E was not. Together, these results suggest that phosphorylation of Ser-155 or mutation of Ser-155 to glutamic acid blocks binding of BAD to Bcl-XL. As shown in Fig. 6, BAD wt and BAD S155A were potent cell death stimulators. In HEK293 cells 24 h after transfection with BAD or BAD S155A, there was approximately 25% survival of transfected cells. Cotransfection of BAD together with RSK1 can largely reverse BAD-mediated cell death. BAD S155A or BAD S112A/S136A increased cytotoxicity and impaired RSK-mediated survival whereas BAD S155E significantly reduced cell death when compared with wt or S155A-mutated BAD. Mutation of all three phosphorylation sites renders the triple mutant S112A/S136A/S155A even more cytotoxic with no significant rescue afforded by RSK1. Our results indicate that survival signals act in at least two ways to inhibit the cell-killing activity of BAD, first by phosphorylating BAD at Ser-112 and Ser-136 to stimulate binding of 14-3-3 proteins and sequestering BAD from the mitochondrial membrane (2Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2257) Google Scholar) and second by phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-155, which directly inhibits BH3 function and interaction with Bcl-XL. Phosphorylation of BAD at Ser-155 is predicted to introduce a charged phosphate directly between the BH3 hydrophobic face and the Bcl-XL hydrophobic pocket (14Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J.

This is consistent with the effects of BAD Ser-155 mutations as well as previous studies involving mutagenesis of BAD and BAX BH3 domains (14Zha J. Harada H. Osipov K. Jockel J. Waksman G.

The BH3 motif surrounding Ser-155 is most similar to BAX where detailed mutagenesis has shown the importance of Gly-67 (the BAD Ser-155 corresponding residue) in mediating BAX heterodimerization (15Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). As observed here for BAD S155E, BAX G67E blocked heterodimerization and profoundly reduced BAX death-promoting activity whereas G67A had little effect (15Wang K. Gross A. Waksman G. Korsmeyer S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6083-6089Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of another BH3 domain only protein, BID (22Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T.

Our work demonstrates that RSK phosphorylates BAD at both Ser-112 and Ser-155 and rescues BAD-mediated cell death in a manner dependent upon phosphorylation at both sites. Additional work is needed to determine whether Ser-155 phosphorylation serves a fail-safe function to reduce inappropriate triggering of cell death or is alone sufficient to neutralize BAD-induced death-promoting activity.

https://openalex.org/W1997814123,"We tested the contribution of the small GTPase Rho and its downstream target p160ROCK during the early stages of axon formation in cultured cerebellar granule neurons. p160ROCK inhibition, presumably by reducing the stability of the cortical actin network, triggered immediate outgrowth of membrane ruffles and filopodia, followed by the generation of initial growth cone-ike membrane domains from which axonal processes arose. Furthermore, a potentiation in both the size and the motility of growth cones was evident, though the overall axon elongation rate remained stable. Conversely, overexpression of dominant active forms of Rho or ROCK was suggested to prevent initiation of axon outgrowth. Taken together, our data indicate a novel role for the Rho/ROCK pathway as a gate critical for the initiation of axon outgrowth and the control of growth cone dynamics."

This survival protein has the BCL-2 homology (BH) domains 1, 2, and 3 and a C-terminal transmembrane region. We identified a short splicing variant of the MCL-1mRNA in the human placenta encoding a protein, termed MCL-1 short (MCL-1S), with an altered C terminus as compared with the full-length MCL-1 long (MCL-1L), leading to the loss of BH1, BH2, and the transmembrane domains. Analysis of the human MCL-1 gene indicated that MCL-1S results from the splicing out of exon 2 during mRNA processing. MCL-1S, unlike MCL-1L, does not interact with diverse proapoptotic BCL-2-related proteins in the yeast two-hybrid system. In contrast, MCL-1S dimerizes with MCL-1L in the yeast assay and coprecipitates with MCL-1L in transfected mammalian cells. Overexpression of MCL-1S induces apoptosis in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells, and the MCL-1S action was antagonized by the antiapoptotic MCL-1L. Thus, the naturally occurring MCL-1S variant represents a new proapoptotic BH3 domain-only protein capable of dimerizing with the antiapoptotic MCL-1L.

Science. 1995; 267: 1456-1462Crossref PubMed Scopus (6194) Google Scholar). It is becoming clear that BCL-2 proteins play a pivotal role in the intracellular mechanisms of apoptosis regulation. The bcl-2 gene was first isolated as a proto-oncogene at the breakpoint of a t(14,18) chromosomal translocation associated with follicular B-cell lymphoma (2Tsujimoto Y. Finger L.R. Yunis J. Nowell P.C. Croce C.M. Science. 1984; 226: 1097-1099Crossref PubMed Scopus (1488) Google Scholar, 3Cleary M.L. Smith S.D. Sklar J. Cell. 1986; 47: 19-28Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1078) Google Scholar). This protein is localized to the mitochondria, perinuclear membrane, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (4Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Takayama S. Schibler M.J. Fenton W. Reed J.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 4701-4714PubMed Google Scholar, 5Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar). When overexpressed, the BCL-2 protein suppresses apoptosis induced by a variety of agents bothin vivo and in vitro (6Tsujimoto Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1958-1962Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 7Vaux D.L. Cory S. Adams J.M. Nature. 1988; 335: 440-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (2730) Google Scholar). By using homologous gene isolation, protein-protein interaction screening, and subtraction cloning, an expanding family of BCL-2-related proteins has been identified in organisms from viruses to mammals (8Reed J.C. Zha H. Aime-Sempe C. Takayama S. Wang H.G. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1996; 406: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4813) Google Scholar). The members of the BCL-2 family can be subdivided into antiapoptotic proteins such as BCL-2, BCL-xL, and BCL-w and proapoptotic proteins such as BAX, BOD, BOK, and BAD. It has been proposed that anti- and proapoptotic BCL-2 proteins regulate cell death by binding to each other and forming heterodimers (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar, 11Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). A delicate balance between anti- and proapoptotic BCL-2 family members exists in each cell, and the relative concentration of these two groups of proteins determines whether the cell survives or undergoes apoptosis. MCL-1 was first discovered as an early induction gene during the differentiation of a human myeloid leukemia cell line (12Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3516-3520Crossref PubMed Scopus (880) Google Scholar). Although the MCL-11 protein possesses the BCL-2 homology (BH)1, BH2, BH3, and transmembrane (TM) domains found in other BCL-2-related proteins, it is distinguished by a unique PEST sequence in its N-terminal region. Subsequent studies established MCL-1 as an antiapoptotic BCL-2 family protein with an expression pattern differing from that of BCL-2 and capable of suppressing cell death induced by various stimuli including growth factor deprivation and exposure to chemotherapeutic agents or UV irradiation (13Yang T. Kozopas K.M. Craig R.W. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 1173-1184Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 14Zhou P. Qian L. Bieszczad C.K. Noelle R. Binder M. Levy N.B. Craig R.W. Blood. 1998; 92: 3226-3239Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to having evolved into a family of homologous proteins with distinct functions, some of the bcl-2-related genes encode different isoforms that vary in subcellular localization, function, and levels of expression (15Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For example, both the bcl-2 andbax genes encode a dominant form containing a TM domain and a short splicing variant lacking this region (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar, 16Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The BCL-2 variant, without the TM domain, appears to have either decreased or no antiapoptotic activity and a different subcellular localization (5Hockenbery D. Nunez G. Milliman C. Schreiber R.D. Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 334-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3540) Google Scholar,17Tanaka S. Saito K. Reed J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 10920-10926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, multiple splicing variants for the bcl-xgene have been identified, and the BCL-xS variant lacks the BH1 and BH2 domains but retains the TM region. Although it does not possess proapoptotic activity in the absence of an antiapoptotic signal, BCL-xS antagonizes the survival action of BCL-xL when BCL-xS is stably transfected (18Boise L.H.

When expressed at high levels using a BCL-xS adenovirus system, apoptosis was selectively induced in cancerous but not normal bone marrow cells (20Clarke M.F. Apel I.J. Benedict M.A. Eipers P.G.

Here, we identified a novel apoptosis-regulatory mechanism in which the alternative splicing ofMCL-1 leads to the generation of both anti- and proapoptotic proteins capable of heterodimerization. The short form of MCL-1 (MCL-1S), unlike the originally identified antiapoptotic MCL-1 long (MCL-1L), is a BH3 domain-only proapoptotic protein, and its action is antagonized by MCL-1L. The expressed sequence tag (EST) division of the GenBankTM data base was searched using the human MCL-1 cDNA sequence as a query. This search identified a total of three independent partial nucleotide sequences from an ovary tumor library (GenBankTM accession number AA464453) and a germinal center B-cell library (GenBankTM accession numbers AA521010 andAA749362) that were homologous to the known human MCL-1 cDNA except for a deletion of 248 nucleotides from the coding sequence (nucleotide numbers 689–936). The original cDNA clones from which these ESTs had been derived were obtained from the IMAGE consortium (Genome Systems, St. Louis), and their sequence was verified. Reverse transcription of human placenta total RNA (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), total RNA isolated from cultured human placenta cell line Hs 732.Pl (ATCC, Manassas, VA), or human myeloid leukemia cell line K-562 (ATCC) was performed using oligo(dT)18 primer and recombinant Moloney-murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as described in the manufacturer's protocol (CLONTECH). For polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of MCL-1 cDNAs, the DNA amount equivalent to 0.1 μg of total RNA was used in a 50-μl reaction. As a control, the same PCR was performed in the absence of cDNAs. The primers used were 5′-AGGAATTCGATGTTTGGCCTCAAAAGAAACGCGGTA-3′ and 5′-GAATTCGGAAGTTACAGCTTGGAGTCCAACTGC-3′. The latter primer corresponds to sequences of 78 or 89 nucleotides downstream from the predicted stop codon of MCL-1S and MCL-1L, respectively. MCL-1 cDNAs were amplified by 35 thermal cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min) from the human placenta cDNAs using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The predicted MCL-1S band was eluted and purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA), and the cDNA was sequenced. The sequences of the cDNA from human placenta matched with the postulated MCL-1 splicing variant from the EST data base, and the cDNA was named as MCL-1S. The known MCL-1 product was renamed MCL-1L. The Genomic Survey Sequence division of the GenBankTM data base was searched for genomic sequences representing the human MCL-1 gene. A Genomic Survey Sequence (accession number AQ192046) was found, and the original BAC clone was sequenced to verify its identity (Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL). In order to determine the structure of the human MCL-1 gene, the BAC clone was additionally sequenced using custom primers derived from parts of the coding sequence adjacent to the exon-intron junctions predicted from the MCL-1S sequence. To study the interactions between two human MCL-1 variants (MCL-1L and MCL-1S) and diverse other BCL-2 family proteins, cDNAs encoding MCL-1L and MCL-1S were subcloned into the EcoRI site of the activation domain of GAL4 in a yeast shuttle vector, pGADGH, and cDNAs encoding various pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins were fused to the GAL-4 binding domain of the pGBT9 vector (CLONTECH) (21Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. McGee E. Lomeli M. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12401-12406Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). Specific binding of different protein pairs was evaluated based on the activation of theGAL1-HIS3 reporter gene in medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine but in the presence of 30 mm3-aminotriazole (22Kaipia A. Hsu S.Y. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 5497-5504Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At least 10 different colonies expressing each pair of fusion protein were tested. Apoptosis was monitored following transfection of different cDNAs as described previously (21Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. McGee E. Lomeli M. Hsueh A.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12401-12406Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar) with modifications. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (2 × 105 cells/35-mm well) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mm glutamine. After 24 h of incubation, CHO cells were transfected using the LipofectAMINE procedure (Life Technologies, Inc.) with the pcDNA3 expression vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with or without different cDNA inserts, together with 0.1 amounts of the indicator plasmid pCMVβ (CLONTECH) to allow the identification of transfected cells. Inclusion of a 10-fold excess of expression vectors as compared with the pCMVβ reporter plasmid ensured that most of the β-galactosidase-expressing cells also expressed the protein(s) under investigation. After a 4-h incubation of cells with the transfection mixtures in a serum-free medium, the medium was replaced with the fresh medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and changed again 24 h later. Forty eight h after transfection, cells were fixed in 0.3% glutaraldehyde and stained with 0.4 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-d-galactoside (Life Technologies, Inc.) to detect β-galactosidase expression. The number of blue cells was counted by microscopic examination. Data were expressed as the percentage (mean ± S.E.) of viable cells as compared with the control group. After 24 h of culture, CHO cells (1.5 × 106) were transfected with 3 μg each of pcDNA3-MCL-1L or -MCL-1S, alone or together with FLAG epitope-tagged MCL-1S or MCL-1L, using the LipofectAMINE procedure. CHO cells were harvested at 24 h posttransfection and lysed in prechilled 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer containing 10% of a eukaryotic cell protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). In a control group, cells were transfected with MCL-1S together with FLAG-tagged BCL-xL. Following 30 min of incubation in the lysis buffer, the lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatants were collected. Aliquots of the lysates were precleared by incubation with normal mouse IgG and protein A-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) for 30 min at 4 °C. The precleared lysates were then incubated with 1 μg/ml anti-mouse FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 2 h and subsequently incubated with protein A-agarose for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were centrifuged for 5 min at 2,000 ×g and washed five times with 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The immunoprecipitates and aliquots of total lysates were boiled in SDS sample buffer for 5 min, subjected to 10% Tricine/SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (23Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10483) Google Scholar), and electroblotted onto 0.22-μm nitrocellulose membranes. The membrane was blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in Tris-buffered saline solution with 1% Tween 20 for 1 h followed by incubation with 0.2 μg/ml of the anti-rabbit MCL-1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was then incubated for 10 min with 0.1 μg/ml of anti-rabbit IgG-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Promega, Madison, WI) as a secondary antibody, before visualization by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The same membrane was stripped and incubated with 0.2 μg/ml of anti-mouse FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. The blot was exposed to the same secondary antibody and visualized by ECL. Due to the instability of MCL-1L and MCL-1S when expressed alone, twice the amount of total protein was loaded into SDS-PAGE. Also, five times of total protein was loaded when MCL-1S was coexpressed with FLAG-tagged BCL-xL. The existence of a short variant of MCL-1 was postulated based on sequences from the EST data base of GenBankTMidentical to the known human MCL-1 cDNA except for the deletion of 248 nucleotides near the 3′-end of the coding sequence. To confirm the existence of this novel splicing variant, the MCL-1S cDNA was amplified from human placenta, a human placental cell line Hs 732.Pl, and a human myeloid leukemia cell line K-562 following reverse transcription-PCR using specific MCL-1 primers. As shown in Fig.1 A, a minor transcript of 907 bp was amplified together with the known MCL-1 transcript of 1155 bp (lane 2, human placenta; lane 4, placenta cell line; lane 5, myeloid leukemia cell line). We named the truncated transcript as MCL-1S (short) to distinguish it from the known MCL-1L (long) transcript. The deduced amino acid sequence of MCL-1S encodes a protein of 271 amino acids long as compared with MCL-1L which has 350 amino acids (Fig. 1 B). Comparison of the two human splicing variants of MCL-1 indicated that the missing nucleotide stretch leads to a shift in the reading frame of the deduced protein after the BH3 domain. As a result, the short transcript lacks the BH1, BH2, and TM domains. Of interest, the unique C terminus of MCL-1S, a stretch of 41 amino acid residues, contains six cysteine and multiple basic residues, likely to be important for secondary structures. To understand the transcriptional mechanisms underlying the derivation of the MCL-1S transcript, a BAC clone containing the human MCL-1 gene was identified from the Genome Survey Sequence division of the GenBankTM. This clone was obtained and sequenced to reveal the intron-exon junctional sequences (Fig. 2 A) that conform to the so-called GT-AG rule (24Moore M.J. Query C.C. Sharp P.A. Gesteland R.F. Atkins J.F. The RNA World: The Nature of Modern RNA Suggests a Prebiotic RNA World. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993: 303-358Google Scholar). This analysis revealed that the coding sequence of MCL-1L is derived from three exons, separated by introns of 351 bp and more than 1-kilobase pair in size, respectively. Based on the intron-exon structure, it is apparent that MCL-1S results from the splicing out of the second exon of the gene, leading to a frameshift downstream from the BH3 domain and the loss of the BH1, BH2, and TM domains in the translated product (Fig. 2 B). The dimerization properties of human MCL-1S and MCL-1L with different pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 members were assessed in the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 3). In agreement with our earlier report using rat MCL-1(L) (25Leo C.P. Hsu S.Y. Chun S.Y. Bae H.W. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5469-5477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human MCL-1L interacted strongly with the proapoptotic BCL-2 family members BAX, BAK, and BOD/BIM isoforms but showed negligible interactions with BCL-xL, BCL-2, and BCL-w in the yeast system. In addition, MCL-1L did not homodimerize in yeast cells. In contrast, MCL-1S showed negligible interaction with any of the pro- or antiapoptotic BCL-2 family members tested with the exception of MCL-1L (of either human or rat origin). MCL-1S also did not homodimerize in the yeast system (data not shown). These data suggest that the two splicing variants of MCL-1 could form heterodimers. To confirm the dimerization of MCL-1S and MCL-1L in mammalian cellsin vivo, we further investigated the binding between the MCL-1 splicing variants in CHO cells transiently transfected with the MCL-1S and MCL-1L cDNAs. As shown in Fig.4, immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that MCL-1L could be coprecipitated with MCL-1S tagged with a FLAG epitope when the cell lysate was treated with the M2 antibody against the FLAG epitope. Likewise, MCL-1S was coprecipitated with MCL-1L when the latter protein was tagged with the FLAG epitope. In both tests, comparable amounts of the two splicing variants were detected using the MCL-1 antibody in immunoblots, suggesting a stoichiometric interaction between these proteins. In contrast, MCL-1S did not coprecipitate with FLAG-tagged BCL-xL, demonstrating the specificity of MCL-1S binding to MCL-1L. Of interest, when MCL-1S and MCL-1L were coexpressed, higher amounts of both proteins were detected, suggesting an enhancement of protein stabilization. It has been shown previously that the region encompassing the BH1 and BH2 domains of BCL-2 proteins is important for pore formation and for heterodimerization with other BCL-2 members (26Antonsson B. Conti F. Ciavatta A. Montessuit S. Lewis S. Martinou I. Bernasconi L. Bernard A. Mermod J.J. Mazzei G. Maundrell K. Gambale F. Sadoul R. Martinou J.C.

A. 1997; 94: 5113-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), whereas the TM region is important for the anchoring of BCL-2 proteins to mitochondria and other cellular organelles (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar, 18Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T. Turka L.A. Mao X.

Several BH3 domain-only BCL-2 family proteins were found to be proapoptotic “ligands” capable of suppressing the function of membrane-bound antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins following heterodimerization (11Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 285-291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar, 29Boyd J.M. Gallo G.J. Elangovan B. Houghton A.B.

Bolton J. Shi L. Dubik D. Greenberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7-10Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because the MCL-1S protein lacks the pore-forming region and the TM domains but retains the BH3 dimerization domain, we tested the role of MCL-1S as a proapoptotic BH3-only protein. As shown in Fig.5 A, transfection of increasing amounts of the MCL-1S expression plasmid into CHO cells led to dose-dependent cell killing. The proapoptotic effect of MCL-1S was blocked following cotransfection with P35, a pan-specific caspase inhibitor of baculoviral origin (31Clem R.J. Fechheimer M. Miller L.K. Science. 1991; 254: 1388-1390Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar), suggesting MCL-1S-induced cell killing is mediated by downstream effector caspase. Furthermore, cotransfection with different amounts of the plasmid encoding MCL-1L blocked the proapoptotic effect of MCL-1S, suggesting antagonistic actions between the two splicing variants of the MCL-1 gene (Fig. 5 B). MCL-1S-induced cell killing was completely inhibited by MCL-1L at a plasmid ratio of 3:1. In contrast, two antiapoptotic BCL-2 proteins (BCL-xL and BCL-w) not capable of interacting with MCL-1S were less effective in antagonizing the action of MCL-1S (Fig. 5 B). At a high plasmid concentration (0.7 μg/culture), both BCL-xL and BCL-w reduced the number of viable cells in the present assay. In contrast to its complete antagonism of MCL-1S action, MCL-1L was minimally effective in antagonizing the action of another BH3 domain-only protein BOD-L even when 700-fold excess of MCL-1L plasmid was used (Fig. 5 B). We have isolated a naturally occurring alternatively spliced variant of MCL-1 that has different structural features and a diametrically opposing action as compared with the known antiapoptotic MCL-1 protein, now named MCL-1 long (L). The short splicing variant, MCL-1S, originally identified in germinal center B-cell and ovarian tumor cDNA libraries as partial sequences, and isolated as a full-length coding sequence from both human placenta and human myeloid leukemia cells, results from the deletion of 248 nucleotides from the full-length MCL-1L cDNA. A shift in the open reading frame leads to the complete loss of the BH1, BH2, and TM domains and the derivation of an altered C-terminal sequence. The two splicing variants of theMCL-1 gene are capable of forming dimers, and the proapoptotic action of MCL-1S can be antagonized by MCL-1L. Based on their structural and functional attributes, BCL-2 proteins can be divided into three subgroups as follows: 1) the antiapoptotic channel-forming BCL-2 proteins with three or four BH domains (BH1 to 3/4) and a TM anchor sequence; 2) the proapoptotic channel-forming proteins with BH1 to BH3 domains; and 3) the proapoptotic ligands containing only the BH3 domain (9Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4813) Google Scholar, 32Gross A. McDonnell J.M. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1899-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (3255) Google Scholar, 33Tsujimoto Y. Genes Cells. 1998; 3: 697-707Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). The first two subgroups of proteins are believed to be anchored to the outer mitochondrial membrane, whereas the third subgroup of proteins acts as ligands that dimerize with the membrane-anchored, channel-forming BCL-2 “receptors” (34Wang K. Yin X.M. Chao D.T. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2859-2869Crossref PubMed Scopus (807) Google Scholar, 35Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar). The BH3 domains in the third subgroup are essential for the binding activity of these ligands. MCL-1S is missing the BH1, BH2, and TM domains but retains the BH3 domain, whereas MCL-1L contains all of these domains. Thus, MCL-1S resembles other proapoptotic BH3 domain-only family proteins, and the MCL-1gene encodes proteins belonging to two of the three subgroups of BCL-2 family proteins. Overexpression of MCL-1S decreases the viability of CHO cells in a dose-dependent manner, and its cell-killing effect is mediated by caspase activation because P35 effectively inhibits the proapoptotic activity of MCL-1S. Furthermore, the apoptotic action of MCL-1S was completely antagonized by MCL-1L but partially blocked by noninteracting proteins BCL-xL and BCL-w. In addition to the derivation of proteins of opposing functions, the alternative splicing of MCL-1S could also utilize overlapping transcriptional machinery for the synthesis of MCL-1L, leading to decreased levels of MCL-1L transcripts. In eukaryotic cells, MCL-1L was capable of interacting with other proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (BAX, BAK, and BOD variants) but not with antiapoptotic proteins (BCL-2, BCL-w, and BCL-xL), as demonstrated by the yeast two-hybrid assay. In contrast, MCL-1S did not interact with any other member of BCL-2 family that was tested but exhibited a strong interaction with MCL-1L in the yeast assay. Furthermore, the binding between MCL-1S and MCL-1L was confirmed in mammalian cells based on immunoprecipitation tests. The observed heterodimerization appears to be stoichiometric because comparable amounts of MCL-1L and MCL-1S proteins were detected following coprecipitation. These findings suggest that the balance between antiapoptotic MCL-1L and proapoptotic MCL-1S could determine the fate of cells that express both proteins. Dimer formation between pro- and antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, mediated by their highly conserved BH domains, is thought to serve as a “rheostat” for the determination of cell fate through mutual antagonism. The observations that MCL-1L interacts widely with different proapoptotic BCL-2-related proteins, whereas MCL-1S interacts only with MCL-1L, suggest that the alternative splicing mechanism in an MCL-1L-expressing cell could be regulated under certain physiological or pathological conditions thus leading to the synthesis of the proapoptotic MCL-1S protein to induce cell death. We tested possible changes in MCL-1 variant expression using both the human placental cell line Hs732.P1 and the human myeloid leukemia cell line K-562. The ratio of MCL-1L/MCL-1S mRNAs was determined by reverse transcription-PCR after treatment of cultured cells with staurosporine or etoposide or after serum deprivation. However, these treatments did not affect the ratio of MCL-1L/MCL-1S mRNA levels. In addition, endogenous MCL-1S protein expression in the immature rat ovary, spleen, and uterus could not be detected in immunoblots (data not shown). Future studies are needed to identify the mechanisms and conditions regulating the alternative splicing of the MCL-1 gene. Analysis of MCL-1 gene genomic structure and its comparison with MCL-1L and MCL-1S cDNAs indicate the skipping of exon 2, which is also observed in other BCL-2 family members such as the variants of BCL-2, BOK, and BAX (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1993; 74: 609-619Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (5868) Google Scholar, 16Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Alternatively spliced products have been found for several BCL-2-related proteins, caspases, and death receptors in the apoptosis regulatory pathway (15Jiang Z.H. Wu J.Y. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1999; 220: 64-72Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). BCL-2 exists in two forms as the result of alternative splicing, BCL-2α and BCL-2β (16Tsujimoto Y. Croce C.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5214-5218Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar). The mouse bcl-x gene encodes five variants, BCL-xL, BCL-xS, BCL-xβ, BCL-xγ, and BCL-xΔTM, each possessing different domains (18Boise L.H. Gonzalez-Garcia M. Postema C.E. Ding L. Lindsten T.

BCL-w was also shown to have variants BCL-w and BCL-w-rox (39Gibson L. Holmgreen S.P. Huang D.C. Bernard O. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Sutherland G.R. Baker E. Adams J.M. Cory S. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 665-675PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to the antiapoptotic subfamily of BCL-2, splicing variants of proapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins (e.g. BAX, BOK, and BOD/BIM) have also been isolated (10Oltvai Z.N. Milliman C.L.

However, compared with other known variants of BCL-2 family proteins, the splicing of MCL-1S from the MCL-1 gene is unique in its consequences for domain structure and biological function. Indeed, MCL-1S is the only known splicing variant of abcl-2 family gene that possesses intrinsic proapoptotic activity in normal cells and dimerizes with another variant of the same gene. The discovery of MCL-1S with proapoptotic activity expands the BH3 domain-only BCL-2 subfamily. Multiple members of this subfamily have been reported, including mammalian BAD, BID, BIK/NBK, BLK, BOD/BIM, HRK, NIP3, and NIX (11Yang E. Zha J. Jockel J. Boise L.H. Thompson C.B. Korsmeyer S.J.

In addition, EGL-1, the nematode counterpart of BH3-only cell death activator, was also identified (47Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). EGL-1 is required for programmed cell death inCaenorhabditis elegans because gain-of-function mutations ofegl-1 cause apoptosis in hermaphrodite-specific neurons, and a loss-of-function egl-1 mutation prevents most of the somatic programmed cell death (47Conradt B. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 1998; 93: 519-529Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The binding of EGL-1 to the nematode BCL-2 homolog, CED-9, disrupts the interaction of CED-9 with CED-4, a homolog to human APAF-1, and promotes the activation of a caspase CED-9 (48del Peso L. Gonzalez V.M. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33495-33500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Based on the present finding of MCL-1 variants with characteristics similar to both ced-9 and egl-1, one can postulate that these two types of genes are derived from a common ancestry through gene duplication and exon loss. BH-3 domain-only BCL-2 subfamily proteins can be further divided into two groups based on the presence or absence of the TM anchor region. Like MCL-1S, BAD and BID have the BH3 domain but without the TM region. Under a survival signal, BAD is phosphorylated on two serine residues and sequestered by the cytoplasmic 14-3-3 proteins in an inactive form (35Zha J. Harada H. Yang E. Jockel J. Korsmeyer S.J. Cell. 1996; 87: 619-628Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2255) Google Scholar, 49Hsu S.Y. Kaipia A. Zhu L. Hsueh A.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1997; 11: 1858-1867Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Following a death signal, BAD is dephosphorylated and translocated to the mitochondria membrane where it interacts with BCL-xL or BCL-2 (50Kelekar A. Chang B.S. Harlan J.E. Fesik S.W. Thompson C.B.

In contrast, another BH3 domain-only protein, BID, translocates from cytosol to mitochondria following caspase-8-mediated cleavage at its N terminus, and the truncated BID releases cytochrome c to induce apoptosis (52Gross A.

Because most BH3-only proteins interact with at least one of the antiapoptotic BCL-2 family proteins, it is reasonable to suggest that the heterodimerization and antagonism between MCL-1S and MCL-1L observed here are of physiological significance. Several anti- and proapoptotic BCL-2 family genes (bax, bcl-2, bcl-xL, bfl-1/A1, egl-1, hrk, and MCL-1) are transcriptionally inducible. Survival factors that induce MCL-1 in hematopoietic cells include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-3 (54Chao J.R. Wang J.M. Lee S.F. Peng H.W.

We recently demonstrated that gonadotropins stimulate MCL-1 mRNA expression in ovarian granulosa and theca cells to suppress follicle cell apoptosis (25Leo C.P. Hsu S.Y. Chun S.Y. Bae H.W. Hsueh A.J. Endocrinology. 1999; 140: 5469-5477Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The MCL-1 protein is induced rapidly and has a high turnover rate that may be related to its unique PEST motifs not found in other BCL-2 members (12Kozopas K.M. Yang T. Buchan H.L. Zhou P. Craig R.W.

Even though MCL-1 shares many common properties with other BCL-2 family proteins, its rapid turnover rate and transcription into variants exhibiting either anti- or proapoptotic actions are unique for regulating apoptosis in tissues that require rapid adaptation and turnover of cells. The present demonstration of the expression of splicing variants of MCL-1 encoding proteins with diametrically opposing actions raises the possibility that the regulation of apoptosis in a given cell can be controlled by the expression of varying levels of the antiapoptotic MCL-1L and the proapoptotic MCL-1S transcripts. The present model underscores the importance of alternative splicing events in the regulation of cell function. We thank M. Cleary (Stanford, CA) for BCL-2 cDNA; S.

https://openalex.org/W2110728570,"To assess whether selective microtubule-based vesicle transport underlies the polarized distribution of neuronal proteins, we expressed green fluorescent protein- (GFP-) tagged chimeras of representative axonal and dendritic membrane proteins in cultured hippocampal neurons and visualized the transport of carrier vesicles containing these proteins in living cells. Vesicles containing a dendritic protein, transferrin receptor (TfR), were preferentially transported into dendrites and excluded from axons. In contrast, vesicles containing the axonal protein NgCAM (neuron-glia cell adhesion molecule) were transported into both dendrites and axons. These data demonstrate that neurons utilize two distinct mechanisms for the targeting of polarized membrane proteins, one (for dendritic proteins) based on selective transport, the other (for axonal proteins) based on a selectivity ""filter"" that occurs downstream of transport."
https://openalex.org/W2130040193,"Little is known of mechanisms regulating presynaptic differentiation. We identified rpm-1 in a screen for mutants with defects in patterning of a presynaptic marker at certain interneuronal synapses. The predicted RPM-1 protein contains zinc binding, RCC1, and other conserved motifs. In rpm-1 mutants, mechanosensory neurons fail to accumulate tagged vesicles, retract synaptic branches, and ectopically extend axons. Some motor neurons branch and overgrow; others show altered synaptic organization. Expression of RPM-1 in the presynaptic mechanosensory neurons is sufficient to rescue phenotypes in these cells. Certain rpm-1 phenotypes are temperature sensitive, revealing that RPM-1 function can be bypassed by maintaining mutants at the permissive temperature at stages commensurate with synapse formation in wild-type animals. These results indicate that RPM-1 functions cell autonomously during synaptogenesis to regulate neuronal morphology."

Whether these receptors are redundant, interact, or serve only partially overlapping functions is unknown. We report that PAR1 and PAR4 signal with distinct tempos. In transfected fibroblasts, PAR4 triggered substantially more phosphoinositide hydrolysis per activated receptor than PAR1 and was shut off more slowly than PAR1. Shutoff and internalization of PAR1 depends upon phosphorylation of its carboxyl tail upon receptor activation. In contrast to PAR1, phosphorylation of PAR4 was undetectable, and activation-dependent internalization of PAR4 was much slower than that seen for PAR1. Mutation of potential phosphorylation sites in the carboxyl tail of PAR1 enhanced PAR1 signaling, whereas analogous mutations in PAR4 had no effect. Thus PAR4 signaling is shut off less rapidly than PAR1, probably due to differences in receptor phosphorylation. PAR1 and PAR4 also signaled with distinct tempos in platelets. PAR1 triggered a rapid and transient increase in intracellular calcium, whereas PAR4 triggered a more prolonged response.

Elsevier Biomedical Press, Amsterdam1981: 43-74Google Scholar). This action of thrombin is thought to be critical for hemostasis and thrombosis. Cellular responses to thrombin are mediated by a family of G protein-coupled protease-activated receptors (PARs)1 (3Coughlin S.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11023-11027Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). Cleavage of the amino-terminal exodomain of a PAR unmasks a tethered ligand that binds to the body of the receptor to trigger signaling. Synthetic peptides that mimic these tethered ligands are agonists for their respective PARs and have been used as pharmacological probes of PAR function in various cell types. Three thrombin-activated receptors, PAR1, PAR3, and PAR4, have been identified (4Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R.

Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Both receptors are expressed by platelets, and activation of either PAR1 or PAR4 with their cognate agonist peptides was sufficient to trigger platelet ATP secretion and aggregation. PAR1-blocking antibodies inhibited platelet secretion and aggregation at low but not high concentrations of thrombin. PAR4-blocking antibodies alone had little effect on platelet activation, but inhibition of both PAR1 and PAR4 with blocking antibodies markedly attenuated platelet activation even at high concentrations of thrombin. In heterologous expression systems, higher concentrations of thrombin were required for cleavage of PAR4 than PAR1. Taken together, these observations suggest that PAR1 is the primary mediator of platelet activation at low concentrations of thrombin and that, in the absence of PAR1 function, PAR4 can mediate platelet activation at high concentrations of thrombin. This model raises the question of why two thrombin receptors are present in human platelets. Are PAR1 and PAR4 simply redundant, do they interact, or do they serve distinct or only partially overlapping functions? Because PARs are activated irreversibly by proteolytic cleavage, they have the potential to signal indefinitely. Previous studies have shown, however, that PAR1 signaling is rapidly shut off after activation by thrombin. Initial uncoupling and internalization depend on PAR1 phosphorylation, and receptor recycling and “resignaling” is prevented by delivery of internalized receptors to lysosomes (10Ishii K. Chen J.

Here we report that PAR4 signaling is markedly more prolonged than PAR1 signaling in both heterologous expression systems and human platelets. PAR4 failed to undergo agonist-triggered phosphorylation and was internalized much more slowly than PAR1. Hence, PAR1 and PAR4 differ in the rate at which they are shut off after activation. Expression of these two distinct receptors may thus serve as a means of specifying the tempo with which thrombin activates intracellular signaling pathways. Human α-thrombin was from Enzyme Research Laboratories. The PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN and the PAR4 agonist peptide AYPGKF were synthesized as carboxyl-terminal amides and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography (17Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J.

Cells plated in 24-well tissue culture plates were labeled overnight in serum-free medium with [3H]inositol (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) as described (20Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R.

Cells were incubated at 37 °C for various periods (see figure legends) in serum-free medium containing, where indicated, thrombin, 1 unit/ml hirudin, and/or 20 mmlithium chloride to block metabolism of inositol phosphates. Cells were then lysed, and the total amount of [3H]inositol phosphates released was measured as described (20Hung D.T. Vu T.-K.H. Nelken N.A. Coughlin S.R. J.

Cells plated in 24-well dishes were washed once in PBS and fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, and anti-FLAG antibody binding was then measured as an index of surface receptor level as described previously (22Shapiro M.J.

Briefly, cells were incubated with M1 anti-FLAG antibody (2.5 μg/ml) in assay medium for 1 h. Cells were washed and then incubated with goat anti-mouse secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (Bio-Rad) for 30 min. The cells were washed three times and then incubated for approximately 10 min with a solution containing a chromogenic substrate for horseradish peroxidase, which is converted to a product that absorbs light at 405 nm (1-step 2,2′-azine-di(3-ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate), Pierce). This solution was then removed from the cells, and its absorbance was measured. A 405 varies linearly with the density of FLAG epitope on the cell surface over the range covered in these experiments (23Ishii K. Gerszten R. Zheng Y.-W. Welsh J.B. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16435-16440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Cell surface receptor levels were determined in parallel assays of cells plated together with those used for each signaling experiment shown. Mean A 405(n = 3) values for each cell type are presented in the individual figure legends. To measure receptor cleavage, cells were washed in PBS, incubated with thrombin in assay medium at 37 °C, washed twice in PBS, and then fixed. Anti-FLAG antibody binding to surface receptors was then assayed as above. Because the FLAG epitope is removed by thrombin cleavage, FLAG antibody binding provides a measurement of uncleaved surface receptors and allows the percentage cleavage to be calculated by comparison with untreated cells (18Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To measure receptor internalization (22Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29009-29014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), cells were washed in PBS, incubated with assay medium containing PAR1 or PAR4 agonist peptide at 37 °C, and fixed, and then anti-FLAG antibody binding to surface receptors was assayed as above. Internalization was indicated by a decrease in surface receptor level in comparison with untreated cells. PAR1:S/T → A is a human PAR1 mutant in which all serine and threonine residues in the receptor's cytoplasmic tail are replaced by alanines (10Ishii K. Chen J. Ishii M. Koch W.J. Freedman N.J.

A cDNA encoding hPAR4 in which serine residues 359, 366, 369, 374, 381, and 382, and threonine residues 363 and 379 were replaced by alanines was constructed by subcloning a synthetic insert generated by ligating three pairs of oligonucleotides together between an internal PvuII site (5′) and an XbaI site (3′) in the vector. Except where noted, receptor phosphorylation was assayed as described previously (11Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells cultured in 6-well dishes were labeled with 250 μCi/well [32P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) at 37 °C for 3 h. Next, cells were stimulated with agonist peptides, washed in PBS, and lysed in an immunoprecipitation buffer (11Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) that included 1% Triton X-100, protease inhibitors, and phosphatase inhibitors. This and all subsequent steps were performed at 4 °C. For each sample analyzed, cells in two wells that had been treated identically were lysed in 0.75 ml of buffer/well and the lysates combined. The lysates were cleared by centrifugation and then 7.5 μg of M2 anti-FLAG antibody and 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose (Sigma) were added. These mixtures were incubated for 90 min and then washed three times. The beads were resuspended in 84 μl immunoprecipitation buffer and eluted with FLAG epitope peptide (sequence DYKDDDDK (Sigma), final concentration 0.2 mg/ml) for 30 min. Beads were removed by centrifugation and varying amounts of eluate analyzed (Fig. 3). Peptide elution allowed PAR1 and PAR4 to be dissociated from anti-FLAG antibody without reduction or boiling and reduced the amount of antibody in the final samples. Gel loading buffer was then added to the samples so that the final concentration of SDS was 2%. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis through a 9% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were then transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. The filter was blocked in 5% milk, exposed to x-ray film to allow detection of phosphoproteins and immunoblotted with anti-FLAG antibody to detect receptor protein. Bound antibody was detected using the ECL+ reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Washed human platelets were prepared from freshly drawn blood as described (9Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M.

To initiate PAR4 or PAR1 desensitization, platelets were treated for 30 min at room temperature with the PAR4 agonist peptide AYPGKF (500 μm) (17Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Hung W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) or with the PAR1 agonist peptide SFLLRN (100 μm) (9Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). Platelets were then stimulated with thrombin or an agonist peptide, and intracellular calcium mobilization was measured by fluorometry (24Sage S.O. Use of Fluorescent Indicators to Measure Intracellular Ca2+ and Other Ions in Platelets, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 67-90Google Scholar, 25Ishihara H. Zeng D. Connolly A.J. Tam C. Coughlin S.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 4152-4157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To block platelet aggregation, 0.1 mm EGTA was added immediately prior to each calcium mobilization assay, and 0.1 mmCaCl2 was added immediately prior to cell lysis (24Sage S.O. Use of Fluorescent Indicators to Measure Intracellular Ca2+ and Other Ions in Platelets, A Practical Approach. IRL Press, Oxford1996: 67-90Google Scholar). Unless otherwise noted, each data point represents the mean ± S.D. (n = 3). We first compared PAR1- and PAR4-mediated signaling in Rat1 fibroblasts. This allowed signaling to be assayed in a system in which the levels of cell surface PAR1 and PAR4 could be accurately compared. To accomplish this, the cells were stably transfected with receptors displaying identical FLAG epitopes at their amino termini and the binding of an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody to the cell surface was measured using an enzyme-linked secondary antibody. We first examined thrombin-triggered PI hydrolysis in transfected Rat1 cells (Fig. 1). Maximal thrombin-triggered PI hydrolysis in cells expressing PAR4 was reliably higher than that seen in cells expressing PAR1, even when PAR4 was expressed at a lower density than PAR1 on the cell surface. For example, the cell line PAR4.1 reliably displayed 2.5-fold more PI hydrolysis than did a cell line expressing PAR1 despite expressing only 38% as much cell surface receptor. Similarly, a second PAR4-expressing cell line (PAR4.2) generated significantly more signal than the PAR1-expressing cells despite expressing only 18% as much surface receptor. Qualitatively similar results were obtained in transiently transfected COS7 cells (Fig. 4) and in a stably transfected lung fibroblast cell line derived from a PAR1 knockout mouse (17Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Hung W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Thus, on a per surface receptor basis, PAR4 is more effective than PAR1 in triggering PI hydrolysis.Figure 4Signaling by PAR1 and PAR4 phosphorylation site mutants. COS7 cells were transiently transfected with wild-type PAR1, wild-type PAR4, a PAR1 mutant in which all the serine and threonines in the cytoplasmic tail were replaced with alanines (PAR1:S/T → A), with an analogous PAR4 mutant (PAR4:S/T → A), or with empty pBJ expression vector (none). [3H]Inositol-labeled cells were incubated in serum-free medium with 20 mm LiCl for 15 min at 37 °C in the presence (filled bars) or absence (empty bars) of 30 nm thrombin. Cells were then washed twice in PBS and incubated for an additional 75 min in serum-free medium with 20 mm LiCl and 1 unit/ml hirudin. Accumulated [3H]inositol phosphates were then measured (mean ± S.D.; n = 4). The surface receptor levels (A 405) were 0.75, 0.77, 1.2, 1.2, and 0.01 for wild-type and mutant PAR1, wild-type and mutant PAR4, and empty vector-transfected cells, respectively. PAR4 and PAR4:S/T → A did display higher basal activity than did PAR1 in these cells; the basis for this difference is unknown. This experiment was replicated twice.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Each activated PAR4 molecule might yield more net PI hydrolysis than each PAR1 by either generating more signal per unit time while active and/or by each activated receptor signaling longer before being shut off. Accordingly, we also compared PAR1 and PAR4 shutoff (Fig. 1). Rat1 cell lines expressing PAR1 or PAR4 were incubated with thrombin for 1 h without lithium chloride. Under these conditions, receptors are cleaved and activated and PI hydrolysis is stimulated, but due to the absence of lithium, inositol phosphates fail to accumulate. After this initial incubation, thrombin was removed by washing, hirudin was added to inactivate any residual thrombin, and the cells were incubated for an additional hour in the presence of lithium. Inositol phosphates accumulated during this second incubation thus reflect ongoing signaling by receptors that had been activated by thrombin during the first incubation. Because the concentration of thrombin used is sufficient to cleave nearly all cell surface receptors within 10 min (not shown), the majority of receptors would have had substantial time to shut off. As described previously (11Hammes S.R. Shapiro M.J. Coughlin S.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2486-2493Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 26Vouret-Craviari V. Auberger P. Pouyssegur J.

A. 1998; 95: 13698-13702Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), PAR1 showed efficient shutoff in this assay. The signal generated when the thrombin and lithium incubations were sequential was only 20% of the signal generated when thrombin and lithium were presented simultaneously. In contrast, when PAR4-expressing cell lines were examined, the signal observed with sequential incubations was ∼80% of that seen with thrombin and lithium together (Fig. 1). These data suggest that each activated PAR4 molecule signals for a longer time than PAR1. To obtain a more detailed assessment of the tempo of PAR1- and PAR4-mediated PI hydrolysis, Rat1 cells expressing PAR1 or PAR4 were treated with thrombin for 10 min in the presence of lithium. Thrombin was then removed, hirudin was added, and the cells were further incubated in the presence of lithium. Accumulated [3H]inositol phosphates were measured after various periods. This allowed signaling triggered by receptors activated in the first 10 min to be monitored in the absence of additional receptor activation. Under these conditions, the rate of PI hydrolysis triggered by PAR1 decreased abruptly by approximately 7-fold upon removal of thrombin, consistent with previous observations (18Ishii K. Hein L. Kobilka B. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9780-9786Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, the rate of PI hydrolysis triggered by PAR4 was virtually unchanged after removal of thrombin. In this experiment, PAR1 was expressed on the cell surface at a greater level than PAR4 and a greater fraction of PAR1 molecules were cleaved than PAR4 molecules (see Fig.2 legend). Hence, the rate at which signaling in response to PAR1 activation is shut off is much greater than the rate at which PAR4 signaling is shut off. Upon activation, many G protein-coupled receptors are rapidly phosphorylated and then bind arrestins. Arrestin binding serves to both prevent further interaction with G proteins and to recruit activated receptors to clathrin-coated pits for internalization (28Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Ann. Rev.

Given the slow shutoff of PAR4 signaling, these observations raise the question of whether PAR4 might show decreased phosphorylation and internalization compared with PAR1. To assay receptor phosphorylation, the cell lines described above were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with the PAR1 agonist SFLLRN or the PAR4 agonist AYPGKF (Fig.3). AYPGKF, a derivative of the PAR4-tethered ligand GYPGQV, triggers PAR4 signaling in fibroblasts to the same extent as thrombin, whereas GYPGQV is a weaker agonist (17Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Hung W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Both receptors were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates via the FLAG epitope tag on their amino termini, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by autoradiography and FLAG immunoblot. Because PAR1 and PAR4 were detected using the same antibody to the same epitope at the same relative position in the receptor protein, the relative intensities of the PAR1 and PAR4 bands on the immunoblot likely reflect the relative amounts of PAR1 and PAR4 protein recovered in the immunoprecipitates. PAR1 displayed robust agonist-triggered phosphorylation (Fig. 3,upper panel, lanes 4 and 5). By contrast, no agonist-triggered phosphorylation of PAR4 was detected (lanes 6 and 7). Anti-FLAG immunoblot readily detected PAR1 at the same molecular weight as the phosphorylated band in immunoprecipitates from PAR1-transfected but not untransfected cells (Fig. 3, lower panel, lanes 4 and 5). PAR4 protein was also apparent by immunoblot of PAR4-transfected but not untransfected cells. The amount of PAR4 recovered in immunoprecipitates from lysates of PAR4-expressing cells was less than the amount of PAR1 recovered from PAR1-expressing cells, consistent with the relatively lower expression level of PAR4 in the cell lines used. To compensate for this difference, the amount of PAR1 immunoprecipitate analyzed was reduced by a factor of 10 (Fig. 3,lanes 1 and 2). Under these conditions, the amount of PAR1 detected by immunoblot was less than the amount of PAR4 (compare lanes 1 and 2 with lanes 6and 7), but agonist-triggered phosphorylation of PAR1 was still clearly apparent (lane 2). These data indicate that PAR4 phosphorylation would have been detected if PAR4 were phosphorylated to an extent comparable to PAR1. We conclude that PAR4 is either not phosphorylated or is phosphorylated at a rate or to an extent markedly less than PAR1. We also assessed the importance of potential phosphorylation sites in PAR4 by mutagenesis. A PAR1 mutant (PAR1:S/T → A), in which the 13 serines and threonines in its cytoplasmic tail were replaced with alanines, was not phosphorylated, triggered substantially more PI hydrolysis upon activation than wild-type PAR1, and exhibited a delay in receptor shutoff (10Ishii K.

Chem. 1996; 271: 702-706Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). The cognate PAR4 mutant (PAR4:S/T → A), in which the 8 serines and threonines in its cytoplasmic tail were replaced with alanines, was generated to determine if a similar change in signaling properties would result. COS7 cells expressing wild-type PAR4 or PAR4:S/T → A showed similar increases in PI hydrolysis when stimulated with 30 nm thrombin (Fig.4) or with submaximal concentrations of thrombin (not shown). By contrast, PAR1:S/T → A mediated substantially more PI hydrolysis than did wild-type PAR1 (Fig. 4). These data suggest that PAR4 is either not phosphorylated on its cytoplasmic tail or such phosphorylation does not significantly attenuate its signaling. Agonist-triggered internalization of PAR1 is dependent on its phosphorylation, as inferred from the observation that PAR1:S/T → A was defective in this function (19Shapiro M.J. Trejo J. Zeng D. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). If PAR4 phosphorylation is less robust than PAR1 phosphorylation, one might anticipate that agonist-triggered internalization of PAR4 would be similarly decreased. To test this prediction, receptor internalization was assayed in Rat1 cells (Fig. 5). A ∼50% decrease in cell surface PAR1 was observed within 20 min of stimulation with SFLLRN and a ∼80% decrease was observed after 1 h. By contrast, only a ∼35% decrease in cell surface PAR4 was observed even 1 h after stimulation with AYPGKF. Thus PAR4 undergoes less robust agonist-triggered internalization than PAR1, consistent with PAR4's slower shutoff and lack of phosphorylation. To determine if the different tempos of signaling exhibited by the PAR1 and PAR4 in heterologous expression systems might be seen in cells in which both receptors are endogenously expressed, PAR1- and PAR4-mediated calcium mobilization was examined in human platelets (Fig. 6). Thrombin triggered a rapid increase in the intracellular calcium concentration followed by a relatively slow return to baseline. The t12 for this response was 253 s (t12 is defined as the length of time between the addition of agonist and the time at which the intracellular calcium level returned halfway to baseline after reaching a peak level). PAR1 activation recapitulated the rapid rise in intracellular calcium triggered by thrombin but not the prolonged nature of the thrombin response. The PAR1 agonist SFLLRN triggered a rapid increase in intracellular calcium and a rapid return to baseline (t12 = 54 s). By contrast, PAR4 activation mimicked the prolonged rise in intracellular calcium triggered by thrombin but not the rapid rise. The PAR4 agonist AYPGKF triggered a relatively gradual increase in intracellular calcium that was followed by a gradual return to the baseline level (t12 = 203 s). Calcium mobilization in response to thrombin was also measured in platelets in which either PAR1 or PAR4 was desensitized by prolonged incubation with the appropriate agonist peptide. Under these conditions, the contribution of the desensitized receptor to calcium mobilization is minimized (9Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar, 17Faruqi T.R. Weiss E.J. Shapiro M.J. Hung W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 19728-19734Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). The peak increases in intracellular calcium were reduced under these conditions, presumably due to prior calcium signaling during desensitization; however, the data again show differences in the tempo of PAR1 and PAR4 signaling (Fig. 6,d and e). When PAR4-desensitized platelets were stimulated with thrombin, relatively transient calcium mobilization was observed (t12 = 66 s), similar to that seen in naı̈ve platelets activated with SFLLRN. When PAR1-desensitized platelets were stimulated with thrombin, the calcium level rose and decayed relatively slowly (t12 = 390 s), similar to that seen in naı̈ve platelets activated with AYPGKF. These results suggest that PAR1 and PAR4 signal with different tempos in human platelets when activated by either thrombin or their agonist peptides. PAR1 triggers a rapid increase in cytoplasmic calcium followed by a rapid decay, whereas PAR4 triggers a more gradual and prolonged increase in cytoplasmic calcium. Thrombin-triggered calcium signaling in human platelets seems to be a composite of PAR1 and PAR4 signaling, with the rapid rise presumably being PAR1-mediated and the prolonged elevation being PAR4-mediated. Curiously, measurement of PAR1- and PAR4-mediated calcium mobilization in transfected fibroblasts did not reveal differences in the rate at which elevations in intracellular calcium concentration returned to baseline (not shown). Specifically, cytoplasmic calcium levels returned very rapidly to baseline after an increase was triggered by activation of either receptor. Because striking differences in the rate at which PAR1- and PAR4-mediated PI hydrolysis was shut off were seen in the same cell lines, we conclude that the machinery for calcium homeostasis in fibroblasts allows only transient increases in cytoplasmic calcium and that, after a time, ongoing signaling at the level of PI hydrolysis is not reflected by sustained increases in cytoplasmic calcium in these cells. The molecular basis for the different tempos of calcium signaling seen in platelets and fibroblasts is unknown. In summary, we report that PAR1 and PAR4 signal with distinct tempos in two systems. In transfected fibroblasts, PAR4 triggered more PI hydrolysis per cleaved and activated receptor and more ongoing PI hydrolysis after removal of thrombin than did PAR1. In human platelets, PAR4 activation triggered a more persistent elevation in cytoplasmic calcium than did PAR1. These observations suggest that PAR4 is uncoupled from G protein signaling more slowly than PAR1. In accord with this notion, PAR4 was either not phosphorylated upon activation or phosphorylated to a substantially lesser extent than PAR1, and PAR4 internalized much less robustly than PAR1. Mutation of potential phosphorylation sites in PAR4 had little effect on its signaling, whereas such mutations enhanced PAR1 signaling (Fig. 4) and attenuated both PAR1 shutoff (10Ishii K. Chen J.

Chem. 1996; 271: 32874-32880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). Thus, in several ways PAR4 behaves like the mutant PAR1 that lacks phosphorylation sites. Taken together, these data show that PAR1 and PAR4 signal with distinct tempos in several cell systems, perhaps due to differences in the rate and/or extent of agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation. The molecular basis for the lack of PAR4 phosphorylation is not known. PAR4 does have potential serine and threonine phosphorylation sites in its carboxyl tail, but it is possible that other features of the sequence or perhaps the structure of this region make PAR4 an intrinsically poor substrate for receptor kinases compared with PAR1. Alternatively, it is possible that the membrane microenvironment in which PAR4 resides or the βγ subunits and signaling molecules with which PAR4 interacts may dictate less efficient interactions with receptor kinases. What is the biological significance of the differences in the kinetics of PAR1 and PAR4 signaling? Together, these receptors appear to account for the tempo of calcium signaling in platelets activated by high concentrations of thrombin, thus their signaling phenotypes appear to account for an important second messenger response in “real” cells. But why use two receptors with distinct tempos of signaling? The thrombin concentration required for PAR1 activation is lower than that for PAR4 (7Kahn M.L. Zheng Y.W. Huang W. Bigornia V. Zeng D.

Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). It may be advantageous for platelets that “see” only low concentrations of thrombin and experience subthreshold or partial activation via PAR1, as might occur in the bloodstream passing by an incipient thrombus, to become quiescent again by virtue of rapid shutoff of PAR1 signaling. By contrast, platelets exposed to sufficient thrombin to activate PAR4 may have a very high probability of being incorporated into a thrombus, making shutoff irrelevant. However, high thrombin concentrations are sufficient to trigger robust platelet secretion and aggregation via PAR1 alone (9Kahn M.L. Nakanishi-Matsui M. Shapiro M.J. Ishihara H. Coughlin S.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 879-887Crossref PubMed Scopus (679) Google Scholar). What then, does PAR4 contribute? It is possible that prolonged signaling mediated by PAR4 is important for platelet responses other than secretion and aggregation such as compaction of a loose platelet aggregate into a tight mass and/or fibrin clot retraction. Alternatively, PAR4 may provide a means for platelets to respond to proteases other than thrombin such as cathepsin G (31Sambrano G.R. Huang W. Faruqi T. Mahrus S. Craik C. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6819-6823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this regard, the poor shutoff of PAR4 may represent an adaptation that allows robust signaling even when relatively few receptors are activated by thrombin or another protease. The differences in the kinetics of PAR1 and PAR4 signaling may also relate to differences in the tissue distribution of the two receptors. Thus far, PAR4 is known to function only in platelets, but Northern analysis suggests that it is expressed in other tissues (8Xu W.F. Andersen H. Whitmore T.E. Presnell S.R. Yee D.P. Ching A. Gilbert T. Davie E.W. Foster D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6642-6646Crossref PubMed Scopus (742) Google Scholar). Perhaps PAR4 is expressed only in cell types in which thrombin triggers a sustained change in cellular structure or function. PAR1, however, is expressed in endothelial cells (32Ngaiza J.R.

Finally, the differences in the kinetics of PAR1 and PAR4 signaling may allow thrombin to trigger distinct events, such as specific transcriptional programs, depending on which receptor is activated (35Chin E.R.

Thus the existence of two receptors that signal with distinct kinetics might allow thrombin to elicit distinct responses in cell types that express different receptors or even produce distinct effects in the same cell type depending on thrombin concentration.

Here, we show that the supposedly invariant CF synapse can also express LTD. Brief 5 Hz stimulation of the CF resulted in a sustained depression of CF EPSCs that did not spread to neighboring parallel fiber synapses. Like parallel fiber LTD, CF LTD required postsynaptic Ca2+ elevation, activation of group 1 mGluRs, and activation of PKC. CF LTD is potentially relevant for models of cerebellar motor control and learning and the developmental conversion from multiple to single CF innervation of Purkinje neurons."

VEGF is strongly induced at both the mRNA and protein expression level by a number of hormones and growth factors in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) independently of the oxygen environment. However, the role of HIF-1α in this induction has not been studied. We report here that HIF-1α protein levels are strongly increased by fetal calf serum in quiescent VSMC. More interestingly, Angiotensin II (Ang II), thrombin, platelet-derived growth factor, and other hormones can also increase HIF-1α in VSMC to levels that are substantially more elevated than the hypoxic treatment. HIF-1α induced by Ang II is located in the nucleus, binds to the hypoxic response element, and is transcriptionally active. The induction of HIF-1α by hormones is mediated through the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), since it can be blocked by the ROS inhibitors, diphenyleneiodonium and catalase. Finally, strong induction of VEGF mRNA by Ang II can also be inhibited by these ROS inhibitors. These results implicate HIF-1α and HIF-1-dependent transcriptional activity in the induction of VEGF expression after agonist stimulation and define novel hypoxia-independent mechanisms that should play a major role in vascular remodeling."

The system can be activated through three major pathways: the alternative, the classical, and the lectin pathway. The activation of the alternative pathway (AP)1 is initiated spontaneously and independently of antibodies or specific target structures needed for the classical and the lectin pathways. Consequently, AP attacks biological structures that are not specifically protected against activation (1Schreiber R.D. Pangburn M.K. Lesavre P.H. Müller-Eberhard H.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

AP is continuously activated at a low rate in human plasma. Plasma protein C3, the key component of AP, undergoes slow, spontaneous hydrolysis to C3(H2O) (3Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Exp. Med. 1980; 152: 1102-1114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). This provides a subunit for the initial C3 convertase of AP, C3(H2O)Bb, which cleaves fluid phase C3, generating metastable C3b that can attach covalently to hydroxyl or amine groups on surfaces. After the binding of factor B (fB) and the cleavage of C3b-bound fB by factor D (fD), the actual C3 convertase of AP, C3bBb, is formed. This leads to a progressively increasing deposition of C3b through the formation of new metastable C3b molecules and new C3 convertases (4Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J.

AP activation is regulated in its early step, at the level of C3b and C3bBb, by plasma protein factor H (fH) and by three membrane-bound molecules (CD35, i.e. complement receptor 1; CD46,i.e. membrane cofactor protein; and CD55, i.e.decay-accelerating factor) (8Morgan B.P. Meri S. Springer Semin. Immunopathol. 1994; 15: 369-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). fH regulates AP activation by competing with fB for binding to C3b, by enhancing the dissociation of the C3bBb complex, and by acting as a cofactor for factor I, which leads to the irreversible proteolytic inactivation of C3b (9Whaley K. Ruddy S. J. Exp. Med. 1976; 144: 1147-1163Crossref PubMed Scopus (426) Google Scholar, 10Weiler J.M. Daha M.R. Austen K.F. Fearon D.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Med. 1977; 146: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar). fH is a crucial regulator of AP in plasma because it limits the number of functionally active C3b molecules. In addition, fH is practically the only regulator involved in the protection of self-structures that lack the membrane-bound regulators (e.g. basement membranes in kidney glomeruli) (12Fearon D.T.

This is exemplified by rare cases of fH deficiency in human beings (15Levy M. Halbwachs-Mecarelli L. Gubler M.C. Kohout G. Bensenouci A. Niaudet P. Hauptmann G. Lesavre P.

The ability of AP to discriminate between activating and nonactivating structures depends on the differential binding of fH to C3b on different types of surfaces. The affinity of fH is relatively high for C3b molecules deposited on self-structures (“nonactivators”), whereas C3b on foreign targets (“activators”) has a relatively low affinity for fH, a fact that leads to opsonization and subsequent target damage (5Fearon D.T. Austen K.F. J. Exp. Med. 1975; 142: 856-863Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 21Pangburn M.K. Müller-Eberhard H.J.

Because the non-activating surfaces usually contain negatively charged surface structures (sialic acids and glycosaminoglycans), interactions between fH and polyanions have been intensively characterized. fH has been found to contain two or three binding sites for heparin and/or sialic acid on SCR7, SCR20, and possibly SCR12–14 (23Pangburn M.K. Atkinson M.A. Meri S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16847-16853Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Meri S. Pangburn M.K. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

It has been suggested that these heparin-binding sites have a role in the ability of AP to discriminate between activators and nonactivators; however, the physiological role of these sites is not yet fully understood. To explain the ability of AP to discriminate between self- and nonself-structures, it is essential to characterize the interaction sites between fH and surface-bound C3b. Two sites on C3b are known to be involved in the binding of fH, one on the proteolytic fragment C3d (C3 residues 1178–1252) (29Lambris J.D. Avila D. Becherer J.D. Müller-Eberhard H.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 12147-12150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and another at the amino terminus of the α chain (C3 residues 727–768) (30Becherer J.D. Alsenz J. Esparza I. Hack C.E. Lambris J.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1787-1794Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 31Taniguchi-Sidle A. Isenman D.E. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 5285-5302PubMed Google Scholar, 32Lambris J.D. Lao Z. Oglesby T.J. Atkinson J.P. Hack C.E. Becherer J.D. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4821-4832PubMed Google Scholar). It has been suggested that a total of three C3b-binding sites exist on fH. One has been located to the amino-terminal tryptic fragment (SCR1–6a) (33Alsenz J. Lambris J.D. Schulz T.F. Dierich M.P. Biochem. J. 1984; 224: 389-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 34Hong K. Kinoshita T. Dohi Y. Inoue K. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 647-652PubMed Google Scholar) and further mapped by functional assays to SCRs 1–4 (35Gordon D.L. Kaufman R.M. Blackmore T.K. Kwong J. Lublin D.M. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 348-356PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar, 37Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 2383-2387Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). The other two binding sites have not yet been well characterized. Results obtained by using either several anti-fH mAbs (38Jokiranta T.S. Zipfel P.F. Hakulinen J. Kühn S. Pangburn M.K. Tamerius J.D. Meri S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar) or deletion mutants lacking 5–10 SCR domains (39Sharma A.K. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) showed that there is more than one binding site on fH for C3b. One of the two new sites was localized to SCRs 11–20 (probably 15–20), and it has been suggested that the other new site lies within SCRs 6–10 (39Sharma A.K. Pangburn M.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 10996-11001Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). So far the locations of the reciprocal binding sites on C3b have not been addressed or identified. Because of the central role of AP activation, we analyzed the interactions between C3b and fH. We employed the surface plasmon resonance method for a detailed analysis of the binding sites. This assay monitors real-time changes in the refractive index in the fluid phase close (∼300 nm) to the sensor chip surface (40Cullen D.C. Brown R.G. Lowe C.R. Biosensors. 1987; 3: 211-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar, 41Fagerstam L.G. Frostell A. Karlsson R. Kullman M. Larsson A. Malmqvist M. Butt H. J. Mol. Recognit. 1990; 3: 208-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Surface plasmon resonance has been successfully used for the detection and characterization of interactions between two label-free biomolecules (42Karlsson R. Fält A. J. Immunol. Methods. 1997; 200: 121-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar, 43Pathak S.S. Savelkoul H.F. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 464-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Our specific goals in this study were (i) to verify the existence of the suggested three binding sites for C3b on fH, (ii) to map the location of the binding sites within the fH protein, and (iii) to identify the reciprocal binding sites on C3b. Our results show that fH has at least three binding sites for C3b. Site 1 consists of SCRs 1–5, site 2 is probably within or near SCRs 12–14, and site 3 is within SCRs 19–20. We also localize the corresponding interaction sites to distinct domains of the C3 molecule. fH site 1 binds specifically to intact C3b and is destroyed by the cleavage of C3b to C3c and C3d, site 2 binds to C3c, and site 3 interacts with the C3d region. Multiple reciprocal binding sites explain the complexity of the interactions between these two central complement components. Furthermore, multiple reciprocal binding sites suggest mechanisms that might explain why the C3b-fH interaction is uniquely sensitive to the nature of the surface to which C3b is bound. Trypsin treated with tosylamide phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone and soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor were obtained from Sigma. Soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor was used at the ratio 1:3 (w/w) of trypsin to the inhibitor. C3, fB, fD, and fH were purified from human plasma by the methods previously described (44Sim R.B. Twose T.M. Paterson D.S. Sim E. Biochem. J. 1981; 193: 115-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 45Koistinen V. Wessberg S. Leikola J. Complement Inflamm. 1989; 6: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purity of the proteins was examined by SDS-PAGE and was found to be > 90%. C3b was prepared by purified C3, factor B, factor D, and NiCl2 as described earlier (45Koistinen V. Wessberg S. Leikola J. Complement Inflamm. 1989; 6: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar,46Pangburn M.K. J. Immunol. Methods. 1987; 102: 7-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). C3c was isolated using factor I and its cofactors fH and soluble complement receptor 1 (CR1). Briefly, C3b (1 mg, 1.0 mg/ml) was mixed with factor H (10 μg), factor I (1.0 μg), and soluble CR1 (5.0 μg). The mixture was incubated for 8 h at 37 °C and 15 h at 22 °C with continuous slow shaking. The supernatant was subjected to anion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the fractions containing C3c were pooled (50–400 mm NaCl gradient). Thereafter, the C3c preparation was subjected to affinity chromatography using previously described C3d-specific mAb 4C2 (45Koistinen V. Wessberg S. Leikola J. Complement Inflamm. 1989; 6: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) to eliminate all the C3b fragments that contained parts of the C3d or C3dg regions. Analysis of the C3c preparation by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions showed three bands with apparent molecular masses of 75, 27, and 40 kDa, as expected. No reactivity of the C3c preparation was seen by using anti-C3d mAb 4C2 in the Western blot analysis. C3d was prepared from purified human C3 by a modification of the method of Eggertsen et al. (47Eggertsen G. Hellman U. Lundwall A. Folkersen J. Sjöquist J. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 22: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, C3 at a concentration of 4 mg/ml in veronal-buffered saline (VBS: 5.0 mm barbital and 146 mm NaCl, pH 7.35) was treated with tosylamide phenylethyl chloromethyl ketone-treated trypsin for 2 h at 37 °C at a molar enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:60. The reaction was stopped by addition of soybean trypsin-chymotrypsin inhibitor. C3d was isolated by eluting the trypsinized C3 from a Mono-Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with a 0.1–0.4 m NaCl gradient in 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.3. In accordance with earlier findings (47Eggertsen G. Hellman U. Lundwall A. Folkersen J. Sjöquist J. Mol. Immunol. 1985; 22: 833-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), C3d was eluted in an asymmetrical peak shortly before the major peak. In SDS-PAGE analysis under reducing conditions there was one major band and two minor bands of C3d with apparent molecular masses of 30–35 kDa. The identity of all three bands as C3d was confirmed by their reactivity with the C3d-specific mAb 4C2 in Western blot analysis. SDS-PAGE was performed with a 5–15% gradient minigel under reducing (C3b fragments) or nonreducing (fH constructs) conditions using standard protocols (38Jokiranta T.S. Zipfel P.F. Hakulinen J. Kühn S. Pangburn M.K. Tamerius J.D. Meri S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 48Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). Western blotting was performed after electrotransfer of proteins from SDS-PAGE gels to nitrocellulose (0.2–0.45 μm, Schleicher & Schuell, Dassel, Germany) (49Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44891) Google Scholar). After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA), either monoclonal mouse anti-C3d mAb 4C2 (0.5 μg/ml in 3% BSA) (45Koistinen V. Wessberg S. Leikola J. Complement Inflamm. 1989; 6: 270-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) or polyclonal goat anti-fH IgG (1:2000 in 3% BSA, Incstar Corp., Stillwater, MN) was used as the primary antibody (2 h at 37 °C). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse Ig (1:2000 in 0.1% BSA-phosphate-buffered saline, Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA) or rabbit anti-goat IgG antibody (1:2000 in 0.1% BSA-phosphate-buffered saline, Zymed Laboratories Inc., So. San Francisco, CA), respectively, was used as the secondary antibody. After three washing steps, the bound secondary antibody was detected by adding the standard alkaline phosphatase substrate (38Jokiranta T.S. Zipfel P.F. Hakulinen J. Kühn S. Pangburn M.K. Tamerius J.D. Meri S. FEBS Lett. 1996; 393: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Cloning, expression in the baculovirus system, and purification of most of the used recombinant fragments of fH have been described earlier (27Prodinger W.M. Hellwage J. Spruth M. Dierich M.P. Zipfel P.F. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 41-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 36Kühn S. Skerka C. Zipfel P.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 5663-5670PubMed Google Scholar, 50Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Gene. 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). The additional fragments representing SCR8–11, SCR15–18, and SCR15–20 were generated using the pBSV-8His expression vector (50Kühn S. Zipfel P.F. Gene. 1995; 162: 225-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). For amplification of cDNA fragments of SCRs 8–11, 15–18, and 15–20, sequence-specific primers were used (restriction sites are shown in italics): SCR8 forward, CTG CAG AAA ACA TGT TCC AAA TCA AGT ATA GA; SCR11 reverse, GAA TTC AAT ACA CAC TGG TAA AGT TGT CCA CT; SCR15 forward, CTG CAG GAA AAA ATT CCA TGT TCA CAA CCA CC; SCR18 reverse, GAA TTC TTT GCA TTG AGG TGG TTC CGT CCA GT; SCR20 reverse, CCC GGG TCT TTT TGC ACA AGT TGG ATA CTC CA. All recombinant proteins included a carboxyl-terminal enterokinase cleavage site and an eight-residue histidine tag to allow purification with Ni2+ chelate affinity chromatography. Real-time monitored surface plasmon resonance assays were performed using a Biacore®-2000 instrument, and the data were analyzed using the BiaEvaluation 3.0 software (Biacore AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Carboxylated dextran chips (sensor chip CM5, research grade from Biacore AB) were used in all the assays. Flow cells of the CM5 chips were used either for a standard amine coupling procedure or prepared for the direct enzymatic coupling of C3b by using a standard activation-deactivation procedure without adding any protein between the steps. The activation step was performed with fresh solution containingN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (Biacore AB, 7–15-min injection at a flow rate of 5 μl/min) and was followed by deactivation with ethanolamine-HCl (1.0 m at pH 8.5) (Biacore AB, 7–15-min injection). Hepes-buffered saline (Biagrade, Biacore AB) or 13 VBS was used as the flow buffer throughout. After these initial steps VBS or 13 VBS was used as the continuous flow buffer at 5 μl/min; only degassed buffers were used. C3b, C3c, and C3d were coupled onto the CM5 chip using the standard amine coupling procedure as recommended by the manufacturer. The proteins to be coupled were dialyzed against 10 mm acetate buffer (pH 5.0–5.7) to achieve a negative net charge for the amine coupling. Briefly, the chip surface was activated withN-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (7–15-min injection, 5 μl/min), and either purified C3b (50 μg/ml, 20 μl), C3c (70 μg/ml, 30 μl), or C3d (130 μg/ml, 20 μl) was injected to reach an appropriate level of coupling for the binding experiments, i.e. 5,000–20,000 resonance units (RU). Afterward, the flow cells were deactivated as described above. Before the experiments, the flow cells were washed thoroughly with 13VBS and 3 m NaCl in 10 mm acetate buffer, pH 4.6. To exploit the inherent ability of C3b to bind to surfaces via a thiol group, C3b was coupled to the sensor chip surface by means of an enzymatic coupling procedure. Throughout the enzymatic coupling VBS-Ni2+ (1 mm NiCl2) was used as the continuous flow buffer (5 μl/min flow rate), and the temperature of the chip was adjusted to 30 °C. First, 16.7 μg of freshly purified C3, 2.3 μg of fB, and 0.05 μg of fD were mixed in 50 μl of VBS-Ni2+ at 0 °C and injected into a flow cell. After 2–5 min 50 μl of VBS-Ni2+ containing 2.3 μg of fB and 0.05 μg of fD was injected (fB + fD injection) followed immediately by 50 μl of VBS-Ni2+ containing 16.7 μg of C3 (C3 injection). Thereafter, fB + fD and C3 injections were sequentially repeated five times. Because the whole procedure was performed using real-time monitoring, the amount of injected C3 (100 μg/ml) could be adjusted so as to achieve a final increase of the resonance signal between 5,000 and 10,000 RUs during the last cycle. Usually a total of 60–135 μg of C3 was injected during the procedure. After C3b coupling the flow buffer was changed to 13VBS, and the flow cells were washed for about 2 h with 13VBS and 2–3 m NaCl in acetate buffer, pH 4.6, before performing the binding assays to allow fB and noncovalently bound C3b or C3 to detach from the sensor chip surface. We tested the binding of fH and eight recombinant fragments of fH to amine-coupled C3b, C3c, and C3d, and to C3b that was coupled by the enzymatic method. For Biacore® injections the reagents were dialyzed against 13 VBS, dilssuted with 13 VBS, and filtered (0.20 μm Minisart®, Sartorius Corp., Edgewood, NY) or centrifuged (10 min at 14,000 ×g). The protein concentrations of the dialyzed reagents were measured using the BCA Protein Assay (Pierce). Each ligand was injected separately through a control flow cell (activated and deactivated flow cell without any coupled proteins, “blank channel”) and through the flow cell with the coupled protein using a flow rate of 5 μl/min at 22 °C. The final concentrations (in μm) of the fluid phase ligands in the C3b binding assay (see Fig. 4) were: SCR1–6, 3.1; SCR2–6, 23; SCR8–20, 4.8; SCR8–11, 3.2; SCR15–20, 12; SCR15–18, 15; SCR19–20, 12; fH, 3.6. The concentrations (in μm) of the fluid phase ligands in the C3c/C3d/C3b binding assay (see Fig. 6) were: fH, 3.6–4.7; SCR1–5, 3.6 (25 μm was used to confirm negative binding results); SCR8–20, 4.8–7.9; SCR19–20, 24 (800 μm was used to confirm negative binding results). All the binding assays were performed at least in duplicate using independently prepared sensor chips.Figure 6Binding of fH and recombinant fH fragments to C3b, C3c, and C3d. Standard amine coupling was used to couple purified C3b (A), C3c (B), or C3d (C) (or no protein, for the control blank channel) to the flow cells of a CM5 sensor chip. Purified fH or recombinant fH constructs containing at least one binding site for C3b were injected onto each of the flow cells as indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) In addition to the previously described recombinant fragments of fH, we generated new mutant proteins spanning the middle and carboxyl-terminal parts of fH (constructs containing SCRs 8–11, 15–18, and 15–20) as tools for the fH-C3b interaction studies. All fragments were purified by Ni2+ chelate chromatography. In SDS-PAGE the apparent molecular masses of the fragments were 28 kDa for SCR8–11 and SCR15–18 and 41 kDa for SCR15–20 (Fig.1 A). In Western blotting analysis, polyclonal anti-fH antibodies bound to all the recombinant fragments. The fragments SCR15–18 and SCR15–20 were found to form some homodimers of ∼56 and 82 kDa, respectively (Fig.1 B). To analyze the binding of the different recombinant fragments of fH to fluid phase and surface-bound C3b in the Biacore® instrument, two methods were used to couple C3b onto the sensor chip surface. Firstly, a highly efficient enzymatic method was used, exploiting the ability of nascent C3b to generate a physiological thioester bond. A curve indicating the enzymatic coupling of C3b to hydroxyl groups on a CM5 sensor chip is shown in Fig. 2. Secondly, a standard protocol for the amine coupling of preformed C3b to the CM5 sensor chip was used. In this approach the amount of coupled C3b was found to depend on the activation efficiency and the amount of C3b injected, as expected. A total of eight different recombinant mutant fragments of fH were analyzed for their C3b binding capacity by means of the surface plasmon resonance technique. A schematic representation of the fragments is given in Fig.3. As a positive control we used fH purified from human plasma. Association of the fluid phase ligand was detected by an increase in the number of RUs as a function of time during the injection. Dissociation of the protein complex was followed after the injection. The resonance curves obtained by injecting the ligand into the C3b-coupled flow cell and into the control flow cell were superimposed. The result was considered negative if no increase in the resonance signal was observed in two separate assays using a ligand concentration higher than 80 μg/ml. One of the fH-binding sites for C3b is located in the four most amino-terminal SCR domains (51Schulz T.F. Schwable W. Stanley K.K. Weiss E. Dierich M.P. Eur. J. Immunol. 1986; 16: 1351-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 52Ripoche J. Day A.J. Willis A.C. Belt K.T. Campbell R.D. Sim R.B. Biosci. Rep. 1986; 6: 65-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We used two recombinant fragments of these amino-terminal SCRs to verify the C3b binding with the Biacore® equipment. Fragment SCR1–6 bound to C3b, but fragment SCR2–6 did not (Fig. 4). We also analyzed the binding of five recombinant fragments representing the middle and carboxyl-terminal regions of fH. Fragments SCR8–20, SCR15–20, and SCR19–20 bound to C3b, whereas fragments SCR8–11 and SCR15–18 did not (Fig. 4). Thus the carboxyl-terminal SCRs 19–20 contain one binding site for C3b. Binding of the fH fragments was specific, because none of them bound to the control flow cells (blank channels) (Fig. 4). To map the reciprocal binding sites on C3b the proteolytic fragments C3c and C3d were generated. The generated C3c was found to be free of fragments containing C3d, and the C3d was found to be free of fragments containing C3c as determined by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting (Fig. 5). C3b and its cleavage products C3c and C3d were coupled to the sensor chip surface via amine coupling, and the binding of the various recombinant fH fragments was analyzed. The amounts of C3c and C3d bound to the chip surface were ∼15.9 and ∼12.8 ng/mm2, respectively. fH bound to C3b, C3c, and C3d, whereas the fH constructs containing the amino-terminal C3b-binding site (SCR1–5) bound specifically to intact C3b but not to C3c or C3d (Fig. 6). This indicates that the binding site for the fH SCRs 1–5 was lost on the C3b molecule upon its cleavage to C3c and C3d. The fH constructs containing the carboxyl-terminal C3b-binding site (SCR15–20 and SCR19–20) bound to C3b and C3d but not to C3c. Because SCR8–20 was found to bind to C3b, C3d, and C3c, it is evident that this fH construct contains two C3b-binding sites, one located at the carboxyl terminus and the second in the middle part of the protein. Because the fragment SCR8–11 did not bind to C3b or to its fragments and"

Every cell expresses a large number of SNARE proteins that are localized to particular membrane compartments, suggesting that the fidelity of vesicle trafficking might in part be determined by specific SNARE pairing. However, the promiscuity of SNARE pairing in vitro suggests that the information for membrane compartment organization is not encoded in the inherent ability of SNAREs to form complexes. Here, we show that exocytosis of norepinephrine from PC12 cells is only inhibited or rescued by specific SNAREs. The data suggest that SNARE pairing does underlie vesicle trafficking fidelity, and that specific SNARE interactions with other proteins may facilitate the correct pairing."
https://openalex.org/W2135566980,"The Prx gene in Schwann cells encodes L- and S-periaxin, two abundant PDZ domain proteins thought to have a role in the stabilization of myelin in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). Mice lacking a functional Prx gene assemble compact PNS myelin. However, the sheath is unstable, leading to demyelination and reflex behaviors that are associated with the painful conditions caused by peripheral nerve damage. Older Prx-/- animals display extensive peripheral demyelination and a severe clinical phenotype with mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia, which can be reversed by intrathecal administration of a selective NMDA receptor antagonist We conclude that the periaxins play an essential role in stabilizing the Schwann cell-axon unit and that the periaxin-deficient mouse will be an important model for studying neuropathic pain in late onset demyelinating disease."
https://openalex.org/W1964147273,"The lipoxins (LX) are autacoids that act within a local inflammatory milieu to dampen neutrophil recruitment and promote resolution. 15-Hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) and 15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase, also termed leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase (PGR/LTB4DH), are two enzymatic activities appreciated for their roles in the metabolism of prostaglandins and LTB4. Here, we determined whether these oxidoreductases also catalyze the conversion of lipoxin A4 (LXA4) and assessed the activities of these LXA4 metabolites. 15-Oxo-LXA4 was generated by incubating LXA4 with 15-PGDH and NAD+ for studies of its further conversion. PGR/LTB4DH catalyzed the NADH-dependent reduction of 15-oxo-LXA4 to yield 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4. With NADH as a cofactor, 15-PGDH acted as a 15-carbonyl reductase and catalyzed the conversion of 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4 to 13,14-dihydro-LXA4. Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) exposed to native LXA4, 15-oxo-LXA4, or 13,14-dihydro-LXA4 did not produce superoxide anions. At concentrations where LXA4 and a metabolically stable LXA4 analog potently inhibited leukotriene B4-induced superoxide anion generation, the further metabolites were devoid of activity. Neither 15-oxo-LXA4nor 13,14-dihydro-LXA4 effectively competed with3H-labeled LXA4 for specific binding to recombinant LXA4 receptor (ALXR). In addition, introducing recombinant PGR/LTB4DH into a murine exudative model of inflammation increased PMN number by ∼2-fold, suggesting that this enzyme participates in the regulation of PMN trafficking. These results establish the structures of LXA4 further metabolites and indicate that conversion of LXA4 to oxo- and dihydro- products represents a mode of LXA4 inactivation in inflammation. Moreover, they suggest that these eicosanoid oxidoreductases have multifaceted roles controlling the levels of specific eicosanoids involved in the regulation of inflammation.

Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 373-385Google Scholar). In humans, three main biosynthetic pathways have been elucidated for LX formation, each involving transcellular biosynthetic utilization of intermediates between distinct cell types that are in close proximity with one another during vascular and inflammatory responses (1Serhan C.N. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 373-385Google Scholar). When aspirin is given during inflammation, the aspirin-triggered lipoxins (ATL) are formed via cell-cell interactions involving cells bearing cyclooxygenase II (COX II) that has been acetylated by aspirin and cells that possess 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) (1Serhan C.N. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R. Inflammation: Basic Principles and Clinical Correlates. 3rd Ed. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Philadelphia1999: 373-385Google Scholar). These newly produced ATL may be responsible for some of the beneficial effects of taking aspirin. Results from both in vitro and in vivostudies indicate that LX and ATL possess potent and selective anti-inflammatory activities (1Serhan C.N. Gallin J.I. Snyderman R.

Lipoxin A4 (LXA4) is converted by specific leukocytes of the monocyte/macrophage lineage to 15-oxo-LXA4, 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4, and 13,14-dihydro-LXA4 (3Serhan C.N. Fiore S. Brezinski D.A.

While 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase (15-PGDH) catalyzes the dehydrogenation of the C15 hydroxyl group of LXA4 (C1 = carboxyl carbon, “COOH”) to an oxo- group, to form 15-oxo-LXA4 (4Maddox J.F.

An oxidoreductase that may catalyze the reduction of the 13,14-double bond in 15-oxo-LXA4 to 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4 is 15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase, also termed leukotriene B412-hydroxydehydrogenase (PGR/LTB4DH). Interestingly, this enzyme was cloned independently by several groups (6Yokomizo T. Izumi T. Takahashi T. Kasama T. Kobayashi Y. Sato F. Taketani Y. Shimizu T. J. Biol.

The enzyme from porcine lung (GenBankTMaccession number U87622) was essentially identical to the kidney enzyme (99.7% homology in amino acid sequence), with only a single residue difference, and was isolated and characterized as a 15-oxoprostaglandin 13-reductase in view of its catalytic efficiency for the reduction of the 13,14-carbon-carbon double bond of 15-oxoprostaglandins (7Ensor C.M. Zhang H. Tai H.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). An additional isoform has also been sequenced from rat liver (GenBankTM accession number U66322) and was termed an LTB4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase based on sequence homology to the human kidney enzyme (8Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). This isoform was initially identified in a screen for cancer chemopreventive markers as a novel cytoprotective enzyme induced by dithiolethiones and was termed dithiolethione-inducible gene-1 (DIG-1) (8Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R. Carcinogenesis. 1998; 19: 999-1005Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). The enzyme converts LTB4 to 12-oxo- metabolites that are less active than native LTB4 (8Primiano T. Li Y. Kensler T.W. Trush M.A. Sutter T.R.

In the present work, we employed LC/MS/MS-based analyses to determine whether the isolated recombinant enzymes PGR/LTB4DH and 15-PGDH catalyze the conversion of LXA4 to 15-oxo-LXA4, 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4, and 13,14-dihydro-LXA4 in a series of reactions. We also assessed the impact of selective metabolic transformation on the inhibitory actions of LXA4. Dehydrogenation and reduction essentially inactivates LXA4, giving structures that are less potent and do not effectively compete at the recombinant LXA4 receptor. These LXA4 metabolites lose their functional ability to inhibit PMN responses, and introducing this recombinant enzyme at a site of inflammation enhances PMN infiltration.

Plenum Press, New York1991: 39-52Crossref Google Scholar). Briefly, cells expressing 15-PGDH were grown in 2 liters of Luria-Bertani medium containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C on a rotary shaker (100 rpm) until the culture reached anA 600 of 0.1 absorbance units. The cells were then induced with the addition of isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm) and grown overnight. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 8,000 × g for 15 min, and the cell pellets were resuspended in 20 ml of cold potassium phosphate buffer (40 mm, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol). At 4 °C, the cell pellets were sonicated and then centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatant was applied to a DEAE-Sephacel column (2.5 × 7.5 cm) and eluted using a 400-ml gradient of 40–250 mmpotassium phosphate buffer. 15-PGDH activity in the eluent was assayed spectrophotometrically by measuring NADH formation at 340 nm in a 1-ml reaction mixture consisting of 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 9.0, 0.45 mm NAD+, and 38 μmPGE1. Active fractions were pooled and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. The protein was then applied to a Mono Q column equilibrated with 10 mm imidazole hydrochloride, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol and eluted with a 20-ml gradient of 0.0–0.5 m NaCl. The peak with the highest activity was then rechromatographed over the Mono Q column. Porcine lung PGR/LTB4DH (GenBankTM accession number U87622) was overexpressed in E. coli JM109 harboring a pGBT-T19 vector into which the coding sequence of PGR/LTB4DH had been inserted (7Ensor C.M. Zhang H. Tai H.H. Biochem. J. 1998; 330: 103-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in 700 ml of Luria-Bertani medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C overnight. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 10 min, resuspended in 20 ml of cold potassium phosphate buffer (40 mm, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA), and sonicated. The lysate was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 20 min and the supernatant loaded onto a Cibacron Blue Sepharose column (2.5 x 10 cm) equilibrated with potassium phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.0, 1 mm EDTA). Protein was eluted with a 400-ml gradient of 0.0–1.0 m KCl in equilibration buffer. Fractions were assayed for PGR/LTB4DH activity spectrophotometrically based on the conversion of either 15-oxo-PGE1 or 15-oxo-PGE2, which form alkaline-dependent chromophores with molar extinction coefficients determined to be 15,160m−1 cm−1and 30,300 m−1cm−1, respectively, under the conditions of the assay. To start the reaction, column eluent was added to the reaction mixture. The mixture had a total volume of 1 ml and contained 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4, 1 mm2-mercaptoethanol, 20 μg of 15-oxo-PGE1 or 15-oxo-PGE2, and 1 mm NADH. The reaction was incubated at 37 °C for 10 min and then stopped with 0.25 ml of 2 m NaOH. The most active fractions were pooled and desalted and concentrated by ultrafiltration. For further purification, the enzyme was applied to a Mono Q column and eluted with a 3-ml gradient of 0.0–0.5 m sodium chloride in Tris-HCl (20 mm, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA). LXA4 (5 μg) was incubated with 15-PGDH (2 μg) and NAD+ (1 mm) in 200 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 8.2) for 30 min at 37 °C. An aliquot (1–2 μl) was taken from each incubation for LC/MS/MS-based analyses. The remaining incubation solution was ultrafiltered with a Microcon 10 microconcentrator to remove the enzyme. 15-Oxo-LXA4 was then isolated by RP-HPLC, and this procedure was repeated to produce the quantities of 15-oxo-LXA4 required for further incubations or for activity and binding studies. 15-Oxo-LXA4 was incubated with PGR/LTB4DH (2 μg) in 300 μl of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, containing 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol and 2 mmNADH) for 30 min at 37 °C. The product of this reaction, 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4, was identified and confirmed by LC/MS/MS (see “Results”), and PGR/LTB4DH was then separated from the incubation solution by ultrafiltration. 15-PGDH (2 μg) was added to this solution and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C to yield 13,14-dihydro-LXA4. This product was identified by LC/MS/MS and isolated by RP-HPLC for bioassays (vide infra). Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) results were acquired with an LCQ (Finnigan MAT, San Jose, CA) quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer system equipped with an electrospray ionization probe. Compounds were suspended in mobile phase and injected into the HPLC component, which consisted of a SpectraSYSTEM P4000 (Thermo Separation Products, San Jose, CA) quaternary gradient pump, a LUNA C18-2 (150 × 2 mm, 5 μm) column, and a SpectraSYSTEM UV2000 (Thermo Separation Products, San Jose, CA) ultraviolet/visible (UV-visible) absorbance detector. The column was eluted isocratically with methanol/water/acetic acid (65:34.99:0.01, v/v/v) at 0.2 ml/min into the electrospray probe. Full scan mass spectra (MS) were recorded in the negative ion mode in the range of m/z 330–360. For further identification of the analytes, product ion mass spectra (MS/MS) were obtained for m/z 353 (13,14-dihydro-LXA4), m/z 351 (LXA4and 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4), and m/z 349 (15-oxo-LXA4) (see “Results”). Incubation products were also analyzed employing RP-HPLC with a Hewlett-Packard 1100 Series diode array detector (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA) for on-line identification and documentation of characteristic UV chromophores. The system was equipped with a binary pump and a LUNA C18–2 (150 × 1 mm, 5 μm) microbore HPLC column, and was eluted isocratically with methanol/water/acetic acid (58:41.99:0.01, v/v/v) at 0.1 ml/min. Static UV measurements of isolated materials were obtained at 1-nm resolution using a Hewlett-Packard 8453 diode array UV-visible spectrophotometer (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA). Human PMN were obtained from fresh venous blood obtained by venipuncture from healthy volunteers who had not taken aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (for 2 weeks) and who had given written informed consent to a protocol approved by Brigham and Women's Hospital's Human Research Committee. PMN were isolated by dextran sedimentation followed by gradient centrifugation (11Levy B.D. Gronert K. Clish C.B. Serhan C.N. Laychock S. Rubin R.P.

Briefly, individual incubations were 0.5 ml in total volume (37 °C, pH 7.45) and were done in duplicate for each donor. Cytochrome c (0.06 nm) was added to PMN (1–3.6 × 106 cells/ml) suspensions in Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mm CaCl2and 1 mm MgCl2 (DPBS++). To determine whether the metabolites of LXA4 induce superoxide anion generation, LTB4, LXA4, 15-oxo-LXA4, or 13,14-dihydro-LXA4 (100 nm) was added to the cell suspensions, incubated for 10 min, stopped with placement into an ice bath, and then the absorbance spectrum measured. To determine whether the metabolites of LXA4 inhibit LTB4-induced superoxide anion generation, cell suspensions were preincubated (5 min) with increasing concentrations of LXA4 (1–1,000 nm), 15-epi-16-phenoxy-LXA4, 15-oxo-LXA4 (0.1–1,000 nm), or 13,14-dihydro-LXA4 (0.1–100 nm). LTB4 (100 nm) was then added and incubated for 10 min. The samples were stopped with placement into an ice water bath. Human LXA4 receptor (ALXR) cDNA was used as in Ref. 13Fiore S. Maddox J.F.

Cells were suspended in DPBS++. Aliquots of HEK293 cells (0.5 × 106 cells/ml) were incubated with ∼1 nm of [3H]LXA4 (60,000 cpm, specific activity ∼10 Ci/mmol) in the absence or presence of increasing concentrations of LXA4 (0.1–100 nm), 15-oxo-LXA4 (0.1–100 nm), or 13,14-dihydro-LXA4 (0.1–100 nm) for 30 min at 4 °C. The bound and unbound radioligands were separated by filtration through Whatman GF/C glass filters. Filters were washed three times with 5 ml of ice-cold Tris-HCl buffer (10 mm, pH 7.6). The radioactivity retained on the filter was determined by scintillation counting. Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 3 log order excess of unlabeled LXA4. Dorsal air pouches were raised in male BALB/c mice (6–8 weeks old) that had been anesthetized with isoflurane by injecting 3 ml of sterile air subcutaneously on days 0 and 3 (as in Ref. 14Sin Y.M. Sedgwick A.D. Chea E.P. Willoughby D.A. Ann. Rheum. Dis. 1986; 45: 873-877Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). On day 6, either PGR/LTB4DH (5 μg) in 0.5 ml DPBS− − or enzyme that had been denatured by boiling (100 °C, 15 min) was injected locally into the air pouch. Inflammation in the air pouch was induced by local injection of recombinant murine TNF-α (100 ng) dissolved in 0.5 ml of DPBS− −. Four hours after administration of TNF-α, the air pouches were lavaged three times with 3 ml of DPBS− −. Aspirates were centrifuged at 800 × g for 15 min at 23 °C. The supernatants were removed, and the cells were suspended in 1 ml of DPBS− −. Aliquots of the cell suspension were stained with trypan blue and enumerated by light microscopy. For differential leukocyte counts, 100 μl of the resuspended aspirate cells were added to 100 μl of 30% bovine serum albumin and centrifuged onto microscope slides at 2,200 rpm for 4 min using a Cytofuge (StatSpin, Norwood, MA). The slides were allowed to air dry, and cells were visualized using Wright Giemsa stain. LC/MS/MS-based analyses were employed to determine whether 15-PGDH and PGR/LTB4DH can catalyze, in successive steps, the conversion of LXA4 to oxo- and dihydro-further metabolites. LXA4 eluted from the LC system at 13.3 min and had a molecular anion of 351.5 atomic mass units ([M − H]− = m/z 351.5) (Fig.1). Consistent with earlier findings (5Serhan C.N. Maddox J.F. Petasis N.A. Akritopoulou-Zanze I. Papayianni A. Brady H.R. Colgan S.P. Madara J.L. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 14609-14615Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar), LXA4 was converted to 15-oxo-LXA4 upon incubation with recombinant human 15-PGDH and NAD+. 15-Oxo-LXA4 was produced to assess the role of oxidoreductases in its conversion to oxo- and dihydro-LXA4products, and its MS/MS spectrum is shown for direct comparison to those of the further metabolites (Fig.2). 15-Oxo-LXA4 had a retention time of 11.6 min and a molecular anion of 349.5 atomic mass units ([M − H]− = m/z 349.5) (Fig. 1). The reduction in mass of 2 atomic mass units corresponded to the loss of two hydrogen atoms that occurs with the oxidation of the 15-hydroxyl group to an oxo- group. With prolonged exposure to light, 15-oxo-LXA4 isomerizes to its 11-trans isomer (retention time 10.1 min). 15-Oxo-LXA4 was then isolated and incubated with recombinant PGR/LTB4DH and NADH. The major product of this incubation, 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4, eluted at 12.1 min andm/z 351.5 (Fig. 1). The 2 atomic mass units increase in mass corresponded to the addition of hydrogen across the 13,14-double bond of 15-oxo-LXA4. 13,14-Dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4was isolated and incubated with 15-PGDH, now with NADH as cofactor. The product of this reaction had a retention time of 17.5 min and a molecular anion of 353.5 atomic mass units ([M − H]− = m/z 353.5) (Fig. 1). The mass increase of 2 atomic mass units corresponded to the reduction of the 15-oxo- group of 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4 to the 15-hydroxyl group of 13,14-dihydro-LXA4.Figure 2Conversion of LXA4 to 15-oxo-LXA4. LXA4 was incubated with 15-PGDH as in the legend of Fig. 1 and resulted in the dehydrogenation of the 15-hydroxyl group to an oxo- group. A, 15-oxo-LXA4 was isolated by RP-HPLC, and its absorbance spectrum was determined in methanol (λmax = 347 nm) and was red-shifted compared with the tetraene chromophore of LXA4 (λmax = 300 nm, methanol). B, ESI-MS/MS spectrum of LXA4. The molecular anion of LXA4 ([M − H]− =m/z 351) was further fragmented to yield diagnostic product ions. C, ESI-MS/MS spectrum of 15-oxo-LXA4. The molecular anion of 15-oxo-LXA4 ([M − H]− = m/z 349) fragmented to yield product ions that were 2 atomic mass units lower than their corresponding ions in the LXA4 MS/MS spectrum (see “Results” for further details). Results are representative ofn = 5.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To substantiate their structures, the metabolites of LXA4were isolated by RP-HPLC, and their UV absorbance spectra were measured in methanol. The presence of a conjugated system of four double bonds within its structure affords LXA4 a characteristic tetraene chromophore in its UV absorption spectrum (Fig. 2 A). Conversion of the 15-hydroxyl group of LXA4 by 15-PGDH and NAD+ to the 15-oxo- group in 15-oxo-LXA4 gave a tetraenone chromophore (comprised of a ketone in conjugation with the tetraene). This extension of conjugation lowered the difference in energy between ground and excited electronic states, and consequently the absorption maximum was red-shifted to 347 nm (Fig.2 A). To provide further evidence for the proposed structures of these LXA4 metabolites, the product ion mass spectrum (MS/MS) of each compound was recorded and analyzed for product ion fragmentation. The molecular anion of LXA4 ([M − H]−= m/z 351) fragments in its MS/MS spectrum (Fig.2 B) via: (i) neutral loss of H2O and CO2 to yield the product ions m/z 333 ([M − H]− − H2O), 315 ([M − H]− − 2H2O), 307 ([M − H]− − CO2), 289 ([M − H]− − H2O, − CO2), and 271 ([M − H]− − 2H2O, − CO2); (ii) cleavage of the 14,15 C–C bond to yield the product ion m/z 251 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)4CH3); (iii) neutral loss of H2O and CO2 coupled with the cleavage of the 14,15 C–C bond to yield the product ions m/z 233 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)4CH3, − H2O), 215 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)4CH3, − 2H2O), 207 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)4CH3, − CO2), 189 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)4CH3, − H2O, − CO2), and 171 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)4CH3, − 2H2O, − CO2); and (iv) cleavages of the 5,6 C–C bond to yield the product ions m/z 235 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)3COOH) and m/z 115 (CHO(CH2)3COO−). The molecular anion of 15-oxo-LXA4 ([M − H]− = m/z 349) is 2 atomic mass units lower than that of LXA4, and consequently its corresponding MS/MS product ion masses are reduced by 2 atomic mass units (Fig.2 C). 15-Oxo-LXA4 fragments via: (i) neutral loss of H2O and CO2 to yield the product ionsm/z 331 ([M − H]− − H2O), 313 ([M − H]− − 2H2O), 305 ([M − H]− − CO2), 287 ([M − H]− − H2O, − CO2), 269 ([M − H]− − 2H2O, − CO2); and (ii) cleavages of the 5,6 C–C bond to yield the product ions m/z 233 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)3COOH) and m/z 115 (CHO(CH2)3COO−). Product ions derived from cleavage of the 14,15 C–C bond were of apparently low relative abundance in the MS/MS spectrum of 15-oxo-LXA4. The oxo- group at C15 might impair, relative to other cleavages, the mechanism through which these ions are formed. Incubation of 15-oxo-LXA4 with PGR/LTB4DH and NADH yields 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4, which gave an absorbance maximum at 272 nm in its UV spectrum (Fig.3 A). Reduction of the 13,14-double bond interrupted the tetraenone conjugation and resulted in a triene chromophore and an isolated ketone. The molecular anion ([M − H]− = m/z 351) of 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4 gave fragments in its MS/MS spectrum (Fig. 3 B) consistent with: (i) neutral loss of H2O and CO2 to yield the product ionsm/z 333 ([M − H]− − H2O), 315 ([M − H]− − 2H2O), 307 ([M − H]− − CO2), 289 ([M − H]− − H2O, − CO2), 271 ([M − H]− − 2H2O, − CO2); and (ii) cleavages of the 5,6 C–C bond to yield the product ions m/z 235 ([M − H]− − CHO(CH2)3COOH) and m/z 115 (CHO(CH2)3COO−). Since 13,14-dihydro-15-oxo-LXA4 is 2 atomic mass units higher in mass than 15-oxo-LXA4, its corresponding product ions are 2 atomic mass units larger, with the exception of fragment c′ (Figs.2 C and 3 B), which is not altered upon conversion. In addition, the presence of the oxo- group at C15 appeared to discourage fragmentation of the 14,15 C–C bond as product ions from this cleavage were not abundant. Together, these MS/MS product ions and UV spectra are consistent with the proposed metabolite structure. The ability of PGR/LTB4DH to catalyze either the oxidation of the C15 hydroxyl group of LXA4, with NAD+ as cofactor, or the direct reduction of the 13,14-carbon-carbon double bond, with NADH as cofactor, was also assessed. In either case, LXA4 remained intact, and no appreciable conversion of LXA4 was noted (n = 3). In contrast, incubation of isolated 13,14-dihydro-1"

HeLa cells were arrested in the S phase by thymidine and were enriched in the prometaphase, metaphase, telophase, and G1 phase by collecting at 0, 45, 90, and 180 min after the release from the nocodazole arrest, respectively. The level of GTP-Rho did not change significantly from the S phase to the prometaphase, but increased thereafter, peaking in the telophase, and returned to the original level in the G1phase. The GDP-GTP exchange activity for Rho measured in cell lysates in parallel increased also during the mitosis with a peak in the metaphase. Using this system, we examined a role of ECT2, an exchanger for Rho GTPases, suggested to be involved in cytokinesis (Tatsumoto, T., Xie, X., Blumenthal, R., Okamoto, I., and Miki., T. (1999)J. Cell. Biol., 147, 921–928). Expression of the dominant negative form of ECT2 completely suppressed both the rise of GTP-Rho in the telophase and the increased GDP-GTP exchange activity in the mitotic cell extracts. These results suggest a critical role of ECT2 in Rho activation during cytokinesis. We developed a new pull-down assay for GTP-Rho and examined its level during cell cycle.

Expression of the dominant negative form of ECT2 completely suppressed both the rise of GTP-Rho in the telophase and the increased GDP-GTP exchange activity in the mitotic cell extracts. These results suggest a critical role of ECT2 in Rho activation during cytokinesis. The small GTPase Rho cycles between the GDP-bound inactive form and the GTP-bound active form and works as a switch in several cellular processes including stimulus-induced cell to substrate adhesion, motility, and transcriptional activation (1.Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 2.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). Rho is also involved in cell cycle progression. Treatment of interphase cells with botulinum C3 exoenzyme arrests the cell cycle progression in the G1phase, and, conversely, expression of Val14-Rho stimulates the progression from the G1 to S phase (3.Yamamoto M. Marui N. Sakai T. Morii N. Kozaki S. Ikai K. Imamura S. Narumiya S. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1449-1455PubMed Google Scholar, 4.Olson M.F. Ashworth A. Hall A. Science. 1995; 269: 1270-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (1056) Google Scholar). Another action of Rho in the cell cycle is in cytokinesis. Microinjection of either C3 exoenzyme or Rho guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor into fertilized eggs of sea urchin or Xenopus embryos inhibited cytokinesis without an effect on nuclear division, resulting in production of multinucleate cells (5.Mabuchi I. Hamaguchi Y. Fujimoto H. Morii N. Mishima M. Narumiya S. Zygote. 1993; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 6.Kishi K. Sasaki T. Kuroda S. Itoh T. Takai Y. J.

Biol. 1997; 7: 12-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). Furthermore, treatment with C3 exoenzyme of cells undergoing cleavage induced regression of the cleavage furrow and reversed the cytokinesis (5.Mabuchi I. Hamaguchi Y. Fujimoto H. Morii N. Mishima M. Narumiya S. Zygote. 1993; 1: 325-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that Rho is activated during or after the nuclear division and this activation is required for induction and maintenance of the cytokinesis. The above diverse actions of Rho indicate that activation of Rho occurs in both stimulus- and context-dependent manners. This activation has been analyzed by two ways; one is to identify mechanisms involved in the GDP-GTP exchange of Rho, and the other is to monitor Rho activation by measuring the level of GTP-bound Rho. Exchange of GDP with GTP on Rho is catalyzed by Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). 1The abbreviations used are; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; aa, amino acids; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RBD, Rho-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio[-1-propanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are; GEF, guanine nucleotide exchange factor; aa, amino acids; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; FCS, fetal calf serum; DAPI, 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; RBD, Rho-binding domain; GST, glutathione S-transferase; CHAPS, 3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio[-1-propanesulfonic acid.Several GEFs specific for Rho have already been identified and are characterized by the presence of Dbl homology and pleckstrin homology domains (8.Cerione R.A. Zheng Y. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar). Recently, one of them, p115 Rho-GEF, was found to be stimulated by binding to Gα13 (9.Kozasa T. Jiang X. Hart M.J. Sternweis P.M. Singer W.D. Gilman A.G. Bollag G. Sternweis P.C. Science. 1998; 280: 2109-2111Crossref PubMed Scopus (736) Google Scholar), clarifying one of the stimulus-dependent activation mechanisms of Rho. As for measurement of the level of GTP-Rho, Ren et al. (10.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar) developed a pull-down assay using the RBD of rhotekin, one of the Rho effectors binding selectively to GTP-Rho (11.Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), and showed induction of Rho activation by cell adhesion to fibronectin and its enhancement by serum. Similar pull-down assays have been utilized to assess Rho activation in other stimulus-induced processes (12.Reid T. Bathoorn A. Ahmadian M.R. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33587-33593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13.Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Thus, the stimulus-dependent activation of Rho has been verified by the pull-down assays, and its mechanisms are being clarified. On the other hand, how the level of GTP-Rho is regulated and changes during the cell cycle remains largely unknown. In the present work, we have developed a new pull-down assay for GTP-Rho and measured the level of GTP-Rho during the cell cycle. We have also examined the role of ECT2, a Rho-GEF recently found to be involved in the cytokinesis (14.Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar), in accumulation of GTP-Rho in mitotic cells. pCEV32F-ECT2-F and pCEV32F-ECT2-C were described previously (14.Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). ECT2-N1 and ECT2-N2 were constructed as follows. The region encoding ECT2-N1(aa 1–335) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using 5′-CGGGATCCATGGCTGAAAATAGTGTA-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-CGGGATCCACTGATTTCTTGAGCTCA-3′ as a reverse primer. After amplification, this cDNA fragment was digested withBamHI and subcloned into pBluescript SK(+). After sequencing, this clone was digested with BamHI andEcoRI and cloned into pCEV32F. For construction of ECT2-N2, the ECT2-F was digested by BstEII and self-circularized. pEXV-myc-Val14RhoA and pCMV-myc-Asn19RhoA were described previously (15.Hirose M. Ishzaki T. Watanabe N. Uehata M. Kranenburg O. Moolenaar W.H. Matsumura F. Maekawa M. Bito H. Narumiya S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1625-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). pGEX-3X-RhoA was provided by Y. Takai. pGEX-3X-mouse rhotekin RBD (aa −8 to 89) (11.Reid T. Furuyashiki T. Ishizaki T. Watanabe G. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Morii N. Madaule P. Narumiya S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13556-13560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar), pGEX-4T-1-mouse mDia RBD (aa −2 to 304) (16.Watanabe N. Kato T. Fujita A. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nat. Cell Biol. 1999; 1: 136-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (724) Google Scholar), and pGEX-4T-3-mouse ROCK-II RBD (aa 800–1137) (13.Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar) were described previously. The region encoding mouse citron RBD (aa 1124–1286) cDNA (17.Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using 5′-CGACGTACGAAGAAGCACGCCATGCTGG-3′ as a forward primer and 5′-CGATGCGGCCGCTCACGGGTGGTCCGTGGCTTTGC-3′ as a reverse primer. This fragment was digested with BsiWI andNcoI and cloned into similarly cut pEGFP-C1. This plasmid DNA and pGEX-6P-3 were digested with BamHI andEcoRI and ligated. These pGEX plasmids were introduced inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3)pTrx (18.Chang A.C. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1978; 134: 1141-1156Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and GST fusion proteins were expressed and purified. HeLa cells were cultured to semiconfluence in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS. Cells were trypsinized and 120 of the culture was seeded on a new 10-cm culture dish. After 1 day, cells were synchronized in the S phase with the double-thymidine block method (17.Madaule P. Eda M. Watanabe N. Fujisawa K. Matsuoka T. Bito H. Ishizaki T. Narumiya S. Nature. 1998; 394: 491-494Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). In brief, cells were cultured in DMEM containing 5% FCS and 10 mm thymidine for 15 h, incubated in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS for 9 h, and then cultured again in the thymidine-containing medium for 15 h. In some experiments, we exchanged the medium with serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 3 h in the second thymidine block and transfected cells with pCEV32F plasmids with LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) for 3 h. After transfection, the cells were cultured again in the thymidine-containing medium for another 9 h. Cells synchronized in the S phase were then cultured in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS. After 6 h, nocodazole was added at the final concentration of 40 ng/ml, and the culture was continued for another 6 h. Round mitotic cells were further purified by shake-off procedure. Collected cells were suspended in fresh DMEM containing 10% FCS to release from the nocodazole arrest. At 0, 45, 90, and 180 min after the release, cells were harvested and subjected to analyses. COS-7 cells were transfected with pEXV-myc-Val14RhoA or pCMV-myc-Asn19RhoA with LipofectAMINE as described above. After 24 h, the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline twice before lysis. Cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4,1 mm dithiothreitol, 50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml each of leupeptin and pepstatin and Nonidet P-40 (1% for COS cells and 0.1% for HeLa cells) (lysis buffer). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × gat 4 °C for 20 min, and the supernatants were incubated with 30 μg of GST-RBD fusion conjugated with glutathione beads at 4 °C for 2 h. The beads were washed twice with lysis buffer and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on a 12% gel. Bound RhoA was detected by Western blot using a monoclonal antibody against RhoA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). [3H]GDP-bound RhoA was prepared by incubating 10 pmol of GST-RhoA with 4 μm [3H]GDP (15,000 cpm/pmol) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) containing 10 mm EDTA, 5 mm MgCl2, and 0.24% CHAPS in a total volume of 24 μl for 20 min at 30 °C. One μl of 0.375 m MgCl2 was added to the reaction mixture to stop the reaction. The GDP-GTP exchange activity was assayed by incubating [3H]GDP-bound GST-RhoA and cell lysates as described previously (19.Wada M. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Hirano H. Obaishi H. Matsuura Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 3875-3878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were either cultured on a coverglass (the S-phase cells) or dissociated and attached to a poly-l-lysine-coated coverglass (the mitotic cells). Fixation, permeabilization, and incubation were carried out as described previously (14.Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Monoclonal anti-β-tublin antibody (Sigma) and polyclonal anti-FLAG antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used as primary antibodies at 1/200 dilution, and Alexa FluorTM488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG and Alexa FluorTM488-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes) as secondary antibodies at 1/200 dilution. DAPI was used for staining of the nucleus. Images were obtained using a Zeiss Axiophot fluorescence microscope. We previously identified several Rho effectors including ROCK-I and -II, p140mDia, citron, and rhotekin (1.Narumiya S. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1996; 120: 215-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar, 2.Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2089) Google Scholar). These effectors selectively bind the GTP-bound form of Rho. Among them, the RBD of rhotekin and that of ROCK-II have been used in a pull-down assay for GTP-Rho (10.Ren X.D. Kiosses W.B. Schwartz M.A. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 578-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (1359) Google Scholar, 12.Reid T. Bathoorn A. Ahmadian M.R. Collard J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 33587-33593Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 13.Kranenburg O. Poland M. van Horck F.P. Drechsel D. Hall A. Moolenaar W.H. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1851-1857Crossref PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). To compare their binding potencies with RBDs of other Rho effectors, we expressed the RBD of each effector as a GST fusion protein. Each GST fusion was then incubated with lysates of COS cells expressing Val14-RhoA, and RBD-bound Rho was recovered by precipitation with glutathione beads. As shown in Fig.1 A, only the mDia-RBD could precipitate a significant amount of Val14-RhoA, while the amounts precipitated by other RBDs, including rhotekin, were negligible. Quantitative analysis indicated that about 5% of Val14-Rho expressed in COS cells was precipitated by mDia-RBD under the present assay conditions. The binding of Val14-Rho to mDia-RBD appeared dependent on its GTP-bound state, because no precipitation of Rho was found when COS cell lysates containing Asn19-Rho were subjected to this assay (Fig.1 B). We then used this pull-down assay and examined a change in the level of GTP-Rho during the cell cycle. HeLa cells were synchronized as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and cells arrested in the S phase by thymidine or at 0, 45, 90, and 180 min after the nocodazole release were collected. Analysis of cell morphology (Fig.2 A) indicated that 98% of cells collected at 0 min of the nocodazole release were in prometaphase (panel 2), 85, 10, and 5% of cells collected at 45 min in metaphase, anaphase, and prometaphase, respectively (panel 3), 90% of cells collected at 90 min in telophase (panel 4), and 98% of cells after 180 min in the G1 phase (panel 5). When these cell populations were subjected to the pull-down assay, we detected the significant amount of GTP-Rho in the S-phase cells (Fig. 2 B). The level of GTP-Rho did not significantly change when cells entered the M phase and were arrested in the prometaphase with nocodazole. However, following the nocodazole release, the level of GTP-Rho increased at 45 min in the metaphase and reached the maximum at 90 min in the telophase. It then decreased as the cells entered the G1 phase, but the level at the early G1 phase appeared to be higher than that found in the S phase. These results suggest that RhoA is activated extensively in mitosis. To examine if this activation is due to activation of the GDP-GTP exchange activity, the GEF activity for Rho was examined in lysates of these cells by measuring the rate of [3H]GDP dissociation from RhoA (Fig. 2 C). The GEF activity was low in the lysates of S-phase cells, was significantly enhanced in mitotic cells at 0 min, peaked at 45 min after the nocodazole release in the meta- to anaphase, and slightly decreased at 90 min in the telophase. We next examined the role of ECT2 in the accumulation of GTP-Rho and in the increase in the GEF activity in mitotic cells. ECT2 and itsDrosophila homolog, Pebble, have recently been suggested to be involved in cytokinesis (14.Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar, 20.Prokopenko S.N. Brumby A. O'Keefe L. Prior L. He Y. Saint R. Bellen H.J. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 2301-2314Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). The full-length ECT2 (ECT2-F), and truncated mutants, ECT2-N1, ECT2-N2, and ECT2-C (Fig.3 A) were transiently expressed individually in synchronized cells, and the effects on cytokinesis were examined. While ECT2-F as well as ECT2-C did not show any effect, expression of ECT2-N1 and ECT2-N2 induced the production of multinucleate cells as described previously (14.Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Of the two, ECT2-N1 showed stronger effects, causing about 20% of cells expressing this mutant multinucleate (Fig. 3 B). We then used the pull-down assay and analyzed the level of GTP-Rho in ECT2-N1-expressing cells during mitosis. As shown in Fig. 3 C, the accumulation of GTP-Rho at 90 min after the nocodazole release was almost completely abolished by this expression. On the other hand, the level of GTP-Rho at 0 and 180 min did not change from the control cells. Consistent with this finding, the activity of GDP-GTP exchange for Rho was comparable between the control and ECT2-N1-expressing cells at 0 min after the nocodazole release, but its increase at 45 and 90 min was suppressed by ECT2-N1 expression (Fig. 3 D). A previous study (14.Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) showed that phosphorylation of ECT2 occurs in mitosis and that this phosphorylation activates the exchange activity of this molecule. To examine whether expressed ECT2-N1 suppressed the ECT2 phosphorylation, we probed lysates of control cells and cells expressing ECT2-N1 with anti-ECT2 antibodies. Expression of ECT2-N1 affected neither the level of endogenous ECT2 nor its phosphorylation upon the entry of cells to the M phase (Fig. 4). The mobility shift of ECT2 was already found in the prometaphase (at 0 min) and continued to be present at 45 min but, interestingly, was not seen at 90 min.Figure 4Effects of ECT2-N1 expression on phosphorylation of endogenous ECT2. HeLa cells with or without ECT2-N1 transfection were collected and subjected to the Western blot analysis with anti-ECT2 antibody as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Phosphorylation of ECT2 was assessed by the mobility shift on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis on an 8% gel.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In this work, we used the pull-down assay and revealed the extensive accumulation of GTP-Rho during the mitosis. Our assay to pull down GTP-Rho uses the RBD of mDia. We compared potencies of RBDs of several Rho effectors for precipitating GTP-Rho from the same cell lysates and found that the precipitation by mDia-RBD was most sensitive and reproducible under our assay conditions. One RBD that was not tested in this study is the C terminus of phospholipase D1. This domain was also found to pull down GTP-Rho in vitro, although, unlike mDia, it appears to be able to interact with other members of Rho GTPases (21.Yamazaki M. Zhang Y. Watanabe H. Yokozeki T. Ohno S. Kaibuchi K. Shibata H. Mukai H. Ono Y. Forhman M.A. Kanaho Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 6035-6038Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Using the mDia assay, we found that the level of GTP-Rho increased from the metaphase and peaked at the telophase. This time course is consistent with the suggested action of Rho to induce and maintain the cytokinesis. Compared with this accumulation, the levels of GTP-Rho in the G1 and S phase were relatively low, suggesting that the actions of Rho in these phases are mediated by relatively small populations of GTP-Rho generated transiently and locally at its site of actions. We did not see the complete loss of GTP-Rho in the transition of the S to M phase. This result may suggest that cell rounding associated with the entry to the M phase is not regulated by the level of GTP-Rho. Consistent with the above findings, we found the increased Rho-GEF activity in lysates of cells in the M phase. However, this increase did not parallel with the GTP-Rho accumulation, but preceded it. This discrepancy raises several possibilities. One is that the catalytic activation and the action in the cell of GEF may occur at consecutive but separate steps, the latter being, for example, regulated by intracellular targeting. It may also well be that the high level of GTP-Rho is caused by down-regulation of GTPase-activating protein activity. Another interesting possibility is that GTP-Rho generated during mitosis binds to Rho effectors involved in cytokinesis and are stabilized by this binding. In this case, GTP-Rho may work as a structural component. The presence of Rho in the contractile ring and in the midbody was already reported (22.Takaishi K. Sasaki T. Kameyama T. Tsukita S. Takai Y. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 39-48PubMed Google Scholar, 23.Nishimura Y. Nakano K. Mabuchi I. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 121-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Finally, we found that the expression of a dominant negative ECT2 almost completely inhibited the increase of the Rho-GEF activity in mitosis and suppressed the GTP-Rho accumulation in the telophase. These results suggest that ECT2 is a main GEF working in this process. These effects of ECT2-N1 appear surprising, given that this expression caused only 20% of the total cell population multinucleate. However, this percentage was seen after the cell division, indicating that about 40% of cells failed to divide. We further found that the number of mutinucleate cells increased on subsequent divisions. These findings suggest that most of transfected cells expressed this mutant protein to some extent. Notably, the GTP-Rho level at 0 and 180 min was not different between the control and ECT2-N1 expressing cell populations, indicating that the generation of GTP-Rho in these phases is carried out by GEF(s) different from ECT2. Tatsumoto et al. (14.Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) previously found the M-phase-associated phosphorylation of ECT2 and reported the activation of its exchange activity by phosphorylation. We confirmed it in this work. We further found that the phosphorylation was almost complete in the prometaphase (at 0 min), when little accumulation of GTP-Rho was found. This may imply that in order for ECT2 to act as a Rho-GEF in the cell, an additional step is required after the phosphorylation, as discussed above. This possibility is suggested also by the experiment with a dominant negative ECT2-N1, of which expression did not have any effect on the phosphorylation. It is interesting in this respect to test whether the expression of ECT2-N1 affects the localization of endogenous ECT2 during mitosis. ECT2-N1 was localized in the midbody in weakly expressing cells as did endogenous ECT2 (14.Tatsumoto T. Xie X. Blumenthal R. Okamoto I. Miki T. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 921-928Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) (data not shown). An additional finding in the phosphorylation experiment is that the phosphorylation disappeared in cells in the telophase at 90 min after the nocodazole release, a time at which the extensive accumulation of GTP-Rho was observed. This may suggest again a possibility of the binding and stabilization of GTP-Rho in the contractile ring. Another possibility is that binding of some component(s) to ECT2 during the mitosis activates its exchange activity without phosphorylation. Alternatively, ECT2 may trigger the cascade of exchanger activation. These issues should be clarified in future studies. We thank K. Fujisawa, T. Ishizaki, N. Watanabe, and M. Maekawa for helpful discussions and T. Arai and H. Nose for secretarial assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1965248892,"Orphanin FQ/nociceptin (OFQ/N) and its receptor share substantial structural features and cellular actions with classic opioid peptides and receptors, but have distinct pharmacological profiles and behavioral effects. Currently there is an active debate about whether OFQ/N produces hyperalgesia or analgesia. Using a well-defined brainstem pain-modulating circuit, we show that OFQ/N can cause either an apparent hyperalgesia by antagonizing mu opioid-induced analgesia or a net analgesic effect by reducing the hyperalgesia during opioid abstinence. It presumably produces these two opposite actions by inhibiting two distinct groups of neurons whose activation mediates the two effects of opioid administration. OFQ/N antagonism of the hyperalgesia may have significance for the treatment of opioid withdrawal and sensitized pain."
https://openalex.org/W2059288996,"The mutation timeless(UL) generates 33 hr rhythms, prolonged nuclear localization of PERIOD/TIMELESS(UL) protein complexes, and protracted derepression of period (per) and timeless (tim) transcription. Light-induced elimination of TIM(UL) from nuclear PER/TIM(UL) complexes gives strong downregulation of per and tim expression. Thus, in the absence of TIM, nuclear PER can function as a potent negative transcriptional regulator. Two additional studies support this role for PER: (1) Drosophila expressing PER that constitutively localizes to nuclei produce dominant behavioral arrhythmicity, and (2) constitutively nuclear PER represses dCLOCK/CYCLE-mediated transcription of per in cultured cells without TIM. Conversion of PER/TIM heterodimers to nuclear PER proteins appears to be required to complete transcriptional repression and terminate each circadian molecular cycle."

Allikmets R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Mitochondria provide cells with energy for many biological functions by oxidative phosphorylation. Reactive oxygen species are by-products of respiration. Their interaction with free iron in mitochondria through the Fenton reaction could lead to oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA in mitochondria (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12.Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar), suggesting that iron homeostasis is crucial in the maintenance of mitochondrial function. Atm1p was the first member of the ABC protein family identified in mitochondria (7.Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), and it plays an important role in normal cellular growth and iron homeostasis (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen.

Further analysis of Atm1p has shown that it transports the precursor of the Fe/S cluster from mitochondria to the cytosol (14.Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar). Because mutation of ATM1 results in mitochondrial dysfunction (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), mutations of human mitochondrial ABC proteins could be associated with various diseases. Although the complete genomic sequences of Saccharomyces cerevisiae andEscherichia coli predict the existence of 29 and 79 members of the ABC protein family, respectively (15.Linton K.J. Higgins C.F. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 5-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 16.Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar), only a few mitochondrial ABC proteins have been identified to date. In the course of our search for human ABC proteins in the mitochondria, two mitochondrial ABC proteins were reported by other laboratories: ABC7, an ortholog of Atm1p (17.Csere P. Lill R. Kispal G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and M-ABC1, the function of which is not known (18.Hogue D.L. Liu L. Ling V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). A mutation of the human ABC7 gene has been shown responsible for X-linked sideroblastic anemia and ataxia (XLSA/A) (19.Allikmets R. Raskind W.H. Hutchinson A. Schueck N.D. Dean M. Koeller D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Here, we report a third human mitochondrial ABC protein, designated MTABC3. MTABC3 has 31.1% identity to Atm1p and is shown to be involved in iron homeostasis and to play an important role in mitochondrial functions such as maintenance of respiratory function and mitochondrial DNA. The human MTABC3 gene has 19 exons in the protein-coding region and has been mapped to chromosome 2q36. Because the locus for lethal neonatal metabolic syndrome, a disorder of mitochondrial function associated with iron metabolism (20.Fellman V. Rapola J. Pihko H. Varilo T. Raivio K.O.

The human EST data base at the National Center for Biotechnology Information was screened with a partial nucleotide sequence of ATM1 as a probe. As a result, two human cDNAs encoding an ABC protein (ABC7) and an ABC transporter-like protein (EST 45597) were found. A partial cDNA fragment of EST 45597 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a human liver cDNA as a template. The sense and antisense primers used were 5′-TTC ACT GTG ATG CCT GGA CA-3′ and 5′-GAT GCA GCC ATC CTT GAT GA-3′. PCR was performed for 40 cycles under the following conditions: denaturation for 30 s at 94 °C, annealing for 1 min at 58 °C, and extension for 1 min at 72 °C in a thermal cycler GeneAmp PCR system 9600 (PE Biosystems). The PCR product was subcloned into pGEM-T Easy vectors (Promega) and used as a probe for screening a human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH). Using a32P nick-translated probe, approximately 1.2 × 106 plaques were screened under highly stringent conditions. The positive clones were subcloned into plasmid vectors pGEM-3Z (Promega) and sequenced in both directions using ABI autosequencer (ABI PRISMTM). The deduced full-length protein was designated MTABC3. Total RNAs were purified from various freshly isolated tissues of adult Wistar rats and cell lines by the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol extraction method (22.Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62899) Google Scholar). For RNA transfer blot, 10 μg of total RNA from the various tissues or cells were denatured with formaldehyde, electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel, and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N+, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). RNA blot analysis was also carried out with the Human Multiple Tissue Northern blot system (CLONTECH), according to the manufacturer's protocol. The blots were probed with a 32P nick-translated 580-base pairs (bp) human MTABC3 fragment. Hybridizations were carried out under the standard conditions. The nylon membranes were washed in 0.1× SSC and 0.1% SDS at 50 °C for 1 h and exposed to x-ray films at −80 °C for 72 h. FLAG-tag was attached at the 3′ end of human MTABC3 cDNA in the pcDNA 3.1(−) vector (Invitrogen). The resultant plasmid vector was transfected into CHO cells by electroporation at 950 microfarads and 0.232 kV/cm. The cells were cultured in αMEM medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 400 μg/ml of Geneticin for 2 weeks. Ninety-six Geneticin-resistant cells were isolated and screened by genomic PCR and RNA and protein blot analyses. Discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation of CHO cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged MTABC3 was performed with slight modifications (23.Wendland B. Scheller R.H. Mol. Endocrinol. 1994; 8: 1070-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Postnuclear supernatant (1 ml) was applied to the top of the sucrose gradients (11 ml) and centrifuged at 55,000 × g for 2 h at 4 °C. Each fraction (1 ml) was collected from the top fraction (fraction 1) to the bottom fraction (fraction 12). Each postnuclear fraction containing 2–20 μg of protein was precipitated with 15% trichloroacetate, separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and subjected to immunoblot analysis. Immunofluorescence staining of CHO cells expressing FLAG-tagged MTABC3 was performed on collagen-coated coverslips. The cells were incubated for 30 min at 37 °C with 25 nmMitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) in complete medium, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Immunoreactivity of MTABC3 was detected with anti-FLAG antibody (Kodak) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories, Inc). Coverslips were mounted on glass slides using PermaFluor (Lipshaw) and examined using a Zeiss fluorescence microscope. The following S. cerevisiae strains were used in this study: YM13-1c (MATα ade5 leu2 ura3 trp1 atm1-1 (ρ+ ω+chl321R)), CG378 ρ0 (MATα ade5 leu2 ura3 trp1 can1 (ρ0)), and IL166–187 (MATα his1 trp1 can1 (ρ+ ω+chl321R)), as described previously (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were grown in medium consisting of 1% yeast extract, 2% Bacto peptone (Difco), and 2% glucose (YPD) or 3% glycerol (YPGly). For selective growth, yeasts were cultured in a medium of 0.67% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 0.077% CSM URA (BIO101), and 3% glycerol (SCGly). Solid media were prepared by adding 2% Bacto agar (Difco) to the liquid media described above. The Walker A-encoding region of MTABC3 cDNA was mutated by a PCR-based method using oligonucleotides bearing mismatched bases at the residues to be mutated (5′-CCA TCT GGG GCA GCG AGG AGC ACA ATT TTG-3′ and 5′-CAA AAT TGT GCT CCT CGC TGC CCC AGA TGG-3′ for G628A and K629R, respectively) in combination with oligonucleotides (5′-GTT ACC AGT TAC GTC TTC CT-3′ and 5′-TCT TTG AGA GGG AAG TGG CC-3′) (24.Higuchi R. Krummel B. Saiki R.K. Nucleic Acids Res. 1988; 16: 7351-7367Crossref PubMed Scopus (2080) Google Scholar). Expression of the Atm1p, MTABC3, or MTABC3 double mutants was achieved by transforming YM13-1c cells with the multicopy plasmid pYES2 under control of the GAL1 promoter (25.Ito H. Fukuda Y. Murata K. Kimura A. J. Bacteriol. 1983; 153: 163-168Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Isolation of yeast mitochondria and mitochondrial DNA have been described previously (26.Daum G. Bohni P.C. Schatz G. J.

Bäckström D. Ehrenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 589: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The presence of mitochondrial DNA and genomic DNA was assessed by Southern blot analysis using whole mitochondrial DNA and Leu2 (β-isopropyl malate dehydrogenase) cDNA as probe, respectively (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Mitochondrial respiratory function was assessed by spontaneous petite formation (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Approximately 5 × 105 cells cultured in SCGly were inoculated into 5 ml of YPD medium, and the cells were incubated at 30 °C with vigorous shaking for 48 h. Aliquots of the culture were withdrawn and spread on YPGly or YPD plates at the indicated times (Fig. 4 C). The rate of maintenance of mitochondrial respiratory function was calculated by dividing the number of colonies on YPGly plates by the number of colonies on YPD plates (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). To clone the humanMTABC3 gene, a partial human liver cDNA fragment of MTABC3 (nt 1764-nt 2407) was used as a probe for screening a λ FIX II human lymphocyte genomic library. Using a 32P nick-translated probe, approximately 0.9 × 106plaques were screened under highly stringent conditions. Two positive clones were subcloned into plasmid vectors pGEM-3Z (Promega) and sequenced using an ABI autosequencer (ABI PRISMTM). Exon-intron boundaries were determined by a comparison of genomic and cDNA sequences. Intron sizes were determined by sequencing or PCR amplification. The human chromosomal location of MTABC3 was determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping. Metaphase spreads were prepared from phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes of a normal male. The MTABC3 genomic fragment (20 kbp) was labeled with biotin-14-dATP and used as a probe. Slide denaturation, hybridization, and washings were performed essentially as described previously (29.Takahashi E. Hori T. O'Connell P. Leppert M. White R. Hum Genet. 1990; 86: 14-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Chromosomes were counter-stained with propidium iodide and 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. Radiation hybrid mapping was performed using the Stanford G3 RH panel (Research Genetics) with two independent sets of primers: RH upst-1 (5′-ACA AGG CTT CTT GTG TAT TC-3′) and RH downst-1 (5′-CGA GGA CTG GTC AGC ATT GA-3′); RH upst-2 (5′-AGA CTC TGC AGG ACG TGT CT-3′) and RH downst-2 (5′-ACC TAA GCT TCC AAA GTG CT-3′). The results obtained with these two sets of primers were consistent and were sent to the Stanford Human Genome Center for mapping of the gene relative to the RH map of the human genome. In searching for a human ortholog of Atm1p, we screened the GenBankTM data base using the BLAST program (30.Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (68351) Google Scholar) in human ESTs, and found two ABC proteins: one identical to ABC7 (31.Savary S. Allikmets R. Denizot F. Luciani Marie-Françoise Mattei Marie-Genevière Dean M. Chimini G. Genomics. 1997; 41: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and another, EST 45597. Using a partial EST 45597 as probe, a human liver cDNA library (CLONTECH) was screened. Eight of the 26 positive λ clones were sequenced. The composite nucleotide sequence of 2526 bp contains a single open reading frame following an in-frame termination signal upstream of the ATG, which encodes a protein of 842 amino acids with a molecular mass of 93.9 kDa that has 31.1% identity to Atm1p (Fig. 1).

Genomics. 1992; 14: 897-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (1364) Google Scholar) reveals that MTABC3 has a single transmembrane domain composed of eight putative membrane-spanning regions. A domain search with the Pfam program (33.Bateman A. Birney E. Durbin R. Eddy S.R. Finn R.D. Sonnhammer E.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 260-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar) reveals the presence of a nucleotide binding fold (NBF) containing the conserved Walker A and B motifs and an ABC signature. A comparison of amino acid sequences between MTABC3 and other half-type ABC proteins shows that MTABC3 has 37.4 and 34.1% amino acid identity (47.5 and 42.9% similarity) to Schizosaccharomyces pombe Hmt1p (5.Oritz D.F. Kreppel L. Speiser D.M. Scheel G. McDonald G. Ow D.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 3491-3499Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar) and human ABC7 (34.Shimada Y. Okuno S. Kawai A. Shinomiya H. Saito A. Suzuki M. Omori Y. Nishino N. Kanemoto N. Fujiwara T. Horie M. Takahashi E. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 43: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), respectively, indicating that MTABC3 represents a new member of the half-type ABC protein subfamily. Northern blot analysis revealed that human MTABC3 cDNA hybridized to the major transcript of ∼3.4 kb expressed widely in rat tissues and various cell lines and at high levels in the testis, kidney, and cerebellum (Fig. 2 A). In addition to the ∼3.4-kb transcript, a transcript of ∼4.0 kb was also detected in many tissues and at high levels in cerebellum. On the other hand, only a single transcript (∼3.4 kb) of MTABC3 was detected in all of the human tissues examined, and it is expressed at high levels in the heart and skeletal muscles (Fig. 2 B). Because half-type ABC proteins are generally known to be present in intracellular organelle, we examined the subcellular localization of MTABC3. For this purpose, we established CHO cells stably expressing FLAG-tagged human MTABC3. The single immunoreactive protein MTABC3 was detected as an 80-kDa protein in fractions 9–12, peaking at fraction 10, which coincides with the major fraction of cytochrome coxidase subunit IV (COX IV), a molecular marker for mitochondrial fractions (Fig. 2 C). In contrast, Na/K-ATPase subunit α, a molecular marker of microsomal fractions, is present in fractions 5–11, peaking at fractions 6 and 7. To confirm that MTABC3 is present in the mitochondria, CHO cells expressing MTABC3 were stained with anti-FLAG antibody and MitoTracker Red CMXRos, a stain specific for mitochondria (35.Chen Q. Lin Reigh-Yi Rubin C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15247-15257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and observed under confocal laser microscopy. Immunostaining of MTABC3 revealed that it is precisely co-localized with granular worm-like mitochondrial structures (Fig. 2 D). Immuocytochemistry at the electron microscopic level confirmed that MTABC3 is found at the mitochondrial membrane (data not shown). The role of MTABC3 in the mitochondrial function was then investigated. In previous studies, functional analyses of Atm1p and ABC7 were performed using an ATM1 disruptant that is completely defective in ATM1 function (13.Kispal G. Csere P. Guiard B. Lill R. FEBS Lett. 1997; 418: 346-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar, 17.Csere P. Lill R. Kispal G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In the present study, we used atm1-1mutant cells that are partially defective in Atm1p function (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Theatm1-1 mutant cells showed a 50-fold higher level of free iron accumulation relative to that found in the mitochondria of wild-type yeast cells, mitochondrial genome instability, and loss of mitochondrial respiratory function when grown on YPD medium for 24 h (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We then investigated whether these phenotypic alterations ofatm1-1 mutant cells could be reversed by introducing MTABC3 into atm1-1 mutant cells. The mitochondria were purified, and their iron content was determined (Fig.3 A). The amount of free iron in mitochondria of atm1-1 mutant cells in which the control plasmid (pYES2) alone was introduced was 30.02 ± 3.96 nmol/mg mitochondrial protein (Mtp). On the other hand, the amount of free iron in the mitochondria of atm1-1 mutant cells transformed with Atm1p or MTABC3 was 11.88 ± 0.91 or 11.34 ± 0.72 nmol/mg Mtp, respectively, with both values approximately one-third of the value found in atm1-1 mutant cells. To determine whether the compensation is specific to MTABC3 function, we examined the effect of the MTABC3 mutant on free iron content in mitochondria. Mutations of the glycine (G) and lysine (K) residues within the Walker A motif, the residues that interact with ATP, have been shown to abolish or impair the function of many ABC proteins, including CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), MDR1 (multidrug resistance protein-1), SUR1 (sulfonylurea receptor protein-1), and STE6 (sterile 6, a-factor mating pheromone transporter) (36.Anderson P.A. Welsh M.J. Science. 1992; 257: 1701-1704Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 37.Azzaria M. Schurr E. Gros P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5289-5297Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar, 38.Gribble, F. M., Tucker, S. J., and Ashcroft, F. M. EMBO J. 16, 1145–1152Google Scholar, 39.Berkower C. Michaelis S. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 3777-3785Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), indicating that these residues are critical for the functional expression of ABC proteins. We then mutated the Walker A motif, GPSGAGKST of MTABC3 to GPSGAARST, and the resultant double mutant, MTABC3 (G628A, K629R), was introduced into atm1-1 mutant cells. As expected, the compensatory effect of the double mutant (18.05 ± 1.73 nmol/mg Mtp) was significantly reduced compared with that of wild-type MTABC3 (11.34 ± 0.72 nmol/mg Mtp,p < 0.05), indicating that the effect is specific for MTABC3. Thus, as does Atm1p, MTABC3 may transport Fe/S clusters from mitochondria to cytosol. It has been shown that mitochondrial iron accumulation causes damage to mitochondrial DNA (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12.Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar). To assess this damage, Southern blot analysis of mitochondrial DNA was carried out (Fig. 3 B). There is little mitochondrial DNA in atm1-1 mutant cells transformed with the pYES2 vector alone, whereas the amount of mitochondrial DNA in atm1-1 mutant cells transformed with Atm1p or MTABC3 is similar to the level in wild-type yeast cells. Oxidative stress impairs various mitochondrial functions, including the respiratory function (40.Del Maestro R.F. Acta Physiol. Scand. Suppl. 1980; 492: 153-168PubMed Google Scholar, 41.Ames B.N. Shigenaga M.K. Hagen T.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7915-7922Crossref PubMed Scopus (5354) Google Scholar). The respiratory function has been shown to be severely impaired in atm1-1 mutant cells as assessed by petite formation (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). We tested whether respiratory function could be maintained in atm1-1 mutant cells transformed with MTABC3 (Fig. 3 C). Only 10% of atm1-1 mutant cells transformed with control plasmid (pYES2) grown on YPD medium for 48 h maintained mitochondrial respiratory function. In contrast, 80% of the Atm1p or MTABC3 transformed cells maintained respiratory function under the same culture conditions. In addition, only 30% ofatm1-1 mutant cells transformed with the double mutant MTABC3 (G628A, K629R) maintained respiratory function. We have identified a novel human ABC protein present in the mitochondria, designated MTABC3. Atm1p, which was identified inS. cerevisiae, was the first member of the ABC protein family to be found in mitochondria (7.Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Atm1p is located in the mitochondrial inner membrane and functions as an exporter of Fe/S clusters (14.Kispal G. Csere P. Prohl C. Lill R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3981-3989Crossref PubMed Scopus (577) Google Scholar), suggesting that Atm1p could play a critical role in iron homeostasis in mitochondria. ABC7 and M-ABC1, two other human ABC proteins present in the mitochondria, have recently been reported (17.Csere P. Lill R. Kispal G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 266-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar,18.Hogue D.L. Liu L. Ling V. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 379-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). ABC7 has been shown to be involved in iron homeostasis, but the functional role of M-ABC1 is not known. Because there is 31% amino acid identity between human MTABC3 and yeast Atm1p, human MTABC3 could be a functional ortholog of yeast Atm1p. In atm1-1 mutant cells (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), there is accumulation of free iron in the mitochondria, mitochondrial DNA damage, and respiratory dysfunction. To investigate the functional roles of MTABC3, we transformed atm1-1 mutant cells with human MTABC3. We found that all the phenotypic consequences in atm1-1 mutant cells can be reversed by the expression of human MTABC3 in the cells, supporting the possibility that MTABC3 is a functional ortholog of Atm1p. Interestingly, although the iron accumulation is only partially reversed (Fig. 3 A), the damage of mitochondrial DNA (Fig. 3 B) is almost fully reversed by the double mutant MTABC3 (G628A, K629R) inatm1-1 mutant cells. This indicates that the degree of mitochondrial DNA damage does not parallel the accumulation of iron in the mitochondria, suggesting that the mitochondrial DNA damage is a defect secondary to the oxidative damage caused by the accumulation of iron in the mitochondria (11.Senbongi H. Ling F. Shibata T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1999; 262: 426-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 12.Stohs S.J. Bagchi D. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1995; 18: 321-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (3480) Google Scholar). ABC7 and MTABC3 can both substitute for Atm1p in yeast. However, XLSA/A is caused by a mutation of theABC7 gene alone (19.Allikmets R. Raskind W.H. Hutchinson A. Schueck N.D. Dean M. Koeller D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), indicating that MTABC3 cannot substitute for ABC7 and that the function of MTABC3 is different from that of ABC7. Although all characterized half-type ABC proteins function as dimers, it is not known at present whether MTABC3 functions as a homodimer or a heterodimer with ABC7 or unidentified half-type ABC proteins. MTABC3 has only one NBF, indicating that, like Atm1p and ABC7, it belongs to the half-type ABC protein subfamily. It has been suggested that both Atm1p and ABC7 have six putative membrane-spanning regions, with the NBF of both proteins located in the matrix of the mitochondria (7.Leighton J. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar, 16.Decottignies A. Goffeau A. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 137-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Considering the functional similarity between ABC7 and MTABC3, the NBF of MTABC3 may also be located in the matrix of the mitochondria. Although hydropathy analysis using the PSORT program (28.Tangerås A. Flatmark T. Bäckström D. Ehrenberg A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1980; 589: 162-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar) suggests the presence of eight putative membrane-spanning regions in MTABC3, the details of membrane topology must await further biochemical analysis. All of the ABC proteins identified to date in the intracellular organelle of mammalian cells are half-type ABC proteins (1.Higgins C.F. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1992; 8: 67-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (3323) Google Scholar, 10.Dean M. Allikmets R. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1995; 5: 779-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 17.Csere P.

Mutations of ABC proteins are known to cause many disorders, including cystic fibrosis, persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, and adrenoleukodystrophy (3.Riordan J.R. Rommens J.M. Kerem Bat-Sheva Alon N. Rozmahel R. Grzelczak Z. Zielenski J. Lok S. Plavsic N. Chou Jia-Ling Drumm M.L. Iannuzzi M.C. Collins F.S. Tsui L.-C.

Nature. 1993; 361: 726-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (981) Google Scholar). Like a mutation of theABC7 gene in XLSA/A (19.Allikmets R. Raskind W.H. Hutchinson A. Schueck N.D. Dean M. Koeller D.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 743-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), mutations of MTABC3 might also be associated with disorders of iron metabolism. As a first step in determining the role of the MTABC3 gene in the development of genetic disorders, we cloned the human MTABC3 gene and determined the exon/intron boundaries (available as supplementary information in the on-line version of this article). The humanMTABC3 gene spans ∼11 kbp and has 19 exons in the protein-coding region (Fig.4 A). Fluorescence in situ hybridization reveals that the human MTABC3 gene is located at chromosome 2q36 (Fig. 4 B). Radiation hybrid mapping further narrows the region to between D2S1297 and SHGC-32531 (Fig. 4 C). Interestingly, lethal neonatal metabolic syndrome, a disorder of mitochondrial function associated with iron metabolism, has been mapped between D2S164 and D2S163 (20.Fellman V. Rapola J. Pihko H. Varilo T. Raivio K.O. Lancet. 1998; 351: 490-493Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 21.Visapää I. Fellman V. Varilo T. Palotie A. Raivio K.O. Peltonen L. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1998; 63: 1396-1403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Thus, the human MTABC3 gene is a strong candidate for the causal gene in this disorder. Cloning of the human MTABC3 cDNA and gene and its functional characterization should facilitate studies of its roles in mitochondrial function as well as in the development of lethal neonatal metabolic syndrome.

Mutation analysis in PEX12 of Chinese hamster ovary cell mutants revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation at residue Trp263Ter in ZP104 cells and a pair of heterozygous nonsense mutations, Trp170Ter and Trp114Ter, in ZP109. This result and domain mapping of Pex12p showed that RING finger is essential for peroxisome-restoring activity of Pex12p but not necessary for targeting to peroxisomes. The N-terminal region of Pex12p, including amino acid residues at positions 17–76, was required for localization to peroxisomes, while the sequence 17–76 was not sufficient for peroxisomal targeting. Peroxins interacting with RING finger of Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p were investigated by yeast two-hybrid as well as in vitrobinding assays. The RING finger of Pex12p bound to Pex10p and the PTS1-receptor Pex5p. Pex10p also interacted with Pex2p and Pex5pin vitro. Moreover, Pex12p was co-immunoprecipitated with Pex10p from CHO-K1 cells, where Pex5p was not associated with the Pex12p-Pex10p complex. This observation suggested that Pex5p does not bind to, or only transiently interacts with, Pex10p and Pex12p when Pex10p and Pex12p are in the oligomeric complex in peroxisome membranes. Hence, the RING finger peroxins are most likely to be involved in Pex5p-mediated matrix protein import into peroxisomes.

The protein transport is mediated by targeting sequences that are recognized either in the cytoplasm, as in a secretory pathway, or on the surface of organelles, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts. Peroxisomal matrix and membrane proteins are also synthesized on free polyribosomes and imported post-translationally into peroxisomes (2Lazarow P.B. Fujiki Y. Annu. Rev.

In contrast, PTS for membrane proteins, termed mPTS, is not well understood, while mPTS for Candida boidinii PMP47 is better known (11Dyer J.M. McNew J.A. Goodman J.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 269-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). In recent years, we and other laboratories have identified 16 different complementation groups (CGs) in mammals by CG analysis between Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell mutants of 13 CGs and fibroblasts from patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBDs) of 13 CGs (12Matsuzono Y. Kinoshita N. Tamura S. Shimozawa N. Hamasaki M. Ghaedi K. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo K. Fujiki Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Cell Res. 1999; 248: 489-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Hence, at least 16 genes or their products are required for mammalian peroxisome biogenesis. Thirteen genes have been identified by functional complementation assay using CHO mutants and homology search on the expressed sequence tag data base. Several peroxins identified are involved in peroxisomal matrix protein import. Pex14p locates on peroxisome membranes and binds the tetratricopeptide repeat peroxin Pex5p in both isoforms of the PTS1 receptor, Pex5pS and Pex5pL (14Fransen M. Terlecky S.R. Subramani S. Proc.

Pex5pL, but not Pex5pS, mediates the binding of PTS2 protein to Pex14p by translocating the WD motif peroxin Pex7p, which is a PTS2 receptor (17Otera H. Harano T. Honsho M. Ghaedi K. Mukai S.

These three peroxins, Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p, are integral membrane proteins of peroxisomes and contain RING zinc finger at the C-terminal part. Impaired function of these three peroxins results in the failure of matrix protein import, implying that RING peroxins are involved in the process of protein transport across the membrane, possibly as members of import machinery constituents. Moreover, Pex2p, Pex10p, and Pex12p are mutually distinct in the primary sequence except for a commonly shared RING finger. Thus, the RING finger is probably important for the function of these peroxins. As a step toward understanding the role of Pex12p in the translocation of proteins into peroxisomes, we investigated the functional region(s) of Pex12p using pex12 CHO cell mutants and searched for peroxins interacting with Pex12p. We found that RING finger was required for the biological activity of Pex12p, not for targeting of Pex12p to peroxisomes. Pex12p interacted with Pex5p and Pex10p through this RING finger. The N-terminal portion facing the cytoplasm was found to be responsible for the biological function and peroxisomal targeting of Pex12p. Chang et al. (26Chang C.-C. Warren D.S. Sacksteder K.A.

One of four positive clones was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(−) (pBS) (Stratagene) at theSalI–NotI site. The nucleotide sequence of pBS/ClPEX12 was determined on both strands, using a Dye-terminator cycle sequence kit and a 377 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer).

Total RNA was isolated from each mutant by the acid guanidium/phenol/chloroform method (32Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63190) Google Scholar). Using 5 μg of the total RNA as a template, first-strand cDNA was synthesized and amplified with Ex Taq DNA polymerase (Takara, Tokyo, Japan) and the primers, sense ClP12RT.F and antisense ClP12RT.R (Table I), in order to cover a full-length open reading frame of ClPEX12. Amplified DNA fragments were digested with BamHI and subcloned into the pBS at the BamHI site. ZP104- and ZP109-derived ClPEX12 was cloned into pUcD2SRαMCSHyg, as above. The DNA sequence was determined on both strands. An N-terminal truncation mutant of rat Pex12p, termed ΔN1 (Δ1–76, comprising amino acids residues 77–359), was described (21Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4324-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Pex12p mutants ΔN2 (Δ1–97) and ΔN3 (Δ1–202) were constructed by self-ligation ofBamHI–SacI and BamHI–SalI fragments of pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12, respectively, after adjusting a frame by using an 8-mer BamHI linker. For mutant ΔN4 (Δ1–258), PstI–ApaI fragment ofPEX12 from pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12 was blunted only at the PstI end, and 8-mer BamHI linker was added. After digestion with BamHI, theBamHI–ApaI fragment was replaced at the sites ofBamHI and ApaI in pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12. For mutants ΔN5 (Δ1–25), ΔN6 (Δ1–48), ΔN7 (Δ1–16), and ΔN8 (Δ1–8), theBamHI–XbaI region of full-lengthFLAG-PEX12 in pUcD2SRαMCSHyg was replaced by respectiveBamHI–XbaI fragments of PCR products amplified by forward primers del-N5.F, del-N6.F, del-N7.F, and del-N8.F, respectively, and a reverse primer, RnP12N.R. Several mutants, named the ΔM series, with shorter deletions in the N-terminal region of Pex12p, were constructed. For mutants ΔM1 lacking amino acid residues 17–25 (Δ17–25) and ΔM2 (Δ26–48),BamHI fragments, each encoding amino acid residues 2–16 and 2–25 of Pex12p, were prepared by PCR with each pair of primers, FLAG.F/delM1.R and FLAG.F/delM2.R, using pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12 as a template. RespectiveBamHI fragments were cloned into the BamHI site of ΔN5 and ΔN6, resulting in ΔM1 and ΔM2, respectively. Mutant ΔM3 (Δ67–75) was generated by replacing theBamHI–XbaI region of full-lengthFLAG-PEX12 in pUcD2SRαMCSHyg with theBamHI–XbaI fragment of the PCR products amplified using primers FLAG.F and delM3.R2. Mutant ΔM4 (Δ77–97) was constructed by self-ligation after blunting of theSpeI–SacI fragment of pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12. Mutant ΔM5 (Δ98–106) was generated by replacing the SacI–SalI part of pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12 with theSacI–SalI fragment of PCR products amplified using primers delM5.F and 46SalI.r. For C-terminal truncation mutants of Pex12p, pEGFP/RnPEX12 was constructed by cloning the BamHI (blunted)–ApaI fragment of full-length PEX12 cDNA from pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12 at the sites of BglII (blunted) and ApaI in pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH). pEGFP/RnPEX12 encodes EGFP-Pex12p, Pex12p fused to the C terminus of the EGFP. C-terminal truncation mutants of Pex12p, named ΔC1 (Δ258–359), ΔC2 (Δ203–359), and ΔC3 (Δ77–359), were generated by self-ligation after blunting the digest of pEGFP/RnPEX12 withPstI, SalI, and XbaI, respectively. For Pex12p mutants with deletion around the RING finger motif at the C-terminal region, ΔR and ΔPL were constructed from pUcD2Hyg/RnPEX12-myc. First, thePstI–ApaI fragment of PCR products amplified by primers PstI.f and ΔRMyc.r was replaced into the sites ofPstI and ApaI in pBS·46myc,RnPEX12-myc in pBS (21Okumoto K. Shimozawa N. Kawai A. Tamura S. Tsukamoto T. Osumi T. Moser H. Wanders R.J.A. Suzuki Y. Kondo N. Fujiki Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4324-4336Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Resultant pBS/RnPEX12ΔR was then digested withXhoI and ApaI, and the fragment was inserted into the sites of SalI and ApaI in pUcD2SRαMCSHyg vector. Mutant ΔR lacking RING finger in residues 301–359 (Δ301–359) was tagged with Myc epitope at the C terminus. For mutant ΔPL (Δ259–286), the ApaLI (blunted)–ApaI fragment from pBS·46myc was cloned into the PstI (blunted)–ApaI site of pBS·46myc vector that had been separately prepared. Resultant pBS/RnPEX12ΔPLwas digested with XhoI and ApaI and cloned into pUcD2SRαMCSHyg vector, as done for ΔR. To construct mutant ΔPS (Δ279–288), two inserts were prepared:SalI–ApaLI fragment of PCR product amplified by primers 46SalI.f and ΔPS.r, using pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12 as a template, and ApaLI–ApaI fragment from pBS·46myc. The two inserts were simultaneously ligated into the sites of SalI and ApaI in pUcD2Hyg/FLAG-RnPEX12. All constructs were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. These plasmids were transfected into wild-type CHO-K1 and pex12 mutant ZP109, as described above. At 3 days after transfection, cells were examined by immunofluorescence light microscopy, as described above. Yeast two-hybrid plasmids were made by inserting a desired gene fragment downstream of the GAL4DNA binding domain (DB) in pDBLeu and the GAL4 activation domain (AD) in pPC86 (33Chevray P.M.

After blunting, the fragment was inserted into the SmaI site of pDBLeu and pPC86, named pDB/PEX2C and pPC/PEX2C, respectively. Yeast two-hybrid assays were performed using a ProQuest two-hybrid system (Life Technologies, Inc.). Saccharomyces cerevisiaeMaV203 (Matα, leu2–3, 112,trp1–901, his3Δ200,ade2–101, gal4Δ, gal80Δ,SPAL10::URA3,GAL1::lacZ, HIS3 UAS GAL::HIS3@LYS2,can1R, cyh2R) was used as a host strain (36Vidal M.

Briefly, MaV203 cells were co-transformed by pDBLeu and pPC86 containing cDNA to be examined and grown on minimum medium lacking leucine and tryptophan (SC-LW). After incubation at 30 °C for 48 h, co-transformants were transferred directly onto a nylon membrane HiBond C-Extra (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for assaying the activity oflacZ.

https://openalex.org/W2027816266,"Oxidative stress caused by phorbol esters or reactive oxygen up-regulates the class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) in human smooth muscle cells (SMC), which normally do not express this receptor. The increase in SR-A expression correlates with activation of the redox-sensitive transcription factors activating protein-1 c-Jun and CCAAT enhancer-binding protein β. Here we show that coincubation of SMC with macrophages or oxidized low density lipoproteins (LDL) from macrophage-conditioned medium activates these same regulatory pathways and stimulates SR-A expression. The increased SR-A gene transcription induced by cell-oxidized LDL up-regulated SR-A mRNA and increased by 30-fold the uptake of acetyl LDL, a ligand for the SR-A. Copper-oxidized LDL also increased SR-A receptor expression. Oxidized LDL with a lipid peroxide level of 80–100 nmol/mg of LDL protein and an electrophoretic mobility ∼1.5 times that of native LDL exhibited the greatest bioactivity. Inhibition of calcium flux suppressed SR-A induction by oxidized LDL. Conversely, calcium ionophore greatly enhanced SR-A up-regulation by oxidized LDL or other treatments that promote intracellular oxidative stress. This enhancement was dependent upon concurrent up-regulation of SMC cyclooxygenase-2 expression and activity and was blocked by the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors NS-398 and Resveratrol. In THP-1 cells, oxidized LDL induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and increased SR-A expression. These findings support a role for mildly oxidized LDL in the redox regulation of macrophage differentiation and SR-A expression and suggest that increased vascular oxidative stress may contribute to the formation of both SMC and macrophage foam cells.

This enhancement was dependent upon concurrent up-regulation of SMC cyclooxygenase-2 expression and activity and was blocked by the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors NS-398 and Resveratrol. In THP-1 cells, oxidized LDL induced monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation and increased SR-A expression. These findings support a role for mildly oxidized LDL in the redox regulation of macrophage differentiation and SR-A expression and suggest that increased vascular oxidative stress may contribute to the formation of both SMC and macrophage foam cells. smooth muscle cell(s) arachidonic acid low density lipoproteins(s) acetylated LDL activating protein 1 base pair(s) 1,2-bis(O-aminophenoxy) ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid CAAT/enhancer-binding protein cyclooxygenase 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate fetal bovine serum fast performance liquid chromatography combination of hydrogen peroxide (100 μm) and sodium orthovanadate (10 μm) c-Jun amino-terminal activating kinase prostaglandin E2 phospholipase A cytoplasmic phospholipase A2 extracellular group II PLA2, ROS, reactive oxygen species class A scavenger receptor polymerase chain reaction The traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis, which include hypercholesterolemia, hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes, and high fat diet, have all been associated with endothelial dysfunction (1.Vogel R.A. Clin. Cardiol. 1997; 20: 426-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, circulating monocytes adhere to the arterial endothelium, migrate to the subendothelial space, and differentiate into resident macrophages within the subendothelial cell matrix. The differentiated cells express scavenger receptors that take up modified lipoproteins, leading to a massive accumulation of cholesterol esters and the appearance of foam cells. These macrophage-derived foam cells make up the fatty streak lesions that precede more advanced atherosclerotic lesions, which can ultimately cause thrombosis and myocardial infarction (2.Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (9988) Google Scholar). Advanced atherosclerotic lesions also contain smooth muscle cells (SMC),1 which migrate from the media of the blood vessels to the neointima, where they proliferate. Intimal SMC can also accumulate large amounts of cholesterol esters and become foam cells. Although the cholesterol that accumulates in foam cells is derived from lipoproteins, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. Plasma lipoproteins are oxidatively modified in the subendothelial matrix, where they cause the release of cytokines that attract monocytes to the subendothelial space (3.Steinberg D. Parthasarathy S. Carew T.E. Khoo J.C. Witztum J.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 1989; 320: 915-924Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). With further oxidation, these low density lipoproteins (LDL) become ligands for several scavenger receptors on macrophages. Since they are not down-regulated as the intracellular content of cholesterol increases, these receptors are thought to contribute to the excessive uptake of modified lipoproteins and to the lipid engorgement characteristic of macrophage-derived foam cells (4.Steinbrecher U.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1436: 279-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). The first of these scavenger receptors to be cloned was the class A scavenger receptor (SR-A) (5.Kodama T. Freeman M. Rohrer L. Zabrecky J. Matsudaira P. Krieger M. Nature. 1990; 343: 531-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Knockout mice lacking this receptor were resistant to the development of atherosclerosis, suggesting that the SR-A contributes to the uptake of modified lipoproteins and to cholesterol ester accumulation in macrophages in vivo (6.Suzuki H. Kurihara Y. Takeya M. Kamada N. Kataoka M. Jishage K. Ueda O. Sakaguchi H. Higashi T. Suzuki T. Takashima Y. Kawabe Y. Cynshi O. Wada Y. Honda M. Kurihara H. Aburatani H. Doi T. Matsumoto A. Azuma S.

Nature. 1997; 386: 292-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). How SMC in the artery wall accumulate lipid is less clear, since SMC were initially thought to be devoid of scavenger receptors. We have shown, however, that SMC express SR-A and that receptor expression is regulated over a wide range (7.Pitas R.E. J. Biol.

Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1997; 17: 969-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Certain growth factors that increase SMC SR-A activity (10.Gong Q. Pitas R.E. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 1079-1088Crossref PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar). The latter two factors are responsible for the up-regulation of SMC SR-A activity by platelet secretory products (10.Gong Q. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21672-21678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as superoxide anions and H2O2, function as second messengers in signal transduction, mediating ligand stimulation by tyrosine phosphorylation (16.Finkel T. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1998; 10: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Ca2+ signaling is also thought to contribute to ROS-induced gene expression (17.Suzuki Y.J. Ford G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H114-H116PubMed Google Scholar,18.Doan T.N. Gentry D.L. Taylor A.A. Elliott S.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Downstream targets of ROS include the stress-activated c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) (19.Bae Y.S. Kang S.W. Seo M.S. Baines I.C. Tekle E. Chock P.B. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 217-221Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1097) Google Scholar), which phosphorylates and activates c-Jun. Indeed, the level of intracellular glutathione is a key regulator of JNK induction and therefore of activating protein-1 (AP-1)/c-Jun transcriptional activity (20.Wilhelm D. Bender K. Knebel A. Angel P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 4792-4800Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). A composite AP-1/Ets binding element located between −67 and −50 base pairs (bp) relative to the transcriptional start site of the SR-A gene is critical for regulation of macrophage SR-A activity (21.Moulton K.S. Semple K. Wu H. Glass C.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4408-4418Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). We previously showed that the increase in SMC SR-A expression under conditions that promote oxidative stress correlates with the activation of the AP-1/c-Jun transcription factor and increased JNK activity (22.Mietus-Snyder M. Glass C.K. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Binding of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) β to a C/EBP site in the SR-A promoter between −44 and −21 (bp) relative to the transcriptional start site was also necessary for full up-regulation of SR-A expression in SMC (22.Mietus-Snyder M. Glass C.K. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). SMC SR-A activity is up-regulated in vivo by an atherogenic diet in rabbits (23.Li H. Freeman M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 122-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), suggesting that hyperlipidemia also contributes to intracellular oxidative stress, thereby altering SMC gene expression either directly or through paracrine factors secreted by local inflammatory cells. Cytokines known to be secreted by activated leukocytes up-regulated SR-A expression in rabbit SMC in vitro (23.Li H. Freeman M.W. Libby P. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 95: 122-133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In developing atherosclerotic lesions, intimal SMC are closely associated with macrophages that secrete numerous growth factors, cytokines, and ROS (24.Laskin D.L. Pendino K.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1995; 35: 655-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar), suggesting that factors secreted by macrophages might interact with SMC to increase SR-A expression. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that coculture of SMC with macrophages would increase the SMC SR-A activity. Here we report that coculture with macrophages increased SR-A expression in SMC; however, the enhanced SR-A activity was caused by cell-oxidized LDL and not by growth factors or cytokines secreted by the macrophages. Further characterization of the mechanism of receptor up-regulation revealed a role for calcium flux and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2. Fetal bovine serum (FBS), Dulbecco's phosphate-buffered saline, and the fluorescent probe 1,1′-dioctadecyl-3,3,3′,3′-tetramethylindocarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) were obtained as described previously (7.Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12722-12727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, sodium orthovanadate (vanadate), H2O2, Resveratrol, EGTA, BAPTA, diltiazam, and verapamil were from Sigma. Mibefradil was obtained from Hoffman-La Roche (Basel, Switzerland). The COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (25.Futaki N. Takahashi S. Yokoyama M. Arai I. Higuchi S. Otomo S. Prostaglandins. 1994; 47: 55-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar) was obtained from Biomol Research Laboratories (Plymouth Meeting, PA). The concentration of active H2O2 was standardized immediately before each use by spectrophotometry on the basis of an extinction coefficient of 0.0393 at 240 nm. Primary human aortic SMC and SMC growth medium were purchased from Clonetics (San Diego, CA). SMC lines were maintained at 37 °C in 7% CO2. THP-1 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in RPMI (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37 °C in 5% CO2. Ham's F-10 medium was obtained from Life Technologies. Rabbit peritoneal macrophages were obtained from New Zealand White rabbits by peritoneal lavage 3 days after stimulation with an intraperitoneal injection of mineral oil (26.Boring L. Gosling J. Chensue S.W. Kunkel S.L. Farese Jr., R.V. Broxmeyer H.E. Charo I.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 2552-2561Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). The macrophages were isolated and washed in phosphate-buffered saline, resuspended in RPMI, and added immediately to confluent SMC cultures. Human LDL (d = 1.02–1.05 g/ml) were obtained from plasma and were either labeled with DiI and acetylated (Ac) as described (9.Dejager S. Mietus-Snyder M. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. 1993; 13: 371-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 27.Pitas R.E. Innerarity T.L. Weinstein J.N. Mahley R.W. Arteriosclerosis. 1981; 1: 177-185Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) or oxidized. For cell-mediated oxidation of LDL, LDL (100 μg/ml) in serum-free Ham's F-10 medium were incubated with differentiated THP-1 cells at 37 °C for 6 h, unless otherwise specified. LDL were also oxidized in vitro with copper sulfate (10 μm) for 6 h at 37 °C. Oxidation was stopped by adding EDTA and butylated hydroxytoluene to final concentrations of 2 mm and 40 μm, respectively. The cell-oxidized LDL were dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline containing 100 μm EDTA and stored at 4 °C for no more than 3 days before use. The extent of LDL modification was assessed by electrophoretic mobility in 1% agarose. Lipid peroxide levels in oxidized LDL were measured by quantifying the oxidation of iodide to iodine (I3), as described (28.El-Saadani M. Esterbauer H. El-Sayed M. Goher M. Nassar A.Y. Jürgens G. J. Lipid. Res. 1989; 30: 627-630Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances in preparations of cell-modified LDL were measured as described (29.Steinbrecher U.P. Parthasarathy S. Leake D.S. Witztum J.L. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3883-3887Crossref PubMed Scopus (1417) Google Scholar). To prepare lipid-poor serum, human plasma was incubated with Cabosil (25 mg/ml) (Packard International, Zurich, Switzerland) for 2 h at 37 °C, 15 h at 4 °C, and then centrifuged at 100,000 ×g. The lipid-depleted supernatant was decanted and dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline. To prepare cell-conditioned medium, THP-1 cells were differentiated for 72 h with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (100 nm), washed extensively, and incubated for 6 h in RPMI with or without 10% FBS. Conditioned medium was cleared of cellular debris by low speed centrifugation followed by passage through a 0.45-μm filter, aliquoted, and stored at −70 °C. Activity was not compromised by freezing and thawing. To determine if the bioactivity of conditioned medium was associated with the cell-modified LDL, the LDL were reisolated from the medium by fast performance liquid chromatography (FPLC) or ultracentrifugation as described (30.Linton M.F. Farese Jr., R.V. Chiesa G. Grass D.S. Chin P. Hammer R.E. Hobbs H.H. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 3029-3037Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). The FPLC fractions were tested for their ability to up-regulate SMC SR-A activity, and the bioactivity was compared with the LDL cholesterol elution pattern. The top and bottom thirds of the centrifuge tube, containing LDL and no LDL, respectively, were similarly tested. Nuclear extracts from human SMC treated with cell-modified LDL or with 100 μm H2O2 and 10 μmvanadate (H/V) were prepared as described (22.Mietus-Snyder M. Glass C.K. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). For binding studies, nuclear proteins (5 μg) were incubated with the AP-1/Ets site at −67 to −50 bp in the SR-A promoter or with the C/EBP consensus wild-type and mutant binding elements (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) as described (22.Mietus-Snyder M. Glass C.K. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Antibodies to c-Jun, c-Fos, C/EBPβ, and GAD153 used for supershift analyses were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Total cell extracts were prepared from similarly treated human SMC for the JNK assays as described (22.Mietus-Snyder M. Glass C.K. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and assayed for the ability to phosphorylate a glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun fusion protein bound to glutathione-agarose beads. Total RNA was isolated by phenol/chloroform extraction with Trizol (Life Technologies) and quantified spectrophotometrically by absorption at 260 and 280 nm. mRNA was purified with Dynabeads oligo(dT) (Dynal, Lake Success, NY) and magnetic separation techniques. Full-length first-strand cDNA was generated with avian myoblastosis virus reverse transcriptase, a cDNA cycle kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), and random primers; human SMC mRNA (50 ng) or total THP-1 RNA (5 μg) was used as a template. Subsequent amplifications by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (30 cycles) were performed with constant amounts of the cDNA template, 1 unit of Taq polymerase, and specific sets of primers (0.1 μm) for the COX-2, type I and II SR-A, CD36, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase control genes. The sequences for the primers used to amplify human COX-2 mRNA were kindly provided by Dr. Andrew Dannenberg (Cornell Medical Center, New York, NY): sense COX-2 (5′-GGTCTGGTGCCTGGTCTGATGATG) and antisense COX-2 (5′-GTCCTTTCAAGGAGAATGGTGC) (PCR product 724 bp). The sense primer for the SR-AI and SR-AII genes was selected from a sequence common to the two subtypes: 5′-GATTGGGAACATTCTCAGACCTT. For the SR-AI and SR-AII genes, the antisense primers were 5′-CTTGTCCAAAGTGAGCTGCCTT (PCR product 444 bp) and 5′-CTGCCCTAATATGAT CAGTGAGT (PCR product 288 bp), respectively. For the CD36 gene, the sense primer was 5′-ATGGGCTGTGACCGGAACT, and the antisense primer was 5′-ACAGACCAACTGTGGTAG (PCR product 604 bp). A control primer set for the human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene was fromCLONTECH (PCR product 983 bp). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a specific product of COX-2-catalyzed arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism, was measured with a monoclonal enzymatic immunoassay (Cayman Chemical Co., Ann Arbor, MI). Platelet secretory products and ROS, as well as certain cytokines and growth factors alone and in combination, synergistically increase SR-A expression in SMC (7.Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12722-12727Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10.Gong Q. Pitas R.E. J. Biol.

Since activated macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions secrete several of these factors and are in intimate contact with SMC, we hypothesized that macrophage products might up-regulate SMC SR-A activity. To test this hypothesis, we cocultured SMC and rabbit peritoneal macrophages for 24 h and used fluorescence microscopy to assess the uptake of DiI-labeled AcLDL. Coincubated SMC internalized labeled AcLDL, indicating increased SR-A activity, whereas the control cells did not (Fig.1). Conditioned medium alone also increased SR-A activity, indicating that cell-cell contact was not required (Fig. 2). However, the increased activity did require lipoproteins. Conditioned medium containing LDL (100 μg/ml) or 10% FBS increased SMC SR-A activity 25–30-fold, whereas lipoprotein- or serum-free conditioned medium was inactive (Fig. 2).Figure 2Effect of medium conditioned by incubation with THP-1 cells for 6 h on SMC SR-A activity. SMC were incubated for 15–18 h in conditioned medium with or without LDL (100 μg/ml) or 10% FBS, washed, and incubated for 15–18 h in fresh medium containing DiI-labeled AcLDL (5 μg/ml). The cells were then trypsinized, fixed, and assayed for SR-A activity by fluorescence-activated cell sorter analysis. Data are reported as the increase in the mean fluorescence intensity of treated cells relative to that of control cells. Results represent the mean ± S.D. of three independent experiments. Conditioned medium containing LDL or FBS increased the uptake of DiI-labeled AcLDL by SMC, indicating increased SR-A activity. Conditioned medium lacking serum and lipid-poor conditioned medium were inactive.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Next, we determined whether the bioactivity resided within the LDL or was mediated by factors secreted by the macrophages in response to incubation with LDL. LDL were isolated from conditioned medium by FPLC and tested for their ability to up-regulate SMC SR-A activity. The column fractions that contained the LDL, as determined by cholesterol content, coincided with the fractions that up-regulated SMC SR-A activity (Fig. 3). To confirm that the LDL fraction contained the active component, LDL (d = 1.063 g/ml) were reisolated from conditioned medium by ultracentrifugation and tested for bioactivity. The uptake of DiI-labeled AcLDL increased markedly in SMC incubated with the “top” lipoprotein-containing fraction (21.8 ± 0.9-fold over control cells); the “bottom” nonlipoprotein fraction had minimal activity (2.7 ± 0.3-fold increase over control). To rule out the possibility that cytokines or growth factors secreted by the macrophages contributed to the increased SMC SR-A activity, we performed antibody blocking experiments. Under conditions that prevent platelet secretory products from increasing SR-A activity in SMC (10.Gong Q. Pitas R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 21672-21678Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), antibodies to interleukin-1, interleukin-6, platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and transforming growth factor β, alone and in combination, did not block the bioactivity in the conditioned medium (data not shown). Because LDL incubated with cells undergo oxidative modification, we hypothesized that oxidatively modified LDL were the active species in the conditioned medium. We tested this hypothesis in three ways. First, the active preparations of LDL from cell-conditioned medium were assayed for lipid peroxide level and electrophoretic mobility. The maximal ability to increase SR-A activity correlated with mild lipoprotein oxidation, as indicated by a peroxide level of 80–100 nmol/mg LDL protein and a relative electrophoretic mobility ∼1.5 times greater than that of native LDL (data not shown). The thiobarbituric acid-reactive substance content of the active LDL preparations was consistently <10 nmol/mg LDL protein. More extensively oxidized LDL were toxic to the SMC (data not shown). Second, LDL were incubated for 6 h with THP-1 cells in the presence of EDTA (200 μm) and butylated hydroxytoluene (20 μm) to prevent oxidation. Under these conditions, no lipid peroxides formed, the electrophoretic mobility of the LDL was unchanged, and the conditioned medium did not up-regulate SR-A (data not shown). Third, we evaluated the ability of mildly chemically oxidized LDL to activate SMC SR-A expression. Chemically modified LDL with lipid hydroperoxide levels and electrophoretic mobilities similar to those of cell-modified LDL up-regulated SMC SR-A activity 10-fold more than native LDL; however, the level of SR-A activation was notably less than when cell-modified LDL were used (Fig.4). This difference in bioactivity might have resulted from differences in the specific oxidized lipids formed by the two oxidation methods or from effects of additional bioactive factors released by activated macrophages into the medium. Up-regulation of SR-A activity in SMC treated with phorbol ester or H/V is dependent upon increased binding of the AP-1/c-Jun transcription factor to SR-A promoter elements (22.Mietus-Snyder M. Glass C.K. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that incubation of SMC with cell-modified LDL would increase the level of this transcription factor. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed a time-dependent increase in AP-1 binding in nuclear extracts from human SMC incubated with cell-modified LDL; supershift analyses identified c-Jun and c-Fos in the binding complex, and competition studies confirmed the specificity of binding (Fig. 5 A). Because AP-1/c-Jun must be phosphorylated to be active, we examined the activity of the specific c-Jun-activating kinase, JNK. Increased JNK activity was present within the SMC lysates after incubation with conditioned medium (Fig. 5 B). The SR-A promoter also contains a C/EBP binding site, and full SR-A transcriptional activity in SMC requires C/EBPβ as well as AP-1/c-Jun binding (22.Mietus-Snyder M. Glass C.K. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed greater C/EBP binding to nuclear extracts from SMC treated with cell-modified LDL than to nuclear extracts from untreated control SMC (Fig. 6 A). The binding activity was supershifted with C/EBPβ antibody but not with antibody to the related transcription factor GADD 153 (Fig. 6 B). The specificity of C/EBPβ binding was further demonstrated by complete competition with unlabeled oligonucleotide corresponding to the consensus C/EBP wild-type sequence but not with a mutant sequence containing an 8-bp substitution in the binding motif. The central band in the tripartite binding complex was consistently more prominent at the later time points (Fig. 6 B). Variable band intensities in the complex C/EBPβ binding pattern are due to the differential translational and posttranslational processing characteristic of the C/EBPβ trans-activator protein (32.Cao Z. Umek R.M. McKnight S.L. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 1538-1552Crossref PubMed Scopus (1345) Google Scholar). Treatment with H/V increases intracellular oxidative stress and activates redox-sensitive SR-A gene expression in SMC (22.Mietus-Snyder M. Glass C.K. Pitas R.E. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1998; 18: 1440-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Because oxidants stimulate calcium signaling (17.Suzuki Y.J. Ford G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 262: H114-H116PubMed Google Scholar, 18.Doan T.N. Gentry D.L. Taylor A.A. Elliott S.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 297: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), we examined the effect of the calcium ionophore A23,187 on the ability of H/V or cell-modified LDL to regulate receptor activity (Fig.7 A). Incubation of SMC with A23,187 and either H/V or cell-modified LDL significantly increased SR-A activity. The up-regulation was 3.4-fold greater than was obtained with H/V alone and 2.2-fold greater than with conditioned medium alone.

https://openalex.org/W2015121221,"Sciatic nerve axons in cyclin D1 knockout mice develop normally, become properly ensheathed by Schwann cells, and appear to function normally. However, in the Wallerian degeneration model of nerve injury, the mitotic response of Schwann cells is completely inhibited. The mitotic block is Schwann cell autonomous and developmentally regulated. Rescue analysis (by ""knockin"" of cyclin E) indicates that D1 protein, rather than regulatory elements of the D1 gene, provides the essential Schwann cell function. Genetic inhibition of the Schwann cell cycle shows that neuronal responses to nerve injury are surprisingly independent of Schwann cell mitotic responses. Even axonal regrowth into the distal zone of a nerve crush injury is not markedly impaired in cyclin D1-/- mice."
https://openalex.org/W2023938246,"Although regioselective removal of 6-O-sulfate groups of heparin has been undertaken by several researchers, complete 6-O-desulfation with little side reaction has not been attained successfully. In this work, a modified method with a certain silylating reagent,N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide, has been established to produce completely 6-O-desulfated heparin with few other chemical changes. The degrees of 6-O-desulfation were estimated by means of chemical disaccharide analyses and/or 13C NMR spectra. Although the completely 6-O-desulfated heparin lost about 20% of 2-O-sulfate groups, any other chemical changes and depolymerization were not detected. The completely 6-O-desulfated heparin displayed strong inhibition of COS-1 cell adhesion to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-coated well in a dose-dependent manner, as was clarified by the competitive cell-adhesion assay. Furthermore, the completely 6-O-desulfated heparin was shown to promote in vitro A31 fibroblast proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in the presence of bFGF. These results suggest that signal transduction through bFGF/bFGF receptor in A31 cells occurs in the absence of 6-O-sulfate groups in heparin. The involvement of 6-O-sulfate group(s) of heparin/heparan sulfate in the promotion of bFGF mitogenic activity was reported by several groups. This discrepancy between our results and those of other groups would be due to the differences in molecular size of heparin/heparan sulfate derivatives and/or cell species used for the assay.

The former GAG, heparin, is exclusively distributed in mast cells, and the latter GAG, HS, is widely distributed in animal tissues. With the accumulation of the information concerning biological roles of heparin and HS, it has been revealed that their biological functions mostly depend upon interaction between polysaccharides and physiologically active molecules, although the biological roles of heparin and HS are highly diverged. For instance, they interact with lipoprotein lipase (1Shimada K. Gill P.J. Silbert J.E. Douglas W.H. Fanburg B.L. J. Clin.

Chemical modification of heparin has been undertaken by several researchers, focusing on the elucidation of the mechanism underlying interaction between heparin and the physiologically active molecules as described above. Specific removal of major sulfate groups of heparin such as 2-O-sulfate, 6-O-sulfate, andN-sulfate groups would be useful in order to clarify the backbone structures of oligosaccharides bearing specific array of sulfate groups responsible for the interactions with physiologically active molecules. For instance, selective removal of 6-O-sulfate groups from glucosamine residues of heparin is of great importance in order to evaluate the involvement of 6-O-sulfate group(s) in the interaction between heparin, bFGF, and FGF receptors (FGFRs) (13Aviezer D.

Res. 1986; 145: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), methods for 6-O-desulfation have not. However, solvolysis andN-resulfation reactions have been utilized to prepare 6-O-desulfated heparin as one of the available methods (32Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1979; 86: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1980; 8: 287-289Google Scholar, 34Ayotte L. Perlin A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 145: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Solvolysis of heparin affords complete removal ofN-sulfate groups from GlcN residues, removal of a substantial part of 2-O-sulfate groups from iduronic acid (IdoUA) residues, and incomplete removal of 6-O-sulfate groups from GlcN residues, which occur even under the most optimized conditions (35Baumann H. Scheen H. Huppertz B. Keller R. Carbohydr. Res. 1998; 308: 381-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the heparin derivative prepared by the subsequent N-resulfation contains significantly reduced amounts of 2-O-sulfate groups of IdoUA residues, resulting in the unsuccessful regioselectivity for desulfation and incomplete 6-O-desulfation. Use of such structurally undefined samples for molecular interaction analyses might cause alternative results. Alternatively, 6-O-desulfation of heparin could be attained by the method with silylating reagents such asN,O-bis(trimethylsilyl)acetamide (BTSA) andN-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)- trifluoro acetamide (MTSTFA), resulting in high regioselectivity for desulfation (36Matsuo M. Takano R. Kamei-Hayashi K. Hara S. Carbohydr. Res. 1993; 241: 209-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 37Takano R. Kanda T. Kamei-Hayashi K. Yoshida K. Hara S. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1995; 14: 885-888Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Although BTSA treatment of heparin causes incomplete 6-O-desulfation under mild conditions and complete 6-O-desulfation with concomitant N-desulfation under drastic conditions (38Takano R. Ye Z. Ta T.-V. Kamei K. Kariya Y. Hara S. Carbohydr. Lett. 1998; 3: 71-77Google Scholar), our previous studies indicated that MTSTFA treatment yielded substantial 6-O-desulfated heparin with few side effects as was determined with 13C NMR spectra (38Takano R. Ye Z. Ta T.-V. Kamei K. Kariya Y. Hara S. Carbohydr. Lett. 1998; 3: 71-77Google Scholar, 39Ishihara M. Takano R. Kanda T. Hayashi K. Hara S. Kikuchi H. Yoshida K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In the present study, the conditions for 6-O-desulfation of heparin mediated by MTSTFA were precisely examined in order to optimize the reaction temperature and the reaction time for the complete 6-O-desulfation, with the aid of a new HPLC technique for disaccharide analyses of heparin and HS (40Kariya Y. Herrmann J. Suzuki K. Isomura T. Ishihara M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and 13C NMR spectra. In addition, we refined the purification procedure of 6-O-desulfated heparin from the reaction mixture in order to obtain the final product susceptible to the enzymatic digestion prerequisite for the disaccharide composition analysis. Next, the present completely 6-O-desulfated heparin was examined for inhibition activity of COS-1 cell adhesion to bFGF-coated well and for its ability to modify mitogenic activity of bFGF by competitive cell adhesion assay and cell proliferation assay, respectively, in order to examine the involvement of 6-O-sulfate group(s) of heparin in the promotion of bFGF mitogenic activity. Heparin from porcine intestine was obtained from Scientific Protein Laboratories. 2-O-Desulfated heparin was prepared according to the method of Piani et al. (30Piani S. Casu B. Marchi E.G. Torrim G. Ungarelli F. J. Carbohydr. Chem. 1993; 12: 507-521Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 31Ishihara M. Kariya Y. Kikuchi H. Minamisawa T. Yoshida K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1997; 121: 345-349Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Solvolysis/N-resulfation-treated 6-O-desulfated heparin was prepared according to the previous method (32Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Tokuyasu T. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1979; 86: 1323-1329Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 33Nagasawa K. Inoue Y. Methods Carbohydr. Chem. 1980; 8: 287-289Google Scholar, 34Ayotte L. Perlin A.S. Carbohydr. Res. 1986; 145: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). MTSTFA was obtained from Azmax Co. PNP-hydrazine (reagent grade) was purchased from Wako Co. Heparitinase I (EC 4.2.2.8), heparitinase II (no EC number), and heparinase (EC 4.2.2.7) were obtained from Seikagaku Co. COS-1 cells (SV40-transformed African Green Monkey Kidney, ATCC CRL1650) were obtained from Dainihonseiyaku Co. A31 cells (BALB/c 3T3, clone A31) were obtained from Dainihonseiyaku Co. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) was obtained from Promega Co. All other reagents used were of analytical grade. To 500 mg of heparin pyridinium salt was added 10 volumes (w/w) of MTSTFA and 100 volumes (v/w) of pyridine. The mixture was subjected to stirring at room temperature until heparin pyridinium salt was thoroughly dissolved and then heated for 2 h at 80, 95, or 110 °C. During the reaction, 5-ml aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture at due intervals and were quickly cooled in an ice-bath. To each aliquot sample was added 5 ml of distilled water (DW), affording the degradation of MTSTFA with the simultaneous appearance of whitish turbidity. In the next place, each aliquot with whitish turbidity was subjected to dialysis against running tap water for 3 days. After adjusting pH of the resultant dialysate to 9.5, the aliquot was further subjected to dialysis against DW overnight. The final dialysate obtained was subjected to lyophilization. The 6-O-desulfation degree was estimated by the chemical disaccharide analysis as described below (40Kariya Y. Herrmann J. Suzuki K. Isomura T. Ishihara M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Sample aliquots from 110 °C reaction were further analyzed with 13C NMR in order to estimate another 6-O-desulfation degree. To 6 g of heparin pyridinium salt was added 10 volumes (w/w) of MTSTFA and 100 volumes (v/w) of pyridine. This reaction mixture was subjected to stirring at room temperature until heparin pyridinium salt was thoroughly dissolved in the mixture. Then the reaction mixture was heated at 110 °C for 2.5 h, where another 30 min was necessary to attain the reaction to proceed compared with that of 0.5-g scale reaction (2 h). During the reaction, 220-ml aliquots were withdrawn from the reaction mixture at 1, 1.5, and 2.5 h, followed by cooling in an ice bath. Each aliquot sample was concentrated 10-fold with a rotary evaporator, followed by the addition of 2 volumes of DW to degrade MTSTFA. The resultant whitish turbidity completely disappeared by the treatment under reduced pressure at 35 °C for 15 min. The product was then subjected to dialysis against running tap water for 3 days and further against DW overnight. The dialysate was applied to an Amberlite IR-120 column (H+ form; inner diameter 3 × 13 cm) equilibrated with DW, and the elution was performed with DW. Acidic fractions were combined, and the pH of the combined fraction was adjusted to 9.5 with 1 n NaOH, followed by dialysis against running tap water overnight and further against DW overnight. The final dialysate obtained was subjected to lyophilization. The 6-O-desulfation degree was estimated by the chemical disaccharide analysis as described below (40Kariya Y. Herrmann J. Suzuki K. Isomura T. Ishihara M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Enzymatic digestion of 6-O-desulfated heparin was performed using 200 μg of substrate powder and enzyme mixture (50 milliunits each of heparitinase I and II and heparinase) in 80 μl of 2 mm calcium acetate and 20 mm sodium acetate (pH 7.0) at 37 °C for 2 h. Enzymatic digestion degree was estimated by gel permeation chromatography-HPLC equipped with serially combined columns of TSK-gel PWXL-4000, PWXL-3000, and PWXL-2500 under constant flow (1 ml/min) of 0.2 m NaCl at 40 °C. Detection was performed with refractive index. Unsaturated disaccharide analysis was performed as reported previously (41Kariya Y. Yoshida K. Morikawa K. Tawada A. Miyazono H. Kikuchi H. Tokuyasu K. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1992; 103B: 473-479Google Scholar). Briefly, 20 μl of the above digest was applied to strong anion exchange (SAX)-HPLC equipped with a Dionex Carbopak PA-1 column. Elution was performed with the combination of five linear gradients of LiCl at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 40 °C. The eluant was monitored for unsaturated disaccharides by absorbance at 230 nm. Chemical disaccharide analyses were performed as reported previously (40Kariya Y. Herrmann J. Suzuki K. Isomura T. Ishihara M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1998; 123: 240-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 mg of intact or 6-O-desulfated heparin without hydrazinolysis was deaminated with 100 μl of HONO solution (pH 1.5) for 10 min at room temperature (42Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 176: 96-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The reaction was terminated by neutralization with 1n Na2CO3, followed by evaporation to dryness under a flow of dry air. To the dried residue were added 200 μl of DW and 200 μl of acetonitrile containing 1%para-nitrophenyl hydrazine (PNP-hydrazine) (w/v). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min to allow the coupling reaction to proceed, followed by desalting on a SepPak C-18 cartridge column. Then, the PNP-labeled disaccharides were applied to ion-pairing reversed phase (IPRP)-HPLC equipped with a Cosmosil Packed ODS column. Elution was performed with a linear gradient of CH3CN from 21 to 30% in the solvent containing 38 mm NH4H2PO4, 2 mm H3PO4, and 1 mmtetrabutylammonium phosphate at a flow rate of 1 ml/min at 40 °C (43Guo Y. Conrad H.E. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 54-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The eluant was monitored for PNP-labeled disaccharides by absorbance at 390 nm. Calculation of 6-O-desulfation degree was performed according to the change in peak area ratio of IdoUA(2S)-AnMan-PNP (ISM) to IdoUA(2S)-AnMan(6S)-PNP (ISMS) before and after each 6-O-desulfation reaction. The 13C NMR spectra in 10% D2O solution at 80 °C were measured on a spectrometer QE-300 (General Electric Co.) operating at 75.61 MHz. Chemical shift values were expressed relative to sodium-3-(trimethylsilyl)-propionate using internal methanol (51.6 ppm). Calculation of 6-O-desulfation degree was performed according to the change in signal intensity ratio of C-6 at GlcNS to C-6 at GlcNS(6S) before and after each 6-O-desulfation reaction. COS-1 cells were maintained in DMEM (Iwaki Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg of streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity. The ability of 6-O-desulfated heparin to inhibit competitively the adhesion of COS-1 cells to immobilized bFGF was examined by a modification of the procedure of Ishihara et al. (44Ishihara M.

Briefly, each well of a 96-well tissue culture plate was coated with 40 μl of 10 μg/ml human recombinant bFGF overnight at 4 °C. The content of each well was aspirated, and then the well was rinsed with 200 μl of PBS and blocked by incubation with PBS containing 5% (v/v) fetal bovine serum for 1 h at room temperature. A pellet of COS-1 cells was prepared by incubation with PBS containing 2 mm EDTA for 10 min at 37 °C, pipetting, and collection by centrifugation. The cells were then resuspended at a density of 1.2 × 106 cells/ml with PBS containing 5% fetal bovine serum. The 6-O-desulfated heparin was then added to the suspension. The cell suspension (100 μl) was immediately applied to the coated wells and incubated for 10 min at room temperature. Each well was washed twice with 200 μl of PBS, and then 20 μl of 5% SDS was added to lyse the bound cells. To each well was added 200 μl of Micro BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce), and the protein concentration of the lysate in each well was determined with bovine serum albumin as a standard by measuring the absorbance at 545 nm. A31 cells were maintained in DMEM (Iwaki Co.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in air and 100% relative humidity. For the assay of the growth of non-chlorate-treated A31 cells, the cells were seeded at an initial density of 5000 cells/well in 96-well tissue culture plates and were grown for 3 days in 100 μl of DMEM supplemented with ITS+® (Life Technologies, Inc.; insulin (10 mg/ml), transferrin (5.5 μg/ml), selenium (5 ng/ml)), human recombinant bFGF (2 ng/ml), penicillin G (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), and 6-O-desulfated heparin to be tested. For testing the ability of the 6-O-desulfated heparin to restore the bFGF-induced proliferation of chlorate-treated A31 cells, cells were grown for 3 days in DMEM lacking sulfate but supplemented with ITS+®, bFGF (2 ng/ml), sodium chlorate (20 mm), penicillin G (100 units/ml), and 6-O-desulfated heparin to be tested. After incubation, to each well was added 20 μl of MTS/PMS solution (cell titer 96 aqueous non-radioactive cell proliferation assay kit, Promega Co.). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 h, the number of living cells in each well was determined by measuring the absorbance at 492 nm. Fig. 1 shows the IPRP-HPLC profiles for disaccharide compositions of the products obtained from 500-mg scale reaction in the presence of MTSTFA at 110 °C for 0 (intact heparin), 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Since each profile was obtained by the application of the same amount of PNP-coupling disaccharides to IPRP-HPLC, comparison between mutual profiles could be valid. IPRP-HPLC profile of 0-min product is shown in Fig. 1 a. The peaks prerequisite for the estimation of 6-O-desulfation degree are those assigned to be ISM (12 min) and ISMS (16 min). The area of the former peak increased with the increase of reaction time, whereas the area of the latter peak decreased with the increase of reaction time (Fig. 1, b—e), showing the steps of the 6-O-desulfation reaction. IPRP-HPLC profiles of 500-mg scale reactions at 80 and 95 °C represented similar but slower reaction time-dependent changes in 6-O-desulfation compared with that of 110 °C reaction (data not shown). Table I shows the peak areas of ISM and ISMS for the products from 500-mg scale 6-O-desulfation reaction at 110 °C for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Fig. 2 shows the time dependence of 6-O-desulfation of heparin during 500-mg scale reaction in the presence of MTSTFA at three different reaction temperatures of 80, 95, and 110 °C.

Calculation of 6-O-desulfation degree was performed according to the change in peak area ratio of ISM to ISMS (see Fig. 1) before and after each 6-O-desulfation reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) D1=B0×A1−A0×B1B0×(A1+B1)×100(%)Equation 1 where A 0 indicates peak area of ISM of intact heparin; B 0 indicates peak area of ISMS of intact heparin; A 1 indicates peak area of ISM of 6-O-desulfated heparin; and B 1indicates peak area of ISMS of 6-O-desulfated heparin. As shown in Fig. 2, the 6-O-desulfation degree (D 1) increased with the increase of reaction time irrespective of reaction temperatures used, according to the kinetics of pseudo first-order reaction. When the temperature of 110 °C was adopted, the 6-O-desulfation reaction was essentially completed in 2 h. On the other hand, 80 and 95 °C reactions for 2 h yielded only 52 and 85% of 6-O-desulfation degrees, respectively. Accordingly, the 110 °C reaction was shown to superior to the 95 °C reaction adopted by previous study (39Ishihara M. Takano R. Kanda T. Hayashi K. Hara S. Kikuchi H. Yoshida K. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1995; 118: 1255-1260Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), in order to attain maximum 6-O-desulfation degree of MTSTFA-treated heparin. Fig. 3 shows the 13C NMR spectra of 500-mg scale reaction products at 110 °C for 0 (intact heparin), 15, 30, 60, and 120 min. Since each spectrum was obtained by the use of the same amount of heparin derivative, comparison between mutual spectrum could be valid. 13C NMR spectrum of 0-min product is shown in Fig. 3 a. The signals necessary for the estimation of 6-O-desulfation degree are those assigned as C-6 of GlcNS (62.7 ppm) and C-6 of GlcNS(6S) (69.1 ppm) (38Takano R. Ye Z. Ta T.-V. Kamei K. Kariya Y. Hara S. Carbohydr. Lett. 1998; 3: 71-77Google Scholar). The intensity of the former signal increased with the increase of reaction time, whereas the intensity of the latter signal decreased (Fig. 3,b–e). Table I shows the signal intensities of C-6 of GlcNS and C-6 of GlcNS(6S) for the products from 500-mg scale 6-O-desulfation reaction at 110 °C for 0, 15, 30, 60, and 120 min.

The function of Ca2+ during the tonic relay mode of these neurons during wakefulness is less clear. Here, we report that tonic activity in thalamocortical cells results in an increase in the intracellular Ca2+ concentration and subsequent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores mediated via ryanodine receptors (RyRs). Blockade of Ca2+ release shifted the regular firing of single action potentials toward the generation of spike clusters. Regular spike firing and intracellular Ca2+ release thus appear to be functionally coupled in a positive feedback manner, thereby supporting the relay mode of thalamocortical cells during wakefulness. Regulatory influences may be coupled to this system via the cyclic ADP ribose pathway."
https://openalex.org/W2003424039,"Locomotor activity in many species undergoes pronounced alterations in early postnatal life, and environmental cues may be responsible for modifying this process. To determine how these events are reflected in the nervous system, we studied rats reared under two different conditions-the presence or absence of gravity-in which the performance of motor operations differed. We found a significant effect of rearing environment on the size and complexity of dendritic architecture of spinal motor neurons, particularly those that are likely to participate in postural control. These results provide evidence that neurons subserving motor function undergo activity-dependent maturation in early postnatal life in a manner analogous to sensory systems."

The aim of this study was to investigate the roles of the N-linked oligosaccharides on the secreted form of mouse meprin A. Recombinant meprin α and mutants in which one of the 10 potential Asn glycosylation sites was mutated to Gln were all secreted and sorted exclusively into the apical medium of polarized Madin-Darby canine kidney cells, indicating that no specific N-linked oligosaccharide acts as a determinant for apical targeting of meprin α. Several of the mutant proteins had decreased enzymatic activity using a bradykinin analog as substrate, and deglycosylation of the wild-type protein resulted in loss of 75–100% activity. Some of the mutants were also more sensitive to heat inactivation. In studies with agents that inhibit glycosylation processes in vivo, tunicamycin markedly decreased secretion of meprin, whereas castanospermine and swainsonine had little effect on secretion, sorting, or enzymatic properties of meprin. When all the potential glycosylation sites on a truncated form of meprin α (α-(1–445)) were mutated, the protein was not secreted into the medium, but was retained within the cells even after 10 h. These results indicate that there is no one specific glycosylation site or type of oligosaccharide (high mannose- or complex-type) that determines apical sorting, but that core N-linked carbohydrates are required for optimal enzymatic activity and for secretion of meprin α.

The meprins are oligomers composed of α and/or β subunits that are evolutionarily related, but differ in function (1Bond J.S. Beynon R.J.

Meprin β subunits are integral membrane proteins; mature α subunits are secreted from cells unless associated with β subunits (4Johnson G.D. Hersh L.B. J. Biol.

Meprins are capable of degrading proteins such as collagens and gelatin; hormones such as parathyroid hormone, luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone; and small peptides such as bradykinin, angiotensins, and gastrin (3Wolz R.L.

The meprins may therefore be involved in activation or inactivation of important extracellular proteins and peptides and are highly regulated at transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels themselves. The deduced amino acid sequences of meprin α subunits from mouse, rat, and human cDNAs have been determined (12Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. Barrett A.J. Woessner F. Rawlings N. Handbook of Proteolytic Enzymes. Academic Press, Inc., San Diego, CA1999: 1222-1227Google Scholar). The subunit encodes an amino-terminal signal sequence (see Fig. 1, S), a prosequence (Pro), a protease (astacin-like) domain, a MAM (meprin, A5 protein, protein-tyrosine phosphatase μ) domain, a MATH (meprinand tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor homology) domain, an AM (afterMATH) domain, an I (inserted) domain, an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, a putative transmembrane-spanning domain (T), and a cytoplasmic domain (C) (13Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The mouse meprin α subunit is extensively glycosylated, containing ∼25% carbohydrate (14Tang J. Bond J.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 349: 192-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). It contains 10 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (15Jiang W. Gorbea C.M. Flannery A.V. Beynon R.J. Grant G.A. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9185-9193Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The functions of the oligosaccharides of meprins, however, have not been investigated. Appropriate glycosylation of a number of proteins is important for proper expression and function. For example, nonglycosylated rabies virus glycoprotein is not expressed at the cell surface, nor is it effective as a vaccine (16Shakin-Eshleman S.H. Remaley A.T. Eshleman J.R. Wunner W.H. Spitalnik S.L. J. Biol.

The features of meprins that direct the enzymes to apical membranes have not been characterized; however, the final destination of these proteases is critical for normal tissue physiology and for pathological processes. Basolateral targeting of transmembrane proteins generally is mediated by discrete amino acid sequence motifs in the cytoplasmic domain (19Kirchhausen T. Bonifacino J.S. Riezman H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 488-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). For apical targeting, some proteins, such as erythropoietin, require specific N-linked oligosaccharides (20Kitagawa Y. Sano Y. Ueda M. Higashino K. Narita H. Okano M. Matsumoto S.-I. Sasaki R. Exp. Cell Res. 1994; 213: 449-457Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar); other proteins require juxtamembrane segments with clusteredO-linked oligosaccharides or interactions of transmembrane domains or glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchors with the lipid bilayer (21Yeaman C.

Because meprin α does not contain O-linked oligosaccharides, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains are removed in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 during biosynthesis, those features cannot be factors; however, N-linked oligosaccharides are possible targeting moieties.

Mutational analysis, in which potential glycosylation sites were eliminated (see Fig. 1), and inhibitors of biosynthesis and processing of N-linked oligosaccharides were employed for this study. The pcDNAI/Amp plasmid (Invitrogen) containing full-length wild-type mouse meprin α subunit cDNA, the α-(1–528) COOH-terminal truncation mutant, and the MATH deletion (ΔMATH) were described previously (see Fig. 1) (13Tsukuba T. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35260-35267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). These wild-type and mutant cDNAs in pcDNAI/Amp were subcloned into vector pcDNA3.1(+) (Invitrogen) at anEcoRI site to generate expression plasmids. The COOH-terminal truncation mutant α-(1–445) was generated by the polymerase chain reaction using a mutagenic antisense primer (5′-CCGCTCGAGTCATGCAGGGCAGGGGGTTTCTG-3′) that changed the codon of the wild-type transcript at Gly446 to a stop codon. Pfu DNA polymerase (Promega) was used for polymerase chain reactions to minimize base misincorporations. Site-directed mutagenesis was done using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). For each mutant, the Asn residue in the Asn-X-(Ser/Thr) sequence was changed to Gln using mutagenic primers. The selection primer was designed to change aXhoI site in the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3.1(+) to a SalI site for site-directed mutagenesis. All constructs were verified as correct by DNA sequence analyses. MDCK-II cells (ATCC 34 CCL) and human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC 1573 CRL) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin (complete DMEM) in a 37 °C incubator with 5% CO2. The pcDNA3.1(+) expression plasmids containing wild-type or mutant meprin α cDNA (Fig.1) were transfected into MDCK cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method; 10 μg of plasmids were added to cells grown on 100-mm tissue culture plates (Falcon). Twenty-four h after transfection, the cells were treated with trypsin and diluted 1:20 for selection in 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin (G418, Life Technologies, Inc.) to obtain stable transfectants. For transient expression of recombinant wild-type and mutant meprin α, the expression plasmids were transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells by the calcium phosphate precipitation method using 10 μg of expression plasmid and 1 μg of helper plasmid pVA1 per 100-mm tissue culture plate (24Marchand P. Tang J. Johnson G.D. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5449-5456Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Cells were grown to ∼90% confluency by overnight incubation in complete DMEM. The medium was replaced with serum-free Opti-MEM I (Life Technologies, Inc.) and maintained in the incubator for an additional 48 h. The tissue culture media of transfected 293 cells were collected after 48 h of transfection and subjected to centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 20 min. The supernatant fractions were concentrated 10-fold to 500 μl/plate using Centriprep-30 and Microcon-30 concentrators (Amicon, Inc.). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, removed from the plates with a rubber scraper, and subjected to centrifugation at 300 × gfor 5 min. The sedimented cells were suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Triton X-100, sonicated for 1 min at 4 °C, and subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h; the supernatant fraction is referred to as the cell lysate. Stably transfected MDCK cell lines were maintained in complete DMEM containing 0.6 mg/ml Geneticin. To detect polarity of secretion of recombinant wild-type and mutant meprin α, the cells were grown on Millicell-PCF 0.4-μm culture inserts (Millipore Corp.) on six-well plates until a monolayer was formed (3–6 days). Then media were replaced with fresh serum-free Opti-MEM I. After an additional 48 h of incubation, media and cells were collected and prepared as described above. The collected media and cell lysates were subjected to electrophoresis using 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (25Laemmli U.K. Favre M. J. Mol. Biol. 1973; 80: 575-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (3025) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (26Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). The proteins were probed with anti-mouse meprin α polyclonal antibody produced in rabbits. Meprin subunits were detected using the enhanced chemiluminescence method (Pierce). The transfected cells were preincubated for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM lacking methionine and supplemented with 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum. The cells were pulse-labeled for 30–60 min with [35S]methionine/cysteine (100 μCi/ml/dish; ICN Pharmaceuticals) and then incubated in fresh serum-free Opti-MEM I. At the indicated times, the cells were separated from the media; washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline; lysed in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.02% sodium azide, and proteinase inhibitors (100 μg/ml each antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride); and subsequently sonicated for 1 min. The media were subjected to centrifugation at 6500 × gfor 10 min. The cells and media were mixed with 40 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) for 1 h at 4 °C to prevent nonspecific binding of protein A beads and then centrifuged at 6500 × g for 30 min. The supernatant fractions were incubated with 15 μl of anti-mouse meprin α antibody at 37 °C for 10 min and then stored at 4 °C for 16 h. The immunocomplexes were mixed with 40 μl of protein A-Sepharose beads (50% gel suspension; Sigma) for 3 h at 4 °C with gentle agitation. The beads were washed three times with 0.1% SDS containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 200 mm EDTA, and 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5); washed another three times with the same buffer containing 1 m NaCl and 0.1% sodium lauryl sarcosinate; and then washed twice with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0). The sedimented beads were boiled for 5 min at 100 °C with 50 μl of 0.1% SDS containing 0.5 mm EDTA, 5% sucrose, and 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) with 2-mercaptoethanol. For total deglycosylation, the immunoprecipitated or secreted proteins were denatured by boiling for 5 min at 100 °C with 5 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 0.2% SDS. The samples were adjusted to a final concentration of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.0) containing 0.75% Triton X-100 and 100 μg/ml protease inhibitors (antipain, chymostatin, leupeptin, pepstatin, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The mixtures were incubated with 10 milliunits of endoglycosidase H (Endo-H) or 1.0 unit of endoglycosidase F/N-glycosidase F (Endo-F) (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated at 37 °C for 18 h. Reactions were stopped by boiling the samples in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. To investigate the effects of deglycosylation on enzymatic activity, samples containing meprin were incubated with Endo-F as described above, except that no boiling or detergents were included in the protocol. Trypsin (Sigma) was added to the collected media at a final concentration of 1 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) to activate meprin subunits. After incubation at 25 °C for 30 min, soybean trypsin inhibitor (type II-S, Sigma) was added at a 2-fold excess over trypsin. Samples were incubated at 25 °C for 15 min and then kept at 4 °C until analysis. A fluorogenic bradykinin analog (BK+), 2-aminobenzoyl-Arg-Pro-Pro-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg-Lys(dinitrophenyl)-Gly-OH (obtained from Dr. Graham Knight, Strangeways Research Laboratory, Cambridge, United Kingdom), was used as a substrate (26Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For specific activity calculations, the amount of meprin protein in each sample was determined by immunoblotting and densitometry (26Marchand P. Volkmann M. Bond J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24236-24241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). For all determinations of activity, at least two independent sample preparations were used, and values are reported as averages of triplicate assays. MDCK cells stably expressing wild-type mouse meprin α were grown on 100-mm tissue culture plates until a monolayer was formed. Cells were preincubated with or without 2 μg/ml tunicamycin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 18 h and then subjected to pulse-chase experiments. Tunicamycin (2 μg/ml) was maintained in all media during the pulse-chase experiments. To examine the effects of other compounds, MDCK cells stably expressing wild-type mouse meprin α were grown on Millicell-PCF culture inserts on six-well plates until a tight monolayer was formed as determined by microscopic examination. Then cells were preincubated with or without 10 μg/ml BFA (Sigma) or 12 μg/ml colchicine (Calbiochem) for 2 h or with or without 100 μg/ml castanospermine (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) or 5 μg/ml swainsonine (Calbiochem) for 18 h in complete DMEM. After preincubation, the media were replaced with Opti-MEM I with or without each compound at the same concentration and incubated for 24 h. The cells and media were collected, prepared as described above, and subjected to immunoblot analyses. MDCK cells stably transfected with mouse meprin α subunit cDNA were cultured on polycarbonate filters, and apical and basolateral media were analyzed for meprin protein after 24 h (Fig.2). Wild-type meprin A was exclusively secreted into the apical medium with a molecular mass of ∼95 kDa (Fig. 2). When MDCK cells were perturbed by treatment with compounds such as BFA, which impairs vesicular transport, or colchicine, which depolymerizes microtubules, apical sorting of meprin was markedly affected (Fig. 2). In the presence of BFA, 52% of the secreted meprin was found in the apical medium; and in the presence of colchicine, 66% was targeted to the apical medium. There was no indication that these compounds caused cell death or general toxicity from the appearance of cells, and the cytosolic enzyme lactate dehydrogenase was not detectable in the apical or basolateral medium (data not shown). These results indicate that meprin A is normally secreted into the apical medium by a mechanism that requires an intact microtubule network and vesicular transport system. The mouse meprin α subunit contains 10 potentialN-linked oligosaccharide chain sites: Asn41 in the prosequence; Asn152, Asn234, and Asn270 in the protease domain; Asn330 and Asn426 in the MAM domain; Asn452 in the MATH domain; and Asn546, Asn553, and Asn614 in the AM domain (Fig. 1). A series of mouse meprin α mutants were constructed in which Gln was substituted for Asn at the 10 potential N-glycosylation sites. Each of the mutants was stably transfected into MDCK cells, and apical and basolateral media were analyzed by immunoblotting and densitometry. All point mutants were predominantly secreted into the apical medium like the wild-type meprin (Fig. 3). In a few instances, a small amount of meprin α was detectable in the basolateral medium; however, it was never found to be >10% of the total secreted meprin. These results indicate that individualN-linked oligosaccharide chains are not critical determinants of apical targeting. The enzymatic activities of the secreted mutant proteins against BK+ varied over a range of 0.9 ± 0.1 to 5.9 ± 0.8 μmol/min/mg, with the wild-type activity at 3.2 ± 0.4 (Table I). Only one mutant had a higher specific activity and k cat/K mthan the wild-type enzyme, N452Q in the MATH domain. Most of the other mutants had lower activities (28–75% of the wild-type enzyme), except for N553Q, a mutation in the AM domain, where the activity was the same as that of the wild-type enzyme. The decreased activities were not due to degradation of the subunit during trypsin activation, and no differences were noted in susceptibility of the mutants to degradation by higher concentrations of trypsin (up to 100 μg/ml) as determined by densitometry (data not shown). These results indicate that although the individual N-linked oligosaccharides are not essential for activity, Asn41, Asn152, Asn234, Asn270, Asn330, Asn426, Asn546, and Asn614 (in the prosequence, protease, MAM, and AM domains) of the meprin α subunit contribute to optimal enzymatic activity. Partial deglycosylation of secreted wild-type meprin A under nondenaturing conditions also resulted in loss of enzymatic activity against BK+ (Fig.4). In the first four lanes of Fig. 4, meprin samples were activated by trypsin before denaturation and Endo-F treatment. In the last four lanes, the samples were not treated with trypsin before endoglycosidase treatment or gel electrophoresis; they were, however, incubated with trypsin after Endo-F treatment to measure enzymatic activity. Thus, the proenzyme and active enzyme were both exposed to Endo-F. Endo-F completely removedN-linked oligosaccharides after denaturation of meprin subunits, but only partially deglycosylated the subunits under nondenaturing conditions. The proenzyme lost ∼75% activity after Endo-F treatment, whereas the activated enzyme treated with Endo-F had no detectable activity. Thus, partial deglycosylation had marked effects on enzymatic activity.Table IEnzymatic activities of meprin A with point mutations at potential N-glycosylation sitesSpecific activityk cat/K mμmol/min/mgm−1 s−1Wild-type3.2 ± 0.46.5 × 105N41Q1.4 ± 0.21-ap < 0.05 relative to the wild-type protein (by Student's t test).2.8 × 105N152Q0.9 ± 0.11-ap < 0.05 relative to the wild-type protein (by Student's t test).1.7 × 105N234Q2.4 ± 0.34.9 × 105N270Q2.0 ± 0.21-ap < 0.05 relative to the wild-type protein (by Student's t test).4.1 × 105N330Q2.1 ± 0.31-ap < 0.05 relative to the wild-type protein (by Student's t test).4.3 × 105N426Q1.4 ± 0.31-ap < 0.05 relative to the wild-type protein (by Student's t test).2.8 × 105N452Q5.9 ± 0.81-ap < 0.05 relative to the wild-type protein (by Student's t test).12.0 × 105N546Q2.2 ± 0.31-ap < 0.05 relative to the wild-type protein (by Student's t test).4.5 × 105N553Q3.3 ± 0.46.7 × 105N614Q1.6 ± 0.21-ap < 0.05 relative to the wild-type protein (by Student's t test).3.3 × 105Prior to assays, wild-type and mutant zymogens were activated by limited trypsin digestion as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The values are averages of triplicate assays using BK+ as substrate.

Differences in vulnerability to heat inactivation were observed between the wild-type protein and some meprin α potentialN-glycosylation site mutants (Fig.5). Wild-type meprin A retained ∼55% activity against BK+ after incubation at 55 °C for 20 min. Similar results were obtained for six of the Asn mutants: N41Q, N330Q, N426Q, N452Q, N546Q, and N553Q. However, mutants N234Q, N270Q, and N614Q were ∼90% inactive after 20 min of incubation at 55 °C. The N152Q mutant was the most unstable mutant and lost 94% activity in 5 min at 55 °C. These results indicate that the mutations at Asn152, Asn234, and Asn270 in the protease domain and at Asn614 in the AM domain decrease thermal stability of the protein. To examine the role of N-linked oligosaccharides of meprin α in biosynthesis, pulse-chase experiments with or without tunicamycin were performed (Fig.6). Tunicamycin inhibits the first step of the N-glycosylation pathway, i.e. the transfer of GlcNAc-1-P from UDP-GlcNAc to dolichol-P to form dolichyl-P2-GlcNAc (27Tkacz J.S. Lampen J.O. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1975; 65: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar). The wild-type meprin α subunit was synthesized as an ∼100-kDa protein in MDCK cells, processed to a 95-kDa protein, and then gradually secreted into the medium. When treated with tunicamycin, the meprin α proteins associated with cells had a molecular mass of ∼75 kDa; however, the expression level was markedly decreased, and the protein was not detected in the medium. Tunicamycin markedly decreased the biosynthesis and secretion of meprin α into the medium. Castanospermine, an inhibitor of glucosidases I and II in the ER, and swainsonine, an inhibitor of mannosidase II in the Golgi complex, had little if any effect on sorting and secretion of meprin α in MDCK cells (Fig. 7). In the presence of castanospermine, the wild-type meprin α subunit was exclusively secreted into the apical medium. Upon treatment with swainsonine, 88% of the protein was secreted into the apical medium. The wild-type meprin α subunit was resistant to Endo-H, but sensitive to Endo-F, indicating that it was secreted as a protein containing complex-type oligosaccharide chains (Fig. 7 B). The Endo-F treatment decreased the molecular mass of the wild-type protein from 95 to 75 kDa, as previously observed. When treated with O-glycosidase and neuraminidase, no bands with greater mobility were observed (data not shown), confirming that the meprin α subunits do not containO-linked or sialylated oligosaccharides. After treatment with castanospermine, the secreted protein was sensitive to Endo-H and Endo-F, indicating that the subunit contains high mannose-type oligosaccharides. When incubated with swainsonine, the deglycosylated protein with Endo-H migrated slower on gels than that with Endo-F, indicating that it has hybrid-type oligosaccharides (Fig.7 B). The high mannose-type proteins (secreted in the presence of castanospermine) and"
https://openalex.org/W1856218379,"Platelet-type von Willebrand disease is a bleeding disorder resulting from gain-of-function mutations of glycoprotein (GP) Ibalpha that increase its affinity for von Willebrand factor (vWf). The two known naturally occurring mutations, G233V and M239V, both enrich the valine content of an already valine-rich region within the Cys(209)-Cys(248) disulfide loop. We tested the effect of converting other non-valine residues in this region to valine. Of 10 mutants expressed in CHO cells as components of GP Ib-IX complexes, four displayed a gain-of-function phenotype (G233V, D235V, K237V, and M239V) based on (125)I-vWf binding and adhesion to immobilized vWf. The remainder displayed loss-of-function phenotypes. The gain-of-function mutants bound vWf spontaneously and had a heightened response to low concentrations of ristocetin or botrocetin, whereas the loss-of-function mutants bound vWf more poorly than wild-type GP Ibalpha. No distinct gain- or loss-of-function conformations were identified with conformation-sensitive antibodies. Compared with cells expressing wild-type GP Ibalpha, cells expressing the gain-of-function mutants rolled significantly more slowly over immobilized vWf under flow than wild-type cells and were able to adhere to vWf coated at lower densities. In aggregate, these data indicate that the region of GP Ibalpha bounded by Asn(226) and Ala(244) regulates the affinity for vWf."
https://openalex.org/W2032150595,"The interaction between plastocyanin and the intact cytochrome bf complex, both from spinach, has been studied by stopped-flow kinetics with mutant plastocyanin to elucidate the site of electron transfer and the docking regions of the molecule. Mutation of Tyr-83 to Arg or Leu provides no evidence for a second electron transfer path via Tyr-83 of plastocyanin, which has been proposed to be the site of electron transfer from cytochromef. The data found with mutations of acidic residues indicate that both conserved negative patches are essential for the binding of plastocyanin to the intact cytochrome bfcomplex. Replacing Ala-90 and Gly-10 at the flat hydrophobic surface of plastocyanin by larger residues slowed down and accelerated, respectively, the rate of electron transfer as compared with wild-type plastocyanin. These opposing effects reveal that the hydrophobic region around the electron transfer site at His-87 is divided up into two regions, of which only that with Ala-90 contributes to the attachment to the cytochrome bf complex. These binding sites of plastocyanin are substantially different from those interacting with photosystem I. It appears that each of the two binding regions of plastocyanin is split into halves, which are used in different combinations in the molecular recognition at the two membrane complexes."

Although Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 coassemble with different SUR isoforms to form heteromultimeric functionalK ATP channels, it is not known whether Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 coassemble with each other. To define the molecular identity of K ATP channels, we used adenoviral gene transfer to express wild-type and dominant-negative constructs of Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 in a heterologous expression system (A549 cells) and in native cells (rabbit ventricular myocytes). Dominant-negative (DN) Kir6.2 gene transfer suppressed current through heterologously expressed SUR2A + Kir6.2 channels.

Previous work has shown that smooth muscleK ATP channels consist of Kir6.1 subunits and SUR2B subunits. In addition, immunogold staining has localized Kir6.1 to the inner mitochondrial membrane in skeletal muscle (18.Suzuki M. Kotake K. Fujikura K. Inagaki N. Suzuki T. Gonoi T. Seino S. Takata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Recently, Baron et al. (19.Baron A. van Bever L. Monnier D. Roatti A. Baertschi A.J. Circ. Res. 1999; 85: 707-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) have used pharmacological and molecular studies to argue that K ATP channels in neonatal atrial myocytes are formed by the heteromultimeric association of several SUR and/or Kir subtypes. Whereas both Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 were found to be expressed in these cells, their relative contribution to the formation of functional K ATP channels is not known. Different SUR isoforms can clearly coassemble with either Kir6.1 or Kir6.2; however, it is not known whether Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 coassemble with each other. To investigate the assembly of this channel, we used viral vectors designed to overexpress wild-type or dominant-negative Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 constructs driven by inducible ecdysone promoters in a heterologous expression system (A549 cells) and in adult rabbit ventricular myocytes. The electrical properties of K ATPchannels in these cells lead us to conclude that Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 do not form functional heteromultimers. The coding sequence for mouse Kir6.1 (or rabbit Kir6.2) was amplified using a polymerase chain reaction and cloned into pGFP-IRES (20.Johns D.C. Nuss H.B. Marbán E. J. Biol.

Site-directed mutagenesis was performed using a QuikChangeTM kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to modify codons 142 and 144 of wild-type mouse Kir6.1 (Kir6.1WT) to code for alanines instead of glycines to generate Kir6.1AFA (Fig.1 A). Similarly, wild-type rabbit Kir6.2 (Kir6.2WT) codons 131 and 133 were modified to code for alanines instead of glycines to generate mutant Kir6.2AFA. The wild-type and mutant Kir genes were cloned into a polycistronic adenovirus shuttle vector with ecdysone-inducible promoter coexpressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (pAdEGI) or human CD8 protein (pAdECD8I) to generate the modified vectors (21.Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marbán E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant adenoviruses containing the various Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 constructs were generated by Cre-lox recombination as described previously (21.Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marbán E.

Cells were cultured on laminin-coated coverslips in M199 culture medium (CellGro; Mediatech, Herndon, VA) with 2% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 °C. A human epithelial cell line A549 (CCL-185, American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cotransfected with 1 μg of rabbit Kir6.2 and rat SUR2A (a gift of Dr. S. Seino, Chiba University School of Medicine, Chiba, Japan) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) before infecting with various virus constructs. The virus constructs were coinfected with either the Kir or reporter-only virus and the receptor virus AdVgRXR at a ratio of about 10:1 as described previously (21.Johns D.C. Marx R. Mains R.E. O'Rourke B. Marbán E. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1691-1697Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After about 1 h the cells were washed with virus-free culture medium. Expression was induced by the addition of 1 μmponasterone A (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) for up to 72 h before electrophysiological studies were conducted. We also transfected A549 cells using 6 μg of mouse Kir6.1 and mouse SUR2B (both gifts from Dr. Y. Kurachi, University of Osaka, Osaka, Japan) and LipofectAMINE before infecting as described above. Myocytes were cultured in 2% fetal bovine serum-containing M199 media and infected with various reporter and Kir constructs and induced for 72 h after infection before measuring the currents. To quantify K ATPchannel activity, we measured agonist-induced membrane current using the whole-cell patch clamp technique (24.Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15149) Google Scholar). Cells were superfused with external solution containing (in mm) NaCl, 140; KCl, 5; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; and HEPES, 10 (pH 7.4) with NaOH at room temperature (∼22 °C). The internal pipette solution contained (in mm) potassium glutamate, 120; KCl, 25; MgCl2, 0.5; EGTA, 10; HEPES, 10; and MgATP, 1 (pH 7.2) with KOH. Currents were elicited by ramp pulses in A549 cells (between −110 and 50 mV from a holding potential of −80 mV). The current amplitude at 0 mV was measured at steady state after the application of theK ATP channel agonist P1075 (pinacidil analog, 30 μm). In rabbit ventricular myocytes, currents were elicited every 6 s by square pulses (in consecutive steps from a holding potential of −80 mV to −40 mV for 100 ms and 0 mV for 380 ms), and I K, ATP was quantified 15 and 30 min after exposure to 100 μm pinacidil. To be sure that the currents measured reflected agonist-induced K ATPchannels, we excluded experiments in which pinacidil-induced currents were irreversible after washout of drugs (8 cells), although including those data would not have changed the conclusions. Preliminary experiments revealed that 48–72 h were required to obtain robust dominant-negative effects; therefore, electrophysiological recordings were made 72 h after infection in both A549 cells and rabbit ventricular myocytes. All data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was performed by analysis of variance combined with the Bonferroni pairwise comparison test when needed.p values <0.05 were considered significant. We have previously shown that dominant-negative Kir6.2 constructs suppress K ATP current in heterologous expression systems and in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (11.Lalli M.J. Johns D.C. Janecki M. Liu Y. O'Rourke B. Marbán E. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1998; 436: 957-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Thus, we predicted that infection with AdKir6.2AFA would suppress the cardiac sarcolemmalK ATP current (Fig.1 A). To address the question of heteromultimerization of the Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 subunits, we examined the effects of infection with various Kir and control virus constructs on I K, ATP A549 cells cotransfected with 6.2WT and SUR2A subunits. I K, ATP was elicited pharmacologically by addition of the pinacidil derivative P1075, which potently activates these channels (25.Sato, T., Sasaki, N., Seharaseyon, J., O'Rourke, B., and Marbán, E. (2000) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar). Fig.2, A–D shows typical membrane currents recorded in A549 cells 72 h post-transfection, in the absence (control) and presence of P1075. Panel A shows the wild-type current expressed by Kir6.2 and SUR2A. Fig. 2, B–D shows currents after cotransfection and infection with 6.1AFA (B), CD8 (C), or 6.2AFA (D) viral constructs. Only the 6.2AFA cell (D) shows notably suppressed drug-activated currents. Fig. 2 E summarizes the data for P1075-induced current in the various groups of A549 cells. The uninfected cells had current densities similar to those infected with CD8 reporter virus, indicating that infection itself does not alter the membrane currents. Significant dominant-negative suppression of I K,ATP through Kir6.2-SUR2A channels was achieved by infection with the Kir6.2AFA virus (p < 0.001 versuscontrol) but not with Kir6.1AFA. To verify that Kir6.1AFA can function as a dominant-negative construct in Kir6.1 homomultimers, we heterologously expressed Kir6.1 + SUR2B channels. Kir6.1 and SUR2B have been reported to form smooth muscle-type K ATP channels (26.Isomoto S. Kondo C. Yamada M. Matsumoto S. Higashiguchi O. Horio Y. Matsuzawa Y. Kurachi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24321-24324Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 27.Yamada M. Isomoto S. Matsumoto S. Kondo C. Shindo T. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 715-720Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar). As with Kir6.2 and SUR2A, we measured membrane currents elicited by theK ATP channel opener P1075. Fig.3, A–D showsI K, ATP recorded in A549 cells 72 h after transfection, before and during exposure to P1075. Panel A shows the current produced by simple cotransfection with Kir6.1 and SUR2B DNA. Fig. 3, B–D shows the currents after cotransfection and infection with 6.1AFA (B), CD8 (C), or 6.2AFA (D) viral constructs. Here, the only permutation with suppressed P1075-inducible current was 6.1AFA (B). The pooled data in Fig. 3 E reveal that infection with 6.1AFA significantly inhibited I K, ATP through Kir6.1 + SUR2B channels (p < 0.005 versus either no virus or CD8), but there was no effect of Kir6.2AFA. The whole-cell currents produced by heterologously expressed Kir6.1 + SUR2B are about half as large as those produced by Kir6.2 + SUR2A channels (0.75 ± 0.2 versus 1.7 ± 0.3 nA at 0 mV). However, the number of functional channels is likely to be comparable, considering the known difference in single-channel conductance of the two channels (35 versus 80 picosiemens; Refs. 5.Inagaki N.

Matsumoto S. Kondo C. Shindo T. Horio Y. Kurachi Y. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1997; 499: 715-720Crossref Scopus (343) Google Scholar) and assuming similar open probabilities. Thus, the lack of suppression by the 6.1AFA construct on 6.2WT + SUR2A coexpressed current (and, conversely, the lack of effect of 6.2AFA on 6.1WT + SUR2B current) is most likely due to the absence of coassembly. To probe the roles of Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 in native cells, we infected these viral constructs in adult ventricular myocytes in primary culture. Whole-cell patch recordings revealed thatK ATP current was greatly suppressed at 72 h in Kir6.2AFA-infected cells compared with green fluorescent protein-, 6.2WT-, 6.1WT-, or 6.1AFA-infected cells in primary culture. Fig.4 summarizes the current densities measured 15 and 30 min after exposure to pinacidil in cells infected with all the viral constructs tested. Note that 6.2AFA-infected cells displayed pinacidil-induced current densities significantly lower than the others (at 30 min, 11.3 ± 2.7 picoampere/picofarad,n = 7 versus control, 36.8 ± 4.1 picoampere/picofarad, n = 6, p < 0.01). None of the other constructs had any effect onK ATP current density, indicating that infection with 6.2AFA significantly suppressed the native sarcolemmalK ATP current in rabbit ventricular cells. Whereas the results are clear-cut at 72 h, no effect was evident at 24 h, and only a trend was apparent at 48 h (data not shown). This time course is consistent with that described for effective suppression of other K+ channels by dominant-negative constructs in myocytes and neurons (20.Johns D.C. Nuss H.B. Marbán E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31598-31603Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The length of time required for effective suppression presumably reflects the time required for the assembly of the non-functional tetramer relative to the degradation of previously synthesized functional channels. The results are notable in several respects. First of all, they confirm that Kir6.2 is crucial for cardiac surface K ATPchannels. Second, the absence of an effect of exogenous wild-type Kir6.2 expression on the surface K ATP channel indicates that the availability of Kir6.2 is not a rate-limiting factor in the biogenesis of these channels (as might be the case if there were a reserve store of presynthesized but unpaired SUR2 proteins). Third, the lack of an effect of Kir6.1WT or Kir6.1AFA on the sarcolemmalK ATP channels, taken together with the lack of suppression of 6.1AFA on the heterologously expressed Kir6.2 + SUR2A channel, and of 6.2AFA on Kir6.1 + SUR2B channels, indicate that Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 do not form functional heteromultimers either in A549 cells or in native cardiac myocytes. The latter finding leaves open the question of what role, if any, Kir6.1 may play in heart cells. Specifically, the present experiments do not exclude a role for Kir6.1 in the formation of mitoK ATP channels (18.Suzuki M. Kotake K. Fujikura K. Inagaki N. Suzuki T. Gonoi T. Seino S. Takata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 693-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), which are crucial for the endogenous cardioprotective phenomenon known as ischemic preconditioning (25.Sato, T., Sasaki, N., Seharaseyon, J., O'Rourke, B., and Marbán, E. (2000) Circulation, in pressGoogle Scholar). Dominant-negative approaches similar to those used here in myocytes, but with mitochondrial flavoprotein fluorescence as the end point, may help to address possible contributions of Kir6.1 and/or 6.2 to mitoK ATP channels.

To examine the basis for this ordered release, we synthesized A′β fibrinogen, replacing FpB with a fibrinopeptide A-like peptide, FpA′ (G14V). Analyses of fibrinopeptide release from A′β fibrinogen showed that FpA release and FpA′ release were similar; the release of either peptide followed simple first-order kinetics. Specificity constants for FpA and FpA′ were similar, demonstrating that these peptides are equally competitive substrates for thrombin. In the presence of Gly-Pro-Arg-Pro, an inhibitor of fibrin polymerization, the rate of FpB release from normal fibrinogen was reduced 3-fold, consistent with previous data; in contrast, the rate of FpA′ release from A′β fibrinogen was unaffected. Thus, with A′β fibrinogen, fibrinopeptide release from the β chain is similar to fibrinopeptide release from the α chain. We conclude that the ordered release of fibrinopeptides is dictated by the specificity of thrombin for its substrates. We analyzed polymerization, following changes in turbidity, and found that polymerization of A′β fibrinogen was similar to that of normal fibrinogen. We analyzed clot structure by scanning electron microscopy and found that clots from A′β fibrinogen were similar to clots from normal fibrinogen.

Fibrinogen consists of two pairs of three polypeptide chains (Aα, Bβ, and γ) that fold to produce a trinodular protein with two distal (D) nodules connected to a central nodule (E) by coiled-coil regions. The central nodule of the molecule consists of the N termini of all six polypeptide chains, and the D nodules consist predominantly of the C termini of the β and γ chains, each folded into a globular domain. To initiate polymerization, the serine protease thrombin cleaves four specific Arg–Gly bonds at the N termini of both the Aα and Bβ chains, releasing fibrinopeptides A (FpA)1 and B (FpB), respectively. The release of FpA, a 16-residue peptide, exposes the “A” site, which noncovalently interacts with the “a” site in the γ chain of the D nodule of another molecule. This A:a interaction results in the linear arrangement of half-staggered, double-stranded protofibrils (1Ferry J.D. Morrison P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1947; 69: 388-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The release of FpB, a 14-residue peptide, exposes the “B” site (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L.

Veerapandian L. Doolittle R.F. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 2941-2946Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). This B:b interaction is thought to be responsible for lateral aggregation of protofibrils to form fibers (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and to be analogous to the A:a interaction; however, the mechanism of this interaction is not yet well understood. The final product of this polymerization is a complex, branching network of fibers.The interactions of thrombin with fibrinogen have been extensively studied (Refs. 6Hogg D.H. Blomback B. Thromb. Res. 1978; 12: 953-964Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar and 7Kaminski M. McDonagh J. J. Biol.

Thrombin contains three domains that interact with fibrinogen: the active site, an apolar specificity pocket, and a fibrinogen-binding exosite. The exosite, also called the fibrinogen recognition site, confers the specificity with which thrombin binds to fibrinogen. Upon binding, thrombin cleaves FpA and initiates polymerization. FpA release from fibrinogen follows first-order kinetics, described by the kinetic constantk 1. In contrast, FpB is released from fibrinogen at a slow initial rate (3Hurlet-Jensen A. Cummins H.Z.

This efficient release of FpB, subsequent to FpA release, follows first-order kinetics and is described by the kinetic constantk 2, assuming that the release of fibrinopeptides A and B from thrombin occurs through two successive first-order processes.Crystallographic data have depicted the contacts between FpA and thrombin (12Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Myr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); but, to date, similar data are not available for thrombin and FpB. The sequence of FpB is different from that of FpA (13Henschen A. Lottspeich F. Kehl M. Southan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) such that FpB should require different contacts with thrombin (12Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Myr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Because we do not have structural information, our understanding of FpB release is indirect and based on kinetic studies that examined the timing of FpB release. These studies have shown that the majority of FpB is released from fibrin after FpA has been removed (3Hurlet-Jensen A. Cummins H.Z. Nossel H.L. Liu C.Y. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Higgins D.L. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9276-9282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the rate of FpB release is enhanced upon polymerization of des-A polymers (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hurlet-Jensen A. Cummins H.Z. Nossel H.L. Liu C.Y. Thromb.

To date, however, the mechanism responsible for the delay in FpB release remains undetermined.To extend our understanding of the mechanism of thrombin on fibrinopeptide B and its resulting effect on polymerization, we have designed a variant recombinant fibrinogen (A′β) that contains a fibrinopeptide A-like substrate on the N termini of the β chains. This fibrinogen was designed to probe the mechanism of fibrinopeptide release and more specifically to determine whether the delayed release of FpB is a consequence of its affinity for thrombin or of its location on the N terminus of the β chain. Our studies have revealed that it is the specificity of thrombin for FpB that is responsible for the order of fibrinopeptide release during fibrin polymerization.DISCUSSIONWe have synthesized a recombinant fibrinogen (A′β) to determine what effect the substitution of FpA′ on the N terminus of the β chain has on the kinetics of fibrinopeptide release. The release of FpA and FpA′ from A′β fibrinogen occurred from the beginning of the reaction and followed first-order kinetics, indicating that both FpA and FpA′ are equally competitive substrates for thrombin and have cleavage sites that are accessible to thrombin at the beginning of the reaction. Thus, the assumption used to characterize FpB release, that FpB release depends on prior FpA release, does not accurately describe the release of FpA′ from A′β fibrinogen. In addition, the similar rate of release of either FpA′ or FpB from the β chain indicates that despite the fibrinopeptide placed on the N terminus of the β chain, the rate of cleavage of the Arg–Gly bond by thrombin remains constant. Taken together, we conclude that it is thrombin, in its interaction with FpB, that is responsible for the delay in efficient FpB release during fibrin polymerization, i.e. the specificity of thrombin for FpB, and not its location on the N terminus of the β chain, accounts for the kinetics of fibrinopeptide release from fibrinogen.Additional experiments support the conclusion that FpA′ release from A′β fibrinogen is dictated by thrombin specificity and not fibrin polymerization. We found that FpA′ release is qualitatively different from FpB release from normal fibrinogen, indicating that the release of FpA′ from the β chain is not dependent on prior polymerization of des-A monomers. This conclusion is supported by our studies in the presence or absence of GPRP, an inhibitor of fibrin polymerization. Our results showed that FpB release was impaired in the presence of GPRP, whereas FpA′ release was not affected. Together, these results indicate that FpA′ release from A′β fibrinogen is independent of fibrin polymerization. Thus, we have created a fibrinogen in which the delay in the rate enhancement of fibrinopeptide release from the β chain has been eliminated.We present the following models of the interaction of thrombin with fibrinogen, which accommodate our findings with A′β and normal fibrinogens. Initially, thrombin is oriented such that all three fibrinogen interaction sites (the apolar specificity pocket, fibrinogen-binding exosite, and active site) are aligned to accommodate FpA as the preferred substrate. Upon binding to A′β fibrinogen, thrombin is best suited for FpA or FpA′ cleavage, regardless of the placement of the peptide on the α or β chain; thus, all four fibrinopeptides are cleaved simultaneously and with similar affinity. In normal fibrinogen, the thrombin active site is specific for FpA, cleaving it efficiently to initiate polymerization, whereas thrombin cleavage of FpB is much less efficient. During polymerization, however, efficient cleavage of FpB becomes favorable, i.e. FpB release becomes more efficient upon the appearance of des-A polymers (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hurlet-Jensen A. Cummins H.Z. Nossel H.L. Liu C.Y. Thromb.

We propose two possible mechanisms, as depicted in Fig.8, for this shift to efficient cleavage of FpB. Either 1) upon the release of FpA, thrombin changes its conformation such that FpB can be accommodated and cleaved efficiently, or 2) the local conformation of FpB is altered over the course of polymerization, which correctly orients the Arg14–Gly15 bond for efficient cleavage within the active site of thrombin.Although our results do not give us reason to favor one possibility over the other, previous studies lend credence to both. Studies on thrombin binding to exosite-binding fragments of hirudin, heparin cofactor II, and the thrombin receptor have shown that exosite interaction can allosterically modify the active site of thrombin (28Naski M.C.

Because thrombin binds to fibrinogen in the exosite, it is possible that conformational changes that occur in fibrinogen during polymerization can indirectly affect the thrombin active site. Alternatively, conformational changes in the fibrinogen molecule have been proposed (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L.

Life Sci. 1997; 53: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) during fibrin polymerization, and these changes could reposition the E domain such that the scissile bond in FpB is properly oriented for efficient cleavage by thrombin. Whether it is conformational changes in fibrinopeptide B, thrombin, or both, these studies suggest that either model is possible and reemphasize that we can only conclude from our studies that it is the specificity of thrombin for the fibrinopeptides that dictates the rate and timing of their release.Production of A′β fibrinogen also allowed us to evaluate the effect of early exposure of the B site on fibrin polymerization. If early exposure of the B site did affect polymerization, we would expect a polymerization curve similar to that for fibrin monomer polymerization, when the A and B sites are exposed from the start of the reaction. Our results did not follow this pattern, thus suggesting that exposure of the B site alone does not directly influence polymerization. Rather, the participation of the B site in polymerization likely depends on certain polymerization events. Previous studies (33Hantgan R.R. Hermans J. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 11272-11281Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 37Weisel J.W. Nagaswami C. Biophys. J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) suggest that this event is the polymerization of des-A monomers to form protofibrils of a critical length.In summary, by making this fibrinogen with essentially four fibrinopeptides A, we have synthesized a model substrate that eliminated the delay in fibrinopeptide release from the β chain. Thus, the normal delay in fibrinopeptide B release likely arises from a specific interaction between thrombin and FpB. We therefore conclude that the kinetics of fibrinopeptide release are dictated by the affinity of thrombin for its substrates. In addition, our work suggests that early exposure of the B site does not affect the polymerization process. Fibrinogen is a 340-kDa plasma protein that is involved in the final phase of the coagulation cascade. Fibrinogen consists of two pairs of three polypeptide chains (Aα, Bβ, and γ) that fold to produce a trinodular protein with two distal (D) nodules connected to a central nodule (E) by coiled-coil regions. The central nodule of the molecule consists of the N termini of all six polypeptide chains, and the D nodules consist predominantly of the C termini of the β and γ chains, each folded into a globular domain. To initiate polymerization, the serine protease thrombin cleaves four specific Arg–Gly bonds at the N termini of both the Aα and Bβ chains, releasing fibrinopeptides A (FpA)1 and B (FpB), respectively. The release of FpA, a 16-residue peptide, exposes the “A” site, which noncovalently interacts with the “a” site in the γ chain of the D nodule of another molecule. This A:a interaction results in the linear arrangement of half-staggered, double-stranded protofibrils (1Ferry J.D. Morrison P.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1947; 69: 388-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The release of FpB, a 14-residue peptide, exposes the “B” site (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L.

The final product of this polymerization is a complex, branching network of fibers. The interactions of thrombin with fibrinogen have been extensively studied (Refs. 6Hogg D.H. Blomback B. Thromb.

Thrombin contains three domains that interact with fibrinogen: the active site, an apolar specificity pocket, and a fibrinogen-binding exosite. The exosite, also called the fibrinogen recognition site, confers the specificity with which thrombin binds to fibrinogen. Upon binding, thrombin cleaves FpA and initiates polymerization. FpA release from fibrinogen follows first-order kinetics, described by the kinetic constantk 1. In contrast, FpB is released from fibrinogen at a slow initial rate (3Hurlet-Jensen A. Cummins H.Z.

Invest. 1981; 67: 809-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) and the depletion of FpA as a substrate for thrombin. This efficient release of FpB, subsequent to FpA release, follows first-order kinetics and is described by the kinetic constantk 2, assuming that the release of fibrinopeptides A and B from thrombin occurs through two successive first-order processes. Crystallographic data have depicted the contacts between FpA and thrombin (12Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Myr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar); but, to date, similar data are not available for thrombin and FpB. The sequence of FpB is different from that of FpA (13Henschen A. Lottspeich F. Kehl M. Southan C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1983; 408: 28-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) such that FpB should require different contacts with thrombin (12Stubbs M.T. Oschkinat H. Myr I. Huber R. Angliker H. Stone S.R. Bode W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 206: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Because we do not have structural information, our understanding of FpB release is indirect and based on kinetic studies that examined the timing of FpB release. These studies have shown that the majority of FpB is released from fibrin after FpA has been removed (3Hurlet-Jensen A. Cummins H.Z. Nossel H.L. Liu C.Y. Thromb. Res. 1982; 27: 419-427Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 14Higgins D.L. Lewis S.D. Shafer J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 9276-9282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and that the rate of FpB release is enhanced upon polymerization of des-A polymers (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hurlet-Jensen A. Cummins H.Z. Nossel H.L. Liu C.Y. Thromb.

To date, however, the mechanism responsible for the delay in FpB release remains undetermined. To extend our understanding of the mechanism of thrombin on fibrinopeptide B and its resulting effect on polymerization, we have designed a variant recombinant fibrinogen (A′β) that contains a fibrinopeptide A-like substrate on the N termini of the β chains. This fibrinogen was designed to probe the mechanism of fibrinopeptide release and more specifically to determine whether the delayed release of FpB is a consequence of its affinity for thrombin or of its location on the N terminus of the β chain. Our studies have revealed that it is the specificity of thrombin for FpB that is responsible for the order of fibrinopeptide release during fibrin polymerization. DISCUSSIONWe have synthesized a recombinant fibrinogen (A′β) to determine what effect the substitution of FpA′ on the N terminus of the β chain has on the kinetics of fibrinopeptide release. The release of FpA and FpA′ from A′β fibrinogen occurred from the beginning of the reaction and followed first-order kinetics, indicating that both FpA and FpA′ are equally competitive substrates for thrombin and have cleavage sites that are accessible to thrombin at the beginning of the reaction. Thus, the assumption used to characterize FpB release, that FpB release depends on prior FpA release, does not accurately describe the release of FpA′ from A′β fibrinogen. In addition, the similar rate of release of either FpA′ or FpB from the β chain indicates that despite the fibrinopeptide placed on the N terminus of the β chain, the rate of cleavage of the Arg–Gly bond by thrombin remains constant. Taken together, we conclude that it is thrombin, in its interaction with FpB, that is responsible for the delay in efficient FpB release during fibrin polymerization, i.e. the specificity of thrombin for FpB, and not its location on the N terminus of the β chain, accounts for the kinetics of fibrinopeptide release from fibrinogen.Additional experiments support the conclusion that FpA′ release from A′β fibrinogen is dictated by thrombin specificity and not fibrin polymerization. We found that FpA′ release is qualitatively different from FpB release from normal fibrinogen, indicating that the release of FpA′ from the β chain is not dependent on prior polymerization of des-A monomers. This conclusion is supported by our studies in the presence or absence of GPRP, an inhibitor of fibrin polymerization. Our results showed that FpB release was impaired in the presence of GPRP, whereas FpA′ release was not affected. Together, these results indicate that FpA′ release from A′β fibrinogen is independent of fibrin polymerization. Thus, we have created a fibrinogen in which the delay in the rate enhancement of fibrinopeptide release from the β chain has been eliminated.We present the following models of the interaction of thrombin with fibrinogen, which accommodate our findings with A′β and normal fibrinogens. Initially, thrombin is oriented such that all three fibrinogen interaction sites (the apolar specificity pocket, fibrinogen-binding exosite, and active site) are aligned to accommodate FpA as the preferred substrate. Upon binding to A′β fibrinogen, thrombin is best suited for FpA or FpA′ cleavage, regardless of the placement of the peptide on the α or β chain; thus, all four fibrinopeptides are cleaved simultaneously and with similar affinity. In normal fibrinogen, the thrombin active site is specific for FpA, cleaving it efficiently to initiate polymerization, whereas thrombin cleavage of FpB is much less efficient. During polymerization, however, efficient cleavage of FpB becomes favorable, i.e. FpB release becomes more efficient upon the appearance of des-A polymers (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L. Nature. 1978; 275: 501-505Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Hurlet-Jensen A. Cummins H.Z. Nossel H.L. Liu C.Y. Thromb.

We propose two possible mechanisms, as depicted in Fig.8, for this shift to efficient cleavage of FpB. Either 1) upon the release of FpA, thrombin changes its conformation such that FpB can be accommodated and cleaved efficiently, or 2) the local conformation of FpB is altered over the course of polymerization, which correctly orients the Arg14–Gly15 bond for efficient cleavage within the active site of thrombin.Although our results do not give us reason to favor one possibility over the other, previous studies lend credence to both. Studies on thrombin binding to exosite-binding fragments of hirudin, heparin cofactor II, and the thrombin receptor have shown that exosite interaction can allosterically modify the active site of thrombin (28Naski M.C.

Because thrombin binds to fibrinogen in the exosite, it is possible that conformational changes that occur in fibrinogen during polymerization can indirectly affect the thrombin active site. Alternatively, conformational changes in the fibrinogen molecule have been proposed (2Blomback B. Hessel B. Hogg D. Therkildsen L.

Life Sci. 1997; 53: 29-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) during fibrin polymerization, and these changes could reposition the E domain such that the scissile bond in FpB is properly oriented for efficient cleavage by thrombin. Whether it is conformational changes in fibrinopeptide B, thrombin, or both, these studies suggest that either model is possible and reemphasize that we can only conclude from our studies that it is the specificity of thrombin for the fibrinopeptides that dictates the rate and timing of their release.Production of A′β fibrinogen also allowed us to evaluate the effect of early exposure of the B site on fibrin polymerization. If early exposure of the B site did affect polymerization, we would expect a polymerization curve similar to that for fibrin monomer polymerization, when the A and B sites are exposed from the start of the reaction. Our results did not follow this pattern, thus suggesting that exposure of the B site alone does not directly influence polymerization. Rather, the participation of the B site in polymerization likely depends on certain polymerization events. Previous studies (33Hantgan R.R. Hermans J. J. Biol.

J. 1992; 63: 111-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) suggest that this event is the polymerization of des-A monomers to form protofibrils of a critical length.In summary, by making this fibrinogen with essentially four fibrinopeptides A, we have synthesized a model substrate that eliminated the delay in fibrinopeptide release from the β chain. Thus, the normal delay in fibrinopeptide B release likely arises from a specific interaction between thrombin and FpB. We therefore conclude that the kinetics of fibrinopeptide release are dictated by the affinity of thrombin for its substrates. In addition, our work suggests that early exposure of the B site does not affect the polymerization process. We have synthesized a recombinant fibrinogen (A′β) to determine what effect the substitution of FpA′ on the N terminus of the β chain has on the kinetics of fibrinopeptide release. The release of FpA and FpA′ from A′β fibrinogen occurred from the beginning of the reaction and followed first-order kinetics, indicating that both FpA and FpA′ are equally competitive substrates for thrombin and have cleavage sites that are accessible to thrombin at the beginning of the reaction. Thus, the assumption used to characterize FpB release, that FpB release depends on prior FpA release, does not accurately describe the release of FpA′ from A′β fibrinogen.

https://openalex.org/W2090893920,"Sialomucin complex (SMC, rat Muc4) is a heterodimeric glycoprotein complex consisting of a mucin subunit ASGP-1 (for ascitessialoglycoprotein-1) and a transmembrane subunit ASGP-2, produced from a single gene and precursor. SMC expression is tightly regulated in mammary gland; the level in lactating mammary gland is about 100-fold that in virgin gland. In rat mammary epithelial cells, SMC is post-transcriptionally regulated by Matrigel by inhibition of SMC precursor synthesis. SMC is also post-transcriptionally regulated by transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ). The repression of SMC expression by TGFβ is rapid, is independent of TGFβ-induced cell cycle arrest, and does not require new protein synthesis. Unlike Matrigel, TGFβ does not reduce SMC protein synthesis, as SMC precursor accumulation is equivalent in TGFβ-treated and untreated cells. Instead, SMC precursor in TGFβ-treated cells is more persistent and does not become processed as rapidly into mature ASGP-1 and ASGP-2, indicating that TGFβ disrupts processing of SMC precursor. These results indicate that SMC, a product of normal mammary gland and milk, is regulated by TGFβ by a novel post-translational mechanism. Thus, SMC is regulated by multiple post-transcriptional mechanisms, which serve to repress potential deleterious effects of overexpression."
https://openalex.org/W2058653196,"The Fe protein of nitrogenase has three separate functions. Much is known about the regions of the protein that are critical to its function as an electron donor to the MoFe protein, but almost nothing is known about the regions of the protein that are critical to its functions in either FeMo cofactor biosynthesis or FeMo cofactor insertion. Using computer modeling and information obtained from Fe protein mutants that were made decades ago by chemical mutagenesis, we targeted a surface residue Glu(146) as potentially being involved in FeMo cofactor biosynthesis and/or insertion. The Azotobacter vinelandii strain expressing an E146D Fe protein variant grows at approximately 50% of the wild type rate. The purified E146D Fe protein is fully functional as an electron donor to the MoFe protein, but the MoFe protein synthesized by that strain is partially ( approximately 50%) FeMo cofactor-deficient. The E146D Fe protein is fully functional in an in vitro FeMo cofactor biosynthesis assay, and the strain expressing this protein accumulates free FeMo cofactor. Assays that compared the ability of wild type and E146D Fe proteins to participate in FeMo cofactor insertion demonstrate, however, that the mutant is severely altered in this last reaction. This is the first known mutation that only influences the insertion reaction."

Stereochemical evidence is emerging for a distinct sugar binding specificity-dependent distribution of hydrogen bond donors vis à vis the acceptors in the combining site of lectins (4Elgavish S. Shaanan B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The C-4 locus of the monosaccharide within the primary binding site of galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins has hitherto been considered to be absolutely invariant.Though belonging to different families, jacalin, a Moraceaemember, and WBA1 I, aLeguminosae member, both are galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins (6Sastry M.V.

Whereas jacalin displays a β-prism tertiary structural fold wherein a unique post-translationally generated N-terminal glycine residue serves as a critical determinant of galactose specificity (8Sankaranarayanan R. Sekar K. Banerjee R. Sharma V. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), WBA I contains a legume lectin fold (9Prabu, M. M., Sankaranarayanan, R., Puri, K. D., Sharma, V., Surolia, A. (1998) J. Mol. Biol. 76, Vijayan, M., and Suguna, K. 2, 787–796Google Scholar). During the course of mapping and establishing the hydrogen bond donor-acceptor relationship of the primary combining site of galactose-specific lectins (10Swaminathan C.P. Gupta D. Sharma V. Surolia A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13428-13434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), unexpectedly, we have discovered that the 4-methoxy derivative ofd-galactopyranoside (4-methoxygalactose) binds, with affinities comparable with that of methyl-α-galactose, to theMoraceae lectin jacalin and the Leguminosaelectin WBA I but not to the related WBA II. 2Srinivas, V. R., Acharya, S., Rawat, S., Sharma, V., and Surolia, A. (2000) FEBS Lett. 474, 76–82.2Srinivas, V. R., Acharya, S., Rawat, S., Sharma, V., and Surolia, A. (2000) FEBS Lett. 474, 76–82.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe ITC experiments directly detected the evolution of heats of binding when fixed aliquots of 4-methoxygalactose solution were added into either jacalin solution (Fig.1 A) or WBA I solution (Fig.1 C). These data, analyzed by iterated non-linear least squares fitting procedures, were found to best fit the simplest identical site model indicating that both the lectins bind to 4-methoxygalactose (Fig. 1, B and D). The reactions were driven by dominant favorable enthalpic contributions (Table I). These results, contrary to the usual expectation of the indispensability of the unsubstituted C-4 hydroxyl of the saccharide, clearly demonstrate the capability of 4-methoxygalactose to bind to both WBA I as well as jacalin. This reflects the existence of 4-methoxygalactose binding ability in galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin members from at least two unrelated families. To test whether 4-methoxygalactose displays a promiscuous binding to other lectins with similar monosaccharide specificity, the binding of 4-methoxygalactose to WBA II, a dimeric acidic lectin sequentially and structurally similar to WBA I, was tested. The results of such an ITC experiment indicate no binding of 4-methoxygalactose to WBA II (Fig. 1, E andF). That the non-binding of 4-methoxygalactose to WBA II was not due to loss of activity of WBA II was confirmed by testing the binding of 2′fucosyllactose to WBA II; the thermodynamic parameters obtained, K b = 1.0 × 105 and ΔH b 0 = 43.2 kJ mol−1 at 298.2 K, agreed very well with previously published values (12Srinivas V.R. Singha N.C. Schwarz F.P. Surolia A. Carbohydr. Lett. 1998; 3: 129-136Google Scholar). In contrast, none of these galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins, WBA I, WBA II, or jacalin, bound 4-methoxyglucose. The inherent inability of WBA II to recognize 4-methoxygalactose is perhaps due to dominant steric factors around its specificity-determining C-4 locus. The ability of 4-methoxygalactose to bind to WBA I as well as jacalin, together with its inability to bind to WBA II, is consistent with the formation of favorable interactions from the vicinity of the C-4 locus of 4-methoxygalactose with the corresponding binding site residues in WBA I and jacalin. It appears that the disposition of amino acid residues in the vicinity of the C-4 locus of 4-methoxygalactose within the binding sites of WBA I and jacalin permits the efficient binding of 4-methoxygalactose by WBA I and jacalin. That 3-methoxygalactose and 6-methoxygalactose do not bind to either WBA I (10Swaminathan C.P. Gupta D. Sharma V. Surolia A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13428-13434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or jacalin 3C. P. Swaminathan and A. Surolia, unpublished results. indicates that this unusual binding of 4-methoxygalactose by WBA I and jacalin is due to specific interactions. In addition, WBA I−4-methoxygalactose as well as jacalin−4-methoxygalactose complexes saturated with 4-methoxygalactose did not bind to a molar excess of exogenously added methyl-α-galactose, suggesting that 4-methoxygalactose was not bound to a site other than the primary combining site of either jacalin or WBA I.Table IThermodynamic quantities from ITC for binding of 4-methoxygalactose to galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectinsLectinTK b−ΔG 0 b−ΔH 0 b−TΔS 0 b−ΔS 0 bK× 10 −3 M −1kJ mol −1J mol −1 K −1Jacalin278.238.94 (± 0.25)24.4537.24 (± 0.25)12.7946.0283.233.41 (± 0.33)24.5339.87 (± 0.23)15.3454.2288.229.41 (± 0.36)24.6541.25 (± 0.22)16.6057.6293.221.75 (± 0.17)24.3542.81 (± 0.28)18.4663.0298.216.12 (±0.21)24.0243.57 (±0.19)19.5565.6303.214.56 (± 0.34)24.1646.79 (± 0.32)22.6374.6WBA I278.215.18 (± 0.21)22.2721.07 (± 0.51)−1.20−4.3283.212.53 (± 0.36)22.2224.12 (± 0.54)1.906.7288.211.02 (± 0.45)22.3027.62 (± 0.42)5.3218.5293.29.82 (± 0.32)22.4129.84 (± 0.38)7.4325.3298.27.24 (± 0.27)22.0331.94 (± 0.56)9.9133.2303.25.05 (± 0.43)21.5035.17 (± 0.72)13.6745.1WBA II283.2NBNBNBNBNB298.2NBNBNBNBNBThe stoichiometries of 4-methoxygalactose binding to jacalin and WBA I were 4.01 ± 0.02 and 2.04 ± 0.09, respectively. The heat capacity (ΔCp) of 4-methoxygalactose binding to jacalin and WBA I were −345 ± 31 and −550 ± 22 J mol−1K−1, respectively (Fig. 1 G). NB, non-binding. Open table in a new tab The temperature dependence of the enthalpy (ΔH 0 b) (Fig. 1 G) and entropy (ΔS 0 b) (Fig. 1 H) was linear for the binding of 4-methoxygalactose to both jacalin and WBA I. There is almost no temperature dependence of the binding free energy (i.e. ΔΔG 0 b ≅ 0) (Fig. 1 I) within the temperature range examined because of significant enthalpy-entropy compensation (EEC) (Fig. 1 J). EEC apparently masks the differences in binding thermodynamics (14Swaminathan C.P. Surolia N. Surolia A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 5153-5159Crossref Scopus (85) Google Scholar,19Cooper A. Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol. 1999; 3: 557-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). A close examination of the EEC plot (Fig. 1 J) reveals that the effect of EEC, in terms of the slope of the linear plots, is nearly the same for 4-methoxygalactose binding both to jacalin and WBA I. The y intercept (i.e. a position in the EEC plot where −TΔS 0 b is zero) of the EEC plot provides a measure of the condition at which all contributions from the enthalpic components proceed entirely to the free energy of the system, without any net change in entropic losses or gains. Thus, for enthalpically driven systems, such as the binding of 4-methoxygalactose to jacalin and WBA I, the differences iny intercepts of the respective EEC plots (25.2 ± 0.4 kJ mol−1 for jacalin and 22.4 ± 0.2 kJ mol−1 for WBA I) suggest different net contributions to the binding free energy emerging only in the form of different enthalpic components.In 400 MHz 1H-NMR experiments, the addition of WBA I or jacalin, but not WBA II, to a solution of 4-methoxygalactose led to broadening of the sugar resonances (Fig.2, A–C). The broadening was due to the slow exchange (τ m ≫T 2 m) of the sugar between free and lectin-bound states as attested to by a pronounced increase in line width with increase in temperature. Hence the line broadening effects are governed by the residence time of the anomers at the binding site. Analyses of the dependence of the net change in reciprocal line broadening as a function of 4-methoxygalactose concentration yielded K b values of 7.4 × 103 and 7.3 × 103 for the binding of α- and β-anomers, respectively, of 4-methoxygalactose to WBA I, whereas the K b for the jacalin−4-methoxygalactose complex was 1.5 × 104(Fig. 2 D). These values are in the range of titration calorimetric data (Table I). The ITC and NMR results together demonstrate unequivocally that the C-4 locus of galactose can tolerate substitution and yet not disrupt the specific carbohydrate binding ability of jacalin and WBA I, thus throwing light on the plasticity of their primary combining sites. Hence the binding site should be sufficiently flexible to accommodate this plasticity, which permits a promiscuous recognition of both galactose and 4-methoxygalactose.Figure 2400 MHz 1H-NMR partial spectra at 300 K of 4-methoxygalactose in the absence (A) and presence of WBA I (B) or jacalin (C). The spectra (——) in A andB were deconvoluted into two peaks each (- - -, – – –) corresponding to the α- and β-anomers of 4-methoxygalactose, whereas the spectra (——) in C did not deconvolute and represent the sum of α- and β-anomers.D, linear regression analysis of a plot (——) of the dependence of the reciprocal line broadening on 4-methoxygalactose concentration yielded K b values of 7.4 × 103 and 7.3 × 103 for the binding of α-(■) and β-(▵) anomers of 4-methoxygalactose, respectively, to WBA I, and 1.5 × 104 for the overall binding of 4-methoxygalactose (▪) to jacalin. The dissociation rate constants k −1 at 300 K derived fromD were 5.2 (± 0.2) s−1 and 5.1 (± 0.2) s−1 for the binding of α- and β-anomers of 4-methoxygalactose, respectively, to WBA I, and 30.5 (± 0.3) s−1 for the overall binding of 4-methoxygalactose to jacalin. The slopes and y intercepts, respectively, of the lines in D were 1.43 (r= 0.998) and 0.194 for (■), 1.42 (r = 0.998) and 0.196 for (▵), and 0.49 (r = 0.991) and 0.033 for (▪).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)These studies point to the existence of a C−H···O hydrogen bond between the 4-methoxy group of 4-methoxygalactose and the corresponding loci in the binding site of jacalin and WBA I. The presence of oxygen atoms in a large majority of molecules raises the possibility that the C−H···O hydrogen bond is widespread though not identified in many cases (20Taylor R. Kennard O. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1982; 104: 5063-5070Crossref Scopus (2079) Google Scholar, 21Desiraju G.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar, 22Derewenda Z.S. Lee L. Derewenda U. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 252: 248-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, x-ray and neutron diffraction studies have shown that crystals of various organic molecules and biomolecules exhibit close C−H···X contacts (where X is an electronegative atom, in most cases oxygen) that show all the stereochemical hallmarks of hydrogen-bonds (21Desiraju G.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). Recently, C−H···O interactions in collagen triple helix (23Bella J. Berman H.M. J. Mol.

Biol. 1998; 284: 867-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) have also been identified. Cytosine-rich intercalated DNA quadruplexes not only contain intra-cytidine C−H···O hydrogen bonds but also display a systematic intermolecular C−H···O hydrogen bonding network between the deoxyribose sugar moieties of antiparallel backbones in the four-stranded molecule (29Berger I. Egli M. Rich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12116-12121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). More recently, C−H···O hydrogen bonds have been found in the minor grooves of A-tracts in DNA double helices (30Ghosh A. Bansal M. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 294: 1149-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and, as a caveat, in cubanecarboxylic acids it is C−H···O bonds that determine O−H···O networks (31Kuduva S.S. Craig D.C. Nangia A. Desiraju G.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 1936-1944Crossref Scopus (251) Google Scholar).There is ample evidence that “hydrogen-bonds” are composite, multi-center interactions that span a wide range of geometry and energy, with large chemical variations among the donor (X−H) and acceptor groups (21Desiraju G.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). The angular distributions of C−H···O interactions for different types of C−H groups show that the directionality decreases with decreasing C−H polarization but is still clearly recognizable for methyl groups; on the other hand, for C−H···H−C van der Waals contacts, the isotropic angular characteristics are observed (32Steiner, T., and Desiraju, G. R. (1998) J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun. 891–892Google Scholar). There are many cases of multiple approaches by C−H groups in some donor-rich systems, with as many as four C−H groups forming contacts with a carbonyl oxygen atom (33Desiraju G.R. Kashino S. Coombs M.M. Glusker J.P. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. B Struct. Crystallogr. 1993; 49: 880-892Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Based on studies on simple alkynes and alkenes, it was found that the more acidic a particular type of C−H group, the shorter are the C−H···O bonds it forms (21Desiraju G.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that the strength of a hydrogen bond in C≡C−H···O is close to 4–5 kcal mol−1, rivalling the O−H···O hydrogen bond in water (21Desiraju G.R. Acc. Chem. Res. 1996; 29: 441-449Crossref PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). The C-4 hydroxyl group serves as a donor of bidentate and tridentate hydrogen bonds in the complexes of WBA I−methyl-α-galactose (Ref. 9Prabu, M. M., Sankaranarayanan, R., Puri, K. D., Sharma, V., Surolia, A. (1998) J. Mol. Biol. 76, Vijayan, M., and Suguna, K. 2, 787–796Google Scholar and Fig.3 A) and jacalin−methyl-α-galactose (Ref. 8Sankaranarayanan R. Sekar K. Banerjee R. Sharma V. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar and Fig. 3 C), respectively. As neither 4-deoxygalactose nor 4-fluorodeoxygalactose binds to either WBA I (10Swaminathan C.P. Gupta D. Sharma V. Surolia A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13428-13434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or to jacalin,3 the C-4 hydroxyl group contributes significantly to the reaction, predominantly as a hydrogen bond donor. Apparently the methoxy group at the C-4 locus of 4-methoxygalactose is able to fulfill such a role. This is consistent with the relatively greater acidity of a methyl group covalently bound to an oxygen atom than of that bound to an aliphatic carbon atom. These results thus substantiate the existence of C−H···O hydrogen bond(s) in the vicinity of the specificity-determining C-4 loci of the bound saccharide in the complexes of WBA I−4-methoxygalactose (Fig.3 B) and jacalin−4-methoxygalactose (Fig. 3 D). These C−H···O hydrogen bonding interactions involved in the recognition of 4-methoxygalactose by WBA I and jacalin appear to be stronger in magnitude (Table I) than those involved in the binding of galactose with WBA I (10Swaminathan C.P. Gupta D. Sharma V. Surolia A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13428-13434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) and jacalin.3 The examples of 4-methoxygalactose−WBA I/jacalin interactions thus suggest that C−H···O hydrogen bonds in lectin−sugar interactions could contribute at least as significantly to the binding reaction as other hydrogen bonds.Figure 3Schematic representation of the primary combining site of lectins based on crystal structure and molecular modeling. WBA I complexed with methyl-α-galactose (A) (9Prabu, M. M., Sankaranarayanan, R., Puri, K. D., Sharma, V., Surolia, A. (1998) J. Mol.

Hydrogen bonds are represented as dotted lines.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Aside from the main chain carbonyl of Thr-210 in WBA I at a distance of 4.39 Å from the methyl group oxygen at the C-4 locus of the modeled 4-methoxy-α-d-galactopyranoside, no atom other than the cognate binding site residues was present within 5.5 Å in the primary binding sites of WBA I and jacalin (11Humphrey W. Dalke A. Schulten K. J. Mol. Graph. 1996; 14: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (36841) Google Scholar). The absence of nonpolar residues around the C-4 loci of methyl-α-galactose-bound complexes of WBA I and jacalin provide grounds to believe that the interaction of the 4-methoxy group of 4-methoxygalactose with the binding sites of WBA I and jacalin is not of a nonpolar nature. This is also supported by the observation that these binding reactions are predominantly enthalpically driven (Table I). Moreover, the root mean square deviation of C-α atoms of residues around the binding sites of native WBA I compared with those of WBA I complexed with methyl-α-galactose is less than 0.5 Å, suggesting the absence of significant conformational changes upon sugar binding.In conclusion, we have presented here for the first time evidence for the existence in lectin−carbohydrate recognition of C−H···O hydrogen bond(s) in the vicinity of the specificity-determining C-4 locus of the saccharide 4-methoxygalactose and the lectins WBA I and jacalin. The recognition of sugar molecules by carbohydrate-specific proteins, lectins, involves the establishment of an organized set of interactions within the binding site. Hydrogen-bonding interactions are one of the most important factors of molecular recognition in lectin−sugar interactions, along with van der Waals forces, which, although rather weak (often contributing only a fraction of 1 kcal mol−1 for each pair of atoms), are frequently numerous and together make a significant contribution to binding (1Goldstein I.J. Hayes C.E. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1978; 35: 127-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar,2Lis H. Sharon N. Chem. Rev. 1998; 98: 637-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1626) Google Scholar). Despite the differences in the lectin folds and their modes of sugar binding, the specificity for the recognition of galactose is determined by interactions involving the C-4 locus of the saccharide (1Goldstein I.J. Hayes C.E. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1978; 35: 127-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1343) Google Scholar, 2Lis H. Sharon N. Chem.

Stereochemical evidence is emerging for a distinct sugar binding specificity-dependent distribution of hydrogen bond donors vis à vis the acceptors in the combining site of lectins (4Elgavish S. Shaanan B. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 462-467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). The C-4 locus of the monosaccharide within the primary binding site of galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins has hitherto been considered to be absolutely invariant. Though belonging to different families, jacalin, a Moraceaemember, and WBA1 I, aLeguminosae member, both are galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins (6Sastry M.V. Banarjee P. Patanjali S.R.

Whereas jacalin displays a β-prism tertiary structural fold wherein a unique post-translationally generated N-terminal glycine residue serves as a critical determinant of galactose specificity (8Sankaranarayanan R. Sekar K. Banerjee R. Sharma V. Surolia A. Vijayan M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1996; 3: 596-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), WBA I contains a legume lectin fold (9Prabu, M.

During the course of mapping and establishing the hydrogen bond donor-acceptor relationship of the primary combining site of galactose-specific lectins (10Swaminathan C.P. Gupta D. Sharma V. Surolia A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 13428-13434Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), unexpectedly, we have discovered that the 4-methoxy derivative ofd-galactopyranoside (4-methoxygalactose) binds, with affinities comparable with that of methyl-α-galactose, to theMoraceae lectin jacalin and the Leguminosaelectin WBA I but not to the related WBA II. 2Srinivas, V.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONThe ITC experiments directly detected the evolution of heats of binding when fixed aliquots of 4-methoxygalactose solution were added into either jacalin solution (Fig.1 A) or WBA I solution (Fig.1 C). These data, analyzed by iterated non-linear least squares fitting procedures, were found to best fit the simplest identical site model indicating that both the lectins bind to 4-methoxygalactose (Fig. 1, B and D). The reactions were driven by dominant favorable enthalpic contributions (Table I). These results, contrary to the usual expectation of the indispensability of the unsubstituted C-4 hydroxyl of the saccharide, clearly demonstrate the capability of 4-methoxygalactose to bind to both WBA I as well as jacalin. This reflects the existence of 4-methoxygalactose binding ability in galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectin members from at least two unrelated families. To test whether 4-methoxygalactose displays a promiscuous binding to other lectins with similar monosaccharide specificity, the binding of 4-methoxygalactose to WBA II, a dimeric acidic lectin sequentially and structurally similar to WBA I, was tested. The results of such an ITC experiment indicate no binding of 4-methoxygalactose to WBA II (Fig. 1, E andF). That the non-binding of 4-methoxygalactose to WBA II was not due to loss of activity of WBA II was confirmed by testing the binding of 2′fucosyllactose to WBA II; the thermodynamic parameters obtained, K b = 1.0 × 105 and ΔH b 0 = 43.2 kJ mol−1 at 298.2 K, agreed very well with previously published values (12Srinivas V.R. Singha N.C. Schwarz F.P. Surolia A. Carbohydr. Lett. 1998; 3: 129-136Google Scholar). In contrast, none of these galactose/N-acetylgalactosamine-specific lectins, WBA I, WBA II, or jacalin, bound 4-methoxyglucose. The inherent inability of WBA II to recognize 4-methoxygalactose is perhaps due to dominant steric factors around its specificity-determining C-4 locus. The ability of 4-methoxygalactose to bind to WBA I as well as jacalin, together with its inability to bind to WBA II, is consistent with the formation of favorable interactions from the vicinity of the C-4 locus of 4-methoxygalactose with the corresponding binding site residues in WBA I and jacalin. It appears that the disposition of amino acid residues in the vicinity of the C-4 locus of 4-methoxygalactose within the binding sites of WBA I and jacalin permits the efficient binding of 4-methoxygalactose by WBA I and"
https://openalex.org/W1498132140,"Abstract Crocus sativus lectin (CSL) is one of the truly mannose-specific plant lectins that has a unique binding specificity that sets it apart from others. We studied sugar-binding specificity of CSL in detail by a solution phase method (fluorescence polarization) and three solid phase methods (flow injection, surface plasmon resonance, and microtiter plate), using a number of different glycopeptides and oligosaccharides. CSL binds the branched mannotriose structure in the N-glycan core. Substitution of the terminal Man in the Manα(1–3)Man branch with GlcNAc drastically decreases binding affinity much more than masking of the terminal Man in the Manα(1–6)Man branch. Most interestingly, the β-Man-linked GlcNAc in N-glycan core structure contributes greatly to the binding. The effect of this GlcNAc is so strong that it can substantially offset the negative effect of substitution on the nonreducing terminal Man residues. On the other hand, the GlcNAc that is usually attached to Asn inN-glycans and the l-Fuc linked at the 6-position of the GlcNAc are irrelevant to the binding. A bisecting GlcNAc neither contributes to nor interferes with the binding. This unique binding specificity of CSL offers many possibilities of its use in analytical and preparative applications."
