https://openalex.org/W2163577447,"The past several years have seen the emergence of a standard cosmological model, in which small temperature differences in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation on angular scales of the order of a degree are understood to arise from acoustic oscillations in the hot plasma of the early Universe, arising from primordial density fluctuations. Within the context of this model, recent measurements of the temperature fluctuations have led to profound conclusions about the origin, evolution and composition of the Universe. Using the measured temperature fluctuations, the theoretical framework predicts the level of polarization of the CMB with essentially no free parameters. Therefore, a measurement of the polarization is a critical test of the theory and thus of the validity of the cosmological parameters derived from the CMB measurements. Here we report the detection of polarization of the CMB with the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI). The polarization is deteced with high confidence, and its level and spatial distribution are in excellent agreement with the predictions of the standard theory."

https://openalex.org/W2160773716,"Since the discovery of their one-dimensional electronic band structure1, the leading candidate that has emerged for nanodevice applications is single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) . Here we unite their unique properties with the specific molecular-recognition features of DNA by coupling SWNTs to peptide nucleic acid (PNA, an uncharged DNA analogue2) and hybridizing these macromolecular wires with complementary DNA. Our findings provide a new, versatile means of incorporating SWNTs into larger electronic devices by recognition-based assembly, and of using SWNTs as probes in biological systems by sequence-specific attachment."
https://openalex.org/W2092069493,"Mixed-valent manganites are noted for their unusual magnetic, electronic and structural phase transitions. For example, the La(1-x)Ca(x)MnO(3) phase diagram shows that below transition temperatures in the range 100-260 K, compounds with 0.2 < x < 0.5 are ferromagnetic and metallic, whereas those with 0.5 < x < 0.9 are antiferromagnetic and charge ordered. In a narrow region around x = 0.5, these totally dissimilar ground states are thought to coexist. It has been shown that charge order and charge disorder can coexist in the related compound, La(0.25)Pr(0.375)Ca(0.375)MnO(3). Here we present electron microscopy data for La(0.5)Ca(0.5)MnO(3) that shed light on the distribution of these coexisting phases, and uncover an additional, unexpected phase. Using electron holography and Fresnel imaging, we find micrometre-sized ferromagnetic regions spanning several grains coexisting with similar-sized regions with no local magnetization. Holography shows that the ferromagnetic regions have a local magnetization of 3.4 +/- 0.2 Bohr magnetons per Mn atom (the spin-aligned value is 3.5 micro (B) per Mn). We use electron diffraction and dark-field imaging to show that charge order exists in regions with no net magnetization and, surprisingly, can also occur in ferromagnetic regions."

But these sources can create pulses that contain more than one photon, making them vulnerable to eavesdropping by photon splitting3,4. Here we present an experimental demonstration of quantum cryptography that uses a photon turnstile device, which is more reliable for delivering photons one at a time. This device allows completely secure communication in circumstances under which this would be impossible with an attenuated laser."

https://openalex.org/W2106597930,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is not only essential for vasculogenesis and angiogenesis but also is a potent inducer of vascular permeability. Although a dissection of the molecular pathways between angiogenesis- and vascular permeability-inducing properties would be desirable for the development of angiogenic and anti-angiogenic therapies, such mechanisms have not been identified yet. Here we provide evidence for a role of the p38 MAPK as the signaling molecule that separates these two processes. Inhibition of p38 MAPK activity enhances VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo, a finding that was accompanied by prolonged Erk1/2 MAPK activation, increased endothelial survival, and plasminogen activation. Conversely, the same inhibitors abrogate VEGF-induced vascular permeability in vitro and in vivo. These dualistic properties of p38 MAPK are relevant not only for therapeutic angiogenesis but also for reducing edema formation and enhancing tissue repair in ischemic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2139289108,"Co-translational modification of eukaryotic proteins by N-myristoylation aids subcellular targeting and protein-protein interactions. The enzyme that catalyzes this process,N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), has been characterized in the kinetoplastid protozoan parasites, Leishmania andTrypanosoma brucei. In Leishmania major, the single copy NMT gene is constitutively expressed in all parasite stages as a 48.5-kDa protein that localizes to both membrane and cytoplasmic fractions. Leishmania NMT myristoylates the target acylated Leishmania protein, HASPA, when both are co-expressed in Escherichia coli. Gene targeting experiments have shown that NMT activity is essential for viability inLeishmania. In addition, overexpression of NMT causes gross changes in parasite morphology, including the subcellular accumulation of lipids, leading to cell death. This phenotype is more extreme than that observed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, in which overexpression of NMT activity has no obvious effects on growth kinetics or cell morphology. RNA interference assays in T. brucei have confirmed that NMT is also an essential protein in both life cycle stages of this second kinetoplastid species, suggesting that this enzyme may be an appropriate target for the development of anti-parasitic agents.

N-myristoyltransferase hydrophilic acylated surface protein glycophosphatidylinositol open reading frame RNA interference ADP-ribosylation factor group of overlapping clones Myristoyl-CoA:protein N-myristoyltransferase (NMT1; EC 2.3.1.97) catalyzes the covalent co-translational attachment of the fatty acid, myristate (C14:0) to the amino-terminal glycine residue of a number of eukaryotic cellular and viral proteins of diverse function (1Gordon J.I. Duronio R.J. Rudnick D.A. Adams S.P. Gokel G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8647-8650Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These include cAMP-dependent serine/threonine kinases, members of the p60 Src family of tyrosine kinases, retroviral gag polyprotein precursors such as HIV-1pr55, viral capsid components, and the Î±-subunit of many signal-transducing, heteromeric G proteins. Although some myristoylated proteins are cytosolic, many are associated with cellular membranes where myristoylation facilitates membrane attachment. The addition of myristate can also stabilize protein-protein interactions, and many acylated proteins require this modification for full expression of their biological function (2McIlhinney R.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 211-225PubMed Google Scholar). Genetic studies have shown that theNMT gene is essential for the survival ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (3Duronio R.J. Towler D.A. Heuckeroth R.O. Gordon J.I. Science. 1989; 243: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) and the pathogenic fungi,Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans (4Lodge J.K. Johnson R.L. Weinberg R.A. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 2996-3009Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Given the critical role of N-myristoylation in the cell, NMT has been developed as a target for the development of antifungal chemotherapeutic agents. The NMT enzyme has an ordered Bi-Bi reaction mechanism (5Rudnick D.A. McWherter C.A. Rocque W.J. Lennon P.J. Getman D.P. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9732-9739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), binding first to myristoyl-CoA, with the resulting conformational changes generating a peptide-binding site. Subsequent formation of a ternary myristoyl-CoA:NMT-peptide complex leads to catalysis and product release. The myristoyl-CoA binding sites of purified human NMT and the fungal NMTs are highly conserved, but their peptide binding specificities are divergent (6Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). By exploiting these differences, peptide and peptidomimetic inhibitors with selectivity for fungal NMTs have been designed. For example, an inhibitor based on the N terminus of ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF), the major myristoylated protein detected in [3H]myristate-labeled C. neoformans (causative agent of chronic meningitis in AIDS patients), is competitive for peptide and noncompetitive for myristoyl-CoA binding (7Langner C.A. Lodge J.K. Travis S.J. Caldwell J.E. Lu T. Li Q. Bryant M.L. Devadas B. Gokel G.W. Kobayashi G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17159-17169Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and a nonpeptide inhibitor based on this sequence is at least â¼5-fold selective for C. neoformansagainst human NMT (8Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Higgins M. McWherter C.A. Sikorski J.A. Devadas B. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 12482-12491Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Similarly, peptidomimetic inhibitors based on the N-terminal sequence of C. albicans ARF are 560-fold selective for the fungal NMT as compared with the human enzyme. Gel mobility assays indicate that a single dose of 200 Î¼m is sufficient to produce â¼50% reduction in the myristoylation ofC. albicans ARF, which is consistent with fungistatic activity (9Lodge J.K. Jackson-Machelski E. Devadas B. Zupec M.E. Getman D.P. Kishore N. Freeman S.K. McWherter C.A. Sikorski J.A. Gordon J.I. Microbiology. 1997; 143: 357-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).

Parasitic kinetoplastid protozoa of the species Leishmaniaand Trypanosoma are causative agents of some of the most debilitating tropical infections currently affecting world populations (see, on the World Wide Web, www.who.int/tdr/index.html). Metabolic labeling studies have identified at least ten [3H]myristate-labeled proteins in Leishmania major, including the ARF-like protein 1 (53Menon M.R. Molecular Cloning and Characterisation of Leishmania major N-myristoyltransferase-a Putative Drug TargetPh.D. thesis. University of London, 2002Google Scholar). and the infective stage specific, hydrophilic acylated surface proteins (HASPs) (13Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14McKean P.G. Delahay R. Pimenta P.F. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). HASPB, a candidate vaccine for visceral leishmaniasis (15Stager S. Smith D.F. Kaye P.M. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 7064-7071Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), requires N-terminal myristoylation and palmitoylation for translocation to the parasite plasma membrane (16Denny P.W. Gokool S. Russell D.G. Field M.C. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11017-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Myristate is also a component of the glycophosphatidylinositol (GPI) lipid anchors that tether the major classes of surface molecules in trypanosomatid parasites. InLeishmania, the myristate-containing GPI anchors of the surface glycoinositolphospholipids are remodeled during synthesis by a reaction involving myristate exchange from a myristoyl-CoA donor (17Ralton J.E. McConville M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4245-4257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). In mammalian stages of Trypanosoma brucei, fatty acid remodeling is also important in synthesis of the variant surface glycoprotein GPI anchor, which contains two myristates in its diacylglycerol domain (18Morita Y.S. Acosta-Serrano A. Buxbaum L.U. Englund P.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 14147-14154Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). As a consequence, myristate analogues are toxic in T. brucei, probably due to a cumulative effect on GPI anchor, phospholipid, and N-myristoylated protein synthesis (19Doering T.L. Raper J. Buxbaum L.U. Adams S.P. Gordon J.I. Hart G.W. Englund P.T. Science. 1991; 252: 1851-1854Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Doering T.L. Lu T. Werbovetz K.A. Gokel G.W. Hart G.W. Gordon J.I. Englund P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9735-9739Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Here, we show that myristate analogues (nonspecific inhibitors of NMT) are also toxic to Leishmania and describe the molecular characterization of NMT in both L. major andT. brucei. As with the pathogenic fungi, expression of NMT is essential for viability in these parasites, whereas modulation of enzyme activity inhibits parasite growth, yielding aberrant phenotypes, presumably due to disrupted modification of âdownstreamâ target proteins. L. major(MHOM/IL/81/Friedlin) promastigotes were maintained in vitroat 26 Â°C as described (13Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Logarithmically growing parasites at â¼8 Ã 106 mlâ1 were incubated with different inhibitors (dissolved in 100% ethanol as 100 mmstocks) that had previously been conjugated to fat-free bovine serum albumin as described (16Denny P.W. Gokool S. Russell D.G. Field M.C. Smith D.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11017-11025Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Ethanol was added to noninhibitor-treated cells to the same final concentration (1%). At the time points indicated, aliquots were removed in triplicate for counting; all motile organisms were scored, including those with abnormal morphology. Each time course was done in triplicate, and the whole experiment was repeated three times. A 677-bp fragment of the NMT gene was amplified from L. major genomic DNA, using Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) at 55 Â°C annealing temperature and the primers, NMTfor(5â²-GAGATYAACTTYCTSTGCGTSCAC-3â²) and NMTrev(5â²-RCCRTCRCCIIIRCCRAACTT-3â²), based on the NMT âsignature sequencesâ (EINFLCVH and KFGXGDG, available on the World Wide Web at www.expasy.org/prosite/) and adjusted to L. major codon bias. The amplified fragment, nmt, was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) and used to screen a gridded L. major Friedlin genomic cLHYG cosmid library (21Ivens A.C. Lewis S.M. Bagherzadeh A. Zhang L. Chan H.M. Smith D.F. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Of the 21 positive clones identified, 12 mapped to the same contiguous sequence on chromosome 33. L. major NMT was subcloned from cosmid L8010 (21Ivens A.C. Lewis S.M. Bagherzadeh A. Zhang L. Chan H.M. Smith D.F. Genome Res. 1998; 8: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) into pBS SK+, as 1.6- and 2.0-kbEcoRI/SacI fragments. The same degenerate primers were used to amplify and sequence portions of the NMT genes from Leishmania donovani(MHOM/ET/67/L28; accession number AY072732), Leishmania infantum (MHOM/FR/78/LEM75; accession number AY072731), andLeishmania mexicana (MNYC/BZ/62/M379; accession numberAY072730). The T. brucei NMT gene was identified as TRYP10.0.001826-6, part of a 15-kb contig on chromosome 10, in data deposited at www.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/nph-proj-omniblast.html. A 175-amino acid fragment of the Trypanosoma cruzi NMT is also available (accession number AI069625), spanning residues 193â371 of the T. brucei open reading frame (ORF) (Fig. 2). The L. major NMTORF was amplified from genomic DNA, using primers ORFfor(5â²-TATGGATCCATATGTCTCGCAATCCATCGAACTCCG-3â²) and ORFrev(5â²-ATAGGATCCATCGATCTACAGCATCACCAAGGCAACCTG-3â²). The L. major HASPA ORF was amplified from plasmid pXS (14McKean P.G. Delahay R. Pimenta P.F. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using primers Hfor (5â²-AGATATACCATGGGAAGCTCTTGCACGAAGGAC-3â²) and Hrev (5â²-ATAACTCGAGCTAGTTGCCGGCAGCGTGCT-3â²). The amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T, and the sequences of both fragments were verified as wild type. For expression in Escherichia coli, the cloned NMT ORF was digested with NdeI/BamHI and subcloned into the expression vector, pET15b (Novagen), to obtain plasmid pNMT. The HASPA ORF was digested with NcoI/XhoI and cloned into the expression vector pET28a (Novagen), generating plasmid pHASPA. The recombinant HASPA expressed from this plasmid has an N-terminal myristoylation motif (MGSSCTK). Expression of N-terminally His-tagged recombinant L. major NMT (from pNMT) was induced by isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside in E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS, and the cells were subsequently lysed in 6 m Gu-HCl, prior to affinity chromatography using Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose (Qiagen). Eluted protein was further purified by SDS-PAGE and used for immunization and generation of rabbit polyclonal antisera (Eurogentec). For immunoblotting, wild type parasites were lysed in SDS gel-loading buffer, proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and the resulting blots were probed with purified NMT antiserum (abSK805; 1:2000 dilution), anti-HASPB (14McKean P.G.

Parasitol. 2001; 116: 25-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Immune complexes were detected using an ECL kit (Amersham Biosciences). This assay was based on the co-expression system described in Ref. 2McIlhinney R.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1998; 88: 211-225PubMed Google Scholar. E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysS cells were cotransformed with pNMT and pHASPA, either singly or in combination. 2-ml cultures were grown to A 600 0.5 in LB media containing ampicillin, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol, and expression of recombinant proteins was induced by the addition of 1 mm isopropyl-1-thio-Î²-d-galactopyranoside. Immediately, the cultures were divided into two 1-ml aliquots, with 150 Î¼Ci of [9,10-3H]myristate (AmershamBiosciences) in 10 Î¼l of ethanol added to one aliquot and 10 Î¼l of ethanol alone added to the second. The cells were then incubated at 37 Â°C for a further 3 h, prior to centrifugation, phosphate-buffered saline washing, lysis, and analysis by SDS-PAGE. Radiolabeled proteins were detected by autoradiography at â80 Â°C using Hyperfilm MP (Amersham Biosciences). 5 Ã 108midlog phase parasites were lysed and separated into membrane and cytoplasmic fractions as described (23Knuepfer E. Stierhof Y.D. McKean P.G. Smith D.F. Biochem. J. 2001; 356: 335-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Proteins in both fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting, as described above. To target both NMT alleles, plasmids were generated containing either a hygromycin resistance gene (hyg) or a puromycin resistance gene (pac) flanked with DNA sequences immediately upstream and downstream of the NMT ORF. These constructs, based on the pX63-HYG vector (25Cruz A. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7170-7174Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), were designated pNMT-HYG and pNMT-PAC, respectively. To generate pNMT-HYG, a 873-bp fragment immediately upstream of the NMT ORF was amplified using primers NKO1F (ATAGCaagcttGCGACGCGTGGGACTGTGACA) and NKO1R (GTGCATgtcgacCGCAGTATTCGTGTGCGTGT). Cloning sites are shown in lowercase, and L. major sequence is shown in uppercase. The amplified product was digested with HindIII/SalI and cloned into pX63-HYG, generating plasmid pXN-HYG. Subsequently, a 1110-bp fragment immediately downstream of the NMT ORF was amplified using the primers NKO2F (ATCGTcccgggTTTACGCNCCGCCCCACCTTTCCG) and NKO2R (CATGCTagatctGCACCAGTGCTCGGCGGTCGGC) and cloned into the SmaI/BglII sites of pXN-HYG, generating pNMT-HYG. To construct pNMT-PAC, the pac gene was released from plasmid plmcpb-PAC (26Mottram J.C. Souza A.E. Hutchison J.E. Carter R. Frame M.J. Coombs G.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6008-6013Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) as previously described (27McKean P.G. Denny P.W. Knuepfer E. Keen J.K. Smith D.F. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and used to replace the hyg gene in pNMT-HYG, followingSpeI/BamHI digestion. Linear targeting regions (produced by digesting pNMT-HYG with SapI/MscI and pNMT-PAC with SapI/NcoI) were purified and used sequentially to transfect midlog phase L. majorpromastigotes as described (28Kapler G.M. Coburn C.M. Beverley S.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1084-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Transfected parasites were plated in the presence of 32 Î¼g mlâ1 hygromycin and 20 Î¼g mlâ1 puromycin, clones were amplified, and DNA/protein was extracted for analysis as described (27McKean P.G. Denny P.W. Knuepfer E. Keen J.K. Smith D.F. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The DNA probes HYG(1027 bp) and PAC (600 bp) were generated by digesting pNMT-HYG and pNMT-PUR with SpeI/BamHI. AnNMT N-terminal probe (986 bp) was produced by digesting NMT-pTEX with XhoI/SalI. Immunoblotted proteins were detected as described above. For complementation of transgenic L. major or overexpression in wild type parasites, pNMT was digested withClaI/SmaI prior to cloning the insertion into the expression vector pTEX (29Kelly J.M. Ward H.M. Miles M.A. Kendall G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3963-3969Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar), generating pTEX NMT NEO. Parasites were electroporated with 20 Î¼g of plasmid DNA, prior to plating in the presence of 20 Î¼g mlâ1 G418, amplification, and analysis as described above and in Ref. 27McKean P.G. Denny P.W. Knuepfer E. Keen J.K. Smith D.F. Cell Microbiol. 2001; 3: 511-523Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar. A 543-bp fragment within the NMT ORF was amplified from T. brucei genomic DNA using the primers Tb-NMT-For (5â²-ACTCCAATAATGGTTCTAGAGAAGAGAGA-3â²) and Tb-NMT-Rev (5â²-TCGTCTTTTtctagaCCCACCG-3â²). T. brucei sequence is shown in uppercase, and cloning sites are underlined. The PCR fragment was digested with XbaI and cloned into the XbaI sites of the RNA interference (RNAi) vector, p2T7Ti, which supports expression of double-stranded RNA from tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters (30LaCount D.J. Bruse S. Hill K.L. Donelson J.E. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 2000; 111: 67-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), generating p2T7-NMT. The procyclic T. brucei strain 29-13 (31Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar), containing the genes expressing T7 RNA polymerase and tetracycline repressor, was maintained in vitro at 27 Â°C in SDM-79 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 25 Î¼g mlâ1hygromycin, and 25 Î¼g mlâ1 G418. Midlog phase parasites were electroporated with 20 Î¼g of NotI-linearized p2T7-NMT DNA, as described (32Hill K.L. Hutchings N.R. Russell D.G. Donelson J.E. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3091-3101Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The parasites were allowed to recover overnight, and transfectants were selected using 2.5 Î¼g mlâ1 phleomycin and grown for 3 weeks until stable cell lines had been established. The expression of double-stranded RNA was induced by the addition of 1 Î¼g mlâ1 tetracycline to parasites diluted to 1 Ã 106 mlâ1 in SDM-79 medium. Cell numbers were monitored using a Beckman Coulter counter. Protein samples were prepared at 24-h intervals and analyzed by immunoblotting, as described above. The bloodstream T. brucei strain 90-13 (31Wirtz E. Leal S. Ochatt C. Cross G.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1999; 99: 89-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (1115) Google Scholar) was maintainedin vitro at 37 Â°C with 5% CO2 in HMI-9 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 5 Î¼g mlâ1 hygromycin, and 2.5 Î¼g mlâ1 G418. Midlog phase parasites were electroporated with 10 Î¼g ofNotI-linearized p2T7-NMT DNA, as described (33Biebinger S. Wirtz L.E. Lorenz P. Clayton C. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The parasites were allowed to recover for 6 h, before the addition of 2.5 Î¼g mlâ1 phleomycin. The cells were transferred to 24-well culture plates and grown for 10 days until stable cell lines had been established. Expression of double-stranded RNA was induced by the addition of 1 Î¼g mlâ1 tetracycline to parasites diluted to 2 Ã 104 mlâ1 in HMI-9 medium. Cell numbers were monitored as above. Parasites were washed three times in serum-free M199 medium and resuspended at 1 Ã 107mlâ1. Parasites were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, fixed again in 1% osmium tetroxide in sodium cacodylate buffer, treated with 1% tannic acid, dehydrated through an increasing ethanol series (staining en bloc in 2% uranyl acetate at the 30% ethanol stage), infiltrated, and embedded in TAAB 812 resin (TAAB Laboratories Equipment Ltd.). 60-nm ultrathin sections, cut on a Leica UCT ultramicrotome, were contrasted with uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined on a Philips CM100 transmission electron microscope. For lipid staining, malachite green was added at 0.5% to the primary fixative solution just prior to fixing on ice for 2 h. Uranyl acetate was used as a light counterstain at the 30% ethanol stage during dehydration, and final contrasting with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, as described above, was omitted. Since myristate analogues are nonspecific competitive inhibitors of NMT, we first tested these compounds for their effect on Leishmania growth and division in culture. Specifically, the myristate analogues 2-hydroxymyristate and 4-oxatetradecanoate were incubated with procyclic L. majorover a 72-h time course (Fig. 1). Whereas the untreated parasites continued to divide, growth in the inhibitor-treated cultures slowed after 24 h, and viable parasite numbers reached a plateau by 48 h, depending on the inhibitor concentration. At 48 h, there was >50% reduction in parasite numbers compared with untreated cells, with both inhibitors showing a dose-dependent effect. On microscopic examination, the inhibitor-treated cells showed extensive morphological differences (rounded cells with variable motility and intracellular organelle distention) when compared with the untreated parasites (data not shown). These results demonstrate that, as with T. brucei, myristate analogues are toxic to Leishmania promastigotes, most likely due to global effects on GPI anchor and phospholipid biosynthesis as well as N-myristoylation of target proteins. It was not possible to correlate the loss of viability observed in the presence of these analogues with reduced N-myristoylation of specific targets, since the single well characterized Leishmania N-myristoylated protein, HASPB, is only expressed later in the growth cycle, following differentiation of procyclic parasites to infective metacyclics (13Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14McKean P.G. Delahay R. Pimenta P.F. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). The L. major NMT gene was cloned by degenerate PCR amplification of genomic DNA followed by library screening. Contiguous sequence (3480 bp) generated from the subcloned gene fragments contained a 1266-bp ORF, coding for a 48.5-kDa protein of pI 6.1 (accession number AF305956). This deduced protein shares identity with NMT from other species, as shown in the sequence alignment in Fig. 2. L. major NMT shares 42, 41, 43, 44, and 40% overall amino acid identity with Homo sapiens, S. cerevisiae,C. albicans, C. neoformans, andPlasmodium falciparum NMTs, respectively. The NMTs of otherLeishmania species (L. donovani, L. infantum, L. mexicana) are highly conserved with theL. major enzyme (97, 96, and 96%, respectively, in the region between the signature sequences (data not shown)), whereas in the related trypanosomatid species, T. brucei, amino acid identity through the ORF drops to 54% (Fig. 2). Similar analysis of aT. cruzi NMT fragment (spanning residues 193â371 of theT. brucei ORF) shows 44% identity with L. major NMT. As with all NMTs so far characterized, the L. major and T. brucei enzymes are divergent at their N termini (which are not involved in catalysis) and do not contain N-terminal lysine-rich regions (that have been implicated in ribosomal targeting of human and mouse NMTs) (34Glover C.J. Hartman K.D. Felsted R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28680-28689Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Conversely, many of the key fungal NMT residues predicted to be directly involved in the enzyme mechanism or to have critical regulatory roles (6Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar) are conserved in L. major andT. brucei. An exception is Cys217 of S. cerevisiae NMT (and conserved in other fungal species); mutation of this residue has a selective effect on the S. cerevisiaeNMT peptide binding site (35Zhang L. Jackson-Machelski E. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33131-33140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In L. major and T. brucei NMTs, this residue is replaced by Gly. High resolution structural analysis of the C. albicans enzyme has revealed that two negatively charged residues, Glu173 and Leu451, form the floor of the active site pocket of the enzyme (10Weston S.A. Camble R. Colls J. Rosenbrock G. Taylor I. Egerton M. Tucker A.D. Tunnicliffe A. Mistry A. Mancia F. de la Fortelle E. Irwin J. Bricogne G. Pauptit R.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 213-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These residues are conserved in both L. majorand T. brucei NMTs, but there is also an insertion of â¼20 amino acids, rich in Lys and Glu, close to the first of these âpocket floorâ residues in the parasite enzymes (Fig. 2). An additional insertion of 29 amino acids is found further downstream in T. brucei NMT. These features suggest that the parasite NMTs might form distinctive secondary and tertiary structures that could affect their activities relative to the human and fungal enzymes. L. major NMT is a single copy gene (as determined by endonuclease digestion, blotting, and hybridization; data not shown). Similarly, the genomes of the New World species, L. amazonensis, and T. brucei also contain singleNMT genes. Leishmania parasites cycle between extracellular promastigotes (within the sandfly vector) and intracellular amastigotes (principally within macrophages of the mammalian host). To investigate NMT expression during the L. major life cycle, equivalent numbers of noninfective (logarithmic or procyclic) and infective (metacyclic) promastigotes and amastigotes (extracted from BALB/c mouse lesions) were lysed and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. After blotting, NMT was immunodetected as a single 48.5-kDa protein, present in all life cycle stages (Fig.3 A). In the same samples, expression of HASPB, a member of the hydrophilic acylated surface protein family, was restricted to infective parasite stages as previously demonstrated (13Flinn H.M. Rangarajan D. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1994; 65: 259-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 14McKean P.G. Delahay R. Pimenta P.F. Smith D.F. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1997; 85: 221-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Expression of the constitutive endoplasmic reticulum marker protein, BiP, was used as a control for equivalent loading. Thus, NMT is constitutively expressed inL. major. NMT has been localized to the cytoplasm in S. cerevisiae and does not appear to be associated with cellular membranes (36Knoll L.J. Levy M.A. Stahl P.D. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 5366-5373Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, a fraction of Drosophila NMT has been shown to be membrane-bound (37Ntwasa M. Egerton M."
https://openalex.org/W2116790073,"Cancer therapy is currently limited by the difficulty of achieving efficient delivery into target cells. To investigate whether therapeutics can be delivered specifically to cancer cells, we have explored the possibility of selecting small peptides that bind specifically, or preferentially, to breast cancer cell lines. By using random peptide phage libraries and an experimental approach that allows the selection of internalized peptides, cell-specific binding peptides have been identified. The peptides define a major core motif (LTVXPWY) that was not found in negative phages. Phage displaying LTVSPWY peptide sequence exhibited a specific binding to breast cancer cells. None of the selected peptides bound to human primary cells from different tissue origin (e.g., epithelial, endothelial, hematopoetic). The potential of the selected peptides to mediate cellular internalization in the context of phages and recombinant GFP-peptide fusions was demonstrated. By linking the LTVSPWY peptide to an antisense phosphorothioate oligonucleotide against the ErbB2 receptor, specific delivery to cancer cells was achieved. In contrast to free antisense, the peptide-antisense conjugates inhibited ErbB2 gene expression. Thus, efficient delivery of antisense oligonucleotides can be achieved by coupling them to cancer cell-specific peptides, identified by a method that did not require any knowledge about their corresponding receptors."
https://openalex.org/W2152946528,"Neurofibrillary tangles comprised of highly phosphorylated tau proteins are a key component of Alzheimer's disease pathology. Mice lacking Reelin (Reln), double-knockouts lacking the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) and ApoE receptor2 (ApoER2), and mice lacking disabled-1 (Dab1) display increased levels of phosphorylated tau. Because Reln binds to recombinant ApoE receptors, assembly of a Reln/ApoE-receptor/Dab1 (RAD) complex may initiate a signal transduction cascade that controls tau phosphorylation. Conversely, disruption of this RAD complex may increase tau phosphorylation and lead to neurodegeneration. To substantiate this concept, we mated Reln-deficient mice to ApoE-deficient mice and found that in the absence of Reln, tau phosphorylation increased as the amount of ApoE decreased. Paralleling the change in tau phosphorylation levels, we found that GSK-3beta activity increased in Reln-deficient mice and further increased in mice lacking both Reln and ApoE. CDK-5 activity was similar in mice lacking Reln, ApoE, or both. GSK-3beta and CDK-5 activity increased in Dab1-deficient mice, independent of ApoE levels. Further supporting the idea that increased tau phosphorylation results primarily from increased kinase activity, the activity of two phosphatases was similar in all conditions tested. These data support a novel, ligand-mediated signal transduction cascade--initiated by the assembly of a RAD complex that suppresses kinase activity and controls tau phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W1964207969,"Measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation can reveal with remarkable precision the conditions of the Universe when it was â¼400,000 years old. The three most fundamental properties of the CMB are its frequency spectrum (which determines the temperature), and the fluctuations in both the temperature and polarization across a range of angular scales. The frequency spectrum has been well determined, and considerable progress has been made in measuring the power spectrum of the temperature fluctuations. But despite many efforts to measure the polarization, detection of this property of the CMB has hitherto been beyond the reach of even the most sensitive observations. Here we describe the Degree Angular Scale Interferometer (DASI), an array of radio telescopes, which for the past two years has conducted polarization-sensitive observations of the CMB from the AmundsenâScott South Pole research station."
https://openalex.org/W2170668936,"Steroids are implicated in many physiological processes, such as reproduction, aging, metabolism, and cancer. To understand the molecular basis for steroid recognition and discrimination, we studied the human estrogenic 17beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (17beta-HSD1) responsible for the last step in the bioactivation of all estrogens. Here we report the first observation of the conversion of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) into 3beta,17beta-androstanediol (3beta-diol) by 17beta-HSD1, an estrogenic enzyme studied for more than half a century. Kinetic observations demonstrate that both the 3beta-reduction of DHT into 3beta-diol (kcat = 0.040 s(-1)1; Km = 32 +/- 9 microM) and the 17beta-oxidation of DHT into androstandione (A-dione) (kcat = 0.19 s(-1); Km = 26 +/-6 microM) are catalyzed by 17beta-HSD1 via alternative binding orientation of the steroid. The reduction of DHT was also observed in intact cells by using HEK-293 cells stably transformed with 17beta-HSD1. The high-resolution structure of a 17beta-HSD1-C19-steroid (testosterone) complex solved at 1.54 A demonstrates that the steroid is reversibly oriented in the active site, which strongly supports the existence of alternative binding mode. Such a phenomenon can be explained by the pseudo-symmetric structure of C19-steroids. Our results confirm the role of the Leu149 residue in C18/C19-steroid discrimination and suggest a possible mechanism of 17beta-HSD1 in the modulation of DHT levels in tissues, such as the breast, where both the enzyme and DHT are present."

https://openalex.org/W2023346299,"Chronic hyperglycemia and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) cause oxidative stress leading to dysregulated cell growth or apoptosis that contributes to the development of inflammation and secondary complications of diabetes. However, the mechanisms regulating hyperglycemic or cytokine injury are not well understood. Herein we report that inhibition of the polyol pathway enzyme aldose reductase (AR) by two structurally unrelated inhibitors--sorbinil and tolrestat--prevents, in the human lens epithelial cell line B-3, the apoptosis and activation of caspase-3 caused by exposure to high glucose levels or TNF-alpha. Inhibition of AR attenuated TNF-alpha and hyperglycemia-induced activation of protein kinase C (PKC), phosphorylation of the inhibitory subunit of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), and stimulation of NF-kappaB, but it did not prevent the activation of NF-kappaB and PKC by phorbol ester. Inhibition of AR also attenuated the increase in p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation. These signaling pathways were also inhibited in cells in which the expression of AR was reduced by antisense ablation. Collectively, these results identify a new participant in apoptotic signaling and suggest that AR is an obligatory mediator of the apoptotic events upstream of PKC. These observations could provide new insights into the pathophysiology of diabetes and the role of aberrant glucose metabolism in apoptotic cell death."
https://openalex.org/W2063876077,"The ether-a-go-go-related genes (erg) are expressed in tissues other than heart and brain, in which human erg (HERG) K+ channels are known to regulate the repolarization of heart action potentials and neuronal spike-frequency accommodation. We provide evidence that erg1 transcripts and ERG proteins are present in rat chromaffin cells in which we could isolate a K+ current that was biophysically and pharmacologically similar to the ERG current. Firing frequency and catecholamine release were analyzed at the single-cell level by means of perforated patch-clamp and carbon fiber electrochemical detection. It was found that the blocking of ERG, KATP, and KCa channels led to hyperexcitability and an increase in catecholamine release. Combined immunocytochemical experiments with antibodies directed against phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase and ERG channels suggested expression of these channels in epinephrine- but not in norepinephrine-containing cells. It is concluded that, in addition to being crucial in regulating the QT period in the heart, ERG channels play a role in modulating epinephrine, a fundamental neurotransmitter shaping cardiac function. This finding suggests that the sudden death phenotype associated with LQT2 syndrome mutations may be the result of an emotionally triggered increase in epinephrine in a long-QT running heart."
https://openalex.org/W2155261780,"The endothelium controls blood flow and pressure by releasing several vasoactive factors, among them the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) and the potent vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 (ET-1). Although increased NO levels have been found in excessive erythrocytosis, little is known concerning ET-1 expression in this condition. Thus, we examined the endothelin system in transgenic mice that due to constitutive overexpression of erythropoietin (Epo) reached hematocrit levels of approximately 80%. Surprisingly, despite generalized vasodilatation, polycythemic mice exhibited a two- to fivefold elevation in ET-1 mRNA levels in aorta, liver, heart, and kidney. In line with this, increased expression of ET-1 protein was detected in the pulmonary artery by immunohistochemical analysis. Compared with their wild-type littermates, aortic rings of Epo transgenic animals exhibited a marked reduction in vascular reactivity to ET-1 and big ET-1, but this effect was abrogated upon preincubation with the NO synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME). Pretreatment of polycythemic mice with the ET(A) receptor antagonist darusentan for 3 wk significantly prolonged their survival upon acute exposure to L-NAME. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that excessive erythrocytosis induces a marked activation of the tissue endothelin system that results in increased mortality upon blockade of NO-mediated vasodilatation. Because ETA antagonism prolonged survival after acute blockade of NO synthesis, endothelin may be regarded as a contributor to the adverse cardiovascular effects of erythrocytosis and may thus represent a new target in the treatment of cardiovascular disease associated with erythrocytosis."

Recent data have demonstrated that TPP I is a serine protease inhibitable by 3,4-dichloroisocoumarin and diisopropyl fluorophosphate, with Ser475 representing the active site nucleophile and Asp360 and Asp517 being involved in catalytic activity (15Lin L.

However, the role of glycosylation for the biology of TPP I and the process of maturation of TPP I zymogen in vivo have not yet been examined. Here we addressed these issues by analyzing the biosynthesis, glycosylation, and processing of hTPP I overexpressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Our data suggest that maturation of TPP I takes place in lysosomal compartments and that glycosylation enables intracellular transport and maturation of TPP I. Furthermore, we show that a serine protease that is sensitive to 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) participates in processing of the proenzyme to the mature, active formin vivo. Degradation of polypeptides requires the collective action of various endo- and exopeptidases, finally releasing free amino acids and dipeptides reused in the cell cytoplasm according to the metabolic needs of the cell. Two tripeptidyl peptidases identified to date in mammalian cells sequentially cleave tripeptides from the N termini of oligopeptides: tripeptidyl peptidase I (TPP I,1 CLN2 protein) and tripeptidyl peptidase II (TPP II) (for a recent review, see Ref. 1Tomkinson B.

https://openalex.org/W2066581023,"The role of AT2-receptors has recently been subject of considerable debate. We investigated the influence of AT2-stimulation/inhibition on myocardial endothelial NO-synthase (eNOS, NOS-III) promoter activity and eNOS protein expression. Stimulation of rat cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II (AngII) increased eNOS protein expression 3.3-fold. This was blocked by Cyclosporin A (CsA). Inhibition of the AT1-receptor did not reduce AngII-mediated eNOS protein expression, whereas AT2 stimulation increased it 2.4-fold and AT2 inhibition suppressed it. The modulatory effects of the AT2-receptor on eNOS expression was confirmed in mice with a genetic deletion of the AT2-receptor (AT2-KO). In gel shift assays two putative NF-AT sites in a 1.6 kb eNOS promoter fragment showed NF-AT binding and a supershift by NF-AT2(-c1)-specific antibodies. Stimulation of transfected cells with AngII or specific AT2-receptor agonists resulted in a significant increase in eNOS promoter activity, which was blocked by CsA, MCIP1, and mutation of an upstream NF-AT site.1) AngII-stimulation of the myocardium, both in vivo and in vitro, is accompanied by increased expression of eNOS. 2) This effect is mediated by the calcineurin pathway and is induced by the AT2-receptor. 3) These results define a calcineurin/NF-AT/eNOS pathway as downstream effector of AT2-receptor activation in the myocardium."

https://openalex.org/W2001487964,"Although transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha, a member of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) family, has been shown to protect neurons against excitotoxic and ischemic brain injuries, its mechanism of action remains unknown. In the present study, we used in vitro models of apoptotic or necrotic paradigms demonstrating that TGF-alpha rescues neurons from N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic death, with the obligatory presence of astrocytes. Because neuronal tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) release was shown to potentiate NMDA-induced excitotoxicity, we observed that TGF-alpha treatment reduced NMDA-induced increase of t-PA activity in mixed cultures of neurons and astrocytes. In addition, we showed that although TGF-alpha induces activation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs) in astrocytes, it failed to activate p42/p44 in neurons. Finally, we showed that TGF-alpha, by an ERK-dependent mechanism, stimulates the astrocytic expression of PAI-1, a t-PA inhibitor, which mediates the neuroprotective activity of TGF-alpha against NMDA-mediated excitotoxic neuronal death. Taken together, we indicate that TGF-alpha rescues neurons from NMDA-induced excitotoxicity in mixed cultures through inhibition of t-PA activity, involving PAI-1 overexpression by an ERK-dependent pathway in astrocytes."
https://openalex.org/W2169083786,"Epidemiological data and animal models have provided evidence that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have an anticancer effect. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying these antineoplastic effects are not well understood. We described previously that expression levels of the chemokine receptor, CCR5, and the beta2-integrin, Mac-1, were down-regulated on primary monocytes after incubation in supernatants from human carcinoma cell lines, and that this down-regulation resulted in impaired monocyte function with respect to migration and adhesion. We now demonstrate that these impairments are also present in vivo. Monocytes from cancer patients displayed significantly reduced CCR5 levels and migration capacities in comparison to cells from healthy donors. Because migration is necessary for the antitumor activity of monocytes/macrophages, these deficits may contribute to the suppressed immune system seen in cancer patients. In a clinical study, we analyzed the effect of a selective COX-2 inhibitor, Rofecoxib, on the migration of monocytes derived from cancer patients. The results revealed significant improvement in migration equal to those levels seen in healthy donors. We conclude that in patients with cancer, the intake of Rofecoxib for 3 wk leads to significant restoration of monocyte function. These data may, at least in part, help explain the anticancer effects of NSAIDs."

For APP, Î³-secretase catalyzes proteolysis of a set of membrane-tethered APP derivatives, termed APP-CTFs, resulting in the production and secretion of Î²-amyloid (AÎ²) peptides. On the other hand, Î³-secretase-mediated processing of the membrane-tethered Notch1 derivative, termed S2/NEXT, releases the intracellular domain (S3/NICD) that subsequently translocates to the nucleus and activates transcription of target genes (7Schroeter E.H.

The observation that AÎ² and S3/NICD production are completely eliminated in cells derived from mouse blastocysts with compound deletions of PS1 andPS2, lends convincing support to the notion that PS are critical for intramembranous cleavage of APP and Notch1 (12Herreman A.

Selkoe D.J. Science. 2002; 296: 2156-2157Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). While appealing, the âPS is Î³-secretaseâ model has several weaknesses. First, mutagenesis studies have revealed that Î³-secretase has relaxed substrate selectivity within the APP transmembrane domain and occurs at heterogeneous sites (21Lichtenthaler S.F. Wang R.

Second, whereas endocytosis and recycling of APP-CTFs are required for the generation of AÎ² (23Koo E.H. Squazzo S.L. J. Biol.

Intrigued by the apparent discordance between the activities of FAD-linked PS1 mutants on the production of AÎ²42 peptides and S3/NICD production, we examined the activity of these FAD-linked PS1 variants on the production of secreted AÎ² peptides and the effects of a potent aspartyl protease transition state inhibitor of Î³-secretase, termed L-685,458 (15Li Y.-M. Lai M.-T. Xu M. Huang Q. DiMuzio-Mower J. Sardana M.K. Shi X.-P. Yin K.-C. Shafer J.A. Gerdell S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

We now report that while PS1 variants enhance production of AÎ²42, as expected, there is an unexpected enhancement in levels of secreted AÎ²40 peptides. We also provide the first demonstration that in the conditioned medium of âpoolsâ of stable cell lines that express individual FAD-linked mutant PS1, both AÎ²1â40 and 1â42 peptides accumulate to higher levels than the AÎ² peptide variants in medium of cell pools that express wild-type PS1. More surprisingly, under conditions at which the Î³-secretase inhibitor completely eliminates production of all AÎ²-related peptides from cells expressing wild-type PS1, we now report that the inhibitor is not fully effective at lowering production of AÎ² variants from cells expressing two independent FAD-linked PS1 mutants. Hence, we argue that production of AÎ² peptides are differentially regulated by the expression of wild-type and FAD-linked PS1 variants. Mouse neuroblastoma N2a cells that constitutively expresses human Swedish APP695 (N2a swe.10) (35Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4821) Google Scholar) were maintained in 50% Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and 50% Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum. To generate stable cell lines expressing wild-type PS1, the FAD-linked ÎE9, or E280A variants, N2a swe.10 cells were cotransfected with 10 Î¼g of PS1 cDNAs (in pAG3Zeo vector) and 100 ng of pIREShygro using the calcium phosphate method (36Thinakaran G. Teplow D.B. Siman R. Greenberg B. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9390-9397Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). Cells expressing transgene were selected with 400 Î¼g/ml hygromycin. Hygromycin-resistant colonies were further screened in medium containing 400 Î¼g/ml zeocin (Invitrogen) to generate a stable pool. Approximately 100â200 zeocin-resistant colonies were pooled and analyzed. For Î³-secretase inhibitor assays, cells were incubated for 16 h in medium containing 2 Î¼m (or indicated concentrations) of the Î³-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458 (16Shearman M.S. Beher D.

Conditioned media were collected and immediately adjusted to 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cultured cells were lysed in 1Ã immunoprecipitation (IP) buffer containing 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, and protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma). Nuclei and debris were removed by centrifugation and the protein concentration of detergent-soluble proteins in each lysate was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce). For immunoprecipitations, we used equivalent volumes of conditioned medium based on the calculation of the protein concentration in each plate of cells to avoid experimental bias because of variations in cell density. Normalized conditioned media were immunoprecipitated with 26D6, a monoclonal antibody raised against AÎ²1â12 (37Lamb B.T. Bardel K.A. Kulnane L.S. Anderson J.J. Holtz G. Wagner S.L. Sisodia S.S. Hoeger E.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar), for 16 h at 4 Â°C. The immune complexes were âbridgedâ by the addition of rabbit anti-mouse IgG (Pierce), collected with protein A-conjugated agarose beads (Pierce), and eluted by boiling for 5 min in Laemmli SDS sample buffer prior to fractionation on SDS-PAGE. Aliquots of detergent lysate were fractionated on high percentage Tris-Tricine SDS-PAGE gels for detection of full-length APP and APP-CTFs, or Tris glycine SDS-PAGE for analysis of PS1. To detect secreted AÎ²40/42, immunoprecipitated samples were fractionated on Bicine/urea gels (38Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Fractionated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Bio-Rad), and the membranes were probed with appropriate primary antibodies. Full-length APP and APP-CTF were detected by CT15, an antisera that recognizes the carboxyl-terminal 15 amino acids of APP (39Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J.

After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibodies (Pierce), bound antibodies were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences). N2a cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) and then labeled with 250 Î¼Ci/ml [35S]methionine (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in methionine-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 1% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) for 10 min (for pulse-labeling) or 2 h. Conditioned medium was collected and cells were lysed in IP buffer. For immunoprecipitations we used a volume of conditioned medium that was normalized to the calculated trichloroacetic acid-precipitable radioactive counts (cpm) in cell lysates. Soluble APPÎ± and AÎ²40/42 were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody, 26D6 (37Lamb B.T. Bardel K.A. Kulnane L.S. Anderson J.J. Holtz G. Wagner S.L. Sisodia S.S. Hoeger E.J. Nat. Neurosci. 1999; 2: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). To examine APP synthesis, cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]methionine for 10 min, and APP was immunoprecipitated with 369 antibody, raised against a peptide corresponding amino acids 649â695 of APP695 (41Buxbaum J.D. Gandy S.E. Cicchetti P. Ehrlich M.E. Czernik A.J. Fracasso R.P. Ramabhadran T.V. Unterbeck A.J. Greengard P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Immunoprecipitates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and radioactive bands were visualized and quantified using a PhosphorImager (AmershamBiosciences). Conditioned media from N2a swe.10 cell pools stably expressing wild-type PS1 or the PS1ÎE9 were immunoprecipitated with 4G8 antibody, specific for amino acids 17â24 of AÎ², and collected with Protein A/G-coupled agarose beads prior to analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometric analysis, as described (42Wang R. Sweeney D. Gandy S.E. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31894-31902Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar). Each mass spectrum was averaged from at least 500 measurements, and bovine insulin was included as an internal mass calibrant. It is now well accepted that expression of FAD-linked PS1 variants elevate the levels of secreted AÎ²1â42 peptides and, in so doing, increase the calculated ratio of AÎ²40/AÎ²42 peptides. However, the absolute levels of AÎ² peptide variants have rarely been reported, a reflection, in large part, of the variability in transgene-encoded APP between individual lines. With this caveat, we chose to transfect a neuroblastoma N2a cell line that constitutively expresses a carboxyl-terminal Myc epitope-tagged human APP 695 harboring the FAD-linked âSwedishâ mutations (38Wiltfang J. Smirnov A. Schnierstein B. Kelemen G. Matthies U. Klafki H.W. Staufenbiel M. Huther G. Ruther E. Kornhber J. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 527-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar) with human wild-type PS1 (wtPS1) or the FAD-linked PS1 variants, PS1ÎE9, or E280A to generate stable pools that express human PS1 polypeptides. Western blot analysis of stable cell pools revealed the accumulation of human PS1 NTF and low levels of full-length precursor in cells expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig.1 A, lane 1), uncleaved â¼43-kDa PS1ÎE9, and low levels of endogenous mouse PS1 NTF in cells expressing PS1ÎE9 (Fig. 1 A, lane 2), and mutant human PS1 NTF and low levels of full-length precursor in cells expressing the E280A variant (Fig. 1 A,lane 3). In these cell pools, âreplacementâ of the bulk of murine PS1 fragments has occurred (45Petit A. Bihel F. Alves da Costa C. Pourquie O. Checler F. Kraus J.L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar), although residual levels of murine NTF (as seen in the PS1ÎE9 cells) are still present. This would be expected in a cell pool in which transgene-derived products are expressed at varying levels in independent clones. We examined the levels of secreted AÎ²-related species by immunoprecipitation with antibody 26D6 (39Sisodia S.S. Koo E.H. Hoffman P.N. Perry G. Price D.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 3136-3142Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), specific for AÎ² residues 1â12, fractionation of immune complexes on Bicine/urea gels, and analysis of immunoprecipitated AÎ² peptides using 26D6 antibody and enhanced chemiluminescence detection. For these studies, we calculated the protein concentration in each plate of cells, and used normalized volumes of medium so that there would be no experimental bias because of differences in cell density. In Fig. 1, we show that constitutive expression of wild-type PS1 leads to robust secretion of AÎ²1â40 peptides, limited levels of secreted AÎ²1â37, AÎ²1â38, and AÎ²1â39 peptides and nearly undetectable levels of AÎ²1â42 peptides (Fig. 1 B, lane 1). This level of secreted AÎ² peptides is no higher than parental APPswe.10 cells (data not shown). On the other hand, we consistently observed that the levels of accumulated AÎ²1â40 and AÎ²1â42 peptides were elevated in medium of cells expressing either the PS1ÎE9 or A280E variants (Fig.1 B, lanes 3 and 5, respectively). Even more surprising was the observation that under conditions in which treatment of wtPS1 cells with a potent Î³-secretase inhibitor, L-685,458 (17Martys-Zage J.L. Kim S.-H. Berechid B. Bingham S.J. Chu S. Sklar J. Nye J. Sisodia S.S. J. Mol. Neurosci. 2000; 15: 189-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) (2 Î¼m for 16 h), resulted in nearly complete inhibition of secreted AÎ² peptides (Fig. 1 B,lane 2), low levels of AÎ²1â40 and AÎ²1â42 peptides still remained in the medium of cells expressing either PS1 mutant (Fig. 1 B, lanes 4 and 6). Our finding that two FAD-linked PS1 variants enhance secretion of the principal AÎ² variant, AÎ²1â40, is novel and we felt it important to fully validate this finding. We chose to focus on the PS1ÎE9 pool. First, to establish that the differences in accumulated AÎ² peptides between wtPS1 and PS1ÎE9 cell pools was not simply a reflection of differences in synthetic levels of transgene-encoded APPswe, we pulse-labeled cells with [35S]methionine for 10 min and analyzed newly synthesized APP in cell lysates by subjecting equivalent detergent-soluble, trichloroacetic acid-precipitable, radioactivity (cpm) to immunoprecipitation with antibody 369, raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 649â695 of APP (43Thinakaran G. Harris C.L. Ratovitski T. Davenport F. Slunt H.H. Price D.L. Borchelt D.R. Sisodia S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28415-28422Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar), fractionation of immune complexes on SDS-PAGE, and phosphorimaging. In Fig. 1 C, we show that the synthesis of full-length APP is indistinguishable between the cell pools that express either human wtPS1 or PS1ÎE9. To further quantify the absolute increase in both AÎ²1â40 and AÎ²1â42 peptides in medium of mutant PS1-expressing cells relative to cells expressing wtPS1, we incubated cell pools with [35S]methionine for 2 h and quantified the levels of secreted AÎ² peptides in medium by immunoprecipitation with antibody 26D6, fractionation of immune complexes on Tris-Tricine gels, and phosphorimaging. For these analyses, we quantified total counts/min in detergent-solubilized cell lysates and used normalized volumes of radiolabeled conditioned medium for immunoprecipitations. As we have shown by Western blot analysis (Fig. 1 B), quantitative phosphorimaging analysis revealed an elevation in total AÎ² peptides in medium of cells expressing the PS1ÎE9 mutant (Fig. 1 D,lane 3) by 2.8-fold relative to AÎ² peptides secreted from cells expressing wtPS1 (Fig. 1 D, lane 1). Notably, the 26D6 antibody, specific for AÎ² residues 1â12, also detects soluble derivatives generated by Î±-secretase, termed APPsa, quantitative phosphorimaging revealed a 1.5-fold increase in levels of APPsa in medium of PS1ÎE9 cells relative to cells expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig. 1 D, comparelanes 3 and 1, respectively), this despite identical synthetic rates of the APPswe precursor between cell pools (Fig. 1 C). These findings offer the suggestion that expression of the PS1ÎE9 variant leads to enhanced trafficking (or processing) of full-length APPswe to cellular compartments in which Î±-secretase is active, but further studies will be necessary to address this issue. In any event, quantitative phosphorimaging revealed that while treatment of wtPS1 cells with 2 Î¼m inhibitor reduced production of newly synthesized AÎ² peptides to â¼0.4% of untreated controls (Fig. 1 D,lane 2), the inhibitor diminished the levels of total AÎ² peptide species in medium of PS1ÎE9 cells to â¼12% of the untreated control (Fig. 1 D, lane 4). Further examination of the complexity of radiolabeled AÎ² peptide variants by Bicine/urea gels (Fig. 1 E) revealed that the absolute levels of both AÎ²40 and AÎ²42 variants were elevated in medium of PS1ÎE9 cell medium (Fig. 1 E, lane 3; quantified in Fig.1 F, left panel) relative to the levels in medium of cells expressing wild-type PS1 (Fig. 1 E, lane 1; quantified in Fig. 1 F, left panel). Furthermore, under conditions where the Î³-secretase inhibitor almost completely eliminated AÎ²1â40 species in medium of cells expressing wild-type PS1, this compound diminished AÎ²1â40 peptide levels to â¼13% in medium of cells expressing PS1ÎE9 (Fig. 1 E; quantified in Fig. 1 F, left panel). Similarly, the Î³-secretase inhibitor fully eliminates secreted AÎ²1â42 peptides from cells expressing wild-type PS1, but L-685,458 treatment only reduced the level of AÎ²1â42 peptides to â¼58% in medium of cells that expres"
https://openalex.org/W2164210820,"We have previously shown that transforming growth factor-Î²1(TGF-Î²1)-induced apoptosis in FaO hepatoma cells is mediated by cytochrome c release, apoptosome formation, and caspase activation. Although TGF-Î²1 acts via the SMAD signaling pathway to initiate de novo gene transcription, little is known about the downstream gene targets that are involved in the regulation of apoptosis. Therefore, in this study, we used in-house microarrays (â¼5500 genes) to identify pathway-specific gene clustering in TGF-Î²1-treated cells. A total of 142 genes showed time-dependent changes in expression during TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis. The polycaspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone, which, on its own, had no effect on gene transcription, blocked TGF-Î²1-induced cell death and significantly altered the expression of 261 genes, including 185 down-regulated genes. Cluster analysis identified up-regulation of early response genes (0â4 h) encoding for the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton, including the pro-apoptotic CTGF gene, and delayed response genes (8â16 h), including pro-apoptotic genes. A second delayed response cluster (44 genes) was also observed when TGF-Î²1-induced caspase activation was blocked by benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone. This cluster included genes encoding stress-related proteins (e.g. Jun, ATF3, TAB1, and TANK), suggesting that their up-regulation may be in response to secondary necrosis. Finally, we identified an early response set of nine down-regulated genes that are involved in antioxidant defense. We propose that the regulation of these genes by TGF-Î²1could provide a molecular mechanism for the observed elevation in reactive oxygen species after TGF-Î²1 treatment and may represent the primary mechanism through which TGF-Î²1initiates apoptosis.

Chang T.Y. Cell Growth Differ. 1997; 8: 821-827Google Scholar). Consequently, TGF-Î²1 can cause liver disease by disrupting the normal homeostasis between cell proliferation and apoptotic cell death (9Michalopoulos G.K. FASEB J. 1990; 4: 176-187Google Scholar,10Michalopoulos G.K. DeFrances M.C. Science. 1997; 276: 60-66Google Scholar). The importance of TGF-Î²1 in controlling liver homeostasis is demonstrated by the extensive apoptosis and fibrosis observed in the livers of transgenic mice overexpressing TGF-Î²1 (11Brown S.B. Clarke M.C.H. Magowan L. Sanderson H. Savill J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 5987-5996Google Scholar). Disruption of the TGF-Î²1pathway and disregulation of apoptosis have been implicated in hepatocellular carcinoma (12Sanderson N. Factor V. Nagy P. Kopp J. Kondaiah P. Wakefield L. Roberts A.B.

Liver Dis. 1998; 18: 115-122Google Scholar).TGF-Î²1 induces its many biological effects by binding to specific receptors on the plasma membrane, initiating a serine/threonine kinase-catalyzed signaling pathway. Although all the subsequent downstream effects in the apoptotic pathway have not been delineated, it is clear that caspase activation is an essential component, as benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyl ketone (Z-VAD-fmk), a polycaspase inhibitor, not only blocks activation of caspase-3 and caspase-7, but also abrogates apoptotic cell death (6Cain K. Inayat-Hussain S.H. Couet C. Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1996; 314: 27-32Google Scholar,7Inayat-Hussain S.H. Couet C. Cohen G.M. Cain K. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1516-1526Google Scholar). In addition, studies in hepatoma cell lines have shown that caspase-2, -8, and -9 are also processed and activated during TGF-Î²1-induced cell death (14Choi K.S. Lim I.K. Brady J.N. Kim S.J. Hepatology. 1998; 27: 415-421Google Scholar, 15Shima Y. Nakao K. Nakashima T. Kawakami A. Nakata K. Hamasaki K. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1215-1222Google Scholar). Activation of effector caspases (caspase-3 and caspase-7), which kill the cell by cleaving and inactivating/activating key proteins (for review, see Refs. 16Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Google Scholar and 17Kumar S. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1060-1066Google Scholar), can occur by one of two major pathways involving either stimulation of cell-surface death receptors or perturbation of mitochondria (18Green D.R. Cell. 1998; 94: 695-698Google Scholar). In both pathways, a caspase cascade is activated by a two-step mechanism in which initiator (apical) procaspases (procaspase-8 and procaspase-9) are recruited and activated within large multiprotein complexes known as the death-inducing signaling complex and the apoptosome, respectively (for review, see Ref. 19Bratton S.B. MacFarlane M. Cain K. Cohen G.M. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 27-33Google Scholar). In the case of mitochondrion-mediated cell death, the release of cytochrome c is a common response to many apoptotic stimuli (20Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Google Scholar, 21Ahsen O.V. Waterhouse N.J. Kuwana T. Newmeyer D.D. Green D.R. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 1192-1199Google Scholar), initiating the ATP/dATP-dependent oligomerization of Apaf-1 to form the apoptosome. This large multiprotein complex recruits and facilitates autoprocessing of caspase-9 to form an Apaf-1Â·caspase-9 holoenzyme complex, which then recruits and processes the effector caspases (22Zou H. Henzel W.J. Liu X. Lutschg A. Wang X. Cell. 1997; 90: 405-413Google Scholar, 23Li P. Nijhawan D. Budihardjo I. Srinivasula S.M. Ahmad M. Alnemri E.S. Wang X.

Chem. 1999; 274: 17941-17945Google Scholar).The formation of the Apaf-1-containing apoptosome complex is central to the activation of the caspase cascade in mitochondrion-mediated cell death, and we have recently shown that TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis in FaO hepatoma cells induces cytochrome c release and assembly of the â¼700-kDa apoptosome complex, which then activates the effector caspases (caspase-3 and caspase-7) (28Freathy C. Brown D.G. Roberts R.A. Cain K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 750-760Google Scholar). Cytochromec release during TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis has subsequently been confirmed in fetal hepatocytes (29Herrera B. Alvarez A.M. Sanchez A. Fernandez M. Roncero C. Benito M. Fabregat I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 741-751Google Scholar). Furthermore, overexpression of Bcl-xL (30Chipuk J.E. Bhat M. Hsing A.Y. Ma J. Danielpour D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26614-26621Google Scholar), an anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family member, protects against TGF-Î²1-induced cytochromec release and apoptosis in prostate epithelial cells. Thus, although TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis is a receptor-mediated phenomenon, it does not involve death-inducing signaling complex formation and direct primary activation of caspase-8 (28Freathy C. Brown D.G. Roberts R.A. Cain K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 750-760Google Scholar), but acts by triggering the mitochondrial caspase activation pathway.The mechanism by which TGF-Î²1 initiates cytochromec release is as yet unknown. TGF-Î²1 induces its other varied biological effects by acting through specific transmembrane type I and II serine/threonine kinase receptors (TGFBR-1 and TGFBR-2). The cytokine binds to TGFBR-2, which then phosphorylates and activates the TGFBR-1 kinase (1MassagueÌ J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar, 32Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. Nature. 1997; 390: 465-471Google Scholar), which, in turn, phosphorylates the receptor-associated Smad2 and Smad3 proteins. These are then released from the receptor complex and bind to Smad4 to form a heterotrimeric complex, which translocates to the nucleus (33Nakao A. Imamura T. Souchelnytskyi S. Kawabata M. Ishisaki A. Oeda E. Tamaki K. Hanai J. Heldin C.H. Miyazono K. ten Dijke P. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5353-5362Google Scholar, 34Souchelnytskyi S. Tamaki K. Engstrom U. Wernstedt C. ten Dijke P. Heldin C.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 28107-28115Google Scholar). SMAD complexes interact directly or indirectly with TGF-Î²1-responsive promoter sequences and, in combination with other transcription factors, regulate the transcription of specific genes (1MassagueÌ J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Google Scholar, 35Derynck R. Zhang Y. Feng X.H. Cell. 1998; 95: 737-740Google Scholar). This mechanism has been well established in a variety of TGF-Î²1 signaling paradigms, and recent studies have shown that overexpression of dominant-negative Smad2 and Smad3 and also the inhibitor Smad7 not only prevents SMAD-mediated signal transduction, but also abrogates the apoptotic effects of TGF-Î²1 (36Yamamura Y. Hua X. Bergelson S. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36295-36302Google Scholar, 37Patil S. Wildey G.M. Brown T.L. Choy L. Derynck R. Howe P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38363-38370Google Scholar). Thus, TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis appears to require changes in the expression levels of key proteins. In support of this, earlier studies have shown that TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis in adult and fetal rat hepatocytes is blocked by cycloheximide (7Inayat-Hussain S.H. Couet C. Cohen G.M. Cain K. Hepatology. 1997; 25: 1516-1526Google Scholar, 38Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. Hepatology. 1997; 26: 935-943Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have shown that TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis in FaO hepatoma cells requires both de novo transcription and translation, as it is blocked by actinomycin D and cycloheximide (see Fig. 1) (39Cain K. Freathy C. Toxicol. Lett. 2001; 120: 307-315Google Scholar). As TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis occurs via transcriptional activation, some of the resultant and downstream changes in gene expression must be involved in the release of cytochrome cand induction of apoptosis.Therefore, we have used DNA microarrays to characterize time-dependent changes in gene expression during TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis. Our results have identified distinct clusters of both up- and down-regulated genes that may act in a coordinated manner to initiate and amplify the apoptotic program. At early times, a cluster of genes involved in protection against reactive oxygen species (ROS) was down-regulated, allowing an increase in ROS, which would be predicted to induce cytochrome c release and subsequently apoptosome formation. A second cluster of pro-apoptotic genes was up-regulated at later times, thereby amplifying the apoptotic response. Rather surprisingly, in the presence of TGF-Î²1, the polycaspase inhibitor Z-VAD-fmk up-regulated a number of genes involved in stress responses, suggesting that the expression of some TGF-Î²1-regulated genes is caspase-dependent. In conclusion, our studies show that TGF-Î²1 induces apoptosis by time-dependent changes in the expression of a number of critical genes, which then act in a concerted manner to initiate and propagate apoptotic cell death.DISCUSSIONTGF-Î²1 initiates many of its biological effects, including apoptosis, by signaling through SMAD proteins and TGF-Î²1-responsive promoter sequences that regulate the expression of a variety of proteins (36Yamamura Y. Hua X. Bergelson S. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36295-36302Google Scholar, 46Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 5-13Google Scholar). In this study, we used DNA microarrays to study the changes in gene expression during TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis. We have shown that there was a time-dependent and coordinated expression of discrete clusters of genes. Interestingly, many genes were down-regulated by TGF-Î²1, demonstrating that transcriptional repression of specific genes is involved in the initiation of TGF-Î²1-induced apoptotic cell death. The 32 transcripts specifically up-regulated by TGF-Î²1 clustered into immediate-early responses (up-regulated by 4 h) (Fig.2 A) and delayed responses (up-regulated by 8 h or later) (Fig. 2 B). The immediate-early response genes encode many structural proteins, consistent with the fundamental role of TGF-Î²1 in regulating cytoskeletal proteins and in extracellular matrix remodeling. Only a few specific genes (â¼12) are known to have SMAD-responsive elements. However, a recent microarray study in dermal fibroblasts has identified more SMAD-responsive genes (47Verrecchia F. Chu M.L. Mauviel A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17058-17062Google Scholar). These included five related genes encoding for collagen,TIMP-1 (tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1), an irreversible inhibitor of collagenases, ARHB(rhoB), and DSP (desmoplakin I). The latter two genes were also up-regulated in the extracellular matrix and cytoskeleton cluster in FaO cells (Fig. 2 A). This cluster also includes CTGF, which promotes fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix formation and has been implicated in liver fibrosis (48Paradis V. Dargere D. Vidaud M. De Gouville A.C. Huet S. Martinez V. Gauthier J.M. Ba N. Sobesky R. Ratziu V. Bedossa P. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 968-976Google Scholar) and TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 and human aortic smooth muscle cells (49Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Luscher T.F. Fujii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37461-37466Google Scholar, 50Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Fujii T. Luscher T.F. Circulation. 1999; 100: 2108-2112Google Scholar). The CTGF gene contains a TGF-Î²1-responsive element and is strongly up-regulated in MCF-7 cells (which do not normally expressCTGF mRNA) during TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis (49Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Luscher T.F. Fujii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37461-37466Google Scholar). Overexpression of CTGF induces apoptosis, which is abrogated by CTGF antisense oligonucleotides (49Hishikawa K. Oemar B.S. Tanner F.C. Nakaki T. Luscher T.F. Fujii T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37461-37466Google Scholar). Thus, the up-regulation of CTGF we observed in FaO cells (Fig. 5) could amplify the apoptotic effects of TGF-Î²1 and/or alternatively induce apoptosis in surrounding cells.The apoptotic related gene cluster (cluster B) encodes a number of both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, including XIAP,cIAP2, CASP8, TP53, BAK1,BAD, and NOTCH4. The up-regulation ofCASP8 is in agreement with previous studies showing that caspase-8 is processed/activated during TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis (15Shima Y. Nakao K. Nakashima T. Kawakami A. Nakata K. Hamasaki K. Kato Y. Eguchi K. Ishii N. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1215-1222Google Scholar, 28Freathy C. Brown D.G. Roberts R.A. Cain K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 750-760Google Scholar) and would augment apoptotic cell death. However, the significance of other gene changes is more difficult to assess, as some of the proteins (e.g. XIAP) could act as inhibitors of apoptosis, whereas BAK1 and BAD would be expected to amplify the apoptotic response.Although the main action of IAP proteins is to prevent apoptosis by inhibiting active caspases (51Verhagen A.M. Coulson E.J. Vaux D.L. Genome Biol. 2001; 2 (genomebiology.com/2001/2/7/reviews/3009)Google Scholar), XIAP has also been shown to associate with TGFBR-1 and to potentiate TGF-Î²1-induced signaling (52Reffey S.B. Wurthner J.U. Parks W.T. Roberts A.B. Duckett C.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26542-26549Google Scholar). XIAP binds to TAB1, an activator of TAK1 (TGF-Î²1-associatedkinase-1), a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (53Yamaguchi K. Nagai S. Ninomiya-Tsuji J. Nishita M. Tamai K. Irie K. Ueno N. Nishida E. Shibuya H. Matsumoto K. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 179-187Google Scholar). Interestingly, TAB1 was up-regulated in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk (Fig. 2 C and Table III) and is a member of the stress-response gene cluster, which also containsjun, ATF3, and GADD153. The microarray analysis showed that Jun expression was markedly up-regulated at later time points only in TGF-Î²1/Z-VAD-fmk-treated cells. In contrast, the RT-PCR data showed that TGF-Î²1 alone also induced the up-regulation of jun, which agrees with previous studies showing that TGF-Î²1 induces an immediate up-regulation of AP-1 component genes (for review, see Ref. 54Derynck R. Akhurst R.J. Balmain A. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 117-129Google Scholar). During TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis, SMAD proteins bind directly to the Jun family of AP-1 transcription factors (36Yamamura Y. Hua X. Bergelson S. Lodish H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36295-36302Google Scholar). AP-1 proteins are homo- and heterodimers composed of bZIP (basic region leucine zipper) DNA-binding proteins belonging to the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, and JunD), Fos (c-Fos, FosB, Fra-1, and Fra-2), JDP1 and JDP2 (Jun dimerization partner), and closely related ATF (activatingtranscription factor; ATF2, LRF1/ATF3, and B-ATF) families (55Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Google Scholar, 56Shaulian E. Karin M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 2390-2400Google Scholar). Many different apoptosis-inducing agents have been shown to activate jun and fos expression, including DNA-damaging agents (57Kumari S.R. Alvarez-Gonzalez R. Cancer Invest. 2000; 18: 715-721Google Scholar), oxidant injury (58Jin N. Hatton N.D. Harrington M.A. Xia X. Larsen S.H. Rhoades R.A. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2000; 29: 736-746Google Scholar), and natural products such as flavonoids and isothiocyanates (59Kong A.N. Yu R. Chen C. Mandlekar S. Primiano T. Arch. Pharm. Res. (Seoul). 2000; 23: 1-16Google Scholar).ATF3 homodimers bind to the ATF/cAMP-responsive element consensus sites and repress transcription of downstream genes. However, ATF3 also forms a nonfunctional heterodimer with GADD153, thereby up-regulating gene transcription (60Chen B.P. Wolfgang C.D. Hai T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1157-1168Google Scholar). GADD153, a small nuclear protein, dimerizes with other CCAAT/enhancer-binding proteins and is normally expressed at very low levels, but is markedly up-regulated during endoplasmic reticulum stress (61Outinen P.A. Sood S.K. Liaw P.C. Sarge K.D. Maeda N. Hirsh J. Ribau J. Podor T.J. Weitz J.I. Austin R.C. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 213-221Google Scholar) and apoptosis (62Eymin B. Dubrez L. Allouche M. Solary E. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 686-695Google Scholar). Parallel up-regulation ofATF3 and GADD153 transcripts has also been observed during MG132-induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells (63Zimmermann J. Erdmann D. Lalande I. Grossenbacher R. Noorani M. Furst P. Oncogene. 2000; 19: 2913-2920Google Scholar) and Jurkat cells. 7B. Coyle, unpublished data. These results suggest that GADD153/ATF3 heterodimers may be formed and that genes normally repressed by ATF3 would be up-regulated, perhaps facilitating the necrotic cell death induced by TGF-Î²1 after prolonged exposure (28Freathy C. Brown D.G. Roberts R.A. Cain K. Hepatology. 2000; 32: 750-760Google Scholar).The stress-response cluster also contains TAB1 andTANK, which have been implicated in the activation of NF-ÎºB. TAK1 and its activator TAB1 have been shown to activate IÎºB kinase, thus stimulating NF-ÎºB activation (64Sakurai H. Miyoshi H. Toriumi W. Sugita T. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10641-10648Google Scholar). Similarly, TANK can stimulate activation by forming a signaling complex containing TANK, TRAF2, and TBK1, a novel IÎºB kinase-related kinase (65Pomerantz J.L. Baltimore D. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 6694-6704Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that the cells may undergo an NF-ÎºB-related stress response in the presence of Z-VAD-fmk. Interestingly, 9 of the 185 down-regulated genes encode proteins involved in antioxidant defense, particularly the glutathione redox cycle, which is the major defense system against ROS by normal aerobic mitochondrial metabolism. In the absence of antioxidants, ROS would increase to toxic levels; and significantly, ROS have previously been implicated in TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis in fetal hepatocytes (29Herrera B. Alvarez A.M. Sanchez A. Fernandez M. Roncero C. Benito M. Fabregat I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 741-751Google Scholar, 38Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I.

After TGF-Î²1 treatment, there is an early increase in ROS and a decrease in glutathione levels (66Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Google Scholar), which precede a decrease in ÎÏ and the release of cytochrome c (29Herrera B. Alvarez A.M. Sanchez A. Fernandez M. Roncero C. Benito M. Fabregat I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 741-751Google Scholar). Significantly, the TGF-Î²1-inducible transcription factor TIEG1 (TGF-Î²1-inducibleearly response gene-1) also induces apoptosis via an increase in ROS and loss of mitochondrial ÎÏ (67Ribeiro A. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Urrutia R. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1490-1497Google Scholar). TGF-Î²1-induced oxidative stress and apoptosis can be blocked in part by antioxidant treatment (66Sanchez A. Alvarez A.M. Benito M. Fabregat I. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7416-7422Google Scholar, 67Ribeiro A. Bronk S.F. Roberts P.J. Urrutia R. Gores G.J. Hepatology. 1999; 30: 1490-1497Google Scholar) and accentuated by inhibitors of glutathione synthesis (29Herrera B. Alvarez A.M. Sanchez A. Fernandez M. Roncero C. Benito M. Fabregat I. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 741-751Google Scholar). Glutathione is synthesized in a two-step reaction from glutamate and cysteine to forml-Î³-glutamylcysteine, which is then conjugated with glycine to produce reduced glutathione (for review, see Ref. 68Reed D.J. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1990; 30: 603-631Google Scholar). Our data show that two key enzymes (GLCLC and glutathione synthetase) involved in glutathione synthesis and CTH (cystathionine Î³-lyase), the terminal enzyme involved in synthesizing cysteine from methionine, are down-regulated at a very early stage in TGF-Î²1-mediated cell death (Fig. 3 and Table II). This would lead to a decrease in the levels of glutathione and an increase in ROS. In support of this conclusion, a recent study has shown that TGF-Î²1-induced glutathione depletion in alveolar epithelial cells is due to down-regulation of GLCLC (Î³-glutamylcysteine synthetase) (69Jardine H. MacNee W. Donaldson K. Rahman I. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21158-21166Google Scholar). This would lead to a decrease in glutathione levels and a subsequent increase in ROS, resulting in cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Consistent with this hypothesis, a recent study has shown that superoxide can directly trigger cytochrome c release and apoptosis in HepG2 cells via interaction with voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) independently of pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins (70Madesh M. Ramachandran A. Balasubramanian K.A. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 366: 240-248Google Scholar).The down-regulation of a battery of enzymes that are involved in protecting the cell against oxidative stress suggests that these genes are coordinately regulated. Cells treated with agents such astert-butylhydroquinone are protected against oxidative stress via the antioxidant-responsive element. Antioxidant-responsive element-like elements have been found in the promoter regions of the rat NQO1 and human NQO2 (NADPH:quinone oxidoreductase) genes, rat glutathione synthetase, and other antioxidant-related enzymes (for review, see Ref. 71Hayes J.D. Ellis E.M. Neal G.E. Harrison D.J. Manson M.M. Biochem. Soc. Symp. 1999; 64: 141-168Google Scholar; Ref. 72Mates J.M. Toxicology. 2000; 153: 83-104Google Scholar). Interestingly, a recent microarray analysis oftert-butylhydroquinone-treated human neuroblastoma cells has identified 63 genes that are significantly increased, many of which are involved (including GLCLC, GSR, andGSTM3 (brain glutathioneS-transferase)) in protecting the cell against oxidative stress (73Li J. Lee J.M. Johnson J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 388-394Google Scholar). In contrast TGF-Î²1appears to act in the opposite manner totert-butylhydroquinone and leads to down-regulation of many of these genes, perhaps by the induction of an as yet unidentified antioxidant-responsive element suppressor protein. Significantly, the time-dependent suppression of other antioxidant enzymes (viz. manganese-superoxide dismutase, copper/zinc-superoxide dismutase, and catalase) has also been demonstrated in primary hepatocytes following exposure to TGF-Î²1 (74Kayanoki Y. Fujii J. Suzuki K. Kawata S. Matsuzawa Y. Taniguchi N. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15488-15492Google Scholar).Another gene that was markedly up-regulated during TGF-Î²1and TGF-Î²1/Z-VAD-fmk treatment was FAT10, which encodes a ubiquitin-like protein that is synergistically induced by interferon-Î³ and tumor necrosis factor-Î± and which has been shown to induce apoptosis in a caspase-dependent manner (45Raasi S. Schmidtke G. Groettrup M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 35334-35343Google Scholar). There is increasing evidence that TGF-Î²1 signaling is regulated by proteasomal degradation of component members of the pathway. For example, TIEG1 is rapidly induced by TGF-Î²1 and serves to down-regulate the negative feedback inhibition of the inhibitory protein Smad7, which is also induced by TGF-Î²1 (75Johnsen S.A. Subramaniam M. Janknecht R. Spelsberg T.C. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 5783-5790Google Scholar). TIEG1 interacts with SIAH1 (seven in absentiahomlogue-1), a ubiquitin-protein isopeptide ligase, and is targeted for destruction by the proteasome (76Johnsen S.A. Subramaniam M. Monroe D.G. Janknecht R. Spelsberg T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30754-30759Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that activated Smad2 is polyubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, thereby terminating the signaling pathway (31Lo R.S. MassagueÌ J. Nat. Cell. Biol. 1999; 1: 472-478Google Scholar). Inhibition of proteasomal degradation would be predicted to prolong TGF-Î²1 signaling, whereas in contrast, we have found that proteasome inhibitors (MG132 and lactacystin) abrogated TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis. 8C. Freathy and K. Cain, unpublished data. This suggests that the involvement of the proteasome in TGF-Î²1-induced apoptosis implicates some other as yet identified target and perhaps that FAT10 targets an anti-apoptotic molecule for proteasomal degradation.The microarray data indicate that TGF-Î²1 induces apoptosis by specifically down-regulating a set of genes that encode enzymes involved in protecting the cell"

https://openalex.org/W1603669250,"Pre-eclampsia (PE) is a leading cause of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity. As free fatty acid metabolism is abnormally regulated in PE, we investigated the intracellular Ca2+([Ca2+]i) response to arachidonic acid (AA) in primary cultures of human umbilical artery smooth muscle cells (HUASMC). AA (50 microM) caused a significantly greater [Ca2+]i elevation in PE than in normal HUASMC, with many cells displaying a delayed secondary increase. The nonmetabolizable AA analog ETYA did not induce a response, suggesting that the augmented PE response depends on an AA metabolite. Inhibition of the AA metabolizing cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase pathways did not affect the AA response of PE HUASMC but induced in normal cells the secondary rise of [Ca2+]i observed in PE cells. This potentiated response and the response in PE cells were blocked by inhibitors of the monooxygenase pathway, a third AA metabolizing pathway. We conclude that the [Ca2+]i response of HUASMC is elevated in PE because of an increased level of a monooxygenase metabolite that stimulates Ca2+ influx and that this can be mimicked in normal cells by blocking cyclooxygenase or lipoxygenase to divert AA to the monooxygenase. This and our work with fetal endothelial cells (FASEB J. 10.1096/fj.01-0916fje) demonstrate phenotypic changes in the fetal vasculature in PE."
