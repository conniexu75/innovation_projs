https://openalex.org/W2083653513,"Major phenotypic changes evolve in parallel in nature by molecular mechanisms that are largely unknown. Here, we use positional cloning methods to identify the major chromosome locus controlling armor plate patterning in wild threespine sticklebacks. Mapping, sequencing, and transgenic studies show that the Ectodysplasin (EDA) signaling pathway plays a key role in evolutionary change in natural populations and that parallel evolution of stickleback low-plated phenotypes at most freshwater locations around the world has occurred by repeated selection of Eda alleles derived from an ancestral low-plated haplotype that first appeared more than two million years ago. Members of this clade of low-plated alleles are present at low frequencies in marine fish, which suggests that standing genetic variation can provide a molecular basis for rapid, parallel evolution of dramatic phenotypic change in nature."
https://openalex.org/W2084089807,"The ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase signals the presence of DNA double-strand breaks in mammalian cells by phosphorylating proteins that initiate cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA repair. We show that the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex acts as a double-strand break sensor for ATM and recruits ATM to broken DNA molecules. Inactive ATM dimers were activated in vitro with DNA in the presence of MRN, leading to phosphorylation of the downstream cellular targets p53 and Chk2. ATM autophosphorylation was not required for monomerization of ATM by MRN. The unwinding of DNA ends by MRN was essential for ATM stimulation, which is consistent with the central role of single-stranded DNA as an evolutionarily conserved signal for DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2136725005,"Sites of transcription of polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated RNAs for 10 human chromosomes were mapped at 5–base pair resolution in eight cell lines. Unannotated, nonpolyadenylated transcripts comprise the major proportion of the transcriptional output of the human genome. Of all transcribed sequences, 19.4, 43.7, and 36.9% were observed to be polyadenylated, nonpolyadenylated, and bimorphic, respectively. Half of all transcribed sequences are found only in the nucleus and for the most part are unannotated. Overall, the transcribed portions of the human genome are predominantly composed of interlaced networks of both poly A+ and poly A– annotated transcripts and unannotated transcripts of unknown function. This organization has important implications for interpreting genotype-phenotype associations, regulation of gene expression, and the definition of a gene."
https://openalex.org/W2105057212,"The quantitative relation between transcription factor concentrations and the rate of protein production from downstream genes is central to the function of genetic networks. Here we show that this relation, which we call the gene regulation function (GRF), fluctuates dynamically in individual living cells, thereby limiting the accuracy with which transcriptional genetic circuits can transfer signals. Using fluorescent reporter genes and fusion proteins, we characterized the bacteriophage lambda promoter P R in Escherichia coli . A novel technique based on binomial errors in protein partitioning enabled calibration of in vivo biochemical parameters in molecular units. We found that protein production rates fluctuate over a time scale of about one cell cycle, while intrinsic noise decays rapidly. Thus, biochemical parameters, noise, and slowly varying cellular states together determine the effective single-cell GRF. These results can form a basis for quantitative modeling of natural gene circuits and for design of synthetic ones."

We found that these bacteria assembled on food particles and mucus, selectively induced outer-membrane polysaccharide-binding proteins and glycoside hydrolases, prioritized the consumption of liberated hexose sugars, and revealed a capacity to turn to host mucus glycans when polysaccharides were absent from the diet. This flexible foraging behavior should contribute to ecosystem stability and functional diversity."
https://openalex.org/W2010825644,"We show that the capacitance of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is highly sensitive to a broad class of chemical vapors and that this transduction mechanism can form the basis for a fast, low-power sorption-based chemical sensor. In the presence of a dilute chemical vapor, molecular adsorbates are polarized by the fringing electric fields radiating from the surface of a SWNT electrode, which causes an increase in its capacitance. We use this effect to construct a high-performance chemical sensor by thinly coating the SWNTs with chemoselective materials that provide a large, class-specific gain to the capacitance response. Such SWNT chemicapacitors are fast, highly sensitive, and completely reversible."
https://openalex.org/W2107342968,"Accurately predicting noise propagation in gene networks is crucial for understanding signal fidelity in natural networks and designing noise-tolerant gene circuits. To quantify how noise propagates through gene networks, we measured expression correlations between genes in single cells. We found that noise in a gene was determined by its intrinsic fluctuations, transmitted noise from upstream genes, and global noise affecting all genes. A model was developed that explains the complex behavior exhibited by the correlations and reveals the dominant noise sources. The model successfully predicts the correlations as the network is systematically perturbed. This approach provides a step toward understanding and manipulating noise propagation in more complex gene networks."
https://openalex.org/W2084200591,"The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) and NF-E2 p45-related factor (NRF2) are two distinct transcription factors involved in the regulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Increasing evidence from several studies implies that AHR and NRF2 have direct links, but the molecular mechanism remains unknown. In this work we demonstrate for the first time that Nrf2 gene transcription is directly modulated by AHR activation. DNA sequence analyses of the mouse Nrf2 promoter revealed one xenobiotic response element (XRE)-like element (XREL1) located at –712 and two additional XRE-like elements located at +755 (XREL2) and +850 (XREL3). Functional analysis using luciferase assay showed that XREL1, XREL2, and XREL3 are all inducible by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin treatment, with XREL2 being the most potent. The functionality of these XRE-like elements was further confirmed by mutagenesis and gel shift experiments. Finally, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation assay to show a direct binding of AHR to the Nrf2 promoter. Cells with silenced AHR expression using siRNA also lost NRF2 mRNA induction by 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin. These new data position NRF2-antioxidant response element downstream in the AHR-XRE pathway. Moreover, direct regulation of NRF2 by AHR contributes to couple phase I and II enzymes into an integrated system facilitating more effective xenobiotic and carcinogen detoxification.

Moreover, direct regulation of NRF2 by AHR contributes to couple phase I and II enzymes into an integrated system facilitating more effective xenobiotic and carcinogen detoxification. Environmental exposure to carcinogens is an important risk factor for common cancers (1Lichtenstein P. Holm N.V. Verkasalo P.K. Iliadou A. Kaprio J. Koskenvuo M. Pukkala E. Skytthe A. Hemminki K. N. Engl. J. Med. 2000; 343: 78-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (3205) Google Scholar). Because carcinogen exposure is important in cancer risk, enhancing the body's carcinogen-detoxifying capability is a promising approach for cancer prevention (2Kensler T.W. Qian G.S. Chen J.G. Groopman J.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 3Sudakin D.L. J. Toxicol. Clin. Toxicol. 2003; 41: 195-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Like antibody-mediated immunity, nature has evolved a flexible, comprehensive enzyme system to detoxify a range of environmental toxicants, mutagens, and potential carcinogens. The cellular detoxifying system is divided into phase I and II drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs). 1The abbreviations used are: DME, drug-metabolizing enzymes; CYP, cytochrome P450; GST, glutathione S-transferase; NQO1, NADP(H):quino oxidoreductase 1; ARE, antioxidant response element; XRE, xenobiotic response element; AHR, aryl hydrocarbon receptor; TCDD, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin; NRF2, NF-E2 p45-related factor 2; EQ, ethoxyquin; siRNA, small interfering RNA; RT, reverse transcription. The phase I enzymes consist of a gene superfamily of cytochrome P450s (CYPs); phase II enzymes include detoxifying and antioxidant enzymes such as glutathione S-transferases, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase, NADP(H):quino oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), and UDP:glucuronosyl transferases (4Hayes J.D. McMahon M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Critical DNA sequences are frequently found single or multiply in the promoters of these genes, including antioxidant response element (ARE) and xenobiotic response element (XRE). The ARE is present in many phase II genes, whereas the XRE is found in both phase I and II genes (5Rushmore T.H. Kong A.N.T. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). XRE- and ARE-driven regulation of DME genes has two pathways that are generally thought to function independently. The XRE motif is the ultimate target of a protein complex that includes a ligand-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) translocating to the nucleus after binding to a chaperone nuclear transporter ARNT. The AHR-ARNT complex binds to the XRE motif and activates a battery of genes (4Hayes J.D. McMahon M. Cancer Lett. 2001; 174: 103-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 5Rushmore T.H. Kong A.N.T. Curr. Drug Metab. 2002; 3: 481-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). As well, a recent paper reported an alternate cis-acting element, called XRE II, which binds an as yet unknown protein factor with an AHR-ARNT heterodimer as a coactivator (6Sogawa K. Numayama-Tsuruta K. Takahashi T. Matsushita N. Miura C. Nikawa J. Gotoh O. Kikuchi Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 318: 746-755Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). AHR is a ligand-activated transcription factor that mediates toxicity of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) as well as induction of three cytochrome P450 enzymes and a number of phase II enzymes including several glutathione S-transferase isoforms. AHR is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that binds both synthetic chemicals such as TCDD and naturally occurred phytochemicals, sterols, and heme breakdown products. Whereas persistent activation of the AHR signaling pathway is responsible for the spectrum of adverse effects produced by metabolically stable AHR ligands such as TCDD, activation of AHR signaling by TCDD at nontoxic concentrations or by less persistent AHR agonists has also been shown to have some beneficial antitumorigenic/antiestrogenic activities (7Safe S. McDougal A. Int. J. Oncol. 2002; 20: 1123-1128PubMed Google Scholar, 8Koliopanos A. Kleeff J. Xiao Y. Safe S. Zimmermann A. Buchler M.W. Friess H. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 6059-6070Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Binding of the ARE promoter by a number of proteins has been shown; however, studies in a mouse knock-out model have placed particular emphasis on the basic leucine zipper transcription factor NRF2 (NF-E2 p45-related factor 2) (9McMahon M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Chanas S.A. Henderson C.J. McLellan L.I. Wolf C.R. Cavin C. Hayes J.D. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 3299-3307PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ramos-Gomez M. Kwak M.K. Dolan P.M. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Talalay P. Kensler T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3410-3415Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar). Electrophilic compounds stimulate the cytosolic protein KEAP1, activating and releasing the transcription factor NRF2 from the KEAP1·NRF2 complex. In the nucleus the activated NRF2 forms a complex with small Mafs (11Motohashi H. O'Connor T. Katsuoka F. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Gene (Amst.). 2002; 294: 1-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar, 12Motohashi H. Katsuoka F. Engel J.D. Yamamoto M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6379-6384Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar), and this protein complex binds to the ARE motif, activating the ARE gene battery. Exposure to a variety of inducers with specific KEAP1 sites releases NRF2 for nuclear localization in the ARE. Recent data show that NRF2 is degraded by the ubiquitin-dependent pathway (13McMahon M.

A range of enzymes involved in cellular detoxification are thus induced, including for example the rate-limiting enzyme in GSH synthesis γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase (20Moinova H.R. Mulcahy R.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 261: 661-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). It is generally considered that the ARE and XRE pathways are distinct. The conventional explanation of how bi-functional agents activate both phase I and II DMEs is a sequential mechanism whereby XRE-driven enzymes metabolize the inducer to an intermediary capable of ARE activation. However, Jaiswal and Radjendirane (21Radjendirane V. Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) showed that TCDD, a metabolically stable AHR inducer, can induce the human NQO1 gene expression through ARE activation. Moreover, using our cell-based system for XRE/ARE-activating drugs, we showed that some phase II-activating agents (ARE inducers) require the presence of AHR, suggesting a more direct cross-talk between the ARE and XRE pathways (22Miao W. Hu L. Kandouz M. Hamilton D. Batist G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). A more recent paper showed that induction of NQO1 by TCDD requires NRF2, implicating a link between AHR and NRF2 (23Ma Q. Kinneer K. Bi Y. Chan J.Y. Kan Y.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). In this work, we provide the first evidence that NRF2, the master transcriptional factor in the ARE pathway, can be directly modulated by the AHR-XRE activation, representing a novel molecular pathway in modulating drug-metabolizing enzymes. Chemicals and Antibodies—TCDD was from Wellington laboratories Inc. (ON, Canada). Anti-NRF2 antibody (h-300) was bought from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Anti-AHR antibody (RPT9) was from Abcam Inc. (Cambridge, MA). Cell Lines and Tissue Culture—AHR-deficient cell line tao, CYP1A1-deficient cell line c37, and their parent cell line mouse hepatoma 1c1c7 were obtained from ATCC and maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. Western Blot—Mouse hepatoma cells 1c1c7, tao, and c37 were treated with TCDD for indicated times before harvesting. 30 μg of cell lysate per each sample was loaded and run through a 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel before being transferred electrophoretically onto a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked with 5% fat-free milk solution and then sequentially incubated with primary antibody and enzyme-conjugated secondary antibody. The results were documented on x-ray film with ECL detection and autophotography. Quantitative RT-PCR—Mouse hepatoma cells were treated with test compounds for an indicated time, and total RNA was prepared with TRIzol (Invitrogen). RT-PCR was performed in two steps. First, the mRNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using Expand reverse transcriptase (Roche Applied Science). Then the cDNA was used as the template for quantitative PCR detection using the LightCycler Fast-Start DNA Master SYBR Green I kit (Roche Applied Science). The real-time PCR conditions were optimized as 95 °C for 7 min and 45 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, 61 °C for 5 s, and 72 °C for 20 s followed by routine melting and cool conditions. The primers for amplifying mouse NRF2 were 5′-ttggcagagacattcccat-3′ and 5′-gctgccaccgtcactggg-3′. The primers for amplifying mouse glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were 5′-atgcagggatgatgttctgg-3′ and 5′-tcaacgaccccttcattgac-3′. RNA Interference—The coding sequence of mouse AHR was targeted with the following AHR siRNA: 5′-GCA GAA UCC CAC AUC CGC AUG AUU A-3′ (Stealth™ RNA, Invitrogen). Briefly, 1c1c7 cells were seeded in a 6-well plate and transfected in the presence of a 100 pm concentration of either siRNA or scramble control RNA in a 250-μl volume with Lipofectamine™ 2000. At 48 h the efficiency of AHR silencing was analyzed by Western blot detection of AHR protein level. Molecular Cloning and Vector Construction—Mouse Nrf2 promoter segments were generated by PCR amplification. Briefly, genomic DNA prepared from 1c1c7 cells was used as template, the upstream promoter segment (from –748 to + 100), the downstream promoter segment (from –300 to + 904), and the whole promoter segment (from –748 to +904) were amplified separately and then cloned into the KpnI and MluI sites of pGL3-basic vector (Promega) containing a firefly luciferase reporter gene. A series of deletion mutants of the Nrf2 promoter was also generated by PCR and cloned into pGL3-basic vector. The sense and antisense oligonucleotides containing XREL1, XREL2, and XREL3 were synthesized by Invitrogen. The annealed oligos were ligated to the KpnI and MluI sites of pGL3-promoter vector (Promega) containing a heterologous SV40 promoter and a firefly luciferase report gene. All recombinant plasmids were sequenced to confirm the accuracy of cloning. Site-directed Mutagenesis—Site-directed mutagenesis experiments were performed with a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, the primers containing mutated sequences of AREL1, AREL2, and XREL1 were synthesized by Invitrogen. Mutation of AREL2, AREL1, and XREL1 were sequentially performed with the pGL3 recombinant plasmid –749 to +100. Three pGL3 plasmids containing AREL2, ARE1, plus XREL1 mutations were successfully generated (Fig. 6A). All constructs were sequenced to confirm the accuracy of mutagenesis. The AREL1mutation is cgacttcagcccacctgactccgccatgcc to cgacttcagcccaccaaactccgccatgcc; the AREL2 mutation is ccgaaactggcgccacagtcagccggtggagcg to ccgaaactggcgccacagaaagccggtggagcg; the XREL1 mutation is gcgagcacgagtttgcagcgtggactcatccatctccctgg to gcgagcacgagtttgcagataggactcatccatctccctgg (the bold letters represent the core sequences of the ARE or XRE, and the underlined letters represent mutated nucleotides). Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—Cells were seeded at 9 × 104 per well using 24-well plates and grown overnight in normal media. The following day cells were transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with pGL3 luciferase reporter constructs. The plasmid pRL, containing a Renilla reniformis luciferase reporter gene, was co-transfected as internal control. Briefly, cells were incubated with DNA-Lipofectamine complexes for 5 h, after which they were washed gently and cultured in fresh serum-supplemented media. Then cells were treated with test compounds for 24 h before harvesting for luciferase assay. Luciferase activities were analyzed in 20-μl cell extracts with the dual luciferase assay kit (Promega) on a Lumat LB 9507 luminometer (Berthold Technologies, Bad Wildbad, Germany). The relative luciferase activities reported are expressed as a ratio of the pGL3 reporter activity to that of the control plasmid pRL. -Fold induction is expressed as the ratio of induction from treated cells versus untreated. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent measurements. Statistical analysis (Student's t test) was performed by comparison of treated and untreated cells (*, p < 0.05). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Gel shift assays were performed as described previously (40Denison M.S. Fisher J.M. Whitlock Jr., J.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17221-17224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with TCDD for 2 h before preparation of nuclear extracts. For DNA-protein binding reactions, 5 μg of nuclear protein was mixed with 1 μg of poly(dI-dC) in a 24-μl buffer containing 30 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.9, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 14% glycerol. The reaction mixture was preincubated for 10 min at room temperature, after which the probe DNA was added. Incubation was continued for another 20 min at room temperature. Competition reactions were carried out under the same conditions with the addition of 200-fold unlabeled oligos or 1 μg of related antibody. Protein-DNA complexes were resolved through a 5% polyacrylamide gel using 0.25× Tris borate/EDTA buffer. The gel was then dried and subjected to autoradiography with an intensifying screen at –80 °C overnight. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay— chromatin immunoprecipitation assay was performed using a kit from Upstate Biotechnology Co. Briefly, hepatoma 1c1c7 cells were exposed to TCDD for 1.5 h, and then cells were treated with formaldehyde for protein-DNA cross-linking. The soluble chromatin of these cells was prepared according to the kit protocol. Ten percent of the diluted chromatin solution was reserved as the total input sample. Aliquots of the remaining diluted chromatin solution was incubated with either an anti-AHR antibody or pre-immune IgG. Immunoprecipitation was performed overnight at 4 °C with rotation. After washing and elution, DNA was purified with phenolchloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation and then re-suspended in 20 μl of water. 2 μl of DNA solution was used as template for 35 cycles of PCR amplification with designated primers. Specific primer pairs were used to amplify the promoter regions of CYP1a1 and Nrf2 (Fig. 10A). The primer sequences for CYP1a1 were 5′-ctatctcttaaaccccaccccaa-3′ and 5′-ctaagtatggtggaggaaagggtg-3′. The primer sequences for Nrf2-XREL1 were 5′-gaatccacttcggtgattctg-3′ and 5′-tcagttgctggtgctcaaac-3′. The primers for Nrf2-XREL2 were 5′-acccccgttctacgacttg-3′ and 5′-ggttcccaggctgaaggag-3′. The non-related gene Connexin 43 was used as negative control (Fig. 10A). The primer sequences for Connexin 43 were 5′-cctagtgagagggtgcttcg-3′ and 5′-cagaccagagttgccagaca-3′.Fig. 1NRF2 protein level regulated by TCDD treatment. A, 1c1c7 cells were treated with Me2SO vehicle and 1 and 10 nm TCDD for 2, 6, 16, and 24 h. NRF2 protein expression was monitored by Western blot detection. B, density analyses using Scion Image indicated that induction is 2–3-fold, starting from 16 h. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of three independent measurements.

In our Western blot experiments, NRF2 protein was identified as a doublet band at 100 kDa by comparing with a recombinant NRF2 protein standard (Fig. 1A), and the Nrf2 protein expression was significantly up-regulated 2–3-fold at 16 and 24 h (Fig. 1B). The quantitative RT-PCR experiments revealed that the NRF2 mRNA level was remarkably elevated up to 3.5-fold by TCDD treatments; up-regulation started at 6 h and was sustained at 24 h (Fig. 2A). These data imply that modulation happens at the gene transcription level. To further clarify if AHR is necessary for this regulation, the AHR-deficient cell line tao and CYP1A1-deficient cell line c37 were each treated with 10 nm TCDD for 16 h, and their NRF2 mRNA expressions were compared. The quantitative RT-PCR data showed that NRF2 mRNA was substantially induced in 1c1c7 and c37 cell lines, but the induction was largely abolished in tao cell line (Fig. 2B), suggesting an AHR-dependent mechanism. To exclude the possibility that the AHR-deficient cell tao have other differences that account for the phenotype, we created a transient AHR-silenced cell (80–90% AHR knock-down at 48 h) by transfection of AHR-targeted siRNA (Fig. 2C). Induction studies were performed in 1c1c7 cells, transfected with either 100 pm AHR-targeted siRNA or the scramble control RNA. After 24 h the cells were treated with or without 10 nm TCDD for another 24 h before RNAs were harvested. The quantitative RT-PCR data showed that the induction of NRF2 mRNA by TCDD seen in controls cells is abolished in the AHR-silenced cell (Fig. 2C). Collectively, these data indicate that NRF2 expression may be regulated through AHR activation at the gene transcription level. XRE-like Elements Found in mouse Nrf2 Promoter—To study transcriptional regulation of Nrf2, sequences (NT 039207) containing mouse Nrf2 promoter were retrieved from the NCBI mouse genome data base. Computer-aided analyses showed that in the 5′-flanking region of the Nrf2 promoter, in addition to the two ARE-like elements (located at –317 and –579, respectively) reported previously, there is also one XRE-like sequence (XREL1) located at –712. The downstream untranslated region, which is often important for transcriptional regulation, was also analyzed. Two additional XRE-like elements were found located at +755 (XREL2) and at +870 (XREL3) within the first intron of the gene (Fig. 3). Molecular Cloning of Mouse Nrf2 Promoter—Using mouse genomic DNA as template, PCR was used to amplify the upstream promoter segment (–749 to +100), the downstream promoter segment (–300 to +904), and the whole promoter segment (–749 + 904) separately. The PCR products were then cloned into pGL3-basic vectors, which were used in subsequent functional analyses. The luciferase assays showed that in 1c1c7 cells, the upstream promoter was induced 2.6-fold, the downstream promoter was up-regulated 3.8-fold, and the whole promoter was induced 5.2-fold in response to treatment of 10 nm TCDD (Fig. 4A), but all inductions were diminished or absent in the tao cell line (Fig. 4B). Series Deletion Mutant Analyses—To assess functionality of XRE-like elements in the promoter, a series of deletion mutants were created for both upstream and downstream promoter fragments (Fig. 5A). The luciferase data showed that the –749 + 100 fragment, which contains both XREL1 and ARE elements is potent, induced 2.9-fold at 10 nm TCDD; however, the –698 + 100 fragment containing only the ARE elements but no XREL1 is less active and induced 1.8-fold at 10 nm TCDD. The –300 + 100 fragment containing neither XREL1 nor AREs had only a marginal response (Fig. 5B). In experiments with the downstream promoter segment, the –300 + 904 fragment containing both XREL2 and XREL3 is most potent and induced 4.4-fold at 10 nm TCDD treatment; the –300 + 859 fragment containing only XREL2 is also active and induced 3.2-fold at 10 nm TCDD treatment, whereas the –300 + 740 fragment containing neither XREL2 nor XREL3 has no significant response (Fig. 5C). Site-directed Mutagenesis—To further evaluate functions of the XRE and ARE elements in the upstream promoter, site-directed mutagenesis was performed (Fig. 6A). The luciferase assay showed that wild type promoter (–749 to +100) responded robustly to both TCDD or EQ (ethoxyquin). Mutation of two ARE elements only slightly reduced induction by TCDD but completely abolished the response to EQ. However mutation at the XREL1 site substantially diminished the response to TCDD but did not affect the response to EQ. Simultaneous mutation of XREL1, AREl1, and AREL2 sequences completely abolished the response to both TCDD and EQ (Fig. 6B). These data indicate that ARE elements are responsible for EQ activation; however, both XRE and ARE elements respond to TCDD treatments. Molecular Cloning of XRE-like Elements of Mouse Nrf2 Promoter—To compare the potency of three XRE elements, oligos containing XREL1, XREL2, and XREL3 were cloned into the pGL3 promoter vector, which contains a heterologous SV40 promoter. Luciferase assays showed that XREL1, XREL2, XREL3, and DRE3 (the prototype XRE element found in CYP1a1) were induced 2.9-, 4.1-, 2.7-, and 4.3-fold, respectively, in response to 10 nm TCDD treatment. The XREL2 is more potent than XREL1 and XREL3 and is in the same range as DRE3 (Fig. 7). Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Gel shift experiments were also performed to evaluate XRE elements found in the Nrf2 promoter. The results show that XREL1 (Fig. 8A) and XREL3 (Fig. 8B) form a retarded band (indicated by an arrow), which can be induced by TCDD. Competition assay showed that the band was competed by excess unlabeled DRE3 oligos or AHR antibody but not by unrelated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody (Fig. 8, A and B). In the case of XREL2 (Fig. 9), we observed multiple retarded bands, but only one of which (indicated by the arrow) was significantly induced by TCDD. Competition assays showed that nearly all bands can be competed by unlabeled XREL2 oligos, but only the indicated band can be competed by DRE3 or AHR antibody (Fig. 9). The result suggests that the indicated band is specific to the XRE core sequence and AHR binding, and we hypothesize that other bands may be related to the flanking sequences in the XREL2.Fig. 9Effects of TCDD on EMSA of XREL2. Double-stranded oligos containing XREL2 were labeled with 32P and used as gel shift probe. Nuclear extracts were prepared from 1c1c cells that had been treated with 10 nm TCDD. EMSA was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” There are multiple retarded bands, but only one of them (indicated by the arrow) was significantly induced by TCDD treatment. In competition assays nearly all bands can be competed by excess XREL2 oligos; however, only the indicated band (shown by an arrow) can be specifically competed by excess DRE3 oligos or AHR antibody but not affected by glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) antibody.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assay—1c1c7 cells were treated with 10 nm TCDD for 1.5 h, and soluble chromatin preparations were used for immunoprecipitation with AHR antibody. The results show that the sequences specific to the XREs found in the Nrf2 promoter as well as from the CYP1a1 promoter can be recovered from AHR immunoprecipitates but not from pre-immune Ig precipitates (Fig. 10B). Moreover, substantially more Nrf2 promoter sequences were recovered from AHR immunoprecipitates after treatment with 1 or 10 nm TCDD compared with vehicle Me2SO treatment samples (Fig. 10C). A large body of evidence, based on preclinical and clinical research, indicates that modulation of the body's DME could provide an effective approach for cancer prevention (2Kensler T.W. Qian G.S. Chen J.G. Groopman J.D. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar, 24Levi M.S. Borne R.F. Williamson J.S. Curr. Med. Chem. 2001; 8: 1349-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Understanding the molecular mechanism of DME modulation is critically important in designing rational cancer preventive agents. Although many naturally occurring or synthetic compounds have shown robust effects on DME modulation, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. It has long been recognized that nearly all bi-functional inducers can activate XRE and ARE pathways concomitantly. The most common explanation is an indirect link. Briefly, bi-functional compounds first activate the AHR-XRE pathway and induce phase I enzymes including CYP1A1, which in turn metabolize these compounds. The resulting electrophilic intermediary metabolites further activate the NRF2-ARE pathway. A series of studies conducted by Shertzer and co-workers (25Senft A.P. Dalton T.P. Nebert D.W. Genter M.B. Puga A. Hutchinson R.J. Kerzee J.K. Uno S. Shertzer H.G. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 2002; 33: 1268-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 26Shertzer H.G. Nebert D.W. Puga A. Ary M. Sonntag D. Dixon K. Robinson L.J. Cianciolo E. Dalton T.P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 44-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar) showed that TCDD can induce reactive oxygen species and that the induction is dependent on the AHR, which implicates another indirect approach of activating phase II enzymes through reactive oxygen species. Using gel shift experiments, Nebert and co-workers (27Vasiliou V. Puga A. Chang C.Y. Tabor M.W. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) reported that AHR may bind to both XRE and ARE consensus sequences, suggesting that one transcription factor may activate two distinct cis-acting regulatory elements (27Vasiliou V. Puga A. Chang C.Y. Tabor M.W. Nebert D.W. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1995; 50: 2057-2068Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). This suggested direct interaction between the two pathways unrelated to the metabolic products of either, but it required further proof. In addition, Jaiswal and Radjendirane (21Radjendirane V. Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported that TCDD, a metabolically stable AHR inducer, can induce NQO1 via an ARE element (21Radjendirane V. Jaiswal A.K. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 58: 1649-1655Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Using Nrf2-null cells, Ma et al. (23Ma Q. Kinneer K. Bi Y. Chan J.Y. Kan Y.W. Biochem. J. 2004; 377: 205-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) showed that NRF2 is involved in the activation of NQO1 by TCDD, but the underlying molecular mechanism was not known. We have also shown that some bi-functional compounds including TCDD can only activate the ARE element in the presence of AHR (22Miao W. Hu L. Kandouz M. Hamilton D. Batist G. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2004; 67: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Based on the experimental evidence from different laboratories, we hypothesized that NRF2, the master transcription factor for the ARE pathway, could be downstream target of regulation by AHR activation. We did find that NRF2 expression is induced by TCDD at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, experiments with AHR-deficient cells showed that AHR is an indispensable factor involved in the induction of NRF2 by TCDD. These preliminary findings led us to examine the Nrf2 promoter sequences. The mouse Nrf2 promoter was cloned in 1996 (28Chan K. Lu R. Chang J.C. Kan Y.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 13943-13948Crossref PubMed Scopus (522) Google Scholar), with further analysis in 2002 showing two ARE-like elements in the 5′ flanking region, at least one of which is activated by Nrf2 binding (29Kwak M.K. Itoh K. Yamamoto M. Kensler T.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 2883-2892Crossref PubMed Scopus (467) Google Scholar). Because the Nrf2 promoter has not been studied in detail, we retrieved the mouse promoter sequence of Nrf2 from the NCBI genome data base. Using computer-aided analyses, we found that one XRE-like element is located at –712, which is close to the functional ARE-L2 (–579). It has been reported that functional XRE and ARE elements exist in the proximity in promoters of several important detoxifying genes including GST (30Rushmore T.H. King R.G. Paulson K.E. Pickett C.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3826-3830Crossref PubMed Scopus (390) Google Scholar) and NQR (31Favreau L.V. Pickett C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4556-4561Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Using series deletion and site-directed mutagenesis, we showed that both XRE and ARE elements are responsible for the induction induced by TCDD. In recent years mounting evidence showed that the promoter downstream region, especially the un-translated sequences within introns, are very important in transcriptional regulation (32Dyer K.D. Nitto T. Moreau J.M. McDevitt A.L. Rosenberg H.F. Mamm. Genome. 2004; 15: 126-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar, 33Klenova E. Scott A.C. Roberts J. Shamsuddin S. Lovejoy E.A. Bergmann S.

(Tokyo). 2004; 135: 259-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). In our previous work we found an XRE element within the first intron of rGSTA5 that is active in regulating transcription (36Miao W. Hu L. Kandouz M. Batist G. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 64: 346-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Therefore, we also checked the sequences downstream of the mRNA initiation site of Nrf2. We found no ARE-like elements but did find two XRE-like elements at +755 and +870, respectively. The existence of multiple copies of XREs in DME gene promoters has been extensively studied before (37Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Imataka H. Sogawa K. Yasumoto K. Kikuchi Y. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 706-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar, 38Zhang L. Savas U. Alexander D.L. Jefcoate C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5174-5183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Our data also showed that tandem arrangement of these two XREs is responsible for Nrf2 promoter response to a greater extent than the single upstream XRE sequence. Finally, a chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that AHR specifically binds the Nrf2-XRE sequence. We compared the DNA sequence of mouse Nrf2 promoter with those of the rat and human Nrf2 promoters. The comparisons showed that mouse and rat have a high degree of homology in promoter sequence, and both have three copies of XRE-like elements in 2-kilobase region of the promoter. Although the human promoter sequence has a very low percentage of homology with those of rodents, it does possess 5 copies of XRE-like elements in the 2-kilobase region of the promoter, although the location and sequence of these human XRE-like elements are distinct from those of rodent species. The conservation of multi-copy XREs in Nrf2 promoters from all three species suggests an important role in regulating Nrf2 gene expression. These novel observations demonstrate that Nrf2 gene expression is at least partly regulated by AHR inducers by activating multiple XRE elements in its promoter. This molecular event establishes a direct relation between AHR and NRF2 and places the NRF2-ARE pathway downstream of AHR-XRE activation in certain scenarios. This newly found pathway adds important knowledge in exploring the molecular mechanism of DME regulation (Fig. 11). It also clarifies previous data. The DME system is composed of phase I and II enzymes, which have generally been thought to operate distinctly and at times in series. Among investigators working on modifiers of drug-metabolizing enzymes for chemoprevention, it is also considered that phase II enzymes are exclusively involved in detoxifying xenobiotics and carcinogens, and this has led researchers to targeting at NRF2 and monofunctional agents preferentially. Meanwhile, phase I enzymes such as CYP1As are considered to have two-sided effects. On the one hand they do detoxify some xenobiotics and carcinogens, and on the other, they can also metabolically activate some pro-carcinogens into active carcinogens and eventually increase the risk of cancer development. A number of recent studies using CYP1a knock out mice (for review, see Ref. 39Nebert D.W. Dalton T.P. Okey A.B. Gonzalez F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 23847-23850Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar) suggest that phase I enzyme CYP1As are at least as important, if not more so, in detoxification as in metabolic activation. One conclusion, supported further by our work reported here, is that targeting the AHR/XRE pathway in chemoprevention is legitimate and may be very fruitful. Although NRF2 targeting agents for chemoprevention generally aim at releasing NRF2 from KEAP1, a plausible additional approach to increase NRF2 expression adds another dimension. In this work, our finding of direct modulation of NRF2 expression by AHR activation demonstrates a molecular mechanism whereby phase I and II enzymes are closely integrated, and their regulations are linked at the promoter transcription level. In view of these findings, it is clear that the induction of phase II enzymes happens virtually concurrently in both enzyme groups. In this way, phases I and II work together to make a coordinated and highly efficient system of detoxification. We thank Dr. Volker Blank for providing recombinant NRF2 protein standard and Anna Derjuga for help in establishing the quantitative RT-PCR conditions in this work."

There are few examples of trophic cascades strong enough to alter the abundance and composition of entire plant communities. We show that the introduction of arctic foxes ( Alopex lagopus ) to the Aleutian archipelago induced strong shifts in plant productivity and community structure via a previously unknown pathway. By preying on seabirds, foxes reduced nutrient transport from ocean to land, affecting soil fertility and transforming grasslands to dwarf shrub/forb-dominated ecosystems."

No consistent lead-lag relationships are observed during abrupt millennial warming events during the last ice age, allowing for the possibility that ocean circulation triggered some millenial climate changes. At the major glacial-interglacial transitions, the global carbon budget and thermohaline ocean circulation responded sequentially to the climate changes that forced the growth and decline of continental ice sheets."

Although angiogenic effects of extracellular S100A4 on endothelial cells have been clearly documented, its putative cell membrane receptors are still unknown. The identification of S100A4 endothelial receptor could facilitate the development of anti-angiogenic agents and metastasis inhibitors. This report provides evidence that angiogenic effects of S100A4 are induced through its interaction with annexin II (ANXA2) on the surface of endothelial cells. Similarly to S100A10 (also known as p11 or small subunit of annexin II heterotetramer) (28Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), S100A4, either alone or in a complex with annexin II, accelerates t-PA-mediated conversion of plasminogen to plasmin. Cell Culture—Primary human cerebromicrovascular endothelial cells (HCEC) were obtained from small intracortical microvessels and capillaries (20–112 μm) harvested from surgically excised human temporal cortex as previously described (29Stanimirovic D. Morley P. Ball R. Hamel E. Mealing G. Durkin J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). HCEC growth conditions and phenotypic properties were described in detail elsewhere (29Stanimirovic D. Morley P. Ball R. Hamel E. Mealing G. Durkin J.P. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 455-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Recombinant Proteins—Reverse transcription-PCR products produced from human placenta cDNA and corresponding to full-size human S100A4, S100A10, and annexin II were cloned in pGEX-4T or pGEX-6P vectors (Amersham Biosciences). N-terminal truncated forms of annexin II with its first 15 or 26 amino acids deleted, A2-del15 and A2-del26, respectively, and C-terminal mutant of S100A4 with its two last lysines substituted with leucines, S100A4-KK/LL, were also cloned as reverse transcription-PCR products in pGEX-4T vector. Glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins were purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4 beads and cleaved with thrombin or PreScission protease to remove glutathione S-transferase tag according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Biosciences). The quality of cloned proteins was assessed by Western blot. Western Blot Analysis—S100A4 was detected using rabbit polyclonal antibody (NeoMarkers). This antibody did not cross-react with recombinant S100A10 (data not shown). S100A10 and annexin II were detected with mouse monoclonal antibodies from BD Biosciences. Secondary antibodies were sheep anti-mouse (Amersham Biosciences) and goat anti-rabbit (BD Biosciences) antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Capillary-like Tube Formation—In vitro angiogenesis was assessed by capillary-like tube formation by HCEC grown in a basement membrane matrix, Matrigel™ (BD Biosciences), as previously described (30Autiero M. Waltenberger J. Communi D. Kranz A. Moons L. Lambrechts D. Kroll J. Plaisance S. De Mol M. Bono F. Kliche S. Fellbrich G. Ballmer-Hofer K. Maglione D. Mayr-Beyrle U. Dewerchin M. Dombrowski S.

HCEC (40,000 cells) were suspended in 500 μl of DMEM alone or DMEM containing different concentrations of S100A4 (10–100 nm). In some experiments, HCEC were preincubated with 10 mm 6-aminocaproic acid (6-ACA) for 10 min prior to the addition of S100A4. Capillary-like tube formation was analyzed after 24 h using an Olympus 1X50 microscope. Immunofluorescence Detection—Co-localization of S100A4 with annexin II in HCEC was studied by double immunocytochemistry. The cells were cultured on fibronectin-coated glass coverslips until 80% confluence. The cells were then exposed to 1 μm S100A4 in serum-free DMEM for 1 h at 37 °C, washed five times, and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min. Following fixation, the cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 min and subsequently blocked for nonspecific sites using 4% goat serum for 1 h. The cells were then incubated with anti-S100A4 antibody (1:100 dilution, 1 h, room temperature), washed, and exposed to fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500, 1 h). After blocking overnight with 4% goat serum, the cells were incubated with the anti-annexin II antibody (1:100; 1 h, room temperature), washed, and incubated with the secondary Alexa 568-labeled anti-mouse IgG antibody (Invitrogen, 1:500, 1 h). Omission of primary antibodies resulted in no staining. No cross-reactivity between the primary and non-corresponding secondary antibodies was detected. Imaging of the slides was performed using a confocal laser microscope Zeiss LSM 410 (Carl Zeiss). Immunoprecipitation—S100A4/annexin II complex formation was performed at equimolar concentrations of S100A4 and annexin II in 20 μl of Tris-buffered saline containing 2 mm CaCl2 or 2 mm EGTA at 37 °C. The resulting complexes were analyzed by immunoprecipitation. The reaction mixture was diluted 2-fold with Tris-buffered saline and incubated for 1 h with 10 μg/ml anti-S100A4 or anti-annexin II antibody and then precipitated with protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences) for 1 h at room temperature. The beads were washed with Tris-buffered saline and used for Western blot analysis with anti-annexin II or anti-S100A4 antibody, respectively. For the detection of S100A4/annexin II complex in HCEC culture, cells were washed three times with Hanks' balanced salt solution and treated with 1 μm S100A4 for 1 h at 37 °C in serum-free medium or left untreated as controls. After the addition of EGTA in a final concentration of 10 mm, the extraction of membrane-bound proteins was performed at room temperature for 20 min. Protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) was added to extracts, and they were centrifuged to remove cell debris. Supernatants were concentrated on YM-3 Centriplus (Amicon) devices, and 1 μg of total protein was used for immunoprecipitation with anti-annexin II antibody followed by Western blot analysis with anti-S100A4 antibody as described above. Peptide Synthesis—The peptide, ANXA2-N13, corresponding to the first 13 amino acids of human annexin II, STVHEILSKLSLE-amide, was synthesized by solid phase peptide synthesis using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy and purified by reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The structure of the peptide was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. NMR Studies—NMR studies of the interactions between the ANXA2-N13 peptide and S100A4 protein were performed using 15N-enriched protein that was produced in Escherichia coli using M9 medium containing 15N ammonium sulfate as a sole nitrogen source. The protein product was purified as described above for the non-labeled S100A4. 1H-15N HSQC NMR spectra (32Palmer A.G.R. Cavanagh J. Wright P.E. Rance M. J. Magn. Reson. 1991; 93: 151-170Google Scholar) were acquired at 303K using a Bruker Avance 500 spectrometer. The sample containing 0.3 mm S100A4 in 20 mm Bis-Tris, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm CaCl2 and 10 mm dithiothreitol was measured before and after the addition of the peptide to the final concentration of 0.6 mm. The data processing and analysis were performed using the Bruker XWINNMR software. Plasminogen Activation Assay—The kinetics of t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation was determined by measuring the amidolytic activity of plasmin formed during the activation of plasminogen as previously described (28Kassam G.

Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with some modifications. All of the experiments were done in a 100-μl volume in 96-well plates in triplicates. Gluplasminogen (Calbiochem) at the concentration of 100 or 50 nm was preincubated at 25 °C for 1 h in the presence or absence of 1 μm recombinant S100A4, S100A10, or annexin II in a buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm CaCl2 or 5 mm EGTA. In some experiments, 10 mm 6-ACA was preincubated together with proteins. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 1.6 or 5 nm t-PA (Calbiochem) and 125 μm chromogenic plasmin substrate, Chromozym PL (Roche Applied Science). The reactions were monitored at 405 nm for 1.5 h in a SPECTRAmax PLUS384 microplate spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices) under the control of the SOFTmax PRO kinetic program (Molecular Devices). The initial rates of plasmin generation during the first 10–15 min were calculated using linear regression analysis of plots of A405 nm versus time2 as described before (28Kassam G. Le B.H. Choi K.S. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Louie P. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 16958-16966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 33Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The initial rates of plasmin generation were reported in units (K) of A405 nm/min2 × 103. In the absence of t-PA, plasmin generation did not take place regardless of the presence of S100A4, S100A10, or annexin II (data not shown). The titration data were analyzed with the four-parameter logistic equation, K = (A - D)/(1 + (x/C)B)D.If A (asymptotic minimum) = 0, this equation is converted to the Michaelis-Menten equation, K = D/(1 + (C/[S])B), where [S] is substrate concentration, D = Vmax, C = Km, and B is the Hill coefficient. Plasminogen Activation on the Surface of Endothelial Cells— HCEC (105 cells/well) were seeded in 24-well plates and allowed to grow until confluent. The cells were washed twice in DMEM and then exposed to S100A4 (25–200 nm), S100A4 (100 nm) preincubated with ANXA2-N13 peptide (10 μm) for 1 h, placental growth factor (20–100 nm; R&D Systems), insulin-like growth factor I (75–200 nm; R&D Systems), or basic fibroblast growth factor (1–200 nm; R&D Systems) for 15 min at 37 °C. The control cells were incubated in DMEM. Each well was then supplemented with t-PA (10 nm) and incubated for 1 h. The cells were washed twice with phenol red-free DMEM and plasminogen (100 nm), and 25 μm plasmin fluorogenic substrate (d-Ala-Leu-Lys-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin, Sigma) were added. Plasmin formation was monitored at 360-nm excitation/460-nm emission setting in a cytofluorimeter plate reader (Bio-Tek FL600) at 5-min intervals for 6 h at 37 °C. The basal fluorescence obtained at 0 min was subtracted from each time point. S100A4 Induces Capillary-like Tube Formation in Primary Human Cerebromicrovascular Endothelial Cells—Angiogenic properties of S100A4 were demonstrated in vitro using HCEC grown in a mixture of basement membrane components, Matrigel. HCEC used in this study have been previously shown to form capillary-like tube networks when stimulated with a variety of angiogenic factors (30Autiero M. Waltenberger J. Communi D. Kranz A. Moons L. Lambrechts D. Kroll J. Plaisance S. De Mol M. Bono F. Kliche S. Fellbrich G. Ballmer-Hofer K. Maglione D. Mayr-Beyrle U. Dewerchin M. Dombrowski S. Stanimirovic D. Van Hummelen P. Dehio C.

HCEC incubated in DMEM exhibited a typical spindle-shaped morphology (Fig. 1a). HCEC exposed to S100A4 formed an intricate capillary-like tube network (Fig. 1b). This effect was concentration-dependent with a minimal effective S100A4 concentration of 10 nm (data not shown). The S100A4-induced capillary-like tube formation was prevented by incubating HCEC with 6-ACA prior to the addition of S100A4 (Fig. 1b). The anti-angiogenic effect of 6-ACA has been previously described (34Hatziapostolou M. Katsoris P. Papadimitriou E. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 2003; 460: 1-8Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) to be related to its ability to suppress plasmin formation catalyzed by t-PA upon plasminogen and t-PA binding to annexin II or annexin II heterotetramer on the endothelial surface (33Cesarman G.M. Guevara C.A. Hajjar K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21198-21203Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 35Kassam G. Choi K.S. Ghuman J. Kang H.M. Fitzpatrick S.L. Zackson T. Zackson S. Toba M. Shinomiya A. Waisman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4790-4799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Because 6-ACA suppressed the angiogenic response of HCEC to S100A4, we have hypothesized that the membrane annexin II may be directly involved in S100A4-induced angiogenesis. S100A4 Induces Translocation of Annexin II and Co-localizes with It on the Surface of HCEC—Cellular localization of annexin II and the exogenously added S100A4 in HCEC was analyzed by double immunocytochemistry staining using monoclonal anti-annexin II and polyclonal anti-S100A4 antibodies. Among the primary endothelial cells cultures derived from various tissues, cerebromicrovascular cells showed the highest level of annexin II expression (36Kwaan H.C. Wang J. Weiss I. J Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 306-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In control HCEC, both endogenous annexin II (Fig. 2A) and S100A4 (Fig. 2B) exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution, which is consistent with previously published results (37Hsieh H.L. Schafer B.W. Cox J.A. Heizmann C.W. J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 3149-3158Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Liu J. Rothermund C.A. Ayala-Sanmartin J. Vishwanatha J.K. BMC Biochem. 2003; 4: 10Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) The merged image of endogenous S100A4 and annexin II staining (Fig. 2C) showed similar nuclear and cytoplasmic co-localization of both proteins. In HCEC exposed to the exogenously added S100A4 for 1 h, annexin II redistribution from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane (Fig. 2D) coincided with HCEC morphological conversion into “angiogenic” phenotype. Moreover, annexin II (Fig. 2E) and S100A4 (Fig. 2F) immunostaining co-localized on the HCEC plasma membrane (Fig. 2F), suggesting interaction of exogenous S100A4 with annexin II. Binding of Recombinant S100A4 to Annexin II and Identification of the Binding Region in the Annexin II Molecule—To further confirm that S100A4 binds with annexin II, we studied the interaction between these two proteins in vitro. Both annexin II and S100A4 were cloned in bacterial vectors as glutathione S-transferase fusions and purified as individual proteins by using glutathione-Sepharose and thrombin proteolysis for elution. The interaction of S100A4 and annexin II was evaluated by immune co-precipitation assay. The results of these experiments shown in Fig. 3 demonstrate that S100A4 and annexin II form a complex that can be precipitated with either anti-S100A4 or anti-annexin II antibodies and detected by Western blot with anti-annexin II (Fig. 3A) or anti-S100A4 (Fig. 3B) antibodies, respectively. Surprisingly, the strongest interaction of the two proteins was observed in the absence of Ca2+ (EGTA buffer), whereas the addition of Ca2+ reduced the complex formation (Fig. 3, A and B, lanes 3 and 4). The N-terminal region of the annexin II molecule is responsible for its interactions with binding partners, such as S100A10 and t-PA (39Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S.

Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). To examine whether the N-terminal region is involved in the annexin II binding to S100A4, we have produced two truncated forms of annexin II: 1) A2-del15, which was lacking the first 15 amino acids in the N terminus including t-PA and S100A10-binding sites, and 2) A2-del26 with an additional deletion of 11 amino acids including Tyr23 and Ser25 that are known to be phosphorylation sites for protein tyrosine kinase pp60srk (srk oncogene) and PKC, respectively (41Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar). The immune co-precipitation assay showed reduced binding of the A2-del15 mutant to S100A4 and no binding in the case of the A2-del26 mutant (Fig. 3C), indicating that the N-terminal part of annexin II contains the S100A4-binding site. On the other hand, S100A10 did not bind either mutant form of annexin II, which is consistent with the previous report that the S100A10-binding site is localized within the first 13 amino acids (39Rety S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, the results of this experiment indicate that S100A4 and S100A10 interact with the similar region of annexin II. However, it appears that the S100A4-binding region is localized distal to the S100A10-binding site and overlaps with the phosphorylation sites. It has been previously reported that the S100A4-binding sequences of several S100A4 targets, including p53 (16Grigorian M. Andresen S. Tulchinsky E. Kriajevska M. Carlberg C. Kruse C. Cohn M.

Fischer-Larsen M. Issinger O. Lukanidin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), contain sites for PKC or CKII phosphorylation. Because annexin II is one of the major targets for PKC phosphorylation (41Gerke V. Moss S.E. Physiol. Rev. 2002; 82: 331-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (1634) Google Scholar), S100A4 binding to its phosphorylation site might represent a regulatory pathway for annexin II functions. To compare the annexin II-binding potencies of S100A4 and S100A10, equimolar mixtures of S100A4 and S100A10 with annexin II were incubated and the complex formation was analyzed. Whereas S100A4 and S100A10 were each separately capable of forming complexes with annexin II (Fig. 3D, lanes 3 and 4), only S100A4/annexin II complex was detected when the mixture of S100A4 and S10"

These conditions are associated with the elaboration of a variety of cytokines and increases in p38 activity in endothelial cells. However, the relationship between enhanced p38 activity and endothelial cell function remains poorly understood. To investigate the effect of enhanced p38 MAPK activity on endothelial cell function, we expressed an activated mutant of MEK6 (MEK6E), an upstream regulator of p38. Expression of MEK6E activated p38 and resulted in phosphorylation of its downstream substrate, heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27). Activation of p38 was not sufficient to induce apoptosis; however, it did induce p38-dependent cell cycle arrest. MEK6E expression was sufficient to inhibit ERK phosphorylation triggered by growth factors and integrin engagement. MAPK phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) expression was increased upon p38 activation, and expression of a “substrate-trapping” MKP-1 was sufficient to restore ERK activity. Activation of p38 was sufficient to induce cell migration, which was accompanied by alterations in actin architecture characterized by enhanced lamellipodia. Co-expression of a mutant form of Hsp27, lacking all three phosphorylation sites, reversed MEK6E-induced cell migration and altered the cytoskeletal changes induced by p38 activation. Collectively, these results suggest that cellular decisions regarding migration and proliferation are influenced by p38 activity and that prolonged activation of p38 may result in an anti-angiogenic phenotype that contributes to endothelial dysfunction.

Under normal conditions, vascular injury triggers the proliferation and migration of normally quiescent endothelial cells, leading to repair of the injured vessel. However, several pathological conditions such as hypertension and hyperglycemia are accompanied by a dysfunctional endothelium characterized by impaired re-endothelialization.

Sato Y. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 188: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Functionally, these kinases are also thought of as distinct. ERK is involved in cell proliferation and survival responses in a variety of cell types, including endothelial cells (8Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 10Meadows K.N. Bryant P. Pumiglia K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49289-49298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Activation of p38 is implicated in inflammation, cell growth control, cell differentiation, cell migration, and apoptosis (6Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). The p38 MAPK family consists of four different isoforms including α, β, δ, and γ. The α and β isoforms are ubiquitously expressed, whereas γ expression is found predominantly in skeletal muscle, and δ expression is enriched in the lung, kidney, testis, pancreas, and small intestine (6Ono K. Han J. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (1402) Google Scholar). A growing body of evidence indicates that these isoforms can be activated differentially and may control different downstream cellular processes, depending on cell type (11Uddin S. Ah-Kang J.

The role of p38 in regulating endothelial cell function is currently not clear, and which isoforms are present in endothelial cells has not been defined. P38 can be activated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and fibroblast growth factor (FGF), two well known angiogenic factors, and p38 activation has been shown to be critical for endothelial cell migration in response to VEGF (15McMullen M. Keller R. Sussman M. Pumiglia K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 16Rousseau S. Houle F. Landry J. Huot J. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 2169-2177Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). Studies utilizing pharmacological inhibitors of p38 have suggested that p38 activation may promote endothelial cell apoptosis (17Matsumoto T. Turesson I. Book M. Gerwins P. Claesson-Welsh L. J.

Suttorp N. Clauss M. FASEB J. 2003; 17: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that p38 is not required for neovessel outgrowths (21Zhu W.H. MacIntyre A. Nicosia R.F. Am. J. Pathol. 2002; 161: 823-830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Mice lacking p38α demonstrate severe defects in placental development and vascularization (22Mudgett J.S. Ding J. Guh-Siesel L. Chartrain N.A. Yang L. Gopal S. Shen M.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 10454-10459Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar), suggesting a role in endothelial cell function. Collectively, these divergent pieces of data suggest that p38 activity is a tightly regulated component of the neovascularization response. In the present study, we have utilized a constitutively active form of MEK6 to investigate directly the effects of sustained p38 activity in vascular endothelial cells. Our results indicate that activation of p38 is sufficient to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation while promoting migration. Our data suggest a model whereby a shift in the balance of p38 and ERK signaling, mediated in part by induction of MKP-1, alters the ability of endothelial cells to respond normally to angiogenic factors. As a result, chronic activation of p38 may contribute directly to pathological endothelial cell dysfunction. Materials—VEGF was obtained from the NCI, National Institutes of Health developmental therapeutics program. Polyclonal anti-phosphop38, anti-pan-p38 antibodies, anti-p38α, anti-p38δ, anti-phospho-Hsp27, anti-Hsp27, anti-phospho-MEK1/2, and anti-MEK1/2 antibodies were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Monoclonal anti-phospho-ERK and polyclonal anti-ERK1, anti-ERK2, anti-FAK, anti-p38β, and anti-MKP-1 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies (Santa Cruz, CA).

Monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody was obtained from Sigma. Ro-31-8220, was purchased from Calbiochem. The cDNA for dominant negative p38α (DNp38α) was from Roger Davis (University of Massachusetts Medical School). Adenoviruses were all created using the Adeasy system, essentially as described previously (10Meadows K.N. Bryant P. Pumiglia K. J. Biol.

The mutant form of Hsp27 (mutHsp27) adenovirus was a generous gift of William Gerthoffer (University of Nevada School of Medicine). The MKP-1 C/S adenovirus was a generous gift of Andrey Sorokin (Medical College of Wisconsin). Cell Culture—Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) from pooled donors were supplied by VEC Technologies (Troy, NY) through the NCI, National Institutes of Health angiogenesis resource center and cultured as we have described previously (10Meadows K.N. Bryant P. Pumiglia K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49289-49298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). For experiments requiring serum deprivation, MCDB-131 supplemented with 1% penicillin/streptomycin and 2 mm l-glutamine was used as indicated. Western Blotting—When appropriate, HUVECs were infected with an adenovirus overnight as indicated at an multiplicity of infection of 5–10. For experiments requiring growth factor stimulation, nearly confluent cells were serum-starved for 16 h prior to stimulation with 50 ng/ml VEGF or 100 ng/ml FGF for the indicated time points. Experiments conducted with subconfluent cells gave identical results. For experiments requiring integrin-induced activation, cells were trypsinized and placed into suspension for 30 min prior to replating at 50% confluency. Subsequently, whole cell lysates were collected in Laemmli sample buffer. Blotting was performed according to procedures we have described previously (10Meadows K.N. Bryant P. Pumiglia K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49289-49298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). All figures are representative of at least three independent experiments. Apoptosis Assay—Caspase 3/7 activities were measured by an Apo-ONE™ homogeneous caspase 3/7 assay (Promega). A 96-well plate coated with 0.2% gelatin was seeded with 2 × 104 cells/well. The following day, experimental manipulations were initiated. After 48 h, an equal volume of lysis buffer containing the caspase substrate benzyloxycarbonyl-DEVD-R100 was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. The cell lysates at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 535 nm using a PerkinElmer Life Sciences HTS 7000 plus BioAssay Reader. Cell Proliferation and Cell Migration—These experiments were conducted essentially as described previously by us (10Meadows K.N. Bryant P. Pumiglia K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49289-49298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar, 15McMullen M. Keller R. Sussman M. Pumiglia K.

Labeling of Actin Cytoskeleton—HUVECs seeded onto coverslips were infected with GFP or the MEK6E adenovirus and serum-starved overnight. Subsequently, the cells were treated with VEGF (50 ng/ml) for 15 min to observe the changes in actin cytoskeleton in adherent cells. To examine changes in cells actively remodeling the actin cytoskeleton, cells infected with GFP or the MEK6E adenovirus were trypsinized, and 2.5 × 104 cells were plated onto gelatin-coated coverslips. After 4 h, cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, and actin was visualized using Texas Red phalloidin (Molecular Probes) (10Meadows K.N. Bryant P. Pumiglia K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49289-49298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Statistical Analysis—All quantitative data were pooled from multiple independent experiments. One- or two-way analysis of variance was conducted as appropriate using Statistica software (Tulsa, OK). A Newman-Keuls post hoc test was performed to determine statistically significant differences (p < 0.05). As several studies have shown chronically elevated p38 activity in disease states known to have impaired angiogenesis and endothelial dysfunction, we utilized a FLAG-tagged, constitutively active MEK6 adenovirus, MEK6E, to directly study the effects of chronic p38 activity on endothelial cells. This reagent has been described previously (25Hoover H.E. Thuerauf D.J. Martindale J.J. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 23825-23833Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). MEK6E was expressed at ∼10-fold higher amounts than the endogenous MEK6 levels (data not shown). HUVECs showed expression of the FLAG-tagged protein and induction of p38 phosphorylation at levels similar to those induced acutely by VEGF (Fig. 1A). Although each activates p38 to similar levels, the activation of p38 by VEGF is transient, whereas the MEK6E-induced p38 activation is sustained. P38 activation by MEK6E was sufficient to induce the sustained phosphorylation of a known substrate of p38, Hsp27 (Fig. 1, B and C), as well as the transcription factor ATF-2 (Fig. 1C). MEK6 can activate all of the p38 isoforms; therefore, we tested to determine which isoforms of p38 might be present and/or activated in endothelial cells. Using commercially available isoform-specific anti-sera, we detected weak activity against p38α (data not shown). No reactivity against other isoforms was detected with the available antibodies. Because dominant negative p38 isoforms have been used to define the role of specific isoforms (14Harnois C. Demers M.J. Bouchard V. Vallee K. Gagne D. Fujita N. Tsuruo T. Vezina A. Beaulieu J.F. Cote A. Vachon P.H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2004; 198: 209-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 26Guo Y.L. Kang B. Han J. Williamson J.R. J. Cell. Biochem. 2001; 82: 556-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), we also employed an adenovirus coding for DNp38α (15McMullen M. Keller R. Sussman M. Pumiglia K. Oncogene. 2004; 23: 1275-1282Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1C, co-expression of DNp38α resulted in the inhibition of both the Hsp27 phosphorylation and ATF-2 phosphorylation induced by MEK6E, suggesting that p38α is the predominant isoform activated by MEK6E. Activation of p38 by stress signals has been shown to induce apoptosis in some systems (27Xia Z. Dickens M. Raingeaud J. Davis R.J. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1995; 270: 1326-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (5045) Google Scholar), and inhibitor studies have indirectly implicated p38 in the regulation of apoptosis in endothelial cells (17Matsumoto T. Turesson I. Book M. Gerwins P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Cell Biol. 2002; 156: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Gratton J.P. Morales-Ruiz M. Kureishi Y. Fulton D. Walsh K. Sessa W.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 30359-30365Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). In contrast, other studies have indicated pro-survival effects of p38 activation (28Horowitz J.C. Lee D.Y. Waghray M. Keshamouni V.G. Thomas P.E. Zhang H. Cui Z. Thannickal V.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 1359-1367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 29Zhang X. Shan P. Alam J. Davis R.J. Flavell R.A. Lee P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22061-22070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Therefore, we tested whether chronic activation of p38 modulated apoptosis by measuring caspase 3/7 activities. Whereas serum starvation in M199 media for 48 h induced apoptosis, no increase in caspase 3/7 activity was observed in MEK6E-infected cells. (Fig. 1D). However, enhanced p38 activity did enhance stress-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1D). It should be noted that serum starvation in MCDB-131 as a basal medium did not induce apoptosis (data not shown). Therefore, MCDB-131 was used for serum starvation protocols in all other experiments. A requirement for re-endothelialization following injury, as well as for angiogenesis, is enhanced cell proliferation (30Carmeliet P. Jain R.K. Nature. 2000; 407: 249-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (7531) Google Scholar, 31Folkman J. Nat. Med. 1995; 1: 27-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (7235) Google Scholar). We investigated the effect of activating p38 on growth factor-induced DNA synthesis of endothelial cells. Analysis of [3H]thymidine incorporation revealed that the increase in the number of cells entering S phase upon VEGF treatment was completely inhibited following expression of MEK6E (Fig. 2A). Similarly, MEK6E was sufficient to inhibit FGF-induced cell cycle progression (Fig. 2B), demonstrating that this effect was not specific to VEGF responses. Expression of DNp38α was sufficient to rescue the inhibition of cell proliferation induced by MEK6E (Fig. 2B). We also measured bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, a method for measuring DNA synthesis independent of changes in total cell number (survival), and found similar results (Fig. 2C). These results clearly demonstrate that the activation of p38α by MEK6E inhibits S phase entry in response to several angiogenic factors. ERK activity is known to be essential for proliferation in many cell types (8Widmann C. Gibson S. Jarpe M.B. Johnson G.L. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 143-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (2292) Google Scholar, 32Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 33Seger R. Krebs E.G. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 726-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (3218) Google Scholar), including endothelial cells (10Meadows K.N. Bryant P. Pumiglia K. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49289-49298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether activation of p38 by MEK6E affected growth factor-mediated induction of ERK activity. Time course experiments of VEGF-mediated activation of ERK in control GFP-infected cells revealed peak activity at 5–10 min that remained elevated for ∼4 h (Fig. 3A). In contrast, ERK phosphorylation levels in MEK6E-infected cells were reduced significantly at all time points (Fig. 3B), although VEGF still elevated levels above basal. Similar results were observed in FGF-stimulated cells (data not shown). These data indicate that activation of p38 reduces the basal level of ERK activity and the total level of ERK activity following growth factor stimulation. ERK can also be activated by integrin engagement (34Wary K.K. Mainiero F. Isakoff S.J. Marcantonio E.E. Giancotti F.G. Cell. 1996; 87: 733-743Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (655) Google Scholar), and the integrin-mediated activation of ERK is critical for cell cycle progression (32Schwartz M.A. Assoian R.K. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 2553-2560Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We postulated that the reduced level of ERK activity might be due to inhibition of an integrin-stimulated component and investigated the effect of MEK6E on integrin-induced ERK activity. Infected cells were placed in suspension and then seeded onto fibronectin-coated dishes for the indicated times (Fig. 4A) to synchronize the integrin-mediated activation of ERK. The cells expressing GFP showed a rapid induction of ERK phosphorylation within 15 min of replating. In contrast, expression of MEK6E substantially inhibited the integrin-induced ERK activity (Fig. 4A). Similar results were observed when experiments were performed with collagen and vitronectin (Fig. 4B). This finding argues that the inhibition of ERK is likely the result of inhibition of a shared adhesion-dependent activation mechanism rather than down-regulation of a specific integrin subunit or changes in matrix-integrin affinity. Integrin signaling to FAK has been reported as being an essential component of integrin-mediated ERK activation (35Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. van der Geer P. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar) and would represent a common or shared signaling protein through which p38 activation might be exerting its effects. Therefore we measured the phosphorylation of the FAK autophosphorylation site, Tyr-397, as an indicator of FAK activation. When endothelial cells were replated onto fibronectin, FAK was phosphorylated at Tyr-397, and MEK6E had no affect on this response (Fig. 4C). Taken collectively, these data indicate that MEK6E inhibits attachment-induced ERK activation. This inhibition is independent of the extracellular matrix ligand and occurs subsequent to FAK activation. To gain more insight into where the down-regulation of ERK might be occurring, we examined the effect of MEK6E expression on MEK1/2 phosphorylation levels. Time course experiments of VEGF-induced MEK1/2 activity revealed peak activation at 10 min, similar to the profile of ERK activity. Surprisingly, MEK6E-infected cells had high levels of MEK1/2 phosphorylation prior to VEGF stimulation that remained elevated at all time points (Fig. 5A). Similar results were observed in FGF-stimulated cells (Fig. 5B) and in cells replated onto fibronectin (data not shown). The control experiments confirmed that MEK6E was running at a different molecular weight than the phospho-MEK1/2 and that no antibody cross-reactivity was occurring (data not shown). These data indicate that the cross-talk between p38 and ERK is occurring at the level of ERK in our system. Furthermore, these data suggest ERK activation may normally provide negative feedback that results in the down-regulation of MEK1/2 phosphorylation. Induction of phosphatase expression can regulate MAPK cross-talk in other cell types (36Westermarck J. Li S.P. Kallunki T. Han J. Kahari V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 2373-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). The dual specificity phosphatase MKP-3 has been shown previously to be an important and relatively selective MAPK phosphatase for ERK (7Camps M. Nichols A. Arkinstall S. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 6-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar). To determine whether this phosphatase was up-regulated by MEK6E expression, we measured levels of MKP-3 and observed no change in its expression levels (data not shown). Another dual specificity MAPK phosphatase, MKP-1, has also been shown to dephosphorylate ERK (37Pervin S. Singh R. Freije W.A. Chaudhuri G. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 8853-8860PubMed Google Scholar, 38Sandberg E.M. Ma X. VonDerLinden D. Godeny M.D. Sayeski P.P. J. Biol.

Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar), and p38 has been linked to the induction of MKP-1 expression (40Li J. Gorospe M. Hutter D. Barnes J. Keyse S.M. Liu Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 8213-8224Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the potential role of MKP-1 in the p38-dependent down-regulation of ERK activity. Expression of MEK6E induced MKP-1 expression (Fig. 6A), whereas pretreatment with the p38 inhibitor, SB203580, inhibited the MEK6E-induced MKP-1 expression (Fig. 6A). These data suggest that MKP-1 could play a role in the MEK6E-induced down-regulation of ERK activity. The compound Ro-31-8220 has been shown previously to inhibit MKP-1 expression by an indeterminate mechanism (41Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). We utilized this compound to determine whether the inhibition of MKP-1 could modulate ERK phosphorylation. Pretreatment with Ro-31-8220 inhibited MEK6E-induced MKP-1 expression (Fig. 6B) and produced an increase in the basal ERK activity in MEK6E-expressing cells; however, it was not sufficient to completely restore integrin-induced ERK activity (Fig. 6C). These data suggest that MKP-1 is playing a role in the modulation of ERK activity. However, studies have indicated that Ro-31-8220 can also modulate the activity of other signaling molecules (41Beltman J. McCormick F. Cook S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27018-27024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Therefore, we sought to confirm these results with a more specific strategy of expressing a catalytically inactive, “substrate-trapping” mutant of MKP-1 (MKP-1 C/S) (42Pratt P.F. Bokemeyer D. Foschi M. Sorokin A. Dunn M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 51928-51936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Infecting endothelial cells with an adenovirus coding for this mutant produced an increase in immunoreactive MKP-1, documenting expression of the mutant protein (Fig. 6D). MKP-1 C/S was co-infected with MEK6E prior to replating onto fibronectin. Results show that MKP-1 C/S was also able to elevate basal levels and attenuate the inhibition of integrin-induced ERK activity (Fig. 6E). Because MKP-1 can also inhibit p38 activation, we examined the effect of expressing MKP-1 on the level of p38 phosphorylation induced by VEGF. Predic"

Oxidative stress is suggested to occur in retinal tissue during age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy and is suspected in the mechanism of VEGF expression in these diseases. Arsenite, a thiol-reactive oxidative stressor, induces VEGF expression by a HIF-1α-independent mechanism. Previously, we demonstrated that homocysteine, an endoplasmic reticulum stressor, increases VEGF transcription by a mechanism dependent upon activating transcription factor ATF4. Because ATF4 is expressed in response to oxidative stress, we hypothesized that ATF4 was also responsible for increased VEGF transcription in response to arsenite. We now show that arsenite increased steady state levels of VEGF mRNA and activated transcription from a VEGF promoter construct. Arsenite induced eIF2α phosphorylation, resulting in increased ATF4 protein levels. Inactivation or loss of ATF4 greatly diminished the VEGF response to arsenite treatment. Overexpression of ATF4 was sufficient to activate the VEGF promoter, and arsenite cooperated with exogenous ATF4 to further activate the promoter. A complex containing ATF4 binds a DNA element at +1767 bp relative to the VEGF transcription start site, and DNA binding activity is increased by arsenite treatment. In addition, the ability of a thiol antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine, to inhibit the effect of arsenite on VEGF expression coincided with its ability to inhibit phosphorylation of eIF2α and ATF4 protein expression.

Oxidative stress is involved in the pathogenesis of two leading causes of vision loss, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 1The abbreviations used are: AMD, age-related macular degeneration; DR, diabetic retinopathy; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ATF, activating transcription factor; HO, heme oxygenase; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; Wt, wild type; DN, dominant negative; AARE, amino acid response element; AsnSyn, asparagine synthetase. 1The abbreviations used are: AMD, age-related macular degeneration; DR, diabetic retinopathy; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; ATF, activating transcription factor; HO, heme oxygenase; NAC, N-acetylcysteine; MEF, mouse embryo fibroblast; Wt, wild type; DN, dominant negative; AARE, amino acid response element; AsnSyn, asparagine synthetase. and diabetic retinopathy (DR). This association is indicated by the beneficial effects of antioxidant supplementation in AMD patients (1Age-Related Eye Disease Study Research Group Arch. Ophthalmol. 2001; 119: 1417-1436Crossref PubMed Scopus (2594) Google Scholar) and in streptozotocin diabetic rats (2Obrosova I.G. Minchenko A.G. Marinescu V. Fathallah L. Kennedy A. Stockert C.M. Frank R.N. Stevens M.J. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the breakdown of retinal antioxidant defenses has been demonstrated in aged and diabetic retinas (3Li W. Yanoff M. Jian B. He Z. Cell Mol. Biol. 1999; 45: 59-66PubMed Google Scholar, 4Liles M.R. Newsome D.A. Oliver P.D. Arch. Ophthalmol. 1991; 109: 1285-1288Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). However, the mechanism by which oxidative stress may contribute to the development of AMD and DR is still unknown. Intraocular neovascularization is associated with both AMD and DR and is often a causative factor in the loss of vision during these pathologies. The neovascularization of the retina is frequently associated with increased expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a positive regulator of angiogenesis (for review, see Ref. 5Ferrara N. Endocr. Rev. 2004; 25: 581-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (2965) Google Scholar). Retinal pigment epithelial cells are a major source of VEGF in diseased retinas (6Lopez P.F. Sippy B.D. Lambert H.M. Thach A.B. Hinton D.R. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1996; 37: 855-868PubMed Google Scholar, 7Matsuoka M. Ogata N. Otsuji T. Nishimura T. Takahashi K. Matsumura M. Br. J. Ophthalmol. 2004; 88: 809-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, the signaling mechanisms resulting in aberrant VEGF expression in aged and diabetic retinas are yet to be determined. Oxidative stressors, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide, are positive regulators of VEGF in the retinal pigment epithelial cells (8Kuroki M. Voest E.E. Amano S. Beerepoot L.V. Takashima S. Tolentino M. Kim R.Y. Rohan R.M. Colby K.A. Yeo K.T. Adamis A.P. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1667-1675Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Antioxidant supplementation lowered VEGF protein levels in the retinas of diabetic rats (2Obrosova I.G. Minchenko A.G. Marinescu V. Fathallah L. Kennedy A. Stockert C.M. Frank R.N. Stevens M.J. Diabetologia. 2001; 44: 1102-1110Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Arsenite, an oxidative stressor, was shown previously to up-regulate VEGF mRNA and hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) protein (9Duyndam M.C. Hulscher T.M. Fontijn D. Pinedo H.M. Boven E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48066-48076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). This led to the suggestion that HIF-1 was responsible for VEGF induction by arsenite. However, further investigation demonstrated that arsenite failed to induce a functional HIF-1 complex and that the VEGF induction was HIF-1-independent (10Duyndam M.C. Hulscher S.T. van der Wall E. Pinedo H.M. Boven E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6885-6895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Therefore, an alternative pathway must regulate the induction of VEGF by arsenite. Previously, we reported that homocysteine, a known ER stressor (11Ji C. Kaplowitz N. World J. Gastroenterol. 2004; 10: 1699-1708Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), which is elevated in DR (12Goldstein M. Leibovitch I. Yeffimov I. Gavendo S. Sela B.A. Loewenstein A. Eye. 2004; 18: 460-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), up-regulated VEGF expression through an endoplasmic reticulum stress response pathway that was dependent on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4) (13Roybal C.N. Yang S. Sun C.W. Hurtado D. Vander Jagt D.L. Townes T.M. Abcouwer S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). ATF4 protein levels increase in response to cellular stresses that cause global protein synthesis to be diminished. The ATF4 mRNA contains small upstream open reading frames that allow the ORF encoding ATF4 to be selectively translated when the translation initiation factor eIF2α is phosphorylated and levels of ternary initiation complex are low (14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 15Vattem K.M. Wek R.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 11269-11274Crossref PubMed Scopus (1122) Google Scholar). Activation of kinases that phosphorylate eIF2α leads to inhibition of global translation under conditions that perturb nascent protein processing, such as ER stress, nutrient deprivation, or exposure to oxidants and reactive metals (14Harding H.P. Novoa I. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Wek R. Schapira M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 1099-1108Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2404) Google Scholar, 16Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). ATF4 is a key mediator in the adaptive response of cells to oxidants. Import of the amino acids glycine and cysteine, precursors for glutathione biosynthesis, is impaired in ATF4-null cells (17Harding H.P. Zhang Y. Zeng H. Novoa I. Lu P.D. Calfon M. Sadri N. Yun C. Popko B. Paules R. Stojdl D.F. Bell J.C. Hettmann T. Leiden J.M. Ron D. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 619-633Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2363) Google Scholar). Other ATF4-inducible genes are mediators of the cytoprotective program activated by oxidative stressors, an example being heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) (18He C.H. Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Our previous findings implicating ATF4 in VEGF expression along with the current understanding of ATF4 as a regulator of redox homeostasis led us to question the role of ATF4 in the arsenite-mediated up-regulation of VEGF. We now demonstrate that arsenite induces eIF2α phosphorylation and that ATF4 protein up-regulation precedes VEGF mRNA up-regulation. ATF4 is necessary for VEGF mRNA up-regulation and for transcriptional activation of the VEGF promoter in response to arsenite. N-Acetylcysteine (NAC), which blocks the effect of arsenite on VEGF expression, also inhibited eIF2α phosphorylation and ATF4 protein expression. These results suggest a model wherein oxidative stress induces VEGF in an ATF4-dependent mechanism thereby contributing to the neovascularization seen in retinal pathologies such as AMD and DR. Cell Culture—ARPE-19 cells (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (low glucose formulation) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml amphotericin B. Immortalized mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) were obtained from homozygous and heterozygous ATF4 knock-out MEF cultures (19Masuoka H.C. Townes T.M. Blood. 2002; 99: 736-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose formulation) supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 4 mm glutamine, and 50 μm thioglycerol. For Northern blotting experiments, cells were plated in 60-cm2 tissue culture dishes and grown to confluence. One day prior to being treated, ARPE-19 cells were fed with fresh media. MEF cultures were fed with fresh media containing 5 μm thioglycerol 1 day prior to treatment. Sodium arsenite (NaAsO2), N-acetylcysteine (NAC), ascorbic acid, trolox, and catalase (Sigma) were prepared fresh in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and sterilized by filtration before being added to the cell cultures. For experiments utilizing adenoviral vectors, subconfluent cultures of ARPE-19 cells were treated with either ATF4 wild type (ATF4 Wt), ATF4 dominant negative mutant (ATF4 DN), or the empty AdEasy vector (Empty) (13Roybal C.N. Yang S. Sun C.W. Hurtado D. Vander Jagt D.L. Townes T.M. Abcouwer S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The ATF4 DN mutant protein contains a 6-amino acid substitution in the DNA-binding domain (292RYRQKKR298 to 292GYLEAAA298) (18He C.H. Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). Twenty h post-infection, the percentage of cells infected was determined by examining the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein by fluorescent microscopy. Northern Blot Analysis—RNA isolation and Northern blotting was performed as described previously (20Abcouwer S.F. Schwarz C. Meguid R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28645-28651Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) using cDNAs corresponding to human VEGF (GenBank™ accession number dbEST189750), GRP78 (HAEAC89, ATCC), and heme oxygenase-1 (21Keyse S.M. Tyrrell R.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1108) Google Scholar) and normalized to 18 S rRNA. Rat heme oxygenase-A (GenBank™ accession number AA874884) was used for Northern analysis of MEF RNA. 18 S rRNA template was generated using mouse RNA as described previously (13Roybal C.N. Yang S. Sun C.W. Hurtado D. Vander Jagt D.L. Townes T.M. Abcouwer S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Membranes were hybridized with radiolabeled DNA probe for 6–8 h at 60 °C in a solution containing 7% (v/v) SDS, 0.25 m Na2HPO4, pH 7.2, as described (22Kevil C.G. Walsh L. Laroux F.S. Kalogeris T. Grisham M.B. Alexander J.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 277-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Blotting results were quantified by overnight exposure to a phosphor screen followed by analysis using a STORM™ PhosphorImager and ImageQuant™ software (Amersham Biosciences). For each sample, hybridization to 18 S rRNA was used to normalize results for mRNAs. Fold inductions were determined by dividing normalized mRNA band intensity volumes for experimental samples to that of control (untreated or time 0) samples. VEGF Promoter Cloning—Initially, a HindIII restriction enzyme digest was performed on the human 137-kb PAC clone containing the VEGF-A gene (GenBank™ accession number AL136131). Following double gel purification (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) an 11.7-kb HindIII fragment was blunt-ended with the PCRTerminator™ end repair kit (Lucigen, Middleton, WI). The fragment was ligated into the pSMART-LC-Kan vector using the CLONESMART™ blunt end cloning kit (Lucigen, Middleton, WI). The resulting pSMART-LC-Kan-VEGF plasmid was digested with XhoI and the blunt end cutter EcoRV, excising an 8.2-kb fragment ranging from –6363 to +1886 kb relative to the VEGF transcription start site. The 8.2-kb fragment was then ligated into the XhoI- and SmaI-digested PGL-3-basic reporter vector (Promega, Madison, WI) creating the reporter vector pVEGF8.2-Luc. Sequencing performed by the University of New Mexico DNA Core Facility confirmed insert identity and orientation. Dual Luciferase Assays—ARPE-19 cells were plated at 50% confluence in 12-well plates and allowed to adhere overnight. Cells in each well were transfected with a CaCl2-DNA precipitate containing: 2.5 μg of pVEGF8.2-Luc, 20 ng of pRL-CMV vector (Promega) and incubated for 4 h. Cells were then treated with 1 ml of glycerol shock solution (4× Tris-buffered saline, 15% glycerol, and 600 μm Na2HPO4) for 90 s and washed twice with TBST (142 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 25 mm Tris, 1% Tween 20). Cells were allowed to recover for 20 h post-transfection, fed with fresh media, and treated with arsenite for the indicated times and doses. For reporter experiments with exogenous ATF4 expression, cells were infected with either Empty, ATF4 Wt, or ATF4 DN adenovirus by adding viral vectors at the time of plating. Infected cultures were then transfected with the plasmids the following day as described above. Cell lysates were obtained with passive lysis buffer (Promega) and analyzed with the Dual-luciferase® assay (Promega) using a TD-20/20 luminometer (Turner Designs, Sunnyvale, CA). The firefly luciferase relative light units in each sample were normalized to the Renilla luciferase relative light units, and the sample mean ratio was divided by the control mean ratio to give fold inductions. Statistical significance of differences between triplicate samples was determined with the two-sample t test. Western Blot Analysis—ARPE-19 or MEF cells were grown to confluence in 60 cm2 plates and treated as described in the figure legends. Following treatment, cells were washed in cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed for 20 min on ice in lysis buffer (0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). For samples to be analyzed with phospho-specific antibodies, phosphatase inhibitor mixture (50 mm NaF, 200 μm Na3VO4, 10 mm Na3PO4, and 100 μm EDTA) was included in the lysis buffer. Protein contents of cleared lysates were determined with a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce), and equal amounts of proteins (20 or 40 μg) were loaded into each lane and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein bands were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad) and probed with antibodies specific for ATF4 and eIF2α (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), phosphorylated eIF2α (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA), or β-actin (Sigma). Proteins were detected with ECL™ Chemiluminescence Kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to manufacture's instructions. Membranes were scanned and viewed with a MultiGenius Bioimaging System® (Syngene, Cambridge, UK). MEF Immortalization—ATF4 heterozygous and homozygous null MEFs were obtained from Tim Townes (Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics, University of Alabama at Birmingham). Cultures of 90% confluent ATF4+/– or ATF4–/– MEFs were transfected with a plasmid containing isolated SV40 early gene encoding the large T antigen alone (pD305 vector) (23Chang L.S. Pater M.M. Hutchinson N.I. di Mayorca G. Virology. 1984; 133: 341-353Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) by CaCl2 co-precipitation as described above. Forty-eight h later, transfected cells were subcultured (1:10 dilution) and maintained until fully confluent (1 week). Cells were then serially diluted in 60-cm2 plates and selected for clonal growth. Approximately 2 weeks after plating, cell colonies were either isolated with cloning cylinders or harvested together with all colonies on a plate to form pooled populations. Clonal and pooled populations were expanded, and expression of large T antigen was confirmed by Western blot analysis (data not shown). Pooled populations designated as ATF4–/–/D305/1:10 (ATF4–/–) and ATF4+/–/D305/1:10 (ATF4+/–) were utilized for the present study. The presence of ATF4 protein was confirmed in the ATF4+/– population and its absence proven in ATF4–/– population by Western blotting (Fig. 4B). DNA Binding Activity Analysis—Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed using Gel Shift Assay System (Promega) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The double-stranded DNA oligonucleotides containing putative ATF4-binding sites (underlined) known as amino acid response elements (AAREs) were as follows: CHOP1 AARE, 5′-TAGAGACAGGGTTTCACCATGTTGGCCAGG-3′; CHOP2 AARE in negative orientation, 5′-CCTGGGCAACATGGTGAAACACCATCTCTA-3′; DRAL AARE in negative orientation, 5′-TAGTGCACGAATGATGGAAAGGGAGGGTTG-3′; and asparagine synthetase (AsnSyn) AARE, 5′-GCGCGGAGCCGATTACATCAGCCCGGGCCT-3′ (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA). In the binding reactions, α-32P-labeled DNA probes were incubated with 10 μg of nuclear extract. Binding reactions were performed at room temperature for 20 min, and the DNA-protein complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 5% Tris borate-EDTA-PAGE gel and visualized using a STORM™ PhosphorImager and ImageQuant™ software (Amersham Biosciences). For ATF4 supershifts, 2 μg of polyclonal anti-ATF4 (CREB-2, H-290; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or monoclonal anti-myc (9B11; Cell Signaling Technology) were incubated with the binding mixture for 10 min before loading reactions on the gel. Dose Response and Time Course of VEGF, HO-1, and GRP78 mRNA Expression in ARPE-19 Cells Exposed to Arsenite—To characterize the induction of VEGF mRNA in response to arsenite, confluent ARPE-19 cells were treated with increasing doses of NaAsO2 (0, 5, 20, 100, and 300 μm) for 4 h. Total cellular RNA was isolated, and Northern blotting was performed to analyze VEGF mRNA content for each sample. (Fig. 1A). In addition, mRNA levels for HO-1 and GRP78 were examined. These genes served as indicators of oxidative and ER stress responses, respectively. In addition, ATF4 plays a role in regulation of both these genes (18He C.H. Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar, 24Luo S. Baumeister P. Yang S. Abcouwer S.F. Lee A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37375-37385Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). The ARPE-19 cells contained detectable amounts of a single mRNA species corresponding to VEGF. The VEGF mRNA levels were normalized relative to 18 S rRNA and plotted. VEGF steady state mRNA increased maximally (5.1-fold) with 100 μm arsenite. The decrease observed with 300 μm arsenite coincided with apparent toxicity at this dosage. Cell death was not observed at lower concentrations of arsenite. HO-1 mRNA levels were also increased by arsenite as previously described (25Sardana M.K. Drummond G.S. Sassa S. Kappas A. Pharmacology. 1981; 23: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). HO-1 expression was much more sensitive to arsenite stress than that of VEGF. A dramatic increase in HO-1 mRNA was caused by 5 μm arsenite, representing roughly a 20-fold increase in sensitivity as compared with VEGF. Expression of GRP78/BiP mRNA was not induced by arsenite, suggesting that the unfolded protein response was not activated. Using the dose associated with the maximal VEGF induction, 100 μm arsenite, ARPE-19 cells were treated for various times (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 h). This time course study revealed a maximal (4.2-fold) increase of VEGF mRNA at 4 h and a decline by 8 h. Although the sensitivity to arsenite was different for VEGF and HO-1; they exhibited similar kinetics of induction. Again, no induction of GRP78 mRNA was observed. Activation of the VEGF Promoter by Arsenite—Further analysis of the effect of arsenite on VEGF transcription was carried out with a reporter vector, pVEGF8.2-Luc, containing 8.2 kb of the VEGF promoter region. This particular gene fragment was chosen because computer analysis of this 5′ region of genomic DNA revealed it to contain four putative ATF4-binding sites, termed AARE (13Roybal C.N. Yang S. Sun C.W. Hurtado D. Vander Jagt D.L. Townes T.M. Abcouwer S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). ARPE-19 cells were transfected with pVEGF8.2-Luc and pRL-CMV, allowed to recover for 20 h, treated with arsenite for the times, and doses indicated and analyzed using a dual luciferase assay. Dose-response samples were obtained after 8 h of exposure to 0, 20, 60, 100, and 140 μm arsenite. A maximal induction of 3.7-fold was achieved with 100 μm arsenite (Fig. 2A). Time course experiments were performed with exposure to 100 μm sodium arsenite for 0, 4, 6, 8, and 12 h (Fig. 2B). Arsenite induced reporter expression maximally at 8 h with an increase of 3.7-fold. eIF2α Phosphorylation and ATF4 Protein Expression in ARPE-19 Cells Exposed to Arsenite—eIF2α phosphorylation and the subsequent up-regulation of ATF4 protein expression following arsenite treatment were expected if increased VEGF transcription was mediated by ATF4. Previous studies have reported phosphorylation of eIF2α (26Duncan R.F. Hershey J.W. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1987; 256: 651-661Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and subsequent increased in ATF4 DNA binding activity (16Fawcett T.W. Martindale J.L. Guyton K.Z. Hai T. Holbrook N.J. Biochem. J. 1999; 339: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) upon treatment with arsenite. Therefore, the effects of 100 μm arsenite on phosphorylation of eIF2α and ATF4 protein levels in ARPE-19 cells were analyzed. Phosphorylation of eIF2α following arsenite treatment was rapid and transient (Fig. 3A). The level of phosphorylated eIF2α protein was greatly increased within 15 min and returned to basal levels within 120 min. Total eIF2α levels did not vary appreciably between the samples. To examine the effects on ATF4 protein levels, ARPE-19 cells were treated with 100 μm arsenite for 0, 1, 2, and 4 h and analyzed by Western blotting with an antibody to ATF4. The antibody detected a prominent band of ∼47 kDa, corresponding to ATF4 protein, only in samples obtained at 2 h and 4 h of arsenite treatment (Fig. 3B). The faster migrating band detected by this antibody was determined to be due to nonspecific binding, as demonstrated previously (13Roybal C.N. Yang S. Sun C.W. Hurtado D. Vander Jagt D.L. Townes T.M. Abcouwer S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and by confirming the size of endogenous ATF4 through comparison to exogenously expressed ATF4 (data not shown). β-Actin was used as a loading control and did not vary markedly between samples. ATF4 protein induction coincided with VEGF mRNA induction (Fig. 1). Thus, ATF4 was available to activate VEGF transcription in a temporal manner that agrees with the time course results of VEGF mRNA induction and VEGF promoter activation. The Role of ATF4 in VEGF Expression following Arsenite Treatment—To further examine the role of ATF4 in arsenite-induced up-regulation of endogenous VEGF mRNA, an adenoviral vector system was used to express either ATF4 wild type (ATF4 Wt) or ATF4 dominant negative (ATF4 DN) proteins, as described previously (13Roybal C.N. Yang S. Sun C.W. Hurtado D. Vander Jagt D.L. Townes T.M. Abcouwer S.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14844-14852Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). An empty vector (Empty) was used to control for the effects of infection and enhanced green fluorescent protein expression. Viral titers were assessed by determining the percentage of cells that exhibited enhanced green fluorescent protein fluorescence 20 h post-infection with these vectors. Viral infection of ARPE-19 cells with ATF4 Wt virus stock at a 1:320 dilution, ATF4 DN virus stock at a 1:160 dilution, and Empty virus stock at a 1:320 dilution resulted in infection rates between 90 and 100% (data not shown). ARPE-19 cells were thus infected with viruses at these dilutions of virus stocks. Twenty h after contact with the viruses, the cultures were fed with fresh media and subjected to the following: no treatment (incubated with control media), incubated with media containing 100 μm sodium arsenite, or incubated with 10 mm dl-homocysteine-containing media for 4 h. VEGF mRNA expression was then analyzed by Northern blotting (Fig. 4A). Relative VEGF mRNA levels in cells treated with empty vector were increased by arsenite (3.8-fold) and dl-homocysteine (5.5-fold). The VEGF mRNA inductions were further increased in all treatment groups when ATF4 Wt protein was overexpressed. In contrast, the expression of ATF4 DN greatly inhibited VEGF expression under all three conditions. To confirm the effect of the ATF4 DN on VEGF expression, replicate ARPE-19 cultures were infected with ATF4 DN virus stock at a 1:120 dilution or Empty virus stock at a 1:320 dilution and 48 h later were incubated with media containing 100 μm sodium arsenite for 4 h. ATF4 DN mutant significantly reduced VEGF mRNA expression by 71% (p < 0.001, n = 3). Heme oxygenase-1 was previously shown to be an ATF4-responsive gene via ATF4 binding on the HO-1 promoter in a complex containing the bZIP transcription factor Nrf2 (18He C.H. Gong P. Hu B. Stewart D. Choi M.E. Choi A.M. Alam J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20858-20865Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (382) Google Scholar). In ARPE-19 cells infected with empty virus, HO-1 mRNA expression was induced 31-fold by arsenite treatment (Fig. 4A). In untreated control cells, exogenous overexpression of ATF4 Wt protein increased the expression of HO-1 mRNA by 3.8-fold, whereas ATF4 DN increased HO-1 expression by 54%. ATF4 Wt overexpression had no effect on HO-1 mRNA expression in arsenite treated cells, as the level was also 31-fold that of the untreated, empty virus-infected control. Expression of ATF4 DN reduced arsenite induction of HO-1 mRNA by 29%, to 22-fold compared with the untreated, empty virus-infected control. Thus, ATF4 Wt overexpression was sufficient to induce HO-1 expression and ATF4 DN had an inhibitory effect on HO-1 induction by arsenite, but these effects were not remarkable. In contrast to arsenite, homocysteine did not induce HO-1 mRNA expression. In fact, the induc"

In the present structure-function analysis, deletion of EF1 and EF2 of the N-terminal four EF-hand domains caused marked reduction of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2)-hydrolyzing activity in vitro and loss of Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity in mouse eggs after injection of RNA encoding the mutant. However, deletion of EF1 and EF2 or mutation of EF1 or EF2 at the x and z positions of the putative Ca2+-binding loop little affected the Ca2+ sensitivity of the PLC activity, whereas deletion of EF1 to EF3 caused 12-fold elevation of the EC50 of Ca2+ concentration. Thus, EF1 and EF2 are important for the PLCζ activity, and EF3 is responsible for its high Ca2+ sensitivity. Deletion of four EF-hand domains or the C-terminal C2 domain caused complete loss of PLC activity, indicating that both regions are prerequisites for PLCζ activity. Screening of interactions between the C2 domain and phosphoinositides revealed that C2 has substantial affinity to PI(3)P and, to the lesser extent, to PI(5)P but not to PI(4,5)P2 or acidic phospholipids. PI(3)P and PI(5)P reduced PLCζ activity in vitro, suggesting that the interaction could play a role for negative regulation of PLCζ. Sperm-specific phospholipase C-ζ (PLCζ) induces Ca2+ oscillations and egg activation when injected into mouse eggs. PLCζ has such a high Ca2+ sensitivity of PLC activity that the enzyme can be active in resting cells at ∼100 nm Ca2+, suitable for a putative sperm factor to be introduced into the egg at fertilization (Kouchi, Z., Fukami, K., Shikano, T., Oda, S., Nakamura, Y., Takenawa, T., and Miyazaki, S. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 10408–10412).

PLCζ is strongly noted in developmental biology because it is specifically expressed in mammalian sperm (1Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is capable of inducing repetitive increase in [Ca2+]i and subsequent early embryonic development when expressed in mouse eggs by injection of RNA encoding PLCζ (1Saunders C.M.

Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2513-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). At fertilization of mammals, evidence indicates that a cytosolic sperm factor is introduced into the ooplasm upon sperm-egg fusion and induces Ca2+ oscillations (4Swann K. Rev. Reprod. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 5Jones K.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar), which are due to Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum mainly through the IP3 receptor (6Miyazaki S. Shirakawa H. Nakada K. Honda Y. Dev. Biol. 1993; 158: 62-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar) and are a pivotal signal for egg activation (5Jones K.T. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 1998; 42: 1-10PubMed Google Scholar). Ca2+ oscillations similar to those at fertilization are produced by PLCζ expressed in a mouse egg at an estimated level comparable with the content in a single mouse sperm (1Saunders C.M. Larman M.G.

Kinoshita K. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 2004; 268: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Injection of recombinant PLCζ into mouse eggs induces Ca2+ oscillations as well (7Kouchi Z.

The Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity of sperm extract (4Swann K. Rev. Reprod. 1996; 1: 33-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 8Oda S. Deguchi R. Mohri T. Shikano T. Nakanishi S. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) is lost when the extract is pretreated with an antibody against PLCζ (1Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, PLCζ is a strong candidate for the sperm-derived Ca2+ oscillation-inducing protein.PLCζ possesses biochemically interesting characteristics. It is composed of four EF-hand domains in the N terminus, catalytic X and Y domains, and a C2 domain in the C terminus (1Saunders C.M. Larman M.G. Parrington J. Cox L.J. Royse J. Blayney L.M. Swann K. Lai F.A. Development (Camb.). 2002; 129: 3533-3544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A) common to other types of PLC, but PLCζ lacks the N-terminal PH domain found in PLCβ, -γ, -δ, and -ϵ. PH domain of PLCβ,-γ, or -δ binds to PI(3)P, PI(3,4,5)P3, or PI(4,5)P2, respectively (9Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 10Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 11Fukami K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The PH and C2 domains of PLCβ also interact with the G protein subunits Gβγ and Gαq, respectively, for activation of PLCβ (12Wang T. Dowal L. El-Maghrabi M.R. Rebecchi M.J. Scarlata S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7466-7469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 13Wang T. Pentyala S. Elliott J. Dowal L. Gupta E. Rebecci M.J. Scarlata S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 7843-7846Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). PLCγ is phosphorylated at the tyrosine residues 771, 783, and 1254 in response to growth factor stimulation leading to activation of PLCγ (9Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 10Rhee S.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 281-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 11Fukami K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). As for PLCζ, which lacks the PH domain, there is no prediction about the domain responsible for binding to phosphoinositides and for enzymatic activation.PLCζ has domain features similar to those of PLCδ except for the PH domain (Fig. 1A). PLCδ is suggested to be regulated by Ca2+ because PLCδ1 has Ca2+-binding sites in not only the EF-hand domains but also in the X and Y domains and the C2 domain (11Fukami K. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 2002; 131: 293-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). We have recently shown (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) that the PI(4,5)P2-hydrolyzing activity of recombinant PLCζ is ∼100-fold more sensitive to Ca2+ than that of PLCδ1 and is 70% maximal at 100 nm [Ca2+], which is usually the basal [Ca2+]i of cells. Recombinant PLCζ has ∼20-fold higher Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity than PLCδ1 (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Thus, PLCζ possesses remarkable properties that are favorable for the sperm factor to initiate (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) and maintain (3Larman M.G. Saunders C.M. Carroll J. Lai F.A. Swann K. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2513-2521Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar) Ca2+ oscillations via continuously produced IP3. Using mutational analysis in the present study, we addressed which domains of PLCζ are responsible for the Ca2+-sensitive PLC activity in vitro, Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity in mouse eggs, and phosphoinositide binding activity in vitro and the effect of phosphoinositide binding activity on the PLC activity. We focused on four N-terminal EF-hand domains because they are likely to be Ca2+-binding sites and could be critical for the high Ca2+ sensitivity. We also focused on the C2 domain, as three Ca2+-binding sites are predicted in the C2 domain of PLCδ1 (9Rebecchi M.J. Pentyala S.P. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1291-1335Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar, 14Ananthanarayanan B. Das S. Rhee S.G. Murray D. Cho W. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3568-3575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The C2 domain of PLCζ could play another role such as interaction with phosphoinositides. Our study revealed that both EF-hand domains and the C2 domain are critical for Ca2+ oscillation-inducing activity as well as the PLC activity of PLCζ. Furthermore, we found that the C2 domain of PLCζ binds to PI(3)P or PI(5)P, and this interaction may negatively regulate the PLC activity.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPlasmid Construction—cDNAs for mutants of PLCζ, domains of PLCζ and PLCδ1, and a PLCζEF/δ1 chimera were prepared using PCR techniques. To obtain recombinant PLCs, mutant DNAs were subcloned into pFastBacHT (Invitrogen) or GST-FastBac (provided by Dr. T. Takenawa) used in a baculovirus expression system (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K.

Kubota M. Mikoshiba K. Miyawaki A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2002; 20: 87-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (2158) Google Scholar), in the N terminus and subcloned into pBluescript II (SK+) containing the T7 promoter (Stratagene). The following proteins were prepared (see Fig. 1A for designation and domain features). 1) For EF-hand domain deletion mutants ΔEF1, ΔEF1–2, and ΔEF1–4, residues Met1–Leu39, Met1–Ile75, and Met1–Gln163 were deleted, respectively. PLCΔEF1–3 (s-PLCζ) that lacks 110 amino acid residues from the N terminus corresponding to three EF-hand domains (GenBank™ accession number AK006672) was cloned as described previously (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). 2) For ΔC2 and Δ611–647 deletion mutants, Leu522–Thr610 and Leu611–Glu647 were deleted. 3) For PLCζ having EF1AA and EF2AA, Asp20 and Gly24 in EF1 and Asp56 and Gln60 in EF2 were replaced with alanine corresponding to the x and z positions of the predicted EF-hand motif. 4) The C2 domain (ζC2D) isolated from PLCζ (Val520–Glu647) was prepared with added GST. 5) For PLCζEF/δ1, the residual region except the EF-hand domains (Asp164–Glu647) of PLCζ was replaced with that of PLCδ1 (Asp297–Glu756). 6) The isolated PH domain (δPHD) of PLCδ1 and its K30N/K32N mutant (16Stauffer T.P. Ahn S. Meyer T. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 343-346Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were prepared and fused with GST.The FYVE domain of mouse Hrs (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) (17Komada M. Kitamura N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 6213-6221Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar) was cloned from a mouse testis cDNA library and subcloned to the pGEX vector. A construct containing FYVE in duplicate (2xFYVE) was also prepared as described previously (18Gillooly D.J. Morrow I.C. Lindsay M. Gould R. Bryant N.J. Gaullier J.-M. Parton R.G. Stenmark H.

As expression of GST-tagged PLCζ protein in Sf9 cells was low, His-tagged PLCζ was expressed. Similarly, ΔEF1 and ΔEF1–2, and EF1AA and EF2AA were His-tagged. Other proteins including ΔEF1–4 were GST-tagged.

Open table in a new tab Infected Sf9 cells (0.5–1.5 liters) were lysed with a French pressure cell in a lysis buffer and centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 20 min. After filtration through a 0.22-μm filter, supernatant was applied to a Sepharose column (His-tagged protein to nickel-chelating Sepharose and GST-tagged protein to glutathione-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences)). The former protein was eluted with 300 mm imidazole, and the latter protein was eluted with 10 mm glutathione in elution buffer. Purified proteins were dialyzed against an intracellular buffer (120 mm KCl and 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.5).Measurement of PLC Activity—The PLC activity was assayed by hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 (19Nagano K.

In some experiments, one of other phospholipids was added to the micelles to examine its interference in the PI(4,5)P2-hydrolyzing activity of PLCζ. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 μl of chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v). Radioactive IP3 was extracted with 0.5 ml of 1 n HCl (19Nagano K. Fukami K. Minagawa T.

The membrane was air-dried and blocked in 1% (w/v) fatty acid-free bovine serum albumin and 3% skim milk in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20). It was incubated overnight at 4 °C in TBST containing 1.5 μg/ml recombinant ζC2D, 2xFYVE, or δ1PHD fused with GST. After three 10-min washes in TBST, the membrane was incubated successively with anti-GST antibody for 1 h and anti-rabbit avidin-biotin horseradish peroxidase conjugate for 30 min. After extensive washing, ζC2D, 2xFYVE, or δ1PHD that bound to phosphoinositides was visualized using nitrotetrazolium blue staining (POD immunostain kit, Wako).Fig. 4Binding assay of PLCζC2 domain to phosphoinositides.

Miyawaki (Brain Science Institute, RIKEN). RNA was synthesized by T7 polymerase using the T7 MessageMachine kit (Ambion), treated with phenol-chloroform, and then precipitated with ethanol. To facilitate expression in mouse eggs, RNA was added with 200–250 bases of poly(A) (21Aida T. Oda S. Awaji T. Yoshida K. Miyazaki S. Mol. Hum. Reprod. 2001; 7: 1039-1046Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar) by incubation for 30 min at 37 °C in the presence of 200 μm ATP and yeast poly(A) polymerase (Amersham Biosciences). Dried RNA was resolved in 150 mm KCl solution and adjusted to 50 ng/μl prior to injection into mouse eggs. To avoid folding of RNA, the diluted RNA was heated at 85 °C for 3 min and cooled on ice. RNA was injected into ∼10 eggs through a glass micropipette (injected amount, ∼5 pl/egg). The estimated concentration of RNA in the egg was ∼1.2 ng/μl, assuming the egg volume was ∼200 pl.Preparation of Eggs and [Ca2+]i Measurement—Mature mouse eggs were obtained from the oviducts of B6D2F1 female mice superovulated by intraperitoneal injection of gonadotropins (8Oda S. Deguchi R. Mohri T. Shikano T. Nakanishi S. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). They were loaded with the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2 (5 μm; dextran, Molecular Probes Inc.) in M2 medium for 8 min at 37 °C and then transferred to a plastic dish mounted on an inverted fluorescence microscope and heated at 30–32 °C. Fluorescence intensity (F) of fura-2 to 340 and 380 nm excitation lights was measured by a conventional Ca2+ imaging method using an image processor, and [Ca2+]i was indicated by the ratio F340/F380 (Fig. 3) (see Ref. 2Yoda A.

RNA (50 ng/μl) encoding the indicated protein was injected at the zero time. The ordinate in A–D is the fluorescence ratio of fura-2 in the egg excited by 340 and 380 nm lights and reflects [Ca2+]i. E, the time course of the increase in F that reflects the expression level of Venus-PLCζ or Venus-s-PLCζ. Note that F of Venus-PLCζ at 30 min (when the first Ca2+ spike occurred) (arrow 1) is much lower than F of Venus-s-PLCζ at 3 h after RNA injection (arrow 2). A small downward shift of F of Venus-PLCζ is caused by a decrease in autofluorescence of the egg upon increase in [Ca2+]i (2Yoda A. Oda S. Shikano T. Kouchi Z. Awaji T. Shirakawa H. Kinoshita K.

Emitted fluorescence was passed through the objective lens, a 510-nm dichroic mirror (DM510, Nikon), and a 520–560-nm bandpass filter (see Ref. 2Yoda A. Oda S. Shikano T. Kouchi Z. Awaji T.

The relation between F and the injected amount of recombinant Venus alone in the egg was obtained for calibration of expressed PLCζ.RESULTSEF-hand Domains and C2 Domain Are Necessary for Catalytic Activity of PLCζ—Table I presents the specific PI(4,5)P2-hydrolyzing activity of recombinant PLCζ protein and its mutants measured in vitro at [Ca2+] between 1 and 30 μm, at which a maximal activity was obtained. PLCζΔEF1–4, which lacks all of the four EF-hand domains, had no PLC activity at 1 and 10 μm [Ca2+] (Table I and Fig. 2A). s-PLCζ (PLCζΔEF1–3), a PLCζ variant that is expressed in the mouse testis and lacks the EF1, EF2, and EF3 domains, had substantial activity (20 nmol/min/mg at 10 μm [Ca2+]). Deletion of the C2 domain (PLCζΔC2) or the 37 amino acid residues in the C-terminal region next to the C2 domain (PLCζΔ611–647) resulted in complete loss of PLC activity (less than 0.1 nmol/min/mg) at 1 and 10 μm [Ca2+] (Table I). GST-tagged PLCζΔEF1–3 serves as a positive control for these inactive mutants that were tagged with GST. These results indicate that whole N-terminal EF-hand domains are critical for PLC activity and that the C2 domain including the C-terminal region is also prerequisite for PLC activity.Fig. 2Effects of EF-hand domain mutations on the Ca2+ sensitivity of the PLC activity. The PI(4,5)P2-hydrolyzing activity relative to the maximal activity of the respective mutant is plotted against [Ca2+] (mean values from three experiments). A, deletion mutation in the EF-hand domain or C2 domain. B, point mutation in EF1 or EF2. A decline of the PLC activity is observed at [Ca2+] higher than 3 μm for ΔEF1, ΔEF1–2, EF1AA, and EF2AA as well as for PLCζ (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S.

Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To examine the role of the residual region except for the EF-hand domains, a chimera was formed by replacing the region from the X domain to the C terminus of PLCζ with that of PLCδ1 (PLCζEF/δ1, Fig. 1A). This chimera showed no detectable PLC activity at 1 and 10 μm [Ca2+] (Table I) even if four EF-hand domains are normally prepared. Therefore, the enzymatic activity of PLCζ seems to require a specific matching in the PLCζ molecule between the four N-terminal EF-hand domains and the other region containing the catalytic X and Y domains and C-terminal C2 domain.Effects of Deletion of EF-hand Domains on PLC Activity and Its Ca2+ Sensitivity—The PLC activity of PLCζ was remarkably reduced when the EF-hand domains were deleted one by one from the N terminus (Table I). The specific activity (nmol/min/mg) assayed at 1 μm [Ca2+] was 1300 for PLCζ, 290 (22% activity of PLCζ) for deletion of EF1 (PLCζΔEF1), 40 (3%) for deletion of EF1 and EF2 (PLCζΔEF1–2), and 70 (5%) for deletion of EF1-EF3 (His-tagged s-PLCζ, assayed at 30 μm [Ca2+]). Thus, EF1 and EF2 are greatly responsible for the PLC activity.To analyze the Ca2+ sensitivity, the PLC activity was assayed at [Ca2+] between 10–9 and 3 × 10–5 m and presented as the percentage relative to the maximal activity (Fig. 2A). As reported previously (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), the PLC activity of PLCζ was significantly recognized at [Ca2+] as low as 10 nm and reached a maximum at 1 μm [Ca2+]. There was ∼80% maximal activity at 100 nm, which is the resting [Ca2+]i level in mouse eggs (8Oda S. Deguchi R. Mohri T. Shikano T. Nakanishi S. Miyazaki S. Dev. Biol. 1999; 209: 172-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) as well as somatic cells (22Miyazaki S. Jpn. J. Physiol. 1993; 43: 409-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The [Ca2+] for giving a half-maximal PLC activity, EC50, was obtained by fitting a curve to the data using the Hill equation. The EC50 of PLCζ was calculated as 32 nm. Deletion of EF1 and EF2 did not cause a marked decrease in the Ca2+ sensitivity (Fig. 2A). The EC50 was 98 nm for PLCζΔEF1 and 93 nm for PLCζΔEF1–2 (Table I). In contrast, the PLC activity of PLCζΔEF1–3 was about 15% maximal at 100 nm [Ca2+] and reached the maximum at 30 μm [Ca2+] (Fig. 2A). The EC50 was 373 nm, 12-fold higher than that of PLCζ (Table I). These results indicate that the region containing EF3 contributes to the high Ca2+ dependence of the PLC activity. However, the EC50 of PLCζΔEF1–3 is still 15-fold lower than that of PLCδ1 (5.7 μm) (7Kouchi Z. Fukami K. Shikano T. Oda S. Nakamura Y. Takenawa T. Miyazaki S. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 10408-10412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The Hill constant obtained from curves in Fig. 2A was around 1.0 for EF-hand domain deletion mutants as well as for PLCζ. There may be a coordinating structural determinant(s) other than EF1-EF3 for the highly Ca2+-sensitive enzymatic activity.Effects of Point Mutation in EF1 and EF2 on PLC Activity and Its Ca2+ Sensitivity—According to the ProDom EF-hand pattern (23Corpet F.

PPARgamma is also associated with anti-inflammatory responses. However, the signaling mechanism remains elusive. We have used a mouse model for asthma to determine the effect of PPARgamma agonists, rosiglitazone or pioglitazone, and PPARgamma on allergen-induced bronchial inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Administration of PPARgamma agonists or adenovirus carrying PPARgamma cDNA (AdPPARgamma) reduced bronchial inflammation and airway hyperresponsiveness. Expression of PPARgamma was increased by ovalbumin (OVA) inhalation, and the increase was further enhanced by the administration of the PPARgamma agonists or AdPPARgamma. Levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and eosinophil cationic protein were increased after OVA inhalation, and the increased levels were significantly reduced by the administration of PPARgamma agonists or AdPPARgamma. The results also showed that the administration of PPARgamma agonists or AdPPARgamma up-regulated phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) expression in allergen-induced asthmatic lungs. This up-regulation correlated with decreased phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity as measured by reduced phosphorylation of Akt. These findings demonstrate a protective role of PPARgamma in the pathogenesis of the asthma phenotype through regulation of PTEN expression."

However, overstimulation of NMDARs can also induce an excessive influx of Ca2+, resulting in the initiation and propagation of seizures and the neurodegeneration that accompanies ischemia and stroke (2Choi D.W.

Therefore, the modulation of NMDAR activity is of fundamental importance to the physiological functions of neurons (1Dingledine R. Borges K. Bowie D. Traynelis S.F. Pharmacol. Rev. 1999; 51: 7-61PubMed Google Scholar). Mounting evidence has shown that the function of NMDARs in neurons is often regulated by reversible phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions (4Lieberman D.N. Mody I.

It remains unclear whether NMDAR function is also regulated by proteolytic processing. Stimulation of NMDARs, which are highly Ca2+-permeable, can lead to the activation of the Ca2+-dependent protease, calpain (7Adamec R. Kent P. Anisman H. Shallow T. Merali Z. Neurosci. Biobehav.

Lynch D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Recent studies also show that the NR2 subunits are cleaved at their C termini by calpain in neurons (14Bi X. Rong Y. Chen J. Dang S. Wang Z. Baudry M.

Although it has been suggested that post-translational modification of NMDARs by calpain may be involved in regulation of NMDAR levels (16Guttmann R.P. Sokol S. Baker D.L. Simpkins K.L. Dong Y. Lynch D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), the physiological consequence of calpain-induced proteolysis of NMDARs in neurons is still unclear. To investigate whether calpain activation in neurons directly alters NMDAR channel function, we recorded whole-cell NMDAR-mediated current under calpain-activated conditions in acutely isolated and cultured cortical neurons. The present results showed that activation of calpain by prolonged glutamate or NMDA application caused down-regulation of NMDAR function, which was due to calpain-dependent degradation of NR2 subunits. This study presents direct evidence showing that calpain cleavage represents a negative feedback mechanism to down-regulate NMDAR function. Neuronal Culture—Primary cultures of rat cortical neurons were prepared as described previously (18Tomizawa K. Sunada S. Lu Y.F. Oda Y. Kinuta M. Ohshima T. Saito T. Wei F.Y. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Tsutsui K. Hisanaga S. Mikoshiba K. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 163: 813-824Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cortex was dissected on ice in Hanks' balanced salt solution (Sigma) and dissociated with 0.25% trypsin in Hanks' balanced salt solution. Neurons were seeded to a density of 2.7 × 103/mm2 on dishes coated with poly-d-lysine (100 mg/ml). After 24 h, Neurobasal growth medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal bovine serum was replaced with Neurobasal medium containing B27 supplement (Invitrogen) instead of serum. The cultures were maintained in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator at 37 °C for 10–14 days. Acute Dissociation Procedure—Cortical neurons from 3–5-week-old rats were acutely dissociated as described previously (19Feng J. Cai X. Zhao J.H. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6502-6511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Rats were anesthetized and decapitated following the regulations of the Animal Care Committee of the State University of New York at Buffalo. Brain slices (400 μm) were incubated for 1–6 h at room temperature in NaHCO3-buffered saline while bubbling with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The frontal cortical regions were then dissected and digested in an oxygenated chamber containing papain (0.4 mg/ml; Sigma) for 30–40 min at room temperature. The tissue was rinsed and bathed in low Ca2+, HEPES-buffered saline for 10 min and then mechanically dissociated with a graded series of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes. Dissociated cells were dispersed into a 35-mm Lux Petri dish positioned on the stage of an inverted microscope. Whole-cell Recordings—Experiments were performed in the standard whole-cell voltage-clamp mode using acutely dissociated and cultured cortical pyramidal neurons (20Wang X. Zhong P. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9852-9861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The external solution contained 127 mm NaCl, 20 mm CsCl, 10 mm HEPES, 1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm BaCl2, 0.02 mm glycine, 12 mm glucose, and 0.001 mm tetrodotoxin, pH 7.3–7.4, 300–305 mosm. The pipette solution contained 180 mm N-methyl-d-glucamine, 4 mm MgCl2, 40 mm HEPES, 0.1 mm BAPTA, 12 mm phosphocreatine, 2 mm Na2ATP, and 0.2 mm Na2GTP, pH 7.2–7.3, 265–270 mosm. Recordings were made with an Axon Instruments (Union City, CA) 200B patch clamp amplifier that was controlled and monitored with an IBM personal computer running pCLAMP (version 8) with a DigiData 1320 series interface (Axon Instruments). Electrode resistances were typically 2–4 megohms in the bath. After seal rupture, series resistance (4–10 megohms) was compensated (70–90%) and periodically monitored. The holding potential was -60 mV in all experiments. NMDA-evoked current was recorded with NMDA (100 μm) application for 2 s every 30 s. For recording of the GABAA receptor-mediated current, cell membrane potential was held at 0 mV, and GABA (50 μm) was applied for 2 s every 30 s (19Feng J. Cai X. Zhao J.H. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 6502-6511Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For prolonged NMDA or glutamate treatment, NMDA (100 μm) or glutamate (500 μm) was continuously applied for 5 min or sequentially applied in a pattern of 20 s on, 20 s off for 5 min in the presence of 2 mm external Ca2+. Peak NMDAR current was detected before and after the prolonged NMDA receptor stimulation to generate a plot as a function of time and drug application. Drugs were delivered using a gravity-fed “sewer pipe” system with an array of capillaries positioned 150 μm from the cell under recording. Solution switches were carried out using the SF-77B fast-step solution stimulus delivery device (Warner Instrument Co., Hamden, CT). Data were analyzed using AxoGraph (Axon Instruments), Kaleidagraph (Albeck Software, Reading, PA), and Statview (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, CA). Results are presented as the mean ± S.E. to compare the percentage modulation of NMDAR current by prolonged NMDA or glutamate treatment in the absence or presence of various drug applications. Western Blotting Analysis—Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously (21Tomizawa K. Ohta J. Matsushita M. Moriwaki A. Li S.T. Takei K. Matsui H. J. Neurosci. 2002; 22: 2590-2597Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the polyclonal antibodies against NR2A (NR2A-specific, C-terminal, amino acids 1253–1391) and NR2B (NR2B-specific, C-terminal, amino acids 984–1104) were from Sigma. The polyclonal antibody against NR1 (N-terminal, amino acids 259–278) was purchased from Upstate (Lake Placid, NY), the monoclonal anti-actin antibodies were from Sigma, and the monoclonal antibodies against non-erythroid α-spectrin were from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). After incubation with the appropriate secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Sigma-Aldrich), positive bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (ECL; Amersham Biosciences). To evaluate quantitative expression, the scanned digital images of each NMDAR subunit were quantified using National Institutes of Health Image software. Prolonged NMDA or Glutamate Stimulation Induces Sustained Down-regulation of NMDAR Current in Both Acutely Isolated and Cultured Cortical Neurons—To study the impact of prolonged NMDA receptor stimulation on NMDA receptor function, we recorded whole-cell NMDAR-mediated current in acutely isolated cortical neurons. NMDAR current was evoked by brief applications of NMDA (100 μm, 2 s) every 30 s in a Mg2+-free solution (20Wang X. Zhong P. Gu Z. Yan Z. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 9852-9861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Chen G. Greengard P. Yan Z. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 24: 2596-2600Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1A, the NMDAR current amplitude was stable throughout the recording period. However, if a prolonged application of NMDA (100 μm, 5 min) was given to the cell, the subsequently recorded NMDAR current was markedly reduced in amplitude (Fig. 1B, 38.4 ± 5.0%; n = 8). Similar results were obtained with cultured cortical neurons (37.2 ± 3.2%; n = 4). To examine whether the NMDA-induced current reduction was reversible, we performed long recordings of the whole-cell NMDAR current (every 20 min for 100 min after prolonged NMDA application). As shown in Fig. 1, C and D, following prolonged NMDA treatment (100 μm, 5 min), NMDA current stayed at the depressed level persistently (for >100 min), with no progressive decline or recovery. Prolonged treatment with glutamate (500 μm, 5 min) also caused a profound reduction of the NMDAR current amplitude (Fig. 1E, 39.1 ± 3.6%; n = 3). Blocking the opening of NMDAR channels with 2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (APV) (25 μm) during prolonged NMDA treatment prevented the suppression of NMDAR current (Fig. 1F, 5.3 ± 2.9%; n = 4). These results indicate that prolonged NMDA receptor stimulation causes a sustained and irreversible down-regulation of NMDAR current in both acutely dissociated and cultured cortical neurons. It has been found that during a few seconds of NMDA application, the Ca2+ influx causes the NMDAR-mediated whole-cell current to inactivate from its peak to a lower steady-state level, a process called Ca2+-dependent inactivation (CDI) (23Legendre P. Rosenmund C. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 674-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vyklicky Jr., L. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 575-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Medina I.

Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). CDI can be quantitated by using the ratio of the steadystate current (Iss) measured at the end of a 2-s NMDA pulse to the peak current (Ip) (26Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that although the amplitude of NMDAR current (both Ip and Iss) was substantially reduced following prolonged NMDAR stimulation, the CDI (the ratio of Iss to Ip) was not significantly altered (CDI measured at 10 min after prolonged NMDA treatment: 0.31 ± 0.05, n = 8; CDI measured at the same time but without prolonged NMDA treatment: 0.34 ± 0.02, n = 4). The Reduction of NMDAR Current by Prolonged NMDA Treatment Is due to Calpain Activation—We then investigated the mechanism underlying the down-regulation of NMDAR current by prolonged NMDA treatment. We first examined the Ca2+ dependence using intracellular injection of a high concentration (10 mm) of the Ca2+ chelator, BAPTA. As shown in Fig. 2A, prolonged NMDA treatment failed to suppress NMDAR current in the cell dialyzed with a high concentration of BAPTA, suggesting the requirement of elevation of intracellular Ca2+ in this process. Activation of NMDA receptors triggers a Ca2+ influx, which could activate many Ca2+-dependent enzymes, such as calpain (8Lynch D.R. Guttmann R.P. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 300: 717-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar), calcineurin (27Klee C.B. Ren H. Wang X. J. Biol.

J. 2002; 364: 593-611Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar). We hypothesize that prolonged NMDA receptor stimulation may induce the accumulation of excessive intracellular Ca2+ and activate calpain, which in turn cleaves functional NMDARs and suppresses NMDAR current. To test this hypothesis, we examined the consequences of inhibiting calpain activity. As shown in Fig. 2B, bath application of the calpain inhibitor ALLN (20 μm) had no effect on basal NMDAR current but completely abolished the down-regulation of NMDAR current by prolonged NMDA treatment. To further confirm the involvement of calpain, we applied a peptide (namely, CS peptide) derived from the endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin. The CS peptide contains the functional sequence of TIPPKYR that is critical for inhibition of calpain activity (31Kawasaki H. Emori Y. Imajoh-Ohmi S. Minami Y. Suzuki K. J. Biochem.

Our previous studies showed that the 11R-CS peptide is a potent, membrane-permeable, and specific inhibitor of calpain (28Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Lu Y.F. Li S.T. Matsui H. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 47: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Oda Y. Wei F.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Matsui H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4929-4940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). As demonstrated in Fig. 2C, 11R-CS (2 μm) itself had no effect on basal NMDAR current, but in the presence of 11R-CS, prolonged application of NMDA failed to reduce the NMDAR current. Consistently, dialysis with the CS peptide (5 μm) also prevented down-regulation of the NMDAR current by prolonged NMDA treatment (Fig. 2D). In the presence of the control peptide, 11R (5 μm), the suppression of NMDAR current by prolonged NMDA treatment remained intact (Fig. 2E). The effect of prolonged NMDA treatment on NMDAR current in the absence or presence of various inhibitors is summarized in Fig. 2F. Prolonged NMDA treatment (5 min, 100 μm) induced a marked reduction of NMDA current in dissociated or cultured cortical pyramidal neurons (38.0 ± 5.5%; n = 12). This effect was significantly attenuated when the intracellular Ca2+ was chelated by a high concentration of BAPTA (5.2 ± 2.8%; n = 4). This effect was also blocked when endogenous calpain was inhibited by external application of ALLN (8.5 ± 1.3%; n = 4) or 11R-CS peptide (5.6 ± 5.9%; n = 5), as well as by internal dialysis with the CS peptide (4.3 ± 2.1%; n = 7). However, the current-reducing effect was not affected in neurons dialyzed with the 11R control peptide (33.8 ± 3.1%; n = 4). Taken together, these results indicate that the reduction of NMDAR current induced by prolonged NMDA treatment is specifically mediated by endogenous calpain activation. The Reduction of NMDAR Current by Prolonged NMDA Treatment Does Not Involve Dynamin-mediated Endocytosis of NMDA Receptors—An alternative mechanism that may underlie the down-regulation of NMDAR current by prolonged NMDA treatment is a decrease of functional surface NMDA receptors mediated by clathrin/dynamin-dependent endocytosis (33Vissel B. Krupp J.J. Heinemann S.F. Westbrook G.L. Nat. Neurosci. 2001; 4: 587-596Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar, 34Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Ju W. Kalia L.V. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 2003; 422: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar). To evaluate this potential mechanism, we tested the effect of prolonged NMDA application on NMDAR current in cells dialyzed with the dynamin inhibitory peptide QVPSR-PNRAP, which competitively blocks binding of dynamin to amphiphysin (35Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W.

Christine C.W. Kalman D. Kitamura M. Hardy S. Nicoll R.A. Malenka R.C. von Zastrow M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7097-7102Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar, 37Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The effectiveness of the dynamin inhibitory peptide in blocking clathrin-dependent endocytosis was confirmed by its ability to prevent the internalization of GABAA receptors and up-regulate GABA type A receptor-mediated current (Fig. 3A, 18.5 ± 3.0%; n = 7), consistent with previous results (37Kittler J.T. Delmas P. Jovanovic J.N. Brown D.A. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7972-7977Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, when NMDAR endocytosis was inhibited by the dynamin inhibitory peptide (50 μm), prolonged NMDA treatment still induced a potent suppression of NMDAR current (Fig. 3, B and C, 32.0 ± 2.9%; n = 5). This result suggests that the clathrin/dynamin-dependent NMDAR endocytosis is not involved in the down-regulation of NMDAR current induced by prolonged NMDA treatment. Calpain Induces Degradation of the NR2 Subunits in Glutamate-treated Neuronal Cultures—Our previous studies showed that calpain is activated during the application of excessive glutamate in cultured cortical neurons (28Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Lu Y.F. Li S.T. Matsui H. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 47: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 29Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Oda Y. Wei F.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Matsui H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4929-4940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). To provide more direct evidence for the regulation of NMDA receptors by calpain, we examined the protein expression levels of NMDAR subunits in cultured cortical neurons following prolonged glutamate treatment. As shown in Fig. 4A, the NMDAR subunits NR1, NR2A, and NR2B were normally expressed in cultured cortical neurons. NR2C was undetectable (data not shown), consistent with the lack of NR2C in some areas of the brain such as the hippocampus and cortex (17Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 38Nakanishi S. Science. 1992; 258: 597-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (2293) Google Scholar). After a 15-min application of glutamate (500 μm), a markedly reduced protein level of NR2A and NR2B was detected. The NR2A or NR2B antibody detects the Western blot band with a relative molecular mass of 180 kDa, which is the predicted size of full-length NR2A or NR2B, suggesting that both antibodies recognize the non-cleaved full-length NR2A and NR2B subunits remaining in neurons after prolonged glutamate treatment. The loss of full-length NR2A and NR2B proteins could be detected 15 min after glutamate treatment and gradually increased thereafter. Semiquantitative assays did not show any significant change in the NR1 level or actin level under the same experimental conditions, which is consistent with a previous study showing that the NR1 subunit (detected with a C-terminal NR1 antibody) was not degraded during glutamate excitotoxicity in cultured hippocampal neurons (17Simpkins K.L. Guttmann R.P. Dong Y. Chen Z. Sokol S. Neumar R.W. Lynch D.R. J. Neurosci. 2003; 23: 11322-11331Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The expression level of NR1, NR2A, and NR2B at different time points after prolonged glutamate treatment is summarized in Fig. 4B. Both NR2A and NR2B expression showed a 25–50% decrease within 1 h after glutamate treatment (500 μm, 15 min). To examine whether calpain is responsible for the degradation of both the NR2A and NR2B subunits after prolonged glutamate application, we examined the protein levels of NMDA receptor subunits after excessive glutamate treatment in the presence of calpain inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 4C, degradation of NR2A and NR2B was clearly detected 30 min after prolonged glutamate treatment, and cleavage of NR2A and NR2B, as well as cleavage of α-spectrin, a well-defined substrate of calpain (9Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), was substantially blocked by the 11R-CS peptide. Treatment with the 11R-CS peptide alone (without glutamate application) caused no change in any of the proteins tested. Semiquantitative assay (Fig. 4D) showed that glutamate treatment (500 μm, 15 min) significantly decreased the protein level of full-length NR2A and NR2B (NR2A: 49.8 ± 10.2% of control, NR2B: 54.1 ± 4.9% of control, n = 7; p < 0.01, ANOVA, compared with control). Glutamate exposure also induced a significant loss of the full-length α-spectrin (43.9 ± 5.7% of control, n = 7; p < 0.01, ANOVA, compared with control), further confirming that calpain was activated after prolonged glutamate treatment. Pre-incubation with the calpain inhibitory peptide 11R-CS significantly reduced the glutamate-induced change in both NR2A and NR2B (NR2A: 80.3 ± 5.8% of control, NR2B: 83.1 ± 4.7% of control, n = 7; p < 0.01, ANOVA, compared with Glu). These biochemical findings suggest that prolonged glutamate treatment induces calpain-specific degradation of NR2A and NR2B subunits in cultured cortical neurons. The present report provides the first direct evidence showing that NMDAR function in neurons is modulated by calpain following NMDAR overstimulation. Using whole-cell patch clamp recording, we found that activation of calpain by prolonged glutamate or NMDA treatment caused sustained suppression of the NMDAR current in cortical pyramidal neurons, and this effect was blocked specifically by calpain inhibitors. Biochemical data show that both NR2A and NR2B subunits were degraded following excessive glutamate stimulation in cultured cortical neurons, and this effect was also abolished by the specific calpain inhibitory peptide. Although dynamin-dependent NMDAR endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits participates in the regulation of NMDAR function (34Nong Y. Huang Y.Q. Ju W. Kalia L.V. Ahmadian G. Wang Y.T. Salter M.W. Nature. 2003; 422: 302-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (352) Google Scholar), we found that dynamin-mediated NMDAR internalization is not involved in the reduction of NMDAR current induced by prolonged NMDAR stimulation in neurons. Taken together, these findings support the idea that prolonged stimulation of NMDA receptors induces the activation of calpain, which leads to the cleavage and degradation of NMDA receptors, resulting in the down-regulation of NMDAR function. Prolonged NMDA receptor stimulation profoundly reduced both the peak (Ip) and steady-state (Iss) NMDAR current, but it did not alter the CDI of NMDA receptors (measured by the ratio of Iss to Ip), indicating that the calpain-mediated down-regulation of NMDA receptors is different from the previously reported CDI (23Legendre P. Rosenmund C. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 674-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 24Vyklicky Jr., L. J. Physiol. 1993; 470: 575-600Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 25Medina I. Filippova N. Bakhramov A. Bregestovski P. J. Physiol. 1996; 495: 411-427Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), which occurs via Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent release of the NMDA receptor from the actin cytoskeleton (26Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1998; 21: 443-453Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Because previous electrophysiological studies often used high concentrations of Ca2+ chelators (23Legendre P. Rosenmund C. Westbrook G.L. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 674-684Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Zhang S. Ehlers M.D. Bernhardt J.P. Su C.T. Huganir R.L.

Neuron. 1993; 10: 805-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar) in recording pipettes, substantial elevation of intracellular Ca2+ and ensuing activation of calpain were prevented, which explains the lack of findings regarding calpain modulation of NMDAR current in former studies. Increasing evidence has suggested that calpain proteolysis modifies the activities of the substrate. For example, calpain converts its substrates, protein kinase C and calcineurin, to active forms (28Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Matsushita M. Lu Y.F. Li S.T. Matsui H. Neurosci. Res. 2003; 47: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Kishimoto A. Mikawa K. Hashimoto K. Yasuda I. Tanaka S. Tominaga M. Kuroda T. Nishizuka Y. J. Biol.

In this study, we provide electrophysiological and biochemical evidence showing that calpain down-regulates the function of another substrate, NMDA receptors, by cleaving NR2 subunits, which leads to a significant reduction of the number of functional channels on the neuronal membrane. Consistent with this, in a heterologous expression system, calpain-mediated cleavage of NR2 subunits destroys NMDA receptors, resulting in the loss of NMDA receptors from the cell surface and thus the reduced calcium uptake (16Guttmann R.P. Sokol S. Baker D.L. Simpkins K.L. Dong Y. Lynch D.R. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 2002; 302: 1023-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Our data suggest that calpain may act as an endogenous down-regulator of NMDAR activity in response to extreme physiological conditions, such as NMDAR overstimulation. It was found previously that calpain plays a major role in cell death during ischemia and stroke (9Saido T.C. Yokota M. Nagao S. Yamaura I. Tani E. Tsuchiya T. Suzuki K. Kawashima S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25239-25243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Saido T.C. Sorimachi H. Suzuki K. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 814-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar, 42Wang K.K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (808) Google Scholar), whereas our current results suggest that calpain activation may function as a negative feedback to reduce neuronal NMDAR activity and protect neurons from excitotoxicity. This paradox can be explained as follows. In addition to NMDA receptors, activated calpain cleaves many other substrates, such as calcineurin (29Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Oda Y. Wei F.Y. Lu Y.F. Matsushita M. Li S.T. Moriwaki A. Matsui H. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 4929-4940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar), cyclin-dependent kinase 5 activators (43Lee M.S.

Cell Biol. 2000; 150: 887-894Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). Calpain cleavage of these substrates plays a critical role in excitotoxic neurodegeneration (29Wu H.Y. Tomizawa K. Oda Y.

Nature. 2000; 405: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Moreover, the calpain-mediated release of lysosomal enzyme cathepsin also contributes to ischemic neuronal death (46Yamashima T. Prog. Neurobiol. 2000; 62: 273-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar). Because Ca2+-induced calpain activation with the resultant proteolysis occurs immediately (within minutes) after the ischemic insult (47Lee K.S. Frank S. Vanderklish P. Arai A. Lynch G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7233-7237Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar), whereas neuronal death occurs 3–5 days after ischemia (48Garcia J.H. Liu K.F. Ye Z.R. Gutierrez J.A. Stroke. 1997; 28: 2303-2309Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), calpain may function as a mediator of the pathological process instead of as the ultimate destroyer. Following the hyperactivation of NMDA receptors, the initial response of calpain is to down-regulate NMDAR function by proteolysis of NR2 subunits, in order to limit calcium entry and minimize NMDAR-mediated excitotoxicity. If the protective mechanism is overridden by excessive calpain activation, the downstream cell death pathways will be triggered. We thank Dr. David. R. Lynch (University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine) for helpful discussions."
https://openalex.org/W2059965072,"Nucleotide pyrophosphatases/phosphodiesterases (NPPs) are ubiquitous membrane-associated or secreted ectoenzymes that release nucleoside 5′-monophosphate from a variety of nucleotides and nucleotide derivatives. The mammalian NPP family comprises seven members, but only three of these (NPP1–3) have been studied in some detail. Previously we showed that lysophospholipase D, which hydrolyzes lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to produce lysophosphatidic acid, is identical to NPP2. More recently an uncharacterized novel NPP member (NPP7) was shown to have alkaline sphingomyelinase activity. These findings raised the possibility that other members of the NPP family act on phospholipids. Here we show that the sixth member of the NPP family, NPP6, is a choline-specific glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase. The sequence of NPP6 encodes a transmembrane protein containing an NPP domain with significant homology to NPP4, NPP5, and NPP7/alkaline sphingomyelinase. When expressed in HeLa cells, NPP6 was detected in both the cells and the cell culture medium as judged by Western blotting and by enzymatic activity. Recombinant NPP6 efficiently hydrolyzed the classical substrate for phospholipase C, <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl phosphorylcholine, but not the classical nucleotide phosphodiesterase substrate, <i>p</i>-nitrophenyl thymidine 5′-monophosphate. In addition, NPP6 hydrolyzed LPC to form monoacylglycerol and phosphorylcholine but not lysophosphatidic acid, showing it has a lysophospholipase C activity. NPP6 showed a preference for LPC with short (12:0 and 14:0) or polyunsaturated (18:2 and 20:4) fatty acids. It also hydrolyzed glycerophosphorylcholine and sphingosylphosphorylcholine efficiently. In mice, NPP6 mRNA was predominantly detected in kidney with a lesser expression in brain and heart, and in human it was detected in kidney and brain. The present results suggest that NPP6 has a specific role through the hydrolysis of polyunsaturated LPC, glycerophosphorylcholine, or sphingosylphosphorylcholine in these organs."

https://openalex.org/W2144568788,"Obesity, a state of apparent ""leptin resistance"" is well known to be associated with insulin resistance. In diet-induced obesity (DIO), hepatic insulin signaling is impaired but the link between leptin and insulin signaling pathways is only incompletely defined. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of DIO on leptin and insulin cross-signaling in the liver. Leptin receptor expression was measured by in situ hybridization with pan-leptin receptor probes and by immunoblotting. Furthermore, intracellular signaling was investigated in vivo under basal conditions and at 45 and 360 min after stimulation with a bolus of human recombinant leptin (hrec-leptin; 1 mg/kg body wt) or saline. At baseline, all forms of the leptin receptor were markedly to completely down-regulated in DIO rats. Hrec-leptin bolus injection stimulated leptin-dependent signaling with a fivefold increase in JAK-2pY in lean but not in DIO rats. Basal IRpY, IRS-1pY, IRS-1p85, IRS-2pY, IRSp85, and PKBpT308 levels were reduced (P<0.01) in DIO rats as compared with lean controls. Basal GSK-3beta serine phosphorylation (S9) was higher (P<0.01) in lean animals along with lower basal PEPCK activity compared with DIO rats consistent with the insulin and leptin resistance of the latter. Only in lean animals phosphorylation of PKB (T308) and GSK-3beta (S9) was acutely stimulated by leptin at 45 min followed by inhibition at 6 h after application. AMPKalpha protein levels as well as basal and leptin-stimulated total and alpha-specific AMPK activity were comparable in both groups. These data show that in a model of dietary-induced obesity 1) leptin receptors and subsequent signaling events are down-regulated, 2) basal insulin signaling is impaired, and 3) the cross-talk between leptin and insulin signaling is differentially regulated by the nutritional status, which is sensed by AMPK in rat liver. Thus, the liver seems to play a major role in the modulation of the leptin signal and insulin resistance in obesity."

In each of these muscle diseases, the binding of IIH6 and VIA4-1 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) to α-DG is lost, and α-DG does not bind its ligands, including laminin, agrin, and neurexin (24Michele D.E.

However, catalytic activities for fukutin, FKRP, and LARGE have not been demonstrated, although it has been shown that the interaction of LARGE with the N-terminal domain of α-DG is required for the functional glycosylation of α-DG (21Kanagawa M.

Most surprisingly, overexpression of LARGE, but not POMGnT1, “rescues” functional glycosylation of α-DG in dystrophic muscle cells derived from patients with WWS that cannot synthesize O-Man glycans (17Barresi R.

Here we show that α-DG glycan epitopes and laminin binding are induced by mouse Large in mutants with a defect in the transfer of sialic acid, fucose, or galactose and in a mutant that cannot make O-Man glycans. In addition, we show that α-DG glycan epitopes are particularly sensitive to N-glycanase in Lec2 and Lec8 cells and are enhanced by core 2 N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase 1 (C2GnT1), indicating mechanisms by which LARGE may rescue muscle cells with dystroglycanopathies.MATERIALS AND METHODSCell Culture and Transfection—Parent Pro-5 CHO cells, the loss-of-function CHO mutants derived from them termed Lec1 (clone 3C) (36Stanley P.

All cells were grown and maintained in α-modified Eagle's medium (Invitrogen) with 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini) in suspension or on plates in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Lec15 cells were grown in monolayer in 5% CO2 at 34 °C. For transient transfections, adherent cells on 10-cm plates were transfected with 12–15 μg of plasmid DNA using Lipofectamine 2000™ (Invitrogen) or FuGENE 6™ (Roche Applied Science) per the manufacturer's guidelines. Transfectants were washed, and cell lysates were made 48–72 h post-transfection as described below. Stable transfectant populations were selected for resistance to G418 (Invitrogen).Mouse Large, Human C2GnT1, and Human POMGnT1 cDNA Expression Constructs—A full-length Large cDNA expression construct was generated by Dr. Sung-Hae Park. The coding region of the mouse Large gene was amplified by PCR from mouse liver cDNA (Marathon-Ready™ cDNA, Clontech) using primers PS565 (5′ GGC ACT TCT GAG AGG ATG CTG GGA ATC, forward) and PS566 (5′ TAG TAG TGC TAG CTG TTG TTC TCA GCT G, reverse). The products were purified and used as template in a second round of PCR to generate cDNA flanked by restriction enzyme sites for cloning. A cDNA containing the open reading frame for the 756-aa mouse Large protein was obtained using primers PS569 (5′ CCC CTC GAG GCC ACC ATG CTG GGA ATC TGC AGA GGG AGA, forward, with XhoI site) and PS570 (5′ CCC GCG GCC GCT AGC TGT TGT TCT CAG CTG TGA G, reverse, with NotI site) and cloned into pcDNA3.1/Myc-His(-)B (Invitrogen). The encoded Large protein had both a Myc and a histidine (6×) tag at the C terminus. A human C2GnT1 cDNA expression construct in pZeo SV2+ vector (Invitrogen) containing the coding region amplified from HL60 cells was generated by Dr. Masahiro Asada. Primers used for PCR were PS299 (5′ GAA ATT GTC AGG AAG CTC AAG) and PS300 (5′ TCC AAA CAC TGG ATG GCA AAG). Plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing using dye-labeled terminators by the DNA Core Facility of the Albert Einstein Cancer Center. Human POMGnT1 cDNA (∼2.7 kb, with full open reading frame of ∼1.9 kb), cloned from HepG2 cells in the pME18S-FL3 vector by the NEDO full-length human cDNA sequencing project (43Yudate H.T. Suwa M.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 185-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), was kindly provided by Dr. Harry Schachter, University of Toronto.Cell Surface Biotinylation and Immunoprecipitation of β-DG—Three days after transfection with Large, cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS: 140 mm NaCl, 2.7 mm KCl, 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, and 1.47 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.4) and resuspended in PBS, pH 8.0 (6 ml per 10 cm plate of cells), containing 1 mg/ml EZ-link™ sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce). After incubation at room temperature for 30 min, cells were pelleted and washed once with PBS, pH 7.4. Cells were resuspended in 400 μl of lysis buffer (1.5% Triton X-100, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, and 1× Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), vortexed, and incubated on ice for 10 min. After centrifugation at 6000 × g for 3 min, the supernatant was collected, and the volume was adjusted to 800 μl with lysis buffer lacking detergent. The lysate was incubated with 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) at 4 °C for 1 h. After bead removal, cleared lysate was incubated with 60 μl of anti-β-DG mouse IgG2A monoclonal antibody (mAb) 43DAG1/8D5 (Novocastra) for 3 h at 4 °C with rotation before 50 μl of protein A/G-agarose beads were added. After overnight incubation at 4 °C with rotation, the beads were washed four times with Tris-buffered saline (TBS, 140 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4) containing 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST). The concentration of NaCl was raised to 325 mm for the final wash. The beads were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and a third of the immunoprecipitated proteins was electrophoresed for immunoblotting.Electrophoresis of Cell Lysates and Immunoblotting—Cell lysates were prepared from transient transfectants 2–3 days after transfection using 75–100 μl of lysis buffer per 10-cm plate of washed cells. The concentration of proteins in lysates was determined by Bio-Rad Dc protein assay. For electrophoresis, lysates (40–60 μg of protein) were boiled for 5 min in gel loading buffer containing 2% SDS and 143 mm β-mercaptoethanol. After electrophoresis in a 4–20% Tris-HCl gradient polyacrylamide gels (Bio-Rad) at 10–30 mA for ∼2 h, proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane overnight at 50–100 mA in buffer containing 10% methanol. For immunoblotting, membranes were blocked in TBST with 5% milk and incubated in the same solution with primary antibody at room temperature for an hour. After washing in TBST for 20–30 min, membrane was incubated in TBST/milk with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody for 1–2 h at room temperature. After washing in TBST for 20–30 min, membrane was incubated in Super Signal West Pico™ chemiluminescence reagent (Pierce) and exposed to photographic film (Eastman Kodak Co.). Mouse anti-glycosylated α-DG mAbs VIA4-1 and IIH6 were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., and were used at 1:1000–2000 dilution. mAb 43DAG1/8D5 (hybridoma conditioned medium) from Novacastra was used at 1:200 dilution. Mouse anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (Calbiochem) was used at 1:500–1000 dilution. Mouse anti-NCAM mAb OB11 (Sigma) was used at 1:500 dilution. Rabbit anti-calnexin polyclonal antibody (Stressgen) was used at 1:500 dilution. Streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Vector Laboratories) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Sigma) were used at 1:5000–1:10,000 dilution.Glycosidase Digestion—Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) from Flavobacterium meningosepticum was obtained from New England Biolabs. PNGase F treatment of lysates was performed per the manufacturer's guidelines at 37 °C for 6–12 h in 40–80 μl with buffers provided by the manufacturer. 500 units of PNGase F was used for lysates with 100–300 μg of protein. The enzyme was omitted from control reactions.Laminin Overlay Assay—Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane with transferred proteins was incubated at 4 °C for 1 h in laminin binding buffer (LBB; 10 mm ethanolamine, 140 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2 and 1 mm CaCl2, pH 7.4) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and subsequently with LBB/milk containing 5 μg/ml laminin-1 (U. S. Biochemical Corp., from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse sarcoma fluid) overnight at 4 °C. After washing in LBB for 20–40 min, bound laminin was detected using a rabbit anti-laminin-1 polyclonal antibody (Sigma; 1:1500 dilution) by immunoblotting as described above.Sucrose Gradient Fractionation—CHO cells stably expressing transfected mouse Large were subjected to cell fractionation as described previously (44Chaney W. Sundaram S. Friedman N. Stanley P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Four membrane fractions that separated Golgi from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) were isolated from sucrose gradients and assayed for β(1,4)-galactosyltransferase (β4GalT) activity using GlcNAc as acceptor as described (44Chaney W. Sundaram S. Friedman N. Stanley P. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 2089-2096Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Each fraction (15 μg of protein) was also subjected to Western blot analysis as described above after electrophoresis on a 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gel using polyclonal antibodies to protein-disulfide isomerase (PDI; Stressgen) at 1:4000 dilution and mouse anti-Myc mAb 9E10 (Calbiochem) at 1:500–1000 dilution.Purification of Recombinant α-DG—DGFc5, a rabbit α-DG (30–653 aa) construct in the hIgG1Fc-pcDNA3 vector, was a kind gift of Dr. Michael Oldstone, The Scripps Research Institute (45Kunz S. Sevilla N. McGavern D.B. Campbell K.P. Oldstone M.B. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 301-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). α-DG generated from this construct is fused at the C terminus to the hIgG1 Fc domain and is secreted. CHO cells grown on a 10-cm dish were transiently transfected with 7.5 μg each of DGFc5 and full-length mouse Large or empty expression constructs using the FuGENE 6™ transfection reagent. Serum-free cell culture-conditioned Opti-MEM™ (Invitrogen) medium was collected after 48–60 h and incubated with protein A/G-agarose beads (10 μl per ml) with 1× Complete™ EDTA-free protease inhibitor mixture and 0.5% Tween 20 at 4 °C for 2–4 h. The beads were washed twice with TBST and twice with TBST containing 0.5 m NaCl. Washed beads were boiled for 5 min in SDS-PAGE loading buffer, and the supernatant was electrophoresed on a 4–20% gradient Tris-HCl-polyacrylamide gel for Coomassie Blue staining and electrotransfer for immunoblotting.Sequence Analyses—The protein sequence of mouse Large was analyzed using BLAST (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/), Clustal W1.8 (www.ch.embnet.org/software/ClustalW.html), Transmembrane HMM 2.0 (www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/), COILS (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html), PSORT II (psort.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), and CD-search (ncbi.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml).

https://openalex.org/W2085960705,"Human fibroproliferative disorders like hypertrophic scarring of the skin are characterized by increased contractility and excess extracellular matrix synthesis. A beneficial role of transforming growth factor (TGF)-β in wound healing was proposed; however, chronic stimulation by this cytokine leads to fibrosis. In the present report, the intracellular TGF-β signaling in fibroblasts derived from hypertrophic scars and normal skin was examined. In an attempt to intervene in profibrogenic TGF-β functions, ectopic expression of Smad7 or dominant negative Smads3/4 completely inhibited contractility of scar-derived and normal fibroblasts after suspension in collagen gels. Both cell types displayed constitutive Smad2/3 phosphorylation and (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc activity with expression and phosphorylation of Smad3 being predominant in hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts. Down-regulation of intrinsic signaling with various TGF-β antagonists, e.g. soluble TGF-β receptor, latency-associated peptide, and anti-TGF-β1 antibodies, confirms autocrine TGF-β stimulation of both cell populations. Further, Smad7 expression inhibited α1 (I) collagen and α-smooth muscle actin expression. In summary, our data indicate that autocrine TGF-β/Smad signaling is involved in contractility and matrix gene expression of fibroblasts from normal and hypertrophic scars. Smad7 inhibits these processes and may exert beneficial effects on excessive scar formation.

Smad7 inhibits these processes and may exert beneficial effects on excessive scar formation. Hypertrophic scars are skin abnormalities secondary to traumatic or surgical injuries, characterized by excessive deposition and impaired degradation of collagen in dermis and subcutaneous tissues during the wound healing remodeling phase. Hypertrophic scarring can cause adverse cosmesis, loss of function, and strictures and adhesions following burns and abdominal surgery, as well as restriction of growth in children (1Brissett A.E. Sherris D.A. Facial Plast. Surg. 2001; 17: 263-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar).

Holmes T.M. Brosnan P. Ferguson M.W. Eur. J. Dermatol. 2001; 11: 424-431PubMed Google Scholar). Particularly, TGF-β1 is up-regulated in wound healing-related processes (3Roberts A.B. Sporn M.B. Assoian R.K. Smith M.J. Roche N.S. Wakefield L.M. Heine U.I. Liotta L.A. Falanga V. Kehrl J.H. Fauci A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 4167-4171Crossref PubMed Scopus (2386) Google Scholar) and contributes to fibroblast activation and transdifferentiation to myofibroblasts. Myofibroblasts show enhanced production of extracellular matrix and up-regulation of cytokine and cytoskeletal protein expression and are the major cell type contributing to excessive wound contraction in hypertrophic scars (4Berry D.P. Harding K.G. Stanton M.R. Jasani B. Ehrlich H.P. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1998; 102: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Smad proteins function as intracellular signaling mediators of TGF-β family members. Generally, they can be divided into receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads), common mediator Smads, and inhibitory Smads (5ten Dijke P. Hill C.S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2004; 29: 265-273Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). After ligand binding to a type II receptor, type II receptor kinases phosphorylate the GS domain of type I receptors. The activated type I receptor kinases phosphorylate R-Smads (Smad1, -2, -3, -5, and -8) differentially at two serine residues in the SSXS motif at their extreme C termini. Phosphorylated R-Smads form oligomeric complexes with Smad4. These complexes translocate into the nucleus and regulate transcription of target genes. Among the R-Smads, Smad3 is especially implicated in specific pathways of tissue repair (6Flanders K.C. Int. J. Exp. Pathol. 2004; 85: 47-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (507) Google Scholar). Inhibitory Smad7 acts to oppose signal transducing R- and common mediator Smads by forming stable associations with activated type I receptors, thus preventing phosphorylation of R-Smads (7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R. Itoh S. Kawabata N. Heldin N.E. Heldin C.H. Tendijke P. Nature. 1997; 389: 631-635Crossref PubMed Scopus (1534) Google Scholar). As a result of physiologic signal transduction by TGF-β, Smad7 expression is rapidly and transiently up-regulated in many cell types, thus acting as a negative feedback regulator (8Stopa M. Anhuf D.

Presently, there are only a few more or less successfully established therapies to treat hypertrophic scarring, including surgical excision, compression therapy, and local injection of corticosteroids. Experimental approaches to eliminate TGF-β effects were performed by applying cytokine-specific neutralizing antibodies during the early phase of wound healing and resulted in reduced scarring (9Shah M. Foreman D.M. Ferguson M.W. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 985-1002Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Additionally, experimental results referring to other fibroproliferative disorders indicate that gene therapeutic strategies targeting TGF-β might have potential to effectively prevent disease progression (10George J.

Takeshita A. Shimizu K. Ohashi H. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Some of these approaches have successfully used Smad7 to inhibit TGF-β family signaling, e.g. during bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis (13Nakao A. Fujii M. Matsumura R. Kumano K. Saito Y. Miyazono K. Iwamoto T. J. Clin. Investig. 1999; 104: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) or by targeting renal fibrosis in post-obstructive kidney disease (14Terada Y. Hanada S. Nakao A. Kuwahara M. Sasaki S. Marumo F. Kidney Int. 2002; 61: 94-98Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in an experimental model using bile duct ligation in rat, we were able to inhibit liver fibrogenesis by delivering Smad7 in a gene therapeutic approach (15Dooley S. Hamzavi J.

In this study, we examined Smad-dependent TGF-β1 signaling in primary cultured fibroblasts isolated from surgically excised hypertrophic scars (HF). We identified Smad3/Smad4 signaling as the predominant mediator of autocrine stimulation in HF. Further, overexpression of Smad7 abrogated intrinsic contraction and α1 (I) procollagen mRNA and α-smooth muscle actin (SMA) expression, indicating the potential for this inhibitory Smad to blunt excessive scarring in patients. Materials—Taq polymerase and [32P]dCTP were purchased from Amersham Biosciences. All reagents for cell culture (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM), fetal calf serum (FCS), trypsin-EDTA, and phosphate-buffered saline) were from Invitrogen or BIOCHROM (Berlin, Germany). Monoclonal anti-FLAG and anti-β-actin antibodies were obtained from Sigma (M5, F-4042). Oligonucleotides were from MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany) or Genset (Delaunay, France). The luciferase assay system was from Promega. Antisera for Smad2 and 3 were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc. (Berlin, Germany). The antibody for Smad7 was from Abcam, Cambridge, UK. Anti-phospho-Smad2 antiserum was from Cell Signaling Technology, New England Biolabs. Anti-phospho-Smad3 antiserum was kindly provided by P. ten Dijke, Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam. The anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. All other chemicals were obtained from commercial sources at the purest grade available. Cell Culture—Normal skin was harvested from patients undergoing plastic surgery procedures such as reduction mammaplasty or abdominoplasty. Hypertrophic scar tissue was obtained from plastic surgery scar corrections. Fibroblasts were isolated by using the explant culture technique as described elsewhere (16Weber L. Mauch C. Kirsch E. Muller P.K. Krieg T. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1986; 87: 217-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and grown in DMEM (glucose 1.0 g/liter, NaHCO3 3.7 g/liter, N-acetyl-l-alanyl-l-glutamine 1.0289 g/liter; BIOCHROM) supplemented with 10% FCS, 40 μg/ml gentamicin (Invitrogen) without additional growth factors in 75-cm2 culture flasks. All cultures were maintained at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in a humidified atmosphere. In case of 70–80% confluence, cells were subcultured or cryopreserved using 10% Me2SO. For adenoviral infection, fibroblasts were seeded in 58-cm2 Petri culture dishes (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany). Vectors and Gene Transfer—Adenoviral stocks for (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc were created using the Adeasy cloning and recombination procedure (Quantum, Appligene; www.quantum-appligene.com). Infections and coinfections of fibroblasts isolated from hypertrophic scars and normal skin were performed according to other reports (17Dooley S. Delvoux B. Streckert M. Bonzel L. Stopa M. ten Dijke P. Gressner A.M. FEBS Lett. 2001; 502: 4-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). Routine infections were accomplished with 2 × 105 HF or normal fibroblasts (NF) at 50 multiplicity of infection with single virus clones of the same virus stock preparation. Infection efficiency was proven by adenoviral constructs expressing β-galactosidase; each time, ∼90% of the cells were infected. Staining of infected cells was performed using an 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) staining kit (Roche Applied Science). After infection, cells were cultured for 1 day in DMEM containing 10% FCS and were then used for contraction testing in the collagen gel system. In parallel, part of the cells was used for molecular biology investigations. To perform luciferase assays, cells were cultured for 2 days in DMEM with 10% FCS and then infected with adenoviruses as indicated. Lysates for luciferase detection were prepared 24 h after adenoviral infections. Treatment with latency-associated peptide or anti-TGF-β1 antibody was performed 24 h after infection for 16 h. Adenoviral stocks for Smad7, Smad6, dominant negative Smad3 (ΔSmad3) and Smad4 (ΔSmad4), and LacZ were described previously (18Fujii M. Takeda K. Imamura T. Aoki H. Sampath T.K. Enomoto S. Kawabata M. Kato M. Ichijo H. Miyazono K. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 3801-3813Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar) and kindly provided by A. Moustakas, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Uppsala, Sweden. The adenovirus expressing a soluble Tβ RII (AdsTβ RII) was provided by R. Weiskirchen, Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, University Hospital, RWTH-Aachen (19Herrmann J. Abriss B. van de Leur E. Weiskirchen S. Gressner A.M. Weiskirchen R. Arch. Virol. 2004; 149: 1611-1617Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Collagen Lattice Contraction Model—To determine the contraction capacity of normal and pathological fibroblasts, a slightly modified in vitro contraction model was used as previously described (20Bell E. Ivarsson B. Merrill C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 1274-1278Crossref PubMed Scopus (1756) Google Scholar). In short, normal and hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts, infected and non-infected, were trypsinized (0.25%/1 mm EDTA; Invitrogen), centrifuged, and counted. 0.4 ml of minimal essential medium (10×) (Invitrogen) were added to 4 ml of collagen solution (4 mg/ml) (BIOCHROM). The resulting mixture was adjusted to pH 7.4 with 2 m NaOH. To achieve a final collagen cell solution containing 3 mg/ml collagen, 0.5 ml of the prepared cell suspension was added. With a final concentration of 4 × 105 fibroblasts/ml, the cell collagen mixture was provided in 12-well suspension culture plates (Greiner, Germany), 1 ml/well, 8 wells/plate. Plates were incubated for 1 h under standard conditions causing polymerization of collagen cell lattices. Finally, 2 ml of normal cell culture medium (DMEM + 10% FCS) were applied. After 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 h, plates were removed from the incubator and digital photos were obtained under standardized conditions to calculate the extent of gel contraction of each cell population investigated. Relative contraction ratio was calculated using the pixel calculation tool of Corel Photo Paint (Version 8; Corel Corp., Dublin, Ireland). Every experiment was performed 3-fold in 8-fold settings. Preparation of Total Cell Lysates, Nuclear Extracts, and Immunoblot Analysis—Total lysates from NF and HF, infected and non-infected, were prepared with 0.9 ml of radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (1 unit of Tris-buffered saline, 1% Nonidet P-40 (AMRESCO Inc., Solon, OH), 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). Protease inhibitors were provided as Protease Inhibitor mix (Roche Applied Science) just before use according to the manufacturer's instructions. To inhibit protein dephosphorylation, Phosphatase Inhibitor mix (Sigma) was added. Using a syringe fitted with a 21-gauge needle to shear DNA, lysates were transferred to a microcentrifuge tube. 10 μl of a 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride stock was added, followed by a 30–60-min incubation on ice. Subsequently, cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. 40 μl of lysates were separated by SDS-8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and transferred to a 0.45-μm nitrocellulose membrane (Protran BA 85; Schleicher & Schüll) for Western blot analysis as previously described (43Berg F. Delvoux B. Gao C. Westhoff J.H. Breitkopf K. Gressner A.M. Dooley S. Signal Transduct. 2002; 2: 11-18Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Isolation and Preparation of Total RNA and Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was purified from NF and HF monolayer cell cultures with an RNeasy mini kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (21Engel K. Plath K. Gaestel M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 336: 143-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) using 15–20 μg of total RNA to detect transcription products of α1 (I) procollagen. Generation of a probe from human cDNA specific for α1 chain of collagen type 1 was based on a clone termed HF677 described by Chu et al. (22Chu M.L. Myers J.C. Bernard M.P. Ding J.F. Ramirez F. Nucleic Acids Res. 1982; 10: 5925-5934Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), containing a 1.4-kb EcoRI fragment. Statistical Analysis—For statistical analysis of results obtained from lattice contraction experiments, GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software; Science Inc., San Diego, CA) version 3.02 was used by applying the two-tailed unpaired Student's t test with a p value for significance set at least at 0.05. Smad7 Inhibits Collagen Lattice Contraction Capacity in NF and HF—In hypertrophic scars, the capability of fibroblasts to contract extracellular matrix is excessively increased, leading to disfigurement and impaired range of physical motion. In vitro, fibroblasts are able to reorganize collagen into closely packed fibers and contract the resulting lattices, thereby proving their wound sealing phenotype. We used this system to evaluate the functional impact of TGF-β signaling on the contractile capability of HF and NF (Fig. 1). Where indicated, cells were infected with adenoviruses prior to suspension in a collagen matrix. Collagen lattice shrinkage in hypertrophic scar-derived fibroblasts (HFni) was stronger than in normal fibroblasts (NFni) ((0,393 ± 0,036), n = 8 versus (0,666 ± 0,149), n = 8; p = 0,0002). As a MOCK control, HF and NF were infected with LacZ. Calculated areas of MOCK-infected fibroblasts displayed no significant differences from those of non-infected cells (HFni versus HFLacZ, p = 0,058; NFni versus NFLacZ, p = 0,63). Smad7 overexpression in NF resulted in significantly reduced contraction of the lattices with regard to NFni ((0,793 ± 0,026), n = 8, versus (0,666 ± 0,149), n = 8, p = 0,0329) and to NFLacZ ((0,638 ± 0,074), n = 8, p = 0,0001). A similar effect of Smad7 was observed in HF, resulting in abridged shrinkage of collagen matrices in comparison to non-infected HF ((0,818 ± 0,018), n = 8, versus (0,393 ± 0,036), n = 8, p = 0,0001) or to HFLacZ ((0,4663 ± 0,094), n = 8, p = 0,0001). Results from collagen lattice experiments indicate that Smad7 induces a significant reduction of lattice shrinkage in both cell types. Overexpression of Smad7 may inhibit signal transduction of most TGF-β family members (e.g. TGF-βs, activins, and bone morphogenetic proteins), involving Smad2/3 or Smad1/5/8 complexes. To confirm participation of the TGF-β pathway in contraction-related processes, we expressed dominant negative forms of Smads3/4 (ΔSmad3/ΔSmad4). The presence of either ΔSmad4 or ΔSmad3 was sufficient to blunt contractile ability similar to Smad7 (Fig. 1). Intrinsic Smad3/Smad4-dependent Reporter Gene Activity Is Abrogated by Smad7 Expression in NF and HF—To evaluate TGF-β downstream signal transduction, HF and NF were infected with an adenovirus containing a strongly responsive (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc sequence, including nine copies of a PAI-1-specific TGF-β response element (23Dennler S. Itoh S. Vivien D. ten Dijke P. Huet S. Gauthier J.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3091-3100Crossref PubMed Scopus (1566) Google Scholar). Infection rates of both cell populations were ∼90%, as examined by microscopic galactosidase activity after Ad-Lacz infection (data not shown). Both cell populations show intrinsic stimulation of reporter gene activity, with total counts of luciferase activity being higher in HF compared with NF in all experiments (Fig. 2). Ectopic overexpression of Smad7 reduced autocrine-stimulated luciferase activity to basal levels in HF and NF. Inhibition of Endogenous (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc Activation by Smad7, sTβ RII, LAP, and Anti-TGF-β1 Antibody Implies Ligand-dependent Autocrine Stimulation in NF and HF—To further substantiate autocrine stimulation, cells were co-infected with Ad(CAGA)9-MLP-Luc and AdLacZ, adenovirus-expressing Smad7, or an adenovirus carrying a soluble TGF-β type II receptor (AdsTβ RII) as indicated in Fig. 3. Expression of sTβ RII decreased luciferase activity exactly like Smad7, pointing to autocrine stimulation of the cells and ligand dependence of the effect. To verify participation of TGF-β1, we treated the cells with latency-associated peptide (LAP) or with a monoclonal anti-TGF-β1 antibody and obtained the expected decrease in reporter gene activity in HF (Fig. 3A) and NF (Fig. 3B). HF Display Increased Expression and Phosphorylation of Smad3 Compared with NF—Phosphorylation of pathway-specific Smads2/3 is the first crucial step of intracellular TGF-β signal transduction. According to the findings of reporter gene analysis, HF and NF display endogenous phosphorylation of Smad3 and also Smad2. Expression and phosphorylation of Smad3 were strongly up-regulated in HF versus NF, whereas activation of Smad2 was similar in both cell populations (Fig. 4A). Further, inherent Smad3 phosphorylation in HF is significantly decreased by overexpression of Smad7 (Fig. 4B), indicating that Smad3 is involved in autocrine stimulation of contractility in HF and NF. Interestingly, although there is a significant Smad7 effect on Smad3 phosphorylation, Smad3 expression is not decreased. To investigate the possibility of differential expression of further TGF-β signaling intermediates besides Smad3, we compared endogenous expression of Smad4, Smad7, and Alk5 in NF versus HF using Western blot analysis. Smad4 and Alk5 were similarly represented in both cell types, whereas Smad7 was not expressed at the protein level in significant amounts (Fig. 4C). Smad7 Reduces α1 (I) Procollagen Expression in NF and HF—Expression of extracellular matrix proteins such as α1 (I) procollagen is essential for wound healing in damaged tissue, whereas scar formation represents a state wherein this protein is deposited in excess amounts (24Clark R.A. Am. J. Med. Sci. 1993; 306: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Consistent with this assumption, HF express higher levels of α1 (I) procollagen mRNA compared with NF. Overexpression of Smad7 significantly blunted α1 (I) procollagen mRNA expression, indicating involvement of TGF-β signaling in scar-dependent collagen expression (Fig. 5). Smad7, but Not Smad6, Causes Down-regulation of α-SMA Expression in HF—α-Smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) expression is necessary for the ability of fibroblasts to contract and therefore is overexpressed in contractile fibroblasts of hypertrophic scars (4Berry D.P. Harding K.G. Stanton M.R. Jasani B. Ehrlich H.P. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1998; 102: 124-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar), resembling the main effector of wound contraction. Cell lysates from 12 different NF and HF samples were analyzed for α-SMA staining in Western blots, indicating that HF display significantly increased expression compared with NF (Fig. 6A). Using adenoviruses as described below, we overexpressed Smad7 or Smad6 in five different preparations of NF and HF. Smad7, but not Smad6, efficiently blunted up-regulated α-SMA expression in HF, indicating that TGF-β, but not bone morphogenetic protein, signaling participates in hypertrophic scar-derived α-SMA protein expression (Fig. 6B). The TGF-β superfamily consists of multifunctional proteins involved in cell growth, differentiation, and tissue repair (25Moustakas A. Souchelnytskyi S. Heldin C.H. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 4359-4369Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through its regulatory role in wound healing and scar formation, TGF-β has crucial functions (26Ashcroft G.S. Roberts A.B. Cytokine Growth Factor Rev. 2000; 11: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and may induce the expression of extracellular matrix-related genes such as collagen and fibronectin as well as α-SMA, which is the major marker protein for transdifferentiated myofibroblasts (27Schmid P. Itin P. Cherry G. Bi C. Cox D.A. Am. J. Pathol. 1998; 152: 485-493PubMed Google Scholar). Deep injury of the skin by trauma or surgery initiates TGF-β expression in wounded tissues, especially in fibroblasts. In case of burn injury, levels of newly produced TGF-β may even be detected in serum and related to the extent of trauma (28Tredget E.E. Shankowsky H.A. Pannu R. Nedelec B. Iwashina T. Ghahary A. Taerum T.V. Scott P.G. Plast. Reconstr. Surg. 1998; 102: 1317-1330Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Prolonged or impaired healing can lead to unbalanced TGF-β activity and excessive scarring. Recently, several studies have shown that strategies targeted to abrogate TGF-β signaling are promising for treatment of fibroproliferative disorders of, among others, liver, lung, and kidney (12Ueno H. Sakamoto T. Nakamura T. Qi Z. Astuchi N. Takeshita A. Shimizu K. Ohashi H. Hum. Gene Ther. 2000; 11: 33-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar, 13Nakao A. Fujii M. Matsumura R. Kumano K.

Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1535-1548Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Therefore, several more or less specific anti-TGF-β approaches comprising dominant negative TGF-β receptors (TβR), TGF-β-binding proteins like decorin, antagonistic cytokines such as bone morphogenetic protein-7, hepatocyte growth factor, interleukin-10, Ifn-γ, or anti-TGF-β1 antibodies were applied (30Gressner A.M. Weiskirchen R. J. Hepatol. 2003; 39: 856-859Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Inhibitory Smad7 was recently identified to antagonize TGF-β in vitro and in vivo by degrading activated receptor complexes (7Nakao A. Afrakhte M. Moren A. Nakayama T. Christian J.L. Heuchel R.

We and others have used overexpression of Smad7 to inhibit profibrogenic TGF-β effects in vivo (13Nakao A. Fujii M. Matsumura R. Kumano K. Saito Y. Miyazono K. Iwamoto T. J. Clin.

In skin, usage of latency-associated peptide, a naturally occurring antagonist of TGF-β, prevented skin thickening and fibrosis in murine sclerodermatous graft versus host disease, a model for human scleroderma (32Zhang Y. McCormick L.L. Gilliam A.C. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2003; 121: 713-719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). As a result of treatment, up-regulation of cutaneous TGF-β1 and connective tissue growth factor mRNA and Col1 synthesis was abrogated. Additionally, a synthetic TGF-β peptide antagonist was successfully used to reduce contraction and scarring, thereby accelerating wound re-epithelialization in pig skin burn/excision and rabbit skin excision wound models (33Huang J.S. Wang Y.H. Ling T.Y. Chuang S.S. Johnson F.E. Huang S.S. FASEB J. 2002; 16: 1269-1270Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). Similar data were reported for an anti TGF-β1,2 antibody that was able to reduce scarring in rat incision wounds (34Shah M. Foreman D.M. Ferguson M.W.J. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1137-1157Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our approach, we overexpressed Smad7 in fibroblasts purified from normal or hypertrophic scar tissue and tested its effect on collagen lattice contraction. Smad7 completely abrogated contraction ability of normal and scar-derived fibroblasts (NF versus HF), indicating participation of TGF-β signaling in this process. To confirm the presence of autocrine TGF-β stimulation in NF and HF several lines of investigation were pursued, and the results were all in line with this assumption. Overexpression of Smad7 and soluble TGF-β receptor type II as well as treatment with latency-associated peptide or a monoclonal anti-TGF-β1 antibody decreased intrinsic (CAGA)9-MLP-Luc activity significantly in both cell types. Furthermore, usage of anti-TGF-β1 antibody to neutralize TGF-β1, like Smad7, completely inhibited collagen gel contraction, pointing to TGF-β1 as responsible mediator (data not shown). This was further strengthened by the presence of significant amounts of TGF-β1 mRNA. Interestingly, TGF-β3 was also pronouncedly expressed in NF and HF, 2L. Wickert, K. Breitkopf, J. Kopp, and S. Dooley, unpublished observation. and a more detailed analysis of its role in skin fibroblasts seems to be advisable. A similar inhibitory effect of Smad7, ΔSmad3, and ΔSmad4 on contractility suggests Smad dependence of autocrine stimulation. A detailed analysis of Smad expression and phosphorylation revealed that Smad3 expression and intrinsic Smad3 phosphorylation were increased in HF versus NF, indicating a prominent role of Smad3 in hypertrophic scarring. In line with this, studies with Smad3 knock-out mice revealed that cutaneous wounds displayed decreased wound widths, enhanced epithelialization, and reduced numbers of neutrophils and myofibroblasts 6 weeks after irradiation compared with wild type littermates (35Flanders K.C. Major C.D. Arabshahi A. Aburime E.E. Okada M.H. Fujii M. Blalock T.D. Schultz G.S. Sowers A. Anzano M.A. Mitchell J.B. Russo A. Roberts A.B. Am. J. Pathol. 2003; 163: 2247-2257Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Moreover, it is concluded that Smad3 contributes to heightened scarring and that attenuation of Smad3 signaling might improve wound healing. Additionally, Liu et al. (44Liu X. Wen F.Q. Kobayashi T. Abe S. Fang Q. Piek E. Boettinger E.P. Roberts A.B. Rennard S.I. Cell Motil. Cytoskeleton. 2003; 54: 248-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) reported that Smad3, but not Smad2, is critical for TGF-β-induced contraction of type I collagen gels. In this study, murine embryo fibroblasts from Smad2 and Smad3 wild type and knock-out mice were cast into native type I collagen gels and treated with all three isoforms of TGF-β. A significantly augmented contraction of the gels was obtained with all genotypes, except for Smad3 knock-out cells. Further investigations approving an outstanding role for Smad3 in wound healing processes like repair of cutaneous wounds (36Ashcroft G.S. Yang X. Glick A.B. Weinstein M. Letterio J.J. Mizel D.E.

Shi W. Wang Y.L. Chen H. Bringas Jr., P. Datto M.B. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Warburton D. Am. J. Physiol. 2002; 282: L585-L593Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar), and activation of hepatic stellate cells and liver fibrosis in mice (38Schnabl B. Kweon Y.O. Frederick J.P. Wang X.F. Rippe R.A. Brenner D.A. Hepatology. 2001; 34: 89-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) have been reported previously. In many cell types, TGF-β signaling induces Smad7 expression (39Afrakhte M. Moren A. Jossan S. Itoh S. Sampath K. Westermark B. Heldin C.H. Heldin N.E. ten Dijke P. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1998; 249: 505-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). On the other hand, this pathway is frequently off in chronic diseases that are driven by permanent autocrine stimulation (40Dooley S. Delvoux B. Lahme B. Mangasser-Stephan K. Gressner A.M. Hepatology. 2000; 31: 1094-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). According to this, Smad7 is not expressed in NF and HF. Because the process of wound healing with subsequent hypertrophic scar formation includes wound contraction, angiogenesis, re-epithelialization, and intercellular matrix formation, the capacity of fibroblasts to express function-related proteins such as type I collagen and α-SMA is fundamental (41Martin P. Hopkinson-Woolley J. McCluskey J. Prog. Growth Factor Res. 1992; 4: 25-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). Here, we have shown that expression and function of extracellular matrix proteins in NF and HF are at least partially regulated by TGF-β. In activated fibroblasts from hypertrophic scars, α1 type I procollagen mRNA and α-SMA protein expression are intrinsically elevated. Smad7 expression blunted autocrine TGF-β effects related to expression of these target genes. Increased TGF-β-dependent expression of α-SMA and ColI was also reported for keloid-derived human dermal fibroblasts when compared with normal controls (42Hasegawa T. Nakao A. Sumiyoshi K. Tsuboi R. Ogawa H. J. Dermatol. Sci. 2003; 32: 19-24Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In summary, our data suggest that fibroproliferative features of normal fibroblasts and fibroblasts during hypertrophic scar formation are induced and regulated by TGF-β. Intrinsic Smad3/4 signaling is thus most important for contractility of NF and HF. However, Smad-independent pathways may also contribute to the regulation of α-SMA and collagen expression in these cells. Smad7 is capable of abrogating TGF-β signaling, resulting in decreased expression of intra- and extracellular fibrogenic proteins and cellular contractility. Recently, we were able to demonstrate a beneficial effect of Smad7 on fibrotic progression in vivo in a rat bile duct ligation model of liver fibrosis (15Dooley S. Hamzavi J. Breitkopf K. Wiercinska E. Said H.M. Lorenzen J. ten Dijke P. Gressner A.M. Gastroenterology. 2003; 125: 178-191Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). We therefore expect that the in vivo application of Smad7 may be a useful approach to establish a gene therapeutic strategy for the treatment of hypertrophic scarring and other fibroproliferative disorders of the skin."

Two RNA-binding proteins, CUGBP1 and calreticulin, have been implicated in the translational regulation of C/EBPβ. In this paper, we present evidence showing several critical steps by which liver increases translation of LIP after partial hepatectomy. At early stages after partial hepatectomy, liver activates CUGBP1 by a hyperphosphorylation. The activated CUGBP1 binds to the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA and replaces calreticulin, which partially represses translation of C/EBPβ in quiescent livers. The hyperphosphorylated CUGBP1 also interacts with the α and β subunits of initiation factor eIF2. Our data demonstrate that the interaction of CUGBP1 with the eIF2α enhances the association of CUGBP1 with ribosomes and correlates with increased translation of LIP in the liver after partial hepatectomy. Our data support the hypothesis that CUGBP1 increases translation of LIP by the interaction with the eIF2α subunit.

A number of recent studies have demonstrated that the protein expression of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ is controlled on different levels, including transcription and translation of mRNAs and regulation of protein stability (5Perrotti D. Cesi V. Trotta R. Guerzoni C. Santilli G. Campbell K. Iervolino A. Condorelli E. Gambacorti-Passerini C. Caligiuri M.A. Calabretta B. Nat.

Single mRNAs of C/EBPα and C/EBPβ produce different isoforms through the use of alternative translation start sites from several in-frame AUG codons (8Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar, 9An M.R. Hsieh C.C. Reisner P.D. Rabek J.P. Scott S.G. Kuninger D.T. Papaconstantinou J. Mol. Cell.

The truncated isoforms of C/EBPα and -β (30 kDa and LIP, respectively) lack one of activation domains and have reduced capacities to regulate transcription. However, these isoforms are able to dimerize with full-length C/EBP proteins and inhibit their transcriptional activities. Since expression of these isoforms is increased in many biological processes including breast tumors (12Zahnow C.A. Cardiff R.D. Laucirica R. Medina D. Rosen J.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 261-269PubMed Google Scholar), the elucidation of mechanisms by which cells generate these isoforms may be helpful in the development of therapeutic approaches. The truncated isoform of C/EBPβ, LIP, has been shown to function as a dominant negative molecule that heterodimerizes with full-length C/EBP proteins and blocks their activities (8Descombes P. Schibler U. Cell. 1991; 67: 569-579Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (862) Google Scholar). Experiments in cultured cells suggested that LIP might also have biological activities distinct from the full-length C/EBP proteins (12Zahnow C.A. Cardiff R.D. Laucirica R. Medina D. Rosen J.M. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 261-269PubMed Google Scholar). Since both LAP and LIP isoforms are translated from the same mRNA, the elucidation of the role of each isoform in the liver proliferation is difficult. Luedde et al. (13Luedde T. Duderstadt M. Streetz K.L. Tacke F. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 2004; 2: 356-365Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar) have recently performed studies using adenovirus-mediated delivery of LAP and LIP in the liver following initiation of proliferation by partial hepatectomy. These studies showed that LAP and LIP have different functions in liver proliferation. Overexpression of LAP led to a delayed S-phase entry of hepatocytes after partial hepatectomy (PH), whereas overexpression of LIP resulted in earlier induction of cyclin A, cyclin E, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (13Luedde T. Duderstadt M. Streetz K.L. Tacke F. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 2004; 2: 356-365Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Since LIP promotes liver proliferation, understanding the molecular mechanisms by which the liver increases LIP translation is very important. Several studies have been undertaken to elucidate the mechanism of LIP translation. It has been found that the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA contains a short out-of-frame open reading frame (sORF; also known as an upstream open reading frame, or uORF), which is involved in the regulation of LIP translation (14Calkhoven G.F. Bouwman P.R.J. Snippe L. Geert A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5540-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 15Calkhoven G. Müller C. Leutz A. Gen. Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar). A number of investigations showed that translation of LIP from the third AUG codon is mediated by a “leaky scanning” mechanism. This mechanism suggests that a portion of ribosomes initiates translation at the AUG codon of the sORF, synthesizes 9-amino acid peptide, reaches the stop codon of the sORF, and dissociates. Since there is a very close proximity of the stop codon of sORF and the initiating AUG codon of LAP, the ribosomes are not able to start translation of LAP and continue scanning until they meet the third (LIP-specific) AUG codon (14Calkhoven G.F. Bouwman P.R.J. Snippe L. Geert A.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 5540-5547Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Translational control of LIP production has been further confirmed by examination of effects of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2α (eIF2α) on C/EBPβ expression. Calkhoven et al. (15Calkhoven G. Müller C. Leutz A. Gen. Dev. 2000; 14: 1920-1932PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a high eIF2α activity shifts the ratio of LAP/LIP toward a more truncated isoform, LIP. Investigations of molecular mechanisms that control the initiation of translation on the sORF-specific AUG codon suggested that certain RNA-binding proteins might regulate this process by interacting with the sORF region of C/EBPβ mRNA (6Timchenko L.T. Iakova P. Welm A.L. Cai Z.-C. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7242-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T.

Chem. 2000; 275: 27406-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have identified two RNA-binding proteins, CUGBP1 and CRT, which specifically bind to the sORF (6Timchenko L.T. Iakova P. Welm A.L. Cai Z.-C. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7242-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 17Welm A.L. Mackey S.L. Timchenko L.T. Darlington J.G. Timchenko N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27406-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CRT has been shown to interact with GC-rich stem-loop structures and might regulate processing of corresponding RNAs (18Atreaya C.D. Singh N.K. Nakashi H.J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 3848-3851Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 19Pugachev K. Frey T. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 641-650Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 20Singh N.K. Atreya C.D. Nakashi H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12770-12774Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Although CUGBP1 and CRT interact with the same sequence of the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA, the consequences of these interactions are different. CRT binds to the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA and stabilizes a stem-loop (SL) structure, leading to the inhibition of translation of C/EBPβ (6Timchenko L.T. Iakova P. Welm A.L. Cai Z.-C. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7242-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). On the contrary, the interaction of CUGBP1 with the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA increases translation of C/EBPβ (17Welm A.L. Mackey S.L. Timchenko L.T. Darlington J.G. Timchenko N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27406-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this paper, we examined the detailed molecular mechanisms by which liver increases translation of LIP after PH. Our data suggest the following pathway. In quiescent livers, the expression of LIP is limited by a negative effect of CRT, which is associated with the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA. Partial hepatectomy activates CUGBP1 by phosphorylation, and the phosphorylated CUGBP1 interacts with the α and β subunits of eIF2. The CUGBP1-eIF2 complex binds to the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA and replaces CRT leading to recruitment of a larger number of ribosomes to initiate translation of the sORF. These additional ribosomes skip the LAP-specific AUG codon and start initiation of LIP translation at the third AUG codon. As a result, more ribosomes meet the LIP-specific AUG codon, and the translation of LIP is increased in regenerating livers. Given growth promotion activity of LIP (13Luedde T. Duderstadt M. Streetz K.L. Tacke F. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 2004; 2: 356-365Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar), these data present a novel pathway by which RNA-binding proteins contribute to liver proliferation. Liver Regeneration and LPS Treatment—Partial hepatectomy and LPS treatment were performed as described in our previous publications (16Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 21Iakova P. Awad S. Timchenko N.A. Cell. 2003; 113: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Procedures for the isolation of protein extracts were described in our earlier papers (6Timchenko L.T.

Cell. 2003; 113: 495-506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Western Analysis—Protein extracts (50–100 μg) were separated by 4–20% polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis and transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane. C/EBPβ, CUGBP1, CRT, eIF2α, eIF2β, eIF2γ, and eIF4E antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) were used in dilutions recommended in the manufacturer's protocol. To verify protein loading, membranes were stripped and reprobed with monoclonal antibodies against β-actin (Sigma) (1:1,000) and stained with Coomassie Blue. UV Cross-linking Assay—UV cross-linking was performed as described (6Timchenko L.T. Iakova P. Welm A.L. Cai Z.-C. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7242-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Iakova P. Wang G.L. Timchenko L.T. Michalak M. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Timchenko N.A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) was labeled with T4 kinase and [γ-32P]ATP. MBP-CUGBP1 (0.1 μg) or cytoplasmic proteins (20 μg) were incubated with radioactive riboprobe, linked to the probe by UV irradiation, separated by SDS-gel electrophoresis, transferred on membrane, and exposed to x-ray film. After exposure, the membrane was stained with Coomassie Blue to verify protein loading. Two-dimensional Gel Electrophoresis—Proteins (150–200 μg) were separated by isoelectric focusing using pH 3.0–10.0 strips followed by 5–20% gradient polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Bio-Rad). Proteins were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane and probed with monoclonal antibodies against CUGBP1 (3B1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Transfections—HeLa cells were used for the analysis of C/EBPβ regulation by RNA binding proteins. FLAG-tagged C/EBPβ construct (23Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was co-transfected with His-CRT and GFP-CUGBP1 in different ratios. Proteins were isolated in 16 h after transfections and analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to FLAG, His, and CUGBP1 as described above. For the analysis of intracellular localization of CUGBP1 and its RNA binding domains (RBDs), HeLa cells were transfected with GFP-CUGBP1, GFP-RBD1, and GFP-RBD3 using FuGene (Invitrogen). Subcellular fractionations and Western analysis were performed as described below. Isolation of CUGBP1-interacting Proteins—MBP-CUGBP1 was induced in Escherichia coli with isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and then loaded on amylose resin. Cytoplasmic proteins from HeLa cells (10 mg) were incubated with the amylose resin containing MBP-CUGBP1. The column was washed extensively with phosphate-buffered saline buffer, and CUGBP1-binding proteins were eluted with 0.5 m NaCl. Eluted proteins were analyzed by 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie Blue. For protein sequencing, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and stained with Coomassie Blue. Protein bands were cut out from the membrane and sequenced in the Baylor College of Medicine Protein Sequencing Core. Examination of RNA-Protein and Protein-Protein Complexes by Size Exclusion Chromatography—Cytoplasmic proteins from HeLa cells and from mouse liver were separated by HPLC chromatography (DuoFlow; Bio-Rad) using SEC-400 column. Size exclusion runs were performed with the buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 100 mm NaCl, and 5 mm dithiothreitol. Size exclusion fractions were analyzed by Western blotting with antibodies to CUGBP1, eIF2α, and eIF2β. To detect protein-protein complexes, CUGBP1 was immunoprecipitated from each fraction, and the α and β subunits of eIF2 were examined in CUGBP1 immunoprecipitations. To examine the role of RNA in the formation of CUGBP1-eIF2α-eIF2β complexes, cytoplasmic proteins were pretreated with RNase A prior to chromatography. The size exclusion fractions were examined as described above. Isolation of Polysomes—A detailed procedure for the analysis of polysomal fractions is described in our previous paper (22Iakova P. Wang G.L. Timchenko L.T. Michalak M. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Timchenko N.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were homogenized with polysomal buffer containing 25 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 25% sucrose. Nuclei and mitochondria were spun down by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 45 min. Supernatant (cytoplasm) was treated with 1% Triton X-100 and 0.5% sodium deoxycholate for 2 h and centrifuged through 1.0 m sucrose prepared in polysomal buffer. The pellet (which contained a mixture of polysomes and individual 40 and 60 S ribosomal subunits) was resuspended in polysomal buffer and used for Western blotting. The Increase of LIP in Regenerating Mouse Livers Correlates with the Elevation of CUGBP1 RNA Binding Activity—Transcription factor C/EBPβ plays an important role in liver proliferation after partial hepatectomy (2Poli V. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 29279-29282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar). It has been recently shown that LAP and LIP isoforms have distinct functions in liver proliferation; whereas LAP regulates timing of cell cycle stages, LIP is required for the induction of cyclins (13Luedde T. Duderstadt M. Streetz K.L. Tacke F. Kubicka S. Manns M.P. Trautwein C. Hepatology. 2004; 2: 356-365Crossref Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Although C/EBPβ mRNA is increased in liver after PH and this induction contributes to elevation of LAP, the subsequent translation of LIP requires a coordinated cascade of molecular events that direct ribosomes to the third (LIP-specific) AUG codon of the C/EBPβ mRNA. In this paper, we investigated the CUGBP1-dependent mechanism of LIP induction in mouse regenerating livers. Our previous work with rats demonstrated that LIP is increased in rat livers after PH (16Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Therefore, we first examined expression of LIP and CUGBP1 after partial hepatectomy in our experimental mice. Since we have previously shown that CUGBP1 activates LIP in mouse livers during acute phase response (APR) (17Welm A.L. Mackey S.L. Timchenko L.T. Darlington J.G. Timchenko N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27406-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), this model was used as the control in parallel experiments. Western blotting with antibodies to C/EBPβ is shown in Fig. 1A. In agreement with published observations, expression of both LAP and LIP is increased in mouse liver at 4 and 8 h after PH as well as in livers during early stages of LPS-mediated APR. To elucidate mechanisms by which liver increases translation of LIP, we focused our studies on RNA-binding proteins that might contribute to the induction of LIP during this short time period, 4–8 h after PH. We have previously found that two RNA-binding proteins, CRT and CUGBP1, bind to the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA and might regulate translation of LIP. CRT and CUGBP1 levels were analyzed by Western blot analysis. As can be seen in Fig. 1B, protein levels of CUGBP1 are not altered in regenerating liver or in liver during APR (Fig. 1B). Similar examination of CRT protein levels showed that the levels of this protein declined after PH and during APR (Fig. 1B). Densitometric analysis of CRT levels (relative to β-actin) revealed 2.5–3.5-fold reduction in regenerating livers. Since RNA binding activity of CUGBP1 is also regulated by posttranslational modifications (22Iakova P. Wang G.L. Timchenko L.T. Michalak M. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Timchenko N.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), we then analyzed the binding activity of CRT and CUGBP1 in mouse liver after PH and APR. For this goal, we used a UV cross-linking assay with the sORF probe (located in the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA; see Ref. 17Welm A.L. Mackey S.L. Timchenko L.T. Darlington J.G. Timchenko N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27406-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar and Fig. 1D), which binds to both CRT and CUGBP1. The sORF probe was incubated with cytoplasmic extracts and cross-linked to proteins by UV irradiation, and CRT and CUGBP1 were immunoprecipitated with specific antibodies. As can be seen in Fig. 1C, binding of CUGBP1 to C/EBPβ mRNA is increased in response to PH and APR at the time points where LIP levels are elevated (Fig. 1A). On the contrary, interactions of CRT with the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA are reduced after PH and during APR consistently with decline of CRT protein levels. These patterns of binding are consistent with the roles played by CRT and CUGBP1 in the regulation of C/EBPβ translation (6Timchenko L.T. Iakova P. Welm A.L. Cai Z.-C. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7242-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that the proliferating liver increases translation of LIP via an increase of CUGBP1 binding activity and through the elimination of negative effects of CRT. Therefore, we performed further studies to 1) determine whether CRT and CUGBP1 might compete for the regulation of C/EBPβ translation, 2) determine how liver activates CUGBP1 after PH, and 3) elucidate molecular mechanisms of CUGBP1-mediated induction of LIP translation. CUGBP1 and CRT Compete for the Regulation of C/EBPβ— Given the reduction of CRT after PH and our previous data showing that CRT inhibits translation of C/EBPβ (6Timchenko L.T. Iakova P. Welm A.L. Cai Z.-C. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7242-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), we tested whether CRT and CUGBP1 compete for the interaction with the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA. We have previously mapped the CUGBP1 binding site within the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA between the AUG codon of the sORF and the AUG codon for LAP (Fig. 1D). The sORF contains a GC-rich sequence that might form an SL, to which CRT binds (16Timchenko N.A. Welm A.L. Lu X. Timchenko L.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4517-4525Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 17Welm A.L. Mackey S.L. Timchenko L.T. Darlington J.G. Timchenko N.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27406-27413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Since CUGBP1 binds to the single-stranded sORF RNA, but CRT interacts with the stem-loop structure of the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA (Fig. 1D; see Ref. 6Timchenko L.T. Iakova P. Welm A.L. Cai Z.-C. Timchenko N.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7242-7257Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), this suggests that CUGBP1 and CRT may compete for the interaction with C/EBPβ mRNA and for the regulation of its translation. To examine this hypothesis, UV cross-linking was performed with bacterially expressed His-CRT and GFP-CUGBP1 under conditions of a 2–4-fold molar excess of these proteins to the sORF probe. Fig. 1E shows the result of a UV cross-linking-Western blotting experiment. When CRT is added to the binding reactions with CUGBP1, it replaces CUGBP1 from the C/EBPβ mRNA. To verify the amounts of CRT and CUGBP1 in the binding reactions, the membrane was probed with antibodies to CRT and to CUGBP1. As can be seen, when both proteins are present in the binding reactions (lanes 2 and 3), CRT blocks the interaction of CUGBP1 with the 5′ region of C/EBPβ. This in vitro result suggested that CRT and CUGBP1 might compete in vivo for the regulation of C/EBPβ mRNA. To test whether CRT and CUGBP1 compete for the regulation of translation of C/EBPβ mRNA, C/EBPβ mRNA (C/EBPβ is linked to the FLAG tag (23Welm A.L. Timchenko N.A. Darlington G.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 1695-1704Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)) was co-transfected into HeLa cells with His-CRT and GFP-CUGBP1 at different molar ratios. As can be seen in Fig. 1F, overexpression of CRT inhibits translation of C/EBPβ. However, when GFP-CUGBP1 is expressed to the levels that overcome those of CRT (ratio of plasmids CUGBP1/CRT is 4:1), translation of C/EBPβ is returned to high levels. Since these studies were performed with a co-transfection approach, the contribution of the endogenous CUGBP1 and CRT appears to be minor. Although levels of GFP-CUGBP1 and endogenous 51-kDa CUGBP1 are similar by Western blotting (Fig. 1F), we have obtained 25% efficiency of transfections, suggesting that each transfected cell contains 3–4-fold higher levels of CUGBP1 than cells transfected with His-CRT only. Thus, these data demonstrate that the CRT and CUGBP1 compete for the interaction with the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA and for the regulation of translation of C/EBPβ mRNA. Since the binding of CUGBP1 to the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA is increased in liver after PH, we suggested that the first step in the initiation of LIP translation after PH is the release of the inhibitory activity of CRT. Translation of LIP Is Increased in Cells Lacking CRT—To further examine the role of competition of CRT and CUGBP1 in the regulation of C/EBPβ mRNA under appropriate biological concentrations and environment, we utilized CRT –/– mouse embryo fibroblasts (22Iakova P. Wang G.L. Timchenko L.T. Michalak M. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Timchenko N.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Western blotting with antibodies to C/EBPβ shows that the expression of both LAP and LIP is increased in cells lacking CRT (Fig. 2A). Densitometric calculations of the levels of LAP and LIP showed that the induction of LIP expression is much higher than the induction of LAP in CRT–/– cells (Fig. 2A, bar graphs). To further examine whether CUGBP1 is involved in the induction of LIP translation in CRT –/– cells, cytoplasm was separated into a polysomal fraction (PS) and a polysome-free fraction (PS-free), and CUGBP1 and CRT were detected by Western blotting with corresponding antibodies. Experimental details for the fractionation of cytoplasm and for examination of polysomal fractions are published in our previous paper (22Iakova P. Wang G.L. Timchenko L.T. Michalak M. Pereira-Smith O.M. Smith J.R. Timchenko N.A. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 406-417Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Western blotting shows that both CRT and CUGBP1 are observed on polysomes isolated from wild type cells (Fig. 2B). The Western blotting analysis of CUGBP1 on polysomes of CRT–/– cells showed that the lack of CRT correlates with a slight increase of CUGBP1 in polysomal fractions. To further determine the association of CUGBP1 with polysomes in CRT–/– cells, we utilized a UV cross-linking assay with the sORF probe. Since both CUGBP1 and CRT bind to the sORF probe, we immunoprecipitated these proteins from the binding reactions after UV treatment and loaded on denaturing PAGE. This examination confirmed that CUGBP1 is increased on polysomes of CRT–/– cells (Fig. 2C). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that CRT and CUGBP1 compete for the regulation of C/EBPβ mRNA translation and with the hypothesis that the induction of LIP in the liver after PH might be caused by both the release of CRT-mediated inhibition and activation of CUGBP1. Fig. 2D shows a hypothetical competitive regulation of C/EBPβ by CRT and CUGBP1. Since CRT binds to GC-rich stems, we suggest that CRT stabilizes the SL structure within the 5′ region of C/EBPβ mRNA and partially represses translation. When CUGBP1 is expressed to the levels that overcome those of CRT, it replaces CRT and releases the negative regulation. Partial Hepatectomy Causes Hyperphosphorylation of CUGBP1 and Accumulation of the Hyperphosphorylated CUGBP1 on Polysomes—We further performed a detailed investigation of the mechanisms responsible for activation of CUGBP1 after partial hepatectomy. Since protein levels of CUGBP1 do not correlate with induction of CUGBP1 binding activity, we examined if phosphorylation of CUGBP1 might be involved in its activation after PH. For this goal, we tested the phosphorylation status of CUGBP1 in the cytoplasm of both quiescent livers and livers after PH by using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Fig. 3A shows that, in quiescent livers, CUGBP1 exists as four or five isoforms and that hypophosphorylated forms of CUGBP1 (isoforms 3–5) are the major forms. After PH, the amount of the hyperphosphorylated form of CUGBP1 (marked 1, located in the acidic region) is dramatically increased. This isoform of CUGBP1 represents hyperphosphorylated protein, because it is shifted to a more alkaline region by the CIP treatment (Fig. 3A). We have observed that the treatment of CUGBP1 by CIP also leads to a reduced sensitivity of the two-dimensional Western blotting assay. We suggest that this difference might be due to a better interaction of a"

We investigated the modification of Lys6 of ubiquitin and its physiological consequences. Mass spectrometry-based peptide mapping and N-terminal sequencing demonstrated that, of the 7 Lys residues in ubiquitin, Lys6 was the most readily labeled with sulfosuccinimidobiotin. Lys6-biotinylated ubiquitin was incorporated into high molecular mass ubiquitin conjugates as efficiently as unmodified ubiquitin. However, Lys6-biotinylated ubiquitin inhibited ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, as conjugates formed with Lys6-biotinylated ubiquitin were resistant to proteasomal degradation. Ubiquitins with a mutation of Lys6 had similar phenotypes as Lys6-biotinylated ubiquitin. Lys6 mutant ubiquitins (K6A, K6R, and K6W) also inhibited ATP-dependent proteolysis and caused accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates. Conjugates formed with K6W mutant ubiquitin were also resistant to proteasomal degradation. The dominant-negative effect of Lys6-modified ubiquitin was further demonstrated in intact cells. Overexpression of K6W mutant ubiquitin resulted in accumulation of intracellular ubiquitin conjugates, stabilization of typical substrates for ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis, and enhanced susceptibility to oxidative stress. Taken together, these results show that Lys6-modified ubiquitin is a potent and specific inhibitor of ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation.

In this essential pathway, the conserved ubiquitin acts as a degradation signal upon covalent linkage of multiple ubiquitins to cellular substrates. This is accomplished through the formation of an isopeptide bond between the C terminus of ubiquitin (Gly76) and an internal lysine residue of the substrate. Formation of the ubiquitin-substrate conjugates is usually followed by additional rounds of conjugation of more ubiquitins to the initial adduct, also via isopeptide bonds, leading to the assembly of long polyubiquitin chains.

Polyubiquitin chains linked through lysine residues other than Lys48 have functions principally independent of targeting proteins for degradation, such as DNA repair and signal transduction (8Spence J.

The 26 S proteasome specifically degrades ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, and it is assembled from a 20 S catalytic core and two 19 S regulatory complexes (also called PA700) that cap the entry to the cylindrical catalytic core (15Hoffman L.

It is the 19 S regulatory complex that recruits ubiquitin-protein conjugates to the 26 S proteasome and translocates the ubiquitinated proteins into the catalytic cavity. It has been demonstrated that S5a (also called MBP1 and Mcb1p), the ATPase S6′ subunit of the 19 S regulatory complex, and Rad23, a proteasome-associated protein, can each bind polyubiquitin chains (6Baboshina O.V.

The 19 S regulatory complex also has deubiquitinating activity, which removes ubiquitin from the substrate prior to or coordinated with degradation of the substrate proteins. Such deubiquitination may serve both in degradation and in proofreading or editing functions (24Lam Y.A. Xu W. DeMartino G.N. Cohen R.E. Nature. 1997; 385: 737-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar, 25Lam Y.A. DeMartino G.N. Pickart C.M. Cohen R.E. J. Biol.

Biotinylated ubiquitin has been used as a probe to study the function of the UPP (27Corsi D. Galluzzi L. Crinelli R. Magnani M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 8928-8935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). However, biotinylated ubiquitin has not been characterized in detail, and the potential kinetic artifacts of biotinylated ubiquitin have not been assessed. In most cases, Lys residues are modified by biotinylating reagents such as sulfosuccinimidobiotin (sulfo-NHS-biotin). Some of the 7 Lys residues in ubiquitin are essential for formation of polyubiquitin chains. Modification of 1 or more of the critical Lys residues may abolish the ability of ubiquitin to form polyubiquitin chains. Modifications of some Lys residues may also alter the surface property of ubiquitin chains and may interfere with the interaction between ubiquitin conjugates and the proteasome. Previous studies indicated that Lys6 is the most susceptible residue to modification by various chemicals, such as p-nitrophenyl acetate (28Jabusch J.R. Deutsch H.F. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1985; 238: 170-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), aspirin (29Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), acetic anhydride (30Macdonald J.M. Haas A.L. London R.E. J. Biol.

Dougherty C.S. Corman J.I. Wynn R. Copeland R.A. J. Protein Chem. 2000; 19: 489-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). This preference for modification could be due to the differential amine surface accessibility (29Macdonald J.M. LeBlanc D.A. Haas A.L. London R.E. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1999; 57: 1233-1244Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) or to the catalytic microenvironment. The latter is most likely with respect to Lys6 because acetylation of Lys6 depends upon its interaction with His68 (30Macdonald J.M. Haas A.L. London R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31908-31913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). In the three-dimensional structure of ubiquitin, His68 is located in the vicinity of Lys6 (32Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Cook W.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1987; 194: 531-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (1375) Google Scholar, 33Vijay-Kumar S. Bugg C.E. Wilkinson K.D. Vierstra R.D. Hatfield P.M. Cook W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6396-6399Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between Lys6 and His68 provides a catalytic microenvironment for the modification of Lys6 (30Macdonald J.M. Haas A.L. London R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31908-31913Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Given the similarity between biotinylation and the chemical modifications mentioned above, Lys6 could also be the dominant site of biotinylation. Individual Lys-to-Arg mutations are often used to test the role of particular Lys residues in ubiquitin chain formation. However, the physiological consequences of Lys-to-Arg mutations may be due to factors unrelated to whether that particular Lys is used for chain synthesis. Disruption of a face on ubiquitin necessary for recognition by enzymes involved in ubiquitin conjugation or degradation could be one of the factors. A detailed characterization of biotinylated ubiquitin will allow us to determine the role of a particular Lys residue in ubiquitin chain formation and in maintaining the surface property for proper interaction with enzymes involved in ubiquitination, deubiquitination, and degradation of ubiquitin conjugates. In this study, we ascertained which Lys residues are modified by sulfo-NHS-biotin. Subsequently, we determined the ability of various biotinylated ubiquitins to form ubiquitin conjugates and to support ubiquitin-dependent degradation. The results show that 1) Lys6 was the most readily labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin; 2) Lys6-biotinylated ubiquitin was used as efficiently as unmodified ubiquitin to form high molecular mass ubiquitin conjugates; 3) Lys6-biotinylated ubiquitin inhibited ubiquitin-dependent degradation because conjugates formed with Lys6-biotinylated ubiquitin were less susceptible to degradation by the 26 S proteasome; 4) K6W mutant ubiquitin had effects similar to those of Lys6-biotinylated ubiquitin; and 5) intracellular expression of K6W mutant ubiquitin resulted in stabilization of substrates for the UPP and enhanced susceptibility to oxidative stress. The data indicate that Lys6-modified ubiquitin is a specific inhibitor of the UPP and a valuable reagent for studying functions of ubiquitin-dependent cellular processes.

The reaction was carried out on ice for 2 h with occasional shaking and was terminated by addition of lysine at a final concentration of 20 mm. The biotinylated ubiquitins were purified by reversed-phase HPLC (HP 1100) on a Vydac C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5-μm particle size, 90-Å pore size) using water/acetonitrile linear gradients containing 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid in both mobile phases. The elution gradient started at 20% acetonitrile and increased to 70% acetonitrile in a 40-min period. Elution was monitored at 254 and 280 nm. Peaks were collected individually. The masses of ubiquitin in each fraction were determined by a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer (Voyager-DE Biospectrometry workstation, PerSeptive Biosystems) or by an in-line electrospray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometer (Esquire-LC, Bruker Daltonik GmbH). Mapping the Sites of Biotinylation—Each fraction of biotinylated ubiquitin was lyophilized and redissolved in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mm EDTA at a concentration of 1 mg/ml. Twenty μg of biotinylated ubiquitin was digested with 2 μg of sequencing grade Lys-C or trypsin at 32 °C for 16 h. The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC (HP 1100) on a Vydac C18 column (1 × 50 mm, 5-μm particle size, 300-Å pore size) with gradients from 0 to 60% acetonitrile over 40 min. The masses of the separated peptides were determined with the Esquire-LC in-line electrospray ionization ion-trap mass spectrometer. The sites of biotinylation were determined by comparing the observed peptide masses with the calculated masses of all peptides that could be derived from ubiquitin after digestion with Lys-C or trypsin. The sites of biotinylation were also confirmed by N-terminal sequencing of biotinylated ubiquitins. To do this, each of the purified biotinylated ubiquitins was sequenced for 34 cycles using a protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Generation of Ubiquitin Mutants—K6A and K6R mutant ubiquitins were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis and expressed in Escherichia coli as described previously (34Burch T.J. Haas A.L. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 7300-7308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). K6W mutant ubiquitin was generated by PCR amplification of mouse polyubiquitin cDNA (35Finch J.S. Bonham K. Krieg P. Bowden G.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1990; 18: 1907Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar) with forward primer 5′-CGCCACCATGCAGATCTTCGTGTGGACC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-TTAGCCACCTCTCAGGCAAGGACC-3′. The PCR products were purified and inserted into the pAdTrack-CMV vector (36He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar) for expression in mammalian cells or subcloned into the pET15b vector (Novagen) for expression in E. coli. The sequence of the mutant ubiquitin gene was confirmed by sequencing the entire coding region. Recombinant adenoviruses were generated using the AdEasy adenoviral vector system (36He T.C. Zhou S. da Costa L.T. Yu J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2509-2514Crossref PubMed Scopus (3253) Google Scholar). To study the effect of K6W mutant ubiquitin in HEK293 cells, wild-type and K6W mutant ubiquitin constructs were introduced into 293 cells using Lipofectamine according to the manufacturer's instructions. To study the effect of K6W mutant ubiquitin in human lens epithelial cells, the cells were infected with control recombinant adenovirus (no ubiquitin) and with recombinant adenovirus encoding K6W mutant ubiquitin. Detection of Ubiquitin Conjugates—Levels of endogenous ubiquitin conjugates were determined by Western blotting as described previously (37Shang F. Taylor A. Biochem. J. 1995; 307: 297-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Briefly, proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 12% gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The blots were probed with antibody to ubiquitin. The specifically bound antibody was detected with 125I-protein A, followed by autoradiography or by chemiluminescence detection using the SuperSignal kit. De Novo Ubiquitin Conjugation—The ability of biotinylated ubiquitins to support ubiquitination was determined in fraction II of rabbit reticulocytes (38Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or in the supernatant (S100) of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Fraction II of reticulocytes and RPE cell lysate were prepared as described previously (38Ciechanover A. Elias S. Heller H. Hershko A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2537-2542Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 39Obin M. Nowell T. Taylor A. Curr. Eye Res. 1995; 14: 751-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The conjugation activity was determined using endogenous enzymes and exogenous 125I-labeled bovine α-lactalbumin or bovine transducin-α as substrate. Briefly, the assay was conducted in a final volume of 25 μl containing (final concentrations) 12 mg/ml RPE cell supernatant or 10 mg/ml fraction II, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 μm 125I-labeled substrate, and 8 μm wild-type or mutant ubiquitin. The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min, and the reaction was stopped by addition of 25 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE loading buffer. After boiling at 100 °C for 3 min, aliquots of the mixture were resolved by SDS-PAGE. The ubiquitin conjugates formed de novo were visualized by autoradiography. Ubiquitin-dependent Degradation of Model Substrates—The ability of differentially modified ubiquitins to support ATP-dependent degradation was determined in RPE cell lysates using 125I-labeled α-crystallin or transducin-α as substrate. Briefly, the assay was conducted in a final volume of 25 μl containing (final concentrations) 12 mg/ml RPE cell supernatant, 8 μm wild-type or mutant ubiquitin, 50 mm Tris (pH 7.6), 2 mm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 mm MgCl2, 4 mm creatine phosphate, 2 μg/ml creatine phosphokinase, and 2–4 μm 125I-labeled substrate. The same conditions were used to measure ATP-independent degradation except that ATP, creatine phosphate, and creatine phosphokinase were replaced with 30 mm 2-deoxyglucose. The reaction was carried out at 37 °C for 2 h and then stopped by addition of 200 μl of cold 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin solution and 50 μl of 100% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The mixture was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 10 min after standing on ice for 10 min, and the radioactivity in the supernatants and pellets was counted. The degradation rates are expressed as percentages of the 125I-labeled substrates that became trichloroacetic acid-soluble (40Shang F. Huang L. Taylor A. Curr. Eye Res. 1994; 13: 423-431Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Proteasome Binding Assay—Bovine α-lactalbumin was first labeled with 125I and used as substrate for ubiquitin conjugation. Ubiquitin conjugates of 125I-labeled α-lactalbumin were formed in proteasome-free fraction II of rabbit reticulocytes upon addition of wild-type, Lys6-biotinylated, K6W, or L8A mutant ubiquitin. To obtain proteasome-free fraction II, rabbit reticulocyte fraction II was prepared as described (41Huang L.L. Jahngen-Hodge J. Taylor A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1175: 181-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the proteasome was removed from fraction II by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 5 h (42Gaczynska M. Goldberg A.L. Tanaka K. Hendil K.B. Rock K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 17275-17280Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The ubiquitin conjugates of 125I-labeled α-lactalbumin were isolated chromatographically using a DE52 column. Proteasome from rabbit reticulocyte was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. After denaturation and renaturation procedures (19Deveraux Q. Ustrell V. Pickart C. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7059-7061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 20van Nocker S. Deveraux Q. Rechsteiner M. Vierstra R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 856-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), the membranes were probed with the respective ubiquitin conjugates of 125I-labeled α-lactalbumin. To quantitatively test the capability of binding to S5a, glutathione S-transferase (GST)-S5a fusion protein was immobilized on glutathione-agarose as described (43Layfield R. Tooth D. Landon M. Dawson S. Mayer J. Alban A. Proteomics. 2001; 1: 773-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and incubated overnight with ubiquitinated 125I-labeled α-lactalbumin at 4 °C. After five washes with 50 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.2% Tween 20, bound ubiquitin conjugates, together with GST-S5a, were eluted with 10 mm glutathione and quantified using a γ-counter. GST-glutathione-agarose was used as negative control to subtract nonspecific binding. Sensitivity to Oxidative Stress Assays—Human lens epithelial cells at ∼50% confluence were infected with recombinant adenovirus encoding K6W mutant ubiquitin or with control adenovirus for 48 h. The cells were then exposed to ∼20 μm H2O2 constantly generated by addition of glucose oxidase to the medium (0.1 unit/dish) as described (4Shang F. Nowell Jr., T.R. Taylor A. Exp. Eye Res. 2001; 73: 229-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). After exposure to H2O2 for 8 h, cell viability was determined by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay using reagents from Promega. Cells detached from the plate were collected and stained with trypan blue, and the stained and unstained cells were then counted using a hemocytometer. Cells adhering to the dishes were collected with trypsin/EDTA and counted to determine the total number of cells in each dish. (>99% of the adherent cells were viable.) Susceptibility to oxidative stress was indicated by a decrease in cell viability and by an increase in the number of cells stained with trypan blue (dead cells) after exposure to H2O2. Sensitivity to Canavanine—K6R mutant ubiquitin was constructed and expressed in yeast as described (8Spence J. Sadis S. Haas A.L. Finley D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 1265-1273Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, wild-type or K6R mutant ubiquitin under the control of the CUP1 promoter (16DeMartino G.N. Moomaw C.R. Zagnitko O.P. Proske R.J. Chu-Ping M. Afendis S.J. Swaffield J.C. Slaughter C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20878-20884Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was transformed into a yeast strain (SUB328) in which the genes encoding ubiquitin-ribosomal protein fusions (UBI1 to UBI3) and polyubiquitin (UBI4) had been deleted (44Finley D. Sadis S. Monia B.P. Boucher P. Ecker D.J. Crooke S.T. Chau V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5501-5509Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). The yeast cells were cultured in the presence or absence of 1 μm canavanine, an amino acid analog. Lys6 of Ubiquitin Is the Most Readily Labeled with Sulfo-NHS-biotin—To characterize relations between the stoichiometry of sulfo-NHS-biotin and the extent and location of ubiquitin modification, we isolated biotinylated ubiquitins that were formed using different amounts of sulfo-NHS-biotin (Fig. 1A). There are 7 Lys residues in a ubiquitin molecule (Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33, Lys48, and Lys63). Together with the N-terminal amine group, there are eight possible positions that can be labeled with sulfo-NHS-biotin. When the sulfo-NHS-biotin/ubiquitin ratio was 2, >95% of the ubiquitin was modified, and the majority of the ubiquitin was monobiotinylated (Fig. 1B). When the sulfo-NHS-biotin/ubiquitin ratio was increased to 3.5, 100% of the ubiquitin was modified by at least one biotin moiety (Fig. 1C). The modified ubiquitins were separated by HPLC, and their masses were determined using an in-line mass spectrometer. The peak that eluted at ∼22.5 min had a mass of 8565.0 Da, which corresponds to unmodified ubiquitin. The peak that eluted at ∼23.5 min had a mass of 8790.3 Da, which corresponds to monobiotinylated ubiquitin. The peaks that eluted at ∼24.5 and 26 min, respectively, had an identical mass of 9016.3 Da, corresponding to dibiotinylated ubiquitin. The peak that eluted at ∼27 min had a mass of 9242.8 Da, corresponding to tribiotinylated ubiquitin. There are eight positions where a single biotin might attach and 28 or 56 combinations of possible dior tribiotinylated ubiquitins, respectively. To determine which Lys residues were labeled with biotin, the differentially labeled ubiquitins were digested with endopeptidase Lys-C, which cleaves peptide bonds after Lys residues. The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC, and the masses were determined as described above. Except for the Ala28–Lys29 and Ile30–Lys33 peptides, all peptides were recovered stoichiometrically during peptide mapping. Comparison of the masses of peptides from monobiotinylated ubiquitin and from unmodified ubiquitin showed that, upon biotinylation, only the mass of the Met1–Lys11 peptide increased by the mass of the biotin adduct (227 atomic mass units) (Table I). Thus, the biotin in monobiotinylated ubiquitin is exclusively located between Met1 and Lys11. One of the biotins in both dibiotinylated and tribiotinylated ubiquitins is also located within this fragment. Edman degradation analysis of this fragment revealed that only Lys6 was labeled and that Met1 and Lys11 were free of modification. The other biotin in dibiotinylated ubiquitin that eluted at 26 min was located in the Gln49–Lys63 fragment (Table I). Thus, this dibiotinylated ubiquitin was labeled at Lys6 and Lys63.Table IBiotinylation sites of biotin-labeled ubiquitin as determined by peptide mass mapping after endopeptidase Lys-C digestionWT UbPeak at 23.5"

Our Pliocene paleothermometer supports the idea of a dynamic “ocean thermostat” in which heating of the tropical Pacific leads to a cooling of the east equatorial Pacific and a La Niña–like state, analogous to observations of a transient increasing east-west sea surface temperature gradient in the 20th-century tropical Pacific."

DNA damage checkpoint proteins are crucial for maintaining DNA integrity and normal cellular functions, but they may also reduce the effectiveness of cancer treatment. Here we report the involvement of Cdk5 activator p35-binding protein C53 in regulation of apoptosis induced by genotoxic stress through modulating Cdk1-cyclin B1 function. C53 was originally identified as a Cdk5 activator p35-binding protein and a caspase substrate. Importantly, our results demonstrated that C53 deficiency conferred partial resistance to genotoxic agents such as etoposide and x-ray irradiation, whereas ectopic expression of C53 rendered cells susceptible to multiple genotoxins that usually trigger G2/M arrest. Furthermore, we found that Cdk1 activity was required for etoposide-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells. Overexpression of C53 promoted Cdk1 activity and nuclear accumulation of cyclin B1, whereas C53 deficiency led to more cytoplasmic retention of cyclin B1, suggesting that C53 acts as a pivotal player in modulating the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. Finally, C53 and cyclin B1 co-localize and associate in vivo, indicating a direct role of C53 in regulating the Cdk1-cyclin B1 complex. Taken together, our results strongly indicate that in response to genotoxic stress, C53 serves as an important regulatory component of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. By overriding the G2/M checkpoint-mediated inhibition of Cdk1-cyclin B1 function, ectopic expression of C53 may represent a novel approach for chemo- and radio-sensitization of cancer cells.

Mammalian cells have developed sophisticated mechanisms to cope with DNA damage induced by either normal metabolic processes or genotoxic stresses. In response to genotoxic stress, cells may either undergo cell cycle arrest and DNA repair or commit suicide if the damage is beyond repair. Among many factors that influence cellular decision-making under genotoxic stress, DNA damage checkpoints play crucial roles in regulation of cell cycle arrest and cell death. DNA damage checkpoints are biochemical pathways that delay or arrest cell cycle progression in response to DNA damage (1Nyberg K.A. Michelson R.J. Putnam C.W. Weinert T.A. Annu. Rev. Genet. 2002; 36: 617-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). Based upon the interphase transition that is inhibited by DNA damage, three major checkpoints are defined as the G1/S, intra-S, and G2/M checkpoints (2Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). In response to DNA damage, these checkpoints inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 to S (the G1/S checkpoint), DNA replication (the intra-S checkpoint), or G2 to mitosis (the G2/M checkpoint), respectively (2Sancar A. Lindsey-Boltz L.A. Unsal-Kacmaz K. Linn S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2004; 73: 39-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (2490) Google Scholar). Although DNA damage checkpoints are crucial for maintaining DNA integrity in normal cells, they may also present a great challenge to cancer treatment because they may arrest cell cycle and trigger DNA repair in tumor cells, thereby reducing the effectiveness of many conventional therapies that cause DNA damage. Therefore, many efforts have been made to target specific checkpoints to sensitize tumor cells to conventional therapies (3Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar).Orderly progression of normal cell cycle is closely monitored and tightly controlled by multiple cell cycle checkpoints. A recent study indicates that the same biochemical pathways and relevant proteins are involved in both cell cycle control and DNA damage checkpoints. One of the major players of the G2/M checkpoint is cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1, 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, A-T and rad3-related; siRNA, small interfering RNA; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; zVAD-fmk, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative. 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinase; ATM, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated; ATR, A-T and rad3-related; siRNA, small interfering RNA; shRNA, small hairpin RNA; TNF, tumor necrosis factor; zVAD-fmk, N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp fluoromethyl ketone; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; DN, dominant negative. formerly called cdc2)-cyclin B1 complex that is absolutely required for the entry of mitosis (4Gautier J.

Morgan D.O. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2000; 12: 658-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Cdk1 activation is a multistep process that begins with the increase of cyclin B1 transcription during G2 phase. Meanwhile, Cdk1 is inhibited by phosphorylation on residues Thr-14 and Tyr-15 (by Myt1 and Wee1 kinases, respectively). At the onset of mitosis, Cdk1 is activated through dephosphorylation of Thr-14 and -15 that is carried out by dual phosphatase CDC25C as well as phosphorylation on Thr-161 by Cdk-activating kinase (a heterodimer of Cdk7 and cyclin H). Once active, Cdk1-cyclin B1 complex phosphorylates CDC25C to enhance its phosphatase activity, resulting in a positive feedback loop. Meanwhile, active Cdk1-cyclin B1 translocates from cytoplasm to nucleus during early mitosis and phosphorylates nuclear substrates, leading to nuclear envelope disassembly, chromosome condensation, and separation of sister chromatids. At the end of metaphase, cyclin B1 is destroyed by anaphase promoting complex to allow mitosis to proceed. In response to DNA damage, the G2/M checkpoint system functions to arrest cell cycle in part by inhibiting Cdk1-cyclin B1 activity. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase family of protein kinases including ATM (ataxia telangiectasia-mutated) and ATR (A-T and rad3-related) transduce the signal of DNA damage and phosphorylate and activate checkpoint kinases checkpoint kinase 1 and 2, which in turn phosphorylate CDC25C (3Zhou B.B. Bartek J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2004; 4: 216-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (353) Google Scholar). Phosphorylated CDC25C is sequestered by 14-3-3 away from Cdk1, thereby preventing dephosphorylation and activation of Cdk1 (8Sanchez Y. Wong C. Thoma R.S. Richman R. Wu Z. Piwnica-Worms H.

At the onset of mitosis, phosphorylation of four serine residues (Ser-126, -128, -133, and -147) at the N-terminal region of human cyclin B1 that contains both cytoplasmic retention sequence and nuclear export sequence causes an inhibition of nuclear export and enhances nuclear import, resulting in a net accumulation of cyclin B in nucleus.Cdk1-cyclin B1 has also been demonstrated to play a critical role in regulation of apoptosis in a number of experimental systems (16Castedo M. Perfettini J.L. Roumier T. Kroemer G. Cell Death Differ. 2002; 9: 1287-1293Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar). Increased Cdk1 activity has been observed in various apoptotic conditions (17Zhou B.B. Li H. Yuan J. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Furthermore, overexpression of active Cdk1-cyclin B1 promotes mitotic catastrophe and apoptosis (10Jin P. Hardy S. Morgan D.O. J.

Yet the molecular mechanism of Cdk1-mediated apoptosis remains largely unclear.In this study we report here that Cdk5 activator p35-binding protein C53 plays a critical role in regulating genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis through modulating the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint. By overcoming the G2 checkpoint-mediated inhibition of Cdk1-cyclin B1 function, ectopic expression of C53 may represent a novel approach for chemo- and radio-sensitization of cancer cells.MATERIALS AND METHODSTissue Culture Cells and Reagents—HeLa cells (from ATCC) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. TNFα, genotoxic reagents, and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. Purified Cdk1-cyclin B1 was purchased from Upstate.In Vitro Expression Cloning—Construction of mouse spleen cDNA small pool library and in vitro expression cloning was described (23Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J. Cell. 1998; 94: 491-501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3765) Google Scholar).cDNA Cloning, Construction of Expression Vectors, and Site-specific Mutagenesis—Human C53 cDNA was amplified using primers containing SalI and KpnI sites and EST clone BE336801 (Invitrogen) as a template. Amplified C53 cDNA was sequenced and subcloned in-frame into pCMV-5a (Sigma), and the resulting construct was used for expression of the C-terminal FLAG-tagged C53 in mammalian cells. Site-specific mutagenesis was performed using the QuikChange site-specific mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing.Production and Purification of C53 Antibodies—His-tagged murine C53 fusion protein was purified using a nickel column (Novagen) and injected into three rats to generate polyclonal antibodies from rat. Rat polyclonal antibody (used for immunostaining assay) was affinity-purified. Two rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated against two peptides (residues 242–256, KRGNSTVYEWRTGTE, and residues 491–506, SKRYSGRPVNLMGTSL). Sera were further purified using affinity column cross-linked with respective peptides (Pierce).Co-immunoprecipitation, Immunoblotting, Immunostaining, and Antibodies Used in This Study—For co-immunoprecipitation assay, HeLa cells (5 × 107) were harvested and resuspended in the lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktails). After clearance, 5 μg of cyclin B1 antibody was incubated with cell lysate for 2 h at 4 °C followed by the addition of 10 μl of protein A/G beads (Pierce). After three washes of lysis buffer, the bound proteins were eluted with 0.1 m glycine, pH 2.5. The samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting.Immunostaining of cytochrome c, C53, and cyclin B1 and immunoblotting was performed as described (23Li H. Zhu H. Xu C.J. Yuan J.

All of C53 antibodies were generated by the Li laboratory as described above.Caspase Activity Assay—Caspase activity was analyzed by Apo-one caspase assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instruction.Small Interfering RNA (siRNA) Synthesis and Construction of Small Hairpin RNA (shRNA) Expression Vectors—C53 siRNAs were designed according to Elbashir et al. (25Elbashir S.M. Harborth J. Lendeckel W. Yalcin A. Weber K. Tuschl T. Nature. 2001; 411: 494-498Crossref PubMed Scopus (8078) Google Scholar) and synthesized by Qiagen. siRNA-1 for human C53 is r(GCAGAUUGCCAAGUGCCAGC), whereas siRNA-2 is r(GCUGGCACUUGGCAAUC GGC). To construct shRNA expression vectors, we ligated shRNA oligonucleotide template into linearized pSIREN-RetroQ vector (Clontech) to generate pSIREN-RetroQ-C53 expressing C53 shRNA. Oligonucleotide templates were designed and synthesized according to guidelines provided by Clontech.Establishment of C53-deficient Stable Clones—HeLa cells (106) were transfected with pSIREN-RetroQ-C53 plasmid or pSIREN-RetroQ-Luc (expressing luciferase siRNA). After a 48-h incubation, cells were treated with puromycin (2 μg/ml) for 3–4 days. Single clones were obtained by serial dilutions, and C53 expression was examined by immunoblotting.Cell Death and Cell Viability Assays—For trypan blue exclusion assay, cells were trypsinized, combined and harvested with floating cells, and subsequently incubated with 0.4% trypan blue solution (Sigma) for 5 min. Blue cells were scored as dead cells. Three independent assays were performed for each experiment, and at least more than 200 cells were scored. For annexin V assay, cells (106) were partially trypsinized, harvested, and incubated with annexin V and propidium iodine (Oncogene) in the binding buffer according to the supplier's instruction. The samples were subjected to flow cytometry analysis. Cell viability was measured by CellTiter-Blue assay (Promega) according to the supplier's instruction. For ectopic expression of C53 in normal and C53-deficient cells, the constructs expressing C53 and its mutant were transfected into HeLa cells along with EGFP marker using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). After a 24-h incubation, cells were treated with a variety of agents at the indicated concentrations for either 24 or 48 h. The percentage of cell death was scored by counting GFP-positive cells with DNA staining. Small and round cells with condensed, and fragmented nuclei were scored as dead cells, whereas flat and big cells with normal nuclei were scored as live cells. Each experiment was independently repeated as a triplicate.Cell Cycle Analysis—Cells were trypsinized, washed in phosphate-buffered saline and fixed with 100% ethanol at -20 °C. Cells were then washed in phosphate-buffered saline again and resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing RNase A (5 μg/ml) and propidium iodide (10 μg/ml). A total of 10,000 labeled nuclei were analyzed in a FACScan Flow Cytometer (BD Biosciences).Cdk1 Kinase Assay—Cells were detached from dishes with a rubber policeman, harvested by centrifugation, and resuspended in lysis buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2,1mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF, supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktails). After 30 min of incubation on ice, lysates were clarified by centrifugation (10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C). For the histone H1 kinase assay, cell lysates (150 μg) was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with anti-cyclin B1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz). Protein A/G beads were then added to the lysates and incubated for 1 h. Immunoprecipitates were washed 3 times with lysis buffer, once with HBS (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl). The beads were incubated with 5 μg of histone H1 in HBS (20 μl) containing 15 mm MgCl2,50 μm ATP, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. After 10 and 30 min of incubation at 30 °C, the reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography.Subcellular Fractionation—Cell pellets collected from individual dishes were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.2, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mm NaF) supplemented with protease inhibitor cocktails. After 30 min of incubation on ice, lysates were centrifuged at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were cleared again at 13,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C to harvest the cytosolic fraction. The pellets from the first centrifugation were washed twice with lysis buffer and centrifuged again at 1000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Pellets from this step contained the nuclear fractions.RESULTSC53 Was Involved in Modulating Apoptosis Induced by Genotoxic Stress—C53 was originally isolated as a Cdk5 activator p35-binding protein in a yeast two-hybrid screening using p35 as bait (26Ching Y.P. Qi Z. Wang J.H. Gene (Amst.). 2000; 242: 285-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) and subsequently identified as a caspase substrate. 2H. Jiang, S. Luo, and H. Li, unpublished data. To investigate the cellular function of C53 in regulation of apoptosis, we took the advantage of siRNA technique. As shown in Fig. 1A, C53 siRNA-1 inhibited overexpression of C53-FLAG fusion protein in HeLa cells. In attempt to achieve a better deficiency of C53, we used this siRNA sequence, which is identical among human, mouse, and rat C53 genes, to construct a plasmid-based shRNA expression vector (pSIREN-RetroQ-C53). After transfection of shRNA expression vector into HeLa cells, drug selection, and single clone isolation, we obtained three clones expressing extremely low levels of C53 (Fig. 1B). Vector-based C53 shRNA specifically reduced expression of C53 protein but not other proteins such as caspases (casp-2, -3, -7, and -9), Bcl-2 family members (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bim, Bak, Bax), Apaf-1, inhibitor of apoptosis (CIAP1 (cellular inhibitor of apoptosis 1) and XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis)), iκBα, and tubulin (Fig. 1B). 2H. Jiang, S. Luo, and H. Li, unpublished data. Loss of C53 did not affect cell proliferation and cellular morphology. 3H. Jiang and H. Li, unpublished data. We further examined the responses of these stable cell lines to DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. As illustrated in Fig. 1C, loss of C53 rendered HeLa cells partially but significantly resistant to cell death induced by DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor etoposide. After 48 h of treatment of 20 μm etoposide, more than 60% of control HeLa cells underwent cell death, whereas around 30% of C53-deficient cells died. Similar results were observed for E1A-transformed human fibroblast cells IMR90E1A (Supplemental Fig. S1). Moreover, annexin V staining and flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that loss of C53 significantly inhibited both early and late stages of apoptosis induced by etoposide (Fig. 1D), indicating that C53 may modulate etoposide-induced apoptosis.To further confirm the specificity of C53 shRNA and to test if C53 is indeed required for etoposide-induced apoptosis, we attempted to restore the sensitivity of those stable cell lines to etoposide by expressing C53 ectopically. To avoid inhibition of ectopic expression of C53 protein by C53 shRNA, we introduced two silent mutations in the region of C53 cDNA that were complementary to C53 shRNA. As expected, only the construct of C53-si (C53 cDNA with two silent mutations) could ectopically express wild-type C53 in C53-deficient cells (Fig. 1E), which in turn restored the sensitivity of C53-deficient cell line 6 to etoposide-induced apoptosis (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our results strongly suggest that C53 is likely to play a critical role in modulating etoposide-induced apoptosis.C53 Was Required for Mitochondrial Damage and Caspase Activation in Etoposide-induced Apoptosis—Because C53 may play a critical role in etoposide-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells, we attempted to understand more about this apoptotic process. Etoposide strongly induced a G2/M arrest in HeLa cells after 24 h of treatment (Fig. 4) 3H. Jiang and H. Li, unpublished data. followed by rapid cell death around 40 h post-treatment (Fig. 2A). Meanwhile, a basal level of cell death was also induced by etoposide (20–30% cell death in a 48-h treatment) that is independent of C53 and caspases (Fig. 2, A and B). To investigate the possible working mechanism of C53, we first examined if C53 deficiency resulted in the defects on either drug uptake and/or sensing of DNA damage. As shown in Fig. 2D, loss of C53 did not inhibit up-regulation of p53 induced by etoposide, indicating that C53 may not be involved in drug uptake or sensing of DNA damage. We then attempted to examine the relationship between C53 and the core apoptotic apparatus. As shown in Fig. 2B, a pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD-fmk inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis to the basal level (around 30% cell death) but did not have any effect on C53-deficient cell lines. Furthermore, C53 deficiency partially inhibited caspase activity induced by etoposide (Fig. 2C). Activation of both initiator caspases (caspase-2 and -9) and executioner caspase-3 in etoposide-induced apoptosis of HeLa cells was partially inhibited by loss of C53 (Fig. 2E), indicating that C53 acts upstream of caspase activation. Finally, loss of C53 partially prevented the release of apoptogenic factor cytochrome c from mitochondria (Fig. 2, F and G). These results suggest that C53 may act upstream of mitochondrial damage and caspase activation during etoposide-induced apoptosis.Fig. 4Sensitization of HeLa cells by C53 to multiple genotoxins is Cdk1 activity-dependent. A, ectopic expression of C53 renders HeLa cells susceptible to multiple genotoxic agents. HeLa cells were transfected with C53 construct (1.5 μg) along with EGFP (0.2 μg). After 24 h of incubation, cells were treated for 24 h with the following agents: etoposide (ETOP; 20 μm), camptothecin (CPT; 2 μm), doxorubicin (Dox; 5 μm), cisplatin (CisP; 10 μm), TNFα (0.5 ng/ml) plus cycloheximide (1 μg/ml), and UV (60 J/m2).

The percentage of G2/M arrest was evaluated by flow cytometry. Data were the mean ± S.D., with two independent repeats. DMSO, Me2SO. C, Cdk1 inhibitor olomoucine II partially inhibited etoposide-induced cell death of HeLa cells. The control and C53-deficient HeLa cells were treated with 20 μm etoposide for 48 h in the presence of Me2SO or olomoucine II (2 μm). Cell death was scored by trypan blue exclusion assay. Results were the mean ± S.D., with three independent repeats. D, Cdk1 dominant negative mutant inhibited C53-mediated chemosensitization of HeLa cells. HeLa cells were co-transfected with C53 construct and various Cdk DN mutants as indicated. After 24-h of etoposide treatment, cell death was scored by DNA staining of GFP-positive cells. Results were the mean ± S.D., with three independent repeats.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Fig. 2Loss of C53 partially prevented caspase activation and cytochrome c release.

More than 700 cells were counted in three independent experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Ectopic Expression of C53 Promoted Apoptosis Induced by Genotoxic Stress—Because C53 deficiency partially inhibited etoposide-induced apoptosis, we further examined if overexpression of C53 could sensitize HeLa cells to genotoxic stress. As shown in real-time images (Fig. 3A), C53-transfected cells (indicated by fluorescence of EGFP, panel a and b) underwent rapid cell death (as early as 6 h post-treatment, indicated by shrinkage and blebbing) after etoposide treatment, whereas untransfected cells remained in G2/M arrest (indicated by large cell bodies in the center of the images) followed by delayed cell death around 40 h post-treatment (Fig. 2A). After a 24-h treatment, vector-transfected HeLa cells had only 20% cell death, whereas in the presence of C53 overexpression, more than 60% of HeLa cells underwent cell death (Fig. 4B). Similarly, overexpression of C53 also sensitized IMR90E1A cells to etoposide-induced cell death (Fig. 3B and Supplemental Fig. S1B). This result strongly suggests that overexpression of C53 sensitizes tumor cells to etoposide-induced cell death. Furthermore, C53-promoted cell death was apoptotic cell death, as indicated by more poly(ADP-ribose)"

ERα and ERβ bind to the estrogen response element (ERE) on the promoters of the genes they regulate. The ERE is a palindrome of RG-GTCA motifs separated by 3 bp (3Sanchez R. Nguyen D. Rocha W.

The sequence and spatial organization of the ERE is important for the specificity of binding. Although a crystal structure of the DNA-bound ER is available (4Schwabe J.W. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), the unexpected diversity of DNA response elements mediating transcriptional regulation by ERs has made finding EREs in the genome very difficult.

Science. 2001; 291: 1304-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (10466) Google Scholar) has opened a new way to study gene regulation through bioinformatic analysis of transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) on gene promoters. There now exist on the Web both free and subscription-based resources for such analysis of specific promoter regions to identify putative TFBSs (7Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (Data base issue) -D81: D78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Given a user-defined DNA sequence, these programs can predict the potential TFBSs. These resources are valuable for researchers studying regulation of individual genes. When it comes to studying global changes in gene expression following various treatments (drugs, hormones, heat shock) of cells or animals, DNA microarrays are the most popular tool. Most of these changes in gene expression are mediated through the activation of one or more transcriptional regulators (for example, p53 in DNA damage response and steroid hormone receptors like ER and retinoic acid receptor following estrogen and retinoic acid treatment, respectively). It is possible, using bioinformatics, to predict genes that are regulated by these transcriptional regulators by analyzing the promoter regions for binding sites to these transcription factors. In one such study, Hoh et al. (10Hoh J. Jin S. Parrado T. Edington J. Levine A.J. Ott J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 8467-8472Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar) developed a computer algorithm, p53MH, to perform a genome-wide scan for p53 binding sites and identified 2,583 genes with putative binding sites for p53. Others have used similar approaches to identify p53 target genes in promoter regions and introns and c-Myc target genes in 5′-untranslated regions, respectively (11Wang L. Wu Q. Qiu P. Mirza A.

Benvenisty N. Gene. 2002; 292: 91-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Although these studies have shown that these approaches are worthwhile and identify potential regulated genes of transcription factors of interest, they are limited in scope because they were applied to a single transcription factor. There is thus a need for a public resource for investigators to identify genes that are potentially regulated by specific transcription factor(s) through genome-wide bioinformatic analysis of promoter regions.In this study we developed a pipeline to identify genes controlled by the steroid hormone transcription factor, estrogen receptor. We have also shown that our method is easily extensible to the study of all transcription factors with a characterized binding site. Our Web-based software, [email protected], described herein, allows a user to identify from a set of all annotated human and mouse promoters the ones that may be regulated by the transcription factor of interest.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPrograms—All programming languages and software used were Open Source, supplied under a general public license. The programs were written in Python (www.python.org). We used the MySQL data base Server software (www.mysql.com). The application runs on an Apache 2.0 HTML server (www.apache.org). All graphs were generated using the Scipy package for Python. Programs from the EMBOSS software suite (14Rice P. Longden I. Bleasby A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 276-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (6327) Google Scholar) were used for some functions, cpgplot for generating CpG island maps and profit for weight matrix searches.Generation of Putative Promoter Regions and Control Random Regions—Python programs were written to generate putative promoter regions (PPRs), a sequence 2000 nt upstream and 250 nt downstream of transcription start site (TSS) in the GenBank™ annotation of the genome data (NCBI Genome Build 34 Ver3, March, 2004 for human; NCBI Genome Build 32 Ver1, September, 2003 for mouse), and written into a MySQL relational data base. For control random sequences, a similar program was written to obtain 2250-nt sequences from a random position in the genome. The number of random regions per chromosome matched the number of genes in each chromosome. Orthologous information for the mouse and human genes was compiled from the ENSEMBL project (15Hubbard T.

Genome Res. 2004; 14: 160-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar).Cell Lines and Reagents—The MCF7 cell line was obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA). 17-β-Estradiol was purchased from Calbiochem. Unless indicated otherwise, all other reagents and supplies were purchased from standard commercial sources.RT-PCR—MCF7 cells were grown in phenol red-free medium supplemented with 5% charcoal dextran-stripped serum (low estrogen) for 72 h and then treated with same medium supplemented with 0, 1.0, or 10 nm 17-β-estradiol (E2) for another 72 h. Total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol method as recommended by the manufacturer (Invitrogen); 3 μg were used for cDNA synthesis using the Thermoscript RT-PCR system (Invitrogen) and oligo(dT) primers. Custom synthesized primers were purchased from Sigma Genosys (The Woodlands, TX) and used to amplify the cDNA. PCR cycles were optimized for each gene for log phase amplification. Experiments were repeated independently at least three times.RESULTSThe annotation of the genome by the NCBI maps the TSS of each gene in the genome (15Hubbard T. Barker D. Birney E. Cameron G. Chen Y. Clark L. Cox T. Cuff J. Curwen V. Down T. Durbin R. Eyras E. Gilbert J. Hammond M. Huminiecki L. Kasprzyk A. Lehvaslaiho H. Lijnzaad P. Melsopp C. Mongin E. Pettett R. Pocock M. Potter S.

Tatusova T.A. Wagner L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 28-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar). Using this annotation, we have created a data base of sequences containing PPRs spanning 2000 nt upstream and 250 nt downstream of the TSS of each gene. The data base comprises PPRs for 23,077 human genes and 19,984 mouse genes. In addition, we obtained 8793 human and 6785 mouse promoter sequences from the Data Base of Transcriptional Start Sites (DBTSS) resource. We used the TRANSFAC data base (18Wingender E. Dietze P. Karas H. Knuppel R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 238-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (830) Google Scholar, 19Wingender E. Chen X. Fricke E. Geffers R. Hehl R. Liebich I. Krull M. Matys V. Michael H. Ohnhauser R. Pruss M. Schacherer F. Thiele S. Urbach S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 281-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (553) Google Scholar) of DNA binding profiles of eukaryotic transcription factors to build a regular expression (RegEx)-based consensus binding set and a position weight matrix profile for various vertebrate transcription factors. These were then run against the data base of human and mouse promoters. We thus established a “PAGen data base” whereby each annotated gene is defined by a set of putative TFBSs located in its PPR. A flowchart of our approach is shown in Fig. 1.The accuracy of prediction of a given TFBS is dependent on having a good model of transcription factor binding profile. Two major approaches, consensus set and PWMs, have been used to generate a transcription factor binding profile (see Ref. 20Bulyk M.L. Genome Biol. 2003; 5: 201Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar for a review). The consensus method has the major disadvantage of being too rigorous (many false negatives) or too degenerate (many false positives). To overcome this problem, we have adopted a regular expression-based consensus approach (Fig. 2A). Regular expression search is an established standard for text and pattern matching (21Friedl J.E.F. Mastering Regular Expressions. 2nd Ed. O'Reilly and Associates, Sebastopol, CA2002Google Scholar), an important advantage being that it allows for all Boolean operations to be performed. This allows for more complex pattern searches than the use of a degenerate consensus set. It also allows for easy adoption for users familiar with some bioinformatics programming and ease of learning for others with less experience. A user can not only search for promoters with binding sites for one or more specific transcription factors but can also exclude any TFBS that the promoter set should not have.Fig. 2Methods of generation of transcription factor binding profile. A, RegEx-based consensus is compared with Rigorous and Degenerate consensus. Note that the RegEx descriptors are more efficient than the other consensus methods in retrieving potential hits while minimizing false positives. B, an example of a position weight matrix is shown. Each number in the matrix denotes the frequency with which the corresponding nucleotide occurs in a given transcription factor binding site.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The second approach we have taken to build the transcription factor binding profile involves generation of PWMs (Fig. 2B). The elements of a PWM correspond to scores reflecting the probability of a given nucleotide occurring at a particular position of the TFBS (see Ref. 22Stormo G.D. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 16-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (1072) Google Scholar for a review). PWMs provide the best approximation for determining TFBSs and have been used successfully to identify many biologically relevant targets of transcription factors (8Bajic V.B. Tan S.L. Chong A. Tang S. Strom A. Gustafsson J.A. Lin C.Y. Liu E.T. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3605-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar, 10Hoh J. Jin S. Parrado T. Edington J. Levine A.J. Ott J. Proc.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 4442-4451Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar).Validation of the Promoter Set—Another factor that determines the relevance of predicted genes with the queried TFBSs is the accuracy of the TSS, because our PPRs are generated based on this information. We needed to validate the set of putative promoters to determine its usefulness, and to this end we used several tests. On a macro level, we plotted the GC content of the promoter set against a set of 2250-nt fragments randomly generated in the genome with matching gene frequencies for each chromosome. Because promoters on average are known to be GC-rich, an increase in GC content for the promoter set over a randomly generated control set demonstrates validity. Not only did our set of promoters have higher GC content, a plot of the distribution of putative CpG islands showed a striking bias toward the TSS in the promoter sets while being distributed randomly in the random set (Fig. 3A). We used the default EMBOSS values in the cpgplot program for predicting CpG islands, defined as having at least one 50-nt window where the observed to expected ratio is >0.6 and the GC content >50%. The numbers of CpG islands in our promoter sets are included in supplemental Table I. We also plotted the number of TFBSs for a given transcription factor against a given position relative to the TSS (-2000 to +1) for the random control set as well as our experimental promoter set. The clustering of a number of TFBSs (CREB1, CAAT, SP1, GC1) to the -500 to +1 region of the TSS in the promoter set, although distributed randomly in the control set, demonstrated validity (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Analysis of the promoter sets. A, the occurrence of CpG islands against their relative position with respect to the transcriptional start site (TSS) in the PAGen and DBTSS promoter sets are contrasted with a random set. A vast majority of the promoters in the PAGen and DBTSS sets have CpG islands clustered near the TSS, whereas it is distributed throughout the length of the sequence for the random set. B, the position bias for binding sites of transcription factors CREB1, GC1, SP1, and CAAT in the PAGen set of promoters is compared with a random set of sequences. Transcription factors with GC-rich response elements (CREB1, GC1, and SP1) as well as non-GC-rich response elements (CAAT) tend to cluster near the TSS.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)There have been reports about wide inaccuracies in the NCBI genome annotations (24Halees A.S. Leyfer D. Weng Z. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3554-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), leading the authors of one study to identify TSS by mapping mRNA and expressed sequence tag sequences to the genome and to build a dataset of proximal promoters (PromoSer; biowulf.bu.edu/zlab/PromoSer/) for human, mouse, and rat genes. Pairwise sequence analysis of our set of PPRs with the corresponding regions obtained from PromoSer revealed that >90% of our promoter set had >95% identity. The DBTSS project also aims to map the exact genomic position and TSS of all human and mouse genes (12Suzuki Y. Yamashita R. Sugano S. Nakai K. Nucleic Acids Res. 2004; 32 (Data base issue) -D81: D78Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 25Suzuki Y. Yamashita R. Nakai K. Sugano S. Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 328-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). The current version, however, has only TSS for 8793 human and 6785 mouse genes. A comparison of the promoter sequences that we derived from NCBI annotation with this limited set of promoters provided in the DBTSS project showed that >85% of our promoter sequences share at least 90% identity with their respective DBTSS promoters. We found that of these remaining 15%, ∼13% of the NCBI promoters were, on average, 4986 bases downstream of their corresponding DBTSS promoters (8% was found within 1 kb, 1% between 1 and 5 kb, and the rest over 10 kb). The remaining 2% were extremely far apart. To accommodate these discrepancies in promoters, we decided to use the DBTSS promoter set as an additional option.We then searched our data base for putative estrogen-regulated genes by looking for the presence of EREs in their corresponding promoters. We were able to identify several known ER-regulated genes (EBAG9, c-fos, OXT, F12, TFF1, LTF, CTSD, PFDN2, TGF-α, AGT, GREB1). These genes and their EREs as published in the literature and confirmed using [email protected] are shown in Table I. We also identified several novel candidate genes with EREs in their promoters. We tested some of these genes for estrogen regulation using RT-PCR. For our analysis we selected only those genes with an ERE occurring within 1000 nt upstream of the TSS. We chose 16 such genes, designed gene-specific primers, and examined them for regulation by estrogen in MCF7 cells following a 72-h treatment. Of the 16 genes assayed, 6 were not expressed in MCF7 cells and 4 were unresponsive to treatment. However, as shown in Fig. 4, six genes with an ERE in their upstream sequence regions were, in fact, regulated by estrogen in MCF7 cells. Five genes (KIAA1243, NRIP1, MADH9, NME3, and TPD52L) were up-regulated upon treatment, whereas one (BCRP/ABCG2) was down-regulated. These genes, their predicted EREs, and position relative to their TSS are listed in Table II. The down-regulation of ABCG2/BCRP seems to be cell line-specific because it is, in fact, up-regulated following estrogen treatment in ER-positive T47D:A18 cells, an effect that is mediated by the ERE element identified by [email protected] (26Ee P.L. Kamalakaran S. Tonetti D. He X. Ross D.D. Beck W.T. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 1247-1251Crossref PubMed Scopus (184) Google Scholar). Thus, by using [email protected], we have high accuracy for predicting novel estrogen-responsive genes.Table IKnown estrogen-responsive genes identified The PAGen promoter set was searched using EREs from previously published estrogen-regulated genes.

Wild-type (WT) IMP-1 has a conserved Asp-120(81) in the active site, which plays an important role in catalysis. To probe the catalytic role of Asp-120(81) in IMP-1, the IMP-1 mutants, D120(81)A and D120(81)E, were prepared by site-directed mutagenesis, and various kinetics studies were conducted. The IMP-1 mutants exhibited 102–104-fold drops in kcat values compared with WT despite the fact that they contained two Zn(II) ions in the active site. To evaluate the acid-base characteristics of Asp-120(81), the pH dependence for hydrolysis was examined by stopped-flow studies. No observable pKa values between pH 5 and 9 were found for WT and D120(81)A. The rapid mixing of equimolar amounts of nitrocefin and all enzymes failed to result in the detection of an anion intermediate of nitrocefin at 650 nm. These results suggest that Asp-120(81) of IMP-1 is not a factor in decreasing the pKa for the water bridging two Zn(II) ions and is not a proton donor to the anionic intermediate. In the case of D120(81)E, the nitrocefin hydrolysis product, which shows a maximum absorption at 460 nm, was bound to D120(81)E in the protonated form. The three-dimensional structures of D120(81)A and D120(81)E were also determined at 2.0 and 3.0 Å resolutions, respectively. In the case of D120(81)E, the Zn-Zn distance was increased by 0.3 Å compared with WT, due to the change in the coordination mode of Glu-120(81)OE1 and the positional shift in the conserved His-263(197) at the active site.

The mechanism of the antibacterial activity of β-lactams involves the inhibition of the biosynthesis of the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan. Since the introduction of β-lactams into clinical use, bacteria continue to evolve and to defend themselves from antibiotics by means of several strategies. One of these adaptations is the production of β-lactamases, which hydrolyze β-lactams to biologically inactive compounds. As of this writing, more than 300 β-lactamases have been identified (1Bush K. Clin. Infect. Dis. 1998; 27: 48-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). β-Lactamases are classified into four molecular classes, A–D, according to their amino acid sequences (2Ambler R.P. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Ser. 1980; 289: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (1408) Google Scholar). Until recently, β-lactamases of clinical concern were classes A, C, and D, which contain a serine residue at the active site. However, since 1990, as the use of carbapenems such as imipenem, which are often very stable against serine β-lactamases, has expanded, bacterial pathogens producing class B β-lactamases (so-called metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) 1The abbreviations used are: MBL, metallo-β-lactamase; Mes, 2-morpholinoethansulfonic acid; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; WT, wild type; BBL, class B β-lactamase; PDB, Protein Data Bank. which require Zn(II) ion(s) and hydrolyze almost all clinically useful β-lactams) have emerged (3Felici A.

Therefore, the identification of common structural and mechanistic features of metallo-β-lactamases constitutes a clinically important issue. IMP-1, first isolated from S. marcescens in Japan, is a single chain peptide composed of 246 amino acids (4Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wacharotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The IMP-1 gene is mainly encoded in a plasmid and is generally thought to be the most dangerous enzyme. Several bacteria have been reported to produce this enzyme (27Arakawa Y. Murakami M. Suzuki K. Ito H. Wacharotayankun R. Ohsuka S. Kato N. Ohta M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1995; 39: 1612-1615Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). The three-dimensional structure of IMP-1 has been reported by Concha et al. (14Concha N.O. Janson C.A. Rowling P.

Mechanistic studies of di-Zn(II) MBLs have been carried out with a CcrA belonging to subclass B1 (28Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O.

(28Concha N.O. Rasmussen B.A. Bush K. Herzberg O. Structure (Lond.). 1996; 4: 823-836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar) concluded that Zn1 (the two Zn(II) ions are termed Zn1 and Zn2, respectively) is coordinated by three His(s) and a bridging OH2 or OH-, whereas Zn2 is coordinated by Asp, His, Cys, a bridging OH2 or OH-, and another OH2 (Fig. 1). OH2 or OH- bridging between the two Zn(II) ions in the active site is proposed to act as the deprotonated nucleophile to attack the carbonyl carbon of the β-lactam ring with the assistance of Asp-120(103) (following BBL numbering), 2In this paper, the amino acid residues of IMP-1 and its mutants are designated with the BBL number and amino acid sequence number by putting the latter in parentheses. which is conserved in all MBLs (20Galleni M.

Yanchak et al. (31Yanchak M.P. Taylor R.A. Crowder M.W. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11330-11339Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar) reported that Asp-120(103) in the active site of CcrA plays a role in generating an intermediate but does not donate a proton to the intermediate during the rate-limiting step in the catalysis. In a quantum chemical study, Díaz et al. (32Díaz N. Suárez D. Merz Jr., K.M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2000; 122: 4197-4208Crossref Scopus (87) Google Scholar) predicted that the Zn2-bound Asp-120 in CcrA could participate as a proton shuttle or proton donor. Moreover, Suárez et al. (33Suárez D. Brothers E.N. Merz Jr., K.M. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 6615-6630Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) proposed that the unprotonated Asp-120 results in the rapid formation of a rigid Zn1-OH-Zn2 linkage, whereas the neutral Asp-120 is compatible with a fluctuating Zn1-Zn2 distance through the breaking and/or formation of the Zn1-OH-Zn2 bridge. To investigate the role of Asp-120(81) in catalysis by IMP-1, we prepared two mutants in which this amino acid is replaced with Ala and Glu, and we carried out a steady-state kinetics study with four β-lactams and pre-steady-state experiments with nitrocefin as a reporter substrate. Moreover, x-ray crystallographic studies of the mutants were performed to elucidate the correlation between the reactivity with respect to the hydrolysis of β-lactams and the coordination structure at the active site. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The blaIMP gene cloned from strain S. marcescens TN9160 was amplified using two primers, IMP-PCR-F (5′-CCgATACAAgAACAACAg-3′) and IMP-PCR-R (5′-gTAgTggCgTgCTgCAAC-3′) (4Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wacharotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). The PCR products of the 1.2-kb DNA fragment were digested with SmaI and subcloned into a vector pKF19k that had been digested with SmaI in advance. The ligated pKF19k was named pKF19k/IMP. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed with the help of a Takara Mutan™-Super Express Kit (Tokyo, Japan) by PCR. The PCRs were performed with the selection primer attached to the kit and mutagenic primers for D120(81)A (5′-CCgTgCTggCgCTAT-3′) and D120(81)E (5′-ATTCCgCCCgTCCTgTCgCTATg-3′). After the PCR products were transformed into Escherichia coli MV1184 cells, the base sequences of the two IMP-1 mutants were confirmed by DNA sequencing by using two primers IMPfor (5′-CggTCTgTAggCTgTAATgC-3′) and IMPrev (5′-TgTggAATTgTgAgCgg-3′). Enzyme Preparation—WT was purified as described previously (4Osano E. Arakawa Y. Wacharotayankun R. Ohta M. Horii T. Ito H. Yoshimura F. Kato N. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1994; 38: 71-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 34Goto M. Yasuzawa H. Higashi T. Yamaguchi Y. Kawanami A. Mifune S. Mori H. Nakayama H. Harada K. Arakawa Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). The mutagenic plasmids were transformed into E. coli JM109. The IMP-1 mutants were also purified according to the procedure of WT with the modification of the conditions as follows. 1) The antibiotic for selection was changed to 50 μg/ml kanamycin. 2) The elution buffers for the SP-Sepharose Fast Flow column and Sephadex G-75 column were Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, 10 μm Zn(NO3)2 for D120(81)A or 100 μm Zn(NO3)2 for D120(81)E). Circular Dichroism—The conservation of secondary structures was observed by CD spectroscopy. The proteins were diluted to a concentration of 1.5 μm in phosphate buffer (10 mm, pH 7.0). The concentrations of WT and the IMP-1 mutants were determined by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm using an extinction coefficient of ϵ280 = 49,000 m-1 cm-1 (34Goto M. Yasuzawa H. Higashi T. Yamaguchi Y. Kawanami A. Mifune S. Mori H. Nakayama H. Harada K. Arakawa Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-720 circular dichrograph (Tokyo, Japan) at 25 °C over 200–250 nm. Metal Contents—Before the analyses of metal content, the buffer used for the protein samples was changed from phosphate buffer (50 mm, pH 7.0) to Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl), and the solution was applied to an Amersham Biosciences PD-10 column (inner diameter, 15 × 50 mm) and eluted with metal-free Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4). Each of the IMP-1 mutants was diluted to give the predetermined protein concentrations (2.0 and 4.0 μm) with 0.2% HNO3. The determination of Zn(II), by atomic absorption, was conducted on a Hitachi Z8000 atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Tokyo, Japan) in the flame mode. Steady-state Kinetic Studies—The hydrolysis of cepharolidine (Δϵ260 = -10,500 m-1 cm-1), imipenem (Δϵ298 = -9,650 m-1 cm-1), nitrocefin (Δϵ491 = 20,000 m-1 cm-1), and benzyl penicillin (Δϵ230 = -1,070 m-1 cm-1) was monitored photometrically at 30 °C in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl). Kinetic experiments were conducted using Hitachi U-1500 (Tokyo, Japan) or Shimadzu UV-2200 UV-visible spectrophotometers (Kyoto, Japan) equipped with thermostated cells. Enzyme parameters Km and kcat were obtained by fitting the data to the Michaelis-Menten equation using a nonlinear regression analysis with KaleidaGraph (Synergy software). Zn(II) Ion Dissociation from the IMP-1 Mutants—The rate of hydrolysis of nitrocefin by the IMP-1 mutants was monitored in varying concentrations of Zn(NO3)2 (0–6000 μm) in acetic acid/sodium acetate buffers (0.2 and 0.5 m NaCl) adjusted to pH 4.4–5.6 as described previously (34Goto M. Yasuzawa H. Higashi T. Yamaguchi Y. Kawanami A. Mifune S. Mori H. Nakayama H. Harada K. Arakawa Y. Biol. Pharm. Bull. 2003; 26: 589-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Buffer solutions were prepared using ultrapure water from Wako (Osaka, Japan). The saturated activity, kmax, and the dissociation constant of Zn(II) ion from the IMP-1 mutants (Equation 1) Kd=[E][Zn]/[E·Zn](Eq. 1) were obtained by fitting vinit to Equation 2 by using a nonlinear regression analysis with KaleidaGraph, υinit=kmax[E]T[Zn]Kd+[Zn]+υ0(Eq. 2) where vinit is the initial velocity; [E]T is the total concentration of enzyme, and v0 is the velocity without the addition of Zn(II) ion. The pH Dependence of Hydrolysis under Conditions of Excess Zn(II)—The pH dependence studies were carried out with MTEN buffer (50 mm Mes, 25 mm Tris, 25 mm 25 mm 2-aminoethanol, 100 mm NaCl) adjusted to pH 5.6–9.0, and with acetic acid/sodium acetate buffers (0.2 and 0.5 m NaCl) adjusted to pH 4.6–5.6. The concentration of Zn(NO3)2 was adjusted to 25 times the Kd at each pH. Before measurement of the rate of hydrolysis of nitrocefin by the IMP-1 mutants, the enzyme solution was preincubated for 10 min at 30 °C in the adjusted buffers. The enzymatic parameters, Km and kcat, were obtained by fitting to the Michaelis-Menten or the Lineweaver-Burk equations. Pre-steady-state Kinetic Studies—Stopped-flow spectrophotometry was carried out with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl and 3.23% Me2SO) on a Photal RA-401 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Otsuka Electronics, Osaka, Japan) at 25 °C. The WT (9 μm) or a IMP-1 mutant was rapidly mixed with nitrocefin (9 μm) followed by monitoring the absorption at 491 nm (formation of nitrocefin product), 391 nm (depletion of nitrocefin), and 650 nm (formation of an assumed intermediate from nitrocefin) (29Wang Z.

Rapid-scan studies were carried out with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm,pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl and 3.23% Me2SO) on Photal RA-415S rapid-scan spectrophotometer at 25 °C. The spectra were collected between 325 and 525 nm and monitored at time intervals of 2 s (gate time 200 ms, and 16 repeats). Spectroscopic Titration of the Nitrocefin Hydrolyzed Product by Hydrochloric Acid and D120(81)E Mutant—A solution of the nitrocefin hydrolysis product was prepared by mixing 100 μl of a Me2SO solution of nitrocefin (1240 μm) and 100 μl of an IMP-1 solution (54.6 μm) with 2.9 ml of Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl) followed by preincubation for 30 min at 30 °C. Spectroscopic titration of the nitrocefin hydrolysis product (10 μm) produced using WT was performed by the stepwise addition of hydrochloric acid (0.2 m) and the D120(81)E mutant (56 μm) in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, and 0.5 m NaCl) at room temperature. Inhibition of D120(81)A Mutant by Anions and Anion Dependence on the Kinetics of the Hydrolysis—The change in the catalytic activity of D120(81)A by the presence of phosphate anion was examined by monitoring the change in absorbance at 491 nm with nitrocefin as a substrate for 5 min at 30 °C in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mm, pH 7.4, 0.5 m NaCl) at various concentrations of phosphate ion. Under the same conditions, the effects of NaClO4, Na2SO4, K3[Co(CN)6], and K4[Fe(CN)6] were also examined. Crystallization—Crystals of the IMP-1 mutants for x-ray crystallography were prepared by the vapor diffusion (hanging drop method), analogous to the method reported by Concha et al. (14Concha N.O. Janson C.A. Rowling P. Pearson S. Cheever C.A. Clarke B.P. Lewis C. Galleni M. Frère J.-M. Payne D.J. Bateson J.H. Abdel-Meguid S.S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 4288-4298Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). The drops were prepared by mixing 5 μl of protein solution (10 mg/ml in 20 mm Hepes-NaOH, pH 7.5) and 5 μl of reservoir solution containing 0.2 m sodium acetate, 0.1 m sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.5, 30% PEG 4000 against 500 μl of reservoir solution. The crystals grew as thin plates after ∼3 weeks at 20 °C. X-ray Data Collection and Processing—All diffraction data were collected at 100 K without additional cryoprotectants. The data sets for D120(81)A and D120(81)E were collected at the SPring-8 on beamline 40B2 and 41XU (Harima, Japan) at 2.0 and 3.0 Å resolutions with a wavelength of λ = 1.00 and 0.98 Å, respectively. The data for the both crystals were integrated, merged, and scaled using HKL2000 (36Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38573) Google Scholar). Structure Determination, Model Building, and Refinement—The structure of IMP-1 complexed with the inhibitor from P. aeruginosa at 2.0 Å resolution (PDB code 1DD6) (14Concha N.O. Janson C.A.

Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1994; 50: 157-163Crossref Scopus (5029) Google Scholar). The CNS software program was used to refine the structures by positional and B-factor refinement (38Brünger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kruszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16967) Google Scholar). The interactive graphics program O was used to build the structures of the IMP-1 mutants (39Jones T.A. Zou J.-Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13011) Google Scholar). Topology and parameter files of oxidized Cys were utilized in the HIC-UP (x-ray.bmc.uu.se/hicup) (40Kleywegt G.J. Jones T.A. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 1119-1131Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant Plasmids and the Mutation of Asp-120(81)—Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out with Pfu Turbo™ polymerase using pKF19k/IMP as a template. The CD spectra of the IMP-1 mutants showed the same pattern as that for WT between 250 and 200 nm, indicating that no major structural change occurred as the result of mutation (data not shown). The Zn(II) contents of the D120(81)A and D120(81)E mutants were 2.2 and 2.3 per enzyme molecule, respectively, as determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy. A smaller binding affinity had been expected, but the replacement of Asp-120(81) with Ala or Glu did not significantly change the affinity of the protein for Zn(II) ion. Steady-state Kinetics of Substrate Hydrolysis—The Km and kcat values for the hydrolysis of four β-lactams, cephaloridine, imipenem, nitrocefin, and benzyl penicillin, which are catalyzed by WT and the IMP-1 mutants, are shown in Table I. The inclusion of 1 mm Zn(NO3)2 in the buffer resulted in a slight change in Km and kcat. For all substrates measured, the IMP-1 mutants exhibited a reduced kcat compared with WT. D120(81)A and D120(81)E exhibited the kcat values that were 25–41,000 times and 40–1750 times lower than those of WT, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2119485359,"The magnitude and temporal nature of intracellular signaling cascades can now be visualized directly in single cells by the use of protein domains tagged with enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP). In this study, signaling downstream of G protein-coupled receptor-mediated phospholipase C (PLC) activation has been investigated in a cell line coexpressing recombinant M3 muscarinic acetylcholine and α1B -adrenergic receptors. Confocal measurements of changes in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P3), using the pleckstrin homology domain of PLCδ1 tagged to eGFP (eGFP-PHPLCδ), and 1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG), using the C1 domain of protein kinase Cγ (PKCγ) (eGFP-C12-PKCγ), demonstrated clear translocation responses to methacholine and noradrenaline. Single cell EC50 values calculated for each agonist indicated that responses to downstream signaling targets (Ca2+ mobilization and PKC activation) were approximately 10-fold lower compared with respective Ins(1,4,5)P3 and DAG EC50 values. Examining the temporal profile of second messenger responses to sub-EC50 concentrations of noradrenaline revealed oscillatory Ins(1,4,5)P3, DAG, and Ca2+ responses. Oscillatory recruitments of conventional (PKCβII) and novel (PKCϵ) PKC isoenzymes were also observed which were synchronous with the Ca2+ response measured simultaneously in the same cell. However, oscillatory PKC activity (as determined by translocation of eGFP-tagged myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate protein) required oscillatory DAG production. We suggest a model that uses regenerative Ca2+ release via Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors to initiate oscillatory second messenger production through a positive feedback effect on PLC. By acting on various components of the PLC signaling pathway the frequency-encoded Ca2+ response is able to maintain signal specificity at a level downstream of PKC activation."

Here, we report the crystal structure of hVps29p at 2.1 Å resolution, the first three-dimensional structure of the retromer subunits. This novel structure adopts a four-layered α-β-β-α sandwich fold. hVps29p contains a metal-binding site that is very similar to the active sites of some proteins of the phosphodiesterase/nuclease protein family, indicating that hVps29p may carry out chemically similar functions. Structure and sequence conservation analysis suggests that hVps29p contains two protein-protein interaction sites. One site, which potentially serves as the interface between hVps29p and hVps35p, comprises 5 conserved hydrophobic and 8 hydrophilic residues.

To function properly for the organelles in eukaryotic cells, it is necessary that specific sets of proteins and lipids are sorted and delivered to various intracellular compartments efficiently. The trafficking of proteins and lipids between intracellular organelles requires a series of proteins that are involved in the membrane transport pathways (1Novick P. Zerial M. Curr. Opin.

The products of these Vps genes are involved directly or indirectly in protein sorting or trafficking between the late Golgi and the vacuoles (4Bankaitis V.A. Johnson L.M. Emr S.D. Proc. Natl. Acad.

As a vacuolar hydrolase, CPY is recognized by Vps10p in the late Golgi. Vps10p binds to CPY and conveys it via vesicle to the prevacuolar compartment where Vps10p releases it. After that, Vps10p returns to the Golgi for further rounds of transportation. Some yeast Vps gene products, Vps26p, Vps29p, Vps35p, Vps5p, and Vps17p, are necessary for the retrograde retrieval process of Vps10p from endosomes back to the trans-Golgi network (7Horazdovsky B.F.

As a necessary component of the retromer complex, Vps29p directly binds to Vps35p but not to cargo proteins. Vps29p possibly assists Vps35p to bind to cargo proteins by enhancing its association with membranes and/or with other retromer proteins (10Seaman M.N.J. McCaffery J.M. Emr S.D. J.

These data suggest that hVps29p not only serves as a subunit of the retromer complex but also carries out other biological roles (17Haft C.R. Sierra M. Bafford R. Lesniak M.A. Barr V.A. Taylor S.I.

Based on the structural and sequence analysis, two conserved surface regions are proposed to serve as binding sites for hVps35p and other target proteins, respectively.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning, Expression, and Purification—The complete cDNA encoding hVps29p (accession number NM_016226) was subcloned from a human brain cDNA library (BD Biosciences) into pET-22b vector (Novagen) with the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. hVps29p was expressed highly as a soluble protein in Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3) cells, induced by isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 37 °C. The harvested cells were resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 4 °C, supplemented with DNase I and lysozyme, and lysed by sonication, and the soluble lysate was applied to DEAE-Sepharose™ Fast Flow (Amersham Biosciences). The protein was eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl from 0 to 120 mm. Fractions containing hVps29p were pooled and then further purified by gel filtration (Superdex 75, Amersham Biosciences) in a buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 80 mm NaCl. The peak fractions were concentrated to 15 mg/ml and stored at –70 °C.To prepare the SeMet-derivative protein, hVps29p was expressed in E. coli strain B834 (Novagen) using M9 medium supplemented with SeMet and 6 amino acids, including leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, lysine, and threonine. The SeMet-derivative protein was purified by similar procedure to the wild-type protein.Crystallization and Data Collection—Crystals of both the wild-type and the SeMet-derivative proteins of hVps29p were grown using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at room temperature. The initial crystallization conditions were screened by the sparse matrix sampling method using Crystal Screen I and II (Hampton Research). The crystals suitable for x-ray diffraction were grown in 25% polyethylene glycol 4000, 10% ethylene glycol, and 100 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, with a protein concentration of 3 mg/ml in 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5.A MAD data set was collected from a single crystal of SeMet-derivative protein at 100 K without additional cryoprotectant on beamline 3W1A of the Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility at the Institute of High Energy Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The data were collected at two wavelengths (λpeak = 0.9814 Å and λedge = 0.9817 Å). The MAD data were processed using MOSFILM (25Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Nature. 1992; 355: 472-474Crossref PubMed Scopus (3849) Google Scholar). The stereochemistry of the structure was checked by PROCHECK (34Laskowski R.A. McArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar). Figures were prepared using PyMOL and GRASP (35Nicholls A. Sharp K.A. Honing B. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1991; 11: 281-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (5313) Google Scholar). MAD phasing and model refinement statistics are shown in Table I.RESULTSStructure Solution and Model Quality—The hVps29p crystal structure was phased by MAD with SeMet-substituted protein and refined against the diffraction data of native protein crystal. The current model consists of 180 amino acids (residues 1–92 and 95–182) and 48 water molecules. Due to conformational disorder, Trp-93 and Gly-94 are invisible in the electron density and therefore not included in the final model. Moreover, side chains of 5 residues, i.e. Lys-21, Asp-47, Ile-91, Lys-118, and Lys-180, show weak electron density. The final model was refined to 2.1 Å with free R-factor of 24.4% and crystallographic R-factor of 21.8%. The r.m.s.d. from ideal values of bond lengths and bond angles were 0.009 Å and 1.774°, respectively. Of all the residues in the final refined model, 87.3% have main chain torsion angles in the most favored regions and only one residue, His-115, which can be well defined in the experimental electron density, is in a disallowed region. Data collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table I.Structure Overview—hVps29p, an approximately spherical molecule with dimensions of 36 × 42 × 44 Å comprises two β sheets (five-stranded and six-stranded) and three α helices (α1, α2, and α3), adopting a four-layered α-β-β-α sandwich fold (Fig. 2A). The five-stranded β sheet that is flanked by one helix (α3) consists of strands β4-β8, and β4 and β7 are antiparallel to the other three strands. In a similar manner, the six-stranded β sheet, flanked by two α helices (α1 and α2), consists of strands β1-β3 and β9-β11, with β9 and β11 antiparallel to the other four strands. The interfaces between layers in the α-β-β-α sandwich are mainly formed by tightly packed hydrophobic side chains.Fig. 2Overall structure of hVps29p.A, a stereo view of hVps29p.

The purple arrow represents the negatively charged groove.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)There is only one hVps29p molecule in the asymmetric unit, and the crystallographic contact between molecules involves very limited interactions, which seem unlikely to be physiological. Size exclusion chromatography and dynamic light scattering experiments confirmed the presence of hVps29p as a monomer in solution (data not shown). These data imply that the monomer of hVps29p may be a stable and functional unit in solution.The electrostatic potential surface of hVps29p displays prominent asymmetry. As shown in Fig. 2B, a negatively charged groove stretches along one side of the molecule. The 11 amino acids at the groove, including Asp-8, Glu-44, Asp-62, Asp-64, Glu-65, Glu-71, Asp-95, Glu-120, Glu-143, Asp-170, and Asp-171, contribute the negative charge of the surface. Most of these amino acids are highly conserved (Fig. 1), suggesting that the negative groove may be a feature of Vps29p homologs.Comparison of Sequence and Structural Homologs—A Pfam (36Bateman A.

Nucleic Acids Res. 2002; 30: 276-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (2005) Google Scholar) annotation suggests that hVps29p belongs to a family of Calcineurin-like related phosphoesterase. This family contains many kinds of phosphoesterases, such as phosphoserine phosphatases, nucleotidases, sphingomyelin phosphodiesterases, 2′-3′-cyclic AMP phosphodiesterases, and nucleases. A BLAST search reveals a large number of homologs of hVps29p. Besides the proteins from C. elegans, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plants, insects, and mammalians (Fig. 1), the homologs of Vps29p are also found in one thermophilic bacterium (Thermatoga maritime) and several species of Archaea (Methanococcus jannaschii, Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, Pyrococcus abyssi, and Pyrococcus horikoshii), suggesting that they are ancient proteins and perform essential biological functions (17Haft C.R.

Except for the two hypothetical proteins, 1NNW and 1UF3, the other proteins perform molecular functions that are chemically similar (phosphodiesterase, phosphatase, nuclease, or nucleotidase). These enzymes adopt the common sandwich fold, and the metal-chelating residues involved in enzymatic activity are also conserved.The Metal-binding Site of hVps29p—Based on the structural comparison with these enzymes, we determined that the presumed metal ion-binding site of hVps29p is located at the highly negatively charged groove and formed by a cluster of turn/loop regions among β1/α1, β2/α2, β3/β4, β5/α3, β6/β7, and β8/β9 (Fig. 2, A and B). The residues, which are proposed to be involved in metal binding, include Asp-8, His-10, Arg-14, Asn-39, Asp-62, His-86, His-115, His-117, and Asn-140.hVps29p shares similar fold and overall structure with MJ0936 (Fig. 3A), a kind of phosphodiesterase of M. jannaschii (41Hopfner K.P. Karcher A. Craig L. Woo T.T. Carney J.P. Tainer J.A. Cell. 2001; 105: 473-485Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). Some ions, such as Mn2+, are necessary for the enzyme activity of MJ0936. The di-Mn2+-binding sites of MJ0936 show great resemblance to the presumed metal-binding site of hVps29p. The corresponding residues at the metal-binding site (hVps29p:MJ0936) are: Asp-8:Asp-8, His-10: His-10, Asn-39: Asp-36, Asp-62:Asn-59, Phe-63:Gln-60, His-86:His-97, His-115: His-120 and His-117:His-122, respectively (Fig. 3B). In addition, Arg-14 and Asn-140 of hVps29p are highly hydrophilic and may also be involved in metal binding. Although Phe-63 of hVps29p locates at a similar position to Gln-60 of MJ0936, the phenylalanine apparently cannot bind to metal ions. Residues of the presumed metal-binding site of hVps29p also show similar architecture to those of purple acid phosphatase (PDB code 1UTE) and mre11 nuclease (PDB code 1II7) (42Kissinger C.R. Parge H.E. Knighton D.R. Lewis C.T. Pelletier L.A. Tempczyk A. Kalish V.J. Tucker K.D. Showalter R.E. Moomaw E.W. Nature. 1995; 378: 641-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (690) Google Scholar, 44Knöfel T. Sträter N. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To carry out the enzymatic function, one Fe3+ and one Fe2+ are necessary for purple acid phosphatase, and two Mn2+ are necessary for mre11 nuclease. Thus, it is proposed that the nine hydrophilic residues of hVps29p may harbor suitable metal ion(s) at this site. In fact, we found that hVps29p can bind to some metal ions (such as Fe3+ and Ni2+) in solution (data not shown). However, the experimental electron density map does not indicate the presence of any metal ion in the crystal structure of hVps29p, although many kinds of metal ions were soaked and co-crystallized. The crystallization environment may interfere with the incorporation of metal ions.Fig. 3Presumed metal-binding site of hVps29p.A, the superposition of hVps29p (cyan) and MJ0936 (gray, PDB code 1S3N).

https://openalex.org/W2046762506,"Collagen type I is composed of three polypeptide chains transcribed from two separate genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) with different promoters requiring coordinate regulation. Our recent publications, centering on COL1A2 regulation, demonstrate that methylation in the first exon of COL1A2 at a regulatory factor for X box (RFX) site (at –1 to +20) occurs in human cancer cells and correlates with increased RFX1 binding and decreased collagen transcription (Sengupta, P. K., Erhlich, M., and Smith, B. D. (1999) J. Biol. Chem. 274, 36649–36655; Sengupta, S., Smith, E. M., Kim, K., Murnane, M. J., and Smith, B. D. (2003) Cancer Res. 63, 1789–1797). In normal cells, RFX5 complex along with major histocompatibility class II transactivator (CIITA) is induced by interferon-γ to occupy this site and repress collagen transcription (Xu, Y., Wang, L., Buttice, G., Sengupta, P. K., and Smith, B. D. (2004) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 41319–41332). In this paper, we demonstrate that COL1A1 has an RFX consensus binding site surrounding the transcription start site (–11 to +10) that contains three methylation sites rather than one in the COL1A2 gene RFX binding site. RFX1 interacts weakly with the unmethylated COL1A1 site, and binds with higher affinity to the methylated site. RFX1 represses the unmethylated COL1A1 less efficiently than COL1A2. COL1A1 promoter activity is sensitive to DNA methylation and the COL1A1 gene is methylated in human cancer cells with coordinately decreased collagen expression. The DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (aza-dC) increases collagen gene expression with time in human cancer cells. On the other hand, RFX5 interacts with both collagen type I genes with a similar binding affinity and represses both promoters equally in transient transfections. Two dominant negative forms of RFX5 activate both collagen genes coordinately. Finally, CIITA RNA interference experiments indicate that CIITA induction is required for interferon γ-mediated repression of both collagen type I genes.

Finally, CIITA RNA interference experiments indicate that CIITA induction is required for interferon γ-mediated repression of both collagen type I genes. Collagen, a major extracellular matrix component, plays a significant role influencing cell behavior and maintaining tissue structure (1Hirtenlehne K. Pec M. Kubista E. Singer C.F. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 2002; 13: 234-240PubMed Google Scholar). Type I collagen, the most abundant member of the collagen family, is composed of two identical α1(I) polypeptide chains and a similar, but distinct polypeptide chain designated α2(I). Collagen expression is controlled in a developmental and tissue-specific manner. In adult tissue, type I gene expression is largely inactivated, but stimulated after injury. The two type I collagen genes (COL1A1 and COL1A2) are within separate chromosomes with different regulatory sequences in their promoters, yet they need to be regulated coordinately to ensure proper function. Synthesis of collagen by cells in culture is down-regulated upon oncogenic transformation with viruses or chemical carcinogens (2Adams S.L. Sobel M.E. Howard B.H. Olden K.

Niles R. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 1820-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) that collagen α2(I) is not expressed in a tumorigenic cell line, W8, after treatment of the parental liver epithelial-like cell line, K16, with the carcinogen 2-N-(acetoxyacetyl)-aminofluorine. Analysis of genomic DNA isolated from W8 cells revealed that the promoter-5′ region of the α2(I) gene, COL1A2, was methylated (6Smith B.D. Marsilio E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Furthermore, reporter constructs containing the COL1A2 promoter region (218 bp), as well as the first exon (54 bp) of the COL1A2 gene, were inactivated by DNA methylation in transient transfection experiments and in vitro transcription assays (6Smith B.D. Marsilio E. Biochem. J. 1988; 253: 269-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 7Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). The inhibition of reporter gene expression was attributable to CpG methylation within the first exon surrounding the transcription start site of the COL1A2 gene. Finally, the collagen transcription start site (–1to +20) contains a low affinity-binding site for the regulatory factor for X box (RFX) family (8Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol.

The binding affinity of RFX1 is increased if the CpG site at +7 is methylated or mutated to thymidine on the coding strand. RFX1 is a member of the RFX family of closely related proteins, RFX1–4 (10Emery P. Durand B. Mach B. Reith W.

Other components of the RFX5 complex, RFXB and RFXAP, contribute to repression of COL1A2 gene expression (15Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol.

RFX5 and CIITA play an important role inducing major histocompatability class II (MHC II) gene expression and are induced in fibroblasts by Ifn-γ (17Villard J. Masternak K. Lisowska-Grospierre B.

Because our published studies to date center on the COL1A2 gene, it was important to determine whether the COL1A1 gene is regulated in a similar manner. In this publication, we demonstrate that the α1(I) gene, COL1A1, is also methylated in human cancer cells and this methylation occurs, in most cases, coordinately with the COL1A2 gene. In addition, the COL1A1 gene contains a methylation specific binding site for the RFX family at the transcription start site farther upstream than in the COL1A2 gene. The RFX proteins bind to both genes and act as repressors, but do so with different binding affinities and transcriptional activities. Human lung fibroblasts, IMR-90, (IMR, NJ), fibrosarcoma cells (HT1080, American Type Culture Collection), hepatocarcinoma cells (SNU387, SNU398, SNU449, PLC/PRF/5), and breast epithelial carcinoma cells (Hs578T) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Hyclone). Media for Hs578T contained additional insulin (1 μg/ml). A second breast carcinoma cell line (MCF-7) was maintained in high glucose Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium. The colon cancer cell line (HCT116) was maintained in McCoys medium. The IMR-90 cell line was used for transfection studies. Prior to transfection, cells were plated in 6-well culture plates at a density of 3 × 105 per well and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for 16–24 h. Transfections were performed using Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Three hours after transfection, cells were transferred to DMEM with 10% FBS and harvested 24 h later. Cells were then lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and luciferase activities were assayed using a luciferase reporter assay system (Promega). Luciferase activity was normalized for total protein and transfection efficiency. Transfection efficiency was monitored by fluorescent readings for the co-transfected GFP construct (0.1 μg). Experiments were routinely performed in duplicate plates. The ratio of experimental to control (reporter plasmid with empty vector) × 100 was calculated for each experiment with the control values set at 100. Values from three or more experiments were averaged and presented in this paper. In several studies IMR-90 cells were treated with Ifn-γ. IMR-90 fibroblasts were plated in p35 tissue culture dishes at 4 × 105 cells/dish for mRNA studies and maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS for 16–24 h. Cells were pretreated in DMEM with 0.4% FBS for 16 h prior to Ifn-γ treatment with 100 units/ml in 0.4% DMEM for 24 h. HT1080 cells were plated at 250,000 cells per p35-mm well plate and treated with 1 μm 5-aza-2′-deoxycytidine (aza-dC) daily for 0, 1, 2, or 3 days before harvesting. The COL1A1 promoter plasmids were all cloned into a pGL2-luciferase vector from the –804hCOL1-luc plasmid described previously (19Widom R.L. Lee J.Y. Joseph C. Gordon-Froome I. Korn J.H. Matrix Biol. 2001; 20: 451-462Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). All constructs have the exact same 3′ end as the –804hCOL1-Luc (+114). The –311COL1-luc was constructed using exonuclease III digestion. First, –804COL1-Luc was digested with KpnI and XhoI (both cut upstream of –804) to linearize the plasmid. Then the plasmid was treated with exonuclease III followed by mung bean nuclease to remove single-stranded ends. The resulting DNA was self-ligated to recircularize –311COL1-Luc. The –112COL1-Luc construct was amplified by PCR using a 20-nucleotide primer at –112 and a luciferase primer (GL2 primer from Promega) downstream. The PCR product was cloned into pCR2.1 by TA cloning. The fragment was then excised with KpnI and HindIII and cloned into pGL2basic. These constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. In some experiments, plasmids were methylated by Sss1 methylase using the manufacturer's recommendations (New England Biolabs, Inc.) as described previously (7Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1443: 75-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Unmethylated plasmids were incubated in the reaction mixture with S-adenosylmethionine and purified in the same way as the methylated plasmids. In several experiments, full-length expression constructs for RFX1, FLAG-RFX5, FLAG-RFXB/ANK, FLAG-CIITA, and His-RFXAP constructs were co-transfected with collagen reporter constructs as described previously (8Sengupta P.K.

Shastry B.S. Roeder R.G. Methods Enzymol. 1983; 101: 582-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar) with some modifications. Extractions of protein from isolated nuclei were performed at higher salt conditions than normal using 500 or 420 mm NaCl rather than 350 mm NaCl in buffer C. All buffers contained the protease inhibitors leupeptin (40 μg/ml), aprotinin (200 μg/ml), pepstatin A (40 μg/ml), and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (0.5 mm) as well as the phosphatase inhibitor orthovanadate (1 mm). Protein concentration of the extracts was determined by the Bradford reagent using bovine serum albumin as a standard. Collagen sequences or MDBP/RFX consensus sequences (Table I) with HindIII overhangs were synthesized (Oligo Etc.; CT and Integrated DNA Technology) as complementary strands, annealed to make double-stranded oligonucleotides, and radiolabeled using the [α-32P]dATP and the Klenow fragment to fill in the HindIII overhang. For DNA mobility shift assay, the binding reaction was performed for 30 min at room temperature in 20 μl of binding buffer containing 90,000–100,000 cpm/200 fmol of labeled probe, 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC) and nuclear extract containing 4.5–5.0 μg of protein. Double-stranded annealed complementary oligonucleotides for mpBr322 (Oligo Etc., CT and Integrated DNA Technology) were used as competitors. Separation of free radiolabeled DNA from DNA-protein complexes was carried out on a 4–5% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel with a standard Tris borate electrophoresis buffer at 300 V in the cold (4 °C). Autoradiography was performed by overnight exposure to Kodak Biomax film (Eastman Kodak Co.). The intensities of the bands were quantified using Instant Imager (Packard Instrument Co.).Table IProbes for gel shift analysisGeneα1(I) -11 to +10α1(1) Promoter first exon sequenceaagcttAGTCGTCGGAGCAGACGGGAGTCAGCAGCCTCGTCTGCCCTCttcgaaα2(I) -1 to +20aSequences reported by Sengupta et al.

Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1789-1797PubMed Google Scholar). The bisulfite modification causes unmethylated cytosines (Cs) to be converted to uracil. Methylated cytosines are resistant to deamination. PCR was used to amplify the modified DNA replacing uracil residues with thymine. Primers were designed using a converted sequence (Cs to Ts) in a region that did not contain any possible CpG methylation sites. Separate primers were designed to amplify the coding strand (–65 to +151) or the template strand (–71 to +144) (see Table II). The PCR product was separated on 2% low melting agarose gel and purified using the Qiaquick Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).Table IIBisulfite modified primers for PCR and MS-SNuPE assayNamePosition5′-3′ SequenceaThe PCR and MS-SNuPE primers are the predicted bisulfite converted collagen bases based on COL1A2 sequences in the GenBank (accession number AF004877).

Open table in a new tab Methylation-sensitive Single Nucleotide Primer Extension (MS-SNuPE) Assay—For determining methylation at individual sites, we used MS-SNuPE (22Gonzalgo M.L. Jones P.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 2529-2531Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). This method established whether the nucleotide at +7 remained a C (methylated) residue or has been converted to T (unmethylated) as described previously (8Sengupta P.K. Fargo J. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 24926-24937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 21Sengupta S. Smith E.M. Kim K. Murnane M.J. Smith B.D. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 1789-1797PubMed Google Scholar). The MS-SNuPE primers are in Table I and their relationship to the collagen gene is diagrammed in Fig. 1A. The reaction mixture contained gel-purified PCR fragments, primers, 1× Taq polymerase buffer, and 1 μCi of radiolabeled [32P]dCTP or dTTP to identify methylated or unmethylated residues, respectively, for coding strand, and [32P]dGTP or dATP to identify methylated or unmethylated residues, respectively, for template strand (Promega). After denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, the primers were annealed at 40 °C for 2 min (template strand) or 50 °C for 2 min (coding strand), and extended at 72 °C for 1 min with Taq polymerase (1 unit) (Promega). The reaction was stopped by addition of 10 μl of stop buffer. The reaction products were heated at 95 °C for 2 min before loading onto a 15% acrylamide, 7 m urea gel. The radioactivity of the specific bands was quantified by a Packard Instant Imager (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and pictured by autoradiography. The percent of methylation was calculated by dividing the amount of radiolabeled dCTP or dGTP incorporated into the primer by the total radioactivity multiplied by 100. Construction of Dominant Negative Clones in Lentivirus Vectors— The wild type RFX5 and the two dominant negative constructs, RFX5Δ1 and RFX5Δ5, were amplified from the original pcDNA3 vectors (23DeSandro A.M. Nagarajan U.M. Boss J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 6587-6599Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) and cloned into pLenti6/V5-D-TOPO vector using a directional TOPO cloning kit (Invitrogen). Constructs were sequenced to be sure there were no mutations, deletions, or extra bases. Three different reverse primers were designed by RNAi oligo retriever program on Cold Spring Harbor web site (http://katahdin.cshl.org:9331/RNAi/html/rnai.html) and cloned into pLenti6-V5-TOPO vectors as previously described (16Xu Y. Wang L. Buttice G. Sengupta P.K. Smith B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 41319-41332Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A pGEM1-U6 vector was used as the template to clone U6 promoter driving short hairpin RNA (shRNA). PCR were performed by 95 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min followed by one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. PCR products were separated on 1% agarose gel, sliced from gel, purified by a Qiagen gel extraction kit, and ligated into pLenti6-V5-TOPO vector using a Viralpower directional cloning kit. Ligation products were transformed into TOP10 competent cells and positive clones were screened by restriction digestion and direct sequencing. Viral packaging cells (293FT, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, and 500 μg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen). The lentiviral stock was prepared by transfecting our constructs (RFX5, RFX5Δ1, and RFX5Δ5) or three shRNA clones as well as a LacZ construct expressing β-galactosidase plus an empty TOPO vector along with ViralPower packaging mixture into 293FT cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen). After 48–72 h, viruses containing supernatants were harvested, centrifuged, and stored in 1-ml aliquots. Titers of lentiviral stocks were performed according to the manufacturer's protocol using HT1080 cells to determine the number of virus particles. IMR-90 cells were infected with virus at the multiplicity of infection of 1. Cells were treated with or without 100 units/ml Ifn-γ for an additional 24 h before harvesting. Proteins were extracted using RIPA buffer (1× phosphate-buffered saline, 0.1% SDS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel followed by Western blot. RNAs were extracted and analyzed as described in the following section. Cells were harvested and RNA was extracted using an RNeasy RNA isolation kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcriptase reactions were performed using a SuperScript First-strand Synthesis System (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's protocol. Real-time PCR were performed on ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection PCR machine (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol.

The protein concentration was determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad). Proteins in extracts were separated by 10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with pre-stained markers (Bio-Rad) for estimating molecular weight and efficiency of transfer to blots. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) in a Mini-Trans Blot Cell (Bio-Rad). The membranes were blocked with 5% milk powder in Tris-buffered saline (TBST) (0.05% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4) buffer at 4 °C overnight and incubated for 3 h with monoclonal anti-V5 (1:1000) (Sigma), monoclonal anti-β-actin (1:1,000) (Sigma), or monoclonal anti-CIITA (1:100) (7–1H, Santa Cruz) as indicated. After 3 washes with TBST, the membranes were incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies, anti-mouse IgG (1:1000) (Amersham Biosciences) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, for another 1 h at room temperature. Then protein blots were visualized using ECL reagent (Pierce) on a Kodak Image station (Kodak). RFX Proteins Interact with the COL1A1 Site (–11 to +6) at the Transcription Start Site with Different Affinity Than COL1A2—As stated in the Introduction, most of our previous studies indicate that the RFX family represses the collagen α2(I) gene, COL1A2. The collagen α1(I) gene, COL1A1, is homologous to the α2(I) gene mainly in the first 20 bases and surrounding the TATA sequence (Fig. 1A). Therefore, we hypothesized that RFX1 would bind to the first 20 bases of the homologous gene. To our surprise, RFX1 did not form a high affinity complex on this α1(I) sequence with or without methylation (Fig. 1B) and the first 20 bases of α1(I) did not compete with the RFX1 complex on the α2(I) sequence at 50- or 20-fold molar excess (data not shown). However, there is a site upstream in the α1(I) gene, between –11 and +6 (Fig. 1A, underlined), that is a closer match to the RFX consensus sequence. Therefore, proteins binding to oligos at both α1(I) sites were compared with proteins binding to the α2(I)-binding site (Fig. 1B). There was no complex formation on the α1(I)"

Disease-associated mutations in Aprataxin target a histidine triad domain that is similar to Hint, a universally conserved AMP-lysine hydrolase, or truncate the protein NH2-terminal to a zinc finger. With novel fluorigenic substrates, we demonstrate that Aprataxin possesses an active-site-dependent AMP-lysine and GMP-lysine hydrolase activity that depends additionally on the zinc finger for protein stability and on the forkhead associated domain for enzymatic activity. Alleles carrying any of eight recessive mutations associated with ataxia and oculomotor apraxia encode proteins with huge losses in protein stability and enzymatic activity, consistent with a null phenotype. The mild presentation allele, APTX-K197Q, associated with ataxia but not oculomotor apraxia, encodes a protein with a mild defect in stability and activity, while enzyme encoded by the atypical presentation allele, APTX-R199H, retained substantial function, consistent with altered and not loss of activity. The data suggest that the essential function of Aprataxin is reversal of nucleotidylylated protein modifications, that all three domains contribute to formation of a stable enzyme, and that the in vitro behavior of cloned APTX alleles can score disease-associated mutations.

DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1187-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar)), cultured aptx-mutant cells do not exhibit defects in ATM signaling or radioresistant DNA synthesis (11Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Moreira M.C. Taylor A.M. Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). The potential relationships between other biochemical pathways, such as coenzyme Q deficiency (13Shults C.W. Curr. Med. Chem. 2003; 10: 1917-1921Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) or glycogen synthase 3 signaling (14Kaytor M.D. Orr H.T. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2002; 12: 275-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar), and Aprataxin function has not been investigated. HIT domains, named for a motif related to His-ϕ-His-ϕ-His-ϕ-ϕ, where ϕ is a hydrophobic amino acid, are found in a superfamily of nucleotide hydrolases and nucleotide transferases that includes the universally conserved Hint enzyme, the Fhit tumor suppressor protein, and galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase (15Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Contrary to assertion (2Date H. Onodera O. Tanaka H. Iwabuchi K. Uekawa K. Igarashi S. Koike R. Hiroi T. Yuasa T. Awaya Y. Sakai T. Takahashi T. Nagatomo H. Sekijima Y. Kawachi I. Takiyama Y. Nishizawa M. Fukuhara N. Saito K. Sugano S. Tsuji S. Nat.

Whereas Fhit-homologous enzymes hydrolyze diadenosine polyphosphates such as ApppA and AppppA into mononucleotides (18Barnes L.D. Garrison P.N. Siprashvili Z. Guranowski A. Robinson A.K. Ingram S.W.

Recently, in work to characterize a potential role for Hint hydrolases in regulating sexual differentiation in birds (22Pace H.C. Brenner C. Genome Biol. 2003; 4: R18Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we developed an adenylylated lysine substrate linked to aminomethylcoumarin that allows Hint enzymatic activity, coupled to trypsin cleavage, to produce a bright fluorescent product (23Parks K.P. Seidle H. Wright N. Sperry J.B. Bieganowski P. Howitz K. Wright D.L. Brenner C. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 20: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). In yeast, the enzymatic activity of the Hint homolog, Hnt1, functions as a positive regulator of components of general transcription factor TFIIH (20Bieganowski P. Garrison P.N. Hodawadekar S.C. Faye G. Barnes L.D. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 10852-10860Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In Escherichia coli, the Hint-homologous hinT gene is required for resistance to elevated levels of certain salts (24Chou T.F. Bieganowski P. Shilinski K. Cheng J. Brenner C. Wagner C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15356-15361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Although specific protein targets remain to be identified, it has been hypothesized that Hint hydrolases may reverse nucleotidylylated protein modifications of lysine (15Brenner C. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 9003-9014Crossref PubMed Scopus (243) Google Scholar). Two specific models linking Aprataxin inactivation to disease have been proposed. According to the first model, diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolysis is required for DNA repair (2Date H. Onodera O. Tanaka H. Iwabuchi K. Uekawa K. Igarashi S. Koike R. Hiroi T. Yuasa T. Awaya Y. Sakai T. Takahashi T. Nagatomo H. Sekijima Y. Kawachi I. Takiyama Y. Nishizawa M. Fukuhara N. Saito K. Sugano S. Tsuji S. Nat. Genet. 2001; 29: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). However, because intact, purified Aprataxin was reported to be devoid of diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolase activity (16Hirano M. Furiya Y. Kariya S. Nishiwaki T. Ueno S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2004; 322: 380-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar), and there is no known connection between diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolysis and DNA repair, this model appears to be unlikely. According to the second model, Aprataxin stabilizes Xrcc1 by a physical association between phosphorylated Xrcc1 and the FHA domain of Aprataxin (25Luo H. Chan D.W. Yang T. Rodriguez M. Chen B.P. Leng M. Mu J.J. Chen D. Songyang Z. Wang Y. Qin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8356-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). This model appears to be undermined by the lack of x-ray sensitivity of aptx fibroblasts (11Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Moreira M.C. Taylor A.M. Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar) and the fact that disease-associated mutations in APTX do not alter the ability of Aprataxin to associate with Xrcc1 (25Luo H. Chan D.W. Yang T. Rodriguez M. Chen B.P. Leng M. Mu J.J. Chen D. Songyang Z. Wang Y. Qin J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 8356-8365Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that Aprataxin possesses an intrinsic, active site-dependent AMP-lysine and GMP-lysine hydrolase activity. AMP-lysine hydrolase activity on a model substrate was also greatly reduced by expression of Aprataxin without the NH2-terminal FHA domain and eliminated by truncation of the zinc finger domain, indicating that all three domains contribute to formation of a stable enzyme. Finally, biochemical analysis indicated that eight reported disease-associated alleles are null or nearly null for the Hint active site, while a reported mild presentation allele and an atypical presentation allele can be functionally diagnosed by in vitro stability and activity. Plasmid Construction and Mutagenesis—E. coli strain BL21* and DH10B were used for cloning. Plasmid pB352 and derivatives were used for expression of human APTX (11Clements P.M. Breslin C. Deeks E.D. Byrd P.J. Ju L. Bieganowski P. Brenner C. Moreira M.C. Taylor A.M. Caldecott K.W. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2004; 3: 1493-1502Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis of plasmid pB352 was used to create plasmids to express APTX alleles K197Q, A198V, R199H, P206L, H260A, V263G, D267G, W279R, W279X, 689insT, and 840delT using primers listed in Supplemental Table I. The 168-amino acid Aprataxin coding sequence was produced by adding an NdeI site by site-directed mutagenesis using primer 7779 and amplification by PCR with primers 0720 and 0721. The construct was recovered from ligation of an NdeI and XhoI digestion of the resulting PCR product. All constructs were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Enzyme Expression and Purification—E. coli strain BB2-1 was used for protein expression. BB2-1 was produced by disrupting the E. coli hinT gene in strain BL21* as described (26Datsenko K.A. Wanner B.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6640-6645Crossref PubMed Scopus (11205) Google Scholar). Primers 7024 and 7025 were used for PCR amplification of the chloramphenicol resistance marker of plasmid pKD3. Stable chloramphenicol-resistant transformants of BL21* were tested by PCR with primers 7026 and 7027 to confirm correct recombination of the chloramphenicol resistance marker into the hinT locus. E. coli transfomants carrying APTX expression plasmids were aerated at 24 °C. At an A600 of 0.5, expression was induced with 100 μm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside. Cultures were grown 16 h and harvested by centrifugation. Frozen (–80 °C) and thawed cell pellets (∼5 g wet weight) were lysed using Bugbuster (Novagen) with DNase I and EDTA-free complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science). Clarified lysates were loaded on 1.5 ml Talon columns (Clontech). Aprataxin proteins were eluted with 10 ml of 250 mm imidazole, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7, and concentrated into 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, with 10-kDa cutoff centrifugal concentrators (Amicon). Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and detected using an anti-penta-His antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Qiagen) and SuperSignal West Pico chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce). Enzyme Assays—The fluorigenic substrate t-Boc-LysAMP-MCA was synthesized as described (23Parks K.P. Seidle H. Wright N. Sperry J.B. Bieganowski P. Howitz K. Wright D.L. Brenner C. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 20: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Synthesis of t-Boc-LysGMP-MCA is reported in the supplemental material. t-Boc-LysAMP-MCA and t-Boc-LysGMP-MCA hydrolytic activities were assayed in 25-μl volumes containing 2.5–250 μm substrate, 12 nmol of wild-type enzyme or 12–60 nmol of mutant enzyme, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, for 30–60 min at room temperature. Reactions were initiated by the addition of substrate and stopped by addition of 75 μl of 80 mg/ml trypsin. After a 10-min incubation with trypsin, fluorescence (excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm) was measured with a Wallac 1420 multilabel counter. pH and divalent cation analyses (supplemental material) were completed in 10 mm HEPES, with pH from 6.8 to 8.2. GpppBODIPY hydrolysis was assayed as described previously (19Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Assays were initated by addition of 12 nmol of enzyme and stopped after 30–60 min by the addition of sodium citrate, pH 3. GpppBODIPY concentration ranged between 0 and 25 μm. Dinucleoside polyphosphate hydrolysis assays were performed using 60 nmol of wild-type enzyme with 5–200 μm substrate in a 50-μl volume. Assays were incubated at room temperature for 30 min and stopped by addition of 50 μl of Na2CO3, pH 11.6. 50 μl of the reaction mixture was injected onto a strong anion exchange column (Princeton Chromatography) equilibrated with 10 mm K2HPO4, pH 2.58 (Buffer A) on a Varian Prostar HPLC. The elution program was 100% Buffer A for 10 min, a 2-min gradient to 100% 750 mm K2HPO4, pH 2.58 (Buffer B), and 100% Buffer B for 6 min. Elution times for AMP, ADP, ATP, ApppA, and AppppA were 6.7, 15.3, 16.2, 15.7, and 16.3 min, respectively. Product amounts were determined from the peak areas and a standard curve of AMP using Varian Galaxie Software. Assays to determine divalent cation effects (supplemental material) were completed as described above with the addition of 0.5 mm MgCl2. All assays were performed at least in triplicate. Aprataxin Exhibits AMP- and GMP-Lysine Hydrolase Activity—The 342-amino acid APTX cDNA was fused to an aminoterminal His-tag, and the resulting protein was purified to homogeneity by metal chelate affinity chromatography. The resulting enzyme was assayed for activity with t-Boc-AMPLys-MCA, a model substrate containing an adenylylated lysine (23Parks K.P. Seidle H. Wright N. Sperry J.B. Bieganowski P. Howitz K. Wright D.L. Brenner C. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 20: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), as well as a newly synthesized t-Boc-GMPLys-MCA substrate, and the Fhit substrates GpppBODIPY (19Draganescu A. Hodawadekar S.C. Gee K.R. Brenner C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 4555-4560Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), ApppA, and AppppA (Table I). To avoid contamination by the E. coli Hint hydrolase, wild-type and all mutant APTX constructs were expressed in and purified from E. coli strain BB2, which contains a deletion for the Hint-homologous hinT gene (24Chou T.F.

The enzyme exhibited relatively less Km discrimination between the nucleotide substrates presented to it and, in fact, displayed a preference for the dinucleoside polyphosphates and their analogs (13 to 39 μm) versus substrates containing nucleotidylylated lysines (47 and 116 μm). The relatively high Km values for t-Boc-LysAMP-MCA and t-Boc-LysGMP-MCA did not offset their advantages in the kcat term. As shown in Table I, on the basis of the specificity constant, kcat/Km, Aprataxin is an AMP-lysine hydrolase whose activity is limited by the relatively high Km values of the model peptide substrates presented to it. Metal Independence, Active Site Dependence, FHA Domain Dependence, and pH Dependence of the AMP-Lysine Hydrolase Activity of Aprataxin—Fhit enzymatic activity on dinucleoside polyphosphate substrates is magnesium-dependent (27Huang K. Arabshahi A. Wei Y. Frey P.A. Biochemistry. 2004; 43: 7637-7642Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), but Hint enzymatic activity is metal-independent (23Parks K.P. Seidle H. Wright N. Sperry J.B. Bieganowski P. Howitz K. Wright D.L. Brenner C. Physiol. Genomics. 2004; 20: 12-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Consistent with biochemical similarity to Hint, none of the observed activities on nucleotidylylated lysine substrates or dinucleoside polyphosphate substrates were inhibited by EDTA or stimulated by magnesium (supplemental Fig. 1). We constructed a H260A allele, targeted to the middle His residue of the HIT motif, to determine whether all of the AMP-lysine hydrolase activity is due to the Hint-homologous active site of Aprataxin. As shown in Table II, the H260A substitution eliminates all detectable activity, demonstrating that the AMP-lysine hydrolase activity of Aprataxin depends on the Hint-homologous active site.Table IIEnzymatic activity of expressed APTX transcripts and alleles with t-Boc-LysAMP-MCAEnzymekcatKmkcat/KmTranscript or allele references-1μms-1 m-1Aptx-3420.003 ± 0.000247 ± 964 ± 222Date H.

Although fibrillins and MAGPs covalently associate, we find that the DSL (Delta/Serrate/LAG2) protein Jagged1, an activating ligand for Notch receptor signaling, also interacts with MAGP-2 in both yeast two-hybrid and coimmunoprecipitation studies. Interaction between Jagged1 and MAGP-2 requires the epidermal growth factor-like repeats of Jagged1. MAGP-2 was found complexed with the Jagged1 extracellular domain shed from 293T cells and COS-7 cells coexpressing full-length Jagged1 and MAGP-2. MAGP-2 shedding of the Jagged1 extracellular domain was decreased by the metalloproteinase hydroxamate inhibitor BB3103 implicating proteolysis in its release. Although MAGP-2 also interacted with the other DSL ligands, Jagged2 and Delta1, they were not found associated with MAGP-2 in the conditioned media, identifying differential effects of MAGP-2 on DSL ligand shedding. The related microfibrillar protein MAGP-1 was also found to interact with DSL ligands but, unlike MAGP-2, was unable to facilitate the shedding of Jagged1. Our findings suggest that in addition to its role in microfibrils, MAGP-2 may also affect cellular differentiation through modulating the Notch signaling pathway either by binding to cell surface DSL ligands or by facilitating release and/or stabilization of a soluble extracellular form of Jagged1.

Structural integrity and elastic resilience of tissues that undergo repeated stretch and recoil, including the lung, skin, and large blood vessels in vertebrates, are imparted by extracellular matrix-associated elastic fibers. It is thought that there are two structural components of elastic fibers. The first is an amorphous component entirely made up of the protein elastin. Elastin is deposited on a bed of 10–12-nm microfibrils, which make up the second component.

The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder linked to fibrillin-1 (19Godfrey M. Menashe V. Weleber R.G. Koler R.D. Bigley R.H. Lovrien E. Zonana J. Hollister D.W. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1990; 46: 652-660PubMed Google Scholar) with manifestations that include dilatation and dissection of the aorta, mitral valve prolapse, tall stature, scoliosis, sternal deformities, ectopia lentis, and myopia. Congenital contractural arachnodactyly is linked to fibrillin-2 (20Lee B. Godfrey M. Vitale E. Hori H. Mattei M. Sarfarazi M. Tsipouras P. Ramirez F. Hollister D.W. Nature. 1991; 352: 330-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and involves contractures of the large joints and abnormal pinnae formation.The amino acid similarity between MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 (25%) is limited to a region within the C-terminal half of the protein containing 7 conserved cysteine residues. The N-terminal half of MAGP-2 shares no identity with MAGP-1, contains an RGD motif that has been shown to mediate adhesion and spreading of numerous cell types through the αvβ3 integrin (17Gibson M.A. Leavesley D.I. Ashman L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and perhaps mediates interaction of microfibrils with cell surfaces at specific stages of development and differentiation. We considered that the common functions of MAGP-1 and MAGP-2 are likely mediated through the conserved C-terminal region. Therefore, to identify interacting proteins for MAGP-2, we used MAGP-2 C-terminal sequences as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen (21Penner A.S. Rock M.J. Kielty C.M. Shipley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35044-35049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Known elastic fiber proteins, including fibrillins-1 and -2 as well as fibulin-1, were identified in our screen, validating the use of this assay to identify relevant interacting proteins for MAGP-2.We also identified the DSL 1The abbreviations used are: DSL, Delta/Serrate/LAG2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EGFR, EGF receptor; ECD, extracellular domain; J1HA, Jagged1HA. 1The abbreviations used are: DSL, Delta/Serrate/LAG2; EGF, epidermal growth factor; HA, hemagglutinin; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate; EGFR, EGF receptor; ECD, extracellular domain; J1HA, Jagged1HA. (Delta/Serrate/LAG-2) protein Jagged1 as a putative MAGP-2 interacting protein. Jagged1 belongs to a family of cell-surface, single-pass transmembrane ligands that activate Notch receptor signaling (22Lindsell C.E. Shawber C.J. Boulter J. Weinmaster G. Cell. 1995; 80: 909-917Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). Notch signaling directs cell fate specification in numerous cell types, and unlike many signaling systems, Notch mediates signaling between adjacent cells because of the transmembrane tethering of both Notch receptors and DSL ligands (23Lai E.C. Development (Camb.). 2004; 131: 965-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (847) Google Scholar). The extracellular domain of Jagged1 is involved in receptor binding and consists mainly of 16 tandem epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) repeats. In this regard, we have demonstrated that fibrillin EGF-like repeats mediate the interaction between MAGP-2 and fibrillin. Consistent with the yeast two-hybrid interaction reported previously for MAGP-2 and Jagged1, many of the tissues and structures reported to express MAGP-2 (24Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) also express Jagged1 (25Crosnier C. Attie-Bitach T. Encha-Razavi F. Audollent S. Soudy F. Hadchouel M.

Dev. 2001; 108: 161-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). Although Jagged1 is widely expressed during development, overlap between MAGP-2 and Jagged1 in blood vessels is particularly intriguing given the angiogenic remodeling defect displayed by Jagged1 knock-out mice (27Xue Y. Gao X. Lindsell C.E. Norton C.R. Chang B. Hicks C. Gendron-Maguire M. Rand E.B. Weinmaster G. Gridley T. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1999; 8: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar). The expression patterns shared by MAGP-2 and Jagged1 suggest potential functional consequences of the previous yeast two-hybrid interaction reported for MAGP-2 with Jagged1.In this study, we confirm that MAGP-2 interacts with Jagged1 in mammalian cells, and we identify the EGF-like repeats of Jagged1 as the basis for its interaction with MAGP-2. We also show that MAGP-2 increases the amount of soluble Jagged1 released from the cell surface in a metalloproteinase-dependent manner. Although we find that MAGP-2 has the capacity to interact with other members of the DSL family of Notch ligands, augmentation of shedding appears specific for Jagged1. In addition, whereas its structural relative MAGP-1 was found to bind DSL ligands, MAGP-1 was unable to effect shedding of Jagged1 from the cell surface. Our findings suggest that beyond a structural role in microfibrils, MAGP-2 may function as a biological modulator of Notch signaling, and potential mechanisms by which MAGP-2 could affect ligand-induced Notch signaling are discussed.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstructs—Jagged1 deletion mutants were constructed using standard molecular biology techniques. In brief, the amino acids deleted in each of the mutants is as follows: ΔCD, amino acids 1103–1213; ΔCR, amino acids 863–957; ΔDSL, amino acids 92–250; and ΔEGFR/CR, amino acids 295–1037. Details are available upon request.Antibodies—Rabbit polyclonal anti-Jagged1 and anti-Delta1 antibodies were generated by cloning Jagged1 extracellular sequence encoding amino acids 35–360 (PCR8), Jagged1 intracellular sequence encoding amino acids 1102–1219 (J59), or Delta1 extracellular sequence encoding amino acids 150–350 (148G) into the pGEX vector (Amersham Biosciences), which creates a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Transformed bacteria were induced to produce fusion protein, and resultant proteins were isolated and purified by glutathione-agarose (Amersham Biosciences) and injected into rabbits. An antibody to the N-terminal half of murine MAGP-2 has been described previously (28Lemaire R. Farina G. Kissin E. Shipley J.M. Bona C. Korn J.H. Lafyatis R. Arthritis Rheum. 2004; 50: 915-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An anti-HA monoclonal antibody was also used for immunoprecipitations (Covance).Radioimmunoprecipitations—COS-7 or 293T cells were plated at a density of 5 × 105 cell per 60-mm dish. Cells were transfected with a total of 5 μg of plasmid using Lipofectin (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. When two constructs were used, 2.5 μg of each was used, and controls in these cases included 2.5 μg of test plasmid plus 2.5 μg of control vector. Following transfection for 6 h, transfection media were replaced with normal growth media (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium + 10% fetal calf serum). 31 h following transfection, cells were starved for 1 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium minus cysteine + 5% dialyzed fetal calf serum. Cells were labeled overnight (18 h) in 1.5 ml of the same media containing 50 μCi/ml [35S]cysteine. In experiments using PMA (100 μm, Sigma P8139) or the metalloproteinase inhibitor BB3103 (5 μm), each was added for the entire labeling period. Cell extracts or media were immunoprecipitated using 5 μl of antibody and protein A-Sepharose (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) as described (21Penner A.S. Rock M.J. Kielty C.M. Shipley J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 35044-35049Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar).Immunoprecipitation of Jagged1 ICD Fragments—COS-7 cells were plated on 60-mm dishes and transfected via Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) using 1.6 μg of total DNA and 4 μl of Lipofectamine reagent following the manufacturer's instructions. Within these parameters, each transfection mixture contained 0.4 μg of Jagged1 and either 0.4 μg of MAGP-2 or vector control plasmid. The day after transfection, monolayer cultures were serum-starved overnight and then treated for 5 h with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132 (BioMol), at a final concentration of 10 μm. Cell lysates were collected in lysis buffer as described for radioimmunoprecipitations and immunoprecipitated with J59 antiserum for 1 h on ice. Immunoprecipitates were collected on protein-A-agarose (Invitrogen), washed as for radioimmunoprecipitates, and Western-blotted using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (12CA5).RESULTSMAGP-2 Interacts with the DSL Ligand Jagged1—In a previous study, we used the C-terminal MAGP domain shared by MAGP-1 and -2 as a bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interacting proteins. In addition to the microfibrillar proteins fibrillin-1 and -2, the screen also identified Jagged1 as a potential interacting protein with MAGP-2, even though Jagged1 is cell-associated and not known to be associated with the extracellular matrix. However, some evidence indicates that MAGP-2 can be cell-associated as well as microfibril-associated. In fact, MAGP-2 has an RGD motif in the N terminus that facilitates binding of the αvβ3 integrin expressed on the surface of cells (17Gibson M.A. Leavesley D.I. Ashman L.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13060-13065Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), and cell-associated MAGP-2 has been seen in both immunohistochemistry of fetal bovine tissues and cultured rat lung fibroblasts (24Gibson M.A. Finnis M.L. Kumaratilake J.S. Cleary E.G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1998; 46: 871-886Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 29Segade F. Trask B.C. Broekelmann T.J. Pierce R.A. Mecham R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 11050-11057Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). We therefore undertook studies to address the potential significance of MAGP-2 interacting with Jagged1.We first verified the MAGP-2 interaction with Jagged1 in mammalian cells. 293T cells were cotransfected with MAGP-2 and Jagged1, metabolically labeled overnight with [35S]cysteine, and then both whole cell lysates and conditioned medium were collected, because MAGP-2 is both secreted and cell-associated. Immunoprecipitation with an antibody specific for MAGP-2 also coimmunoprecipitated Jagged1 (Fig. 1A, lanes 7 and 8). The antibody to MAGP-2 did not cross-react with Jagged1 in the absence of MAGP-2 (Fig. 1A, lanes 3 and 4). In a converse experiment, immunoprecipitation of whole cell lysates expressing both Jagged1 and MAGP-2 with an antibody directed against a C-terminal HA tag fused to Jagged1 also coimmunoprecipitated MAGP-2 (Fig. 1B, lane 8). Together, these results indicate that full-length forms of Jagged1 and MAGP-2 can interact in mammalian cells.The EGF-like Repeats of Jagged1 Are Essential for MAGP-2/Jagged1 Binding—By having verified the interaction between MAGP-2 and Jagged1, we wanted to know what domain of Jagged1 was binding to MAGP-2. The extracellular domain of Jagged1 consists mainly of 16 tandem EGF-like repeats. The ligand binding domain is composed of an N-terminal domain and a degenerate EGF-like repeat termed the DSL domain, a hallmark of DSL family ligands (Fig. 2A). Following the 16 tandem EGF-like repeats is a cysteine-rich domain found only in Jagged/Serrate-like ligands. A series of Jagged1 constructs was made to delete the cytoplasmic domain (ΔCD), the DSL domain (ΔDSL), the cysteine-rich region (ΔCR), or a region spanning 14 EGF-like repeats and the cysteine-rich region (ΔEGFR/CR) (Fig. 2A). Each deletion construct was transfected into COS-7 cells with MAGP-2. After metabolic labeling, immunoprecipitation with anti-MAGP-2 antibodies was performed. All deletion constructs except ΔEGF/CR were able to coimmunoprecipitate with MAGP-2 (Fig. 2B). Expression of ΔEGFR/CR was confirmed by immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody directed against the HA tag in the cytoplasmic domain (data not shown). The loss of interaction between ΔEGFR/CR and MAGP-2 but not between ΔCR and MAGP-2 implicates the EGF-like repeats as the relevant binding domain for MAGP-2. Most interestingly, among the original clones identified in the yeast two-hybrid screen with MAGP-2, 8 of the 13 encoded proteins contain multiple copies of EGF-like repeats, and in particular, we localized the MAGP-2 binding domain in both fibrillin-1 and fibrillin-2 to a region near the C terminus consisting of seven tandem EGF-like repeats. Our results indicate that the EGF-like repeats in Jagged1 are essential for its interaction with MAGP-2 and that tandem EGF-like repeats are a common feature of MAGP-2-binding proteins.Fig. 2MAGP-2 interacts with the EGF-like repeats in Jagged1. A, schematic of J1HA mutants. Hallmarks of the extracellular domain are the signal peptide (SP), the Delta/Serrate/LAG-2 (DSL) homology domain, 16 tandem EGF-like repeats (EGFR), and a cysteine-rich region (CR). C-terminal to the transmembrane (TM) sequence is a short intracellular domain followed by three tandem HA epitopes (HA). B, COS-7 cells were cotransfected with MAGP-2 and individual J1HA(J1HA) deletion constructs or full-length Jagged1HA, metabolically labeled with [35S]cysteine, and cell extracts immunoprecipitated with an antibody to MAGP-2.

A. 2003; 100: 7638-7643Crossref PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). The molecular weight of Jagged1 found in MAGP-2 immunoprecipitates from the conditioned medium (Fig. 1A, lane 7) is consistent with a shedding mechanism, as it migrates slightly faster than full-length Jagged1 found in whole cell lysates (compare Fig. 1A, lane 7 with 8). We confirmed that the Jagged1 present in the conditioned medium is not full-length ligand by performing an immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibodies from conditioned medium. Because Jagged1 is tagged at its C terminus with three HA epitopes, this experiment should reveal any full-length Jagged1 present in the supernatant due to nonspecific events such as membrane blebbing. No Jagged1 is seen under these conditions (Fig. 1B, lane 7), indicating that a soluble extracellular domain fragment of Jagged1 associates with secreted MAGP-2.The presence of a complex containing both the Jagged1 extracellular domain (ECD) and MAGP-2 in the conditioned medium suggested that perhaps MAGP-2 plays a role in the cell surface shedding and/or stabilization of Jagged1. To determine whether shedding of Jagged1 is influenced by MAGP-2, we transfected Jagged1 alone or in combination with MAGP-2, and we then performed an immunoprecipitation with an antibody directed against the Jagged1 ECD to detect all Jagged1 ECD shed from the cells, and not just that proportion of Jagged1 found in complexes with secreted MAGP-2. COS-7 cells transfected with Jagged1 alone display a low level of ECD shedding that is augmented in the presence of MAGP-2 (Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). The slower migrating band may represent multimerization of the shed Jagged1 ECD (asterisk in Fig. 3A, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast to the MAGP-2 pull downs that also detect Jagged1 ECD, MAGP-2 was not readily detected with the Jagged1 ECD pull downs. This inability to detect MAGP-2 under these conditions may be due to masking of the Jagged1 epitopes by complexed MAGP-2 or the possibility that not all shed Jagged1 ECD is complexed with MAGP-2. Nonetheless, if MAGP-2 induces Jagged1 ECD shedding then one would expect to detect an increase in the generation of cleavage products encoding the remaining transmembrane and intracellular domains of Jagged1. In separate experiments we confirmed that indeed MAGP-2 coexpression with Jagged1 leads to an increase in the levels of the complementary C-terminal fragment (J1HAADAM cleavage) that remains cell-associated following the shedding process (Fig. 3B). Membrane-bound Jagged1 is further proteolytically processed by γ-secretase (32LaVoie M.J. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol.

Identification of the J1HA cleavage products was verified by using hydroxamate-based ADAM inhibitors and γ-secretase inhibitors to block their production (data not shown).Fig. 3MAGP-2 facilitates the shedding of Jagged1 from the cell surface. A, COS-7 cells were transfected with J1HA alone or in combination with MAGP-2, metabolically labeled overnight with [35S]cysteine, and whole cell lysates (CL) or conditioned medium (CM) immunoprecipitated (IP) with an antibody directed against the ECD of J1HA. The slower migrating band in conditioned medium may represent a multimeric form of soluble Jagged1 (asterisk). Molecular mass markers (left) from top to bottom are 204, 136, 84, 41, 31, and 18 kDa. B, cell lysates from COS-7 cells transfected with J1HA alone or J1HA plus MAGP-2 were immunoprecipitated with a Jagged1 intracellular domain (J1 ICD) antibody, and J1 intracellular domain fragments were detected upon Western blotting with an antibody to the C-terminal HA tag (J1ADAM cleavage and J1ICD, top panel). Western blotting also detected the immunoglobin heavy chain (HC) from the immunoprecipitation. Western blotting confirmed the presence of transfected MAGP-2 in whole cell lysates (bottom panel).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)LaVoie and Selkoe (32LaVoie M.J.

Although not direct proof that ADAM-17 is the relevant protease for Jagged1, they report that the protease that acts on Jagged1 has the characteristics of ADAM-17. For example, Jagged1 proteolysis is phorbol ester (PMA)-inducible, sensitive to both batimistat and TAPI-1, and resistant to the ADAM-10 inhibitor TIMP-1. Also as found here, the products of the ADAM-17-like activity are a soluble Jagged1 ECD fragment and a Jagged1 intracellular domain fragment. Because MAGP-2 increases the amount of Jagged1 shed from the cell surface, we asked whether the effect of MAGP-2 was also dependent on metalloproteinase activity. To address this question, we transiently transfected COS-7 cells with Jagged1 in combination with MAGP-2, and we used either PMA to induce metalloproteinase activity or BB3103, a hydroxamate-based inhibitor, to suppress metalloproteinase activity. We then measured the amount of soluble Jagged1 present in the conditioned medium by immunoprecipitation of metabolically labeled culture supernatant with anti-Jagged1 ECD antiserum. We first verified that PMA could induce Jagged1 shedding, and we found that MAGP-2 or PMA treatment resulted in similar levels of Jagged1 ECD in the conditioned medium (Fig. 4, lanes 1–3). Furthermore, we found that MAGP-2-dependent shedding of Jagged1 was greatly decreased in the presence of BB3103 (Fig. 4, lane 5 versus lane 2), with levels of shedding in the presence of the inhibitor similar to those seen in cultures treated with both PMA and BB3103 (lane 6) or untreated cell cultures (lane 1). Reversal of the MAGP-2 effect on Jagged1 shedding by BB3103 indicates that MAGP-2-induced shedding is metalloproteinase-dependent. BB3103 also decreases PMA-induced shedding, confirming the previous reports of metalloproteinase-dependent Jagged1 shedding (32LaVoie M.J. Selkoe D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 34427-34437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Most interestingly, the effects of MAGP-2 and PMA appear to be additive (Fig. 4, lane 4).Fig. 4MAGP-2-facilitated shedding of Jagged1 is metalloproteinase-dependent.

Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) 1The abbreviations used are: CTL, cytotoxic T lymphocyte; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; CLSM, confocal laser scanning microscopy; CS, chondroitin sulfate; GAG, glycosaminoglycan; GrA, granzyme A; GrB, granzyme B; HS, heparan sulfate; HSPG, HS proteoglycan; LAK, lymphokine-activated killer; MEF, murine embryonic fibroblast; MFI, mean fluorescence intensity; MX, 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside; NK, natural killer (cell); PFN perforin; PG, proteoglycan; SG, serglycin. and natural killer (NK) cells eliminate virus-infected and tumor cells. These effectors store granzymes and perforin (PFN) complexed with the proteoglycan serglycin (SG) within secretory granules. Granule-mediated apoptosis involves, in part, the release of these proteins into the immunological synapse that is formed after specific recognition of the target cell (1Stinchcombe J.C. Bossi G.

Rev. 2002; 189: 152-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). The target cell is then postulated to bind and internalize the granzymes to endosomes, whereas PFN is thought to disrupt the vesicles to deliver the granzymes to the cytosol (3Froelich C.J. Orth K.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). GrA and GrB are considered the predominant initiators of apoptosis. GrA is believed to induce caspase-independent cell-death via cleavage of the several proteins within the SET complex (a 270–420 kDa cytoplasmic complex) leading ultimately to single-stranded DNA nicks (8Beresford P.J.

GrB, on the other hand, appears to function as an apical caspase activating procaspases-3, which mediates, via mitochondria, downstream events that dismantle the cell (11Froelich C.J. Metkar S.S.

Nevertheless, depending on the amount of granzyme delivered and the levels of counter-regulatory anti-apoptotic factors, the granzyme may also initiate cell death through cleavage of the proapoptotic protein BID (15Sutton V.R. Wowk M.E. Cancilla M. Trapani J.A. Immunity. 2003; 18: 319-329Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Whether the granzymes undergo target cell binding and internalization for the induction of cellular cytotoxicity has been a matter of intense debate. The original model proposed that granzymes would diffuse to the cytosol through perforin-induced plasma membrane pores. We have, however, recently demonstrated that GrB is secreted as a multi-molecular complex with the chondroitin sulfate (CS) proteoglycan SG (4Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M.

Furthermore, in the presence of non-permeabilizing concentrations of PFN, preformed complexes readily induce apoptosis in target cells. Following the original description of specific binding sites for GrB on target cells (3Froelich C.J. Orth K. Turbov J. Seth P. Gottlieb R. Babior B. Shah G.M. Bleackley R.C. Dixit V.M. Hanna W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 29073-29079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar), the granzyme was reported to use the mannose-6-phosphate receptor/insulin-like growth factor-2 receptor (Mpr300) for target cell entry (17Motyka B. Korbutt G. Pinkoski M.J. Heibein J.A. Caputo A. Hobman M. Barry M. Shostak I. Sawchuk T. Holmes C.F. Gauldie J. Bleackley R.C. Cell. 2000; 103: 491-500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Subsequent work suggested that the uptake occurs both via the dynamin-dependent as well as independent pathways (7Trapani J.A. Sutton V.R. Thia K.Y. Li Y.Q. Froelich C.J. Jans D.A. Sandrin M.S. Browne K.A. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 223-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 18Veugelers K. Motyka B. Frantz C. Shostak I. Sawchuk T. Bleackley R.C. Blood. 2004; 103: 3845-3853Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Finally, using cell lines derived from Mpr300 and Mpr46 knock-out mice, both receptors were found to be entirely dispensable for CTL-induced apoptosis (19Dressel R. Raja S.M. Honing S. Seidler T. Froelich C.J. von Figura K. Gunther E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20200-20210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and allorejection (20Dressel R. von Figura K. Gunther E. Transplantation. 2004; 78: 758-761Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Similarly, the internalization of GrB and its capacity to induce apoptosis do not require Mpr300 and Mpr46 (19Dressel R. Raja S.M. Honing S. Seidler T. Froelich C.J. von Figura K. Gunther E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20200-20210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Taken together, the mechanism(s) of granzyme delivery into target cells remains unsolved. Studies that have described the uptake of GrB have relied on the isolated cationic granzyme and not the physiologically relevant GrB-SG complex secreted by the cytotoxic cell. The highly cationic monomer would bind with varying affinity to a number of anionic sites on the cell surface, obscuring the interaction with “binding sites” designed to efficiently deliver the granzyme intracellularly. Although GrB remains complexed to SG after degranulation, the molecular fate of the complex after contact with the target cell is unclear. Because of the tight interaction of GrB with the CS glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), the entire GrB-SG complex was hypothesized to undergo en masse uptake by target cells. However, as described here, the granzyme appears to dissociate from SG binding to cell surface molecules. Sulfated GAGs displayed by PGs are shown to be crucial participants in this process, contributing to exchange and internalization of GrB and optimizing both GrB-mediated and effector cell-induced target cell death. Nevertheless, disruption of PG synthesis in a number of cell lines reveals the presence of higher affinity binding sites for the granzyme, which may also participate in the exchange phenomenon. Cell Lines—Jurkat, Raji, K562, and HL-60 cells were maintained in complete RPMI medium. MCF-7, 293, and 39(+/+) MEF cells were maintained in complete Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium, and RAW cells were kept in complete DMEM. Dr. Howard Lipton (Evanston Northwestern Healthcare Research Inst., Evanston, IL) provided CHO-K1, pgsA-745 deficient in xylosyl transferase and thus lacking all GAGs (21Esko J.D. Stewart T.E.

Nuwayhid N. Stanley P. Briles E.I. Hirschberg C.B. Cell. 1984; 39: 295-299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). All CHO cell lines were maintained in complete Ham's F-12 K medium. RMA cells and peptide-specific CTLs from T cell receptor-transgenic OT-I mice were employed as described recently (19Dressel R. Raja S.M. Honing S. Seidler T. Froelich C.J. von Figura K. Gunther E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20200-20210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Reagents—All reagents and tissue culture supplies were purchased from either Sigma or Invitrogen. Bovine kidney heparan sulfate and porcine intestinal mucosa heparin were from Sigma. Chondroitin sulfate, heparinase, and heparitinase were purchased from Seikagaku Corp (Tokyo, Japan). A mouse anti-N-sulfated-glucosamine antibody (namely the anti-HS antibody) was from EMD Biosciences (San Diego, CA). Fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary anti-mouse Ig antibody was from BD Biosciences. Human GrB and SG were isolated as described (16Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M. Desai U.R. Demeler B.

Froelich C.J. Protein Expression Purif. 1993; 4: 398-404Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Alexa Fluor 488 and Alexa Fluor 633 carboxylic acid succinimidyl esters and fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran were from Molecular Probes Inc. (Eugene, OR). GrB was labeled per the manufacturer's instructions. The stoichiometry of labeling was 1.2–2 moles of Alexa Fluor 488 per mole of GrB. SG was labeled with Alexa Fluor 633 hydrazide to modify the uronic acid residues on CS-GAG chains (26Osmond R.I. Kett W.C. Skett S.E. Coombe D.R. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 310: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Assuming a molecular mass of 250 kDa for SG, the stoichiometry of labeling for SG633 was 3.2. Alternatively, streptavidin-Alexa 488 or streptavidin-Alexa 546 was coupled to SGbiotin. HSbiotin and CSbiotin were prepared by coupling biotin aminocaproyl hydrazide (16Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M. Desai U.R. Demeler B. Spiegel K. Metkar S.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49523-49530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The stoichiometry of coupling for SG488 was 1.53. The modified GrB and SG retained the ability to form complexes as judged by mobility shift assays (16Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M. Desai U.R. Demeler B. Spiegel K. Metkar S.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49523-49530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). HS-Sepharose, heparin-Sepharose and CS-Sepharose were prepared with cyanogen bromide-activated Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences). Colocalization Studies of GrB488 with SG633—For colocalization studies, adherent cells were plated in a chamber slide (Lab-Tek; Nalge Nunc, Naperville, IL) overnight at 20,000 cells per chamber in 10% fetal calf serum containing Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium. The cells were then washed thrice with RPMI with 1% BSA and incubated with 1 μg/ml either GrB Alexa 488 (GrB488) alone, SG Alexa 633 (SG633) alone, or the doubly labeled GrB488-SG633 complexes in RPMI with 1% BSA at 37 °C for 120 min. The cells were then washed thrice with plain RPMI, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature and mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for imaging. For suspension lines, cells were first washed thrice with RPMI and 1% BSA and incubated with either 1 μg/ml GrB488 alone, SG633 alone, or the doubly labeled GrB488-SG633 complexes at 37 °C for 30 min. The cells were washed thrice with plain RPMI, fixed, and attached to poly-l-lysine-coated coverglass. The coverglass was then assembled into a Focht live cell chamber (FCS2; Bioptechs Inc., Butler, PA) for imaging. Confocal Laser-scanning Microscope (CLSM) Imaging—The treated cells were imaged on a Leica CLSM System with a DMIRE2 inverted microscope (Leica Microsystems, Exton PA). Twelve-bit fluorescence images of the fluorophores were acquired with 63× or 100× oil-immersion objectives (numerical apertures 1.25 and 1.4, respectively) using the Leica Confocal software. Where z-series was acquired, the section step size ranged between 0.4 and 1 μm. Sequential scans were employed with all double-labeled specimens to eliminate cross-talk between channels. Differential interference contrast images were acquired simultaneously with one of the fluorescence channels. Images or image stacks (both fluorescence and digital interference contrast) were imported into Image J version 1.31 (National Institutes of Health) and processed as follows. Each stack was run through a Kalman stack filter to remove noise. Single fluorescence images were produced by performing a z-projection for maximum intensity. Each maximum projection was corrected for brightness and contrast using standard parameters. Digital interference contrast images were processed in a similar fashion except that instead of using a maximum projection, the single most in-focus image in each stack was selected. All images were overlaid using Volocity version 2.5 (Improvision, Inc., Lexington, MA). Image stacks for each fluorophore were loaded into Volocity and then thresholded to segment areas of the image corresponding to the label. The “colocalize sessions” function of Volocity was used to produce spread-sheets containing percentages of pixels that were directly overlaid. Three to five different fields, each containing 5–15 cells, were analyzed for colocalization. The results were expressed as the mean of the percentage of colocalization ± S.D. Numerical calculation of colocalization indices was independently verified by the laboratory of Prof. Frederick Maxfield (Cornell University, New York, NY), using published procedures (27Lin S.X. Mallet W.G. Huang A.Y. Maxfield F.R. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2004; 15: 721-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Internalization of GrB by Flow Cytometry—Internalization experiments were done in RPMI plus 1% BSA at 37 °C. For uptake experiments, cells, either in suspension or confluent monolayer, were incubated with 1 μg/ml GrB488 or GrB488-SG or a double-labeled GrB488-SG633 complex for 120 min. Alexa 488-labeled avidin (avidin488) was used to estimate overall GAG content (28Kett W.C. Osmond R.I. Moe L. Skett S.E. Kinnear B.F. Coombe D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2003; 1620: 225-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Cells were incubated with avidin488 at 66 μg/ml (1 μm) under conditions similar to the those for the granzyme. Cells were washed three times with buffer and subjected to flow cytometry. Adherent cells were detached with trypsin. Flow cytometry was performed on a FACSCalibur with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). The relative mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) was reported as the ratio of geometric mean of the sample to the geometric mean of the autofluorescence control. Binding of GrB-SG to Target Cells by Flow Cytometry—For binding studies, GrB488, GrB488-SG, or the complex was added to suspended cells in RPMI/BSA plus sodium azide (0.02%) for 30 min at 4 °C. Under these conditions the signal for bound GrB was negligible; therefore, amplification was achieved by staining with rabbit polyclonal anti-Alexa Fluor 488 antibody (anti-488) followed by Alexa 488-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody. Here, data were acquired on a linear scale, and binding was reported as the MFI of bound GrB. The matched control for nonspecific antibody binding was defined as cells incubated with GrB488-SG (1000 ng/ml) followed by polyclonal rabbit IgG and then the secondary labeled antibody. Nonspecific binding of the granzyme was assessed by detecting the interaction of the labeled GrB in the presence and absence of 100-fold excess of unlabeled protease. Under this condition, nonspecific binding of the protease was negligible. Detection of Cell Surface HS—Cells in suspension were stained with anti-HS monoclonal antibody for 60 min on ice followed by detection with fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled secondary anti-mouse Ig for 40 min. Adherent cells were trypsinized, allowed to recover in complete medium for 2 h, and then stained with anti-HS monoclonal antibody. Heparinase Digestion of Cell Surface HS—To remove bound serum proteins before heparinase digestion, cells were pre-incubated with RMPI and 1% BSA for 60 min at 37 °C followed by two washes in the same buffer. The washed cells were then left untreated or treated with a combination of 0.1units/ml heparinase I and heparinase III (heparitinase) in 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 7.0, containing 10 mm Ca+2 for 30 min at 37 °C. RPMI with 1% BSA was added to the cells, and incubation was continued for another 30 min. Xyloside-mediated Inhibition of GAG Attachment—Cells were grown with or without 2.5 mm 4-methylumbelliferyl-β-d-xylopyranoside (MX) for 3 days before use. GAG-Sepharose Binding—GrB or GrB-SG (100 μg/ml) was incubated with either control or GAG-Sepharose beads for 30 min at room temperature. The beads were then centrifuged, and the supernatants were analyzed for GrB activity. GrB-induced Apoptosis—Granzyme-induced apoptosis was determined by loss of mitochondrial membrane potential as described (29Metkar S.S. Wang B. Ebbs M.L. Kim J.H. Lee Y.J. Raja S.M. Froelich C.J. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 875-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). LAK Cell-induced Cytotoxicity—LAK cells were derived from wild type 129/SVJ mice (Courtesy of Timothy Ley, Washington University) and cultured for 10 days in RPMI medium with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1000 units/ml interleukin 2. CTL-induced Apoptosis—CTL-induced DNA fragmentation, assessed as the percentage of thymidine release, was performed as described (19Dressel R. Raja S.M. Honing S. Seidler T. Froelich C.J. von Figura K. Gunther E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20200-20210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). CTL and Target Cell Conjugate Formation—Vybrant cell-labeling solutions (Molecular Probes Inc.) were used to stain OT-I derived CTL (DiI dye) and RMA target cells (DiO dye) according to the manufacturer's protocol. After coculture in the presence or absence of the relevant peptide (SIINFEKL), the cells were analyzed on a FACScan flow cytometer for conjugate formation. Imaging, Computers, and Software—Images were captured either with a Kodak digital camera or Saphir Ultra 2 flatbed scanner and exported to Adobe Photoshop 6.0, after which TIFF images were placed for final presentation in Adobe Illustrator 10.0 using a Macintosh Power G4 computer. Statistics—Where indicated, the paired t test was performed using GraphPad InStat version 3.0a for Macintosh, GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA. GrB Is Internalized into Target Cells without SG—GrB is secreted as a multi-molecular complex bound to SG (4Metkar S.S. Wang B. Aguilar-Santelises M. Raja S.M. Uhlin-Hansen L. Podack E. Trapani J.A. Froelich C.J. Immunity. 2002; 16: 417-428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). To learn whether the intact complex was internalized, the uptake values of monomeric GrB488 (GrB labeled with Alexa 488), SG633 (SG labeled with Alexa 633), and reconstituted double-labeled GrB488-SG633 complexes were compared by flow cytometry. Typically, GrB and SG are mixed at 1:1 (w/w), producing 6–8 GrB molecules per SG molecule (16Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M. Desai U.R. Demeler B. Spiegel K. Metkar S.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49523-49530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 1a) indicate that although internalization of the GrB was readily apparent in >90% of the cells, uptake of SG was minimal. These observations were consistently made for a number of cell lines including 39(+/+) MEFs and CHO cells (data not shown). The wild type 39(+/+) MEF line (19Dressel R. Raja S.M. Honing S. Seidler T. Froelich C.J. von Figura K. Gunther E. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 20200-20210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) was the single exception, showing ∼15% double positive cells and higher uptake of SG633 alone (Fig. 1b). The results suggested that target cells incubated with GrB-SG complexes might preferentially internalize the granzyme but exclude the carrier PG. Because flow cytometry studies failed to demonstrate substantial uptake of SG, the interaction of double-labeled GrB-SG was examined by CLSM. Imaging was performed with 293, RAW and 39(+/+) MEF cells. Data were collected in real time over 120 min (data not shown) or at end point in fixed cells. In comparison with GrB, a very weak signal was consistently observed for SG (Fig. 1c) and, when present, the SG633 signal resided in regions of the cytoplasm separate from GrB. Quantitation of colocalized signals by two separate algorithms (see “Materials and Methods”) failed to exceed 15.5 ± 8.3%. Similar data were obtained for GrB488-SG633-treated RAW cells (data not shown). Importantly, SG was also labeled with Alexa 546, and cells treated with these double-labeled complexes produced similar results (data not shown). The 39(+/+) MEFs contained significant levels of SG when incubated with either labeled free SG or treated with double-labeled GrB-SG (Fig. 1c). This exception served as a crucial positive control, ensuring that labeled SG could indeed be visualized intracellularly by our CLSM system. Based on image analyses, the granzyme seemed, in the majority of cell lines examined, to dissociate from SG and to undergo internalization without the proteoglycan. GrB Undergoes Ion Exchange from SG to Immobilized GAGs or Target Cell Surface—The observations suggested that the granzyme might dissociate from SG and interact separately at the cell surface. We have reported, in surface plasmon resonance studies, a strong association between GrB and CS GAGs of SG (16Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M. Desai U.R. Demeler B. Spiegel K. Metkar S.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49523-49530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). However, it seemed plausible that the granzyme could undergo transfer to more highly acidic cell surface GAGs. Typically, the CS on SG characterized from hematopoietic cells is CS-C type (sulfated at the C4 position of the N-acetyl galactosamine residue) (30Toyama-Sorimachi N. Sorimachi H. Tobita Y. Kitamura F. Yagita H. Suzuki K. Miyasaka M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7437-7444Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Because HS GAGs are more sulfated than CS, HSPGs were considered prominent candidates. The binding affinity of GrB for heparan sulfate was therefore compared with that of CS. As predicted, the association of GrB with HS greatly exceeded the value for CS, and second order association rate constant was ∼3.3-fold faster for GrB-HS than that for the GrB-CS interaction (1.4 ± 0.05 × 106 m-1 s-1) versus 0.42 ± 0.02 × 106 m-1 s-1) (Fig. 2a). The dissociation constant (Kd) calculated from koff/kon was 118 ± 1.3 nm for GrB-HS as compared with 947 ± 55 nm for GrB-CS. As reported previously (16Raja S.M. Wang B. Dantuluri M. Desai U.R. Demeler B. Spiegel K. Metkar S.S. Froelich C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 49523-49530Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), the Kd for GrB-SG interaction was ∼710 nm. To establish whether GrB has the capacity to undergo ion exchange from SG to another acidic GAG molecule, an in vitro assay was designed that entailed the mixing of GrB-SG complexes with either HS or CS GAG chains that had been immobilized to Sepharose beads. GrB remaining in the fluid phase was then determined enzymatically after removal of the beads. In this model system, ∼20% of the total GrB was detected in the fluid phase, indicating that the majority of the protease had associated with HS- or CS-Sepharose beads (Fig. 2b). The granzyme could also transfer from equimolar GrB-HS complexes to immobilized HS-Sepharose (data not shown). The observation that GrB could transfer to immobilized GAGs suggested that the exchange process was not merely due to differences in the Kd for these sulfated carbohydrates. The Sepharose-coupled GAGs appeared to provide a topological distribution of negative charge exceeding the level displayed by the soluble GAGs favoring exchange. The transfer phenomenon was then established for target cells by showing that addition of GrB-SG complexes to Jurkat cells resulted in detectable binding of the protease but not the proteoglycan. Using an antibody amplification technique (see “Materials and Methods”), GrB488 was detected on the target cell surface of Jurkat cells after incubation with GrB488-SG. However, when GrB-SG488 complexes were added to the target cells, bound SG was not observed (Fig. 2c). The results therefore suggest that GrB is transferred to the target cell, whereas SG is concomitantly excluded. Level of Cell Surface PGs Correlates with the Internalization of Exchanged GrB—Because PGs contain the bulk of sulfated GAGs, it was then asked whether these proteins modulated GrB uptake. The studies were performed with wild type CHO-K1 and two mutant cell lines, namely pgsA-745 cells that have markedly reduced levels of all GAGs due to a deficiency in xylosyl transferase and pgsD-677 cells that have reduced levels of HS-GAGs due to the lack of HS-polymerase (23Lidholt K. Weinke J.L. Kiser C.S. Lugemwa F.N. Bame K.J. Cheifetz S. Massague J. Lindhal U. Esko J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2267-2271Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). The reduction in cell surface HS-GAGs in the mutant lines was documented with an anti-N-sulfated glucosamine antibody (31David G. Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 961-975Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 32Bai X.M. Van der Schueren B. Cassiman J.J. Van den Berghe H. David G. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1994; 42: 1043-1054Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3a). Both the pgsA-745 and pgsD-677 cells were consistently found to internalize less granzyme (monomer or complexed) than the wild type CHO-K1 cells (Fig. 3b). In comparison with the CHO-K1 cells, GrB uptake was reduced to 46.7 ± 5.5% (n = 9) and 67.6 ± 6.9% (n = 9), respectively, for pgsA-745 and pgsD-677 cells (Fig. 3b). Because GrB uptake in pgsD-677 cells exceeded the levels observed for pgsA-745 cells, the result suggested involvement of other GAGs in the internalization process apart from HS. However, uptake was substantial in the GAG-deficient lines, indicating that other negatively charged molecules on the cell surface may contribute to exchange and internalization of the granzyme. Because sialic acid also contributes to the net negative surface charge, its role in GrB uptake also was also examined. A comparison of Lec2, a sialic acid-deficient CHO line (24Deutscher S.L.

https://openalex.org/W2107208660,"Recent studies have shown that the integrase (IN) of HIV-1 is inhibited in vitro by HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). We further investigated the specific protein sequences of RT that were involved in this inhibition by screening a complete library of RT-derived peptides for their inhibition of IN activities. Two 20-residue peptides, peptide 4286, derived from the RT DNA polymerase domain, and the one designated 4321, from the RT ribonuclease H domain, inhibit the enzymatic activities of IN in vitro. The former peptide inhibits all three IN-associated activities (3′-end processing, strand transfer, and disintegration), whereas the latter one inhibits primarily the first two functions. We showed the importance of the sequences and peptide length for the effective inhibition of IN activities. Binding assays of the peptides to IN (with no DNA substrate present) indicated that the two inhibitory peptides (as well as several non-inhibitory peptides) interact directly with IN. Moreover, the isolated catalytic core domain of IN also interacted directly with the two inhibitory peptides. Nevertheless, only peptide 4286 can inhibit the disintegration activity associated with the IN core domain, because this activity is the only one exhibited by this domain. This result was expected from the lack of inhibition of disintegration of full-length IN by peptide 4321. The data and the three-dimensional models presented suggested that the inhibition resulted from steric hindrance of the catalytic domain of IN. This information can substantially facilitate the development of novel drugs against HIV INs and thus contribute to the fight against AIDS.

This information can substantially facilitate the development of novel drugs against HIV INs and thus contribute to the fight against AIDS. Two viral encoded enzymes play central roles in the early stages of the replication of retroviruses and retrotransposons. The first one, reverse transcriptase (RT), 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; IN, integrase; IN-CCD, integrase catalytic-core domain; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus, type 1; AIDS, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome;RNase H, ribonuclease H; PIC, preintegration complex; MLV, murine leukemia virus; DDW, double distilled water; Me2SO, dimethyl sulfoxide; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. converts the single-stranded viral RNA into double-stranded DNA in a relatively complex process, reverse transcription. This step is catalyzed by the two catalytic activities of RT, the DNA polymerase (capable of copying both RNA and DNA into DNA) and the RNase H activity, which concomitantly hydrolyzes the RNA strand in the DNA-RNA heteroduplex formed (1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Subsequently, the RT-produced double-stranded DNA is transported into the nucleus, as part of the nucleoprotein complex (designated the preintegration complex), where it integrates into the genomic target DNA by the second viral enzyme, the IN. IN identifies the ends of the linear viral DNA, trims them (by removing two or three extra nucleotides located 3′ to the highly conserved CA 3′ termini), and then accompanies the DNA into the nucleus to catalyze integration into the target cellular DNA (1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar, 2Thang K.C. Davies D.R. Curr. Top. Med.

American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.2002: 613-630Google Scholar). There are several examples for potential linkages between RT and IN. First, the DNA product of RT is the substrate for IN, the next enzyme in the line of the viral replication cycle. Second, both proteins are proteolytic products of the same polyprotein precursor encoded by a single retroviral gene, the pol (1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). In some cases, as in avian sarcoma leukosis virus, the IN sequence appears in two forms, one as part of the large β-subunit of the RT and the other as a free IN protein designated pp32 (1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar, 4Skalka A.M. Goff S.P. Reverse Transcriptase, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1993Google Scholar). Moreover, PICs, which are capable of performing in vitro integration, contain the viral DNA, IN, RT, and other proteins (5Burkinsky M.I. Sharova N. McDonald T.L. Pushkarskaya T. Tarplay W.G.

Malim M.H. Adv. Virus Res. 1999; 52: 275-299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Third, the INs and RTs of HIV-1 and MLV were shown to exhibit physical interactions (9Hu S.C. Court D.L. Zweig M. Levin J.G. J. Virol. 1986; 60: 267-274Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Ishikawa T. Okui N. Kobayashi N. Sakuma R. Kitamura T. Kitamura Y. J.

These direct contacts between the IN and RT of HIV-1 were recently confirmed by us by using surface plasmon resonance technology. 2I. Oz Gleenberg, A. Herschhorn, and A. Hizi, unpublished data. Finally, we and others (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tasara T. Maga G. Hottiger O.M. Hübscher U. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) have shown recently that RT can inhibit in vitro the enzymatic activities of IN, suggesting functional roles for these interactions. After the completion of reverse transcription in the cytoplasm of the infected cell, there is a significant delay in the process of integration depending on the rate by which the PICs are transported into the nucleus (1Coffin J.M. Hughes S.H. Varmus H.E. Retroviruses, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997Google Scholar). Because all possible catalytic components for integration are likely to be present in the PICs, the viral DNA can serve as donor DNA as well as the target DNA for integration. Such a potential auto-integration process is suicidal for the virus, as it destructs the viral genome. For that reason, it is imperative to understand the mechanisms that regulate the integration of the retroviral genome and learn how to control it. Several cellular proteins are known to be involved in the integration process in HIV-infected cells (14Kalpana G.V. Marmon S. Wang W. Weidong Crabtree G.R. Goff S.P. Science. 1994; 266: 2002-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 15Aigar A. Hindmarsh P. Skalka A.M. Leis J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 3571-3580Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Harris D.

Virol. 1999; 73: 2994-3003Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most interestingly, one of these factors serves also as a barrier to auto-integration in MLV-infected cells (18Lee M.S. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 1528-1533Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Because RT can also inhibit IN activities (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Tasara T. Maga G. Hottiger O.M. Hübscher U. FEBS Lett. 2001; 507: 39-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), it is possible that an alternative pathway of inhibiting auto-integration without the involvement of cellular proteins exists as well. This course of action involves the functional interactions between the authentic viral proteins, RTs and INs, prior to integration into the cellular DNA. Here we have extended our previous in vitro study on the inhibition of IN by RT (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) by studying specific RT-derived sequences that are involved in binding and inhibiting IN. This was done through a systematic in vitro screening of a library of HIV-1 RT-derived peptides for their capacity to inhibit HIV-1 IN activities and to interact directly with IN. We have identified two 20-residue-long peptides that inhibit IN activities in vitro. The first peptide is derived from the DNA polymerase active site, and the second peptide is derived from the RNase H domain of RT. In addition, we have shown by a novel dot-blot analysis that the full-length RT, as well as several RT-derived peptides, bind directly to HIV-1 IN. The localization of the two inhibitory peptides in the three-dimensional structure of the RT and the putative docking (of the DNA polymerase-derived peptide) into IN-CCD suggest that the inhibition of IN activities results from a steric hindrance. These findings can lead to insights into the development of novel peptide-based, specific, and highly potent IN inhibitors. Such inhibitors are expected to interfere with HIV infectivity and, thus, serve as novel prodrugs for the treatment of AIDS. The sequences of all studied peptides are given in the Supplemental Material. Two sets of synthetic peptides libraries were generous gifts from the NIH-AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. The first set was the HIV-1 HXB2R Pol peptides complete set (catalog number 4358). These peptides are each 20 residues in length with 10 amino acid overlaps between the sequential peptides. All peptides derived from the DNA polymerase domain were prepared to a final concentration of 900 μm, by dissolving in either DDW or in a minimal amount of 100% Me2SO and then diluted with DDW to 6.5% Me2SO, all according to the recommended instructions (www.aidsreagent.org). All peptides derived from the RNase H domain were dissolved in a minimal amount of 100% Me2SO and then diluted with DDW to 6.5% Me2SO (yielding final concentrations of 400 μm). The second peptide set was the complete set of the HIV-1 clade B consensus pol peptides (catalog number 6208). These peptides are each 15 residues in length with 11 amino acid overlaps between the sequential peptides. They were also dissolved as above to a final concentration of 400 μm each in 6.5% Me2SO. All peptides were designated according to the numbering given by the NIH-AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (www.aidsreagent.org). Peptides 4286′-1 (15-mer) and 4321′-1 (14-mer) were custom-synthesized. The first one was diluted to a final concentration of 3.5 mm in DDW and the second one as described above to a final concentration of 5.7 mm in 6.5% Me2SO. Bacterial Expression and Purification of HIV-1 IN and HIV-1 RT Proteins—All HIV-1 IN and RT versions used were highly purified as judged from their pattern after analysis by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). HIV-1 IN—HIV-1 IN from the BH-10 strain of HIV-1, carrying amino-terminal His6 tag, was expressed and purified as described in detail (20Barsov E.V. Huber W.E. Marcotrigiano J. Clark P.K. Clark A.D. Arnold E. Hughes S.H. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 4484-4494Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIV-1 IN-Catalytic Core Domain (the Double Mutant W131E, F185K)—This large IN fragment (designated IN-CCD) was expressed as an amino-terminal His6-tagged protein and purified as described in detail (21Goldgur Y. Dyda F. Hickman A.B. Jenkins T.M. Craigie R. Davies R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9150-9154Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). HIV-1 RT—The expression and purification of heterodimeric (p66/p51) HIV-1 RT with a His6 tag, attached to the carboxyl-terminal end of the p66, were described in detail previously (22Sevilya Z. Loya S. Hughes S.H. Hizi A. J. Mol. Biol. 2001; 311: 957-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The expression and purification of a non-tagged heterodimeric HIV-1 RT were described previously (23Hizi A. McGill C. Hughes S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 1218-1222Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 24Ferris A.L. Miller D.A. Hizi A. Kim K.W. Deringer-Boyer S.M. Mellini M.L. Clark Jr., A.D. Arnold G.F. Lebherz W.B. Arnold E. Muschik G.M. Hughes S.H. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1990; 6: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The following gel-purified oligonucleotides were used in the enzymatic assays of HIV-1 IN: A (21-mer), 5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCAGT-3′; B (21-mer), 5′-ACTGCTAGAGATTTTCCACAC-3′; C (19-mer), 5′-GTGTGGAAAATCTCTAGCA-3′; D (38-mer), 5-TGCTAGTTCTAGCAGGCCCTTGGGCCGGCGCTTGCGCC-3. Oligonucleotides A–C correspond to the U5 end of the HIV-1 long terminal repeat (25Bushman F.D. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 1339-1343Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). Boldface letters indicate the highly conserved CA/TG dinucleotide pair. Oligonucleotide C is identical to A, after the removal of the GT dinucleotides from its 3′-end and thus after annealing to oligonucleotide B, creating a dinucleotide overhang at the 5′-end of oligonucleotide B. Oligonucleotide D, termed “dumbbell,” folds to form a structure mimicking the integration intermediate. This substrate, used for assaying the disintegration activity, has 5 bp of a viral sequence and 10 bp of a non-viral sequence, as described earlier (26Chow S.A. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In order to test the 3′-end processing and the resulting strand transfer activity of IN, the 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide A, annealed to its complementary strand, oligonucleotide B (both 21 nucleotides long), was used. We have used the duplex of oligonucleotides C and B and for assaying the 3′-end processing activity (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). 5′-End Labeling and Substrate Preparations—Fifty pmol of oligonucleotides A, C, or D were 5′-end-labeled using 1 unit of T4 polynucleotide kinase and 50 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, in a final volume of 50 μl of the appropriate buffer (supplied by the manufacturer) for 30 min at 37 °C. The samples were then heat-inactivated. The 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides designated A or C were annealed each to an equimolar amount of oligonucleotide B in 55 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.27 m NaCl. For the disintegration assay, we have used 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotide D, which forms a dumbbell structure after self-annealing (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays of the 3′-End Processing, Strand Transfer (or DNA Joining), and Disintegration Activities—In the strand transfer assays described, the labeled 5′-end substrate employed served as both the target and donor DNA leading to an increase in the molecular size of the substrate, whereas in the 3′-end processing and disintegration assays, we have followed the unique cleavage of the labeled substrates (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 26Chow S.A. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). All reactions were performed in 10-μl reaction mixtures with 0.33 pmol of the labeled DNA substrate and the reaction buffer, containing 1 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 54 mm NaCl, 2.5 mm MnCl2, 50 μm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm spermidine, 25 mm MOPS (pH 7.2), 5% glycerol, and 1% Me2SO (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have assayed 250 ng of HIV-1 IN (which equals 4 pmol, assuming IN dimers of the 32-kDa subunits) or 1 μg of HIV-1 IN-CCD (which equals 28 pmol, assuming dimers of the 18-kDa subunits). This difference in the amounts of proteins assayed results from the lower activity of IN-CCD relative to the full-length IN. The two versions of HIV-1 IN were preincubated on ice for 5 min in the presence or the absence of HIV-1 RT or the HIV-1 RT-derived peptides. Reactions were initiated after adding the labeled DNA substrate in the reaction buffer, incubated for 30 min at 37 °C, and then stopped by adding 10 μl of formamide loading buffer (90% formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 1 mg/ml xylene cyanole). The samples were heat-denatured, cooled on ice, and loaded onto 6 m urea, 14% polyacrylamide denaturing gels, followed by electrophoresis (urea-PAGE). The gels were dried and subjected to autoradiography at –80 °C or at room temperature to obtain close to linear exposures. The films were scanned, and the levels of IN activity were calculated using the densitometric software TINA (version 2.07d; Raytest Isotopenmessgeraete, GmbH). The 3′-end processing activity was determined as a percentage of the total 5′-end-labeled DNA oligonucleotides converted to 19-mer DNA. Strand transfer (or DNA joining) activity was calculated as a percentage of the total amount of labeled DNA found in DNA bands of 22 nucleotides or more in length. Disintegration activity was calculated as a percentage of the total 5′-end-labeled 38-mer DNA oligonucleotide converted to 14-mer DNA. All residual activities were relative to the control activity of the IN (with no RT or RT-derived peptides present) and were expressed as percentage of the initial IN activities. HIV-1 RT-derived Peptides Bound to HIV-1 IN—Nitrocellulose filters were soaked in DDW followed by transfer buffer, containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% (v/v) methanol, for 5 min and then transferred to a dot-blot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Aliquots of RT-derived peptides or His6-tagged HIV-1 RT (10 μg each) were bound to the filter under vacuum for 15 min. To ascertain the binding of the protein and peptides to the nitrocellulose filter, the blots were stained with Ponceau following by blocking with 5% MTBST (5% milk powder in 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 125 mm NaCl, and 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20) for ∼16 h at 4 °C. The experimental blot was then incubated with HIV-1 IN (17 μg/ml in 5% MTBST) for 1 h at room temperature, and the control blot was not incubated with IN. The filters were then washed with a solution similar to MTBST but with no milk powder (TBST). In one set of experiments (set A), the filters were incubated with mouse-anti HIV-1 IN antibodies (diluted 1:1000 in 5% MTBST) for 90 min at room temperature, following by washing with TBST. After that the incubation was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, diluted 1:500 in 5% MTBST) for 1 h at room temperature and then washed again, followed by an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction by mixing the two stock solutions at 1:1 ratio before use. These solutions are as follows: 25 mm luminol, 400 μm paracoumaric acid in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), and 5.4 mm H2O2 in 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). In a second set of experiments (set B), both blots were incubated with anti-His6-horseradish peroxidase antibody (from Sigma, diluted 1:1000 in 5% MTBST) for 90 min followed by an enhanced chemiluminescence reaction. HIV-1 RT-derived Peptides Bound to HIV-1 IN-CCD—This experiment was identical to the one described above for set B. The HIV-1 RT used here had no tag. The experimental blot was incubated with HIV-1 IN-CCD (20 μg/ml in 5% MTBST) and the other one without IN-CCD. We have shown previously (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that all three enzymatic activities performed by HIV INs, namely the 3′-end processing, the strand transfer (termed together integration), and the reverse process, the disintegration, are inhibited in vitro by RTs. Subsequently, the goal of this study was to identify the sequences in HIV-1 RT that inhibit and interact with the full-length HIV-1 IN, as well as with the IN catalytic core domain. To this end, we have used a large set of synthetic peptides that cover the whole pol gene of HIV-1 (the HXB2R isolate). The peptides were each 20 residues long with 10 amino acids overlaps between the sequential peptides. These peptides were tested for their ability to bind IN and inhibit in vitro the enzymatic activities of HIV-1 IN and of IN-CCD. DNA Polymerase Domain-derived Peptide 4286 Inhibits in Vitro the Integration Activity of HIV-1 IN—It was already shown by us that HIV INs are inhibited by the p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT, which encompasses the DNA polymerase domain (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, we first tested the sequences located within this domain of HIV-1 RT. A total of 42 peptides, designated from 4269 up to 4310 (starting from the amino-terminal peptide, see Supplemental Material), were screened for their ability to inhibit HIV-1 IN. These peptides were first tested in groups, each containing a mixture of three contiguous and partially overlapping peptides (every one at a final concentration of 90 μm). All mixtures were preincubated on ice for 5 min with 0.4 μm purified HIV-1 IN. The enzymatic assays were then initiated by adding the DNA substrate, used for testing the combined 3′-end processing and DNA joining activities of IN (oligonucleotides A and B, see under “Experimental Procedures”), followed by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min. The results obtained show that only the mixture containing peptides 4284, 4285, and 4286 inhibited the integration activity of IN (data not shown). Consequently, each of these peptides was then tested separately (at a final concentration of 270 μm) for its ability to inhibit the integration activity. The results indicated that the inhibition of IN was caused primarily by a single peptide, 4286. This peptide inhibits both IN-mediated strand transfer and 3′-end processing activities (Fig. 1). It is apparent that both activities were substantially inhibited by the peptide at a final concentration of 27 μm. As a result, the extent of inhibition was also quantified to determine the peptide concentrations inhibiting 50% of the initial IN activity (IC50 value, Table I). The value, calculated for the inhibition of the strand transfer, was about 4.5 μm, and the one for the 3′-end processing was ∼4.8 μm (Table I).Table IInhibition of HIV-1 IN activities by HIV-1 RT-derived peptidesHIV-1 RT-derived peptidesPosition in HIV-1 RT (residue no.)3′-End processing (IC50)Strand transfer (IC50)Disintegration (IC50)4286 (20-mer), KILEPFRKQNPDIVIYQYMDPalm (166-185)4.84.59.44285 (20-mer), SPAIFQSSMTKILEPFRKQNPalm (156-175)35270>1004287 (20-mer), PDIVIYQYMDDLYVGSDLEIPalm (176-195)2254>1204321 (20-mer), ELVNQIIEQLIKKEKVYLAWRNase H (516-535)6.951004320 (20-mer), IQAQPDQSESELVNQIIEQLRNase H (506-525)>120>120>1204322 (20-mer), IKKEKVYLAWVPAHKGIGNRNase H (526-545)>120>120>1204286′-1 (15-mer), FRKQNPDIVIYQYMDPalm (171-185)11997>2704321′-1 (14-mer), NQIIEQLIKKEKVYRNase H (519-532)>240>240>1205628 (15-mer), ESELVSQIIEQLIKKRNase H (514-528)>12060>120 Open table in a new tab Because every two adjacent peptides share 10-residue overlaps, we have also calculated the IC50 values for peptides 4285 and 4287 (that share sequences with the inhibitory peptide 4286). The analyses of the reaction products, which led to the calculations of the IC50 values (summarized in Table I), indicate that both 4285 and 4287 were considerably less effective than peptide 4286. Furthermore, we have also checked whether the two peptides 4285 and 4287, when tested together, demonstrate a synergistic effect by increasing their IN inhibiting capacity to a level as efficient as peptide 4286. The results showed that this is not the case, and their combined effect is still far below that of peptide 4286 (data not shown). This indicated that the inhibitory sequence of 4286 can be active only as one continuously linked sequence, which is likely to be structurally different from that of the other two peptides. Peptide 4321, Derived from the RNase H Domain, Inhibits the Integration Activity of HIV-1 IN—We have found previously that the p51 subunit of HIV-1 RT inhibits the enzymatic activities of HIV INs, without testing the residual RT p15 domain, corresponding to the RNase H domain (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This does not necessarily exclude the possibility that the p15 by itself can also exhibit inhibitory effects. To address this issue, we have tested all 15 RNase H domain-derived 20-mer peptides (peptide numbers from 4311 up to 4325). In each test, the peptides were analyzed in groups of two adjacent and partially overlapping ones (each at a final concentration of 60 μm). Only the mixture containing peptides 4321 and 4322 inhibited IN activities. Consequently, we have tested each peptide individually, and we found that only peptide 4321 was responsible for inhibiting both the 3′-end processing and strand transfer activities of HIV-1 IN (Fig. 2). The quantitative analyses indicated that the apparent IC50 values calculated for both activities were quite similar (Table I). These values are close to those calculated for peptide 4286. It should be noted that neither peptide 4320 nor peptide 4322 (that share sequences with peptide 4321) inhibited the enzymatic activity of HIV-1 IN in vitro (Table I). The Complete 20-Residue Sequences of Peptides 4286 and 4321 Are Required to Inhibit HIV-1 IN—To determine the minimal sequence requirements for the inhibition of HIV-1 IN, we have tested short peptides derived from the 20-residue peptides 4286 and 4321. These were the 15-residue-long peptide 4286′-1 and the 14-mer peptide 4321′-1, derived from 4286 and 4321, respectively. As can be seen from the apparent IC50 values (Table I), these shorter peptides were not as effective as the original 20-residue peptides in inhibiting IN enzymatic activities. In addition, we have tested for IN inhibition a battery of 15-mer peptides (with sequences that partially cover those of peptides 4286 and 4321) for their ability to inhibit IN. These peptides were part of a library of 15-mer synthetic peptides that covered the whole pol gene of HIV-1 clade B (see Supplemental Material). Eight peptides (from 5538 to 5545) covered the sequence of 4286, and eight peptides (from 5626 up to 5633) overlapped 4321. Of all 16 peptides tested, only peptide 5628 (related to peptide 4321) moderately inhibited the strand transfer activity of IN with an apparent IC50 value of ∼60 μm (as opposed to 5 μm of 4231) without showing a significant inhibition of the 3′-end processing (Table I). These results indicated the importance of the full 20-residue sequences (and potential structures of peptides 4286 and 4321) for the in vitro inhibition of HIV-1 IN. Peptide 4286 Strongly Inhibits the Disintegration Activity of HIV-1 IN—All studied retroviral INs possess in vitro, in addition to the 3′-end processing and the forward strand transfer activities, the reverse activity of disintegration. The authentic disintegration activity was already studied extensively as a major IN activity (26Chow S.A. Methods (Orlando). 1997; 12: 306-317Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 27Bushman F.D. Engelman A. Palmer I. Wingfield P. Craigie R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3428-3432Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar, 28Chow S.A. Vincent K.A. Ellison V. Brown P.O. Science. 1992; 255: 723-726Crossref PubMed Scopus (365) Google Scholar). The disintegration activity involved a specific endonucleolytic excision of the “donor viral” DNA (with the conserved 3′-end “CA” dinucleotide) from its target DNA. Given that HIV-1 RT also inhibited this activity of HIV-1 IN (12Oz I. Avidan O. Hizi A. Biochem. J. 2002; 361: 557-566Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was of interest to extend the study by testing the inhibitory effects of peptides 4286 and 4321 on the disintegration activity. We have used the 32P 5′-end-labeled 38-nt “dumbbell” substrate (oligonucleotide D, see"

Niida S. Horiguchi H. Maeda N. Fukamizu A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Expression of the gene in a cultured hippocampus slice is increased with tetraethylammonium-induced long term potentiation (1Shinozaki K. Maruyama K. Kume H. Kuzume H. Obata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Forced neurochondrin expression in neural cell line Neuro2A leads to stimulated neurite outgrowth (1Shinozaki K. Maruyama K. Kume H. Kuzume H. Obata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore, neurochondrin protein localization in dendrite and somatic regions of neurons in the developing cerebellum is suggestive of the function associated with the dendrite outgrowth (3Shinozaki K. Kume H. Kuzume H. Obata K. Maruyama K. Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1999; 71: 364-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In bone tissues, the neurochondrin gene is expressed in osteoblasts and osteocytes, and conditioned media of COS7 with forced neurochondrin expression induce bone marrow cells to absorb bone matrix (2Ishiduka Y. Mochizuki R. Yanai K. Takatsuka M. Nonomura T. Niida S. Horiguchi H. Maeda N. Fukamizu A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1450: 92-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). These facts demonstrate its possible involvement in bone metabolism. The finding that neurochondrin protein associates with semaphorin4C (a transmembrane-type semaphorin) and phosphatidic acid (a possible second messenger) indicates its role as a signal molecule (4Ohoka Y. Hirotani M. Sugimoto H. Fujioka S. Furuyama T. Inagaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Ktistakis N.T. Delon C. Manifava M. Wood E. Ganley I. Sugars J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 94-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Besides all these conceivable functions, our previous trial in disclosing its in vivo role by conventional loss of function strategy in mice failed because of its lethality in utero (6Mochizuki R. Dateki M. Yanai K. Ishizuka Y. Amizuka N. Kawashima H. Koga Y. Ozawa H. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). In addition, hemizygous mutant mouse exhibited no obvious abnormality. In this study, we eliminated the neurochondrin gene expression preferentially in the nervous system by conditional knockout strategy. Our results showed that neurochondrin is a negative regulator of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Thr-286) phosphorylation and essential for the spatial learning process but not for the differentiation or neurite outgrowth of the neuron. In addition, nervous system-specific homozygous gene disruption resulted in epileptic seizure. Targeting Vector—The region covering the neurochondrin promoter and exon1, identical to the region encompassed by NaeI and AccI sites, was floxed by KpnI-loxP sequences (5′-AAAGGTACCATAACTTCGTATAATGTATGCTATACGAAGTTAT-3′). PGK-neo-loxP cassette was placed downstream of the floxed promoter sequence, with 3.1- and 5.94-kbp homology arms placed next to it. Generation of the Mice—The targeted embryonic stem (ES) cells were aggregated with eight cell-stage embryos of BSF1, a male sterile strain. A chimeric male mouse was obtained and intercrossed with nestin-cre transgenic females for germ line transmission. PCR Analysis—An intact floxed allele was detected using primers A (5′-TCCTGCGCCTGGCAGTCAGC-3′) and B (5′-TCCCCGAGCCCATGGATCGG-3′). In the 20-μl reaction, containing 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.25 mm deoxyribonucleotide triphosphates, 1 unit of Taq polymerase (Takara), and 1 μm of the primers, PCR was carried out at 96 °C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, at 68 °C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The primer set amplifies 140- and 100-bp fragments for the targeted and wild-type alleles, respectively. A completely recombined allele was detected using primers A and C (5′-ACAGACACGGGTCAAGTTCG-3′). The reaction and the thermal cycle are the same as those for the primers A and B. The set amplifies 200-bp and 2-kbp fragments for the recombined and intact floxed alleles, respectively. Lysates and Western Blot Analysis—Whole brain and chondral tissues were homogenized with M2 lysis buffer (7Asada S. Kasuya Y. Hama H. Masaki T. Goto K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 260: 441-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) and rotated for 3 h at 4 °C, centrifuged, and then the supernatants were collected. Hippocampus tissue was homogenized with lysis buffer (20 mm HEPES, 5 mm MgCl2, 5 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and protease inhibitors) by the procedure described above. The transfected cells were lysed by 30 μl of SDS sample buffer 27 h after the transfection. 10 μg of the cell lysates, 5 μg of whole brain lysates, and 20 μg of cartilage and hippocampus lysates were applied to the Western blot analysis. Anti-mouse neurochondrin rabbit antiserum was generated against a glutathione S-transferase-neurochondrin and used in the dilution of 1:1000 with 1% skim milk/TBS (1% Tween-20). The monoclonal antibody against glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (American Research Products) and neuron-specific class III β-tubulin (Babco) and the polyclonal antibody against phospho-CaMKII (Thr-286) (Chemicon), phospho-CaMKII (Thr-305) (Chemicon), CaMKII (Stressgen), and microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (Neomarkers) were used in the dilution of 1:1000 with 1% skim milk/TBS (1% Tween-20). Histological and Immunohistochemical Analysis—4% paraformaldehyde-fixed, paraffin-embedded brains from 2-month-old NClox/loxCre and wild-type littermates were cut into 7-μm serial sections and applied to Bodian's staining (8Bodian P. Anat. Rec. 1936; 65: 89-96Crossref Scopus (455) Google Scholar). 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed whole brain of 10-month-old epileptic NClox/loxCre and age matching NClox/wtCre mice were sliced into 30-μm serial sections, and then applied to the immunostaining with primary antibody, monoclonal anti-GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) antibody (Sigma), monoclonal anti-S100β antibody (Sigma), or polyclonal anti-doublecortin antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) by the procedures described previously (9Hama H. Kasuya Y. Sakurai T. Yamada G. Suzuki N. Masaki T. Goto K. J. Neurosci. Res. 1997; 47: 590-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 10Monje M.L. Toda H. Palmer T.D. Science. 2003; 302: 1760-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (1898) Google Scholar). The sections were counterstained with hematoxyline or 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue fluorescence). For Timm's staining, brains were soaked in 0.4% Na2S 9H2O in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 2 h and then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) overnight. After overnight soaking in 30% sucrose, the frozen brains were cut into 30-μm serial sections and applied to the staining by the procedure described previously (11Parent J.M. Yu T.W. Leibowitz R.T. Geschwind D.H. Sloviter R.S. Lowenstein D.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3727-3738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Motory Function Analysis—A wire-hanging test was performed as described previously (12Freitag S. Schachner M. Morellini F. Behav. Brain Res. 2003; 145: 189-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The rod working test was performed using an iron rod 70 cm long and 90 mm in diameter wrapped with a masking tape. The experiment was performed as described elsewhere (13Osada T. Ikegami S. Takiguchi-Hayashi K. Yamazaki Y. Katoh-Fukui Y. Higashinakagawa T. Sakaki Y. Takeuchi T. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 6068-6078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Morris Water Maze—The pool was circular with a diameter of 90 cm and a height of 35 cm. The platform was 18 cm high and 10 cm in diameter. The pool was filled with 25 °C water to a depth of 19.5 cm. The center of the columnar platform was set at a distance of 15 cm from the edge of the pool. The training was repeated for seven days, three sessions/day. The experimental procedure is described elsewhere (14Crawley J.N. What's Wrong with My Mouse?: Behavioral Phenotyping of Transgenic and Knock-out Mice. Wiley-Liss, New York2000: 83-130Google Scholar). In the probe test, the swimming paths were recorded for 1 min. CaMKII Activity Assay—SignaTECT calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase assay system (Promega) was used for determination of CaMKII activity in the hippocampus lysates following the manufacturer's instructions. Cell Culture and Transfection Study—NIH3T3 cells were plated at the density of 2 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well plate and, after 18 h, transfected with 200 ng of the neurochondrin expression vector (NC-pcDNA3) and pcDNA3 using Lipofectamine reagent and Plus reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Phosphatase Activity—Calcineurin cellar activity assay kit (Calbiochem) was used for determination of phosphatase 2A (PP2A) activity following the manufacturer's instructions. The protein serine/threonine phosphatase assay system (New England Biolabs) was used for determination of phosphatase 1 (PP1) activity following the manufacturer's instructions. Generation and Basic Characterization of the Mutant Mice— To avoid early embryonic death, we generated the neural tissue-specific neurochondrin-deficient mice by the Cre-loxP system. We have previously identified the promoter and the cell type-specific regulatory regions of the mouse neurochondrin gene (15Dateki M. Mochizuki R. Yanai K. Fukamizu A. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 356: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). Because functional importance of the semaphorin4C or phosphatidic acid binding domains in the neurochondrin protein has not yet been fully investigated (4Ohoka Y. Hirotani M. Sugimoto H. Fujioka S. Furuyama T. Inagaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 237-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 5Ktistakis N.T. Delon C. Manifava M. Wood E. Ganley I. Sugars J.M. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2003; 31: 94-97Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we decided to target the promoter as well as the regulatory region for the Cre-loxP-mediated deletion. In the targeting vector, we floxed the 1.4-kbp promoter and regulatory region in the first exon (Fig. 1A), the precise location of which is described in the “Experimental Procedures.” Following linearization, the targeting vector was electroporated into TT2 ES cells, and the homologous recombination event as well as the intactness of the inserted loxP sites were verified by Southern blot analysis of EcoRI- and KpnI-digested tail genomic DNA, respectively. Diagnostic 7.9-kbp EcoRI and 1.4-kbp KpnI fragments were detected by probes A and B, respectively, in correctly targeted ES cells (Fig. 1B). Chimeric male mice, generated by aggregating the targeted ES cells and eight cell-stage embryos of BSF1 (F1 from intrastrain cross-breeding between C57B6J and SPRET/Ei), were mated with nestin-cre transgenic females (16Tronche F. Kellendonk C. Kretz O. Gass P. Anlag K. Orban P.C. Bock R. Klein R. Schutz G. Nat. Genet. 1999; 23: 99-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (1401) Google Scholar) and successfully transmitted the mutated allele to the off-spring. Transmission of the floxed allele and the presence of nestin-cre transgene in the offspring were genotyped by PCR analyses. Heterozygous floxed mice carrying the cre transgene (NClox/wtCre) were intercrossed with heterozygous floxed mice (NClox/wt) to obtain homozygous floxed mice carrying cre (NClox/loxCre). Cre-dependent recombination of the floxed gene was determined using the genomic DNAs of the brain and tail of NClox/wtCre mice. PCR analyses with the two sets of primers revealed brain-specific recombination of the floxed region. Using the primers A and B, 140-bp DNA product was amplified from the intact targeted allele but not from the recombined allele. The 140-bp product from genomic DNAs of the brains of NClox/wtCre mice was reduced compared with that of the tail (Fig. 1C). Using the primers A and C, a 200-bp DNA product was amplified from the fully recombined allele. The 200-bp product from the genomic DNAs of the brains was increased as compared with that of tail (Fig. 1C). Neurochondrin protein level in the brain (but not in the cartilage) of 2-month-old NClox/loxCre mice was drastically reduced to ∼10% of that of the wild-type littermates (Fig. 1D), indicating the successful tissue-specific disruption of the gene. The residual protein synthesis may be attributable to the incomplete Cre-loxP recombination. The level of remaining protein in the tissue extract decreased as age progressed, possibly because of the turnover of neuron from nestin-positive neural stem cells (data not shown). The neurochondrin gene was considered to participate in the neurite outgrowth or neural cell differentiation (1Shinozaki K. Maruyama K. Kume H. Kuzume H. Obata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 6Mochizuki R. Dateki M. Yanai K. Ishizuka Y. Amizuka N. Kawashima H. Koga Y. Ozawa H. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the neurite formation in the NClox/loxCre mice and found no remarkable deficiency, either in the dendrite formation of the cerebellar Purkinje cell or the axon formation of the cerebrum pyramidal cell (Fig. 1E, arrowheads). Expression of the differentiation marker of neuron, MAP2, and neuron-specific class III β-tubulin in the brains of NClox/loxCre mice did not differ from that of NClox/wtCre and wild-type littermates (Fig. 1F). We also evaluated motory ability, which is reflective of developmental abnormality in the nervous system, in NClox/lox-Cre mice by rod-walking and wire-hanging tests and found no significant differences between 2–3-month-old NClox/loxCre, NClox/wtCre, and wild-type mice (Fig. 1G). These findings demonstrated that the neurochondrin gene played no essential role in the neurite outgrowth and neural cell differentiation in the developmental process. Learning Defect of the NClox/loxCre Mice—It is suggested that the rat neurochondrin gene was involved in a hippocampal synaptic plasticity (1Shinozaki K. Maruyama K. Kume H. Kuzume H. Obata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Hence, we investigated the spatial learning ability by Morris water maze test. Because we found no obvious phenotype in conventional hemizygotes (6Mochizuki R. Dateki M. Yanai K. Ishizuka Y. Amizuka N. Kawashima H. Koga Y. Ozawa H. Fukamizu A. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2003; 310: 1219-1226Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar), NClox/wtCre mice were used as a control in this study. In the training session, NClox/loxCre mice spent more time in searching the submerged platform than NClox/wtCre control mice (Fig. 2A, p < 0.05 on the second day's session). In the probe test, NClox/wtCre mice spent significantly longer time (45% of the total trail time, p < 0.01) in the A quadrant than in the other quadrants, as expected, because it formerly contained the platform (Fig. 2B). In contrast, time spent by NClox/loxCre mice in the A quadrant was not significantly different from that in the other two quadrants (B, C) and was only significantly different from that in the D quadrant (Fig. 2B). Thus, the neural tissue-specific neurochondrin deficiency in mice resulted in a serious spatial learning defect, indicating its essential role in the process of spatial learning. Epileptic Seizure of the NClox/loxCre Mice—We noticed that some mice displayed epileptic seizure (∼24% of NClox/loxCre) when they aged over 6 months (Fig. 3A, supplemental movie). The epileptic seizures were often observed when we placed the mice in the new cages, and in some cases, the fit resulted in death. Seizures are sometimes observed in Alzheimer disease (17Armon C. Peterson G.W. Liwnicz B.H. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2000; 17: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Because motory ability is remarkably impaired in neurodegenerative disease, we therefore analyzed this in the 6-month-old NClox/loxCre mice (17Armon C. Peterson G.W. Liwnicz B.H. J. Clin. Neurophysiol. 2000; 17: 511-518Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The scores of NClox/loxCre mice in both wire-hanging and rod-walking tests were not significantly different from those of the control NClox/wtCre mice (Fig. 3B). We found no apoptotic cell death in the 6-monthold NClox/loxCre mouse brain (data not shown), suggesting that the epileptic seizure observed in NClox/loxCre mice was not attributable to the neurodegeneration. Morphological alteration of the hippocampus is a prominent example of epileptic seizure, because it is observed in animal models of epilepsy and also in human epileptic patients (18Khurgel M. Switzer III, R.C. Teskey G.C. Spiller A.E. Racine R.J. Ivy G.O. Neurobiol. Dis. 1995; 2: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Morimoto K. Fahnestock M. Racine R.J. Prog. Neurobiol. 2004; 73: 1-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 20Bendotti C. Guglielmetti F. Tortarolo M. Samanin R. Hirst W.D. Exp. Neurol. 2000; 161: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Immunostaining with anti-doublecortin polyclonal antibody revealed that newborn neuroblasts generated from the subgranular zone of dentate gyrus were rather increased in the epileptic NClox/loxCre mouse (Fig. 3C). Likewise, ectopic innervation of the mossy fibers into the stratum oriens in the CA3 region was observed (Fig. 3D, arrows). These findings showed good agreement with the previous report of pilocarpine-induced status epilepticus (11Parent J.M. Yu T.W. Leibowitz R.T. Geschwind D.H. Sloviter R.S. Lowenstein D.H. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 3727-3738Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the hilus of the dentate gyrus of epileptic NClox/loxCre mice (Fig. 3E), a number of reactive astrocyte-like cells were observed, which was highly immunoreactive to the antibody against GFAP and S100β, an acidic calcium binding protein. Under a high power field microscope, both GFAP- and S100β-expressing cells clearly showed hypertrophic profiles with the thick processes from the large cell body when compared with NClox/wtCre mice. Astrocytes play a major support role for a wide range of neural processes, including neural growth and sprouting, and are observed to be activated in the process of epileptogenesis (18Khurgel M. Switzer III, R.C. Teskey G.C. Spiller A.E. Racine R.J. Ivy G.O. Neurobiol. Dis. 1995; 2: 23-35Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 19Morimoto K. Fahnestock M. Racine R.J. Prog.

Neurol. 2000; 161: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Taken together, these age-dependent phenotypes are related at least to the progressive neurochondrin deficiency by neural cell turnover, although some other pathophysiological factor possibly affecting the rate of incidence is still unclear. Effect of Neurochondrin on CaMKII Phosphorylation—Defects of several components of the signal cascade related to the synaptic plasticity could cause learning defects or epileptic seizure (21Silva A.J. Paylor R. Wehner J.M. Tonegawa S. Science. 1992; 257: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar, 22Butler L.S. Silva A.J. Abeliovich A. Watanabe Y. Tonegawa S. McNamara J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6852-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 23Reisel D. Bannerman D.M. Schmitt W.B. Deacon R.M. Flint J. Borchardt T. Seeburg P.H. Rawlins J.N. Nat. Neurosci. 2002; 5: 868-873Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar, 24Brusa R. Zimmermann F. Koh D.S. Feldmeyer D. Gass P. Seeburg P.H. Sprengel R. Science. 1995; 270: 1677-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (476) Google Scholar). We examined the protein level and the phosphorylation status of CaMKII, a critical mediator of synaptic plasticity, in the hippocampus of 8–9-month-old NClox/wtCre and NClox/loxCre mice. We used non-epileptic NClox/loxCre mice for the following assays to exclude the possibility of epileptic seizure-augmented CaMKII activity. Phosphorylation of threonine 286 of CaMKII was remarkably increased in the hippocampus of NClox/loxCre in comparison to the control mice but not of threonine 305, an inhibitory phosphorylation site (25Elgersma Y. Fedorov N.B. Ikonen S. Choi E.S. Elgersma M. Carvalho O.M. Giese K.P. Silva A.J. Neuron. 2002; 36: 493-505Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4A). In accordance with these results, the activity of CaMKII also increased in the hippocampus of NClox/loxCre mice (Fig. 4B). Thus, the neurochondrin gene might act as a negative regulator of CaMKII (Thr-286) phosphorylation. To address this notion, we transiently overexpressed the neurochondrin gene in NIH3T3 cells, in which its endogenous gene expression is negligible (15Dateki M. Mochizuki R. Yanai K. Fukamizu A. Neurosci. Lett. 2004; 356: 107-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). A significant reduction in the phosphorylation of endogenous CaMKII was clearly shown (Fig. 4C). These results suggest that a decrease in neurochondrin simply leads CaMKII activation in NClox/loxCre mice. Then, we further examined whether neurochondrin negatively regulates CaMKII phosphorylation through PP1 and PP2A, because it is well established that these phosphatases are the major regulators for CaMKII phosphorylation (26Fukunaga K. Kobayashi T. Tamura S. Miyamoto E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 133-137Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and involved in synaptic plasticity (27Coussens C.M. Teyler T.J. Synapse. 1996; 24: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The activity of PP1 and PP2A in the hippocampus lysates of 8–9-month-old NClox/wtCre and NClox/loxCre mice were compared (Fig. 4D) and showed no significant difference, suggesting that neurochondrin negatively regulates CaMKII, not in the two-phosphatase-dependent manner, but by other direct or indirect pathways existing in the downstream of the neurochondrin. The site-specific manner of neurochondrin for CaMKII (Thr-286) is of much interest but requires further precise investigation. Transgenic mice carrying the constitutive active form of CaMKII α subunit show learning defects and long term potentiation abnormality (28Bach M.E. Hawkins R.D. Osman M. Kandel E.R. Mayford M. Cell. 1995; 81: 905-915Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 29Mayford M. Wang J. Kandel E.R. O'Dell T.J. Cell. 1995; 81: 891-904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). The CaMKII α subunit-deficient mice display the impairment of long term potentiation and the spatial learning defect (30Silva A.J. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Wang Y. Science. 1992; 257: 201-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (1161) Google Scholar, 21Silva A.J. Paylor R. Wehner J.M. Tonegawa S. Science. 1992; 257: 206-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (1067) Google Scholar), and the mice are epileptic (22Butler L.S. Silva A.J. Abeliovich A. Watanabe Y. Tonegawa S. McNamara J.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 6852-6855Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Appropriate regulation of CaMKII phosphorylation must be required for normal synaptic plasticity and neural transmission. The phenotypes observed in the tissue-specific neurochondrin-deficient mice, such as learning defects and epileptic seizures, could therefore be attributed to the increase of CaMKII (Thr-286) phosphorylation. The level of neurochondrin gene expression is correlated with the long term potentiation-like synaptic potentiation induced by tetraethylammonium (1Shinozaki K. Maruyama K. Kume H. Kuzume H. Obata K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 240: 766-771Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Thus, it is highly plausible that the neurochondrin gene is a negative regulator for CaMKII activity.

https://openalex.org/W85328307,"Advances in the life sciences, especially in molecular biology and informatics, and the potential for misuse of scientific research (the dual-use dilemma) raise the possibility that an act of terrorism could involve biological agents. International consensus is crucial on the steps needed to reduce this grave threat to humanity. One such step is to ensure that all people and institutions involved in science are aware of their ethical obligations. An important way to promote the necessary international consensus and to raise the necessary awareness is through adoption of a code of ethics to govern research in the life sciences. It is with this thought that we set out to capture the critical elements that a code of ethics for the life sciences should include--one that we believe can help prevent the life sciences from becoming the death sciences (see the table)."
https://openalex.org/W2054216132,"We previously cloned mouse RDH11 (mRDH11) as a gene regulated by the transcription factor sterol regulatory element-binding proteins and showed that it is a retinol dehydrogenase expressed in non-ocular tissues such as the liver and testis and in the retina (Kasus-Jacobi, A., Ou, J., Bashmakov, Y. K., Shelton, J. M., Richardson, J. A., Goldstein, J. L., and Brown, M. S. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 278, 32380–32389).

In this work, we describe our studies on the ocular function of mRDH11. We created a knockout mouse by replacing the mrdh11 coding sequence with the lacZ reporter gene for expression profiling. 5-Bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (X-Gal) staining demonstrated active transcription of this gene in photoreceptor cells. We show by immunoblot analysis that mRDH11 is associated with retinal membranes purified from a non-outer segment fraction of the retina. No obvious retinal defect was found during development and aging of RDH11-deficient mice. The functional consequences of mRDH11 disruption were investigated by electroretinography. Dark adaptation was delayed by a factor of 2.5–3 compared with wild-type mice. However, the kinetics of 11-cis-retinal recycling during dark adaptation was not affected, suggesting that mRDH11 is not involved in the visual cycle. We propose that mRDH11 disruption affects retinoid metabolism in photoreceptor inner segments and delays the kinetics of dark adaptation through modulation of calcium homeostasis.

Short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases form a large family of functionally heterogeneous enzymes. The vast majority of them are NAD(P)(H)-dependent oxidoreductases and display specificity toward a wide spectrum of substrates ranging from steroids, retinoids, prostaglandins, and carbohydrates to xenobiotics. In humans, ∼60 members of this family have been identified in the genome (1Kallberg Y. Oppermann U. Jèornvall H. Persson B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 636-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Some of them have been associated with important functions and lead to various diseases if mutated (2Oppermann U.C. Filling C. Jèornvall H. Chem. Biol. Interact. 2001; 130–132: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The function of several members of this family is still unknown.

For convenience, we will refer to the human protein as hRDH11 and to the mouse protein as mRDH11. The function of this protein is unknown. Both human and mouse enzyme activities have been characterized in vitro. They are able to reduce both all-trans- and cis-retinaldehydes with low Km values ranging from 0.1 to 1 μm (3Kasus-Jacobi A.

In addition to retinaldehydes, mRDH11 catalyzes the reduction of short-chain aldehydes such as nonanal with Km = 30 μm (3Kasus-Jacobi A. Ou J. Bashmakov Y.K. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32380-32389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Such activity has not been studied for the human protein. Both enzymes specifically use NADP(H) as coenzyme. Expression of mRDH11 has been examined in various mouse tissues; it was found abundantly in the liver and testis (3Kasus-Jacobi A. Ou J.

As revealed by immunofluorescence, the protein is also expressed in four layers of the mouse retina, including photoreceptor inner segments (3Kasus-Jacobi A. Ou J. Bashmakov Y.K. Shelton J.M.

Northern blot analysis showed that hRDH11 is expressed in a wide variety of human tissues, including the liver, testis, and prostate (4Lin B. White J.T. Ferguson C. Wang S. Vessella R. Bumgarner R. True L.D. Hood L. Nelson P.S. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 1611-1618PubMed Google Scholar). By immunofluorescence using a monoclonal antibody generated against hRDH11, a signal was detected in monkey and bovine eye, mostly in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) (6Haeseleer F. Jang G.F.

Only a faint signal was detected in photoreceptor inner segments (6Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S. Palczewski K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 45537-45546Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Expression of mRDH11 in photoreceptor cells and its high affinity for retinoid substrates suggest that this enzyme is involved in retinoid metabolism in the eye. In higher animals, retinoids have two distinct functions: regulation of gene expression for morphogenesis and differentiation of vitamin A-dependent tissues and light absorption in the retina. Vertebrate eye development requires vitamin A (all-trans-retinol) as demonstrated in gestational vitamin A deficiency studies, where ocular defects were one of the most common malformations observed (8Wilson J.G. Roth C.B. Warkany J. Am. J. Anat. 1953; 92: 189-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). Vitamin A is also critically involved in vision as a source of 11-cis-retinal. Vertebrate vision begins with the absorption of light by visual pigments in photoreceptor cells. Visual pigments, or opsins, are seven membrane-spanning, G-protein-coupled receptors located in the outer segment disc membranes of rods and cones. The light-sensitive chromophore 11-cis-retinal is covalently attached to opsin proteins in the dark. Light stimulation results in isomerization of 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal, which causes a change in the conformation of rhodopsin. The resulting photoactivated metarhodopsin II triggers the phototransduction cascade that leads to the generation of an electrical signal and ultimately to inhibition of neurotransmitter release at the synaptic terminus. After isomerization, all-trans-retinal is released from opsin and enzymatically converted to all-trans-retinol by a retinol dehydrogenase (RDH). This activity has been characterized; it is located in the membrane of outer segment discs and is NADPH-dependent (9Blaner W.S. Churchich J.E. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 820-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 10Nicotra C. Livrea M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 11836-11841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Ishiguro S.

Candidate RDHs, photoreceptor RDH and RDH14, have been identified, but their functions have not been demonstrated in vivo (6Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M. Nelson P.S.

All-trans-retinol is then transported to the RPE, where it is ultimately converted to 11-cis-retinol and oxidized to 11-cis-retinal by RDH5. This enzyme is located in the RPE and is NAD-dependent. It was suggested that there are additional not yet identified RDHs catalyzing this step, and hRDH11 was proposed to be one of them (6Haeseleer F. Jang G.F. Imanishi Y. Driessen C.A. Matsumura M.

This biochemical pathway is referred to as the visual cycle (15Saari J.C. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2000; 41: 337-348PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a number of RDHs that belong to the retinal short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase 1 family have been cloned (Table I). They are proposed to function in the visual cycle, although, with the exception of RDH5 and RDH12, their roles have not been demonstrated in vivo. Mutations in RDH5 cause a mild retinal disease called fundus albipunctatus, which is characterized by delayed dark adaptation (16Yamamoto H. Simon A. Eriksson U. Harris E. Berson E.L. Dryja T.P. Nat.

We disrupted the rdh11 gene in mice and showed a delay in dark adaptation in these mice, confirming the role of this enzyme in vision. However, our results show that this delay is not due to a defect in 11-cis-retinal regeneration in knockout mice. We propose that mRDH11 disruption affects retinoid metabolism in photoreceptor inner segments and delays the kinetics of dark adaptation through modulation of calcium homeostasis. Materials—We obtained mouse monoclonal anti-GRK1 (G-protein-associated rhodopsin kinase-1) IgG from Affinity BioReagents; X-gal from Gold Biotechnology, Inc.; and other chemicals, including all-trans-retinol, all-trans-retinal, and all-trans-retinyl palmitate, from Sigma. All-trans-retinal was used to produce all-trans-retinal oximes (syn and anti) as described (20Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These retinoids and derivatives were used as standards for HPLC analysis. Generation of rdh11 Knockout Mice and Genotyping—VelociGene, a high-throughput automated approach used to generate RDH11 knockout mice (along with 199 other knockouts), has been described (21Valenzuela D.M.

The resulting mice were genotyped by Southern blot analysis of BamHI-digested tail DNA using a DNA probe (0.7-kb fragment) starting 1.5 kb upstream of the first exon and by PCR using primers 5′-GGATGAAGGGAAGAGAGAGCAGAAG-3′, 5′-GAGTCAATTAGTGGCCAGAG-3′, and 5′-GTCTGTCCTAGCTTCCTCACTG-3′. Animal Tissues—Tissues were collected immediately after killing the animals. For retinoid extraction, eyes were enucleated; the lens was removed through a small incision made with a surgical blade at the anterior pole of the eye; and the remaining eye globe was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. For immunoblotting, all operations were done at 4 °C. After enucleation, each eye was dissected as follows. A small incision was made at the anterior pole to release the intraglobular pressure, and the whole anterior half of the eye was removed using a pair of fine dissecting scissors. The anterior half of the eye and the lens were discarded. The retina was then gently peeled using a pair of fine dissecting forceps and kept in sucrose buffer at 4 °C until homogenization and fractionation. For X-gal staining, anesthetized mice were fixed via transcardial perfusion with 0.2% glutaraldehyde, and tissues of interest were dissected and grossly trimmed prior to embedding in optimal cutting temperature freezing matrix. Specimens were snap-frozen by partial immersion in liquid nitrogen-supercooled isopentane. Cryosections (8 μm thick) were prepared, mounted on silanated microscope slides, and air-dried. Slides were briefly stored at –80 °C prior to β-galactosidase detection. For paraffin histology, the eyes were enucleated, placed in paraformaldehyde fixative, and processed according to established procedures (22Sheehan D.C. Hrapchak B.B. Theory and Practice of Histotechnology. 2nd Ed. Battelle Press, Columbus, OH1980Google Scholar, 23Woods A.E. Ellis R.C. Laboratory Histopathology: A Complete Reference. Churchhill Livingstone, Kent, United Kingdom1994Google Scholar). Protein Extraction and Immunoblotting—Rod outer segment (ROS) and “rest of the retina” (RR) membrane fractions were prepared by discontinuous sucrose gradient centrifugation as described (24Martin R.E. Ranchon-Cole I. Brush R.S. Williamson C.R. Hopkins S.A. Li F. Anderson R.E. Mol. Vis. 2004; 10: 199-207PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, retinas were homogenized with a Teflon/glass homogenizer in buffer A (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.17 g/ml sucrose, and protease inhibitor mixture (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin A)). Discontinuous sucrose gradients (1.11, 1.13, and 1.17 g/ml) were centrifuged at 105,000 × g for 70 min. The 1.11/1.13 g/ml interfacial band-containing ROS fractions and the 1.13/1.17 g/ml interfacial band-containing RR fractions were collected, separately diluted with 10 volumes of buffer A without sucrose, and centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min to pellet membrane fractions. Membrane fractions were resuspended in SDS buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Liver and testis proteins were extracted as described previously (3Kasus-Jacobi A. Ou J. Bashmakov Y.K. Shelton J.M.

Immunoblot analysis were carried out using rabbit polyclonal anti-RDH11 antibody as described (3Kasus-Jacobi A. Ou J. Bashmakov Y.K. Shelton J.M. Richardson J.A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 32380-32389Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or mouse monoclonal anti-GRK1 IgG. β-Galactosidase Detection—Slides with mounted cryosections were thawed and washed with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) containing 2 mm MgCl2 to remove the optimal cutting temperature freezing matrix. Sections were equilibrated in X-gal rinse buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 2 mm MgCl2, 0.01% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, and 0.02% (v/v) Nonidet P-40) for 5 min. Staining was conducted overnight at 37 °C in X-gal staining solution (X-gal rinse buffer containing 5 mm potassium ferricyanide, 5 mm ferrocyanide, and 1 mg/ml X-gal in dimethyl formamide (4% (v/v) dimethyl formamide final concentration)). At the conclusion of staining, sections were post-fixed in formalin, rinsed in phosphate-buffered saline, counterstained with or without 0.1% nuclear fast red, rinsed in running water, dehydrated, and cleared, and coverslips were applied with permanent mounting medium. Histology—5–10 hematoxylin- and eosin-stained paraffin sections were prepared from each eye in the plane of the vertical meridian and through the optic nerve head. The thickness of the outer nuclear layer was measured at approximate 0.33-mm intervals from the optic nerve head using an ocular reticle. Mouse Electroretinograms (ERGs)—Full-field ERGs were obtained in a ganzfeld dome from 13 rdh11 knockout mice and eight wild-type mice. Mice were dark-adapted overnight prior to testing. Following pupil dilation (cyclopentolate hydrochloride), mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (200 mg/kg of body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg of body weight). Anesthetized mice were kept on a heating pad at 37 °C during recordings. A gold wire coil placed on one cornea was referenced to a needle electrode in the scalp. A needle electrode in the tail served as ground. Signals were amplified (Tektronix AM502 differential amplifier; ×10,000, 3 dB down at 2 and 10,000 Hz), digitized (sampling rate of 1.25–5 kHz), and averaged on a personal computer. Two different flash stimulators were utilized. A Grass photostimulator provided short wavelength 20-μs flashes (Wratten 47A: maximum of 470 nm and half-bandwidth of 55 nm) from –3 to 1 log scot td/s (log scotopic troland-seconds) in 0.3 log unit steps. A Novatron flash unit produced short wavelength 1.3-ms flashes (Wratten W47B: maximum of 449 nm and half-bandwidth of 47 nm) from 1 to 3.4 log scot td/s in 0.3 log unit steps. A second Novatron flash unit was mounted in the dome for two-flash studies. Cone ERG responses were isolated by presenting stimuli on a rod saturation (40 candelas/m2) background. A quantitative measure of the rod-mediated s-wave response was provided by fitting V-log I functions with the Michaelis-Menten relation (V = I/(I + k)·Vmax) to determine the parameters of sensitivity (k) and maximum s-wave amplitude (Vmax). The leading edge of the rod a-wave was fit by a computational model of the activation phase of phototransduction (25Hood D.C. Birch D.G. Vision Res. 1993; 33: 1605-1618Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar, 26Hood D.C. Birch D.G. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 2948-2961PubMed Google Scholar, 27Breton M.E. Schueller A.W. Lamb T.D. Pugh Jr., E.N. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1994; 35: 295-309PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the transduction model of Lamb and Pugh (28Lamb T.D. Pugh E.N. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1992; 499: 719-758Crossref Scopus (505) Google Scholar), the leading edge is defined by P3(I,t) = (1 – exp(–i·S(t – td))2)Rm for t > td, where P3 is the sum of the responses of individual rods. The amplitude of P3 is a function of flash intensity (I) and time (t) after flash onset. S is a sensitivity parameter that scales i. Rm is the maximum response, and td is a brief delay. Rod-mediated responses were fit to a computational model developed by Birch et al. (29Birch D.G. Hood D.C. Nusinowitz S. Pepperberg D.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1603-1614PubMed Google Scholar) to determine transduction parameters for photoreceptor responses. Computational modeling was also used to evaluate on-bipolar responses and oscillatory components. Cone function was evaluated with flicker responses to various frequencies and by intensity response functions. Possible defects in the visual cycle were analyzed by measuring the time course of dark adaptation (recovery of rod photoreceptor sensitivity) following a 5-min exposure to 400 lux. ERGs were recorded after presenting bright probe flashes at various times up to 3 h following the bleach. Paired-flash ERG analysis were used to determine the inactivation kinetics of the massed rod response after a test flash of intensity of 1.5 log scot td/s followed at different times by a bright probe flash (29Birch D.G. Hood D.C. Nusinowitz S. Pepperberg D.R. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1995; 36: 1603-1614PubMed Google Scholar). Extraction and HPLC Analysis of Retinoids—All procedures related to extraction and derivatization of retinoids from dissected mouse eyes were carried out as described (20Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using hydroxylamine to break Schiff base bonds. Retinoids were separated by normal phase HPLC using an HP 1050 HPLC system with a diode array detector and Hewlett Packard ChemStation A.06.03 software. The stationary phase was a Supelcosil LC-Si column (15 cm × 4.6 mm, 3 μm), and the mobile phase was a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate at the recommended ratios (20Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The flow rate was 1 ml/min; the injection volume was 50 μl; and the detection wavelengths were 325 nm for retinol and retinyl ester and 360 nm for retinal detection. All reactions involving retinoids were carried out under dim red light. Peaks were identified by their retention time and their absorbance spectra using previously described properties for 11-cis-retinoids (20Garwin G.G. Saari J.C. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 316: 313-324Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and standards for all-trans-retinoids. The amount of each retinoid is expressed as a percentage of the total retinoid extracted from a pair of eyes. Fig. 1A summarizes the strategy used to eliminate the rdh11 transcript in mice. A 15.7-kb region of the mrdh11 gene was replaced with a sequence encoding bacterial β-galactosidase (lacZ) for expression profiling in tandem with the neomycin resistance gene (neo), allowing the selection of both bacteria and embryonic stem cells. A representative Southern blot of genomic tail DNA prepared from rdh11+/+, rdh11+/–, and rdh11–/– mice is shown in Fig. 1B. Immunoblot analysis demonstrat"
https://openalex.org/W2020789576,"Surfactant deficiency contributes to acute lung injury and may result from the elaboration of bioactive lipids such as oxysterols. We observed that the oxysterol 22-hydroxycholesterol (22-HC) in combination with its obligate partner, 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA), decreased surfactant phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) synthesis by increasing phosphorylation of the regulatory enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase-α (CCTα). Phosphorylation of CCTα decreased its activity. 22-HC/9-cis-RA inhibition of PtdCho synthesis was blocked by PD98059 or dominant-negative ERK (p42 kinase). Overexpression of constitutively active MEK1, the kinase upstream of p42 kinase, increased CCTα phosphorylation. Expression of truncated CCTα mutants lacking proline-directed sites within the C-terminal phosphorylation domain partially blocked oxysterol-mediated inhibition of PtdCho synthesis. Mutagenesis of Ser315 within CCTα was both required and sufficient to confer significant resistance to 22-HC/9-cis-RA inhibition of PtdCho synthesis. A novel putative ERK-docking domain N-terminal to this phosphoacceptor site was mapped within the CCTα membrane-binding domain (residues 287–300). The results are the first demonstration of a physiologically relevant phosphorylation site and docking domain within CCTα that serve as targets for ERKs, resulting in inhibition of surfactant synthesis.

The results are the first demonstration of a physiologically relevant phosphorylation site and docking domain within CCTα that serve as targets for ERKs, resulting in inhibition of surfactant synthesis. Pulmonary surfactant is an essential mixture containing primarily disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPtdCho) 1The abbreviations used are: DSPtdCho, disaturated phosphatidylcholine; LXR, liver X receptor; 9-cis-RA, 9-cis-retinoic acid; RXR, 9-cis-retinoic acid receptor; PtdCho, phosphatidylcholine; CCT, CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; 22-HC, 22-hydroxycholesterol; MLE, murine lung epithelial; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. and key proteins that provide stability to alveoli by lowering surface tension. Surfactant is synthesized within lung type II alveolar epithelia and packaged within lamellar bodies, an intracellular storage form of surfactant, prior to secretion into the alveolar lumen. Deficiency of surfactant DSPtdCho contributes to the pathogenesis of acute lung injury, a disorder characterized by leakage of serum proteins into the alveolus, resulting in severe respiratory compromise (1Emmett M. Fowler A.A. Hyers T.M. Crowle A.J. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1987; 184: 83-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Recent studies in our laboratory (2Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and by others (3Heeley E.L. Hohlfeld J.M. Krug N. Postle A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L305-L311PubMed Google Scholar) suggest that cholesterol-enriched low density lipoproteins are important serum components that accumulate in the alveolus. Once oxidized, these modified lipoproteins have the ability to impair DSPtdCho synthesis within alveolar type II cells (2Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 3Heeley E.L. Hohlfeld J.M. Krug N. Postle A.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: L305-L311PubMed Google Scholar). Oxysterols are oxygenated derivatives of cholesterol and important constituents of oxidized low density lipoproteins that are detected in association with surfactant during acute lung injury (4Pulfer M.K. Murphy R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26331-26338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Oxysterols are present in human lung and exert potent biological effects by controlling expression of diverse genes via binding to liver X receptors (LXRs), members of the nuclear receptor superfamily (5Edwards P.A. Kennedy M.A. Mak P.A. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 38: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar, 6Bjorkhem I. Meaney S. Diczfalusy U. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 2002; 13: 247-253Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). As a prerequisite for nuclear transduction of oxysterol signaling, LXRs form heterodimers with their obligate partner, the 9-cis-retinoic acid (9-cis-RA) receptor (RXR), which binds to LXR/RXR response elements within target genes, thereby regulating transcription (5Edwards P.A. Kennedy M.A. Mak P.A. Vascul. Pharmacol. 2002; 38: 249-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). However, not all regulation by oxysterols and 9-cis-RA is transcriptional, as rapid activation of target proteins (e.g. kinases) has been demonstrated within minutes by these agonists via non-genomic mechanisms (7Ares M.P. Porn-Ares M.I. Moses S. Thyberg J. Juntti-Berggren L. Berggren P. Hultgardh-Nilsson A. Kallin B. Nilsson J. Atherosclerosis. 2000; 153: 23-35Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 8Yu Y.M. Han P.L. Lee J.K. Neuroreport. 2003; 14: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). One recognized target for oxysterols is the ATP-binding cassette transporter family of transmembrane proteins. The ABCA1 gene is involved in the efflux of cellular phospholipid and cholesterol from the plasma membrane; our recent study (9Agassandian M. Mathur S.N. Zhou J. Field F.J. Mallampalli R.K. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2004; 31: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) shows that oxysterols deplete surfactant PtdCho in lung epithelia in part by ABCA1-driven basolateral phospholipid export. However, the effects of oxysterols on PtdCho synthesis have not been investigated. The synthesis of surfactant PtdCho is tightly regulated by the rate-limiting enzyme CTP:phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CCT; CTP:choline-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, EC 2.7.7.15), which catalyzes the conversion of choline phosphate to CDP-choline utilizing CTP (10Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CCT has been purified to homogeneity, and cDNAs from several species have been identified and cloned (10Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The primary structure of CCT (termed CCTα) in mammals consists of four functional domains, including an N-terminal nuclear localization signal, a catalytic core, an α-helical lipid-binding domain, and a C-terminal phosphorylation domain (10Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CCTα is localized to the nuclear membrane, but in alveolar epithelia, it is cytoplasmic, largely associated with plasma and endoplasmic reticulum membranes (11Ridsdale R. Tseu I. Wang J. Post M. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49148-49155Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In addition to CCTα, two additional splice variants encoded by a different gene (CCTβ1 and CCTβ2) have been identified in human (12Lykidis A. Baburina I. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 26992-27001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). These isoforms differ in the extent of their C-terminal phosphorylation, but share some similar regulatory features. CCT activity in cells is regulated extensively by exogenous lipids, as both activating and inhibitory lipids have been identified (10Kent C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1348: 79-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). CCTα is also a phosphoenzyme, although the precise physiological role of CCTα phosphorylation in vivo is unknown. The degree by which lipids alter CCT activity is influenced by its phosphorylation status, and phosphorylation of CCTα reduces its activity in vitro (13Yang W. Jackowski S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16503-16506Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 14Cornell R.B. Kalmar G.B. Kay R.J. Johnson M.A. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 699-708Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). CCTα phosphorylation is restricted to 16 serines located within the C terminus. Seven of these serines are followed by prolines, suggestive of a role for proline-directed kinases, such as p34cdc2 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), in CCTα regulation (15MacDonald J.I. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10529-10537Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, CCTα is an in vitro substrate for MAPK, and ras-transfected cells exhibit increased CCTα phosphorylation in vivo (16Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 17Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Paul C. Geilen C.C. Orfanos C.E. J. Biol.

Chem. 2003; 278: 14753-14761Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, mutagenesis of consensus proline-directed phosphorylation sites or expression of a truncated CCTα mutant lacking the phosphorylation domain results in an enzyme that is phenotypically similar to wild-type CCTα, thus calling into question the physiological role of proline-directed kinases and their link with PtdCho synthesis (19Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 18948-18952Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 20Wang Y. Kent C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 17843-17849Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). There are mounting data suggesting not only that proline-directed kinases target specific motifs ((Ser/Thr)-Pro) within substrates, but that the efficiency and specificity of phosphorylation of the acceptor site are regulated by binding of MAPKs to scaffolding complexes and distinct docking sites (21Pouyssegur J. Volmat V. Lenormand P. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2002; 64: 755-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar). Docking domains are present within all members of the MAPK cascade, including c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38 kinase, and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), such as p42/44 kinase. Many MAPKs use a negatively charged conserved docking domain that interacts with motifs within target substrates that contain basic or hydrophobic residues; these sequences are usually located upstream of the kinase phosphorylation site (22Biondi R.M. Nebreda A.R. Biochem. J. 2003; 372: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the pathophysiological role of CCTα phosphorylation within the context of oxysterol exposure in alveolar epithelia. We observed that LXR/RXR agonists greatly diminished cellular PtdCho levels by inhibiting its biosynthesis via site-specific phosphorylation of CCTα catalyzed by ERK. In the process of investigating MAPK phosphorylation of CCTα, we identified a distinct docking domain for ERK residing within the membrane-binding domain of the enzyme.

Cell Culture—MLE cells were maintained in Hite's medium with 2% fetal bovine serum at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. After reaching 70% confluence, the cells were harvested using 0.25% trypsin with 0.1% EDTA and plated onto either 12-well or 60-mm tissue culture dishes. After incubation overnight, the medium was replaced with serum-free Hite's medium alone (control medium) or in combination with various amounts of 22-HC (5–30 μm) with or without 9-cis-RA (1 μm) for up to 48 h. In some experiments, cells were exposed to PD98059 (10 μm) for 1 h prior to addition of 22-HC and 9-cis-RA. Cells lysates were prepared by brief sonication in 150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 1.0 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.025% sodium azide, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pH 7.4) at 4 °C. PtdCho and DSPtdCho Analysis—Cells cultured in Hite's medium alone or containing agonists for up to 48 h were pulsed with 2 μCi of [methyl-3H]choline chloride during the final 2–4 h of incubation. Total cellular lipids were extracted from equal amounts of cellular protein using the method of Bligh and Dyer (24Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (43132) Google Scholar). Lipids were resolved by thin layer chromatography, and PtdCho or DSPtdCho was quantitated by scintillation counting as described (25Gilfillan A.M. Chu A.J. Smart D.A. Rooney S.A. J. Lipid Res. 1983; 24: 1651-1656Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PtdCho mass was assayed by measuring lipid phosphorus content (26Mallampalli R.K. Ryan A.J. Salome R.G. Jackowski S. J.

The dilution factor for anti-CCTα, anti-phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK, and anti-Cdc2 kinase antibodies was 1:1000, and that for anti-protein kinase C antibody was 1:100. To control for loading, blots were also probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody to β-actin or total p42/44 kinase at 1:1000 dilution. In separate experiments, lysates from cells transiently transfected with pCMV5-CCTα-His plasmids were harvested using M-PER mammalian protein extraction reagent. CCTα-His proteins were purified using the B-PER 6xHis spin purification kit (Pierce) following the manufacturer's instructions. The levels of phosphoserine, phosphorylated p42/44 MAPK, protein kinase C, Cdc2 kinase, and CCTα were then determined by probing membranes with antibody at 1:1000 dilution, and those of protein kinase C at 1:100 dilution. ERK Kinase Assay—To assess ERK kinase activity in vivo, cells were cotransfected with the pTET-Elk and pTRE-luc plasmids following the manufacturer's instructions in the presence or absence of a constitutively active MEK1 plasmid as described previously (27Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27858-27864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 28Stancovski I. Baltimore D. Cell. 1997; 91: 299-302Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). The pTET-Elk plasmid expresses Elk-1 (Ets-like transcription factor-1), an ERK-dependent transactivator that, if phosphorylated, activates the luciferase reporter gene contained in pTRE-luc. After 24 h, cells were stimulated with or without 22-HC (25 μm) and 9-cis-RA (1 μm) for up to 24 h, and luciferase activity, which was normalized to protein, was measured (27Carter A.B. Hunninghake G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 27858-27864Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of CCTα and p42/44 Kinase—Immunoprecipitation was performed with the rabbit IgG TrueBlot set according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cell lysates (250 μl) were first precleared with 25 μl of anti-rabbit IgG beads for 1 h on ice. Subsequently, 2.5 μg of primary antibody to CCTα or p42/44 kinase, normal rabbit IgG, or preimmune serum was added to precleared lysates and incubated on ice for an additional 1 h. Samples were then incubated overnight at 4 °C with 25 μl of anti-rabbit IgG beads. The next day, the beads were washed three times with TrueBlot lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitates were released from the beads by 5 min of boiling in Laemmli buffer prior to separation by SDS-PAGE. Immunoblotting was performed with anti-CCTα or anti-p42/44 primary antibody as described above. A rabbit IgG TrueBlot at 1:1000 dilution was used as a secondary antibody. Construction of Putative CCTα Docking Domain Mutants—The cDNA encoding the open reading frame (∼1100 bp) of rat CCTα was generated by PCR as described previously and ligated into a pCMV5 expression vector (pCMV5-CCTα) (2Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). C-terminally histidine-tagged full-length CCTα (pCMV5-CCTα-His) was generated by PCR using pCMV5-CCTα as a template as we described previously (2Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). An N-terminally truncated CCTα mutant termed CCTN40, which lacks the first 40 amino acid residues, was generated as follows. pCMV5-CCTα was used as a template for PCR using the sense primer 5′-aga tct atg tta cgg cag cca gct cc-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-tct aga tta gtc ctc ttc atc ctc gct g-3′ in a two-step PCR amplification using Advantage cDNA polymerase under the following reaction conditions: 94 °C for 2 min and 18 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 3 min. An ∼1000-bp fragment was purified using the Geneclean II kit and cloned into pCR4-TOPO, and plasmid minipreparations were verified by DNA sequencing. A CCTα variant termed CCTm158, in which 158LAEHR was mutated to 158ASEHA, was generated using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-cgc ccg agt tcg cga gcg agc acg cga ttg att tcg-3′ (sense) and 5′-cga aat caa tcg cgt gct cgc tcg cga act cgg gcg-3′ (antisense), with pCMV5-CCTα plasmid DNA used as a template (2Zhou J.

The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s and 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 6 min. The CCTα internal deletion mutant termed CCT289, which lacks the membrane-binding domain (residues 240–290), has been described previously (2Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). A related CCTα variant termed CCTm289, in which 13KRRK was mutated to 13KWWK, was generated by site-directed mutagenesis with oligonucleotides 5′-gct aaa gtc aat tca agg aag tgg tgg aaa gag gta cct ggc cct-3′ (sense) and 5′-agg gcc agg tac ctc ttt cca cca ctt cct tga att gac ttt agc-3′ (antisense) using pCMV5-CCT289 as a template. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s and 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 5 min. A third CCTα internal deletion mutant termed CCTd21, which lacks residues 231–251, was constructed following the same PCR protocol used for generation of full-length CCTα with pCMV5-CCTα as a template and sense primer 5′-gga gct caa agt gaa aga tgt gga gg-3′ and antisense primer 5′-tcc ccg ggt cta gat tag tcc tct tca tcc tcg c-3′, resulting in a 351-bp PCR product that was cloned into pCR4-TOPO for transformation into E. coli TOP10 competent cells. Plasmids were double-digested with SacI and XbaI, and pCMV5-CCTα was digested with BglII and SacI. The 351- and 687-bp fragments were purified and ligated into pCMV5 (previously digested with BglII and XbaI) using T4 ligase overnight at 15 °C and then transferred into TOP10 competent cells. The 1038-bp insert was directionally cloned into pCMV5 as confirmed by partial DNA sequencing and restriction enzyme digestion. A series of C-terminally truncated CCTα mutants were generated as follows. pCMV5-CCTα was used as a template for PCR using sense primer 5′-gga tcc ata tgg atg cac aga gtt cag c-3′ and antisense primers 5′-acg cgt tta tga ctt ttc ctc cac atc-3′ for CCT260, 5′-acg cgt tta ctc ctc cca ctt ctg gat gag-3′ for CCT280, 5′-acg cgt tta aat gaa ctc tcg gga ctt c-3′for CCT286, and 5′-acg cgt tta ctt cag cgc tcc ttc tgg acc-3′ for CCT300. The PCR products were purified using the Geneclean II kit and cloned into pCR4-TOPO, and plasmid minipreparations were verified by DNA sequencing. These CCT mutants were truncated at the indicated amino acid. Construction of CCTα Phosphorylation Mutants—A truncated mutant termed CCTα328, which lacks the distal portion of the phosphorylation domain of CCTα (residues 329–367), was generated as follows. pCMV5-CCTα was used as a template for PCR using sense primer 5′-aga tct atg gat gca cag agt tca g-3′ and antisense primer 5′-tct aga tta gcg ctc atg agt agg gct gc-3′ to generate an ∼990-bp fragment. The PCR product was purified using the Geneclean II kit and cloned into pCR4-TOPO, and plasmid minipreparations were verified by DNA sequencing. This clone was then digested with BgIII and XbaI, purified using the Geneclean II kit, and ligated into a pCMV5 expression vector previously digested with the same restriction enzymes. A phosphorylation variant termed CCTα328SA, which is similar to CCTα328 but with Ser321-Ser322-Ser323 mutated to Ala321-Ala322-Ala323, was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. The oligonucleotides used were 5′-ccc aag cag agt ccc gca gca gca cct act cat gag cgc-3′ and 5′-gcg ctc atg agt agg tgc tgc tgc ggg act ctg ctt ggg-3′, with CCTα328 plasmid DNA used as a template. The PCR conditions were as follows: 95 °C for 30 s and 18 cycles at 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 60 s, and 68 °C for 6 min. Another truncated phosphorylation variant termed CCTα328SAquad, in which Ser315-Ser321-Ser322-Ser323 was mutated to Ala315-Ala321-Ala322-Ala323, was generated similarly using oligonucleotides 5′-gat gct gca ggc cat cgc tcc caa gca gag tcc-3′ and 5′-gga ctc tgc ttg gga gcg atg gcc tgc agc atc-3′, with CCTα328SA plasmid DNA used as a template. The PCR conditions were identical to those used for construction of CCTα328SA. A full-length mutant termed CCTα315, in which Ala was substituted only at Ser315, was constructed using oligonucleotides 5′-ccc aag cag agt ccc gca gca gca cct act cat gag cgc-3′ and 5′-gcg ctc atg agt agg tgc tgc tgc ggg act ctg ctt ggg-3′, with pCMV5-CCTα plasmid DNA used as a template (2Zhou J. Ryan A.J. Medh J. Mallampalli R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 37032-37040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The PCR conditions were identical to those used for construction of CCTα328SAquad. A second full-length CCTα phosphorylation mutant termed CCTαquad, in which Ser315-Ser321-Ser322-Ser323 was changed to Ala315-Ala321-Ala322-Ala323, was generated as follows. pCMV5-CCTα328SAquad and pCMV5-CCTα were digested with BglII/XbaI, generating ∼1- and ∼1.1-kb inserts, respectively. These fragments were purified and digested with BspHI. An ∼970-bp fragment from CCTα328SAquad and an ∼200-bp fragment from CCTα were purified and ligated into pCMV5 predigested with BglII/XbaI by T4 ligase and transferred into TOP10 cells. All CCTα constructs mentioned above were verified by DNA sequencing. Preparation of p38-GST-agarose—p38-GST-agarose was prepared from N-terminally GST-tagged full-length recombinant p38 protein and GST-agarose. Proteins (5 μg of p38-GST and 25 μl of GST-agarose beads) were incubated in binding buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 5 mm imidazole (pH 7.5) at 4 °C for 2 h according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The beads were subsequently washed three times with 20 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, and 50 mm imidazole (pH 7.5) and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline containing 50% glycerol and 0.05% sodium azide. Immunoblotting of preparations using anti-p38 antibody confirmed that the kinase was effectively conjugated to GST-agarose. In Vitro CCTα Transcription and Translation and ERK Pull-down Assays—For in vitro synthesis of CCTα mutants, cDNA constructs cloned into pCR4-TOPO4 (2 μg/reaction) were added directly to the rabbit reticulocyte lysate (TnT coupled reticulocyte lysate system) and incubated with T7 RNA polymerase in a 50-μl reaction containing [35S]methionine (20 μCi/reaction) for 90 min at 30 °C following the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots (10 μl) of in vitro translation products were boiled for 5 min in 2× Laemmli loading buffer and stored at -80 °C; alternatively, aliquots (40 μl) were directly rotated with ERK-GST-agarose, p38-GST-agarose, or GST-agarose alone at 4 °C overnight. After 18 h, the agarose beads were washed three times with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and proteins were eluted from the beads after resuspension in 4× Laemmli buffer and boiling for 5 min. Proteins eluted from GST and products of in vitro translation (10-μl aliquots) were resolved by SDS-PAGE; the gels were dried; and autoradiography was performed. Transfection Analysis—For expression of CCTα plasmids, the MEK1 plasmid, or the dominant-negative p42 kinase plasmid, cells were transfected for 4 h (4 μg/60-mm dish) with test plasmids. Immediately after transfections, cells were transferred to serum-free medium containing agonists for various times before pulsing the cells with [methyl-3H]choline chloride as described above for PtdCho determination. CCTα Phosphorylation in Vivo and in Vitro—Purified His-tagged CCTα, CCTα315, and CCTαquad were dephosphorylated using alkaline phosphatase (5 units) in 50 mm Tris-HCl and 100 μm EDTA (pH 8.5) (16Wieprecht M. Wieder T. Geilen C.C. Orfanos C.E. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 221-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). After 1 h of incubation at 30 °C, CCTα proteins were purified again using the B-PER 6xHis spin kit. In vitro phosphorylation was catalyzed using 10 μg of p42 (or p44) kinase in MAPK buffer (25 mm MOPS, 6 mm MgCl2, 25 mm β-glycerol phosphate, 100 μm ATP, and 2 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of phosphatase inhibitor mixture"
https://openalex.org/W2125136690,"Recently we described the interaction of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)1 integrase (IN) with a cellular protein, lens epithelium-derived growth factor/transcription co-activator p75 (LEDGF/p75). We now present the study of the diffusion behavior of the three independent domains of IN and LEDGF/p75 using fluorescence correlation microscopy (FCM). We show that diffusion in the cell of the different enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins is described by two components with different fractions and that the average parameters in the nucleus are comparable with those in the cytoplasm. In addition, we demonstrate that specific interaction between EGFP-fused HIV-1 IN and LEDGF/p75 results in a shift in diffusion coefficient (D). The opposite shift was observed in an IN-deletion mutant that does not exhibit LEDGF/p75 binding or in a LEDGF/p75 knock-down experiment using siRNA. We thus demonstrate that protein-protein interactions can be studied in living cells, using single-color FCM (scFCM)."
https://openalex.org/W1967413988,"Campylobacter jejuni produces multiple glycoproteins whose glycans contain 4-amino 6-deoxy sugars or their derivatives, such as diacetamidobacillosamine or pseudaminic acid. Because the proteoglycans contribute to bacterial virulence and their constitutive sugars are not commonly found in humans, inhibitors developed against the enzymes that are responsible for their biosynthesis could be novel therapeutic targets to fight this important food-borne pathogen. The biosynthesis of diacetamidobacillosamine is anticipated to involve a sugar nucleotide C6 dehydratase, a C4 aminotransferase and an acetyltransferase. We have identified a set of genes (cj1293, cj1294, and cj1298) potentially encoding one of each enzymatic activity, and demonstrated earlier that Cj1293 was a UDP-GlcNAc-specific C6 dehydratase. Others have shown that Cj1293 was involved in protein glycosylation. Here, we report on our investigation of the potential activity of Cj1294 as a sugar nucleotide C4 aminotransferase. Our biochemical characterization of overexpressed and purified protein shows that Cj1294 is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferase specific for UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc that uses preferentially glutamic acid as an amino donor. A detailed physicokinetic study of Cj1294 was performed to determine the Km of 1.28 ± 0.2 mm and kcat of 11.5 ± 1.3 min-1. Also, two residues essential for protein stability and activity, Arg228 and Lys181, respectively, were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. Finally, we demonstrated by NMR analysis of purified reaction product that Cj1294 produces UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-GalNAc. These results indicate that Cj1294 is involved in the biosynthesis of diacetamidofucosamine, a C4 epimer of diacetamidobacillosamine not yet described in C. jejuni proteoglycans, suggesting that the composition of C. jejuni proteoglycans is more variable than anticipated.

The role for such glycosylation is not fully understood although it has been suggested that glycosylation might be essential for secretion/assembly of flagella (15Josenhans C. Vossebein L. Friedrich S. Suerbaum S. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2002; 210: 165-172Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).In Campylobacter jejuni, protein glycosylation includes, but is far from being limited to, glycosylation of the flagellins. In fact, over 30 different proteins have been shown to be glycosylated (20Szymanski C.M. Yao R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Although most of these glycoproteins have unknown specific function, a potential global role of their glycosylation for bacterial virulence was demonstrated, since lack of glycosylation affected interactions with host cells (21Szymanski C.M. Burr D.H. Guerry P. Infect. Immun. 2002; 70: 2242-2244Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). It also resulted in lower antigenicity, which might be beneficial for evasion of host immune defenses.Whereas flagellin glycans comprise mostly O-linked pseudaminic acid or its derivatives (18Thibault P.

To date, the biosynthesis pathways for DAB and pseudaminic acid have not been demonstrated at the biochemical level. However, elucidating these pathways would not only be of fundamental interest, but would also allow for an assessment of the role of protein glycosylation on bacterial virulence by offering the possibility to inhibit specifically each step of the pathway and assess the resulting effect on bacterial virulence.Here, we report our investigation of the potential role of the putative aminotransferase Cj1294 in DAB biosynthesis. Using pure, overexpressed enzyme, we demonstrate that Cj1294 is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent aminotransferase specific for UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc. We also demonstrate by NMR analysis of purified reaction product that Cj1294 is involved in the biosynthesis of a sugar distinct from DAB since Cj1294 produces UDP-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-GalNAc. These results contribute to the fundamental understanding of the biosynthesis of sugars dedicated to protein glycosylation in C. jejuni and suggest that additional sugars, other than DAB or pseudaminic acid, might be part of the C. jejuni proteoglycans.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of cj1294 —cj1294 was PCR-amplified from chromosomal DNA from C. jejuni subspecies doylei ATCC 49349 (kindly provided by Dr. J. Odumeru, University of Guelph, Canada) using primers designed based on genomic information available for strain ATCC 700819. The primers used were AGGGTACATCTCCATGCTTACTTATTCTCATCA and GCGTCGGATCCTTATCCACAATATCCCTTTTT. Cloning into the pET expression vector was performed by standard procedures using BamHI and AflIII sites. The resulting construct was sequenced using primer: CGATGATGCAAGCCATGC and the T7 promoter primer at the DNA sequencing facility of the Robarts Institute (London, Ontario).

The primers used were CTTTTCACCCTGTTGCGCCTATCACTACTTTTG and CAAAAGTAGTGATAGGCGCAACAGGGTGAAAAG to generate the K181R mutant, and CTTGGCTATAATTACGCGTTAAGTGATGTTGC and GCAACATCACTTAACGCGTAATTATAGCCAAG to generate the R228A mutant.Protein Expression and Purification—Protein expression was performed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLys, using Luria Bertani broth supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin and 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol at 25 °C. After 3 h of induction with 0.15 mm isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside, the cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 18,500 × g for 20 min, and the pellets were stored at -20 °C until needed. Protein purification was performed by nickel chelation as described previously (24Creuzenet C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) except that the Tris buffer was replaced by Hepes 20 mm, pH 7.5. At the end of the purification, PLP was added to the pooled pure fractions to a final concentration of 0.012 mm, incubated for 1 h at 37 °C, and dialysis was performed overnight in Hepes 100 mm pH 7.5. The protein was concentrated using polyethylene glycol 8000 as needed. For the R228A mutant, dialysis was performed in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5 containing 50 mm NaCl and an extra step of anion exchange chromatography was performed using a MonoQ HR 5/5 (1 ml) column (Amersham Biosciences, 17-0546-01) and a linear gradient of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1 m NaCl in 10 column volumes. The purified protein was dialyzed in Hepes 100 mm, pH 7.5 for further analysis. Western blotting was performed using a commercial mouse anti-histidine tag primary antibody (Amersham Biosciences) and a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Alexa Fluor 680 secondary antibody using standard procedures. Detection was achieved by scanning with a Li-Cor Odyssey Infrared Imaging System. Expression and purification of Cj1293 and its Helicobacter pylori homologue FlaA1, were performed as reported before (24Creuzenet C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol.

Reactions were incubated for 5 h at 37 °C. The reaction products were analyzed by capillary electrophoresis (CE) as described previously (25Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J.

This ensured that the measured parameters would only reflect intrinsic properties of Cj1294. The concentration in 4-keto intermediate in the filtrate was determined by CE using the percentage of conversion of the original UDP-GlcNAc substrate. To determine the optimum temperature and pH, the filtrate was incubated with Cj1294 at the appropriate temperature (4–65 °C) or pH (4.5–10.5). For the pH study, sodium acetate 100 mm was used for pH 4.5–6.5 and Bis-Tris-propane 100 mm was used for pH 6.5–10.5. For determination of Km, Vmax and turn over parameters, 11 reactions with varying concentrations of 4-keto intermediate were set up in triplicates and incubated for 1 h at 42 °C, which ensured less than 10% substrate conversion over the whole range of substrate concentrations tested. The data are the average of three independent experiments.Purification of the Amination Product—The purification of the amination product was performed by anion exchange using a High Q Econopac 1-ml column (Bio-Rad) (27Miller W.L.

Chem. 2004; 279: 37551-37558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar) and a linear gradient of 20 column volumes of triethylammonium bicarbonate pH 8.5 (50 mm to 1 m) at 1 ml/min. Fractions containing the reaction product were pooled and lyophilized twice with resuspension in water between both lyophilization steps. Fractions were resuspended in water for CE and NMR analysis.Determination of the Structure of the Amino Product by NMR—All NMR data were collected at 25 °C on a Varian INOVA 600 MHz spectrometer equipped with a pulsed-field gradient triple resonance probe. The sample was dissolved in D2O at a final concentration of 0.3 mm. Its final pH was 8.5. 1H chemical shifts were externally referenced to the methyl group of 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-5-sulfonate sodium salt (0.0 ppm at 25 °C). The 13C reference was calculated as described (28Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1994; 4: 171-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (1896) Google Scholar). One dimensional 1H and two-dimensional TOCSY, NOESY, HSQC, and HMBC spectra were measured by using Varian standard pulse sequences. The NMR data were processed and analyzed with the VNMR software.Reactivity of the Purified Cj1294 Reaction Product with 2,4,6-Trinitrobenzensulfonic Acid (TNBS)—The purified Cj1294 reaction product (0.25 nmol) was incubated for 1 h at 50 °C with 5 nmol of TNBS (Sigma) in 100 mm Hepes pH 7.5 (total reaction volume, 20 μl). Similar reactions were carried out on UDP-GlcNAc as a negative control. Samples were analyzed directly by CE after incubation.Determination of the Oligomerization Status by Gel Filtration Chromatography—Gel filtration chromatography was performed by FPLC in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer pH 7.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, using a Tricorn High Performance Superose 12 (10/300 GL) column (Amersham Biosciences). The molecular mass standards were: cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), alcohol dehydrogenase (150 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa) (Sigma).Mass Spectrometry Analyses—Mass spectrometry analyses were performed at the Dr. Don Rix Protein Identification Facility of the University of Western Ontario. Pure Cj1294 was subjected to trypsinolysis, and the peptides were analyzed by LC-MS/MS (Q-TOF2) and MALDI-MS. Purified amino product was analyzed on a Micromass Qtof Micro mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-spray source operating in the negative ion mode (40 V, 80 °C).RESULTSProposed Pathway for DAB Biosynthesis—Theoretically, the biosynthesis of DAB necessitates the activity of a C6 dehydratase to form a 4-keto-6-deoxy intermediate starting from a 2-N-acetyl sugar, a C4 aminotransferase from the degT family to add an amino group on the generated reactive 4-ketone, and an N-acetyltransferase to acetylate the newly incorporated amino group. The genome of C. jejuni contains two sets of genes potentially able to encode the necessary activities, but in the absence of biochemical data, it is not clear if these two sets of genes are functionally redundant or not. One set (cj1120c, cj1121c, and cj1123c) is part of the general protein glycosylation (pgl) cluster (20Szymanski C.M. Yao R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 32: 1022-1030Crossref PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar) that can sustain production of N-glycosylated proteins harboring 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyhexoses in E. coli (29Wacker M. Linton D. Hitchen P.G. Nita-Lazar M. Haslam S.M. North S.J. Panico M. Morris H.R. Dell A. Wren B.W. Aebi M. Science. 2002; 298: 1790-1793Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar). The other set (cj1293, cj1294, and cj1298, Fig. 1), which is the focus of this report, includes the UDP-GlcNAc-specific C6 dehydratase Cj1293, that produces a 4-keto-6-deoxy intermediate suitable for further transamination (24Creuzenet C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). It was shown that disruption of cj1293 abrogated glycosylation of flagellins by pseudaminic acid (30Goon S. Kelly J.F. Logan S.M. Ewing C.P. Guerry P. Mol. Microbiol. 2003; 50: 659-671Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Also, these genes are in close proximity to the flagellin genes and to a gene encoding a neuraminic acid synthase homologue that was recently proven to be essential for the production of flagella (18Thibault P. Logan S.M. Kelly J.F. Brisson J.R. Ewing C.P. Trust T.J. Guerry P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 34862-34870Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (289) Google Scholar, 31Linton D. Karlyshev A.V. Hitchen P.G. Morris H.R. Dell A. Gregson N.A. Wren B.W. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 35: 1120-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). This supports the idea of a potential role of cj1293, cj1294, and cj1298 in the biosynthesis of the DAB precursor used to form pseudaminic acid, which is subsequently used for flagellin glycosylation. Among all the enzymes potentially involved, Cj1293 is the only one that has been characterized at the biochemical level (24Creuzenet C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and based on its UDP-GlcNAc dehydratase activity, we propose the DAB biosynthesis pathway highlighted in Fig. 2, whereby UDP-GlcNAc would be the initial precursor. We decided to pursue the investigation of the role of the cj1293-cj1298 set of genes in DAB biosynthesis by determining the biochemical activity of the putative aminotransferase Cj1294.Fig. 2Proposed biosynthetic pathway for DAB biosynthesis. Two sets of genes (cj1293, cj1294, and cj1298 on one hand, and cj1120c, cj1121c, and cj1123c on the other hand) with relatively high levels of similarity and identity, as indicated in percentages, potentially encode for the dehydratase, aminotransferase and acetyltransferase activities necessary for DAB biosynthesis. Based on the demonstrated biochemical activity of Cj1293, we propose that UDP-GlcNAc is the precursor for DAB biosynthesis.

DNA sequencing revealed that the sequences of Cj1294 from both strains were 98.7% identical at the protein level. Identities included residues shown to be essential for cofactor binding in related enzymes, such as Asp152, Ser176, and Lys181, and residues essential for dimerization such as Asn226 and Arg228 (33Eads J.C. Beeby M. Scapin G. Yu T.W. Floss H.G. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9840-9849Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).The Cj1294 protein (wild-type and K181R mutant, see rationale for mutant below) could be readily overexpressed in a soluble form and purified to homogeneity in a single step of metal chelation (Fig. 3, panel A for wild-type). The identity of the proteins was confirmed by Western blotting with an anti-histidine tag monoclonal antibody (Fig. 3, panel B for wild-type) as well as by sequencing by mass spectrometry. Sixteen peptides covering 49% of the protein were sequenced (data not shown). The R228A mutant (see rationale below) was mostly expressed in an insoluble form. Purification of the soluble fraction of R228A by metal chelation was inefficient because of poor binding to the resin. Further attempts at purifying it by anion-exchange chromatography were unsuccessful because of protein precipitation. This indicates that Arg228 is essential for protein folding and stability but prevented further characterization.Fig. 3SDS-PAGE analysis of purified Cj1294. Panel A, silver staining.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) or its Helicobacter pylori homologue FlaA1 (25Creuzenet C. Schur M.J. Li J. Wakarchuk W.W. Lam J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 34873-34880Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), in the presence of UDP-GlcNAc as the substrate for the dehydratase, and in the presence of glutamate as an amino donor for the transaminase (Fig. 4). Cj1293 and FlaA1 convert UDP-GlcNAc (peak A) into the UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc intermediate of interest (peak B) and further reduce it into peak C (Fig. 4, lines a and c). In the presence of Cj1294, and in the presence of the appropriate amino donor (glutamate preferentially, see below), the 4-keto intermediate is used up to generate peak D, potentially corresponding to the amination reaction product (Fig. 4, lines d-h). No reaction was observed in the absence of dehydratase, indicating that UDP-GlcNAc is not a substrate for Cj1294 (Fig. 4, line b). The transamination reaction drives the conversion of UDP-GlcNAc by FlaA1/Cj1293 almost to completion so that overall, at equilibrium, 80% of the original substrate had been converted into amino product, and only 11% of UDP-GlcNAc, 5% of peak C and 4% of the 4-keto intermediate were left under the conditions tested (Fig. 4, line h). The same results were obtained whether Cj1293 or FlaA1 was used as the original dehydratase, and the final amination reaction products obtained using either dehydratase to form the 4-keto intermediate co-eluted in a single sharp peak by CE when co-injected as a mix (data not shown). This indicates that the amination reaction products are identical notwithstanding which dehydratase is used to generate the 4-keto intermediate. This is consistent with the demonstrated identical biochemical activities of the dehydratases (24Creuzenet C. FEBS Lett. 2004; 559: 136-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 25Creuzenet C.

FlaA1 being more stable than Cj1293, all subsequent experiments were performed with FlaA1.Fig. 4Capillary electrophoresis analysis of the aminotransferase activity of Cj1294 on UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc. A complete reaction typically contains UDP-GlcNAc, the dehydratase, Cj1294, glutamate, and PLP. Traces a-h show the effect of specific modifications (indicated on the figure) to this reaction mixture. Incubation of UDP-GlcNAc (peak A) with the dehydratase (shown here using FlaA1) generates UDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-GlcNAc (peak B, 4-keto intermediate) and its reduced derivative (peak C). Upon addition of Cj1294 and glutamate, the 4-keto intermediate is modified into peak D. The yield of peak D is considerably improved if Cj1294 is preincubated with PLP at the end of its purification, or if PLP is added directly to the transamination reaction.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The production of the putative amino product (peak D) by Cj1294 was directly dependent on the amount of 4-keto intermediate generated, as controlled by the amount of dehydratase present in the coupled assay (Fig. 5, panel A).

https://openalex.org/W2146664412,"Adipocytes are known to secrete a number of adipokines, but many adipocyte secretions and their functional importance remain to be characterized. This work shows that human white adipocytes and 3T3-F442A-derived adipocytes produce adrenomedullin (AM) and that AM acts in an autocrine/paracrine way on lipid metabolism by extracellular inactivation of isoproterenol, a beta-adrenergic agonist. AM is described as a counter-regulatory factor involved in the control of cardiovascular homeostasis. This peptide is believed to protect the heart from several complications implicated in obesity-linked cardiomorbidity, such as arterial hypertension, cardiac fibrosis, and decreased sinusal variability. The exact source of circulating AM remains a matter of debate, although endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells seem to be important sites of production. We show that human adipose cells and 3T3-F442A-derived adipocytes express AM receptors and secrete AM. The function of this feature was investigated in 3T3-F442A cell line at the level of lipolysis regulation. AM inhibited beta-adrenergic-stimulated lipolysis by a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent mechanism, inducing a significant decrease in pD2 value for isoproterenol (8.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 9.8 +/- 0.1, P<0.001). This effect is cGMP-independent since it occurred in the presence of the NO-sensitive guanylate cyclase inhibitor ODQ. It is apparently mediated by a novel extracellular mechanism. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) demonstrated that AM-produced NO oxidized isoproterenol to generate its aminochrome, namely isoprenochrome. Isoprenochrome amounts were increased 3.62 +/- 1.13-fold in cell culture media (P<0.05). We describe for the first time that AM down-regulates lipolysis in adipocytes through the chemical modification of a beta-agonist."
https://openalex.org/W2169390965,"The role of hepatic nitric oxide (NO) in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy (PH) was studied in animals carrying a nitric oxide synthase-2 transgene under the control of the phospho(enol)pyruvate carboxykinase promoter. These mice expressed NOS-2 in liver cells under fasting conditions. Liver mass recovery and molecular parameters related to cell proliferation were determined after PH. Preexisting hepatic NO synthesis, as well as NO delivery by NO-donors, impaired early signaling (for example, attenuated NF-kappaB activation and TNF-alpha and IL-6 release). The regenerative process was also impaired as a result of an insufficient proliferative response, but mouse survival after surgery was not compromised. However, NO exerted a protective role against apoptosis in transgenic hepatectomized mice. Local production of NO in liver cells, achieved by hydrodynamic-based transfection with a NOS-2-encoding plasmid, also resulted in delayed liver recovery after PH and also protected against Fas-mediated apoptosis. These data show that sustained presence of NO after PH exerts a dual role: attenuating liver regeneration while efficiently protecting against liver apoptosis."

The correlations between phenotypes and variation generated by DNA shuffling paralleled natural variation observed between orthologs of Pto from Lycopersicon spp. The outcome of challenges by potential pathogens on a plant is determined by multiple molecular interactions between host and pathogen. In bacterial diseases, some of these interactions involve effector proteins that are secreted directly into the host cell via the type III secretion system (1Alfano J.R. Collmer A. Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 2004; 42: 385-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). When plants evolve to recognize an effector protein, a compatible interaction becomes incompatible, and the effector protein acquires an avirulence phenotype. Disease resistance genes have now been isolated from a wide variety of plants to diverse pathogens (2Hammond-Kosack K.E. Parker J.E. Curr. Opin. Biotechnol. 2003; 13: 177-193Crossref Scopus (471) Google Scholar). The most abundant class of resistance genes encodes for proteins with nucleotide binding site and leucine-rich repeat domains (3Ellis J. Dodds P. Pryor T. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 2000; 3: 278-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). It is predicted that resistance proteins act in macromolecular complexes and that genes encoding different components can vary genetically (4Leister R.T. Katagiri F. Plant J. 2000; 22: 345-354Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Martin G.B. Bogdanove A.J. Sessa G. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 23-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Usually, variation occurs in nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat encoding genes, the most common class of resistance genes. In some cases, however, other types of genes may determine the natural variation of resistance. This is the case of resistance in tomato to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato, where the observed intraspecific variation in specificity is determined by differences in the Pto gene that encodes a kinase, rather than in Prf that encodes a nucleotide binding site-leucine-rich repeat protein (6Martin G.B.

EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 16Sessa G. Martin G.B. Microbes Infect. 2000; 2: 1591-1597Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 17Wu A.J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1-13Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The activated Pto protein then induces a resistance response in a Prf-dependent manner, and pathogen growth is inhibited. Pto belongs to a small multigene family that spans ∼65 kb (GenBank™ AF220602 and AF220603). 2D. Lavelle and R. Michelmore, unpublished results. The five tandem gene family members (paralogs) share 78–91% nucleotide identity with Pto (Supplementary Table S1). However, only Pto interacts with AvrPto in yeast and induces an HR in an AvrPto-dependent manner in planta (18Chang J.H. Tai Y-S. Bernal A.J. Lavelle D.T. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A Pto paralog, LescPth5, in the susceptible haplotype in Lycopersicon esculentum recognizes AvrPto in planta but does not confer complete resistance to bacteria expressing AvrPto. Fen, a paralog in the resistant haplotype, encodes sensitivity to the organophosphate insecticide Fenthion (19Martin G.B. Frary A. Wu T.Y. Brommonschenkel S. Chungwongse J. Earle E.D. Tanksley S.D. Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 1543-1552PubMed Google Scholar). Several paralogs can be activated by gain-of-function substitutions (18Chang J.H. Tai Y-S. Bernal A.J. Lavelle D.T. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). All phenotypes of Pto, Fen, and gain-of-function variants are Prf-dependent (18Chang J.H.

Carland F. Oldroyd G. Mehta A. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B. Euphytica. 1994; 79: 195-200Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar). Several functional domains of Pto have been characterized. Ethyl methane sulfonate-induced mutagenesis identified three residues required for function in planta (10Scofield S.R. Tobias C.M. Rathjen J.P. Chang J.H. Lavelle D.T. Michelmore R.W. Staskawicz B.J.

Plant Cell. 1994; 6: 511-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Two phosphorylation sites are required for binding AvrPto in yeast and recognition in planta, respectively (22Sessa G. D'Ascenzo M. Martin G.B. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2257-2269Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Swaps between Pto and Fen together with site-directed mutagenesis identified a single amino acid (Thr204) in kinase subdomain VIII responsible for AvrPto binding specificity (10Scofield S.R.

However, whereas these Fen-Pto hybrids did bind AvrPto in the yeast two-hybrid assay, wild type (Pto) levels of binding were not observed, indicating that other regions in the protein also participate in binding. Recently, a patch of residues on the surface of the protein was identified as a negative regulator for downstream signaling using three-dimensional structure prediction of sites located in the vicinity of the p + 1 loop of Pto (17Wu A.J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1-13Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Residues critical for AvrPto and AvrPtoB recognition were also identified in a surface area that partially overlapped with the patch mediating negative regulation. DNA shuffling is a PCR-based combinatorial method for generating large numbers of variant progeny molecules from a set of sequence-related template molecules in vitro (24Stemmer W.P.C. Nature. 1994; 370: 389-391Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Multiple versions of a gene (alleles, orthologs, or paralogs) from the same or different species are fragmented into small pieces (∼50–200 bp), allowed to reanneal, and reconstituted into chimeric genes from the different templates. DNA shuffling of naturally occurring genes or in vitro generated mutants has been used on a wide spectrum of proteins to enhance their performance rather than to dissect protein function (25Stemmer W.P.C. J. Mol. Catalysis B: Enzymatic. 2002; 19-20: 3-12Crossref Scopus (21) Google Scholar). DNA shuffling has been used together with domain swaps in the tomato Cf4 and Cf9 genes, which confer resistance to Cladosporium fulvum, to identify regions responsible for recognition specificity (26Wulff B.B.H. Thomas C.M. Smoker M. Grant M. Jones J.D.G. Plant Cell. 2001; 13: 255-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). These Cf genes are more than 91% identical at the amino acid level. Consequently, direct visual comparisons between chimeras of these two templates were informative for the identification of regions defining specificity. However, resolution to a single amino acid level was not achieved with the analysis of chimeras obtained by DNA shuffling. Analysis of more divergent, multiple templates, such as the Pto gene family described in this paper, required statistical approaches to identify specificity determinants, since functional and nonfunctional chimeras not only differ in the specificity determinants but also in other regions. Additionally, constitutively active molecules were obtained by DNA shuffling of Cf9 homologs (27Wulff B.B. Kruijt M. Collins P.L. Thomas C.M. Ludwig A.A. De Wit P.J. Jones J.D. Plant J. 2004; 40: 942-956Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 28Xiang C. Han P. Lutziger I. Wang K. Oliver D. Plant. Mol. Biol. 1999; 40: 711-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). In this case, regions responsible for the phenotype could not be identified, probably due to the low number of chimeras. In this paper, we describe the use of DNA shuffling to dissect functional regions and individual amino acids of Pto that are important for the recognition of the cognate avirulence proteins and for signaling downstream. The importance of two regions previously identified by domain swaps was confirmed. Two regions identified by shuffling confirm the parallel site-directed analysis reported by Wu et al. (17Wu A.J. Andriotis V.M.E. Durrant M.C. Rathjen J.P. Plant Cell. 2004; 16: 1-13Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). In addition, three regions important for recognition of the Avr proteins and signaling downstream were characterized that had not been identified previously. The importance of these regions was validated by site-directed mutagenesis. In two of the regions involved in Avr recognition, the amino acids required for interaction with AvrPto and AvrPtoB and homologs are similar but not identical. Furthermore, the phenotypes of multiple chimeras have implications for the role of conformational changes in the activation of Pto for downstream signaling. In addition, regions of Pto that can tolerate variation without abrogating function were also identified. Shuffling of Pto and Homologs—The paralogs LpimPto, LpimFen, LpimPth2, LpimPth3, and LpimPth4 from the resistant haplotype (Supplementary Table S1 and GenBank™ AF220602) were amplified from pCR Blunt (Invitrogen) clones derived from L. esculentum cv. Rio Grande 76R (18Chang J.H. Tai Y-S. Bernal A.J. Lavelle D.T. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) using PCR primers with the attB recombination sites for the Gateway BP reaction (Supplemental Table S3) and cloned into the Gateway pDONR207 vector (Invitrogen). They were then amplified by PCR using Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and vector-specific oligonucleotides (Supplemental Table S3). These PCR products were purified, and 2–5 μg of DNA were digested with 0.01 units of DNase I/μl (Sigma) in 50 μl of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2 for 20 min at room temperature. Products were separated by electrophoresis; DNA fragments of 50–200 bp were excised, purified, and resuspended in 30 μl of 1× PCR buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) to a final concentration of 20–30 ng/μl. Five μl of each template treated with DNase were mixed together and amplified without primers using 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) per 100-μl reaction. A PCR program of 94 °C for 60 s, 94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s (40 cycles), and 72 °C for 5 min was used. The PCR products were diluted and amplified for 20 additional cycles (94 °C for 30 s, 50 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s) following the addition of primers Q43 and Q44, which contain the attB recombination sites for the BP reaction in the Gateway system (Supplemental Table S3). A single product of the correct size (∼1 kb) was obtained. Plasmids and Cloning Procedures—Most cloning procedures utilized the Gateway cloning technology (Invitrogen). The yeast two-hybrid vectors pAS2.1 and pACT2 (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as well as the small binary vector for plant transformation pCB302-3 (20Salmeron J. Rommens C. Barker S. Carland F. Oldroyd G. Mehta A. Dahlbeck D. Staskawicz B. Euphytica. 1994; 79: 195-200Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) were adapted as destination vectors using the protocol from Invitrogen. The resulting vectors had the Gateway attR cassette in the reading frame B and were designated pAS2.1GB, pACT2GB, and pCB302-3GB. The gene clones in pCB302-3GB were then under the control of the constitutive 35S promoter. The shuffled library was obtained by cloning the shuffled PCR products into pDONR207 using the BP clonase (Invitrogen). The resulting sequences were then transferred into pAS2.1GB using LR clonase (Invitrogen). A BP and subsequent LR ligation were used to transfer individual clones from pAS2.1GB to pCB302-3GB using pDONR207 as the intermediate. The shuffled clones selected for yeast and plant phenotyping were sequenced from both strands of pDONR207 using the primers PthF and PthR (Supplemental Table S3). The nonredundant set of clones in yeast and Agrobacterium tumefaciens were resequenced to confirm that they were identical to the corresponding clones in pDONR207. The bacterial genes encoding effector proteins were cloned in pACT2 for yeast two-hybrid analyses. avrPto was amplified from pCR Blunt (Invitrogen) (13Chang J.H. Tobias C.M. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2001; 14: 451-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and cloned into pACT2GB using pDONR207 as intermediate. avrPtoB was amplified from genomic DNA of P. syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000 (avrPtoBPstDC3000) using gene-specific primers for AvrPtoB (12Kim Y.J. Lin N-C. Martin G.B. Cell. 2002; 109: 589-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) (Supplemental Table S3) and a 10:6 mixture of Klentaq (DNA Polymerase Technology, St. Louis, MO) and Pfu (Stratagene) polymerases. The genes were then cloned into pCR2.1 using the TOPO TA cloning kit (Invitrogen), and their sequences were verified. avrPtoBPstDC3000 was then cloned as an NcoI-XhoI fragment into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pACT2. avrPtoBPstT1 was cloned using NcoI-SacI and SacI-XhoI fragments into the NcoI-XhoI sites of pACT2. The avrPtoB homologs virPphAPph, virPphAPgy, and virPphAPsv (from Pseudomonas savastanoi pvs. phaseolicola, glycinea, and savastanoi, respectively) (29Jackson R.W. Athanassopoulos E. Tsiamis G. Mansfield J.W. Sesma A. Arnold D.L. Gibbon M.J. Murillo J. Taylor J.D. Vivian A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10875-10880Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar, 30Jackson R.W.

Plant Pathol. 2002; 3: 205-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) were amplified from clones provided by Dr. John Mansfield (Imperial College at Wye, Ashford, UK) and cloned into pCR2.1. The virPphAPph clone was digested with XhoI, filled-in using T4 DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), and digested with BamHI; the resulting fragment was cloned into pACT2 that had been previously digested with EcoRI, filled in with T4 DNA polymerase, and cut with BamHI. virPphAPgy and virPphAPsv were cloned as EcoRI-BamHI fragments into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of pACT2. The resulting clones were transformed into Y187 for yeast two-hybrid analyses. Site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by overlapping extension PCR (31Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 77: 51-59Google Scholar) using Klentaq and Pfu polymerases and oligonucleotides that introduced the desired mutations (Supplemental Table S3). PCR products were cloned into pDONR207 and sequenced. Clones with the desired sequence were then transferred to pCB302-3GB and pAS2.1GB. Pto and Pth3 variants for co-expression with AvrPtoB in tomato were PCR-amplified using oligonucleotides that introduced an NcoI and XbaI site at the 5′ and 3′ end of the genes, respectively. The PCR products were individually cloned into pCR2.1, and their sequence was verified. The resulting constructs were subcloned into the NcoI-XbaI sites of pSLJ4D4.1, between the CaMV 35S promoter and the octopine synthase terminator (32Jones J.D.G. Shlumukov L. Carland C. English J. Scofield S.R. Bishop G.J. Harrison K. Transgenic Res. 1992; 1: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). The entire expression cassette was then inserted as a HindIII fragment into the HindIII site in the MCS1 of pCB302-3GB that had avrPtoB in the MCS2. Yeast Strains and Yeast Two-hybrid Analysis—Yeast two-hybrid analysis was performed using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 system (Clontech). Yeast strains were grown and transformed using the media and protocols described in the yeast protocols handbook (Clontech). Both strain Y187 (MATα, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ, met–, gal80Δ) and strain Y190 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, lys2-801, ade2-101, trp1-901, leu2-3, 112, gal4Δ, gal80Δ, cyhr2) contain a chromosomal lacZ gene with the upstream regulatory elements replaced with GAL4 binding sites (GAL1UAS-GAL1TATA-lacZ). To screen the library of shuffled molecules, bait protein fusions (GAL4AD:Avr protein) were expressed from plasmid pACT2GB, and prey protein fusions (GAL4 DNA BD:Pto chimeras) were expressed from plasmid pAS2.1GB. The library in pAS2.1GB was transformed into strain Y190 carrying GAL4AD:avrPto as bait. The library screen was performed following manufacturer's instructions (Clontech). Double transformants were selected for growth on SD (–leu, –trp), and positive interactions identified by β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by Clontech. Analysis of individual sequences utilized a yeast mating strategy. Haploid bait colonies of strain Y187 (MAT, α transformed with pACT2GB:AvrPto or pACT2GB:AvrPtoB) were mated with haploid prey colonies of Y190 (MATa, transformed with pAS2.1GB:Pto chimeras) as described by Finley and Brent (33Finley R. Brent R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12980-12984Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Yeast colonies were then transferred to liquid media in 96-well ELISA plates, and their A600 adjusted to 0.2. They were then replicated onto fresh SD (–leu, –trp) plates. Yeast were incubated at either 22 or 28 °C for 24 h, and colony lift β-galactosidase assays were performed (Clontech). The standard Y2H temperature of 28 °C is higher than temperatures reflecting normal in planta conditions. Therefore, assays were conducted at two temperatures: at 28 °C, the standard yeast two-hybrid assay conditions, and 22 °C, reflecting more physiological conditions under which these proteins interact naturally. The lower temperature would also accommodate possible temperature-sensitive molecules generated by the shuffling process. Color intensities were recorded after 6 h of incubation. For the site-directed mutants, diploid yeast colonies were streaked onto SD medium (–leu, –trp) and incubated for 36 h at 28 °C. Colony lift assays were performed as recommended (Clontech). Color intensities were recorded after 6 h of incubation. For Western blot analysis, yeast colonies were grown in SD (–trp) to an A600 of 0.5–0.6. Proteins were extracted by resuspension of the yeast pellet using glass beads and MURB buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 25 mm MES, pH 7.0, 3 m urea, 1% SDS, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.01% bromphenol blue). Proteins were separated in a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and detected using GAL4 DNA-BD monoclonal antibody (Clontech). Agrobacterium-mediated Transient Assays in Planta—Agrobacterium strains C58C1(pCH32) and 1D1249 (35Wroblewski T. Tomczak A. Michelmore R.W.M. Plant Biotechnol. J. 2005; 3: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar) were transformed with variants of pCB302-3 using electroporation. Transient assays of Nicotiana benthamiana were performed as previously described (15Rathjen J.P. Chang J.H. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3232-3240Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), except for the infiltration media composition (10 mm MES, pH 5.6, 10 mm MgCl2, 150 μm acetosyringone). For all procedures, A. tumefaciens C58C1(pCH32) containing pCB302-3 clones was grown in LB containing kanamycin at 50 μg/ml and tetracycline at 5 μg/ml. Wild type N. benthamiana and plants expressing AvrPto under the dexamethasone-inducible promoter (34Aoyama T. Chua N.H. Plant J. 1997; 11: 605-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar) were assayed as described by Chang et al. (18Chang J.H. Tai Y-S. Bernal A.J. Lavelle D.T. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The presence or absence of an HR was scored 2 and 4 days after dexamethasone induction. For transient assays in tomato, colonies of A. tumefaciens strain 1D1249, which does not elicit an HR when infiltrated into leaves of tomato (35Wroblewski T. Tomczak A. Michelmore R.W.M. Plant Biotechnol. J. 2005; 3: 259-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (405) Google Scholar), were grown for 24 h in LB containing 66 μg/ml kanamycin at 250 rpm. Bacteria were washed as for the experiments with N. benthamiana and infiltrated at an A600 of 1.0. The presence or absence of HR was recorded at 2 and 4 days after inoculation. Data Management and Statistical Analysis—An alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences was generated using ClustalW (available on the World Wide Web at clustalw.genome.ad.jp/) and refined manually using GeneDoc (available on the World Wide Web at www.psc.edu/biomed/genedoc/). Duplicated sequences were identified using GeneDoc. A MySQL database was generated to assist in data management and analysis (available on the World Wide Web at michelmorelab. ucdavis.edu/shuffledb/data). This database contains all of the protein and nucleotide sequences of the chimeras as well as the phenotypes associated with them. The protein alignment is displayed with the location of the 11 kinase subdomains; amino acids in the alignment can be color-coded. The origin of each fragment among the templates can be graphically displayed from the Web site. An SQL-based program was generated to analyze the distribution of recombination sites within the protein with user-specified sliding window sizes. Correlations between amino acid and phenotypes were analyzed using SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). For the analysis of yeast two-hybrid interactions with Avr proteins, the alignment was converted into a matrix of binary data as follows: “1” was assigned to each amino acid residue in the shuffled molecules if it matched the residue present in Pto, and “0” was assigned if it did not. For the analysis of the ability to signal downstream, the alignment was converted into binary data as follows: “1” was assigned to each amino acid residue if it matched either Pto, Pth3, or Fen, and “0” was assigned if it did not. These groupings were used, because previous studies (18Chang J.H. Tai Y-S. Bernal A.J. Lavelle D.T. Staskawicz B.J. Michelmore R.W. Mol. Plant-Microbe Interact. 2002; 15: 281-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) had shown that these molecules were capable of inducing an HR (i.e. they were competent to signal downstream). Univariate logistic regression analysis (36Hosmer D.W. Lemeshow S. Applied Logistic Regression. Wiley, New York1989Google Scholar) at each position was carried out for the transformed data. This resulted in a χ2 value that represented the correlation between the variation at each amino acid position and the phenotype (binding in yeast or induction of HR in planta). Significance thresholds for χ2 values were calculated for each test using permutation analysis (37Good P.I. Permutation Tests: A Practical Guide to Resampling Methods for Testing Hypotheses. Springer-Verlag, New York1994Crossref Google Scholar). The phenotypes of the chimeras were randomized against their sequences 500 times, and the analysis was carried out in the same manner as with the actual data for each of the 500 permutations. The highest χ2 value was recorded fo"
