The ability of BRCA1 to transactivate the p21 promoter can be inactivated by mutation of the conserved BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats. To explore the mechanisms of this BRCA1 function, the BRCT repeats were used as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen. A known protein, CtIP, a co-repressor with CtBP, was found. CtIP interacts specifically with the BRCT repeats of BRCA1, bothin vitro and in vivo, and tumor-derived mutations in this region abolished these interactions. The association of BRCA1 with CtIP was also abrogated in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents including UV, γ-irradiation, and adriamycin, a response correlated with BRCA1 phosphorylation. The transactivation of the p21 promoter by BRCA1 was diminished by expression of exogenous CtIP and CtBP. These results suggest that the binding of the BRCT repeats of BRCA1 to CtIP/CtBP is critical in mediating transcriptional regulation of p21 in response to DNA damage.

How BRCA1 inactivation leads to tumor formation remains unclear. Studies of homozygous mutation ofBrca1 in mice showed a phenotype of early embryonic lethality (4Liu C.Y. Flesken-Nikitin A. Li S.

Interestingly, Brca1 −/−mouse embryonic stem cells are hypersensitive to ionizing radiation and hydrogen peroxide, and defective in transcription-coupled repair of oxidative DNA damage (7Gowen L.C. Avrutskaya A.V. Latour A.M. Koller B.H. Leadon S.A. Science. 1998; 281: 1009-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). An extension of development to embryonic day 11–12 was observed in Brca1 −/− mice carrying additional p53 or p21waf/cip1 null mutations (8Hakem R. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Potter J. Mak T.W. Nat.

Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1226-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar). A role for BRCA1 in transcription regulation was provided by observations showing that expression of p21, a known target for p53 transcriptional activation, is increased significantly in Brca1 mutant embryos (8Hakem R. de la Pompa J.L. Elia A. Potter J. Mak T.W. Nat. Genet. 1997; 16: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Consistent with this observation, wild-type, but not mutant BRCA1, was able to transactivate the expression of p21 and inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 into S phase in human cells (10Somasundaram K. Zhang H.B. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H.X. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). Taken together, these results suggested that BRCA1 may have a role in the DNA repair process involving p21 and p53 expression. However, the molecular basis for these observations is largely unknown. The C terminus of BRCA1 contains a transcription activation region (10Somasundaram K. Zhang H.B. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H.X. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S.

Although the general function of the BRCT motif is unclear, several lines of evidence suggest that it may be involved in protein-protein interactions (17Critchlow S.E. Bowater R.P. Jackson S.P. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 588-598Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar, 18Nash R.A. Caldecott K.W. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T.

Apparently, complex formation of BRCA1, CtIP and CtBP plays an important role in the regulation of p21 expression. The pAS-BRCT plasmid was generated by polymerase chain reaction amplification of nucleotides 4898–5592 of BRCA1 using pBSK-BRCA1a (19Chen C.F. Li S. Chen Y. Chen P.L. Sharp Z.D. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32863-32868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar) as the template and the following primers: 5′-CCGGAATTCCGGGGCCGCAGGGAGAAGCCAGAATTGA-3′ and 5′-ATAGGATCCTCAGTAGTGGCTGTGGGGGAT-3′. The 0.7-kilobase polymerase chain reaction product was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pAS2–1 vector (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA). The pGST-BRCT plasmid was constructed by digestion of pAS-BRCT withEcoRI, Klenow fill-in, and ligation of BamHI linkers (New England Biolab, Beverly, MA). The construct was then digested with BamHI to release the BRCT fragment and subsequently cloned into BamHI site of pGEX-2T vector (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The GST-BRCTΔ mutant was engineered using site mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with the following primers: 5′-CCAGGAGCTGGACACCTAACTGATA CCCCAGATCC-3′ and 5′-GGATCTGGGGTATCAGTTAGGTGTCCAGCTCCTGG-3′. pGAL4-BRCT was constructed by digestion of pGST-BRCT with BamHI to release the BRCT fragment and subsequently cloned into the BamHI site of pM2 vector (20Wu L.J.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C.W. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The pGAL4-BRCT mutants, including A1708E, P1749R, and Y1853term, were generated by site-directed mutagenesis with the following primers: 5′-CATTTTCCTCCCTCAATTCCTAG-3′ and 5′-CTAGGAATTGAGGGAGGAAAATG-3′ for A1708E mutant; 5′-CTCTTGCTCGCTTTCGACCTTGGTGG-3′ and 5′-CCACCAAGGTCGAAAG CGAGCAAGAG-3′ for P1749R mutant; the primers used to generate Y1853term mutant was shown above. The pVP16-CtIP plasmid was constructed by cloning full-length CtIP into theNotI site of pVP-Flag5 vector (20Wu L.J.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C.W. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The pGST-CtIP plasmid was engineered by digestion of pVP16-CtIP withXhoI/StuI and subsequently cloned into pGST4 vector. For the transfection study, full-length BRCA1 was cloned intoNotI/XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The pcDNA-CtIP vector that expresses full-length CtIP, the pRcCMV-CtBP vector that expresses the full-length CtBP, and GST-CtBP were previously described (21Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E.

Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar), pSV40-β-gal and pGAL4-VP16 (23Sadowski I. Ma J. Triezenberg S. Ptashne M. Nature. 1988; 335: 563-564Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) plasmids were provided as described. The pAS-BRCT plasmid, which contains the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to BRCA1 (amino acids 1634–1863), was used as the bait for screening a cDNA library prepared from human B lymphocytes as described (24Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Because the bait has weak transactivation activity, 50 mm of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was used in the screening to reduce the background. Bacterially expressed and purified GST or GST fusion proteins were incubated with in vitrosynthesized [35S]methionine-labeled CtIP, BRCA1, or CtIP and BRCA1 proteins as described (25Li S. Ku C.Y. Farmer A.A. Cong Y.S. Chen C.F. Lee W.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6183-6189Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Human kidney 293 cells were used in this assay as described (20Wu L.J.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C.W. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar). The expression of GAL4-X fusion proteins was verified by straight Westerns using a specific antibody that recognizes the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Santa Cruz, CA). Cells were lysed in lysis 250 buffer and immunoprecipitated as described (24Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed by immunoblotting. Human kidney 293 cells were transfected with 0.5 μg of pWWW-luc or pG5E-luc, 0.5 μg of pSV40-β-gal, and 2 μg of each different plasmid DNA as indicated (control vector pcDNA3.1 was used to bring the final amount of DNA to 10 μg) using calcium phosphate/DNA co-precipitation method. Luciferase activity was measured 48 h after transfection as described (26el-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7957) Google Scholar). For each 10-cm dish of HCT116 cells, 10 μg of pRcCMV-CtBP plasmid was transfected, using the Lipofectin transfection method. Human colon cancer cells, HCT116, were treated with UV (1 mJ/cm2) or γ-irradiation (10 Gy), and harvested 1 h after treatment. For adriamycin treatment, HCT116 cells were incubated with adriamycin (0.2 μg/ml) for 24 h before harvest. To explore the potential function of the BRCT repeats of BRCA1, we used them as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen for interacting proteins (24Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 555-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). One of the 20 clones isolated encodes amino acids 17 to 713 of the known protein CtIP (Fig.1 A), which was also identified by others using a different approach (27Yu X. Wu L.C. Bowcock A.M. Aronheim A. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25388-25392Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar, 28Wong A.K. Ormonde P.A. Pero R. Chen Y. Lian L. Salada G. Berry S. Lawrence Q. Dayananth P. Ha P. Tavtigian S.V. Teng D.H. Bartel P.L. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 2279-2285Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To test whether CtIP directly binds to the BRCT repeats, an in vitro binding assay using GST-fusion proteins was performed. The BRCT repeats that served as the bait in the above screen and a mutant containing a familial 1853 tyrosine nonsense mutation were fused with GST (GST-BRCT and GST-BRCTΔ, Fig. 1 B). Bacterially expressed and purified GST-BRCT, but not GST-BRCTΔ or GST (Fig.1 C), can bind to in vitro synthesized [35S]methionine-labeled CtIP protein (Fig. 1 D,lane 3, compare lanes 2 and 4). To ascertain whether CtIP and the BRCT repeats of BRCA1 can interact in cells, a mammalian two-hybrid assay (20Wu L.J.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T. Spillman M.A. Phung A. Xu X.L. Yang M.C.W. Hwang L.Y. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 430-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (626) Google Scholar) was performed. Full-length CtIP was fused to the VP16 transactivation domain of herpesvirus in an expression vector (pVP16-CtIP), and a panel of expression vectors encoding the DNA binding-domain of GAL4 fused to either wild type (GAL4-BRCT, Fig. 1 E) or mutated (GAL4-BRCTM, Fig. 1 E) BRCT repeats of BRCA1 were constructed. The BRCT mutants contain individual alterations identified in familial breast cancers including missense (A1708E, first BRCT repeat; and P1749R, spacer region) and nonsense (Y1853term, second repeat) mutations. Human kidney 293 cells were co-transfected with a GAL4-responsive luciferase (pG5E-luc) and β-galactosidase (pSV40-β-gal) reporters, expression plasmids for either GAL4 or GAL4-BRCT (wild type or mutant), and VP16 or VP16-CtIP. A significant increase in luciferase activity was observed upon co-expression of wild-type GAL4-BRCT and VP16-CtIP (Fig. 1 E, lanes 5 and 6). In contrast, no obvious activity was observed upon co-expression of GAL4 or wild-type GAL4-BRCT with VP16 (Fig.1 E, lanes 1–4), or the mutated BRCT repeats in GAL4-BRCTM with VP16-CtIP (Fig. 1 E, lanes 7–12). Because the cells transfected with GAL4, GAL4-BRCT and GAL4-BRCTM (Fig. 1 F, lanes 2–6) expressed these fusion proteins at comparable levels, the reduction of luciferase activity was not attributable to lack of protein expression. To study the in vivo interactions of endogenous BRCA1 and CtIP, mouse polyclonal antibodies recognizing CtIP (C21) were generated using an antigen consisting of GST translationally fused with amino acids 324–537 of CtIP. [35S]methionine-labeled human colon carcinoma cell (HCT116) lysates immunoprecipitated with C21 identified a band (Fig.2iA, lane 2) whose mobility was consistent with the predicted molecular mass (125 kDa) of CtIP (21Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar). A band of similar size was not detected in the immunoprecipitates of pre-immune serum (Fig. 2 A, compare lanes 1 and2). Pre-incubation of the antiserum with GST-CtIP, but not GST resulted in specific depletion of the 125-kDa band (Fig.2 A, compare lanes 3 and 4). Reprecipitation of the immunoprecipitates by a second incubation with anti-CtIP antibodies resulted in a specific 125-kDa band (Fig.2 A, lane 5). Based on these results, we concluded that the 125-kDa protein is the cellular CtIP protein. The in vivo interaction between CtIP and BRCA1 was further examined in HCT116 and breast cancer cells, HCC1937 (29Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.-L. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K. Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Blum J.L. Schneider N.R. Wistuba I.I. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3237-3242PubMed Google Scholar), by co-immunoprecipitation. HCC1937 cells contain an insertion of cytosine at nucleotide 5382 of BRCA1 that generates a frameshift at amino acid 1794, which stops translation at 1829 (29Tomlinson G.E. Chen T.-L. Stastny V.A. Virmani A.K. Spillman M.A. Tonk V. Blum J.L. Schneider N.R. Wistuba I.I. Shay J.W. Minna J.D. Gazdar A.F. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 3237-3242PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-BRCA1 monoclonal antibody 6B4 (30Chen Y. Chen P.L. Riley D.J. Lee W.H. Allred D.C. Osborne C.K. Science. 1996; 272: 125-126Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but not control antibody against p84 (N5), a nuclear matrix protein (31Durfee T. Mancini M.A. Jones D. Elledge S.J. Lee W.-H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 609-622Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), specifically immunoprecipitated a 220-kDa protein in HCT116 cell lysates (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 1and 2). Consistent with the 5382insC mutation in BRCA1, a faster migrating product was detected in HCC1937 cell lysates (Fig.2 B, lane 3). This protein is likely to be the HCC1937 BRCA1 product because it cannot be recognized by C-20 antibodies (against amino acids 1843–1862 of BRCA1), which readily immunoprecipitated a 220-kDa protein from HCT116 (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 5 and 4). Furthermore, using anti-BRCA1 6B4, but not control antibody N5, CtIP was co-immunoprecipitated with BRCA1 in HCT116 cell lysates (Fig.2 B, compare lanes 1′ and 2′). No detectable CtIP was present in the 6B4 immunoprecipitates from HCC1937 cell lysate (Fig. 2 B, lane 3′). Consistent with this result, BRCA1 was reciprocally co-immunoprecipitated with anti-CtIP C21 antibody from HCT116 cell lysate, but not from HCC1937 cell lysate (Fig. 2 B, compare lanes 7 and8). Levels of CtIP immunoprecipitates detected from both cell lines were comparable (Fig. 2 B, lanes 7′ and8′). These data indicated the existence of an in vivo complex of BRCA1 and CtIP, that, in HCC1937 cells, is disrupted presumably by an altered C terminus lacking intact BRCT repeats. Since BRCA1 has a potential role in DNA repair, its interaction with CtIP may mediate cellular responses to DNA damage. Therefore, it is possible that their interaction might be altered upon treatment of cells with DNA-damaging agents. To address this possibility, HCT116 cells were treated with UV, γ-rays, or adriamycin, and the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-BRCA1 antibody (6B4). Consistent with previous data (32Chen Y. Farmer A.A. Chen C.-F. Jones D.C. Chen P.-L. Lee W.-H. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 3168-3172PubMed Google Scholar, 33Scully R. Chen J.J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (809) Google Scholar), a slower migrating form of phosphorylated BRCA1 was detected after treatment of the cells with DNA-damaging agents (Fig.3 A, lanes 3–5compare with lane 2). Importantly, the association of CtIP was undetectable in the BRCA1 immunoprecipitates subsequent to DNA damage (Fig. 3 A, compare lanes 3′-5′ andlane 2′). This change in BRCA1/CtIP association appeared to be correlated with increased BRCA1 phosphorylation. The undetectable levels of CtIP in BRCA1 immunoprecipitates were not due to lower expression because the amount of CtIP did not change subsequent to treatment with genotoxic agents (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were also observed in breast epithelial cell line MCF10A (data not shown). CtIP was originally identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for proteins that interacted with an adenovirus E1A C-terminal-binding protein, CtBP (22Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The binding of CtBP to E1A represses CR1-dependent transcriptional activation and tumorigenesis (21Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T. Chinnadurai G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10467-10471Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar, 34Sollerbrant K. Chinnadurai G. Svensson C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 2578-2584Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Both CtIP and E1A use a conserved PLDLS motif to interact with CtBP. Several transcription factors including Knirps, Snail (35Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M. Science. 1998; 280: 101-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), and Hairy (36Poortinga G. Watanabe M. Parkhurst S.M. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 2067-2078Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), which contain P-DLS-K/V motifs, bind to CtBP to repress transcription during Drosophila development. Based on this observation, it is possible that BRCA1 is linked to the CtBP co-repressor through CtIP. To address this possibility, we used an in vitro binding assay to test whether CtIP has different binding motifs for BRCA1 and CtBP. As shown, mutation of the PLDLS motif in CtIP to LASQC abolished the interaction between CtIP and GST-CtBP (Fig.4 A, compare lanes 4and 8). However, the interaction between the mutated CtIP and GST-BRCT was unaffected (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 3 and 7), suggesting that CtIP binds to CtBP and the BRCT repeats of BRCA1 using different motifs. Thus, it is possible that CtIP can bridge BRCA1 and CtBP to form a complex. To test this possibility, HCT116 cells were transiently transfected with pRcCMV-CtBP to overexpress the T7-tagged CtBP full-length protein. As shown, anti-T7-tag antibody can co-immunoprecipitate the full-length CtBP protein, cellular CtIP, and BRCA1 (Fig. 4 B, lane 2), but not the control antibody (lane 1). In the reciprocal experiment, anti-BRCA1 antibody can bring down cellular BRCA1, CtIP and T7-tagged CtBP (Fig. 4 B, lane 4). These results suggest that CtBP, CtIP, and BRCA1 can form a complex. Previous studies (10Somasundaram K. Zhang H.B. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H.X. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar, 12Ouchi T. Monteiro A.N.A. August A. Aaronson S.A. Hanafusa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2302-2306Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar) showed that BRCA1 was able to transactivate p21 expression. Formation of the CtBP, CtIP, and BRCA1 complex predicts that ectopic expression of CtIP or CtBP may affect BRCA1-dependent transactivation of the p21 promoter. To test this hypothesis, transient transfections of human 293 cells were performed with a p21 promoter-luciferase reporter plasmid pWWW-luc, pSV40-β-gal transfection control plasmid, and combinations of BRCA1, CtIP, and CtBP expression vectors. The expression of BRCA1 resulted in a 5-fold activation of the p21 promoter compared with empty vector alone. Co-expression of CtIP moderately inhibited BRCA1-dependent transactivation of the p21 promoter. However, co-expression of CtIP and CtBP repressed p21 promoter activity to background levels (Fig. 5 A). Interestingly, co-expression of CtBP and BRCA1 also resulted in significant repression of p21 promoter, which was likely due to the abundance of endogenous CtIP in cells. Likewise, the modest inhibition of BRCA1-dependent transcription by CtIP may be due to the recruitment of cellular CtBP. Overexpression of CtBP alone does not have an effect on p21 promoter (Fig.5 A). The repression of BRCA1-dependent transactivation of p21 promoter by CtBP and CtIP depends on their association with BRCA1, because overexpression of CtIP and CtBP cannot repress the transactivation of GAL4 promoter (pG5E-Luc) by the GAL4-VP16 hybrid (Fig. 5 B). These experiments suggest that a potential biological function of the BRCA1/CtIP interaction is to repress target promoters through contacts with the CtBP co-repressor. The BRCT repeats were first identified as a highly conserved structural domain among more than 50 nonorthologous proteins, many of which are involved in DNA repair and cell cycle check point control (14Callebaut I. Mornon J.P. FEBS Lett. 1997; 400: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 15Bork P. Hofmann K. Bucher P. Neuwald A.F. Altschul S.F. Koonin E.V. FASEB J. 1997; 11: 68-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar, 16Koonin E.V. Altschul S.F. Bork P. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 266-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). Familial mutations have been frequently found in the BRCT repeats of BRCA1, suggesting that the function of the BRCT repeats of BRCA1 is important for the BRCA1 tumor suppression function. Using BRCT repeats as bait, we have identified a BRCA1-associated protein, CtIP. CtIP interacts specifically with the BRCT repeats of BRCA1 both in vitro and in vivo, and tumor-derived mutations in BRCT repeats abolish this specific interaction. The three tumor-derived mutations A1708E, P1749R, and Y1853term, are either located in the first motif, second motif, or the spacer region of BRCT repeats. However, all of them abolish the interaction of BRCT repeats with CtIP. Interestingly, these mutations also abolish the transactivation activity of BRCA1(13). This tight correlation suggests that the interaction between BRCA1 and CtIP is relevant to its transcription regulation activity. CtIP was originally identified as a CtBP-associated protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. Further study has mapped the PLDLS motif in CtIP as the binding site for CtBP (22Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). This motif was also found in E1A and several Drosophila transcriptional factors (22Schaeper U. Subramanian T. Lim L. Boyd J.M. Chinnadurai G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8549-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 35Nibu Y. Zhang H. Levine M.

BRCA1 does not have a PLDLS motif, and cannot bind to CtBP directly. Apparently, CtIP has different binding motifs for CtBP and BRCA1 respectively, allowing CtBP to associate with BRCA1 through CtIP, as shown in Fig. 4. The formation of this complex is important for the repression of BRCA1-dependent transcription activation of the p21 promoter. Data from previous studies (10Somasundaram K. Zhang H.B. Zeng Y.X. Houvras Y. Peng Y. Zhang H.X. Wu G.S. Licht J.D. Weber B.L. El-Deiry W.S. Nature. 1997; 389: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar) and in this report (Fig. 5) suggested that overexpression of exogenous BRCA1 can transactivate the p21 promoter. A reasonable explanation for these observations is that overexpression of BRCA1 titrates the CtIP/CtBP complex and allows the additional copies of BRCA1 to act on the p21 promoter. The up-regulation of p21 was observed in cells treated with DNA-damaging agents (37Elledge S.J. Science. 1996; 274: 1664-1672Crossref PubMed Scopus (1772) Google Scholar). Similarly, treatment with DNA-damaging agents disrupts the interaction between BRCA1 and CtIP/CtBP, thus, allowing BRCA1 to transactivate p21 promoter. Dissociation of CtIP and BRCA1 is correlated with the hyperphosphorylation of BRCA1 upon treatment with DNA-damaging agents. These results suggest that CtIP/CtBP may negatively regulate the transactivation activity of BRCA1 on the p21 promoter. However, whether BRCA1 transactivates p21 promoter directly or binds to additional transcription factors remains to be explored. We thank K. Somasundaram and W.

A striking feature of the protein is the presence of six metal binding sites (MBSs) in the N-terminal region with the highly conserved consensus sequence GMXCXXC. MNK is normally located in thetrans-Golgi network (TGN) but has been shown to relocalize to the plasma membrane when cells are cultured in media containing high concentrations of copper. The experiments described in this report test the hypothesis that the six MBSs are required for this copper-induced trafficking of MNK. Site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert both cysteine residues in the conserved MBS motifs to serines. Mutation of MBS 1, MBS 6, and MBSs 1–3 resulted in a molecule that appeared to relocalize normally with copper, but when MBSs 4–6 or MBSs 1–6 were mutated, MNK remained in the TGN, even when cells were exposed to 300 μm copper. Furthermore, the ability of the MNK variants to relocalize corresponded well with their ability to confer copper resistance. To further define the critical motifs, MBS 5 and MBS 6 were mutated, and these changes abolished the response to copper. The region from amino acid 8 to amino acid 485 was deleted, resulting in mutant MNK that lacked 478 amino acids from the N-terminal region, including the first four MBSs. This truncated molecule responded normally to copper. Moreover, when either one of the remaining MBS 5 and MBS 6 was mutated to GMXSXXS, the resulting proteins were localized to the TGN in low copper and relocalized in response to elevated copper. These experiments demonstrated that the deleted N-terminal region from amino acid 8 to amino acid 485 was not essential for copper-induced trafficking and that one MBS close to the membrane channel of MNK was necessary and sufficient for the copper-induced redistribution.

Copper is an essential element required for enzymes such as cytochrome c oxidase, lysyl oxidase, and dopamine-β-hydroxylase that employ its fundamental redox properties in the respiratory chain, connective tissue biosynthesis, and catecholamine production, respectively. Nevertheless, these biochemically useful redox properties can also lead to serious cellular damage through the formation of highly reactive free radicals. Thus, intracellular copper concentrations must be tightly regulated. Various molecules are involved in the maintenance of cellular copper homeostasis, many of which have been recently identified and characterized (for a review, see Ref. 1Vulpe C.D. Packman S. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1995; 15: 293-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Among these are copper efflux proteins whose essential role is demonstrated in the genetically inherited Menkes and Wilson diseases. The genes affected in these diseases were identified by several independent groups (2Mercer J.F. Livingston J. Hall B. Paynter J.A. Begy C. Chandrasekharappa S. Lockhart P. Grimes A. Bhave M.

MNK and WND encode highly homologous membrane proteins of 178 and 165 kDa, respectively. They belong to the family of P-type ATPases classically represented by the human Ca2+-ATPases and the ubiquitous Na+/K+-ATPases (7Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1987; 12: 146-150Abstract Full Text PDF Scopus (818) Google Scholar). Together with Cd2+-ATPases, Cu+/2+-ATPases form a subfamily of CPX-type ATPases (X = Cys, His, or Ser) characterized by a conserved Cys-Pro-X motif in the proposed ion transduction channel and a variable number of GMXCXXC putative heavy metal binding sites (MBS) 1The abbreviations used are: MBS, metal binding site; MNK, Menkes protein; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; kb, kilobase(s); BME, Eagle's basal media; wt, wild-type; WND, Wilson protein.1The abbreviations used are: MBS, metal binding site; MNK, Menkes protein; TGN, trans-Golgi network; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; kb, kilobase(s); BME, Eagle's basal media; wt, wild-type; WND, Wilson protein. at the N terminus (8Solioz M.

(Tokyo). 1997; 121: 1169-1175Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and the human MNK and WND have six metal binding sites (8Solioz M. Vulpe C. Trends Biochem.

These studies suggest a binding stoichiometry of one copper atom per metal binding site for both MNK and WND N termini and a capacity to bind Zn, Ni, and Co (13DiDonato M. Narindrasorasak S.

Thus far, the biochemical function of the MNK and WND N termini has only been studied in a Δccc2 mutant yeast strain in which human MNK and WND fully restored copper delivery to the high affinity iron uptake system (15Payne A.S.

Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The third MBS was found to be most critical for catalytic activity of MNK and was suggested to be involved in protein-protein interaction (15Payne A.S. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 3765-3770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). A further study demonstrated that the deletion of a region comprising MBS 6 rendered WND inactive (16Iida M. Terada K. Sambongi Y. Wakabayashi T. Miura N. Koyama K. Futai M. Sugiyama T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 428: 281-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).In CHO-K1 cells, human fibroblasts, and HeLa cells, MNK is localized to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (17Petris M.J.

A. 1996; 93: 14030-14035Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Copper-dependent redistribution of MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane was demonstrated in copper-resistant CHO-K1 cells that overexpressed the endogenous hamster MNK homologue (17Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Recently, this observation was supported by experiments with stable CHO-K1 cells expressing human MNK from a cDNA construct (20La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H. Parton R.G. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Copper-induced movement of WND from the TGN to an as yet unidentified intracellular compartment has also been observed (21Yang X.L. Miura N. Kawarada Y. Terada K. Petrukhin K. Gilliam T.C. Sugiyama T. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 897-902Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 22Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Despite these data, little is known about the structural domains involved in the exocytic and endocytic trafficking of these copper-transporting proteins. An obvious candidate region that may be involved in the copper-dependent trafficking of MNK is the N-terminal region containing the six copper-binding GMXCXXC motifs.The objective of this study was to clarify the role of the N-terminal MBSs of MNK in copper-induced redistribution. We report here that not all of the MBSs are essential for the relocalization of MNK and for conferring a copper-resistant phenotype. Furthermore, the presence of only one MBS within a region of ∼170 amino acids adjacent to the proposed transduction channel is necessary and sufficient for the copper-induced exocytic trafficking of the Menkes protein. In addition, the data indicate that protein-protein interactions that may be required for the translocation of MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane do not involve amino acids 8–485 of the MNK N terminus.RESULTSThe role of the six MBSs in MNK trafficking was investigated using site-directed and deletion mutagenesis of the MNK N terminus. Constructs encoding MNK mutated in MBS 1 alone (MNKm1), MBS 6 alone (MNKm6), MBSs 1–3 (MNKm1-3), MBSs 4–6 (MNKm4-6), and MBS 5 and MBS 6 (MNKm5+6) were generated. Amino acids 8–485 at the N terminus of MNK were deleted to create MNKΔ1-4, and in this construct, mutations were separately introduced within MBS 5 (MNKΔ1-4m5) and MBS 6 (MNKΔ1-4m6) to generate constructs with only one functional MBS (Fig.1).All of the mutated MNK cDNA constructs were initially transiently transfected into CHO-K1 cells, and the intracellular distribution of the mutated MNK molecules was assessed by indirect immunofluorescence using polyclonal antibodies directed against the MNK N or C terminus. Stable cell lines were established for constructs containingMNKm1-3, MNKm4-6 and MNKm1-6. In basal copper concentrations, fluorescent staining was observed within the perinuclear region of all of the transfected cells (Figs.Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6; − Cu), consistent with location at the TGN and with previous results obtained with CHO-K1 cells (17Petris M.J.

Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Thus, the overexpressed, mutated MNKs were not mislocalized under basal conditions. Furthermore, the mutations did not affect MNK epitope recognition by the polyclonal antibody, suggesting that even multiple point mutations within the N terminus did not induce significant antigenic changes in the molecule.Figure 6Copper resistance characteristics of MNK-expressing clones.

There were no obvious differences in the staining pattern of cells expressing mutated or wt proteins as observed after incubation in different copper concentrations (data not shown). Thus, a single GMXCXXC to GMXSXXS mutation within the MNK N terminus did not influence the copper-inducible relocation of MNK.Proteins transiently expressed in cells differ significantly in their levels of expression. Therefore, the interpretation of results obtained with transiently transfected cells can be complicated by artifacts resulting from overexpression of the target protein. To allow a clearer analysis of the effects of mutations, stable cell lines were generated from CHO-K1 cells that expressed the mutant MNK forms MNKm1-3, MNKm4-6, and MNKm1-6. These cell lines were designated 114, 115, and 116, respectively.To confirm that the expressed mutant proteins were of the expected sizes and to determine the level of MNK expression, Western blots on whole cell lysates of the stable cell lines were carried out (Fig.3 A). A protein of the expected size of ∼178 kDa was detected in each of cell lines 114, 115, and 116, also demonstrating the capacity of the anti-MNK antibody to recognize the mutated proteins. Compared with the endogenous CHO-K1 Menkes protein homologue, significantly more MNK was expressed in the transfected cell lines. This level of expression corresponded well with the intensity of the fluorescent signal observed in the whole cell fluorescence experiments described below.The intracellular location of MNKm1-3, MNKm4-6, and MNKm1-6 was assessed by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. All of these mutated proteins localized to the TGN in cells cultured in basal medium (Fig. 3 B). When cells were incubated for 3 h in 80 μm copper, some redistribution to the plasma membrane was noticeable in the wt cells and in cell line 114 (MNKm1-3). In high copper concentrations, the labeling of the plasma membrane of these cells intensified and was the predominant signal at 300 μm copper (Fig. 3 B). When the 114 and the wt cell lines were incubated for 10, 20, 40, 60, and 120 min in media containing 100 μm copper, there were no noticeable differences in the kinetics of the translocation observed for the two MNK forms (data not shown). In contrast to wt MNK and MNKm1-3, MNKm4-6 and MNKm1-6 remained at the TGN after incubation in high copper concentrations (300 μm). These data demonstrated that the first three MBSs were not essential for the copper-dependent redistribution of MNK, whereas the three MBSs closest to the transport channel were critical.To further localize the regions critical for relocalization, a construct with MNK mutated in MBS 5 and MBS 6 was created (MNKm5+6). CHO-K1 cells transiently transfected with this construct showed clear perinuclear staining that indicated TGN localization of MNKm5+6. In the presence of elevated copper, MNKm5+6 remained at the TGN, whereas wt MNK relocated to the plasma membrane (Fig.4). This result showed that MBSs 1–4 were not sufficient for the copper-dependent redistribution of MNK.To determine whether amino acids other than the MBSs in the N-terminal region play a role in copper-induced trafficking and whether both MBS 5 and MBS 6 or just one of the two were essential, a construct encoding MNK that lacked MBSs 1–4 was generated (MNKΔ1-4) and mutated individually at MBS 5 (MNKΔ1-4m5) and MBS 6 (MNKΔ1-4m6). Immunofluorescence microscopy using an antibody directed against the MNK C terminus showed that in basal media, all three mutant proteins were located at the TGN of transiently transfected CHO-K1 cells. However, when cells were incubated in 200 μm copper for 3 h, an elevated, dispersed fluorescence was evident throughout the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane (Fig.5). These results showed that amino acids 8–485 of the MNK N terminus were not necessary for the copper-induced redistribution of the protein; therefore, this region did not contain a critical copper-sensing or copper-responsive targeting signal. In addition, these data indicated that a single MBS located within a maximum distance of 170 amino acids from the membrane channel was sufficient for MNK trafficking.The ability of the mutated proteins to confer copper resistance was determined by assessing the survival of 114, 115 and 116 cells (expressing MNKm1-3, MNKm4-6, and MNKm1-6, respectively) compared with the parental CHO-K1 cells and CHO-K1 cells expressing wt MNK in increasing copper concentrations (Fig.6). The level of copper resistance of cell lines 115 and 116 was similar to that of the parental CHO-K1 cells with an estimated LD50 of 60–65 μmCuCl2 (Fig. 6, B and C). In contrast, the survival of 114 cells and the wt cell line was still evident up to 105 μm CuCl2, with a LD50 of 75 and 105 μm copper, respectively (Fig. 6 A). However, the difference in copper resistance of 114 cells compared with wt cells may be explained by a ∼50% reduction in the level of MNK expression in 114 cells (Fig. 3 A); therefore, MNKm1-3 may be functionally equivalent to wt MNK.Taken together, these results showed that: (i) point mutations converting either a single MBS or the first three MBSs from GMXCXXC to GMXSXXS have no effect on the copper-induced intracellular redistribution of MNK as shown with MNKm1, MNKm6, and MNKm1-3; (ii) the protein region encompassing the first four MBSs is not necessary for copper-regulated trafficking; (iii) one MBS within the region comprising MBS 5 to MBS 6 is necessary and sufficient for copper-dependent MNK trafficking; and (iv) the ability of MNK to confer resistance to copper is linked to its ability to undergo copper-induced redistribution.DISCUSSIONPetris et al. (17Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar) previously demonstrated a copper-responsive relocalization of MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane in copper-resistant CHO-K1 cells. Recently, a copper-dependent redistribution to the cell surface was demonstrated in CHO-K1 cells that expressed human MNK (20La Fontaine S. Firth S.D. Lockhart P.J. Brooks H. Parton R.G. Camakaris J. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1293-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). To explain the MNK response to elevated copper levels, it was postulated that the N terminus functioned as a copper-sensing domain in which the six MBSs became progressively occupied by copper, causing a conformational change that triggered the redistribution of MNK (17Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). In this study, we have used an extensive mutagenesis strategy to define the role of the six MBSs in the copper-induced trafficking of MNK.The mutation of a single MBS did not inhibit the copper-induced relocalization of MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane, as demonstrated by mutations of MBS 1 and MBS 6 (Fig. 2). The majority of point mutations that have been identified in Menkes patients occur within exons 7–10, which encode MBS 6 and the first four transmembrane helices. All of the point mutations identified within the N terminus were either nonsense mutations or insertion/deletion mutations that are predicted to result in a truncation of the MNK gene product (29Tumer Z. Lund C. Tolshave J. Vural B. Tonnesen T. Horn N. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1997; 60: 63-71PubMed Google Scholar). These observations suggest that point mutations that disrupt the function of a single MBS are not likely to cause a disease phenotype and are supported by our findings that six functional MBSs are not necessary for MNK trafficking.In elevated copper, MNKm1-3 was able to redistribute to the plasma membrane, demonstrating that the first three GMXCXXC repeats are not essential for the copper-induced trafficking of MNK (Fig. 3 B). In contrast to MNKm1-3, MNKm1-6, MNKm4-6, and MNKm5+6 remained predominantly within the perinuclear region, even under very high copper concentrations (300 μm) (Figs. 3 B and 4). This result suggested that the MBSs close to the membrane channel were more important for the intracellular trafficking of MNK. Further support for this conclusion was obtained with the deletion constructs containing only MBS 5 and MBS 6 that showed that only one functional MBS close to the channel was necessary and sufficient for MNK trafficking (Fig. 5). These experiments demonstrated that 478 amino acids within the MNK N terminus did not contain a critical targeting sequence and were not required for the copper-dependent exocytic trafficking of MNK, effectively negating the hypothesis that the multiple metal binding sites constitute a relocalization domain.The ability of the mutated MNK molecules to traffic corresponded well with their ability to confer copper resistance. The parental CHO-K1 cells and cell lines 115 and 116 that overexpressed MNK mutated in MBSs 4–6 and MBSs 1–6, respectively, did not survive in copper levels greater than 75 μm for 7 days. In contrast, the cell lines overexpressing MNKm1-3 and wt MNK (114 and wt cells, respectively) were significantly more resistant to copper (Fig. 6,A–C). This experiment demonstrated that the copper-resistant phenotype was caused by the overexpression of MNK. Therefore, MNK molecules mutated in the first three MBSs were able to effectively efflux copper, indicating that MBSs 1–3 were not essential for both MNK trafficking and copper transport.Earlier data suggested that MNK constitutively recycled between the TGN and the plasma membrane in cells cultured in low-copper media (17Petris M.J. Mercer J.F. Culvenor J.G. Lockhart P. Gleeson P.A. Camakaris J. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6084-6095Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar). Copper-induced relocalization of MNK could involve an increase in the rate of exocytosis of MNK from the TGN to the plasma membrane or a reduction in the rate of endocytosis from the plasma membrane. No published data distinguish between these two possibilities. However, two regions important for its basal location in the TGN have been identified. The first is a 38-amino acid sequence containing transmembrane domain 3, characterized as a candidate region responsible for Golgi retention of MNK (30Francis M.J. Jones E.E. Levy E.R. Ponnambalam S. Chelly J. Monaco A.P. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 1245-1252Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). In addition, TGN localization has recently been shown to depend on a di-leucine motif, 1487LL1488, within the C-terminal region of MNK (26Petris M.J. Camakaris J. Greenough M. La Fontaine S. Mercer J.F.B. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 2063-2071Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Di-leucines are a class of endocytic targeting signals directing plasma membrane proteins into clathrin-coated vesicles, resulting in constitutive internalization of these membrane proteins (31Trowbridge I.S. Collawn J.F. Hopkins C.R. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 129-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (700) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, one hypothesis to explain the accumulation of MNK at the plasma membrane is that copper retards the internalization of the protein by causing a conformational change that obscures the C-terminal di-leucine motif. This conformational change may occur as a consequence of the binding of copper to MBS 5 or MBS 6. To clarify whether this mechanism is operative, some measurements of the rate of internalization of MNK in the presence and absence of copper will be required.An alternative model to explain copper-induced relocalization is that conformational changes induced by copper-binding at the N terminus may activate the delivery of copper to the channel and induce the translocation of a copper ion across the cell membrane. Further conformational changes that are coincident with the copper pumping mechanism of MNK may reveal a motif that is recognized by the vesicular sorting machinery, leading to an increase in the number of MNK molecules that are loaded onto vesicles destined for the plasma membrane. In this mechanism, the proximity of the MBS to the transduction channel may be critical either for the direct delivery of copper to the channel or for the acceptance of copper from copper chaperones such as HAH1 (32Klomp L.W.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 9221-9226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) that specifically interact with the protein region comprising MBS 5 and MBS 6. This model is supported by several recent experiments from our laboratory that showed different mutations in structurally and functionally distinct regions of MNK, which are predicted to disrupt copper transport activity, inhibited the copper-dependent trafficking of the protein. 2S. La Fontaine, L. Ambrosini, and D. Strausak, unpublished observations. In addition, Payneet al. (22Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar) have reported that a mutation in a region distinct from the metal binding sites in the closely related Cu-ATPases affected in Wilson disease also abolished copper-induced relocalization (22Payne A.S. Kelly E.J. Gitlin J.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10854-10859Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). These observations suggest that mutations in MNK that disrupt copper transport may also prevent copper-induced relocalization to the plasma membrane.The redundancy of 478 N-terminal amino acids containing four MBSs implies that as with bacteria and yeast, a Cu-ATPase with only one MBS or two MBSs at the N terminus may be sufficient to maintain some degree of copper homeostasis in mammalian cells. The number of MBSs at the N terminus has increased during evolution: one in bacteria, two in yeast, three in nematodes, and six in mammals. This observation suggests that MNK and WND gained the additional MBSs simply by amplification of the repeated elements. The additional MBSs may have evolved to increase the efficiency of copper scavenging in the cytoplasm or copper ion delivery to the transduction channel in the cells of higher organisms. However, to further clarify the role of the six MBSs in the human copper-transporting ATPases, additional studies involving copper transport activity measurements of the mutant MNK forms will be required.

G., Reeders, S. T., and Tryggvason, K. (1993) J. Biol. Chem. 268, 26033–26036). In this study, chimeric proteins were used to map the location of the major conformational, disulfide bond-dependent GP autoepitope(s) that has been previously localized to the noncollagenous (NC1) domain of α3(IV) chain. Fourteen α1/α3 NC1 chimeras were constructed by substituting one or more short sequences of α3(IV)NC1 at the corresponding positions in the non-immunoreactive α1(IV)NC1 domain and expressed in mammalian cells for proper folding. The interaction between the chimeras and eight GP sera was assessed by both direct and inhibition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Two chimeras, C2 containing residues 17–31 of α3(IV)NC1 and C6 containing residues 127–141 of α3(IV)NC1, bound autoantibodies, as did combination chimeras containing these regions. The epitope(s) that encompasses these sequences is immunodominant, showing strong reactivity with all GP sera and accounting for 50–90% of the autoantibody reactivity toward α3(IV)NC1. The conformational nature of the epitope(s) in the C2 and C6 chimeras was established by reduction of the disulfide bonds and by PEPSCAN analysis of overlapping 12-mer peptides derived from α1- and α3(IV)NC1 sequences. The amino acid sequences 17–31 and 127–141 in α3(IV)NC1 have thus been shown to contain the critical residues of one or two disulfide bond-dependent conformational autoepitopes that bind GP autoantibodies.

Tissue injury is mediated by anti-basement membrane antibodies that bind alveolar and glomerular basement membranes. The target autoantigen of basement membranes has been identified as the α3(IV) collagen chain, one of six homologous chains designated α1–α6 that comprise type IV collagen (2Hudson B.G. Reeders S.T. Tryggvason K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26033-26036Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the glomerular basement membrane, the α3(IV) chain exists in a supramolecular network along with the α4(IV) and α5(IV) chains (3Gunwar S. Ballester F. Noelken M.E. Sado Y. Ninomiya Y. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 8767-8775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar). The α3(IV) chain is composed of a long collagenous domain of 1410 amino acids and a non-collagenous (NC1) domain of 232 residues at the carboxyl terminus (4Mariyama M. Leinonen A. Mochizuki T. Tryggvason K. Reeders S.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23013-23017Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The GP autoepitope(s) has been localized to the NC1 domain of the α3(IV) chain (5Butkowski R.J. Langeveld J.P. Wieslander J. Hamilton J. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Wieslander J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 105: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). The autoepitope(s) in the α3(IV)NC1 domain appears to be conformational, because reduction of disulfide bonds abolishes most of the binding (9Hellmark T. Brunmark C. Trojnar J. Wieslander J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 105: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar, 10Wieslander J. Bygren P. Heinegard D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The identification of the precise amino acid residues that constitute this epitope(s) is important for understanding the etiology and pathogenesis of the GP disease and for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Several groups have attempted to map the location of the autoepitope(s) by using short linear peptides (9Hellmark T. Brunmark C. Trojnar J. Wieslander J. Clin. Exp.

Chem. 1996; 271: 9062-9068Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Although linear sequences have been identified that bind GP antibodies, these findings are at variance with each other. Moreover, prior studies have not addressed whether these linear sequences constitute the major conformational, disulfide bond-dependent epitope(s). The aim of this study was to identify the α3(IV)NC1 amino acid sequences that form the thus far elusive conformational GP epitope(s). To circumvent the limitations of previous approaches, we pursued an epitope mapping strategy based on chimeric proteins. This approach has been specifically developed and successfully used to map conformational epitopes (16Hsia R. Beals T. Boothroyd J.C. Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 53-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) or autoepitopes (17Henriksson E.W. Pettersson I. J. Autoimmun. 1997; 10: 559-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We hypothesized that the α3(IV)NC1 regions most likely to form the autoepitope(s) are those most divergent from the other homologous α(IV) chains. A series of chimeric α1/α3(IV)NC1 domains were constructed in which these candidate α3(IV)NC1 sequences replaced the corresponding sequences in the non-immunoreactive α1(IV)NC1. The chimeras were expressed in mammalian cells for correct protein folding and disulfide bond formation. We report that two specific sequences, α3(IV)NC1 residues 17–31 and 127–141, contain the critical residues of one or two disulfide bond-dependent conformational GP autoepitopes within the α3(IV)NC1 domain. A suitable vector (Fig. 1) for the expression of recombinant proteins was based on pRc/AC7, a derivative of pRc/CMV (Invitrogen) that contained an expression cassette consisting of the BM-40 5′-untranslated region, BM-40 signal peptide, and an α3 type VI collagen insert (18Mayer U. Poschl E. Nischt R. Specks U. Pan T.C. Chu M.L. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 225: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). By using a two-step inverse PCR with the appropriate primers (Table I), the original insert was replaced by a FLAG™ recognition sequence (Eastman Kodak Co.), and additional restriction sites (NheI,ClaI, HpaI, and SacII) were introduced further downstream. The resulting vector (pRc-X) was used for the expression of the chimeras (Fig. 1, middle). After cleavage of the signal peptide, secreted proteins would contain at the amino terminus a 14-residue fusion sequence (APLADYKDDDDKLA) that included the FLAG peptide (underlined) used for affinity purification.Table IThe PCR primer sequences and the restriction enzymes used for cloning of the recombinant proteinsProductPrimer sequences (5′ → 3′)EnzymeVectorA11A, forward primer; B, reverse primer.CAAGCTAGCGGCCGCTCGAGATGCATCTAGAGGGCCCNheIIntermediateB11A, forward primer; B, reverse primer.GCCGCTAGCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGGCTAGTGGGGCTGCCAGAGCCCT1FLAG sequence underlined.NheIpRc-XA2AGCTCTAGAGTCATCGATGTTAACCGCGGGCCCTATTCTATAGTGTCXbaIB2CCCTCTAGATGCATCTCGAGCGGCXbaIα1(IV)NC1A3GCTAGCATCTGTTGATCACGGCTTCCNheIB3CCGCGGTAGCTGAGTCAGGCTTCATTATGSacIIC2A4AGTGGAAGACGGGGACAGTGCCACTCTACAGTGGGTACTCTTTGCTCTACGTGBbsIB4TGCAGAAGACCTGTCCCCTCTGGACATGAAGGAATTGCTGTTGTTTGACTATGCCTGGTCACAAGGBbsIC3A5GAGCGAAGACAAGAATGTTCAGAAAGCCTATTCCGTCCACCTTGAAGGCAGBbsIB5GGCTGAAGACACATTCTTTCTGGGTTTAATGAGGCGAGCCAAAAGCTGTAAGCBbsIC5A6CAGTGAAGACTCCCATTACTGGCAGAGCCCTTGAGCCATTTATTAGTAGGTGTGCTGBbsIB6ACGTGAAGACTAATGGGAGCCATGTTCATTGGCATCAGCTCAGGGGTGGACAGCCAGTACBbsIC6A7CAGCGAAGACTGTCCTCACGGCTGGATTTCTCTCTGGAAAGGCTACTCTTTTGTGATGCACBbsIB7AGATGAAGACTGAGGACATGGAGGAATGTCAGTGGTCTGGCTGTGCACGGCCATCBbsIC1A8AATGCTAGCAACCTGGACAACGAGAGGCTTCCTTGTGACCAGGNheIB8GACATCGATCTGAGTCAGGCTTCATTATGClaIC4A9ACGTGAAGACTCAGGTGTGCATGAAGAAAAGACACTAATGAAGCCTGACTCAGCTAGGBbsIB9CTTCGAAGACACACCTGACAGCGACTTATTATTTTTTCCAGCTCCCCTGCCTTCAAGBbsIC7A10ATATGCTAGCTGGTTTGAAAGGAAAACGTGGAGACAGTGGATCACCTGCAACCTGGACAACGAGANheIB10GACATCGATCTGAGTCAGGCTTCATTATGClaIα1(IV)NC1A11ATATGCTAGCAGGGCCTCCAGGCACCCCATCTGTTGATCACGGCTTCNheI+Gly-X-YB11GACATCGATCTGAGTCAGGCTTCATTATGClaIC8A12GATCGAAGACCACCGTGAAGGCAGGGGAGCTGGAABbsIB12CAGTGAAGACTCACGGTGGACGGAATAGGCTTTCBbsIa A, forward primer; B, reverse primer.b FLAG sequence underlined. Open table in a new tab The cDNA for the human α1(IV)NC1 domain was amplified from a human kidney cDNA library (Marathon-Ready™,CLONTECH) by PCR using Klentaq polymerase (CLONTECH) and subcloned into pCR™II vector by using a TA cloning kit (Invitrogen). The inserts with the correct sequence were subcloned into pRc-X. The resulting pRc/fα1 construct was subsequently used for the construction of α1/α3 chimeras (Fig.2). Unless otherwise indicated,Pfu polymerase (Stratagene) was used in the PCR reactions for its low error rates. Restriction enzymes and ligase were purchased from New England Biolabs. The correct sequence of each construct was verified by sequencing. The principle of the inverse PCR approach that was used for chimerasC2, C3, C5, and C6 is depicted inside the dashed circle in Fig. 1(top). The primers (Table I) were designed in a back-to-back orientation, each containing (in 3′ to 5′ order) residues complementary to the α1(IV)NC1 template, residues complementary to a part of the replacement α3(IV)NC1 sequence, and the recognition site of the inward-cutting BbsI restriction enzyme (GAAGAC(N)2/6). PCR yielded 6.3-kilobase pair amplicons that comprised the whole vector and insert. Digestion with BbsI removed the recognition site and created complementary ends inside the inserted α3(IV) sequence, and then ligation produced a circular expression vector containing a chimeric α1/α3(IV)NC1 insert with no extraneous sequence. Construction of C1 and C4 chimeras was based on a regular PCR strategy using pRC/fα1 as a template and introducing α3 sequences by primers at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the NC1 insert, respectively. The PCR products were digested with restriction enzymes (Table I) and subcloned into the pRc-X vector for expression. The construction of C7 chimera followed a similar scheme, requiring C1 as template. In order to construct chimeraC8, two collagenous Gly-X-Y triplets of the α1(IV) chain had first to be added to the 5′ end of the α1(IV)NC1 sequence. An α1(IV)NC1 + Gly-X-Y insert was amplified from a pRc/fα1 template, digested with NheI/PpuMI, and ligated into a C3·4 vector preparation cut with the same enzymes. Inverse PCR with this template generated chimeraC8. Six combination chimeras were also constructed as follows:C1·2, C1·4, C2·6,C3·5, C1·2·5, and C7·8.C1·2 chimera was generated using primers for theC1 construct and C2 as template, digested withNheI and ClaI, and then subcloned into the pRc-X vector. The remaining chimeras were generated by subcloning the chimeric insert region of one chimera into a vector preparation of another chimera digested with the same restriction enzymes.C1·4 required subcloning of aNheI/PpuMI C1 insert fragment into theC4 vector; likewise, C2·6 required anApaI C6 insert in the C2 vector;C3·5 required a PpuMI/SacIIC3 insert in the C5 vector; C1·2·5required an ApaI C5 insert in theC1·2 vector; and C7·8 required aPpuMI/SacII C8 insert in theC7 vector. Recombinant α1/α3 chimeras were expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC 1573-CRL) grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (Sigma) and 50 μg/ml ascorbic acid phosphate magnesium salt (Wako). Five to ten μg of plasmid DNA were transfected by the calcium phosphate co-precipitation method (19Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. 2nd Ed. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 3. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 16.32-16.40Google Scholar) into 70% confluent 293 cells. After 2 days, transfected cells were selected with 250 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies, Inc.). Resistant cells were screened for expression of recombinant protein by Western blot using an anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2, Kodak) and expanded for quantitative expression. The medium was collected from subconfluent cultures every 48 h, and the recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on anti-FLAG M2 affinity columns (Kodak) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Protein solutions were concentrated by ultrafiltration (Amicon) and stored at −70 °C. The concentration of recombinant protein solutions was measured spectrophotometrically at 280 nm. An average extinction coefficient A of 1.6 ≅ 1 mg/ml was calculated from the amino acid composition of the six human α(IV)NC1 domains (20Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5060) Google Scholar). Recombinant α3(IV)NC1 expressed in kidney 293 cells and E. coli was prepared as described (21Sado Y. Boutaud A. Kagawa M.

Kataja M. Hudson B.G. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1987; 69: 332-340PubMed Google Scholar). Human kidneys unsuitable for transplantation were obtained from Midwest Organ Bank, Kansas City, KS. The plasmapheresis fluid or sera from eight patients diagnosed with Goodpasture syndrome (GP1–8) were used. The titer of GP autoantibodies was measured by direct ELISA in plates (Nunc) coated with α3(IV)NC1 (100 ng/well). Relative to the GP1 serum previously described (24Gunwar S. Ballester F. Kalluri R.

SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar) was performed in 4–20% gradient gels, under non-reducing conditions, using 500 ng of protein per lane. For immunoblotting, the proteins (200 ng of protein/lane) were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, reacted with GP sera (1:100) and alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:1000), then stained with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate and nitro blue tetrazolium. MaxiSorp™ polystyrene microtiter plates (Nunc, Denmark) were coated overnight at room temperature with antigen (50–200 ng/well, as shown) in 50 mm carbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and then blocked with casein or BSA. In some experiments, the antigen was reduced prior to coating by treatment with 10% β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min at 100 °C. GP sera and normal human sera (negative controls) were diluted in the incubation buffer (2% casein or 2 mg/ml BSA and 0.05% Tween 20 in Tris-buffered saline). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (1:2000) was used as secondary antibody. p-Nitrophenol phosphate (1 mg/ml in 1 m diethanolamine buffer, pH 9.8, containing 0.5 mm zinc chloride) was used as substrate, and the development of color was monitored at 410 nm in a Dynatech MR4000 plate reader. For inhibition ELISA, the GP sera were incubated overnight at room temperature with various amounts of recombinant α(IV)NC1 domains or chimeras prior to addition to plates coated with α3(IV)NC1. The results shown are the averages of duplicate determinations. Mapping of linear epitopes was performed using the “PEPSCAN” method (26Geysen H.M. Meloen R.H. Barteling S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 3998-4002Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). A complete set of solid phase overlapping 12-mer peptides was synthesized onto polyethylene pins following the published sequences of NC1 domains of α1(IV) (GenBankTM accession number P02462) and α3(IV) collagen (GenBankTM accession number X80031). The immunoscreening of these peptides was performed by ELISA. The pins were incubated for 1 h with GP serum (diluted 1:50) and then washed three times. The bound antibody was detected by the reaction with peroxidase-labeled secondary antibody for 30 min, followed by color development with 2,2′-azinobis-3-ethylbenzthiazolinesulfonic acid for another 30 min. In this study, α1/α3 chimeras were used to identify theconformational epitope(s) of the GP autoantigen. This strategy relied on the high sequence homology between the NC1 domains of α1(IV) and α3(IV) collagen (71% sequence identity and six conserved disulfide bonds), which very likely adopt similar tertiary structures (27Netzer K. Suzuki K. Itoh Y. Hudson B.G. Khalifah R.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). In the chimeras, α1(IV)NC1 acted as an inert “carrier” and provided a three-dimensional scaffold for the substituted α3(IV) sequences. Since GP sera react preferentially with α3(IV)NC1, but not the other α(IV)NC1 domains, the autoepitope(s) must contain amino acids specific to α3(IV)NC1. Our recent comparative analysis of the sequences of α(IV)NC1 domains has now permitted the identification of six putative locations of the epitope(s) as short regions (less than 15 residues) in α3(IV)NC1 that are most divergent from other α(IV)NC1 domains and that are also predicted to be accessible to solvent (27Netzer K. Suzuki K. Itoh Y. Hudson B.G. Khalifah R.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Accordingly, six chimeric NC1 domains (C1–C6) were constructed in which these α3(IV)NC1 sequences replaced the corresponding amino acids within the α1(IV)NC1 domain (Fig. 2). Five combination chimeras (C1·2, C1·4,C2·6, C3·5, C1·2·5) were also constructed to allow identification of non-contiguous GP epitopes. To analyze two previously proposed GP epitopes (11Kalluri R. Gunwar S. Reeders S.T. Morrison K.C. Mariyama M. Ebner K.E. Noelken M.E. Hudson B.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24018-24024Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Kalluri R. Sun M.J.

Biochem. 1995; 229: 754-760Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) using this approach, three additional chimeras (C7, C8, andC7·8) were constructed. The 26 amino-terminal amino acids of C7 chimera, which included four collagenous Gly-X-Y triplets, were from the α3(IV) sequence.C8 contained the 36 carboxyl-terminal residues of α3(IV)NC1 and, in addition, had two α1(IV) Gly-X-Ytriplets at the amino terminus. The additional Gly-X-Ysequences, also present in the native collagenase-digested α1- and α3(IV)NC1 domains, were incorporated in the C7 andC8 chimeras to emulate the proteins previously used to map the autoepitope (15Kalluri R.

The recombinant chimeric proteins were expressed in the human embryonic kidney 293 cells and isolated from the culture medium as monomers with an apparent molecular mass of about 25–30 kDa by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3 a). Unlike expression in E. coli (22Neilson E.G. Kalluri R. Sun M.J. Gunwar S. Danoff T. Mariyama M. Myers J.C. Reeders S.T. Hudson B.G. J. Biol.

Boutaud, S. Gunwar, N. Singh, K.-O. Netzer, Y. Sado, Y. Ninomiya, M. E. Noelken, and B. G. Hudson, manuscript in preparation. This cell line has been successfully used to express other proteins with native folding, including basement membrane proteins nidogen (29Fox J.W. Mayer U. Nischt R. Aumailley M. Reinhardt D.

Yamada Y. O'Rear J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10189-10194Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The reactivity of the chimeric constructs with GP sera was analyzed by Western blotting as well as by direct and inhibition ELISA. The pattern of autoantibody binding obtained in Western blots with three sera show remarkable similarities (Fig. 3, b–d). Only two chimeras,C2 and C6 (containing residues 17–31 and 127–141 of α3(IV)NC1, respectively), reacted strongly and consistently with GP antibodies, as did combination chimeras containing one or both these regions (C1·2, C2·6,C1·2·5). Some sera showed weak reactivity with other chimeras, but this appears to be due to the cross-reactivity with the α1 backbone, because it was accompanied by comparable binding to α1(IV)NC1. Remarkably, neither C7 nor C8chimeras bound autoantibodies. To confirm these findings, the binding of eight GP sera to immobilized chimeras was assessed in direct ELISA (Fig.4). Sera were diluted proportionally to their titers to allow visualization of the specificity of the low titer sera side by side with the high titer sera. In general, the pattern of reactivity observed in the Western blots was also apparent in the ELISA. All sera reacted strongly with C2 chimera (which averaged 71% of the maximal reactivity, obtained with α3(IV)NC1), C1·2 (47%), C2·6 (70%), andC1·2·5 (64%). There was more variation in the reactivity toward C6 chimera (31% of the reactivity of α3(IV)NC1), which bound significantly only five out of eight sera. All but one low titer serum (GP7) bound more to C2than to C6 chimera. Sera that showed cross-reactivity with α1(IV)NC1 bound all chimeras, producing a higher background. The relative reactivity of any given serum toward recombinant proteins was not influenced by the dilution of the serum. This was apparent in the titration curves shown in Fig. 5, which yielded parallel lines for various immobilized proteins. Similar results were obtained with the other sera. All sera had the highest reactivity toward α3(IV)NC1, which was closely followed byC2·6 and C2 chimeras (less than a 2-fold difference in titers). The C6 chimera titers of the sera were more variable, between 2- and 10-fold lower than the α3(IV)NC1 titers, but always higher than those of α1(IV)NC1 and α2(IV)NC1 controls. It is well established that adsorption of proteins to plastic may cause denaturation, so that the antibody binding measured in direct ELISA may actually be to the denatured antigen. To rule out such artifacts, the interaction between the GP antibodies and antigen was studied in solution by inhibition ELISA in the presence of soluble chimeras and control α(IV)NC1 domains. The inhibition curves were determined for three GP sera and were found to be similar. Typical data for one serum are shown in Fig.6 (top panel). The inhibitory capacity of the chimeras and the control proteins followed the same order as found in direct ELISA, α3(IV)NC1 >C2·6 > C2 > C6 > α1(IV)NC1, consistent with the results obtained with the latter technique. The effect of the chimeras was saturable, leveling off at the highest concentration used, where it produced 42–67% inhibition, a significant proportion of the autoantibody reactivity. The α3(IV)NC1 domain could completely inhibit autoantibody binding and had an I50 (the concentration of competitor at which half-maximal inhibition is achieved) of 0.27 ± 0.03 μg/ml (about 11 nm), in good agreement with the previously reported values of 0.5 (31Hellmark T. Johansson C. Wieslander J. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 823-829Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and 0.8 μg/ml (9Hellmark T. Brunmark C. Trojnar J. Wieslander J. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 105: 504-510Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). At high concentrations, α1(IV)NC1 but not α2(IV)NC1 inhibited autoantibody binding to α3(IV)NC1 by about 24%. This effect can be attributed to cross-reactivity, since α3(IV)NC1 is more similar to the α1- and α5(IV)NC1 domains than to α2-, α4-, or α6(IV)NC1 domains (27Netzer K. Suzuki K. Itoh Y. Hudson B.G. Khalifah R.G. Protein Sci. 1998; 7: 1340-1351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). An I50 value could not be reliably calculated for chimeras because the inhibition curves they produced could not be fitted adequately to a simple inhibition model. Visual examination of these curves revealed a bi-phasic behavior. The steep inhibition below 2 μg/ml (Fig. 6, top panel) is probably due to the specific α3(IV) sequence in the chimeras, whereas the shallower portion of the curves at higher chimera concentrations, which parallels the α1(IV)NC1 inhibition curve, is likely caused by cross-reactivity with the α1(IV)NC1 scaffolding. To quantitate the binding specificity of eight GP sera, an inhibition ELISA was performed at a fixed concentration of soluble antigen, 10 μg/ml (Fig. 6, bottom panel). This concentration was chosen to minimize cross-reactivity with α1(IV), while giving almost complete inhibition with α3(IV)NC1. Inhibition with C2·6was 65 ± 13%, compared with 85 ± 7% for control α3(IV)NC1, demonstrating that this chimera contains the immunodominant autoepitope(s) of α3(IV)NC1. C2·6 chimera had a stronger effect than either C2 (46 ± 8%) orC6 chimeras (23 ± 18%). This indicates that the α3(IV)NC1 residues 17–31 (hereafter referred to asE A) and 127–141 (hereafter referred to asE B) form either two separate epitopes or a single, more complete one, but it appears to rule out significant cross-reactivity between the two homologous sequences. The data were further analyzed to estimate the fraction of autoreactivity that could be attributed specifically to the α3(IV)NC1 sequences in the chimeras. For each serum, the inhibition produced by the α1(IV)NC1 domain (which averaged 7 ± 4%) was subtracted from the total inhibition given by the chimeras to correct for the cross-reactivity due to the common scaffold, and then the results were normalized to the effect produced by α3(IV)NC1 (TableII). The effect ofEA (present in C2 chimera) was strong and consistent (on average 47%, ranging between 27 and 64%) and predominated in seven out of eight sera. In contrast,EB (present"

A major phosphorylation event that occurs with cyclic nucleotide-dependent relaxation of vascular smooth muscle is an increase in the phosphorylation of two 20-kDa proteins (isoform 3, pI 5.9; and 8, pI 5.7) (1Takuwa Y.

In addition, HSP20 can be phosphorylated in vitro by both cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) (4Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HSP20 is also phosphorylated during endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation of isolated segments of bovine carotid artery smooth muscle (5Jerius H. Karolyi D. Mondy J.S. Beall A. Wooton D. Ku D. Cable S. Brophy C.M. J. Vasc. Surg. 1999; 29: 678-684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). In a vascular smooth muscle, umbilical artery smooth muscle, that is refractory to cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation, there is no significant increase in the phosphorylation of HSP20 in response to activation of PKA or PKG (2Berg C. Brophy C.M. Dransfield D. Lincoln T.M. Goldenring J. Rasmussen H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H202-H212PubMed Google Scholar). HSP20 is present in umbilical artery smooth muscle and can be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro using homogenates of umbilical smooth muscle (6Brophy C.M. Beall A. Lamb S. Dickinson M. Ware D.J. Biol. Reprod. 1997; 57: 1354-1359Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data support a role for phosphorylated HSP20 in mediating cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation. Histamine and phorbol ester-induced contractions of bovine carotid artery smooth muscle are associated with an increase in the phosphorylation of another 20-kDa protein (isoform 4, pI 6.0) (1Takuwa Y. Kelley G. Takuwa N. Rasmussen H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 60: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The subsequent activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways leads to a decrease in the phosphorylation of isoform 4. This 20-kDa protein is immunoreactive with specific polyclonal antibodies raised against HSP20 (4Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Thus, increases in the phosphorylation of this isoform of HSP20 are associated with smooth muscle contraction and decreases are associated with activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways. The purpose of this investigation was to determine the specific site on the HSP20 molecule that is phosphorylated during cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation. We demonstrated that Ser16 is the site phosphorylated on HSP20 by PKA or PKG. We then prepared peptides in which the Ser16 site was altered and determined whether these peptides altered the contractile responses of transiently permeabilized vascular smooth muscle. Human skeletal muscle HSP20 was purified as described previously (7Kato K. Goto G. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and modified trypsin, sequence grade, was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI). Hepes was obtained from American Bioanalytical (Natick, MA). Urea, SDS, glycine, and Tris were from Research Organics (Cleveland, OH). Coomassie Brilliant Blue was from ICN Biomedicals Inc (Aurora, OH). [γ-32P]ATP and [32P]orthophosphate were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech.

Piperazine diacrylamide and other electrophoresis reagents were from Bio-Rad. CHAPS, EGTA, EDTA, polyoxyethylene-sorbitan monolaurate (Tween 20) and all other reagent grade chemicals were from Sigma. Purified cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) was obtained from Dr. Tom Lincoln (University of Alabama, Birmingham, AL). Polyclonal antibodies against HSP20 were produced as described previously (7Kato K. Goto G. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), against αB crystallin were from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), and antibodies against myotonic kinase binding protein (MKBP) were from Dr. Atsushi Suzuki (Yokohama, Japan). Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies were from Jackson ImmunocResearch (West Grove, PA). Protein concentrations were determined using the Coomassie Plus Protein Assay Reagent (Pierce). Intact bovine carotid arteries were obtained from an abattoir (Shapiro's meatpackers, Augusta, GA). Human aortic tissues were obtained from organ donors with approval from the Medical College of Georgia Institutional Review Board. The adventitia was dissected from the arteries, and the endothelial lining was denuded with a cotton-tipped applicator. The arteries were opened longitudinally, and thin transverse strips were cut. Vessel viability was determined by concurrent muscle bath experiments as described previously (2Berg C. Brophy C.M. Dransfield D. Lincoln T.M. Goldenring J. Rasmussen H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H202-H212PubMed Google Scholar). HSP20 was phosphorylated in a reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 100 nm of the catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase or 100 nm of cGMP-dependent protein kinase. For experiments using PKG, the peptide inhibitor of PKA (PKI, 1 μm, final concentration), was added. The reaction was initiated with the addition of 200 μm[γ-32P]ATP (800 cpm/pmol) and incubated for 30 min at 30 °C. The reaction was stopped by the addition (1:1, v:v) of 6.25 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 2% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol, 0.025% bromphenol blue and boiled for 5 min. The proteins were separated on 15% polyacrylamide/SDS gels, fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, and stained with Neuhoff's Coomassie stain (10% ammonium sulfate, 2.4% phosphoric acid, 0.1% Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 20% methanol) (8Neuhoff V. Arould N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar). Strips of bovine carotid artery smooth muscle were incubated in 150 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mmMgSO4, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 10 mm glucose, 1.5 mm CaCl2, and 25 mm Na2HCO3 and oxygenated with with 95% O2, 5% CO2 at 37 °C for 4 h. The muscle strips were then stimulated with serotonin (1 μm) for 10 min and then IBMX (1 mm) and forskolin (10 μm) for 10 min, phorbol dibutyrate (1 nm–1 μm) for 45 min, or phorbol dibutyrate (1 μm) for 45 min followed by forskolin (10 μm) for 10 min. The vessels were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle, and resuspended in 90% acetone, 10% trichloroacetic acid, 10 mm dithiothreitol. The suspension was quickly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then allowed to return to room temperature. The suspension was centrifuged (10,000 × g) and washed three times in acetone. The pellets were dried under a stream of nitrogen and solubilized in 9 m urea, 2% CHAPS, and 100 mm dithiothreitol overnight at room temperature. The isolated phosphoproteins were separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis using the method of O'Farrell (9O'Farrell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 4007-4021Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified by Hoschstrasser et al. (10Hochstrasser D.F. Harrington M.G. Hochstrasser A.C. Miller M.J. Merril C.R. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 173: 424-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). In brief, 5 mg of protein was loaded onto 12 × 15-cm slab isofocusing gels consisting of 4% acrylamide, 0.1% piperazine diacrylamide, 9 m urea, 5% ampholines (5 parts 6–8, 3 parts 5–7, and 2 parts 3–10), and 2% CHAPS. Temed (0.04%) and ammonium persulfate (0.1%) were used to initiate polymerization. The cathode buffer consisted of 20 mm sodium hydroxide and the anode buffer 10 mm phosphoric acid. The proteins were focused for 10,000 V h. The gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid and stained with Neuhoff's Coomassie stain (8Neuhoff V. Arould N. Taube D. Ehrhardt W. Electrophoresis. 1988; 9: 255-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar), and the lanes of stained proteins were cut from the isofocusing slab gels and equilibrated in 10 mm Tris (pH 6.8), 3% SDS, 19% ethanol, 4% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.004% bromphenol blue for 10 min. The proteins were then separated on 12% acrylamide SDS gels (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar). The gels were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid, stained with Neuhoff's Coomassie stain, and the spots corresponding to the specific isoforms of HSP20 were excised from the gels. The gel pieces containing the specific isoforms of HSP20 were digested by the in gel tryptic digest method of Hellman et al. (11Hellman U.C. Wernstedt J. Gonez J. Heldin C.H. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 224: 451-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (686) Google Scholar). In brief, the gel pieces were destained in 40% methanol and washed in 0.2m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.9), 50% acetonitrile. The gel pieces were then dried under a stream of nitrogen and reconstituted in 0.2 m ammonium bicarbonate (pH 8.9), 50% acetonitrile, 0.02% Tween 20. The proteins were digested with the addition of 0.5 μg of trypsin for 12 h. The proteolytic fragments were extracted with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The peptides were separated with reverse phase narrow-bore liquid chromatography on a C-18 column using a 260-min gradient of 0–40% acetonitrile in 0.065 to 0.05% trifluoroacetic acid at a flow rate of 100 μl/min. with the Smart System (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). 50-μl fractions were collected and counted in a scintillation counter. Peptides from the Smart system were applied to a ProSorb membrane (Perkin-Elmer and Applied Biosystems) as per the manufacturers' directions. The peptides were sequenced on a Procise (Applied Biosystems, model 492) instrument using standard protocols. Peptide mapping was performed according to the method of Cleveland et al. (12Cleveland D.W. Fischer S.G. Kirschner M.W. Laemmli U.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 252: 1102-1106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A strip of a two-dimensional gel containing isoforms 8, 4, and 3 was rehydrated with 125 mm Tris, 1% SDS (pH 6.8) for 1 h. The rehydrated gel piece was placed on top of a 15% SDS-PAGE gel and overlaid with 10 μg of Staphylococcus aureus V8 protease in 125 mm Tris, 1% SDS, 15% glycerol (pH 6.8). The gel was run at 150 V until the dye front reached the end of the gel. The gels were stained, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR-5 film. Peptide synthesis was conducted on an Applied Biosystems model 433A peptide synthesizer using standard Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) chemistry. The synthesis of the phosphopeptides involved an increase in coupling times of 20 min. The phosphorylated amino acid derivatives were purchased from Calbiochem. Peptide purity was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography. Phosphopeptides were analyzed by mass spectrometry. The synthetic peptide, WLRRASPLPGLK (S denotes phosphoserine), conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (0.5 mg) was injected subcutaneously into two rabbits in collaboration with Babco (Berkeley, CA). The rabbit serum was tested with an ELISA using the synthetic peptide. A titer that extinguished at a dilution of 1:10,000 was obtained, and this serum was affinity purified using AminoLink® Plus Immobilization Kit (Pierce). The serum was first applied to a column linked with 5 mg of the non-phosphorylated peptide (EIPVPVPQPSW LRRASAPLPGLK). The eluted serum was then applied to a column linked with 5 mg of the phosphorylated peptide (WLRRASPLPGLK, where S indicates phosphorylated serine). Fractions (1 ml) were collected and neutralized with 50 μl of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0). The fractions were analyzed in a spectrophotometer, and the 280-nm peak fractions were combined and used for Western blots at a dilution of 1:100. The rat cDNA for HSP20 (13Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Kato K. Nishida Y. Gene (Amst.). 1996; 178: 145-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) was polymerase chain reaction-amplified using sense (GAA TTC ATA TGG AGA TCC GGG TGC CTG TGC) and antisense (CGT ACT CGA GCT ACT TGG CAG CAG GTG GTG ACT) primers (synthesized by Life Technologies, Inc.). The polymerase chain reaction products were ligated into pCR-script SK(+) cloning vector and transformed into Escherichia colisupercompetent cells according to the manufacturer's directions (pCR-Script SK(+) Cloning Kit, Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Plasmid minipreps were performed with the Wizard miniprep DNA purification system (Promega, Madison, WI) using appropriate colonies from the transformed E. coli. The isolated DNA was then sequenced using an Applied Biosystems Prism automatic DNA sequencer. The plasmid was then cut with Xho-1, isolated on a 1% agarose gel, and inserted into a pET-19b plasmid and transformed into E. coli JM109 cells (Promega, Madison, WI), and plasmid preparations were performed as above. The plasmids were then transformed into BL21(DE3)pLysS cells, and appropriate colonies were then inoculated into LB broth (containing carbenicillin and chloramphenicol) and grown for approximately 2.5 h at 37 °C. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation 2500 × g for 10 min, and the HSP20 was affinity purified using a HIS-bind resin column (Novagen, Madison, WI). Proteins from the fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE gels (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar), and fractions containing a single band at 20 kDa were dialyzed against decreasing concentrations of urea (6 m urea, 1% Triton to 0m urea, 1% Triton) in phosphate-buffered saline. Finally, the HSP20 was dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline, 1% CHAPS. The proteins were separated on 15% SDS-PAGE gels (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207211) Google Scholar) and transferred to Immobilon for 210 V h. The blots were air-dried and subsequently blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS: 10 mm Tris, 150 mm NaCl (pH 7.4)), 5% milk for 1 h. The blots were then incubated with anti-HSP20 antibodies in TBS/milk for 1 h at room temperature. The blots were washed 3 times (5 min each) in TBS/Tween 20 (0.5%). Immunoreactive protein was determined using 125I-protein A. The blots were again washed 6 times (5 min each) in TBS/Tween 20. The blots were then exposed on a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) screen for 18 h. In other experiments the amount of immunoreactive protein was determined using enhanced chemiluminescence (NEN Life Science Products). Phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated recombinant HSP20 were diluted in borate buffer (100 mm boric acid, 25 mmNa2B4O7, 75 mm NaCl (pH 8.5)), and 100 μl was added to each well of Dynatec Immulon 2 plates (Fisher). The plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C and washed 3 times with wash buffer (10 mm Tris, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 8.0)). The plates were blocked with borate buffer, 1% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature and again washed three times. The plates were incubated with the affinity purified phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (1:1000 dilution) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were again washed three times and subsequently incubated with anti-rabbit antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (Promega, Madison, WI) for 2 h at room temperature. The plates were washed three times and developed with alkaline phosphatase substrate (Sigma 104 phosphatase substrate). The optical density was read at 405 nm. Fine strips of bovine carotid artery smooth muscle (0.1 mm wide × 8 mm long) were cut with a razor blade under a dissecting microscope and permeabilized using a protocol that has been modified to introduce the 21-kDa photoprotein, aequorin (15Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. 1982; 395: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 351: 155-167Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar, 17Takuwa Y. Rasmussen H. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Rosales O.R. Isales C.M. Barrett P.Q. Brophy C. Sumpio B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The strips were washed 3 times in stripping solution, 25 mm Hepes, 120 mm KCl, 5.6 mm glucose, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 3 mm EGTA and then incubated in stripping solution for 30 min at room temperature while gently shaken. The strips were then incubated in the stripping solution with the specific peptides for another 30 min on ice. Calcium was added directly to the solution in three increments, 5 min apart to a final concentration of 1 mm. It has been determined that a 13-kDa molecule with a radioactive tag is not released after this protocol (18Rosales O.R. Isales C.M. Barrett P.Q. Brophy C. Sumpio B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) suggesting that the cell membranes regain their integrity. The strips were tied under magnification at each end with a 7–0 prolene suture (Johnson and Johnson, Cincinatti, OH) and suspended in a muscle bath in Hepes solution (10 mm Hepes, 140 mm NaCl, 4.7 mm KCl, 1.0 mm MgSO4, 1.0 mm NaH2PO4, 1.0 mmCaCl2, 10 mm glucose (pH 7.4)) at room temperature. The muscle strips were placed under 0.5 g of tension and allowed to relax to a basal tension over 15 min. The strips were fixed at one end to a stainless steel wire and attached to a Kent Scientific (Litchfield, CT) force transducer (TRN001) interfaced with a Data Translation A-D board, DT2801 (Data Translation, Inc., Marlboro, MA). Data were acquired with Lab Tech Notebook software (Laboratory Technologies Corp., Wilmington, MA). Agonists were added directly to the bath. The peptides (200 μg) were phosphorylated in a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 20 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 10 mm magnesium acetate, 5 mm K2PO4, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, 6 units (15 nm) of the catalytic subunit of PKA. The reactions were initiated with the addition of 200 μm [γ-32P]ATP (800 cpm/pmol) and incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, terminated by spotting 20-μl aliquots onto phosphocellulose papers (Whatman P81). The papers were washed three times in ice-cold 75 mm phosphoric acid, rinced in acetone, and allowed to air dry. The papers were counted in a scintillation counter (Beckman, Irving, CA). Values are reported as mean ± S.E., andn refers to the number of animals examined. The statistical difference between the two groups was determined with Student'st test and between multiple groups with one-way repeated measures analysis of variance using Sigma Stat software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafeal, CA). A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. Densitometric analysis was performed with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) and ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Phosphorylation of purified rat skeletal muscle HSP20 with the catalytic subunit of PKA resulted in two proteolytic fractions that contained radioactive counts (Fig.1). The amino acid sequence obtained from the major proteolytic fragment (peak 1, fraction 19) wasXAXXPLPGLSAPGGRRQ and that from the minor fragment (peak 2, fractions 27 and 28) was APSVALPVAQVPTDPG. These peptides displayed significant homology with the known amino acid sequence of human HSP20 (fraction 19, 70% homology, and fraction 27/28, 100% homology) (7Kato K. Goto G. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fragment from peak 1 had a PKA consensus sequence (RRAS) corresponding to Ser16 on the HSP20 molecule. The fragment from peak 2 had a less suitable PKA consensus sequence (RAPS) corresponding to Ser59 on the HSP20 molecule. Phosphorylation of purified rat skeletal muscle HSP20 with PKG resulted in one fraction that contained the majority of the radioactive counts. This fraction had a similar mobility on the column as the major peak obtained after phosphorylation with PKA (fraction 19). Peptide analysis was not performed on this fraction. To determine the sites on the HSP20 molecule that are phosphorylated when intact strips of muscle are stimulated with substances that activate cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways, strips of bovine carotid artery smooth muscle were incubated with [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with forskolin (10 μm) and isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX, 1 mm) for 10 min. This combination of an adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, and a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, IBMX, led to the maximal phosphorylation of HSP20 (data not shown). The proteins were separated with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Autoradiography revealed two 20-kDa spots that were immunoreactive with antibodies against HSP20 (Fig. 2, immunoblots not shown). The protein that had been previously described as isoform “3” with a pI of 5.9 was digested, and the proteolytic fragments were separated by reversed phase fast protein liquid chromatography. The peak of radioactivity was again in fraction 19, with a minor component of counts in fractions 27 and 28 (Fig. 2 B). The proteolytic fragment from fraction 19 contained the amino acid sequence RAXXXLPGLSAPGX. This sequence had 100% homology to the known sequence of human HSP20 and with the peptide isolated from fraction 19 after the in vitro phosphorylation of the purified HSP20. The RAXX likely represents RAS corresponding to Ser16 on the HSP20 molecule that was phosphorylated by PKA. We were unable to resolve the proteolytic fragment from fractions 27/28 for sequence analysis. The proteolytic fragment with the peak amount of radioactivity from isoform “8” (pI of 5.7) was again in fraction 19 (Fig. 2 C). The proteolytic fragment from fraction 19 contained the amino acid sequence RASAPLPGLSAPGR (100% homology with human HSP20). This peptide again contained the consensus sequence for PKA phosphorylation: RRAS with Ser16representing the phosphorylation site. The proteolytic fragment from fractions 27/28 had a sequence of LPPGVDPAAVTSALSPEG (100% homology with human HSP20), corresponding to the carboxyl terminus of the HSP20 molecule, and contained no consensus sites for PKA or PKG (Fig. 3).Figure 3. Location of the HSP20 phosphorylation sites within the aligned amino acid sequences of human and rat HSP20.The sequences of human and rat HSP20 from Kato et al. (7Kato K. Goto G. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were aligned, and the tryptic digest sites are marked with aslash (/). The amino acid sequences of proteolytic fragments from specific column fractions are underlined. The in situ cAMP-dependent phosphorylation site is marked with a dashed box.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine the phosphorylation site on the isoform with a pI of 6.0 (isoform 4), strips of bovine carotid artery smooth muscle were incubated in the presence of [32P]orthophosphate and stimulated with the phorbol ester, phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu, 1 μm, 45 min), and the proteins were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis. The spot corresponding to isoform 4 was digested, and the proteolytic fragments were separated. The peak of radioactivity was in fractions 27 and 28 (Fig. 2 E), and the peptide sequence from this fraction was RYRLPPGVPPAAVTSAL (94% homology with human HSP20). This sequence is found at the carboxyl terminus of the HSP20 molecule (amino acids 120–137). The chromatographs of the peptides from in vitrophosphorylation of HSP20 with PKA (Fig.4 A) were similar to the chromatographs of isoform 3 after IBMX/FSK treatment (Fig.4 B). The peptide patterns on the chromatographs from isoforms 8 and 4 were also similar (Fig. 4, C andD). However, there were differences between the peptide patterns from isoform 3 and isoforms 4 and 8. Finally, phosphopeptide mapping of a strip of gel containing all three isoforms demonstrated that there were phosphorylated peptides unique to isoforms 4 and 8 (Fig. 4, E and F). Affinity purified phosphorylation state-specific antibodies for phosphorylated HSP20 recognized only isoforms 3 and 8 of HSP20 that were phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 5). On the other hand, a purified polyclonal antibody (7Kato K. Goto G. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) recognized all isoforms of HSP20 including non-phosphorylated HSP20. To determine the sensitivity of the phosphorylation state-specific antibodies, recombinant HSP20 was phosphorylated in vitro by the catalytic subunit of PKA. The phosphorylation state-specific antibodies recognized 3–100 ng of phosphorylated HSP20 in an ELISA (Fig. 6). By Western blotting, the antibodies recognized 1–10 μg of phosphorylated HSP20 in a linear fashion (Fig. 6). To determine the specificity of the phosphorylation state-specific antibodies for HSP20 in intact tissues, homogenates of bovine carotid artery smooth muscles (30 μg of protein) were treated with buffer alone (control), sodium nitroprusside (10 μm, 10 min), or forskolin (10 μm, 10 min) and then separated on SDS-PAGE and transferred to Immobilon. The blots were probed with the phosphorylation state-specific antibodies and subsequently re-probed with affinity purified polyclonal antibodies that recognize all isoforms of HSP20 (7Kato K. Goto G. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity purified phosphorylation state-specific antibodies recognized a band at a relative mobility of 20 kDa in the sodium nitroprusside- and forskolin-treated tissues, whereas the affinity purified polyclonal antibody recognized three forms of HSP20 (Fig. 7). The phosphorylation of an additional isoform of HSP20, pI 6.0, (isoform 4), increases with phorbol ester stimulation of carotid artery smooth muscle (1Takuwa Y. Kelley G. Takuwa N. Rasmussen H. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 1988; 60: 71-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of isoform 4 decreases with activation of cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling pathways. Radiolabeled strips of carotid artery smooth muscle were treated with phorbol dibutyrate (PDBu, 100 nm, for 45 min) followed by forskolin (10 μm, for 10 min). The strips were homogenized and the proteins separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon. The blots were exposed to x-ray film (autoradiographs) and subsequently probed with the phosphorylation state-specific affinity purified antibodies. The phosphorylation state-specific antibodies recognized isoforms 3 and 8 but did not recognize isoform 4 (Fig.8 B). The blots were again probed with antibodies that recognize all isoforms of HSP20. Isoforms 3, 4, 8, as well as a nonphosphorylated pool of HSP20 were identified (Fig. 8 C). Finally, the blots were probed with an antibody against another recently identified small heat shock protein myotonic dystrophy-binding protein (19Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). This antibody recognized a 20-kDa protein with a pI of 5.3 that was not phosphorylated in response to PDBu or forskolin treatment (Fig. 8, A and D). This protein does not contain the RRAS16 site (19Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Previous reports have suggested that only isoform 3 of HSP20 was present in human vascular tissue (2Berg C. Brophy C.M. Dransfield D. Lincoln T.M. Goldenring J. Rasmussen H. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: H202-H212PubMed Google Scholar). To determine which isoforms in human aortic tissues are phosphorylated during cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation, strips of human aortic smooth muscle were labeled with [32P]orthophosphate and treated with IBMX (1 mm) and forskolin (10 μm). The strips were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and transferred to Immobilon. Autoradiographs were developed (Fig. 9 A), and the blots were then probed with the phosphorylation state-specific antibodies (Fig. 9 B). Only isoform 3 was phosphorylated after IBMX and forskolin treatment of human aortic smooth muscle. To determine the effect of phosphorylation of HSP20 on smooth muscle physiology, strips of bovine carotid artery smooth muscle were transiently permeabilized and synthetic peptides introduced. The synthetic peptide, WLRRASpPLPGLK, in which Ser16 was phosphorylated, significantly attenuated both KCl (110 mm)- and serotonin (5HT, 1 μm)-induced contractions (Fig. 10). In addition, the synthetic peptide, WLRRAAPLPGLK, in which Ser16 was replaced with an alanine, thus rendering the peptide “nonphosphorylatable” augmented both KCl (110 mm)- and serotonin (5HT, 1 μm)-induced contractions (Fig. 10). The synthetic peptides, WLRRASPLPGLK, in which Ser16 was not phosphorylated, and PRKALWLGRPLA, a peptide containing a random distribution of the amino acids, had no effect on KCl (110 mm)- or serotonin (5HT, 1 μm)-induced contractions (p > 0.05 compared with control (no peptide added) contractions). To determine if the phosphorylation state of the peptides could be modified in vitro, the WLRRASPLPGLK peptide was phosphorylated by the catalytic subunit of PKA. No increase in phosphorylation of the WLRRASPLPGLK peptide (2518 ± 214 base lineversus 3379 ± 315, n = 3,p > 0.05) was observed. However, a larger peptide, EIPVPVQPSWLRRASAPLPGLK, was phosphorylated in vitro by PKA (1258 ± 153 versus 4580 ± 408, n= 3, p < 0.05). The present experiments demonstrate that the small heat shock-related protein, HSP20 is phosphorylated on Ser16during cAMP-dependent vasorelaxation (Fig. 1 and Fig. 2). This serine is contained in a region with a consensus sequence for both PKA and PKG (RRAS). There are three phosphorylated isoforms of HSP20 in bovine carotid artery. Isoforms 3 and 8 are phosphorylated on Ser16 during cAMP-dependent vasorelaxation. Antibodies generated against a peptide containing the Ser16phosphorylation site were both sensitive and specific for phosphorylated HSP20 (Figs. Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7). These antibodies recognized isoforms 3 and 8 but did not recognize isoform 4 (Fig. 8). Only one phosphorylated isoform (isoform 3) was recognized in human vascular tissue with the phosphorylation state-specific antibody (Fig. 9). In addition, another small heat shock protein in muscle, MKBP, is not phosphorylated when muscles are stimulated with PDBu or with IBMX/forskolin (Fig. 8). Although this protein has considerable sequence homology with HSP20, it does not contain the RRAS16 site (19Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that there are species differences in HSP20 isoform expression and that Ser16 is the physiologically relevant phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent vasorelaxation. The isoforms that are phosphorylated after activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin or guanylate cyclase with sodium nitroprusside stimulation have similar mobilities on two-dimensional gels (4Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The peptide maps after proteolytic digestion of the two phosphorylated isoforms of HSP20 with S. aureus V8 protease are similar (4Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The phosphorylation of HSP20 by PKG in vitro resulted in a similar mobility of the phosphorylated peptide on the SMART system as the phosphorylation of HSP20 by PKA in vitro (Fig.1). Finally, the phosphorylation state-specific antibodies recognize the same phosphorylated isoforms in vessels treated with sodium nitroprusside as with forskolin (Fig. 7). These data suggest that HSP20 is phosphorylated on Ser16 after activation of cGMP-dependent signaling pathways. Whereas there are three phosphorylated isoforms of HSP20 in bovine carotid artery smooth muscles, two of the isoforms, 4 and 8, have peptide maps that differ from that of isoform 3 (Fig. 4) suggesting that they may represent proteins that contain different amino acid sequences. The simplest explanation of our present results is that isoform 4 is phosphorylated on a carboxyl-terminal site when agonists induce contraction, and then Ser16 is phosphorylated when PKA is activated. This leads to a shift from isoform 4 to isoform 8. Using the identified phosphorylation site on the HSP20 molecule, peptides corresponding to this site were synthesized. The effects of these peptides on contractile physiology was determined by transiently permeabilizing strips of bovine carotid artery smooth muscle (15Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. Pfluegers Arch. 1982; 395: 75-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 16Morgan J.P. Morgan K.G. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 351: 155-167Crossref Scopus (233) Google Scholar,17Takuwa Y. Rasmussen H. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 18Rosales O.R. Isales C.M. Barrett P.Q. Brophy C. Sumpio B.E. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The introduction of a phosphorylated peptide into carotid artery smooth muscle inhibited both high extracellular potassium and serotonin-induced contractions (Fig. 10). This response is similar to the effect of phosphorylated HSP20 on vascular smooth muscle, it inhibits agonist-induced smooth muscle contraction. This peptide may be inhibiting a HSP20 phosphatase or the peptide may act on the same target as the HSP20 protein. The introduction of a peptide in which the phosphorylated serine was replaced with an alanine enhanced contractile responses (Fig. 10). This peptide may inhibit the phosphorylation of endogenous HSP20 or inhibit the effects of the HSP20 molecule. Peptides that were not phosphorylated or contained a scrambled sequence had no effect on contractile responses. The synthetic peptide could not be phosphorylated by PKA in vitro, suggesting that contractile responses were not altered by phosphorylation of the peptides in the strips of muscle. These data supply direct but incomplete evidence that the phosphorylation of HSP20 may be a critical event in the relaxation of tonic vascular smooth muscle. Heat shock proteins are a group of proteins whose synthesis is induced by heat or other stressors. These proteins are divided into several groups based on molecular weights. The small heat shock proteins (15–30 kDa), αB-crystallin, αA-crystallin, HSP20, HSP27, and the MKBP all share considerable sequence homology (approximately 50%) (19Suzuki A. Sugiyama Y. Hayashi Y. Nyu Yoshida M. Nonaka I. Ishiura S. Arahata K. Ohno S. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 1113-1124Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HSP20 and HSP27 are highly expressed in muscle cells (7Kato K. Goto G. Inaguma Y. Hasegawa K. Morishita R. Asano T. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15302-15309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and both exist in phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms (4Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar, 20Brophy C.M. Woodrum D. Dickinson M. Beall A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1998; 27: 963-969Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The specific physiologic functions of the small heat shock proteins are not known. However, increases in the phosphorylation of HSP27 have been associated with vascular smooth muscle contraction (21Larsen J.K. Yamboliev I.A. Weber L.A. Gerthoffer W.T. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: 930-940PubMed Google Scholar, 22Beall A. Epstein A. Woodrum D. Brophy C.M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 449: 41-49Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 with vascular smooth muscle relaxation (4Beall A.C. Kato K. Goldenring J.R. Rasmussen H. Brophy C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11283-11287Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). HSP27 has also been implicated in stabilizing the actin cytoskeleton (23Lavoie J.N. Lambert H. Hickey E. Weber L.A. Landry J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 505-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar). HSP20 has also been shown to be an actin-binding protein, and the association of HSP20 with actin in vitro is dependent on the phosphorylation state of HSP20 (24Brophy C.M. Lamb S. Graham A. J. Vasc. Surg. 1999; 29: 326-333Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Thus, the small heat shock proteins may be late phase signaling molecules that modulate smooth muscle contractile responses via a direct interaction with specific cytoskeletal and/or contractile elements. In sum, these data suggest that the cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation is associated with increases in the phosphorylation of HSP20 at Ser16. Phosphorylation of HSP20 at Ser16 is not only associated with cyclic nucleotide-dependent vasorelaxation but also inhibits agonist-induced contractile responses.

https://openalex.org/W2035504348,"We investigated the role of arrestins in the trafficking of human α2-adrenergic receptors (α2-ARs) and the effect of receptor trafficking on p42/p44 MAP kinase activation. α2-ARs expressed in COS-1 cells demonstrated a modest level of agonist-mediated internalization, with α2c > α2b > α2a. However, upon coexpression of arrestin-2 (β-arrestin-1) or arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2), internalization of the α2b AR was dramatically enhanced and redistribution of receptors to clathrin coated vesicles and endosomes was observed. Internalization of the α2c AR was selectively promoted by coexpression of arrestin-3, while α2a AR internalization was only slightly stimulated by coexpression of either arrestin. Coexpression of GRK2 had no effect on the internalization of any α2-AR subtype, either in the presence or absence of arrestins. Internalization of the α2b and α2c ARs was inhibited by coexpression of dominant negative dynamin-K44A. However, α2-AR-mediated activation of either endogenous or cotransfected p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase was not affected by either dynamin-K44A or arrestin-3. Moreover, activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase by endogenous epidermal growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, and β2-adrenergic receptors was also unaltered by dynamin-K44A. In summary, our data suggest that internalization of the α2b, α2c, and to a lesser extent α2a ARs, is both arrestin- and dynamin-dependent. However, endocytosis does not appear to be required for α2-adrenergic, epidermal growth factor, lysophosphatidic acid, or β2-adrenergic receptor-mediated p42/p44 MAP kinase activation in COS-1 cells.

Three human α2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) 1The abbreviations used are: α2-AR, α2-adrenergic receptor; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor, GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; p42/p44 MAP kinase, p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20; HA, hemagglutinin.1The abbreviations used are: α2-AR, α2-adrenergic receptor; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; EGF, epidermal growth factor; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor, GRK, G protein-coupled receptor kinase; LPA, lysophosphatidic acid; p42/p44 MAP kinase, p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; TBST, Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20; HA, hemagglutinin. subtypes have been identified, known as α2a, α2b, and α2c, which belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily. A fourth subtype, α2d, has been identified in rat, mouse, and bovine tissues and is considered to be the ortholog of α2a (1Bylund D.B. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 832-839Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar). Although the subtype-specific pharmacological differences, G protein coupling, and desensitization of the α2-ARs have been extensively investigated, there is little information regarding their trafficking after agonist stimulation, in particular the role of arrestins and G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs). Arrestins 2Although a variety of names have been used for the various mammalian arrestins, we propose that the following nomenclature be used based on the order of discovery of the arrestins: arrestin-1 (visual arrestin, S-antigen, 48-kDa protein); arrestin-2 (β-arrestin, β-arrestin-1); arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2, arrestin3, thy-X arrestin); arrestin-4 (C-arrestin, X-arrestin). 2Although a variety of names have been used for the various mammalian arrestins, we propose that the following nomenclature be used based on the order of discovery of the arrestins: arrestin-1 (visual arrestin, S-antigen, 48-kDa protein); arrestin-2 (β-arrestin, β-arrestin-1); arrestin-3 (β-arrestin-2, arrestin3, thy-X arrestin); arrestin-4 (C-arrestin, X-arrestin). have been shown to mediate the desensitization and internalization of G protein-coupled receptors (reviewed in Refs. 2Carman C.V.

Chem. 1998; 273: 18677-18680Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (905) Google Scholar). This is accomplished by binding of arrestins to agonist-activated GPCRs after phosphorylation of receptors by GRKs. Arrestins are recruited to at least 15 different GPCRs after agonist activation, highlighting the critical role of arrestins in receptor turn-off (4Barak L.S. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27497-27500Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). Binding of arrestin results in the physical uncoupling of GPCRs from heterotrimeric G proteins, thus terminating agonist-mediated signaling (5Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Dawson T.M. Codina J.

The α2a AR has been shown to be phosphorylated by GRK2 and GRK3, but not GRK5 or GRK6, whereas the α2c AR does not appear to be a substrate for GRK phosphorylation (7Jewell-Motz E.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18082-18087Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The α2b AR also undergoes agonist-promoted phosphorylation (8Kurose H. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol.

Similarly, the α2a and α2b ARs undergo rapid agonist-mediated desensitization, whereas the α2c AR does not (7Jewell-Motz E.A. Liggett S.B. J. Biol.

In several different cell types, the α2a and α2b ARs have been shown to localize initially to the plasma membrane (10von Zastrow M. Link R. Daunt D. Barsh G. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 763-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 11Wozniak M. Limbird L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5017-5024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). However, a significant proportion of the α2c AR appears to be intracellular, accumulating in both the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (10von Zastrow M. Link R. Daunt D. Barsh G. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 763-766Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In HEK-293 cells, the α2b AR has been shown to traffic to endosomes upon agonist stimulation, similar to the classic pattern of internalization observed with the β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR) (12Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In contrast, the α2a AR appears to undergo little or no agonist-mediated redistribution (12Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). However, in Chinese hamster ovary cells, internalization of the α2a AR was significantly greater (13Eason M.G. Liggett S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25473-25479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), which may be attributed to cell type-specific differences in regulatory proteins or in differences between the methods used to quantitate internalization. Recently, in vitro arrestin binding to the third intracellular loop of the α2a AR has been reported, suggesting that arrestins have the ability to interact with the α2a AR (14Wu G. Krupnick J.G. Benovic J.L. Lanier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 17836-17842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Analysis of α2c AR trafficking is complicated by the sizable pool of intracellular receptors. However, using multiple epitope tags and labeling of cell surface receptors, Daunt et al. observed agonist-promoted internalization of the plasma membrane-localized α2c AR in HEK-293 cells, but did not detect redistribution of the intracellular pool of α2c AR (12Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). In the present study, we investigated the role of arrestins and GRKs in the agonist-mediated trafficking of the different α2-AR subtypes. Since the different α2-ARs display clear differences with respect to their intracellular localization and trafficking, they constitute an interesting receptor family in which to investigate the role of GRKs and arrestins in these processes. Furthermore, endocytosis has recently been suggested to be important in the GPCR-mediated activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase (15Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Therefore, the α2-AR family should also be useful to further explore a potential link between endocytosis and MAP kinase activation. In the present work, we used COS-1 cells to study the role of GRKs and arrestins in α2 AR trafficking, since COS cells have been shown to contain low endogenous levels of GRKs and arrestins (16Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). We show that expression of arrestins, but not GRKs, differentially mediates the trafficking of the different α2-AR subtypes. However, expression of wild-type arrestins or dominant negative dynamin-K44A had no effect on activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase by either α2-ARs or endogenous EGF, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), or β2-adrenergic receptors in COS-1 cells.

A Flag epitope was created by PCR amplification of a HindIII/NcoI fragment from pcDNA3-Flag-β2AR. This fragment encodes a 23-amino acid amino-terminal peptide, which permits membrane targeting and processing to expose an epitope that is recognized by both the M1 and M2 Flag antibodies. The amino acid sequence of this region is: MKTIIASYIFCLVFADYKDDDDA. In order to introduce epitope tags at the amino terminus of each of the α2-ARs, the full-length α2a and α2c ARs were digested withNcoI and SalI and ligated with the PCR-amplifiedHindIII/NcoI fragment (containing the Flag epitope) and pBC (from pBC-Flag-β2AR) that was digested with HindIII/SalI. The 5′ region that resulted from the PCR reaction was confirmed by dideoxy sequencing. The Flag-tagged α2c and α2a ARs in pBC were digested with SalI, blunted with Klenow, then digested withHindIII to release the insert. This insert was then ligated with pcDNA3 that had been digested with HindIII andEcoRV. To construct pcDNA3-Flag-α2bAR, the pBC-based α2b AR, which has three internal NcoI sites, was restricted with SfiI, which cleaves at an internal 5′SfiI site, and HindIII. A 40-base pair double-stranded overlapping oligonucleotide was then designed to reconstruct the region from the NcoI site at the initiating methionine to the SfiI site. TheHindIII/NcoI Flag fragment, the 40-base pairNcoI/SfiI fragment, and theSfiI/HindIII α2b AR fragment were then ligated together with HindIII-digested pBluescript KS (Stratagene). The Flag-tagged α2b AR was then digested with HindIII to liberate the insert, blunted with Klenow, and subcloned into pcDNA3 that was digested with EcoRV. The plasmids pcDNA3-arrestin-2, pcDNA3-arrestin-3, pcDNA3-GRK2-CT (containing residues 495–689 of GRK2), and pcDNA3-dynamin-K44A have been described previously (20Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F.

Silvio Gutkind (National Institutes of Health), and RasN17 was a gift from Jonathan Chernoff (Fox Chase Cancer Center). COS-1 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin. COS-1 cells were grown in 60-mm or 100-mm dishes (Falcon) at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO2. Cells were grown to 80–90% confluence prior to transfection. Cells were transfected using FuGENE-6 reagent (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's protocol. For transfection of 60-mm dishes, 10 μl of FuGENE-6 was used, and 30 μl of FuGENE-6 was used to transfect 100-mm dishes. Cells were incubated with FuGENE-DNA mixture for 5 h, after which the cells were split into 12-well dishes (for p42/p44 MAP kinase assays) or 24-well dishes (for ELISA). All assays were performed 24 h after transfection. Internalization of α2-ARs was assessed by ELISA essentially as described by Daunt et al. (12Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Briefly, transfected cells in either 60-mm or 100-mm dishes were split into 24-well dishes coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-l-lysine (Sigma). 24 h after transfection, cells were treated with or without 100 μm(−)-epinephrine in DMEM containing 0.3 mm ascorbate, then fixed for 5 min with 3.7% formaldehyde. The primary anti-Flag antibody M1 (Sigma or IBI) and the secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Bio-Rad), were used at a 1:1000 dilution. Visualization of antibody binding was performed using an alkaline phosphatase substrate kit (Bio-Rad). Plates were read at 405 nm in a microplate reader driven by Microplate Manager software (Bio-Rad). COS-1 cells in 60-mm dishes were transfected as described above with 3 μg of the different Flag-tagged α2-ARs and 1 μg of the indicated arrestin-3 construct. Following transfection, cells were split and allowed to adhere overnight on glass coverslips grown in 24-well dishes. To visualize cell surface receptors, cells were incubated with M1 antibody diluted 1:500 for 1 h at 4 °C in DMEM supplemented with 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Cells were then treated with 100 μm(−)-epinephrine for 10 min, washed, fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.05% Triton X-100 for 10 min, and incubated with goat anti-mouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:200 dilution). Coverslips were mounted using Slow-Fade mounting medium (Molecular Probes) and examined by microscopy on a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope using a Plan Fluor 40× objective. Cells expressing the lowest levels of transiently expressed proteins, but clearly above those of nonexpressing cells, were chosen for view. Images were collected using QED Camera software and processed with Adobe Photoshop version 3.0. COS-1 cells in 100-mm dishes were transfected as described above, then split into 12-well dishes and serum-starved overnight in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum. After agonist stimulation, cells were rapidly rinsed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed by addition of 100 μl of SDS sample buffer. Samples were heated to 95 °C for 10 min, and proteins (20 μl) were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose and blocked for 30 min in blocking buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST) containing 5% nonfat dry milk. To detect p42/p44 MAP kinase activation, blots were incubated in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C with a polyclonal rabbit antibody (New England Biolabs) that specifically recognizes the amino acids (Thr-202/Tyr-204) that are phosphorylated upon activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase (diluted 1:1000). The following day, blots were washed three times with TBST, then incubated with goat-anti rabbit horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) diluted 1:2000 in blocking buffer for 1 h. Blots were then washed three times in TBST and developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). COS-1 cells were transfected with HA-ERK-2 and the indicated α2-AR and either dynamin-K44A or pcDNA3. Cells were serum-starved in DMEM containing 0.5% fetal bovine serum overnight. Cells were stimulated with specific agonists as indicated in the figure legends, washed once with phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 1 mm sodium fluoride, 1 μg/ml leupeptin). Cells were scraped off the plates and sonicated twice using a Fisher model 550 sonic dismembrator set at 2 for 15 s each. All subsequent manipulations were performed on ice or at 4 °C with constant rocking on a platform rocker. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 13,000 rpm in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge. The supernatant was precleared for 1 h to reduce nonspecific binding by addition of 25 μl of protein G-agarose (Boehringer Mannheim). Samples were then centrifuged in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge at 3000 rpm for 2 min and 3 μl of monoclonal anti-HA antibody (unpurified mouse ascites, Babco) was added to the supernatant for 3 h. 50 μl of protein G-agarose was then added, and the samples were incubated overnight. The next day, protein G-antibody-antigen complexes were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with cold lysis buffer. The final pellet was resuspended in 45 μl of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 10 min at 95 °C. 20 μl was electrophoresed on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and the gel was transferred to nitrocellulose. Activated HA-p42 was detected using the phosphorylation state-specific p42/p44 antibodies as described above. To investigate the role of arrestins and GRKs in trafficking of α2-ARs, we initially assessed the internalization of the three human α2-AR subtypes in COS cells. COS cells contain relatively low amounts of arrestins and GRKs in comparison to other cell types such as HEK-293 (16Menard L. Ferguson S.S.G. Zhang J. Lin F.-T. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Barak L.S. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 800-808Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), thus enabling assessment of the relative contributions of GRKs and arrestins to receptor trafficking. COS-1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Flag epitope-tagged α2a, α2b, and α2c ARs in the presence or absence of cotransfected arrestin-3, and receptor internalization was assayed by ELISA. In order to achieve equivalent expression of all three α2-AR subtypes (4–5 pmol/mg), it was necessary to transfect 10-fold lower amounts of the α2a AR construct (data not shown). In the absence of coexpressed arrestin-3, the α2b AR displayed a slow rate of internalization, which reached 15% after 30 min (Fig.1 A). Internalization of the α2c AR occurred at a faster rate, reaching 20% after 20 min (Fig. 1 B). In contrast, there was no significant internalization of the α2a AR (Fig. 1 C). Internalization of both the α2b and α2c ARs was significantly promoted upon coexpression of arrestin-3 (Fig. 1,A and B). Both the rate and total amount of receptor internalization was increased in the presence of arrestin-3. In contrast, internalization of the α2a AR was only modestly promoted by arrestin-3 coexpression (Fig.1 C). We next compared the ability of arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 to promote α2-AR internalization. We have previously shown that transfection of arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 results in approximately 20–30-fold overexpression compared with endogenous arrestin levels (21Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32507-32512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 22Krupnick J.G. Goodman Jr., O.B. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 15011-15016Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Both arrestin-2 and arrestin-3 promoted internalization of the α2b AR, with arrestin-3 promoting a significantly higher level (Fig. 2 A). Coexpression of GRK2, in either the presence or absence of arrestins, had no effect on α2b AR internalization, suggesting that GRK2 is not limiting for α2b AR internalization in COS-1 cells (Fig. 2 A). Expression of GRK2 also did not promote internalization of either the α2a or α2cARs even at times earlier than 30 min (data not shown). Interestingly, α2c AR internalization was significantly promoted by arrestin-3, but not by arrestin-2 (Fig. 2 B) even though expression of arrestin-2 was more efficient. These data suggest that either arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 can promote α2b AR internalization, but that the α2c AR may preferentially respond to arrestin-3. In contrast, arrestin-2 or arrestin-3 (Fig.2 C) only modestly promoted α2a AR internalization. To further characterize the arrestin-mediated internalization of α2-ARs, we transfected cells with either the α2b or α2c AR and arrestin-3, with or without dynamin-K44A, a dominant negative mutant of dynamin-I which does not bind GTP (24Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1037) Google Scholar). Arrestin-mediated internalization of the α2b and α2c ARs was completely inhibited by coexpression of dynamin-K44A (Fig. 3,A and B). Coexpression of dynamin-K44A in the absence of arrestin-3 also revealed a modest inhibition of internalization of both receptors. These data suggest that agonist-induced internalization of both α2b and α2c ARs in both the presence and absence of arrestin-3 is a dynamin-dependent process. We next examined the redistribution of α2-ARs by immunofluorescence. In permeabilized cells, the α2a and α2b ARs were predominantly localized to the cell surface. In contrast, a significant amount of the α2c AR was localized to the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum (Ref. 12Daunt D.A. Hurt C. Hein L. Kallio J. Feng F. Kobilka B.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1997; 51: 711-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar and data not shown). In order to follow the redistribution of receptors present on the cell surface, cells were preincubated with Flag antibody at 4 °C prior to agonist exposure. In this way, only the trafficking of receptors initially present on the cell surface would be detected. Cells were transfected with α2-ARs in the absence or presence of arrestin-3. In the absence of agonist and arrestin, each α2-AR subtype was clearly detected on the cell surface (Fig.4, left panels). When cells were stimulated with agonist for 10 min in the absence of coexpressed arrestin-3, little or no redistribution of α2-ARs was detected (Fig. 4, middle panels). In the presence of coexpressed arrestin-3, the α2a, α2b, and α2c ARs demonstrated agonist-dependent redistribution to clathrin-coated pits and endosomes (Fig. 4, right panels). No redistribution of receptors was observed in arrestin-3-expressing cells in the absence of agonist and internalization was significantly inhibited by coexpression of dynamin-K44A (data not shown). These results suggest that each α2-AR subtype internalizes in an arrestin-dependent manner. Taken together with the results of the ELISA, however, internalization of the α2a AR appears to be significantly less efficient than either the α2b or α2c ARs. Recently, it was reported that arrestin-mediated internalization of GPCRs in HEK-293 cells plays a critical role in their ability to activate p42/p44 MAP kinase (15Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S.G. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). Therefore, we examined the possibility that internalization may be required for α2-AR-mediated MAP kinase activation. Moreover, the differences between the α2-AR subtypes with respect to their internalization suggested that they may constitute an ideal model for studying the role of endocytosis in p42/p44 MAP kinase activation. Initially, we examined the ability of each α2-AR to activate p42/p44 MAP kinase in the absence of arrestin overexpression. Although little internalization of the α2-ARs was observed in the absence of arrestins (Figs. 1and 4), each α2-AR subtype rapidly activated p42/p44 MAP kinase to a similar extent after agonist addition, whereas no activation of p42/p44 was observed in untransfected cells (Fig.5 A). α2-AR-mediated p42/p44 MAP kinase activation was maximal between 5 and 30 min after agonist addition and slowly declined thereafter. The activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase by α2-ARs was inhibited by both dominant negative Ras (RasN17, Fig. 5 B) and pertussis toxin treatment (Fig.5 C). Thus, activation of p42/p44 MAP kinase by all three α2-AR subtypes appears to proceed via activation of Gi/o and Ras, in agreement with previous studies on the α2a AR (25Alblas J. van Corven E.J.

Since the α2-ARs exhibited minimal agonist-mediated internalization in the absence of coexpressed arrestins, we next examined the effect of expressing either wild-type arrestin-3 or dominant negative dynamin-K44A on α2-AR-mediated p42/p44 MAP kinase activation. α2-AR-mediated activation of p42/p44 was not significantly altered by coexpression of either arrestin-3 or dynamin-K44A (Fig. 6,A and B). We also attempted to assess the effect of receptor internalization on p42/p44 MAP kinase activation by treating cells with concanavalin A, hypotonic sucrose, or monodansylcadaverine, which each inhibit receptor internalization albeit by different mechanisms (27Luttrell L.M.

Monodansylcadaverine, which inhibited α2-AR internalization as assessed by ELISA, had no effect on α2-AR-stimulated p42/p44 activation (data not shown), supporting our dynamin-K44A results. In contrast, we observed that concanavalin A and sucrose directly activated p42/p44 in COS cells (i.e. in the absence of receptor and agonist) and were therefore not suited for this analysis. In the experiments shown in Fig. 6 (A and B), both α2-ARs and either arrestin-3 or dynamin-K44A were cotr"

Despite the suggestion that their lectin domains interact with carbohydrate ligands, the identity of such ligands has not been elucidated. We previously showed that brevican, a nervous system-specific lectican, binds the surface of B28 glial cells (Yamada, H., Fredette, B., Shitara, K., Hagihara, K., Miura, R., Ranscht, B., Stallcup, W. B., and Yamaguchi, Y. (1997) J. Neurosci. 17, 7784–7795). In this paper, we demonstrate that two classes of sulfated glycolipids, sulfatides and HNK-1-reactive sulfoglucuronylglycolipids (SGGLs), act as cell surface receptors for brevican. The lectin domain of brevican binds sulfatides and SGGLs in a calcium-dependent manner as expected of a C-type lectin domain. Intact, full-length brevican also binds both sulfatides and SGGLs. The lectin domain immobilized as a substrate supports adhesion of cells expressing SGGLs or sulfatides, which was inhibited by monoclonal antibodies against these glycolipids or by treatment of the substrate with SGGLs or sulfatides. Our findings demonstrate that the interaction between the lectin domains of lecticans and sulfated glycolipids comprises a novel cell substrate recognition system, and suggest that lecticans in extracellular matrices serve as substrate for adhesion and migration of cells expressing these glycolipids in vivo.

The lecticans are a family of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPGs) 1The abbreviations used are: CSPG, chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan; PLD, proteoglycan lectin domain; CRP, complement regulatory protein; ECM, extracellular matrix; SGGL, sulfoglucuronylglycolipid; rCLD, recombinant C-type lectin domain; FNIII, fibronectin type III; EGF, epidermal growth factor; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; TBS, Tris-buffered saline; MDCK, Madin-Darby canine kidney; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BSA, bovine serum albumin; CMF, calcium- and magnesium-free; HBSS, Hank's balanced salt solution. characterized by the presence of a C-type lectin domain in their core proteins (1Ruoslahti E.

The C-terminal globular domains of lecticans, or “proteoglycan lectin domain” (PLD), consist of one or two epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains, a C-type lectin domain, and a complement regulatory protein (CRP) domain. This arrangement of domains is similar to that of selectins, suggesting that lecticans are also involved in the recognition of carbohydrate ligands. Lecticans are the most abundantly expressed family of proteoglycans in the nervous system. The lectican family includes aggrecan (3Doege K. Sasaki M. Horigan E. Hassel J.R. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17757-17767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), versican (4Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), neurocan (5Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and brevican (6Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), all of which are expressed in the nervous system at certain stages of development (1Ruoslahti E.

Although aggrecan and versican were initially characterized as connective tissue proteoglycans, their expression in the nervous system has been demonstrated in a number of reports (8Bignami A.

Chem. 1995; 270: 27206-27212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Structural similarities with selectins and the abundant expression in the nervous system suggest that lecticans play major roles in carbohydrate recognition in the nervous system. The identity of the ligand to PLDs has been a focus of our interest. We previously showed that the PLD of versican binds tenascin-R, an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein predominantly expressed in the nervous system (16Aspberg A. Binkert C. Ruoslahti E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10590-10594Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). More recently, we demonstrated that the PLDs of all lecticans bind tenascin-R, and that brevican and tenascin-R indeed form a complex in adult rat brain extracts (17Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the lectican-tenascin-R interactions, especially the brevican-tenascin-R interaction, are relevant to the assembly of the adult brain ECM. However, these interactions are not carbohydrate-protein interactions expected of C-type lectin domains; they are protein-protein interactions between the PLDs and fibronectin type III domains (FNIII) 3–5 of tenascin-R (17Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Regarding carbohydrate interactions by PLDs, several studies have demonstrated that PLDs can bind simple sugars and heparin/heparan sulfate in vitro (18Halberg D.F. Proulx G. Doege K. Yamada Y. Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9486-9490Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19Saleque S. Ruiz N. Drickamer K. Glycobiology. 1993; 3: 185-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 20Ujita M. Shinomura T. Ito K. Kitagawa Y. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27603-27609Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, these studies failed to identify the nature of any physiological carbohydrate ligands for PLDs. Thus the ability of PLDs to behave as C-type lectins in vivo and the identity of physiological carbohydrate ligands for PLDs are issues that have not been addressed. We have previously shown that purified brevican binds to the surface of primary astrocytes as well as of several immortalized rat neural cell lines (21Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding studies with B28 glial cells demonstrated that the binding is mediated by the C-terminal 80-kDa fragment of the brevican core protein which includes the PLD (21Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). It was initially suspected that tenascin-R deposited to the surface of these cells may act as the “receptor” for brevican. However, we have found that these cells do not have any tenascin-R on their surface nor did they secrete any tenascin-R into culture supernatants. Furthermore, a number of assays failed to identify any cell surface protein that specifically binds brevican PLD. Since it has been reported that the lectin domains of P- and L-selectins bind sulfated glycolipids, such as sulfatides (22Aruffo A. Kolanus W. Walz G. Fredman P. Seed B. Cell. 1991; 67: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar) and HNK-1-reactive sulfoglucuronylglycolipids (SGGLs) (23Needham L.K. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1339-1363Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we examined the possibility that the cell surface brevican receptor is a glycolipid rather than a glycoprotein. In this paper, we report that the PLDs of lecticans bind these sulfated glycolipids. We also show that the interaction between brevican and sulfated glycolipids supports adhesion of cells expressing these glycolipids on their surfaces. These observations suggest that the PLD-sulfated glycolipid interactions are a novel cell substrate recognition system. Mixed bovine brain gangliosides, purified bovine brain sulfatides, and galactosylceramides were purchased from Sigma. Mixed neutral glycosphingolipids were obtained from Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA). The HNK-1 monoclonal antibody was purchased from Becton Dickinson (Bedford, MA). Mouse monoclonal anti-tenascin-R antibody (clone 596) (24Pesheva P. Spiess E. Schachner M. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 109: 1765-1778Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar) and monoclonal anti-sulfatide antibody were gifts from Drs. Melitta Schachner (University of Hamburg, Hamburg, Germany) and Yoshio Hirabayashi (RIKEN, Wako, Japan), respectively. The Fc fusion protein of L-selectin (L-selectin Ig chimera) and a HeLa cell line transfected with cDNAs for HNK-1 sulfotransferase, glucuronyltransferase, and N-CAM were obtained from Dr. Minoru Fukuda (Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). A chimeric protein of brevican PLD fused with Fc region of human IgG (brevican PLD chimera) and biotinylated recombinant lectin domains (rCLDs) of all four lecticans were prepared as described previously (17Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Brevican PLD chimera consists of a short segment of the central domain, a EGF domain, a lectin domain, and a CRP domain of rat brevican. rCLDs consist only of the lectin domains. For preparation of recombinant brevican with no fusion partner, CHO cell were stably transfected with an expression vector pcDNA-rBV, which has a full-length rat brevican cDNA (3.0-kilobase pairEcoRI-EcoRI fragment) (25Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamasaki M. Yamaguchi Y. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 216: 957-963Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) inserted into a uniqueEcoRI site of pcDNAIAmp (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). For the preparation of radiolabeled probe for TLC-ligand binding assay, cultures of a cloned CHO transfectant were metabolically labeled with 100 μCi/ml Tran35S-Label (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA).35S-Labeled or unlabeled brevican was purified from culture supernatants by affinity chromatography on the FNIII3–5 fragment of tenascin-R as follows. The glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of the FNIII3–5 fragment (17Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) was bound to glutathione-agarose and covalently coupled with dimethylpimelimidate according to Gersten and Marchalonis (26Gersten D.M. Marchalonis J.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1978; 24: 305-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Culture supernatants of CHO transfectants were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the FNIII3–5 affinity resin preequilibrated with TBS containing 5 mm CaCl2. After extensive washing, the labeled brevican was eluted from the affinity resin with 20 mm EDTA. For flow cytometry, cells were dissociated with trypsin-EDTA (Irvine Scientific, Irvine, CA), suspended in 10% fetal calf serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, and incubated in the medium for 2 h at 37 °C. Cell were then washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide, and incubated with PBS containing 1% BSA and 0.1% sodium azide for 20 min on ice. Cells were then incubated with brevican PLD chimera or primary antibodies for 30 min on ice. After washing three times with PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide, the cells were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated goat antibodies to human IgG (Sigma) or to mouse IgG+IgM (Biosource) for 20 min on ice, washed again, and resuspended in 0.5–1.0 ml of PBS containing 0.1% sodium azide. The cells were examined on a FACSort (Becton Dickinson, Oxford, CA). Cell surface biotinylation was performed with sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) according to the manufacture's instruction. Biotinylated molecules were collected by streptavidin-agarose. Ligand overlay and immunoblotting assays were performed as described previously (17Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). For preparation of total glycolipid fraction, tissues or cells were extracted by sonication with chloroform/methanol (2:1) and then with a chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:0.8). After removal of the remaining precipitates by centrifugation, the supernatant was dried under N2 stream. The resulting residue was dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1), and then 1/10 volume of 2 m KOH in methanol was added. The solution was incubated at 37 °C for 2 h to degrade phospholipids. The supernatant was collected by centrifugation, neutralized with 1/20 volume of acetic acid, and dried under N2 stream. The residue was suspended in water, dialyzed against water, evaporated to dryness, and then dissolved in chloroform/methanol/water (60:35:8). Acidic glycolipids were purified as described previously (27Miura Y. Yamagata T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 241: 698-703Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). HNK-1-reactive SGGLs were purified from dog sciatic nerve endoneurium as described previously (28Needham L.K. Schnaar R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 397-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). This sample contains 41% SO3-GlcU-nLc-4-Cer and 59% SO3-GlcU-nLc-6-Cer, both of which are recognized by anti-HNK-1 antibody. These assays were performed according to Taki et al. (29Taki T. Ogura K. Rokukawa C. Hara T. Kawakita M. Endo T. Kobata A. Handa S. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 1701-1707PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, glycolipid samples were developed twice on high performance thin layer chromatography plates (Baker Inc., Phillipsburg, NJ) in chloroform/methanol/0.2% aqueous CaCl2 (60:35:8). After drying, the plates were dipped for 30 s in 0.4% polyisobutylmethacrylate (2.5% polyisobutylmethacrylate in chloroform was diluted with hexane to the final concentration of 0.4%), and air-dried. The dried plates were then incubated with various probes (antibodies, brevican PLD chimera, rCLDs, or 35S-labeled native brevican) in TBS containing 1–3% BSA at 4 °C overnight. After washing with TBS, the plates were incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies or HRP-conjugated avidin for 1.5 h, followed by the visualization of reactive bands with chemiluminescence. In the case of 35S-labeled brevican, the dried plates were directly exposed to Kodak BioMax film for 3 days. For preparation of substrates, solutions of brevican PLD chimera or human IgG (100 μg/ml) in calcium- and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution (CMF/HBSS) were applied on nitrocellulose-coated plastic (21Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and incubated at 37 °C for 2 h. After washing three times with CMF/HBSS, uncoated surfaces were blocked by incubating with CMF/HBSS containing 2% heat-inactivated BSA (HBSS/BSA) for 2 h at 37 °C. After washing three times with CMF/HBSS, cells suspended in Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 0.1% heat-inactivated BSA were plated at a density of 5 × 105 (B28 cells), or 1 × 106 (MDCK cells) per ml, and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. After gentle washing, attached cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and counted under microscope at 200× magnification. For perturbation with antibodies, cells were preincubated with 100 μg/ml HNK-1 or anti-sulfatide monoclonal antibodies diluted in CMF/HBSS/BSA for 30 min on ice prior to the plating of the cells. For perturbation by glycolipids, the substrate of brevican PLD chimera was preincubated with SGGLs, sulfatide, or galactosylceramide at concentration of 5 μg/ml in CMF/HBSS for 1 h at 37 °C before plating of the cells. We have shown that the PLD-containing C-terminal 80-kDa fragment of brevican core protein binds to primary astrocytes and B28 cells, which is an immortalized glial cell line. Binding studies with cell monolayers ruled out hyaluronan, heparan sulfate, and chondroitin sulfate as cell surface “receptors” for the brevican C-terminal fragment (21Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To facilitate the identification of the putative brevican receptor, a fusion protein of brevican PLD and Fc region of human IgG (brevican PLD chimera) and a biotin-labeled recombinant lectin domain of brevican (brevican rCLD) were produced. We first examined the binding of brevican PLD chimera to a series of immortalized neural cell lines derived from BDIX rats (30Stallcup W.B. Cohn M. Exp. Cell Res. 1976; 98: 285-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) in flow cytometric assay. Among 16 cell lines tested, brevican PLD chimera bound to B28 cells (Fig.1 A) and four other glial cell lines, namely B9, B15, B49, and B92. The chimera showed no binding to other cell lines with fibroblastic or neuronal phenotypes, including B23 (Fig. 1 B), B19, B27, B35, B50, B65, B82, B103, B104, B108, or B111 cells (data not shown). These results suggest that the cell surface binding of the 80-kDa fragment is mediated by the PLD of the brevican core protein, and that the brevican receptor is expressed in various neural cell lines. The lectin domain of brevican binds tenascin-R by a protein-protein interaction (17Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Although tenascin-R is a secreted protein, it is possible that tenascin-R is present on the surface of B28 cells through interaction with cell surface tenascin-R binding proteins (e.g. contactin) or by nonspecific aggregation, thereby acting as an apparent brevican receptor. However, as described previously (21Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), no tenascin-R was detected on the surface of B28 cells either by flow cytometric assay or by immunocytochemistry (data not shown). Furthermore, the ligand overlay assay with brevican PLD chimera, which we used to identify tenascin-R as a protein ligand to lectican PLDs in adult rat brain extracts (17Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), did not detect tenascin-R in surface-biotinylated proteins from B28 cells (Fig.1 C). Having ruled out tenascin-R as the putative receptor for brevican PLD, we next examined the possibility that cell surface glycoproteins carrying specific carbohydrates would be the receptor for brevican PLD, as is the case with selectins. However, the ligand overlay experiment demonstrated that B28 cells lacks not only tenascin-R but also any cell surface proteins that specifically interact with brevican PLD chimera (Fig. 1 C), suggesting that there are no glycoprotein ligands for the brevican PLD in B28 cells. We further searched for cell surface brevican-binding proteins in B28 cells by immunoprecipitation of surface-labeled materials and affinity chromatography on a column bearing the 80-kDa brevican fragment that includes PLD. None of these experiments could identify glycoproteins that would specifically bind brevican PLD (data not shown). It has been reported that sulfated cell surface glycolipids, sulfatides and HNK-1-reactive SGGLs, bind to the lectin domains of P- and L-selectin (22Aruffo A. Kolanus W. Walz G. Fredman P. Seed B. Cell. 1991; 67: 35-44Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar, 23Needham L.K. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1339-1363Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the possibility that glycolipids would act as cell surface receptors for brevican PLD. To test this, we prepared glycolipids from the adult rat cerebellum and probed with brevican PLD chimera in the TLC-ligand overlay assay. As shown in Fig.2 A, brevican PLD chimera reacted with a single band (lane 2) among a number of glycolipid species extracted from the cerebellum (lane 1). The reactive band migrated at the same position as purified sulfatides (compare panel A,lane 2 with panel B,lane 1), suggesting that the band represents sulfatides. To further identify this reactive band, standard glycolipids were examined by TLC-ligand overlay assay (Fig. 2,B–F) The brevican PLD chimera bound to purified sulfatides (C, lane 1), but not to any of the neutral glycosphingolipids (lane 2) or gangliosides (lane 3). Binding to sulfatides was abolished in the presence of EDTA (D, lane 1), as expected of a C-type lectin interaction. The brevican PLD chimera did not bind galactosylceramide, an unsulfated precursor of sulfatides (indicated by asterisk in B,lane 2), suggesting that a sulfate group is necessary for binding. L-selectin Ig chimera also bound to sulfatides, but not to other glycolipids (E), consistent with previous reports (23Needham L.K. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1339-1363Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Human IgG did not bind any glycolipids (F). The brevican PLD chimera contains not only the C-type lectin domain but also EGF and CRP domains flanking the lectin domain (17Aspberg A. Miura R. Bourdoulous S. Shimonaka M. Heinegård D. Schachner M. Ruoslahti E. Yamaguchi Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 10116-10121Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). To examine the location of the sulfatide binding site, the binding of biotinylated recombinant protein consisting of only the lectin domain (brevican rCLD) was examined. Like the PLD chimera, brevican rCLD specifically bound to sulfatides (Fig. 3 E,lane 1), but not to neutral glycolipids, including galactosylceramide, or to gangliosides (Fig. 3 E,lane 2). Moreover, rCLDs of aggrecan, neurocan, and versican also showed specific binding to sulfatide (Fig. 3,B–D). All of these interactions were completely suppressed in the presence of EDTA (data not shown). These results show that the C-type lectin domain of all four lecticans bind sulfatides in a divalent cation-dependent manner. Considering that L- and P-selectins bind another class of sulfated glycolipid, HNK-1-reactive SGGLs (23Needham L.K. Schnaar R.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1339-1363Crossref Scopus (181) Google Scholar), we tested the binding of PLDs to the HNK-1-reactive SGGLs. A sample of dog sciatic nerve-derived SGGLs consisting of roughly equal amounts of SO3-GlcU-nLc-4-Cer and SO3-GlcU-nLc-6-Cer was tested for binding to brevican PLD chimera (Fig.4). The brevican PLD chimera bound to both SO3-GlcU-nLc-4-Cer and SO3-GlcU-nLc-6-Cer (lane 3). The binding was EDTA-sensitive (lane 4). Consistent with previous reports,L-selectin Ig chimera bound SGGLs (lane 5), but human IgG did not (lane 6). These results demonstrate that PLD binds HNK-1-reactive SGGLs. HNK-1-reactive carbohydrates are present on several glycoproteins as well as on glycolipids (31Jungalwala F.B. Neurochem. Res. 1994; 19: 945-957Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 32Schachner M. Martini R. Trends Neurosci. 1995; 18: 183-191Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Thus, there remained a possibility that glycoproteins carrying HNK-1-reactive glycans could bind PLDs and act as PLD receptors. To address this question, we performed two experiments. First, we prepared extracts containing large amounts of HNK-1-positive glycoproteins from E19 mouse brain. These brain extracts indeed contained several protein bands intensely reactive with the HNK-1 antibody in immunoblotting (Fig.5 A, lane 1). We probed this sample with brevican PLD chimera in ligand overlay assay. Brevican PLD chimera, while it efficiently bound to tenascin-R in adult brain extracts (see Fig. 1 C,lane 4), did not bind any of these HNK-1-positive glycoproteins (Fig. 5 A, lane 2). Second, we examined by flow cytometry the binding of brevican PLD chimera to a HeLa-derived cell line that expresses HNK-1 carbohydrates only on glycoproteins, not on glycolipids. This cell line has been transfected with cDNAs for N-CAM, a glucuronyltransferase (33Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar), and the HNK-1 sulfotransferase (34Ong E. Yeh J.C. Ding Y. Hindsgaul O. Fukuda M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5190-5195Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). The glucuronyltransferase acts only on glycoprotein glycans and not on glycolipids (33Terayama K. Oka S. Seiki T. Miki Y. Nakamura A. Kozutsumi Y. Takio K. Kawasaki T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6093-6098Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Because the parental HeLa cells express no HNK-1-reactive SGGLs, all of the HNK-1 carbohydrates expressed by these cells are contained on glycoproteins, mainly on N-CAM. 2M. Fukuda, personal communication. Flow cytometric analysis confirmed that these cells express high levels of cell surface HNK-1 carbohydrates (Fig. 5 B, a). Despite this, these cells do not bind brevican PLD chimera at all (Fig.5 B, b). In contrast, B28 cells, which express HNK-1-reactive SGGL (see below), show strong binding of brevican PLD chimera (see Fig. 1). Although these results do not entirely rule out the possibility that HNK-1 carbohydrates carried by glycoproteins could be recognized by PLD under some conditions, they demonstrate that HNK-1 carbohydrates attached to glycoproteins are not recognized by PLDs as efficiently as HNK-1-reactive SGGLs. We next examined whether intact, full-length brevican, not just the recombinant PLD fragment, binds these sulfated glycolipids. To test this, we isolated 35S-labeled brevican from culture supernatants of CHO cells transfected with full-length rat brevican cDNA, and used it as a probe in the TLC-ligand overlay assay. As shown in Fig.6, native brevican bound to both sulfatides and SGGLs (lane 1). No binding to neutral glycosphingolipids or gangliosides was found (lane 2). The glycolipid binding by brevican was inhibited with EDTA (lane 3), as was the case with the PLD chimera and the rCLDs. These results demonstrate that not only recombinant PLD fragment but also intact brevican binds sulfated glycolipids. To determine if the cell surface binding of brevican observed with the B28 cells (see Fig.1 A) (21Yamada H. Fredette B. Shitara K. Hagihara K. Miura R. Ranscht B. Stallcup W.B. Yamaguchi Y. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 7784-7795Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is indeed mediated by sulfated glycolipids, we examined whether these cells contain sulfatides and/or SGGLs.

https://openalex.org/W2016391435,"Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a matricellular protein that displays both pro- and anti-adhesive activities. Binding to sulfated glycoconjugates mediates most high affinity binding of soluble TSP1 to MDA-MB-435 cells, but attachment and spreading of these cells on immobilized TSP1 is primarily β1integrin-dependent. The integrin α3β1 is the major mediator of breast carcinoma cell adhesion and chemotaxis to TSP1. This integrin is partially active in MDA-MB-435 cells but is mostly inactive in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, which require β1 integrin activation to induce spreading on TSP1. Integrin-mediated cell spreading on TSP1 is accompanied by extension of filopodia containing β1 integrins. TSP1 binding activity of the α3β1 integrin is not stimulated by CD47-binding peptides from TSP1 or by protein kinase C activation, which activate αvβ3 integrin function in the same cells. In MDA-MB-231 but not MDA-MB-435 cells, this integrin is activated by pertussis toxin, whereas serum, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and ligation of CD98 increase activity of this integrin in both cell lines. Serum stimulation is accompanied by increased surface expression of CD98, whereas insulin-like growth factor-1 does not increase CD98 expression. Thus, the pro-adhesive activity of TSP1 for breast carcinoma cells is controlled by several signals that regulate activity of the α3β1integrin. Thrombospondin-1 (TSP1) is a matricellular protein that displays both pro- and anti-adhesive activities.

The five known thrombospondin genes display distinct patterns of expression during development and in several disease states. Disruption of thethbs1 gene in mice results in lordosis of the spine and abnormal proliferation and inflammatory responses in the lung (3Lawler J. Sunday M. Thibert V. Duquette M. George E.L.

Suppression of THBS1 expression by loss of wild type p53, by activated Ras, Myc, nickel, and in metastatic clones of several tumor cell lines suggested that loss of TSP1 expression may contribute to tumor progression (reviewed in Ref. 4Roberts D.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, overexpression of THBS1 in breast carcinoma cells (5Weinstat-Saslow D.L. Zabrenetzky V.S.

This suppressive activity is due at least in part to the anti-angiogenic activity of TSP1 (reviewed in Refs. 4Roberts D.D. FASEB J. 1996; 10: 1183-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 9Volpert O.V. Stellmach V. Bouck N. Breast Cancer Res.

TSP1 antagonizes growth factor-stimulated proliferation and migration of endothelial cells. Its anti-angiogenic activity is thought to be the major mechanism for suppression of tumor growth inTHBS1-transfected MDA-MB-435 breast carcinoma cells, because thrombospondin overexpression strongly inhibited tumor growth in vivo but did not significantly alter in vitroproliferation, motility, or the ability of the tumor cells to form colonies in soft agar (5Weinstat-Saslow D.L. Zabrenetzky V.S. VanHoutte K. Frazier W.A. Roberts D.D. Steeg P.S. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 6504-6511PubMed Google Scholar). However, higher doses of exogenous TSP1 and some TSP1 peptides can directly inhibit proliferation of these cellsin vitro (11Guo N. Krutzsch H.C. Inman J.K. Roberts D.D. J. Peptide Res. 1997; 50: 210-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Defining the receptors that recognize TSP1 on endothelial and tumor cells may provide insights into the differential effects of this protein on each cell type. Receptors that mediate cell interactions with TSP1 include integrins, proteoglycans, CD36, CD47, the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, and sulfated glycolipids. Binding of TSP1 to each of these receptors may elicit different cellular responses. Thus both the relative levels of expression of each receptor and, potentially, the activation state of each receptor may determine the nature of the adhesive, motility, and proliferative responses of cells to TSP1. We have examined the role of integrins in the pro-adhesive activity of TSP1 for human breast carcinoma cells. Although the integrin αvβ3 is important for adhesion of several cell types to TSP1 (12Lawler J. Weinstein R. Hynes R.O. J. Cell Biol. 1988; 107: 2351-2361Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar), we found that adhesion of breast carcinoma cells on TSP1 substrates is not mediated by this integrin. We report here that the α3β1 integrin rather than β3 integrins play a dominant role in adhesion of several breast carcinoma cell lines on TSP1. The activation state of the α3β1 integrin varies among the human breast carcinoma cell lines examined and can be modulated by inside-out signaling, suggesting that the ability to receive pro-adhesive and motility signals from TSP1 is tightly regulated in these breast carcinoma cell lines. Calcium-replete TSP1 was purified from human platelets as described (13Roberts D.D. Cashel J. Guo N. J. Tissue Cult. Methods. 1994; 16: 217-222Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Proteolytic fragments of TSP1 were prepared as described previously (14Roberts D.D. Sherwood J.A. Ginsburg V. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar).

Antibodies secreted in PFHM-II medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) were purified by protein G affinity chromatography (Pierce). Integrin function blocking antibodies used include LM609 (αvβ3, provided by Dr. David Cheresh), 05-246 (α1β1, Upstate Biotechnology), 6D7 (α2β1, Dr. Harvey Gralnick, NIH), P1B5 (α3β1, Life Technologies, Inc.), 407279 (α4β1, Calbiochem), P1D6 (α5β1, Life Technologies, Inc.), and mAb13 (β1, Dr. Kenneth Yamada, NIH). Non blocking antibodies recognizing α3β1 (M-KID2), α4β1 (HP2/1), and α5β1 (SAM1) were obtained from AMAC, Inc. (Westbrook, ME), and αv (LM142) was provided by Dr. David Cheresh. MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, and MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells (American Type Culture Collection) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS. Okadaic acid, PMA, pertussis toxin (PT), herbimycin A, heparin, and sodium vanadate were purchased from Sigma. Pertussis toxin B oligomer, staurosporine, wortmannin, KT5823, guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphothioate, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-, Rp isomer, and bisindolylmaleimide were from Calbiochem. KT5720 was from Kamiya Biomedical (Thousand Oaks, CA). Cells were detached by replacing the growth medium with PBS containing 2.5 mm EDTA and incubating 5–10 min at 37 °C. The cells were collected by centrifugation, suspended in RPMI containing 0.1% BSA, and assayed for adhesion to bacteriological polystyrene substrates coated with proteins as described previously (14Roberts D.D. Sherwood J.A. Ginsburg V. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 104: 131-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Adhesion assays were terminated after 50 min by washing to remove nonadherent cells and fixation with 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS. Chemotaxis was measured in 48-well chambers using Nucleopore 8 μm, polyvinylpyrrolidone-free filters (Neuroprobe Inc, Gaithersburg, MD). To provide an integrin-independent substrate for motility, the filters were coated with 10 μg/ml polylysine for 16 h at 4 °C prior to use. Motility was measured after 6.5 h and scored microscopically by counting nuclei of migrated cells on the lower surface of the membrane. To examine integrin localization and cytoskeletal rearrangement, 8-well glass chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International, Naperville, IL) were coated with type I collagen, TSP1, or fibronectin overnight at 4 °C. The chambers were then blocked with 1% BSA in PBS, and cells were added in RPMI containing 0.1% BSA. In some cases, antibodies were included in the medium. Cells were allowed to attach and spread for 90 min. The unbound cells were then removed along with the medium, and the chambers were rinsed with PBS and fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde. Cells were stained with BODIPY TR-X phallacidin (Molecular Probes, Inc. Eugene, OR) to visualize F-actin or using primary antibodies followed by BODIPY FL anti-mouse IgG to localize integrins or CD98. All staining procedures were carried out according to the manufacturer's directions. Stained cells were observed and photographed under a Zeiss fluorescent microscope using appropriate filters. Unstimulated MDA-MB-435 cells were evaluated for expression of integrins or their subunits 1 day after plating in RPMI medium containing 10% FCS (Biofluids) by indirect immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. Cells were washed with PBS, 0.2% BSA and incubated at 37 °C for 6 min with Puck's saline A with 0.2% EDTA and 10% FCS. All subsequent procedures were performed on ice, and all washes were with PBS containing 0.2% BSA. Cells were dislodged with a scraper, and the resultant cell suspension was washed. Cell pellets were exposed to mouse IgG or primary antibodies to integrins or integrin subunits in PBS, 0.2% BSA, washed, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Tago, Inc., Burlingame, CA). Following a wash, the cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and analyzed in a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Initial gating was done using forward and side scatter to identify a population of intact cells without debris. TSP1 was iodinated using Iodogen (Pierce) as described previously (20Vogel T. Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Blake D.A. Hartman J. Mendelovitz S. Panet A. Roberts D.D. J. Cell. Biochem. 1993; 53: 74-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For some experiments, cells were grown in sulfate-deficient medium containing chlorate to inhibit proteoglycan and glycolipid sulfation as described previously (21Guo N.H. Krutzsch H.C. Vogel T. Roberts D.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17743-17747Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Flow cytometric analysis (Table I) and immunoprecipitation using subunit-specific integrin antibodies (data not shown) demonstrated that MDA-MB-435 cells express several β1 integrins and αvβ3. Integrin expression on MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells has been reported previously (22Coopman P.J. Thomas D.M. Gehlsen K.R. Mueller S.C. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7: 1789-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 23van der Pluijm G. Vloedgraven H. Papapoulos S. Lowick C. Grzesik W. Kerr J. Robey P.G. Lab.

MDA-MB-231 cells express α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, αv, and β1 subunits. The MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cell lines express only low levels of β3 subunits (24Doerr M.E. Jones J.I. J. Biol.

Biochem. 1996; 62: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) concluded that sulfated glycoconjugates including heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans play a dominant role in both binding of soluble TSP1 and adhesion on immobilized TSP1. We observed a similar dependence for125I-TSP1 binding to MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig.1). Binding was strongly inhibited by heparin or a recombinant 18-kDa amino-terminal heparin-binding fragment of TSP1, but the peptide GRGDS and β1 or α3integrin function blocking antibodies had no effect. Conversely, binding of 125I-TSP1 to MDA-MB-435 cells was not enhanced by incubation with the β1 integrin-activating antibody TS2/16, either alone or in the presence of 10 μg/ml heparin to inhibit TSP1 binding to sulfated ligands (data not shown). Therefore, high affinity binding to soluble TSP1 to these cells is mediated by sulfated glycoconjugates and is independent of integrin binding. Although heparin and recombinant heparin binding domain from TSP1 partially inhibited attachment of MDA-MB-435 cells on immobilized TSP1, the fraction of spread cells was unaffected (Fig.2 A). In the presence of a β1 integrin function blocking antibody at 2 μg/ml, however, only spreading was inhibited, and a combination of heparin and the β1 blocking antibody abolished spreading and markedly inhibited attachment. At 50 μg/ml, the β1 antibody completely inhibited adhesion to TSP1 (Fig. 2 A). Thus, interaction with a β1 integrin is essential for spreading, but sulfated ligands may also contribute to adhesion of these cells on TSP1. This was confirmed by inhibition of sulfation following growth in chlorate. Adhesion was inhibited by 60% for MDA-MB-435 cells with a 90% reduction in 35SO4incorporation (Fig. 2 B). RGD peptides did not inhibit adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells on TSP1 (results not shown). Although MDA-MB-435 cells express some αvβ3integrin (Table I), a function blocking antibody or an αvβ3-specific RGD mimetic blocked adhesion of the cells on vitronectin but had no effect on adhesion on TSP1 (Fig.2 C and results not shown). Conversely, in the presence of the β1-activating antibody TS2/16, adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells was enhanced on TSP1 but not on vitronectin (Fig. 2 C). Therefore, the αvβ3 integrin is functional in MDA-MB-435 cells, but it is apparently unable to recognize the RGD motif in TSP1. The β1 blocking antibody mAb13 inhibited chemotaxis to TSP1, but heparin did not (Fig. 2 D). For these experiments, the filters were coated with polylysine to provide an integrin-independent substrate for adhesion of the cells. Therefore, chemotaxis of MDA-MB-435 cells to TSP1 is also primarily dependent on the β1 integrin receptor. Several human breast cancer cell lines showed similar involvement of β1 integrins in their adhesion to TSP1 (Fig.3). MDA-MB-231 cells attached poorly and did not spread on substrates coated with low concentrations of TSP1. In the presence of the β1-activating antibody, however, the cells attached avidly on TSP1 and exhibited spreading (Fig.3 A). A third breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7, behaved similarly to the MDA-MB-231 cells and showed spreading on TSP1 only in the presence of the β1-activating antibody (Fig.3 A). The apparent low avidity state of the integrin that recognizes TSP1 on MDA-MB-435 cells was not an artifact from using EDTA to dissociate the cells, because cells suspended by scraping from the dish in the presence of divalent cations showed the same degree of enhancement by TS2/16 for adhesion to TSP1 or type I collagen as cells harvested using EDTA (Fig. 3 B). Of the α subunit antibodies tested for inhibiting adhesion to TSP1, only an α3 subunit blocking antibody, P1B5, significantly inhibited adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to TSP1 (Fig. 4 A,p = 0.0007, 2-tailed t test). An α4 integrin blocking antibody slightly inhibited adhesion, but mixing this antibody with the α3 blocking antibody produced no further inhibition than the latter antibody alone (Fig. 4 A). MDA-MB-435 cell spreading on TSP1 was also inhibited by the α3 blocking antibody, and somewhat by the α4 antibody (Fig. 4 B). Function blocking antibodies for α1β1, α2β1, and α5β1integrins had no effect on TSP1 adhesion, although the α2β1 and α5β1antibodies inhibited adhesion of the same cells to known ligands for these integrins (Fig. 4 and results not shown). Activation of β1 integrins using TS2/16 altered the morphology of cells attaching on TSP1 (Fig.5). MDA-MB-435 cells extended a few processes but exhibited no F-actin organization when attached on TSP1 alone (Fig. 5 a), but addition of antibody TS2/16 stimulated spreading with redistribution of F-actin to the cell periphery (Fig.5 b). F-actin was also present in short spikes protruding from the spread cells but did not organize into stress fibers. Staining with the β1 integrin antibody revealed numerous filopodia extending from these points (Fig. 5 c). In some cells, these filopodia were terminated with punctate β1 integrin staining, possibly at sites of contact with the TSP1 substrate. Formation of filopodia was specific to the TSP1 substrate, as TS2/16-induced spreading of these cells on type I collagen (Fig.5 d) or fibronectin (results not shown) only rarely evoked filopodia. These cytoskeletal rearrangements were specific for β1-dependent adhesion to intact TSP1 and were not observed in cells attaching on heparin-binding peptides or recombinant fragments of TSP1 (results not shown). Similar induction of filopodia or microspikes by TSP1 have been observed in other cell types (26Adams J.C. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1977-1990Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Differences in the conformation or folding of TSP1 could account for discrepancies in its reported adhesive activity. The conformation of TSP1 and formation of specific intra-chain disulfide bonds are sensitive to the levels of divalent cations present during its purification. Disulfide bonding also influences interactions of TSP1 with several proteases and regulates the accessibility of the RGD sequence to the αvβ3 integrin (27Hotchkiss K.A. Chesterman C.N. Hogg P.J. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 9761-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 28Sun X. Skorstengaard K. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). We therefore examined the influence of conformation on α3β1-dependent adhesion by absorbing TSP1 with or without divalent cations, at low pH (29Kaesberg P.R. Ershler W.B. Esko J.D. Mosher D.F. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 994-1001Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), or by reducing disulfide bonds using dithiothreitol (Fig.6). Coating TSP1 at pH 4 in acetate buffer enhanced MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion relative to TSP1 adsorbed in PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, but use of PBS with 2.5 mm EDTA did not significantly affect β1-mediated adhesion. Although heparin only partially inhibited MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion to TSP1 (20–50%) when the TSP1 was adsorbed in Dulbecco's PBS (e.g. Fig. 2 A), adhesion to TSP1 adsorbed in pH 4 acetate buffer was inhibited 98% by 10 μg/ml heparin. Conversely, TS2/16 did not reproducibly increase adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells to TSP1 adsorbed in acetate buffer (data not shown). Therefore, the enhanced adhesion to thrombospondin coated at pH 4 was due primarily to enhancement of heparin-dependent adhesion, whereas β1-integrins contributed less to adhesion on TSP1 coated at the lower pH. Adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 6) and MDA-MB-231 cells (results not shown) was strongly inhibited following reduction of TSP1 with dithiothreitol. This contrasts with αvβ3-dependent adhesion to TSP1, which was reported to be enhanced following disulfide reduction using the same conditions as used in Fig. 6 (28Sun X. Skorstengaard K. Mosher D.F. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 693-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Thus, α3β1-dependent adhesion of breast carcinoma cells does not require Ca2+-replete TSP, but some intact disulfide bonds are essential. Adhesion of T lymphocytes to TSP1, mediated by α4β1 and α5β1integrins, is stimulated by phorbol esters (30Yabkowitz R. Dixit V.M. Guo N. Roberts D.D. Shimizu Y. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 149-158PubMed Google Scholar). PMA activation of protein kinase C in MDA-MB-435 cells increased αvβ3-mediated adhesion to vitronectin but had no effect on β1 integrin-mediated adhesion to TSP1 (Fig. 7). Integrin-associated protein (CD47) also regulates integrin function in several cell types (31Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 32Wang X. Frazier W.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 865-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). The carboxyl-terminal domain of TSP1 contains two peptide motifs that activate integrin function through binding to CD47 (31Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar). The CD47-binding TSP1 peptide 7N3 activated adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells on vitronectin (Fig. 7) and a recombinant TSP1 fragment containing the RGD sequence (results not shown) but had no effect on adhesion to native TSP1 (Fig. 7). Thus MDA-MB-435 cells express functional αvβ3 that can be activated by PMA or the TSP1 7N3 peptide. This αvβ3 integrin can recognize the TSP1 RGD sequence in the context of a bacterial fusion protein, but it does not play a significant role in adhesion of resting or stimulated breast carcinoma cells to native platelet TSP1. Several pharmacological agents stimulated β1-dependent adhesion to TSP1 (TableII). The broad spectrum Ser/Thr protein kinase inhibitor staurosporine increased spreading of all three cell lines. However, this activation in MDA-MB-435 cells was only partially replicated by specific inhibitors of protein kinase C (bisindolylmaleimide), protein kinase A (KT5720), or protein kinase G (KT5823 and guanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, 8-(4-chloro-phenylthio)-, Rp isomer). Inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase using wortmannin had no significant effect on MDA-MB-435 cell spreading and weakly enhanced MDA-MB-231 cell spreading on TSP1. Two calcium ionophores, ionomycin and A23187, strongly enhanced spreading of MDA-MB-435 cells but had no effect on MDA-MB-231 cell spreading on TSP1.Table IIModulation of breast carcinoma spreading on TSP1InhibitorCell lineMDA-MB-435MDA-MB-231MCF-7spreading (% TS2/16)Staurosporine112 ± 1613 ± 339 ± 8KT572035 ± 251 ± 2Bisindolylmaleimide15 ± 100 ± 1KT582317.2 ± 7.90 ± 1RP8-pCPT-cGMPS−2 ± 63 ± 1Wortmannin-2−18 ± 1816 ± 4Ionomycin52 ± 30 ± 0A2318783 ± 290 ± 0Herbimycin−16 ± 10 ± 1Vanadate−9 ± 28 ± 2MDA-MB-435 or MDA-MB-231 cell spreading on TSP1 was measured in untreated cells in the presence or absence of the β1-activating antibody TS2/16 to measure basal and total β1-dependent adhesion and in cells pretreated with and maintained in the following inhibitors: 10 nmstaurosporine (Ser/Thr kinase inhibitor), 100 nm KT5720 (protein kinase A), 200 nm bisindolylmaleimide (protein kinase C), 1 μm KT5823 or 2 μmguanosine-3′,5′-cyclic monophosphorothioate, 8-(4-chlorophenylthio)-,Rp isomer (protein kinase G), 2 nm wortmannin (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase), 1 μg/ml ionomycin or A23187 (calcium ionophores), 1 μm herbimycin (tyrosine kinase), or 20 μm vanadate.

Although TSP1 peptides promote PT-sensitive integrin activation through binding to CD47 (31Gao A.G. Lindberg F.P. Dimitry J.M. Brown E.J. Frazier W.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 533-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 33Chung J. Gao A.G. Frazier W.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14740-14746Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar), we showed above that this pathway does not function in MDA-MB-435 cells to activate α3β1. However, PT did influence MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-435 cell adhesion and spreading on TSP1 or collagen (Fig. 8). PT increased adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to TSP1 (Fig. 8 A) but inhibited both basal and TS2/16-stimulated adhesion of MDA-MB-435 cells on the same substrate (Fig. 8 B). The effects of PT in both cell lines were specific, since PT B-oligomer at the same concentration had no effect (Fig. 8). The enhancement of MDA-MB-231 cell adhesion by PT is mediated by the β1 integrin, because the β1 blocking antibody mAb13 inhibited the PT-induced adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells but heparin did not (results not shown). However, not all β1 integrins in these breast carcinoma cells were activated by PT. Adhesion of MDA-MB-231 cells to collagen mediated by α2β1 (verified by the blocking antibody 6D7, results not shown) was not altered by PT, although the same adhesive pathway could be further activated by TS2/16 (Fig. 8 A). In MDA-MB-435 cells, PT partially inhibited α2β1-mediated spreading on collagen stimulated by TS2/16 (Fig. 8 B). We noted that freshly passaged breast carcinoma cells exhibited stronger β1 integrin-mediated adhesion on TSP1. This suggested that proliferation regulates α3β1-mediated TSP1 adhesion. Serum induced a dose-dependent increase in β1 integrin-mediated attachment (Fig.9 A) and spreading of MDA-MB-435 cells to TSP1 or type I collagen. A similar serum response was observed in MDA-MB-231 cells for adhesion on TSP1, although adhesion of the latter cell line to type I collagen was maintained in the absence of serum (data not shown).

In this study, we explored the mechanism responsible for ligand-induced CXCR2 endocytosis. Here, we demonstrate that dynamin, a component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis, is essential for CXCR2 endocytosis and resensitization. In HEK293 cells, dynamin I K44A, a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin that inhibits the clathrin-mediated endocytosis, blocks the ligand-stimulated CXCR2 sequestration. Furthermore, co-expression of dynamin I K44A significantly delays dephosphorylation of CXCR2 after ligand stimulation, suggesting that clathrin-mediated endocytosis plays an important role in receptor dephosphorylation and resensitization. In addition, ligand-mediated receptor down-regulation is attenuated when receptor internalization is inhibited by dynamin I K44A. Interestingly, inhibition of receptor endocytosis by dynamin I K44A does not affect the CXCR2-mediated stimulation of mitogen-activated protein kinase. Most significantly, our data indicate that the ligand-stimulated receptor endocytosis is required for CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis in HEK293 cells. Taken together, our findings suggest that clathrin-mediated CXCR2 internalization is crucial for receptor endocytosis, resensitization, and chemotaxis.

Melanoma growth-stimulatory activity (MGSA) 1The abbreviations used are: MGSA/GRO, melanoma growth-stimulatory activity/growth-regulated protein; CXC chemokine, chemokine with the first two conserved cysteine residues separated by an intervening amino acid; HEK-293 cells, human embryonic kidney cell line; IL-8, interleukin-8; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor; β2-AR, β2-adrenergic receptor; RIPA, radioimmune precipitation assay; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase./growth-regulatory protein (GRO), interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil-activating peptide-2, epithelial derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78, and granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 are members of a family of structurally related cytokines that induce chemotaxis and respiratory burst in neutrophils (1Baggiolini M.

These chemokines belong to the CXC chemokine subfamily in which the first two conserved cysteine residues are separated by an intervening amino acid (4Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 617-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (1831) Google Scholar). Several chemokine receptors have been cloned that bind MGSA: CXCR2 (formerly called IL-8 RB) (5Murphy P.M. Tiffany H.L. Science. 1991; 253: 1280-1283Crossref PubMed Scopus (766) Google Scholar), Duffy antigen receptor for chemokine, and two herpesvirus-encoded receptors: the herpesvirus saimiri ECRF-3 and the human herpesvirus-8 G protein-coupled receptor (6Cesarman E. Nador R.G. Bai F. Bohenzky R.A. Russo J.J. Moore P.S. Chang Y. Knowles D.M. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 8218-8223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-8 binds to these four receptors as well as CXCR1 (formerly called IL-8 RA) (7Holmes W.E. Lee J. Kuang W.J. Rice G.C. Wood W.I. Science. 1991; 253: 1278-1280Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar), which is a receptor for IL-8 and granulocyte chemotactic protein-2. CXCR2 is a shared receptor that binds to IL-8, MGSA, neutrophil-activating peptide-2, epithelial derived neutrophil-activating peptide 78, and granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (8Luster A.D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1998; 338: 436-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (3270) Google Scholar). Like all of the chemokine receptors cloned to date, CXCR2 is a member of a superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that transduce signals to the interior of the cell through heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins). These receptors share a common putative structural topology composed of seven-transmembrane domains separated by three extracellular and three intracellular loops. Upon agonist binding, CXCR2 activates G protein-mediated phosphoinositide hydrolysis to generate diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate, thereby activating protein kinase C and mobilizing Ca2+ to initiate a variety of cellular responses (9Wu D. LaRosa G.J. Simon M.I. Science. 1993; 261: 101-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). Receptor activation is followed by receptor phosphorylation on multiple serine residues and subsequent desensitization of the receptor to further stimulations. These events are usually accompanied by receptor endocytosis and/or recycling of the receptor (10Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). A large body of evidence suggests that the major route of sequestration of GPCRs is via clathrin-coated pits and into early endosomes (11Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). The β2-adrenergic receptor (β2-AR), a prototypical GPCR, becomes phosphorylated upon ligand binding and then exhibits an increased binding affinity for the adaptor molecules (either β-arrestin or arrestin 3), which prevent further coupling between the receptor and G proteins (12Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 13Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The arrestins are subsequently involved in β2-AR sequestration by specifically binding to clathrin, a major component of clathrin-coated pits (14Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 15Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E.R. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that sequestration of GPCRs to early endosomes and lysosomes might be responsible for receptor down-regulation and resensitization (16Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 17Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Within the acidic environment of the endosomes and lysosomes, the receptors either undergo dephosphorylation and recycle back to the cell surface and thus are resensitized or are degraded and down-regulated (11Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). At present, much of the information concerning the molecular mechanisms for GPCR sequestration and down-regulation is derived from the studies of β2-AR. Due to the enormous number of GPCRs and the diverse cellular function evoked by each individual receptor, it is conceivable that multiple mechanisms may be employed for receptor sequestration, down-regulation, and resensitization. This is exemplified by the finding that while clathrin-coated pits are essential for agonist-promoted β2-AR sequestration, sequestration of the angiotensin II type 1A receptor does not require intact function of clathrin-coated pits (18Zhang J. Ferguson S.S.G. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 18302-18305Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar). In contrast to the β2-AR, little is known regarding the sequestration, down-regulation, and resensitization mechanisms of chemokine receptors and their roles in mediating cell chemotaxis, which is a distinct function for chemokine receptors. In order to chemotax along a gradient of chemotactic cytokine, the cells may employ anon-off mechanism in which the chemokine receptors undergo a continuous desensitization and resensitization process. The present studies were focused to delineate the sequestration and down-regulation mechanism of CXCR2. To accomplish this, we transiently expressed the CXCR2 in HEK293 cells and examined the effects of co-expression of the dynamin I K44A mutant on receptor sequestration, down-regulation, and resensitization. We also used ligand-mediated MAP kinase activation and chemotaxis as functional assays to examine the effects of blocking the endocytosis of CXCR2 on its signal transduction events. The results demonstrate that clathrin-coated pits are primary routes for CXCR2 sequestration and down-regulation. Blocking the endocytosis of CXCR2 does not affect downstream MAP kinase activation. However, it does severely attenuate ligand-mediated chemotaxis. 293 human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. HEK293 cells cultured to 80% confluence were transfected with the CXCR2 cDNA in the pRc/cytomegalovirus vector and the dynamin I wild-type or K44A mutant in the pBJ vector using the LipofectAMINE PLUS reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. Before each experiment, an indirect immunfluorescence assay was used to assess the transfection efficiency. The transfection efficiency was approximately 80% in each experiment. The acid/buffer wash technique (19Yang W. Schraw W.P. Mueller S.G. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15193-15200Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) was used to determine the kinetics of MGSA/GRO-induced internalization of CXCR2. Receptor phosphorylation assays were performed as described previously (20Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In brief, the transfected cells were plated on six-well plates 1 day after the transfection. On the following day, after incubating in serum- and phosphate-free medium for 1 h, cells were then labeled by incubating in [32P]orthophosphate (100 μCi/ml) in the same medium at 37 °C for 2 h. Cells were then stimulated with or without 100 ng/ml MGSA/GRO for 10 min. Dephosphorylation was performed by allowing cells to recover in fresh serum-free media without ligand at 37 °C for 1 h. The cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin. CXCR2 was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal rabbit anti-CXCR2 antibody (20Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from cleared supernatants containing approximately 300 μg of protein (estimated by the BCA method; Pierce). The immunoprecipitates were electrophoresed through a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). The phosphorylated receptors were then detected by autoradiography, and the total amount of receptor was determined by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody against CXCR2 to ensure equal loading. HEK293 cells stably expressing CXCR2 (10Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) were grown on 10-mm coverslips (Fisher). To compare the distribution of CXCR2 and the transferrin receptor, cells were washed once with serum-free medium and then incubated at 37 °C with the same medium containing 100 μg/ml of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated transferrin (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 2 h. The cells were washed and then chased for 30 min. Following MGSA/GRO or IL-8 (100 ng/ml) treatment for the indicated time periods, cells were processed for indirect immunofluorescence to detect the subcellular localization of CXCR2 (19Yang W. Schraw W.P. Mueller S.G. Richmond A. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 15193-15200Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Cells were collected by trypsinization 24 h after transfection and plated onto 12-well plates. The next day, the cells were treated with or without 100 ng/ml MGSA/GRO for 0.5–8 h. Cells were lysed in 0.5 ml/well RIPA buffer with proteinase and phosphatase inhibitors described as above. Aliquots of lysates containing 30 μg of protein were subjected to electrophoresis (10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The amount of CXCR2 was detected by Western blot using the previously described rabbit anti-CXCR2 antibody. Agonist-treated cells were lysed by RIPA buffer. Lysates containing equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Phosphorylated MAP kinase (ERK1/ERK2) was detected by a phosphospecific MAP kinase antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA). Chemotaxis assays were performed on transiently transfected HEK293 cells as described previously (10Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) using a 96-well chemotaxis chamber (Neuroprobe Inc.). Immunofluoresence microscopy was used to define the subcellular distribution of CXCR2 in stably transfected HEK293 cells using rabbit anti-CXCR2 polyclonal antibody. The localization of endosomes was detected using the transferrin-fluorescein isothiocyanate complex as described previously. The majority of CXCR2 was targeted to the plasma membrane in untreated cells (Fig.1 A). A small portion of CXCR2 was located intracellularly as punctate structures that colocalized with the transferrin receptor (Fig. 1, A and B). Following MGSA/GRO (100 ng/ml) treatment for 3 h, agonist stimulation resulted in sequestration of CXCR2, observable as a loss of cell surface immunofluorescence with a concomitant increase in the number of intracellular punctate structures. The distribution of the punctate structures overlapped extensively with those of the transferrin receptor (Fig. 1, C and D), suggesting that agonist stimulation enhances CXCR2 redistribution into endosomes. This phenomenon was observable as early as 10 min with MGSA/GRO treatment (data not shown). IL-8 treatment induced a similar redistribution of CXCR2 to the endosomes (data not shown). It has been shown previously that CXCR2 undergoes a rapid endocytosis within minutes in response to either MGSA/GRO or IL-8 stimulation. To determine whether the agonist-promoted CXCR2 endocytosis is a clathrin-mediated process, HEK293 cells were transiently co-transfected with cDNAs encoding CXCR2 and dynamin I K44A. Agonist-promoted endocytosis was determined and compared with that observed in cells transfected only with CXCR2 or cells co-transfected with CXCR2 and wild-type dynamin I. Cells expressing only CXCR2 showed rapid receptor internalization after MGSA/GRO treatment (Fig.2). The MGSA/GRO-stimulated sequestration of CXCR2 occurred in a time-dependent manner. The percentage of endocytosed receptor increased progressively from 20% at 1 min to approximately 60% at 20 min. Co-expression of wild-type dynamin I with CXCR2 seemed neither to promote nor inhibit the rate of CXCR2 endocytosis. In contrast, in cells co-expressing CXCR2 and dynamin I K44A, there was a profound inhibition of the MGSA/GRO-promoted CXCR2 endocytosis, with less than 15% of receptor endocytosed at 20 min. These data clearly indicate that agonist-promoted endocytosis of CXCR2 depends on functional expression of dynamin I and thus is a clathrin–mediated process. This is further supported by the fact that internalized CXCR2 colocalized with the transferrin receptor. Based on ligand binding data, we observed similar CXCR2 cell surface expression level in cells transfected with CXCR2 and dynamin I K44A as compared with those transfected with only CXCR2. We also observed a similar effect on receptor endocytosis when the cells were treated with IL-8 (data not shown). We have previously shown that CXCR2 undergoes a rapid phosphorylation and desensitization after MGSA/GRO treatment (10Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To further investigate the effects of the inhibition of receptor endocytosis on CXCR2 dephosphorylation and resensitization, transiently transfected 293 cells were metabolically labeled with [32P]orthophosphate, treated with MGSA/GRO, and allowed to recover from ligand. In the absence of dynamin I K44A expression, phosphorylation of CXCR2 was detected after 10-min treatment of 100 ng/ml MGSA. After a 1-h recovery period following removal of ligand, CXCR2 underwent dephosphorylation to 44% of the stimulated level. However, the dephosphorylation of CXCR2 in dynamin I K44A co-transfected cells was greatly attenuated. After the same recovery period, about 80% of receptor still remained in the phosphorylated form as compared with ligand-stimulated cells without recovery (Fig.3, A and D). The equal loading of CXCR2 and expression of dynamin I K44A were confirmed by Western blots using antibodies against CXCR2 (Fig. 3 B) and dynamin I (Fig. 3 C). The rate of CXCR2 dephosphorylation with co-expression of wild-type dynamin is comparable with that which occurred in cells transfected with CXCR2 alone. Previously, we have observed that MGSA/GRO treatment resulted in a concentration-dependent decrease in the level of CXCR2 in stably transfected 3ASubE P-3 and HEK293 T2 cells (10Mueller S.G. White J.R. Schraw W.P. Lam V. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 8207-8214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 20Mueller S.G. Schraw W.P. Richmond A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1973-1980Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on information from a β2-AR down-regulation experiment (16Gagnon A.W. Kallal L. Benovic J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6976-6981Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), we hypothesized that a portion of the internalized CXCR2 may be subject to proteolytic degradation in the endosome or lysosome following receptor endocytosis. Moreover, reducing this portion of receptors by blocking endocytosis should have a concomitant effect on receptor degradation and down-regulation. To test this hypothesis, we determined the effect of the dynamin I K44A mutant on CXCR2 degradation and down-regulation in HEK293 cells. Transiently transfected cells were stimulated with MGSA/GRO for various time periods and lysed. The relative amount of CXCR2 was assessed by Western blot using whole cell lysates. As demonstrated in Fig. 4, MGSA/GRO treatment promoted progressive CXCR2 degradation in a time-dependent fashion. After 2 h of treatment, cells lost 14% of receptor. The percentage of CXCR2 loss was increased to 49% following 8 h MGSA/GRO incubation. In contrast, the dynamin I K44A mutant effectively reduced the agonist-promoted CXCR2 degradation, with only 15% of CXCR2 being degraded after 8 h of MGSA/GRO treatment (Fig. 4). These data suggest that a portion of endocytosed CXCR2 undergoes degradation and down-regulation via a clathrin-mediated event. Previous studies demonstrated that IL-8 stimulation on its receptors in neutrophils resulted in activation of MAP kinase pathway (21Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2832-2838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We also confirmed the activation of MAP kinase following MGSA/GRO stimulation in HEK293 T2 cells. To study the downstream CXCR2 signal transduction pathway, we next examined the effect of dynamin I K44A expression on MAP kinase activation. The MGSA/GRO-dependent activation of MAP kinase in cells expressing both CXCR2 and dynamin I K44A was compared with that of cells expressing only CXCR2 by using a phosphospecific ERK1/ERK2 antibody. As demonstrated in Fig. 5,A and C, dynamin I K44A cells exhibited an identical MAP kinase activation response following 5 min of MGSA/GRO or IL-8 (100 ng/ml) stimulation. Equal loading was confirmed by immunoblotting with an antibody against ERK-2. Ligand-stimulated CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis is a direct and effective functional test to access chemokine receptor signal transduction. We used chemotaxis assays to determine if blocking of receptor endocytosis by co-expression of dynamin I K44A could abolish the CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis toward a gradient of IL-8 (Fig.6) or MGSA/GRO (data not shown). We observed an IL-8 concentration-dependent chemotactic response in cells expressing wild-type receptor, with a peak migration occurring at a concentration around 25–50 ng/ml IL-8. Also, the cellular migration response followed a typical bell-shaped curve in which the chemotaxis was inhibited at higher concentrations of IL-8 (Fig. 6). Strikingly, overexpression of dynamin I K44A resulted in marked attenuation of CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis. These data suggest that agonist-mediated endocytosis and resensitization are crucial for CXCR2-mediated chemotaxis. CXCR2 is internalized into vesicular compartments following agonist stimulation and phosphorylation at multiple serine residues in the carboxyl-terminal domain in a manner similar to that observed for several other GPCRs. However, the mechanisms responsible for receptor endocytosis and the functional significance of this event regarding receptor signal transduction are largely unknown. Our studies provide direct biochemical evidence for the requirement of a dynamin-mediated formation of clathrin-coated pits in CXCR2 sequestration, resensitization, and down-regulation. More importantly, our data suggest that endocytosis of receptor is prerequisite to its ability to continuously sense the agonist stimulation that is unique for chemokine receptor-mediated chemotaxis. Previous studies have identified dynamin as a major component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (22Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Dynamin associates with the adaptor protein AP2 complex (23Wang L.H. Sudhof T.C. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). Once localized to the clathrin-coated pits, dynamin promotes endocytosis by catalyzing the pinching off process of coated vesicles (24Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 25van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Dynamin GTPase activity is essential for the formation of clathrin-coated pits. This is confirmed by the observation that expression of a GTPase-defective dynamin mutant prevents formation of the endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles (25van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 26Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar). Using a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin I (K44A), we have demonstrated inhibition of ligand-induced CXCR2 endocytosis. This observation suggests that CXCR2 internalization is mediated by a highly conserved mechanism that is dynamin- and clathrin-dependent. Our immunofluorescence experiments revealed that CXCR2 internalization in HEK293 cells reached to endosomal compartments following MGSA/GRO treatment. Colocalization of CXCR2 with the transferrin receptor in transfected HEK293 cells is consistent with the concept that both receptors utilize the same clathrin-dependent pathway. In the absence of agonist, a small but detectable portion of CXCR2 seems to be localized in the endosomes (Fig. 1 A). This may be due to constitutive receptor internalization and recycling. This idea is supported by the finding that overexpression of dynamin I K44A reduces basal intracellular localization of CXCR2 (data not shown). After internalization to the endosome, the receptor will be dephosphorylated and either recycled back to cell surface or degraded by proteolytic enzymes (11Koenig J.A. Edwardson J.M. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1997; 18: 276-287Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 27Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1991; 60: 653-688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1136) Google Scholar). Using the dynamin I K44A mutant, we have shown that clathrin-mediated receptor internalization is a critical initial step for CXCR2 resensitization and down-regulation. Co-expression of dynamin I K44A resulted in significant diminution of both CXCR2 dephosphorylation and down-regulation. Although the exact mechanism responsible for dephoshorylation of GPCRs remains unclear, it is postulated that the conformational change of the receptor in the acidic environment facilitates dephosphorylation by a G protein-coupled receptor phosphatase (28Krueger K.M. Daaka Y. Pitcher J.A. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 5-8Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Recycling and resensitization of dephosphorylated receptor is believed to allow the chemokine receptors to sense and respond to a continuous gradient of chemokine stimulation. The functional role of agonist-promoted CXCR2 endocytosis has long been elusive in the field of CXCR2 signal transduction. The result of MGSA/GRO and IL-8-mediated MAP kinase experiments suggests that CXCR2 endocytosis is not required for its immediate downstream signaling. These data are supported by the previous observation that a mutant CXCR2 deleting 31 carboxyl-terminal amino acids exhibited significantly impaired agonist-induced receptor endocytosis but not inhibition of adenylyl cyclase or MAP kinase activation (29Neptune E.R. Bourne H.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 14489-14494Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Further evidence suggesting the separation between CXCR2 endocytosis and immediate downstream signal transduction events came from the studies of another CXCR2 deletion mutant (30Richardson R.M. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23830-23836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Richardson et al. (30Richardson R.M. Pridgen B.C. Haribabu B. Ali H. Snyderman R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23830-23836Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a CXCR2 mutant (331T), exhibiting a deletion of the last 25 amino acid residues of the carboxyl-terminal domain, lost agonist-stimulated phosphorylation and sequestration when expressed in the placental cell RBL-2H3 cells. However, the immediate downstream signal transduction events such as GTPase activity, phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis, β-hexosaminidase release, and Ca2+ mobilization were not impaired. Studies of the β2-AR indicate that the capacity of the receptor to signal through adenylyl cyclase remains intact following total inhibition of receptor endocytosis by dynamin K44A (17Zhang J. Barak L.S. Winkler K.E. Caron M.G. Ferguson S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27005-27014Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). However, others demonstrate that in HEK293 cells, the β2-AR mediated activation of MAP kinase is inhibited by blocking receptor internalization although tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated activation of Shc and Raf kinase are unaffected (31Daaka Y. Luttrell L.M. Ahn S. Della Rocca G.J. Ferguson S.S. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 685-688Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). The reasons for the discrepancy in ligand-mediated receptor endocyrosis and downstream MAP kinase activation between CXCR2 and β2-AR are not clear. The chemotaxis assay is believed to be the most useful assay to evaluate the signal transduction capability of chemokine receptors, since it measures the ultimate result of a cascade of intracellular events that are activated by ligand-receptor interaction. More importantly, this assay also provides a functional read out for a process composed of sequential desensitization and resensitization events with respect to receptor activation. Our results clearly demonstrate that overexpression of dynamin I K44A abolished the CXCR2-mediated HEK293 cell chemotaxis toward both IL-8 and MGSA/GRO. The equal or similar cell surface expression of receptors has been confirmed in each experiment by immunofluorescence assay to exclude the possibility that the reduced chemotaxis in cells expressing dynamin I K44A is due to reduced receptor expression or cell surface targeting. The specific signal pathway responsible for chemotaxis is poorly understood. In human neutrophils, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is required for both induction of chemotaxis and MAP kinase activation (32Knall C. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3052-3057Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). When phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is blocked with wortmannin, IL-8-induced MAP kinase is also blocked (21Knall C. Young S. Nick J.A. Buhl A.M. Worthen G.S. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 2832-2838Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The fact that MAP kinase activation in cells expressing dynamin I K44A is normal makes it unlikely that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity is affected in these cells. Considering the fact that endocytosis permits CXCR2 dephosphorylation and resensitization, we therefore postulate that endocytosis, dephosphorylation, resensitization, and recycling of CXCR2 is required for graded response to ligand stimulation. Blocking receptor internalization does not have major effects on the generation of immediate downstream signals but does alter the ability of cells to respond to a continuous signal generated over a concentration gradient, based upon the loss of receptor dephosphorylation and the subsequent receptor recycling. Another possible explanation for the blocking effects of dynamin I K44A on cell chemotaxis may be due to the inhibition of the redistribution of cell surface chemokine receptor and receptors for matrix attachment. One model of cell migration suggests that there is an increased exocytosis at the leading edge of moving cells (33Bretscher M.S. Cell. 1996; 85: 465-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 34Hopkins C.R. Gibson A. Shipman M. Strickland D.K. Trowbridge I.S. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 1265-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This polarized exocytosis may be involved in delivery of fresh integrins and chemokine receptors to the cell front. This process enables the migrating cells to attach to the extracellular matrix and to sense the chemokine stimulation. Following ligand-stimulated receptor phosphorylation, GPCRs bind to adaptor molecules that directly inhibit the interaction between receptor and G-protein (12Lohse M.J. Benovic J.L. Codina J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 248: 1547-1550Crossref PubMed Scopus (918) Google Scholar, 13Attramadal H. Arriza J.L. Aoki C. Dawson T.M. Codina J. Kwatra M.M. Snyder S.H. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 17882-17890Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the case of the β2-AR, the binding of β-arrestin and arrestin-3 is also an initial event required for receptor internalization (14Goodman Jr., O.B. Krupnick J.G. Santini F. Gurevich V.V. Penn R.B. Gagnon A.W. Keen J.H. Benovic J.L. Nature. 1996; 383: 447-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 15Ferguson S.S. Downey W.E.R. Colapietro A.M. Barak L.S. Menard L. Caron M.G. Science. 1996; 271: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). Both β-arrestin and arrestin-3 can function as adaptors. The association of these molecules with phosphorylated receptor and clathrin is a key event in the formation of clathrin-coated pits. Recently, Aragayet al. (35Aragay A.M. Mellado M. Frade J.M. Martin A.M. Jimenez-Sainz M.C. Martinez A.C. Mayor Jr., F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2985-2990Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar) reported that β-arrestin associates with CCR2 shortly after agonist stimulation, suggesting that arrestins might play a universal role in mediating GPCR desensitization and internalization. Studies are currently in progress to test the role of arrestins and other adaptor molecules in CXCR2 desensitization and internalization. In summary, we have established that agonist-promoted CXCR2 proceeds through the formation of clathrin-coated pits to endosomes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the CXCR2 internalization is required for receptor dephosphorylation, resensitization, and down-regulation but not for immediate downstream signaling. More importantly, our chemotaxis experiments indicate that agonist-stimulated receptor endocytosis and dephosphorylation is essential for normal chemokine receptor-mediated chemotaxis in HEK293 cells.

https://openalex.org/W2026880278,"In this study, we utilized potent antisense oligonucleotides to examine the role of two Bcl-2 family members found in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The first, A1, is thought to be a TNF-α-inducible cytoprotective gene, and the second, Bcl-XL, is constitutively expressed.Inhibition of the constitutive levels of Bcl-XL caused 10–25% of the cell population to undergo apoptosis and increased the susceptibility of cells to treatment with low concentrations of staurosporin or ceramide. The caspase inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH2 prevented DNA fragmentation and ΔYm loss caused by Bcl-XL inhibition or Bcl-XL inhibition combined with staurosporin. However, disruption of ΔYm caused by Bcl-XL inhibition combined with ceramide treatment was not inhibited by benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH2, although DNA fragmentation was completely prevented. Taken together, these results demonstrate a direct protective role for Bcl-XL under normal resting conditions and under low level apoptotic challenges to HUVEC. Furthermore, Bcl-XL protects cells from caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms of ΔYm disruption.In contrast to Bcl-XL, A1 inhibition did not show a marked effect on the susceptibility of HUVEC to undergo apoptosis in response to TNF-α, ceramide, or staurosporin. These results demonstrate that although A1 may be a cytoprotective gene induced by TNF-α, it is not primarily responsible for HUVEC resistance to this cytokine. In this study, we utilized potent antisense oligonucleotides to examine the role of two Bcl-2 family members found in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC).

These results demonstrate that although A1 may be a cytoprotective gene induced by TNF-α, it is not primarily responsible for HUVEC resistance to this cytokine. The signaling pathways involved in apoptosis have been intensely studied in the last few years due to their role in many disease states including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. One central player is the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which can either promote cell survival (Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, A1, Mcl-1, and Bcl-W) or promote cell death (Bax, Bak, Bcl-XS, Bad, Bid, Bik, Bim, Hrk, Bok) (reviewed in Ref. 1Adams J.M. Cory S. Science. 1998; 281: 1322-1326Crossref PubMed Scopus (4820) Google Scholar). The relative amounts or equilibrium between these pro- and antiapoptotic proteins influence the susceptibility of cells to apoptosis. As such, many cancer cells up-regulate the antiapoptotic members as a mechanism to guard against programmed cell death. Although much work has been carried out studying the protective role of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in response to many different apoptotic stimuli, relatively little is known about the other antiapoptotic family members or the specific role of each isoform. Endothelial cells play a pivotal role in modulating the inflammatory response. Stimulation of endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) 1The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor α; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cells; ΔYm, mitochondrial transmembrane potential; Z-VAD.fmk, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-CH2F; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; G3PDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. activates the transcription factor NF-κB, leading to induction of proinflammatory genes. TNF-α is also known to trigger programmed cell death, which in most cells is controlled by the simultaneous up-regulation of cytoprotective genes (Refs. 2Beg A.A. Baltimore D. Science. 1996; 274: 782-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (2940) Google Scholar, 3Wang C.-Y. Mayo M.W. Baldwin A.S. Science. 1996; 274: 784-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (2515) Google Scholar, 4Van Antwerp D.J.

Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 107-111Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Because this anti-death activity requires de novo protein synthesis, cells resistant to the cytotoxic effects of TNF-α, including endothelial cells, can be rendered sensitive by pretreatment with either RNA or protein synthesis inhibitors. To date, several TNF-α-inducible cytoprotective genes have been identified and have been shown through overexpression techniques to protect cells, at least in part, from death induced by TNF-α and cycloheximide/actinomycin D. This growing family represents a diverse range of proteins and includes manganous superoxide dismutase (6Wong G.H.W. Elwell J.H. Oberley L.W. Goeddel D.V.

We initiated studies aimed at addressing the role of A1 as a TNF-α-inducible cytoprotective gene and comparing its function to Bcl-XL, which is expressed constitutively in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). In order to help address the importance of each isoform in normal tissue, highly selective and potent antisense inhibitors were utilized in this study. We show that inhibition of A1 alone does not render HUVEC susceptible to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. However, inhibition of Bcl-XL caused HUVEC to undergo apoptosis and sensitized cells to treatment with either ceramide or staurosporin. Furthermore, Bcl-XL protected cells from both caspase-dependent and -independent mechanisms of ΔYm disruption. HUVEC were obtained from Clonetics (San Diego, CA) and cultivated in endothelial growth medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Cells were used between passages 2 and 5. Opti-MEM, Lipofectin reagent, and fetal bovine serum were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. TNF-α was obtained from R & D Research (Minneapolis, MN), Bcl-X antibody and the ribonuclease protection assay were from Pharmingen (San Diego, CA). Caspase 3 antibody was from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and MitoTracker Orange CMTMRos was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). SDS-polyacrylamide gels were obtained from NOVEX (San Diego, CA). Staurosporin, C6-ceramide, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp(OMe)-CH2 (Z-VAD.fmk), and carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone were purchased from Calbiochem. Hybond N+ nylon membranes and the ECL Plus detection kit were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 2′-O-Methoxyethyl chimeric antisense oligonucleotides were utilized for all experiments. The A1 antisense oligonucleotide and its control contained phosphodiester linkages in the 2′-O-methoxyethyl regions and phosphorothioate linkages in the 2′-deoxynucleotide regions, which support RNase H activity in cells (14Monia B.P. Lesnik E.A. Gonzalez C. Lima W.F. McGee D. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Cook P.D. Freier S.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14514-14522Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide and its control contained phosphorothioate linkages throughout. All oligonucleotides were synthesized using an Applied Biosystems 380B automated DNA synthesizer and purified as described previously (15Lesnik E.A. Guinosso C.J. Kawasaki A.M. Freier S.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 7832-7838Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 16Baker B.F. Lot S.S. Condon T.P. Cheng-Flournoy S. Lesnik E.A. Sasmor H.M. Bennett C.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11994-12000Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). HUVEC were treated with oligonucleotides at ∼80% confluence (17Chiang M.-Y. Chan H.

Mol. Pharmacol. 1992; 41: 1023-1033PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed three times with prewarmed (37 °C) Opti-MEM. Oligonucleotides were premixed with 10 μg/ml Lipofectin reagent in Opti-MEM at the desired concentration and applied to washed cells. HUVEC were incubated with the oligonucleotides for 4 h at 37 °C, after which the medium was removed and replaced with standard growth medium. For experiments carried out with A1 antisense oligonucleotide, the cells were allowed to recover 16–18 h after oligonucleotide treatment, prior to induction with TNF-α (10 ng/ml), C6-ceramide (5 μm), staurosporin (1 nm), or Z-VAD.fmk (100 μm). Because Bcl-XL is expressed constitutively, treatment with TNF-α (10 ng/ml), C6-ceramide (5–10 μm), staurosporin (1–2 nm), or Z-VAD.fmk (100 μm) was delayed 24 h after oligonucleotide treatment. This delay period allowed time for reduction in Bcl-XL protein prior to the addition of apoptotic stimuli. Total cellular RNA was isolated either 4 h after TNF-α induction (A1 antisense experiments), or 24–48 h after oligonucleotide treatment (Bcl-XL antisense experiments) utilizing Quiagen RNeasy Kit. Isolated RNA was separated on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel, transferred to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane over-night, and UV-cross-linked (Stratalinker 2400, Stratagene). Blots were hybridized several hours with random primed32P-labeled probes (Bcl-XL) or single-stranded PCR32P-labeled probes (A1) as described by Bednarczuk et al. (19Bednarczuk T.A. Wiggins R.C. Konat G.W. BioTechniques. 1991; 10: 478PubMed Google Scholar). Both A1 and Bcl-XL cDNA's were generated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction carried out with HUVEC total RNA. Polymerase chain reaction was subsequently utilized to amplify bases 22–684 of the human A1 gene and bases 34–856 of the human Bcl-XL gene. The primer utilized to generate the single-stranded A1 probe was 5′-AGAAGTATGTGTTGGCAATCGT-3′. All Northern blots were reprobed with random primed 32P-labeled human G3PDH cDNA to confirm equivalent loading of RNA samples. Samples for Western analysis were prepared using 400 μl of radioimmune precipitation extraction buffer/100-mm plate. The protein concentration for each sample was determined by Bradford analysis. Equal amounts of total protein were separated on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide minigel, and proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Membranes were treated for a minimum of 2 h with specific primary antibody followed by incubation with secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. Visualization was carried out with the ECL Plus detection kit. Cells were treated with oligonucleotides and apoptosis inducers as described. Both floating and adherent cells were harvested 24–48 h after treatment; washed once with 1 ml of PBS, 5 mm EDTA; and fixed with 1 ml of 70% EtOH while vortexing gently. Fixed cells were stored at 4 °C for 1 h to several days. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation, washed once with 1.0 ml of PBS, 5 mm EDTA, and resuspended with 0.3–1.0 ml Propidium Iodide mix (250 μg/ml propidium iodide, 5 μg/ml RNase A, 1 × PBS, and 5 mm EDTA). After incubation in the dark for 1 h at room temperature, the cells were analyzed on a Becton Dickinson FACscan, and apoptotic cells (sub-G1 population) were quantified. To evaluate the ΔYm, cells were incubated with the cationic lipophilic dye MitoTracker orange CMTMRos (150 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C in the dark (20Macho A. Decaudin D. Castedo M. Hirsch T. Susin S.A. Zamzami N. Kroemer G. Cytometry. 1996; 25: 333-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Control cells were simultaneously treated with 50 μm of the protonophore, carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, which disrupts ΔYm. Both adherent and floating cells were collected, washed once with PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, and fixed in 1 ml of PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min while shaking at room temperature. Fixed cells were stored in the dark at 4 °C for 1 day prior to analysis by flow cytometry. The percentage of cells with decreased fluorescence, and therefore with reduced ΔYm (compared with control cells not treated with oligonucleotides or apoptotic inducers), were determined and indicated on the bar graphs as percentage of cells gated. Cells treated with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone generally gave greater than 70% cells gated and showed a shift of 0.5 log units to a lower fluorescence. Caspase 3 activity was measured using Caspase 3 colorimetric assay kit from CLONTECH(Palo Alto, CA). Briefly, whole cell lysates were obtained, protein concentrations were determined, and equal amounts of protein were added to 50 μm substrate (Asp-Glu-Val-Asp-p-nitroanilide) in assay buffer. Samples were incubated at room temperature and analyzed using a spectrophotometer (OD 418). Ribonuclease protection assay was utilized to identify Bcl-2 family members present in basal and TNF-α-treated HUVEC. High levels of the antiapoptotic members Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 were observed in both basal and induced cells, while Bcl-2 was not detected (Fig. 1). In contrast, the antiapoptotic member A1 was found in low abundance in basal HUVEC but increased ∼10-fold following TNF-α treatment. Maximal induction of A1 was observed ∼4 h after treatment. Interestingly, Bcl-XL was down-regulated approximately 20% upon treatment with TNF-α. An effective antisense oligonucleotide directed toward A1 was identified from a screen targeting 14 distinct positions on the A1 mRNA, extending from the 5′-UTR to the 3′-UTR using methods as described previously (21Bennett C.F. Condon T.P. Grimm S. Chan H. Chiang M.-Y. J. Immunol. 1994; 152: 3530-3540PubMed Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides were 20 nucleotides in length containing chimeric 2′-O-methoxyethyl modifications on a mixed backbone of phosphodiester and phosphorothioate linkages (Table I). The most effective A1 antisense oligonucleotide was directed toward the 3′-UTR, immediately downstream from the stop codon, and was utilized in all subsequent experiments.Table ISequence and chemistry of oligonucleotidesTargetSequencePosition on mRNAA1(AoToCoGoTs) TsTsCsCsAsTsAsTsCsAs (GoToCoAoGo)6481Accession numbers for A1 and Bcl-XL are U29680 andZ23115, respctively.Control(AoToCoGoTs) TsCsCsTsAsTsCsTsAsAs (GoToCoAoGo)Bcl-XL(CsTsAsCsGs) CsTsTsTsCsCsAsCsGsCs (AsCsAsGsTs)5801Accession numbers for A1 and Bcl-XL are U29680 andZ23115, respctively.Control(CsGsAsCsAs) CsGsTsAsCsCsTsCsTsCs (GsCsAsTsTs)All oligonucleotides utilized were chimeras with 2′-deoxy or 2′-O-methoxyethyl modifications.

Fig. 2 shows the concentration-dependent decrease of the A1 mRNA with increasing amounts of A1 antisense oligonucleotide, while a mismatch control oligonucleotide failed to show a reduction, demonstrating a sequence specific inhibition. The apparent IC50 for the A1 antisense compound was less than 10 nm. Treatment of HUVEC with 50 nm of the A1 antisense oligonucleotide reduced the A1 mRNA to basal levels, completely inhibiting the TNF-α-induced component. Reductions in A1 mRNA to basal levels were observed up to 30 h after antisense treatment (data not shown). A potent, sequence-specific antisense oligonucleotide directed toward Bcl-XL has previously been identified and shown to decrease Bcl-XL mRNA and protein levels in both human keratinocytes and A549 cells. 2Taylor, J. K., Zhang, Q. Q., Monia, B. P., Marcusson, E., and Dean, N. M. (1999) Oncogen, in press. Here we tested its ability to inhibit Bcl-XL mRNA in HUVEC. As shown in Fig.3, treatment of HUVEC with 100 nm of the Bcl-XL oligonucleotide decreased the Bcl-XL mRNA levels to ∼5% of control, with an apparent IC50less than 20 nm. In comparison, a mismatch control oligonucleotide did not reduce the Bcl-XL mRNA levels. The Bcl-XL antisense compound is targeted to the coding region of the gene and is a chimera of 2′-O-methoxyethyl modification with a phosphorothioate backbone (Table I). It should be noted that the Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide utilized here targets both the long and short forms of Bcl-X (Bcl-XL and Bcl-XS). However, HUVEC contain such low levels of Bcl-XS mRNA, either basally or after induction with TNF-α (see Fig. 1), that the contribution of Bcl-XS to the total Bcl-X mRNA levels detected in our experiments is insignificant. Bcl-XL protein expression was also examined by Western analysis. As shown in Fig. 4, cells treated with the Bcl-XL antisense compound showed a time-dependent decrease in Bcl-XL protein levels that was not observed in cells treated with the control compound. Maximal reduction was observed 48 h after oligonucleotide treatment. In our experiments, the Bcl-XL protein migrated as a doublet (visible only after significant reductions in protein), and both bands decreased with antisense oligonucleotide treatment. The observed doublet could represent changes in the phosphorylation state of Bcl-XL. If the Bcl-XS protein were present, it should migrate well below the Bcl-XL band under our conditions. Thus, the Bcl-XL antisense compound was able to decrease Bcl-XL protein levels to roughly 5% of amounts in untreated cells. In order to demonstrate the specificity of A1 and Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotides, HUVEC were treated with A1 antisense oligonucleotide, A1 control, Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide, or Bcl-XL control, in the presence or absence of TNF-α. Northern analysis was carried out, and the membrane was probed sequentially with A1, Bcl-XL, and G3PDH-specific probes. The A1 antisense compound was effective in reducing A1 mRNA without affecting the Bcl-XL mRNA. Likewise, the Bcl-XL antisense compound specifically reduced Bcl-XL mRNA without affecting A1 mRNA (Fig. 5). In addition, there was no affect on either target with the control oligonucleotides. These results demonstrate that the antisense oligonucleotides utilized here can specifically inhibit the target mRNA without affecting other Bcl-2 family members. Because A1 is induced by TNF-α treatment, its role in protecting HUVEC from TNF-α-induced apoptosis has been suggested (12Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). To address this point, cells were treated with 50 nm A1 antisense oligonucleotide or control oligonucleotide and subsequently induced with TNF-α. Apoptotic cells with fragmented DNA were identified by flow cytometry analysis. As shown in Fig. 6 A, inhibition of the TNF-α-induced A1 mRNA did not significantly affect the number of apoptotic cells observed after TNF-α treatment. However, cells treated with a combination of TNF-α and cycloheximide, which prevents the up-regulation of all TNF-α-inducible cytoprotective genes, resulted in over 50% cell death under these conditions. These results suggest that A1 is not solely responsible for protection of HUVEC from TNF-α-induced programmed cell death. Similar experiments were also carried out with the Bcl-XL antisense compound. Inhibition of Bcl-XL protein in basal HUVEC caused 10–25% of the cell population to undergo apoptosis (Fig. 6 B). Thus, Bcl-XL may play an important role in the basal viability of endothelial cells. On the other hand, inhibition of the Bcl-XL protein did not render cells more sensitive to TNF-α treatment (i.e. the difference between Bcl-XL and control remained the same in the presence of TNF-α), indicating that Bcl-XL is not critical in protecting cells from this apoptotic stimuli. Because inhibition of either A1 or Bcl-XL protein did not render HUVEC more susceptible to TNF-α induced apoptosis, we investigated whether simultaneous inhibition of both proteins would result in increased apoptosis. Therefore, HUVEC were treated with both A1 and Bcl-XL antisense compounds, allowed to recover for 24 h, and then treated with or without TNF-α. Fig. 6 C shows that simultaneous inhibition of A1 and Bcl-XL did not significantly render HUVEC more susceptible to TNF-α treatment. Next we tested the sensitivity of HUVEC treated with the A1 or Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide to treatment with the protein kinase inhibitor staurosporin or the lipid second messenger ceramide. Both of these agents have been shown to induce apoptosis in many cell types including endothelial cells (22Bombeli T. Karsan A. Tait J.F. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1997; 89: 2429-2442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Slowik M.R. Min W. Ardito T. Karsan A. Kashgarian M. Pober J.S. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 257-267PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of HUVEC with 1 nm staurosporin or 5 μm C6-ceramide alone did not significantly affect the cellular DNA fragmentation. However, cells with decreased levels of Bcl-XL protein showed increased sensitivity toward these low concentrations of apoptotic stimuli (Figs.7 and8 A). In contrast, cells pretreated with the A1 antisense compound showed only a slight increase in DNA fragmentation after treatment with TNF-α in the presence of either staurosporin or ceramide (Fig.9 A). As shown in Fig.9 A, HUVEC were more sensitive to ceramide treatment when carried out in the presence of TNF-α as described previously (23Slowik M.R. Min W. Ardito T. Karsan A. Kashgarian M. Pober J.S. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 257-267PubMed Google Scholar).Figure 8Effect of Bcl-XL inhibition, ceramide, and staurosporin on DNA fragmentation and ΔYm in the presence and absence of Z-VAD.fmk.

Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2265-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and 25Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the effect of A1 and Bcl-XL inhibition on the ΔYm. A reduction in ΔYm has been shown to accompany apoptosis in many experimental models and can be monitored by the potential-sensitive, fluorescent dye CMTMRos. To confirm that CMTMRos was sensitive to mitochondrial transmembrane depolarization, control cells were treated with 50 μm of the mitochondrial uncoupling agent carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. As shown in Fig. 8 C, treatment of HUVEC with Bcl-XL antisense compound resulted in a reduction in the ΔYm. This reduction was potentiated by the combination of Bcl-XL inhibition and treatment with either staurosporin or ceramide. Thus, endogenous Bcl-XL may function by maintaining the mitochondrial integrity of resting HUVEC, where loss of Bcl-XL results in greater susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction. In contrast to these results, inhibition of A1 did not effect the ΔYm, after treatment with either TNF-α alone or TNF-α in combination with ceramide or staurosporin (Fig. 9 C). HUVEC were treated with the A1 or Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotides or controls, in the presence or absence of Z-VAD.fmk, a broad-based cell-permeable caspase inhibitor. As shown in Fig.8 B, Z-VAD.fmk completely inhibited the DNA fragmentation resulting from Bcl-XL inhibition alone or from Bcl-XL inhibition in the presence of ceramide or staurosporin. Similar results were also obtained using Z-DEVD.fmk, a known inhibitor of caspases 3, 7, and 8 (data not shown). Besides affecting DNA fragmentation, Z-VAD.fmk also inhibited ΔYm loss induced by Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide or Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide and staurosporin (Fig. 8 D). However, inhibition of ΔYm was not observed when cells deficient in Bcl-XL protein were treated with ceramide. Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide plus ceramide-treated cells were not viable as shown by PI exclusion (data not shown), although DNA fragmentation was completely prevented. Consistent with caspase inhibition data, proteolysis of procaspase 3 was also observed in Bcl-XL-deficient cells and cells treated with staurosporin. This reduction in procaspase 3 was inhibited by Z-VAD.fmk (Fig. 10 A). In addition, separate experiments demonstrated an increase in caspase 3 activity following inhibition of Bcl-XL or Bcl-XL inhibition in the presence of staurosporin. The increased caspase 3 activity correlated with the proteolysis of procaspase 3 observed in the Western blot (Fig.10 B). To date, much work has been carried out studying the protective role of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, while relatively little is known about the other antiapoptotic Bcl-2 family members A1, Bcl-W, and Mcl-1. One unresolved question has been the specific function or molecular mechanism of each isoform, since many cells express more than one. Through ribonuclease protection assay analysis, we show that endothelial cells express Bcl-XL and Mcl-1 constitutively, while A1 is found in very low amounts in basal cells but can be up-regulated by TNF-α. Therefore, we initiated studies aimed at addressing and comparing the normal physiological role between two of these family members, A1 and Bcl-XL, by utilizing specific antisense oligonucleotides to inhibit the endogenous levels of each protein. Although the identity of the survival factor(s) responsible for halting the TNF-α death pathway remains to be firmly established, a number of recent reports have identified several candidates. One such candidate, A1, was originally identified in phorbol ester-stimulated endothelial cells and shown to be induced by the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α and interleukin-1 (27Karsan A. Yee E. Kaushansky K. Harlan J.M. Blood. 1996; 87: 3089-3096Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further experiments demonstrated that endothelial cells expressing high levels of A1, through retrovirus-mediated transfer, were protected against cell death initiated by TNF-α plus actinomycin D (12Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). This protection was also observed with overexpression of Bcl-XL (12Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). However, others have reported that overexpression of either A1 or Bcl-XL did not rescue HUVEC from death induced by TNF-α plus cycloheximide, although both effectively inhibited apoptosis induced by TNF-α plus ceramide. (23Slowik M.R. Min W. Ardito T. Karsan A. Kashgarian M. Pober J.S. Lab. Invest. 1997; 77: 257-267PubMed Google Scholar). To help clarify the role of A1 as a TNF-α-inducible cytoprotective gene, we asked whether inhibition of A1 would render cells sensitive to TNF-α-induced apoptosis. We demonstrate that treatment of HUVEC with a highly specific and potent antisense oligonucleotide directed toward A1 completely inhibited the TNF-α-inducible component of the A1 mRNA. However, this inhibition did not render cells significantly more susceptible to apoptosis by TNF-α. Furthermore, cells with decreased levels of Bcl-XL, or both Bcl-XL and A1, continued to show resistance to TNF-α treatment. Thus, A1 and Bcl-XL do not appear to play critical roles in protecting endothelial cells from TNF-α. In contrast, inhibition of the endogenous levels of Bcl-XL resulted in a substantial amount of cell death in basal cells. In addition, Bcl-XL-deficient cells were rendered sensitive to concentrations of ceramide and staurosporin that were without effect in cells expressing normal levels of Bcl-XL. Thus, Bcl-XL may function physiologically as a protective gene that, under normal resting conditions, helps endothelial cells maintain their quiescent phenotype and perform their normal barrier functions even in the presence of low levels of stimulants (26Bach F.H. Hancock W.W. Ferran C. Immunol. Today. 1997; 18: 483-486Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). This would be critical for endothelial cells in vivo, which are constantly assaulted by noxious compounds such as oxidized low density lipoproteins or cytokines. Our results are consistent with overexpression data indicating that Bcl-XL protects cells from assault from a wide range of apoptotic stimulants, including ceramide (12Karsan A. Yee E. Harlan J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27201-27204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar, 28Wiesner D.A. Kilkus J.P. Gottschalk A.R. Quintans J. Dawson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9846-9868Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (109) Google Scholar) and staurosporin (29Vander Heiden M.G. Chandel N.S. Williamson E.K. Schumacker P.T. Thompson C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 627-637Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1242) Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that as the concentrations of staurosporin and ceramide increased, the differences observed between normal and Bcl-XL-inhibited HUVEC slowly disappeared (data not shown). These results suggest that endogenous Bcl-XL can protect HUVEC from apoptotic stimuli up to a threshold level after which its presence or absence does not effect the outcome. This may make sense physiologically, since a high level of assault, causing substantial damage to a cell, would be desirable to end in cell death. One of the major mechanisms of Bcl-2-mediated cytoprotection is by protecting mitochondrial function (reviewed in Refs. 24Zamzami N. Brenner C. Marzo I. Susin S.A. Kroemer G. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 2265-2282Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar and 25Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). More specifically, these proteins are thought to function through maintaining the mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening (and therefore protecting ΔYm) and preventing release of the caspase activators, AIF and cytochrome c, into the cytosol (25Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar). In support of these functions, several groups have now reported that overexpression of Bcl-XL or Bcl-2 confers protection upon mitochondria, making it more difficult for many stimuli to induce PT pore opening and release of AIF and cytochrome c (25Reed J.C. Jurgensmeier J.M. Matsuyama S. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1366: 127-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 30Kluck R.M. Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Newmeyer D.D.

Oncogene. 1996; 13: 21-29PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with a role in the maintenance of mitochondria integrity, we show that inhibition of endogenous Bcl-XL protein levels caused a reduction in ΔYm. This reduction was further potentiated with the combination of Bcl-XL inhibition plus ceramide or staurosporin. However, the observed ΔYm loss showed different responses to caspase inhibitors. In cells treated with Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide or Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotide plus staurosporin, Z-VAD.fmk prevented apoptosis, within the time frame studied, as shown by a lack of DNA fragmentation and maintenance of ΔYm. However, Z-VAD.fmk was unable to protect cells against ΔYm loss and subsequent death induced by Bcl-XL antisense oligonucleotides plus ceramide, although DNA fragmentation was completely blocked. These results can be explained in view of the current models. When cytochrome c is released into the cytosol, it can bind to Apaf-1, resulting in the activation of caspase 9 and subsequently caspase 3. It is now apparent that in some systems, cytochromec release occurs prior to loss in ΔYm and that the subsequent activation of caspases is required for ΔYm loss, resulting in a circular amplification loop (Refs. 30Kluck R.M.

Thus, in this model, disruption of ΔYm is prevented by caspase inhibitors as was observed with Bcl-XL inhibition and Bcl-XL inhibition plus staurosporin. Alternatively, in a number of other models, inhibition of caspases with Z-VAD.fmk fails to prevent the disruption of mitochondrial membrane function, despite the fact that Z-VAD.fmk does prevent the acquisition of the many biochemical hallmarks including DNA fragmentation (37De Maria R.

Thus, in these systems caspase activation is downstream of mitochondria dysfunction, and furthermore, mitochondrial disruption is sufficient to cause cell death, through apoptosis or necrosis. This model would be consistent with our observations with Bcl-XL inhibition plus ceramide. Furthermore, a recent report demonstrated that GD3 ganglioside synthesis, which can be triggered by cell-permeating ceramides, resulted in disruption of ΔYm and induced apoptosis in a caspase-independent fashion (37De Maria R. Lenti L. Malisan F. d'Agostino F. Tomassini B. Zeuner A. Rippo M.R. Testi R. Science. 1997; 277: 1625-1655Crossref Scopus (379) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data are consistent with endogenous Bcl-XL functioning by maintaining mitochondrial integrity of resting HUVEC, where loss of Bcl-XL results in greater susceptibility to mitochondrial dysfunction. The protection of ΔYm afforded by Bcl-XL functions in both caspase-dependent and caspase-independent mechanisms. These results demonstrate a definitive role for Bcl-XL in these processes and are complementary to overexpression data obtained previously."

https://openalex.org/W2059485506,"Cell death and cell survival are central components of normal development and pathologic states. Transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1) is a pleiotropic cytokine that regulates both cell growth and cell death. To better understand the molecular mechanisms that control cell death or survival, we investigated the role of TGF-beta1 in the apoptotic process by dominant-negative inhibition of both TGF-beta1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Murine macrophages (RAW 264.7) undergo apoptosis following serum deprivation, as determined by DNA laddering assay. However, apoptosis is prevented in serum-deprived macrophages by the presence of exogenous TGF-beta1. Using stably transfected RAW 264.7 cells with the kinase-deleted dominant-negative mutant of TbetaR-II (TbetaR-IIM) cDNA, we demonstrate that this protective effect by TGF-beta1 is completely abrogated. To determine the downstream signaling pathways, we examined TGF-beta1 effects on the MAPK pathway. We show that TGF-beta1 induces the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) activity in a time-dependent manner up to 4 h after stimulation. Furthermore, TGF-beta1 does not rescue serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with a dominant-negative mutant MAPK (ERK2) cDNA or in wild type RAW 264.7 cells in the presence of the MAPK kinase (MEK1) inhibitor. Taken together, our data demonstrate for the first time that TGF-beta1 is an inhibitor of apoptosis in cultured macrophages and may serve as a cell survival factor via TbetaR-II-mediated signaling and downstream intracellular MAPK signaling pathway."

AICD 1The abbreviations used are: AICD, activation-induced cell death; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated/extracellular receptor protein kinase kinase; PI, propidium iodide; IL-2, interleukin-2; TCR, T cell receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate.1The abbreviations used are: AICD, activation-induced cell death; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MEK, mitogen-activated/extracellular receptor protein kinase kinase; PI, propidium iodide; IL-2, interleukin-2; TCR, T cell receptor; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PMA, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. was first described in T cell hybridomas and is defined as apoptosis of lymphocytes by any signal that results in lymphocyte activation and, in particular, by stimulation of the TCR·CD3 complex (or B cell receptor complex) with antigens or antibodies (1Green D.R. Scott D.W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 476-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar, 2Ashwell J.D. Cunningham R.E. Noguchi P.D. Hernandez D. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 173-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). AICD is thought to play an important role in the deletion of (a) autoreactive T cell clones in the thymus (negative selection), (b) autoreactive T cells in the periphery with specificity for autoantigens that are not presented in the thymus (peripheral tolerance), and (c) activated T cells at the termination of an immune response (1Green D.R. Scott D.W. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1994; 6: 476-487Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that the expression and interaction of Fas and FasL, which results in autocrine stimulation of the Fas death pathway, is required for AICD of T hybridoma cells, Jurkat T leukemia cells, and activated T cells (3Russell J.H. Rush B. Weaver C. Wang R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4409-4413Crossref PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 4Dhein J. Walczak H. Bäumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H.

Recent studies have shown that the expression of FasL during AICD is dependent on an intact CD3-ζ chain and Lck, ZAP-70, CD45, calcineurin, and Ras activities (7Oyaizu N. Than S. McCloskey T.W.

However, negative selection in the thymus was not affected in lpr orgld mice, which are deficient in Fas and FasL expression (12Singer G.G. Abbas A.K. Immunity. 1994; 1: 365-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (703) Google Scholar), suggesting that the Fas pathway is not an absolute requirement for thymic negative selection. In T cells, stimulation of the TCR·CD3 complex results in activation of the Ras-Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway and, in combination with signals through the calcium/calcineurin pathway and the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway, leads to IL-2 production (reviewed in Ref. 13Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). T cell activation through the TCR·CD3 complex can be inhibited by dominant interfering Ras or dominant interfering Raf. ERK1/2 activity is also required for thymic positive selection in vivo, as demonstrated in mice expressing a dominant interfering form of Ras (14Swan K.A. Alberola-Ila J. Gross J.A. Appleby M.W. Forbush K.A. Thomas J.F. Perlmutter R.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (272) Google Scholar) or a dominant interfering form of MEK1 (15Alberola-Ila J. Forbush K.A. Seger R. Krebs E.G. Perlmutter R.M. Nature. 1995; 373: 620-623Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). ERK1 and -2 are proline-directed protein serine/threonine kinases that belong to the family of MAPKs and phosphorylate Ser/Thr-Pro motifs in various substrates (reviewed in Ref. 16Su B. Karin M. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 1996; 8: 402-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (712) Google Scholar). The ERK pathway can be activated by many stimuli, including growth factors (such as epidermal growth factor and nerve growth factor), cytokines (such as IL-2), antigen receptor stimulation (TCR), insulin, and v-Src expression. ERK1 and -2 are directly activated through dual phosphorylation of tyrosine and threonine residues in a conserved TEY motif by the specific protein MAPK kinases MEK1 and -2. MEK1 and -2 can be activated by the MAPK kinase kinase Raf. The initiation of this Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 cascade occurs through the recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane by the guanine nucleotide binding protein p21ras. Nur77 is an orphan nuclear steroid receptor (17Winoto A. Semin. Immunol. 1997; 9: 51-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) and is essential for AICD in T cell hybridomas and thymocytes, but not for IL-2 secretion (18Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 19Liu Z.-G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). To date, no ligand for Nur77 has been identified. Rapid Nur77 mRNA expression can be found 30 min after stimulation of T cell hybridoma cells with anti-CD3 antibody, which induces apoptotic DNA ladders as early as 4 h poststimulation (18Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar). In contrast, no Nur77 expression was found during dexamethasone-induced apoptosis or IL-2 withdrawal apoptosis of CTLL-20 cells (18Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 19Liu Z.-G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). A dominant-interfering truncated Nur77 or antisense Nur77 was capable of preventing AICD (but not IL-2 production) after TCR stimulation of T cell hybridomas (18Woronicz J.D. Calnan B. Ngo V. Winoto A. Nature. 1994; 367: 277-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (504) Google Scholar, 19Liu Z.-G. Smith S.W. McLaughlin K.A. Schwartz L.M. Osborne B.A. Nature. 1994; 367: 281-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar). In this study, we define a role for the ERK pathway in AICD and demonstrate its requirement in the up-regulation of FasL and expression of Nur77.

Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1149-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. Barbara Osborne (University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA). The human T cell leukemia line Jurkat was a gift of Dr. Paul Anderson (Dana Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, MA). Jurkat-16 and Jurkat-77 are subclones of the Jurkat cell line and were kindly provided by Dr. Jannie Borst (J16; Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) (4Dhein J. Walczak H.

The murine B cell hybridoma cell line LK 35.2 (23Kappler J. White J. Wegman D. Mustain E. Marrack P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3604-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar) was obtained from Dr. Christoph Klein (Children's Hospital, Boston). All cell lines were grown in RPMI 1640 containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 2 mml-glutamine. Cells (5 × 106/ml) were washed twice with PBS and incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated with 0.1% Triton X-100 (in PBS) for 2 min at room temperature, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% azide for 10 min at 4 °C. Subsequently, cells were incubated with anti-FasL-PE antibody for 30 min at 4 °C, washed with PBS (with bovine serum albumin and azide), and analyzed with a flow cytometer. In vitro kinase assays and Western blot analyses were performed as described by Hibi et al. (24Hibi M. Lin A. Smeal T. Minden A. Karin M. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 2135-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (1697) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, after freezing at −70 °C, cell pellets were lysed for 20 min on ice with 50 μl of lysis buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm vanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. The lysate was cleared by high speed centrifugation (13,000 rpm for 10 min) and diluted at 1:3 with equilibration buffer consisting of 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mmvanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 2 μg/ml leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin. Forin vitro kinase assays, the lysate was incubated for 3 h at 4 °C with anti-ERK1 antibodies (5 μl) and protein A-Sepharose beads (30 μl of 50% slurry; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The precipitates were washed twice with wash buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 0.05 m NaCl, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 0.1 mm vanadate; twice with high salt buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.5 m LiCl, and 0.1 mm vanadate; twice with low salt buffer containing 10 mm Tris (pH 7.5), 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, and 0.1 mm vanadate; and finally resuspended in wash buffer. The precipitate was then incubated for 20 min at 30 °C with 3 μg of myelin basic protein and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 2× kinase buffer containing 20 mm Hepes (pH 7.5), 20 mm MgCl2, 0.03 mm ATP, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm vanadate. The reaction was stopped with 4× Laemmli sample buffer. The reaction mixtures (for in vitro kinase assays) or lysates (for Western blot analysis) were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then developed by autoradiography (for in vitro kinase assays) or blocked with 5% nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline, probed with primary antibody followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and developed by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (for Western blot analysis). For cross-linking experiments, cell culture dishes were coated overnight at 4 °C with anti-CD3 or anti-TCR (1–10 μg/ml) antibodies. Cells (106/ml) were exposed to an apoptotic stimulus and incubated at 37 °C and 5% CO2. Apoptotic cells were analyzed by flow cytometry after staining with hypotonic propidium iodide (PI) solution as described previously (25Nicoletti I. Migliorati G. Pagliacci M.C. Grignani F. Riccardi C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1991; 139: 271-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (4400) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 105) were incubated for 10 min at 4 °C in the dark with 200 μl of hypotonic buffer containing 0.1% (w/v) sodium citrate, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 50 μg/ml propidium iodide. The cell suspension was then analyzed by flow cytometry, and the subdiploid peak (which represents apoptotic nuclei undergoing DNA fragmentation) was measured to determine the percentage of apoptotic cells. FasL functional activity was determined by the ability of FasL expressing cells to induce apoptosis in Fas+ LK 35.2 target cells as described previously (6Ju S.-T. Panka D.J. Cui H. Ettinger R. el-Khatib M. Sherr D.H. Stanger B.Z Marshak-Rothstein A. Nature. 1995; 373: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). Briefly, 5 × 106 LK 35.2 cells were labeled for 1 h at 37 °C with 20 μCi 51Cr, washed three times, and resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium with 10% fetal calf serum. T cell hybridomas or Jurkat cells were incubated (105cells/well) for 3 h at 37 °C in anti-CD3-coated 96-well plates before 51Cr-labeled LK 35.2 target cells (104cells) were added. Some cells received only 51Cr-labeled LK35.2 cells and anti-Fas antibodies (Jo2; 5 μg/ml). After an additional 8-h incubation, 100 μl of supernatant was removed from each well and counted in a γ-counter to determine experimental release. Spontaneous release was obtained from wells receiving target cells and medium only, whereas total release was obtained from wells receiving 1% Triton X-100. The percentage of specific lysis was calculated with the following formula: percentage of lysis = 100 × ((experimental release − spontaneous release)/(total release − spontaneous release)). In transient transfection experiments, J16 (107) cells were electroporated at 800 microfarads/250 V using a Life Technologies, Inc. electroporator. Cells received 10 μg of control plasmid in addition to 10 μg of a FasL promoter-luciferase reporter construct, 20 μg of experimental construct, and 0.2 μg of pRL-TK to normalize for transfection efficiency. Subsequently, cells were incubated for 18 h at 37 °C and stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA; 10 ng/ml) plus ionomycin (2 μm) or plate-bound anti-CD3 (1 μg/ml) as described above. After 6 h, luciferase activity was measured with a luminometer according to the manufacturer's instructions (Analytical Luminescence, San Diego, CA). We performed all of our experiments in two T cell lines that are widely used for the study of AICD in T cells: the murine T cell hybridoma DO11.10, which expresses a TCR specific for OVA323–339, a peptide derived from chicken ovalbumin (22Haskins K. Kubo R. White J. Pigeon M. Kappler J. Marrack P. J. Exp. Med. 1983; 157: 1149-1169Crossref PubMed Scopus (692) Google Scholar), and the human T cell leukemia line Jurkat-16 (a variant of the Jurkat cell line) (4Dhein J. Walczak H. Bäumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). TCR·CD3 cross-linking leads to AICD in both cell lines, whereas Jurkat-16 cells also undergo apoptosis upon Fas cross-linking. In addition, we used in some experiments regular Jurkat cells, which were only sensitive to Fas-mediated apoptosis, or Jurkat-77 cells, which do not undergo AICD upon TCR·CD3 stimulation and are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. We first determined if the ERK pathway is being activated during TCR·CD3-mediated AICD as has been described for TCR·CD3-mediated activation, proliferation, and IL-2 production (13Cantrell D. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1996; 14: 259-274Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK1 and -2 requires phosphorylation of specific tyrosine and threonine residues, and we therefore assessed tyrosine phosphorylation of ERK1 and -2 after CD3 cross-linking in DO11.10 cells by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with an antibody that specifically recognizes tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1 and -2 (tyrosine 204). Maximal phosphorylation of (mostly) ERK2 occurred 15 min after CD3 cross-linking, but ERK1 and -2 remained phosphorylated at later time points (Fig. 1 A) up to 6 h (data not shown). Expression of ERK1 and -2 was determined by immunoblotting with anti-ERK antibodies, and expression levels were unaffected by CD3 cross-linking. We also determined with an in vitro kinase assay that the phosphorylation of ERK1 and -2 (Fig.1 A) correlated with the induction of ERK activity during AICD (Fig. 1 B). Subsequently, we analyzed ERK1 and -2 phosphorylation after CD3 cross-linking in two Jurkat subclones: J16 (sensitive to AICD and Fas-mediated apoptosis) and J77 (resistant to AICD and Fas-mediated apoptosis). We found that the kinetics of ERK1 and -2 phosphorylation in these two cell lines was identical (Fig.1 C) and demonstrated a similar pattern as found in DO11.10 cells. All three cell lines demonstrated maximal phosphorylation at 15 min of predominantly ERK2. These data make it unlikely that the kinetics of ERK phosphorylation can account for the differences in susceptibility to AICD seen in these cell lines. We then determined if a widely used specific inhibitor of the ERK pathway, MEK1 inhibitor PD98059, could inhibit ERK activation during AICD. PD98059 binds to the inactive form of MEK1 and prevents its activation by upstream activators. This inhibitor has been shown to act as a highly selective inhibitor of the activation of MEK1 in the ERK pathway (26Dudley D.T. Pang L. Decker S.J. Bridges A.J. Saltiel A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7686-7689Crossref PubMed Scopus (2581) Google Scholar, 27Alessi D.R. Cuenda A. Cohen P. Dudley D.T. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27489-27494Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3241) Google Scholar). PD98059 inhibits activation and phosphorylation of MEK1 by either c-Raf or MEKK1 with IC50values of 5–10 μm but inhibits the activation of MEK2 by c-Raf less potently with an IC50 of 50 μm. In all experiments, cells were pretreated with 50 μm of PD98059 for 30 min at 37 °C. We found that pretreatment with the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 prevented phosphorylation and activation of ERK1 and -2 completely for at least 2 h after CD3 cross-linking (Fig.1, A and B). However, phosphorylation and activation of ERK1 and -2 after PMA and ionomycin stimulation was only diminished and not completely inhibited. This partial inhibition could be due to incomplete inhibition of MEK2 by PD98059 or could be the result of an alternative pathway for ERK phosphorylation, which does not involve MEK1 and 2 and/or is not affected by PD98059. Similar results were obtained with Jurkat-16 cells (data not shown). We also determined the effect of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 on the activation of MEK1 upon CD3 stimulation in J16 cells with an antibody that specifically recognizes serine phosphorylation of MEK1 and -2 (serines 217 and 221). Maximal phosphorylation of MEK1/2 occurred after 5 min and could be partially inhibited by the MEK1 inhibitor (Fig. 1 D). The incomplete inhibition of MEK1/2 phosphorylation was probably due to the less potent effect of the MEK1 inhibitor against MEK2 activation as described above. The up-regulation of FasL has been identified as an essential step in TCR·CD3-mediated apoptosis in both cell lines (DO11.10 and Jurkat-16) and, in general, during AICD (4Dhein J. Walczak H. Bäumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar, 5Brunner T. Mogil R.J. LaFace D. Yoo N.J. Mahboubi A. Echeverri F. Martin S.J.

Stanger B.Z Marshak-Rothstein A. Nature. 1995; 373: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). We confirmed the requirement of the Fas/FasL interaction during AICD by inhibiting AICD of DO11.10 T cell hybridomas with Fas-IgFc fusion protein (data not shown). Fas-IgFc binds to FasL and prevents its interaction with the Fas receptor (6Ju S.-T. Panka D.J. Cui H. Ettinger R. el-Khatib M. Sherr D.H. Stanger B.Z Marshak-Rothstein A. Nature. 1995; 373: 444-448Crossref PubMed Scopus (1450) Google Scholar). To evaluate the role of the ERK pathway in the regulation of FasL expression during AICD, we co-transfected the human FasL promotor coupled to a luciferase reporter construct along with either a dominant interfering form or a constitutively active form of MEK1, the upstream activator of ERK, in Jurkat-16 cells. CD3 cross-linking resulted in FasL promotor activation, and cotransfection of a dominant-interfering form of MEK1 could inhibit this activation by almost 50% (Fig.2 A). Cotransfection of a constitutively active MEK1 construct led to a 4–5-fold increase in FasL promotor activation in unstimulated cells and a further 6.5-fold increase in FasL promotor activation upon CD3 cross-linking. These results indicate that MEK1 activity can regulate FasL expression during AICD. We further studied the role of MEK1 (and the ERK pathway) in FasL expression during AICD with the use of the MEK1 inhibitor PD98059. As shown in Fig. 2 B, pretreatment of Jurkat-16 cells with the MEK1 inhibitor could inhibit FasL promotor activation upon CD3 cross-linking. This result confirms our finding with transient transfection of MEK1 constructs that MEK1 activity is required for FasL up-regulation during AICD. Subsequently, we studied the regulation of FasL expression and activity by MEK1 during AICD. We first determined FasL expression by flow cytometric analysis after intracytoplasmic staining with anti-FasL antibodies. We could not detect any FasL in unstimulated cells (<1%), whereas a 4-h incubation with anti-CD3 resulted in 13% positive cells. Pretreatment of the cells with Me2SO (drug vehicle as control) had no effect on the induction of FasL expression (13% positive cells), whereas pretreatment with the MEK1 inhibitor completely prevented expression of FasL (<1% positive cells) (Fig.3 A). We then determined the induction of FasL activity in a cytolytic assay with 51Cr-labeled Fas-sensitive target cells (6Ju S.-T. Panka D.J. Cui H. Ettinger R. el-Khatib M. Sherr D.H.

This assay measures FasL activity of the effector cells (DO11.10) by their capability to lyse Fas-sensitive target cells (B cell hybridoma LK 35.2). We found that CD3 cross-linking of DO11.10 cells resulted in the induction of FasL activity, which indicates that DO11.10 cells up-regulate their FasL cell surface expression upon CD3·TCR activation (Fig. 3 B). We confirmed the specificity of this assay by demonstrating that preincubation of CD3-stimulated DO11.10 cells with FasIgFc could inhibit the lysis of the Fas-sensitive target cells (data not shown). Pretreatment of the DO11.10 cells with the MEK1 inhibitor abolished the induction of FasL activity after CD3 cross-linking (Fig. 3 B). The use of the MEK1 inhibitor in cell cultures allowed us to test the role of the ERK pathway in CD3-mediated apoptosis assays. Pretreatment of DO11.10 cells with PD98059 resulted in partial inhibition and a 2–4-h delay in the onset of AICD (Fig.4 A). Because PD98059 is only effective for a few hours in cell cultures (see Fig. 1, Aand B), we determined if a second addition of the inhibitor would result in a stronger effect. Indeed, the inhibitory effect of PD98059 on AICD of DO11.10 cells could be prolonged and enhanced by a second treatment with PD98059 4 h after the initial treatment (Fig. 4 B). We repeated these experiments with Jurkat-16 cells and also found inhibition of AICD after pretreatment with MEK1 inhibitor (Fig. 4 C). These results suggest that inhibition of the ERK pathway leads to a marked inhibition of AICD. The inhibitory effect of PD98059 on AICD was confirmed in similar experiments with another murine T cell hybridoma cell line A1.1 (data not shown). To better evaluate the role of the ERK cascade in the more distal Fas-mediated component of the AICD pathway, we studied Fas-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells that resulted from Fas cross-linking (4Dhein J. Walczak H. Bäumler C. Debatin K.-M. Krammer P.H. Nature. 1995; 373: 438-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (1603) Google Scholar). We assessed the phosphorylation of ERK1 and -2 during Fas-mediated apoptosis of Jurkat cells by Western blot analysis of whole cell lysates with antibodies against tyrosine-phosphorylated ERK1 and -2. Only very weak, unsustained phosphorylation of ERK2 was found 2 h after Fas cross-linking (Fig.5 A). In addition, we determined activation of ERK1 and 2 after Fas cross-linking of Jurkat cells by in vitro kinase assays. These results were comparable with the analysis of ERK phosphorylation by Western blotting. Very little ERK activation was seen a"

Here we describe the isolation and characterization of an interacting protein, APS, which contains pleckstrin homology and Src homology 2 domains and several potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites. APS mRNA and protein are expressed primarily in skeletal muscle, heart, and adipose tissue, and in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We show that APS associates with phosphotyrosines situated within the activation loop of the insulin receptor via the APS Src homology 2 domain. Insulin stimulation of 3T3-L1 adipocytes resulted in rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous APS on tyrosine 618, whereas platelet-derived growth factor treatment resulted in no APS phosphorylation. In summary, we have identified a new insulin receptor substrate that is primarily expressed in insulin-responsive tissues and in 3T3-L1 adipocytes whose phosphorylation shows insulin receptor specificity. These findings suggest a potential role for APS in insulin-regulated metabolic signaling pathways.

These findings suggest a potential role for APS in insulin-regulated metabolic signaling pathways. Insulin binding to its receptor results in tyrosine autophosphorylation of the β-subunit. This results in an active insulin receptor that is able to phosphorylate several cytoplasmic proteins on tyrosine residues. The tyrosine-phosphorylated insulin receptor interacts with downstream docking proteins that appear to be essential for insulin signaling. Phosphorylation of these adapter proteins induces their association with proteins containing SH2 1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology domain 2; IR, insulin receptor; APS, adapter protein containing a PH and SH2 domain; PH, pleckstrin homology; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PDK1, PIP3-dependent protein kinase 1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; kbp, kilobase pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.1The abbreviations used are: SH2, Src homology domain 2; IR, insulin receptor; APS, adapter protein containing a PH and SH2 domain; PH, pleckstrin homology; IRS, insulin receptor substrate; PI3K, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; PIP3, phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate; PDK1, PIP3-dependent protein kinase 1; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; PVDF, polyvinylidene difluoride; kbp, kilobase pair(s); PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. domains, resulting in activation of a variety of downstream signaling pathways. Examples of such adapter proteins include the insulin receptor substrates (IRS) 1, 2, 3, and 4 and the SHC proto-oncogene product. These adapter proteins appear to link the insulin receptor to at least two signaling pathways, the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. It remains unclear whether these adapters constitute the full complement of signaling intermediates utilized by the insulin receptor. In fact, much recent evidence has begun to accumulate to suggest that the known signaling pathways that emanate from the IR may be insufficient to fully explain insulin-mediated metabolic regulation, and in particular the regulation of GLUT4 translocation. One of the most important signaling pathways that appears to be required for many metabolic effects of insulin is the activation of PI3K. Binding of the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K to tyrosine-phosphorylated IRS proteins leads to activation of the lipid kinase activity of the p110 catalytic subunit of this enzyme (1Myers M.G. Backer J.M. Sun X.J. Shoelson S.E. Hu P. Schlessinger J. Yoakim M. Schaffhausen B. White M.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The metabolic effects of insulin that require PI3K activity include GLUT4 translocation, glucose uptake, activation of fatty acid synthase and glycogen synthase, and stimulation of amino acid transport and protein synthesis (3Cheatham B.

All of these actions were inhibited either by pharmacological inhibitors of PI3K or by expression of dominant negative mutants of PI3K (3Cheatham B. Vlahos C.J. Cheatham L. Wang L. Blenis J.

For example, introduction of a dominant negative form of the p85 subunit that cannot interact with the p110 catalytic subunit completely inhibited activation of PI3K in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in response to insulin. This prevented GLUT4 translocation, suggesting that PI3K activity was necessary for GLUT4 translocation (8Morris A.J. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Gustafson T.A. Mueckler M.

This block was successfully reversed by the co-expression of a constitutively active p110 subunit, which by itself possessed the ability to promote GLUT4 translocation in transiently transfected primary rat adipocytes and suggested that PI3K activity may be sufficient for GLUT4 translocation (11Katagiri H.

Several downstream targets of PI3K such as PKB (also termed AKT) and p70S6 kinase may play important roles in mediating PI3K-dependent metabolic signaling. Stimulation of the serine/threonine protein kinase PKB required the prior activation of PI3K, due in part to a direct interaction of the PKB PH domain with the secondary lipid messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-phosphate (PIP3), which is believed to cause a conformational change that allows subsequent phosphorylation of PKB by multiple upstream kinases. In this regard, PKB becomes phosphorylated upon threonine 308 and serine 473 in response to insulin stimulation (14Alessi D.R. Andejelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2511) Google Scholar). One of these upstream kinases, PIP3-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1), has been cloned and characterized and shown to phosphorylate threonine 308 and thus activate PKB (15Alessi D.R. James S.R. Downes C.P.

The PDK1 kinase also contains a PH domain that is believed to mediate its interaction with the plasma membrane in a phosphoinositide-dependent manner. Studies in which a constitutively active PKB was targeted to the plasma membrane using the Src myristoylation signal have demonstrated that, in the absence of insulin stimulation, glucose uptake and GLUT4 translocation were enhanced (17Kohn A.D. Summers S.A. Birnbaum M.J. Roth R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31372-31378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1089) Google Scholar, 18Tanti J.F. Grillo S. Gremeaux T. Coffer P.J. Van Obberghen E. Le Marchand-Brustel Y. Endocrinology. 1997; 138: 2005-2010Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data support a role for PI3K and PKB in the regulation of GLUT4 translocation. However, whether activation of either PI3K or PKB is sufficient for the maximal stimulation of GLUT4 translocation by insulin remains controversial. Studies designed to address these questions have yielded contradictory results. In a series of studies, adenoviral-mediated expression of either a constitutively activated form of p110 or a form of p110 that was targeted to GLUT4 vesicles in 3T3-L1 adipocytes was analyzed. These manipulations resulted in PI3K activities that exceeded insulin-stimulated levels and increased GLUT4 translocation and glucose transport, yet these effects were significantly reduced when compared with insulin (19Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 20Frevert E.U. Bjorbaek C. Venable C.L. Keller S.R. Kahn B.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25480-25487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In other experiments, PI3K was activated in 3T3-L1 adipocytes using thiophosphorylated peptides corresponding to the binding motif of PI3K within IRS1; again, only a modest increase in GLUT4 translocation was observed (21Herbst J.J. Andrews G.C. Contillo L.G. Singleton D.H. Genereux P.E. Gibbs E.M. Lienhard G.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 270: 26000-26005Google Scholar). Other studies have shown that, although growth factors such as PDGF can activate PI3K activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, this is not sufficient to stimulate significant GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane (22Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 23Wiese R.J. Mastick C.C. Lazar D.F. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3442-3446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). In other experiments, interleukin-4 stimulation of L6 myoblasts overexpressing the interleukin-4 receptor induced IRS1 tyrosine phosphorylation and increased PI3K activity to the same degree as insulin but had no effect upon glucose uptake (22Isakoff S.J. Taha C. Rose E. Marcusohn J. Klip A. Skolnik E.Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 10247-10251Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). More recently, a mutant PKB protein in which the regulatory phosphorylation sites were substituted with alanine was shown to exert a dominant negative effect on endogenous PKB activity stimulated by insulin. Expression of this dominant negative PKB in 3T3-L1 adipocytes had no effect on insulin-induced glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation but was found to decrease the rate of protein synthesis and inhibit the ability of insulin to activate p70S6 kinase (24Kitamura T. Ogawa W. Sakaue H. Hino Y. Kuroda S. Takata M. Matsumoto M. Maeda T. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3708-3717Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). These data strongly suggest that PKB may not be necessary for insulin-dependent GLUT4 translocation. More recently it was found that introduction of membrane-permeant esters of PIP3into 3T3-L1 adipocytes by themselves did not stimulate glucose uptake or GLUT4 translocation to the plasma membrane. However, these esters were able to reverse the wortmannin blockade of insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (25Jiang T. Sweeney G. Rudolf M.T. Klip A. Traynor-Kaplan A. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 11017-11024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). This suggests that PIP3 is necessary but not sufficient and raises the possibility that additional signaling pathways may originate from the insulin receptor to mediate the full response. In other experiments, microinjection of competitive inhibitory IRS1 proteins, which effectively blocked the interaction of the IR with endogenous IRS-1, had no effect upon GLUT4 translocation or glucose uptake in response to insulin (8Morris A.J. Martin S.S. Haruta T. Nelson J.G. Vollenweider P. Gustafson T.A. Mueckler M. Rose D.W. Olefsky J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 8401-8406Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). These same proteins blocked insulin-dependent membrane ruffling and mitogenesis, suggesting that IRS-1 was critical for some insulin actions but not for GLUT4 translocation. In summary, the current data strongly support an essential role for PI3K in the regulation of glucose uptake by insulin. However, the data from a variety of studies outlined above suggest the possibility that other signaling pathways may exist that emanate specifically from the insulin receptor that are responsible for the full metabolic response of a muscle or adipose cell to insulin. In this paper we report the cloning of mouse APS, which was shown to interact strongly with the insulin receptor. APS mRNA and protein were expressed predominantly in skeletal muscle, heart, fat, and 3T3-L1 adipocytes. The SH2 domain of APS interacted with the activation loop of the kinase domain of the insulin receptor. Endogenous APS becomes robustly tyrosine-phosphorylated on tyrosine 618 after insulin treatment of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. These results are suggestive of a physiological role for APS in insulin signaling in the insulin-responsive tissues muscle and fat. CHO-IR cells overexpressing the human insulin receptor (26Ebina Y.

Differentiation to adipocytes was induced as described previously (9Haruta T. Morris A.J. Rose D.W. Nelson J.G. Mueckler M. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol.

The cells were then cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics for 8–12 days. Before growth factor stimulation the cells were serum-starved for 2–18 h. Unless otherwise indicated, 100 nm insulin was added directly to the medium and the incubation was continued at 37 °C for the indicated times. Full-length and subdomains of APS were subcloned into either the two-hybrid plasmid pEG202, the mammalian expression plasmid, pcDNA3.1His (Invitrogen), pGEX5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), or pET28 (Novagen) using standard methods.

Plasmid transformation of yeast was by the lithium acetate method (32Schiestl R.H. Gietz R.D. Curr. Genet. 1989; 16: 339-346Crossref PubMed Scopus (1773) Google Scholar). The insulin receptor and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor cDNA fusions have been reported previously (30O'Neill T.J. Craparo A. Gustafson T.A. Mol. Cell.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6433-6442Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). A 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA was generated with the ZAP cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) and subcloned in the pJG4–5 library vector. Northern blot analysis was performed on commercial human and rat multiple tissue poly(A)+ RNA blots (CLONTECH), or, purified poly(A)+ RNA prepared from either 3T3-L1 fibroblasts or adipocytes. For the Northern blots shown in Fig. 2, probes were generated by polymerase chain reaction and labeled by nick translation. Hybridization was performed overnight at 60 °C in 15% formamide, 1% bovine serum albumin, 0.5m sodium phosphate (pH 7.2), 7% SDS, 100 μmEDTA, and 50 μg ml−1 denatured salmon sperm DNA with high stringency washes. A GST fusion protein was generated by introducing the APS cDNA fragment corresponding to the SH2 domain (amino acids 408–507) into the pGEX5X expression plasmid. After transformation of DH5α, induction with 1 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside, cell collection, and lysis by sonication, the proteins were purified using immobilized glutathione-agarose beads. Serum-starved cultured CHO-IR cells were stimulated with 100 nm insulin for 0, 5, 15, or 30 min at 37 °C, washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS, and solubilized with lysis buffer (1× PBS supplemented with 1% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml each of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 10 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate). The samples were homogenized and clarified by centrifugation, and incubated (500 μg of total protein/reaction) for 2 h at 4 °C with 3–5 μg of immobilized GST fusion protein. After extensive washing with ice-cold HNTG buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol), the proteins co-associating with the GST fusion proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and immunoblotted as described below with either anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 or antibodies against the β subunit of the insulin receptor. CHO-IR cells were transiently transfected with 5 μg of the various APS constructs subcloned in the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1His (Invitrogen) by LipofectAMINE according to manufacturer's instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.). After 48 h, the cells were serum-starved overnight and then stimulated by the addition of 100 nm insulin for 5 min. Lysates were prepared as described under “Immunoprecipitation and Immunoblots.” Cells treated as described under “Results and Discussion” were washed twice with ice-cold 1× PBS and then lysed in 1 ml of lysis buffer. After a 30-min centrifugation at 4 °C to remove the insoluble material, proteins of interest were immunoprecipitated with either mouse monoclonal antibodies or rabbit polyclonal antibodies coupled to protein A/G-Sepharose (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) during a 2–3-h incubation at 4 °C with constant mixing. The immune complexes were washed three times with ice-cold HNTG buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to PVDF membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in TBST buffer (Tris·HCl, pH 7.4, NaCl, 0.01% Tween 40) containing 5% nonfat dry milk and blotted with specific antibodies in TBST containing 5% bovine serum albumin for 2 to 3 h. Immunoreactive bands were detected by ECL immunodetection system (Pierce). Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY), anti-insulin receptor antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-XPRESS mouse monoclonal was purchased from Invitrogen. Fusion protein was produced in Escherichia coli from a pGEX5X (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) expression plasmid containing the COOH domain (amino acids 508–591) of APS. The GST fusion protein was purified by standard procedures. Immunizing rabbits with the purified GST fusion raised anti-APS antisera. Protein assays were performed by modified Lowry method (33Peterson G.L. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 83: 346-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (7127) Google Scholar). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed as described by Laemmli (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207002) Google Scholar). To be able to identify new substrates of the insulin receptor that may be important components in metabolic signaling pathways, we carried out a yeast two-hybrid screen with the cytoplasmic domain of the human insulin receptor as bait and searched for interacting proteins within a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library. Of 4 × 106 transformants, 90 colonies showed specific interaction with the insulin receptor. Sequence analysis of the rescued plasmids revealed that 17 encoded a recently identified adapter protein termed APS (adapter protein containing PH and SH2 domain). The sequence of the longest clone contained an insert of 2832 base pairs. Analysis of potential coding sequences suggested a protein of 621 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 66,553. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence revealed a PH domain encoded by amino acids 197–299 and an SH2 domain between amino acids 408 and 507. Two potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites were located at amino acids 46 (NPXY) and 618 (ENQY). Alignment of the mouse APS amino acid sequence with the published human and a partial rat cDNA (that we also cloned in an insulin receptor two-hybrid screen with a skeletal muscle library) revealed that there was significant conservation between species (Fig. 1). The only marked difference between these proteins was within the amino-terminal domain where two short stretches are missing from the mouse: amino acids 12- 16 (APVPV), amino acids 84–89 (GPTTRG) of the human APS, and one short stretch missing from the human: amino acids 161–164 (PASE) of mouse APS. APS is a recently described protein whose function is unknown. APS was first described to interact with an oncogenic mutant of the tyrosine kinase receptor, c-Kit (35Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Activation of immunoreceptor signaling induced tyrosine phosphorylation of APS in response to a variety of cytokines including stem cell factor. As reported previously, APS is similar to but not identical to SH2B and LNK (35Yokouchi M. Suzuki R. Masuhara M. Komiya S. Inoue A. Yoshimura Y. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The PH domains of SH2B and LNK are 58% and 40% identical to APS, whereas the SH2 domains of SH2B and LNK are more similar with 80% and 72% identity, respectively. The LNK protein that has been reported may not represent the complete cDNA or may be a result of alternative splicing or start codon usage. Comparison of the remaining sequences of the three proteins outside either the PH or SH2 domain showed little sequence similarity. However, one of the potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites at the carboxyl terminus of APS, tyrosine 618, is conserved in both SH2B (amino acid 753) and LNK (amino acid 297). SH2B was originally cloned from mast cells because of its ability to bind in a yeast tribrid system to the tyrosyl-phosphorylated γ subunit of the high affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor (36Osborne M.A. Dalton S. Kochan J.P. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1474-1478Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). SH2B has also been reported to bind to tyrosine-phosphorylated JAK2 upon growth hormone stimulation of 3T3-F442A adipocytes (37Rui L. Mathews L.S. Hotta K. Gustafson T.A. Carter-Su C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 6633-6644Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These data suggest that growth hormone activation of JAK2 recruits SH2B, thereby initiating an as-yet-unidentified signal transduction pathway. The second family member, LNK, is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon T-lymphocyte activation by antibody-mediated cross-linking of the T cell receptor and CD4. LNK has been suggested to provide a link between the activated T cell receptor and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase Cγ1, and Ras signaling pathways through a multifunctional tyrosine phosphorylation site within the protein (38Huang X.

Thus, APS, SH2B, and LNK appear to be a family of adapter molecules involved in tyrosine kinase signaling in hematopoietic cells. To determine the tissue distribution of APS mRNA, both human and rat multiple tissue Northern blots were hybridized with a probe generated against the SH2 domain of APS. Two APS mRNA transcripts were detected with tissue specificity and variation in their relative abundance (Fig.2 A). The transcripts were approximately 1.9 and 2.9 kbp in size. Both were expressed with equal intensity in poly(A)+mRNA prepared from either rat or human skeletal muscle. However, the lower RNA band of approximate 1.9 kbp was absent in other tissues examined. The significance of the multiple mRNA bands remains to be determined. Since the full-length APS cDNA was isolated from a 3T3-L1 adipocyte cDNA library, we examined the expression of APS mRNA in 3T3-L1 cells. Northern blot analysis of poly(A)+ RNA isolated from fibroblasts and fully differentiated adipocytes was performed with a cDNA probe encoding the SH2 domain of APS. As shown in Fig.2 B, a transcript of 2.9 kbp was observed in RNA prepared from both fibroblasts and adipocytes. This corresponds well to the size of the full-length cDNAs that we identified in the two-hybrid assay, the longest of which was 2833 base pairs. APS mRNA expression was highest in the adipocytes. The blot was stripped and rehybridized with a GLUT4 probe. In agreement with published data, GLUT4 expression is up-regulated in response to differentiation of the fibroblasts. To further examine the interaction of APS and the insulin receptor, we produced a GST fusion protein that contained the SH2 domain of APS (amino acids 408–507). We examined the ability of this GST fusion protein to interact with proteins in lysates derived from unstimulated or insulin-stimulated CHO cells that overexpress the insulin receptor. After incubation of the immobilized GST protein with cellular extracts, the samples were extensively washed and the coprecipitating proteins were analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with an anti-insulin receptor antibody (Fig. 3 A,upper panel). The blots were then stripped and reblotted with an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Fig. 3 A,lower panel). GST-SH2 APS fusion protein precipitated the insulin receptor from these lysates in a time-dependent manner. The coprecipitation was dependent upon prior stimulation of the insulin receptor, as shown by the lack of association between these two proteins in unstimulated lysates. Recent work has suggested that the SH2 domain of SH2B, an APS-related protein,"

Several unique structural features within LIM kinase were investigated for their roles in regulation of LIM kinase activity. Disruption of the second LIM domain or the PDZ domain or deletion of the entire amino terminus increased activity in vivo measured as increasing aggregation of the actin cytoskeleton. A kinase-deleted alternate splice product was identified and characterized. This alternate splice product and a kinase inactive mutant inhibited LIM kinase in vivo, indicating that the amino terminus suppresses activity of the kinase domain. Mutation of threonine 508 in the activation loop to valine abolished activity whereas replacement with 2 glutamic acid residues resulted in a fully active enzyme. Dephosphorylation of LIM kinase inhibited cofilin phosphorylation. Mutation of the basic insert in the activation loop inhibited activity in vivo, but not in vitro. These results indicate phosphorylation is an essential regulatory feature of LIM kinase and indicate that threonine 508 and the adjacent basic insert sequences of the activation loop are required for this process. A combination of structural features are thus involved in receiving upstream signals that regulate LIM kinase-induced actin cytoskeletal reorganization.

Full-Text PDF Open Access Many protein kinases contain modular domains that regulate catalytic activity, direct localization to specific compartments of the cell, and dictate interactions with other components of signal transduction complexes (1Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). There are 2 identified LIM kinase family members that each contain 2 amino-terminal LIM domains, a central PDZ domain, and a carboxyl-terminal kinase domain with predominant serine/threonine kinase activity (2Bernard O.

During mouse development LIM kinase is expressed early in neuroectoderm, cardiac mesoderm, and gut endoderm and later predominantly in brain (5Cheng A.K. Robertson E.J. Mech.

Cofilin has been identified as a functionally important substrate for LIM kinase and evidence has been provided that LIM kinase regulates actin dynamics by phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin (9Arber S.

Actin-depolymerizing factor/cofilamentous protein (cofilin) which binds to both F-actin and actin monomers (11Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Ohba M. Seki M. Kumagai H. Sakai H. Eur. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1165-1168Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). It binds more tightly to ADP-actin than to ATP-actin and enhances the off rate of actin monomers at the pointed end of fibers (15Carlier M.F. Laurent V. Santolini J. Melki R. Didry D. Xia G.X. Hong Y. Chua N.H. Pantaloni D. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 136: 1307-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (837) Google Scholar). At pH 8.0 and above, cofilin depolymerizes actin stoichiometrically (16Hawkins M. Pope B. Maciver S.K. Weeds A.G. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9985-9993Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar, 17Yonezawa N. Nishida E. Sakai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 14410-14412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This is essential to actin dynamics necessary for cell motility, cytokinesis, and other cell processes (18Gunsalus K.C.

Cofilin exists in both a phospho and dephospho form, with phosphorylation inhibiting the actin filament severing activity (21Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 22Moriyama K. Iida K. Yahara I. Genes Cells. 1996; 1: 73-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Ser3 is the principal inhibitory phosphorylation site in cofilin and previous studies indicated it was a poor substrate for known kinases including protein kinase C, cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase, myosin light chain kinase, and CaM kinase II (21Morgan T.E. Lockerbie R.O. Minamide L.S. Browning M.D. Bamburg J.R. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 623-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). By using dominant negative forms of LIM kinase and constitutively active forms of Rac, Arber et al. (9Arber S. Barbayannis F. Hanser H. Schneider C. Stanyon C. Bernard O. Caroni P. Nature. 1998; 393: 805-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (1165) Google Scholar) and Yang et al. (10Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) deduced that LIM kinase is the downstream effector of Rac-dependent actin cytoskeleton changes. Because activated Rac did not interact directly with LIM kinase, Rac regulation of LIM kinase activity must involve intermediate biochemical steps. The kinase domain of LIM kinase contains significant sequence variations compared with other serine/threonine kinases in the ATP-binding site (subdomain VIB) (23Hanks S.K. Quinn A.M. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 200: 38-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (1082) Google Scholar), the substrate-binding region of subdomain VIII and in the presence of an 11-amino acid basic insert in the activation loop between subdomains VII and VIII (2Bernard O. Ganiatsas S. Kannourakis G. Dringen R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1159-1171PubMed Google Scholar, 3Mizuno K. Okano I. Ohashi K. Nunoue K. Kuma K. Miyata T. Nakamura T.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31321-31330Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Although the sequence of the LIM domains of LIM kinase more closely resemble those of nuclear LIM homeodomain and LIM-only proteins than those of cytoplasmic proteins (24Dawid I.B. Toyama R. Taira M. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Ser. III. 1995; 318: 295-306PubMed Google Scholar), the LIM domains of LIM kinase do not recognize the nuclear LIM interactor that binds nuclear LIM domains with high affinity (25Jurata L.W. Kenny D.A. Gill G.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11693-11698Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). The predominant cytoplasmic localization of LIM kinase (2Bernard O. Ganiatsas S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 31321-31330Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) and its ability to bind actin (10Yang N. Higuchi O. Ohashi K. Nagata K. Wada A. Kangawa K. Nishida E. Mizuno K. Nature. 1998; 393: 809-812Crossref PubMed Scopus (1071) Google Scholar) indicate that it, like many other extranuclear LIM domain containing proteins, functionally associates with the cytoskeleton. Zyxin, cysteine-rich protein and paxillin are localized along actin filament bundles and at adhesion plaques (26Turner C.E. Miller J.T. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 1583-1591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sadler I. Crawford A.W. Michelsen J.W. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 119: 1573-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The actin LIM protein is localized to the cytoskeleton via its PDZ domain (28Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) while cysteine-rich protein 1 binds to α-actinin via its first LIM domain (29Pomies P. Louis H.A. Beckerle M.C. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 157-168Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Deletion of muscle LIM protein (cysteine-rich protein 3 or muscle LIM protein), which localizes to actin filaments via LIM domains, results in disruption of cardiomyocyte architecture and dilated cardiomyopathy (30Arber S. Hunter J.J. Ross Jr., J. Hongo M. Sansig G. Borg J. Perriard J.C. Chien K.R. Caroni P. Cell. 1997; 88: 393-403Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (708) Google Scholar). Some PDZ domains that bind to the consensus Ser/Thr-X-Val/Leu/Ile at the carboxyl terminus of target proteins (31Songyang Z. Fanning A.S. Fu C. Xu J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) also bind to the cytoskeleton via interaction with α-actinin-2 (28Xia H. Winokur S.T. Kuo W.L. Altherr M.R. Bredt D.S. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 507-515Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Other PDZ domain containing proteins also bind to actin via F-actin-binding domains (32Mandai K. Nakanishi H. Satoh A. Obaishi H. Wada M. Nishioka H. Itoh M. Mizoguchi A. Aoki T. Fujimoto T. Matsuda Y. Tsukita S. Takai Y. J.

Cell Biol. 1997; 139: 951-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). LIM kinase thus contains structural features of cytoskeletal regulatory proteins and kinase activity specific for cofilin. To determine features that regulate LIM kinase we have measured the activity of LIM kinase using transient transfection in COS-7 cells. Anin vivo assay of the biochemical activity of LIM kinase is based upon the morphological extent of actin cable dissolution and subsequent aggregation that results from inactivation of cofilin. Mutations were introduced into the LIM, PDZ, and kinase domains to assess their contributions to the activity of LIM kinase that causes actin accumulation in large uncleaved aggregates that were visualized by fluorescently labeled phalloidin binding. Additionally, co-expression of an amino-terminal fragment that corresponds to a naturally occurring splice variant with holo LIM kinase inhibited actin aggregation. These studies indicate that the amino-terminal fragment that contains the LIM and PDZ domains inhibits the catalytic activity of the kinase domain. These studies also indicate that a threonine residue in the catalytic loop, which is a major phosphorylation site in other kinases, is necessary for catalytic activity and that the basic insert in the activation loop contributes to biological activity. The unique structural features of LIM kinase located both outside and within the kinase domain thus control enzyme activity, subcellular distribution, and substrate recognition necessary for regulation of actin dynamics. COS-7 and HEK 293 cells were obtained from the American Type Tissue Culture Collection, (Manassas, VA). Six-well tissue culture plates and preferred glass coverslips were from Fisher Scientific (Pittsburgh, PA) and cell culture media and serum were purchased from FMC (Rockland, DE). Oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis were made by Operon Technologies (Alameda, CA) and molecular biology enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). All polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; nt, nucleotide; RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase-PCR; LIM1, LIM domain 1; LIM2, LIM domain 2; CIP, calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase. products were amplified with Pfu polymerase. Cofilin was a kind gift from Laurent Blanchoin and Tom Pollard (Salk Institute, La Jolla, CA). RNA from A431 cells was harvested using Tri-Reagent (Molecular Research Center Inc., Cincinnati, OH) and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reactions (RT-PCR) were carried out using the Superscript cDNA Cloning Kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) with random hexamers as the primers for the cDNA synthesis reaction. LIM kinase and dLIM kinase were amplified from the resulting cDNA library using primers with the sequences, 5′-GTCACTAAGCTTCATGAGGTTGACGCTACTTTGT-3′ for the 5′ end, and 5′-GTCACTAAGCTTCAGTCGGGGACCTCAGGGTGGGCAGG-3′ for the 3′ end. The PCR products were amplified with Pfu polymerase, digested withHindIII, and ligated into the HindIII sites in the cloning vector, pBlueScriptII-KS (Stratagene). The sequence of the full-length LIM kinase and dLIM kinase were verified by sequencing using Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham, Willinghamshire, United Kingdom). To determine the expression pattern of the dLIM kinase splice variant, 18 libraries were screened using RT-PCR. Four libraries were obtained: human fetal brain (a kind gift from Dimitri Krainc and R. Brent, Harvard, Boston, MA), HeLa and SK-N-MC(CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA), human placenta and A431 (Stratagene), and 14 libraries were made from cultured cells using the Superscript cDNA Cloning Kit. Oligonucleotide primers (5′ primer 5′–CCCCTGAGCTCTCCGGCTTATACTC-3′ and 3′ primer 5′-CCTCCTTGAGGAACGTCCTCTGGGT-3′) were made that would amplify the region in LIM kinase that contains the deletion. PCR amplification of the region around the alternate splice site would produce a 270-nucleotide (nt) fragment, while amplification of the identical region in full-length LIM kinase would produce a 331-nt fragment. PCR reactions were then run on a 1.5% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. All LIM kinase mutations were made by overlap extension (34Horton R.M. Hildebrand W.H. Martinko J.M. Pease L.R. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 1782-1787PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar), except for the G177E/L178A and T508EE, which replaces Thr508 with 2 Glu residues which were made using the Quickchange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). A schematic representation of mutant LIM kinases is shown in Fig.1. Kd1 and Kd3 constructs were made using 5′ primers 5′-GACTCATCGAGTCGGACCTCATCCACGGGGAGGTGCTG-3′ and 5′-GATCCTCGAGCCGGGCGCTGGCTCACTGGGCTCCCCG-3′, respectively, and the 3′ primer 5′-GCGTCTAGATCAGTCGGGGACCTC–3′. The constructs were amplified by PCR and ligated into the XhoI and NotI sites of pcDNA-3M, a derivative of pcDNA-3 which contains a luciferase start codon and a hemaglutinin epitope tag (HA-tag) (36Wu R. Durick K. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Taylor S.S. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15934-15941Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Translation is initiated from the luciferase start codon and places an in-frame HA-tag at the amino terminus of the constructs. All mutations were verified by sequencing. 293 transformed human kidney and COS-7 green monkey kidney cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum in a humidified 8% CO2 atmosphere at 37 °C. All constructs were cloned into pcDNA-3 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) except Kd1 and Kd3, which were cloned into pcDNA-3M. DNAs were transfected into COS-7 and 293 cells using calcium phosphate-mediated transfection (37Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Crossref PubMed Scopus (4824) Google Scholar). A peptide with the sequence KETYRRGESGLPAHPEVPD corresponding to the carboxyl-terminal 18 residues and a peptide that corresponds to residues 255–271, KEHDPHDTLGHGLGPETS, of human LIM kinase were conjugated to keyhole lympet hemocyanin using gluteraldehyde (38Kagen A. Glick M. Jaffe B.B. Behrman H.R. Methods of Hormone Radioimmunoassay. Academic Press, New York1979: 328-329Google Scholar). An amino-terminal lysine was included on each peptide to facilitate coupling. The peptide conjugates were used to immunize rabbits or chickens by Lampire Laboratories (Ottsville, PA). Immunoprecipitations were done using the rabbit antibody 5079 directed against the carboxyl-terminal peptide except those involving dLIM kinase where antibody 5078, directed against the internal peptide, was used. Western blotting was done with the chicken antibody 625 directed to the internal peptide. The Kd3 construct was detected using an anti-HA monoclonal antibody (Berkeley Antibody Co., Berkeley, CA). Cells used for immunocytochemistry were plated onto preferred glass coverslips and harvested 60 h after transfection. Cells were fixed with a 4% paraformaldehyde in 1 × phosphate-buffered saline for 25 min at room temperature. To determine LIM kinase expression, cells were incubated 2–3 h with a 1:1,250 dilution of anti-LIM kinase rabbit antibody 5079 in buffer containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 0.024% saponin, and 2% bovine serum albumin. To visualize LIM kinase and to stain for actin filaments, cells were incubated for 2 h in buffer containing goat anti-rabbit Texas Red-conjugated secondary antibody and Oregon Green 488-labeled phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Cells were then equilibrated and mounted with Slow Fade mounting media. Pictures were taken with a Zeiss Axiophot microscope with an attached Hamamatsu color chilled CCD camera using × 40 and 60 objectives. Transiently transfected 293 cells were grown for 72 h and harvested by washing cells off the plate with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspending in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 10 mmNaCl, 3% glycerol, 2% Triton X-100, 50 μm benzamidine, 2 μm aprotinin, 2 μm leupeptin, 1 mm phenymethlysulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, 10 μg/ml phenalthroline) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Cleared lysate was presorbed with preimmune serum and protein A-Sepharose. LIM kinase was then immunoprecipitated using the 5079 anti-LIM kinase antibody and protein A-Sepharose and washed 4 times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates for kinase assays were washed and resuspended in kinase assay buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 3% glycerol). An aliquot of immunoprecipitated LIM kinase was resuspended in SDS loading buffer and protein estimated by Western blotting using antibody 625 or anti-HA antibody. Protein was detected with goat anti-chicken or anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and visualized with chemiluminescence. Protein A-Sepharose beads containing immunoprecipitated LIM kinase were resuspended in kinase reaction buffer and incubated for 150 min at 30 °C in kinase reaction buffer with 5 μm ATP and 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol), 2 mmMnCl2, and 5 mm MgCl2 with 25 μm cofilin. Reactions were stopped by addition of SDS sample buffer and loading on a 14% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Gels were dried and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak, Rochester, NY) for 1 h at room temperature with an intensifying screen. Films were scanned with a Molecular Dynamics Personal Densitometer SI and analysis was done using Image Quart Vd 1.1 (Molecular Dynamics). Phosphatase treatment of immunoprecipitated LIM kinase was carried out at 30 °C for 25 min with and without calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP) (New England Biolabs), in kinase reaction buffer. CIP-treated and mock treated LIM kinase was washed 4 times in kinase reaction buffer and kinase reactions were run as described. Solution assays contained 200 μm[γ-32P]ATP (specific activity 0.5 μCi/nmol) varying amounts of cofilin, 2 mm MnCl2, 5 mm MgCl2, 50 mm HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, and various forms of LIM kinase expressed by transient transfection of HEK 293 cells. Reactions were incubated for the indicated times at 30 °C and terminated by spotting an aliquot onto Whatman 3MM filter disks that were placed in cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. Fillers were sequentially washed in cold/heated/cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, dried in 70% ethanol, and counted. Background values using untransfected HEK 293 cell lysates were subtracted and kinase activity was adjusted for LIM kinase expression quantitated by chemiluminescence imaging using Molecular Dynamics (Bio-Rad) hardware and software. SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis indicated that >90% of radioactivity incorporated was into cofilin and that cofilin phorphorylation was not detected using untransfected lysates. Triplicate data points are shown for assays that were repeated. To investigate the functional consequences of mutations in LIM kinase, anin vivo assay was developed based on the effects of transiently transfected LIM kinase on the actin cytoskeleton in COS-7 cells. Expression of LIM kinase was assessed using a rabbit polyclonal anti-peptide antibody directed to the carboxyl terminus and effects on the actin cytoskeleton were assessed using fluorescently labeled phalloidin. Fig. 2 shows the range of changes observed in the actin cytoskeleton; protein expression levels were based on the intensity of immunfluorescence and were qualitatively proportional to the extent of changes in the actin cytoskeleton indicated in the panels on the right. At low levels of LIM kinase expression there was a decrease in the extent of actin cables visualized and enhanced membrane staining compared with neighboring untransfected cells (Fig. 2, A and B). Intermediate levels of LIM kinase resulted in loss of the cable-like stress fibers and the appearance of multiple irregular lattice-like actin filaments (Fig. 2, C and D). Higher levels of LIM kinase expression resulted in accumulation of large masses of actin near the cell periphery and diffuse cytoplasmic staining (Fig. 2,E and F). The highest levels of LIM kinase expression resulted in multiple discrete masses of actin (Fig. 2,G and H). The extent of changes in the actin cytoskeleton were scored using a 1+ to 4+scale. The distribution of these actin cytoskeletal phenotypes in the population of cells expressing LIM kinase are shown in Fig. 4. As reported (2Bernard O. Ganiatsas S. Kannourakis G. Dringen R. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 1159-1171PubMed Google Scholar, 4Okano I. Hiraoka J. Otera H. Nunoue K. Ohashi K. Iwashita S. Hirai M. Mizuno K. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31321-31330Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), LIM kinase was expressed in the cytoplasm; at high levels of aggregation the enzyme colocalized with the masses of actin. With extensive disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, multiple nuclei were often observed, consistent with resultant defects in nuclear division.Figure 4Distribution of actin cytoskeletal phenotypes in cells expressing various LIM kinase mutants. COS-7 cells were transfected with the indicated LIM kinase mutants and stained for LIM kinase and actin. Transfected cells were identified and the actin phenotype scored in 100 cells without knowledge of the form of LIM kinase. ■, 1+; ▧, 2+; ▨, 3+; ▪, 4+, as defined in the legend to Fig. 2.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A mutation of the predicted catalytic base that changes Asp to Asn (D460N) is reported to abolish LIM kinase activity (6Proschel C. Blouin M.J. Gutowski N.J. Ludwig R. Noble M. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1271-1281PubMed Google Scholar). Even high levels of expression of a D460N mutant LIM kinase gave no change in the actin cytoskeleton compared with untransfected cells (Fig. 2,I and J). In vitro kinase assays confirmed that D460N LIM kinase was devoid of catalytic activity (see Fig. 10). The changes in the actin cytoskeleton were thus dependent on the kinase activity of LIM kinase. To assess the role of the LIM and PDZ domains on LIM kinase function, mutations were introduced which were designed to disrupt each of these domains. The structure of LIM domains is dependent on two Zn2+ atoms that are coordinated tetrahedrally in amino- and carboxyl-terminal liganding modules (39Perez-Alvarado G.C. Miles C. Michelsen J.W. Louis H.A. Winge D.R. Beckerle M.C. Summers M.F. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1994; 1: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Metal binding is essential for protein structure and renaturation studies indicate that binding is sequential (40Kosa J.L. Michelsen J.W. Louis H.A. Olsen J.I. Davis D.R. Beckerle M.C. Winge D.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 468-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The first conserved Cys residue of each LIM domain of LIM kinase was mutated to Ser to disrupt metal coordination and LIM domain structure (C25S for the first (LIM1) and C84S for the second (LIM2) LIM domain). Mutations in the PDZ domain were based on the crystal structure of the third PDZ domain of PSD-95 complexed to the carboxyl terminus of the potassium channel (41Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). The signature sequence Gly-Leu-Gly-Phe that constitutes the protein binding loop of PDZ domains is 177Gly-Leu-Ser-Val in LIM kinase. To disrupt target binding, the LIM kinase PDZ domain 177Gly-Leu was mutated to Glu-Ala (G177E/L178A). These mutations are predicted to disrupt both alignment of backbone interactions and the hydrophobic pocket necessary for protein binding (41Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (976) Google Scholar). Mutation of the corresponding residues in the PDZ domain of Enigma, which also contains a variant sequence at this position, abolished target recognition. 2P. M. Guy, D. A. Kenny, and G. N. Gill, submitted for publication. As shown in Fig. 3, A andB, mutation of LIM1 did not affect the ability of LIM kinase to induce actin aggregation. Aggregates of actin were observed comparable to those observed with similar levels of WT LIM kinase (see Fig. 2 D). Mutation of LIM2 and the PDZ domain increased the ability of LIM kinase to induce actin aggregation (Fig. 3,C-F). At low levels of G177E/L178A LIM kinase expression, phenotypic changes scored as 3+ to 4+ were seen whereas comparable levels of holo LIM kinase expression gave actin cytoskeleton changes scored as 1+ to 2+. As shown in the left panels, mutations in the LIM and PDZ domains did not affect subcellular localization as these mutant LIM kinases remained outside the nucleus. These data indicate that LIM and PDZ domains are not necessary for biological responses to LIM kinas"

The NCp7 structural characteristics are crucial because mutations altering the finger domain conformation led to noninfectious viruses characterized by defects in provirus integration. These findings prompted us to study a putative RT/NCp7 protein-protein interaction. Binding assays using far Western analysis or RT immobilized on beads clearly showed the formation of a complex between NCp7 and RT. The affinity of NCp7 for p66/p51RT was 0.60 μm with a 1:1 stoechiometry. This interaction was confirmed by chemical cross-linking and co-immunoprecipitation of the two proteins in a viral environment. Competition experiments using different NCp7 mutants showed that alteration of the finger structure disrupted RT recognition, giving insights into the loss of infectivity of corresponding HIV-1 mutants. Together with structural data on RT, these results suggest that the role of NCp7 could be to enhance RT processivity through stabilization of a p51-induced active form of the p66 subunit and open the way for designing new antiviral agents.

In vivo, NCp7 is required for the protection of the genome against cellular nucleases and is involved in genomic RNA packaging and morphogenesis of virus particles (review in Ref. 2Darlix J.L.

Chem. 1992; 267: 6689-6695Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). NMR studies have demonstrated that the folded CCHC boxes of NCp7 are in spatial proximity, whereas the N- and C-terminal sequences remain flexible (4Morellet N. Jullian N. de Rocquigny H. Maigret B.

Mutations inducing modifications in the general conformation of the protein, such as the replacement of His23 by Cys, Pro31 by Leu, or Trp37 by a nonaromatic residue led to more or less important defects in RNA packaging and virus core morphology (6Déméné H.

One possible explanation could be that changes in NCp7 structure hinders one essential NCp7-dependent step of virus life cycle such as reverse transcription and provirus synthesis (12Yu Q.

Accordingly, NCp7 was shown to be capable of re-establishing strand transfer efficiency and RNase H activity of a defective RT mutant (14Cameron C.E. Ghosh M. Le Grice S.F.J. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6700-6705Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). In this study, RT and NCp7 have been shown for the first time to form a 1:1 complex characterized by an affinity of 6.0 × 10−7m. The structure-activity study has emphasized the critical role of the zinc finger domain in the complexation, giving insights into the loss of virus infectivity of mutants with structurally altered NCp7. Co-immunoprecipitation of NCp7 and RT in a viral environment and cross-linking experiments suggest that NCp7 could enhance RT processivity through stabilization by its zinc finger domain of the p51-induced active form of p66 RNase H domain (28Hostomsky Z.

Moreover, the N-terminal part of NCp7 could compensate for the absence in RNase H domain of HIV-1 p66 RT of the sequence present in the Escherichia coli RT (29Davies J.F. Hostomska Z. Hostomsky Z. Jordan S.R. Matthews D.A. Science. 1991; 252: 88-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). The critical role of the complex during viral DNA synthesis suggests that inhibition of this protein-protein interaction could be an interesting way for designing new antiviral agents.

Rabbit polyclonal antibody against RT was a generous gift from S. Litvak. Monoclonal antibody against Vpr was obtained from the synthetic peptide (31de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Décimo D.

HIV-1 (NL43 strain) was produced by transfecting plasmid pNL43 into 293T cells using the calcium phosphate precipitation standard procedure. This virus was pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatotitis virus G glycoprotein by co-transfection of vesicular stomatotitis virus G glycoprotein-encoding plasmid. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (kit from E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co.) was carried out to quantify p24 content of the viral stock. The infectivity of the virus was determined on HeLa cells as described (33Schwartz O. Dautry-Varsat A. Goud B. Marechal V. Subtil A. Heard J.M. Danos O. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 528-533Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). After ultracentrifugation (50,000 ×g), the virus was resuspended in 200 μl of phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, containing 150 mm NaCl and 0.5% Triton. The concentrations of viral proteins in the sample were 30 μg of p24/ml, 10 μg of NCp7/ml, and 3.5 μg of RT/ml. 2 μg of purified HIV-1 p66/p51 RT (Worthington, Freehold, New Jersey) were immobilized onto a Hybond-C super nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 100 μl of TBS (25 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 0.1 mm DTT, 3 mm KCl, pH 7.4) for 3 h at room temperature. The membrane was treated with SuperBlock blocking buffer (Pierce) for 3 h at room temperature to reduce nonspecific interactions and then incubated overnight at 4 °C either with NCp7, (a-D)NCp7, (12–53)NCp7, or Vpr (2.1 μm) or without proteins as a control in 4 ml of 5% dry milk in TBS buffer containing 0.1% Tween 20. After three washes in TBS-Tween and a 45-min incubation in superblocker, blots were revealed by incubation, first, with 1/15,000 anti-NCp7 mAb (HH3 for NCp7 and (a-D)NCp7, 2B10 for (12–53)NCp7) or 1/1000 anti-Vpr mAb for 3 h in 5% dry milk TBS-Tween followed by treatment with peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse antibody for 1 h. These antibodies were not able to cross-react with RT. Complexes were revealed by the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with peroxidase substrate incubation. Alternatively, 2 μg of HIV-RT were loaded on a 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and then transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane. The blot was incubated with 2.1 μm NCp7 or without NCp7 as control following the procedure described above using HH3 mAb against NCp7. HIV-1 RT was covalently linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose 4B beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using the standard procedure described by the supplier. Typically, 100 mg of CNBr-activated Sepharose beads were swollen and washed in 20 ml of HCl (1 mm), then equilibrated in coupling buffer (0.1m NaHCO3, 500 mm NaCl, pH 8.3), thus providing 350 μl of gel, which was then diluted in 350 μl of coupling buffer. The batch was divided in two equal parts. 40 μg of HIV-1 RT in 200 μl of coupling buffer were added to the first batch, and only coupling buffer was added to the second one. After a night at 4 °C, excess ligand was washed away, and remaining unbound sites were inactivated in 1 m 1,3-diaminopropane, pH 8, during 2 h at room temperature. The two bead batches were washed with 3 5-min cycles of alternating pH using 0.1 m acetate buffer (500 mm NaCl, pH 4) and 0.1 m Tris-HCl buffer (500 mm NaCl, pH 8). The efficiency of RT immobilization was checked by detecting the quantity of unbound proteins remaining in the supernatant using Western blot analysis and calculated to be superior to 98% (data not shown), suggesting that 0.23 μg (2 × 10−12 mol) of RT has been captured by μl of beads. Then, 20 μl of these beads corresponding to about 4.6 μg of protein (3.9 × 10−11 mol) were equilibrated in TBS, 0.1% Tween 20, 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and incubated with increasing concentrations of NCp7 from 0.1 up to 4.2 μm in 100 μl of the same buffer for 5 h at room temperature. After centrifugation (6500 rpm), the beads were washed twice with the previous cold buffer at 4 °C. NCp7 bound to immobilized RT or nonspecifically to the beads was recovered by heating at 80 °C for 5 min in 30 μl of Laemmli buffer (50 mm Tris, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 200 mm DTT). Collected samples were loaded on a 20% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose, and analyzed by Western blot using HH3 mAb in order to reveal NCp7. The effect of NaCl concentration on NCp7/RT complex formation was measured using the same procedure, except that the beads were incubated with a constant concentration of NCp7 (0.9 μm) in TBS-Tween-Nonidet P-40 buffer containing 100 to 500 mm NaCl. When (12–53)NCp7 or its derivatives were used as competitors, two concentrations of these peptides (4 and 20 μm) were preincubated for 90 min with immobilized RT before the addition of 0.4 μm NCp7. In this case, the monoclonal antibody used (HH3) was selective for NCp7 and was unable to cross-react with (12–53)NCp7 or its derivatives. The affinity and stoichiometry of the NCp7/RT complex were determined by quantification of NCp7 bound to immobilized RT or nonspecifically bound to the beads using a standard curve of pure NCp7 and a Bio-profile imager (Vilber-Lourmat). Nonspecific binding was subtracted from the total binding, thus enabling us to calculate the concentrations of bound and free NCp7. The binding parameters were calculated using the Scatchard equation from Enzfit software. Results are means of three independent experiments performed in duplicate. Surface plasmon resonance experiments were carried out on an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech BIAcore 2000 apparatus. CM5 sensorchips,N-hydroxysuccinimide,N-ethyl-N′-(dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide, and surfactant p20 were supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. 1,3-Diaminopropane was from Aldrich. CM5 sensorchip was stabilized in HBS running buffer (10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 0.005% p20, pH 7.4) and activated using theN-ethyl-N′-(1,3-diethylamide-propyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide procedure described by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Then, about 6000 response units of RT were reproducibly bound following a 20-μl pulse (5 μl/min) with a solution of RT protein (0.1 μg/μl) diluted in sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5. To prevent possible electrostatic interactions with (12–53)NCp7 and its derivatives, remaining activated carboxyl groups were blocked by the addition of 1,3-diaminopropane (1 mm, 30 μl). The bulk refractive index due to injected proteins was corrected using a nonderivatized channel as control. Binding experiments were performed at 25 °C with a 20 μl/min flow rate in HBS running buffer (50 mm NaCl). 50 μl of (12–53)NCp7, W16F37(12–53)NCp7, L37(12–53)NCp7, and C23(12–53)NCp7 solutions (1.6 μm) were injected three times on immobilized RT and on the control channel. Flow cells were regenerated by a 5-μl pulse of 0.05% SDS in HBS running buffer followed by 2.5 m NaCl solution. RT and NCp7 were cross-linked with a homobifunctionalN-hydroxysuccinimide ester-conjugated reagent DTSSP (Pierce), leading to covalent bonds between amino groups of both proteins. After incubation of 1 μg of RT and 4.6 μg of NCp7 (40 equivalents) for 1 h at room temperature in 10 μl of phosphate-buffered saline (3 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, 8 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.5), DTSSP was added (2 or 5 mm) for 30 min. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by incubating the mixture for 30 min in 50 mmTris, 6 mm glycine buffer. Proteins boiled in Laemmli buffer without DTT were resolved by electrophoresis on a 12% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane, and analyzed by two successive Western blots using, first, rabbit polyclonal antibody against RT (a generous gift from S. Litvak) and then, after dehybridation in 0.1 m CH3COOH, a mouse mAb against NCp7 (HH3) as described above. 50 μl of crude extract obtained from 293T transfected cells were rocked with 50 μl of ascite fluid containing mAb against NCp7 (HH3 or 2B10) overnight at 4 °C. Then, 25 μl of protein G-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated in 80 mm Tris, 80 mm NaCl, pH 8.0, 1% Nonidet P-40 were added, and the suspension was incubated for 4 h at 4 °C. Beads were collected by centrifugation (10,000 ×g for 5 s) and washed at 4 °C twice with the previous buffer and once with a low salt buffer (80 mmTris, pH 8.0, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 0.05% sodium deoxycholate). Beads were boiled in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on a 15% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by two successive Western blots in order to reveal RT and NCp7 using the previously mentioned procedure. Interactions between NCp7 and heterodimeric p66/p51RT or monomeric p66RT and p51RT forms alone were investigated in vitro by far Western blot analysis using RT samples immobilized on nitrocellulose membrane under nondenaturating (Fig. 2 A) or denaturating conditions (Fig. 2 B). The formation of a complex was evidenced using a mAb directed against NCp7 or its derivatives, which is unable to cross-react with native RT. As depicted in Fig. 2 A, NCp7 (1st lane) and its central zinc-fingered domain, (12–53)NCp7 (3rd lane), interact with the heterodimeric RT, whereas (a-D)NCp7 (2ndlane), in which both zinc fingers have been replaced by two Gly-Gly linkers (Fig. 1), was found unable to bind RT. In contrast, even after a long exposure time, no signal could be detected when Vpr, another basic HIV-1 protein (31de Rocquigny H. Petitjean P. Tanchou V. Décimo D. Drouot L. Delaunay T. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 30753-30759Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), was used instead of NCp7 (Fig.2 A, 4th lane). Likewise, p6, the second maturation product of p15, was found unable to recognize RT (data not shown). Fig. 2 B shows that NCp7 recognized both subunits of RT, independently. This interaction is not critically dependent on salt concentration, because only a slight difference was observed when binding experiments were performed using buffers containing 100 up to 500 mm NaCl (Fig.2 C). The affinity of NCp7 for RT was measured by means of an affinity test based on the immobilization of p66/p51RT onto Sepharose beads through the formation of covalent bonds between amino groups of RT and CNBr-preactivated sites on the resin. The beads were incubated with increasing concentrations of NCp7 from 0.1 up to 4.2 μmor without NCp7 as control. After washes, the bound NCp7 molecules were released from the beads by denaturation and analyzed by successive 20% SDS-PAGE, nitrocellulose membrane transfer and Western blot analysis with NCp7 mAb (32Tanchou V. Delaunay T. de Rocquigny H. Bodeus M. Darlix J.L. Roques B.P. Benarous R. AIDS Res. Hum. Retroviruses. 1994; 10: 983-993Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Fig. 3 A, which represents the total binding of NCp7 on immobilized RT, confirmed the formation of a dose-dependent RT/NCp7 complex, previously characterized by far Western analysis. The nonspecific binding of NCp7 (Fig. 2 C, 1st lane) was significantly reduced by adding 1,3-diaminopropane to the RT substituted resin, which blocked the remaining CNBr-activated groups and provided positive charges at the surface of the beads, resulting in electrostatic repulsion of the positively charged NCp7. The specific saturation curve and the binding parameters were determined from Scatchard representation. The calculated apparent affinityK D was 0.60 μm (± 0.07) for a 1:1 stoichiometry (n = 0.86 ± 0.04), corresponding to about 1 NCp7 molecule for 1 molecule of the heterodimer p66/p51RT (Fig.3, B and C). Since it appears from the experiments with (a-D)NCp7 (Fig. 2 A) that the N- and C-terminal parts of NCp7 are not critical for RT recognition, the contribution of the zinc finger domains was investigated by measuring the direct binding of (12–53)NCp7 and its various mutants, W16F37(12–53)NCp7, L37(12–53)NCp7, and C23(12–53)NCp7, to RT using surface plasmon resonance experiments. One concentration (1.6 μm) of each peptide was injected to 6000 response units of RT immobilized on the sensorchip in HBS buffer (10 mmHepes, 50 mm NaCl, 0.005% p20, pH 7.4). As shown on Fig.4 A, (12–53)NCp7 was able to recognize RT. The inversion of aromatic residues in W16F37(12–53)NCp7 induced a 50% decrease of RT binding as compared with wild-type (12–53)NCp7. Moreover, the replacement of Trp37 by Leu or His23 by Cys dramatically disturbed the RT recognition, because in both cases, only 20% of wild-type binding was retained. These results were confirmed by competition experiments using immobilized RT on Sepharose beads. For this purpose, the beads were preincubated with two different concentrations of (12–53)NCp7 or various mutants. Wild-type NCp7 was then added at 0.4 μm, and the collected samples were analyzed by Western blot as above in order to quantify the amount of NCp7 bound to RT. The monoclonal antibody used (HH3) interacts selectively with NCp7 and is unable to cross-react with the competing NCp7 derivatives. The addition of 10 equivalents of (12–53)NCp7 induced a complete disappearance of the NCp7 band (Fig.4 B, lanes 3–4), supporting the importance of the finger domain in RT recognition. Moreover, the structure of the zinc finger domain appears important for the interaction with RT because W16F37(12–53)NCp7 appeared to be able to decrease NCp7 binding only at 50 equivalents (Fig. 4 B,lanes 9–10), whereas L37(12–53)NCp7 (lanes 5–6) and C23(12–53)NCp7 (lanes 7–8) were unable to impede RT/NC recognition. The interaction between RT and NCp7 was confirmed by cross-linking experiments using 2 and 5 mm DTSSP, which cross-links compounds in close spatial proximity by formation of covalent amide bonds with amino groups of interacting proteins (Fig. 5,A and B). Therefore, NCp7 and RT were preincubated to allow the complex to be preformed. Then DTSSP was added. After quenching the reaction with Tris-glycine buffer, samples were analyzed by two successive Western blots using antibodies directed either against RT (Fig. 5 A) or against NCp7 (Fig.5 B). As expected, this resulted in the formation of various species with apparent molecular masses of 59, 74, 117, and 134 kDa that reacted with antibodies directed against RT (Fig. 5 A). The band at 117 kDa corresponds to the coupling of the p51 and p66 subunits. When anti-NCp7 mAb was used (Fig. 5 B), NCp7 could be detected on the previously mentioned adducts migrating at the 59-, 74-, and 134-kDa positions. The first and second compounds correspond to the covalent binding of NCp7 to the p51 and p66 subunits of RT, respectively, and the third one to the binding of two molecules of NCp7 to p66/p51 RT. Interestingly, the p66/NCp7 cross-linked compound is the most abundant adduct. Weak bands at 16, 24, and 32 kDa, corresponding to dimers, trimers, and tetramers of NCp7, were observed. The existence of a RT/NCp7 complex was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation using a crude extract from 293T cells transfected by pNL43 HIV-1 plasmid. The viral preparation was treated with HH3 or 2B10 mouse monoclonal antibody. Antigen-antibody complexes were isolated by affinity absorption to protein G-Sepharose beads and subsequent elution with an SDS-containing buffer. After gel electrophoresis and transfer onto nitrocellulose membrane, the immunoprecipitated proteins were probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody against RT (Fig.6 A) then, after dehybridation, with a mouse mAb against NCp7 (Fig. 6 B). Significative amounts of NCp7 were retrieved in both cases (Fig. 6 B,lanes 1–2), whereas no nonspecific binding on the beads was observed (Fig. 6 B, lane 3). Moreover, when using HH3 mAb directed against the C-terminal part of NCp7, both subunits, but principally p66, co-immunoprecipitated (Fig.6 A, lane 1), whereas in the case of 2B10 recognizing the first zinc finger of NCp7, essentially p51 was found (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). The light and heavy chains of immunoprecipitating mAbs were also stained (Fig. 6 B), because these antibodies and the probing secondary anti-NCp7 antibody were both elicited in mice. The role of the nucleocapsid protein NCp7 in HIV-1 viral replication is not as yet well defined. In addition to its involvement in dimerization and packaging of genomic RNA and in virus morphogenesis (2Darlix J.L. Lapadat-Tapolsky M. de Rocquigny H. Roques B.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 254: 523-537Crossref PubMed Scopus (381) Google Scholar), several studies suggested that NCp7 may function as a key element of the reverse transcriptionally active ribonucleoprotein complex. Thus, in vitro, NCp7 was shown (i) to promote annealing of the tRNA3Lys to the primer binding site of HIV-1 genome (16Barat C. Lullien V. Schatz O. Keith G. Nugeyre M.T. Grüninger-Leitch F.

In mouse B82L fibroblasts transfected with the full-length EGF receptor, EGF promotes cell rounding and attenuates cell spreading on fibronectin, laminin, and vitronectin, and thus appears to reduce the strength of cell adhesion. Moreover, EGF synergizes with multiple extracellular matrix (ECM) components in the promotion of integrin-mediated cell migration of several different cell types, including fibroblasts and various carcinoma and osteosarcoma cell lines. Interestingly, co-presentation (co-positioning) of EGF with laminin or fibronectin is essential for EGF-stimulated migration. When EGF is mixed with the cells instead of the ECM components, it has little effect on cell migration. These results suggest that co-presentation of EGF with ECM components can enhance the polarization events required for directional cell movement. To identify the EGF receptor elements critical for the EGF stimulation of cell migration, B82L fibroblasts were transfected with either mutated or wild-type EGF receptors. Surprisingly, we found that B82L-Parental cells that lack the EGF receptor are not able to migrate to fibronectin, even though they can adhere to fibronectin. However, the introduction of wild-type EGF receptors into these fibroblasts enables them to migrate toward fibronectin even in the absence of EGF. The requirement of the EGF receptor for cell migration does not appear to result from the secretion of EGF or TGF-α by the cells transfected with the EGF receptor. Furthermore, cells expressing EGF receptors that are kinase-inactive, or C-terminally truncated, exhibit little migration toward fibronectin, indicating that an intact EGF receptor kinase is required for fibronectin-induced cell migration. In addition, neutralizing anti-EGF receptor antibodies attenuate cell migration in the presence of EGF, and inhibit migration to fibronectin or laminin alone.

In addition, EGF has been shown to induce the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, and the EGF receptor has been found to be associated with actin filaments (2Roy L.M. Gittinger C.K.

Cell migration plays a central role in a variety of biological processes including embryonic development, angiogenesis, wound healing, and tumor cell metastasis (24Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). Although the exact mechanisms of cell migration are not well established, it is generally believed that several coordinated events are involved, including morphological polarization, membrane extension, formation of cell-substratum attachments, contractile force and traction, and release of attachments (24Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar). The adhesive interactions between cells and various ECM substrates are likely to be critical in determining cell migration capacity (24Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F.

J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 311-321PubMed Google Scholar). The adhesion between cells and substrate are largely mediated by the integrins, which are a family of cell surface heterodimeric receptors that bind to ECM proteins such as laminin, fibronectin, and vitronectin (34Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Integrin expression, the affinity and specificity for their ligands, and the integrin-cytoskeleton linkages are regulated by various signals including those initiated by growth factors. In fact, integrins and growth factor receptors share many common signaling events, such as increased tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, protein kinase C isoforms, and small molecular weight GTP-binding proteins, as well as enhanced Ca2+ fluxes (35Sastry S.K. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar, 36Clark E.A. Brugge J.S.

Given their common signaling pathways, and the association of both EGF receptor and integrin systems with the actin cytoskeleton, it is conceivable that the EGF receptor can be involved in the modulation of integrin-mediated cellular functions such as cell migration. Previous analyses of the EGF receptor have revealed that the receptor tyrosine kinase activity and the C-terminal autophosphorylation sites are critical for EGF-stimulated signal transduction (1Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The C-terminal domain of the receptor exerts a competitive autoinhibitory restraint on the receptor tyrosine kinase activity that can be removed by autophosphorylation of the tyrosine residues located within this domain (39Walton G.M. Chen W.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1750-1754Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 40Bertics P.J. Chen W.S. Hubler L. Lazar C.S. Rosenfeld M.G. Gill G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3610-3617Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, the autophosphorylated tyrosine residues at the EGF receptor C terminus provide anchoring sites for downstream Src homology 2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain-containing effectors that are involved in the transduction of EGF-stimulated intracellular signals (1Carpenter G. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 7709-7712Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Chen et al. (17Chen P. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 18Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar) have reported that the receptor kinase activity and at least one C-terminal tyrosine autophosphorylation site are required for cell movement. In addition, EGF stimulation of phospholipase C-γ and protein kinase C has been linked to the EGF induction of cell motility (14Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 18Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In the present study, we evaluated the effects of EGF on cell migration and assessed the capacity of various EGF receptor constructs to modulate the motility of mouse B82L-Parental fibroblasts that possess no detectable endogenous EGF receptors. We found that EGF synergistically stimulates integrin-mediated chemotaxis, and that the co-positioning of EGF and the chemoattractant is critical for EGF-stimulated migration. In particular, it is noteworthy that, although B82L-Parental cells do not exhibit fibronectin-induced chemotaxis, they do adhere to fibronectin, but it is the introduction of an intact EGF receptor into these cells that allows for fibronectin-induced motility. In addition, neutralizing anti-EGF receptor antibodies inhibit cell migration toward fibronectin or laminin alone. These findings demonstrate that the EGF receptor is important for B82L fibroblast motility, suggesting that the EGF receptor may act downstream of integrin activation and may directly engage in the signal transduction events leading to cell migration. Mouse laminin was obtained from Collaborative Research (Bedford, MA). Human fibronectin and vitronectin were generous gifts from Dr. Deane F. Mosher (University of Wisconsin, Madison, WI). Recombinant human EGF was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (UBI, Lake Placid, NY). Nucleopore membranes and the 48-well chemotaxis chamber were purchased from Nucleopore Corp. (Pleasanton, CA). Anti-EGF receptor monoclonal antibodies were obtained from the following sources: antibody 528 was affinity-purified from hybridoma cell line HB 8509 (ATCC, Rockville, MD), antibody C225 was obtained from Imclone Systems, Inc. (New York, NY), and antibody LA22 was purchased from UBI. Neutralizing anti-mouse EGF and anti-human TGF-α antibodies were purchased from UBI and R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN), respectively. Murine B82L-Parental fibroblasts and those expressing the wild-type or the K721M or c'1022 EGF receptor constructs were provided by Dr. Gordon Gill (University of California, San Diego, CA). Mouse B82L-Parental fibroblasts were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone, Logan, UT). Cells transfected with wild-type or mutated EGF receptors were cultured in the same medium that contained 10 μm methotrexate because a mutant dihydrofolate reductase gene was used as a selectable marker (41Simonsen C.C.

The Clone B3 cells were derived from B82L-wt cells based on their ability to bind laminin (42Lin M. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), and were cultured in the same medium as the B82L-wt cells. The GD25 cells are differentiated and immortalized cells derived from the embryonic stem cell clone G201, which are deficient in the integrin subunit β1 as the result of the introduction of a null mutation in the β1 integrin gene via homologous recombination (43Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The stably transfected cell line GD25-β1A was obtained by electroporating wild-type integrin β1A cDNA into GD25 cells. In the present study, the GD25 cells were cultured in nonselection medium consisting of DMEM plus either 10% fetal calf serum (HyClone) or 10% cosmic calf serum, whereas the GD25-β1A cells were continuously cultured in the same medium plus puromycin (10 μg/ml) (43Wennerberg K. Lohikangas L. Gullberg D. Pfaff M. Johansson S. Fässler R. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 132: 227-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Both the GD25 and the GD25-β1A cells were provided by Dr. Deane F. Mosher. Other cell lines used in this study, including human mammary carcinoma cell line MDA468, human osteosarcoma cell line MG63 and human epidermal carcinoma cell line A431, were cultured in DMEM plus 10% fetal calf serum. 3T3-F442A fibroblasts were cultured in DMEM plus 10% bovine calf serum (HyClone). Cell culture plates (24-well) were coated with purified matrix or control proteins (laminin, 20 μg/ml; fibronectin, 10 μg/ml; vitronectin, 10 μg/ml; polylysine, 10 μg/ml) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline using either an overnight incubation at 4 °C or a 2-h incubation at 37 °C. Nonspecific binding sites were blocked using a 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution (in phosphate-buffered saline) and a 1-h incubation at 37 °C. The Clone B3 cells were detached by digestion with 0.1% trypsin, and the cells were then resuspended in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. The cells were mixed with EGF (at the indicated final concentrations), seeded at a density of 2 × 105cells/ml, and incubated at 37 °C in a humidified incubator containing 5% CO2. Samples were viewed using a light microscope equipped with phase contrast (Nikon Inc., Instrument Group, Melville, NY), and photographs were taken at different times (magnification, ×40). The experiments assessing chemotactic motility were performed using a 48-well migration chamber as described previously (42Lin M. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In these studies, cells were grown as described under “Cell Culture Conditions” for 3–4 days. After being detached from the plastic dishes using a 0.1% trypsin solution, the cells were stabilized for 1 h at 37 °C in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA. Cells were then counted and resuspended in DMEM plus 0.1% BSA at a final concentration of 1 × 105 cells/50 μl. The lower compartment of the migration chamber was filled with the indicated proteins dissolved in DMEM + 0.1% BSA (29 μl/well), and the cells were added to the upper compartment of the migration chamber (50 μl/well). To ascertain the effects of EGF, the growth factor was added either to the upper or to the lower compartments at indicated concentrations. To evaluate the effects of anti-EGF receptor, anti-EGF, or anti-TGF-α antibodies, the antibodies were incubated with the cells for 30 min before the cells were placed into the upper wells. In all experiments, the two compartments of the migration chamber were separated by a polycarbonate filter (5-μm pore size, Nucleopore Corp.). The cells were allowed to migrate for 4 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The cells that did not migrate through the membrane remained on the upper surface of the filter and were removed mechanically by scraping; the migrant cells on the lower surface were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) for 2 min, and then stained with 1% crystal violet. The filters were densitometrically analyzed using the OFOTO program (Light Source Computer Images, Inc.) and quantified by Scanner Analysis (Biosoft, Ferguson, MO). To explore the effects of EGF on cell migration, mouse B82L fibroblasts that lack measurable endogenous EGF receptors (B82L-Parental) were transfected with wild-type EGF receptors (these include two separate transfectants designated as B82L-wt and B82L-wt2) or mutant human EGF receptors. A cell clone possessing laminin binding activity was also isolated from B82L-wt cells (labeled as Clone B3) (42Lin M. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The two EGF receptor mutants used in these studies include a construct encoding a kinase-inactive receptor that contains a lysine to methionine substitution at residue 721 (B82L-K721M), which is involved in ATP binding, and a construct encoding a kinase-active receptor that has been truncated at residue 1022 (B82L-c'1022), which lacks four major receptor autophosphorylation sites. These cell lines were used to explore the involvement of EGF receptor activation in cell migration toward various ECM components. Cell migration is a process that requires temporally and spatially coordinated cell attachment and detachment (24Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar, 25Huttenlocher A. Sandborg R.R. Horwitz A.F. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1995; 7: 697-706Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar). Given the importance of adhesive strength between the cell and the substrate in determining the migration speed and persistence, we tested whether EGF could influence the adhesiveness of Clone B3 cells on several ECM substrates. As shown in Fig.1 A, when Clone B3 cells were plated onto fibronectin-coated wells in the presence of different levels of EGF, the ability of these cells to spread on the fibronectin surface was attenuated in a time- and EGF dose-dependent manner. In the absence of EGF, nearly all the clone B3 cells were attached to the fibronectin surface in the first 30 min. Within 1 h, the cells became flattened and exhibited the characteristic protrusive structures of spreading cells, a process that was completed by 2.5 h after plating. However, upon the addition of EGF, cell spreading was impaired, i.e. the cells remained in a rounded shape for a longer period of time and appeared to form fewer focal contacts as assessed by immunofluorescent staining of vinculin (data not shown). As also illustrated in Fig. 1 A, the addition of 10 nm EGF delayed cell spreading until 1.5 h after plating, whereas the presence of 50 nm EGF suppressed the initiation of cell spreading to approximately 2.5 h after plating. Because Clone B3 cells express receptors for other ECM proteins such as laminin and vitronectin, we examined the effects of EGF on Clone B3 spreading onto laminin or vitronectin-coated wells. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 1 A, the addition of EGF was found to dose-dependently reduce the capacity of the cells to spread on all three substrates tested (Fig. 1 B). It was also noted that the spreading of these mouse fibroblasts onto laminin- or vitronectin-coated wells was less extensive than that observed on fibronectin-coated surfaces. Polylysine was used as a negative control for cell spreading onto ECM components because cells attach to polylysine without the activation of integrin-associated processes (45Miyamoto S. Teramoto H. Gutkind J.S. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 1633-1642Crossref PubMed Scopus (680) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EGF treatment had no effect on the attachment of Clone B3 cells onto fibronectin and laminin, as measured by the number of cells adhered to these ECM substrates (data not shown). These results suggest that EGF does not substantially regulate the initial interaction between the cell surface integrins, but that the later events (e.g. focal contacts maturation and stress fiber formation) are more likely to be EGF-sensitive. Based on the ability of EGF to modulate the adhesiveness of Clone B3 cells on various substrates, we investigated whether EGF could regulate the chemotactic capacity of Clone B3 cells using a 48-well chemotaxis chamber. As shown in Fig.2 A, EGF synergized with laminin in enhancing the migratory activity of these cells. This synergistic effect of EGF on cell chemotaxis was about 2–3-fold above that observed with laminin alone, whereas EGF alone had little or no effect on cell migration. Interestingly, the effect of EGF on laminin-induced chemotaxis could only be achieved when EGF was co-present with laminin in the lower wells. When EGF was mixed with the cells located in the upper wells, EGF was unable to augment laminin-induced chemotaxis. Because the development of cell polarization, such as the formation of distinct cellular leading and trailing edges, is essential for directional cell movement (24Lauffenburger D.A. Horwitz A.F. Cell. 1996; 84: 359-369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3291) Google Scholar), our findings suggest that EGF, when co-present with laminin, may help to enhance the cell polarization required for directional cell movement by forming an EGF concentration gradient parallel to the laminin gradient. Conversely, when EGF is present with the cells in the upper wells, the cells were exposed to EGF from all directions, and thus may not be able to enhance a polarization process. Although several studies have shown that EGF can stimulate cell movement (14Klemke R.L. Yebra M. Bayna E.M. Cheresh D.A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 859-866Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 16Matthay M.A. Thiery J.P. Lafont F. Stampfer F. Boyer B. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 106: 869-878PubMed Google Scholar, 17Chen P.

Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar, 46Westermark K. Nilsson M. Ebendal T. Westermark B. Endocrinology. 1991; 12: 2180-2186Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar), this appears to be the first report concerning the importance of EGF positioning in promoting directional cell movement. To further test the hypothesis that EGF-induced cell polarization is important in facilitating cell migration toward laminin, EGF was added to both the lower and upper wells, based on the rationale that the uniform exposure of cells to EGF would disrupt the cell polarization induced by EGF present with laminin in the lower wells. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the maximal cell migration induced by the co-presentation of laminin and EGF (1 nm) in the lower wells was reduced in a dose-dependent fashion (33–85%) when EGF (1–10 nm) was also mixed with cells in the upper wells. These studies further support the concept that the stimulation of cells with a co-gradient of laminin and EGF facilitates cell polarization and efficient directional cell locomotion. Clone B3 cells were isolated by their ability to bind laminin (42Lin M. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To assess whether the effects of EGF on cell migration were restricted to laminin, we performed similar migration assays using fibronectin and vitronectin as the chemoattractants. We found that EGF addition to the upper wells had no measurable effects on fibronectin or vitronectin-induced chemotaxis (data not shown); however, when EGF was mixed with fibronectin or vitronectin in the lower wells, EGF substantially elevated Clone B3 cell migration (Fig.3, A and B). Moreover, because Clone B3 cells were isolated from B82L fibroblasts that were transfected with the human EGF receptor (B82L-wt) (42Lin M. Bertics P.J. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 164: 593-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), we compared the chemotactic capacity of Clone B3 and B82L-wt cells in order to ascertain whether EGF stimulation of cell migration reflected clonal variation. We observed that both cell types exhibited comparable responses to EGF, fibronectin, and vitronectin (Fig.3 C). The arginine-glycine-aspartate (RGD) sequence on many matrix proteins, including fibronectin and vitronectin, has been shown to interact directly with cell surface receptor integrins (34Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (9026) Google Scholar). Synthetic RGDS peptides can block such matrix-integrin interactions. To identify whether ECM-induced chemotaxis was mediated by integrins, Clone B3 cells were mixed with RGDS peptides before they were placed into the chemotaxis chamber. As shown in Fig. 4, the migration of Clone B3 cells toward fibronectin or vitronectin in the absence or presence of EGF were almost completely blocked by RGDS peptides but not by the control peptide SDGRG, whereas laminin-induced migration was not affected by RGDS peptides at the same concentrations (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the previous finding that, although the RGD sequence is present in the A chain of murine laminin, it is cryptic, and therefore not accessible in native laminin (47Beck K. Hunter I. Engel J. FASEB J. 199"
https://openalex.org/W2052991119,"Cartilage matrix protein (CMP; also known as matrilin-1), one of the major noncollagenous proteins in most cartilages, binds to aggrecan and type II collagen. We examined the effect of CMP on the adhesion of chondrocytes and fibroblasts using CMP-coated dishes. The CMP coating at 10–20 μg/ml enhanced the adhesion and spreading of rabbit growth plate, resting and articular chondrocytes, and fibroblasts and human epiphyseal chondrocytes and MRC5 fibroblasts. The effect of CMP on the spreading of chondrocytes was synergistically increased by native, but not heated, type II collagen (gelatin). The monoclonal antibody to integrin α1 or β1 abolished CMP-induced cell adhesion and spreading, whereas the antibody to integrin α2, α3, α5, β2, α5β1, or αVβ5had little effect on cell adhesion or spreading. The antibody to integrin α1, but not to other subunits, coprecipitated125I-CMP that was added to MRC5 cell lysates, indicating the association of CMP with the integrin α1 subunit. Unlabeled CMP competed for the binding to integrin α1with 125I-CMP. These findings suggest that CMP is a potent adhesion factor for chondrocytes, particularly in the presence of type II collagen, and that integrin α1β1 is involved in CMP-mediated cell adhesion and spreading. Since CMP is expressed almost exclusively in cartilage, this adhesion factor, unlike fibronectin or laminin, may play a special role in the development and remodeling of cartilage.

The role of CMP is unknown, but it may have a structural role, modulating physical properties of cartilage, or may be involved in matrix-cell interactions. CMP exists in vivo as a homotrimer of 148 kDa, as measured by sedimentation equilibrium centrifugation, although estimates of the molecular mass of this protein by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) yield a higher value. CMP migrates at positions corresponding to 215 and 60 kDa under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively, during SDS-PAGE (2Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G.

The subunits of CMP are connected in the C-terminal region by disulfide bonding and the presence of the coiled-coil α-helical assembly domain (9Kiss I. Deak F. Holloway Jr., R.G. Delius H.

A type A-like domain is present in several proteins such as complement factors B and C2; type VI, XII, XIV, and XVI collagens; and α subunits of several integrins (13Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Some members of this protein family are involved in cell adhesion. However, whether CMP is an adhesion factor remains unknown. Numerous adhesion proteins are recognized by integrins, which are heterodimeric proteins with two (α and β) membrane-spanning subunits. The extracellular domain of the α subunit has divalent cation-binding sites (14Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (3814) Google Scholar). The α subunits play crucial roles in determining the ligand specificity. Chondrocytes express integrins α1β1, α2β1, α3β1, α5β1, αVβ3, and αVβ5(15Woods Jr., V.L. Schreck P.J. Gesink D.S. Pacheco H.O.

In this study, we examined the effect of coating culture dishes with CMP on cell adhesion and investigated whether CMP interacts with integrins using 125I-CMP and various anti-integrin antibodies. In addition, we examined whether collagen modulates the effect of CMP on cell adhesion. The results show that CMP markedly enhances the adhesion and spreading of chondrocytes, particularly in the presence of type II collagen, and that integrin α1β1 plays a pivotal role in the CMP-mediated cell adhesion.

SDS-PAGE analysis showed that purified CMP migrated as a single band at a position corresponding to 215 and 60 kDa under nonreducing and reducing conditions, respectively (Fig.1), as expected from previous studies (2Winterbottom N.

Cultures were incubated in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 in a humidified incubator. CMP, bovine type II collagen (acid-soluble, pepsin-resistant; Koken, Osaka, Japan), or both at various concentrations were incubated in 50 μl of PBS containing 10 mm NaHCO3 in 6-mm plastic microwells (Falcon-3072, Becton Dickinson, or Sumilon MS-8096, Sumitomo Bakelite, Osaka) at 4 °C for 18 h. The substrata were washed three times with PBS and then incubated with 50 μl of PBS containing 10 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA; Sigma) at room temperature for 2 h to block nonspecific cell attachment. When the cultures became 80% confluent, the chondrocytes or fibroblasts were preincubated with 10 μg/ml cycloheximide for 2 h and then harvested with PBS containing 0.1% trypsin and 0.1% EDTA. The cells were seeded at 5 × 103 cells/6-mm plastic tissue culture microwell (Falcon-3072) coated with CMP and incubated at 37 °C for 15 min to 2 h in 0.1 ml of α-modified Eagle's medium containing 1 mg/ml BSA, 25 μg/ml ascorbic acid, 32 units/ml penicillin, 60 μg/ml kanamycin, and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide (medium A) or in 0.1 ml of 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) containing 0.9% NaCl, 1 mg/ml BSA, and 10 μg/ml cycloheximide. All cells dropped to the bottom of the dishes within 15 min after seeding if they did not attach to the culture surface. Spread cells were distinguishable by their cellular projections. Round and spread cells were separately counted under a phase-contrast microscope. At least 60–80 cells were evaluated, and the percentage of spread cells to total cells was calculated. In some experiments, cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 cells/6-mm plastic non-tissue culture microwell (Sumilon MS-8096) coated with CMP and then incubated at 37 °C for 1–2 h in 0.1 ml of medium A. Nonadherent cells were removed by gentle rinsing, and the number of adherent cells in each microwell was then quantified using an aqueous soluble tetrazolium/formazan assay (Promega, Madison, WI) (27Cory A.H. Owen T.C. Barltrop J.A. Cory J.G. Cancer Commun. 1991; 3: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (1268) Google Scholar). CMP was labeled with125I using chloramine T (ICN Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, CA). CMP (0.1 mg) was dissolved in 0.25 ml of 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5), mixed with 10 μl of Na125I solution (100 mCi/ml in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5)), and then incubated with 2 μl of chloramine-T solution (1 mg/ml in 0.1m sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5)) for 1 min. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 2.5 μl of Na2S2O5 solution (1 mg/ml in 0.1m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5)). The reaction mixture was applied to a Sephadex G-10 column (1 ml) that was equilibrated with 0.1m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5). SDS-PAGE analysis showed that this preparation of 125I-CMP migrated at a position corresponding to 60 kDa even under nonreducing conditions. When human fibroblasts (MRC5) were grown to 80% confluence, the cells were incubated for 5 h with PBS containing 0.5 mmCaCl2, 2.5 mm N-ethylmaleimide, and 0.8 mg/ml pure bacterial collagenase (type VII, Sigma) at 37 °C. The cells were washed twice with PBS and then incubated with PBS containing 0.1% EDTA and 0.1% trypsin for 3 min. The dispersed cells were transferred to small plastic tubes, washed three times with PBS, and then incubated for 30 min with RIPA buffer (1% Nonidet P-40 and 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 0.15 m NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride) at 4 °C. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by protein G-Sepharose beads (Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden) to remove proteins that nonspecifically bound to the beads. Lysates were analyzed for protein using a protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). The MRC5 cell lysate (100 μl, 450 μg/ml protein) was incubated at 4 °C with125I-CMP (2000 cpm, 150 ng of protein in 1 μl of 0.1m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5)) for 2 h and then mixed with rabbit antiserum to integrin (α1, α2, αV, β1, or β5), rabbit antiserum to human type I collagen, or rabbit nonimmune serum (1 μl) and a 1:1 suspension of protein G-Sepharose in RIPA buffer (40 μl). The suspension was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. The protein G-Sepharose beads with bound immune complexes were washed five times with RIPA buffer and then boiled in Laemmli buffer (40 μl). Laemmli buffer-resolved proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE. The gel with the fractionated proteins was dried and exposed to x-ray film (Eastman Kodak Co.). When MRC5 fibroblasts were grown to 80% confluence, the cells were harvested with PBS containing 0.1% EDTA and 0.1% trypsin. Cells in suspension were incubated with 10 ml of PBS containing 10 μg/ml NHS-LC-biotin (Pierce) on ice for 90 min and then washed twice with PBS. The cells were dissolved with RIPA buffer and triturated intermittently for 30 min. Insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was precleared by protein G-Sepharose beads. Lysates were analyzed for protein using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit mentioned above. The biotin-labeled cell lysates (100 μl) were incubated with 1 μl of rabbit anti-integrin α1 antiserum or rabbit nonimmune serum at 4 °C for 2 h. Immune complexes were then incubated with a 1:1 suspension of protein G-Sepharose in RIPA buffer (40 μl) at 4 °C for 2 h. The Sepharose beads with bound immune complexes were washed five times with RIPA buffer and then boiled in Laemmli buffer (40 μl). Laemmli buffer-resolved proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (28Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Bio/Technology. 1992; 24: 145-149PubMed Google Scholar). The membrane was blocked with BSA and incubated for 1 h in streptavidin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (Amersham International, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Biotinylated proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham International) and then exposed to x-ray film. Conventional immunohistochemistry showed that CMP was present in the territorial and interterritorial matrixes in fetal bovine rib cartilage (10Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amount of CMP in the interterritorial matrix was less than that in the territorial matrix (10Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In human arthritic articular cartilage, CMP was present near or within chondrocytes, but was barely detectable in the interterritorial matrix (8Okimura A. Okada Y. Makihira S. Pan H. Yu L. Tanne K. Imai K. Yamada H. Kawamoto T. Noshiro M. Yan W. Kato Y. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). In this study, we examined CMP in the resting cartilage (Fig. 2 A) and the matrix-forming (prehypertrophic) zone of the growth plate (Fig.2 B) of newborn pigs, using the anti-CMP antiserum and confocal microscopy. In these cartilages, CMP was concentrated near the cell surface (Fig. 2, A and B). No stain was observed with the control serum (Fig. 2 C). CMP is present in the pericellular matrix (Fig. 2). In addition, CMP has type A-like domains that may be involved in cell adhesion (13Colombatti A. Bonaldo P. Blood. 1991; 77: 2305-2315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore hypothesized that CMP may be an adhesion factor. To test this hypothesis, we seeded rabbit articular chondrocytes on plastic tissue culture dishes coated with various concentrations of CMP and incubated them at 37°C for 2 h in the presence of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis. Round and spread cells were separately counted using a phase-contrast microscope. The chondrocytes spread rapidly on the CMP-coated dishes, whereas only a few cells spread on the dishes not coated with CMP (Fig. 3 A,inserts a and b). The percentage of spread cells to total cells on the CMP (20 μg/ml)-coated dishes was 42% compared with 3% on the control dishes (Fig. 3 A). This stimulation of spreading was induced when dishes were preincubated with CMP at 2 μg/ml and became almost maximal at 20 μg/ml (Fig. 3 A). In another experiment, adherent cells were quantified using an aqueous soluble tetrazolium/formazan assay. CMP enhanced the adhesion of chondrocytes in a similar dose-dependent fashion (Fig.3 B). Fig. 4 shows that CMP was effective in stimulating the spreading of rabbit growth plate chondrocytes (rGC), rabbit articular chondrocytes (rAC), human embryonic chondrocytes (hEC), rabbit fibroblasts (rFB), and human MRC5 fibroblasts (hFB). Since CMP binds to type II collagen (2Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), we examined whether type II collagen modulates the effect of CMP on the spreading of chondrocytes. A low concentration of CMP (0.5 μg/ml) enhanced the spreading of chondrocytes in the presence, but not absence, of type II collagen (3 μg/ml) (Fig.5 A). This synergism between CMP and collagen was observed 15 min after cell seeding and was sustained for at least 60 min (Fig. 5 A). The concentration of CMP required for cell spreading was 20–200-fold higher in the absence of type II collagen than in its presence (Fig. 5 B). At high concentrations (3–10 μg/ml), type II collagen alone stimulated cell spreading (Fig. 5 C). CMP at 0.5 μg/ml increased this effect of type II collagen by 3–4-fold. The synergism between CMP and collagen was not observed with denatured type II collagen (gelatin) that was boiled for 5 min at pH 3.0, although gelatin alone had a greater effect on cell spreading than type II collagen alone (Fig. 5 D). Although CMP plus collagen produced a synergistic stimulation of cell spreading, our subsequent studies of CMP-recognizing integrins were carried out without collagen because collagen alone modulates integrin activity. The presence of collagen makes the interpretation of the data difficult. Since integrins require divalent cations to bind ligands, we examined whether EDTA inhibits cell adhesion to CMP. The addition of EDTA at 2 mm (but not 1 mm) to α-modified Eagle's medium suppressed the spreading of chondrocytes on CMP-coated dishes (Fig. 6 A). The concentrations of Mg2+ and Ca2+ in α-modified Eagle's medium are 0.8 and 1.8 mm, respectively. When chondrocytes were suspended in 10 mm Hepes (pH 7.4) containing 0.9% NaCl, few cells were attached on CMP-coated dishes. However, the addition of Mg2+ to the buffer markedly enhanced the cell spreading on CMP-coated dishes (Fig. 6 B). This was induced at a Mg2+ concentration of 1–2 mm and increased dose-dependently at least until 5 mm. Mn2+ had a greater effect on cell spreading on CMP-coated dishes than Mg2+ at 1–2 mm (Fig.6 C). Ca2+ had less effect on cell spreading than Mg2+ and Mn2+(Fig. 6 D). Since antibodies to rabbit integrins are rather difficult to obtain, we used antibodies to human integrins. Unless otherwise specified, a human fibroblast cell line (MRC5) was used because it was difficult to obtain human chondrocytes in primary cultures. The spreading of MRC5 fibroblasts on CMP-coated dishes was suppressed by the mAb against integrin α1 or β1 (Fig.7). The mAb against α2, α3, α5, β2, α5β1, or αVβ5, as well as control IgG, had little effect on cell spreading on CMP-coated dishes. The inhibition of the CMP-induced cell adhesion by the mAb to integrin α1 or β1, but not other mAbs, was observed with human chondrocytes using an aqueous soluble tetrazolium/formazan assay (Fig. 8). These findings suggest that the integrin α1 and β1 subunits were involved in the cell adhesion and spreading on CMP-coated dishes.Figure 8Inhibition of adhesion of human embryonic chondrocytes to CMP by mAbs to human integrins. Human embryonic chondrocytes were incubated for 2 h on dishes coated with CMP in medium A containing 3 or 10 μg/ml mouse IgG (open circles) or mAb to human integrin α1 (5E8D9) (closed circles), α2 (P1E6) (open triangles), α3 (P1B5) (closed triangles), or β1 (DE9) (open squares). After gentle washing, adherent cells were quantified using an aqueous soluble tetrazolium/formazan assay. The values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We next examined whether125I-CMP added to the cell lysates is coprecipitated with integrin subunits using antibodies to the α1, α2, αV, β1, and β5 subunits. After iodination, CMP did not form trimers even under nonreducing conditions during electrophoresis in the presence of SDS, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” However, 125I-CMP enhanced cell adhesion at 10 μg/ml. 2The percentage of spread articular chondrocytes to total cells on dishes coated with 125I-CMP (10 μg/ml) at 2 h was 13 ± 2% compared with 4 ± 2 or 18 ± 3% on dishes not coated or coated with native CMP (10 μg/ml), respectively. The values are the means ± S.D. of triplicate determinations. The lysates of MRC5 cells that were dispersed with bacterial collagenase and trypsin were incubated with 125I-CMP in the presence of rabbit antiserum to a human integrin subunit (α1, α2, αV, β1, or β5), rabbit antiserum to human type I collagen, or nonimmune rabbit serum, and then the material precipitated with protein G-Sepharose was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Of these sera, only the antiserum to integrin α1 precipitated 125I-CMP in the lysates (Fig.9 A, panel a). No125I-CMP directly bound to the antibodies in the absence of the lysates (Fig. 9 A, panel b). The antiserum to integrin α1 precipitated the 200-kDa integrin α1 subunit in MRC5 lysates (Fig. 9 B). The molecular mass of the integrin α1 subunit in human chondrocytes is ∼200 kDa under nonreducing conditions (15Woods Jr., V.L. Schreck P.J. Gesink D.S. Pacheco H.O. Amiel D. Akeson W.H. Lotz M. Arthritis Rheum. 1994; 37: 537-544Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). In other experiments, the mAb to integrin α1 also coprecipitated125I-CMP in the cell lysates, although the125I-CMP level precipitated with this mAb was lower than the precipitated level with the polyclonal antibodies to integrin α1 (data not shown). In the presence of increasing concentrations of 125I-CMP and the antiserum to integrin α1, the precipitation of125I-CMP was detectable at 15 ng/ml 125I-CMP and increased with the increase in 125I-CMP, at least until 1.5 μg/ml (Fig. 10 A). In contrast, the control serum did not precipitate 125I-CMP even at the highest concentration of 125I-CMP (1.5 μg/ml) (Fig. 10 A). Next, the cell lysates were incubated in the presence of 1.5 μg/ml 125I-CMP, the antiserum to the integrin α1 subunit, and increasing concentrations of unlabeled native CMP. The native CMP decreased the precipitated level of 125I-CMP dose-dependently (Fig.10 B). The biological role of CMP is not known, although it is one of the major noncollagenous proteins in growth plates, tracheal cartilage, and other cartilages (4Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Okimura A. Okada Y. Makihira S. Pan H. Yu L. Tanne K. Imai K. Yamada H. Kawamoto T. Noshiro M. Yan W. Kato Y. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 29Paulsson M. Inerot S. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1984; 221: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It constitutes up to 5% of the wet weight of tracheal cartilage (4Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1982; 207: 207-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). CMP may stabilize the cartilage matrix and alter the tensile strength and elasticity of the matrix by binding to collagen and aggrecan. Although articular chondrocytes do not usually synthesize CMP, CMP synthesis is markedly enhanced in arthritic joints (8Okimura A. Okada Y. Makihira S. Pan H. Yu L. Tanne K. Imai K. Yamada H. Kawamoto T. Noshiro M. Yan W. Kato Y. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), suggesting that CMP may be involved in the destruction and/or remodeling of cartilage. Our immunohistochemical analyses showed that unlike aggrecan and type II collagen, CMP is concentrated near the chondrocyte surface in vivo. This observation, as well as the presence of the type A-like domain on CMP, suggested that CMP could be involved in the matrix-cell interaction. We tested this hypothesis and showed for the first time that CMP is an adhesion protein for chondrocytes and fibroblasts. The physiological significance of the CMP-induced spreading of fibroblasts is not known. However, CMP may function as an adhesion factor for fibroblast cells in eye tissues, notochord, and tendon that contain CMP at low levels (5Tsonis P.A. Goetinck P.F. Exp. Eye Res. 1988; 46: 753-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 6Stirpe N.S. Goetinck P.F. Development (Camb.). 1989; 107: 23-33PubMed Google Scholar, 7Hauser N. DiCesare P.E. Paulsson M. Acta Orthop. Scand. 1995; 266 (suppl.): 19-21Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that CMP binds to type II collagenin vitro (2Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), and immunostained transmission electron microscopy has shown that CMP binds to the exterior of the collagen fibril in vivo (2Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). CMP distributes along type II collagen fibers with a periodicity of 59 nm (2Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). However, the biological significance of the CMP-type II collagen complex is not known. We showed here that native, but not denatured, type II collagen increases the effect of CMP on the spreading of chondrocytes. This finding suggests that CMP attached on type II collagen fibers more efficiently concentrates CMP receptors/integrins at adhesion plaques than CMP alone attached uniformly on a plastic or gelatin surface. We also observed that fibronectin and laminin did not produce a synergistic stimulation of cell spreading in the presence of type II collagen (data not shown), although fibronectin and laminin bind to collagen; this distinguishes the role of CMP in cartilage from those of fibronectin and laminin. CMP forms two types of filamentous networks in the pericellular matrix: one that contains type II collagen and another that does not contain type II collagen (30Chen Q. Johnson D.M. Haudenschild D.R. Tondravi M.M. Goetinck P.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1995; 6: 1743-1753Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The collagen-independent CMP filaments may also serve as a scaffold for cell adhesion in vivo because CMP at high concentrations (10–20 μg/ml) enhanced cell spreading in the absence of type II collagen in vitro. In tracheal cartilage, CMP binds to aggrecan noncovalently and covalently, and the covalent cross-linking to the aggrecan core protein increases with age (3Hauser N. Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Morgelin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32247-32252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The CMP-aggrecan complex is unlikely to enhance the adhesion or spreading of chondrocytes because aggrecan suppresses cell adhesion in vitro (31Yamagata M. Suzuki S. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8012-8018Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we examined whether integrins are involved in the CMP-induced cell adhesion. In our assays, the CMP-induced cell spreading required Mg2+ or Mn2+. Ca2+ had less effect on the cell spreading than Mg2+ and Mn2+. This is consistent with results from extensive studies of the effect of divalent cations on integrin activity (32Elices M.J. Urry L.A. Hemler M.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 169-181Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar, 33Loeser R.F. Carlson C.S. McGee M.P. Exp. Cell Res. 1995; 217: 248-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). The mAb to human integrin α1 or β1 suppressed the adhesion and spreading of human chondrocytes and human MRC5 fibroblasts on dishes coated with CMP. The other tested mAbs to various integrins had a marginal effect on cell adhesion or spreading on CMP-coated dishes. These findings suggest that integrin α1β1 plays a pivotal role in the CMP-mediated cell adhesion and spreading. Of the various antibodies to integrin subunits examined here, only the antibody to integrin α1 coprecipitated125I-CMP in cell lysates. Unlabeled native CMP competed for the binding to integrin α1 with 125I-CMP. Although the anti-integrin β1 mAb inhibited the effect of CMP on cell adhesion, this mAb (data not shown), as well as the antiserum to integrin β1, did not consistently precipitate 125I-CMP in cell lysates. Under these conditions, the antibody to integrin β1 may coprecipitate the α1 subunit only at low levels. In addition, the affinity of integrin β1 for CMP may decrease in the absence of the intact plasma membrane. In any case, our findings suggest that CMP selectively binds to the integrin α1subunit even in the presence of detergents (Nonidet P-40 and SDS). Integrin α1β1, as well as α2β1, binds to collagen under some experimental conditions. However, the precipitation of CMP with anti-integrin α1 antibodies is not due to the binding of CMP to collagen because 125I-CMP used in this study did not bind to type I, II, III, IV or V collagen. 3S. Makihira, unpublished data. Furthermore, the lysates were prepared after cells were dispersed from the cell layer with bacterial pure collagenase at a high concentration (0.8 mg/ml) and trypsin. No type I collagen was detected in the cell lysates by immunoblotting.3 Chondroadherin is also an adhesion protein prominently expressed in cartilage and binds to integrin α2β1 (34Camper L. Heinegård D. Lundgren Akerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Chondroadherin can promote cell adhesion, but not spreading (34Camper L. Heinegård D. Lundgren Akerlund E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 1159-1167Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), whereas CMP enhances both cell adhesion and spreading. These findings suggest that CMP and chondroadherin have different roles in cartilage. Whether CMP has a special role in cartilage in the presence of other adhesion proteins is not known. It is noteworthy, however, that genetic variation at the CMP gene locus was found to be significantly associated with hip radiographically evident osteoarthritis in 55–65-year-old men, whereas a significant association between hip or knee radiographically evident osteoarthritis in men or women and the cartilage link protein gene was not observed (35Meulenbelt I. Bijkerk C. de Wildt S.C. Miedema H.S. Valkenburg H.A. Breedveld F.C. Pols H.A. Te Koppele J.M. Sloos V.F. Hofman A. Slagboom P.E. van Duijn C.M. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1760-1765Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Typically, hip radiographically evident osteoarthritis is most frequently present in men in the 55–65-year age group. Radiographically evident osteoarthritis particularly of the hip is often considered to arise due to anatomic abnormalities. During endochondral bone formation, the length and shape of the bone are determined. If CMP protein plays a distinctive role in the matrix-cell interaction during endochondral bone formation, genetic variation at the CMP gene locus may alter the shape of the skeleton. In addition, CMP may modulate the matrix-cell interaction in articular cartilage of osteoarthritic joints (8Okimura A. Okada Y. Makihira S. Pan H. Yu L. Tanne K. Imai K. Yamada H. Kawamoto T. Noshiro M. Yan W. Kato Y. Arthritis Rheum. 1997; 40: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). cDNAs encoding CMP-like proteins (matrilin-2 and -3) were recently cloned (36Deak F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 37Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M.

Matrilin-2 is expressed in a variety of organs, but not in cartilage (36Deak F. Piecha D. Bachrati C. Paulsson M. Kiss I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9268-9274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar), whereas matrilin-3 is expressed in a cartilage-specific manner (37Wagener R. Kobbe B. Paulsson M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 413: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar, 38Belluoccio D. Trueb B. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 212-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Matrilin-3 and CMP form disulfide-linked hetero-oligomers in bovine epiphyseal cartilage (39Wu J.J. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17433-17438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). These proteins may also function as adhesion factors since their modular structure is similar to that of CMP. In conclusion, CMP was found to be an adhesion factor for fibroblasts and chondrocytes. CMP is the first protein observed to synergistically increase the effect of collagen on adhesion and spreading. Integrin α1β1 seems to be involved in the CMP-induced cell adhesion. The cartilage-specific adhesion protein CMP may play an important role in the development and repair of skeletal tissues.

We examined the mechanisms by which PTH inhibits NHE-3 activity by giving an acute intravenous PTH bolus to parathyroidectomized rats. Parathyroidectomy per se increased apical membrane NHE-3 activity and antigen. Acute infusion of PTH caused a time-dependent decrease in NHE-3 activity as early as 30 min. Decrease in NHE-3 activity at 30 and 60 min was accompanied by increased NHE-3 phosphorylation. In contrast to the rapid changes in NHE-3 activity and phosphorylation, decrease in apical membrane NHE-3 antigen was not detectable until 4–12 h after the PTH bolus. The decrease in apical membrane NHE-3 occurred in the absence of changes in total renal cortical NHE-3 antigen. Pretreatment of the animals with the microtubule-disrupting agent colchicine blocked the PTH-induced decrease in apical NHE-3 antigen. We propose that PTH acutely cause a decrease in NHE-3 intrinsic transport activity possibly via a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism followed by a decrease in apical membrane NHE-3 antigen via changes in protein trafficking.

PTH 1The abbreviations used are: PTH, parathyroid hormone(s); PKA, protein kinase A; PTX, parathyroidectomy; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.1The abbreviations used are: PTH, parathyroid hormone(s); PKA, protein kinase A; PTX, parathyroidectomy; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. plays a paramount role in mammalian calcium homeostasis. The calcitropic actions of PTH include direct stimulation of bone turnover (1Holtrop M.E. King J.E. Cox K.A. Reit B.A. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1979; 27: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) and renal Ca absorption (2Suki W.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1979; 237: F1-F6Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and indirect enhancement of intestinal Ca absorption via its action on 1,25-vitamin D3 (3Kawashima H. Kurokawa K. Miner. Electrolyte Metab. 1982; 9: 227-235Google Scholar). In the kidney, PTH exerts direct action on the proximal tubule, thick ascending limb, distal convoluted tubule, and connecting tubule (4Chabardes D. Imbert M. Clique A. Montegut M. Morel F. Pflügers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 1975; 354: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 5Kurokawa K. Fukagawa M. Hayashi M. Saruta T. Seldin D.W. Giebisch G. The Kidney: Physiology and pathophysiology. 2nd Ed. Raven Press, Ltd., New York1992Google Scholar). In the proximal tubule, PTH is a potent inhibitor of NaHCO3 absorption (6Agus Z.S. Gardner L.B.

Because proximal tubule calcium and sodium absorption are tightly coupled (6Agus Z.S. Gardner L.B. Beck L.H. Goldberg M. Am. J. Physiol. 1973; 224: F1143-F1148Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar,13Friedman P.A. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 179-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar), the potent inhibitory action of PTH on proximal NaHCO3transport appears to be counterproductive for an anticalciuric hormone. Moreover, the acute inhibition of proximal tubule NaHCO3absorption seems to serve little purpose because the HCO3exiting the proximal tubule is largely reclaimed in the distal nephron as evident by the fact that acute PTH only cause modest reductions in plasma HCO3 concentration (14Hulter H.N. Toto R.D. Ilnicki L.P. Halloran B. Sebastian A. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F450-F461PubMed Google Scholar, 15Hulter H.N. Peterson J.C.

However, in the distal convoluted tubule, luminal HCO3 is an important stimulus for transcellular calcium absorption (17Sutton R.A. Wong N.L.M. Dirks J.H. Kidney Int. 1979; 15: 520-533Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 18Marone C.C. Wong N.L. Sutton R.A. Dirks J.H. J. Lab. Clin.

Thus the shift of NaHCO3 absorption from proximal to distal nephron results in minimal net change in acid-base balance but serves as a key enhancer of the anticalciuric effect of PTH. In the mammalian proximal tubule, two-thirds of the transcellular NaHCO3 absorption is mediated by apical membrane Na/H exchange (20Preisig P.A. Ives H.E. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Alpern R.J.

Phosphorylation of NHE-3 has been shown to play a role in its acute regulation by protein kinase A (PKA) (38Moe O.W. Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. J. Clin.

One study showed that the PTH-induced decrease in apical membrane Na/H exchange activity was accompanied by commensurate increase in Na/H exchange activity in a different membrane fraction on a density gradient (41Hensley C.B. Bradley M.E. Mircheff A.K. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: C637-C645Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This suggests redistribution of NHE-3 protein as a mechanism of its acute regulation, although there were no antigenic data in this study. NHE-3 protein has been shown to exist both in the apical membrane and in subapical vesicles (23Biemesderfer D. Rutherford P.A. Nagy T. Pizzonia J.H. Abu-Alfa A.K. Aronson P.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: F289-F299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In a model of pressure natriuresis, the acute inhibition of apical membrane Na/H exchange was associated with redistribution of NHE-3 antigen from the apical to subapical region. (42Zhang Y. Mircheff A.K. Hensley C.B. Makyar C.E. Warnock D.G. Chambrey R. Yip K.P. Marsh D.J. Holstein-Rathlou N.H. McDonough A.A. Am. J.

Physiol. 1998; 274: C1090-C1100Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we present evidence in intact animals that PTH inhibits renal cortical apical membrane Na/H exchange by dual mechanisms: immediate inhibition of the intrinsic transport activity of NHE-3 associated with an increase in NHE-3 phosphorylation followed by redistribution of NHE-3 transporter away from the apical membrane to a nonapical pool. Parathyroidectomized or sham-operated Sprague-Dawley rats (150–200 g, Charles River, Wilmington, MA) were given free access to food supplement with 4% (w/v) calcium gluconate drinking water until 2 days prior to experiments when they were switched to tap water. Animals were anesthetized by thiopental (100 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneal; Abbot Laboratories, Abbot Park, IL), the femoral vein was exposed, and either PTH (100 μg/kg body weight; 0.5 mg/ml in 10 mmacetic acid, 0.4 mm dithiothreitol, 1% bovine serum albumin; Peninsula, San Carlos, CA) or the vehicle was injected intravenously. For the 30–60-min time points, animals were kept under anesthesia on a heating pad until bilateral nephrectomy performed through an anterior abdominal incision. For longer time points, the inguinal incision was sutured, and animals were allowed to recover. At the appropriate time points, anesthesia was again induced and kidneys were harvested. Renal cortex was dissected and homogenized on ice in membrane buffer (150 mm NaCl, 80 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, and 2 μg/ml pepstatin A) (Brinkman polytron, Westbury, NY), and apical membrane vesicles were prepared from the cortical homogenate by exposing cortical membranes to three consecutive precipitations by 15 mm MgCl2, and the final apical membrane-enriched vesicles were pelleted from the supernatant (Beckman J2–21 m, JA-20 rotor, 20,000 rpm, 40 min 4 °C; Beckman, Fullerton, CA). For experiments with colchicine, parathyroidectomy (PTX) animals were given colchicine (10 μg/kg body weight) 3 h prior to infusion of PTH or vehicle. For measurement of Na/H exchange activity in rat renal apical membranes, 200 μg of vesicles were acid loaded (300 mm mannitol, 20 mm MES, pH 5.5, at 4 °C for 2 h) and exposed to 10× volume uptake solution (300 mm mannitol, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.1 mm22NaCl) to initiate transport at 20 °C for 10 s. Uptake was stopped by dilution with stop solution (150 mm NaCl, 20 mmTris, pH 7.5) at 4 °C, and 22Na uptake was quantified by rapid filtration on 0.65 μm Millipore filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) and scintillation counting. For determination of NHE-3 antigen, either 20 μg of rat renal cortical apical membranes or 50 μg of cortical membranes were solubilized in SDS buffer, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. Anti-rat NHE-3 antisera were used: 1568 (against epitope DSFLQADGPEEQLQ at 1:1000) (20Preisig P.A. Ives H.E. Cragoe Jr., E.J. Alpern R.J. Rector Jr., F.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 80: 970-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) to quantified NHE-3 antigen. Controls with the anti-Type II sodium phosphate co-transporter NaPi-2 antisera (1:1000 dilution, gift from Drs. Biber and Murer, Zürich, Switzerland) were performed as described previously (44Kempson S.A. Lötscher M. Kaissling B. Biber J. Murer H. Levi M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: F784-F791PubMed Google Scholar). After incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled mouse anti-rabbit secondary antibody, signals were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and quantified by densitometry. OK cells expressing native NHE-3 (47Amemiya M. Yamaji Y. Cano A. Moe O.W. Alpern R.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 269: C126-C133Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) were used as a control experiment to validate the mobility shift assay for NHE-3 phosphorylation. OK cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (removed 48 h prior to study). Phosphorylation experiments were done as described previously (40Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Fan L. Collazo R. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3978-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In brief, confluent monolayers were incubated in phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium and pulsed with [32P]orthophosphate (500 μCi/ml; 120 min). After addition of, 200 μm 8Br-cAMP, cells were lysed with RIPA buffer (300 mm NaCl, 80 mm NaF, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 5 mm EDTA, 10 mm EGTA, 25 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm activated sodium orthovanadate, 50 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, Triton X-100 1% (v/v), deoxycholate 0.5% (w/v), SDS 0.1% (w/v), 100 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 4 μg/ml leupeptin, 4 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml pepstatin), centrifuged (109,000 ×g at rmax, 50,000 rpm, 25 min, 2 °C, Beckman TLX ultracentrifuge, TLA 100.3 rotor, Fullerton, CA), and NHE-3 was immunoprecipitated (antiserum 5683 against a fusion protein of maltose binding protein and OK NHE-3 amino acid 484–839) (1:250 dilution, v/v) from the supernatant. Immunoblots were performed with antiserum 5683) (1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit antibody (1:5000) using ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The 32P content of NHE-3 was visualized by autoradiography on the same filters after decay of ECL. Mobility shift was detected by immunoblot after SDS-PAGE (6% gel with 80-kDa marker ran to the edge of the gel). For treatment with alkaline phosphatase, we modified a protocol described by Jou et al. (48Jou Y.S Matesic D. Dupont E. Lu S.C. Rupp H.L. Madhukar B.V. Oh S.Y. Tosko J.E. Chang C.C. Mol. Carcinog. 1993; 8: 234-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). 20 μg of apical membrane was washed with reaction buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 8 mmMgCl2, 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol (v/v)) three times and resuspended in 45 μl of reaction buffer containing 10 units of calf-intestine alkaline phosphatase. After incubation at 37 °C for 90 min, the reaction was terminated by adding polyacrylamide gel loading buffer. Parathyroidectomy was complete as plasma PTH levels were undetectable in PTX animals (data not shown). Compared with sham operation, parathyroidectomy per seincreased apical NHE-3 activity (35 ± 8%, n = 4,p < 0.05) and antigen (75 ± 8%,n = 4, p < 0.05) and total renal cortical NHE-3 antigen (55 ± 8%, n = 4,p < 0.05) (Fig. 1). This suggests that PTH has a tonic suppressive effect on NHE-3 protein expression. Fig.2 shows a typical experiment where acute intravenous infusion of PTH decreased apical membrane NHE-3 activity in PTX rats in a time-dependent fashion, whereas vehicle injection had no effect. Fig. 3summarizes all the experiments. Significant inhibition was detected as early as 30 min after the bolus of PTH and persisted up to 20 h (percentage of decrease compared with vehicle time control: 30 min, 14 ± 4%; 1 h, 21 ± 6%, 2 h; 28 ± 7%; 4 h, 38 ± 6; 8 h, 35 ± 7%; 12 h, 33 ± 10%; 20 h, 14 ± 9%; 20 h, 15 ± 9%; 24 h, 7 ± 7%; all p < 0.05 except 24 h).Figure 3Effect of acute PTH on apical membrane NHE activity: summary of all experiments. PTH or vehicle was given intravenously into parathyroidectomized (PTX) animals, renal cortical apical membranes were harvested at the indicated time points, and NHE activity was measured by ΔpH-driven 22Na flux. NHE-3 activity of PTH-treated animals are expressed as percentages of the vehicle-injected animals for each time point.

To examine whether PTH acutely modifies NHE-3 phosphorylation in the intact animal, we utilized a mobility shift assay. Fig. 4 A illustrates data validating this assay. We have shown that protein kinase A activation increases NHE-3 phosphorylation in OK cells (40Zhao H. Wiederkehr M.R. Fan L. Collazo R. Crowder L.A. Moe O.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 3978-3987Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). Fig.4 A shows that the cAMP-induced increase in NHE-3 phosphorylation was associated with deceased NHE-3 mobility on SDS-PAGE (Fig. 4 A). Treatment of the same samples with alkaline phosphatase removed the 32P label, increased the mobility of NHE-3, and eliminated the cAMP-induced NHE-3 mobility shift (Fig.4 A). Fig. 4 B shows a similar experiment performed in rat renal cortical apical membranes. An intravenous bolus of 8Br-cAMP (250 μl of 0.43 mg/ml 8Br-cAMP in saline injected into the suprarenal abdominal aorta with transient infrarenal aortic clamping) induced a mobility shift of NHE-3 that was completely abolished byin vitro treatment with alkaline phosphatase. Fig.4 C shows a typical experiment of the effect of PTH on NHE-3 phosphorylation in the intact animal. Acute PTH infusion increased NHE-3 phosphorylation as early as 30 min. Next, we examined whether the decrease in NHE-3 activity is associated with changes in NHE-3 protein abundance in apical and total cortical membranes. Fig.5 A shows a typical experiment. Vehicle injection did not alter NHE-3 protein abundance in the apical or total cortical membranes from 30 min throughout to 16 h, indicating that the anesthesia and intravenous catheterization did not lead to redistribution of NHE-3. From 30 min to 1 h after PTH infusion, although NHE-3 activity was clearly decreased (Fig. 3), there was no detectable change in apical membrane NHE-3 antigen (Fig.5 A). PTH acutely shifts the type IIa sodium phosphate cotransporter NaPi-2 from an apical to a subapical location (44Kempson S.A. Lötscher M. Kaissling B. Biber J. Murer H. Levi M. Am. J.

As a positive control for our negative finding in NHE-3 trafficking after 30 min and 1 h of PTH, we probed the same apical membrane samples after 30 min and 1 h of PTH with an antiserum against NaPi-2. Fig. 5 Bshows that although there was no change in NHE-3 antigen, NaPi-2 underwent dramatic endocytosis after 30 min of PTH as previously shown (44Kempson S.A. Lötscher M. Kaissling B. Biber J.

Fig.6 summarizes all the experiments. No significant decrease of NHE-3 was detected in apical membrane in 30–60 min of PTH, and a trend toward decrease was noted at 2 h (12 ± 7%, p = 0.07). From 4 to 12 h, PTH significantly decreased apical membrane NHE-3 antigen with recovery by 24 h (percentage of decrease, PTH compared with vehicle time control: 30 min, 6 ± 8%; 1 h, 1 ± 4%; 2 h, 12 ± 7%; 4 h, 33 ± 7; 8 h, 38 ± 10%; 12 h, 36 ± 8%; 24 h, 16 ± 12%; allp < 0.05 except 30 min and 1, 2, and 24 h). No change in total cortical NHE-3 antigen was noted in response to acute PTH, although a statistically insignificant decrease occurred after 12 h (15 ± 10% decrease, p = 0.07). In concert, the data suggest that the decrease in apical membrane NHE-3 protein is due to redistribution to a nonapical compartment rather than protein degradation.Figure 6Effect of PTH on NHE-3 antigen: summary of all experiments.

Fig. 7 shows one experiment. Colchicine per se appeared to increase the baseline apical membrane NHE-3 abundance. In the background of colchicine treatment. PTH failed to induce redistribution of NHE-3 (percentage of decrease compared with vehicle time control: 2 h, 3 ± 7%; 4 h, 8 ± 7; 8 h, 5 ± 14%; 24 h, 5 ± 10%; all not significant), suggesting that the decrease in apical membrane NHE-3 is microtubule-dependent (Fig.7 B). The acute inhibition of renal proximal apical membrane Na/H exchange activity by PTH has been shown in renal tubules, membrane vesicles, and cultured cells (26Gesek F.A. Schoolwerth A.C. Am. J.

We found that PTX per seincreased apical membrane NHE-3 activity as described previously (49Cohn D.E. Klahr S. Hammerman M.R. Am. J. Physiol. 1983; 245: F217-F222PubMed Google Scholar), and PTX increased NHE-3 antigen in total renal cortical as well as apical membrane vesicles. This suggests that PTH has a chronic suppressive effect on NHE-3 protein expression. The increase in renal net acid excretion seen in chronic hyperparathyroidism (14Hulter H.N. Toto R.D. Ilnicki L.P.

With a single PTH bolus, we did not observed a statistically significant decrease in total cortical NHE-3 antigen in the PTX animals, although a slight trend was observed at 20 h. It is possible that more sustained or repeated doses of PTH are required to inhibit total cortical NHE-3 protein expression. Both protein kinase C and PKA pathways have been implicated in mediating the effects on PTH on the proximal tubule (27Sasaki S. Marumo F. Am. J.

Pollak M. Hebert S.C. Annu. Rev. Med. 1998; 49: 15-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). The CaR is also expressed in a variety of other sites such as the central nervous system where it may serve functions beyond systemic calcium homeostasis (2Chattopadhyay N. Vassilev P.M. Brown E.M. Biol. Chem. 1997; 378: 759-768PubMed Google Scholar). In amino acid sequence and presumed topographic structure, the CaR is most closely related to a distinct subset of G protein-coupled receptors that includes the metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) (3Okamoto N.

In addition to the seven transmembrane domain characteristic of all G protein-coupled receptors, the CaR and other members of its subset contain a large, ∼600-residue, amino-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) that is heavily glycosylated and contains a large number of highly conserved cysteines (8Brown E.M.

Based on limited amino acid homology to bacterial periplasmic binding proteins, it has been suggested that the ECD of the mGluRs (9O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D.

Nature. 1994; 367: 22Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) has a bi-lobed, “venus flytrap”-like structure; however, there is very little structural or biochemical information available for the CaR or mGluR ECDs. Using tunicamycin, we have previously shown thatN-linked glycosylation of the CaR is essential for its expression at the cell surface (11Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J.

To obtain biochemical and structural information, we developed methods for large scale culture of a cell line stably expressing a mutant form of the human CaR (hCaR) that results in secretion of the ECD into the medium. We report here the purification of the secreted hCaR ECD and results of biochemical analysis, including amino-terminal sequence, carbohydrate content, dimeric structure, and accessibility to tryptic digestion. A mutant form of the full-length human parathyroid CaR cDNA (17Garrett J.E. Capuano I.V. Hammerland L.G. Hung B.C. Brown E.M. Hebert S.C. Nemeth E.F. Fuller F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 12919-12925Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar) in which cysteine 598 was changed to serine and isoleucine 599 was changed to a stop codon (see Fig. 1) was subcloned into NotI/HindIII-digested pCEP4 expression vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The mutant hCaR cDNA was transfected into HEK-293 cells with calcium phosphate, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin was used to select stable transfectants. Resistant colonies were subcloned and screened for hCaR expression by a solution hybridization assay. Clone 32 used in this study was chosen based on high levels of ECD secretion as determined by immunoblot analysis of cell culture media. Cells were routinely cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 1% glutamine, 1% penicillin and streptomycin, and 200 μg/ml hygromycin at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 environment. ECD-secreting clone 32 HEK-293 cells were immobilized on cellulose discs in a packed bed configuration using a 2.2-liter Celligen Plus bioreactor (New Brunswick Scientific, Edison, NJ) with a vertical mixing impeller assembly and internal basket. Production consisted of a propagation stage of approximately 140 h with perfusion of serum-containing media. When a cell density of 2 × 1010 was reached, the second stage was initiated by perfusion with serum-free media for 400 h at a flow rate of 4–6 liters/day while maintaining the residual glucose concentration at 1 g/liter. Perfusate was pumped directly on 100-ml bed volume Q-Sepharose fast flow column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Protein was eluted with a 1m NaCl step elution or 0–1 m NaCl gradient in 0.01 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. ECD-containing fractions were determined by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody, ADD, specific for peptide 214–235 of hCaR (18Goldsmith P.K. Fan G. Miller J.L. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) and were pooled for further purification. ECD protein was purified from fractions obtained from the Q-Sepharose fast flow column using a three step protocol. Fractions collected from each step were monitored by SDS-PAGE. Gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue or used for immunoblotting with ADD monoclonal antibody. ECD-containing fractions in PBS were first run over a 25-ml bed volume RCA-1 lectin agarose column (EY Laboratories Inc., San Mateo, CA) followed by step elution with 0.2 m lactose in PBS. Lectin affinity-purified proteins were further purified by FPLC anion exchange chromatography using a 1-ml bed volume Mono Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with elution at 1 ml/min and a gradient of 0–1 m NaCl in 0.02m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4. ECD-containing fractions from the anion exchange step were concentrated by centrifugal ultrafiltration using Centricon YM-50 units (Amicon Inc., Beverly, MA) before HPLC gel permeation chromatography using a 7.8-mm × 30-cm TSK-3000 column (Tosohaas, Montgomeryville, PA) run at 0.5 ml/min in PBS. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford dye binding method (Bio-Rad). Amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis was performed with a model 477A protein sequencer coupled to a model 120A PTH analyzer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA) according to the manufacturer's program NORMAL-1. Reversed phase analysis of the PTH-derivatives was done using a Brownlee PTH-C-18 column (2.1 × 220 mm). Samples of ECD proteins were analyzed by high performance anionic exchange chromatography on a Dionex system (Dionex Corp., Sunnyvale, CA) equipped with a pulsed amperometric detector PAD2 and a pellicular PA1, 4 × 250 mm anion exchange column. All assays were at room temperature at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min in 16 mm NaOH with sensitivity set at 1 μA. Profiles were recorded, and areas under the curve were integrated. Retention times and calibration standards were monitored immediately before and after determinations of unknown samples to correct for minor variations in the response curves. Circular dichroic spectra were measured in a Jasco J-500C spectrophotometer attached to a DP500N data processor at 25 °C. Protein concentrations were 100 μg/ml in 0.1m phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. Spectra were digitized and analyzed as described previously (19McPhie P. Shrager R.I. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 293: 46-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Measured ellipticities were converted into mean residue ellipticity using Eq. 1. θ=Deflection in millidegrees×10×mean residue weightconc.(mg/ml)×pathlength(cm)×100Equation 1 A value of 110 was used for the mean residue weight. Spectra were analyzed in terms of secondary structures using the CONTIN program (20Provencher S.W. Glockner J. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 33-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (1894) Google Scholar). Five peptides, GP, LSN, ADD, LRG, and DGE, corresponding to sequences within the ECD of the hCaR (see Fig. 1) were synthesized and used for production of affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antibodies as described previously (21Goldsmith P. Gierschik P. Milligan G. Unson C.G. Vinitsky R. Malech H.L. Spiegel A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14683-14688Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Three additional peptide-specific rabbit polyclonal antibodies, FF20-10, FF20-11, and FF20-7, representing other regions of the hCaR ECD (see Fig. 1) were produced as described previously (22Mithal A. Kifor O. Kifor I. Vassilev P. Butters R. Krapcho K. Simin R. Fuller F. Hebert S.C. Brown E.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 3087-3092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Samples of ECD that were to be denatured before tryptic digestion were first heated for 10 min at 100 °C in 0.1% SDS. Digestion of denatured and undenatured ECD samples was performed in 25 mm Hepes buffer, pH 8.0, for varying times at 37 °C using a trypsin:protein ratio of 1:100 (w/w). The reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of SDS-PAGE loading buffer (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207843) Google Scholar). Proteins were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels as described (23Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207843) Google Scholar). For visualization of bands, gels were either stained with Coomassie Blue dye or used for immunoblotting as described previously (11Fan G. Goldsmith P.K. Collins R. Dunn C.K. Krapcho K.J. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. Endocrinol. 1997; 138: 1916-1922Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 18Goldsmith P.K. Fan G. Miller J.L. Rogers K.V. Spiegel A.M. J. Bone Miner. Res. 1997; 12: 1780-1788Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Briefly, after overnight transfer to nitrocellulose membranes at 150 mA constant current, membranes were blocked in 5% horse serum, 0.05 mTris, pH 8.0, 0.5 m NaCl containing 0.1% Tween 20 (TBST) for 1 h. Blots were incubated overnight in horse serum-TBST with first antibodies at a concentration of 2 μg/ml for the antipeptide monoclonal antibody, ADD, and 5 μg/ml for affinity-purified rabbit polyclonal antipeptide antibodies. After washing three times for 20 min with TBST, blots were incubated for 2 h with 1:2,000 dilutions of peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Kierkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) or peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-rabbit antibodies (The Binding Site, San Diego, CA) in horse serum-TBST. Membranes were again washed twice for 10 min with TBST and once with Tris-buffered saline for 10 min and then developed with 4-chloronaphthol as substrate. HEK-293 cells were stably transfected with an episomal vector containing a mutant form of the hCaR cDNA engineered to lead to secretion of the ECD into the culture medium (see Fig.1). A single clone (clone 32) was selected by immunoblot analysis of culture medium for high level secretion of the ECD, and this clone was adapted to large scale culture conditions in a bioreactor for production and purification of the ECD. Analysis of the amino acid sequence of the ECD using the GCG program (Genetics Computer Group, Madison, WI) indicated a protein with a calculated pI of 4.95 and a net of 25 negative charges. The sequence contains 11 putative glycosylation sites, and in the context of the expressed intact receptor, the ECD is known to be heavily glycosylated (8Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M.

Using a lectin affinity chromatography screening kit (EY Laboratories Inc.) it was determined that RCA-1 lectin quantitatively removed ECD protein from cell culture medium (data not shown). Our purification protocol was based on this property and the presumed relatively acidic nature of the ECD. For a typical isolation, 15 liters of bioreactor perfusate containing 84 μg/ml protein were pumped over a 100-ml volume column of Fast Q-Sepharose anion exchanger. Step elution with 1 m NaCl, 0.1 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and localization of ECD-containing fractions by immunoblotting resulted in a pooled volume of 450 ml containing 0.56 mg/ml protein, which was run over a 25-ml bed volume column of RCA-1 lectin agarose affinity beads. Step elution with 0.2 m lactose in PBS gave 9.5 ml of solution containing 0.53 mg/ml protein. The affinity-purified lactose eluate from the lectin column was then subjected to FPLC Mono Q anion exchange chromatography (Fig.2). As seen by immunoblot (panel B) and Coomassie Blue staining (panel C) of representative fractions, a broad elution pattern of ECD protein begins at 0.22 m NaCl and ends at about 0.65 m NaCl, with a peak of ECD protein eluting in fraction 38 at a concentration of 0.32 m NaCl. This elution profile is suggestive of the existence of several tightly bound charged forms of the ECD protein that could reflect heterogeneity of carbohydrate content, specifically sialic acid (see below). Fractions 33–42 were pooled (16 ml of solution containing 0.153 mg/ml of protein) and then concentrated before HPLC TSK-3000 gel permeation chromatography (Fig.3). The ECD protein elutes as a single, well defined peak at fraction 17, which corresponds to the approximate elution volume seen for a bovine IgG immunoglobulin calibration standard with a molecular mass of 154 kDa (data not shown) and suggests that the ECD may be a dimer.Figure 3TSK-3000 HPLC gel permeation chromatography of pooled and concentrated Mono Q fractions 33–44. Panel Ashows the A 280 (measured in millivolts) elution profile for 200-μl injections of the ECD protein concentrate resolved in PBS at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. Panel B shows the immunoblot with ADD monoclonal antibody, whereas panel Cshows the pattern of Coomassie Blue staining. The lanes labeled “s” contain the molecular weight standards indicated on the left of panels B and C. The lanes are labeled with numbers corresponding to fractions of the chromatogram shown in panel A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 3, panel C) of SDS-reducing electrophoretic gels of the TSK-3000 chromatographic fractions revealed two bands of protein, a major diffuse band between the 64- and 98-kDa markers with an apparent molecular mass of ∼78 kDa and a minor band at ∼48 kDa. The more sensitive immunoblot (Fig. 3, panel B) also shows a major diffuse band at 78 kDa and a minor band at 48 kDa as well as two minor bands at 160–170 kDa, and a faint band at 52 kDa. Those extra bands, which are not seen by Coomassie Blue staining represent very minor amounts of protein. Based on immunoblots with region-specific antibodies (see below), we believe that the faster migrating bands at 48 and 52 kDa represent proteolytically clipped fragments of the ECD. The 160–170-kDa bands may represent trace amounts of undissociated dimeric ECD protein (see Fig.4). A typical purification yielded 1.33 mg of protein (representing 0.105% of the starting amount of bioreactor perfusate protein) at >95% purity based on visual inspection of Coomassie Blue-stained gels (Fig.3 C, lane 17). The pooled TSK-3000 fractions containing purified ECD were used for further biochemical characterization. ECD protein migrated in reducing electrophoresis gels with an apparent molecular mass of 78 kDa, which is much greater than the predicted molecular mass of 67,071 Da for the sequence of amino acids between residues 1–598. NH2-terminal amino acid sequencing of the purified protein gave the following sequence: YGPDQRAQKKGDIILGGLFP, corresponding to residues 20–39 of the hCaR (Fig. 1) and indicating that signal peptide cleavage occurs after alanine 19. This agrees well with an algorithm for predicting signal sequence cleavage sites (25von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3693) Google Scholar) that shows alanine very frequently in the −1 position and tyrosine, previously thought to be the site of cleavage in the bovine CaR (8Brown E.M.

The calculated molecular mass of the ECD protein minus the signal peptide residues and with the serine for cysteine substitution is 64,886 Da. The difference in apparent molecular weight on SDS-PAGEversus calculated molecular weight, the diffuse nature of the ECD band on SDS-PAGE, the presence of multiple presumptiveN-glycosylation sites in the ECD, and our ability to isolate the ECD by lectin affinity chromatography are all consistent with its being glycosylated. Table I shows the carbohydrate composition of several ECD preparations determined as described under “Materials and Methods.” Summation of the molecular weights of the determined species of carbohydrates indicates that a range of 8.2 to 37% of the mass of the ECD protein is carbohydrate. Addition of the carbohydrate masses to the mass of the predicted amino acid sequence results in a range of value from 70,692 to 103,291 Da. We are unable to explain the variability in carbohydrate content from one preparation to another. Although the same culture medium was used throughout, it is possible that subtle differences in culture conditions lead to substantial differences in glycosylation of the secreted ECD. It is of interest that sialic acid residues vary in their contribution of 1 to 25 negative charges per mole of protein to the net of 25 negative charges predicted by the protein sequence. This addition of more negative charges may explain the inability to determine the pI of the ECD protein by chromatofocusing (data not shown). Elution was not seen with poly buffer pH 4–7 adjusted to pH 4.0 using a mono P column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) indicating a pI below a value of 4.0Table IECD carbohydrate compositionSugar (mol of CHO/mol of protein)ECD PreparationECD2ECD7ECD8ECD9Fucose14285Glucosamine7595129Galactose4262215Mannose3952314Sialic acid25591Sum of CHO molecular mass (Da)38,4155,80623,19912,605Estimated molecular mass (Protein + CHO) (Da)103,29170,69288,08577,491Estimated CHO (%)378.226.316.3 Open table in a new tab HPLC gel permeation chromatography suggested that the ECD as isolated by our purification protocol is a dimer. The intact CaR expressed in transfected HEK-293 cells has been shown to be an intermolecular disulfide bond-linked dimer (14Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar, 15Fan G.F. Ray K. Zhao X.M. Goldsmith P.K. Spiegel A.M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 436: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). mGluR5 has been shown to be an intermolecular disulfide bond-linked dimer (12Romano C. Yang W.L. O'Malley K.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28612-28616Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), and for mGluR1, the secreted, purified ECD was also found to be an intermolecular disulfide bond-linked dimer (16Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). To test this possibility for the hCaR ECD, ECD protein was subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot after sample treatment at varying temperatures under reducing and nonreducing conditions. Irrespective of incubation temperature, under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4, lanes 2–5), the ECD protein migrates as a diffuse band of >200 kDa, whereas under reducing conditions (lanes 7–10), ECD protein migrates as a diffuse band of 78 kDa with another minor band of 48 kDa. The ECD protein is therefore isolated as an intermolecular disulfide-linked dimer capable of being totally reduced by β-mercaptoethanol. This is similar to the behavior of the purified mGluR1 ECD and is consistent with the possibility that dimerization of the intact CaR occurs secondary to intermolecular disulfide linkage of its ECD. The minor 48-kDa band, which we have interpreted as arising from action of unknown protease during the isolation procedure, is seen on immunoblot (Fig. 4) only under reducing conditions suggesting that it is kept associated to the rest of the ECD protein by disulfide bonds. Circular dichroism measurements of the purified ECD were performed and a typical CD spectrum is shown in Fig. 5. The CD spectrum of the purified ECD was unchanged by addition of EDTA, neomycin, gadolinium chloride, or terbium chloride at concentrations up to 100 μm. Analysis of all spectra indicated an α helix content of 41–56% and a β-sheet content of 7–19%. The purified ECD was subjected to tryptic proteolysis with and without prior denaturation. The denatured ECD was rapidly degraded by trypsin yielding small fragments visualized on immunoblot with the ADD antibody (Fig. 6, left). In contrast, the nondenatured ECD was not surprisingly less susceptible to tryptic digestion with persistence of intact ECD even after 40 min (Fig. 6, right). Of greater interest was the rapid appearance of an ∼50-kDa band with tryptic digestion of the nondenatured ECD. This tryptic fragment persisted even after 180 min of digestion, the longest time tested. The nondenatured ECD was then digested with trypsin for 30 or 90 min and the digests analyzed by immunoblot with a panel of polyclonal antibodies raised against synthetic peptides (see Fig. 1) ranging from the amino to the carboxyl terminus of the ECD (Fig.7). Although the pattern of smaller tryptic fragments varied with each antibody, the six antibodies going from NH2 terminus (GP) to residue 358 (FF20-7) showed the identical ∼50-kDa tryptic fragment after both 30 and 90 min of digestion. The LRG and DGE antibodies, in contrast, did not stain this band (labeled 1 in the figure); instead, LRG stained two diffuse, lower molecular weight bands (labeled 2 and 3 in the figure), whereas DGE stained only band 2. We interpret these results to indicate that the native ECD possesses relatively few sites accessible to trypsin, despite the many potential basic cleavage sites. The two major sites of cleavage are defined by the pattern of reactivity of the region-specific peptide antibodies. The site generating bands 1 and 2 is localized between the epitopes for FF20-07 and LRG. Band 1 is then an NH2-terminal fragment encompassing epitopes of GP through FF20-07, and band 2 is a COOH-terminal fragment encompassing the LRG and DGE epitopes. Band 3 is generated by tryptic cleavage at the other highly accessible site, which is just proximal to the DGE epitope based on the loss of DGE reactivity, retention of LRG reactivity, and modest reduction in size of band 3.Figure 7Immunoblot with a series of peptide-specific polyclonal antibodies of trypsin-digested, purified ECD. ECD protein was digested with trypsin for 30 or 90 min and then separated by SDS-PAGE for immunoblot analysis. At the top, the CaR ECD is schematized, and the relative positions of peptide epitopes (see also Fig. 1) of the polyclonal antibodies used for immunoblot analysis are shown as open rectangles. Molecular weight standards are indicated at the left of the immunoblots, which are labeled with antibody used and time of tryptic proteolysis. Three major products of tryptic proteolysis visualized on immunoblot are labeled (1, 2, 3) at right (variations in intensity of staining of band 1 reflect differing affinities of the respective antibodies).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) It is interesting to relate these tryptic cleavage sites to a speculative model of the CaR ECD. A sequence alignment based on limited homology between bacterial periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) and mGluR ECDs (9O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar) can be extended to the CaR given its relatively high degree of homology to the mGluRs (8Brown E.M. Gamba G.

The model predicts that like PBP, the mGluR and CaR ECDs are venus flytrap-like structures with two lobes each consisting of α-helix and β-sheet folds connected by a hinge region of three strands (9O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). In this model, regions of mGluR or CaR ECD that align with PBP are assigned secondary structure based on the x-ray crystallography-determined structure of PBP, whereas insertions in the mGluR or CaR ECD that do not align with PBP are left as loops of undefined secondary structure. All four such insertions in the CaR ECD model cluster in one of the two putative flytrap lobes. The tryptic cleavage site generating bands 1 and 2 is localized to one of these four insertions, consistent with the possibility that this in fact represents a surface-exposed loop of the protein. The site that generates band 3 is localized to a presumptive “stalk” that would tether the flytrap to the first transmembrane domain in the intact receptor. We speculate that this stalk is left freely accessible to tryptic cleavage in the secreted ECD. For the mGluR1 ECD, the availability of high affinity agonists and antagonists permitted the demonstration that the ECD alone is capable of high affinity ligand binding (16Okamoto T. Sekiyama N. Otsu M. Shimada Y. Sato A. Nakanishi S. Jingami H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 13089-13096Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). As yet, it has not been possible to measure directly Ca2+ binding to either the intact CaR or its ECD. One report showed that Ca2+ induces dimer formation of CaR solubilized from purified renal endosomes (13Ward D.T. Brown E.M. Harris H.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14476-14483Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), but another report failed to see Ca2+-induced dimer formation in CaR expressed in transfected HEK-293 cells (14Bai M. Trivedi S. Brown E.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23605-23610Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Consistent with the latter report, we failed to see evidence of divalent cation-induced dimerization of the purified hCaR ECD (data not shown). As another indirect measure of Ca2+ binding to the hCaR ECD, we tested the effect of Ca2+ on the rate of tryptic digestion of the ECD. Although there was a suggestion that Ca2+ slowed the rate of digestion (data not shown), effects observed were small and not consistently observed. Failure to detect changes in CD spectrum with addition of cation agonists such as neomycin and gadolinium chloride does not exclude binding of such agonists to the ECD. In fact, the venus flytrap model predicts no change in secondary structure and therefore CD spectrum with ligand binding, but rather a rotation of ∼45o of one lobe relative to the other (9O'Hara P.J. Sheppard P.O. Thogersen H. Venezia D. Haldeman B.A. McGrane V. Houamed K.M. Thomsen C. Gilbert T.L. Mulvihill E.R. Neuron. 1993; 11: 41-52Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar). Although it has been speculated that the ECD is the site of Ca2+binding in the CaR (8Brown E.M. Gamba G. Riccardi D. Lombardi M. Butters R. Kifor O. Sun A. Hediger M.A. Lytton J. Hebert S.C. Nature. 1993; 366: 575-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar), at this point we are unable to demonstrate this with the purified ECD. In summary, we have shown that the hCaR ECD can be purified in milligram amounts, defined the site of signal peptide cleavage, and shown that it is a glycosylated, disulfide-linked dimer with a folded structure that contains only two highly accessible tryptic cleavage sites. Availability of the purified ECD should permit further studies to define the actual sites of glycosylation, to identify intermolecular disulfides involved in dimer formation, and intramolecular disulfides critical for tertiary structure, and ultimately, the three dimensional structure. This information will be critical to understanding how Ca2+ leads to receptor activation.

Euryhaline fishes such as eel, salmon, tilapia, and flounder can live both in freshwater and in seawater. To tolerate a wide range of salinities and move between freshwater and seawater, they developed special structures and mechanisms for osmoregulation, one of which is the chloride cells in the gill. The chloride cells or the ionocytes are rich in mitochondria and actively absorb salt in freshwater and pump out excess salt in seawater to help maintain body fluid homeostasis. Understanding the molecular basis of these extraordinary abilities of euryhaline species has long been a major goal in animal physiology. Previous studies were mainly focused on the morphological, electrophysiological, and hormonal aspects. Although such conventional approaches have revealed a number of interesting facts concerning the osmoregulatory processes, detailed mechanisms and the molecules involved remain to be clarified. We employed, in the present study, the recently developed RNA arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (RAP-PCR) 1The abbreviations used are: RAP-PCR, RNA arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction; eKir, eel inward rectifier K+ channel; Kv, voltage-gated K+ channel; Kir, inward rectifier K+ channel; MBP, maltose-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: RAP-PCR, RNA arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction; eKir, eel inward rectifier K+ channel; Kv, voltage-gated K+ channel; Kir, inward rectifier K+ channel; MBP, maltose-binding protein; bp, base pair(s); Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; Mops, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. to identify the mRNA species whose expressions are regulated by the environmental salinities.

Our attempt using mRNA preparations from freshwater and seawater eels resulted in identification of several mRNA species that exhibit markedly altered expression. One of them was, as detailed below, a K+ channel that belongs to the inward rectifier K+ channel family and shows a unique tissue distribution as being confined to osmoregulatory organs such as the gill, kidney, and intestine.K+ channels are a diverse group of membrane proteins. Recent molecular cloning has established the presence of two structurally and functionally distinct families of the channel as follows: 1) the voltage-gated K+ channels (Kv) that have six transmembrane spans within each subunit and are activated by depolarization in a steeply voltage-dependent manner, and 2) the inward rectifier K+ channels (Kir) that have only two transmembrane segments and conduct inward current more readily than outward current. Although the members of these K+ channel families are different in their subunit structures, electrophysiological properties, and mechanisms of activation, they are considered to be assembled with multiple (probably four) homologous or heterologous subunits to make up the K+-selective pore (3MacKinnon R.

The presence of this H5 sequence is therefore considered the signature of a K+ channel protein.Although the function of the voltage-gated K+ channels is relatively simple and well established as being responsible for action potential repolarization and frequency encoding, the function of the inward rectifier K+ channels is quite diverse. The inward rectifier K+ channels are found in a wide variety of tissues and cell types where they are involved not only in the maintenance of the resting membrane potential and control of cell excitability but also in processes not usually associated with electrically excitable membranes such as hormone secretion, K+ excretion, and buffering extracellular K+concentrations or recycling K+. Several inward rectifier K+ channels have recently been cloned from a number of tissues and species by expression cloning (7Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V.

Their sequencing and characterization have demonstrated structural and functional diversities of the channel proteins, and currently the molecular determinants of rectification are being identified. The next step will be to clarify the physiological significance of the channel subtypes. Here we report cloning of a unique member of the Kir family whose expression is strongly induced in eels, especially in the chloride cells of the gill, during adaptation to seawater and therefore considered to play an essential role in osmoregulation.DISCUSSIONIdentification of the genes that are specifically expressed in seawater eels but not in freshwater eels, or vice versa, is important for understanding the molecular basis of the osmoregulation of euryhaline fishes. In the present study, we applied the RAP-PCR technique to compare mRNA species from freshwater and seawater eel gills, and we identified several differentially expressed cDNA bands, one of which was fully characterized and shown to be an inward rectifier K+ channel (eKir) highly expressed in the osmoregulatory chloride cells in the gill. The amino acid sequence of the channel protein is quite different from those of the currently known Kir family members; the sequence identity is less than 51% when compared with any of the members. Phylogenetic analysis suggested early divergence of the eKir channel from the other members (Fig. 4). The sequence divergence appears not to be due to the species difference since other members of the eel, salmon, and chick Kir families (eel Kir1.3, eel Kir2.1, eel Kir3.4, eel and salmon WIRK (16Kubo Y. Miyashita T. Kubokawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15729-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and chick cIRK1 (10Navaratnam D.S. Escobar L. Covarrubias M. Oberholtzer J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19238-19245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) share more than 70% sequence identity with the corresponding mammalian homologs (Fig. 4). Based on these facts, therefore, we proposed that eKir is a new member of the subfamily Kir5.0. This conclusion is supported by its unique tissue distribution and inducibility; the eKir channel is confined to the gill, kidney, and posterior intestine, and its message levels are increased dramatically in response to osmotic challenge. Such distributions and inductions are not displayed by its predecessors.The three locations of eKir (the gill, kidney, and intestine) are the major organs involved in osmoregulation. These locations, particularly the microtubular localization of eKir in the chloride cell (Fig. 10), may provide an important clue regarding its physiological roles. Since chloride cells are rich in Na+,K+-ATPase reflecting their extraordinary power of ion transport, eKir cloned here may be an osmoregulatory component working cooperatively with Na+,K+-ATPase, for example, by recycling K+. The localization in the posterior intestine but not in the anterior intestine is also particularly interesting since, to date, no significant difference in osmoregulatory roles has been found between the anterior and posterior parts of the intestine (31Loretz C.A. Wood C.M. Shuttleworth T.J. Cellular and Molecular Approaches to Fish Ionic Regulation. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 25-56Google Scholar) that are divided by the presence of a constriction due to a sphincter muscle. Our finding is therefore expected to provide new avenues for further research on the intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport.Osmoregulatory mechanisms of euryhaline fishes are known to be under endocrine control; for example, prolactin is the predominant osmoregulatory hormone in freshwater adaptation, and cortisol serves this function in seawater adaptation. In euryhaline fishes, these hormones seem to play a preparatory role and trigger the operation of the osmoregulatory system to the appropriate direction since their surge in serum levels precedes freshwater or seawater entry (32Evans D.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inward rectifier potassium channel eKir appears to be downstream of these hormonal factors and plays an essential role for the subsequent survival in seawater as suggested by its time course of induction (Fig. 8). Our identification of an inducible channel protein, eKir, on which euryhaline fishes are supposed to depend in the seawater milieu may serve as a molecular clue for clarifying the molecular basis for seawater adaptation. Future studies should reveal how hypertonicity is recognized and how the recognition is converted to the activation of the eKir gene as well as the physiological function of the channel in association with other channels and transporters. Euryhaline fishes such as eel, salmon, tilapia, and flounder can live both in freshwater and in seawater. To tolerate a wide range of salinities and move between freshwater and seawater, they developed special structures and mechanisms for osmoregulation, one of which is the chloride cells in the gill.

Although the function of the voltage-gated K+ channels is relatively simple and well established as being responsible for action potential repolarization and frequency encoding, the function of the inward rectifier K+ channels is quite diverse. The inward rectifier K+ channels are found in a wide variety of tissues and cell types where they are involved not only in the maintenance of the resting membrane potential and control of cell excitability but also in processes not usually associated with electrically excitable membranes such as hormone secretion, K+ excretion, and buffering extracellular K+concentrations or recycling K+. Several inward rectifier K+ channels have recently been cloned from a number of tissues and species by expression cloning (7Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M. Kanazirska M.V.

Their sequencing and characterization have demonstrated structural and functional diversities of the channel proteins, and currently the molecular determinants of rectification are being identified. The next step will be to clarify the physiological significance of the channel subtypes. Here we report cloning of a unique member of the Kir family whose expression is strongly induced in eels, especially in the chloride cells of the gill, during adaptation to seawater and therefore considered to play an essential role in osmoregulation. DISCUSSIONIdentification of the genes that are specifically expressed in seawater eels but not in freshwater eels, or vice versa, is important for understanding the molecular basis of the osmoregulation of euryhaline fishes. In the present study, we applied the RAP-PCR technique to compare mRNA species from freshwater and seawater eel gills, and we identified several differentially expressed cDNA bands, one of which was fully characterized and shown to be an inward rectifier K+ channel (eKir) highly expressed in the osmoregulatory chloride cells in the gill. The amino acid sequence of the channel protein is quite different from those of the currently known Kir family members; the sequence identity is less than 51% when compared with any of the members. Phylogenetic analysis suggested early divergence of the eKir channel from the other members (Fig. 4). The sequence divergence appears not to be due to the species difference since other members of the eel, salmon, and chick Kir families (eel Kir1.3, eel Kir2.1, eel Kir3.4, eel and salmon WIRK (16Kubo Y. Miyashita T. Kubokawa K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15729-15735Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), and chick cIRK1 (10Navaratnam D.S. Escobar L. Covarrubias M. Oberholtzer J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19238-19245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar)) share more than 70% sequence identity with the corresponding mammalian homologs (Fig. 4). Based on these facts, therefore, we proposed that eKir is a new member of the subfamily Kir5.0. This conclusion is supported by its unique tissue distribution and inducibility; the eKir channel is confined to the gill, kidney, and posterior intestine, and its message levels are increased dramatically in response to osmotic challenge. Such distributions and inductions are not displayed by its predecessors.The three locations of eKir (the gill, kidney, and intestine) are the major organs involved in osmoregulation. These locations, particularly the microtubular localization of eKir in the chloride cell (Fig. 10), may provide an important clue regarding its physiological roles. Since chloride cells are rich in Na+,K+-ATPase reflecting their extraordinary power of ion transport, eKir cloned here may be an osmoregulatory component working cooperatively with Na+,K+-ATPase, for example, by recycling K+. The localization in the posterior intestine but not in the anterior intestine is also particularly interesting since, to date, no significant difference in osmoregulatory roles has been found between the anterior and posterior parts of the intestine (31Loretz C.A. Wood C.M. Shuttleworth T.J. Cellular and Molecular Approaches to Fish Ionic Regulation. Academic Press, San Diego1995: 25-56Google Scholar) that are divided by the presence of a constriction due to a sphincter muscle. Our finding is therefore expected to provide new avenues for further research on the intestinal fluid and electrolyte transport.Osmoregulatory mechanisms of euryhaline fishes are known to be under endocrine control; for example, prolactin is the predominant osmoregulatory hormone in freshwater adaptation, and cortisol serves this function in seawater adaptation. In euryhaline fishes, these hormones seem to play a preparatory role and trigger the operation of the osmoregulatory system to the appropriate direction since their surge in serum levels precedes freshwater or seawater entry (32Evans D.H. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1990; 52: 43-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In contrast, the inward rectifier potassium channel eKir appears to be downstream of these hormonal factors and plays an essential role for the subsequent survival in seawater as suggested by its time course of induction (Fig. 8). Our identification of an inducible channel protein, eKir, on which euryhaline fishes are supposed to depend in the seawater milieu may serve as a molecular clue for clarifying the molecular basis for seawater adaptation. Future studies should reveal how hypertonicity is recognized and how the recognition is converted to the activation of the eKir gene as well as the physiological function of the channel in association with other channels and transporters.

Time course experiments show that RT pauses after addition of the 12th DNA residue, and at this stage the RNase H activity starts to cleave the RNA primer from newly synthesized DNA. Comparison of cleavage profiles obtained with 3′- and 5′-end-labeled primer strands indicates that RT now translocates in the opposite direction, i.e. in the 5′ direction of the RNA strand. DNA synthesis resumes again in the 3′ direction, after the RNA-DNA junction was efficiently cleaved. Moreover, we further characterized complexes generated before, during, and after position +12, by treating these with Fe2+ to localize the RNase H active site on the DNA template. Initially, when RT binds the RNA/DNA substrate, oxidative strand breaks were seen at a distance of 18 base pairs upstream from the primer terminus, whereas 17 base pairs were observed at later stages when the enzyme binds more and more DNA/DNA. These data show that the initiation of (+)-strand synthesis is accompanied by a conformational change of the polymerase-competent complex.

Retroviral RTs 1The abbreviations used are: RT, reverse transcriptase; HIV-1, human immunodeficiency virus type 1; PBS, primer-binding site; PPT, polypurine tract; nt, nucleotides; bp, base pairs; dNTP, 3′-deoxynucleosidetriphosphate; ddNTP, 2′,3′-dideoxynucleosidetriphosphate; ds, double-stranded. are multifunctional enzymes possessing RNA- and DNA-dependent polymerase activities and a ribonuclease H (RNase H) activity that degrades the RNA strand of RNA/DNA hybrids (1Telesnitsky A.

Cell. 1979; 18: 93-100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). Like other retroviruses, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) uses a cellular tRNA primer to initiate reverse transcription from a complementary primer-binding site (PBS) near the 5′-end of the viral RNA (3Marquet R.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7178-7187Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), i.e.(−)-strand DNA, complexes with the initially bound RNA/RNA duplex and the newly synthesized DNA/RNA substrates share certain common features. RNase H cleavages on the RNA strand of DNA/RNA primer/template combinations occur at a constant distance of 18 bp upstream of the nascent primer terminus (8Wöhrl B.M. Moelling K. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10141-10147Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 9Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10763-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Analogously, RNase H-induced cleavages within the tRNA/RNA duplex, designated as RNase H* activity (10Hostomsky Z. Hughes S.H. Goff S.P. Le Grice S.F.J. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 1970-1971Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were observed at the same distance from the 3′-end of the primer, although these cuts are restricted to stalled complexes (11Götte M.

Together, these data provide strong evidence that RT binds to both RNA/RNA and DNA/RNA substrates with the same orientation, and the number of bp between the two active sites is 18 in each case. RT-DNA/DNA complexes, which are generated during (+)-strand synthesis, have been relatively well characterized (12Jacobo-Molina A. Ding J. Nanni R.G. Clark Jr., A.D. Lu X. Tantillo C. Williams R.L.

The crystal structure of HIV-1 RT complexed to an 18-base primer/19-base template DNA homoduplex (21Schatz O. Mous J. Le Grice S.F.J. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1171-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) suggests that the first 7 DNA/DNA base pairs near the polymerase active site adopt an A-type conformation, whereas the region further upstream is in the preferred B-conformation, both structurally distinct segments being separated by a kink. Little information is currently available regarding the interaction between RT and the RNA/DNA primer/template combination that is initially bound during (+)-strand synthesis. A short segment near the 3′-end of viral genomic RNA, termed the polypurine tract (PPT), is resistant to RNase H degradation and, unlike the rest of the genomic RNA, remains intact during synthesis of the (−)-strand DNA. The PPT fragment then serves as a primer for (+)-strand polymerization, whereas the (−)-strand DNA is used as a template to guide synthesis. Later after initiation, the RNA primer is removed by RNase H cuts at the DNA-RNA junction and adjacent positions (16Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10565-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fuentes G.M. Rodrı́guez-Rodrı́guez L. Fay P.J. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28169-28176Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Here, we demonstrate that the RNA primer is cleaved precisely after the 12th DNA residue has been incorporated. This is an unexpected result, since the relative positions of the polymerase and RNase H active sites would not allow DNA synthesis and RNase H degradation to occur at the same time on the same strand. In contrast, the spatial relationship between both active sites facilitates temporally coordinated activities on opposite strands, in a distance of about 18 base pairs, when RT is complexed with DNA/RNA primer/templates (9Gopalakrishnan V. Peliska J.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10763-10767Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We now show that RT pauses after addition of the 12th DNA residue during the initiation of (+)-strand synthesis. At this point, another RT molecule (not the one that accomplishes DNA synthesis) binds the substrate in an RNase H-competent binding mode to cleave the RNA primer. The directionality of the latter reaction, i.e. in 5′ direction with respect to the RNA strand, distinguishes this binding mode from the polymerase-competent complex. In the polymerase-competent mode, RT binds its RNA/DNA substrate in the same orientation as that described for DNA/DNA, RNA/RNA, and DNA/RNA primer/templates. This has been shown by treating stalled complexes with Fe2+, which allowed us to localize the RNase H active site on the DNA template (15Götte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Together, our data provide a detailed model for the early steps of (+)-strand DNA synthesis. Oligonucleotides used in this study were derived from the polypurine tract located near the 3′-end of the HIV-1 genome (HXB-2 isolate). DNA oligonucleotides as well as RNA and chimeric DNA-RNA primers were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392/8 synthesizer using the standard phosphoramidite method, followed by purification on 12% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gels containing 50 mm Tris borate, pH 8.0, 1 mmEDTA. 5′-End labeling of oligonucleotides (DNA, RNA, or chimera) was conducted with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase; and 3′-end labeling of the DNA template was performed with [α-32P]ddATP using terminal transferase (Boehringer Mannheim) according to the manufacturer's recommendation. The chimeric 3′-end-labeled primer (3D-17R) was generated by extending the pure RNA PPT-primer (17R) with HIV-1 RT in the presence of dATP, dCTP, and [α-32P]dTTP using reaction conditions as described below. All end-labeled nucleic acids were again electrophoretically purified to obtain homogeneous products. Heterodimeric HIV-1 RT (p66/p51) and the RNase H-deficient p66(E478Q)/p51 mutant enzyme were prepared and purified essentially as described (37Le Grice S.F.J. Grüninger-Leitch F. Eur. J. Biochem. 1990; 178: 307-314Crossref Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Primer/template sequences were prehybridized prior to incubation with RT. A mixture containing the template strand (120 nm) and 32P-labeled primer (100 nm) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mm NaCl was heated to 95 °C for 2 min followed by incubation at 72 °C for 10 min and cooled for 20 min to room temperature. Complete hybridization was confirmed on native polyacrylamide gels. The pre-annealed primer/template substrate (100 nm) was incubated with HIV-1 RT (150 nm) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 50 mmNaCl. Appropriate dNTP/ddNTP combinations (100 and 200 μm, respectively), which permitted control of the extent of DNA synthesis, were included in the preincubation mixture to form ternary RT-primer/template-dNTP complexes. 20-μl reactions were initiated with MgCl2 at a final concentration of 6 mm and allowed to proceed for 15 min at 37 °C. Nucleic acids were subsequently precipitated with ethanol, and reaction products were finally analyzed on 15% polyacrylamide, 7 murea gels, followed by exposure overnight. A list of different primers and the template used to generate registers 3, 4, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 are as follows: DNA template 57D, 5′-CGTTGGGAGTGAATTAGCCCTTCCAGTCCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGA-3′; the chimeric primer 3D-17R and the homologous DNA primer 20D, 5′-UUAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACT-3′ (RNA residues are written in italics) and 5′-TTAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACT-3′. Both primers were employed to generate registers 3, 4, 6, 11, and 12 as shown in Fig. 1. The chimeric RNA-DNA oligonucleotides 12D-17R, 5′-UUAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACTGGAAGGGCT-3′, 14D-17R, 5′-UUAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACTGGAAGGGCTAA-3′, and 16D-17R, 5′-UUAAAAGAAAAGGGGGGACTGGAAGGGCTAATT-3′, were used to generate registers 12–16. Register 12 was obtained by annealing the 12D-17R primer to the DNA template and incubating the preformed substrate with RT and ddATP (500 μm) as described above. In the latter case, Mg2+ was omitted from the reaction mixture to prevent incorporation of the chain-terminating stop-nucleotide as well as RNase H degradation of the chimeric primer. Register 13 was then generated by addition of Mg2+ (6 mm) to allow incorporation of ddATP. The presence of Mg2+ also resulted in RNase H cleavages at the RNA-DNA junction. Registers 14 and 15 were generated with primer 14D-17R and ddTTP, and registers 16 and 17 were generated with primer 16D-17R and ddCTP using the same procedure. Time course experiments were similarly performed. In these experiments, we lowered the ratio of RT-primer/template to monitor appearance of all reaction products during a time course of 60 min. The pre-annealed primer/template substrate (100 nm) was preincubated for 5 min at 37 °C with HIV-RT (50 nm) in a buffer containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, and 50 mm NaCl. Polymerization and RNase H degradation was then initiated simultaneously by addition of MgCl2 at a final concentration of 6 mm. Reactions were performed at 37 °C and stopped at different time points by adding 1-μl aliquots of the reaction mixture to 9 μl of 95% formamide containing 40 mm EDTA. Most of the time course experiments were performed with the DNA template 57D and the chimeric 3D-17R primer. We also used the pure RNA primer 17R, 5′-UUAAAAGAAAAGGGGGG-3′, the chimeric 12D-17R primer and its isolated DNA segment 12D, 5′-ACTGGAAGGGCT-3′, for comparative purpose (see Fig. 5). Additionally, to analyze whether the reaction profile depends on the template sequence, we employed another DNA template with a randomly chosen sequence upstream from the PPT binding site: 5′-CAGTGATCTCGAGCTACATGATCGTCACCCCCCTTTTCTTTTAAAAAGTGGCTAAGA-3′. Stalled RT-nucleic acid complexes that contained differentially extended primer strands were prepared as described above. RT was used in a final concentration of 150 nm, and the ratio of primer/template (radiolabeled at the 3′-end or 5′-end) was 120/100 nm. Preformed complexes in a volume of 16 μl were incubated with a mixture of 2 μl of Fe(NH4)2SO4·6H2O (400 μl) and 2 μl of dithiothreitol (50 mm). Reactions were allowed to proceed for 5 min at 37 °C and were stopped with 40 μl of a solution containing 0.1 m thiourea, 200 ng of tRNA, 10 mm EDTA, and 0.6 m sodium acetate. Samples were subsequently precipitated with ethanol and loaded on a 12% polyacrylamide-urea gel. The size of the Fe2+-dependent cleavage fragments were assigned by a T-ladder generated after modifying the DNA with OsO4/bipyridin followed by cleaving the sugar-phosphate backbone with piperidine. Reactions with ONOOK were performed as described previously (15Götte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol.

Briefly, RT-primer/template complexes were prepared in a buffer containing 80 mm sodium cacodylate, pH 7, and 20 mm NaCl. Cleavage reactions were conducted by adding 1 μl of a stable alkaline ONOOK solution (pH 12, 90 mm) to the sample solution buffered at pH 7. Reaction products were analyzed as described above. In order to analyze the interplay between RT polymerase and RNase H active sites on a PPT-derived RNA/DNA primer/template substrate, we first generated a series of stalled complexes, termed registers, through use of various dNTP/ddNTP combinations. Instead of employing a pure RNA primer that, because of the sequence 5′-CAGT-3′ immediately flanking the primer, leads to termination of DNA synthesis at positions +1, +2, +3, and +4, we devised a chimeric DNA-RNA primer (Pr + PPT 3D-17R) that yields chain termination at positions +4, +6, +11, and +12 (Fig. 1). This approach allowed us to study early events of the initiation reaction when RT is complexed with its initially bound RNA/DNA substrate as well as with chimeric replication intermediates. We also devised a DNA primer (Pr + PPT 20D) to generate a homologous DNA/DNA substrate for comparative purposes. The polymerization and RNase H cleavage products of differentially arrested RT-nucleic acid complexes are shown in Fig.2. As expected, the 5′-end-labeled DNA primer was precisely elongated by 1, 3, 8, and 9 nt (left panel, lanes 4, 6, 11, and 12). The presence of all four dNTPs yielded a product of 44 nt in length (lane 27). The results obtained with the homologous RNA/DNA substrate are more complex (Fig.2, right panel), since the RT polymerase and RNase H activities both use the same strand as substrate. Consistent with previous reports (16Huber H.E. Richardson C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 10565-10573Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Fuentes G.M. Rodrı́guez-Rodrı́guez L. Fay P.J.

Virol. 1996; 70: 5288-5296Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), RNase H cuts are seen at the DNA-RNA interface and further upstream, adjacent to the junction, at four consecutive positions, and between positions −7 and −8. Precise extension with reasonable yield was observed only in register 4 when a single nt was added to the chimeric primer (Fig. 2, right panel, lane 4). This product was termed 4D-17R, with respect to the number of DNA and RNA residues of the extended primer. The expected reaction product in register 6, i.e. 6D-17R, is visible, but another shorter product, termed 1D-17R (see below), is also seen just above the RNase H cuts. Similar observations were made in registers 11 and 12 (lanes 11 and 12). In either case, the expected reaction products were less pronounced than the shorter ones, i.e. 2D-17R and 3D-17R. To characterize further the origin of the shorter reaction products, we next followed their formation in time course experiments. These were performed with dNTP/ddNTP combinations to yield registers 6 and 11 (Fig.3 A). The 6D-17R product appeared within the first few minutes and increased only slightly with longer reaction times (Fig. 3 A, left panel). RNase H cuts at the junction (17R) and further upstream (16R and 15R) were seen clearly after 3 min, and the above-mentioned 1D-17R product, which migrated a little slower than the 17R cleavage band, first appeared between 12 and 20 min and further increased over longer incubation times. This result shows an order of product formation, i.e. first elongation to yield the 6D-17R product followed by RNase H cleavages and finally the formation of the 1D-17R product. RT thus initiates a second round of (+)-strand synthesis using the cleaved RNA fragment as a primer. We will now use the term “primary reaction” and “secondary reaction” to distinguish between these two types of initiation events (schematically illustrated in Fig. 3 C). During the primary reaction, incorporation of ddATP results in chain termination at position +6, whereas, during the secondary initiation reaction, ddATP is added at position +1 to yield a complex, termed register 1′. Equivalent patterns were seen in registers 11 and 12 (Fig. 3 A, right, and B, left); here, the stop-nucleotides (ddCTP and ddTTP) were added at positions +2 and +3 to yield the secondary 2D-17R and 3D-17R products. The presence of dGTP should, in principal, allow elongation of RNA fragments that are generated by RNase H cleavages at the DNA-RNA junction and adjacent positions. Thus, the shorter secondary products may represent a heterogeneous mixture of chimeric strands, each of which contains a different number of DNA residues at the 3′-end. It can hardly be deduced from the above experiment which of the RNA fragments is preferentially used during the secondary initiation reaction. However, the observation that the 3D-17R product co-migrates exactly with the unextended primer indicates that the 17R cleavage product is most efficiently used (Fig. 3 B, left panel). If shorter cleavage products would have been extended, the 3D-17R fragment would have migrated somewhat faster, due to the increased number of DNA residues in the chain-terminated product (see Fig. 2; the pure DNA oligonucleotide migrates faster than the chimeric DNA-RNA strand of the same length). The above results showed that the initiation of (+)-strand synthesis is a complex process that involves primary and secondary initiation reactions, superimposed on the primer removal reaction. In order to understand better the natural reaction pathways, we next analyzed the order of product formation in the presence of all four dNTPs. The time course (Fig. 3 B, right panel) shows that RT pauses at position +12, before DNA synthesis resumes to yield the run-off product (27D-17R). All reaction products, including the cleavage products (17R, 16R, and 15R), are already seen after the 1st min. The primer removal reaction appears to be equally efficient in the presence or absence of chain terminating nucleotides, as the enzyme encounters the template around position +12. For example compare Fig. 3 A register 11, Fig.3 B register 12, and run-off synthesis. Thus, these data do not provide any information regarding the temporal relationship between the polymerase and RNase H active sites. The primer may be randomly cleaved at any point after initiation, immediately after synthesis of the run-off product, or alternatively the primer may already be removed once the 12th nt has been added. The above data do not enable us to distinguish among these various scenarios, since cleaved 5′-end-labeled RNA fragments migrate at the same position in each case. We therefore followed formation and processing of the initially synthesized product, using a 3′-end-labeled primer (Fig.4). Putative secondary reactions are not detectable in this experiment, since the radiolabel is attached to the third DNA residue. The accumulation of the 12D-17R product, the pausing site, was again seen at early stages after initiation, i.e.1 and 3 min. A relatively small fraction of this product is further extended to yield the unprocessed run-off product, which is later cleaved, as shown by the time-dependent decrease of this band. However, it seems that most of the 12D-17R reaction intermediate is prematurely cleaved to yield the 12D product. The 12D product then accumulates between 3 and 20 min and is later extended to yield the processed run-off product. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the primer is not randomly cleaved at any stage after initiation. The appearance of the single 12D product shows that the RNA primer is efficiently and precisely cleaved at the RNA-DNA junction after the 12th DNA residue has been incorporated. Whether secondary initiation reactions also occur in the absence of chain-terminating stop-nucleotides cannot be answered on the basis of the above time course experiments. Synthesis of a secondary (+)-strand may be initiated after pausing and the following primer removal. Our data point to the existence of three different primer 3′-ends at position +12 that can potentially be recognized by the polymerase active site, i.e. the DNA 3′-end of the elongated unprocessed primer (12D-17R), the DNA 3′-end of the elongated processed primer (12D), and the RNA 3′-end of the processed primer (17R). To determine which of these three 3′-ends might preferentially be used for DNA synthesis, we used a stoichiometric mixture of primer/template combinations with an uncleaved chimeric primer containing 17 RNA and 12 DNA residues and a nicked substrate with a 17-mer RNA primer and a 12-mer DNA primer. The former represents the substrate prior to primer removal, whereas the latter mimics the substrate after the RNase H cut at the RNA-DNA junction. The efficiency of DNA synthesis from each of the three available 3′-ends was compared in a competition experiment, using three separate reaction mixtures with 5′-end-labeled primers and an RNase H-deficient RT (Fig.5 A). The data show the following order of efficiency: 12D > 12D17R ≫ 17R. After a 60-min reaction, 55% of the 12D primer and 45% of the chimeric 12D-17R primer were extended to yield the final run-off product. In contrast, only 25% of the 17R was found to be extended, and most of the extended fraction accumulated after incorporation of the first nucleotide. These data show that secondary initiation reactions are clearly suppressed in the absence of a chain-terminated primary product and that RT preferentially elongates the 3′-end of the newly synthesized and processed DNA fragment. The additional pausing site at position +1 does not necessarily correlate with putative difficulties of RT to strand-displace the annealed 12D fragment, since accumulation of this product is also seen in the absence of the 12D strand. Fig.5 B shows that initiation with the pure 17R primer resulted in dual pausing at position +1 and, in agreement with the data obtained with the 3D-17R primer, also at position +12. Moreover, synthesis of full-length (+)-strand DNA is still very efficient in this circumstance, indicating that the primer removal reaction is not required for polymerization steps after RT has reached position +12. We next analyzed the possible structural requirements for the specific pausing site at position +12. Pausing may be caused by the particular sequence or secondary structures of the single-stranded DNA template that inhibit the translocation of the enzyme. However, the specific pausing site after addition of the 12th nt is not observed with an homologous DNA/DNA substrate (Fig. 6), which indicates that pausing rather depends on the structure of the complexed chimeric substrate and its interaction with RT. This conclusion is additionally supported by the observation that different template sequences, shown under experimental procedures, do not alter the pausing profile as long as DNA synthesis was initiated with the RNA primer (data not shown). To further approach this problem, we wished to define structural characteristics of complexes generated before, during, and after position +12. Studying RT-DNA/DNA complexes, we have recently shown that the interaction between the DNA template and the RT-associated RNase H can be monitored in the presence of Fe2+ and that Fe2+ binds to one of the metal-binding sites of the RNase H domain, thereby generating a high local concentration of hydroxyl radicals that might serve as active species to cause an oxidative strand break (15Götte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we have used this tool to determine the number of base pairs between both active sites depending on the bound substrate,i.e. RNA/DNA or DNA/DNA. Although the purine-rich sequence of the dsDNA substrate used in this study differs markedly from the PBS-derived sequence used previously (15Götte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), the number of bp between the RT active sites was identical, i.e. 17 in each case (Fig.7 A, lane 1). In contrast, when RT was complexed with the homologous RNA/DNA substrate, a specific cut was seen on the DNA template at a distance of 18 bp upstream of the primer terminus (lane 2). Lower concentrations of cleaved products were seen when RT was bound to the RNA/DNA substrate, suggesting a diminished efficiency of cleavage, but the cleavage profile was exactly the same. However, the major product is shifted exactly by a single nucleotide when RNA/DNA is bound to RT. The small percentage of side products, i.e. less than 10%, can be explained by the oxidative cleavage mechanism that involves diffusible hydroxyl radicals as active species (15Götte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). To provide additional information in regard to differences between RT-DNA/DNA and RT-RNA/DNA complexes, we also wished to study the protein-nucleic acid interface using hydroxyl radicals generated via Fe[EDTA]2− as well as via ONOOK, as described previously (15Götte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar, 19Götte M. Marquet R. Isel C. Anderson V.E. Keith G. Gross H.J. Ehresmann C. Ehresmann B. Heumann H. FEBS Lett. 1996; 390: 226-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). However, a clear footprint could not be obtained, presumably reflecting the ability of RT to bind these substrates in both a polymerase-competent mode as well as one that facilitates removal of the primer (see “Discussion”). Despite the lack of a clear footprint, a faint band located on the DNA template strand, 7 bp upstream of the primer 3′-end, was seen when both complexes were treated with ONOOK (Fig. 7 A, lanes 3 and 4). This cut was also seen as part of the ONOOK-dependent footprint on the DNA/DNA substrate derived from the PBS sequence (15Götte M. Maier G. Gross H.J. Heumann H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10139-10146Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). This particular reaction is thus a feature of polymerase-competent complexes and can be used as a second marker, in addition to the Fe2+cut, to determine differences in the number of base pairs that fit in the substrate-binding channel. It is interesting to note that the ONOOK cut appeared at the same position, regardless whether DNA/DN"

The selectin adhesion molecules, in particular P- and E-selectin, have been shown to mediate cellular interactions in the required rolling phase, which precedes the adherence and extravasation of leukocytes from the vasculature at sites of inflammation. The selectins, and in particular P-selectin, also mediate the adherence of platelets to lymphocytes (12Diacovo T.G. Puri K.D. Warnock R.A. Springer T.A. von Andrian U.H. Science. 1996; 273: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar) as well as the adherence of platelets to neutrophils. The significance of selectin-mediated processes to various immune and inflammatory responses in vivo has been demonstrated using selectin-deficient animals, anti-selectin antibodies, soluble bivalent selectin-IgG chimeric proteins, and the selectin ligand sLex tetrasaccharide as well as its analogs. Many of the same animal disease models, which have been shown to be complement-dependent using sCR1 as described above, have also been shown to be selectin-dependent using the sLex tetrasaccharide. For example, myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (13Buerke M. Weyrich A.S. Zheng Z. Gaeta F.C. Forrest M.J. Lefer A.M. J. Clin.

Furthermore, sCR1 and sCR1[desLHR-A] expressing the sLextetrasaccharide should have the potential not only to inhibit complement activation and selectin-mediated cellular interactions, but also to localize these activities at sites of inflammation where activated endothelium has up-regulated the expression of P- and E-selectin.

The chimeric gene was cloned into the eukaryotic expression vector pTCSLneo, which is pTCSgpt (21Carson G.R. Kuestner R.E. Ahmed A. Pettey C.L. Concino M.F. J. Biol.

Utilization of the single, internalXbaI restriction site at position 2717–2722 resulted in the truncation of 1136 base pairs of the 3′-untranslated region, thus deleting several potential mRNA-destabilizing sequence motifs such as ATTTA (six of seven motifs). Cotransfections were performed as described above. E-selectin expression was monitored by flow cytometry, and single clones were amplified in methotrexate.

The expression plasmid pT-CR1c6A coding for sCR1[desLHR-A] was prepared as described previously (8Scesney S.M. Makrides S.C. Gosselin M.L. Ford P.J. Andrews B.M. Hayman E.G. Marsh H.C. Eur. J.

High-expressing clones were selected in growth medium containing methotrexate. LEC11 cells secreting sCR1sLex or sCR1[desLHR-A]sLex were cultured in roller bottles, as described previously (8Scesney S.M. Makrides S.C. Gosselin M.L. Ford P.J. Andrews B.M. Hayman E.G. Marsh H.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar), and typically yielded 5–10 μg/ml glycoprotein in the medium. sCR1sLex and sCR1[desLHR-A]sLex were purified from cell culture supernatants by cation exchange chromatography (SP-Sepharose, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech or HS50, Perseptive Biosystems), ammonium sulfate precipitation, hydrophobic interaction chromatography (butyl-Toyopearl 650M, Tosohaas), buffer exchange chromatography (Sephadex G-25, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), anion exchange chromatography (DEAE, Tosohaas), size exclusion (HW65S, Tosohaas), or weak cation exchange (CM, Tosohaas) chromatography, and concentration by ultrafiltration. Overall purification yields were 40–70% for both sCR1[desLHR-A]sLex and sCR1sLex, resulting in typical lot sizes of up to 0.5–1.0 g of purified glycoprotein. Protein purity by Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was >95%, and in most cases >99%, for both proteins. Each of the purified glycoproteins (0.5 μg) was subjected to nonreducing SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by transfer to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford MA) using a semi-dry blotting system. The membranes were blocked with 5% dry milk in Dulbecco's PBS (phosphate-buffered saline without Ca2+ and Mg2+, Life Technologies, Inc.) and incubated with a mAb specific for CR1 (mAb 3C6.D11 (17Nickells M.

The neutral and amino sugar composition of the glycoproteins was determined by trifluoroacetic acid hydrolysis, reductive amination with anthranilic acid, separation by C18 reverse phase HPLC, and fluorescence detection (25Anumula K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 220: 275-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). Sialic acid content was determined by sodium bisulfate hydrolysis, reaction witho-phenylenediamine, separation by C18 reverse phase HPLC, and fluorescence detection (26Anumula K.R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 230: 24-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Glycoprotein samples were prepared and analyzed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry as described previously (27Linsley K. Chan S.Y. Chan S. Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. Anal.

A 25-μg aliquot of glycoprotein was reduced, denatured, and digested with N-glycosidase-F (Boehringer Mannheim) for 16 h at 37 °C, in the presence of 0.15% SDS (Bio-Rad) and 0.3% Nonidet P-40 (Sigma). The SDS and protein were removed after digestion by elution of the released glycans from a C18 Sep-Pak. The Sep-Pak cartridge (Waters number 20515) was attached to a 5-ml syringe (Hamilton number 1005) and rinsed with 7–8 ml of acetonitrile followed by 7–8 ml of 90% H2O, 10% AcCN by use of gentle air pressure. The digest was loaded onto the cartridge, and the glycans were eluted with 4 ml of 90% H2O, 10% AcCN. The volume was reduced on a Speed Vac Concentrator (Savant), and the sample transferred to a 1.5-ml glass Reacti-Vial, dried, and vacuum-desiccated prior to permethylation. For permethylation, desiccated samples were dissolved in 100 μl of a NaOH/Me2SO suspension, prepared by vortexing Me2SO and powdered sodium hydroxide. After 1 h at room temperature, 30 μl of methyl iodide was added, and the solution was held for 1 h at room temperature with occasional vortexing. Glycans were partitioned by adding 100 μl of chloroform, and the suspension was back-extracted six times with approximately 0.5 ml of H2O and the chloroform layer taken to dryness. Permethylation was repeated. All samples were stored at −20 °C. Periodate oxidation was performed using a 9 mm solution of NaIO4 buffered with 0.1 m sodium acetate at pH 5.5 in a dark cold room (4 °C) for 3 days. The reaction was quenched with 3 μl of ethylene glycol and allowed to stand overnight under the same conditions. The sample was neutralized with 0.1 m NaOH and reduced by the direct addition of 5 mg of solid NaB1H4 or NaB2H4 (which remained at room temperature for an additional 16 h). Excess reducing agent was destroyed by the addition of 5 μl of acetic acid and the solution dried in a vacuum centrifuge. Borate was removed as its ester by repeated addition and drying with methanol. The sample was vacuum-desiccated overnight prior to methylation. Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ES-MS) was performed on a Finnigan-MAT TSQ-700 (Finnigan-MAT Corp., San Jose, CA) instrument equipped with an electrospray ion source. Methylated glycans were dissolved in water/methanol solutions (40:60 v/v) containing 0.25 mm NaOH and analyzed by syringe pump flow injected at a rate of 0.85 μl/min directly into the electrospray chamber through a stainless steel hypodermic needle. The voltage difference between the needle tip and the source electrode was −3.7 kV. A unique feature of ES-MS is the generation of multiply charged ions from a single molecular species. Unlike fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy, which has difficulty in obtaining spectra of high molecular weight glycans, multiple charging brings the instrumentally measured mass (m/z) of large glycopeptides and glycans to an easily determined lower value. ES-MS data were analyzed directly or deconvoluted by an algorithm designed to extract molecular weight information from the peak spacing exhibited by parent ion multiply charging. This computational approach was accomplished by pattern recognition using a relative, or level-2, entropy algorithm (28Reinhold B.B. Reinhold V.N. J. Am. Soc. Mass Spectrom. 1992; 3: 207-215Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Treatment of the data in this manner suppresses the artifacts associated with alternative deconvolution algorithms. TheN-linked oligosaccharides were released intact from the glycoprotein by digestion with the recombinant enzyme peptide N-glycosidase F (Glyko). The glycoprotein was denatured by boiling for 5 min in 0.1% SDS, 50 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Nonionic detergent Nonidet P-40 was added to 0.75% followed by incubation with 0.5 milliunit of peptide N-glycosidase F overnight at 37 °C. The protein was removed by ethanol precipitation, and the supernatant containing the oligosaccharides was dried prior to labeling. The released oligosaccharides were fluorescently labeled by the addition of 0.15 m disodium 8-aminonapthalene-1,3-disulfonate in 15% acetic acid followed by an equal volume of 1.0 m NaBH3CN. The 8-aminonapthalene-1,3-disulfonate-labeled oligosaccharides were then separated by electrophoresis in a 21% polyacrylamide gel and imaged and analyzed using the FACE® Imager and software. The inhibition of complement-mediated lysis of antibody-sensitized sheep erythrocytes (classical pathway) or of guinea pig erythrocytes in EGTA-Mg2+ buffer (alternative pathway) was assessed as described previously (8Scesney S.M. Makrides S.C. Gosselin M.L. Ford P.J. Andrews B.M. Hayman E.G. Marsh H.C. Eur. J. Immunol. 1996; 26: 1729-1735Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). CHO DUKX-B11 cells expressing E-selectin (CHO/E-selectin) were harvested using PBS with 1 mm EDTA and washed with PBS containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA), 1 mm CaCl2. E-selectin expression was monitored with a fluorescein-labeled anti-ELAM1 mAb (Southern Biotechnology, Birmingham, AL). sCR1sLex and sCR1 were radiolabeled with 125I using the Bolton-Hunter reagent (NEN Life Science Products) to yield a specific activity of 1–2 × 105 cpm/μg of labeled protein. Mixtures of labeled and unlabeled protein (1:5) over a concentration range of 0.2–3 μm were incubated for 3 h at room temperature with 5 × 106 CHO cells expressing E-selectin in a sample volume of 0.25 ml. Bound and free ligand were separated by centrifuging the samples through a 0.2-ml layer of dibutyl/dioctyl phthalate (7/4 volume ratio) and quantitated using a γ-counter. Samples were run in triplicate. Nonspecific binding was determined using sCR1, and the apparent dissociation constant (K d(app)) for specific binding of sCR1sLex was estimated as the concentration yielding half-maximal binding. CHO cells were removed from flasks using trypsin and washed. The buffer used for flow cytometry was 0.2% BSA, 0.02% NaN3 in PBS, which included 0.9 mmCa2+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+. Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled glycoproteins were incubated at 500 μg/ml for 60 min at 4 °C with CHO/E-selectin cells (3 × 106 cells/ml), washed, and resuspended for analysis on a Becton Dickinson FACScan flow cytometer. Negative controls included untransfected CHO cells and sCR1-FITC. Expression of E-selectin was confirmed using a mAb-specific for human E-selectin (Serotec) and an isotype-matched irrelevant control mAb, which were incubated with the transfected CHO cells at 2 μg/ml for 30 min at 4 °C followed by a FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse Ig antibody (Becton Dickinson) for an additional 30 min. Human aortic endothelial cells (Clonetics), confluent in 96-well microtiter plates, were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor-α (100 units/ml) and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (20 ng/ml) for 4 h at 37 °C to up-regulate E-selectin. The cells were then washed twice with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 1% fetal bovine serum. Serial dilutions of sCR1[desLHR-A]sLex or sCR1[desLHR-A] were added to achieve final concentrations up to 2.7 μm. To each well, 5 × 105 U937 cells in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium were added and incubated for 20 min at 37 °C. The wells were filled with media, sealed, and centrifuged inverted at low speed for 5 min. The seal was removed, the plates blotted, and the number of bound cells in three microscope fields was determined and reported as a function of glycoprotein concentration with S.E. values. Flat bottom, black 96-well microtiter plates were coated with 2 μg/ml goat anti-human IgGγ, incubated with P-selectin-IgG-containing supernatants, and blocked using 2.5% BSA in PBS. U937 cells at 2 × 106 cells/ml in PBS were incubated 15 min at 37 °C with 2 μg/ml calcein-acetoxymethyl ester and washed three times with Dulbecco's PBS with 0.9 mmCa2+ and 0.5 mm Mg2+. Varying concentrations of sCR1 or sCR1sLex were added to the P-selectin-IgG-coated microtiter plates followed by the fluorescently labeled U937 cells at 2 × 105 cells/100 μl in each well. The plates were then centrifuged very slowly (<600 rpm) for 5 min followed by a 15–30 min incubation at room temperature. The wells were completely filled with PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, sealed, inverted, and centrifuged at low speed as before. The plate sealer was removed to empty the wells. Adherent cells remaining behind in the microtiter wells were lysed with 100 μl of TRAx® lysis buffer (Avant) and the fluorescence was measured (λex = 485 nm, λem = 530 nm; Cytofluor II, Perseptive Biosystems) and reported as means and S.E. The control mAb CSLEX1 which is specific for sLex was obtained as a hybridoma line (ATCC) and used as ascites fluid. The presence of sLex on the purified glycoproteins derived from LEC11 cell expression is clearly evident by staining with two different anti-sLex mAb (Fig.1, lanes 2, 4, 10, 12). The glycoproteins derived from both the LEC11 and DUKX B11 cells show comparable reactivity using anti-sCR1 mAb (lanes 5–8). Table Isummarizes the monosaccharide content for typical lots of each glycoprotein. As might be expected, the most striking difference between the LEC11- and DUKX B11-derived proteins was found in the fucose content, which was more than doubled for the LEC11-derived proteins, most likely due to α(1,3)-fucosyltransferase activity, which is a primary distinction between these cell lines. In general, the LEC11 versions of the proteins also had higher sialic acid content. This higher sialic acid content may reflect the fact that, in addition to sCR1 expression, the LEC11 clones were selected for high sLex expression and hence high sialic acid. Both versions of sCR1 tended to have higher glucosamine, galactose, and mannose than did the versions of sCR1[desLHR-A], reflecting a greater number of complex oligosaccharide chains on the larger protein.Table IMonosaccharide content (mol/mol glycoprotein)sCR1[desLHR-A]sCR1[desLHR-A]sLexsCR1sCR1sLexGlucosamine51.763.880.079.6Galactose22.627.633.541.8Mannose34.641.061.048.6Fucose9.6522.414.737.2Sialic acid21.925.920.425.7 Open table in a new tab TableII summarizes the N-linked oligosaccharide content of typical lots of each glycoprotein as a mole percent of each glycan species. Only complex type N-linked oligosaccharides were observed. Significant quantities of high mannose oligosaccharides were not observed. No evidence of unusual oligosaccharide types or sulfated forms was observed. While measurable differences were obtained between separate lots of the same protein (data not shown) or between each of the four different proteins (TableII), certain general trends were clearly evident. For example, the predominant species of complex N-linked oligosaccharide was typically biantennary (70–80%), followed by triantennary (12–25%) and tetraantennary (1–10%). Approximately 97% of oligosaccharides had core α(1–6)-fucose.Table IIOligosaccharide content (mol %) by ES-MSGlycoform2The abbreviations for the N-linked complex oligosaccharides listed as glycoforms in Table II are as follows.

Mayer H. Yokota A. Hollingsworth R.I. Carlson R. J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 2155-2159Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). R. leguminosarumlipid A therefore lacks many of the features thought to be necessary for stimulation of innate immunity in animals (1Raetz C.R.H. Annu. Rev.

Despite the structural diversity of their lipid A moieties, bothE. coli and R. leguminosarum employ the same seven enzymes to synthesize the key, phosphate-containing lipid A precursor, Kdo2-lipid IVA 1The abbreviations used are: Kdo, 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid; TEA, triethylamine; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; CHAPS, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonic acid; COSY, two-dimensional 1H correlation spectroscopy.

The biosynthetic origins of the galacturonic acid and the aminogluconate moieties are unknown. We have recently discovered that lipid A of R. leguminosarumcan be separated into five related molecular species (14Que N.L.S. Basu S.S. White K.A. Raetz C.R.H.

Raetz, manuscript in preparation. two of which are shown in Fig. 1 A (dashed bond at position 3). Structural studies have revealed that some of this heterogeneity can be attributed to lipid A variants lacking the equivalent of the ester-linked β-hydroxymyristoyl moiety that is usually attached to the 3-position of lipid A disaccharides (Fig. 1) (14Que N.L.S. Basu S.S. White K.A. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 1284Google Scholar, 15Lin S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. Que N.L.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (B56 (abstr.)): A14LGoogle Scholar). Unexpectedly, our reevaluation of the structure of R. leguminosarum lipid A also indicates the presence of a single acyloxyacyl moiety in all five molecular species (14Que N.L.S. Basu S.S. White K.A. Raetz C.R.H. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (abstr.): 1284Google Scholar,15Lin S. Woods A.S. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. Que N.L.S. FASEB J. 1998; 12 (B56 (abstr.)): A14LGoogle Scholar),2 as illustrated in Fig. 1 A for two of the subtypes. We now describe a divalent cation-dependent deacylase fromR. leguminosarum membranes that selectively removes a single 3-O-linked β-hydroxyacyl chain from certain precursors of lipid A that are common to both E. coli and R. leguminosarum. The enzyme removes only the ester-linked β-hydroxymyristoyl residue that is attached to the 3-position of the proximal glucosamine unit (3Raetz C.R.H. Neidhardt F.C. 2nd Ed. Escherichia coli and Salmonella: Cellular and Molecular Biology. 1. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1996: 1035-1063Google Scholar) of precursors like lipid IVA(Fig. 1 B) and Kdo2-lipid IVA. It is also capable of cleaving the monosaccharide precursor lipid X at a slow rate. A similar deacylase is found in membranes of P. aeruginosa, in which the presence of 3-O-deacylated lipid A species is well established (Fig. 1 A) (25Kulshin V.A. Zahringer U. Lindner B. Jager K.E.

The enzyme may therefore account for the presence of the 3-O-deacylated lipid A subtypes found inR. leguminosarum (Fig. 1 A), and it may be a useful reagent for the preparation of novel endotoxin analogs with which to study innate immunity.

Prior to use, all lipid substrates were dispersed by sonic irradiation for 1 min in a bath sonicator. The substrate 32P-lipid X was prepared from32Pi labeled cells of E. coli strain MN7, as described previously (33Takayama K. Qureshi N. Mascagni P. Nashed M.A. Anderson L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

Tetraacyldisaccharide-1-32P was made from32P-lipid X and UDP-2,3-diacylglucosamine using a highly purified preparation of E. coli disaccharide synthase (34Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

The [4′-32P]lipid IVA(100 μm, 20,000 cpm/nmol) was hydrolyzed for 90 min at 100 °C in 0.2 m HCl to make tetraacyldisaccharide-4-32P. Gal-Man-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVAwas prepared from Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (20,000 cpm/nmol, 20 μm) with membranes of R. meliloti 1021/pIJ 1848, which overexpresses both the mannosyl transferase and the galactosyl transferase (24Kadrmas J.L. Allaway D. Studholme R.E. Sullivan J.T. Ronson C.W. Poole P.S. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 26432-26440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The reaction mixture was incubated with 0.75 mg/ml membrane protein at 30 °C for 90 min. The membranes were then inactivated by heating at 65 °C for 10 min. The deacylase reaction (see below) was subsequently carried out in the same reaction tube without further purification of the substrate by adding the additional necessary components. Lauroyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVAwas synthesized from Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA with Kdo-dependent lauroyl transferase (HtrB), partially purified from MLK1067/pKS12 (35Clementz T. Bednarski J.J.

Chem. 1997; 272: 10353-10360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). The reaction conditions for lauroyl transferase were as follows: 0.35 μg/ml lauroyl transferase, Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (20,000 cpm/nmol, 20 μm), lauroyl-ACP (30 μm), Triton X-100 (0.2%), MgCl2 (5 mm), and NaCl (50 mm) at pH 7.5 in 50 mm Hepes. The reaction mixture was incubated at 30 °C for 60 min. The lauroyl transferase was inactivated by heating the reaction mixture at 65 °C for 10 min. The heat-inactivated reaction mixture was then used as the substrate for the deacylase reaction without further purification. Two liters of mid-logarithmic phase cells (A 550 = 0.6–0.8) were harvested by centrifugation (7,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C) and were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, to give a final protein concentration of 5–10 mg/ml. Cells were broken by passage through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i. Remaining intact cells and large debris were removed by centrifugation at 7000 × g for 15 min. Membranes were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 149,000 × g for 60 min. Membrane pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, at a protein concentration of ∼10 mg/ml. All preparations were carried out at 4 °C, and samples were stored frozen in aliquots at −80 °C. Protein concentrations were determined with bicinchoninic acid (37Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Optimized standard assay conditions for the deacylase were as follows. The reaction mixture (10–20 μl) contained 50 mm MES, pH 6.25, 1.0% Triton X-100, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm calcium chloride, and 10 μm [4′-32P]lipid IVA (20,000 cpm/nmol). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min or as indicated. The reactions were terminated by spotting 2–5-μl samples onto silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plates. The spots were allowed to dry, and the plates were developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (50:50:16:5, v/v/v/v). When substrates other than lipid IVA or tetraacyldisaccharide 4′-phosphate were used, a different solvent system was employed, consisting of chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:10, v/v/v/v). These alternative substrates were Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, Gal-Man-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA or lauroyl-Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA. The solvent chloroform/methanol/water/acetic acid (25:15:4:2, v/v/v/v) was used for deacylase reactions in which32P-lipid X or tetraacyldisaccharide-1-32P was the substrate. Radiochemical analyses of thin layer chromatography plates were carried out with a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager 425S, equipped with ImageQuant software. The percentage of conversion of unreacted32P-labeled substrates to enzymatic products was calculated for each reaction tube and could be converted to specific activity (nmol/min/mg) based on the chemical concentration of the substrate in the assay. Two incubations (designated 1 and 2) were set up using the standard optimized assay conditions for the deacylase with 10 μm[4′-32P]lipid IVA as the substrate. Incubation 1 contained no enzyme, while incubation 2 contained 1 mg/mlR. leguminosarum (8401) membranes. Both incubations 1 and 2 were incubated for 16 h at 30 °C. Under these conditions, the conversion of [4′-32P]lipid IVA to the slower migrating deacylation product was almost complete in incubation 2, whereas no change was seen in incubation 1. For mild base hydrolysis of the products, a 2-μl portion of each incubation was mixed with 3 μl of triethylamine (TEA) and 5 μl of H2O, and the material was then incubated for various times at 37 °C. After 0, 2, 5, and 120 min, 2-μl samples of the TEA hydrolysis mixture were added to 2 μl of H2O and spotted onto a silica gel 60 thin layer plate. For strong base hydrolysis of the products, 2-μl portions of 1 or 2 were mixed with 18 μl of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) and 0.4 μl of 10 m NaOH. This NaOH hydrolysis was carried out at room temperature for 30 min with occasional mixing of the phases. Next, each mixture was further diluted 3-fold with water, and 4-μl portions were spotted onto a silica gel 60 thin layer plate. The plates were developed with choloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (50:50:16:5, v/v/v/v), dried, and exposed overnight to a PhosphorImager screen. R. leguminosarum 8401 membranes, prepared by ultracentrifugation as described above, were enriched for the deacylase activity before being used for the large scale preparation of the reaction product. Membrane preparations (25 ml, 10 mg/ml protein) were mixed at 4 °C with 2.5% Triton X-100 for 90 min, followed by ultracentrifugation at 149,000 × g for 60 min. The pellet, containing the deacylase activity, was resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.5) to a protein concentration of 7.0 mg/ml. The detergent extraction process was repeated another time with 1% Triton X-100. In the pellet (resuspended in 10 ml of 50 mm Hepes buffer, pH 7.5; 5.5 mg/ml protein), more than 90% of the deacylase activity was recovered. The activity was enriched 2-fold (final specific activity of 0.1 nmol/mg/min), while most of the interfering 4′-phosphatase activity (>80%) was solubilized by the detergent. The procedure was also effective in removing about half of the membrane lipids. Three 10-ml deacylase reaction mixtures were prepared using 50 μm lipid IVA substrate and 2 mg/ml of Triton X-100-extracted membrane protein under conditions otherwise similar to the standard assay. The reaction mixtures were initially incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Then additional membranes were added to yield a final protein concentration of 3 mg/ml, and the reactions were continued for another 24 h. The progress of the reaction was monitored by thin layer chromatography, as described above for the assays, but the deacylase product was detected by charring the plates after spraying with 10% sulfuric acid in ethanol. More than 90% of the substrate was deacylated under these conditions. Prior to product isolation, the reaction mixtures were stored at −20 °C. After thawing, the reactions were distributed equally into two 150-ml Corex bottles. The reactions were diluted with water to yield a final volume of 20 ml/bottle. The proteins were precipitated by adding 1.25 ml of CHCl3, 2.5 ml of methanol, and 0.04 ml of concentrated HCl per ml of the diluted reaction mixtures. The samples were thoroughly mixed, and then centrifuged at 3,000 × g for 20 min at room temperature. The supernatant was decanted, and it was converted to a two-phase system by adding 0.263 ml of CHCl3 and 0.263 ml of water per ml of supernatant. After mixing, the phases were separated by centrifugation, as above. The CHCl3-rich lower phase was removed, and the upper phase was washed twice with fresh, preequilibrated lower phase (i.e. a lower phase generated by mixing chloroform, methanol, and 0.1 m HCl in a ratio of 2:2:1.8, v/v/v). The lower phases were pooled, 0.5 ml of pyridine was added to neutralize residual HCl, and the solvent was removed by rotary evaporation. The residue was redissolved in ∼15 ml of chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (70:60:16:3, v/v/v/v) and was loaded onto a 9.5-ml silicic acid column, equilibrated in the same solvent. The column was washed with another 20 ml of the same solvent, followed by 60 ml of chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v). The lipid IVA-derived deacylase product was then eluted with ∼20 ml of an acidic single phase Bligh and Dyer mixture, consisting of chloroform, methanol, and 0.1 m HCl (1:2:0.8, v/v/v) (38Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (43133) Google Scholar). The fractions containing the desired product were identified by thin layer chromatography, followed by charring as described above. The pertinent fractions were pooled and converted to a two-phase system by the addition of 0.263 ml of CHCl3 and 0.263 ml of water per ml. The solution was mixed, and the phases were separated by centrifugation. The lower phase was collected, and the upper phase was washed twice with preequilibrated acidic lower phase (see above). The lower phases were pooled, 5–10 μl of high pressure liquid chromatography grade pyridine was added, and the solvents were removed by rotary evaporation. A small amount of contaminating lipid IVA was removed from the deacylase product by the reverse phase chromatography procedure described by Hampton et al. with minor modifications (39Hampton R.Y.

Cellular proliferation is the result of growth factor-receptor binding and activation of cellular signaling pathways to regulate specific gene transcription. To determine the mechanism of the age-related difference in proliferation, we evaluated extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase activation and events upstream in the signaling pathway in epidermal growth factor (EGF)-stimulated hepatocytes isolated from young and old rats. We confirm the age-associated decrease in extracellular signal-regulated kinase-mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in response to EGF that has been previously reported. We also find that the activity of the upstream kinase, Raf kinase, is decreased in hepatocytes from old compared with young rats. An early age-related difference in the EGF-stimulated pathway is shown to be the decreased ability of the adapter protein, Shc, to associate with the EGF receptor through the Shc phosphotyrosine binding domain. To address the mechanism of decreased Shc/EGF receptor interaction, we examined the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at tyrosine 1173, a site recognized by the Shc phosphotyrosine binding domain. Tyrosine 1173 of the EGF receptor is underphosphorylated in the hepatocytes from old animals compared with young in a Western blot analysis using a phosphospecific antibody that recognizes phosphotyrosine 1173 of the EGF receptor.

The proliferative potential of several tissues, including the liver, declines with age (1Bucher N.L.R. Swaffield M.N. DiTroia J.F. Cancer Res. 1964; 24: 509-512PubMed Google Scholar, 2Beyer H.S. Sherman R. Zieve L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1991; 117: 101-108PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to proliferate or regenerate hepatocytes is particularly important in the elderly, who, due to drug metabolism and other environmental exposures, need to replace cells that are destroyed due to toxic reactions. Thus, an age-related decline in the ability to proliferate may limit the ability of the elderly to recover from toxic exposures. The molecular mechanism underlying the age-related decrease in proliferative response is not well understood. Cellular proliferation is activated by a cascade of signals initiated at the cell membrane in response to growth factor binding to its receptor. In response to the mitogen, epidermal growth factor (EGF), 1The abbreviations used are: EGF, epidermal growth factor; MAP, mitogen-activated protein; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; MKP, mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; SH2, Src homology 2; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase. hepatocytes from old rats compared with young rats have diminished induction of DNA synthesis (2Beyer H.S. Sherman R. Zieve L. J. Lab. Clin. Med. 1991; 117: 101-108PubMed Google Scholar). However, hepatocyte EGF receptor number and binding to the receptor are similar with age (3Ishigami A. Reed T.D. Roth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Such data suggest that age-related differences in proliferation may involve differences in the signal transduction pathways stimulated by growth factors. The binding of EGF to its receptor initiates a series of signaling events to induce DNA synthesis and cell division. In response to ligand binding, the EGF receptor is phosphorylated, which leads to membrane recruitment of adapter and exchange proteins for activation of Ras and subsequent Raf kinase activation (4Buday L.

Downstream of Raf kinase, activation of a series of kinases proceeds to activate primarily ERK-MAP kinase in response to EGF (7Davis R.J. J. Biol.

Biol. 1994; 14: 6683-6688Crossref PubMed Scopus (436) Google Scholar). The MAP kinase family of proteins are activated by dual phosphorylation on Thr-X-Tyr residues (reviewed in Refs. 9Hunter T. Cell. 1995; 80: 225-236Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2608) Google Scholar and 10Robinson M.J. Cobb M.H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1997; 9: 180-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (2286) Google Scholar). Other members of the MAP kinase family include JNK and p38 MAP kinases, which are primarily activated by proinflammatory cytokines and cellular stress (reviewed in Ref. 11Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 24313-24316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar). Upstream activators of these kinases can function both specifically and with cross-specificity, resulting in activation of more than one MAP kinase. For example, in response to EGF, ERK-MAP kinase is activated as much as 20-fold, while JNK-MAP kinase is activated up to 6-fold (12Minden A. Lin A. McMahon M. Lange-Carter C. Derijard B. Davis R.J.

Activation of ERK-MAP kinase results in phosphorylation of a number of target proteins including Elk-1 of the ternary complex factor. Elk-1 mediates transcriptional activation of many genes, including c-fos and, consequently, AP-1 target genes (15Karin M. J. Biol.

We have used a model of primary hepatocytes obtained from young (4–6-month) or old (>32-month) rats to investigate the mechanism for the age-related differences in signal transduction pathways that are activated in response to EGF. ERK-MAP kinase activity was previously reported to be substantially reduced in hepatocytes from old compared with young rats (20Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). In addition to decreased ERK-MAP kinase activation by EGF, we found that activity of Raf kinase, an upstream signal transducer, was also substantially decreased without a change in Raf protein level in hepatocytes from old rats. The tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor was similar in hepatocytes from young and old after EGF stimulation, suggesting that the age-related difference is after receptor activation and before Raf kinase activation. Therefore, we examined the ability of the adapter protein, Shc, to associate with the EGF receptor. Using both direct immunoprecipitation and GST fusion protein capture assays, we observed a decrease in the association of the activated EGF receptor with Shc in hepatocytes from old animals compared with young. Furthermore, we show by Western blot analysis that site-specific phosphorylation at tyrosine 1173 of the EGF receptor, a Shc interaction site, is reduced in hepatocytes from old compared with the young. These results indicate that the reduced ability of the EGF receptor to associate with Shc is an early step in the EGF signal transduction pathway that is altered with age. Hepatocytes were isolated from young (4–6-month) or old (>30-month) male F1 F344 X BN rats by perfusion of the liver with collagenase, type 2 (Worthington) according to the procedure of Seglen (21Seglen P.O. Methods Cell Biol. 1976; 13: 29-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (5225) Google Scholar) with the modification of using a HEPES (10 mm)-based buffer (22Rana B. Mischoulon D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cell viability (>85%) was determined by trypan blue exclusion. The cells (5.5 × 106/100-mm dish) were plated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin (100 μg/ml), and streptomycin (100 μg/ml) on tissue culture dishes precoated with Matrigel (1.2 mg/100-mm dish; Collaborative Research, Lexington, MA). Matrigel supports the differentiated state of hepatocytes similar to that in the native liver (22Rana B. Mischoulon D. Xie Y. Bucher N.L.R. Farmer S.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5858-5869Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two hours after plating, the medium was removed, cells were washed gently two times with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium alone, and treatment medium was added (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 0.5% fetal bovine serum plus glucose, 5 mm; insulin, 0.14 μm; hydrocortisone, 5 μm; sodium selenite, 0.2 μg/ml; and transferrin, 1 μg/ml). Following plating of the cells (24 h), human EGF (50 ng/ml; Life Technologies, Inc.) was added to the medium. Cells were harvested by washing with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (twice), scraped into phosphate-buffered saline, and pelleted by centrifugation, and protein extracts were prepared by extraction into a whole cell extract buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 0.3 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.05% Triton X-100, 20 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm orthovanadate, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (1 μg/ml)) for 30 min at 4 °C. Extracted cells were centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 15 min. Supernatants were frozen in aliquots at −70 °C. ERK-MAP kinase, JNK-MAP kinase, and Raf kinase activities were measured using an immune complex kinase assay (23Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 7420-7426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2046) Google Scholar). Briefly, whole cell extract (50 μg of protein) was immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) bound to protein A-Sepharose beads (Repligen Corp., Needham, MA). Myelin basic protein (Sigma) was used as the substrate for the p44 ERK kinase assay and the N-terminal c-Jun obtained from a GST fusion protein purified on glutathione-agarose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) was used as substrate for p46 JNK kinase. Purified MEK protein (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as substrate for Raf kinase. Activity was visualized by autoradiography of the dried 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and quantitation was assessed by PhosphorImager analysis using Molecular Dynamics phosphor imaging equipment. Specific antibody was bound to Protein A-Sepharose beads (Repligen Corp., Needham, MA). Human Shc antibody and phosphotyrosine antibody, PY20, were obtained from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY). The phosphospecific antibody, pY 1173, of the EGF receptor was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Drs. H. Hoschuetzky and P. Schuessler, nanoTools Antikorpertechnik, Denzlingen, Germany. 2H. Hoschuetzky and P. Schuessler, personal communication; see also, on the World Wide Web,http://www.nanotools.de. All other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Whole cell extracts (100–400 μg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with the bead-antibody complex. The beads were washed with Triton lysis buffer (0.1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 137 mmNaCl, 2 mm EDTA, 25 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 2 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 10% glycerol, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (1 μg/ml)), and the protein was eluted into 4× Laemmli's buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis was done by standard procedures after protein transfer to nitrocellulose membrane. Proteins were detected by a chemiluminescent procedure (NEN Life Science Products). Bacterially expressed GST-Shc domain fusion proteins were generated from pGEX-Shc-PTB and pGEX-Shc SH2 domain constructs obtained from K. Ravichandran (University of Virginia, Charlottesville, VA). The expressed proteins were bound to glutathione Sepharose beads. After washing three times with buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.4 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, leupeptin (1 μg/ml), and pepstatin (1 μg/ml)), whole cell extracts (120 μg of protein) were mixed with the beads/fusion protein and rocked for 2–4 h at 4 °C. After washing, the “captured” proteins were eluted into 4× Laemmli's buffer, boiled, and electrophoresed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The “captured” EGF receptor was identified by Western blot analysis using the EGF receptor antibody and detected with chemiluminescent reagents (NEN Life Science Products). In the signal transduction cascade to activate transcription of genes involved in proliferation, ERK-MAP kinase is the final regulatory step that directly interacts with transcriptional regulators. Therefore, we first measured activation of ERK-MAP kinase in response to EGF in hepatocytes isolated from young and old rats. In hepatocytes isolated from young rats, ERK-MAP kinase was maximally activated 15-fold (15 min, Fig.1). Activation of ERK-MAP kinase was only 5-fold in hepatocytes from old animals (Fig. 1). The activity returned to near base-line levels by 2 h. after the addition of EGF to the medium. (Note that the Fig. 1, top panels, show a higher than base line response of one pair of animals at 2 h. The average of all animals at this time was near base line.) JNK-MAP kinase was modestly activated (5-fold) by 60 min after the addition of EGF in cells from young animals (Fig. 2). Cells from old animals showed little EGF-stimulated JNK-MAP kinase activity compared with cells from young animals. The amount of protein determined by Western blot analysis for either JNK or ERK-MAP kinases stimulated with EGF was not different in the hepatocytes from young compared with old (Figs. 1and 2). These results are similar to the data reported for ERK- and JNK-MAP kinases previously (20Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Lee J.C. Holbrook N.J. Free Radical Biol. Med. 1996; 21: 771-781Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and confirm that there is a significant decline in EGF-dependent signaling in hepatocytes from old animals.Figure 2JNK-MAP kinase activation in response to EGF in hepatocytes from young and old rats. Top panel, representative activity (ACT.) of JNK-MAP kinase after 15, 60, or 120 min of EGF treatment (50 ng/ml) of hepatocytes isolated from young and old rats.

Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). An age-dependent increase in basal MKP-1 RNA expression was previously suggested to be involved in the mechanism for the decreased ERK-MAP kinase activation in response to EGF (13Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q. Kokkonen G.C. Mock Y.D. Roth G.S. Holbrook N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3604-3607Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). We measured the protein level of MKP-1 in whole cell extracts from hepatocytes of young and old rats as well as the level in the native liver. Fig. 3 shows that there is actually a decline in the amount of MKP-1 protein in both the liver (4.5-fold) and cultured hepatocytes (3-fold) with age. This suggests that the mechanism for the age-related difference in ERK-MAP kinase activation does not involve MKP-1. To determine if the age-dependent decline in ERK-MAP kinase activity was due to differences in upstream activation of the kinase pathway, we measured the activity of Raf kinase. Raf kinase is activated by Ras GTPase (6Avruch J. Zhang X. Kyriakis J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 279-283Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar). Ras is induced into the active GTP-bound form following the coupling of Ras to the EGF receptor via the SOS-GRB2-SHC complex (5Egan S.E. Giddings B.W. Brooks M.W. Buday L. Sizeland A.M. Weinberg R.A. Nature. 1993; 363: 45-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (1011) Google Scholar). Subsequent to Raf kinase activation, a series of kinases including MEK1 and -2 are activated by phosphorylation leading to activation of ERK-MAP kinase. Raf kinase activity was measured using an immune complex kinase assay with purified MEK as substrate. Raf kinase activity was significantly reduced at 15 min in EGF-stimulated hepatocytes from old animals compared with those from young animals (Fig.4). Importantly, Raf kinase activity was greater in the young than the old without a change in the protein level, indicating that specific activity of Raf kinase declined with age. These data suggest that age-related changes in the activation of the ERK-MAP kinase pathway may be upstream of Raf kinase. Upon activation of the EGF receptor, autophosphorylation of specific receptor tyrosines initiate the signaling cascade by creating phosphotyrosine sites for binding of SH2 domain-containing proteins that are critical for the recruitment of SHC, GRB2, and SOS proteins to the membrane. To establish if age-related differences in Raf kinase activity were due to differences in signaling initiated at the membrane, we determined the amount of tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig.5, no age-related differences in the amount of EGF receptor protein nor in the phosphorylation of the receptor upon EGF stimulation were found. Although no age-related changes in total phosphorylation of the EGF receptor were detected, we could not conclude that membrane signaling events are not different with age, since phosphorylation levels at specific sites were not determined by these methods. Therefore, as a functional measure of membrane membrane-coupled signaling, we examined the adapter protein Shc, in response to EGF. The adapter protein Shc associates with phosphotyrosine residues at positions 1148 and 1173 of the EGF receptor (26Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Nelson K. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar) and, itself, is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues upon activation of the EGF receptor (28Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar, 29Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar). These Shc phosphotyrosine residues create binding sites for the SH2 domain of the adapter protein, Grb2 (29Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gotoh N. Toyoda M. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). To determine differences in the age-associated ability to phosphorylate Shc, extracts from hepatocytes isolated from young and old rats were immunoprecipitated with Shc antibody and immunoblotted with a phosphotyrosine antibody. The age-dependent ability to phosphorylate Shc in response to EGF was not different (Fig.6 A), nor was there any age-associated difference in the amount of Shc protein (data not shown). However, the association of a 170-kDa protein with Shc was markedly reduced in extracts from hepatocytes of old animals compared with those from young animals (Fig. 6 A). In order to determine if this 170-kDa protein was the EGF receptor, Shc immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis using an EGF receptor antibody. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the Shc-associated EGF receptor protein was decreased in hepatocytes from old animals as compared with the young. To confirm the age-related decrease in the association between the EGF receptor and Shc, a GST capture experiment using bacterial fusion proteins of GST-Shc domains was performed. Three domains (shown in Fig.7 A) have been identified in the Shc protein. The N-terminal phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and the C-terminal SH2 domain recognize phosphotyrosine residues of the activated EGF receptor (27Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Nelson K. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 28Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar). The internal collagen homology domain contains tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated upon activation and create the binding sites for the SH2 domain of Grb2 (29Salcini A.E. McGlade J. Pelicci G. Nicoletti I. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2827-2836PubMed Google Scholar, 30Gotoh N. Toyoda M. Shibuya M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1997; 17: 1824-1831Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7 B, the amount of EGF receptor “captured” from the extracts of the hepatocytes from old animals is decreased in comparison with the young when using the bacterially expressed PTB domain of the Shc protein. The amount of decreased association between the proteins ranged from 2- to 3-fold in three independent experiments. Tyrosine 1148 has been identified to be a recognition site for binding of the Shc PTB domain (27Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Nelson K. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Sakaguchi K. Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Kimura S. Matsumura Y. Inushima K. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and tyrosine 1173 has been reported to be recognized by the Shc-SH2 domain (26Batzer A.G. Rotin D. Urena J.M. Skolnik E.Y. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell Biol. 1994; 14: 5192-5201Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Sakaguchi K. Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Kimura S. Matsumura Y. Inushima K. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) as well as the PTB domain (32Sakaguchi K. Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Kimura S. Matsumura Y. Inushima K. Kasuga M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1998; 12: 536-543Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the EGF receptor may be less phosphorylated specifically at tyrosine 1148 and/or 1173 with age. A difference in the phosphorylation state at these positions could exist and would not have been detectable by Western blot analysis for total phosphotyrosine in the EGF receptor-immunoprecipitated extracts (Fig.5) due to the abundance of tyrosine phosphorylation on multiple tyrosines on the EGF receptor. Furthermore, due to the low levels of EGF receptor in primary hepatocytes, we could not directly map the amount of phosphotyrosine residues at these specific sites. To determine whether the age-related difference in the ability of Shc to associate with the EGF receptor is due to a difference in level of phosphorylation at a specific site on the EGF receptor, we determined the amount of EGF receptor phosphorylation at tyrosine 1173 by Western blot analysis. Whole cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the EGF receptor antibody and immunoblotted with an antibody specific for the epitope containing phosphotyrosine 1173 of the EGF receptor. We found decreased levels of EGF receptor phosphotyrosine 1173 in response to EGF in hepatocytes isolated from old rats compared with young (Fig.8). The results with both direct Shc immunoprecipitation and the GST-Shc capture assay clearly suggest that a major cause of the age-related decrease in ERK-MAP kinase signaling pathway is due to an alteration in the EGF receptor coupling to the membrane signaling machinery. Furthermore, the results of the GST capture experiment (Fig. 7), using the PTB domain of Shc, indicate that the age-related difference is in the activated EGF receptor protein. Western blotting for phosphotyrosine 1173 (Fig. 8) confirms that the age-related difference in the ability of the EGF receptor to associate with Shc is due to a site-specific difference in tyrosine phosphorylation of the EGF receptor. The molecular basis of the age-related decrease in the capacity of some tissues to proliferate is not well understood. Cellular proliferation is initiated by growth factor binding to specific receptors to initiate signal transduction. Two models of age-related responses to proliferative stimuli have shown differences in either receptor number and/or receptor phosphorylation (33Reenstra W.R. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Reenstra W.R. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 35Garcia G.G. Miller R.A. Cell Immunol. 1997; 175: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). However, such differences are not found in the hepatocyte model for the liver (3Ishigami A. Reed T.D. Roth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In a human skin fibroblast model of aging, the EGF receptor number and phosphorylation kinetics were reduced in old compared with young (33Reenstra W.R. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1993; 209: 118-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar,34Reenstra W.R. Yaar M. Gilchrest B.A. Exp. Cell Res. 1996; 227: 252-255Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the comparison was done in cells derived from different locations i.e. foreskin (young) and forearm (old). This may reflect two very different sources of cells that are influenced by differences in environmental exposures as well as aging. Age-related differences were also reported in tyrosine phosphorylation of the CD3ζ chain of the T-cell receptor (35Garcia G.G. Miller R.A. Cell Immunol. 1997; 175: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Additionally, these age-related differences suggest cell type differences in the mechanism of responses to proliferative stimuli with age. Our results agree with those of Ishigami (3Ishigami A. Reed T.D. Roth G.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 196: 181-186Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and show that EGF receptor protein levels are similar, and in addition that total tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor is similar in hepatocytes from young or old rats. Thus, the age-related differences in EGF-stimulated hepatocyte proliferation do not seem likely to be caused by gross overall differences in receptor number or phosphorylation. These data suggested that the mechanistic age-related differences in the response to proliferative stimuli in hepatocytes may be downstream in the signal transduction pathway. MAP kinases are key regulators of transcription, since these are the catalysts for phosphorylation of transcription factors regulating proliferation. Blocking the ERK-MAP kinase pathway has been shown to down-regulate the mitogenic response (36Sale E.M. Atkinson P.G. Sale G.J. EMBO J. 1995; 15: 674-684Crossref Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Reduced activity of ERK-MAP kinase in response to EGF was previously identified in hepatocytes isolated from old rats compared with young. The mechanism of this decreased activation was suggested to be due to an increase in the basal RNA expression of the dual specificity phosphatase, MKP-1 (13Liu Y. Guyton K.Z. Gorospe M. Xu Q.

MKP-1 functions as a dual site phosphatase to inactivate the dually phosphorylated ERK-MAP kinase (24Sun H. Charles C.H. Lau L.F. Tonks N.K. Cell. 1993; 75: 487-493Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar, 25Chu Y. Solski P.A. Khosravi-Far R. Der C.J. Kelly K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6497-6501Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar) and inhibits cell division (37Brondello J.M. McKenzie F.R. Sun H. Tonks N.K. Poussegur J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1895-1904PubMed Google Scholar). Our data also show ERK-MAP kinase activity to be diminished in hepatocytes from old animals in response to EGF (Fig. 1). However, rather than measuring MKP-1 RNA expression, we determined the amount of MKP-1 protein and found the levels to be decreased in hepatocytes as well as in the native livers from old rats (Fig. 3), suggesting that MKP-1 is not regulating the age-related decrease in ERK-MAP kinase activity. Further support for the lack of a role for MKP-1 in regulating the decrease in ERK-MAP kinase comes from the work of Shapiro and Ahn (38Shapiro P.S. Ahn N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 1788-1793Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). They reported that MKP-1 has a positive effect on Raf kinase activity independent of the basal inhibition of ERK-MAP kinase activity. These results are consistent with our own, where we observed a decrease in Raf kinase activation in hepatocytes from old compared with young (Fig. 4), not an increase as would be expected if MKP-1 were increased. Our results indicate that the age-related difference in the proliferative response to EGF is upstream from ERK-MAP kinase activation. Since Raf kinase activation also declined with age (Fig.4), we examined the coupling of the EGF receptor to the ERK-MAP kinase signaling pathway. Age-related differences in the membrane complexes involved in signaling have previously been reported in T-lymphocytes (35Garcia G.G. Miller R.A. Cell Immunol. 1997; 175: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 39Ghosh J. Miller R.A. Mech. Ageing Dev. 1995; 80: 171-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar, 40Pahlavani M.A. Harris M.D. Richardson A. Cell.

We have identified an early step in the EGF receptor signal transduction pathway to be a decrease in the association of the adapter protein, Shc, with the activated EGF receptor in hepatocytes from old compared with young (Fig. 6). Furthermore, the results of the GST capture experiment (Fig.7 B), which employed bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing the PTB domain of Shc, indicate that the age-related difference in hepatocytes is in the activated EGF receptor protein. The PTB domain recognizes the tyrosine phosphorylation at position 1148 of the EGF receptor (27Batzer A.G. Blaikie P. Nelson K. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 4403-4409Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar, 32Sakaguchi K. Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Kimura S. Matsumura Y. Inushima K. Kasuga M. Mol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 26165-26169Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 57Okabayashi Y. Kido Y. Okutani T. Sugimoto Y. Sakaguchi K. Kasuga M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 18674-18678Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also observed a similar age-related decrease in the association of the EGF receptor with the SH2 domain of the Shc protein, which recognizes tyrosine 1173, although the magnitude of the association was not as great as with the Shc-PTB domain (data not shown). The idea that reduced association of Shc with the EGF receptor due to defects in autophosphorylation sites with the effect of reducing mitogenic activity is supported by the data of Gotoh et al. (42Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). A cell line containing a deletion mutant of the EGF receptor that lacked the autophosphorylation sites downstream of residue 1011 was used to show that EGF treatment could still result in stimulation of Shc phosphorylation but retained only approximately 20% of its mitogenic activity when measured as cell growth. Others have shown that EGF-stimulated mutant EGF receptors containing a deleted C-terminal portion of the EGF receptor or site-specific mutations of C-terminal autophosphorylation sites also stimulate Shc phosphorylation in NIH 3T3 cells (43Soler C. Alvarez C.V. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2207-2215PubMed Google Scholar, 44Li N. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465PubMed Google Scholar). Shc phosphorylation in the absence of binding to the EGF receptor (Figs. 6 and 7; Refs. 42Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 43Soler C. Alvarez C.V. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2207-2215PubMed Google Scholar, 44Li N. Schlessinger J. Margolis B. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3457-3465PubMed Google Scholar) may be in response to other non-autophosphorylation-dependent pathways initiated by EGF transphosphorylations, such as through the ErbB3 receptor (45Huang G.C. Ouyang X. Epstein R.J. Biochem. J. 1998; 331: 113-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 46Kim H.-H. Vijapurkar U. Hellyer N.J. Bravo D. Koland J.G. Biochem. J. 1998; 334: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The transforming ability of the C-terminal deletion mutant of the EGF receptor (42Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) is not inconsistent with our data, since it can be mediated in some cell types by Eps8, a substrate for EGF receptor tyrosine kinase activity (47Alvarez C.V. Shon K.-J. Miloso M. Beguinot L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16271-16276Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 48Gallo R. Provenzano C. Carbone R. Di Fiore P.P. Castellani L. Falcone G. Alema S. Oncogene. 1997; 15: 1929-1936Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Clearly, the complexities of the pathways that regulate the mitogenic response initiated by EGF ligand binding are not completely understood. The mechanism of the age-related decline in the ability of the liver to proliferate is identified from our data to probably involve factors that regulate the phosphorylation of the EGF receptor at the specific tyrosine residues that function as sites for binding of the adapter protein Shc. Our data identify tyrosine 1173 of the EGF receptor as one of the residues that is differentially phosphorylated with age in response to EGF (Fig. 8). Candidates of regulatory enzymes for the tyrosine phosphorylation include both kinases and phosphatases. Phosphatases may function as negative or positive regulators of signaling by directly acting on a phosphorylated tyrosine. For example, the phosphatase SHP-2 has been suggested to have a positive effect on EGF signaling (49Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 50Shi Z.Q. Lu W. Feng G.-S. J. Biol.

Cell Biol. 1996; 16: 1189-1202Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). We found no age-related difference in the level of SHP-2 protein expression or in the association of SHP-2 in the complex that was immunoprecipitated by Shc antibody following EGF stimulation (data not shown). Another phosphatase, SHP-1, has recently been reported to bind the activated EGF receptor at tyrosine 1173 (52Keilhack H. Tenev T. Nyakatura E. Godovac-Zimmermann J. Nielsen L. Seedorf K. Bohmer F.-D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24839-24846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Binding at this site resulted in decreased ERK-MAP kinase activity in response to EGF. Clearly, the balance between kinase and phosphatase activity is important in regulating the EGF signaling pathway. An alternative mechanism for regulation of signal transduction is suggested by the ability of proteins to mask specific SH2 domains of EGF receptor-coupled proteins (53Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Ong S.H. Guy G.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29892-29898Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). However, our data, particularly the GST capture experiments, do not suggest such a mechanism in the age-dependent decline in EGF signal transduction. Understanding the molecular mechanisms for the age-related differences in the proliferative response to EGF will require more information about the subtle mechanisms that modulate the EGF receptor-ERK signaling pathway. There are certain to be newly discovered regulators that will play a role. For example, it has only recently been shown through genetic and biochemical studies that the kinase suppressor of Ras is an important regulator of Raf activity (54Therrien M. Michaud N.R. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2684-2695Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar, 55Zhang Y. Yao B. Delikat S. Bayoumy S. Lin X.-H. Basu S. McGinley M. Chan-Hui P.-Y. Lichenstein H. Kolesnick R. Cell. 1997; 89: 63-72Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar); however, this regulation has also been reported to occur in a kinase-independent manner (56Michaud N.R. Therrien M. Cacace A. Edsall L.C. Spiegel S. Rubin G.M. Morrison D.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 12792-12796Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). Thus, the complexity of the molecular mechanisms of age-related differences in response to proliferative stimuli in different tissues will require a more in depth knowledge of the EGF signaling pathway.

However, it is also frequently expressed at high levels in acute myeloid leukemia. To elucidate the regulation of cyclin A1 gene expression, we cloned and analyzed the genomic structure of cyclin A1. It consists of 9 exons within 13 kilobase pairs. The TATA-less promoter initiates transcription from several start sites with the majority of transcripts beginning within a 4-base pair stretch. A construct containing a fragment from −190 to +145 showed the highest transcriptional activity. Transfection of cyclin A1promoter constructs into S2 Drosophila cells demonstrated that Sp1 is essential for the activity of the promoter. Sp1, as well as Sp3, bound to four GC boxes between nucleotides −130 and −80 as observed by gel shift analysis. Mutations in two or more of the four GC boxes decreased promoter activity by >80%. The promoter was found to be cell cycle-regulated with highest activities found in late S and G2/M phase. Further analyses suggested that cell cycle regulation was accomplished by periodic repression of the GC boxes in G1 phase. Taken together, our data show that cyclin A1 promoter activity critically depends on four GC boxes, and members of the Sp1 family appear to be involved in directing expression of cyclin A1 in both a tissue- and cell cycle-specific manner.

A growing family of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdk) 1The abbreviations used are: Cdk, cyclin-dependent kinases; RACE, rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends; kb, kilobase pair; bp, base pair; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; CDE, cycle-dependent element; CHR, cell cycle homology region. regulates a wide variety of cellular pathways (for review, see Ref. 1Morgan D.O. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1997; 13: 261-291Crossref PubMed Scopus (1810) Google Scholar). Cdc 2 (Cdk 1) and Cdk 2 play a central role in the cell cycle of mammalian cells. Substrate specificity and activity of Cdks are controlled by their interaction with different cyclins that trigger the initiation of cell cycle events (2Morgan D.O. Nature. 1995; 374: 131-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (2938) Google Scholar). Cdk 2 specifically interacts with cyclin E for G1/S progression and with cyclin A during S and G2/M phases. Cyclin B3 might be another partner for Cdc 2 and Cdk 2 during the G2/M phase (3Gallant P. Nigg E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). In accordance with their central role in mammalian cell cycle regulation, the levels of cyclins A and E (among other cyclins) oscillate in most if not all proliferating mammalian cells. Disruption of the murine cyclin A2 (the homolog of human cyclin A) leads to early embryonic death suggesting an essential role for this gene in embryonic cell cycle in mammals (4Murphy M. Stinnakre M.G. Senamaud-Beaufort C. Winston N.J. Sweeney C. Kubelka M. Carrington M. Brechot C. Sobczak-Thepot J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 83-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). The human cyclin A2 (also known as cyclin A) was initially cloned because its gene locus was the site of integration by the hepatitis B virus in a case of hepatocellular carcinoma (5Wang J. Chenivesse X. Henglein B. Brechot C. Nature. 1990; 343: 555-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (558) Google Scholar). It has also been implicated to be important in the recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma (6Chao Y. Shih Y.L. Chiu J.H. Chau G.Y. Lui W.Y. Yang W.K. Lee S.D. Huang T.S. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 985-990PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we cloned a second human cyclin A-like partner for Cdk 2, termed cyclin A1, that exhibits a highly restricted pattern of expression (7Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar). The high level tissue-specific expression of the human and murine cyclin A1 in testis suggests a specific role in meiosis (7Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar, 8Sweeney C. Murphy M. Kubelka M. Ravnik S.E. Hawkins C.F. Wolgemuth D.J. Carrington M. Development. 1996; 122: 53-64Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Very low levels are detected in other tissues by reverse transcriptase-PCR; however, high levels of human cyclin A1 were also found in acute myeloid leukemia cell lines (7Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar) and myeloid leukemia samples from patients (9Yang R. Nakamaki T. Lubbert M. Said J. Sakashita A. Freyaldenhove B.S. Spira S. Huynh V. Muller C. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2067-2074PubMed Google Scholar). This intriguing observation might suggest a possible role for cyclin A1 in proliferation and differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors and/or in promotion of growth of leukemic cells. Cyclin A1 shows homology to cyclin A2 and forms in vivocomplexes with Rb as well as with E2F (10Yang R. Muller C. Huynh V. Fung Y.K. Yee A.S. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2400-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Cyclin A1-Cdk 2 complexes phosphorylate these substrates in vitro (10Yang R. Muller C. Huynh V. Fung Y.K. Yee A.S. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2400-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Our data showing that cyclin A1 is expressed in hematopoietic progenitors (9Yang R. Nakamaki T. Lubbert M. Said J. Sakashita A. Freyaldenhove B.S. Spira S. Huynh V. Muller C. Koeffler H.P. Blood. 1999; 93: 2067-2074PubMed Google Scholar) and interacts with Rb family members and E2F, suggest that it may affect cell cycle progression in expressing cells. The pattern of cyclin A1 expression indicates that the regulation of its expression is different from that of cyclin A2. Furthermore, overexpression of cyclin A1 in myeloid leukemia originates at the transcriptional level. To elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms that underlie the tissue-specific pattern of expression, we cloned and analyzed the genomic organization of the cyclin A1 gene and its promoter region. The highest transcriptional activity was assigned to a 335-bp fragment that required intact GC boxes located between −60 and −120 bp upstream of the main transcriptional start sites. These sites are also essential for cell cycle regulation of the promoter. Thecyclin A1 gene was cloned by screening a genomic Fix II lambda library made from placenta (Stratagene) using the cyclin A1 cDNA as a probe (7Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar). Of the several phage clones obtained, one contained all the exons and included a 1.3-kb region upstream of the 5′ end of the cDNA. A 2.2-kb NotI-BamHI fragment from the 5′ end of the gene was subcloned into the pRS316 cloning vector. The construct was further digested using SmaI; and three fragments were subcloned into PUC19. The fragments were sequenced in both directions using cycle sequencing and an automated sequencer (ABI373) or Sequenase 2.0 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The positions and lengths of the introns were determined by PCR amplification of the entire cyclin A1 coding region with different primers (detailed primer information will be provided on request). Subsequently, PCR products were either subcloned using pGEM-T-Easy (Promega) or directly sequenced using cycle sequencing. Boundaries of the ∼4.5-kb intron 2 were determined by direct sequencing of the lambda phage clone. The initial luciferase constructs were generated by PCR amplification of the pRS316 plasmid containing the 2.2-kb cyclin A1 fragment. A BglII site at the 5′ end and a BamHI site at the 3′ end were introduced and the Pfu-amplified fragment was cloned into the BglII site of PGL3-Basic. The +145 fragment was generated to include the potential E2F site at +138. The ATG in the primer (the initiating codon for cyclin A1) was mutated to ATT to avoid the initiation of translation. All constructs were confirmed to have the correct sequence by DNA sequencing. The 5′ deletions were generated by exonuclease III treatment usingKpnI/SacI-digested PGL3-Basic containing the −1299 to +145 fragment and the Erase-a-base kit (Promega). The end points of the deletions were determined by sequencing. The −37 fragment was constructed by digesting the −190 to +145 containing PGL3-Basic with NaeI and HindIII and subsequent cloning of the 200-bp fragment into PGL3-Basic digested withSmaI and HindIII. HeLa cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum containing 100 units/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For transfection, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into 60-mm plates 16 h before transfection. Transfection was carried out using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Two μg of luciferase reporter plasmid was transfected together with 300 ng of a CMV-β-gal expression vector used for standardization. Cells were harvested and assayed for luciferase and β-galactosidase activity after 48 h. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and were independently performed at least three times. Data of luciferase assays are shown as mean ± S.E. of three independent experiments unless stated otherwise. The Drosophila cell line SL2 was obtained from ATCC and grown at room temperature in Schneider's insect cell medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. Insect cells were transfected using Superfect (Qiagen). Briefly, 5 × 105 cells were seeded into 6-well plates and the Superfect/DNA mixture was added dropwise. One μg of the luciferase reporter was transfected with or without 100 ng of the Sp1 expression vector pAC-Sp1, which was a kind gift from Dr. E. Stanbridge (University of California, Irvine). Luciferase activity was analyzed after 48 h. Luciferase values could not be standardized using β-galactosidase activity because the viral promoters in the available plasmids also depended strongly on Sp1 for adequate expression. All experiments were carried out in duplicate and independently performed at least three times. HeLa cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE as described above. After transfection, cells were cultured in 0.1% fetal calf serum containing medium. After 16 h, medium was exchanged, and cells were synchronized essentially as described (11Carbonaro-Hall D. Williams R. Wu L. Warburton D. Zeichner-David M. MacDougal M. Tolo V. Hall F. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 1649-1659PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were arrested in G1 by serum starvation (0.1% fetal calf serum), in early S phase by aphidicolin (2 μg/ml), and in S phase by aphidicolin treatment and release into fresh medium 6 h before harvest. Cells were arrested in G2/M phase by nocodazole (0.1 μg/ml). Appropriate synchronization was confirmed by DNA quantitation using flow cytometry, and the experiments were performed at least three times. For the cell cycle release experiments, HeLa cells were arrested using aphidicolin as described above, and cells were harvested at the different time points after their release in fresh medium. The time course experiments were independently performed two times. To analyze cell cycle-regulated activity of different constructs, HeLa cells were arrested by serum starvation for 36 h followed by aphidicolin arrest and subsequently released for 18 h. At this time point, most cells were in late S or in G2/M phase. The longer serum starvation of the cells led to better synchronization and a higher induction after release. The release experiments were independently performed at least three times. All luciferase values were normalized using β-galactosidase activity as described above. The rapid amplification of 5′ cDNA ends (RACE) was performed using a 5′-RACE system (Life Technologies, Inc.). The procedure was performed as suggested in the manufacturer's protocol using RNA of the myeloid leukemia cell lines ML1 and U937. RNA was reversed-transcribed using the primer 5′-CCCTCTCAGAACAGACATACA (positions +981 to +961 of the cDNA) and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.). Gene-specific cDNA was PCR-amplified using the gene-specific primer 5′-CTGATCCAGAATAACACCTGA (positions +460 to +440 of the cDNA) and the universal 5′-RACE Abridged Anchor Primer 5′-GGCCACGCGTCGACTAGTACGGGIIGGGIIGGGIIG. PCR amplifications from both RNA samples yielded a single band of ∼450 bp. The entire PCR product was phenol/chloroform-extracted, precipitated using NH4+ acetate, and finally cloned into pGEM-T-Easy and sequenced. The primer extension assay was carried out by reverse transcription of 10 μg of RNA (U937) using a 32P-labeled primer 5′-CTCCTCCCACCAGACAGGA corresponding to +97 to +79 on the cDNA. Hybridization was carried out overnight at 58 °C. Superscript II was used for reverse transcription at 42 °C for 50 min. Extension products were resolved on a 8% sequencing gel with a sequencing reaction being run in parallel. As negative controls, we used tRNA and a sample without RNA. Nuclear extracts from HeLa cells were prepared as described (12Chumakov A.M. Miller C.W. Chen D.L. Koeffler H.P. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3005-3011PubMed Google Scholar). For gel retardation experiments, 1 ng of 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotides containing either GC boxes 1 + 2 (5′-CCTGCCCCGCCCTGCCCCGCCCAGCC) or GC boxes 3 + 4 (5′-CCTTCCCCGCCCTGCCCCGCCCGGCCC) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature with 5 μg of HeLa nuclear extract. The final reaction contained 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5% glycerol, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). For competition experiments, 100 ng of double-stranded oligonucleotide containing either a Sp1 consensus site (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC), the oligonucleotide used for gel retardation (see above), or a nonspecific oligonucleotide (5′-GAGACCGGCTCGAACGCAATCATGT) was preincubated for 15 min at room temperature with the nuclear extracts before the addition of the labeled oligonucleotide. For supershift experiments, 2–3 μg of polyclonal antibody against Sp1 (Pep2, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or Sp3 (D20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was preincubated with the nuclear extracts. Reactions were loaded on a 0.5× TBE, 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel and run for 2–3 h at 10 V/cm. Gels were dried and autoradiographed. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed according to the method from Deng and Nickoloff (13Deng W.P. Nickoloff J.A. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 200: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar) using the Transformer site-directed mutagenesis kit (CLONTECH). In brief, phosphorylated oligonucleotides containing the desired mutation were annealed on the single-stranded PGL3-Basic plasmid (containing the fragment −190 to +145) together with the oligonucleotide 5′-AATCGATAAGAATTCGTCGACCGA that changes the unique BamHI site to an EcoRI site. The complementary strand was extended and completed from the annealed oligonucleotides using T4 polymerase and T4 ligase. Selection for the mutant plasmid was performed by two rounds of digestion withBamHI and subsequent transformations first into the repair-deficient strain BMH 71-18 mutS and finally into DH5α. The entire promoter fragment was sequenced to verify desired mutations and to exclude second site mutations. Because of the short distances between GC boxes 1 + 2 and 3 + 4, oligonucleotides were designed to mutate both GC boxes simultaneously. Mutations in all four GC boxes were introduced by simultaneously adding oligonucleotides 1 + 2 and 3 + 4. All oligonucleotides used in these experiments were 5′-phosphorylated. The following oligonucleotides were used (mutated bases underlined): GC box 1, CCCCGCCCTGCCCCTTACAGCCGGCCACC; GC box 2, CCAACCCTGCCCTTACCTGCCCCG; GC box 3, CCCTGCCCCTTCCGGCCCGGCC; GC box 4, CTGCCCTTCCCTTCCCTGCCCC; GC boxes 1 + 2, GCCCAACCCTGCCCTTACCTGCCCCTTACAGCCGGCCACCTC; GC boxes 3 + 4, CTTCCCTGCCCTTCCCTTACCT GCCCCTTACGGCCCGGCCCGGCC. The suspected CDE in the cyclin A1 promoter was mutated using the following oligonucleotide, CCACCTCTTAACAAGCTTCCTCCAGTGCA. A human genomic lambda phage library was screened using the cDNA of cyclin A1 as a probe. Several clones containing pieces of the gene were obtained, and one clone with a 14.5-kb insert contained the entire gene. A 2.2-kb fragment at the 5′ end of the gene was subcloned and sequenced (see “Materials and Methods”). The 2.2-kb fragment contained the first intron and parts of exon 2. The other exon-intron boundaries were analyzed by PCR amplification and sequencing using sets of primers that span the entire coding region. The human cyclin A1 gene consists of 9 exons and 8 introns that extend over ∼13 kb (Fig. 1). All the exon-intron boundaries adhere to the consensus sequence. The translation initiation codon is located in the first exon. A second in-frame ATG that resembles the starting codon of the murinecyclin A1 is found in exon 2, 50 nucleotides downstream of intron 1 of the human cyclin A1 gene. Transcription start sites were determined using primer extension analysis and 5′-RACE (Fig.2). Both methods demonstrated the existence of several transcription start sites. The PCR product from the RACE reaction consisted of a single band of ∼450 bp. Sequencing of the inserts after cloning revealed that 80% of the RACE products (20/25) started from a 4-base pair stretch, and thus the predominant start site was assigned +1 (Fig. 2 A). This site is 130 bp upstream of the translation initiating ATG codon. Primer extension analysis identified the same start sites, but minor products were also seen further upstream (Fig. 2 B). The major start site coincides with the RACE results of the 5′ end of the initially described cDNA clone (7Yang R. Morosetti R. Koeffler H.P. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 913-920PubMed Google Scholar). We also looked for transcription start sites upstream of the second ATG in intron 1. However, neither RACE clones nor primer extension assays showed evidence for a second transcript in myeloid leukemia cells (data not shown). Genomic sequences 1299 bp upstream of the transcription start site were cloned and sequenced. No TATA box was found in proximity to the putative transcription start site. The main transcriptional start site is likely to function as an initiator region (Inr) since the sequence “CCAGTT” is very similar to the consensus Inr sequence “TCA (G/T) T (T/C)” (14Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). No DPE element was found downstream of the main transcriptional start site (14Burke T.W. Kadonaga J.T. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 3020-3031Crossref PubMed Scopus (400) Google Scholar). Several potential binding sites for transcription factors occur within the sequence (Fig. 3). An E2F site is located at +140 and another possible site at +68. A site that resembles the cycle-dependent element (CDE) of the cyclin A2promoter was found at −28 (15Zwicker J. Lucibello F.C. Wolfraim L.A. Gross C. Truss M. Engeland K. Muller R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4514-4522Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). However, this element was located on the antisense strand. No cell cycle genes homology region (CHR) was found. Potential Myb sites are predicted at positions +2, −30, and −90. The nucleotide sequence contains two CpG islands of up to 90% GC content reaching from −1000 to −700 and from −550 to −50. Multiple GC boxes are found in this region, and six GC boxes grouped as three double sites are located between nucleotides −150 and −45. Portions of the cyclin A1 promoter werePfu PCR-amplified and cloned into the promoterless PGL3-Basic Luciferase vector. Promoter activity was analyzed after transient transfection into HeLa cells. The construct containing nucleotides from −1299 to +145 from the 5′ cyclin A1upstream region showed significant promoter activity when cloned in the sense direction (Fig. 4). The same fragment cloned in the opposite direction or a construct containing solely exon 1 and intron 1 did not show promoter activity (data not shown). Deletions from the 5′ end were made for the −1299 to +145 fragment using exonuclease III treatment (Fig. 4). Transient transfection and subsequent luciferase assays revealed the strongest activity occurred in the construct containing the fragment from −190 to +145 bp (Fig.4). Both the −1299 and the −190 constructs exhibited promoter activity in a variety of cell lines including Cos-7, MCF-7, U937, KCL22, and Jurkat (data not shown). In all of these mammalian cell lines, luciferase activities generated by the −190 construct were higher than those by the −1299 construct. Constructs with a 5′ end containing less than 190 bp upstream of the transcription start site showed a progressive loss of promoter activity. A construct containing bp −37 to +145 showed only 2-fold higher activity than the promoterless vector PGL3-Basic. TATA-less promoters frequently depend on GC boxes to activate transcription (16Lu J. Lee W. Jiang C. Keller E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5391-5402Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Blake M.C. Jambou R.C. Swick A.G. Kahn J.W. Azizkhan J.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 6632-6641Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). One of the main factors binding to these sites are Sp1 family proteins (18Courey A.J. Tjian R. Cell. 1988; 55: 887-898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1079) Google Scholar, 19Kumar A.P. Butler A.P.

Chem. 1995; 270: 24989-24994Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The cyclin A1promoter contains at least six potential GC boxes between 190 and 37 bp upstream of the transcription start site. To analyze the importance of Sp1 for the activity of the cyclin A1 promoter, various promoter constructs were transfected into the Drosophilacell line S2 which lacks endogenous Sp1 and Sp3 (Fig.5). When transfected alone, the activity of all cyclin A1 promoter fragments was not significantly different from the control (Fig. 6,dotted bars). The addition of an Sp1 expression plasmid strongly activated transcription by 15–25-fold from the cyclin A1 promoter (Fig. 5, solid bars). Interestingly, increased transcriptional activity was observed only for constructs containing sequences starting between −1299 and −112 bp upstream of the transcription start site. The construct containing the nucleotide sequences between −37 and +145 did not show any increase in activity, suggesting that Sp1-binding sites between −112 and −37 are essential for Sp1-mediated transcriptional activity of the cyclin A1promoter in Drosophila cells. This region contains four GC boxes that are grouped in two pairs (Fig. 3). To test whether Sp1 and other Sp1 family members could bind to these sites, gel-shift experiments were performed (Fig. 6). Several specific complexes in HeLa cell nuclear extract bound to these sites (lanes 1 and7). These complexes were competed away by an excess of cold oligonucleotides containing either the original site (lanes 2 and 8) or an Sp1 consensus site (lanes 3and 9). A 100-fold excess of a nonspecific oligonucleotide did not alter complex binding (lanes 4 and 10). Supershift experiments with antibody against either Sp1 or Sp3 demonstrated the presence of Sp1 in one complex (lanes 5 and11) and the presence of Sp3 (lanes 6 and12) in two other complexes. The composition of the fastest migrating complex is unknown.Figure 6Gel shift analysis of GC box binding proteins in HeLa nuclear extract. Lanes 1–6 show complexes binding to a 32P-end-labeled oligonucleotide containing GC boxes 1 and 2, and the labeled oligonucleotide in lanes 7–12 contains GC boxes 3 and 4. Lanes 1 and7 show binding of 5 μg of HeLa nuclear extract to the respective oligonucleotide. Binding is competed away in lanes 2 and 8 with a 100-fold excess of cold Sp1 consensus oligonucleotide and in lanes 3 and 9 by a 100-fold excess of cold oligonucleotides using either GC boxes 1 + 2 (lane 3) or GC boxes 3 + 4 (lane 9). A 100-fold excess of a nonspecific oligonucleotide did not compete the specific complexes away (lanes 4 and 10). Antibodies against Sp1 were added to samples in lanes 5 and11 and antibodies against Sp3 were present in reactions forlanes 6 and 12. Identified complexes are marked with an arrow, and the respective protein is named on theleft-hand side of the figure.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The relevance of these GC boxes for promoter activity was further studied by mutational analysis. Point mutations were made in each GC box. Each mutant was tested either alone with the remaining sites unaltered or in combination with the other mutant sites. Luciferase analyses demonstrated that a mutation in either GC box 1 or 2 reduced promoter activity by about 40 and 75%, respectively, whereas a single mutation of either GC box 3 or 4 did not have a major effect on promoter activity (Fig. 7). Mutation of GC box 1 and 2 together decreased promoter activity by 85%. The presence of at least one of the two upstream GC boxes (boxes 3 and 4) being intact was essential for cyclin A1 promoter activity as mutations in both reduced promoter activity by about 80%. Mutations of all four GC boxes reduced activity of the cyclin A1 promoter by 95%. The concentration of cyclins varies during the cell cycle, and one mechanism of their regulation occurs at the transcriptional level (21Muller R. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 173-178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). To analyze cell cycle regulation of promoter activity, transiently transfected cells were arrested in different phases of the cell cycle and were subsequently analyzed for luciferase activity. Cell cycle-regulated activity was found for the full-length promoter as well as for the construct containing the −190 to +145 fragment. The cyclin A1 promoter activity was relatively low during the G0/G1 phase. It increased after the cell cycle progressed beyond the G1/S boundary (Fig.8 A). The highest levels of activity were observed in the S and G2/M phases. Recently, we showed that RNA levels of cyclin A1 accumulated during S phase with the highest levels present at the S and G2/M phases (10Yang R. Muller C. Huynh V. Fung Y.K. Yee A.S. Koeffler H.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 2400-2407Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When transiently transfected HeLa cells were released from an aphidicolin block, luciferase values started to increase after 6 h and reached a maximum after 12–16 h (Fig. 8 B). The maximum promoter activity corresponded to the percentage of cells present in the S and G2/M phases (Fig. 8 C). To define the regions that are relevant for cell cycle regulation of the cyclin A1 promoter, we generated mutations in the presumed E2F sites and the suspected CDE. We also generated by PCR a 3′ deletion construct (−190 + 13) that deleted the two presumed E2F sites downstream of the transcriptional start site. Mutations in these two presumed E2F sites, the mutation in the inverted presumed CDE and the 3′ deletion, showed an indistinguishable pattern of cell cycle regulation when compared with the wild type (Fig.9 and data not shown). Hence, these E2F sites and the inverted CDE are unlikely to play a role in cell cycle regulation of the promoter. Analysis of 5′ deletions and the constructs containing the mutated GC boxes revealed that the four GC boxes are essential for cell cycle regulation (Fig. 9). Interestingly, the activity of the construct containing the mutated GC boxes showed 60% of the activity of the wild type reporter construct in G1 phase. However, the activity of the construct failed to increase when cells entered S phase and showed only 4% of the wild type cyclin A1 promoter activity. Similar data were obtained for the 5′ deletion lacking the four GC boxes (Fig. 9). Cyclin A2 (formerly cyclin A) is ubiquitously expressed in proliferating cells and is required for cell cycle progression (11Carbonaro-Hall D. Williams R. Wu L. Warburton D. Zeichner-David M.

https://openalex.org/W2031654071,"Two cell lines were used for determination of whether interaction occurred between different types of respiration-deficient mitochondria. One was a respiration-deficient ρ− cell line having mutant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) with a 5,196-base pair deletion including five tRNA genes (tRNAGly, Arg, Ser(AGY), Leu(CUN), His), ΔmtDNA5196, causing Kearns-Sayre syndrome. The other was a respiration-deficient syn − cell line having mutant mtDNA with an A to G substitution at 4,269 in the tRNAIle gene, mtDNA4269, causing fatal cardiomyopathy. The occurrence of mitochondrial interaction was examined by determining whether cybrids constructed by fusion of enucleated ρ− cells with syn −cells became respiration competent by exchanging their tRNAs. No cybrids were isolated in selection medium, where only respiration-competent cells could survive, suggesting that no interaction occurred, or that it occurred so slowly that sufficient recovery of mitochondrial respiratory function was not attained by the time of selection. The latter possibility was confirmed by the observations that heteroplasmic cybrids with both mutant mtDNA4269 and ΔmtDNA5196 isolated without selection showed restored mitochondrial respiration activity. This demonstration of transcomplementation between different respiration-deficient mitochondria will help in understanding the relationship between somatic mutant mtDNAs and the roles of such mutations in aging processes.

This demonstration of transcomplementation between different respiration-deficient mitochondria will help in understanding the relationship between somatic mutant mtDNAs and the roles of such mutations in aging processes. In yeast and plant cells, the occurrence of mitochondrial interaction has been suggested by the presence of recombinant mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) 1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; bp, base pair; kbp, kilobase pair.1The abbreviations used are: mtDNA, mitochondrial DNA; bp, base pair; kbp, kilobase pair.molecules from two parental cells (1Dujon B. Slonimski P.P. Weill L. Genetics. 1974; 78: 415-437Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Belliard G. Vadel F. Pelletier G. Nature. 1979; 281: 401-403Crossref Scopus (273) Google Scholar). In mammalian species, however, it has been shown that the mtDNA population is very homoplasmic in a given individual (3Monnat Jr., R.J. Reay D.T. Gene. 1986; 43: 205-211Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 4Kobayashi Y. Momoi M.Y. Tominaga K. Shimoizumi H. Nihei K. Yanagisawa M. Kagawa Y. Ohta S. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1991; 49: 590-599PubMed Google Scholar) probably because of inhibition of the coexistence of mtDNAs from both parents by their strictly maternal inheritance (5Kaneda H. Hayashi J.-I. Takahama S. Taya C. Lindahl K.F. Yonekawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4542-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 6Sitara H. Hayashi J.-I. Takahama S. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Genetics. 1998; 148: 851-857PubMed Google Scholar). For example, sperm-derived mtDNA is selectively and completely eliminated from fertilized mouse eggs before the late pronucleus stage, suggesting that the mtDNA population of all individuals is derived exclusively from the eggs (5Kaneda H. Hayashi J.-I. Takahama S. Taya C. Lindahl K.F. Yonekawa H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4542-4546Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 6Sitara H. Hayashi J.-I. Takahama S. Kaneda H. Yonekawa H. Genetics. 1998; 148: 851-857PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is difficult to prove occurrence of mitochondrial interaction by the presence of recombinant mtDNA molecules in mammalian species because of the difficulty in identification of recombinant molecules between mtDNAs that have very similar sequences, even if mtDNA recombination occurs. However, when cell fusion techniques are applied to mammalian somatic cells, mtDNAs with significant sequence divergences derived from different individuals of the same species or even from those of different species can be coexisted within the same somatic cells, which allow us to examine the occurrence of mtDNA recombination and mitochondrial interaction. Using somatic cell fusion techniques, the occurrence of interaction of the mammalian mitochondrial genetic system was proved in heteroplasmic cells by translational complementation of mitochondrial rRNA between mitochondria with chloramphenicol-sensitive and -resistant mtDNAs (7Oliver N.A. Wallace D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 30-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 8Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and by translational complementation or competition of mitochondrial tRNAs between mitochondria with wild-type and pathogenic deletion mutant mtDNAs (8Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 9Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), although extensive recombination was not observed in heteroplasmic cells with rat mtDNAs or rat and mouse mtDNAs (10Hayashi J.-I. Tagashira Y. Yoshida M.C. Exp. Cell. Res. 1985; 160: 387-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Subsequently, we found rapid penetration of HeLa mtDNA and/or its products into mitochondria of mtDNA-less (ρ0) HeLa cells in cybrids isolated by the fusion of enucleated HeLa cells with ρ0 HeLa cells (11Hayashi J.-I. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). A recent contradictory report proposed that there is no mitochondrial interaction between distinct organelles derived from different cells, because the coexistence of mitochondria containing different pathogenic mutant mtDNAs derived from different patients in single cells did not restore reduced mitochondrial respiratory function (12Yoneda M. Miyatake T. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2699-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). On the other hand, we found convincing evidence for the presence of interaction between mitochondria originating from different cell lines (8Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). We constructed cybrids by introducing chloramphenicol-resistant HeLa mitochondria into cells with respiration-deficient ρ− mitochondria containing deletion mutant mtDNA (ΔmtDNA5196) with a 5,196-base pair deletion including five tRNA genes and seven structural genes derived from a patient with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (9Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar) and found that fusion genes newly formed around the deletion break point in ΔmtDNA5196 could be translated even in the presence of chloramphenicol with the help of both chloramphenicol-resistant rRNA and five kinds of tRNAs lacking in ρ− mitochondria transcribed from HeLa mtDNA. The apparent discrepancy on the presence or absence of mitochondrial interaction might be explained by supposing that there is no interaction when different types of respiration-deficient mitochondria coexist in the same cells, probably because of lack of sufficient energy supply from respiration-deficient mitochondria required for mitochondrial fusion, subsequent mixing of their contents, and peptide synthesis. In this study, we examined this possibility by isolating cells withsyn − mitochondria, which are respiration-deficient because of pathogenic mutant mtDNA with a point mutation in the tRNAIle gene at 4,269 derived from a patient with fatal cardiomyopathy (13Taniike M. Fukushima H. Yanagihara I. Tsukamoto H. Tanaka J. Fujimura H. Nagai T. Sano T. Yamaoka K. Inui K. Okada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Chem. 1994; 269: 19060-19066Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and then creating a chance for interaction between syn − mitochondria and ρ− mitochondria. In this combination, because fusion peptides were exclusively encoded by ΔmtDNA5196, whereas ATP8, ATP6, COIII ND3, ND4L, ND4, and ND5 were exclusively encoded by mtDNA4269, the interaction could be unambiguously proved by identification of these peptides. The results suggested the occurrence of mitochondrial interaction even between distinct respiration-deficient organelles with different types of pathogenic mutant mtDNAs derived from patients with different mitochondrial diseases. Respiration-deficient ρ− H5 cells (8Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) contain only mutant ΔmtDNA5196 with a large-scale deletion from nucleotide positions 8,563 to 13,758 including seven structural genes and five tRNA genes, which was derived from a patient with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (9Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Respiration-deficient syn − CM114a and normal CM1-9 cells were isolated by the fusion of ρ0 HeLa cells with enucleated fibroblasts from a patient with fatal cardiomyopathy (13Taniike M. Fukushima H. Yanagihara I. Tsukamoto H. Tanaka J. Fujimura H. Nagai T. Sano T. Yamaoka K. Inui K. Okada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Therefore, the nuclear genomes of CM114a and CM1-9 clones were from HeLa cells, and mtDNAs were from the patient. CM114a cells contain only mutant mtDNA with an A to G substitution at 4,269 in tRNAIle gene, mtDNA4269, whereas CM1-9 cells possessed predominantly wild-type mtDNA from the patient. As these respiration-deficient cell lines are auxotrophic for uridine and pyruvate, cells were grown in medium (RPMI 1640 + pyruvate (0.1 mg/ml) + uridine (50 μg/ml) + 10% fetal bovine serum). Intercellular transfer of mtDNA was carried out as described previously (8Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) by fusion of enucleated H5 cells with CM114a cells in the presence of polyethylene glycol 1500 (Boehringer Mannheim). For identification and determination of the content of ΔmtDNA5196, total DNA (2 μg) extracted from 2 × 105 cells was digested with XhoI, and the fragments were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. After blotting onto a NYTRAN membrane, the DNA fragments were hybridized with [α-32P]dATP-labeled HeLa mtDNA. The radioactivities of the fragments were measured with a BAS2000 instrument (Fuji Photo Film, Tokyo). The mutant mtDNA4269 was identified by the mismatch polymerase chain reaction method as described previously (13Taniike M. Fukushima H. Yanagihara I. Tsukamoto H. Tanaka J. Fujimura H. Nagai T. Sano T. Yamaoka K. Inui K. Okada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). The products digested with SspI were separated by 4% agarose X (Wako, Tokyo) gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethidium bromide. Analysis of mitochondrial translation products labeled with [35S]methionine was carried out as described previously (8Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c oxidase activity was measured as the rate of cyanide-sensitive oxidation of reduced cytochromec as described before (15Miyabayashi S. Narisawa K. Iinuma K. Tada K. Sakai K. Kobayashi K. Kobayashi Y. Morinaga S. Brain Dev. 1984; 6: 362-372Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). We examined mitochondrial interaction by isolation of cybrids using the nutritional requirements of two different types of respiration-deficient cell lines as parental cells. One was ρ− H5 cells (8Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), which are respiration-deficient because of a large-scale deletion mutant ΔmtDNA5196 derived from a patient with Kearns-Sayre syndrome (9Hayashi J.-I.

The other wassyn − CM114a cells, which are respiration-deficient because of mutant mtDNA4269 (13Taniike M. Fukushima H. Yanagihara I. Tsukamoto H. Tanaka J. Fujimura H. Nagai T. Sano T. Yamaoka K. Inui K. Okada S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 186: 47-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar) derived from a patient with fatal cardiomyopathy. The CM114a cells without mitochondrial translation activity (Fig.1) were isolated by repeated recloning of CM114 cells that showed slight translation activity (14Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kagawa Y.

These two lines are auxotrophic for pyruvate and uridine because of the complete absence of oxidative phosphorylation activity in their mitochondria (8Takai D. Inoue K. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Hayashi J.-I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 6028-6033Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,14Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kagawa Y. Takai D. Miyabayashi S. Tada K. Fukushima H.

If mitochondrial interaction occurs between the respiration-deficient ρ− and syn − mitochondria, mitochondrial respiratory function should be restored by their coexistence in a cell, because the missing five tRNAs in the ρ− mitochondria and the missing wild-type tRNAIle in the syn − mitochondria should be supplemented by the syn − and ρ− mitochondria, respectively. Becausesyn − CM114a cells are resistant to 6-thioguanine, the coexistence of syn − CM114a mitochondria and ρ− H5 mitochondria could be attained by the fusion of enucleated H5 cells with CM114a cells followed by selection in medium with 6-thioguanine but without pyruvate and uridine. In this nutrition-deficient selection medium, only cybrids,i.e. CM114a cells that had acquired respiration competence by introduction of exogenous ρ− H5 mitochondria, could survive. The results showed that no colonies grew in this selective medium, suggesting that the cybrids were not respiration competent, possibly because of the absence of mitochondrial interaction betweensyn − and ρ− mitochondria. However, the failure to isolate cybrids by nutritional selection could not necessarily be direct evidence for the absence of interaction. For example, our results did not completely exclude the possibility that transcomplementation between syn − and ρ− mitochondria occurred very slowly because of the absence of an energy supply necessary for rapid interaction, and so sufficient restoration of mitochondrial translation by transcomplementation was not accomplished by the time of nutritional selection that exclude respiration deficient cells. For examination of this possibility, cybrids with both syn − and ρ− mitochondria must be isolated to study whether restoration of mitochondrial respiratory function could be attained in the heteroplasmic cybrids during prolonged cultivation after fusion. However, we could not use effective selection to remove host CM114a cells from fusion mixtures of CM114a cells and enucleated H5 cells (Table I). As selection with 6-thioguanine was incomplete and could exclude only parental H5 cells, most of the colonies that grew in the selective medium would be either the host CM114a cells without ρ− mitochondria or cybrids, i.e. CM114a cells with imported ρ−mitochondria.Table ISomatic cell genetic characteristics of parent cells and their cybrid clonesCell lineDrug resistanceΔmtDNA5196 content%Parent cell linemtDNA donor line H56-thioguanine-sensitive100mtDNA recipient line CM114a6-thioguanine-resistant0Cybrid clone0A4608B3188B3 subclones8B3-1558B3-2488B3-3408B3-4548B3-553 Open table in a new tab Therefore, on day 14–20 after fusion, we picked up 98 growing colonies randomly without using nutritional selection to exclude respiration-deficient cells and analyzed their mtDNA compositions to find cybrid clones. Most of these colonies did not contain even a slight amount of ΔmtDNA5196, and both parental mtDNAs were detectable only in 2 of 98 clones, suggesting that two heteroplasmic clones, named 0A4 and 8B3, were cybrids but that the others were parental CM114a cells. Cybrid clone 0A4 had 60% ΔmtDNA5196 imported from ρ− H5 cells, whereas cybrid clone 8B3 had 18% ΔmtDNA5196, the remaining mtDNA being host mtDNA4269 (Fig. 1 and Table I). Thus, the coexistence of respiration-deficient syn − and ρ− mitochondria was attained in these cybrid clones. Then, by [35S]methionine labeling we examined whether mitochondrial translation activity was restored in these cybrid clones. Fig. 1 shows that mitochondrial translation activity was observed in 0A4 cybrids with 60% ΔmtDNA5196, but not in 8B3 cybrids with 18% ΔmtDNA5196. The apparent discrepancy on the presence or absence of mitochondrial translation activity in cybrid clones 0A4 and 8B3 could be explained by supposing that the 8B3 clone was not a cybrid clone but was derived from parental CM114a cells contaminated with H5 cells. Such contamination could occur, if we had failed to isolate a single clone, and some H5 cells, which happen to survive in the presence of 6-thioguanine during the selection period (14–20 days), were included in the cell population of CM114a line, although we confirmed before fusion that 6-thioguanine killed all parental H5 cells during the 14-day cultivation period. For examination of this possibility, five subclones were isolated from the 8B3 clone by recloning, and their mtDNA compositions were studied. As shown in Fig. 2, A andB, all the subclones had both mutant mtDNA4269 and ΔmtDNA5196, suggesting that the 8B3 cells were not a simple mixture of the parental CM114a and H5 cells, but were heteroplasmic cybrids with both syn − and ρ− mitochondria. However, during cultivation for about 30 passages for isolation and examination of subclones, the amounts of ΔmtDNA5196 in all the subclones progressively increased to 40–55%. Considering that the amount of ΔmtDNA5196 in the original 8B3 clone was 18% (Fig. 1 A and Table I), its increase was not because of random segregation but to a propagational advantage of ΔmtDNA5196 of smaller size than mutant mtDNA4269. These observations are consistent with our previous observations that ΔmtDNA5196 was propagated preferentially over wild-type mtDNA in following generations of cybrids (9Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Then, we examined the activities of mitochondrial translation and respiratory enzymes in these subclones. All subclones showed mitochondrial translation and cytochrome c oxidase activities restored to 40–70% of those of cybrids repopulated with wild-type mtDNA (Figs. 2 and 3), suggesting the occurrence of interaction betweensyn − and ρ− mitochondria.Figure 3Quantitative analyses of restoration of mitochondrial respiratory function in cybrid clones. CM1-9, CM114a, and H5 are clones predominantly containing wild-type mtDNA, mtDNA4269, and ΔmtDNA5196, respectively. Clone 0A4 is a cybrid clone, and clones 8B3-3 and 8B3-4 are subclones isolated from the cybrid clone 8B3 by recloning.

As ΔmtDNA5196 had lost seven structural genes but gained new fusion genes because of 5,196-bp deletion with a break point between 8,563 and 13,758 (9Hayashi J.-I. Ohta S. Kikuchi A. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 10614-10618Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar), these results suggest the recoveries of gene expressions of both ΔmtDNA5196 and mtDNA4269 by their coexistence in the cybrids. Thus, these observations provided unambiguous evidence for the presence of complementation between different types of respiration-deficient mitochondria. There seem to be two possible explanations for the apparent discrepancy between the findings that all subclones showed restored mitochondrial translation activity, whereas the original cybrid clone 8B3 did not (Figs. 1 and 2). One is that interaction did occur in clone 8B3, but that the amount of ΔmtDNA5196 (18%) was not enough to provide sufficient normal tRNAIle for restoring mitochondrial translation activity in syn −mitochondria. The other is that interaction occurred, but that a long expression time was required to restore mitochondrial translation activity particularly between respiration-deficient mitochondria. Because it seems impossible to keep the amount of ΔmtDNA5196 at lower levels because of its propagational advantage over mtDNA of normal size, other mtDNA with a pathogenic point mutation, that is expected to be neutral with respect to propagational advantage, must be used to examine the above possibility. The discrepancy with respect to the presence (this study) and absence (12Yoneda M. Miyatake T. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2699-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar) of interaction between respiration-deficient mitochondria and our inconsistent findings that cybrids were not isolated in selective medium, whereas heteroplasmic cybrids with syn −and ρ− mitochondria restored mitochondrial respiratory function might also be explained by supposing as follows: a long expression time is required to restore mitochondrial respiratory function in cybrids isolated by the fusion ofsyn − cells with enucleated ρ−cells, or the amount of exogenously imported mtDNA required to restore respiration deficiency in host cells might be limited to about 40–60%, particularly when imported mtDNA is not wild-type but possesses a different type of pathogenic mutation. It is also possible that the different types of pathogenic mtDNA mutations used in the complementation assay allows for a different conclusion. We are testing these possibilities by isolating cybrids with the same pathogenic mtDNA mutations as those used by Yoneda et al. (12Yoneda M. Miyatake T. Attardi G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 2699-2712Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). In any case, this study showed the occurrence of interaction even between different types of respiration-deficient mitochondria and provided two important aspects of mitochondrial biogenesis. One was the individuality of each mitochondrion within a cell. Mammalian cells have been thought to contain hundreds of independent mitochondria (16Clayton D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1984; 53: 537-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). However, our previous observations provided the totally different view that in living cells mitochondria function as a single dynamic cellular unit, indicating that they lose individuality (11Hayashi J.-I. Takemitsu M. Goto Y. Nonaka I. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 43-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In this study, we again provided convincing evidence to support this idea by showing the presence of transcomplementation between respiration-deficient mitochondria originated from different cell types. The other important aspect of mitochondrial biogenesis provided from our findings was with respect to the relationship between age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction and age-associated accumulation of somatic mutations in mtDNA. It is generally thought that somatic mutations are more likely to accumulate in mtDNA than in nuclear DNA, because mtDNA is a target of most carcinogens and mutagens and is continuously exposed to oxygen-free radicals produced in mitochondria (17Shay J.W. Werbin H. Mutat. Res. 1987; 186: 149-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 18Linnane A.W. Marzuki S. Ozawa T. Tanaka M. Lancet. 1989; 1: 642-645Abstract PubMed Scopus (1065) Google Scholar, 19Wallace D.C. Science. 1992; 256: 628-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (1112) Google Scholar). If there were no mitochondrial interaction, it would be much easier to induce reduction of mitochondrial respiratory function by progressive accumulation of somatic mtDNA mutations during aging, particularly in postmitotic oxidative tissues, such as brain and muscles (20Soong N.W. Hinton D.R. Cortopassi G. Arnheim N. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar, 21Corral-Debrinski M. Horton T. Lott M.T. Shoffner J.M. Flint Beal M. Wallace D.C. Nat. Genet. 1992; 2: 324-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar). On the other hand, if transcomplementation occurred continuously, mitochondrial respiration activity could be maintained without significant reduction, even when various kinds of somatic mutant mtDNAs were accumulated. In fact, we recently found that mtDNA in autopsied brain tissues from aged subjects could be rescued in ρ0 HeLa cells by fusion of brain synaptosomal fractions with ρ0 HeLa cells, and that this mtDNA transfer resulted in complete restoration of mitochondrial respiratory function, even though the brain tissues and their cybrids possessed mtDNAs with various pathogenic mutations, suggesting functional integrity of the brain mtDNA from aged subjects (22Ito S. Ohta S. Nishimaki K. Kagawa S. Miyazaki R. Kuno S.-y. Komatsuzaki Y. Mizusawa M. Hayashi J.-I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 46: 2099-2103Crossref Scopus (76) Google Scholar). These observations can be explained by occurrence of transcomplementation between mitochondria. Thus, even though somatic mutations are more likely to accumulate in mtDNA than in nuclear DNA, the occurrence of transcomplementation between mitochondria could provide stable respiratory function in cells during aging."

The enzyme has been solubilized with Triton X-100 and purified 80-fold. As shown by co-purification and thermal inactivation studies, the 4′-phosphatase catalyzes not only the hydrolysis of (Kdo)2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA but also the transfer the 4′-phosphate of Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA to the inositol headgroup of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) to generate PtdIns-4-P. Like the 4′-phosphatase, the phosphotransferase activity is not present in Escherichia coli, Rhizobium meliloti, or the nodulation-defective mutant 24AR of R. leguminosarum. The specific activity for the phosphotransferase reaction is about 2 times higher than that of the 4′-phosphatase. The phosphotransferase assay conditions are similar to those used for PtdIns kinases, except that ATP and Mg2+ are omitted. The apparent K m for PtdIns is ∼500 μm versus 20–100 μm for most PtdIns kinases, but the phosphotransferase specific activity in crude cell extracts is higher than that of most PtdIns kinases. The phosphotransferase is absolutely specific for the 4-position of PtdIns and is highly selective for PtdIns as the acceptor. The 4′-phosphatase/phosphotransferase can be eluted from heparin- or Cibacron blue-agarose with PtdIns. A phosphoenzyme intermediate may account for the dual function of this enzyme, since a single32P-labeled protein species (M r∼68,000) can be trapped and visualized by SDS gel electrophoresis of enzyme preparations incubated with Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA. Although PtdIns is not detected in cultures of R. leguminosarum/etli(CE3), PtdIns may be synthesized during nodulation or supplied by plant membranes, given that soybean PtdIns is an excellent phosphate acceptor.

Many additional enzymes unique to R. leguminosarum remain to be found. We now report a novel, chemically specific and highly active phosphotransferase reaction associated with the 4′-phosphatase ofR. leguminosarum (CE3) (Fig. 1 B). In the presence of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), the 4′-phosphatase can transfer the 4′-phosphate of Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (and related metabolites including E. colilipid A) to the inositol moiety of PtdIns, generating exclusively PtdIns-4-P (Fig. 1 B). The phosphotransferase and the previously described 4′-phosphatase activity (30Price N.J.P. Jeyaretnam B. Carlson R.W. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. Brozek K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7352-7356Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) appear to be catalyzed by the same enzyme, given their identical behavior during purification and thermal inactivation. Although the apparent K m of the phosphotransferase for PtdIns is about 10 times higher than that of many eucaryotic PtdIns 4-kinases (35Porter F.D. Li Y.S. Deuel T.F. J. Biol.

A procaryotic pathway for the biosynthesis of PtdIns-4-P and a direct connection between lipid A formation and PtdIns phosphorylation have not been reported previously. [γ-32P]ATP was obtained from NEN Life Science Products. Ptd-[2-3H]Ins-4-P and [1,2-3H]Ins were purchased from American Radiolabeled Chemicals, Inc.

All Rhizobium strains were grown at 30 °C on TY medium, which contains 5 g/liter tryptone, 3 g/liter yeast extract, 10 mm CaCl2, and 20 μg/ml nalidixic acid. For the growth of strains CE3, 24AR, 1021, and 8401, streptomycin (200 μg/ml) was also added to the medium. E. coli W3110 was grown on LB broth (39Miller J.R. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar) at 30 °C. The substrate [4′-32P]lipid IVA was generated using [γ-32P]ATP, tetraacyldisaccharide 1-phosphate acceptor (DS-1-P) (40Radika K. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14859-14867Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and membranes of E. coli BLR(DE3)/pLysS/pJK2, which contain large amounts of the 4′-kinase (41Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA could then be prepared from the [4′-32P]lipid IVA using the purified Kdo transferase (38Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 42Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was also prepared directly from DS-1-P and [γ-32P]ATP without purification of the [4′-32P]lipid IVAintermediate. Briefly, a 100-μCi portion of [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) was dried in a 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tube under a stream of N2. Next, the following components were added: (a) 25 μl of a mixture of DS-1-P and cardiolipin, prepared by mixing 0.5 mg of DS-1-P and 4 mg of cardiolipin in 1 ml of water, followed by ultrasonic dispersion; (b) 5 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, a nonionic detergent; and (c) 10 μl of 25 mmMgCl2. The 4′-kinase reaction was started by adding 5 μl of membranes (500 μg/ml in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5) ofE. coli strain BLR(DE3)/pLysS/pJK2 and was held at room temperature. After 10 min, a second 5-μl portion of the enzyme stock was added, and the incubation was continued for another 10 min. The Kdo transferase reaction was then carried out in the same tube by adding the following: 2 μl of 5 mm lipid IVA, 25 μl of 2% Triton X-100, 50 μl of 100 mm CTP in 0.5m Hepes, pH 7.5, 50 μl of 40 mm Kdo, 50 μl of 100 mm MgCl2, 50 μl of purified CMP-Kdo synthase (0.03 total units) (42Brozek K.A. Hosaka K. Robertson A.D. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6956-6966Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Goldman R.C. Kohlbrenner W.E. J. Bacteriol. 1985; 163: 256-261Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and 25 μl of purified Kdo transferase (38Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9988-9997Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (from a stock solution at 80 μg/ml). The final reaction volume was 500 μl. After incubation at 30 °C for 30 min, 80–90% of the [γ-32P]ATP was incorporated into the Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, as judged by analytical thin layer chromatography and autoradiography. Next, the reaction mixture was carefully spotted across the origin of a 20 × 20-cm silica gel 60 thin layer plate. The plate was dried under a cold air stream and developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:1, v/v/v/v). The plate was again dried under a cold air stream and exposed to x-ray film for 30–60 s to locate the Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA band. The appropriate region was scraped and transferred to a 30-ml sintered glass filter funnel. The silica powder was washed with 10 ml of chloroform, and the 32P-labeled product was then eluted with 24 ml of a single phase Bligh-Dyer mixture (44Bligh E.G. Dyer J.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (41848) Google Scholar), consisting of CHCl3/methanol/50 mmammonium acetate in water adjusted to pH 1.5 with HCl (1:2:0.8, v/v/v). Three 8-ml fractions were collected in glass tubes. CHCl3(2.1 ml) and 50 mm ammonium acetate in water adjusted to pH 1.5 with HCl (2.1 ml) were added to each 8-ml fraction to form three two-phase systems. The lower phases were removed with a Pasteur pipette and pooled into a single 15-ml Corex glass tube equipped with a Teflon cap. Six drops of HPLC grade pyridine were added, and the solution was dried under a stream of N2 at room temperature. While the drying was in progress, two additional extractions of the remaining three upper phases were carried to optimize product recovery. Each upper phase was extracted twice with 2 ml of a fresh lower phase from a pre-equilibrated two-phase Bligh-Dyer system, consisting of CHCl3/methanol/50 mm ammonium acetate in water adjusted to pH 1.5 with HCl (1:1:0.9, v/v/v). The lower phases derived from these additional extractions were pooled into the same 15-ml Corex tube used for the initial lower phases, and the resulting solution was again dried under a stream of N2. The final dried Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVApreparation was dissolved in 2 ml of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v) with vortexing and sonic irradiation, and the material was divided equally among four 1.5-ml polypropylene microcentrifuge tubes. These aliquots were dried immediately under a stream of N2. Additional residual Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was recovered by washing the Corex tube two more times with 2-ml portions of CHCl3/MeOH (1:1, v/v) and distributing the solution equally among the four microcentrifuge tubes. Following the final drying under N2, the four portions of Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA were each suspended by sonic irradiation in 500 μl of 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmEGTA, and they were stored at −20 °C. The entire extraction process took about 5 h. A typical final yield of Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (specific activity ∼8 μCi/nmol) following these extractions was ∼30% of the input [γ-32P]ATP. Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA was prepared with the monofunctional Kdo transferase from Hemophilus influenzae(45White K.A. Kaltashov I.A. Cotter R.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16555-16563Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The substrate [4′-32P]lipid A was prepared from compound 505 by the action of the highly overexpressed 4′-kinase (41Garrett T.A. Kadrmas J.L. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21855-21864Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). The [4′-32P]lipid IVA, Kdo-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, and [4′-32P]lipid A were purified by thin layer chromatography (38Belunis C.J. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol.

These substances were stored as aqueous dispersions at −20 °C in 10 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.8, containing 1 mm EDTA and 1 mmEGTA. Prior to use, all of the substrates were dispersed again by sonic irradiation for 1 min in a bath sonicator. Standard assay conditions for the 4′-phosphatase were as follows. The reaction mixture (10–20 μl) contained 50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.1% Triton X-100, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 2 mm EDTA, 10 mm potassium phosphate, and 10 μmKdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA (20,000 cpm/nmol). PtdIns (usually 1 mg/ml or at the indicated concentrations) was added as the acceptor substrate in the phosphotransferase reactions. When PtdIns was included as the phosphate acceptor, a 1-μl solution of PtdIns in chloroform/methanol (4:1, v/v) was transferred to each reaction tube, and the solvent was removed with a stream of N2. Next, the Triton X-100 and the other reaction components were added. The reaction mixture was subjected to sonic irradiation to disperse the phospholipids into the detergent-containing buffer. Reactions were initiated with enzyme. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 15 min or as indicated. Reactions were terminated by spotting 2-μl samples onto a silica gel 60 thin layer chromatography plate, which was developed in the solvent chloroform/pyridine/88% formic acid/water (30:70:16:10; v/v/v/v). The remaining Kdo2-[4′-32P]lipid IVA, the 32Pi, and the PtdIns-4-32P were quantified on the plate using a Molecular Dynamics model 425S PhosphorImager, equipped with ImageQuant software. The percentage conversion of substrate to product(s) was calculated for each reaction, and the specific activities were expressed as nmol/min/mg, as indicated. All enzyme preparations were carried out at 0–4 °C. Protein was determined by the bicinchoninic acid method (46Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18349) Google Scholar), using bovine serum albumin as a standard. R. leguminosarum CE3 cells in late logarithmic phase (A 550 = 1.2–1.4) were harvested from 5 liters of culture by centrifugation (8000 × g, 15 min) and resuspended in 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, to give a final protein concentration of 8–10 mg/ml. Cells were broken by two passages through a French pressure cell at 18,000 p.s.i., and the debris was removed by centrifugation at 8000 × g for 15 min. Membranes were prepared by ultracentrifugation at 149,000 × g for 60 min. The membrane pellet was resuspended in Buffer A (50 mmHepes, pH 7.5, 3% glycerol, and 10 mm potassium phosphate) at ∼4–5 mg/ml. Solubilization was carried out by the addition of 10% Triton X-100 (reduced) to yield a protein:detergent ratio of 1:2 (∼0.9% final detergent concentration), followed by stirring for 2 h, and centrifugation at 149,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant, which contained over 95% of both activities, was collected and stored at −80 °C. Next, a Q-Sepharose (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) column (30 ml) was equilibrated with Buffer B (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 0.15% Triton X-100 (reduced), 2 mm EDTA, 3% glycerol, and 10 mm potassium phosphate). Solubilized membranes (30 ml, 3.1 mg/ml protein) were loaded onto the column. Unbound proteins were washed out with Buffer C (50 mm MES, pH 6.5, 0.15% reduced Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 3% glycerol, and 10 mm potassium phosphate containing 100 mm NaCl) until A 280 returned to base line. Elution was carried out with a 400-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.0 mNaCl in Buffer C. The column fractions (8 ml) were assayed for the 4′-phosphotransferase and 4′-phosphatase. The active fractions (∼80 ml total volume) were pooled, desalted, and concentrated (∼3-fold) by ultrafiltration through an Amicon (30K) filter. The concentrated material was then diluted to the original volume with Buffer C containing no detergent. The cycle was repeated three times. The final concentrated active fractions (∼25 ml) from the Q-Sepharose column were then loaded onto a heparin-agarose Type 1 (Sigma) column (15 ml) equilibrated with Buffer C. Next, the column was washed with equilibration buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. The 4′-phosphatase/phosphotransferase activities were eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient from 0.1 to 1.5 m NaCl in Buffer C. The column fractions (5 ml) were assayed for both the phosphotransferase and the 4′-phosphatase. The active fractions were pooled, concentrated (3 fold), and desalted as above. A Cibacron blue 3GA Type 300 (Sigma) column (3 ml) was equilibrated with Buffer C (see above). Partially purified enzyme from the heparin-agarose step (5 ml, 0.3 mg/ml protein) was loaded onto the column and was recirculated through the column two more times. The column was then washed successively with 5 ml of Buffer C, 15 ml of Buffer C containing 0.5 m NaCl, 15 ml of Buffer C containing 0.5% Triton X-100 (reduced), and 10 ml of Buffer C. Finally, the elution of the 4′-phosphatase/phosphotransferase was carried out with 35 ml of Buffer C containing 0.4 mg/ml PtdIns and 0.2m NaCl. The column fractions (2.5 ml) were assayed for both the phosphotransferase and the 4′-phosphatase activities. R. leguminosarum (CE3) membranes were separated by isopycnic sucrose gradient centrifugation as described previously (33Kadrmas J.L. Brozek K.A. Raetz C.R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32119-32125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The turbidity (A 600) of each fraction was determined to confirm the presence of membrane fragments, and each fraction was assayed for NADH oxidase as the inner membrane marker and phospholipase A as the outer membrane marker (33Kadrmas J.L.

https://openalex.org/W2003636865,"Protease inhibitor 10 (PI-10), an intracellular ovalbumin-serpin, contains a series of basic amino acids in the loop between helices C and D that exhibit homology to known nuclear targeting signals. Transfection of HeLa cells with plasmids encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coupled to PI-10 revealed an intense fluorescence of the nucleus. Immunoblotting demonstrated a single M r 80,000 EGFP·PI-10 complex in isolated nuclei. Mutation of four basic amino acids in the interhelical loop to alanines (i.e. K74A, K75A, R76A, K77A) resulted in the fluorescent complex being confined to the cytoplasm. Further evidence for a nuclear targeting signal in this region was provided by localization of the fluorescent label to the nucleus in cells transfected with a plasmid encoding EGFP fused to the 25 amino acids comprising the interhelical loop of PI-10 (i.e. Arg-63 to Glu-87), whereas a cytoplasmic distribution was noted for the construct encoding EGFP coupled to the mutated interhelical loop. These data raise the possibility that PI-10 may play a role in regulating protease activity within the nucleus, a property unique in the field of serpin biology."

Gaining an understanding of how BDNF, via the tropomyosin-related kinase B (TRKB) receptor, elicits specific cellular responses is of contemporary interest. Expression of mutant TrkB in fibroblasts, where tyrosine 484 was changed to phenylalanine, abrogated Shc association with TrkB, but only attenuated and did not block BDNF-induced phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). This suggests there is another BDNF-induced signaling mechanism for activating MAPK, which compelled a search for other TrkB substrates. BDNF induces phosphorylation of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 (FRS2) in both fibroblasts engineered to express TrkB and human neuroblastoma (NB) cells that naturally express TrkB. Additionally, BDNF induces phosphorylation of FRS2 in primary cultures of cortical neurons, thus showing that FRS2 is a physiologically relevant substrate of TrkB. Data are presented demonstrating that BDNF induces association of FRS2 with growth factor receptor-binding protein 2 (GRB2) in cortical neurons, fibroblasts, and NB cells, which in turn could activate the RAS/MAPK pathway. This is not dependent on Shc, since BDNF does not induce association of Shc and FRS2.

A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar), whereas EGF treatment induces mitogenesis (17Huff K. End D. Guroff G. J. Cell Biol. 1981; 88: 189-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Paradoxically, both NGF and EGF activate shared signaling pathways requiring RAS and PLC-γ1. Activation of a growth factor-specific pathway by NGF is a possible explanation for this quandary. Indeed, there is evidence that NGF may activate a neurotrophin-specific pathway requiring SNT (18Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar, 19Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). SNT is a protein that is phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to NGF treatment of PC12 cells. Another explanation for this dilemma could be that NGF induces a more prolonged activation of the MAPK pathway than EGF in PC12 cells (20Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). Sustained activation of MAPKs by NGF, compared with EGF, in PC12 cells results in increased MAPK nuclear localization (20Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). Prolonged activation and consequential nuclear localization of MAPK could result in the sustained phosphorylation of transcription factors including cyclic AMP response element-binding protein (21Segal R.A. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1996; 19: 463-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 22Finkbeiner S. Tavazoie S.F. Maloratsky A. Jacobs K.M. Harris K.M. Greenberg M.E. Neuron. 1997; 19: 1031-1047Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (765) Google Scholar). Thus, NGF could activate both immediate early genes and delayed response genes, whereas EGF may activate only a subset of these genes, in PC12 cells. NGF induces phosphorylation of tyrosine 490 of Trk, which forms a binding site for the PTB domain (23van der Geer P. Wiley S. Lai V.K.-M. Olivier J.P. Gish G.D. Stephens R. Kaplan D. Shoelson S. Pawson T. Curr. Biol. 1995; 5: 404-412Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar) of Shc (24Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 25Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). Trk association with and phosphorylation of Shc leads to RAS activation by NGF. Trk could promote prolonged RAS/MAPK pathway activation by prolonged association with Shc. There is some persuasive evidence that the NGF-induced phosphorylated state of the phosphotyrosine motif that Shc binds to in human TRK, Y490, is long-lived (26Segal R.A. Bhattacharyya A. Rua L.A. Alberta J.A. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20175-20181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This might explain sustained MAPK activation by NGF. However, this explanation still needs to be reconciled with other data indicating that TRK is internalized rapidly following ligand binding (27Jing S. Tapley P. Barbacid M. Neuron. 1992; 9: 1067-1079Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). An alternative possibility is that neurotrophins activate other pathways leading to MAPK activation. Combined stimulation by several pathways might result in an increased temporal duration of MAPK activation.In this report, we describe our finding that mutation of Tyr-484 of TrkB abrogated BDNF-dependent Shc association with TrkB, but only attenuated and did not block MAPK phosphorylation. These data show that there must be another pathway activated by BDNF leading to MAPK phosphorylation. These findings compelled a search for other BDNF signaling pathways. FRS2, which is a new substrate for the FGF receptor, was recently cloned (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). FGF induces phosphorylation of FRS2 and the formation of a complex containing FRS2, Grb2, and Sos. This leads to activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. In this research, we have addressed whether FRS2 is a substrate for TrkB and might be required for a second BDNF signaling pathway leading to MAPK activation. We demonstrate for the first time that, in response to BDNF, FRS2 is phosphorylated on tyrosine. This leads to FRS2 association with Grb2 in both cell lines and, more important, cortical neurons in primary culture. This suggests that there is a physiologically relevant signaling pathway leading to MAPK activation by BDNF that requires FRS2 and is independent of Shc.DISCUSSIONThe data reported here provide evidence that BDNF activates at least two signaling pathways, via TrkB, that lead to phosphorylation of MAPK. Multiple neurotrophin signaling pathways leading to MAPK activation may underlie the observed sustained activation of MAPK induced, for example, by NGF (20Marshall C.J. Cell. 1995; 80: 179-185Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4223) Google Scholar). This has generated a hypothesis that we are now testing. BDNF may activate two or more pathways that lead to sustained MAPK activation. A previously established pathway requires Shc. The data in this report provide evidence for another pathway requiring FRS2/SNT. Phosphorylation of Shc leads to formation of a ternary complex containing Shc, Grb2, and Sos, which in turn leads to RAS activation (37Basu T. Warne P.H. Downward J. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3483-3491PubMed Google Scholar, 38Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). FGF induces phosphorylation of FRS2 and formation of a complex with Grb2, which could lead to RAS activation (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar, 39Ong S.H. Goh K.C. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Klint P. Claesson-Welsh L. Cao X. Tan Y.H. Guy G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 225: 1021-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). In this report, we have shown that BDNF induces tyrosine phosphorylation and the formation of a complex containing Grb2 and FRS2. This is likely to lead to MAPK activation. The combined activation of these pathways may lead to sustained activation of the MAPK pathway by BDNF. It remains to be determined whether there are kinetic differences in the activation of MAPK by these various pathways. The data presented here indicate that abrogation of Shc interaction with tyrosine 484 of TrkB in fibroblasts results in a rapid and short-lived activation of MAPK, which suggests Shc may be required for a more prolonged activation of MAPK. A putative role for Shc in the prolonged activation of MAPK by neurotrophins is consistent with the observation by Segal et al. (26Segal R.A. Bhattacharyya A. Rua L.A. Alberta J.A. Stephens R.M. Kaplan D.R. Stiles C.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 20175-20181Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) that the phosphorylated state of tyrosine 490 of Trk may be long-lived. Tyrosine 490 is the binding site for Shc in Trk and is homologous to tyrosine 484 in TrkB. It will be important to determine whether other signaling pathways, perhaps requiring FRS2/SNT or other adapter proteins, contribute to sustained activation of the MAPK pathway.There may be other signaling pathways leading to MAPK signaling activated by BDNF. rAPS and SH2-B are substrates of the TRK family receptors, including TrkB, which were identified recently by Qianet al.(40). rAPS is a putative adapter protein containing a pleckstrin homology domain and a Src homology 2 domain. SH2-B is a putative adapter protein containing a Src homology 2 domain. Both rAPS and SH2-B, when transfected into 293 cells along with Trk, enhanced NGF-mediated activation of MAPK. It also seems likely that the cellular background will have a role in MAPK activation by neurotrophins. Perhaps BDNF utilizes various subsets of signaling pathways in different cells. For example, the prolonged activation of MAPK by BDNF observed in fibroblasts in this report does not seem as sustained as the MAPK activation observed in PC12 cells by NGF (16Greene L.A. Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4826) Google Scholar). This suggests the pathways in fibroblasts could be different from PC12 cells.FRS2 was cloned based on binding to Grb2 in FGF-stimulated cells (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar), whereas SNT was identified as a 78–90-kDa protein phosphorylated on tyrosine in response to NGF treatment (18Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). FRS2 resolved on gels is a doublet with a predicted molecular mass, based on mobility, of 92–95 kDa (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). This is similar to the observations reported here of a doublet with estimated molecular mass by gel mobility of 90 kDa. Kouhara and colleagues suggested (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) that it is probable that FRS2 and SNT are identical. The data presented here support the contention that FRS2 is SNT, since they comigrate. In addition, BDNF induces phosphorylation of FRS2 and SNT. Notably, phosphorylation of SNT was not induced by EGF in PC12 cells (18Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). EGF also does not stimulate phosphorylation of FRS2 (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar).The cDNA clone for FRS2 encodes on open reading frame of 508 amino acids with a predicted mass of 57 kDa. FRS2 is myristoylated and contains a consensus myristoylation sequence in the amino terminus, followed by a PTB domain. FRS2 is localized to the cell membrane (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). A mutant of FRS2, which is not myristoylated, is localized to the cytoplasm. This demonstrates myristoylation targets FRS2 to the cell membrane (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). However, in cell fractionation experiments, tyrosine-phosphorylated SNT was found predominantly in the nuclear fraction along with, as expected, c-Jun (18Rabin S.J. Cleghon V. Kaplan D.R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). These disparate results have not been resolved yet. FRS2/SNT is a substrate for the FGF receptor, TRK, and TRKB, which is consistent with plasma membrane localization.In the experiments reported here, FRS2 migrates as a protein doublet on SDS-PAGE gels. Whether these two proteins are derived from the same gene and have different masses because of post-translational modification, such as phosphorylation, or alternative splicing of their mRNAs is not known. Alternatively, it is not known if the proteins are derived from two related genes. There are data suggesting that there are two members of the SNT family (46Pinon L.G. Minichiello L. Klein R. Davies A.M. Development. 1996; 122: 3255-3261PubMed Google Scholar). However, it has been reported that apparently only SNT-1, which is FRS2, binds to p13suc1-agarose beads. SNT-2 may not bind to p13suc1-agarose beads (41Xu H. Lee K.W. Goldfarb M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 17987-17990Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The proteins comprising the observed FRS2 doublet described in this report are recognized by antibodies raised against the COOH terminus of FRS2 and bind to p13suc1 beads.In observations similar to the data reported here, mutation of Trk tyrosine 490 to phenylalanine also resulted in attenuation, but not abrogation, of NGF-dependent MAPK phosphorylation (25Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). It was suggested that activation of PLC-γ1 may lead to phosphorylation of MAPK in PC12nnr5 cells engineered to express TrkY490F. The data presented here show that neither the level nor, more important, the time course of MAPK phosphorylation seems altered in fibroblasts expressing TrkBY785F contrasted with TrkBwt. This suggests that an adapter protein, perhaps FRS2, SH2-B, or APS, rather than PLC-γ1, may be required for BDNF-dependent MAPK phosphorylation in fibroblasts expressing TrkBY484F.Expression of a mutant Trk in PC12nnr5 cells, where a tripeptide sequence, KFG, in the juxtamembrane region was deleted did not result in NGF-dependent phosphorylation of SNT (19Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The sequence of FRS2 (28Kouhara H. Hadari Y.R. Spivak-Kroizman T. Schilling J. Bar-Sagi D. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1997; 89: 693-702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar) predicts it contains a PTB domain, which binds motifs containing phosphotyrosine. However, several proteins, X11, FE65, and Numb, have PTB domains that bind motifs that do not contain phosphotyrosine (38Pawson T. Scott J.D. Science. 1997; 278: 2075-2080Crossref PubMed Scopus (1887) Google Scholar). Xu et al. (47Schimmang T. Alvarez-Bolado G. Minichiello L. Vazquez E. Giraldez F. Klein R. Represa J. Mech. Dev. 1997; 64: 77-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) have found that the PTB domain of SNT-1, which they conclude is FRS2, is required for association with the FGF receptor in in vitro experiments. Moreover, a juxtamembrane region of the FGF receptor is also required for the association of the PTB domain of SNT-1 in vitro. In additional experiments in NIH3T3 cells, it was found that the PTB domain of SNT-1/FRS2 and the juxtamembrane region of the FGF receptor are required for phosphorylation on tyrosine of SNT-1/FRS2 in vivo in response to FGF. It should prove enlightening to determine if this KFG motif is also required for phosphorylation of FRS2 by TrkB, as is reported for phosphorylation of SNT by TRK (19Peng X. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Stephens R.M. Neuron. 1995; 15: 395-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar).We observed other proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine that are, apparently, immunoprecipitated with FRS2 in NB1643 cells. It remains to be determined if these proteins with apparent molecular masses between 60 and 90 kDa form complexes with FRS2. FGF induces FRS2 association with Shp2 (42Ong S.H. Lim Y.P. Low B.C. Guy G.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1997; 238: 261-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Shp2 is a protein-tyrosine phosphatase. Moreover, binding of Shp2 to FRS2 is required for FGF-induced PC12 differentiation (43Hadari Y.R. Kouhara H. Lax I. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 3966-3973Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). FGF induces the formation of a complex containing FRS2, Shp2, and Grb2 that may also contribute to activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. In addition, Shp2 phosphatase activity is required for sustained activation of MAPK by FGF (45Minichiello L. Piehl F. Vazquez E. Schimmang T. Hokfelt T. Represa J. Klein R. Development. 1995; 121: 4067-4075PubMed Google Scholar). In experiments related to this subject, it was found that mice homozygous for a deletion mutant of Shp2 die in mid-gestation (44Saxton T.M. Henkemeyer M. Gasca S. Shen R. Rossi D.J. Shalaby F. Feng G.S. Pawson T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2352-2364Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar). In cell cultures established from mutant embryos, it was found that Shp2 was required for full and sustained activation of the MAPK pathway. This raises the intriguing possibility that FRS2 may also stimulate or sustain MAPK activity by activating a protein-tyrosine phosphatase, Shp2.BDNF has roles in cell survival, axonal growth, and even synaptic plasticity. Delineating the signaling pathways required for these specific cellular effects is of considerable contemporary interest. Data derived from both in vitro experiments and targeted disruption of the BDNF and TrkB genes suggest that BDNF is required for trophic support of some neurons (1–3,45–47). Wortmannin, a pharmacological inhibitor of PI3K among other enzymes, blocked NGF-dependent survival of PC12 cells (40Qian X. Riccoio A. Zhang Y. Ginty D.D. Neuron. 1998; 21: 1017-1029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). PDGF promotes survival of PC12 cells engineered to express the PDGF receptor (48Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1288) Google Scholar). However, expression of a mutant of PDGF receptor incapable of activating PI3K did not prevent apoptosis. The serine/threonine kinase, AKT, may also be an important effector of PI3K for preventing apoptosis (49Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F. Birnbaum M.J. Yao R. Cooper G.M. Segal R.A. Kaplan D.R. Greenberg M.E. Science. 1997; 275: 661-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (2213) Google Scholar). Neurotrophins, it seems, require PI3K for promoting cell survival. However, the RAS/MAPK is required for differentiation of PC12 cells (24Obermeier A. Bradshaw R.A. Seedorf K. Choidas A. Schlessinger J. Ullrich A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1585-1590Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 25Stephens R.M. Loeb D.M. Copeland T.D. Pawson T. Greene L.A. Kaplan D.R. Neuron. 1994; 12: 691-705Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar). BDNF has other physiological roles as diverse as growth cone guidance (4Song H.J. Ming G.L. Poo M.M. Nature. 1997; 388: 275-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and synaptic plasticity. BDNF stabilizes synapses (50Kwon Y.W. Gurney M.E. J. Neurobiol. 1996; 29: 503-516Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) and may be required for maintenance of long term potentiation in the hippocampus (7Patterson S.L. Abel T. Deuel T.A. Martin K.C. Rose J.C. Kandel E.R. Neuron. 1996; 16: 1137-1145Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar, 8Kang H. Welcher A.A. Shelton D. Schuman E.M. Neuron. 1997; 19: 653-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, important to determine the signaling pathways required by BDNF to achieve signaling specificity. It remains to be determined how BDNF promoted signaling through FRS2 integrates into the scenario of BDNF-activated signaling pathways leading to these diverse cellular effects.In this paper, we show that association of Shc with phosphorylated tyrosine 484 of TrkB accounts for only part of the observed activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. These data compelled a search for other BDNF-activated signaling pathways that result in MAPK phosphorylation that are independent of Shc. We have shown that BDNF induces phosphorylation of FRS2, which is likely identical to SNT, and that BDNF induces association of FRS2 with Grb2. This is likely to lead to activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway. Experiments identifying critical regions of TrkB required for phosphorylation of FRS2 will be important. This will allow the design of mutant TrkB receptors that do not signal through FRS2 for testing the requirement for FRS2 in BDNF signaling. Experiments testing whether BDNF induces sustained activation of the MAPK pathway by signaling through independent pathways requiring Shc and FRS2, respectively, will be indispensable for understanding BDNF signaling specificity.

Spg1 is negatively regulated by Byr4 and Cdc16, which together form a two-component GTPase-activating protein for the Spg1 GTPase. To better understand how Byr4 regulates septation, Byr4 mutants were tested for in vitro functions. This analysis revealed that Byr4 contained one Cdc16-binding site and four Spg1-binding sites (SBS), designated SBS1–SBS4. Although mutants with a single SBS bound Spg1 and inhibited GTP dissociation, the equilibrium binding affinity of these mutants was 28–280-fold weaker than Byr4. Because some Byr4 mutants with multiple SBSs bound Spg1 tighter than the corresponding mutants with a single SBS, multiple SBSs probably interact to cause the high affinity binding of Byr4 to Spg1. A region of Byr4 that bound Spg1, SBS4, and the region that bound Cdc16, Cdc16-binding site, was necessary and sufficient to form Cdc16-dependent Spg1GAP activity that was similar to that of wild-type Byr4 with Cdc16.

In many eukaryotes, including Schizosaccharomyces pombe, cell division results from the constriction of an actomyosin ring that is perpendicular to the mitotic spindle (reviewed in Ref. 1Gould K.

Calleja G. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 115: 358-366Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The primary septum is then degraded to yield two cells. Characterization of fission yeast mutants that affect these processes suggests they represent the following four categories: 1) division site selection mutants, 2) actomyosin ring assembly mutants, 3) actomyosin ring constriction and septation initiation mutants, and 4) cell separation mutants (reviewed in Ref. 1Gould K. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). cdc7− and spg1− mutants form a medial ring but do not constrict this ring or deposit a septum, leading to elongated, multinucleate cells (9Schmidt S.

Genetics. 1998; 149: 1265-1275Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast,cdc16− and byr4−mutants undergo repeated rounds of septation (12Minet M. Nurse P. Thuriaux P. Mitchison J. J. Bacteriol. 1979; 137: 440-446Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). These phenotypes suggest that Cdc7 and Spg1 are positive regulators of septation, whereas Cdc16 and Byr4 are negative regulators of septation. Consistent with this notion, Spg1 and Cdc7 overexpression causes arrest of cells with multiple septa (9Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 10Fankhauser C. Simanis V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), whereas Byr4 overexpression causes arrest of cells with multiple nuclei (13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Spg1 is a GTPase of the Ras superfamily that is constitutively localized to spindle-pole bodies where it presumably regulates septation (9Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 14Sohrman M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). In its GTP-bound form, Spg1 binds the Cdc7 protein kinase and causes it to translocate to spindle poles (10Fankhauser C. Simanis V. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3011-3019Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 14Sohrman M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar). Consistent with their role as negative regulators of septation, Byr4 and Cdc16 form a two-component GTPase-activating protein (GAP) 1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; CBS, Cdc16-binding site; SBS, Spg1-binding site; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate.1The abbreviations used are: GAP, GTPase-activating protein; CBS, Cdc16-binding site; SBS, Spg1-binding site; CRIB, Cdc42/Rac interactive binding; Gpp(NH)p, guanosine 5′-(β,γ-imido)triphosphate. (1Gould K. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2939-2951Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar) for the Spg1 GTPase (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Although a role for Cdc16 in Spg1GAP activity is not surprising because Cdc16 has sequence similarity to proteins with YptGAP activity (9Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 16Neuwald A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 243-244Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar), the requirement for two proteins for GAP activity is unexpected because GAPs for other Ras family GTPases contain one component (17Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in Spg1GAP activity, Byr4 binds Spg1, and this binding inhibits GTP dissociation and hydrolysis but does not affect GDP dissociation (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Cdc16 binds Byr4 but does not bind Spg1 or affect the nucleotide bound to Spg1 in the absence of Byr4. Byr4-Spg1 binding and Byr4-Cdc16 Spg1GAP activity are specific for Spg1 because Byr4 and Cdc16 do not interact with Ypt family GTPases, which are the most similar to Spg1 by primary sequence comparison. Genetic experiments support the biochemical interactions between Spg1, Byr4, and Cdc16 (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 18Jwa M. Song K. Molecules Cells. 1998; 8: 240-245PubMed Google Scholar). Mild Byr4 overexpression suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth ofcdc16–116 mutants. This suppression is allele-specific because Byr4 does not suppress the growth defect ofcdc16 − mutants. Whereas higher Byr4 overexpression is lethal, Spg1 overexpression suppresses this lethality. A Byr4-like regulator and a two-component GAP are unique to the Spg1 GTPase. Novel regulators for Spg1 are consistent with classification of Spg1 in a separate subfamily of the Ras superfamily (9Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) because regulators for different subfamilies are usually distinct (17Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1749) Google Scholar). TheSaccharomyces cerevisiae Tem1 GTPase is currently the only other member of the Spg1 subfamily (9Schmidt S. Sohrmann M. Hofmann K. Woollard A. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 1519-1534Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar). Unlikespg1− mutants, tem1−mutants arrest in late mitosis perhaps because of an inability to degrade mitotic cyclins (19Shirayama M. Matsui Y. Toh-e A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7476-7482Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 20Jaspersen S. Charles J. Tinker-Kulberg R. Morgan D. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1998; 9: 2803-2817Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Whereas tem1−mutants do not undergo septation or cytokinesis, it is unclear whether this failure results from their cell cycle arrest or reflects a requirement for Tem1 to regulate septation and cytokinesis. TheS. cerevisiae Bub2 protein is the likely homologue of Cdc16 because these proteins are globally similar, and BUB2suppresses the temperature-sensitive growth defect ofcdc16–116 mutants (21Fankhauser C. Marks J. Reymond A. Simanis V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2697-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). cdc16−mutants and bub2− mutants are similar in that they are defective in the spindle-assembly checkpoint, but differ in that BUB2 is not essential for viability (21Fankhauser C. Marks J. Reymond A. Simanis V. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2697-2704Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 22Hoyt M.A. Totis L. Roberts B. Cell. 1991; 66: 507-517Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (891) Google Scholar). To further understand how Byr4 regulates septation, Byr4 mutants were assayed for binding to Cdc16 or Spg1 and for Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16. A single Cdc16-binding site (CBS) and four Spg1-binding sites (SBS) were identified. A C-terminal fragment of Byr4, which contained SBS4 and CBS, was necessary and sufficient for Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16. pbyr4/ET14b, pcdc16/GEX, and pspg1/GEX were previously described (13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). byr4 mutants were constructed by amplification of the byr4 cDNA using 5′-oligonucleotides with anNdeI site and 3′-oligonucleotides with a BamHI site. Amplified products were digested with NdeI andBamHI and ligated with pET14b that was similarly digested. Byr4 mutants, Gst-Cdc16, and Gst-Spg1 were expressed in BL21(DE3)pLysE, NM522, and XL1-Blue bacteria, respectively. Methods for purification of Spg1, Cdc16, and Byr4, Cdc16-Byr4 and Spg1-Byr4 binding assays, and Spg1GAP assays were previously described (13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar,15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The affinity of Byr4 mutants for Spg1 was determined by measuring the effect of Byr4 on Spg1 GTPase properties. Radioactivity is lost from Spg1-[γ-32P]GTP by GTP dissociation and hydrolysis. The fraction of the initial radioactivity bound to Spg1 is described in terms of the GTP dissociation rate, kt, the GTP hydrolysis rate, kh, and time, t, by the following equation. Spgl−[γ−32P]GTP(Spgl−[γ−32P]GTP)t=0=exp−kh+kttEquation 1 Because the Byr4-Spg1-GTP complex had negligible rates of GTP dissociation and hydrolysis (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), the effect of Byr4 on the observed rate of radioactivity lost from Spg1-GTP, ko, was used to measure the Byr4-Spg1-GTP equilibrium binding constant,Kb. Kb is related toko by the following equation. ko=kh+kt1+Byr4KbEquation 2 If Byr4 mutants inhibited only GTP dissociation, then the observed rate of radioactivity lost from Spg1-GTP would be as follows. ko=kh+kt1+Byr4KbEquation 3 In either case, 50% maximal inhibition occurs when the Byr4 concentration equals Kb. Ras-Raf-1 binding was measured similarly (23Herrmann C. Martin G. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Our experience with this method revealed that the measured equilibrium constants varied by less than 50% between different Byr4 preparations. Byr4 contains 665 amino acids, and the only motifs detected by primary sequence inspection were two imperfect direct repeats of 43 amino acids (13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar) (Fig.1 A). To identify Byr4 regions that bind Cdc16, Byr4 deletion mutants were expressed inEscherichia coli, purified, and assayed for binding to Gst-Cdc16 (Fig. 1 A). Byr4-D2, a mutant with residues 533–665, bound Gst-Cdc16, although Byr4-D6, a mutant with residues 1–535, did not bind Gst-Cdc16 (Fig. 1 B). To further limit the CBS, mutants containing the N- and C-terminal portions of Byr4-D2 were analyzed. These assays showed that Byr4-D10, a mutant with residues 595–665, bound Gst-Cdc16, although Byr4-D14 did not bind Gst-Cdc16 (Fig. 1 B). As with wild-type Byr4 (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), Byr4-D2 and Byr4-D10 degradation products that copurified with the full-length proteins did not bind Gst-Cdc16 (Fig. 1 B). This result was consistent with a requirement for the Byr4 C terminus to bind Cdc16 because these degradation products were missing C-terminal residues (data not shown). We conclude that the Byr4 C terminus is necessary and sufficient for Byr4-Cdc16 binding. The ability of Byr4 to inhibit the dissociation and hydrolysis of GTP that is bound to Spg1 was used to identify SBS in Byr4 (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). This assay was advantageous because it was quantitative, and binding was measured under equilibrium conditions. The equilibrium binding constant,Kb, is the Byr4 concentration where 50% of the maximal inhibition of Spg1 GTPase properties occurs (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 23Herrmann C. Martin G. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2901-2905Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar). Four SBSs, designated SBS1, SBS2, SBS3, and SBS4, were identified using this assay (Fig. 2 A). SBS1 was contained within Byr4-D3, which had residues 1–200. Byr4-D3 inhibited loss of radioactivity from Spg1-[γ-32P]GTP about 50% at saturating concentrations with a 140 nm Kb (Fig. 2, A and B) and from Spg1-[γ-35S]GTP (Fig. 2 C), showing that SBS1 inhibited GTP dissociation. Because Byr4-D3 only partially inhibited loss of radioactivity from Spg1-[γ-32P]GTP, Byr4-D3 may not affect GTP hydrolysis. Mutants that deleted sequences in Byr4-D3, such as Byr4-D17 and Byr4-D18, did not bind Spg1 (Fig.2 A). SBS2 was contained within Byr4-D27, which had residues 200–475. Byr4-D27 inhibited loss of radioactivity from Spg1-[γ-32P]GTP with a 175 nm Kb (Fig. 2, A and B) and from Spg1-[γ-35S]GTP (Fig. 2 C), showing that Byr4-D27 inhibited both GTP hydrolysis and dissociation. Mutants that deleted sequences in Byr4-D27, such as Byr4-D22 and Byr4-D21, significantly weakened binding to Spg1 (Fig. 2 A). SBS3 and SBS4 were contained within Byr4-D13 and Byr4-D14, respectively (Fig.2 A). Byr4-D13 and Byr4-D14 inhibited loss of radioactivity from Spg1-[γ-32P]GTP with 1400 and 300 nm Kb, respectively (Fig. 2 B), and from Spg1-[γ-35S]GTP (Fig. 2 C), showing that Byr4-D13 and Byr4-D14 inhibited both GTP hydrolysis and dissociation. The boundaries of these mutants corresponded to the imperfect, direct repeats identified by primary sequence analysis (13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Byr4-D10, which contained CBS, did not affect Spg1 GTPase properties (Fig.2 B). Hence, Byr4 contained four SBSs with equilibrium binding constants from 140 to 1400 nm. These binding affinities were much weaker than that of Byr4, which had a 5 nm Kb (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). The affinities of Byr4 mutants with multiple SBSs were measured to determine which Byr4 regions were required for maximal binding to Spg1. Two mutants with two sequential SBSs bound tighter than the corresponding mutants with a single SBS. Byr4-D4, a mutant with SBS1 and SBS2, and Byr4-D7, a mutant with SBS2 and SBS3, had 50–60 nm Kb, which were about 3-fold lower than mutants with the corresponding single SBS (Fig. 2 D). Interestingly, Byr4-D2, a mutant with SBS4 and CBS, had a 6-fold lowerKb than a mutant with only SBS4. Whether the higher affinity of Byr4-D4, Byr4-D7, and Byr4-D2 resulted from simultaneous binding of multiple SBSs or increased binding of a single SBS is unknown. In contrast, Byr4-D11, a mutant with SBS3 and SBS4, had a 300 nm Kb, which was similar to that of mutants with only SBS4 (Fig. 2 D). The lack of cooperativity between SBS3 and SBS4 was not surprising because these domains share primary sequence similarity (13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). All mutants tested with three or four sequential SBSs and/or CBS had 30–50 nm Kb (Fig. 2 D), showing that these combinations did not significantly increase Spg1 binding. Because a 5 nm Kb for Byr4-Spg1 was measured (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), we conclude that SBS1, CBS, and perhaps SBS2, SBS3, or SBS4 are required for maximal binding affinity. Byr4 binding to Spg1-GDP could not be measured using changes in GDP dissociation because Byr4 did not affect this GTPase property (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Instead, the ability of Byr4 mutants to bind immobilized Spg1-GDP or Spg1-Gpp(NH)p was used to test the effect of the Spg1 nucleotide state on Byr4 binding. These assays showed that Byr4-D3 and Byr4-D27, mutants with only SBS1 or SBS2, respectively, bound Spg1-Gpp(NH)p slightly better than Spg1-GDP (Fig. 2 E). Byr4-D13 and Byr4-D14, mutants with only SBS3 or SBS4, respectively, bound Spg1-Gpp(NH)p much better than Spg1-GDP (Fig. 2 E). These binding preferences were unexpected because Byr4 bound equally to Spg1-Gpp(NH)p and Spg1-GDP (15Furge K. Wong K. Armstrong J. Balasubramanian M. Albright C.F. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 947-954Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). To understand the basis for the nucleotide specificity difference between the individual SBSs and Byr4, Byr4 mutants with multiple SBSs were assayed. Byr4-D1, a mutant with SBS2, SBS3, and SBS4, bound Spg1-Gpp(NH)p slightly better than Spg1-GDP (Fig.2 E). Because the nucleotide specificity of Byr4-D1 binding was similar to that of Byr4-D27, SBS2 appeared to dominate the nucleotide specificity of Byr4-D27. Byr4-D4, a mutant with SBS1 and SBS2, bound equally to Spg1-Gpp(NH)p and Spg1-GDP, suggesting that SBS1 and SBS2 interact to affect both binding specificity and affinity (Fig.2 E). The nucleotide-independent binding of Byr4-D4 to Spg1 probably explains the binding behavior of Byr4. Hence, Byr4 contains four SBSs and some of these SBSs interact to cause high affinity, nucleotide-independent binding to Spg1. Because a two-component GAP is unique to Byr4 and Cdc16, we determined what regions of Byr4 were required for this reaction. This analysis showed that Byr4-D2, which contained SBS4 and CBS, was the minimal mutant that had Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16 (Fig.3 A). Neither Byr4-D16, which lacked CBS, nor Byr4-D10, which contained only CBS, had detectable Spg1GAP activity. Byr4 mutants without CBS had at least 100-fold less Spg1GAP activity than Byr4 because Spg1GAP activity was detected with 2 nm Byr4 but not with 200 nm Byr4-D16 (Fig.3 B and data not shown). Spg1GAP assays with a range of Byr4-D2 and Byr4 concentrations revealed that Byr4 and Byr4-D2 had similar Spg1GAP activity (Fig. 3 B). Hence, a region of Byr4 that binds Spg1 (SBS4) and a region that binds Cdc16 (CBS) are necessary and sufficient to form Cdc16-dependent Spg1GAP activity. To better understand how Byr4 regulates septation, Byr4 mutants were assayed for binding to Spg1 or Cdc16 and for formation of Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16. This analysis revealed that Byr4 contained one CBS and four SBSs, designated SBS1–SBS4. SBS4 and CBS were necessary and sufficient to form Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16, which was very similar to that of Byr4. Biochemical and sequence analyses suggest that the four SBSs in Byr4 represent three classes of SBSs. One SBS class includes SBS3 and SBS4, which correspond to the imperfect direct repeats of 43 amino acids identified by primary sequence analysis (13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Like Byr4, SBS3 and SBS4 inhibited GTP dissociation and hydrolysis by Spg1. Unlike Byr4, SBS3 and SBS4 bound Spg1-GTP with a 280- and 60-fold, respectively, weaker affinity than Byr4 and bound Spg1-GTP better than Spg1-GDP. Although unrelated in primary sequence, SBS3 and SBS4 have some similarities to the Cdc42/Rac interactive binding (CRIB) motif, a sequence that binds the Cdc42 and Rac1 GTPases (24Manser E. Leung T. Salihuddin H. Zhao Z. Lim L. Nature. 1994; 367: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (1280) Google Scholar) and is found in several proteins (25Burbelo P. Drechel D. Hall A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29071-29074Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Like CRIB motifs, SBS3 and SBS4 are relatively short in length and bind the GTP-bound form of the GTPase better than the GDP-bound form of the GTPase. Strengthening of SBS4 binding to Spg1-GTP by CBS is similar to results found with the CRIB motif from the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein. In the case of Byr4, the relatively weak binding of SBS4 to Spg1-GTP, characterized by an equilibrium binding affinity of 300 nm, was strengthened 5-fold by sequences containing CBS, which did not detectably interact with Spg1 without SBS4. In a similar manner, the relatively weak binding of Cdc42-GTP to the CRIB peptide from Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, characterized by an equilibrium binding affinity of 480 nm, was strengthened about 6-fold by adjacent sequences that did not bind Cdc42-GTP in isolation (26Rudolph M. Bayer P. Abo A. Kuhlmann J. Vetter I. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18067-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Perhaps there will be additional similarities between SBS3/SBS4 and CRIB motifs. It will be particularly interesting to test whether SBS3 and SBS4, like the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-CRIB motif (26Rudolph M. Bayer P. Abo A. Kuhlmann J. Vetter I. Wittinghofer A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18067-18076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar), lack a defined domain structure in the absence of the GTPase. Cdc7, a protein kinase that is likely an effector of Spg1 (14Sohrman M. Schmidt S. Hagan I. Simanis V. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 84-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), may use a motif similar to SBS3 and SBS4 to bind Spg1 because Cdc7 contains a sequence similar to SBS3 and SBS4 (13Song K. Mach K.E. Chen C.Y. Reynolds T. Albright C.F. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1307-1319Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). If this is the case, then Byr4 and Cdc7 may bind competitively to Spg1, and Byr4 might negatively regulate Spg1 by inhibiting effector binding as well as by forming Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16. SBS1 and SBS2 likely define distinct classes of SBSs. SBS1 and SBS2 differ from SBS3/SBS4 in that they lack the conserved sequence motifs found in SBS3 and SBS4. Furthermore, SBS1 and SBS2 bind similarly to Spg1-GTP and Spg1-GDP. SBS1 and SBS2 differ in that SBS1 inhibits GTP hydrolysis weakly, if at all, whereas SBS2 inhibits GTP hydrolysis. Consistent with SBS1, SBS2, and SBS3/SBS4 representing different classes of SBSs, mutants with SBS1/SBS2 or SBS2/SBS3 bind Spg1 better than the corresponding mutants with only one SBS. Multiple SBSs were unexpected because of the other GTPase-binding proteins; only Ran-binding protein 2 contains multiple binding sites for the same GTPase (27Wu J. Matunis M. Kraemer D. Blobel G. Coutavas E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14209-14213Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 28Yokoyama N. Hayashi N. Seki T. Pante N. Ohba T. Nishii K. Kuma K. Hayashida T. Miyata T. Aebi U. Fukui M. Nishimoto T. Nature. 1995; 376: 184-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (410) Google Scholar). Multiple SBSs may be needed to increase Byr4-Spg1 affinity because all deletion mutants had at least 10-fold weaker affinity than wild-type Byr4. In this case, different SBSs may interact with different regions of Spg1 to form the high affinity binding observed between Byr4 and Spg1. The increased binding affinity of mutants with more than one SBS is consistent with this notion. Multiple SBSs may also allow Byr4 to bind more than one Spg1 molecule in vivo. Multivalent binding could dramatically increase the effective Byr4-Spg1 affinity and allow different SBSs to perform distinct functions. For instance, some SBSs may target Byr4 to spindle poles, whereas other SBSs may form Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16. In vivo analysis of Byr4 mutants will be needed to understand the physiologic roles of the different SBSs. Sequences containing SBS4 and CBS were necessary and sufficient for Spg1GAP activity with Cdc16. GAPs are unusual enzymes in that two proteins, the GTPase and the GAP, interact transiently and contain residues important for catalysis. GAPs are thought to stimulate GTP hydrolysis by stabilizing switch regions in the GTPase that orient the GTPase catalytic machinery and by supplying an external arginine residue that stabilizes the charge in the transition state (reviewed in Ref. 29Scheffzek K. Ahmadian M. Wittinghofer A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1998; 23: 257-262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Byr4 and Cdc16 may further divide these GAP functions. SBS4, one part of Byr4 required for Spg1GAP activity, binds Spg1-GTP, affects its GTPase properties, and may stabilize the switch regions of Spg1. CBS, another part of Byr4 required for Spg1GAP activity, binds Cdc16 and is presumably required for Cdc16 to interact with Spg1. Once near Spg1, Cdc16 may supply the arginine residue presumably required for Spg1GAP activity. Byr4 would thus provide both binding and catalytic functions required for Spg1GAP activity in this model. The division of traditional GAP activities into two proteins may allow additional regulation of Spg1GAP activity. We thank Kathleen Mach for helpful comments on the manuscript."

To clarify the mechanisms affected by SHIP, we analyzed Ca2+ mobilization in the DT40 B cell line in which the SHIP gene was disrupted. In SHIP-deficient cells, Ca2+ transient elicited by BCR stimulation was more prolonged than that in control cells both in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production following BCR stimulation was enhanced in SHIP-deficient cells. In SHIP-deficient cells in comparison with the control cells, BCR stimulation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+induced a greater degree of Ca2+ store depletion and the Ca2+ influx upon re-addition of extracellular Ca2+ was also greater. However, store-operated Ca2+ influx (SOC) elicited by thapsigargin-induced store depletion was not affected by SHIP. These results indicate that the primary target pathway of SHIP is the Ca2+ release from the stores, and that Ca2+ influx by the SOC mechanism is secondarily controlled by the level of Ca2+ in the stores without direct inhibition of SOC. In this way, SHIP may play an important role in ensuring the robust tuning of Ca2+signaling in B cells.

Cross-linking of B cell receptors (BCR) with specific antigens activates phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) through a series of tyrosine phosphorylations, resulting in hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3), a product of the hydrolysis of PIP2, then activates IP3 receptors to mobilize the intracellular Ca2+ stores. Ca2+ influx from the extracellular space is also activated in response to BCR cross-linking via the store-operated Ca2+ influx (SOC) pathway, which is activated by depletion of the intracellular Ca2+ stores (4Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 901-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (1294) Google Scholar,5Hoth M. Penner R. Nature. 1992; 355: 353-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (1495) Google Scholar). BCR activation also results in the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which converts PIP2 to phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). In addition to BCR, B lymphocytes express another class of immunoreceptors, FcγRIIB. Co-cross-linking of BCR and FcγRIIB attenuates the BCR-induced Ca2+ response (6Ransom J.T. Chen M. Sandoval V.M.

One of the possible target mechanisms of SHIP in the attenuation of the Ca2+ response is the SOC activity. Since the FcγRIIB-mediated inhibition of Ca2+ signaling was more prominent in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ than in its absence (8Muta T. Kurosaki T. Misulovin Z. Sanchez M. Nussenzweig M.C. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1994; 368: 70-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (438) Google Scholar, 9Diegel M.L. Rankin B.M. Bolen J.B. Dubois P.M. Kiener P.A. J. Biol.

Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 12Kiener P.A. Lioubin M.N. Rohrschneider L.R. Ledbetter J.A. Nadler S.G. Diegel M.L. J. Biol.

Since PIP3 was reported to stimulate Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk), which in turn tyrosine-phosphorylates PLCγ (18Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A. Beitz L.O. Li Z. Lin S. Gout I.

Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar), degradation of PIP3 upon activation of SHIP by the co-cross-linking of FcγRIIB would decrease PLCγ activity and hence inhibit Ca2+ release from the stores. However, direct demonstration that SHIP affects SOC or Ca2+ release in FcγRIIB-mediated signaling remains to be reported. It has been shown that cross-linking of BCR alone leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP (21Crowley M.T. Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1145-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 22Saxton T.M. van Oostveen I. Bowtell D. Aebersold R. Gold M.R. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 623-636PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, SHIP seems to inhibit the BCR-mediated Ca2+ response even without co-cross-linking of FcγRIIB, because SHIP-deficient cells exhibit prolongation of the [Ca2+]itransient upon BCR activation (23Bolland S. Pearse R.N. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Immunity. 1998; 8: 509-516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). While SHIP is recruited to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif on the intracellular region of FcγRIIB upon activation of this receptor (11Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar), there is no immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif on the BCR complex. Therefore, SHIP is not a unique molecule for FcγRIIB-mediated inhibitory signaling, but plays an important role in BCR-mediated signaling; the mechanisms of the recruitment of SHIP seem different in the absence or presence of FcγRIIB-mediated signaling. It remains to be clarified how Ca2+ mobilization is attenuated by SHIP in BCR-mediated signaling. In an effort to understand the role of SHIP in BCR-mediated signaling, we addressed the following questions in this work: 1) how are the patterns of Ca2+ mobilization elicited by BCR stimulation modulated by SHIP, and 2) which Ca2+ mobilization pathway is affected by SHIP: Ca2+ release or SOC. To clarify these points, we compared the patterns of [Ca2+]i mobilization in control and SHIP-deficient DT40 cells at the single cell level. We found that the prolongation of [Ca2+]itransient in SHIP-deficient cells is due to enhanced Ca2+release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores with enhancement of IP3 production. We also found that SHIP regulates SOC not by a direct interaction but through its effect on Ca2+release. SHIP thus plays an important role in shaping the Ca2+ mobilization patterns after BCR stimulation. Chicken B cells (DT40) were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 1% chicken serum, 50 μm β-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmglutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in 5% CO2 at 0.5–1 × 106cells/ml. The generation of SHIP-deficient cells and transfection of either mouse wild-type SHIP or mutant SHIP with disrupted phosphatase activity (P671A, D675A, R676G) were described elsewhere (13Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). About 30 min before the experiments, cells were attached to collagen-coated coverslips. Cells on the coverslips were incubated with 5 μm Fura-2 AM for 30 min at room temperature in physiological salt solution (PSS) (150 mmNaCl, 4 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES, 5.6 mm glucose; pH adjusted to 7.4 with NaOH) containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin followed by rinsing with PSS. The coverslips with Fura-2-loaded cells were mounted on the stage of an inverted epifluorescence microscope (TMD 300, Nikon). Cells were examined under a 40× water immersion objective (numerical aperture: 0.7, Olympus). Pairs of fluorescence images with 340 and 380 nm excitations were collected using a cooled CCD camera (PXL-37, Photometrics,) at either 0.5 or 0.33 Hz. The ratio (R) between the fluorescence intensities at 340 and 380 nm excitations was converted to [Ca2+]i using the following equation (24Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar); [Ca2+]i=K d′(R −R min)/(R max −R), where K d′,R max, and R min are the dissociation constant and maximal and minimal R values, respectively. The values were determined in vitro under equivalent optical conditions. R max andR min were multiplied by a factor of 0.85 for viscosity correction (25Poenie M. Alderton J. Steinhardt R. Tsien R. Science. 1986; 233: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). For the stimulation of the BCR, 2 μg/ml mouse anti-chicken IgM antibody, M4 (26Chen C.-L.H. Lehmeyer J.E. Cooper M.D. J. Immunol. 1982; 129: 2580-2585PubMed Google Scholar), was applied onto the cells through a thin pipette. Other solutions were applied in the same manner. The Ca2+ free solution had the same composition as PSS except for the omission of CaCl2 and introduction of EGTA (5 mm). Cells were harvested and washed with phosphate buffered saline. The cells were precipitated in 10% trichloroacetic acid (2 × 107 cells/ml). The precipitates were dissolved in solution containing 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0), 30 mm NaCl, and 1% SDS. The samples were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and were electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Trans-Blot, Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated with the primary polyclonal antibody (anti-mouse SHIP, Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.) and then with biotin-labeled secondary antibody. The blots were detected with enhanced chemiluminescence (Renaissance, NEN Life Science Products). Cells were harvested and washed with PSS. The BCR-stimulated cell suspension (2 × 106cells) was mixed with 15% trichloroacetic acid for termination of the reaction. After centrifugation, the supernatant was extracted with water-saturated diethylether and the water phase was neutralized with NaHCO3 to pH 7.5. d-myo- [3H]Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate assay system (TRK1000, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was used for measurement of IP3levels (27Challiss R.A. Batty I.H. Nahorski S.R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1988; 157: 684-691Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Radioactivity was measured for 3 min in a β-scintillation counter, and converted to IP3concentration using the calibration curve. Statistical results are expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were made using the pairedt test for the IP3 assay and the non-pairedt test for all the other measurements. RPMI 1640 medium, glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Chicken serum, ionomycin, and thapsigargin were obtained from Sigma. Fura-2 AM was purchased from Molecular Probes. All other chemicals were of the highest reagent grade. We compared the time course of [Ca2+]i mobilization in control and SHIP-deficient cells at the single cell level. BCR was activated by the application of anti-μ mouse IgM monoclonal antibody, M4. Ca2+ mobilization in control cells showed either a single peak or attenuating oscillations with a few peaks, and [Ca2+]i returned to the resting value within 200 s (Fig.1 A). In contrast, SHIP-deficient cells showed a plateau-like response or oscillations persisting for over 200 s (Fig. 1 B). Quantitative analysis of [Ca2+]i showed that the peak level of [Ca2+]i increase was slightly greater in SHIP-deficient cells (675 ± 29 nm, n = 140) than in control cells (556 ± 23 nm, n = 140;p < 0.002). The difference was more conspicuous in the late phase, and at 150 s after the BCR stimulation, [Ca2+]i remained at a higher level in SHIP-deficient cells (350 ± 31 nm,n = 70) than in control cells (110 ± 14 nm, n = 70; p < 0.0001) (Fig. 1, A and B; Fig.2 A).Figure 2Prolongation of [Ca2+]itransient elicited by BCR stimulation in SHIP-deficient cells in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. The time course of changes in [Ca2+]i with (A) or without (B) extracellular Ca2+in control cells (thick trace) or in SHIP-deficient cells (thin trace). The extracellular Ca2+ was removed 20 s before BCR stimulation. Arrows indicate the time point of M4 antibody application.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To confirm that the observed prolongation of Ca2+mobilization in SHIP-deficient cells was due to the absence of SHIP, we transfected the SHIP-deficient cells with mouse SHIP or mutant SHIP lacking phosphatase activity. The expression of wild-type SHIP activity shortened the duration of [Ca2+]iincrease (Fig. 1 C), whereas transfection of SHIP lacking phosphatase activity was without effect (Fig. 1 D). The levels of expression of the wild-type and mutant SHIP were almost the same (Fig. 1 E). These results indicate that the shortening of the Ca2+ mobilization pattern by SHIP required its phosphatase activity. There exist two main pathways for Ca2+mobilization: Ca2+ release from the Ca2+ stores and Ca2+ entry from the extracellular space. Both pathways are potential targets of SHIP. To determine the role of SHIP in the Ca2+ release pathway, we analyzed the time course of Ca2+ mobilization by BCR stimulation in the presence and absence of extracellular Ca2+. The prolongation of Ca2+ mobilization in SHIP-deficient cells in the presence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2 A) was retained in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 2 B). Although the peak [Ca2+]i rise in control cells and SHIP-deficient cells in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ showed no significant difference (control: 520 ± 34 nm, n = 120; SHIP-deficient: 523 ± 25 nm, n = 105; p > 0.4), the [Ca2+]i at 150 s after BCR stimulation was greater in SHIP-deficient cells (182 ± 14 nm, n = 60) than in control cells (80 ± 9 nm, n = 51; p < 0.0001). These results indicate that Ca2+ release from the Ca2+ stores is one of the target pathways of SHIP. We then compared the time course of IP3 production during BCR stimulation in control and SHIP-deficient cells (Fig.3). The increase in IP3concentration was significantly higher in SHIP-deficient cells at 180 s after BCR stimulation (p < 0.05,n = 5) than in control cells. These results suggest that SHIP regulates Ca2+ release through the attenuation of IP3 production. We then evaluated the effect of SHIP on the Ca2+ influx mechanism. First, Ca2+ release from the Ca2+ stores was activated by BCR stimulation in the absence of extracellular Ca2+ for 600 s, during which period [Ca2+]i returned to the resting value. Reintroduction of extracellular Ca2+ resulted in an increase in [Ca2+]i due to influx of Ca2+ in both control and SHIP-deficient cells (Fig.4, A and B,solid bar). The maximal level of [Ca2+]i reached during the extracellular application of Ca2+ was higher in SHIP-deficient cells than in control cells (Fig. 4 C). These results indicate that Ca2+ influx as well as Ca2+ release is attenuated by SHIP. Since we found that BCR-induced Ca2+ influx is inhibited by SHIP, we tested whether SHIP has a direct effect on the activity of the SOC mechanism that is activated by the depletion of Ca2+stores. We used a sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor, thapsigargin to deplete the Ca2+ stores, and then assayed the extent of SOC after reintroduction of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 5,A and B) (28Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). The increase in [Ca2+]i in control cells was not statistically different from that in SHIP-deficient cells (Fig.5 C). The result suggests that the SOC is not affected by SHIP, at least under the conditions where BCR is not cross-linked. Then, we repeated the same experiment under BCR stimulation, by which SHIP is expected to be activated. After a 900-s application of thapsigargin to deplete the Ca2+ stores, BCR was stimulated (arrows in Fig. 5, D and E), and then extracellular Ca2+ was reintroduced. BCR stimulation elicited no [Ca2+]i rise after thapsigargin treatment, confirming the complete depletion of the stores after thapsigargin treatment. SOC during BCR stimulation was not affected by SHIP, and the amplitude of the [Ca2+]i rise due to SOC was the same in control and SHIP-deficient cells (Fig. 5 F). These results indicate that the SOC mechanism is not a direct target of SHIP. The extent of the Ca2+ store depletion has been postulated to control the extent of activation of SOC. Therefore, the difference in the activation of SOC after BCR stimulation in control and SHIP-deficient cells (Fig. 4) may reflect a possible difference in the extent of Ca2+ depletion. We tested this hypothesis by estimating the amount of Ca2+ in the Ca2+ stores by the application of ionomycin in the absence of extracellular Ca2+. Ionomycin treatment after BCR stimulation elicited a greater [Ca2+]i increase in control cells than in SHIP-deficient cells (Fig. 6,A–C). However, the peak size of [Ca2+]i rise elicited by ionomycin treatment without BCR stimulation in control and in SHIP-deficient cells did not show any significant differences (Fig. 6,D–F), indicating that the initial Ca2+ content within the Ca2+ stores was the same in control and SHIP-deficient cells. These results indicate that BCR stimulation resulted in only partial Ca2+ release from the stores in control cells and nearly complete release of Ca2+ in SHIP-deficient cells, and suggest that the enhancement of Ca2+ influx in SHIP-deficient cells was due to secondary activation of SOC by more profound Ca2+ depletion. We finally tested whether SHIP affects the Ca2+ extrusion mechanism via the plasma membrane, which potentially controls [Ca2+]i in concert with the Ca2+ mobilization mechanism. We estimated the level of activity of the Ca2+ extrusion mechanism from the initial rate of decline of [Ca2+]i after termination of SOC. The rate was obtained from the slope of the line, which was fitted to the data points of [Ca2+]i for 2 min after removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 7,inset), and was plotted against the [Ca2+]i just before the removal of extracellular Ca2+ (Fig. 7). The plots from control and SHIP-deficient cells were superimposable, indicating no difference in the level of activity of the Ca2+ extrusion mechanism between control and SHIP-deficient cells. We examined the Ca2+ mobilization patterns in SHIP-deficient B cells at the single cell level and showed that the main role of SHIP in BCR-mediated Ca2+ signaling was to abbreviate the duration of Ca2+ mobilization. SHIP prevented continuous Ca2+ release from the intracellular Ca2+ stores via inhibition of IP3 production. Furthermore, we showed that SHIP regulates SOC not by a direct effect on the SOC mechanism but by controlling the depletion level of the Ca2+ stores. This inhibitory cascade of SHIP is shared by the FcγRIIB pathway despite the difference in the way for recruitment of SHIP. In B lymphocytes, accumulation of PIP3 via the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase was reported to stimulate Btk, which then phosphorylates PLCγ (18Scharenberg A.M. El-Hillal O. Fruman D.A.

Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). In other studies, accumulation of PIP3 was reported to lead to PH domain-mediated membrane targeting of PLCγ (29Bae Y.S. Cantley L.G. Chen C.S. Kim S.R. Kwon K.S. Rhee S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 4465-4469Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar, 30Falasca M. Logan S.K. Lehto V.P. Baccante G. Lemmon M.A. Schlessinger J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 414-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (488) Google Scholar). In either case, PIP3functions as a potent activator of PLCγ. Therefore, degradation of PIP3 by SHIP is expected to inhibit PLCγ and hence Ca2+ release from the Ca2+ stores. We now show direct evidence that IP3 production in BCR-mediated signaling is enhanced in SHIP-deficient cells (Fig. 3). In FcγRIIB-mediated inhibitory signaling, SHIP was implicated not only in IP3 production but also in the inhibition of SOC, or store depletion-induced Ca2+ influx (11Ono M. Bolland S. Tempst P. Ravetch J.V. Nature. 1996; 383: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (648) Google Scholar, 13Ono M. Okada H. Bolland S. Yanagi S. Kurosaki T. Ravetch J.V. Cell. 1997; 90: 293-301Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (416) Google Scholar). We, therefore, examined the effects of SHIP on Ca2+ influx elicited after BCR activation, and found that Ca2+ influx in SHIP-deficient cells was indeed greater than that in control cells (Fig. 4). SOC has been postulated to be a mechanism of Ca2+influx in B lymphocytes, as is the case in other nonexcitable cells (4Parekh A.B. Penner R. Physiol.

Thus, we also examined the effect of SHIP on SOC after store depletion by thapsigargin, which is a potent inhibitor of SERCA and depletes the Ca2+ stores without IP3 production (28Zweifach A. Lewis R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 6295-6299Crossref PubMed Scopus (697) Google Scholar). However, thapsigargin-induced SOC was not affected by the presence of SHIP either with or without BCR cross-linking (Fig. 5). These results clearly indicate that SHIP does not have a direct inhibitory effect on either SOC channel activity or the SOC activation mechanism itself in BCR-mediated signaling. Then, how did SHIP inhibit the Ca2+ influx after BCR stimulation? The activation of SOC was shown to be regulated by the level of depletion the Ca2+ stores (32Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 140: 325-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 34Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19554-19559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). We therefore postulated that the effect of SHIP on Ca2+ influx resulted from the difference in the extent of Ca2+ store depletion in control and SHIP-deficient cells after BCR cross-linking. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated the amount of Ca2+ remaining in the Ca2+ stores after BCR cross-linking. In SHIP-deficient cells, the amount of Ca2+ remaining in the stores was much smaller than that in control cells (Fig. 6). The results indicate that SHIP causes early termination of Ca2+ release making SOC activation minimal in normal BCR signaling. On the other hand, the Ca2+ stores were likely to be depleted enough to activate SOC in thapsigargin-treated cells and in BCR-stimulated SHIP-deficient cells. A similar inhibitory cascade after FcγRIIB co-cross-linking was shown recently (20Fluckiger A. Li Z. Kato P.M. Wahl M.I. Ochs H.D. Longnecker R. Kinet J.P. Witte O.N. Scharenberg A.M. Rawlings D.J. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1973-1985Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). The differential effects of SHIP on Ca2+ influx elicited by BCR cross-linking and SOC elicited by thapsigargin could also be accounted for by postulating two independent Ca2+ influx pathways: the BCR-regulated and SHIP-sensitive influx, and the thapsigargin-elicited and SHIP-insensitive pathways. However, this possibility can be readily ruled out. If this were the case, cells treated with both BCR cross-linking and thapsigargin would allow Ca2+ influx via both components. The total Ca2+influx should also be affected by SHIP as a result from the effect on the SHIP-sensitive Ca2+ influx. However, reintroduction of Ca2+ elicited the same extent of Ca2+ influx in control and SHIP-deficient cells (Fig. 5, D andE), arguing against the hypothesis. This conclusion was supported by the results obtained from the DT40 cells in which all three subtype genes of the IP3 receptor were disrupted. In these IP3 receptor-deficient cells, there was no Ca2+ response to BCR stimulation, although thapsigargin-elicited Ca2+ increase was clearly observed (31Sugawara H. Kurosaki M. Takata M. Kurosaki T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 3078-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). These results suggest the absence of a Ca2+ influx pathway other than the SOC in BCR signaling in DT40 cells. SHIP has been found in a variety of hematopoietic cells other than B cells and may play a role in cell signaling in these cells (21Crowley M.T. Harmer S.L. DeFranco A.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1145-1152Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar, 35Liu L. Damen J.E. Cutler R.L. Krystal G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6926-6935Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). For example, SHIP may be involved in thrombin-induced platelet activation (36Liu Q. Shalaby F. Jones J. Bouchard D. Dumont D.J. Blood. 1998; 91: 2753-2759Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 37Giuriato S. Payrastre B. Drayer A.L. Plantavid M. Woscholski R. Parker P. Erneux C. Chap H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 26857-26863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In FcεRI-stimulated RBL-2H3 cells, SHIP was reported to be phosphorylated and recruited to the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif of FcεRI (38Kimura T. Sakamoto H. Appella E. Siraganian R.P. Osborne M.A. Zenner G. Lubinus M. Zhang X. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Majerus P. Burn P. Kochan J.P. J. Biol.

Therefore, it will be important to examine whether SHIP plays the same inhibitory role in Ca2+signaling in different cell types as shown here in B cells. Accumulating evidence suggests that the cellular responses are more often controlled by the temporal pattern of Ca2+mobilization than by the peak or average levels of [Ca2+]i (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar, 34Huang Y. Putney Jr., J.W. J. Biol.

Although the mechanism underlying the Ca2+ mobilization pattern-mediated control of cell function is not fully understood, the temporal pattern of [Ca2+]iincrease has been implicated in the differential activation of subsets of proteins and/or genes due to different Ca2+-mediated activation kinetics. Our present finding indicates that the Ca2+ mobilization is curtailed by the inhibition of IP3 production by SHIP activity during BCR stimulation. Because the extent of activation of SOC steeply depends on the extent of Ca2+ store depletion (32Parekh A.B. Fleig A. Penner R. Cell. 1997; 89: 973-980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar, 33Hofer A.M. Fasolato C. Pozzan T. J.

Expression of this enzyme is regulated by glucocorticoids, which induce a high level of glutamine synthetase in neural but not in various non-neural tissues. This is despite the fact that non-neural cells express functional glucocorticoid receptor molecules capable of inducing other target genes. Sequencing and functional analysis of the upstream region of the glutamine synthetase gene identified, 5′ to the glucocorticoid response element (GRE), a 21-base pair glutamine synthetase silencer element (GSSE), which showed considerable homology with the neural restrictive silencer element NRSE. The GSSE was able to markedly repress the induction of gene transcription by glucocorticoids in non-neural cells and in embryonic neural retina. The repressive activity of the GSSE could be conferred on a heterologous GRE promoter and was orientation- and position-independent with respect to the transcriptional start site, but appeared to depend on a location proximal to the GRE. Gel-shift assays revealed that non-neural cells and cells of early embryonic retina contain a high level of GSSE binding activity and that this level declines progressively with age. Our results suggest that the GSSE might be involved in the restriction of glutamine synthetase induction by glucocorticoids to differentiated neural tissues.

Biol. 1987; 7: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). High levels of GS expression are restricted to glial cells (1Grossman R. Fox L.E. Gorovits R. Ben-Dror I. Reisfeld S. Vardimon Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 3Linser P. Moscona A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moscona A.A. Dev. Brain Res. 1981; 1: 103-119Crossref Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and are essential for the recycling of the neurotransmitter glutamate. Synaptically released glutamate is taken up into glial cells, where it is converted by GS into glutamine, which re-enters the neurons and is hydrolyzed by glutaminase to form glutamate again (6Van-den-Berg C.J. Lajtha A. Handbook of Neurochemistry. Plenum, New York1970: 355-379Google Scholar, 7Kennedy A.J. Voaden M.J. Marshall J. Nature. 1974; 252: 50-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). In this way, the neurotransmitter pool is replenished and glutamate neurotoxicity is prevented. Studies in the chicken neural retina showed that GS expression is regulated by systemic glucocorticoids, which induce in this tissue a very high level of GS by directly stimulating the transcription of the gene (8Vardimon L.

The ability of glucocorticoids to induce GS expression is developmentally controlled. Glucocorticoids can induce a high level of GS expression in neural retina at late embryonic ages, but not in early embryonic retina (2Patejunas G. Young A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1070-1077Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Vardimon L. Fox L.E. Moscona A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Moscona A.A. Differentiation. 1979; 13: 165-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). The direct involvement of glucocorticoids in the control of GS gene transcription is evidenced by the nuclear run-on transcription assay, as well as by the finding that the upstream region of the GS gene contains a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) that can bind the glucocorticoid receptor protein and confer responsiveness to glucocorticoids on an attached reporter gene (8Vardimon L. Fox L.E. Degenstein L. Moscona A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5981-5985Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar, 9Gorovits R. Yakir A. Fox L.E. Vardimon L. Brain Res. Mol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 24332-24338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This mode of regulation, which is dependent on the presence of active glucocorticoid receptor molecules, explains the cell type specificity of GS expression in the neural retina; GS expression is always restricted to Müller glial cells, which are the only cells in the tissue that express a detectable level of the glucocorticoid receptor protein (1Grossman R. Fox L.E. Gorovits R. Ben-Dror I. Reisfeld S. Vardimon Brain Res. Mol. Brain Res. 1994; 21: 312-320Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 16Gorovits R. Ben-Dror I. Fox L.E. Westphal H.M. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4786-4790Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). It does not, however, explain why various non-neural cells, which contain functional glucocorticoid receptor molecules capable of inducing other target genes, are not responsive to the hormone and express only low levels of GS. Neural-specific gene expression is often achieved by the action of negative transcriptional regulation. A prominent example is the neural restrictive silencer element (NRSE/RE-1) found in the regulatory regions of a number of genes expressed exclusively in the nervous system, including SCG10 (17Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), type II sodium channel (NaII) (18Kraner S.D. Chong J.A. Tsay H.J.

Changeux Neuroscience. 1995; 69: 807-819Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), the muscarinic M4 receptor (21Wood I.C. Roopra A. Buckley N.J. J. Biol.

Chem. 1995; 270: 21291-21298Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). This element binds to a zinc-finger transcriptional repressor protein known as neural restrictive silencer factor (NRSF; Ref. 24Schoenherr C.J. Anderson D.J. Science. 1995; 267: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (932) Google Scholar) or RE-1-silencing transcription factor (REST; Ref. 25Chong J.A. Tapia-Ramirez J. Kim S. Toledo A.J. Zheng Y. Boutros M.C. Altshuller Y.M. Frohman M.A. Kraner S.D. Mandel G. Cell. 1995; 80: 949-957Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (934) Google Scholar), which is ubiquitously expressed in non-neural tissues and in neuronal precursors of the central nervous system. Experiments involving targeted mutation of the NRSF-encoding gene or inhibition of NRSF by a dominant negative form of the protein indicated that NRSF is required in vivo to repress neural genes in non-neural or in undifferentiated neural tissues (26Chen Z.F. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 136-142Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar). In the present study, we demonstrate that the regulatory region of the GS gene contains a NRSE-like element, and that this element can repress the induction of gene transcription by glucocorticoids. Our results suggest that a neural restrictive silencing activity may be directly involved in the repression of GS induction in non-neural tissues and in the prevention of precocious expression of GS in early embryonic neural retina. A set of plasmids containing complementary regions of the GS upstream sequence from +13 to −2899 was prepared by subcloning the genomic GS clone λGS113 (11Vardimon L. Fox L.E. Moscona A.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 9060-9064Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) into the pBluescript SK+ vector (Stratagene). The sequence was determined by the chain termination method (27Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar) using the Sequenase II kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). Both strands were sequenced using a series of oligonucleotide primers. To construct chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) vectors that are controlled by the upstream sequence of the GS gene, the coding region of CAT was excised withClaI from pSVO-CAT (28Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar) and ligated into theClaI site in the linker region of Bluescript clones containing the following GS upstream sequences: +13 to −1725 (1.7 GS); +13 to −2117 (2.1 GS); +13 to −2375 (2.3 GS); +13 to −2821 (2.8 GS). The constructs 2.4 GS and 2.5 GS were generated by deletion using the Erase-a-Base System (Promega) as follows; the 2.8 GS construct was first linearized with KpnI, which generates a 3′ overhang, and with SalI, which generates a 5′ overhang, both cleaving in the linker region of the vector, 5′ to the GS sequence, and thus ensuring the correct direction of the deletion process. Linearized DNA was digested with exonuclease III (30 units/μg DNA) for up to 6 min. Aliquots were taken at 30-s intervals, added to solution containing S1 nuclease (6 units/μg DNA), and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The series of nuclease-digested DNAs were ligated by T4 ligase and transfected into bacterial cells. Colonies were analyzed by the colony PCR procedure (29Dieffenbach C.W. Dveksler G.S. PCR Primer: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995Google Scholar), which allows determination of the size of the cloned fragment. The 21-bp sequence in the 2.3 GS construct (2.3 Δ 21GS) was deleted by PCR amplification, using oligonucleotides that correspond to the appropriate 5′ and 3′ sequences and contain restriction sites for recloning into 2.3 GS. The deletion was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. The construct GRE-TK was derived from pG46TCO (14Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). It contains two copies of the GRE sequence linked to the TK-CAT fusion gene. To generate the 258-GRE-TK construct, the 258 fragment (−2375 to −2117) was excised from 2.3 GS with ApaI andSacI, blunt-ended with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and ligated into the similarly blunted HindIII andAccI sites of GRE-TK. Orientation was confirmed by restriction enzyme analysis. Complementary oligonucleotides were synthesized (sense strand shown), containing one (AGCTTGAGCACCGCGGTCCTCCAG) or two (GAGCTCTGCACTTGAGCACCGCGGTCCTCCAGCTTCTGCTCTGCACTTGAGCACCGCGGTCCTCCAGCTTCT) copies of the 21-bp GSSE sequence or two copies of the NRSE sequence of the SCG10 gene (CAAAGCCATTTCAGCACCACGGAGAGTGCCTCTGCCAAAGCCATTTCAGCACCACGGAGAGTGCCTCTGCAG) (17Mori N. Schoenherr C. Vandenbergh D.J. Anderson D.J. Neuron. 1992; 9: 45-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotides containing a single copy of the GSSE were constructed such that, when annealed, they contained AccI and HindIII cohesive ends, while oligonucleotides containing two copies of the GSSE or NRSE were constructed such that, when annealed, they contained blunt ends. The construct GSSE-GRE-TK was generated by insertion of the oligonucleotides containing a single copy of the GSSE into HindIII- and AccI-restricted GRE-TK. The oligonucleotides containing two copies of the GSSE were ligated into the blunted HindIII site of GRE-TK to generate GSSE2-GRE-TK and ESSG2-GRE-TK or into SmaI-restricted GRE-TK to generate FGSSE2-GRE-TK. The oligonucleotides containing two copies of the NRSE were ligated into the blunted HindIII site of GRE-TK to generate NRSE2-GRE-TK. Orientation was confirmed by restriction enzymes or DNA sequence analysis. The luciferase reporter gene RSVL(SEL) (30de-Wet J. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) and the GR expression vector p6RGR (31Miesfeld R. Rusconi S. Godowski P.J. Maler B.A. Okret S. Wikstrom A.C. Gustafsson J.A.

Plasmid DNA was prepared using the Qiagen plasmid preparation kit. Retinal tissue was isolated under sterile conditions from eyes of chicken embryos (White Leghorn) at day 10 of embryonic development (E10). The tissue was organ-cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal calf serum on a gyratory shaker at 38 °C. Plasmid DNA was transfected into pieces of intact retinal tissue by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser with voltage and capacitance settings of 400 V and 960 microfarads, respectively, as described (32Berko-Flint Y. Levkowitz G. Vardimon L. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 646-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Following electroporation, retinas transfected in the same cuvette were placed in two Erlenmeyer flasks and cultured for 24 or 48 h in the absence or presence of 0.33 μg/ml cortisol (Sigma). HeLa and C6 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. PC-12 cells were grown in DMEM with 8% fetal calf serum and 8% horse serum. The cells were grown in six-well plates and transfected with DNA using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Following transfection, the cells were incubated for 24 h with or without 0.33 μg/ml cortisol. CAT and luciferase activities were determined in tissue sonicates. CAT activity was determined as described (28Gorman C.M. Moffat L.F. Howard B.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1044-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (5292) Google Scholar). In all experiments, the CAT assay was adjusted to include an equal amount of luciferase activity originating from co-transfected RSVL(SEL). CAT activity was determined by scanning of the TLC plates with a PhosphorImager Instrument and TINA version 2.07d software, and calculation of the percentage of substrate (chloramphenicol) converted to the acetylated products. Luciferase activity was assayed as described (30de-Wet J. Wood K.V. DeLuca M. Helinski D.R. Subramani S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 725-737Crossref PubMed Scopus (2482) Google Scholar) and recorded by a LKB luminometer (LKB, Rockville, MD). Nuclear extracts were prepared from HeLa, C6, and PC12 monolayer cells at 80% confluence according to Lee et al.(33Lee K.A. Bindereif A. Green M.R. Gene Anal. Tech. 1988; 5: 22-31Crossref PubMed Scopus (394) Google Scholar) with minor modifications. Briefly, cells were harvested using a rubber policeman and washed in 30 volumes of ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. The packed cell volume was determined by pelleting for 5 min at 1200 × g. Packed cells were resuspended in the equivalent of two packed cell volumes of buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 1 mm dithiothreitol (DTT)) and allowed to swell on ice for 15 min. Cells were then lysed by five strokes through a 25-gauge needle or by five strokes of pestle A and five strokes of pestle B in a Dounce homogenizer. The cell homogenate was then centrifuged for 20 s in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge (12,000 × g), and the crude nuclear pellet was resuspended in the equivalent of one packed cell volume of buffer C (20 mmHEPES pH 7.9, 25% glycerol, 0.42 m NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT), followed by incubation on ice with stirring for 30 min. The nuclear debris was then pelleted by spinning for 5 min at 12,000 × g, and the supernatant (nuclear extract) was divided into aliquots and quick-frozen by dry ice with ethanol. The extracts were stored at −70 °C. Retinal cell extracts were similarly prepared, except for the following differences. The tissue was lysed by homogenization by means of five strokes of pestle A and five strokes of pestle B in a Dounce homogenizer. The nuclear extract was prepared from the nuclear crude pellet in two steps: the nuclei were suspended in the equivalent of one packed cell volume of low salt buffer C (20 mmHEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10 mmKCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT), followed by slow addition of the equivalent of a half packed cell volume of high salt buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.6 m KCl, 25% glycerol, 0.5 mm PMSF, and 1 mm DTT). Protein concentration in the nuclear extracts was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). Gel mobility shift assays were performed in a 20-μl final volume of reaction buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 1 mm DTT, 2.5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mg/ml poly(dI-dC). Equal amounts of nuclear extracts (5–10 μg) were added to the reaction buffer and preincubated with or without DNA competitors for 10 min on ice. End-labeled DNA probes (about 2 × 104cpm/reaction) were added, followed by incubation for 15 min at room temperature. The samples were resolved on a 5% nondenaturating acrylamide gel in 0.25 × TBE for 2 h at 70 V. The gels were dried and exposed for 18 h at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Oligonucleotides used for competition or end-labeled and used as DNA probes were those used for cloning (see above): double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two copies of the GSSE, double-stranded oligonucleotide containing two copies of the NRSE, the sense strand of the oligonucleotide containing two copies of the NRSE (single-stranded DNA probe), and nonspecific double-stranded oligonucleotide derived from a mutated octamer-binding sequence (34Moran D. Galperin E. Horowitz M. Gene (Amst.). 1997; 194: 201-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). The nucleotide sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the GS gene (−1 to −2657) has been determined by others (15Zhang H.Y. Young A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24332-24338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and by us (Fig. 1 A) using genomic clones isolated from two independent libraries of White Leghorn chicken. Comparison of the two sequences revealed a considerable number of sequence differences, including substitutions, insertions, and deletions. The most striking phenomenon, however, was the fact that these sequence changes were not evenly distributed along the DNA, but rather were concentrated in two distinct regions. Of 38 sequence changes, 19 were located in the region between −868 and −1700 (region 2 in Fig. 1 B) and 17 in the region between −2287 and −2657 (region 4 in Fig. 1 B). The region proximal to the transcriptional start site, from −1 to −868 (region 1 in Fig.1 B), contained only two sequence differences, while in the more distal region, between −1700 and −2287, no change was detected (region 3 in Fig. 1 B). This dramatic variation in the rate of mutational events among the different DNA regions correlated with two other sequence parameters, attributed to differential selective constraints: G+C content and the ratio (observed to expected) of the dinucleotide CG (35Bulmer M. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 395-405PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in TableI, the DNA regions 2 and 4, which contain a high ratio of sequence changes, were found to have a significantly lower G+C content and CG dinucleotide ratio than the DNA regions 1 and 3, which contain few sequence changes or none at all. In light of the fact that differential selective constraints can often distinguish between functional and functionless DNA (36Kimura M. The Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge1983Crossref Google Scholar, 37Sharp P.M. Li W.H. Mol. Biol. Evol. 1987; 4: 222-230PubMed Google Scholar), this finding raised the possibility that the regulatory elements of the GS gene are predominantly located in regions 1 and 3 and not in regions 2 and 4.Table INumber of mutational events, G+C content, and CG dinucleotide ratio in the different regions of the GS upstream sequenceRegionNo. of mutational eventsG+C contentCG ratioObs:expDeviation from exp%%126347:86452195619:6370306441:5930417554:2885The number of mutational events in each DNA region (see Fig. 1) was calculated by considering changes of several adjacent nucleotides as one mutational event.

The percentage of deviation from expected is calculated according to the formula: 100 × (observed − expected)/expected. In order to learn whether differential selective constraints reflect the location of regulatory elements, we decided to focus on regions 3 and 4, which represent a highly conserved and a highly mutated DNA region, respectively (Fig. 1 B). Region 3 has been already shown to contain two functional elements that are directly involved in the responsiveness of the GS gene to glucocorticoids: a glucocorticoid response element (GRE) at −2086 to −2100 (14Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 15Zhang H.Y. Young A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24332-24338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and an AP1/ATF/CRE-like site at −2110 to −2117 (15Zhang H.Y. Young A.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24332-24338Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Ben-Or S. Okret S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To determine whether the sequence located in region 4 might also contain regulatory functions, we generated a construct containing 2.8 kb (2.8 GS) of 5′-flanking region of the GS gene fused to the reporter gene CAT. Constructs of the GS upstream region, which contain (2.1 GS) or lack (1.7 GS) the GRE sequence, were used as a control. The various constructs were transfected into E10 retina and the ability of cortisol to induce CAT expression was assayed (Fig.2). In all experiments, the measured CAT activity was normalized to the luciferase activity derived from a co-transfected internal control plasmid RSVL(SEL) to correct for differences in transfection efficiency. As expected, the 1.7 GS construct, which does not contain the GRE sequence, was not inducible by cortisol, whereas the 2.1 GS construct, which contains the GRE, was highly inducible. Analysis of the 2.8 GS construct revealed that the sequence further upstream of the GRE contains a putative regulatory element that can markedly repress the hormonal response. To identify this apparent silencing element, we generated a series of constructs containing varying lengths of the upstream sequence and tested their expression. Partial or complete deletion of the 5′-most 0.6 kb did not diminish the repressive effect. These data therefore localized the repressive activity to a 258-bp domain lying immediately upstream of the GRE site. The repressive activity of this 258-bp domain was not restricted to the retinal tissue, but was also exerted in HeLa cells. In these cells, however, inducibility of the GS promoter constructs was dependent on co-transfection of a glucocorticoid receptor expression vector. As in the retina, cortisol induced a marked increase in CAT activity in HeLa cells transfected with the 2.1 GS construct, but not in those transfected with either the 2.8 or the 2.3 GS construct (Fig.3). By visual inspection of the 258-bp domain, we identified a sequence of 21 nucleotides with considerable homology (13/21) to the consensus sequence of the NRSE (39Schoenherr C.J. Paquette A.J. Anderson D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 9881-9886Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar). This element is found in the regulatory region of several neural-specific genes and represses their expression in non-neural cells. To determine whether this sequence is responsible for the observed repression of the GS promoter activity, we examined whether an internal deletion of the 21-bp sequence, in the context of the 2.3 GS construct, eliminates the silencing activity. Our results clearly demonstrated that deletion of the 21-bp sequence from the 2.3 GS construct (2.3 Δ 21GS) resulted in almost complete elimination of the silencing activity in both HeLa (Fig. 3) and embryonic retinal cells (data not shown), indicating that this sequence represents a functional silencer element. The location of this 21-bp sequence, between −2176 and −2196, is within region 3 of the GS upstream sequence, the region which also contains other regulatory elements and in which no mutational events were identified. In contrast, region 4, which contains a high ratio of mutational events, did not show any significant regulatory activity. These findings suggest that the distribution of mutational events along the upstream sequence of the GS gene reflects the location of DNA elements involved in gene control. They also indicate that the regulatory region of the GS gene includes, in addition to positive regulatory elements, a silencing element that can repress the hormonal response. To further characterize the functional properties of the 21-bp GSSE, we examined its ability to confer negative control upon a heterologous glucocorticoid-regulated promoter. The 258-bp domain (258-GRE-TK) or the 21-bp sequence (GSSE-GRE-TK) was fused immediately upstream of a “minimal” GRE-TK promoter, which contains two copies of a synthetic GRE sequence and is linked to the reporter gene CAT (14Ben-Dror I. Havazelet N. Vardimon L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 1117-1121Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). The constructs were transfected into HeLa cells, and their activity in the presence or absence of cortisol was assessed. The 258-bp domain and the 21-"

Two noncrystallographic methods (a new molecular docking program and 1H NMR spectroscopy) have been used to study the electron transfer complex formed between the cytochrome c peroxidase (CCP) ofParacoccus denitrificans and cytochromes c. For the natural redox partner, cytochrome c 550, the results are consistent with a complex in which the heme of a single cytochrome lies above the exposed electron-transferring heme of the peroxidase. In contrast, two molecules of the nonphysiological but kinetically competent horse cytochrome bind between the two hemes of the peroxidase. These dramatically different patterns are consistent with a redox active surface on the peroxidase that may accommodate more than one cytochrome and allow lateral mobility. Efficient biological electron transfer may require a fluid association of redox partners.

These dramatically different patterns are consistent with a redox active surface on the peroxidase that may accommodate more than one cytochrome and allow lateral mobility. Our knowledge of the factors influencing electron transfer between biological redox partners remains sketchy. Important insights have come from the co-crystallization of redox partners (1Pelletier H. Kraut J. Science. 1992; 258: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar, 2Chen L. Durley R.C.E. Mathews F.S. Davidson V.L. Science. 1994; 264: 86-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), but the nagging doubt remains that such crystalline complexes at best represent only one of a number of productive orientations or, at worst, a nonproductive association. Co-crystallography of biological molecules has at its heart the assumption that a single true native complex exists in a deep energy minimum that is selected for under crystallization conditions. However, a picture is now emerging of a biological strategy for electron transfer that involves rate enhancement by a “reduction of dimensions” to form an encounter complex that is fluid enough to allow lateral mobility and search for a productive electron transfer orientation. According to this scenario, although global electrostatic forces may enhance the initial collision, specific complementary interactions that are too strong may compromise the fluidity required to allow lateral search and also may hinder the dissociation of the oxidized product (3Northrup S.H. Boles J.O. Reynolds J.C.L. Science. 1988; 241: 67-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar, 4Erman J.E. Kreschek G.C. Vitello L.B.

The best studied biological electron transfer complex is that between yeast CCP 1The abbreviations used are: CCP, cytochromec peroxidase; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: CCP, cytochromec peroxidase; Mes, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. and cytochromec. Reaction with hydrogen peroxide yields a peroxidase with two oxidizing equivalents in the form of a Trp-191 radical (X+, in Fig. 1 A) and a ferryl oxene heme (5Bosshard H.R. Anni H. Yoentani T. Everse J. Everse K.E. Grisham M.B. Peroxidases in Chemistry and Biology. 2. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 52-78Google Scholar). There has been a long running (and still not fully resolved) debate as to whether re-reduction of these sites occurs by a single pathway from a single binding site at which successive cytochromes c bind (6Waldmeyer B.

Hoffman B.M. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 10848-10865Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The balance of evidence seems to favor the former (which is shown in Fig. 1 A), according to which each electron tunnels from the exposed edge of a bound cytochromec heme along the backbone of Ala-194, Ala-193, and Gly-192 to Trp-191 as deduced from the co-crystallization study of Pelletier and Kraut (1Pelletier H. Kraut J. Science. 1992; 258: 1748-1755Crossref PubMed Scopus (707) Google Scholar). The focus of our work has been a CCP from Paracoccus denitrificans. Previous work on this diheme enzyme (12Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Pettigrew G.W. Prazeres S. Moura I. Moura J.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and its relative from Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13Foote N. Peterson J. Gadsby P.M.A. Greenwood C. Thomson A.J. Biochem. J. 1984; 223: 369-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 14Ellfolk N. Ronnberg M. Aasa R. Andreasson L.E. Vanngard T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 784: 62-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) showed that one of the two hemes (E heme, in Fig. 1 B) acts in an electron transferring role, whereas the other (P heme) is the peroxidatic center. Thus the electron-transferring heme functions like Trp-191 in the monoheme yeast enzyme but an important difference is that it is exposed at the molecular surface rather than buried. Re-reduction of the oxidized enzyme requires two electrons delivered from the monoheme cytochrome c 550 (15Pettigrew G.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 25-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Although this cytochrome is present in a monomer:dimer equilibrium in solution, we have shown that it is the monomer that binds to the peroxidase (16Pettigrew G.W. Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Hunter D.J.B. Devreese B. van Beeumen J. Costa C. Prazeres S. Krippahl L. Palma P.N. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Eur. J. Biochem. 1998; 258: 559-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c 550 is a close relative of mitochondrial cytochrome c and has a pronounced charge asymmetry with a positive front surface surrounding an exposed heme edge at which its proposed attachment to a negative surface of the peroxidase occurs (16Pettigrew G.W. Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Hunter D.J.B. Devreese B. van Beeumen J. Costa C. Prazeres S. Krippahl L. Palma P.N. Moura I. Moura J.J.G. Eur. J.

Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7958-7966Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The model of Fig. 1 B indicates that there are a number of ways in which re-reduction of the peroxidase might be achieved which involve different binding sites for the cytochrome and different electron transfer routes. Here, we use simulation of molecular docking and 1H NMR spectroscopy to evaluate these possibilities. The protein coordinates of P. aeruginosa cytochrome c 551 (18Matsuura Y. Takano T. Dickerson R.E.

Higher resolution coordinates for the cytochrome c 550 (1cot.pdb) were kindly provided by H. Holden (University of Wisconsin) (21Benning M.M. Meyer T.E. Holden H.M. Arch. Biochem.

The1cot.pdb coordinates for the cytochrome c 550lack the N-terminal 2 residues and the C-terminal 13 residues. Those missing coordinates were grafted on to the 1cot.pdb file from 155c.pdb to create a full-length cytochrome c 550 from the strain LMD 22.21. This sequence was mutated in Sybyl (Tripos Associates) to correspond to the cytochrome c 550from strain LMD 52.44 (21 differences, see Ref. 16Pettigrew G.W. Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Hunter D.J.B.

The CCP fromP. aeruginosa was mutated in Sybyl to correspond to the protein from P. denitrificans strain 52.44 (61% identity). The molecular interaction simulations were performed with the docking program BIGGER. 2N. Palma, L. Krippahl, and J. Moura, unpublished results. This algorithm performs a complete and systematic search of the rotational space of one protein relative to the other, generating a large number of candidate docking geometries based solely on the complementarity of the molecular surfaces. This initial pre-filter of solutions was required to make the computation of a more complete set of energies of interaction manageable. The 1000 best solutions thus generated were finally evaluated and ranked according to a combination of additional interaction criteria that included electrostatic energy of interaction, relative solvation energy and the relative propensity of adjacent side chains to interact. This program has been shown to successfully predict the structure of a wide range of known protein:protein complexes (such as the homodimer of HIV-2 protease and the association of proteases with peptide protease inhibitors).2 We have implemented a routine for computation of the minimum pathlength between any two atoms of two interacting proteins based on the algorithm of Betts et al. (23Betts J.N. Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4043-4046Crossref Scopus (124) Google Scholar) and the tunneling pathway model of Beratan et al. (24Beratan D.N. Onuchic J.N. Hopfield J.J. J. Chem. Phys. 1987; 86: 4488-4498Crossref Scopus (286) Google Scholar). The effective pathlength is the sum of the effective distances each defined as a −log (decay factor) for a particular segment of the path (covalent bond, hydrogen bond, through-space). In our implementation, the effective distance of the path segment at the intermolecular gap is set to zero to avoid undue influence of slight conformational adjustments at the interface that cannot be accommodated by the rigid body docking method used. We should note however that the size of this gap and its control by subtle movements of amino acid side chains in the complex are likely to be crucial influences on electron transfer rates. High resolution 1H NMR spectra were recorded in the Fourier transform mode on a Bruker ARX-400 spectrometer (400 MHz). Data were recorded at 299 K, and 2000 transients were acquired from each spectrum. To improve signal-to-noise ratio, an exponential multiplication by 10 Hz line broadening of the free induction decay was applied prior to Fourier transform. All chemical shifts are quoted in parts per million (ppm) from internal 3-trimethylsilyl [2,2,3,3 2H4]propionate; positive values refer to low field shifts. Protein samples were exchanged several times with 10 mm Mes, pH 6.0, in D2O by centrifugation in a Centricon microconcentrator (Amicon) Figs. 2and 3 represent the results of docking simulations between Paracoccus CCP and Paracoccuscytochrome c 550 (panels A), horse cytochrome c (panels B), andPseudomonas cytochrome c 551(panels C). Each monoheme cytochrome was rotated and translated against the molecular surface of the peroxidase, and at each stage the docked complex was evaluated for favorable interactions. The small acidic cytochrome c 551is not oxidized by the Paracoccus CCP and was used as a negative control.Figure 3The side view of docking of cytochromes toParacoccus CCP. The docking results described in Fig. 2 are viewed from the side of the cytochrome cperoxidase looking down at the exposed edge of the electron-transferring heme group. In all three experiments, the 500 most favorable solutions are shown as individual unfilled circles marking the center of mass of the probe cytochrome. The top ten docking solutions are shown as black filled circles. The electron transferring heme group (E) and the peroxidatic heme group (P) are shown as space-filled andshaded gray. For clarity, only the nearest two hemes of the four heme CCP dimer are shown. The protein itself is not shown and would be contained within the oval perimeter of clustered solutions that marks the dimer interface. Because the CCP is a symmetrical dimer, related solutions will be found at both “sides,” and for simplicity, these have been combined and they all appear on the single surface facing us.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The most favored docking solutions are represented by their heme groups in the front view of Fig. 2 and by black filled circles in the side view of Fig. 3. In the case of the cytochromec 550:CCP binding simulation (A), six of the top ten ranking solutions (including the top solution) belong to a tight cluster in which the cytochrome c 550lies close to the E heme of the peroxidase. In this position, the distance between the iron of the cytochrome c and the iron atom of the CCP heme E is 15–16 Å. The top ranking solution is shown in Fig. 4 A. Although there is a second cluster of solutions with cytochromec 550 lying between the E and P hemes of the peroxidase, none of them scores within the high ranking group (the highest rank in that position is 17th).The remaining four of the top ten ranking solutions are situated at the “back” of the molecule and are not visible in Fig. 2 but are partly visible in the ring of solutions in Fig. 3 A, which lie in the dimer interface. As discussed below these are electronically poorly coupled, and we regard them as artifacts of the docking procedure (see “Discussion”). In contrast, in the case of the horse cytochrome c:CCP binding simulation, six of the top ten ranking solutions (including the top three themselves) cluster the cytochrome c between the E and P hemes of the peroxidase (Figs. 2 B and 3 B). In this position, the distance between the iron of cytochromec and the iron atoms of either of the CCP hemes is 21–26 Å. The top ranking solution is shown in Fig. 4 B. In this simulation, the horse cytochrome c shows little tendency to dock onto the peroxidase above the E heme (there is a single solution at that position, and it was ranked 12th). Again there are four of the top ten ranking solutions situated at the dimer interface and these are partly visible as filled black circles in Fig.3 B. In the control docking simulation, cytochromec 551 showed almost no tendency to bind on the side surface of the CCP (Figs. 2 C and 3 C); the highest rank in that position was 53rd and, overall, the docking scores were significantly poorer than those obtained for the other two docking cases (see “Discussion”). In this case, the top ten ranked solutions appear in the dimer interface but at the front rather than the back of the dimer (Fig. 3 C) in a dip in the molecular surface large enough to accommodate the smaller cytochromec 551. Electronic coupling can be assessed by calculation of the minimum “pathlength” for electron transfer within a docked geometry. In Fig.5, we show the correlation between the top ten docking solutions (unfilled symbols) and the best electronic coupling between the probe iron of the different cytochromes and the E heme of the peroxidase (filled symbols with no outline). In the case of cytochrome c 550(circles), five of the six solutions that have the most favorable docking above the E heme were also the most strongly coupled electronically (broken line box). The four docking solutions in the top ten that bound at the dimer interface (unfilled circles) were very poorly coupled electronically, a result which supports the conclusion that the docking at the dimer interface is an artifact of the docking simulation (see “Discussion”). Both docking and electron coupling are weaker for horse cytochromec (Fig. 5, squares). In addition, there is poorer correlation between docking strength and electron coupling. Although the best coupled geometries do involve “between-hemes” binding (with the exception of the single E heme binding solution), only one of the top ten best coupled solutions corresponds to a most favorable docking solution (single outlined and filled square in Fig. 5). Finally, for cytochromec 551, none of the top ten docking solutions (unfilled triangles) correspond to a top ten coupling solution (filled triangles with no outline). The complex formation betweenParacoccus peroxidase and the three different cytochromesc was independently studied by 1H NMR spectroscopy. The heme methyls of the c-type cytochromes are strongly downfield-shifted because of the influence of the unpaired electron in a d-orbital of the iron atom (25Keller R. Wuthrich K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 533: 195-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 26Timkovich R. Cork M.S. Taylor P.V. Biochemstry. 1984; 23: 3526-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Their chemical shift and linewidth are sensitive to the presence of bound redox partners. When cytochrome c 550 is titrated with Paracoccus CCP, the two most downfield-shifted heme methyls shift and broaden dramatically (Fig.6 A), effects that are reversed by addition of NaCl. A further indication of the strength of the effect is the shift of the methyl of the coordinating methionine of cytochromec 550 which moves from −17.4 to −16.6 ppm (Table I). The stoichiometry of thec 550:CCP complex is 1:1 (Fig. 6 C), and its complete dissociation requires greater than 300 mmNaCl (Fig. 6 A). In contrast, the perturbation by addition of CCP of the equivalent resonances of horse cytochrome c(assigned as heme methyls 8 and 3) is much less pronounced (Fig.7 A), and the upfield methionine methyl resonance is not shifted (Table I). The main effect is a broadening of the heme resonances rather than a shift, and the data are consistent with a stoichiometry of two cytochrome cto 1 CCP (Fig. 7 C). The complex is completely dissociated by 300 mm NaCl (not shown).Table IThe effect of complex formation on the chemical shifts of selected methyl resonancesFree+c 550ΔFree+HorsecΔParacoccus CCP heme methyls, effect of addition of cytochrome cMethyl (E heme)51.653.7+2.151.352.7+1.4Methyl (E heme)58.459.2+0.857.960.8+2.9Methyl (P heme)34.434.4034.434.40Methyl (P heme)23.923.9023.923.90Free+CCPΔCytochrome cheme methyls, effect of addition of Paracoccus CCPc 550 heme methyl 829.128.1−1.0c 550 heme methyl 328.731.2+2.5c 550 Met methyl−17.4−16.6+0.8Horse cheme methyl 835.535.0−0.5Horse c heme methyl 332.333.1+0.8Horse c Met methyl−24.9−24.8+0.1Free+YCCPΔCytochrome cheme methyls, effect of addition of yeast CCP (from Ref. 27Moench S.J.

Thecurved line is theoretical for a K d of 5 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The cytochrome c 551 appears to show binding, judging from the broadening of the methyl resonances, but these resonances experience no shift (Fig.8 A). The 1H NMR spectrum of the diheme Paracoccus CCP reflects the presence of two distinct sets of heme c methyls (12Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Pettigrew G.W. Prazeres S. Moura I. Moura J.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Those four most strongly downfield-shifted (50–60 ppm) are associated with the electron-transferring heme, whereas only two of the four methyls of the peroxidatic heme are visible in the spectra of Figs.6 B, 7 B, and 8 B (at 23.9 and 34.4 ppm). Additions of cytochrome c 550 or horse cytochromec to a CCP solution have no effect on the latter resonances and have different effects on those of the electron-transferring heme. Binding of the cytochrome c 550 causes a movement of +2.1 ppm in the resonance at 51.6 ppm and +0.8 ppm in the resonance at 58.4 ppm (Table I). The corresponding changes associated with the binding of horse cytochrome c are +1.4 and +2.9 ppm, respectively. The binding of cytochrome c 551does not cause any resonance shift (Fig. 8 B) The bulk of the solutions, each represented by an unfilled gray circlepositioned at the center of mass of the probe cytochrome (Figs. 2 and3), cluster in a perimeter at the dimer interface. We regard this as an artifact of the method used because a similar clustering is observed with a small protein that does not interact with the enzyme (Figs.2 C and 3 C). The extent of surface complementarity between the interacting molecules is the first criterion used to filter the billions of binding modes, blindly generated at the first stage. Most of these solutions are retained in the top ranked 1000 because of the increased possible surface contact for a small globular protein in a surface depression at the dimer interface on the peroxidase molecule. It is this effect that gives rise to the clustering of apparent docking solutions as a ring around the dimer in Figs. 2 and 3. Such solutions can appear highly ranked in the docking analysis but show poor electronic coupling. The docking program combines the individual energy components of the association into a “global score.” Although this cannot be expressed in absolute energy units, it can be used to compare different docking profiles. Thus the global scores of the top ten solutions for the cytochrome c 550 docking are in the range −71 to −80, those for the horse cytochrome c are in the range −63 to −71, and those for the negative control cytochromec 551 are in the range −52 to −59 (see thehorizontal axis in Fig. 5). These numbers indicate the relative strengths of the docked complexes and show that the most favored horse cytochrome c complex ranks below the top cytochrome c 550 complexes, and the most favored cytochrome c 551 “complex” ranks below the top ten horse cytochrome c complexes. The docking algorithm is not intended to point to one unique best solution but rather to present a reduced and manageable set of alternative binding modes which have a good probability of including a working model of the actual complex. Any independent information may be useful in validating or refuting individual docking models. All the high ranked solutions for both horse cytochrome c and cytochrome c 550 binding to the sides of the peroxidase dimer have the heme group of the probe facing inwards in the complex, as would be expected for a productive encounter complex. Because no constraints were placed on the docking method to achieve this, we believe that this observation supports the conclusion that the docking simulation is producing results relevant to the actual complex. For cytochrome c 550, this conclusion is also supported by the strong correlation between the best docking solutions and strong electron coupling. It is interesting that there is a weaker correlation in the case of horse cytochrome c. Although best docking and coupling is achieved by between-hemes orientation of the horse cytochrome c, the best docking solutions and best coupled solutions do not exactly correspond in structure except in one case. These results may suggest a less specific and more fluid interaction of the Paracoccus peroxidase with horse cytochrome c, a conclusion also suggested by the less tightly knit cluster of “between-hemes” solutions (Figs.2 B and 3 B). The methyl resonances previously assigned to the electron transferring heme (12Gilmour R. Goodhew C.F. Pettigrew G.W. Prazeres S. Moura I. Moura J.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 294: 745-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) are shifted in the presence of cytochrome c 550, whereas the methyl resonances of the peroxidatic heme are unaffected. This is consistent with a model in which electron entry into the peroxidase is at the electron-transferring heme. Also, for cytochromec 550, the strong reciprocal perturbations observed in the electron-transferring heme of the peroxidase and the heme of the cytochrome are consistent with the tight cluster of docking solutions placing the heme methyl 3 groups only 3 Å apart. For horse cytochrome c, the weaker and distinct reciprocal heme perturbations are consistent with the looser cluster of docking solutions positioned between the two heme groups. Both cytochromec 550 and horse cytochrome c have asymmetric charge distributions with positive binding surfaces that interact with a negative surface on the peroxidase. However this negative surface covers the entire side of the CCP molecule (17Hu W. Van Driesche G. Devreese B. Goodhew C.F. McGinnity D.F. Saunders N. Fulop V. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7958-7966Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), and the two small cytochromes preferentially bind to distinct locations on it. In our original diagram showing possible mechanisms of re-reduction, the cytochrome c 550 appears to play the role indicated by arrows 3 shown in Fig. 1, whereas the horse cytochrome c may conduct electrons via that indicated by arrows 2. It is not yet clear from the docking results how two horse cytochrome c molecules might be accommodated on the peroxidase surface. Although cytochrome c 551 seems to bind to theParacoccus CCP, this is not associated with shifts in heme methyl resonances of either partner. This is consistent with the kinetic incompetence of cytochrome c 551 as an electron donor and the lack of favorable docking to the side surface of the CCP. There are remarkable similarities here with studies on the yeast CCP. The resonance of heme methyl 3 is strongly downfield-shifted in yeast cytochrome c when it binds to the yeast peroxidase, whereas that of heme methyl 8 experiences a small upfield shift (27Moench S.J. Chroni S. Lou B.S. Erman J.E. Satterlee J.D. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 3661-3670Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Sukits S.F. Erman J.E. Satterlee J.D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 5251-5259Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Perturbations of the heme methyl resonances of horse cytochromec are much smaller (29Gupta R.K. Yonetani T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1973; 292: 502-508Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) and indeed can be mimicked by binding of polyglutamate (30Boswell A.P. McClune G.J. Moore G.R. Williams R.J.P. Pettigrew G.W. Inubishi T. Yonetani T. Harris D.E. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1980; 8: 637-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We found no change in the heme methyls on addition of polyglutamate to cytochrome c 550. However, polyglutamate also produced no inhibition of ferrocytochromec 550 oxidation by peroxidase (in contrast to its strong inhibition of horse cytochrome c oxidation), and therefore polyglutamate is probably unable to bind the cytochromec 550. We can conclude that the small perturbations observed on binding horse cytochrome c to either the yeast or the bacterial peroxidase are because of the effect of changes in surface electrostatic charge on the electron distribution in the iron d-orbital. The larger perturbations observed in the physiological redox partners on binding their respective peroxidase could, in principle, be because of the proximity of the paramagnetic iron of the peroxidase heme group. However, this seems unlikely as the iron-iron separation is 26 Å for the yeast system. More likely, therefore, is that the strong perturbations in both the Paracoccus and the yeast systems arise from specific movement of a charged side chain in the complex close to the heme methyl 3 group. The differences we see in the binding site and stoichiometry for the two kinetically competent electron donors is an intriguing result. This suggests that more than one pathway of electron transfer may have evolved to communicate with the protein surface of the peroxidase and that these pathways provide an opportunity for synchronous delivery of the two electrons required for restoration of the active enzyme (Fig.1). We should note a potential complication in our interpretation. We have studied the binding of the product ferricytochrome c to the oxidized peroxidase. Binding of the ferrocytochrome cannot be studied because its addition would result in prompt electron transfer to the E heme (a similar situation exists with the yeast peroxidase). A related problem is that the true binding partner for cytochromec 550 is the peroxidase intermediate in catalysis that carries two oxidizing equivalents. As yet, we do not know whether the conformation of this intermediate differs from that of the resting oxidized enzyme that we have worked with."

Homologous regions have been identified in the human vitamin D receptor (hVDR). Mutating Lys-386 to Ala (K386A) in hVDR significantly reduced binding to glutathione S-transferase-RXRα in solution, whereas binding of an I384R/Q385R VDR mutant was almost undetectable. The K386A mutant formed heterodimers with RXRα on DR-3 (a direct repeat of AGGTCA spaced by three nucleotides), whereas the I384R/Q385R mutant completely eliminated heterodimer formation. Wild type hVDR effected a 3-fold induction of DR-3-dependent thymidine kinase-luciferase activity in cultured neonatal rat atrial myocytes, an effect that was increased to 8–9-fold by cotransfected hRXRα. Induction by K386A, in the presence or absence of RXRα, was only slightly lower than that seen with wild type VDR. On the other hand, I384R/Q385R alone displayed no stimulatory activity and less than 2-fold induction in the presence of hRXRα. Qualitatively similar findings were observed with the negative regulation of the human atrial natriuretic peptide gene promoter by these mutants. Collectively, these studies identify specific amino acids in hVDR that play a critical role in heterodimer formation and subsequent modulation of gene transcription."

Plant cells utilize both HDEL and KDEL as ER retention sequences (35Herman E.M. Tague B.W. Hoffman L.M. Kjemtrup S.E. Chrispeels M.J.

A papain superfamily cysteine protease would appear to be an unusual putative constituent of the ER lumen, which is the site of glycosylation and folding in the initial steps of protein assembly. SH-EP is a general protein hydrolase whose activity is lytic and not a protein that would be expected to be retained in the ER lumen.

The necessary acid/reducing conditions for activation are available in the vacuolar lytic compartment (47Nishimura M. Plant Physiol. 1982; 70: 742-744Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and within secretory vesicles exiting the trans-Golgi; however, these conditions are absent in the ER lumen. Consequently, KDEL-mediated retention of SH-EP in the pre-Golgi endomembrane system would be expected to inhibit its processing and activation, resulting in the accumulation of the inactive precursor enzyme in the ER lumen.In this paper, we describe the processing of SH-EP expressed in Sf-9 cells. We demonstrate that although the proSH-EP is synthesized with a KDEL sequence, this sequence is posttranslationally removed from the proSH-EP. The proSH-EP without KDEL is subsequently processed to form mature SH-EP in a multistep process as observed in seeds (2Mitsuhashi W. Minamikawa T. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 43Okomoto T. Minamikawa T. Eur. J. Biochem. 1995; 231: 300-305Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that results in a KDEL-minus mature 33-kDa active protease (48Okomoto T. Nakayama H. Seta K. Isobe T. Minamikawa T. FEBS Lett. 1994; 351: 31-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We hypothesize the KDEL sequence on the inactive proSH-EP functions to permit the seed cells to build up an inventory of precursor protein in the ER that can then be delivered to the vacuole to rapidly mobilize the stored protein. We propose that the temporary sequestration of a KDEL-tailed protease precursor has been evolved to exploit the ER-retention system store proSH-EP as a “transient zymogen.”DISCUSSIONThe removal of KDEL from SH-EP in homologous V. mungocells and in heterologous Sf-9 cells is so far unique among the retention sequence-bearing proteins that have been studied. There have been a number of studies that have added K/HDEL sequences to proteins and expressed these in transgenic plants (35Herman E.M. Tague B.W. Hoffman L.M. Kjemtrup S.E. Chrispeels M.J.

For the most part, these studies have shown partial or enhanced retention within the ER/nuclear envelope lumen with eventual progression to distal sites in the endomembrane system. These results would appear to indicate that the retention sequence of itself is insufficient to introduce complete retention of these proteins. However, in none of these studies was the fate of the retention signal examined, and the possibility remains that posttranslational processing of the retention sequence might explain their progression through the endomembrane system. In contrast, the KDEL-bearing protein auxin-binding protein was examined by Jones and Herman (59Jones A.M. Herman E.M. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), who found that the secreted protein retained its KDEL sequence assayed by immunoreactivity with the same monoclonal antibody 1D3 used in the present study.The ER-resident lumen proteins or reticuloplasmins with their carboxyl-terminal KDEL and HDEL retention sequences are conserved among eukaryotic cells. Each type of reticuloplasmin is highly similar among plant, animal, and fungal cells. Examples of these proteins include well characterized molecular chaperones BiP and GRP94 and protein disulfide isomerase (25Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 913-918Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar, 26Pelham H.R.B. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 1-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (539) Google Scholar). The reticuloplasmins are primarily localized within the ER/nuclear envelope lumen, although there are studies that have indicated that at least under some circumstances these proteins may escape the ER-retention system and are secreted (60Booth C. Koch G.L.E. Cell. 1989; 59: 729-737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 61Yoshimori T. Semba T. Takemoto H. Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Biol.

The function of auxin-binding protein remains unknown, although it is widely assumed that the protein may be involved in signal transduction of plant hormone auxin. Auxin-binding protein is localized primarily in the ER as if it were a reticuloplasmin (64Hesse T. Feldwisch J. Balshusemann D. Bauw G. Puype M. Vanderkerckhove E.J. Lobler M. Klambt D. Schell J.

Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 595-606Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The binding of ligand, auxin, may alter the exposure of the KDEL sequence, and this could change the trafficking of the protein (68Napier R.M. Venis M.A. Planta. 1990; 182: 313-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) so that its removal is not necessary to allow its exit from the ER. It is possible that auxin binding shuttles reversibly between the cell surface and the endomembrane system by exploiting the ER-retention system for targeting and transport.The crystal structure of cathepsin B (69Musil D.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) have been elucidated. The approximately 120-amino acid prosegment functions to occlude the active site with an antiparallel peptide chain (72Coulombe R. Grochulski P. Sivaraman J. Menard R. Mort J.S. Cygler M. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5492-5503Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar) that is an inhibitor of the enzyme (73Cygler M. Sivaraman J. Grochulski P. Columbe R. Storer A.C. Mort J.S. Structure. 1996; 4: 405-416Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The position of the prosegment on the papain precursor is folded so it is oriented close to the carboxyl terminus. Assuming that proSH-EP with its high sequence homology to papain is structurally homologous to the propapain crystal structure, the only way to determine whether the carboxyl-terminal KDEL sequence of SH-EP is exposed to be functionally presented is to test the proSH-EP protein's retention in an eukaryotic heterologous expression system. We found that plus-KDEL proSH-EP is processed more slowly than the minus-KDEL proSH-EP, indicating that the KDEL sequence of the proSH-EP is properly displayed to be recognized by the ER-retention system. That is because processing of the SH-EP is a post-Golgi event, retarding the protein in the pre-Golgi endomembrane system will retard the rate at which it is processed to the mature enzyme. This interpretation may be supported by the sucrose gradient fractionation experiment of the plus-KDEL SH-EP expressing Sf-9 cells, which shows that the 43-kDa proSH-EP that possesses the KDEL is in a distinct membrane compartment compared with the 42-kDa partially processed minus-KDEL proSH-EP. In cotyledon cells of V. mungo seedlings, the 42-kDa SH-EP was present in cell compartment distinct from primary fraction of ER. This result may support our proposal that the KDEL sequence of the SH-EP functions to retard the exit from ER in cotyledon cells.The 43-kDa C26G SH-EP mutant expressed in Sf-9 cells is processed to remove the carboxyl-terminal KDEL sequence, producing the 42-kDa proSH-EP. Thus, the autocatalytic activity of SH-EP is not required for removal of the KDEL sequence. Whether the KDEL sequence removal is the consequence of an alternate self-catalyzed reaction or the exogenous enzyme activity of another protein remains to be determined. Our experiments with the SH-EP mutant lacking the catalytic cysteine 26 residue indicates that the processing of the 42-kDa proSH-EP to 39- and 37-kDa intermediate precursors and mature 33-kDa is the result of autocatalytic self-processing. The C26G mutant is processed to a mature form in the insect cells without the accumulation of the 39- and 37-kDa intermediate precursors and at a much slower rate. This processing is likely to be the consequence of an endogenous insect or viral cysteine protease that processes the SH-EP protein in a single step. Experiments on in vitro processing of the recombinant proSH-EP mutant lacking the catalytic cysteine by mature active wild-type SH-EP resulted in conversion of the proprotein to a mature molecular mass without the accumulation of intermediate processing products. 2T. Okomoto, A. Yuki, N. Mitsuhashi, and T. Minamikawa, submitted for publication. These findings indicate that exogenous thiol protease activity including those thiol proteases found in Sf-9 cells will process the proSH-EP to its mature molecular mass but that only self-processing will yield intermediate processing products.That a lytic protease possesses an ER retention sequence and is retained within the ER lumen is curious. Such potentially destructive proteases would not seem to be candidates to be ER lumen resident proteins. The ER lumen is well established as a compartment involved in folding and processing newly synthesized proteins for export into the endomembrane system (74Okita T.W. Rogers J.C. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 47: 327-350Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 75Vitale A. Ceriotti A. Denecke J. J. Exp. Bot. 1993; 44: 390-394Crossref Scopus (98) Google Scholar). However, our results clearly demonstrate that only the inactive proSH-EP possesses the KDEL retention sequence. The KDEL sequence on proSH-EP is removed either in the ER or shortly after the protein's exit from the ER. The removal of the retention sequence in the ER is an obvious mechanism by which the proprotein could be changed from an ER-retained (or ER-retarded form) to a secretion-competent form that would pass by the cis-Golgi ERD-2 retention sequence receptor in the bulk secretory flow to its final destination. Plant cells have been shown to possess an ERD-2-type K/HDEL receptor protein that is highly similar to forms characterized in yeast and animal cells (76Hardwick K.G. Lewis M.J. Semenza J. Dean N. Pelham H.R.B. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 623-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar, 77Semenza J.C. Hardwick K.G. Dean N. Pelham H.R.B.

A. 1993; 90: 11433-11437Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). We suggest that proSH-EP with its KDEL sequence intact constitutes an inactive form of the protein that is functionally stored by continuous retrieval within the ER. If SH-EP was processed in bulk removing the retention sequence that would permit efficient and pulse-like progression to its destination and functional activation in the vacuole. The proSH-EP with its KDEL by recycling within the pre-Golgi endomembrane lumen is then functionally equivalent to a zymogen (81Kassell B. Kay J. Science. 1973; 180: 1022-1027Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) of proteases and is perhaps best described as a “transient zymogen.”The posttranslational processing of carboxyl-terminal KDEL sequence in SH-EP expressed in the homologous plant and heterologous Sf-9 cells suggests a previously unrecognized means of utilizing the information content of the ER retention sequence. An outline of the proposed sequence of processing events is shown in Fig.11. The regulated removal of the KDEL sequence offers the opportunity to permit a protein to progress through the endomembrane system to either the lytic compartment or secretion. This could allow a protein to serve dual roles within the ER and elsewhere in the cell. The removal of the ER retention sequence could allow the protein to be transported to the lytic compartment for disposal, or in the case of SH-EP for activation as an acid protease. We speculate that the selective removal of KDEL sequences will not be restricted to SH-EP but might also include reticuloplasmins to permit efficient turnover of the proteins during normal growth and during recovery from stress overexpression. Experiments are currently in progress in our laboratories to examine whether retention sequence processing and removal is a characteristic of reticuloplasmins. SH-EP is a thiol protease expressed in germinating mung bean (Vigna mungo) cotyledons (1Akasofu H. Yamauchi D. Mitsuhashi W. Minamikawa T.

All cysteine proteases are initially synthesized as larger precursor proteins with NH2-terminal prodomains of approximately 120 amino acids (11North M.J. Br. J. Lett. 1986; 238: 623-624Google Scholar). The prodomain is an inhibitor of the protease (12Carmona E. Dufour E. Plouffe C. Takabe S. Manson P. Mort J.S. Menard R. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 8149-8157Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) and is essential in the correct folding of the protein (13Tao K. Stearns N.A. Dong J. Wu Q. Sahagian G.G. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1994; 311: 19-27Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Processing of the proenzyme occurs by self-catalysis (14Mason R.W. Gal S. Gottesman M.M. Biochem. J. 1987; 248: 449-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar) in post-Golgi compartments of the secretory system. With intracellular proteases, this processing occurs in the lytic compartment (lysosomes or vacuoles) (15Holwerda B.C. Galvin N.J. Baranski T.J. Rogers J.C. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 1091-1106Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar); with extracellular proteases, the processing occurs during secretion (16Koehler S.M. Ho T.-H.D. Plant Cell. 1990; 2: 769-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). Targeting to the correct compartment for processing is mediated by a peptide (17Holwerda B.C Padgett H.S. Rogers J.C. Plant Cell. 1992; 4: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar) or phosphomannose (18Cuozzo J.W. Tao K. Wu Q. Young W. Sahagian G.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15611-15619Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) targeting signal on the NH2-terminal precursor domain that is recognized by a specific receptor that is presumed to be localized in the Golgi apparatus (19McIntyre G.F.

When it is mutated, the clinical consequences are X-linked hyper-IgM syndrome (XHIM), a primary immunodeficiency disorder characterized by low levels of IgG, IgA, and elevated or normal levels of IgM. Mutated CD40L can no longer bind CD40 nor provide signals for B cells to proliferate and to switch from IgM to other immunoglobulin isotypes. When considering gene therapy for XHIM, it is important to address the possibility that the mutated CD40L associates with transduced wild type CD40L, and as a consequence, immune reconstitution is not attained. In this study, we demonstrate that the various mutated CD40L species we have identified in patients with XHIM, including both full-length and truncated mutants, associate with wild type CD40L on the cell surface of co-transfected COS cells. The association between wild type and mutated CD40L was also observed in CD4+ T cell lines established from XHIM patients with leaky splice site mutations. The clinical phenotype of these patients suggests that this association between wild type and mutated CD40L species may result in less efficient cross-linking of CD40.

When considering gene therapy for XHIM patients, the possibility of an association between the transduced wild type CD40L and the patient's mutated CD40L resulting in heterotrimer formation has to be addressed. Since two CD40L monomers contribute to form one functional CD40-binding site (25Bajorath J. Chalupny N.J. Marken J.S. Siadak A.W. Skonier J. Gordon M. Hollenbaugh D. Noelle R.J. Ochs H.D. Aruffo A.

In this study, the association of wild type CD40L with various mutated CD40L species isolated from XHIM patients is demonstrated in transfected COS cells and in activated T cell lines established from XHIM patients with different splice site mutations. COS cells, murine IgG1 anti-human CD40L monoclonal antibody 106 (mAb 106), and biotinylated mAb 106 (bio-106), rabbit anti-human CD40L antiserum, and the CD40-Ig construct consisting of the extracellular domain of CD40 fused with the Fc region of human IgG1 were provided by Dr. Diane Hollenbaugh (Bristol-Myers Squibb). COS cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (HyClone, Logan, UT), 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin.

Interleukin-2-dependent CD4+ T cell lines (>90% CD4+) were prepared from T cell lines established from XHIM patients using a magnetic cell sorting system (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA) and maintained in Yssel's medium (Gemini Biological Products, Calabasas, CA) supplemented with 8% heat-inactivated FCS, 2% heat-inactivated human AB serum (Gemini Biological Products), 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin according to standard methods. A schematic representation of the protein structures we expressed in COS cells and the arbitrary designation of each plasmid and corresponding protein are shown in Fig. 1 and TableI, respectively. All of the expression plasmids were constructed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using cDNA isolated from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells derived from a healthy volunteer or from selected XHIM patients (11Seyama K.

Naturally occurring mutant cDNAs, exon 2-skipped cDNA, 19 nucleotides of intron 2-inserted cDNA, and exon 3-skipped cDNA, were similarly cloned into pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) using cDNA generated from the appropriate XHIM patients. The expression vector of the CD40L lacking the cytoplasmic domain (CytDel, Met21-Leu261) was generated using SP2 (5′CGCGGATCCATTTCAACTTTAACACAGCATGAAAATTTTTATGTATTTAC3′) and AP1 and cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+).

In constructing pF-L258S, AP2 (5′GCGCTCGAGTCAGAGTTTGAGTGAGCCAAAGG3′) was designed to have a missense mutation within the antisense primer sequence and was used for amplification instead of AP1.

The coding sequences of the extracellular domain of the FasL and CD30L were amplified by PCR using SP5 (5′CGCGGATCCACAGCTCTTCCACCTACAGAAGGAG3′) and AP5 (5′GCGCTCGAGTTAGAGCTTATATAAGCCGAAAAACGTCTG3′) for FasL and SP6 (5′CGCGGATCCACAGAGGACGGACTCCATTCC3′) and AP6 (5′GCGCTCGAGTCAGTCTGAATTACTGTATAAG3′) for CD30L, respectively, and then fused into BamHI and XhoI sites of the pcDNA3.1/Zeo(+) into which the coding sequence of the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CD40L had already been cloned.

See also Fig. 1 since the numbers in the left column correspond to those of Fig. 1 in which structure of protein is shown schematically. COS cells were electroporated with supercoiled expression plasmid under the following conditions: 10 μg of plasmid and 4 × 106 cells were mixed in 0.4 ml of serum- and antibiotic-free DMEM and electroporated at 210 V and 960 microfarads using GenePulser (Bio-Rad). Forty eight hours after electroporation, cells were harvested after incubation in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 5 mm EDTA for 10 min and used either to examine surface expression of the transduced gene product by flow cytometry or to biochemically characterize the expressed proteins. Forty eight hours after electroporation, cells were harvested as described above. When co-transfection with an expression plasmid of wild type CD40L (pWild) and of a CD40L mutant was intended, 5 μg of each plasmid was mixed and electroporated under the same conditions. Cells were resuspended at a concentration of 5 × 106/ml and kept for 30 min on ice in lysis buffer containing 1% Triton X-100, 10 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3, freshly supplemented with 200 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (Sigma), 10 μg/ml aprotinin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 10 μg/ml leupeptin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), and 10 mmiodoacetamide (Sigma). For surface biotinylation, cells were washed with PBS twice, suspended at 5 × 106/ml in PBS, and Sulfo-NHS-biotin (Pierce) added to a final concentration of 500 μg/ml. Cells were incubated for 30 min with rotation at room temperature and then lysed. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Protein concentration was measured using Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) and bovine γ-globulin as standard. The lysate was adjusted to 200 μg of protein in 200 μl of lysis buffer and precleared overnight with 20 μl of protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose (50% slurry) (Pierce) at 4 °C, followed by immunoprecipitation with 3 μg of specific antibody or 5 μg of CD40-Ig for 1.5 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected using 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose or protein A-Sepharose. The Sepharose beads were washed three times with 0.1% Triton X-100, 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3, followed by a single wash with 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 0.025% NaN3, and with 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 6.8). The Sepharose beads-absorbed immune complexes were treated with 20 μl of 2× Laemmli's sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol and were incubated for 5 min in boiling water. The eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The Sepharose beads-absorbed immune complexes were suspended in 20 μl of 0.5% SDS, 0.1 m β-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 5 min in boiling water. After centrifugation, the supernatant was mixed with or without 5 units of protease-free N-glycosidase F (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in a total volume of 60 μl containing 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), 1%n-octyl glucoside (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and incubated for 18 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was then treated with 12 μl of 6× Laemmli's sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol for 5 min in boiling water and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Following immunoprecipitation from the lysate of transfected COS cells, proteins were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon™-P membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA). The blotted membrane was incubated in a blocking solution containing 5% blocking non-fat milk (Bio-Rad) in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 137 mm NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20 (TBS-T), for 2 h at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C and then probed with a specific antibody at 2 μg/ml in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. Membranes were washed three times with TBS-T and then incubated with TBS-T containing 1:2000-diluted streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Life Technologies, Inc.) or 1:5000-diluted goat anti-rabbit immunoglobulin-horseradish peroxidase conjugate (BioSource International) for 1 h at room temperature. After washing three times with TBS-T, proteins recognized by the specific antibody were visualized by the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Metabolic radiolabeling of activated interleukin-2-dependent CD4+ T cell lines was performed in Met/Cys-free RPMI 1640 medium (Sigma) supplemented with 10% dialyzed heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. CD4+ T cells were suspended at 5 × 106 cells/ml in labeling medium containing 0.2 mCi/ml EXPRE35S35S (NEN Life Science Products) and activated with 1 μg/ml ionomycin and 10 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Sigma) for 4 h at 37 °C. Radiolabeled cells were lysed at 5 × 107 cells/ml in lysis buffer. The resultant lysate was precleared and immunoprecipitated as described above. Proteins were resolved by 13% SDS-PAGE, and fluorography was performed using ENTENSIFY™ (NEN Life Science Products) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For metabolic radiolabeling of transiently transfected COS cells, the cells were washed 36 h after transfection with PBS and incubated in Met/Cys-free DMEM (Sigma) supplemented with 5% dialyzed heat-inactivated FCS, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.2 mCi/ml EXPRE35S35S for 4 h and processed similarly. Surface expression of wild type CD40L, mutant CD40L species, and control hybrid proteins (F-HybFasL and F-HybCD30L) by transfected COS cells was confirmed by flow cytometry (data not shown). Wild type CD40L and Flag-tagged wild type CD40L (F-Wild) were expressed abundantly by transfected COS cells and detected by mAb 5c8 as well as CD40-Ig construct, suggesting that the Flag peptide at the N terminus does not affect the structure and function of CD40L. Two unique truncated mutants, CytDel and E2skip, both found in XHIM patients (11Seyama K. Nonoyama S. Gangsaas I. Hollenbaugh D. Pabst H.F. Aruffo A. Ochs H.D. Blood. 1998; 92: 2421-2434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were detected in transfected COS cells using mAb 5c8 and the CD40-Ig construct, respectively. The expression of other mutated CD40L species, including mutants with amino acid substitutions and truncated mutants, was confirmed by the binding of a polyclonal anti-CD40L antiserum. Similarly, both F-HybFasL and F-HybCD30L expressed by transfected COS cells were detected well by mAb NOK1 and three different anti-CD30L mAb preparations (M80, M81, and M82), respectively. Since NOK1 recognizes the antigenic epitope consisting of two FasL monomers, it seems likely that F-HybFasL retains the inherent structural integrity of FasL and forms a trimer. The finding that F-HybCD30L expression was detectable by three different anti-CD30L mAbs suggests that this hybrid construct also retains the inherent structural integrities of CD30L and forms a trimer. The biochemical characteristics of proteins expressed by COS cells transfected with pWild, pCytDel, and pF-Wild were analyzed by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting. From COS cells transfected with pWild, CD40-Ig immunoprecipitated two CD40L species, one with an apparent molecular mass of 33 kDa (p33) and the other of 31 kDa (p31) when probed with mAb bio-106. CD40Ls obtained from pCytDel-transfected cells were found to have an apparent molecular mass of 29 (p29) and 27 kDa (p27), and those obtained from pF-Wild-transfected COS cells had a molecular mass of 34 (p34), 32 kDa (p32), and p29, respectively (Fig.2 A). Because CD40L has two potential N-glycosylation sites, one in the cytoplasmic domain and the other in the C terminus of the TNF homology (TNFH) domain, N-glycosidase F treatment was performed to determine whether glycosylation contributes to the existence of multiple species of CD40L. After deglycosylation, p31 and p27 were detected in pWild-transfected cells, a single band, p27, in pCytDel-transfected cells, and p32 and p27 in pF-Wild-transfected cells (Fig.2 A). These results suggest that COS cells express full-length CD40L as well as CD40L lacking the cytoplasmic domain and that both species exist in glycosylated (p33, p29, respectively) and unglycosylated forms (p31, p27, respectively) when transfected with pWild. This interpretation was further supported by the results of probing the same preparation with Rb784 (Fig. 2"
https://openalex.org/W2071670289,"The binding of antigen to the B cell antigen receptor (BCR) initiates two major cellular events. First, upon cross-linking by antigen, the BCR induces signal transduction cascades leading to the transcription of a number of genes associated with B cell activation. Second, the BCR internalizes and delivers antigens to processing compartments, where processed antigenic peptides are loaded onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules for presentation to T helper cells. The BCR consists of membrane Ig (mIg) and Igα/Igβ heterodimer (Igα/Igβ). The Igα/Igβ, the signal transducing component of the BCR, has been indicated to play a role in antigen processing. In order to understand the function of the Igα/Igβ in antigen transport, we studied the intracellular trafficking pathway of the Igα/Igβ. We show that in the absence of antigen binding, the Igα/Igβ constitutively traffics with mIg from the plasma membrane, through the early endosomes, to the MHC class II peptide-loading compartment. Cross-linking the BCR does not alter the trafficking pathway; however, it accelerates the transport of the Igα/Igβ to the MHC class II peptide-loading compartment. This suggests that the Igα/Igβ heterodimer is involved in BCR-mediated antigen transport through the entire antigen transport pathway.

The MHC class II peptide-loading compartment in the late part of the endocytic pathway (MIIC) has been better characterized comparing to the others. This compartment is relatively acidic (14Xu X. Song W. Cho H. Qiu Y. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2984-2992PubMed Google Scholar), and contains class II molecules, DM (15Schafer P.H. Green J.M. Malapati S. Gu L. Pierce S.K. J.

Wandinger-Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar), but not the transferrin receptor (10Tulp A. Verwoerd D. Dobberstein B.

The peptide-class II complexes formed in this compartment are capable of activating specific T cells in vitro (9Qiu Y. Xu X. Wandinger-Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). B cells, which are unique antigen-presenting cells, express clonally specific antigen receptors on the cell surface. Membrane Ig (mIg) is the antigen-binding domain of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Disulfide-linked Igα/Igβ heterodimer (Igα/Igβ) noncovalently associates with the mIg (20Reth M. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1992; 10: 97-121Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tails of the Igα/Igβ contain conserved motifs (the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs), which provide the BCR with the signal transducing ability (21Cambier J.C. Pleiman C.M. Clark M.R. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1994; 12: 457-486Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar,22Reth M. Wienands J. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1997; 15: 453-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (372) Google Scholar). B cells are very efficient antigen-presenting cells. The high efficiency of B cells in antigen presentation relies on the BCR. Whereas antigens can also enter the cells by fluid phase pinocytosis, BCR-mediated antigen processing requires 11000th to110,000th the antigen as compared with antigen taken up by fluid phase pinocytosis (23Rock K.L. Benacerraf B. Abbas A.K. J. Exp. Med. 1984; 160: 1102-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar, 24Lanzavecchia A. Nature. 1985; 314: 537-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1088) Google Scholar, 25Casten L.A. Lakey E.K. Jelachich M.L. Margoliash E. Pierce S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5890-5898Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Therefore, B cells are able to efficiently present an antigen to T helper cells when the concentration of the antigen is low. This is particularly critical for the initiation of the secondary antibody response. Signals transduced through the BCR also influence antigen processing. Earlier reports (26Casten L.A. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1988; 140: 404-410PubMed Google Scholar) showed that both monovalent and divalent antigens are efficiently presented by antigen-specific B cells, however, 10-fold more monovalent antigen is required as compared with bivalent antigen. This observation suggests that divalent antigens, which initiate the signal transduction cascade, up-regulate the antigen presentation function of B cells. Indeed, subsequent studies demonstrated that signaling through the BCR results in biochemical changes in the MIIC (27Xu X. Press B. Wagle N.M. Cho H. Wandinger-Ness A. Pierce S.K. Int. Immunol. 1996; 8: 1867-1876Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and the aggregation and fusion of the late endosome and lysosome (28Siemasko K. Eisfelder B.J. Williamson E. Kabak S. Clark M.R. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5203-5208PubMed Google Scholar), which correlate with heightened antigen processing. A recent report (29Lankar D. Briken V. Adler K. Weiser P. Cassard S. Blank U. Viguier M. Bonnerot C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar) showed that overexpression of the dominant negative mutant of Syk, a key tyrosine kinase in the BCR signal transduction pathway, affects antigen presentation mediated by an Igα chimera. The BCR contributes to efficient antigen processing by its ability to internalize and to deliver antigens to the processing compartment. Our previous studies (30Song W. Cho H. Cheng P. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4255-4263PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that in B cells mIgM and bound antigens are internalized from the plasma membrane (PM) into the early endosomes and are subsequently delivered to the MIIC, where they meet newly synthesized class II molecules transported from thetrans-Golgi network. This result indicates that mIg is the carrier that transports antigen to the MIIC. BCR signaling also directly affects trafficking of the mIg and bound antigen to the MIIC. Cross-linking mIgM by an antigen, which initiates a signal transduction cascade, increases the internalization rate of the antigen and accelerates the transport of mIg-antigen complexes to the MIIC. The structural basis of such regulated trafficking is not known. Because the cytoplasmic tails of mIgM and mIgD are only three amino acids long and lack any identifiable trafficking motif, it is possible that the Igα/Igβ, a mIg-associated protein, controls the intracellular trafficking of the BCR and bound antigens. Indeed, mIgMs, containing mutations that disturb their interaction with the Igα/Igβ, are not able to facilitate antigen processing (31Shaw A.C. Mitchell R.N. Weaver Y.K. Campos-Torres J. Abbas A.K. Leder P. Cell. 1990; 63: 381-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 32Patel K.J. Neuberger M.S.

Med. 1995; 181: 1705-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The cytoplasmic tail of either Igα or Igβ can drive antigen processing mediated by chimeric receptors, even though the cytoplasmic tail of Igβ targets the chimeras to early endosomes (34Bonnerot C. Lankar D. Hanau D. Spehner D. Davoust J. Salamero J. Fridman W.H. Immunity. 1995; 3: 335-347Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The deletion of the cytoplasmic tail of Igα blocks the constitutive internalization of the BCR (35Cassard S. Salamero J. Hanau D. Spehner D. Davoust J. Fridman W.H. Bonnerot C. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 1767-1773PubMed Google Scholar). A chimeric receptor of Igα, with a point mutation of a tyrosine residue in the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif and a 17-amino acid deletion in its cytoplasmic tail, cannot facilitate the processing and presentation of cryptic epitopes of antigens (29Lankar D. Briken V. Adler K. Weiser P. Cassard S. Blank U. Viguier M. Bonnerot C. J. Exp. Med. 1998; 188: 819-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). All of these studies indicate that Igα/Igβ plays an important role in BCR-mediated antigen transport. However, it is not known how the Igα/Igβ carries out this function. The intracellular trafficking pathway of the Igα/Igβ still remains to be determined. Thus, it is unclear whether the single chain chimeras widely used in these studies traffic through the same pathway as the native Igα/Igβ and deliver antigens into the same processing compartment as the BCR. Herein, we describe the intracellular transport pathway of the Igα/Igβ heterodimer in B cells and show that the Igα/Igβ constitutively traffics with mIg and bound antigen from the PM through the endocytic pathway to the MIIC, where functional peptide-class II complexes are formed. The B cell lymphoma CH27 was generated and characterized by Haughton et al. (36Haughton G. Arnold L.W. Bishop G.A. Mercolino T.J. Immunol. Rev. 1986; 93: 35-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar) and is an H-2k, IgM+, FcγRIIB1− cell line. The CH27 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented as described (37Jelachich M.L. Grusby M.J. Clark D. Tasch D. Margoliash E. Pierce S.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 5537-5541Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), containing 15% fetal calf serum (15% complete medium). The mouse hybridoma 17.3.3s producing an I-Ek-specific mAb (38Ozato K. Mayer N. Sachs D.H. J. Immunol. 1980; 124: 533-540PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The rat hybridoma ID4B producing a LAMP-1-specific mAb was obtained from the Development Studies Hybridoma Bank (Iowa City, IA). Goat antibodies specific for mouse IgG (H+L) (anti-Ig), goat antibodies specific for mouse μ chain (anti-μ), Fab fragment of goat anti-μ antibody (Fab-anti-μ), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-μ antibody (HRP-anti-μ), and gold-labeled goat anti-rat antibody were purchased from Jackson ImmunoReseach (West Grove, PA). Gold-labeled Fab-anti-μ was generated as described previously (39Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1985; 38: 87-93PubMed Google Scholar). Igα-specific polyclonal antibodies (anti-Igα) were generated in rabbits immunized with a synthetic peptide construct, which consists of a 20-residue peptide of the Igα protein C-terminal cytosolic tail connected by a β-turn to a potent T cell epitope derived from tetanus toxoid. An Igα-specific mAb (anti-Igα mAb) was generated in rats against the entire cytosolic tail of the Igα protein using a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein. Igβ-specific polyclonal antibodies and the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein of Igα were gifts from Dr. Marcus Clark (University of Chicago, IL). Gold-labeled protein A and protein G were purchased from Sigma. CH27 cells were washed at 4 °C with Hanks' balanced saline solution lacking phosphate and containing 20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.4, and incubated in the same buffer containing 0.2 mg/ml sulfosuccinimidyl-6-(biotinamido)hexanoate (Pierce) for 15 min at 4 °C. After 15 min of incubation, a freshly made biotin solution was added, and the incubation was extended for another 15 min at 4 °C. The cells then were washed with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 6 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 20 mm MOPS, pH 7.4. Subcellular fractionation was conducted as detailed elsewhere (9Qiu Y. Xu X. Wandinger-Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells (2 × 108) were washed and homogenized using a Dounce Tissue Grinder (Wheaton, Millville, NJ). The postnuclear supernatant was prepared and layered onto a Percoll gradient (1.05 g/ml). After centrifugation, fractions (0.5 ml) were collected and pooled as described (14Xu X. Song W. Cho H. Qiu Y. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2984-2992PubMed Google Scholar): pool 1 (fractions 2–4), early endosomes and Golgi; pool 2 (fractions 6–8), PM and endoplasmic reticulum; pool 3 (fractions 13–15), transport vesicles; pool 4 (fractions 20–22), MIIC, dense late endosomes and lysosomes. Cells or fractions were lysed in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (1% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors). Igα was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using anti-Igα antibody and protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Biotinylated proteins were visualized with streptavidin-HRP and ECL (NEN Life Science Products). For co-immunoprecipitation, cells or fractions were lysed in 1% digitonin (Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) lysis buffer (1% digitonin, 10 mm triethanolamine, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) (40Hombach J. Leclercq L. Radbruch A. Rajewsky K. Reth M. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3451-3456Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Membrane IgM was immunoprecipitated from the lysate using anti-μ antibody. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The Igα in the anti-μ immunoprecipitates was detected by anti-Igα antibody. Surface biotinylated cells were pulsed with HRP-anti-μ for 15 min at 37 °C. After extensive washing, the cells were incubated in 10% complete medium at 37 °C for varying lengths of time. The HRP-mediated cross-linking reaction was then conducted as previously detailed (41Song W. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29474-29480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed and incubated in 3′,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) reaction buffer (0.5 mg/ml DAB and 0.03% H2O2 in Hanks' balanced saline solution lacking phosphate and containing 20 mm sodium HEPES, pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 45 min in the dark. In a parallel experiment, H2O2 was omitted from the DAB reaction buffer. Then the cells were washed and lysed with the 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. The cross-linked protein aggregates were removed from the lysate by centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C. The biotinylated Igα was immunoprecipitated from the lysates and analyzed as described above. In the control experiment, cells were pulsed with HRP-anti-μ first and incubated in 10% complete medium at 37 °C for 2 h to chase the HRP-anti-μ into the dense compartments. Then, the surface of the cells was biotinylated. After quenching, the cells were chased in 10% complete medium for the second time at 37 °C. At the end of the second chase, the cells were subjected to HRP-mediated cross-linking reaction and processed as detailed above. Cells were pulsed with gold-labeled Fab-anti-μ for 10 min and then chased for 1 h at 37 °C. The cells were then washed with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 and fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde, 1% acrolein in 0.1 m sodium phosphate, pH 7.4 (freshly made) for 2 h at room temperature. After being washed with 0.1 m sodium phosphate, the cells were embedded in 10% gelatin, immersed in 2.3m sucrose in phosphate buffer for 2 h at 4 °C, and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Ultrathin cryosections were collected on a mixture of sucrose and methylcellulose (42Liou W. Geuze H.J. Slot J.W. Histochem. Cell Biol. 1996; 106: 41-58Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Ultrathin cryosections were labeled with 17.3.3s, ID4B, anti-Igα mAb, and protein G- and protein A-conjugated colloidal gold (43Slot J.W. Geuze H.J. Gigengack S. Lienhard G.E. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 113: 123-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar) and examined in a Zeiss EM10CA electron microscope. To analyze the intracellular degradation of Igα/Igβ, the surface of CH27 cells was biotinylated. The biotinylated cells were either treated with medium alone or treated with anti-μ antibody for 30 min at 4 °C to cross-link the BCR and then chased at 37 °C for up to 4 h. An equal number of cells from each chase time point were lysed, and Igα/Igβs were purified by immunoprecipitation and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The biotinylated proteins were detected by streptavidin-HRP. After warming to 37 °C, the biotinylated Igα gradually disappeared, indicating the intracellular degradation of the Igα (Fig.1 A). In the untreated cells, the degradation of the Igα did not start until the cells were incubated at 37 °C for 1 h. By 4 h, 55% biotinylated Igα remained in the cells (Fig. 1 B). In the cells treated with anti-μ antibody, the degradation of the Igα was significantly rapid during the first hour, and after the first hour, the degradation was reduced to a rate similar to the rate in the untreated cells. Only 25% of the biotinylated Igα was left in the cells after 4 h (Fig. 1 B). The degradation rate of Igα in the cells treated with anti-μ antibody appears to have two phases, a rapid degradation phase at the initial hour and a slower degradation phase at the later time. The Igβ showed a very weak biotin signal that was only visible after long exposure. The presence of Igβ in the anti-Igα immunoprecipitates was determined by stripping the biotin blots and reblotting the same Western blots with rabbit anti-mouse Igβ antibody (data not shown). Because Igα and Igβ exist as a disulfide-linked heterodimer, the intracellular degradation and movement of Igα should reasonably reflect the behavior of the Igα/Igβ heterodimer. Compared with the turnover rate of mIgM published previously (30Song W. Cho H. Cheng P. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4255-4263PubMed Google Scholar), the Igα/Igβ is degraded in the cells at a rate similar to that of mIgM. Cross-linking BCR increases the turnover rate of the Igα/Igβ. Previously, using subcellular fractionation, we isolated and characterized the MIIC (9Qiu Y. Xu X. Wandinger-Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar) and described the intracellular transport pathway of mIg and bound antigen in B cells (30Song W. Cho H. Cheng P. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4255-4263PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we use this method to follow the trafficking of Igα/Igβ through the endocytic pathway. The surfaces of CH27 cells were biotinylated and the cells were treated with medium alone or medium containing anti-μ antibody at 4 °C for 30 min. The cells were incubated at 37 °C for varying lengths of time to let biotinylated molecules move into the cells. At the end of each time period, the cells were washed at 4 °C and subjected to subcellular fractionation (9Qiu Y. Xu X. Wandinger-Ness A. Dalke D.P. Pierce S.K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 595-605Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The resulting fractions were pooled into four membrane fractions (early endosomes/Golgi, PM/endoplasmic reticulum, transport vesicles, and dense late endosomes/lysosomes/MIIC), as previously characterized (14Xu X. Song W. Cho H. Qiu Y. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 2984-2992PubMed Google Scholar). The biotinylated Igα/Igβs in the fractions were purified by immunoprecipitation, analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting, and detected using streptavidin-HRP. The Western blots (Fig.2 A) were analyzed by densitometry (Fig. 2 B). In the absence of chase, the majority of the biotinylated Igα was present in the fractions that contain the PM, indicating that the biotinylation only occurred on the cell surface at 4 °C, and the biotin reagent had been efficiently removed and quenched before the cells were homogenized. Upon warming to 37 °C for 30 min, a portion of the biotinylated Igα in both anti-μ-treated and untreated cells was recovered from the fractions containing the early endosomes. In the anti-μ-treated cells, a small portion of the biotinylated Igα was detected in the dense fractions containing the MIIC. After 1 h at 37 °C, there was a significant amount of the biotinylated Igα in the dense fractions in the anti-μ-treated cells. In contrast, in the untreated cells, the biotinylated Igα did not enter the dense fractions until 2 h after warming to 37 °C. By 2 h, the relative amount of the biotinylated Igα in the dense fractions of the anti-μ-treated cell slightly decreased, suggesting that the biotinylated Igα was degraded. However, we were unable to detect any biotinylated degradation products in the dense compartments. This may be due to a low biotin signal and a poor immunoprecipitation of degraded products. These results show that the Igα/Igβ is constitutively internalized from the PM into the early endosomes en route to the dense endocytic vesicles that include the MIIC. Cross-linking the BCR accelerates the transport of the Igα/Igβ to the dense vesicles. Using subcellular fractionation, we showed that the Igα/Igβ is internalized from the PM into the early endosomes and subsequently moves to the dense vesicles that include the MIIC. However, whether the Igα/Igβ enters the MIIC was unclear. To address this question, we next examined whether Igα/Igβ co-localizes with mIg when mIg moves from the PM to the MIIC. Previously, we developed an assay for delivery of mIg-antigen complexes to the MIIC (30Song W. Cho H. Cheng P. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4255-4263PubMed Google Scholar). Here, we used this assay to determine the transport of Igα/Igβ to the MIIC. We used HRP-anti-μ as an antigen and the mIg and the Igα/Igβ on the cell surface were labeled with biotin. In the presence of DAB and H2O2, HRP catalyzes nonspecific cross-linking of proteins in the same compartment, resulting in large, detergent-insoluble protein polymers (41Song W. Apodaca G. Mostov K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29474-29480Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins in the cross-linked polymers cannot be isolated by immunoprecipitation and fail to enter SDS-polyacrylamide gels (11West M.A. Lucocq J.M. Watts C. Nature. 1994; 369: 147-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar). Because HRP-anti-μ is not membrane permeable, HRP-mediated cross-linking reactions only occur in vesicles where HRP-anti-μ is present. A reduction in the amount of the immunoprecipitated proteins indicates co-localization of these proteins with HRP-anti-μ. Surface biotinylated CH27 cells were pulsed with HRP-anti-μ for 15 min at 37 °C, washed, and chased at 37 °C for 0, 60, 120, and 180 min in the absence of HRP-anti-μ. The cells were washed and incubated in a DAB reaction buffer at 4 °C to allow the HRP-mediated cross-linking reaction to proceed in HRP containing compartments. In a parallel experiment, H2O2 was omitted from the DAB reaction buffer as a control. The cells were lysed, and mIg and Igα/Igβ were immunoprecipitated with anti-Ig and anti-Igα antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. Biotinylated molecules were detected with streptavidin-HRP. Previously we showed (30Song W. Cho H. Cheng P. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4255-4263PubMed Google Scholar) that after the cells are pulsed with HRP-anti-Ig for 15 min at 37 °C, the majority of HRP-anti-Ig accumulates in the early endosomes and on the PM. After 1–2 h of chase, most of HRP-anti-Ig reaches the MIIC, where it meets with newly synthesized MHC class II molecules. If the Igα/Igβ traffics with mIg-antigen complex all the way to the MIIC, the two protein complexes should co-localize at all chase times. However, if the Igα/Igβ dissociates from the mIg-antigen complex after internalization, the Igα/Igβ and HRP-anti-μ complexes should only co-localize at early chase times, but not at later chase times, when the mIg bound HRP-anti-Ig reaches the MIIC. In the experiments in which H2O2 was omitted from the DAB reaction buffer, both biotinylated Igα and mIgM decreased with time indicating a synchronized intracellular degradation (Fig.3 A). In the presence of H2O2, there was a significant reduction in the amount of biotinylated mIgM at all chase times up to 180 min (Fig. 3,A and B), indicating that HRP-anti-μ associated with mIgM throughout the transport pathway from the PM to the MIIC. Moreover, there was a significant reduction of the biotinylated Igα not only at the early chase times when HRP-anti-μ was still in the early endosomes but also at the later chase times when HRP-anti-μ had reached the MIIC (Fig. 3, A and B). These results indicate that the Igα/Igβ indeed enters the MIIC when the mIg-antigen reaches there. In the control experiment, CH27 cells pulsed with HRP-anti-μ for 15 min at 37 °C was chased at 37 °C for 2 h. By this time, HRP-anti-μ had reached the MIIC (30Song W. Cho H. Cheng P. Pierce S.K. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 4255-4263PubMed Google Scholar). The surface of the cells was then biotinylated at 4 °C and the cells were chased again at 37 °C for 0, 10, and 60 min. The mIgM and the Igα/Igβ were immunoprecipitated from cells. As shown in Fig. 3, C andD, in the presence of H2O2, there was no detectable reduction in the amount of the biotinylated mIgM and Igα until after 1 h of chase time. This shows that HRP-anti-μ in the MIIC and the dense vesicles was unable to cross-link the biotinylated mIgM and Igα/Igβ on the PM and in the early endosomes. Therefore, the results shown in Fig. 3, A and B,were not caused by the leakage of the HRP from vesicles, and they indicate that the mIg-antigen complexes co-localize with the Igα/Igβ"

A loop, which protrudes from domain IA of the DnaK ATPase domain, is one of six sites of interaction revealed in the GrpE:DnaK co-crystal structure and has been implicated as a functionally important site in both DnaK and Ssc1. Alanine substitutions for the amino acids (Lys-108 and Arg-213 of Mge1) predicted to interact with the Hsp70 loop were analyzed. Mge1 having both substitutions was able to support growth in the absence of the essential wild-type protein. K108A/R213A Mge1 was able to stimulate nucleotide release from Ssc1 and function in refolding of denatured luciferase, albeit higher concentrations of mutant protein than wild-type protein were required. <i>In vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> assays using K108A/R213A Mge1 and Ssc1 indicated that the disruption of contact at this site destabilized the interaction between the two proteins. We propose that the direct interaction between the loop of Ssc1 and Mge1 is not required to effect nucleotide release but plays a role in stabilization of the Mge1-Ssc1 interaction. The robust growth of the K108A/R213A <i>MGE1</i> mutant suggests that the interaction between Mge1 and Ssc1 is tighter than required for function<i>in vivo</i>."
https://openalex.org/W2029265874,"The roles of HS2 and HS3 from the human β-globin locus control region and of the TATA, CACCC, and stage selector elements of the γ-globin promoter, in competitive inhibition of β-globin gene expression in early development, were tested using stable transfections of HEL and K562 cells. Cells with an HS3γβ construct demonstrate that HS3 exhibits enhancing activity, but compared with HS2, this site participates less consistently in the inhibition of embryonic/fetal β-globin expression. In cells with HS3HS2γβ constructs, the two HS sites act in concert to more effectively enhance γ-globin gene expression and to drive stage-specific expression of the γ- and β-globin genes.

Human γ- to β-globin gene switching is coordinated by several regulatory sequences including the gene promoters and the locus control region (LCR). 1The abbreviations used are: LCR, locus control region; HS, DNase I super-hypersensitive sites; kb, kilobase(s); bp, base pair(s); SSE, stage selector element; EKLF, erythroid Kruppel-like factor. The LCR contains 5 DNaseI super-hypersensitive sites (HS1-HS5) located 6 to 26 kb upstream of the ε-globin gene in the β-globin gene cluster (1Forrester W.C. Thompson C. Elder J.T. Groudine M. Proc.

The LCR has enhancer activity (3Tuan D.Y. Solomon W.B. London I.M. Lee D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Papayannopoulou T. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1990; 4: 1637-1649Crossref PubMed Scopus (389) Google Scholar). The HS sites of the LCR contain binding sites for transcription factors that are critical for its activity (reviewed in Ref. 6Hardison R. Slightom J.L. Gumucio D.L. Goodman M. Stojanovic N. Miller W. Gene. 1997; 205: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In situ hybridization of primary globin transcripts in transgenic mouse cells has provided in vivo evidence that the LCR is likely to act as a holocomplex to activate transcription by stably interacting with one β-like globin gene at a time (7Wijgerde M. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Nature. 1995; 377: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). A current model states that the fetal γ-globin gene and its promoter play important roles in interactions with the LCR that result in the competitive inhibition of adult β-globin gene expression in early development (8Engel J.D. Trends Genet. 1993; 9: 304-309Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 9Townes T.M. Behringer R.R. Trends Genet. 1990; 6: 219-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This is supported by the observation that the β-globin gene is expressed inappropriately early in mice and tissue culture cells with LCR constructs that do not contain the γ-globin gene (10Lloyd J.A.

The factors that bind to the gene promoters and to the LCR that are important for such interactions have not yet been identified, although some of the DNA elements involved are elucidated in this work. The individual roles of the HS sites are complex and are not yet completely understood. Studies with transgenic mice that contain individual or combinations of HS sites, deletions of specific HS sites, or deletions of the highly conserved core elements of the HS sites as well as experiments with knock-out mice have provided evidence of the roles of each HS site. HS2 and HS3 have been shown to exhibit the majority of the enhancing activity of the LCR (14Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and may participate in additive interactions (15Jackson J.D. Petrykowska H. Philipsen S. Miller W. Hardison R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11871-11878Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or synergistic interactions for long range enhancer activity (16Bresnick E.H. Tze L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4566-4571Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Mice with constructs containing HS2 alone maintain correct stage-specific expression of γ- and β-globin mRNA throughout development (10Lloyd J.A. Krakowsky J.M. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Morley B.J. Abbott C.A. Sharpe J.A. Lida J. Chan-Thomas P.S. Wood W.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 2057-2066Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and express equivalent levels of γ-globin mRNA in the embryo and β-globin mRNA in the fetus and adult (18Fraser P. Pruzina S. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In transgenic mouse studies in which HS2 is deleted from the intact human β-globin locus, there is only a small decrease in expression of the ε-, γ-, and β-globin genes, suggesting that at least some of the properties of HS2 may be functionally redundant (19Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.G. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6605-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). However, others have reported dramatic decreases in gene expression and loss of copy-number dependence when a similar transgene is integrated into heterochromatic regions in the mouse genome, suggesting a role for HS2 in overcoming position effects (20Milot E. Strouboulis J. Trimborn T. Wijgerde M. de Boer E. Langeveld A. Tan-Un K. Vergeer W. Yannoutsos N. Grosveld F. Cell. 1996; 87: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Deletion of murine HS2 in knock-out mice resulted in normal expression of the mouse embryonic genes but a 30% reduction of adult β-globin mRNA (21Ley T.J. Hug B. Fiering S. Epner E. Bender M.A. Groudine M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 850: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 22Fiering S. Epner E. Robinson K. Zhuang Y. Telling A. Hu M. Martin D.I.K. Enver T. Ley T.J. Groudine M. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 2203-2213Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar). The greater effect on the adult gene may be because of the longer distance between the β-globin gene and the LCR or gene order. It is important to consider that although mice are a convenient model for the investigation of human gene expression, with respect to HS2, the mouse β-globin locus and its regulation may not be identical to that of the human locus. Similar studies have concentrated on the role of HS3, because HS3 is known to demonstrate enhancing and chromatin-opening activities similar to those of HS2 (14Collis P. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice with constructs containing individual HS sites, it has been shown that HS3 is the most active site in enhancing γ-globin expression during the embryonic period and also supports γ-globin expression during fetal hematopoiesis (18Fraser P. Pruzina S. Antoniou M. Grosveld F. Genes Dev. 1993; 7: 106-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice containing an otherwise intact human β-globin locus, an HS3 deletion results in a significant decrease of ε-globin, an increase of γ-globin, and no change in β-globin gene expression (19Peterson K.R. Clegg C.H. Navas P.A. Norton E.J. Kimbrough T.G. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6605-6609Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The importance of HS3 in the human β-globin locus in overcoming position effects has also been observed in deletion studies (20Milot E. Strouboulis J. Trimborn T. Wijgerde M. de Boer E. Langeveld A. Tan-Un K. Vergeer W. Yannoutsos N. Grosveld F. Cell. 1996; 87: 105-114Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar). Deletion of murine HS3 produces alterations in the expression of the β-like globin genes similar to those caused by deletions of HS2 (21Ley T.J. Hug B. Fiering S. Epner E. Bender M.A. Groudine M. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1998; 850: 45-53Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar,23Hug B.A. Wesselschmidt R.L. Fiering S. Bender M.A. Epner E. Groudine M. Ley T.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 2906-2912Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transgenic mice with deletions of a 225-bp or a 234-bp human HS3 core have low or no detectable globin expression at all stages of development (24Bungert J. Dave U. Lim K.C. Lieuw K.H. Shavit J.A. Liu Q. Engel J.D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 3083-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar) or severely reduced ε-globin and no γ-globin mRNA (25Navas P.A. Peterson K.R. Li Q. Skarpidi E. Rohde A. Shaw S.E. Clegg C.H. Asano H. Stamatoyannopoulos G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 4188-4196Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although these results appear inconsistent with the studies that delete the entire HS site, they substantiate the importance of the flanking sequences of the HS sites in the activity of the LCR. If the sequences outside of the HS core interact with the gene promoters but lack the enhancing activity of the core element, then a dominant-negative effect may be observed (6Hardison R. Slightom J.L. Gumucio D.L. Goodman M. Stojanovic N. Miller W. Gene. 1997; 205: 73-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). This illustrates the value of studying each HS site in the context of its core and flanking sequences to define its role. In previous work using transgenic mice and transfection analyses, we have shown that the –136 to +56 region of the γ-globin promoter is necessary for competitive inhibition of β-globin gene expression in embryonic/fetal cells. A γ-globin gene with a −161 promoter can compete successfully with the β-globin gene; therefore, an element(s) downstream of –161 has a role in embryonic β-globin suppression (13Giang Sargent T. Buller A. Teachey D.T. McCanna K.S. Lloyd J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar,26Anderson K. Lloyd J. Ponce E. Crable S. Neuman J. Lingrel J. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1077-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This region of the γ-globin promoter contains a CACCC element, two CCAAT boxes, the stage selector element (SSE) and a TATA box (see Fig. 1). Targeted gene knock-outs in mice indicate that erythroid Kruppel-like factor (EKLF), which binds preferentially to the CACCC element in the β-globin promoter, is responsible for positively regulating this gene in the adult and has little direct effect on γ-globin gene expression (27Wijgerde M. Gribnau J. Trimborn T. Nuez B. Philipsen S. Grosveld F. Fraser P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 2894-2902Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar, 28Perkins A.C. Gaensler K.M.L. Orkin S.H. Proc. Natl.

Chem. 1995; 270: 1955-1959Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). It is plausible that an as yet unidentified γ-globin gene-specific CACCC binding factor exists and is important for developmental switching. Simultaneous mutations of the two CCAAT boxes in the γ-globin promoter have a negligible effect on γ- and β-globin gene expression in transgenic mice, so it does not appear that these elements play an independent role in β-globin suppression (30Ronchi A. Berry M. Raguz S. Imam A. Yannoutsos N. Ottolenghi S. Grosveld F. Dillon N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 143-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Stage selector protein (SSP) binds to the 19-bp SSE near base position −50 in the γ-globin promoter. The SSE is required for competitive inhibition of β-globin expression by a −260 γ-globin promoter in transient transfection assays in K562 cells, although a deletional mutation of the SSE element had little direct effect on γ-globin gene transcription in the same system (31Jane S.M. Ney P.A. Vanin E.F. Gumucio D.L. Nienhuis A.W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 2961-2969Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar,32Jane S.M. Nienhuis A.W. Cunningham J.M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 97-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). The current study aims to determine the roles of HS2 and HS3 from the LCR and of the CACCC, SSE, and TATA elements in the γ-globin promoter in the suppression of β-globin gene expression early in development using stable transfections in human HEL and K562 cells. We find that HS3, unlike HS2, does not consistently participate in competitive inhibition of β-globin expression by the γ-globin gene. The HS3HS2 configuration has the combined enhancing activity of HS2 and HS3 and also the developmental specificity of HS2, suggesting that HS2 and HS3 act most effectively in concert. The CACCC and TATA, but not the SSE, elements in the γ-globin promoter are involved in the inhibition of early β-globin gene expression. This work begins to identify the elements in the LCR and in the γ-globin promoter that bind factors to establish competitive inhibition. The constructs used in the stable transfection assays are shown in Fig. 2 and are HS3γβ, HS3β, HS3HS2γβ, HS3HS2β, HS3HS2γTATAβ, HS3HS2γCACCCβ, and HS3HS2γSSEβ. Those with HS2 contain a 1.9-kb KpnI-PvuII fragment (GenBank™ HUMHBB coordinates 7764–9653) normally located about 11 kb 5′ of the human ε-globin gene. The constructs containing HS3 have a 1.9-kb HindIII fragment (HUMHBB 3266–5172). The β-globin gene in these constructs is a 4.5-kb ApaI-EcoRV fragment (−1250 to +3291) containing the 3′ enhancer region. The LCRγβ constructs contain a HindIII fragment (−1350 to +1951) encompassing a derivative of the human Aγ-globin gene, situated between the LCR sequences and the β-globin gene. The γ- and β-globin genes in all of the constructs are marked by a 4-bp insertion, made by filling in an NcoI restriction site at position +50 using Klenow fragment to distinguish their mRNAs from the endogenous globin mRNAs. The mutations in the γ-globin promoter TATA, CACCC, and SSE elements were generated using the CLONTECH Transformer Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit. An oligonucleotide was used to mutate the TATA, CACCC, or SSE elements and create a new restriction enzyme site. In addition to the mutagenic primer, a second primer was used to abolish an MluI site in the IBI-30 polylinker to facilitate the selection of mutated clones. The TATA box included in the sequence 5′-ATAAAA-3′ near position –30 was mutated to a PstI restriction site (5′-CTGCAG-3′), the CACCC sequence included in the sequence 5′-CCACCC-3′ near position −140 was mutated to aScaI site (5′-AGTACT-3′), and the sequence 5′-GGCTGGCT-3′ beginning at position –58 within the SSE element was also mutated to include a ScaI site (5′-AGTACTAG-3′) (Fig.1). Approximately 260 bp of DNA surrounding each of the mutations was sequenced on both strands, and it was possible to verify that the mutation was present and to establish that there were no other sequence changes. HEL and K562 cells were grown in RPMI media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For each of the six transfections per construct, 2 × 106 (HEL) or 1 × 106 (K562) cells were electroporated with linearized plasmid DNA consisting of 35 μg of the globin construct and 5 μg of an SV40 early promoter neomycin resistance gene fusion construct. Two different plasmid preparations per construct were transfected. Pools of transfected cells were selected in 800 μg/ml and maintained in 600 μg/ml G418 sulfate (Mediatech, Inc.). Pools of cells were used to analyze the results of many different sites of insertion and thereby eliminate position effects. Erythroid differentiation of the transfected HEL and K562 cells was induced by treatment with 25 μm hemin for 3 days. RNA was prepared from cells harvested after induction. mRNA expression levels represent the average of at least two primer extension assays quantitated using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager. The oligonucleotide primers used are β-globin (5′-CAGGGCAGTAACGGCAGA-3′), which yields a 95-bp product for the endogenous and a 99-bp product for the marked β-globin mRNA, and γ-globin (5′-TGCCCCACAGGCTTGTGATA-3′), which yields a 105-bp product for the endogenous and a 109-bp product for the marked γ-globin mRNA. The levels of transfected β- and γ-globin mRNA are expressed as a ratio of the endogenous γ-globin mRNA as an internal control. Sequencing experiments to determine the two major alternative start sites for γ-globin mRNA in cells with the HS3HS2γTATAβ constructs were performed using the fmol sequencing kit (Promega) and the above primer from the γ-globin gene. The statistical analyses were performed using the nonparametric rank sum test, and all findings were judged to be significant at an α-level of ≤0.05. Our previous results indicate that HS2 can independently participate in competitive interactions between the γ- and β-globin genes in transgenic mice and tissue culture cells (10Lloyd J.A. Krakowsky J.M. Crable S.C. Lingrel J.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 1561-1567Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Giang Sargent T. Buller A. Teachey D.T. McCanna K.S. Lloyd J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This work tests the roles of HS3 alone and in combination with HS2 in these competitive interactions and examines the possibility that these HS sites act in concert to enhance β- and γ-globin expression in a developmental stage-specific manner. To test the role of HS3 in the competitive inhibition of β-globin expression, pools of HEL and of K562 cells were stably transfected with each of two constructs containing HS3 and a marked β- or γ- and β-globin gene (HS3β and HS3γβ, Fig.2 A). The transfected cells were induced with hemin, and globin gene expression was measured by primer extension assays using human β- and γ-globin probes (Fig.3). The amounts of mRNA from the transfected genes (γmk and βmk) were normalized to that of the endogenous γ-globin mRNA. The results depicted in TableI show that HS3 alone is an effective enhancer and can drive significant expression of the transfected genes. The transfected γ-globin mRNA is expressed at means of 21 and 13% in HEL and K562 cells with the HS3γβ construct, respectively. When comparing cells with the HS3β to those with the HS3γβ constructs, however, the presence of the γ-globin gene incis does not significantly reduce β-globin expression in HEL cells. β-Globin expression in HEL cells with and without the γ-globin gene is comparable at an average of 7 and 4%, respectively (Table I, Fig. 4). Although β-globin expression is significantly lower on average in K562 cells with the HS3γβ compared with the HS3β construct, there is variability between pools of cells. Some pools of cells with HS3γβ have less β-globin mRNA than HS3β pools, but others do not, indicating that HS3 alone does not consistently participate in competitive inhibition in either cell type. The amount of transfected β-globin mRNA was divided by the amount of transfected γ-globin mRNA for each pool of cells with the HS3γβ construct to calculate the β- to γ-globin mRNA ratios (Table I). The β/γ globin ratios are particularly useful for comparisons between transfections, because these values are not influenced by transfection efficiency. In HEL cells, the mean β/γ ratio is 26% even though the γ-globin gene is present in cis. The γ-globin gene therefore does not always compete strongly with the β-globin gene in the presence of HS3 alone. These data reveal that HS3 possesses enhancing activity, but compared with HS2, it is less consistently able to participate in the competitive interactions that normally suppress β-globin expression in an early erythroid environment. The amount of the transfected β-globin gene expressed is generally less for all of the constructs in K562 cells compared with HEL cells, perhaps because of the absence of EKLF in K562 cells (33Zhang W. Bieker J.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 9855-9860Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). For these and all of the transfections with other constructs discussed below, the mRNA expression levels in the tables are not divided by the average number of copies of the genes per cell, because in pools of cells with the same construct, a higher copy number correlated directly with lower expression per gene copy (data not shown).Table Iβ- and γ-globin gene expression in HEL and K562 cells with HS3 and HS3HS2 constructsConstructTransfection #βmk as % of γMean % βmk mRNAγmk as % of γMean % γmk mRNAβmk/γmkMean βmk/γmkHEL cellsHS3β111.16.929.335.444.554.2HS3γβ13.04.115.521.3*0.190.26*24.514.40.31313.814.40.9642.333.60.0750.232.70.0160.517.30.03HS3HS2β135.036.6*229.0352.3430.1HS3HS2γβ10.93.6*26.684.2*0.030.04*23.226.70.1230.217.10.0144.4123.60.0453.8106.20.0463.2104.60.0375.7114.30.0586.1122.40.0594.9116.40.04K562 cellsHS3β12.74.3*23.132.343.152.6612.2HS3γβ10.90.8*17.713.2*0.050.07*20.815.30.0531.311.30.1240.38.60.04HS3HS2β14.14.7*25.034.447.556.165.172.682.7HS3HS2γβ11.41.2*99.397.0*0.020.01*20.986.90.0131.399.00.0141.191.90.0151.3107.90.01The mRNAs are designated βmk for the transfected β-globin gene, γmk for the transfected γ-globin gene, and γ for the product of the endogenous gene.

The βmk/γmk ratio is the amount of β-globin divided by γ-globin mRNA. The asterisks indicate that the mean %γmk and the mean βmk/γmk ratios in each column are significantly different from each other, that the HS3HS2β and HS3HS2γβ transfections have a significantly different %βmk, and that the HS3β and HS3γβ transfections have a significantly different %βmk in K562 cells. The statistical analyses were performed using the rank sum test, which is valid in cases where the data do not fit a normal distribution. To investigate the ability of HS3 and HS2 to act together in β-globin suppression in early development, pools of HEL and of K562 cells were stably transfected with the HS3HS2β and HS3HS2γβ constructs (Fig. 2 A). Representative primer extension assays for the HEL cells are shown in Fig. 3. In contrast to the results with the HS3γβ and HS3β constructs, β-globin expression in both cell types is significantly suppressed in the HS3HS2γβ compared with the HS3HS2β transfected cells. HEL cells containing these constructs exhibit a 10-fold suppression in β-globin expression (36.6% for HS3HS2β and 3.6% for HS3HS2γβ), whereas K562 cells show a 4-fold suppression of β-globin expression (4.7 and 1.2% β-globin mRNA) (Table I). The developmental specificity of this LCR configuration is also demonstrated by the low β/γ ratio in cells with HS3HS2γβ compared with those with HS3γβ (Table I, Fig. 4). The β/γ ratios of 0.04 in HEL cells and 0.01 in K562 cells indicate that the adult β-globin gene is consistently less able to compete with the γ-globin gene when both HS3 and HS2 of the LCR are present than with HS3 alone. These data demonstrate that HS2 and HS3 act together to effectively provide developmental specificity. The effect of HS2 and HS3 on γ-globin expression may be elucidated by comparing the levels of γ-globin mRNA in cells with HS2γβ, HS3γβ, and HS3HS2γβ constructs. We have previously shown that cells with HS2γβ express γ-globin mRNA at an average of 46 and 53% endogenous γ-globin mRNA in HEL and K562 cells, respectively (Ref. 13Giang Sargent T. Buller A. Teachey D.T. McCanna K.S. Lloyd J.A. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar and data not shown). HEL cells with the HS3γβ construct express an average of 21% γ-globin mRNA compared with the endogenous γ-globin mRNA, and those with HS3HS2γβ express an average of 84% γ-globin mRNA (Table I). K562 cells with HS3γβ and HS3HS2γβ express 13 and 91% γ-globin mRNA, respectively (TableII). In both cell types, γ-globin expression with the HS3HS2γβ construct is significantly higher than with HS3γβ. Therefore, HS2 and HS3 act in at least an additive manner to effectively enhance γ-globin gene expression.Table IIβ- and γ-globin gene expression in HEL and K562 cells with γ-globin promoter mutant constructsConstructTransfection #βmk as % of γMean % βmk mRNAγmk as % of γMean % γmk mRNAβmk/γmkMean βmk/γmkHEL cellsHS3HS2γβ14.44.7123.6114.60.040.0423.8106.20.0433.2104.60.0345.7114.30.0556.1122.40.0564.9116.40.04HS3HS2γTATAβ16.224.1*42.153.3*0.150.39*27.736.50.2138.032.30.25429.960.70.49539.767.10.59653.081.00.66HS3HS2γCACCCβ114.210.4*90.696.9*0.160.11*27.4100.30.07312.499.10.1348.192.90.0959.099.00.09611.599.40.12HS3HS2γSSEβ18.66.8131.6120.50.070.0627.4142.90.0539.6158.60.0644.597.30.0555.093.00.0565.899.80.06K562 cellsHS3HS2γβ11.11.2103.586.70.010.0221.3103.10.0131.0105.70.0140.985.40.0151.456.60.0361.265.80.02HS3HS2γTATAβ11.52.1*29.729.5*0.050.08*21.840.80.0531.426.10.0642.926.50.1152.523.40.1162.630.70.09HS3HS2γCACCCβ12.81.7*57.444.2*0.050.04*21.735.20.0531.240.20.0341.554.40.0351.642.10.0461.535.70.04HS3HS2γSSEβ11.91.259.956.80.030.0221.353.00.0331.469.30.0240.144.80.00The mRNAs are designated βmk for the transfected β-globin gene, γmk for t"
https://openalex.org/W1975235708,"In contrast to yeast and mammalian systems, which depend principally on internal promoter elements for tRNA gene transcription, insect systems require additional upstream sequences. To understand the function of the upstream sequences, we have asked whether the Bombyx mori tRNACAla and tRNASGAla genes, which are absolutely dependent on these sequences in vitro, also require them for transcription in vivo. We introduced wild-type and mutant versions of the Bombyx tRNAAla genes intoDrosophila Schneider-2 cells and found that the tRNACAla gene is efficiently transcribed and that its transcription depends strongly on the distal segment of its upstream promoter. In contrast, the tRNASGAla gene is inefficiently transcribed, and this inefficiency results from lack of a specific sequence within the distal tRNACAla upstream promoter. This sequence, 5′-TTTATAT-3′, is sufficient to increase the activity of the tRNASGAla promoter to that of the tRNACAla promoter. Moreover, promoters containing the 5′-TTTATAT-3′ element are stimulated by increased levels of cellular TATA-binding protein. Together these results indicate that, in insect cells, a TATA-like element is specifically required to form functional TATA-binding protein-containing complexes that promote efficient transcription of tRNA genes.

Transcription of cloned genes in cell-free extracts has been widely used to define the promoters of tRNA genes. This approach has established the contribution of gene-internal promoter elements (reviewed in Refs. 1Kassavetis G.A. Bardeleben C. Bartholomew B. Braun B.R. Joazeiro C.A.P. Pisano M. Geiduschek E.P.

American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1994Crossref Google Scholar).In vivo assays to determine the biological relevance of the class III promoter elements defined in vitro have not been employed widely, but they suggest that at least some promoter elements identified in vitro are also required in vivo. For instance, the canonical A and B boxes function in vivoin yeast (3Kurjan J. Hall B.D. Gillam S. Smith M. Cell. 1980; 20: 701-709Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and trypanosomes (4Nakaar V. Dare A.O. Hong D. Ullu E. Tschudi C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6736-6742Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and 5′-flanking sequences appear to modulate promoter function in several organisms (5Francis M.A. RajBhandary U.L. Mol. Cell.

There has been no systematic analysis of the function of upstream flanking sequences in vivo in any system however. Such an analysis of silkworm tRNAAla genes could be particularly informative because transcription of these genes in vitro by homologous transcription machinery is strongly dependent on upstream sequences (2Sprague K.U. Transcription of Eukaryotic tRNA Genes. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1994Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, the two AT-rich sequence blocks that provide most of the upstream promoter function for the silkworm tRNACAla also occur in other silkworm RNA polymerase III (pol III) 1The abbreviations used are: pol III, RNA polymerase III; S2, Schneider-2; SG, tRNASGAla; C, tRNACAla; CAT, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase; TBP, TATA-binding protein; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s).templates (11Fournier A.

Biol. 1988; 8: 624-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). These sequences thus have the potential to comprise a class of general upstream promoter elements for polymerase III-dependent genes, something that has not been recognized in any other system (16Lofquist A.K. Garcia A.D. Sharp S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4441-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar, 17Raymond G.J. Johnson J.D.

Genet. 1987; 206: 279-284Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Upstream promoter elements are also responsible for the differential transcription in vitro of silk gland-specific (SG) and constitutive (C) silkworm tRNAAla genes (19Young L.S. Takahashi N. Sprague K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To determine whether upstream sequences contribute to promoter functionin vivo, we have transiently introduced wild-type and mutant tRNAAla genes into Drosophila Schneider-2 cells. Although they are heterologous, these cells can be transfected efficiently (>10% (20DiNocera P.P. Dawid I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar)), 2A. Trivedi, unpublished results. and the upstream sequence dependence of the Drosophila pol III transcription machinery suggests functional similarity to theBombyx machinery (reviewed in Refs. 2Sprague K.U. Transcription of Eukaryotic tRNA Genes. American Society for Microbiology Press, Washington, D. C.1994Crossref Google Scholar and 21Sharp S.J. Schaack J. Cooley L. Burke D.J. Söll D. CRC Crit. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 19: 107-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). In addition, because Drosophila S2 cells are not derived from silk glands, they provide an opportunity to ask whether C and SG upstream promoters are differentially active in non-silk gland cells as they are in non-silk gland extracts. In this paper we show that the activity of the tRNACAla upstream promoter inDrosophila S2 cells depends on a subset of the sequences required in vitro. Specifically, a TATA-like sequence located from positions −31 to −25 is the key element. Moreover, the wild-type C and SG upstream promoters are differentially activein vivo, and introduction of the TATA element raises SG promoter activity to the level of the C promoter. Overproduction of TBPin vivo stimulates promoter activity only if the TATA-like element is present. Thus, it is likely that in insect systems, the TATA-like element functions to facilitate the formation of active TBP-containing transcription complexes on tRNA genes. The parental wild-type constitutively expressed tRNAAla gene used in this work (tRNACAla) contained sequences from −34 to +215 (with respect to the transcription initiation site) cloned into a derivative of pUC13 in which the HindIII site had been replaced by an MluI site (pUC13M). Mutant derivatives of the upstream promoter from −11 to −34 were made in portions spanning the “D,” “TAT,” “I,” and “AT” regions using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis as described previously (13Palida F.A. Hale C. Sprague K.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5875-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The wild-type silk gland-specific upstream promoter used here was fused to a fully wild-type tRNACAla gene coding and downstream region. It was derived from a previous chimera (SCC (19Young L.S. Takahashi N. Sprague K.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 374-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar)) by using recombinant PCR (22Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press, New York1990: 177-188Google Scholar) to convert the tRNASGAla start site (+1 to +3 is AAC) to the tRNACAla start site (+1 to +3 is GTT). The chimeric tRNACAla/tRNASGAlaupstream promoter derivative in which the sequence−31TTTATAT−25 from the C promoter replaced the corresponding positions in the SG promoter was also constructed using recombinant PCR. To distinguish the products of introduced genes from endogenousDrosophila alanine tRNA, maxigene derivatives were made by cutting the genes at the unique internal SphI site and inserting a self-annealing, XhoI-containing oligonucleotide (5′-GCTCGAGCCATG-3′) to yield maxigenes with 12 additional bp (Cwt maxi). An additional Cwt maxi+8 was made by restricting a Cwt maxi construct with XhoI, filling in the XhoI ends with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and re-ligating. To make antisense probes for RNase protection assays, we cloned a Cwt maxi gene and a Cwt maxi+8 gene into pBluescript (pSK+), linearized these clones with BamHI, and used T7 RNA polymerase to generate antisense RNA (see below). Transient cotransfections were performed by a calcium phosphate precipitation technique (20DiNocera P.P. Dawid I.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1983; 80: 7095-7098Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar).Drosophila Schneider 2 cells were maintained at 25 °C in Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts). For transfections, cells were plated at 2.5 × 106 to 5 × 106 cells/25 mm2 in Corning brand tissue culture flasks. For each transfection, 6 μg of reporter plasmid DNA (tRNAAla gene constructs) and 2 μg of a transfection efficiency control plasmid (pActCAT or pZIL, a luciferase-containing plasmid (23Sethy-Coraci I. Moir R.D. Lopez-de-Leon A. Willis I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar)) were used. The final DNA concentration was brought to 20 μg with pBluescriptSK (pSK, Stratagene) or pUC DNAs. All transfections were performed 3–6 times. Medium was changed 24 h post-transfection, and cells were harvested the following day. Approximately 2 × 106cells (one-fifth of the total cells) were used to make extracts to assay for chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or luciferase activity. Four-fifths of the cells (8 × 106 cells) were used for RNA extraction to measure the transcription activity of the tRNA gene promoter. RNA was extracted using TriZOL (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the protocol provided by the vendor. The RNA yield was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm. A ribonuclease protection assay was performed on the RNAs isolated from transiently transfected cells, using an RPA II kit from Ambion. Briefly, a linearized plasmid containing the gene of interest served as a template for antisense transcript labeled with [α-32P]CTP (ICN, specific activity, >600 Ci/mmol), using the Maxiscript kit (Ambion). DNA was transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase, and the transcript was labeled with [α-32P]CTP (ICN, specific activity, >600 Ci/mmol). The probe was treated with DNase I to digest the template and was further purified by organic extractions and ethanol precipitation. Probe (0.5 × 106 to 1 × 106 cpm/reaction mixture) was hybridized with RNA (0.1–0.2 μg/reaction mixture) at 45 °C overnight and then digested with RNase T1 (200 units/reaction mixture) and prepared for electrophoresis as described by the RPA kit manufacturer. Electrophoresis was on 8 m urea-8% polyacrylamide gels, which were quantitated in two ways. 1) The gel was exposed to x-ray film for 30–120 min at −80 °C, and the resulting autoradiographs were quantitated using a Bioimage Scanner, or 2) the gel was exposed directly to a phosphor screen (Molecular Dynamics) for 60–120 min, and the data were collected using a Model 860 STORM PhosphorImager and quantitated using Image Quant software (Molecular Dynamics). The transfected cells were harvested and centrifuged, and the cell pellets (2 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 90 μl of 0.25 m Tris, pH 7.5, followed by repeated freeze-thaw cycles. The extracts were then diluted 1:50 to 1:500 in 0.25 m Tris, and 5 μl of the diluted extracts were used to assay for CAT activity. The assay was performed as described previously (24Sambrook J. Fritsch I. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: a Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 412-413Google Scholar). Products were analyzed by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and quantitated by scanning the autoradiograms in a Bioimage Scanner. The transfected cells were harvested and centrifuged, and the cell pellets (∼2 × 106 cells) were resuspended in 1 × cell lysis buffer (Promega) and assayed with the luciferase assay system (Promega) using a Flow Tech Model 3010 Luminometer. Cytoplasmic S100 extracts were made fromDrosophila S2 cells as described (25Dingermann T. Sharp S. Appel B. DeFranco D. Mount S. Neiermann R. Pongs O. Söll D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 3907-3918Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were grown in T65 cm2 tissue culture flasks inDrosophila Schneider medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (Gemini Bioproducts). Cells were grown to confluence (∼2 × 108 cells/flask) and harvested by scraping with a rubber policeman. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and the packed cell volume was determined. The cells were resuspended in 2 to 2.5 times the packed cell volume with hypotonic buffer (10 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 8, 10 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol) and allowed to swell for 30–90 min. Cells were homogenized in a Dounce homogenizer, using 20 strokes with the tight pestle. Isotonic buffer was added (1/10 the total cell volume) (0.3 m HEPES-KOH (pH 8), 1.27 m KCl, 40 mm MgCl2, 50 mm dithiothreitol), and the extract was centrifuged at 42,000 × g in a Ti60 rotor at 4 °C for 60 min. Glycerol was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 20–25%, and the extracts were stored at −80 °C. In vitro transcription reactions were carried out using 60–100 μg of protein/reaction mixture. Standard reaction mixtures contained 0.4 μg of DNA template, 0.5 mm each of ATP, UTP, and CTP, 0.1 mm GTP, 1–5 μCi of [α-32P]GTP (3000 Ci/mmol), 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mmdithiothreitol, 100 mm KCl, and 10% glycerol in a final reaction volume of 60 μl. Mutant phenotypes were independent of variations in the amount of template (see Fig. 1 B for a representative experiment) and nonspecific DNA in the reaction mixture (not shown). The amount of template ranged from 0.015 μg to 0.45 μg, and the phenotypes of all mutants were checked at a subsaturating amount of template (0.015 μg) in the presence and absence of 0.4 μg of nonspecific DNA. Reactions were carried out at room temperature for 1 h and stopped by the addition of sodium dodecyl sulfate to 0.1%. After the addition of proteinase K (400 μg/ml), samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, extracted once with phenol, and precipitated with ethanol. The transcripts were fractionated on 8m urea, 8% polyacrylamide gels, detected by exposure to x-ray film, and quantitated with a Bioimage Scanner. To determine whether the tRNACAlagene upstream promoter elements are recognized by theDrosophila transcription machinery, we first asked whether tRNACAla transcription depends on these elementsin vitro in Drosophila extracts. In these and subsequent experiments we used a set of mutants that systematically dissect the region between −15 and −34 of the tRNACAla gene. Within this region, two AT-rich sequences, “AT,” located at −15 to −20 relative to the transcription initiation site, and “TAT” at −25 to −29 had previously been shown to be important for transcription in silk gland extracts (13Palida F.A. Hale C. Sprague K.U. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 5875-5881Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). The sequence between TAT and AT (−21 to −24) is designated “I” (Intermediate), and the sequence upstream of TAT (−30 to −34) is designated “D” (Distal). In all cases, the mutant sequences that replace the wild-type sequences are GC-rich and do not alter the spacing of any presumptive promoter elements relative to one another or to the transcription initiation site. The series of mutants was designed to delineate promoter function with increasing resolution, starting with a mutant that alters most of the upstream promoter. Substitutions in the three contiguous sequence blocks, TAT, I, and AT, eliminate promoter activity inDrosophila extracts. Two of the mutants with substitutions in two adjoining blocks of sequence (D-TAT or TAT-I) eliminate transcription entirely, whereas the third such mutant (I-AT) reduces promoter activity by only ∼30% (Fig.1 A). These results contrast with those observed in Bombyx extracts in which mutation of D-TAT, TAT-I, and I-AT yields promoters with ∼40, ∼5, and 2% wild-type activity, respectively. In the Drosophila system, mutation of the TAT region alone abolishes transcriptional activity (Fig. 1 A), and mutation of the distal D region, by itself, reduces promoter activity 5-fold. In contrast, mutation of the AT region alone causes only about a 2-fold reduction. The observed mutant phenotypes were independent of DNA concentration (Fig. 1 B), and variations in template concentration did not reveal additional mutant phenotypes. Taken together, these results suggest that in theDrosophila system, promoter function is largely confined to the distal part of the promoter (TAT, plus its neighbors), whereas in the Bombyx system, it is distributed between the distal TAT and the proximal AT regions. For promoter analysis in vivo, we constructed derivatives of wild-type and mutant tRNACAla genes that were marked with unique internal sequences (described under “Experimental Procedures”) to distinguish their transcripts from those of endogenous tRNA genes. The introduced sequences had no effect on the transcriptional activity of the genes in vitro in either Bombyx orDrosophilaextracts. 3Data not shown. Drosophila S2 cells were cotransfected with the marked derivative of either a wild-type or a mutant tRNACAla gene, together with a transfection efficiency standard in the form of a CAT reporter driven by theDrosophila actin 5C promoter (26Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.2 A, when the wild-type tRNACAla gene marked by a 12-base pair insertion (Cwt maxi) was introduced into S2 cells, two new transcripts of ∼110 and 90 nucleotides were detected. To verify the identity of the protected RNAs, we introduced a different tRNACAlamaxigene derivative containing a longer inserted sequence (20 bp instead of 12 bp) and showed that the two transcripts migrated more slowly, as expected for the addition of 8 nucleotides. The set of promoter mutants that had been tested in vitro (Fig. 1 A) was introduced into Drosophila S2 cells. Fig. 2 B shows the primary data from representative assays, and Fig. 2 C shows the quantitative results, based on averages of at least three independent experiments. Simultaneous loss of the three sequence blocks, TAT, I, and AT, reduces promoter activity nearly 20-fold. Loss of only two regions is less deleterious. Removal of either the D-TAT or the TAT-I region reduces transcriptional activity 3- to 5-fold, and removal of the I-AT region has no detectable effect. The impact of losing individual smaller regions is more modest. As shown in Fig.2 C, mutation of the TAT region has the largest effect, reducing transcription 2-fold (to 44% of the wild-type level). Mutation of any of the other short sequence blocks has a smaller effect or none at all. To compare tRNACAla and tRNASGAla promoter activity in vivo, we used constructs that yield identical tRNACAlaprimary transcripts in order to avoid differences in transcript processing or stability. The two promoters were first tested in vitro in extracts from S2 cells. Fig.3 A shows that the tRNASGAla promoter is at least 100-fold less active than the tRNACAla promoter, as expected from previous studies in other non-silk gland extracts. When these two promoters were tested in vivo, they also directed transcription with different efficiencies. As shown in Fig.3 B, the signal from the tRNACAlapromoter is 50-fold higher than that from the tRNASGAla promoter. This difference was independent of the amount of template used over the range tested (2–8 μg). What sequences in the upstream promoter are key discriminators between C and SG? The critical distal portion of the C promoter contains several overlapping AT-rich sequences that resemble binding sites for the TATA-binding protein. TATA boxes known to bind TBP are located in this position in pol II-transcribed genes (27Sawadogo M. Sentenac A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 711-754Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar) as well as in the pol III-transcribed gene, U6 (28White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar). Interestingly, these TATA-like sequences are absent from the corresponding region of the SG promoter. Extensive point mutation indicates that the TATA-like sequence TTTATAT from −31 to −25 is the most effective of the distal AT-rich sequences for C promoter activity in vitro in Bombyxextracts. 4C. Ouyang, M. J. Martinez, L. S. Young, and K. U. Sprague, manuscript in preparation. To ask whether this sequence could rescue the activity of the SG promoter inDrosophila cells, we constructed a chimeric C/SG promoter that placed the sequence in the corresponding position (−31 to −25) in the SG promoter (Fig. 4 A). The T at position −24 in the SG promoter was mutated to a C to prevent the fortuitous introduction of additional TATA-like sequences. The data in Fig. 4 B show that the promoter activity of this chimera is indistinguishable from that of the wild-type C promoter, bothin vitro and in vivo. The analysis of mutant tRNACAla promoters, as well as the chimeric tRNACAla/tRNASGAla promoter, indicates the functional importance of the TATA sequence in vitro and in vivo. Since this sequence resembles an optimal TBP binding site (29Wong J.M. Bateman E. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 1890-1896Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), and since TBP is required for transcription of tRNA genes in this and other systems (28White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar), a plausible role for the sequence is to provide the C promoter with DNA contacts for TBP. Lack of the sequence in the wild-type SG promoter might prevent proper interaction with TBP. To test this idea, we performed transient transfections in an S2 cell line that was stably transformed with epitope-tagged Drosophila TBP under the control of a metallothionein promoter (26Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Previous experiments had demonstrated that TBP is limiting for class III promoter activity in this cell type (26Trivedi A. Vilalta A. Gopalan S. Johnson D.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6909-6916Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 5, the wild-type C and SG promoters respond differently to TBP overproduction. TBP concentrations sufficient to increase the activity of the C promoter ∼2.5-fold do not stimulate the SG promoter. In contrast, the chimeric TATA-containing SG promoter responds to increased TBP concentrations just as the wild-type C promoter does. We have shown that sequences upstream of the BombyxtRNAAla gene are functional as promoter elements in vivo in Drosophila S2 cells. Within this region, the TAT segment (−29 to −25) is the most important short sequence. Although tRNA promoter function is similar in vivo andin vitro, there are differences in detail. For instance, the effect of mutating short (4–5 bp) promoter sequences is less pronounced in vivo than it is in vitro. This result could suggest that sequence-specific interactions between transcription factors and upstream DNA do not occur in vivo,but the 20-fold effect of a 15-base pair substitution argues that they do. We think it likely that differences in the relative concentrations of particular transcription factors account for the disparity betweenin vitro and in vivo data. For example, TFIIIB, the transcription factor complex that binds the tRNACAla upstream promoter in vitro(30Young L.S. Ahnert N. Sprague K.U. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar), may be less concentrated in the extracts and fractions usedin vitro than it is within cells. The phenotypic variation observed in vitro and in vivo inXenopus systems has been attributed to differences in the concentrations of various transcription factors (31Keller H.J. You Q. Romaniuk P.J. Gottesfeld J.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5166-5176Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 32Wolffe A.P. Morse R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 4592-4599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Brown D.D. Schlissel M.S. Cell. 1985; 42: 759-767Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Moreover, quantitative Western blot analysis has shown directly that the components of yeast TFIIIB are at least 100-fold more concentratedin vivo than they are in typical yeast transcription extracts (23Sethy-Coraci I. Moir R.D. Lopez-de-Leon A. Willis I.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 2344-2352Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). If a similar relationship exists forDrosophila cells and extracts, efficient incorporation of TFIIIB into transcription complexes could require a higher affinity TFIIIB binding site in vitro than it does in vivo, and, therefore, depend more heavily on a complete set of protein-DNA contacts. Certain promoter mutants are differentially impaired in theDrosophila and the Bombyx systems (see Fig.6). Since in Drosophila these mutants have similar effects in vitro and in vivo, the observed differences most likely reflect true functional divergence between the Drosophila and Bombyxtranscription machineries. The most obvious example is the strong dependence of the Drosophila transcription machinery on the distal portion of the promoter that includes the TAT region. This contrasts with the dependence of the Bombyx machinery on sequences in both the distal and proximal portions of the promoter, in particular on the TAT and AT sequences. The different predilections shown by the Drosophila andBombyx systems in these experiments fit with previous indications that the Drosophila transcription machinery is particularly sensitive to mutation of Drosophila pol III templates at about −25 (a position equivalent to BombyxTAT), but is relatively indifferent to mutation closer to the transcription initiation site. Specifically, alteration of the natural sequences between 30 and 20 bp upstream of the transcription start site reduces the capacity of three different Drosophila tRNA genes (tRNAArg (34Schaack J. Sharp S. Dingermann T. Johnson-Burke D. Cooley L. Söll D. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 1461-1467Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), tRNAVal (18Sajjadi F.G. Miller Jr., R.C. Spiegelman G.B. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1987; 206: 279-284Crossref Scopus (11) Google Scholar), tRNAAsn (16Lofquist A.K. Garcia A.D. Sharp S.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 4441-4449Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar)) and a Drosophila 5 S RNA gene (35Sharp S.J. Garcia A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) to direct transcription in Drosophila extracts. Although these effects are pronounced, a common sequence motif responsible for the activity of the wild-type −30 to −20 regions is not apparent. It is striking, however, that part of the critical region of the Drosophila 5 S RNA gene (−31 to −27: TATAA) strongly resembles the Bombyx TAT region (−29 to −25: TATAT). Mutation of this sequence alone eliminates 5 S transcriptional activity (35Sharp S.J. Garcia A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In contrast, mutation of the region equivalent in position to the AT element (−20 to −15) has a much smaller effect (35Sharp S.J. Garcia A.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1988; 8: 1266-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). These results suggest that the transcriptional enhancement due to the TATA-like sequence in Bombyx tRNA genes may reflect a general mechanism used in insect cells to increase the activities of specific 5 S and tRNA genes. The Drosophila S2 assay system revealed that the C and SG promoters are differentially active in vivo, as they arein vitro. The lack of the sequence TTTATAT (−31 to −25) in the SG promoter appears to account for the activity difference, since addition of this sequence endows an otherwise inactive SG promoter with an activity indistinguishable from that of a wild-type C promoter. What function does this sequence provide? Preliminary results indicate that it can be bound by purified silkworm TBP. Does this TBP-DNA interaction contribute to C promoter activity? The geometry of yeast transcription complexes suggests that it could, since the preferred geometry for transcription complexes formed on the wild-type SUP4tRNATyr gene is one that places the upstream edge of TBP near the base pair at −30 (36Joazeiro C.A. Kassavetis G.A. Geiduschek E.P. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 725-739Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). By analogy, the location of the TTTATAT sequence in the C promoter should allow it to be contacted by TBP whose position is established by protein-protein contacts within the transcription complex. Thus, the primary role of this sequence may be to supply the C promoter with DNA contacts that add to protein contacts to create a high affinity TBP binding site. Lack of a comparable sequence may enfeeble the SG promoter. In contrast to our results, previous studies have indicated that specific TBP-DNA contact is not required for transcription of 5 S and tRNA genes by pol III. In all systems tested, TFIIIB recruitment to these templates does not occur through DNA binding alone but depends on protein-protein interactions with TFIIIC (28White R.J. RNA Polymerase III Transcription. Springer-Verlag, Berlin1998Crossref Google Scholar). Moreover, there is direct evidence in yeast that specific interaction of TBP with a TATA element does not make a major contribution to TFIIIB recruitment, since mutation of the DNA binding domain of TBP has no effect on 5 S and tRNA transcription (37Schultz M.C. Reeder R.H. Hahn S. Cell. 1992; 69: 697-702Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Thus our results provide new evidence that, at least in insect cells, direct contact of TBP with DNA through a TATA element may be necessary for productive association of TFIIIB with the promoter.

https://openalex.org/W2083900102,"Genetic studies of Saccharomyces cerevisiae have identified many components acting to deliver specific proteins to their cellular locations. Genome analysis, however, has indicated that additional genes may also participate in such protein trafficking. The product of the yeast Yarrowia lipolytica TSR1 gene promotes the signal recognition particle-dependent translocation of secretory proteins through the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we describe the identification of a new gene family of proteins that is well conserved among different yeast species. The TSR1 genes encode polypeptides that share the same protein domain distribution and, like Tsr1p, may play an important role in the early steps of the signal recognition particle-dependent translocation pathway. We have identified five homologues of the TSR1 gene, four of them from the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the other fromHansenula polymorpha. We generated a null mutation in theS. cerevisiae YHC8 gene, the closest homologue to Y. lipolytica TSR1, and used different soluble (carboxypeptidase Y, α-factor, invertase) and membrane (dipeptidyl-aminopeptidase) secretory proteins to study its phenotype. A large accumulation of soluble protein precursors was detected in the mutant strain. Immunofluorescence experiments show that Yhc8p is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. We propose that the YHC8 gene is a new and important component of the S. cerevisiaeendoplasmic reticulum membrane and that it functions in protein translocation/insertion of secretory proteins through or into this compartment."
