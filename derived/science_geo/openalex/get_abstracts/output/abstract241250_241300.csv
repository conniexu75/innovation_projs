https://openalex.org/W2139582953,"Plants and animals use small RNAs (microRNAs [miRNAs] and siRNAs) as guides for posttranscriptional and epigenetic regulation. In plants, miRNAs and trans-acting (ta) siRNAs form through distinct biogenesis pathways, although they both interact with target transcripts and guide cleavage. An integrated approach to identify targets of Arabidopsis thaliana miRNAs and ta-siRNAs revealed several new classes of small RNA-regulated genes, including conventional genes such as Argonaute2 and an E2-ubiquitin conjugating enzyme. Surprisingly, five ta-siRNA-generating transcripts were identified as targets of miR173 or miR390. Rather than functioning as negative regulators, miR173- and miR390-guided cleavage was shown to set the 21-nucleotide phase for ta-siRNA precursor processing. These data support a model in which miRNA-guided formation of a 5' or 3' terminus within pre-ta-siRNA transcripts, followed by RDR6-dependent formation of dsRNA and Dicer-like processing, yields phased ta-siRNAs that negatively regulate other genes."
https://openalex.org/W2036084760,"The potential for human neuroimaging to read out the detailed contents of a person's mental state has yet to be fully explored. We investigated whether the perception of edge orientation, a fundamental visual feature, can be decoded from human brain activity measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Using statistical algorithms to classify brain states, we found that ensemble fMRI signals in early visual areas could reliably predict on individual trials which of eight stimulus orientations the subject was seeing. Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents."
https://openalex.org/W2041811289,"Tuberous sclerosis (TSC) is a tumor syndrome caused by mutation in TSC1 or TSC2 genes. TSC tumorigenesis is not always accompanied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH). Recently, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) has been found activated in TSC lesions lacking TSC1 or TSC2 LOH. Here, we show that Erk may play a critical role in TSC progression through posttranslational inactivation of TSC2. Erk-dependent phosphorylation leads to TSC1-TSC2 dissociation and markedly impairs TSC2 ability to inhibit mTOR signaling, cell proliferation, and oncogenic transformation. Importantly, expression of an Erk nonphosphorylatable TSC2 mutant in TSC2+/- tumor cells where Erk is constitutively activated blocks tumorigenecity in vivo, while wild-type TSC2 is ineffective. Our findings position the Ras/MAPK pathway upstream of the TSC complex and suggest that Erk may modulate mTOR signaling and contribute to disease progression through phosphorylation and inactivation of TSC2."

The current model implicates that the first lineage commitment step of adult pluripotent HSCs results in a strict separation into common lymphoid and common myeloid precursors. We present evidence for a population of cells which, although sustaining a high proliferative and combined lympho-myeloid differentiation potential, have lost the ability to adopt erythroid and megakaryocyte lineage fates. Cells in the Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+ HSC compartment coexpressing high levels of the tyrosine kinase receptor Flt3 sustain granulocyte, monocyte, and B and T cell potentials but in contrast to Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+Flt3− HSCs fail to produce significant erythroid and megakaryocytic progeny. This distinct lineage restriction site is accompanied by downregulation of genes for regulators of erythroid and megakaryocyte development. In agreement with representing a lymphoid primed progenitor, Lin−Sca-1+c-kit+CD34+Flt3+ cells display upregulated IL-7 receptor gene expression. Based on these observations, we propose a revised road map for adult blood lineage development. All blood cell lineages derive from a common hematopoietic stem cell (HSC).

Differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic stem cells.Blood. 1993; 81: 2844-2853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although molecular pathways (cytokine receptors and transcription factors) regulating the development of the different blood cell lineages have been identified (Metcalf, 1993Metcalf D.

Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Stem cells, cancer, and cancer stem cells.Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7396) Google Scholar). Importantly, this model proposes that short-term HSCs (ST-HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs), although having reduced self-renewal capacity, sustain the full lympho-myeloid lineage potentials of long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs) (Reya et al., 2001Reya T.

The LSKCD34+Flt3− ST-HSC population gives rise to a third population of LSK cells, all coexpressing Flt3 and CD34 and representing as much as 50% of the LSK HSC compartment (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Monch K. Astrand-Grundstrom I. Sitnicka E. Sasaki Y. Jacobsen S.E.

Upon transplantation LSKCD34+Flt3+ (hereafter called LSK Flt3+) cells give primarily rise to rapid and robust lymphoid reconstitution (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D.

A role for Flt3 in early lymphoid development has been further substantiated in studies of mice deficient in expression of Flt3 or its ligand, as these mice have reductions in early B and T cell progenitors as well as the CLPs (Mackarehtschian et al., 1995Mackarehtschian K.

Furthermore and in line with the documented synergistic interaction between Flt3 ligand (FL) and IL-7 on uncommitted progenitors (Veiby et al., 1996Veiby O.P. Lyman S.D. Jacobsen S.E. Combined signaling through interleukin-7 receptors and flt3 but not c-kit potently and selectively promotes B-cell commitment and differentiation from uncommitted murine bone marrow progenitor cells.Blood. 1996; 88: 1256-1265Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), mice double deficient in FL and interleukin-7 receptor α (IL-7Rα) expression lack mature B cells and evidence for B cell commitment in fetal as well as adult hematopoiesis (Sitnicka et al., 2003Sitnicka E.

Med. 2003; 198: 1495-1506Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Although having a lymphoid-dominated short-term reconstitution potential, LSK Flt3+ cells possess, at the single-cell level, a combined myeloid (granulocyte-monocyte; GM) and lymphoid (B and T cell) differentiation potential (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Monch K. Astrand-Grundstrom I. Sitnicka E. Sasaki Y. Jacobsen S.E.

Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Stem cells, cancer, and cancer stem cells.Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7396) Google Scholar), also possess a megakaryocyte (Mk) and erythroid (E) differentiation potential. However, in contrast to LSKCD34+Flt3− ST-HSCs and megakaryocyte/erythroid progenitors (MkEPs), LSK Flt3+ cells lack in vivo day 8 clonogenic colony-forming unit spleen (CFU-Sd8) activity (Yang et al., 2005Yang L. Bryder D. Adolfsson J. Nygren J. Mansson R. Sigvardsson M. Jacobsen S.

McCulloch E.A. A direct measurement of the radiation sensitivity of normal mouse bone marrow cells.Radiat. Res. 1961; 14: 213-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (3122) Google Scholar). Since the CD45 (common leukocyte antigen) congenic mouse model typically used to assess HSC reconstitution and lineage potentials (Bryder and Jacobsen, 2000Bryder D. Jacobsen S.E. Interleukin-3 supports expansion of long-term multilineage repopulating activity after multiple stem cell divisions in vitro.Blood. 2000; 96: 1748-1755PubMed Google Scholar) prevents direct evaluation of Mk and E lineage potentials (as platelets and erythrocytes do not express CD45), we here applied a number of complimentary in vitro and in vivo approaches to directly evaluate the Mk and E potentials of LSK Flt3+ cells. Herein, we provide compelling evidence for a novel route for early blood lineage commitment and development, in that LSK Flt3+ cells, although sustaining a high proliferative and combined lympho-myeloid differentiation potential, have lost the ability to significantly adapt Mk and E lineage fates and in agreement with this downregulate expression of a number of genes critically involved in development of these lineages. We recently demonstrated that LSK Flt3+ BM cells, although predominantly and efficiently reconstituting lymphopoiesis in vivo, have a combined B, T, and myeloid differentiation potential (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Monch K. Astrand-Grundstrom I. Sitnicka E. Sasaki Y. Jacobsen S.E.

Specifically, using clonal assays, 95% of single LSK Flt3+ cells possessed an M, 85% G, and 45% a combined B and T cell potential, demonstrating that a large fraction of LSK Flt3+ cells have a combined macrophage, granulocyte, B, and T cell potential (Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Monch K. Astrand-Grundstrom I. Sitnicka E. Sasaki Y. Jacobsen S.E.

Here, to directly confirm their lympho-myeloid potential, highly purified (>97%) LSK Flt3+ cells (25% highest Flt3 expressing LSK cells; Figure 1A ; Adolfsson et al., 2001Adolfsson J. Borge O.J. Bryder D. Theilgaard-Monch K. Astrand-Grundstrom I. Sitnicka E. Sasaki Y. Jacobsen S.E.

As much as 67% of all single LSK Flt3+ cells demonstrated sufficient clonal growth to be evaluated in this assay, of which 70% revealed a combined B and GM potential (Figure 1B). We also investigated the B cell potential of LSK Flt3+ cells on the OP9 cell line that efficiently supports B cell development (Vieira and Cumano, 2004Vieira P. Cumano A. Differentiation of B lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 271: 67-76PubMed Google Scholar). When cultured on OP9 for 14–28 days, all single LSK Flt3+-derived clones (40% cloning efficiency) produced B220+CD19+ B cells (Figure 1C). The recent development of the OP9 cell line expressing the notch ligand delta like1 (OP9-DL1) has dramatically enhanced the efficiency by which cells with T cell potential can be detected from uncommitted progenitors in vitro (Schmitt and Zuniga-Pflucker, 2002Schmitt T.M. Zuniga-Pflucker J.C.

Cumano A. Differentiation of B lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells.Methods Mol. Biol. 2004; 271: 67-76PubMed Google Scholar). When cultured on OP9-DL1, as much as 91% of LSK Flt3+ single cell-derived clones (50% cloning efficiency) contained CD3ϵ-, CD4-, and CD8α-expressing cells (Figure 1C). Noteworthy, in clones investigated, we concomitantly to T cell development frequently also observed production of Mac-1+ myeloid cells (data not shown). In further support of their T cell potential, we also investigated by PCR the single LSKflt3+-derived clones on OP9-DL1 for expression of the early T cell-restricted genes CD3ϵ and LcK. Whereas uncultured LSK Flt3+ cells and OP9-DL1 cells lacked detectable expression of these genes, as much as 15 out of 16 (94%) investigated single LSK Flt3+ clones derived on OP9-DL1 expressed both of these genes (Figure 1D), demonstrating efficient commitment of LSK Flt3+ cells along the T-lineage pathway. We also analyzed the recombination status at the TCRβ locus and found that 11 out of 12 (92%) analyzed LSK Flt3+-derived clones showed DJ rearrangements. These were mainly D2-Jβ2.1 but other recombination events could be detected as well (Figure 1E). Thus, a majority of LSK Flt3+ cells possess a combined granulocyte, monocyte, B, and T cell potentials. The current model for hematopoietic development suggests that the first lineage commitment step of HSCs leads to a strict separation of myelopoiesis (GM and megakaryocyte/erythroid; Mk and E lineages) and lymphopoiesis (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K.

Morrison S.J. Clarke M.F. Weissman I.L. Stem cells, cancer, and cancer stem cells.Nature. 2001; 414: 105-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (7396) Google Scholar). According to this model, LSK Flt3+ cells having a combined B, T, and GM potential should also possess a Mk and E developmental potential. Since the Mk and E lineages upon differentiation cease to express the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45, typically used to track all other blood cell lineages in vivo (Bryder and Jacobsen, 2000Bryder D. Jacobsen S.E. Interleukin-3 supports expansion of long-term multilineage repopulating activity after multiple stem cell divisions in vitro.Blood. 2000; 96: 1748-1755PubMed Google Scholar), we here first compared the in vitro Mk potential of highly purified LSK Flt3+ and LSK Flt3− cells containing LSKCD34−Flt3− LT-HSCs but predominantly LSKCD34+Flt3− ST-HSCs (Yang et al., 2005Yang L. Bryder D. Adolfsson J. Nygren J. Mansson R. Sigvardsson M. Jacobsen S. Identification of Lin−Sca1+kit+CD34+Flt3− short-term hematopoietic stem cells capable of rapidly reconstituting and rescuing myeloablated recipients.Blood. 2005; 105 (Published online November 30, 2004): 2717-2723https://doi.org/10.1182/blood-2004-06-2159Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Strikingly, whereas as much as 57% of single LSK Flt3− cells produced Mk in response to a cytokine combination that included thrombopoietin (TPO), the primary regulator of Mk production (Gurney et al., 1994Gurney A.L. Carver-Moore K. de Sauvage F.J. Moore M.W. Thrombocytopenia in c-mpl-deficient mice.Science. 1994; 265: 1445-1447Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar), only 2% of purified LSK Flt3+ cells produced Mk under the same conditions (KL + FL + TPO + IL-3; KFT3) (Figure 2A ). Furthermore, whereas almost 40% of LSK Flt3− cells produced Mk also in the absence of TPO (KL + IL-3 + EPO + IL-11; K3E11), no Mk development was observed from LSK Flt3+ cells (Figure 2A). Testing of other cytokine combinations and culture conditions efficiently promoting Mk development of LSK Flt3− cells also failed to promote significant Mk development from LSK Flt3+ cells (J.A. and S.E.J., unpublished data). The inability of LSK Flt3+ cells to generate Mk in vitro was not due to different lineage differentiation kinetics of LSK Flt3+ and LSK Flt3− cells, as single LSK Flt3− cells at high frequencies efficiently produced Mk by 8 and 10 days (Figure 2B) as well as 12–15 days (Figure 2A) following initiation of culture, whereas few or no Mk were observed at any time point from LSK Flt3+ cells. The Mk and E lineages are developmentally closely linked and share a common progenitor (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T. Weissman I.L. A clonogenic common myeloid progenitor that gives rise to all myeloid lineages.Nature. 2000; 404: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (1815) Google Scholar). Thus, experiments were next designed to also investigate the erythroid differentiation potential of LSK Flt3+ cells in vitro. To pursue this, we developed a new efficient and highly specific assay for directly investigating the erythroid potential of uncommitted progenitor/stem cells at the single cell level (see the Experimental Procedures). Single LSK Flt3− and LSK Flt3+ cells were cultured under conditions and in a cytokine combination (KFT3E) efficiently supporting myelo-erythroid development, and after 14–15 days, clonally derived cells were investigated by FACS for generation of erythroid (TER119+Gr-1/Mac-1−) progeny. As much as 53% of single LSK Flt3− cells generated TER119+Gr-1/Mac-1− erythroid progeny (Figures 2C and 2D). In contrast, whereas LSK Flt3+ cells efficiently generated myeloid (GM; Gr-1/Mac-1+TER119−) progeny, only 3% (one out of 34 cells investigated) produced erythroid progeny (Figures 2C and 2D). Thus, purified LSK Flt3+ cells lack (beyond the frequency of contaminating LSK Flt3− cells; 1%–3%; Experimental Procedures) signficant in vitro Mk and E differentiation potential. The inability of most LSK Flt3+ cells to produce megakaryocytic and erythroid progeny in vitro could potentially be due to the utilized conditions not providing the optimal/unique signals required for Mk and E development from this stem/progenitor cell population. Thus, we next designed in vivo experiments to further investigate the Mk and E potentials of LSK Flt3+ cells. Since Mk progenitors, but not platelets or mature Mk, express the panhematopoietic marker CD45, we used the CD45 congenic mouse model (Bryder and Jacobsen, 2000Bryder D. Jacobsen S.E. Interleukin-3 supports expansion of long-term multilineage repopulating activity after multiple stem cell divisions in vitro.Blood. 2000; 96: 1748-1755PubMed Google Scholar) to compare the ability of transplanted LSKCD34+Flt3− ST-HSCs and LSK Flt3+ cells to generate Mk progenitors (CFU-Mk) following lethal myeloablation (Figure 3A ). Importantly, complete myeloablation results in severe/lethal thrombocytopenia (Kempf et al., 1980Kempf R.A. Leibel S.A. Perlin E. Severe thrombocytopenia following total body irradiation.Int. J. Radiat. Oncol. Biol. Phys. 1980; 6: 252Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar, Uchida et al., 1998Uchida N. Tsukamoto A. He D. Friera A.M. Scollay R. Weissman I.L.

Invest. 1998; 101: 961-966Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), thereby activating pathways promoting Mk development. One week following transplantation of 10,000 LSKCD34+Flt3− or LSK Flt3+ cells (CD45.1) in competition with 200,000 unfractionated BM cells (CD45.2), the spleens (and BMs; data not shown) of recipient mice (CD45.2) were highly and comparably reconstituted by (CD45.1+) LSK Flt3+ (mean reconstitution 77%) and LSKCD34+Flt3− (mean reconstitution 75%) cells. However, whereas more than 80 Mk progenitors were generated per transplanted LSKCD34+Flt3− cell at this time, Mk progenitors were almost undetectable among the cells derived from reconstituting LSK Flt3+ cells (Figure 3B), and mice transplanted with low numbers of LSKCD34+Flt3− cells, corresponding to the contamination within sorted LSK Flt3+ cells (1%–3% as determined by reanalysis), demonstrated that the very low numbers of Mk progenitors generated from purified LSK Flt3+ cells could be derived from contaminating LSKCD34+Flt3− cells (J.A. and S.E.J., unpublished data). In contrast, LSK Flt3+ cells produced GM progenitors following transplantation (>100 per transplanted cell), although less than LSK Flt3− cells (Figure 3C). Experiments were next designed to also investigate the erythroid differentiation potential of LSK Flt3+ cells in vivo, again taking advantage of lethally irradiated mice developing severe cytopenia and providing an environment permissive for E development. However, since mature erythrocytes lack expression of CD45, we utilized congenic mice expressing different hemoglobin isoforms as donors (Hbbs) and recipients (Hbbd) of LSK Flt3+ and LSKCD34+Flt3− cells (Figures 4A and 4B ). Two hundred LSK Flt3+ or LSKCD34+Flt3− (Hbbs) cells were transplanted in competition with 200,000 BM cells (Hbbd) into lethally irradiated recipients (Hbbd). Three and four weeks posttransplantation, LSKCD34+Flt3− cells contributed substantially to E reconstitution in all (13/13) mice by as much as 18% and 16%, respectively, whereas only one of thirteen mice showed detectable E reconstitution from transplanted LSK Flt3+ cells (Figures 4A and 4B), although the contribution to other blood lineages (B, T, and myeloid cells) was as much as 14% ± 5% and comparable to that of LSKCD34+Flt3− cells (22% ± 14%). Thus, in contrast to LSKCD34+Flt3− cells, most LSK Flt3+ cells lack in vitro as well as in vivo Mk and E development potential. Our finding that LSK Flt3+ cells sustain B, T, M, and G potential but lack significant Mk and E potential could be compatible with CMPs’ (Akashi et al., 2000Akashi K. Traver D. Miyamoto T.

Thus, we next compared the combined GM and MkE potentials of single LSK Flt3− cells and CMPs. As recent studies had demonstrated that only the Flt3− fraction of CMPs is myeloid restricted (D'Amico and Wu, 2003D'Amico A. Wu L. The early progenitors of mouse dendritic cells and plasmacytoid predendritic cells are within the bone marrow hemopoietic precursors expressing Flt3.J. Exp. Med. 2003; 198: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), we purified Flt3− CMPs (Lin−IL-7Rα−Sca-1−c-kit+CD34+FcR−Flt3−; see Figure S1 in the Supplemental Data available with this article online). Importantly, no analyzed Flt3− CMPs generated B or T cells on OP9 (1440 cells total; n = 3) and OP9-DL1 (1440 cells total; n = 3), respectively (Figure 4C). Using culture conditions promoting both MkE and GM differentiation (Experimental Procedures and Figure 4), as much as 83% (n = 8) and 60% (n = 5) of single LSK Flt3− cells and Flt3− CMPs formed clones, respectively.

One such modification, histone methylation, contributes to human cancer through deregulation of cancer-relevant genes. The yeast Dot1 and its human counterpart, hDOT1L, methylate lysine 79 located within the globular domain of histone H3. Here we report that hDOT1L interacts with AF10, an MLL (mixed lineage leukemia) fusion partner involved in acute myeloid leukemia, through the OM-LZ region of AF10 required for MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis. We demonstrate that direct fusion of hDOT1L to MLL results in leukemic transformation in an hDOT1L methyltransferase activity-dependent manner. Transformation by MLL-hDOT1L and MLL-AF10 results in upregulation of a number of leukemia-relevant genes, such as Hoxa9, concomitant with hypermethylation of H3-K79. Our studies thus establish that mistargeting of hDOT1L to Hoxa9 plays an important role in MLL-AF10-mediated leukemogenesis and suggests that the enzymatic activity of hDOT1L may provide a potential target for therapeutic intervention."
https://openalex.org/W2110516310,"Prions are unconventional infectious agents responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) diseases. They are thought to be composed exclusively of the protease-resistant prion protein (PrPres) that replicates in the body by inducing the misfolding of the cellular prion protein (PrPC). Although compelling evidence supports this hypothesis, generation of infectious prion particles in vitro has not been convincingly demonstrated. Here we show that PrPC --> PrPres conversion can be mimicked in vitro by cyclic amplification of protein misfolding, resulting in indefinite amplification of PrPres. The in vitro-generated forms of PrPres share similar biochemical and structural properties with PrPres derived from sick brains. Inoculation of wild-type hamsters with in vitro-produced PrPres led to a scrapie disease identical to the illness produced by brain infectious material. These findings demonstrate that prions can be generated in vitro and provide strong evidence in support of the protein-only hypothesis of prion transmission."
https://openalex.org/W2102864788,"Cystic renal diseases are caused by mutations of proteins that share a unique subcellular localization: the primary cilium of tubular epithelial cells. Mutations of the ciliary protein inversin cause nephronophthisis type II, an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease characterized by extensive renal cysts, situs inversus and renal failure. Here we report that inversin acts as a molecular switch between different Wnt signaling cascades. Inversin inhibits the canonical Wnt pathway by targeting cytoplasmic dishevelled (Dsh or Dvl1) for degradation; concomitantly, it is required for convergent extension movements in gastrulating Xenopus laevis embryos and elongation of animal cap explants, both regulated by noncanonical Wnt signaling. In zebrafish, the structurally related switch molecule diversin ameliorates renal cysts caused by the depletion of inversin, implying that an inhibition of canonical Wnt signaling is required for normal renal development. Fluid flow increases inversin levels in ciliated tubular epithelial cells and seems to regulate this crucial switch between Wnt signaling pathways during renal development."

The OM is a highly asymmetric bilayer composed of phospholipids, glycolipids, and proteins. Assembly of this essential organelle occurs outside the cytoplasm in an environment that lacks obvious energy sources such as ATP, and the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. We describe the identification of a multiprotein complex required for the assembly of proteins in the OM of Escherichia coli. We also demonstrate genetic interactions between genes encoding components of this protein assembly complex and imp, which encodes a protein involved in the assembly of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) in the OM. These genetic interactions suggest a role for YfgL, one of the lipoprotein components of the protein assembly complex, in a homeostatic control mechanism that coordinates the overall OM assembly process. Gram-negative bacteria have an outer membrane (OM) that functions as a barrier to protect the cell from toxic compounds such as antibiotics and detergents.

These genetic interactions suggest a role for YfgL, one of the lipoprotein components of the protein assembly complex, in a homeostatic control mechanism that coordinates the overall OM assembly process. The outer membrane (OM) is an essential organelle of Gram-negative bacteria and is an asymmetrical bilayer that functions as a selective permeability barrier (Nikaido, 2003Nikaido H. Molecular basis of bacterial outer membrane permeability revisited.Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2003; 67: 593-656Crossref PubMed Scopus (2529) Google Scholar). The outer leaflet of the OM is rich in lipopolysaccharides (LPS), while the inner leaflet consists of phospholipids (Figure 1). In addition, the OM contains two major classes of proteins, lipoproteins and β barrel proteins such as LamB. After translocation from the cytoplasm, OM lipoproteins are sorted and subsequently targeted to the periplasmic face of this membrane via the LolA/LolB pathway (Yokota et al., 1999Yokota N. Kuroda T. Matsuyama S. Tokuda H. Characterization of the LolA-LolB system as the general lipoprotein localization mechanism of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 30995-30999Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). However, the mechanisms for targeting and assembling the other OM components are largely unknown. Moreover, it has been difficult to envision the mechanics of the assembly processes since they occur in an extracytoplasmic cellular compartment (periplasm) that is devoid of any obvious energy source such as ATP. Several assembly factors involved in OM biogenesis have been recently identified, including Imp (Braun and Silhavy, 2002Braun M. Silhavy T.J. Imp/OstA is required for cell envelope biogenesis in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar) and YfgL in E. coli (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz N.

In E. coli, Imp is an essential OM β barrel protein that exists in its native state as part of a higher-order complex that is required for the proper assembly of the OM (Braun and Silhavy, 2002Braun M. Silhavy T.J. Imp/OstA is required for cell envelope biogenesis in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Cells depleted of Imp mislocalize newly synthesized lipids (LPS and phospholipids) and OM proteins (OMPs) to a novel high-density membrane fraction. Unlike E. coli, N. meningitidis does not require LPS for viability (Steeghs et al., 1998Steeghs L. den Hartog R. den Boer A. Zomer B. Roholl P. van der Ley P. Meningitis bacterium is viable without endotoxin.Nature. 1998; 392: 449-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), and imp is not essential in this organism (Bos et al., 2004Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Identification of a lipopolysaccharide transporter in the bacterial outer membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Exploiting this fact, Bos et al., 2004Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Identification of a lipopolysaccharide transporter in the bacterial outer membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar have recently demonstrated that Imp is required for LPS assembly in the OM in this organism. The imp4213 allele of E. coli encodes a mutant Imp protein that confers OM permeability defects, resulting in sensitivity to bile salts and many antibiotics including vancomycin and its glycolipid derivative chlorobiphenyl vancomycin (CBPV) (Sampson et al., 1989Sampson B.A. Misra R.

As described in the linked paper in this issue of Cell (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz N. Falcone B.V. Kahne D. Silhavy T.J. Chemical conditionality: a genetic strategy to probe organelle assembly.Cell. 2005; 121 (this issue): 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), we discovered that null mutations in yfgL, a gene encoding a putative OM lipoprotein, specifically correct a subset of the permeability phenotypes conferred by the imp4213 allele. Although the imp4213 allele does not alter the steady-state levels of OMPs, strains carrying null mutations in yfgL have lower levels of OMPs such as OmpA and LamB, thereby implicating YfgL in membrane biogenesis (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz N.

Chemical conditionality: a genetic strategy to probe organelle assembly.Cell. 2005; 121 (this issue): 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Here we show that YfgL exists in a heterooligomeric complex with at least three other proteins of previously unknown function: YaeT, YfiO, and NlpB. Although no reports specifically link YfiO, NlpB, or their homologs to OM assembly, a homolog of YaeT, designated Omp85, has been shown to be essential and required for OM biogenesis in Neisseria meningitidis (Voulhoux et al., 2003Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Role of a highly conserved bacterial protein in outer membrane protein assembly.Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar, Genevrois et al., 2003Genevrois S. Steeghs L.

The Omp85 protein of Neisseria meningitidis is required for lipid export to the outer membrane.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1780-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). However, the role of Omp85 in Neisseria is contested, with one report by Genevrois et al., 2003Genevrois S. Steeghs L. Roholl P. Letesson J.-J. van der Ley P. The Omp85 protein of Neisseria meningitidis is required for lipid export to the outer membrane.EMBO J. 2003; 22: 1780-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar arguing that Omp85 serves to incorporate LPS and phospholipids into the OM, while another report by Voulhoux et al., 2003Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Role of a highly conserved bacterial protein in outer membrane protein assembly.Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar contends that Omp85 is responsible for OM protein assembly. The latter conclusion is further supported by the evidence that mitochondria and chloroplasts also contain Omp85 homologs, Tob55 and Toc75, respectively, that exist in complexes that have been shown to be required for the insertion of β barrel proteins into the OMs of these cellular organelles (Paschen et al., 2003Paschen S.A. Waizenegger T. Stan T. Preuss M. Cyrklaff M. Hell K. Rapaport D. Neupert W.

Lithgow T. The Omp85 family of proteins is essential for outer membrane biogenesis in mitochondria and bacteria.J. Cell Biol. 2004; 164: 19-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). If YaeT were required for targeting either lipids or OMPs to the OM in E. coli, logic would then predict that yaeT would be an essential gene, since both components are required to assemble the OM and this structure is essential in E. coli. However, conflicting reports have appeared regarding the essential nature of the yaeT gene in this organism (Gerdes et al., 2003Gerdes S.Y. et al.Experimental determination and system level analysis of essential genes in Escherichia coli MG1655.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5673-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar, Dartigalongue et al., 2001Dartigalongue C. Missiakas D. Raina S. Characterization of the Escherichia coli σE regulon.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20866-20875Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Historically, attempts to identify factors involved in the OM biogenesis in E. coli have been met with limited success due in part to the difficulty in designing appropriate genetic selections or screens. Furthermore, it has been difficult to interpret the phenotypes resulting from defects in OMP and LPS assembly, since the optimal translocation of LPS and OMPs appears to share some degree of codependency (Braun and Silhavy, 2002Braun M. Silhavy T.J. Imp/OstA is required for cell envelope biogenesis in Escherichia coli.Mol. Microbiol. 2002; 45: 1289-1302Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). For example, various stages of OMP folding are enhanced in the presence of phospholipids (Kloser et al., 1998Kloser A. Laird M. Deng M. Misra R. Modulations in lipid A and phospholipid biosynthesis pathways influence outer membrane protein assembly in Escherichia coli K-12.Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 27: 1003-1008Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and LPS (Pages et al., 1990Pages J.M. Bolla J.M. Bernadac A. Fourel D. Immunological approach of assembly and topology of OmpF, an outer membrane protein of Escherichia coli.Biochimie. 1990; 72: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, Ried et al., 1990Ried G.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 6048-6053Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), while the translocation of LPS to the OM likely requires at least one OMP component based on results obtained with Neisseria (Bos et al., 2004Bos M.P. Tefsen B. Geurtsen J. Tommassen J. Identification of a lipopolysaccharide transporter in the bacterial outer membrane.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA. 2004; 101: 9417-9422Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). This work describes additional factors responsible for OM assembly in E. coli. We propose based on genetic interactions between yfgL and imp reported in the accompanying paper (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz N. Falcone B.V. Kahne D. Silhavy T.J. Chemical conditionality: a genetic strategy to probe organelle assembly.Cell. 2005; 121 (this issue): 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), as well as genetic interactions described here, that the activities of all of these OM assembly factors function in distinct capacities but are inextricably linked to ensure the coordinated assembly of both LPS and OMPs. We have proposed a role for YfgL in OM biogenesis (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz N. Falcone B.V. Kahne D. Silhavy T.J. Chemical conditionality: a genetic strategy to probe organelle assembly.Cell. 2005; 121 (this issue): 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar), but sequence analysis makes no functional predictions. It does, however, predict that YfgL is an OM lipoprotein. To test whether YfgL undergoes the covalent posttranslational modification typical of lipoproteins, wild-type E. coli and a strain overproducing a functional (data not shown) His-tagged YfgL were grown in the presence of radiolabeled palmitate. As shown in Figure 2A , a labeled protein of 40 kDa was detected in the autoradiogram and shown to be His-tagged YfgL by Western blotting with both anti-YfgL and anti-His-tag antibodies (Figures 2B and 2C, respectively). Radiolabeled YfgL was not detected in samples from the wild-type strain, although Western blot analysis using the anti-YfgL antibody (Figure 2B) confirmed the presence of this protein. The expression levels of yfgL in the wild-type strain are apparently too low for detection by this labeling method. These results support the prediction that YfgL is a lipoprotein. Lipoproteins are secreted into the periplasm, where they are anchored to either the inner or outer membrane. The “+2 rule” for lipoprotein sorting can often predict to which membrane a given lipoprotein will anchor (Yamaguchi et al., 1988Yamaguchi K. Yu F. Inouye M. A single amino acid determinant of the membrane localization of lipoproteins in E. coli.Cell. 1988; 53: 423-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar, Gennity and Inouye, 1991Gennity J.M. Inouye M. The protein sequence responsible for lipoprotein membrane localization in Escherichia coli exhibits remarkable specificity.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16458-16464Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The amino acid in the +2 position of YfgL is serine, suggesting YfgL is directed to the periplasmic face of the OM. To test this, we fractionated the inner and outer membranes of wild-type E. coli using sedimentation equilibrium. Western blot analyses using an antibody specific for YfgL, as well as antibodies specific for inner (55 KDa) and outer (Imp) membrane proteins, revealed that YfgL cofractionates with OMPs as predicted (Figures 2D and 2E). Thus, YfgL is an OM lipoprotein. The amino-terminal lipid moiety of YfgL likely embeds the protein in the bilayer with the bulk of the protein remaining in the periplasm. The genetic interactions we have described between yfgL and imp4213 in the preceding paper (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz N. Falcone B.V. Kahne D. Silhavy T.J. Chemical conditionality: a genetic strategy to probe organelle assembly.Cell. 2005; 121 (this issue): 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) prompted biochemical studies to determine if these two proteins interact directly. For this purpose, we used a plasmid that produces a carboxy-terminal His-tagged YfgL. Under the conditions employed in our experiments, the levels of His-tagged YfgL produced from this plasmid owing to leaky expression from the T7 promoter are similar to the levels of YfgL produced from the chromosomal gene. To identify proteins interacting with YfgL, we performed coimmunoprecipitation experiments using a monoclonal anti-His-tag antibody. As shown in Figure 3A , lane 2, this antibody precipitated a protein of 40 KDa, which we identified as YfgL by Western blot using both anti-YfgL and anti-His-tag antibodies (data not shown). In addition, three coprecipitating proteins of approximate molecular masses of 90, 35, and 25 KDa were detected in silver-stained SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A, lane 2). The specificity of the coprecipitation is demonstrated by the fact that neither YfgL nor any of the three proteins are precipitated from a strain that does not produce His-tagged YfgL (Figure 3A, lane 1). To our surprise, the 90 KDa protein was not Imp, as confirmed by Western blot with anti-Imp antibody. To determine the identity of this protein, the first ten amino acids were determined by Edman degradation. This sequence of amino acids obtained is an exact match to a sequence found in the E. coli protein YaeT. In YaeT, this sequence is located immediately downstream of a putative 20 amino acid signal sequence. Signal sequence processing would leave this ten amino acid sequence at the amino terminus of mature YaeT. Several attempts to sequence the 35 and 25 KDa proteins by Edman degradation failed. This suggested that the amino terminus of these proteins might be blocked or modified. These two proteins were then submitted for sequence analysis by mass spectroscopy. The results showed that the 35 KDa protein is NlpB and the 25 KDa protein is YfiO. NlpB is an OM lipoprotein of unknown function (Bouvier et al., 1991Bouvier J. Pugsley A.P. Stragier P. A gene for a new lipoprotein in the dapA-purC interval of the Escherichia coli chromosome.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5523-5531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The amino-terminal amino acid sequence of YfiO contains a predicted signal sequence and a lipobox. The +2 rule predicts that YfiO is an OM lipoprotein. YfiO has significant sequence homology with ComL, a peptidoglycan-linked OM lipoprotein in Neisseria gonorrhoeae (37% sequence identity), which was shown to be involved in transformation competence (Fussenegger et al., 1996Fussenegger M. Facius D. Meier J. Meyer T.F. A novel peptidoglycan-linked lipoprotein (ComL) that functions in natural transformation competence of Neisseria gonorrhoeae.Mol. Microbiol. 1996; 19: 1095-1105Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The fact that both of these proteins are lipoproteins explains why Edman degradation failed. In order to confirm the interaction between YfgL, YaeT, YfiO, and NlpB, we constructed plasmids that express carboxy-terminal His-tagged versions of YaeT, YfiO, and NlpB. In strains producing His-tagged YaeT, immunoprecipitation using the monoclonal anti-His-tag antibody coprecipitated YfgL, as verified by Western blot using anti-YfgL antibody (data not shown). We currently do not have antibody directed against YfiO or NlpB, so we could not confirm the presence of these proteins in the complex. However, when immunoprecipitation was performed in strains producing either the His-tagged YfiO or the His-tagged NlpB, both YfgL and YaeT were coprecipitated as verified by Western blot using the anti-YaeT and anti-YfgL antibodies (Figure 3B). Thus, we conclude YaeT, YfgL, YfiO, and NlpB are all present in a large protein complex. Our initial attempts to delete the yaeT gene in E. coli using standard genetic techniques were unsuccessful, prompting us to develop a strain in which YaeT could be depleted (Figure 4A ). This depletion strain contains a large, internal, nonpolar deletion of the chromosomal gene, and it carries a wild-type yaeT gene under the control of the araBAD promoter at the λ attachment site (Experimental Procedures). The resulting yaeT depletion strain (JCM166) could only form colonies on solid medium when supplemented with arabinose. We monitored growth of JCM166 in liquid culture in the absence or presence of arabinose by monitoring optical density (OD600) over time. In rich medium containing arabinose, JCM166 grew at rates comparable to wild-type (Figure 4B). In the absence of inducer, the strain grew at near normal rates for three or four generations, and then growth slowed to a stop (Figure 4B). As YaeT was depleted, cell death occurred as measured by colony forming units/ml (data not shown). Therefore, YaeT is essential in E. coli as predicted by Gerdes et al., 2003Gerdes S.Y. et al.Experimental determination and system level analysis of essential genes in Escherichia coli MG1655.J. Bacteriol. 2003; 185: 5673-5684Crossref PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar. As shown above, YfiO and NlpB form a complex with YfgL and YaeT. YaeT is essential and so is YfiO (Onufryk et al., 2005Onufryk C. Crouch M.-L. Fang F.C. Gross C.A. A characterization of six lipoproteins in the sigma E regulon.J. Bacteriol. 2005; PubMed Google Scholar), but YfgL and NlpB are not (Eggert et al., 2001Eggert U.S. Ruiz N. Falcone B.V. Branstrom A.A. Goldman R.C. Silhavy T.J. Kahne D.

Pugsley A.P. Stragier P. A gene for a new lipoprotein in the dapA-purC interval of the Escherichia coli chromosome.J. Bacteriol. 1991; 173: 5523-5531Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transposon insertions in both nlpB and yfiO were obtained from the E. coli Genome Project at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The insertion in nlpB, nlpB::kan, interrupts the gene at codon 41 (out of 346) and thus is likely a null mutation. The insertion in yfiO, yfiO::kan, interrupts the gene at codon 227 (out of 246). This mutation is not a null mutation, since strains carrying this mutation are viable. However, the YaeT complex purified from strains carrying yfiO::kan lacks detectable amounts of YfiO, and the phenotypes conferred by this mutation are recessive (data not shown). Therefore, we conclude that yfiO::kan greatly reduces but does not abolish YfiO function. If the three lipoproteins are present in a complex, we would expect that mutations that reduce or abolish any of them would confer similar phenotypes. We reported previously that yfgL null mutations alter the OM permeability barrier. This is evidenced by the increased antibiotic sensitivity exhibited by strains lacking only YfgL (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz N. Falcone B.V. Kahne D. Silhavy T.J. Chemical conditionality: a genetic strategy to probe organelle assembly.Cell. 2005; 121 (this issue): 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). We found that yfiO::kan strains exhibited phenotypes similar to the yfgL mutants. In contrast, strains lacking only NlpB showed only slight defects in OM permeability. These results support our conclusions that all three lipoproteins are functionally related and that YfgL and YfiO are more important for function than NlpB. Alterations in OM permeability are a crude test of function; any mutation that alters the synthesis or assembly of any of the OM components can cause permeability defects. A more precise test of the functional relationship between members of an essential multicomponent complex would employ double mutants, the logic of which is outlined below. The three lipoproteins are components of the essential YaeT complex. As noted above, strains carrying either the yfgL::kan, the nlpB::kan or the yfiO::kan mutations are viable. However, if the association of these lipoproteins with YaeT and each other is functionally significant, then pairwise combinations of these mutations may impair function enough to cause detectable changes in cell growth. Such synthetic relationships between mutations in genes whose products form multiprotein complexes have been observed in yeast (e.g., Kaiser and Schekman, 1990Kaiser C.A. Schekman R. Distinct sets of SEC genes govern transport vesicle formation and fusion early in the secretory pathway.Cell. 1990; 61: 723-733Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (523) Google Scholar, Scidmore et al., 1993Scidmore M.A. Okamura H.H. Rose M.D. Genetic interactions between KAR2 and SEC63, encoding eukaryotic homologues of DnaK and DnaJ in the endoplasmic reticulum.Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1145-1159Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). To test for synthetic phenotypes, we attempted to construct pairwise combinations of lipoprotein double mutants by introducing either the yfiO::kan or the nlpB::kan allele into a strain carrying yfgL8 by P1 transduction selecting for resistance to kanamycin on rich media at 37°C. Recall that yfgL8 is a loss-of-function yfgL allele (Ruiz et al., 2005Ruiz N. Falcone B.V. Kahne D. Silhavy T.J. Chemical conditionality: a genetic strategy to probe organelle assembly.Cell. 2005; 121 (this issue): 307-317Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Although the yfiO::kan allele could be easily introduced into the wild-type strain MC4100, we could not introduce the yfiO::kan allele into MC4100 strains carrying yfgL8. This synthetic lethality was further demonstrated by the fact that linkage between yfiO::kan and the nearby marker nadB::Tn10 was disrupted if the recipient strain carried yfgL8. When we used a strain carrying yfiO::kan and nadB::Tn10 as the donor in a cross with the wild-type strain MC4100 and selected for tetracycline-resistant transductants, 29 out of 110 transductants (i.e., 26%) also inherited the yfiO::kan allele. However, with an isogenic recipient carrying the yfgL8 allele, none of the transductants (0/200) inherited the yfiO::kan allele. These results confirm that yfiO::kan and yfgL8 are a synthetic lethal pair. It is important to note that the synthetic lethality exhibited by the yfiO::kan and yfgL8 double mutants is conditional. Transductants that inherit both mutations can be obtained if they are selected at 30°C in minimal media. These transductants do not grow on any media at 37°C. On rich media at 30°C, they grow very poorly. We interpret this to mean that defects in these two lipoproteins can be tolerated only under conditions in which cell growth is slowed substantially. In contrast, the nlpB::kan allele could be introduced into strains carrying yfgL8 at the same frequency as into wild-type following selection for kanamycin resistance at 37°C. However, the nlpB::kan yfgL8 double mutants exhibited irregular and heterogeneous colony morphology. Thus, although a strain carrying this pair of alleles is viable, it does not behave like either single mutant or wild-type. Despite the fact that this synthetic phenotype is modest, we think it significant because it parallels the permeability phenotypes (see above) and OM defects (see below) exhibited by the mutants defective in each lipoprotein individually; mutations in yfgL or yfiO confer stronger phenotypes than nlpB mutations. The synthetic phenotypes exhibited by pairwise combinations of mutations in the genes encoding the lipoproteins provide genetic evidence supporting the existence and functionality of the YaeT/YfgL/YfiO/NlpB complex. Based on the severity of the synthetic phenotypes, we further conclude that YfgL and YfiO are more important for complex function than NlpB. To determine whether or not YaeT affects OMP assembly in E. coli, we monitored the folding and targeting of two OMPs, OmpA and LamB. The periplasmic maltose binding protein (MalE) was used as an internal control. Both OmpA and LamB assume folded structures when targeted to the OM that are stable during SDS PAGE analysis. Samples containing the proteins must be heated to disrupt these structures. Folded OmpA is a monomer that runs faster than the fully denatured protein (Schweizer et al., 1978Schweizer M. Hindennach I. Garten W. Henning U. Major proteins of the Escherichia coli outer cell envelope membrane. Interaction of protein II with lipopolysaccharide.Eur. J. Biochem. 1978; 82: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Folded LamB is trimeric and runs slower than the denatured monomer. LamB trimers often migrate as a ladder owing to the association of LPS molecules (Misra et al., 1991Misra R. Peterson A. Ferenci T. Silhavy T.J. A genetic approach for analyzing the pathway of LamB assembly into the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13592-13597Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mistargeting should result in decreased levels of folded OmpA and LamB and increased levels of the unfolded proteins in unheated samples (Voulhoux et al., 2003Voulhoux R. Bos M.P. Geurtsen J. Mols M. Tommassen J. Role of a highly conserved bacterial protein in outer membrane protein assembly.Science. 2003; 299: 262-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar). The unfolded forms of both proteins would be susceptible to degradation by periplasmic proteases. As shown in Figure 4C, OmpA was present in the folded conformation in our wild-type strain (JCM158) throughout its growth cycle. As expected, OmpA also folded normally in our YaeT depletion strain in the presence of arabinose, which maintains YaeT production (Figure 4C). However, after 4 hr of growth in the absence of arabinose, at a time when YaeT depletion started to impair growth (F"

Azithromycin binds almost identically to both G2099A and wild-type subunits, but the erythromycin affinity increases by more than 10(4)-fold, implying that desolvation of the N2 of G2099 accounts for the low wild-type affinity for macrolides. All macrolides bind similarly to the H. marismortui subunit, but their binding differs significantly from what has been reported in the D. radioidurans subunit. The synergy in the binding of streptogramins A and B appears to result from a reorientation of the base of A2103 (A2062, E. coli) that stacks between them. The structure of large subunit containing a three residue deletion mutant of L22 shows a change in the L22 structure and exit tunnel shape that illuminates its macrolide resistance phenotype."

Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae causes common diseases including pneumonia, meningitis, and otitis media; affects several million people per year in the United States; and is a significant killer of infants in developing countries. Pneumolysin (PLY) is a major virulence factor of S. pneumoniae (Berry et al., 1989Berry A.M. Yother J. Briles D.E. Hansman D. Paton J.C. Reduced virulence of a defined pneumolysin-negative mutant of Streptococcus pneumoniae.Infect. Immun. 1989; 57: 2037-2042Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and is a strong candidate for a vaccine, as it has been well characterized as a protective immunogen and varies little with serotype. Despite the considerable biomedical interest and effort in studying this family of toxins, there is little direct structural information on how pneumolysin transforms from a soluble 52 kDa monomer into a 30–50 subunit oligomeric pore inserted into target cell membranes. PLY is a member of the cholesterol-dependent cytolysin (CDC) family (Alouf, 2000Alouf J.E. Cholesterol-binding cytolytic protein toxins.Int. J. Med. Microbiol. 2000; 290: 351-356Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar, Palmer, 2001Palmer M.

Life Sci. 2002; 59: 832-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), a large group of proteins that attack cholesterol-containing membranes, forming ring-shaped pores that mediate cell death. A second biological activity contributing to the virulence of PLY is the activation of the complement pathway (Paton et al., 1984Paton J.C. Rowan-Kelly B. Ferrante A. Activation of human complement by the pneumococcal toxin pneumolysin.Infect. Immun. 1984; 43: 1085-1087Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, Mitchell et al., 1991Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Saunders F.K.

Amino acid changes affecting the activity of pneumolysin alter the behaviour of pneumococci in pneumonia.Microb. Pathog. 1998; 24: 164-174Crossref Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Two mechanisms have been proposed for pore formation by the CDC family. Studies of streptolysin O led to the proposal that monomers bind to the membrane and insert before oligomerization takes place in the membrane to form the pore (Palmer et al., 1998Palmer M. Harris R. Freytag C. Kehoe M. Tranum-Jensen J. Bhakdi S. Assembly mechanism of the oligomeric streptolysin O pore: the early membrane lesion is lined by a free edge of the lipid membrane and is extended gradually during oligomerization.EMBO J. 1998; 17: 1598-1605Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). In contrast, studies with perfringolysin O (PFO) suggest that monomers bind to the membrane and oligomerize on the surface to form a prepore ring before the entire oligomer inserts to form the pore (Shepard et al., 2000Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K.

Assembly and topography of the prepore complex in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31218-31225Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). More recently it was demonstrated that streptolysin O also could form a prepore state (Heuck et al., 2003Heuck A.P. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Assembly and topography of the prepore complex in cholesterol-dependent cytolysins.J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 31218-31225Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), providing support for the idea that members of this family share a common mechanism of pore formation. The 2.7 Å crystal structure of monomeric, soluble PFO (Rossjohn et al., 1997Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Structure of a cholesterol-binding, thiol-activated cytolysin and a model of its membrane form.Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) provides a model for all members of the CDC family, which share biochemical activities and exhibit high sequence homology. Since PLY and PFO have 46% sequence identity and 67% similarity, the structure of PFO provides an accurate model for the monomeric form of PLY. PFO has a flat, elongated shape, with four domains consisting of mainly β sheet structure, and a hydrophilic surface. Domains 1, 2, and 4 are arranged linearly, with domain 3 packed loosely against the side of domain 2. Domain 4 contains a conserved tryptophan-rich motif that is thought to interact with cholesterol and is essential for cytolytic activity (Sekino-Suzuki et al., 1996Sekino-Suzuki N. Nakamura M. Mitsui K.I. Ohno-Iwashita Y. Contribution of individual tryptophan residues to the structure and activity of theta-toxin (perfringolysin O), a cholesterol-binding cytolysin.Eur. J.

J. 1998; 329: 571-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The central β sheet of domain 3 is flanked by two groups of α helices that have been predicted to refold into β hairpins and insert into a lipid environment on the basis of spectroscopic experiments with labeled cysteine mutants (Shepard et al., 1998Shepard L.A.

The resulting pore would be lined by a large transmembrane β barrel, with four strands donated by each CDC monomer. In an earlier cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) study, we characterized two oligomeric forms of PLY: a helical form in solution and a membrane-surface bound form (Gilbert et al., 1999Gilbert R.J.C. Jimenez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I.J. Rossjohn J. Parker M. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Two structural transitions in membrane pore formation by pneumolysin, the pore-forming toxin of Streptococcus pneumoniae.Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Rings and helical assemblies form spontaneously in concentrated solutions of the protein. A three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of the helical form revealed the orientation of the monomers in the oligomer and showed a large rotation of domain 4, accompanied by the release and disordering of domain 3 from its docked position against domain 2, resulting in a bent subunit conformation. In the presence of cholesterol-rich liposomes, PLY formed oligomeric rings bound to the membrane surface. A 3D reconstruction of this membrane-surface bound form showed the monomers in an extended conformation, with only the bottom of domain 4 contacting the membrane. The bilayer was continuous under the rings. This membrane-surface bound oligomer was subsequently identified as the prepore form (Gilbert, 2002Gilbert R.J.C. Pore-forming toxins.Cell. Mol. Life Sci. 2002; 59: 832-844Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Here we present a greatly improved structure of the prepore form and a 3D structure of the fully inserted pore form of pneumolysin, determined by cryo-EM and image processing. The transition from the prepore to the pore form involves exceptionally large conformational changes, with the initially extended molecule doubling over into a bent conformation, extruding parts of domain 3, and deforming the membrane to form a gigantic β barrel piercing the bilayer. Adding PLY to cholesterol-rich liposomes on ice and incubating briefly at 37°C yields a mixture of liposomes with membrane bound oligomers associated with either continuous or discontinuous bilayers, naked liposomes, and free PLY rings not associated with membrane. A cryo-EM image of the preparation is shown in Figure 1A . Two different membrane bound forms are distinguishable in tangential views through the edges of the spherical liposomes. A surface bound form with an intact bilayer (previously described in Gilbert et al., 1999Gilbert R.J.C. Jimenez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I.J. Rossjohn J. Parker M. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Two structural transitions in membrane pore formation by pneumolysin, the pore-forming toxin of Streptococcus pneumoniae.Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) can be identified as the prepore form (Figure 1A, inset, single lines), and a short, neck-like structure surrounding a hole in the bilayer is clearly the pore form (Figure 1A, open rectangle). Around 900 side views of both membrane bound forms, along with some end views, were extracted from the same set of 135 micrographs. When the 37°C incubation was maintained for 5–10 min, the protein bound liposomes appeared to disintegrate or aggregate (data not shown). If the sample is incubated at room temperature, stable liposomes are observed with only prepore rings (Gilbert et al., 1999Gilbert R.J.C. Jimenez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I.J. Rossjohn J. Parker M.

Two structural transitions in membrane pore formation by pneumolysin, the pore-forming toxin of Streptococcus pneumoniae.Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar), in agreement with previous findings (Shepard et al., 2000Shepard L.A. Shatursky O. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K. The mechanism of pore assembly for a cholesterol-dependent cytolysin: formation of a large prepore complex precedes the insertion of the transmembrane β-hairpins.Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 10284-10293Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, Heuck et al., 2003Heuck A.P.

The protein distribution on liposomes is not homogeneous. Liposomes heavily decorated with prepores and pores often lie adjacent to naked ones. This may be due to differences in physical properties such as membrane surface tension or to cooperative changes in the protein-liposome complexes. There was a wide range of liposome diameters, but no correlation between membrane curvature and protein binding was observed. Side-view images of the prepore rings show two characteristic spikes defining the edges of the oligomers (Gilbert et al., 1999Gilbert R.J.C. Jimenez J.L. Chen S. Tickle I.J. Rossjohn J. Parker M. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Two structural transitions in membrane pore formation by pneumolysin, the pore-forming toxin of Streptococcus pneumoniae.Cell. 1999; 97: 647-655Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar; Figure 1B). Images of these rings were extracted from the micrographs, aligned, and sorted into classes according to their features. Averaging the images within classes substantially improves the signal-to-noise ratio and structural detail (Figure 1C). The bilayer is unbroken beneath the prepore, but protein density penetrates into the upper leaflet. The symmetry of the prepore was estimated by comparing the ring diameter to that of end views for which the subunit number could be determined by rotational symmetry analysis. An initial 3D reconstruction was generated by applying the estimated symmetry to the side-view class average that contained the most data with the least variance. Refinement of the alignment and classification revealed that the rings have a range of tilts within 20° of the exact side view. Because of the high symmetry and side-view orientations, the data set provides a complete tomographic series around the symmetry axis. The range of diameters was limited (265–300 Å), unlike that of the free PLY rings originally characterized (Morgan et al., 1995Morgan P.J. Hyman S.C. Rowe A.J. Mitchell T.J. Andrew P.W. Saibil H.R. Subunit organisation and symmetry of pore-forming, oligomeric pneumolysin.FEBS Lett. 1995; 371: 77-80Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The final 3D map was determined from 32 class averages and has a resolution of 28 Å at 0.5 Fourier shell correlation. The symmetry was determined to be 31 ± 3 on the basis of sharpness (contrast) of map features and the spacing consistent with the average width of the subunit. Symmetries from 27 upwards all produced very similar density sections along the side view of the subunit (Figure S1). Reprojections of the 3D reconstruction are in good agreement with the class averages at the same orientations (compare Figure 1C with Figure 1D), confirming the consistency of the 3D map with the image data. The pores are clearly recognizable since they form large holes in the membrane and are accompanied by dramatic changes in the protein shape and in its relationship to the membrane (Figure 1E). Even on the raw images it is evident that the bilayer is broken and the angle between the membrane bilayer and the plane of the ring is larger. (It should be noted that surrounding areas of membrane contribute to these side-view projections.) The pore images were processed in the same way as the prepores, but the pores vary more in diameter (320–430 Å). Isolated pore views were less abundant in the images because aggregation of the pore-containing liposomes caused them to be obscured by overlapping structures. The images were mainly distributed in two size groups corresponding to 38-mer and 44-mer forms. In both cases the class averages confirm that the protein density protrudes less from the membrane surface (Figures 1F and 1H). Three-dimensional reconstructions were calculated for the two pore diameters observed. The symmetries were estimated in the same way as for the prepore form, with an uncertainty of ±3 subunits. Class averages used to generate the 3D reconstructions are shown in Figures 1F and 1H along with reprojections of the corresponding 3D reconstructions (Figures 1G and 1I). The resolution is 29 Å for the 38-mer and 31 Å for the 44-mer at 0.5 Fourier shell correlation. The full prepore and pore density maps are shown with surface rendering (Figures 2A and 2B ). Central density cross-sections through the prepore and pore maps are contoured in Figures 2C and 2D. The outer surface of the pore has a radially protruding ridge (*, Figure 2D) that is absent in the prepore, and a thin wall of density lines the pore (bracket, Figure 2D). The end projections of the two forms are quite distinct (Figures 2E and 2F) and allow the two conformations to be distinguished in end views. In order to check the reliability of the pore structure, small wedges of density corresponding to three adjacent subunits were extracted from the 38- and 44-mer maps. These were aligned and their weighted average was calculated. The features are clearer in the averaged map, showing that the asymmetric unit is consistent between the 38- and 44-mer structures. Comparison of the two maps by Fourier shell correlation showed that they are consistent to a resolution better than 28 Å (0.5 correlation). Contoured densities of the side view and three transverse sections are shown for the prepore and averaged pore maps in Figure 3, showing the large rearrangement of domains upon pore formation. To model the prepore state, the crystal structure of PFO (Rossjohn et al., 1997Rossjohn J. Feil S.C. McKinstry W.J. Tweten R.K. Parker M.W. Structure of a cholesterol-binding, thiol-activated cytolysin and a model of its membrane form.Cell. 1997; 89: 685-692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar) was fitted into the PLY cryo-EM map as two rigid bodies (domains 1–3 and domain 4) that are connected at a single hinge point. The 31-fold symmetry chosen on the basis of map quality resulted in close contacts between adjacent subunits without major clashes. The shape of PFO domains 1, 2, and 3 (Figure 4A ; blue, green, and red, respectively) is easily recognized in the prepore density and can be readily fitted. A pocket in the density corresponds to the hole in the structure between domains 2 and 3. Domain 4 (yellow, PFO residues 391–500) is shifted up and to the left by ∼15 Å relative to its position in the monomer crystal structure in Figure 4A (arrow) and is twisted about its long axis to fit into the narrow stem of density. The shift of domain 4 relative to domain 2 shows that there must be significant distortion of their interface in the prepore oligomer. The topology of the central β sheet (red) and short flanking helices (orange) in domain 3 is shown on the right of Figure 4A. The prepore density clearly accommodates the helical regions. The group of helices on the inside of the ring (on the right of the section in Figure 4A) fits neatly into a bulge in the density.

(D) View of three subunits from the outside of the pore, with the map rendered as a semitransparent surface. Examination of the oligomeric packing reveals some minor clashes in intersubunit packing in domains 1 and 3 (PFO residues 135–140 with 156–160 and 354–356 in domain 1; 326–332 with 178–182 and 225–227 in domain 3). Because of these clashes, the loop containing residues 134–142 in domain 1 was omitted from the final fit. The view of three adjacent subunits from outside the ring reveals that domains 1–3 pack well into the density but that there is some sideways tilt of domain 4 relative to its orientation in the crystal structure (Figure 4B, arrow). The tip of domain 4, including the conserved tryptophan-rich loop, clearly penetrates the upper leaflet of the intact lipid bilayer, as observed in our earlier study (Gilbert et al., 1999Gilbert R.J.C.

The structure of the prepore is similar to that in our earlier study but is much better defined in the present work. A dramatic conformational change is obvious in the images of the pores (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4). Domains 2 and 3 are massively restructured and cannot be fitted as rigid bodies from the PFO monomer crystal structure. Domains 1 and 4 are still recognizable, but the entire molecule is doubled over into an arch, with a thin sheet of density forming a wall around the edge of the pore. In order to approximate a fit to the pore structure, the PFO crystal structure was separated into six rigid bodies as described below, and these were fitted separately into the density. Domain 1 (blue, PFO numbering 91–172, 231–272, 354–373) was fitted intact except for 23 N-terminal residues that protruded from the density (Figure 4C). The extent of domain 2 is defined by its connections to domains 1 and 4. Their separation decreases by 30 Å in the vertical direction so that domain 2 is buckled in the pore structure (Figure 3). To allow for the sharp bend, domain 2 (green) was split into two parts (upper, 53–62, 83–90, 374–381; lower, 63–82, 382–390) at a region of high temperature factors in the crystal structure (59–62). The two halves of domain 2 were stacked into the upper part of the ridge of density projecting outwards from the ring. Domain 3 (red, 177–186, 221–230, 273–283, 316–353) was fitted without the regions that are predicted to form transmembrane structures (Shepard et al., 1998Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D.

In accordance with recent data on edge-strand contacts in PFO oligomers (Ramachandran et al., 2004Ramachandran R. Tweten R.K. Johnson A.E. Membrane-dependent conformational changes initiate cholesterol-dependent cytolysin oligomerization and intersubunit β-strand alignment.Nat. Struct. Mol. Biol. 2004; 11: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar), domain 3 was twisted slightly to allow the formation of a continuous β sheet around the ring. Domain 4 (yellow, 391–500) was fitted intact into the density connecting to the membrane surface. The view from outside of the ring shows that the subunits pack consistently into the density (Figure 4D). As in the prepore, the oligomeric contacts are made by domains 1 and 3, and the packing between adjacent subunits is looser at the level of domains 2 and 4. The same loops in domains 1 and 3 give minor clashes in subunit packing, as in the prepore. The symmetry estimates of 38 for the smaller pore (Figure 2G) and 44 for the larger one (Figure 2I) gave reasonable packing contacts. Within the subunit there are some minor clashes involving domains 2 and 3. Since there is significant refolding in these regions, rigid-body fitting can only give an approximate description of their conformations. The wall of density lining the pore (Figure 2D, bracket) is consistent with the prediction that the helical regions of domain 3 refold into β hairpins that penetrate into the membrane (Shepard et al., 1998Shepard L.A. Heuck A.P. Hamman B.D. Rossjohn J. Parker M.W. Ryan K.R. Johnson A.E. Tweten R.K.

Since there is no β barrel in the Protein Data Bank large enough to provide model hairpins for this pore structure, four straight β strands were used to model two idealized β hairpins as the pore lining. These provided the final rigid body for fitting (orange, 187–220 and 284–315, Figure 4C). The hairpin topology is shown to the right of Figure 4C. If the strands are fully extended and run almost vertically, the hairpins are long enough to traverse the membrane. The oligomeric packing of the β hairpins is compatible with the formation of a continuous β barrel lining the pore (Figure 5A ). In the 38-mer this would contain 152 β strands; the 44-mer would contain 176. In the case of the 38-mer, the barrel circumference with 152 vertical strands spaced at 4.8 Å would be 729 Å, in agreement with the observed pore circumference of ∼730–790 Å. Even with the larger figure, the additional circumference per subunit only allows the hairpins to incline around 2° from the barrel axis. (A) View of six fitted subunits showing the pore lining. (B) Overlay of prepore and pore structures, with the domains colored as in Figure 4A.

Green arrow, direction of movement from the extended to the bent conformation. Another remarkable feature of the pore structure is the deformation of the membrane bilayer. Relative to the plane of the PLY ring, the membrane interacts with the protein at a steeper angle in the pore form than in the prepore (Figures 2C and 2D). This deformation is responsible for the vase-like shape of small liposomes with a single pore (Figure 1A). A 13° rotation of the cross-s"
https://openalex.org/W2097445408,"During development of the CNS, neurons and glia are generated in a sequential manner. The mechanism underlying the later onset of gliogenesis is poorly understood, although the cytokine-induced Jak-STAT pathway has been postulated to regulate astrogliogenesis. Here, we report that the overall activity of Jak-STAT signaling is dynamically regulated in mouse cortical germinal zone during development. As such, activated STAT1/3 and STAT-mediated transcription are negligible at early, neurogenic stages, when neurogenic factors are highly expressed. At later, gliogenic periods, decreased expression of neurogenic factors causes robust elevation of STAT activity. Our data demonstrate a positive autoregulatory loop whereby STAT1/3 directly induces the expression of various components of the Jak-STAT pathway to strengthen STAT signaling and trigger astrogliogenesis. Forced activation of Jak-STAT signaling leads to precocious astrogliogenesis, and inhibition of this pathway blocks astrocyte differentiation. These observations suggest that autoregulation of the Jak-STAT pathway controls the onset of astrogliogenesis."

Alzheimer disease is characterized by abnormal protein deposits in the brain, such as amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles, formed by fibrous assemblies of the Aβ peptide (1Selkoe D.J. Schenk D. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2003; 43: 545-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (737) Google Scholar) or of the microtubule (MT) 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; PHF, paired helical filament; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation. 1The abbreviations used are: MT, microtubule; PHF, paired helical filament; MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; HSQC, heteronuclear single quantum correlation.-associated tau protein (2Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Trends Cell Biol. 1998; 8: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These aggregates are thought to be toxic to neurons, either by causing some toxic signaling defect or by obstructing the cell interior. Therefore, one of the top priorities in Alzheimer research is to understand the reasons for the pathological aggregation and to find methods to prevent it. Although the structural principles governing Aβ aggregation are known in some detail, little is known for the tau protein.Tau is a microtubule-associated protein that regulates MT stability, neurite outgrowth, and other MT-dependent functions. The three or four repeats in the C-terminal half of the protein and the flanking proline-rich basic domains are known to be involved in MT binding (3Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9511-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar). The affinity is regulated by phosphorylation particularly at KXGS-motifs in the repeats (4Biernat J. Gustke N. Drewes G. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Neuron. 1993; 11: 153-163Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (642) Google Scholar). Interestingly the same phosphorylation sites have an inhibitory influence on aggregation (5Schneider A. Biernat J. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E. Mandelkow E.M. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3549-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). Unbound tau can assemble into Alzheimer-like paired helical filaments (PHFs) whose polymerization can be enhanced by oxidation of SH groups and by polyanions (e.g. heparin, poly-Glu (6Barghorn S. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 14885-14896Crossref PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar)). On the other hand, tau has a hydrophilic character, is highly soluble, and belongs to the class of natively unfolded proteins with no apparent ordered secondary structure detectable by far-UV CD or Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (7Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 363AGoogle Scholar). Therefore, it is unclear why tau should aggregate in a specific manner and what structural principles could be responsible for this.Tau can aggregate as an intact protein, 352–441 residues in length (depending on isoform), so that all six tau isoforms are found in Alzheimer PHFs (9Buee L.

The isoforms differ by two inserts near the N-terminal end and the presence of either four or three imperfect repeat sequences in the C-terminal half of the protein (see Fig. 1). The region comprising the repeat sequences forms the core of PHFs (10Wischik C.M. Novak M. Thogersen H.C. Edwards P.C. Runswick M.J. Jakes R. Walker J.E. Milstein C. Roth M. Klug A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 4506-4510Crossref PubMed Scopus (770) Google Scholar) and also promotes PHF assembly in vitro (11Wille H. Drewes G. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 118: 573-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar, 12Friedhoff P. von Bergen M. Mandelkow E.M. Davies P. Mandelkow E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15712-15717Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). For PHF aggregation two hexapeptides at the beginning of the second and third repeats (275VQI-INK280 and 306VQIVYK311) are crucial. These are able to initiate the aggregation of tau into bona fide paired helical filaments with cross-β-structure and thereby represent minimal tau-tau interaction motifs (13von Bergen M. Barghorn S.

X-ray analyses exist only in the form of solution scattering (confirming the unfolded nature of the protein, (7Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) and fiber diffraction (confirming the cross-β-structure of PHFs, (13von Bergen M. Barghorn S. Li L. Marx A. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48165-48174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar)). We have now applied NMR spectroscopy as an alternative approach to structural studies. Here we report the high-resolution characterization of the repeat domain of tau, in which either all four repeats are present (K18) or repeat two has been deleted (K19), corresponding to the adult and fetal tau isoforms htau40 and htau23 (see Fig. 1). Our findings show that the repeat domain of soluble tau contains regions of residual β-structure that have the potential to serve as seeds for aggregation of tau into PHFs, and we identify residues involved in the interaction with MTs and with polyanions that promote PHF-aggregation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESExpression of Recombinant Tau Constructs and Isotope Labeling— Human tau constructs were expressed in the vector pNG2 (a derivative of pET-3a, Merck-Novagen, Darmstadt) in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) as described (Gustke et al. (3Gustke N. Trinczek B. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 9511-9522Crossref PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar)) (see Fig. 1). K18 comprises all four repeats of the largest tau isoform (residues Gln244-Glu372 plus initial Met243), K19 is similar but lacks the second repeat, corresponding to fetal tau (residues Met243 + Gln244-Lys274, Val337-Glu372, without R2 = Val275-Ser305). The expressed proteins were purified from bacterial extracts by making use of the heat stability of the protein and by FPLC SP-Sepharose chromatography (Amersham Biosciences). To label the tau proteins with 15N and 13C stable isotopes, the E. coli culture expressing K18 protein was grown in a M9 minimal medium with 15NH4Cl (1 g liter-1) and 13C glucose (4 g liter-1) (Campro Scientific), and the E. coli culture expressing K19 protein was grown on rich growth medium based on chemolithoautotrophic bacteria labeled with 13C and 15N isotopes (Silantes). Protein samples uniformly enriched in 15N were prepared by growing E. coli bacteria in minimal medium containing 1 g liter-1 of 15NH4Cl.The cell pellets were resuspended in boiling extraction buffer (50 mm MES, 500 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, pH 6.8) complemented with a protease inhibitor mixture. The cells were disrupted with a French pressure cell and subsequently boiled for 20 min. The soluble extract was isolated by centrifugation, the supernatant was dialyzed against two changes of cation exchange chromatography buffer A (20 mm MES, 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.8) and loaded on an FPLC SP-Sepharose column. The proteins were eluted by a linear gradient of cation exchange chromatography buffer B (20 mm MES, 1 m NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 6.8). NMR samples contained 0.9–1.5 mm 15N- or 15N/13C-labeled protein in 95% H2O, 5% D2O, 50 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, with 1 mm dithiothreitol.Preparation of MTs—Porcine brain tubulin was purified as described (15Mandelkow E.M. Herrmann M. Ruhl U. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 185: 311-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) and incubated at concentrations higher than 200 μm in MT assembly buffer (100 mm Pipes, pH 6.9, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm MgSO4, 1 mm dithiothreitol) in the presence of 1 mm GTP at 37 °C for 5 min. After addition of 100 μm Paclitaxel (Sigma-Aldrich) the polymerization was performed for 20 min at 37 °C.Electron Microscopy—Proteins were diluted to a concentration of ∼0.1 mg/ml, placed on 600-mesh carbon-coated copper grids for 1 min, washed with two drops of H2O, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 45 s. The specimen were examined in a Philipps 12M electron microscope at 100 kV.NMR Spectroscopy—NMR spectra were acquired at 5 °C on Bruker DRX 800, Avance 600, and DRX 600 NMR spectrometers. Aggregation did not occur under these low temperature conditions. NMR data were processed and analyzed using nmrPipe (16Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11388) Google Scholar) and Sparky 3. Three-dimensional triple-resonance experiments were collected to obtain sequence-specific assignments for the backbone of K18 and K19 (supplemental Table S1). Secondary shift values were calculated as the differences between the measured Cα/C′ chemical shifts and the empirical random coil value for the appropriate amino acid type at pH 3.0 (17Schwarzinger S. Kroon G.J.A. Foss T.R. Chung J. Wright P.E. Dyson H.J. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 2970-2978Crossref PubMed Scopus (503) Google Scholar). Random coil values for histidines, glutamates, and aspartates were taken from Wishart et al. (18Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), as the chemical shifts of these residues are particularly sensitive to pH, and the pH in the studies by Wishart et al. (18Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar) (pH 5.0) is more similar to the one used here (pH 6.9). To estimate the β-sheet propensity in contiguous segments of tau, the observed Cα secondary shifts were normalized by the empirically determined secondary shift expected for that residue type in a fully β-sheet conformation (18Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar), summed, and normalized by the number of residues in the segment.Tau-polyanion titrations were carried out with uniformly 15N-labeled protein containing 0.2 mm (heparin titration) and 0.3 mm (poly-Glu titration) K18, and 0.12 mm (heparin titration) and 0.14 mm (poly-Glu titration) K19 at pH 6.8. Heparin (average molecular weight 3000, ∼5.8 disaccharide subunits, charge/subunit ∼2.5, ∼0.31 z/Å) and poly-Glu (average molecular weight 10,000, 7–8 Glu residues, 7–8 negative net charge, in extended conformation 0.33 z/Å) were from Sigma. Complex formation was monitored by recording two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra for increasing polyanion concentrations (in mm): 0.03, 0.06, 0.15, 0.3, 0.58, 1.37, and 2.53 (K18 with heparin), 0.008, 0.015, 0.03, 0.072, 0.142, 0.28, 0.68, 1.3, 2.4, and 4.3 (K18 with poly-Glu), 0.008, 0.015, 0.03, 0.07, 0.14, 0.28, 0.67, and 1.3 (K19 with heparin), and 0.015, 0.03, 0.074, 0.146, 0.29, 0.70, 1.35, and 2.49 (K19 with poly-Glu). For tau-MT titrations NMR samples contained 0.13 and 0.14 mm uniformly 15N-labeled K18 and K19, respectively. Complex formation was monitored at 5 and 20 °C for MT concentrations (αβ-tubulin dimers) of 26.5, 79.5, and 159.0 μm in the K18 titrations, and 2.8, 5.4, 20.0, 35.0, and 84.3 μm in the K19 titration. Normalized weighted average chemical shift differences for amide 1H and 15N chemical shifts upon polyanion/MT binding were calculated using Δav(NH) = [(ΔH2 + (ΔN/5)2)/2]1/2, where ΔH and ΔN are the differences between the free and bound chemical shifts.RESULTSBackbone Resonance Assignment of K18 and K19 —NMR resonances in 1H-15N HSQC spectra of the tau repeat domain constructs K18 and K19, uniformly labeled with 15N, were recorded at 5 °C and pH 6.9. The resonances were sharp and showed only a limited dispersion of chemical shifts, reflecting a high degree of backbone mobility and unfolded nature, in agreement with CD and FTIR measurements (7Schweers O. Schonbrunn-Hanebeck E. Marx A. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 24290-24297Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13von Bergen M. Barghorn S. Li L. Marx A. Biernat J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 48165-48174Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). To enable a study of the structure and dynamics of tau with atomic resolution, the assignment of the NMR resonances was required. Assignment of globular proteins with a molecular mass below 15 kDa is straightforward today using multidimensional NMR techniques. Backbone assignment of K18 (130 residues) and K19 (99 residues) was complicated, however, by the limited dispersion of NMR resonances because of the absence of well defined secondary and tertiary structure elements. In addition, only five amino acid types make up more than 50% of the primary sequence, and these amino acids are arranged in sequence motifs that occur repetitively, further increasing NMR signal overlap. Therefore, an unambiguous assignment was not possible just relying on the conventional three-dimensional spectra HNCO, HN(CA)CO, HNCACB and CBCA(CO)NH (19Bax A. Grzesiek S. Acc. Chem. Res. 1993; 26: 131-138Crossref Scopus (787) Google Scholar). A high-resolution (HA)CANNH (20Zweckstetter M. Bax A. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001; 123: 9490-9491Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) together with three-dimensional HNN and HN(C)N experiments were required (21Panchal S.C. Bhavesh N.S. Hosur R.V. J. Biomol. NMR. 2001; 20: 135-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). With these NMR spectra the backbone resonance assignment of K18 and K19 could be achieved in an iterative fashion based on automatic assignment using the program MARS (22Jung Y.S. Zweckstetter M. J. Biomol. NMR. 2004; 30: 11-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar) and manual assignment mainly relying on the HNN experiment. The sequence motif PGGG, which is located characteristically at the C-terminal end of each of the four repeats, caused the biggest problems. Because of severe chemical shift overlap, it was only possible to assign Gly273, Gly304, and Gly335. The resonances of the remaining glycines within these motifs could be identified in the spectra but not unambiguously assigned to one of the repeats. Otherwise, all 1H, 15N, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 13C′ chemical shifts were assigned in both K18 and K19.Soluble Tau Contains Residual β-Structure—NMR chemical shifts, in particular of Cα and C′ atoms, are very sensitive probes of secondary structure both in globular and unfolded proteins (Ref. 23Dyson H.J. Wright P.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 499-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar and Wishart et al. (18Wishart D.S. Sykes B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 239: 363-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (931) Google Scholar)). These shifts show small but distinct deviations from random coil values for both K18 and K19 (Fig. 2). In the case of K18, continuous stretches (containing more than six amino acids) of negative Cα secondary chemical shifts were found for residues Lys274-Leu284, Ser305-Leu315, and Gln336-Asp345 (numbering according to the longest isoform htau40), indicative of nascent β-structure (Fig. 2A). These stretches lie at the beginning of repeats R2, R3, and R4, downstream from PGGG motifs and encompass the hexapeptide motifs VQIINK and VQIVYK known to be important for the abnormal aggregation of tau into PHFs (8von Bergen M. Friedhoff P. Biernat J. Heberle J. Mandelkow E.M. Mandelkow E. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 363AGoogle Scholar). In case of C′, negative secondary chemical shifts were detected for a similar range of residues, Gly273-Leu282, Gly304-Asp314, and Gly335-Asp345 (supplemental Fig. S1). It is notable that the preponderance of negative secondary chemical shifts persists even at the beginning of the less homologous repeats R1 (residues Ala246-Leu253) and R5 (Asn368-Ile371). In the case of R1 this is likely not because of a propensity to form β-structure but rather because of the occurrence of three prolines (Pro247, Pro249, Pro251). Indeed, the C′ secondary chemical shifts alternated in this region consistent with the fact that Cα atoms of residues preceding prolines show unusual chemical shifts due to the absence of an amide proton in the proline. In the case of R5 the results must be viewed with caution because of the presence of only three residues of R5 (not counting the C-terminal residue). A remarkably similar pattern is observed for K19 even though repeat R2 (exon 10) is absent (Fig. 2C), suggesting that the repeats represent independent structural units. A quantitative analysis of the averaged Cα and C′ secondary chemical shifts (Fig. 2B) indicates that β-structure-like conformations are populated ∼16, 24, and 13% of the time for residues Lys274-Asp283, Ser305-Asp314, and Gln336-Asp345, respectively. Besides the regions in the beginning of each repeat, residues 295KDNIK299 and 357LDNIT361 in repeats R2 and R4 show a stretch of negative Cα/C′ secondary shifts, indicating a β-structure propensity. Note that no β-structure propensity is present in the corresponding region of repeat 3 (325LGNIH329), possibly because of the presence of a glycine (Fig. 2B).Fig. 2Secondary chemical shifts of tau constructs in solution. Secondary chemical shifts for Cα (A) and averaged for Cα and C′ (B) in K18 and Cα in K19 (C) recorded at 5 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9, protein concentration 1 mm. The average shifts in (B) were calculated as [3Δδ(Cα) + 4Δδ(C′)]/7. Regions of β-structure propensity are identified by negative values of Δav (CαC′) extending over several residues and are highlighted by boxes in (B). Repeat boundaries are indicated by vertical dashed lines. All glycines at position two and three in the PGGG motifs exhibited identical secondary chemical shifts.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The regions of high propensity for the β-structure are limited upstream by PGGG motifs, where the three glycines show positive Cα and C′ secondary chemical shifts in all four repeats. This indicates either a helical propensity or a turn, in agreement with the fact that GGK and GGS sequences (present in R1 or R2) are the most common motifs in classic γ-turns. Alternatively, the PGGG motif is also common in type II β-turns. The downstream ends of the regions of high β-structure propensity are most prominently identified by positive Cα/C′ secondary chemical shifts of the 10th and/or 11th residue in repeat 2–4 (Ser285, Ser316, Phe346) (Fig. 2B). Taking further into account that sequence dyads such as 285SN286 and 316SK317 (the motifs following high β-propensity regions in R2 and R3) are common in type I β-turns, the Cα and C′ secondary chemical shifts suggest a β-turn at the C-terminal end of the regions of high β-structure propensity.In conclusion, 8–10 residues at the beginning of repeats 2–4 show a residual β-structure sandwiched between regions with a high turn propensity. The most pronounced β-structure propensity is present at the N terminus of the third repeat, whereas in the second and fourth repeat it is approximately a factor of 1.5–2 lower. These β-conformations in K18 and K19 are presumably in rapid exchange with random like structures. The Cα secondary chemical pattern observed for K19 is almost identical to that in K18. This indicates that the removal of the second repeat does not affect the local β-structure propensity in the remaining part of the repeat domain of tau.Characterization of K18 and K19 and Its Polyanion Complexes—NMR signals of backbone amides constitute excellent probes of complex formation, providing maps of the interaction interfaces and binding constants (24Craik D.J. Wilce J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 195-232PubMed Google Scholar). The binding of the polyanions heparin and poly-Glu to K18 and K19 was monitored by 1H-15N HSQC spectra. The size of the chemical shift changes for increasing polyanion concentrations depends on the binding strength to the corresponding residues. At high polyanion concentrations chemical shift changes of some residues were accompanied by a decrease of the intensity of their signals, indicating chemical shift exchange intermediate on the NMR time scale (Fig. 3).Fig. 3NMR titration of K18 with polyanions and MTs. Overlay of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of 0.20 mm K18 (blue) with 0.15 mm heparin (red) (A), 0.30 mm K18 (blue) with 1.3 mm poly-Glu (red) (B), and 0.13 mm K18 (blue) with 0.80 mm MTs (red) (C). Spectra were recorded at 5 °C in 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.9. Some particularly strong shifts are indicated by arrows. In A the signal of Asn279 (N279) was already attenuated below detection, indicating a chemical shift exchange intermediate on the NMR time scale.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)In the case of heparin the residues exhibiting the largest displacements in the amide resonances of K18 were Val275-Leu284 at the beginning of the second repeat (Fig. 4A). In addition, strong chemical shift changes were observed in the environment of selected lysine and histidine residues: Leu253-Lys254, His268-Gln269, Lys298-Val300, His329-Lys331, and His362. The importance of lysine and histidine residues suggests that the binding to polyanions is electrostatically driven. Upon titration of K18 with poly-Glu, a similar pattern of chemical shift changes was observed (Fig. 4B), indicating that the overall binding behavior for the two types of polyanions is similar. In K19, repeat 2 is missing and can therefore not contribute to the interaction with polyanions. However, the same lysine and histidine residues as in K18 were strongly affected. In addition, slightly more pronounced chemical shift changes were observed for Val306-Lys311, the six residues in the third repeat that are important for tau aggregation to PHFs (Fig. 4, C and D).Fig. 4Binding of polyanions to tau. The mean weighted 1H-15N chemical shifts between the 1H-15N HSQC spectra of free tau and tau in the presence of polyanions are shown. A, 0.2 mm K18 with 0.15 mm heparin (∼1:1); B, 0.25 mm K18 with 1.3 mm poly-Glu (∼1:5); C 0.09 mm K19 with 1.3 mm heparin (∼1:14); and D 0.12 mm K19 with 1.35 mm poly-Glu (∼1:11). Resonances that were attenuated below detection by addition of polyanions are indicated by open bars. Gaps are due to overlap or the presence of prolines. The average molecular weight of heparin and poly-Glu was 3000 and 10,000, respectively. Repeat boundaries are indicated by vertical dashed lines. * indicate histidine-lysine dyads downstream of PGGG motifs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Concomitant with the chemical shift changes and the disappearance of some resonances at high polyanion concentrations (caused by ligand binding), the overall signal intensity in the 1H-15N HSQC spectra decreased with increasing polyanion concentration (after correction for dilution effects). The latter effect is likely due to partial aggregation, because biochemical analysis indicated that at the end of the polyanion titration 50% of K18 was polymerized, as analyzed by pelleting and SDS-PAGE. A similar behavior was observed in the K19-poly-Glu titration.To investigate the effect of aggregation further, we performed a series of 1H-15N HSQC spectra, in which the ratio of concentration between heparin and K18 (1:4) was held constant, and the sample was kept for variable times at 50 °C to induce and accelerate aggregation. After measurement of initial 1H-15N HSQCs without heparin and with a heparin:K18 ratio of 1:4 at 5 °C, the sample was heated to 50 °C and kept at this temperature for 2 h. After the 2 h the sample was cooled down to 5 °C, and an HSQC spectrum was recorded. This procedure was repeated five times, such that the protein was kept at 50 °C for 10 h in total. The addition of heparin induced the chemical shift changes that were reported in Fig. 4. The peak intensities for most residues were reduced by less than 15% upon addition of heparin with the exception of those residues showing very strong chemical shift changes. After the first 2 h at 50 °C the intensities of almost all peaks were reduced to 72% compared with the starting spectrum without heparin. There was no area in the protein that was affected particularly strongly, rather an overall loss of signal intensity was observed. At the same time, the chemical shift changes that were initially induced by addition of heparin were largely lost, i.e. the spectrum after 2 h at 50 °C with a heparin:K18 ratio of 1:4 was highly similar to the one of K18 before addition of heparin (shown in Fig. 3). After 4, 6, 8, and 10 h at 50 °C the overall signal intensity in 1H-15N HSQC spectra continuously decreased to 68, 65, 64, and 61% compared with the starting spectrum without heparin, respectively. No large chemical shift differences relative to the spectrum after 2 h at 50 °C were observed. In addition, the average transverse 15N relaxation time did not change compared with free K18 upon addition of heparin or after keeping the protein up to 10 h at 50 °C (data not shown). At the end of the temperature titration biochemical analysis indicated that ∼50% of K18 was polymerized. These data indicate that the observed chemical shift changes were because of the binding of the polyanion to the protein and not because of aggregation. When the protein was exposed to high levels of heparin for prolonged times or to high temperature at a constant heparin:K18 ratio of 1:4, part of the protein aggregated. As the chemical shift changes, which were induced by addition of heparin, were largely removed upon aggregation, heparin may become bound to the aggregates, thereby reducing the effective concentration of heparin in solution.The Binding Mode of MTs and Polyanions to Tau Is Similar—The binding of K18 and K19 to MTs was characterized using the NMR chemical shift perturbation method (24Craik D.J. Wilce J.A. Methods Mol. Biol. 1997; 60: 195-232PubMed Google Scholar) in which two-dimensional 1H-15N HSQC spectra of K18 and K19 were recorded"

BMP-9 (also known as growth and differentiation factor (GDF)-2) potently induces osteogenesis and chondrogenesis, has been implicated in the differentiation of cholinergic neurons, and may help regulate glucose metabolism. We have determined the structure of BMP-9 to 2.3 Å and examined the differences between our model and existing crystal structures of other BMPs, both in isolation and in complex with their receptors. TGF-β ligands are translated as precursors, with pro-regions that generally dissociate after cleavage from the ligand, but in some cases (including GDF-8 and TGF-β1, -2, and -3), the pro-region remains associated after secretion from the cell and inhibits binding of the ligand to its receptor. Although the proregion of BMP-9 remains tightly associated after secretion, we find, in several cell-based assays, that the activities of BMP-9 and BMP-9·pro-region complex were equivalent. Activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1), an orphan receptor in the TGF-β family, was also identified as a potential receptor for BMP-9 based on surface plasmon resonance studies (BIAcore) and the ability of soluble ALK-1 to block the activity of BMP-9·pro-region complex in cell-based assays.

A subset of this large and well conserved family is the group of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and growth and differentiation factors (GDFs), which regulate a diverse array of cellular functions, including differentiation, proliferation, organogenesis, axon guidance, apoptosis, and the establishment of left-right asymmetry (1Hogan B.L.

Biol. 2005; 277: 287-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). BMPs and GDFs are highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom, with examples ranging from Drosophila to humans. They have frequently been implicated in the treatment of bone disorders and injury, in accordance with their robust ability to generate de novo bone formation. All TGF-β ligands are translated as precursor proteins, consisting of an amino-terminal pro-region and a carboxyl-terminal ligand. This precursor forms a disulfide-linked homodimer in the cytoplasm, and the pro-region is then cleaved from the ligand. In most cases, the pro-region disassociates, and the mature ligand is secreted from the cell, but the pro-regions of GDF-8 (also known as myostatin) and TGF-β1, -2, and -3 remain noncovalently associated with the ligand after secretion and inhibit binding of their ligands to their respective receptors (4Thies R.S.

Transgenic mice overexpressing the pro-region of GDF-8 show dramatic increases in muscle mass, further indicating that the pro-region functionally inhibits GDF-8 (7Yang J. Ratovitski T. Brady J.P.

The proregion of BMP-9 also remains tightly associated after secretion from the cell. BMP signaling is induced when a dimeric ligand binds to the extracellular domains of two type I and two type II receptors (8Shi Y. Massagué J. Cell. 2003; 113: 685-700Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4867) Google Scholar). This assembly brings the intracellular domain of both receptor types into close proximity, permitting the constitutively active intracellular kinase domain of the type II receptor to cross-phosphorylate the intracellular Gly-Ser (GS) domain of the type I receptor (9Massagué J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67: 753-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (3999) Google Scholar). Receptor-regulated Smad proteins are phosphorylated by the activated type I receptor kinase and associate with Smad4. This complex translocates to the nucleus, interacting with various cofactors to modify gene expression (10Wrana J.L. Attisano L. Wieser R. Ventura F. Massagué J. Nature. 1994; 370: 341-347Crossref PubMed Scopus (2120) Google Scholar).

In vitro and in vivo, BMP-9 was found to promote cholinergic differentiation and the synthesis of acetylcholine and effectively maintained the cholinergic phenotype of differentiated cells (19Lopez-Coviella I.

More recently, BMP-9 was identified as a regulator of glucose metabolism by modulating the transcription of several genes that are involved in glucose and fatty acid metabolism, decreasing glucose production in cultured cells, and reducing glycemia in diabetic mice (23Chen C.

This fold has been previously described as a “hand” with a concave “palm” side and two parallel β-sheets forming the “fingers.” In the mature, dimeric ligand, these two β-sheet fingers extend from the cysteine core of the protein like butterfly wings. Binding to type I receptors occurs near the α-helix on the concave side at the junction between the two subunits (27Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), whereas binding to the type II receptors is located on the convex side of the hand near the “fingertips” (28Greenwald J. Groppe J.

We report here the structure of BMP-9 at 2.3 Å and examine structural differences between BMP-9 and BMP-2, BMP-7, the BMP-2·BMPR-IA complex, and the BMP-7·ActR-IIB complex. Results of in vitro cell-based assays indicate that both BMP-9 and BMP-9·pro-region complex are equally active in signaling and cell-growth stimulation, whereas the pro-region alone is inactive. Based on surface plasmon resonance and functional inhibition in several cell-based assays, we suggest activin receptor-like kinase-1 (ALK-1) as a functional receptor for BMP-9. Materials—All recombinant receptor:Fc chimeras were purchased from R & D Systems and were reconstituted as instructed by the manufacturer. BIAcore instrumentation, software, and CM5 sensor chips were purchased from BIACORE™ (Uppsala, Sweden). Fetal bovine serum and all other cell culture media were purchased from Invitrogen unless otherwise stated. Cell Lines—Rat hepatoma cell line H4IIe, mouse myoblast cell line C2C12, and mouse pre-adipocyte cell line 3T3-L1 were all obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA). These cell lines were propagated in media recommended by ATCC. The dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line DG44 (30Urlaub G. Kas E. Carothers A.M. Chasin L.A. Cell. 1983; 33: 405-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar) was propagated in minimal essential α+ medium, 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum, and 4 mm l-glutamine. Selections were performed in minimal essential α- medium lacking ribonucleotide and deoxyribonucleotide supplements, supplemented with 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 4 mm glutamine. Methotrexate (Sigma) was used at the concentrations indicated. Protein Expression and Purification—The coding sequence for full-length BMP-9 with pro-region was cloned into pC4, a proprietary mammalian expression vector, and the construct was transfected into dihydrofolate reductase-deficient Chinese hamster ovary cell line DG44 using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Typically, ∼1 × 106 cells were transfected with 5 μl of Lipofectamine 2000, 5 μg of pC4.BMP-9, and 0.5 μg of pSV2.NEO plasmids. The transfected cells were put into selection after ∼36 h in minimal essential α- medium containing 25 nm methotrexate and 1 mg/ml geneticin. After ∼2-3 weeks, single clones were isolated and seeded into 24-well plates. When confluent, the supernatants from these clones were screened for BMP-9 activity using cell-based reporter assays. The high expressing clones were selected and amplified stepwise up to 0.5 mm methotrexate. For large scale production of BMP-9, a high expressing clone was grown in Chinese hamster ovary-5 medium (a Human Genome Sciences proprietary serum-free medium without insulin) for 5 days, and the conditioned medium was harvested. To purify the BMP-9·pro-region complex, 2-5 liters of BMP-9 culture supernatant was adjusted to pH 6.4 with pH 5.0, 1 m MES, and diluted to a conductivity of <7-8 ms. The sample was loaded on a 50-ml POROS 50 HS (Perseptive Biosystems) column that had been pre-equilibrated with pH 6.4, 20 mm MES, and 50 mm NaCl. BMP-9 complex was eluted with a 20-column-volume pH gradient from pH 6.4 to 8.0, with pH 8.0 buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl and 50 mm NaCl. The fractions of partially purified BMP-9·pro-region complex were pooled and adjusted to pH 7.4 with pH 9.0, 1 m Tris, and diluted to the conductivity <5 ms. The sample was loaded onto an 8-ml MonoQ column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with pH 7.4 and 20 mm Tris. BMP-9·pro-region complex was eluted by a 15-column-volume salt gradient of 0-0.5 m NaCl. For cell-based assays, BMP-9 dimer was separated from its proregion using 50% cold ethanol precipitation. After cold precipitation, the pro-region and remaining BMP-9·pro-region complex were spun down, leaving isolated, dimeric BMP-9 in the supernatant. The precipitation was repeated once after dissolving the pro-region and BMP-9·pro-region complex in pH 7.4, 20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl. The proregion was further separated from BMP-9·pro-region complex on a MonoQ column using the same procedure as used to purify the complex. Soluble BMP-9 in the supernatant was concentrated using a CentriPrep (Amicon), and the buffer was changed to pH 7.4, 20 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, 30% ethanol. For native and SDS gels, BMP-9 dimer and pro-region were isolated by reverse phase chromatography, using a C4 high pressure liquid chromatography column (Vydac) and eluted with a 27-42% acetonitrile gradient. BMP-9 dimer eluted at 31% acetonitrile, and the pro-region eluted at 35% acetonitrile. Fractions were frozen in liquid nitrogen, lyophilized, and reconstituted in water. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Refinement—Dimeric BMP-9 was crystallized from a solution containing BMP-9 dimer, BMP-9 monomer, pro-region, and other secreted proteins in a condition identified from sparse matrix (Hampton) screening. Total protein concentrations ranged from 3.8 to 9 mg/ml, with BMP-9 dimer constituting ∼15-20% of the total protein. Crystals of BMP-9 were obtained by hanging drop at 23 °C with a well solution of 1-1.2 m NaCl, 7-10 mm hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, and 10 mm MgCl2. Drops containing crystals of BMP-9 were flooded with mother liquor supplemented with 12-15% glycerol as a cryoprotectant. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and diffraction data were obtained at Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory on beam line 9.2. All integration and scaling were performed with HKL2000. The space group was found to be I4122, with unit cell dimensions a = b = 71.23, c = 144.90, α = β = γ = 90°. A molecular replacement solution was found using MolRep (31Project Collaborative Computational Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-776Crossref PubMed Scopus (19797) Google Scholar) with the structure of BMP-2 monomer as the search model. The asymmetric unit contains one copy of the BMP-9 monomer, leaving a solvent content of 67.6%. The protein was manually rebuilt in O (32Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 100-119Google Scholar), and the structure was refined using Refmac5 (Collaborative Computational Project 4) and crystallography NMR software (33Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). Four translation, libration, and screw rotation groups were used, dividing the protein into regions from Ala4 to Ala34, Tyr35 to His54, Ala55 to Lys78, and Leu79 to Gly108. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Approximately 100 μg of total protein from Chinese hamster ovary cell media was run in 10 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl over an S-200 size exclusion chromatography column. Native Gels and SDS-PAGE—Native gels were 6% polyacrylamide, pH 8.8, and run at 27 mA. Proteins were mixed to final concentrations of 1-3 mg/ml and allowed to equilibrate for at least 15 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 °C before loading. Non-reducing SDS gels were 12% polyacrylamide and run at 200 mV. Alkaline Phosphatase Assay—Mouse pluripotent C2C12 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 4 mm l-glutamine, 1.5 g/liter sodium bicarbonate, 4.5 g/liter glucose, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. For the alkaline phosphatase assay, C2C12 cells were seeded in 96-well tissue culture plates at 1,000 cells/well in 100 μl of medium. The following day, the medium was removed and replaced with treatments in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.1% fetal bovine serum. The cells were cultured for 4 days and conditioned media were collected for measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity. In inhibitor studies, soluble receptors were added at the indicated concentrations with BMP-9·pro-region complex (5 nm) or BMP-4 (4.7 nm). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using the Phospha-Light™ System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's directions. Briefly, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in buffer containing 0.2% Triton X-100, incubated 5 min in assay buffer and 20 min in reaction buffer containing CSPD (disodium 3-(4-methoxy-spirol1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo[3.3.1.1(3,7)]decan-4-yl)phenyl phosphate) substrate. CSPD substrate produces a luminescent signal when dephosphorylated by alkaline phosphatase in an alkaline, hydrophobic environment, resulting in anion production, which emits light upon decomposition. The luminescent signal was read using a luminescent plate reader (Applied Biosystems). All treatments were performed in triplicate. The average and S.D. were determined and data plotted using Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). Cell Proliferation Assay—Mouse pre-adipocyte 3T3-L1 cells were plated at 4,000 cells/well in white 96-well tissue culture plates (Costar) in 100 μl of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were cultured overnight. To arrest cell growth, the cells were washed once with low serum medium (0.1% fetal bovine serum), 100 μl of low serum medium was added, and the cells were cultured overnight. BMP-9, BMP-9·pro-region complex, pro-region, or controls were added to cells at indicated concentrations. In inhibitor studies, soluble receptors were also added at the indicated concentrations with BMP-9 proteins (4 nm) or BMP-4 (3.7 nm). The cells were incubated for 4 days, and cell number assayed using the Cell Titer Glo assay (Promega, Madison, WI) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In brief, 100 μl of assay reagent was added to the cells at room temperature, mixed, and incubated for ∼30 min. The luminescent signal was read using a luminescent plate reader. All treatments were performed in triplicate and analyzed with Prism software. Malic Enzyme-SEAP Reporter Assay—Promoter region (base pairs -1183 to -77) of rat malic enzyme (ME) was cloned into the promoterless pSEAP2-neomycin vector and fused in-frame with the SEAP gene. The construct was transfected into the rat hepatoma cell line H4IIe, and stable clones were selected for neomycin resistance. To perform the reporter assay, ∼75,000 cells/well were plated in 96-well plates. The growth medium was Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 15 mm HEPES, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were cultured for 24 h. Reporter cells were then serum-deprived for 18-24 h before being treated with BMP-9, BMP-9·pro-region complex, pro-region, or controls. For the experiments using soluble BMP receptors, the cells were treated with various concentrations of soluble receptors prior to the addition of BMP-9·pro-region complex (2 nm) or BMP-4 (0.4 nm). After a 48-h incubation period, conditioned media were removed, and SEAP activity was determined using the Phospha-Light™ System according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. Light emission from the wells was measured in a MLX Microtiter Plate Luminometer (Dynex Technologies). All treatments were performed in triplicate and analyzed with Prism software. Biosensor Surface Preparation for BIAcore Analysis—To determine receptor specificity for BMP-9, three high density CM5 chips were prepared. Each chip contained four flow cells, with one flow cell/chip immobilized with an unrelated receptor:Fc as a negative Fc control (trail-receptor:Fc). The remaining flow cells contained one of the following BMP receptors (each fused to Fc): BMPR-IA, BMPR-IB, BMPR-II, ALK-1, ALK-7, activin receptor IA (ActR-IA), ActR-IB, ActR-IIA, and ActR-IIB. The immobilization level, defined in relative units, ranged from 7,110 to 17,300. Purified BMP-9·pro-region complex was applied at 50 μg/ml (1 μm) to each individual flow cell for 2 min. Measured on-rates and off-rates after global fits to binding curves were used to derive binding affinity. BMP-9 was crystallized and solved with molecular replacement at a resolution of 2.32 Å (Table I). BMP-9 shows the characteristic cysteine knot scaffold and overall butterfly-like conformation, with an α-helix (“knuckle,” α3) epitope and two β-stranded sheets (fingers F1 and F2) extending from the core of the molecule (Fig. 1A), but it also deviates from known BMP structures in regions known to be important for receptor binding.Table IData collection and model refinement statisticsBeamlineSSRL 9-2Wavelength (Å)1.0000Rmerge (%)7.7 (35.7)bNumbers in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell (2.32-2.40 Å).Number of unique reflections8,346Average redundancy13.5 (11.3)Average I/σI26.6 (6.9)Completeness (%)99.5 (97.4)RefinementResolution range (Å)50.00-2.32Rcryst (%)24.9Rfree (%)aCalculated from 5% of data not used in refinement.27.6Average B (Å2)60.2Root mean square deviationBonds (Å)0.018Angles (Å)1.958Number of atomsProtein871Water40Ramachandran non-Gly non-Pro residues in:Most favored77 (85.6%)Additional allowed12 (13.3%)Generously allowed1 (1.1%)a Calculated from 5% of data not used in refinement.b Numbers in parentheses correspond to highest resolution shell (2.32-2.40 Å). Open table in a new tab Previous structural studies of BMP-2 in complex with BMPR-IA ectodomain revealed the residues likely to be involved in determining binding affinity and specificity (defined by a 4.0-Å cutoff and colored green in Fig. 1B). To examine which structural differences between BMP-2 and BMP-9 might influence receptor binding, BMP-2/BMPR-IA (Protein Data Bank (PDB) entry 1ES7) was aligned with BMP-9 using least squares minimization. This comparison reveals the regions of the ligands that are likely to be significantly different, particularly the pre-helix loop. To quantify differences between BMP-9 and BMP-2, C-α r.m.s. deviations between BMP-9 and free (uncomplexed) BMP-2 (PDB entry 3BMP) were calculated. The average r.m.s. deviation for the monomer is 1.50 Å. Of the amino acids likely to be involved in binding a type I receptor, C-α r.m.s. deviations >1 S.D. above the mean occur between residues Gly27 in BMP-2 and Gly21 in BMP-9 and the segments Phe49-Asp53 in BMP-2 and Phe43-Asp47 in BMP-9. One residue pair (Pro50 in BMP-2 and Pro44 in BMP-9) at the type I interface has an r.m.s. deviation >1.5 S.D. from the mean. All of these residues are located in the pre-helix loop, or “wrist” epitope (colored red in Fig. 1A). The crystal structure of BMP-7 in complex with activin receptor IIA (ActR-IIA, PDB entry 1LX5) has previously been solved, and the residues likely to be involved in binding (defined by a 4.0-Å cutoff) are colored red in Fig. 1C. Root mean square deviations were also calculated between BMP-9 and free BMP-7 (PDB entry 1LXI). One position at the type II binding interface, Ala58 in BMP-7 and Ala28 in BMP-9, was found to have the most pronounced difference from the mean r.m.s. deviation (1.76 Å). In a sequence alignment of BMP-9 and BMP-2 (Fig. 2), sequence differences in binding regions identified by structural and mutational (27Kirsch T. Sebald W. Dreyer M.K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 492-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar) studies are most notable in residues Asn59 in BMP-2 and Lys53 in BMP-9 (acidic to basic) and in residues His54 in BMP-2 and Asp58 in BMP-9 (basic to acidic). A comparison between the amino acid sequences of BMP-9 and BMP-7 (Fig. 2) also reveals significant changes, including Tyr44 in BMP-7 to Arg14 in BMP-9 (aromatic to basic), Glu60 in BMP-7 to Lys30 in BMP-9 (acidic to basic), and Gly61 in BMP-7 to Glu31 in BMP-9 (aliphatic to acidic) at the type II binding interface. Based on the BMP-7/ActR-IIB structure (28Greenwald J. Groppe J. Gray P. Wiater E. Kwiatkowski W. Vale W. Choe S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 605-617Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar), Tyr44 and Gly61 both interact with the acidic Asn65, and Glu60 interacts with basic Lys76. These data indicate that differences between BMP-7 and BMP-9 in binding affinity for type II receptors are most likely because of amino acid changes at the binding interface, although type II receptors are generally quite promiscuous (37Sebald W. Nickel J. Zhang J.L. Mueller T.D. Biol. Chem. 2004; 385: 697-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). BMP-9, when purified from cell medium, remains noncovalently associated with its pro-region. This complex runs as a single peak by size exclusion chromatography, with a retention volume consistent with a complex of one BMP-9 dimer and two pro-regions (Fig. 3A). An SDS gel shows clean separation after reverse-phase chromatography (Fig. 3B). When separated, BMP-9 and pro-region are recombined in equimolar quantities and run on a native gel, a band similar to what is seen in the original protein solution appears, and neither the isolated dimeric BMP-9 band nor the isolated pro-region band is observed, indicating that the complex can be reformed after separation (Fig. 3C). Biological activities of isolated BMP-9, BMP-9·pro-region complex, and pro-region alone were tested by three different in vitro assays using distinct cell types. Isolated BMP-9·pro-region complex, BMP-9, and pro-region were tested for the ability to stimulate secretion of alkaline phosphatase from C2C12 cells (Fig. 4A), to activate transcription of H4IIe/ME-SEAP gene reporter (Fig. 4B), and to induce proliferation of the 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line (Fig. 4C). Both purified BMP-9 and BMP-9·pro-region complex were highly active in all three assays, and the degree of activation was dose-dependent. The presence of the pro-region did not alter the activity of BMP-9, as the acti"

https://openalex.org/W1966928239,"Centrosome-independent microtubule polymerization around chromosomes has been shown to require a local gradient of RanGTP, which discharges mitotic cargoes from the nuclear import receptor importin beta. Here, we have used an activity-based assay in Xenopus egg extracts to purify the mRNA export protein Rae1 as a spindle assembly factor regulated by this pathway. Rae1 is a microtubule-associated protein that binds directly to importin beta. Depletion of Rae1 from extracts or cells severely inhibits mitotic spindle assembly. A purified Rae1 complex stabilizes microtubules in egg extracts in a RanGTP/importin beta-regulated manner. Interestingly, Rae1 exists in a large ribonucleoprotein complex, which requires RNA for its activity to control microtubule dynamics in vitro. Furthermore, we provide evidence that RNA associates with the mitotic spindle and that it plays a direct, translation-independent role in spindle assembly. Our studies reveal an unexpected function for RNA in spindle morphogenesis."

In the natural infection, DV is introduced into human skin by an infected mosquito vector where it is believed to target immature dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells (LCs).

Binding of mannosylated N-glycans on DV E protein to DC-SIGN triggers a rapid and efficient internalization of the viral glycoprotein. However, we observed that endocytosis-defective DC-SIGN molecules allow efficient DV replication, indicating that DC-SIGN endocytosis is dispensable for the internalization step in DV entry. Together, these results argue in favor of a mechanism by which DC-SIGN enhances DV entry and infection in cis. We propose that DC-SIGN concentrates mosquito-derived DV particles at the cell surface to allow efficient interaction with an as yet unidentified entry factor that is ultimately responsible for DV internalization and pH-dependent fusion into DCs.

Monath T.P. The Flavivirus: Pathogenesis and Immunity. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York2003Google Scholar). The four serotypes of DV (DV-1 to DV-4) are transmitted to humans by the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti (1Chambers T.J. Monath T.P. The Flavivirus: Pathogenesis and Immunity. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York2003Google Scholar, 2Weaver S.C. Barrett A.D. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). DV infection results in a spectrum of illnesses, ranging from a flu-like disease (dengue fever) to dengue hemorrhagic fever that can progress to dengue shock syndrome and death (1Chambers T.J. Monath T.P. The Flavivirus: Pathogenesis and Immunity. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., New York2003Google Scholar).DV is a lipid-enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive sense RNA genome, which replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells (2Weaver S.C.

Microbiol. 2005; 3: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The 11-kb viral RNA encodes for a large polyprotein precursor, which is processed by both host and viral proteases to yield the non-structural proteins NS1 to NS5 and three structural proteins: C (core), prM (the intracellular precursor of the M protein), and E (envelope) glycoprotein (2Weaver S.C.

Microbiol. 2005; 3: 13-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (869) Google Scholar). The E protein is assumed to bind cellular receptors that direct DV particles to the endocytic pathway. The acidic environment in the endosome is believed to trigger major conformational changes in the E protein, which induce fusion of the viral and host cell membranes, resulting in entry of the virion into the cytoplasm (3Mukhopadhyay S. Kuhn R.J. Rossmann M.G. Nat. Rev.

Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 789-801Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Immature dendritic cells (DCs) and Langerhans cells (LCs), which are normally resident in the skin, have been shown to be infected by DV and are believed to be the first cells targeted by the virus (4Wu S.J.

The DV E protein, which is the only glycoprotein exposed on the surface of mature DV virions, is responsible for attachment to the host cell surface and plays an important role in viral entry (3Mukhopadhyay S.

Furthermore, carbohydrate residues present on the E glycoprotein have been reported to be important for virus binding to host cells (11Hung S.L. Lee P.L. Chen H.W. Chen L.K. Kao C.L. King C.C. Virology. 1999; 257: 156-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). In contrast to other viral glycoproteins that bind DC-SIGN and are highly glycosylated, DV E protein has only two potential N-linked glycosylation sites at Asn-67 and Asn-153, which are differentially used by the four DV serotypes (12Johnson A.J. Guirakhoo F. Roehrig J.T. Virology. 1994; 203: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The molecular interactions of E protein with DC-SIGN, believed to be a key element for DV entry into DCs, are currently poorly understood. Following binding to DC-SIGN, DV is believed to be internalized and targeted to an acidic endosomal compartment where membrane fusion occurs (3Mukhopadhyay S. Kuhn R.J. Rossmann M.G. Nat. Rev.

Med. 2003; 197: 121-127Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar), it is currently unknown whether DC-SIGN is directly responsible for targeting DV to endosomes or whether it merely increases the local concentration of virions in the proximity of a true entry receptor.In this study, we have examined the role of DC-SIGN in the process of DV entry into DCs. Our results formally identify the E protein as the DV determinant responsible for attachment to DC-SIGN and suggest a critical role for high mannose N-glycans in interactions between DV E protein and DC-SIGN. We provide strong evidence that DC-SIGN-mediated DV endocytosis is dispensable for DV infection of target cells and hence propose that DC-SIGN acts as a critical DV attachment factor that may facilitate subsequent interaction of viral particles with an as yet unidentified cellular receptor, which leads to DV entry.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of DV-1 sE and DC-SIGN Mutants—The pIND-prM/E plasmid codes for the mature form of DV-1 (strain FGA/NA d1d (French Guiana)) prM and E envelope proteins (16Courageot M.P.

It was used as a template to generate recombinant Semliki forest virus (SFV) encoding for the DV prM and soluble form of E protein (sE). The sequence coding for prM protein and the ectodomain of DV-1 E envelope protein (amino acids 101–673 in the DV polyprotein) was amplified by PCR (Pwo DNA polymerase, Roche Applied Science) using the sense primer 5′-ATATTGGATCCGCGCGCATGTCCGTGACCATGCTCCTC-3′ and the antisense primer 5′-ATATTATGCATGCGGCCGCTAGGCGGGGGCCACCTGGGAGGTCTCGGTGCCCTTGAACCAGCTTAGTTT-3′. The antisense primer encodes for the 1D4 tag peptide sequence.

Unbound glycoprotein was removed by two washes with serum-free RPMI 1640. For inhibition assays, cells were preincubated with inhibitors in FACS buffer for 15 min at 4 °C before addition of labeled envelope protein preparations containing inhibitor. Inhibitors were used at 20 μg·ml–1 mannan (Sigma), 1B10, isotype control IgG, or 5 mm EGTA (Sigma) final concentration. For internalization assays, washed cells having captured 35S-labeled soluble proteins were incubated for the indicated times either at 4 or at 37 °C to initiate endocytosis. Half the cells incubated at both 4 and 37 °C were treated with EDTA (25 mm, Sigma) at 4 °C for 10 min to remove cell surface bound 35S-labeled soluble glycoprotein, thus allowing quantification of internalized protein. The remainder of the cells were mock-treated with RPMI 1640 at 4 °C for 10 min to evaluate the total bound 35S-labeled glycoprotein. All cells were then washed twice in serum-free RPMI 1640 to eliminate background radioactivity.

To determine whether each cell type displays the characteristic phenotype of DCs and LCs, cells were stained for expression of CD1a, DC-SIGN, and Langerin, a C-type lectin selectively expressed by LCs and involved in the formation of a LC-specific organelle, the Birbeck granule (26Figdor C.G. van Kooyk Y.

Monocyte-derived DCs express, as expected, high levels of DC-SIGN and CD1a (Fig. 1A). In contrast, they do not express the C-type lectin Langerin, which is present on more than 90% of the CD1a+ LCs. As previously described for epidermal LCs (28Engering A. Geijtenbeek T.B. van Vliet S.J. Wijers M. van Liempt E. Demaurex N. Lanzavecchia A. Fransen J. Figdor C.G. Piguet V. van Kooyk Y. J. Immunol. 2002; 168: 2118-2126Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar), we found that in vitro differentiated LCs do not express DC-SIGN (Fig. 1A). Immature DCs and LCs were infected with the DV-1 strain FGA/NA d1d, produced in Aedes AP61 cells. Viral replication was quantified at 40 h post-infection by FACS analysis using antibodies specific for NS1 protein, a non-structural protein produced only during active DV infection. As shown in Fig. 1B, more than 30% of monocyte-derived DCs were productively infected by FGA/NA d1d DV-1 strain. In contrast, exposure of LCs to the same DV strain resulted in infection of less than 1% of cells. Similar results were obtained with other DV serotypes (data not shown). These findings indicate that DV productively infects immature DCs and not LCs.DC-SIGN Mediates Infection of DCs by the Four DV Serotypes—To study the interaction of DV with DCs in more detail, we challenged immature DCs with representative mosquito-derived DV strains from the four serotypes at different m.o.i. Fig. 2A shows that DV-1 to DV-4 productively infect human immature DCs. Competition experiments indicated that infection of DCs by DV-1 FGA/NA d1d is completely inhibited by DC-SIGN neutralizing mAb and unaffected by isotype control Ab (Fig. 2B). Similar results were obtained with DV serotypes DV-2, DV-3, and DV-4 (data not shown). Titration of cell-free supernatants collected from DCs challenged with the four DV serotypes shows that infected DCs release equal amounts of infectious viral particles. Furthermore, preincubation of DCs with neutralizing anti-DC-SIGN Ab prior to infection abrogates virus production (Fig. 2C). Exposure of immature DCs to infectious DV particles has been shown to induce DC maturation (29Libraty D.H. Pichyangkul S. Ajariyakhajorn C. Endy T.P. Ennis F.A. J.

To evaluate whether this activation process requires DC-SIGN-mediated viral infection, we challenged immature DCs with DV-1 FGA/NA d1d at an m.o.i. of 5, in the presence or absence of anti-DC-SIGN mAb or isotype control Ab. At 40 h post-infection, cell surface expression of CD83 and CD86, two DC maturation markers, was evaluated by flow cytometry (Fig. 2D). Consistent with previous studies, challenge of immature DCs with DV resulted in a robust up-regulation of CD83 and CD86 cell surface expression. As a control, expression levels of CD1a were similar in mock-infected or cells infected with DV-1. We found that mean surface levels of HLA-DR were also up-regulated in DV-infected DCs, whereas DC-SIGN expression was slightly decreased (data not shown). Compared with isotype control Ab, preincubation of cells with neutralizing anti-DC-SIGN Ab significantly inhibited DV-mediated DC maturation as indicated by the absence of CD83 and CD86 up-regulation in infected cells (Fig. 2D). Similar results were obtained with the other DV serotypes (data not shown). In control experiments, incubation of immature DCs with UV-inactivated DV did not induce DC maturation, suggesting that this process is dependent on viral replication rather than capture of DV particles by DCs (data not shown). Overall, these data indicate that DC-SIGN is a critical factor for productive infection of DCs by all DV serotypes and consequentl"
https://openalex.org/W2093087608,"In eukaryotic cells, the SH2 and PTB domains mediate protein-protein interactions by recognizing phosphotyrosine residues on target proteins. Here we make the unexpected finding that the C2 domain of PKCδ directly binds to phosphotyrosine peptides in a sequence-specific manner. We provide evidence that this domain mediates PKCδ interaction with a Src binding glycoprotein, CDCP1. The crystal structure of the PKCδ C2 domain in complex with an optimal phosphopeptide reveals a new mode of phosphotyrosine binding in which the phosphotyrosine moiety forms a ring-stacking interaction with a histidine residue of the C2 domain. This is also the first example of a protein Ser/Thr kinase containing a domain that binds phosphotyrosine."

https://openalex.org/W1968332969,"Activation of cell-surface receptors stimulates generation of intracellular signals that, in turn, direct the cellular response. However, mechanisms that ensure combinatorial control of these signaling events are not well understood. We show here that the Ca2+ and reactive oxygen intermediates generated upon BCR activation rapidly engage in a cooperative interaction that acts in a feedback manner to amplify the early signal generated. This cooperativity acts by regulating the concentration of the oxidant produced. The latter exerts its influence through a pulsed inactivation of receptor-coupled phosphatases, where the amplitude of this pulse is determined by oxidant concentration. The extent of phosphatase inhibition, in turn, dictates what proportion of receptor-proximal kinases are activated and, as a result, the net strength of the initial signal. It is the strength of this initial signal that finally determines the eventual duration of BCR signaling and the rate of its transmission through downstream pathways."

Besides already characterized genes, we identified a cDNA with yet unknown functions, which we further characterized and named PRINS (Psoriasis susceptibility-related RNA Gene Induced by Stress). In silico structural and homology studies suggested that PRINS may function as a noncoding RNA. PRINS harbors two Alu elements, it is transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and it is expressed at different levels in various human tissues. Real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that PRINS was expressed higher in the uninvolved epidermis of psoriatic patients compared with both psoriatic lesional and healthy epidermis, suggesting a role for PRINS in psoriasis susceptibility. PRINS is regulated by the proliferation and differentiation state of keratinocytes. Treatment with T-lymphokines, known to precipitate psoriatic symptoms, decreased PRINS expression in the uninvolved psoriatic but not in healthy epidermis. Real time reverse transcription-PCR analysis showed that stress signals such as ultraviolet-B irradiation, viral infection (herpes simplex virus), and translational inhibition increased the RNA level of PRINS. Gene-specific silencing of PRINS by RNA interference revealed that down-regulation of PRINS impairs cell viability after serum starvation but not under normal serum conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2117327744,"The nitration of protein tyrosine residues represents an important post-translational modification during development, oxidative stress, and biological aging. To rationalize any physiological changes with such modifications, the actual protein targets of nitration must be identified by proteomic methods. While several studies have used proteomics to screen for 3-nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in vivo, most of these studies have failed to prove nitration unambiguously through the actual localization of 3-nitrotyrosine to specific sequences by mass spectrometry. In this paper we have applied sequential solution isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE for the proteomic characterization of specific 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences of nitrated target proteins in vivo using nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Specifically, we analyzed proteins from the skeletal muscle of 34-month-old Fisher 344/Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats, a well accepted animal model for biological aging. We identified the 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences of 11 proteins, including cytosolic creatine kinase, tropomyosin 1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, myosin light chain, aldolase A, pyruvate kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, actinin, γ-actin, ryanodine receptor 3, and neurogenic locus notch homolog. For creatine kinase and neurogenic locus notch homolog, two 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences were identified, i.e. at positions 14 and 20 for creatine kinase and at positions 1175 and 1205 for the neurogenic locus notch homolog. The selectivity of the in vivo nitration of creatine kinase at Tyr14 and Tyr20 does not correspond to the product selectivity in vitro, where exclusively Tyr82 was nitrated when creatine kinase was exposed to peroxynitrite. The latter experiments demonstrate that the in vitro exposure of an isolated protein to peroxynitrite may not always be a good model to mimic protein nitration in vivo. The nitration of protein tyrosine residues represents an important post-translational modification during development, oxidative stress, and biological aging. To rationalize any physiological changes with such modifications, the actual protein targets of nitration must be identified by proteomic methods. While several studies have used proteomics to screen for 3-nitrotyrosine-containing proteins in vivo, most of these studies have failed to prove nitration unambiguously through the actual localization of 3-nitrotyrosine to specific sequences by mass spectrometry. In this paper we have applied sequential solution isoelectric focusing and SDS-PAGE for the proteomic characterization of specific 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences of nitrated target proteins in vivo using nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry. Specifically, we analyzed proteins from the skeletal muscle of 34-month-old Fisher 344/Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats, a well accepted animal model for biological aging. We identified the 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences of 11 proteins, including cytosolic creatine kinase, tropomyosin 1, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, myosin light chain, aldolase A, pyruvate kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, actinin, γ-actin, ryanodine receptor 3, and neurogenic locus notch homolog. For creatine kinase and neurogenic locus notch homolog, two 3-nitrotyrosine-containing sequences were identified, i.e. at positions 14 and 20 for creatine kinase and at positions 1175 and 1205 for the neurogenic locus notch homolog. The selectivity of the in vivo nitration of creatine kinase at Tyr14 and Tyr20 does not correspond to the product selectivity in vitro, where exclusively Tyr82 was nitrated when creatine kinase was exposed to peroxynitrite. The latter experiments demonstrate that the in vitro exposure of an isolated protein to peroxynitrite may not always be a good model to mimic protein nitration in vivo."

Saturated (SFA) 1The abbreviations used are: SFA, saturated fatty acid; MUFA,monounsaturated fatty acids; SCD, stearoyl-CoA desaturase; TAG,:triacylglycerol; CE, cholesterol ester; FFA, unesterified fatty acid; hSCD,human stearoyl-CoA desaturase; FBS, fetal bovine serum; BSA, bovine serumalbumin; MEM, minimal essential medium.and monounsaturated (MUFA) fatty acids are the most abundant fatty acidspresent in mammalian organisms. As building blocks of phospholipids,triacylglycerols (TAGs), and cholesteryl esters (CEs), fatty acids arefundamental constituents of membranes, vital stores of metabolic energy, andrelevant mediators/signals that regulate major cellular activities. Becausechanging levels of SFA and MUFA can influence a broad spectrum of cellularfunctions, the content and distribution of SFA and MUFA within the cell mustbe tightly controlled. One key regulator of fatty acid composition isstearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), the endoplasmic reticulum-resident enzyme thatcatalyzes the introduction of the first double bond in thecis-Δ9 position of several saturated fatty acyl-CoAs,principally palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA, to render palmitoleyl- andoleyl-CoA (1Enoch H.G. Catalá A. Strittmatter P. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5095-5103Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The presence of SCD has been described in a wide variety of organisms(2Sperling P. Ternes P. Zank T.K. Heinz E. Prost. Leukotr. Essential FattyAcids. 2003; 68: 73-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Among the best studiedmammalian models, rodents have four SCD isoforms (SCD1–4) expressed in atissue-specific manner (3Ntambi J.M. Miyazaki M. Prog. Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar). SCDexpression and activity are regulated by a large number of factors, includingdietary cholesterol and fatty acids, several hormones, and growth factors(4Ntambi J.M. J. LipidRes. 1999; 40: 1549-1558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Most of these studies havebeen done using rodent models, and little is known about human SCD. Twoisoforms of SCD (SCD and ACOD4) have been described for humans, bothexhibiting ∼85% homology with murine SCD1(5Zhang L. Ge L. Parimoo S. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar,6Beiraghi S. Zhou M. Talmadge C.B. Went-Sumegi N. Davis J.R. Huang D. Saal H. Seemayer T.A. Sumegi J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 309: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). ACOD4 is almost exclusivelyexpressed in fetal brain, with little or no detectable expression in adulttissues (6Beiraghi S.

The SCD gene isubiquitously expressed, although the overall level of expression differs amongtissues, with high levels in brain, liver, heart, and lung(5Zhang L. Ge L. Parimoo S. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Because the lipid products of SCD are used for modulating membranestructure (7Sun Y. Hao M. Luo Y. Liang C.P. Silver D.L.

Lipid Res. 2004; 43: 91-104Crossref PubMed Scopus (552) Google Scholar), SCD has been suggested toplay a key role in cell proliferation and in lipid-mediated cytotoxicity. Inthis regard, it has been observed that SCD is a target of growth factors andhormones that regulate key cell cycle events. Retinoic acid and transforminggrowth factor-β are reported to regulate SCD expression in a number ofuntransformed human cell types(9Samuel W. Kutty R.K. Nagineni S. Gordon J.S. Prouty S.M.

Very recently, it wasdemonstrated that platelet-derived growth factor and fibroblast growth factorsFGF-2 and FGF-4 up-regulate SCD expression in human fibroblasts through theactivation of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1) byphosphatidylinositol 3-kinase(11Demoulin J.B. Ericsson J. Kallin A. Rorsman C. Ronnstrand L. Heldin C.H. J. Biol.Chem. 2004; 279: 35392-35402Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). In this work, theactivation of SCD by growth factors was paralleled by an increase in thesynthesis of phospholipids and cholesterol, supporting the idea that MUFAsynthesis is an integral part of the program of membrane synthesis. SCD has arole in lipid-mediated apoptosis, because it has been shown thatoverexpression of SCD1 in Chinese hamster ovary cells protects against thecytotoxic effects of excess SFA(12Listenberger L.L. Han X. Lewis S.E. Cases S. Farese Jr., R.V. Ory D.S. Schaffer J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 3077-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (1407) Google Scholar). A linkage between SCD activity and tumor cell proliferation has also beenproposed. Increased expression level of SCD was found in colonic andesophageal carcinoma and in hepatocellular adenoma(13Li J. Ding S.F. Habib N.A. Fermor B.F. Wood C.B. Gilmour R.S. Int. J. Cancer. 1994; 57: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), as well as in chemicallyinduced tumors (14Thai S.F. Allen J.W. DeAngelo A.B. George M.H. Fuscoe J.C. Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22: 1317-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Inaddition, we recently reported that SV40-transformed human lung fibroblasts(SV40-WI38 cells) show a ∼5-fold higher fatty acid synthesis and a∼3-fold increased protein and activity levels of SCD with respect to theirparental normal WI38 cell line, and this results in an increased MUFA/SFAratio and a more fluid cell membrane environment(15Scaglia N. Caviglia J.M. Igal R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1687: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Because SV40-WI38 cellsdisplay enhanced phospholipid synthesis together with a fast replication rate(16Bagnato C. Igal R.A. J.Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52203-52211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar), the increased synthesisof MUFA in these cells may satisfy the high demand for this fatty acid speciesfor membrane lipid synthesis. We hypothesize that SCD, by modulating the relative levels of SFA and MUFA,is a primary regulator of essential events of lipid homeostasis, such asmembrane lipid synthesis and remodeling as well as buffering signaling and/ortoxic fatty acids. As such, low SCD activity would lead to reducedproliferation and/or increased cell death. To test this hypothesis, wedesigned a model of reduced SCD gene expression in human cells. To this end,we employed SV40-transformed human lung fibroblasts, because this cell linebears several biological and biochemical features that make these cells anadvantageous model to test the effects of SCD deficiency in lipid homeostasisas well as in cell proliferation, carcinogenesis, and programmed cell death asfollows: (i) SCD protein and activity levels are significantly up-regulated bySV40-transformation, leading to a high MUFA synthesis and content(15Scaglia N. Caviglia J.M. Igal R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1687: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar); (ii) As a human cellstrain, SV40-WI38 cells contains the main SCD isoenzyme present in humancells, if not the only active isoform(5Zhang L. Ge L. Parimoo S. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 340: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar,6Beiraghi S. Zhou M. Talmadge C.B. Went-Sumegi N. Davis J.R. Huang D. Saal H. Seemayer T.A. Sumegi J. Gene (Amst.). 2003; 309: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar,17Zhang L. Ge L. Tran T. Stenn K. Prouty S.M. Biochem. J. 2001; 357: 183-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), which may increase theunderstanding of SCD functions in cell physiology; (iii) Also, these humancells possess the advantage of a well known mechanism for transformation basedon the inactivation of p53 and Rb activities, a condition that is present inthe most frequent human cancers(18Hollstein M. Hergenhahn M. Yang Q. Bartsch H. Wang Z.Q. Hainaut P. Mutat. Res. 1999; 431: 199-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar,19Ortega S. Malumbres M. Barbacid M. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2002; 1602: 73-87PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, we show that the stable knockdown of SCD geneexpression by a cDNA antisense strategy in human neoplastic SV40-WI38 cellsdecreases both MUFA and phospholipid synthesis and promotes the accumulationof SFA-enriched unesterified fatty acids (FFAs) and TAG. Concomitantly, SCDdeficiency leads to a slower rate of cell proliferation, a loss ofanchorage-independent growth, and higher rate of ceramide-independentapoptosis. Furthermore, cells that express only low levels of SCD are moresensitive to the cytotoxic effects of exogenous palmitic acid. Because thebiological phenotype of SCD-deficient cells was not reversed by the additionof exogenous oleic acid, endogenously synthesized MUFA must be essential lipidmolecules to maintain cellular lipid homeostasis. We take this to suggest thatSCD action is important in the physiology of proliferating cells, even inconditions of normal supply of MUFA. Materials—SV40-transformed human lung fibroblasts(SV40-WI38) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas,VA). The human SCD cDNA fragment, corresponding to bp 278–2005 of thesequence (GenBank™, accession no. AF097514) was a kind gift of Dr.Stephen M. Prouty, R. W.

Stable SCD Knockdown in SV40-transformed Cells—The human SCDcDNA fragment was subcloned into a pcDNA3 vector in an antisense orientationinto EcoRI and HindIII restriction sites. The construct pcDNA3-hSCDas(for “human Stearoyl-CoADesaturase antisense” cDNA) wastransfected into SV40-WI38 cells using Lipofectamine™ reagent accordingto the manufacturer's instructions. Positively transfected cells were selectedwith 600 μg/ml Geneticin™ in culture medium for 14 days. Severalindividual cell colonies (hSCDas) were then isolated using cloningcylinders. Empty pcDNA3 vector was stably transfected into SV40-WI38 cells,and these cells were considered the control cell line. Immunoblotting—Western blot analysis was performed aspreviously described (15Scaglia N. Caviglia J.M. Igal R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1687: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).Polyclonal rabbit anti-SCD (1:500 dilution) or monoclonal mouseanti-β-actin (1:10000 dilution) were used as primary antibodies. Lipid Extraction—Cell monolayers were washed twice withice-cold PBS and scraped from the Petri dishes with two additions of 1 ml ofice-cold methanol. 1 ml of chloroform and 0.5 ml of distilled water were addedto complete the extraction as described by Bligh and Dyer(20Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can.J. Med. Sci. 1959; 37: 911-917Google Scholar). Determination of SCD Activity—Preconfluent hSCDasand control cells were incubated with trace amounts (2.3 μm) of[14C]stearic acid (0.25 μCi/dish) in culture medium containing0.5% BSA for 6 h. At the end of the incubation, total cell lipids wereextracted as described. Total cellular lipids were saponified, and releasedfatty acids were then esterified with boron trifluoride in methanol for 3 h at64 °C. The derivated methyl esters were separated by argentation TLCfollowing the procedure of Wilson and Sargent(21Wilson R. Sargent J.R. J.Chromatogr. A. 2001; 905: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar), using a solvent phaseconsisting of hexane:ethyl ether (90:10, by vol). Pure stearic acid and oleicacid standards were run in parallel to the samples. Fatty acid spots on TLCwere detected by radiometric scanning as well as by lipid staining with iodinevapors. Spots were scraped from the TLC plate and quantified with ascintillation counter. The level of [14C]oleic acid produced wascalculated from specific activity of [14C]stearic acid andnormalized to cellular protein content. Metabolic Labeling—Preconfluent cells were incubated for upto 24 h either with 0.25 μCi/dish [14C]oleic acid (2.1μm), 0.5 μCi/dish [14C]acetate (4.2μm), or 0.25 μCi/dish [14C]stearic acid (2.3μm), in 10% FBS MEM media supplemented with 0.5% BSA. At the endof each labeling period, the radioactive medium was recovered, and cellmonolayers were washed twice with 0.1% BSA in ice-cold PBS, to eliminateresidual label on the cell surface. Lipid extraction was carried out asdescribed. Lipid Quantification and Analysis—Analysis of mass andradioactivity of neutral and polar lipids species were carried out asdescribed by Bagnato and Igal(16Bagnato C. Igal R.A. J.Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52203-52211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutral andpolar lipids species were separated on silica gel 60 TLC plates usingone-dimensional single development procedures. Neutral lipid separation wascarried out with hexane:ethylether:acetic acid, 80:20:2 (by vol) as solventsystem. Polar lipid species were resolved in a solvent system consisting ofchloroform: methanol:ammonium hydroxide:water, 50:37.5:3.5:2 (by vol). Purelipid standards were seeded and run on the TLC plates in parallel to samples.For the 14C labeling experiments, individual lipid spots detectedby radiometric scanning were scraped into plastic vials, and radioactivitylevels were determined in a liquid scintillation counter. The amount of14C tracer incorporated in each lipid class was calculated from thespecific activity of each substrate and normalized to cellular proteincontent. For the analysis of fatty acid composition of phospholipids and TAG, lipidsspecies were resolved by TLC as stated above and scraped from chromatoplates,and fatty acid methyl esters from each lipid were obtained as described above.Methyl esters of fatty acids were analyzed by gas chromatography in a HewlettPackard HP6890 GC apparatus, fitted with a flame ionization detector, andequipped with an Omega-Wax 250 capillary column. Chromatographic peaks wereidentified by comparison of their retention times with those of pure fattyacid standards, and percent distribution was calculated. Quantification of TAGand FFA mass was performed using 20 μg of heptadecanoic acid as an internalstandard. Cell Proliferation—To determine the growth rate of controland hSCDas cell lines, 1.6 × 105 cells were seededin triplicate 60-mm Petri dishes. Twenty-four hours later, medium was replacedwith fresh medium. Medium was then changed every 2 days. At different times upto 144 h, cells were trypsinized and counted in a hemocytometer. At all timepoints, cell viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. [3H]Thymidine Incorporation into Cell DNA—Therate of DNA synthesis of both hSCDas and control cells was analyzedby determining the levels of [3H]thymidine-labeled DNA as describedby Bagnato and Igal (16Bagnato C. Igal R.A. J.Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52203-52211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Insome experiments, both groups of cells were incubated with 100μm oleate for 72 h before the incubation with[3H]thymidine. Colony Formation Assay—Control and hSCDas cellswere plated at 1 × 104 cells per 60-mm dishes inquadruplicate in MEM containing 10% FBS, in the presence or absence of 200μm oleate and 0.3% (w/v) agar plated onto a bottom layer of 0.6%(w/v) agar in MEM. After 4 weeks, the presence or absence of multicellularcolonies (more than eight cells) in both cell groups was observed under themicroscope. For macroscopic visualization, cell colonies were stained withethidium bromide in PBS for 2 h, and photographed under UV light. Apoptosis Analysis I: Fragmentation of [3H]Thymidine-labeledDNA—The determination of DNA fragmentation was performedessentially as described by Venable et al.(22Venable M.E. Lee J.Y. Smyth M.J. Bielawska A. Obeid L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 30701-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (379) Google Scholar). DNA samples frompreconfluent hSCDas cells and control cells were labeled with 0.4μCi of [3H]thymidine in regular growing medium for 24 h. Mediumwas removed, the cell monolayers were washed twice with PBS at 37 °C, andcells were incubated in serum-free medium with or without differentconcentrations of palmitic acid and/or oleic acid complexed to BSA (fattyacid/BSA ratio 2:1 or 5:1) for 24 h. Next, the chase medium containingdetached apoptotic cells was collected, and the [3H]radioactivitywas determined in a scintillation counter. Cell monolayers were lysed in PBSwith 1% Triton X-100 and 0.2 μm EDTA, collected, and sedimentedby centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. Radioactivity was quantified inthe supernatant, containing fragmented [3H]DNA, and in the pelletcontaining the intact cellular DNA, which was washed and resuspended in 1%Triton X-100 and 0.2 μm EDTA. The percentage of fragmented DNAwas estimated according to the following calculation: (chase mediumdisintegrations/min (dpm) plus supernatant dpm)/total dpm. Apoptosis Analysis II: Detection of NuclearFragmentation/Condensation by Fluorescence Microscopy—Thepresence of nuclear condensation or fragmentation during apoptosis wasexamined by Hoescht 33258 staining and fluorescence microscopy following theprocedure described by Kasai et al.(23Kasai T. Ohguchi K. Nakashima S. Ito Y. Naganawa T. Kondo N. Nozawa Y. J.Immunol. 1998; 161: 6469-6474PubMed Google Scholar). Apoptosis Analysis III: Determination of Caspase-3Activity—Control and hSCDas cells were grown in 60-mmdishes until 80–90% confluent. Cells were scraped from the dishes inice-cold PBS and pelleted by centrifugation. Next, cells were resuspended inice-cold 10 mm Tris-HCl buffer and disrupted by several cycles offreezing-thawing, followed by sonication in an ice-water bath. Caspase-3activity was assayed in cell homogenates using a CaspACE™ Assay System(Promega) according the manufacturer's instructions. Cells treated with 40μm etoposide were used as positive control for apoptosis(15Scaglia N. Caviglia J.M. Igal R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1687: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Apoptosis Analysis IV: Quantitation of Ceramide Levels—Todetermine the content of cellular ceramide, we performed a diacylglycerolkinase assay as described by Preiss et al.(24Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and modified by Lubertoand Hannun (25Luberto C. Hannun Y.A. J.Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14550-14559Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Ceramidecontent was normalized to cellular protein content. Determination of Cellular Protein—Total cellular proteincontent was measured as described by Lowry et al.(26Lowry O.R. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using BSA as astandard. Statistical Analysis—All experiments were performed intriplicate or quadruplicate unless otherwise stated. Results are presented asmeans ± S.D. and statistical significance of the data were determinedby Student's t test or analysis of variance. A Stable Reduction of SCD Levels Decreases the MUFA Content in CellLipids—We have previously reported that the oncogenictransformation of normal human fibroblast with SV40 enhances the expression ofSCD, leading to a significantly high MUFA/SFA ratio in cell membrane and amore fluid membrane environment(15Scaglia N. Caviglia J.M. Igal R.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2005; 1687: 141-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Unlike normalfibroblasts, SV40-transformed cells exhibit a neoplastic behavior invitro, showing a fast replication rate and loss of anchorageindependent-growth (16Bagnato C. Igal R.A. J.Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 52203-52211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Inthe present work, we examined whether SCD is relevant for sustaining thebiochemical and biological phenotype of transformed cells by generatingSV40-transformed cells deficient in SCD expression. For this purpose, severalclones of SCD-ablated cells were isolated from a pool of SV40-transformedfibroblasts stably transfected with a fragment of human SCD cDNA in antisenseorientation. Three clonal populations of antisense SCD cDNA-transfected cells,hSCDas-A, hSCDas-C, and hSCDas-F, were chosen forexperiments, because these clones exhibited the lowest SCD mRNA expression andenzyme activity. In these clones, SCD activity, measured by the conversion ofexogenous [14C]stearic acid to oleic acid, was significantlyreduced compared with mock-transfected cells, although to different extents(Fig. 1A). ThehSCDas-A clone showed the lowest SCD activity (∼70% decrease withrespect to control cells), followed by hSCDas-C and hSCDas-Fcells, in which SCD activity levels were reduced by 50 and 40%, respectively,compared with control cells. As expected, the lower SCD activity was caused bya reduction of SCD protein level in the hSCDas cells; in our Westernblot analysis of the SCD-ablated clone hSCDas-A, the content of SCDenzyme was decreased when compared with control levels(Fig. 1B). Theseobservations indicate that the stable transfection of antisense SCD cDNA intoSV40-transformed cells led to a depletion of SCD protein and a concomitantloss in Δ9-desaturating activity. Because the hSCDas-A clonalline exhibited the lowest SCD activity, this cell line was selected forperforming most of the experiments carried out in the present work. To determine whether the decrease in SCD activity was effectivelytranslated into a significant change in cellular fatty acid composition, thefatty acid profile of phospholipids was analyzed(Table IA). Asexpected, MUFA species were significantly diminished in hSCDas-Acells as compared with the controls. Palmitoleic acid (16:1n-7) wasreduced by 56%, whereas oleic acid (18: 1n-9) andcis-vaccenic acid (18:1n-7) decreased by 14 and 23%,respectively. Stearic acid (18:0) levels increased by 43% in the SCD-deficientcell line with respect to mock-transfected cells. However, total palmitic acidlevels were not different between the knockdown and control cells. Overall,the MUFA/SFA ratio, which indirectly expresses the rate ofΔ9-desaturation, was reduced by 32% in the hSCDas-A line whencompared with controls. Similarly, the ratio of MUFA/SFA in total lipidsextracted from the hSCDas-C clone was reduced by 19% with respect tocontrols (data not shown). This indicates that the decrease in SCD activity isparalleled by an equivalent reduction in the MUFA/SFA ratio of cellularlipids. When the fatty acid profile of the main polar lipid species,phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanol amine, was analyzed the changes inSFA and MUFA were similar to those seen in total phospholipids of theSCD-deficient hSCDas-A cell line(Table I, B andC).Table IDistribution of fatty acids in phospholipids from control andhSCDas-A cellsFatty acidControlhSCDas -A%A)16:023.51 ± 0.5924.45 ± 2.1816:1n-74.77 ± 0.202.10 ±0.17ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.18:013.21 ± 1.1819.00 ±1.23bp < 0.01, by Student's t test.18:1n-938.02 ± 0.6332.88 ±0.78ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.18:1n-711.25 ± 0.058.69 ±0.20ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.18:2n-64.38 ± 0.056.62 ±0.15ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.XcX, unidentified fatty acid.2.03 ± 0.082.46 ± 0.4220:4n-62.84 ± 0.073.80 ±0.22bp < 0.01, by Student's t test.16:1/16:00.20 ± 0.010.09 ±0.001ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.16:1 + 18:1n-7/16:00.68 ± 0.010.44 ±0.04ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.18:1n-9/18:02.90 ± 0.281.74 ±0.11bp < 0.01, by Student's t test.MUFA/SFA1.47 ± 0.061.01 ±0.04ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.B)16:1/16:00.17 ± 0.030.10 ±0.01ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.16:1 + 18:1n-7/16:00.41 ± 0.090.27 ±0.01bp < 0.01, by Student's t test.18:1n-9/18:03.62 ± 0.501.77 ±0.19ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.MUFA/SFA0.98 ± 0.160.67 ±0.03ap < 0.001, by Student's t test.C)16:1/16:00.23 ± 0.070.09 ±0.03bp < 0.01, by Student's t test.16:1 + 18:1n-7/16:00.48 ± 0.030.24 ±0.05ap < 0.001, by Studen"
https://openalex.org/W2119644217,"In mammals, the precise circadian timing of many biological processes depends on the generation of oscillations in neural activity of pacemaker cells in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The ionic mechanisms that underlie these rhythms are largely unknown. Using the mouse brain slice preparation, we show that the magnitude of fast delayed rectifier (FDR) potassium currents has a diurnal rhythm that peaks during the day. Notably, this rhythm continues in constant darkness, providing the first demonstration of the circadian regulation of an intrinsic voltage-gated current in mammalian cells. Blocking this current prevented the daily rhythm in firing rate in SCN neurons. Kv3.1b and Kv3.2 potassium channels were widely distributed within the SCN, with higher expression during the day. We conclude that the FDR is necessary for the circadian modulation of electrical activity in SCN neurons and represents an important part of the ionic basis for the generation of rhythmic output."

In the postgenomic era, the functional analysis of the proteins encoded in the genomes is the rate-limiting step in understanding cellular processes. Most approaches in use today do not target the protein of interest directly but prevent its synthesis, either by total gene knockout (e.g. by homologous recombination), by antisense technologies, or by RNA interference (RNAi) 1The abbreviations used are: RNAi, RNA interference; AR, ankyrin repeat; EPK, eukaryotic protein kinase; APH, aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (3′)-IIIa; IPTG, isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; MBP, maltose-binding protein; IMAC, immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography; RT, reverse transcription; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; BSA, bovine serum albumin; MIC, minimal inhibitory concentration.

Although these technologies have generated remarkable insights into some intracellular protein functions, they suffer from a number of limitations. Total gene knockouts are often difficult to achieve and might even be lethal to the studied organism. Furthermore, the effects can be compromised by compensating changes in the regulation of other genes. The effect of antisense technologies is often not very strong. In a number of cases, even an 80% reduction of mRNA has no effect on the phenotype caused by the protein (3Visintin M. Meli G.A. Cannistraci I. Cattaneo A. J. Immunol. Methods. 2004; 290: 135-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the interpretation of results obtained from RNAi can be complicated by the up-regulation of other genes, limitation in specificity, and induction of the interferon response (4Sledz C.A.

Finally, all methods that prevent the synthesis of the entire protein only allow the description of a loss-of-function phenotype. The use of molecules acting at the protein level is a complementary approach. This approach has the additional advantage that single functions, domains or posttranslational modifications of a protein may be targeted, without removing the whole protein. Inhibitors of proteins can also be used in subsequent studies of the target protein in vitro and might then even be used as first lead compounds in the drug discovery process or at least simulate the effect of a future small molecule drug.

Trends Biotechnol. 1999; 17: 115-121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar)) have been applied for in vivo protein inhibition. In most cases, it is rather difficult to obtain high-affinity peptides to a target protein due to their high flexibility and the resulting loss of peptide chain entropy upon binding, limiting the free energy of binding, and thus the generation of high-affinity antibody fragments to a given target has been pursued more often (11Hoogenboom H.R. Chames P. Immunol. Today. 2000; 21: 371-378Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the drawback of antibodies is that their functionality is compromised in the reducing environment inside the cell, since the stabilizing intramolecular disulfide bonds are not formed (12Biocca S. Ruberti F. Tafani M. Pierandrei-Amaldi P. Cattaneo A. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 1110-1115Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Whereas a number of antibody frameworks have been reported that are stable in the reducing environment (10Cattaneo A. Biocca S.

The solution to this problem is to use alternative binding proteins without disulfide bonds. Such alternative scaffolds have been developed (16Nord K. Gunneriusson E. Ringdahl J. Ståhl S. Uhlén M.

Abbatiello S. Rothgery L. Koide S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 1253-1258Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar); no intracellular inhibitors have been reported to date. We previously reported the generation of designed ankyrin repeat (AR) proteins as high-affinity binders with a great potential for intracellular applications (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A.

FEBS Lett. 2003; 539: 2-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Next to antibodies, repeat proteins are the most abundant class of binding molecules found in nature (22Andrade M.A. Perez-Iratxeta C. Ponting C.P. J. Struct. Biol. 2001; 134: 117-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (478) Google Scholar, 23Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar, 24Bork P. Proteins. 1993; 17: 363-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). They often act as intracellular enzyme modulators (e.g. as inhibitors of kinases) (25Chan F.K. Zhang J. Cheng L. Shapiro D.N. Winoto A. Mol. Cell Biol. 1995; 15: 2682-2688Crossref PubMed Scopus (338) Google Scholar). Unlike antibodies, AR proteins do not contain disulfide bonds and are found in all cellular compartments, mediating protein-protein interactions with affinities in the nanomolar to picomolar range. AR proteins are built of consecutive homologous repeats, which assemble to form elongated domains with a continuous hydrophobic core. The number of repeats found in natural AR proteins varies from 2 to over 30 (26Sedgwick S.G. Smerdon S.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 311-316Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 27Mosavi L.K. Cammett T.J. Desrosiers D.C. Peng Z. Protein Sci. 2004; 13: 1435-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (689) Google Scholar). We used this modular architecture to generate designed AR protein libraries. By structure and sequence consensus analyses, we engineered an AR module of 33 amino acids with fixed framework residues and randomized potential interaction residues (28Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). This module was used as building block to create combinatorial libraries of designed AR proteins of different repeat numbers (Fig. 1). Members of these libraries are very well expressed, monomeric in solution, highly soluble, and stable (28Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T. Forrer P. Amstutz P. Plückthun A. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 332: 489-503Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). By x-ray crystallography, the expected AR domain fold could be verified (29Kohl A. Binz H.K. Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Plückthun A. Grütter M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). Specific binders to maltose-binding protein (MBP) of Escherichia coli and two human mitogen-activated protein kinases (JNK2 and p38) have been selected with dissociation constants in the low nanomolar range (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Here, we report the first tailor-made enzyme inhibitors based on designed AR proteins. Using a combination of in vitro selection and in vivo screening, we isolated designed AR proteins that specifically bind and inhibit aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type (3′)-IIIa (APH). APH is a bacterial kinase conferring resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics (30Hon W.C. McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Sweet R.M. Yang D.S. Wright G.D. Berghuis A.M. Cell. 1997; 89: 887-895Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar) and can serve as a model system, since it shows structural homology to eukaryotic protein kinases (EPKs). We show that the selected AR proteins inhibit APH both in vitro and in vivo. Based on these results, the use of designed AR proteins as specific kinase inhibitors and as general intracellularly active tools is discussed. We describe elsewhere (31Kohl A. Amstutz P. Parizek P. Binz H.K. Briand C. Capitani C. Forrer P. Plückthun A. Grütter M.G. Structure. 2005; (in press)PubMed Google Scholar) the crystal structure of one selected APH-inhibiting AR protein in complex with APH and report the details of the inhibition mechanism of this particular inhibitor. Molecular Biology—Unless stated otherwise, all experiments were performed according to the protocols of Ref. 32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Handbook, 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, New York1989Google Scholar. Enzymes and buffers were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) or Fermentas (Vilnius, Lithuania). Oligonucleotides were from Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). Antigen Cloning and Production—The APH gene was amplified from the plasmid pETSACG1 (a kind gift from Prof. G. Wright (33Boehr D.D. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23929-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) with the oligonucleotides APHf (5′-GCCGGCCATGGGTACCGCTAAAATGAGAATA-3′) and APHr (5′-GCATAAGCTTTCATTAAAACAATTCATCCA-3′). The PCR product was purified (QIAquick; QIAgen, Hilden, Germany), cut with NcoI/HindIII, and ligated into pAT223 (GenBank™ accession number AY327138), which is a pQE30 (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) derivative, yielding pAT223_APH. The expression from this vector yields a fusion protein with an N-terminal avi tag for in vivo biotinylation, phage λ protein D (pD) as fusion protein, a His6 tag for immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC) purification, and APH as target molecule (avi-pD-His6-APH). Protein Production and Purification—The biotinylated proteins avi-pD-His6-APH and avi-pD-His6 were produced according to protocols from Avidity (Denver, CO) and QIAgen by in vivo biotinylation in E. coli XL1-Blue (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA), which was co-transformed with pBirAcm (Avidity) and pAT223 or pAT223_APH, respectively. Successful biotinylation of the IMAC purified proteins was confirmed by detection of the biotin tag on immobilized proteins using ELISA and blotting procedures with a streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Roche Applied Science) as detection reagent. Nonbiotinylated wild-type APH used for the in vitro kinetic assays was expressed from pETSACG1 (33Boehr D.D. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 23929-23936Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 34Thompson P.R. Hughes D.W. Wright G.D. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 747-755Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) in BL21 cells (Stratagene) and purified over a Q-Sepharose column (Amersham Biosciences), followed by gel filtration (Superdex 75; Amersham Biosciences) as described (35McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 6936-6944Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar) with some modifications (for details, see Supplemental Data). The correct size of APH was confirmed by SDS-PAGE, mass spectrometry, and multi-angle static light scattering. For protein production of the AR proteins, the corresponding genes were isolated from pQIA (see below) and inserted into pQE30 to avoid co-purification of APH at a later stage. The proteins were expressed and purified by IMAC as described (29Kohl A. Binz H.K. Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Plückthun A. Grütter M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). In Vitro Selection with Ribosome Display—The PCR-amplified N2C and N3C AR protein libraries (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) were transcribed, and selections were performed by ribosome display as described (36Hanes J. Plückthun A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4937-4942Crossref PubMed Scopus (907) Google Scholar) on avi-pD-His6-APH immobilized over its biotinylated avi tag (for details, see Supplemental Data). The number of total reverse transcription (RT)-PCR cycles after each selection round was reduced from round to round from 40 to 35 to 30, adjusting to the yield due to enrichment of binders. In Vivo Selection by Replica Plating—For the in vivo selection, the vector pQIA was constructed with β-lactamase and APH dicistronically arranged under the control of the β-lactamase promoter, as well as an expression cassette for AR proteins under the control of an IPTG-inducible T5-promoter (Fig. 3A). For details, see Supplemental Data. The pools of binders selected by ribosome display were cloned into pQIA using the restriction enzymes BamHI and HindIII, transformed into E. coli (XL1-Blue) and plated on LB agar plates, containing 1% glucose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, and 100 μm IPTG, and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The colonies were replica-plated on selective plates containing 1% glucose, 50 μg/ml ampicillin, 500 μg/ml kanamycin A, and 100 μm IPTG using Accutran replica plater devices (Schleicher & Schuell), incubated for 2 h at 4 °C and finally incubated overnight at 37 °C. Colonies whose replica failed to grow on the selective plates were taken up in LB and replica-spotted again on selective plates to make sure no false positives were selected due to incomplete replica plating. By this procedure, 198 kanamycin A-sensitive colonies were identified. All of these clones were ranked for their kanamycin A sensitivity by spotting them on selection plates with kanamycin A at concentrations of 50, 100, 250, and 500 μg/ml. The plasmids of the most potent inhibitors were isolated and sequenced using standard DNA sequencing. Determining the Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs)—Cultures of E. coli (XL1-Blue) harboring pQIA, encoding an AR protein, were grown in LB with 1% glucose and 50 μg/ml ampicillin (LB-Glc-ampicillin) at 37 °C overnight. The cultures were diluted 1:30 into 5 ml of the same medium and shaken at 37 °C until an A600 of 0.3 was reached. The cultures were then diluted 1:1000 (∼2.5 × 105 colony-forming units/ml) into deep well plates (Abgene, Epsom, Surrey, UK) containing 1 ml of the different selection media: LB-Glc-ampicillin-IPTG (100 μm) plus kanamycin A (0, 1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 150, 250, 500 or 1000 μg/ml) and as a control LB-Glc-ampicillin with 1000 μg/ml kanamycin A (without IPTG) and shaken at 37 °C for 24 h. Growth was monitored by following the A600. MIC end points were determined to be the concentrations of aminoglycoside antibiotic where no visible growth was obtained. Analytical Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel filtration experiments were done on a SMART system (Amersham Biosciences) using a Superdex 75 PC 3.2/30 column or a Superdex 200 PC 3.2/30 column (Amersham Biosciences) at 20 or 37 °C. The void volume was experimentally determined by using blue dextran. Samples of AR_1, AR_3a, and AR_B (20 μl) were loaded at a concentration of 25 μm on the Superdex 200 column and were run at 60 μl/min in TBS150, pH 7.5 (50 mm Tris HCl pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl), at 20 °C. Samples of APH and APH in complex with the AR protein AR_3a (20 μl) were loaded at a concentration of 10 μm on the Superdex 75 column and were run at 60 μl/min in HEPES200 (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 60 mm MgCl2) at 37 °C. Cytochrome c (12.4 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), bovine serum albumin (66 kDa), and β-amylase (200 kDa) were used as molecular mass standards. ELISA—To determine the specificity of the interaction between the selected AR proteins and APH, ELISA experiments were performed as described (13Wörn A. Plückthun A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 427: 357-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Biotinylated proteins (avi-pD-His6-APH, avi-pD-His6, avi-pD-JNK2-His6, and avi-pD-p38-His6, final concentration 100 nm) were immobilized in neutravidin-coated ELISA plates blocked with bovine serum albumin (BSA). AR proteins (200 nm) were added for 30 min, and subsequently, the plates were washed five times. A first antibody against the RGS-His6 tag of the AR protein (QIAgen; detects only the RGS-His6 tag of the AR protein but not the His6 tag of the antigen), followed by a secondary antibody/alkaline phosphatase conjugate (Pierce), was used for detection. After the addition of substrate (p-nitrophenylphosphate; Fluka) and incubation at 37 °C for 45 min, the A405 was measured in a plate reader. All incubation steps, including the antibody or AR protein incubations, were carried out in TBS150 with 0.5% BSA and 0.05% Tween 20, whereas washing was done with TBS150 containing only Tween 20. Surface Plasmon Resonance—SPR was measured using a BIAcore3000 instrument (BIAcore, Uppsala, Sweden) at 20 °C. The running buffer was 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.005% Tween 20. An SA chip (BIAcore) was used with 600 RU biotinylated avi-pD-His6-APH immobilized. The interactions were measured at a flow of 60 μl/min with 5-min buffer flow, 2-min injection of APH-binding AR protein in varying concentrations (1–200 nm), and an off-rate measurement of 40 min with buffer flow. The signal of an uncoated reference cell was subtracted from the measurements. The kinetic data of the interaction were evaluated using BIAevaluation 3.0 (BIAcore), and global fits were used to determine KD. The affinities of clones AR_3a and AR_3b were confirmed by competition BIAcore (Supplemental Data). In Vitro Inhibition Studies—APH activity assays were performed essentially as described (35McKay G.A. Thompson P.R. Wright G.D.

Briefly, the kinase buffer we used (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 160 mm NaCl, 40 mm KCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.025% BSA, 5 units of pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase, 2.5 mm phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.12 mg/ml NADH, 1 mm ATP) contains HEPES instead of Tris and additionally 160 mm NaCl, 0.025% BSA, and a lower concentration of NADH (0.12 instead of 0.5 mg/ml). APH was present at a concentration of 200 nm, whereas the AR proteins were present at 10 μm for the kanamycin A studies. This mixture (990 μl) was preincubated for 15 min, and the assay was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of kanamycin A solution (K4000; 10 μm final concentration; Sigma). Both the preincubation and the assay were carried out at 37 °C. For the studies with amikacin, both the preincubation and the assay were carried out at 20 °C in the presence of 2 μm AR proteins, and the reaction was started with 10 μl of amikacin solution (A1774; 740 μm final concentration; Sigma). The initial rates were normalized for background activity by subtracting the activity monitored in the absence of substrate. To identify APH inhibitors, we applied a two-step approach of in vitro selection and in vivo screening. First, we used ribosome display to select APH binders from highly diverse combinatorial AR protein libraries. The resulting pools of binders were subsequently screened for inhibitors by replica plating. As APH mediates bacterial resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, inhibitors of the enzyme give rise to a kanamycin-sensitive phenotype. Selection for APH Binders with Ribosome Display—The AR protein libraries used here (20Binz H.K. Amstutz P. Kohl A. Stumpp M.T. Briand C. Forrer P. Grütter M.G. Plückthun A. Nat. Biotechnol. 2004; 22: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar) were termed N2C and N3C. The digit describes the number of designed and randomized AR modules between the N- and C-terminal capping repeats in the library members (Fig. 1). Three rounds of ribosome display selection were carried out for both the N2C and the N3C AR protein libraries in parallel. Selections were performed using purified target protein. For this purpose, APH was expressed as a fusion to bacteriophage λ pD (37Forrer P. Jaussi R. Gene (Amst.). 1998; 224: 45-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) with an N-terminal avi tag for in vivo biotinylation (38Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar) and a His6 tag in the linker for IMAC purification (avi-pD-His6-APH). This target protein and the same construct without the kinase (avi-pD-His6) were expressed in soluble and biotinylated form in E. coli by using the expression plasmids pAT223_APH and pAT223, respectively. For ribosome-display selections, purified biotinylated APH was immobilized on neutravidin-coated wells blocked with BSA. To eliminate BSA-, neutravidin-, and avi-pD-His6-binding library members, a prepanning step on correspondingly immobilized avi-pD-His6 was applied, where neutravidin and BSA were also present. In the actual panning step, binders to APH were thus selected. The relative amounts of ribosomal complexes binding to the target protein can be estimated by monitoring the yield from RT-PCR on agarose gels. We observed a significant increase of RT-PCR yield when comparing the results from the first and the second selection round (Fig. 2). To our knowledge, such pronounced enrichment after only one round of ribosome display selection has not been reported for any kind of naive library (scFv, cDNA, or random sequence). This might indicate that AR protein libraries and ribosome display are a very favorable combination. In the third selection round, the selected pools of binders were analyzed for their specificity, comparing the RT-PCR yields after selection against APH or the unrelated MBP (Fig. 2). High specificity to APH could be monitored by comparing the agarose gel band intensities of these RT-PCR products (Fig. 2). In summary, we observed a rapid enrichment of binders and generated pools of specific binders in only three rounds of ribosome-display selection. Screening for APH Inhibitors by Replica Plating—The pools of specific binders were subjected to an in vivo screen, based on replica plating, to identify those APH-binding AR proteins that are also inhibitors. For this purpose, the selected pools of binders were cloned into the selection vector pQIA (Fig. 3A). This vector carries an expression cassette for the selected APH binders under the control of an IPTG-inducible T5 promoter. pQIA also carries β-lactamase and APH as dicistronic genes under the control of the constitutively active β-lactamase promoter. Hence, this vector confers antibiotic resistance to ampicillin and kanamycin, of which the kanamycin resistance can be reverted, if an APH-inhibiting AR protein is expressed upon IPTG induction (Fig. 3A). As a control, we tested E. coli transformed with a pQIA variant harboring the unselected AR protein E3_5 (29Kohl A. Binz H.K. Forrer P. Stumpp M.T. Plückthun A. Grütter M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 1700-1705Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) in the expression cassette. These cells were able to grow on plates with kanamycin A at concentrations of >1000 μg/ml, regardless of the presence of IPTG. The pools of binders were cloned into pQIA and plated under nonselective conditions (ampicillin, IPTG, no kanamycin A). About 1000 colonies from the N3C pool and 2000 colonies from the N2C pool were subsequently replica-plated under selective conditions (ampicillin, IPTG, kanamycin A (500 μg/ml)). By this procedure, 129 N3C and 69 N2C clones were identified that showed a kanamycin-sensitive phenotype. The identified clones were ranked for their in vivo inhibition efficiency by spotting them on selective plates with different kanamycin A concentrations, ranging from 10 to 500 μg/ml, and the most potent clones were sequenced. The sequencing revealed that variants of one potent inhibitor (AR_3 family) dominated the N3C inhibitor population, but also other sequences had been selected. Four different APH inhibitors (named AR_1, AR_2, AR_3a, and AR_3b), with different in vivo performances, were chosen for further characterization (for sequences see Supplemental Data). Whereas AR_1 was selected from the N2C library, AR_2, AR_3a, and AR_3b came from the N3C library. AR_3a and AR_3b differ by three point mutations at the DNA level, causing two amino acid mutations. We also studied the properties of clone AR_B, an N2C molecule that binds APH but fails to inhibit the target enzyme. As a further control, the unselected AR protein E3_5 (28Binz H.K. Stumpp M.T.

The characterization of these AR proteins included expression tests, determination of minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs), ELISA, BIAcore, and gel filtration studies as well as in vitro enzyme inhibition experiments. In Vivo Performance (MIC)—The MICs of kanamycin A necessary to inhibit cell growth in liquid culture experiments were determined for the selected AR proteins. The plasmid pQIA with the nonbinding control AR protein E3_5 as insert mediated resistance to kanamycin A (MIC > 1000 μg/ml) regardless of the presence of IPTG, showing that the expression of an AR protein per se has neither an influence on kanamycin A resistance nor on bacterial growth. Clone AR_B showed the same phenotype as E3_5 (Fig. 3B). All AR proteins conferring kanamycin A sensitivity did not influence E. coli growth by themselves, even when in"

When combined with proteome studies, metabolite-profiling analyses revealed unanticipated insights into the yeast sulfur pathway. In response to cadmium, the observed overproduction of glutathione, essential for the detoxification of the metal, can be entirely accounted for by a marked drop in sulfur-containing protein synthesis and a redirection of sulfur metabolite fluxes to the glutathione pathway. A kinetic analysis showed sequential and dramatic changes in intermediate sulfur metabolite pools within the first hours of the treatment. Strikingly, whereas proteome and metabolic data were positively correlated under cadmium conditions, proteome and metabolic data were negatively correlated during other growth conditions, i.e. methionine supplementation or sulfate starvation. These differences can be explained by alternative mechanisms in the regulation of Met4, the activator of the sulfur pathway. Whereas Met4 activity is controlled by the cellular cysteine content in response to sulfur source and availability, the present study suggests that Met4 activation under cadmium conditions is cysteine-independent. The results clearly indicate that the metabolic state of a cell cannot be safely predicted based solely on proteomic and/or gene expression data.

Combined metabolome and proteome studies are necessary to draw a comprehensive and integrated view of cell metabolism. Assimilable sulfur is essential for all living organisms. The cell requirement for sulfur can be fulfilled by the uptake of sulfur-containing amino acids or by assimilation of inorganic sulfur into organic compounds such as cysteine or homocysteine (1Paszewski A. Recent Research Developments in Microbiology. Research Signpost, Kerala, India2001: 223-234Google Scholar, 2Saito K. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2443-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). In yeast, homocysteine is the precursor of methionine through the methyl cycle and of cysteine through the transsulfuration pathway (Fig. 1) (3Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). Cysteine is the sensor of the metabolic state in the sulfur amino acid pathway (4Hansen J. Johannesen P.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar) and is required for the synthesis of GSH, an essential antioxidant molecule also important for detoxification. The yeast sulfur pathway has been extensively investigated at the genetic, enzymatic, and regulatory levels (3Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The pools of most metabolites of the pathway have been analyzed (5Elskens M.T. Jaspers C.J. Penninckx M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 6Ferro A.J. Spence K.D. J. Bacteriol. 1973; 116: 812-817Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and the Km values of many enzymes have been measured (3Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). However, some metabolic data such as the metabolite fluxes in the pathway and the concentration of the metabolites of the transsulfuration pathway (homocysteine and cystathionine) are lacking. Moreover, the levels of some sulfur metabolites are presumed to be modified in different mutants and under different physiological conditions (i.e. sulfur starvation, the presence of a sulfur metabolite, or a toxic metal in the medium), but the few quantitative data that are available are restricted to a small part of the pathway (5Elskens M.T. Jaspers C.J. Penninckx M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). Thus, it has been shown that cadmium (Cd2+) strongly increases GSH synthesis (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), which is consistent with the primary importance of this metabolite in the Cd2+ detoxification process (8Li Z.S. Lu Y.P. Zhen R.G. Szczypka M. Thiele D.J. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 42-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar), but the metabolic changes leading to GSH accumulation remain unknown. The γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase (Gsh1) 1The abbreviation used is: Gsh1, γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase. is considered as the rate-limiting enzyme of the GSH pathway since the homologous mammalian enzyme is inhibited in vitro by high levels of GSH (9Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the end product of the pathway. Accordingly, previous work supports this notion in yeast (10Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), but no definitive proof has been provided, and this question remains opened. Generally, studies based on proteomic and gene expression profiling are interpreted in terms of cell metabolism, assuming a trivial link between protein expression and metabolic states, but few combined transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome studies (2Saito K. Plant Physiol. 2004; 136: 2443-2450Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 11ter Kuile B.H. Westerhoff H.V. FEBS Lett. 2001; 500: 169-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 12Coen M.

The present study is intended to address the question of the correlation of metabolic data with the wealth of proteomic, genomic, and regulatory data currently available on one of the best investigated metabolic pathways. With the availability of complete and precise metabolic data, combined with genetic, enzymatic, and proteomic data, it is conceivable to model the sulfur pathway in further studies, thus providing an interesting first step in ambitious projects aiming at modeling the whole cell metabolism. We recently developed a new method based on liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry allowing the quantitative analysis of metabolomes by using 15N metabolic labeling of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (15Lafaye A. Labarre J. Tabet J.C. Ezan E. Junot C. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Remarkably, when applied to the yeast sulfur metabolic pathway and combined with proteomic analysis, it revealed novel and unanticipated insights into the regulation of this pathway. In particular, we found that the data from proteome and metabolite profiling can be either positively or negatively correlated, depending on growth conditions. Reagents—Homocysteine, methionine, cadmium chloride, and sulfide were from Sigma. Acetonitrile was from SDS (Peypin, France). [15N]ammonium sulfate was from Eurisotop (Gif-sur-Yvette, France). Methanol, perchloric acid, trichloroacetic acid, and formic acid were from Merck. Water was deionized and filtered through a Millipore Milli-Q water purification system. Strains and Growth Conditions—S. cerevisiae strain S288c (MATα SUC2 mal mel gal2 CUP1) was grown at 30 °C in a minimum medium corresponding to yeast nitrogen base medium modified for sulfate concentration (1 mm) and for ammonium concentration (20 mm). In these growth conditions, the generation time is 2 h. For supplementation experiments, mid-log cultures (A600 = 0.4) were supplemented with methionine (0.5 mm), sulfite (0.5 mm), sulfide (0.5 mm), or homocysteine (0.5 mm) and collected after 3 h, 30 min for metabolite extraction. Concerning cadmium treatments, cells were treated with 50 μm Cd2+ and collected at the indicated times (0 h; 0 h, 30 min; 1 h, 10 min; 2 h; 3 h, 10 min; 4 h, 20 min; 6 h; 16 h; and 24 h) for extraction of metabolites. For sulfur starvation conditions, cells were grown for more than 10 generations with 50 μm sulfate instead of 1 mm and collected when growth was considerably slowed down (generation time greater than 10 h). For oxidative stress conditions, cells were treated with 0.6 mm H2O2 and collected after 40 min. Proteome Analysis—Yeast cells were grown and treated with 50 μm Cd2+ or 0.5 mm methionine as described above. After 3 h of treatment, cells were labeled for 1 h with 100 μCi of [35S]methionine. For sulfur starvation conditions, cells were grown for more than 10 generations with 50 μm sulfate and labeled for 1 h with 100 μCi [35S]methionine. Protein extraction, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and gel analysis were performed as described previously (16Vido K. Spector D. Lagniel G. Lopez S. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). 15N Labeling—For 15N labeling, S288c strain was grown for 25 generations with 20 mm [15N]ammonium sulfate (isotopic purity: 99.8%) instead of 20 mm [14N]ammonium sulfate. The culture was then treated with 50 μm Cd2+ for 2 h to induce the synthesis of all metabolites of the sulfur pathway. The 15N-labeled metabolites were extracted as described below. Metabolite Extraction—15N-labeled cells were collected by centrifugation (4000 rpm), washed with cold water, boiled for 5 min in 0.1% perchloric acid (pH ranging from 2 to 2.5 in the extract), and centrifuged for 2 min at 4000 rpm. Unlabeled extracts were prepared in the same way. An aliquot of the unlabeled extract to be analyzed was mixed with an aliquot of the 15N-labeled reference extract. Methanol was added to the extract mixture (3/1, v/v) and centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 × g to precipitate proteins. The methanol was then evaporated under nitrogen, and the resulting aqueous fraction of the sample was injected into the chromatographic system. The stability of sulfur metabolites was assessed in storage (-80 °C) and experimental conditions. Liquid Chromatography-Tandem Mass Spectrometry—The system consisted of an Alliance HT model 2795 separation module (Waters, Saint Quentin en Yvelines, France) coupled to a Quattro-Micro mass spectrometer fitted with an electrospray source (Waters) and operating with Masslynx software 4.0 (Micromass, Waters). Chromatographic separations were performed on a TSK-Gel Amide 80 column (150 × 2 mm, 5 μm) (Interchim, Montluçon, France), as described previously (15Lafaye A. Labarre J. Tabet J.C. Ezan E. Junot C. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Intracellular Concentration of Metabolites—The average diameter of S288c cells (4.4 μm) was determined by microscopic measurement of 100 different cells in the considered growth condition. The average diameter did not change significantly with culture conditions tested. Assuming that yeast cells are spherical, the intracellular volume of 107 cells was calculated to be 4.5 × 10-7 liters. Intracellular concentrations were expressed in mol/liter. Measurement of Protein Synthesis Rate and of Sulfur Metabolite Synthesis Rate—Exponentially growing cells (A600 = 0.4) in minimum medium were treated with 50 μm Cd2+. At different times (0 min, 20 min, 50 min, 110 min, 170 min and 230 min), 4-ml aliquots were removed and labeled with [35S]sulfate (200 μCi) for 20 min. Cells were collected, washed twice with cold water, and resuspended in 50 μl of cold water. 35S incorporation in cells was measured by scintillation counting. Metabolites were extracted by boiling the cells for 5 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant containing the metabolites was counted. The proteins in the pellet were precipitated with 30% trichloroacetic acid, washed with acetone, resuspended in 50 μl of 1 m sodium carbonate, and counted. Values were standardized to a cell concentration of 2 × 108 cells/ml. Determination of the Flux in the Glutathione Pathway—Mid-log phase cultures (2 ml, A600 = 0.4) were supplemented with 0 or 50 μm Cd2+. After 1 h, cells were labeled with 35 SO42−(1 mCi). After 4 h, 35S-labeled cells (1 ml) were harvested, washed in 200 ml of cold water, and resuspended in 50 ml of cold water. The metabolites were extracted and separated by thin layer chromatography as described previously (16Vido K. Spector D. Lagniel G. Lopez S. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). The 35S-labeled metabolites, GSH, cystathionine, and γ-Glu-Cys were quantified by PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences) as described previously (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Pools of Sulfur Metabolites under Standard Growth Conditions—Due to their high polarity, sulfur metabolites were analyzed on a liquid chromatographic system based on “hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography,” which is suitable for electrospray mass spectrometric detection (17Strege M.A. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 2439-2445Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar, 18Tolstikov V.V. Fiehn O. Anal. Biochem. 2002; 301: 298-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). To limit matrix interferences that may lead to imprecise quantifications in the liquid chromatography-electrospray-mass spectrometry analysis (19Tang L. Kebarle P. Anal. Chem. 1993; 65: 3654-3668Crossref Scopus (500) Google Scholar, 20Gangl E.T. Annan M.M. Spooner N. Vouros P. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5635-5644Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), we used as internal standards the uniformly 15N-labeled metabolites naturally present in a cell extract from a yeast culture grown on a medium 99.8% enriched in [15N]ammonium sulfate (21Oda Y. Huang K. Cross F.R. Cowburn D. Chait B.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6591-6596Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar). The principle of the analysis consists of mixing the 14N extract of interest with an aliquot of the 15N reference extract before injection and separation of the metabolites on the liquid chromatography column. The 14N/15N ratio can then be measured by mass spectrometry analysis for each metabolite, and absolute levels of 14N metabolites are deduced by comparison with calibration curves (Fig. 2). This method allows an absolute and precise quantitation of nitrogen-containing metabolites (15Lafaye A. Labarre J. Tabet J.C. Ezan E. Junot C. Anal. Chem. 2005; 77: 2026-2033Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Table I displays the levels of sulfur metabolites in extracts from cells grown under standard conditions. The intracellular concentrations of most sulfur metabolites were in the range 30–80 μM except for homocysteine (<4 μM), methionine (close to 0.5 mM), and GSH (∼2 mM). The variation of metabolite content for four different cultures of strain S288c did not exceed 25% of the mean value. Note that the intracellular concentrations of most sulfur metabolites is far below the Km of the relevant enzymes of the pathway (Table I), indicating that, in standard conditions, the enzymes of the Cys/GSH pathway are not saturated.Table IEndogenous levels of sulfur metabolites in yeast grown in minimum medium and Km of relevant enzymes of the sulfur amino acid pathwaySulfur metaboliteEndogenous levelaValues are means of four determinations from different cultures of strain S288c (± standard deviation)Km of relevant enzymesbMost of the Km values were obtained from Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan (3)μmμmCysteine77 ± 16Gsh1 (200)cThe average Km value obtained for Escherichia coli K12 enzyme (100 μm), E. coli Km enzyme (200 μm), and rat kidney enzyme (300 μm) is indicated since no Km data are available for yeastHomocysteine<4Cys4 (2000), Met6 (20)Methionine565 ± 72Sam1 (110), Sam2 (140)Cystathionine59 ± 14Cys3 (250)γ-Glutamyl-cysteine83 ± 19Gsh2 (ND)dND, no dataS-Ado-HCyseS-Ado-HCys, S-adenosyl-homocysteine33 ± 4Sah1 (ND)Total glutathione1883 ± 318Ycfl (15,000), γ-GT (18,000)a Values are means of four determinations from different cultures of strain S288c (± standard deviation)b Most of the Km values were obtained from Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan (3Thomas D.

The addition of precursor sulfur metabolites methionine, homo-cysteine, or sulfide to the sulfate-based medium significantly increased all sulfur metabolite pools (Fig. 3 and not shown for sulfide supplementation). The strong increase in the end product (GSH) pool indicates that the metabolic flux in the pathway was also augmented in each case. Thus, increasing the pool of precursors is sufficient to increase the flux and the level of all intermediate metabolites in the Cys/GSH pathway. These results are consistent with the fact that, under standard conditions, there is no saturating enzyme in the Cys/GSH pathway. We also tested sulfur starvation conditions and found a general drop in all sulfur metabolite pools (Fig. 4), particularly GSH. The dramatic decrease of the content of this abundant sulfur metabolite supports the notion that it can act as a sulfur reserve (5Elskens M.T. Jaspers C.J. Penninckx M.J. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1991; 137: 637-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) in addition to its other functions in the cell (22Penninckx M. Enzyme Microb. Technol. 2000; 26: 737-742Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). When cells were treated with cadmium (50 μM, 3 h), a strong increase in all the metabolites of the sulfur pathway (except for methionine) was observed (data not shown), confirming and extending previous results (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Finally, during oxidative stress conditions (0.6 mM H2O2), no modification of sulfur metabolite content was detected (not shown). Together, these analyses showed a high range of variation in metabolite concentration depending upon physiological growth conditions (up to 200-fold). They also indicated a correlation between the flux in the Cys/GSH pathway and the content of intermediate metabolites in the pathway.Fig. 4Sulfur metabolite pools decrease under sulfur starvation conditions.

As shown in Fig. 5, there was a rapid increase of homocysteine, S-adenosyl-homocysteine, and cystathionine peaking 2 h after cadmium addition followed by a wave of cysteine and γ-glutamyl-cysteine peaking at 3/4 h. The GSH pool increased regularly from the beginning of the treatment to a maximum at 5 h (15 mM) and then stabilized. After about 10 h, each pool reached a stable and constant value, indicating the establishment of a steady state at later times and representing an equilibrium between the synthesis and metabolization of the different metabolites. The transient increase of some metabolite pools could correspond to the transition from the standard metabolic state to the new steady state of slow growth in the presence of cadmium. The only metabolite that did not increase in response to the metal was methionine, the levels of which decreased continuously to less than 1/10 of its initial level after 16 h. Estimation of Sulfur Fluxes in Response to Cadmium—Data concerning metabolite pools are generally not sufficient to predict the flux in the corresponding pathway. To address this issue, we estimated the flux of sulfur metabolites in the first part of the sulfate assimilation pathway by measuring [35S]sulfate uptake in response to cadmium. As shown in Fig. 6A, sulfate transport was not significantly modified by the treatment. In this experiment, we also estimated the sulfur incorporated into proteins and the various metabolites and found that the protein synthesis rate dropped rapidly after cadmium addition concomitantly with the increase in sulfur metabolite synthesis. This experiment and a previous one (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) also based on [35S]sulfate labeling allowed us to estimate the balance of sulfur utilization. In standard conditions, the flux F in the sulfate assimilation pathway is divided between the methionine cycle (0.6 F) and the Cys/GSH pathway (0.4 F) (Fig. 6B). In response to cadmium, the total sulfate assimilation flux is not significantly changed (F), but the proportions of sulfur entering the methionine cycle (0.2 F) and the Cys/GSH pathway (0.8 F) are strongly modified (Fig. 6C). Protein and Metabolite Levels Can Be Positively or Negatively Correlated Depending on Growth Conditions—When interpreting proteomic and gene expression data, it is usually considered that induction of enzymes in a metabolic pathway indicates an increased flux in the pathway. Consistently, the analysis of the yeast cadmium response confirmed a clear correlation between the induction of enzymes involved in the GSH pathway and the increased GSH production (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Vido K. Spector D. Lagniel G. Lopez S. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Thus, this result may suggest that the assumed correlation between proteome and metabolic data can be effectively considered as a general rule. However, the sulfur metabolite analysis of sulfur starvation and methionine supplementation conditions revealed that proteome and metabolic data can also be negatively correlated. As shown in Fig. 7, enzymes involved in sulfur metabolism visible on two-dimensional gels were all found to be repressed upon methionine supplementation (compare Fig. 7, A and B, for Met25, Met6, Cys3, Cys4, and not shown for Met16, Sam1, and Sam2), whereas the sulfur metabolite levels and flux were strongly increased in the pathway (Fig. 3). Conversely, sulfur starvation conditions induced the overexpression of Met25, Met16, and Cys3 (Fig. 7D), and no significant change in the expression of the other enzymes was seen. In this case, metabolite levels and pathway flux were reduced (Fig. 4) despite the strong induction of some important enzymes of the pathway. In these two growth conditions, proteome and metabolic data were thus negatively correlated. Although these observations may be rather surprising at first view, these negative correlations are not in contradiction with the properties of classical enzymes. Considering a Michaelis-Menten type enzyme, if the substrate concentration (S) is markedly lower than its Km (as is the case for most enzymes of the sulfur pathway), the rate of the enzyme reaction (V) can be approximated by the following formula: V = K × E × S, where E is the enzyme concentration. Thus, a strong increase of the substrate concentration (as in the case of methionine supplementation) would lead to an increase of the reaction rate even if the corresponding enzyme is repressed. If this reasoning is valid for all enzymes of the pathway, the global flux in the pathway would increase. Metabolomics, i.e. the global analysis of cellular metabolites, is becoming a powerful new tool for functional proteomics and for gaining insights into biological functions. Analyzing a large number of metabolites in biological medium and tracking their concentration changes under various physiological and genetic conditions should provide direct information on metabolic phenotypes complementary to gene expression and proteomic data (23Nicholson J.K. Connelly J. Lindon J.C. Holmes E. Nat. Rev. Drug Discov. 2002; 1: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1751) Google Scholar, 24Weckwerth W. Annu. Rev. Plant Biol. 2003; 54: 669-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (528) Google Scholar, 25Fiehn O. Plant Mol. Biol. 2002; 48: 155-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (3149) Google Scholar). This work shows that although the well defined sulfur metabolic pathway has already been extensively analyzed by genetics, biochemical, and mRNA profiling studies, the metabolite profiling approach provides unanticipated insights into the regulation of the pathway, confirming its crucial importance for a complete and integrated description of cell metabolism. This approach revealed essentially four main insights: 1) the overproduction of glutathione in response to cadmium can be entirely accounted for by a marked drop in sulfur-containing protein synthesis and a redirection of sulfur metabolite fluxes; 2) under cadmium conditions, Met4 is activated through a cysteine-independent mechanism; 3) under standard conditions, the γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase is not the rate-limiting enzyme of the glutathione pathway; and 4) proteome and metabolic data can be negatively correlated in certain growth conditions. Our proteomic analyses of the cadmium response (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 16Vido K. Spector D. Lagniel G. Lopez S. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar) showed a strong induction of enzymes of the sulfur pathway concomitant with a saving of sulfur in the global proteome (i.e. sulfur-rich enzymes of glycolysis replaced by sulfur-depleted isoenzymes). These proteomic data were thus consistent with the idea that a strong increase of GSH synthesis is further enhanced by the increased availability of the sulfur amino acids not incorporated into protein. Our previous proteome data, when combined with the present metabolite profiling study, allow a precise description, in three steps, of the metabolic change leading to GSH accumulation. A Decrease in Sulfur Utilization for Protein Synthesis—The proteins synthesized under cadmium conditions have a 30% reduced sulfur amino acid content when compared with proteins expressed under standard conditions (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). This sulfur sparing in proteins combined with a drop in global protein synthesis upon cadmium treatment results in a strong and rapid decrease in sulfur amino acid incorporation into proteins (a 3-fold decrease for cells treated with 50 μM Cd2+ as seen in Fig. 6A), providing more sulfur (or homocysteine) for GSH synthesis. The drop in protein synthesis does not seem to be related to methionine and cysteine availability since the cysteine pool increases and the methionine content only slightly decreases during the first hours of cadmium treatment. The signaling pathway controlling this rapid drop in protein synthesis remains to be identified. The Increased Homocysteine Pool Redirects the Sulfur Flux to the GSH Pathway—Cadmium treatment does not modify the rate of sulfur uptake. At the homocysteine step, the flux is divided between the methyl cycle (through Met6 or Mht1 and Sam4 (26Thomas D. Becker A. Surdin-Kerjan Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40718-40724Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar)) for methionine synthesis and the Cys/GSH pathway (through Cys4). The dramatic increase in homocysteine concentration (from less than 4 μM to 100 μM) is probably due to the decreased utilization of methionine in proteins and to the recycling of homocysteine at the end of the methyl cycle (Fig. 1). Finally, the only outlet for homocysteine is its redirection to the Cys/GSH pathway. Neosynthesis of Enzymes of the Sulfur Pathway—A previous analysis showed a strong induction of the synthesis of enzymes of the sulfur pathway upon cadmium treatment (16Vido K. Spector D. Lagniel G. Lopez S. Toledano M.B. Labarre J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8469-8474Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (325) Google Scholar). Two-dimensional gel analyses and Coomassie Blue staining quantitation of the protein spots showed an increase in Met25, Cys4, and Cys3 by a factor of 1.5, 1.9, and 3.9, respectively, after a 4-h treatment (data not shown). The increased amount of these enzymes (particularly significant in the case of Cys3) may contribute to increasing the flux if one or some of these enzymes are limiting in the pathway under these growth conditions. In particular, 2 h after cadmium addition, the cystathionine pool reached values (1.5 mM) much higher than the Km of Cys3 (0.25 mM), indicating that Cys3 activity has reached its Vmax value and that the enzyme may not be abundant enough during the first 2 h to metabolize the increasing pool of cystathionine. The strong increase in the amount of Cys3 would then allow efficient metabolization of the precursor after 2 h and the subsequent decrease in homocysteine and cystathionine contents. Previous genetic analysis demonstrated that the strong repression observed after methionine addition (3Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar) is mediated by cysteine (4Hansen J. Johannesen P.F. Mol. Gen. Genet. 2000; 263: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), suggesting that methionine is converted into cysteine and that elevated intracellular cysteine concentrations repress the pathway. The metabolic data presented here, i.e. the increase in cysteine pool upon methionine addition, support this notion. Also consistent with pathway activation being controlled by the level of the cysteine pool is the fact that under conditions of sulfur starvation (low level of cysteine), the genes of the sulfur pathway are induced (27Boer V.M. de Winde J.H. Pronk J.T. Piper M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 3265-3274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). However, in the presence of cadmium, the genes and enzymes of the sulfur pathway are highly induced (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), although we found here that the cysteine content is also strongly increased. This observation suggests that in the presence of cadmium, the sulfur pathway is not repressed by cysteine or that this repression is overcome by another activation pathway. This putative pathway would activate the transcriptional activator Met4 since all the genes of the sulfur amino acid pathway are induced by cadmium in a Met4-dependent way (7Fauchon M. Lagniel G. Aude J.C. Lombardia L. Soularue P. Petat C. Marguerie G. Sentenac A. Werner M. Labarre J. Mol. Cell. 2002; 9: 713-723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Consistent with our data, recent work showed that Met4, which is normally inactivated following methionine supplementation (through the increased pool of cysteine), remains active when methionine-supplemented cells are treated with cadmium (28Barbey R. Baudouin-Cornu P. Lee T.A. Rouillon A. Zarzov P. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 29Yen J.L. Su N.Y. Kaiser P. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2005; 16: 1872-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Under cadmium conditions, Met4 is stabilized as a result of the dissociation of the Skp1-Met-30 interaction in the SCFMet30 ubiquitin ligase complex (28Barbey R. Baudouin-Cornu P. Lee T.A. Rouillon A. Zarzov P. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 521-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) that targets the ubiquitylation and the degradation of Met-4 upon methionine addition (30Rouillon A. Barbey R. Patton E.E. Tyers M. Thomas D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 282-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Our data indicate that, under standard conditions, there is no limiting enzyme in the cysteine/glutathione pathway. This conclusion is based on the fact that the addition of a precursor metabolite to the medium (sulfide, homocysteine, or methionine) is sufficient to strongly increase the flux in the pathway, although the levels of the corresponding enzymes are not increased in these conditions (not shown and Fig. 7). According to these results, the limiting step (if any) would more likely be the first part of the sulfur pathway, i.e. the sulfate assimilation/reduction pathway. Intriguingly, it is commonly accepted that the limiting enzyme of the cysteine/glutathione pathway is the γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase Gsh1. This assumption is based on the fact that the homologous mammalian enzyme is inhibited in vitro by a high level of GSH, the end product of the pathway (9Richman P.G. Meister A. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 1422-1426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Consistent with this hypothesis, strains overexpressing Gsh1 present a significant increase in GSH content (10Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). However, this increase may also be interpreted as the consequence of the regulation of Met4 activity. As the γ-glutamyl-cysteine synthetase activity is strongly augmented in this strain (10Grant C.M. MacIver F.H. Dawes I.W. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1997; 8: 1699-1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the pool of cysteine, the precursor metabolite of Gsh1, is expected to be reduced, leading to a significant derepression of the sulfur assimilation pathway and an increased flux in the pathway. Further analyses will be necessary to identify unambiguously the rate-limiting step of the pathway. A striking result of this work is the observation that the proteome and the metabolome of the sulfur pathway can be positively correlated under some conditions (i.e. cadmium) and negatively correlated under other conditions; when cells were starved for sulfate, the metabolite level and the flux were reduced in the sulfur pathway, whereas the corresponding enzymes were induced. Conversely, methionine supplementation enhanced the flux and metabolite pools in the pathway, whereas the enzymes were strongly repressed. These counter-intuitive results can in fact be interpreted simply as the consequence of cysteine-mediated repression; increased (or decreased) flux in the GSH pathway increases (decreases) the level of cysteine, which in turn represses (induces) the enzymes of the pathway. According to this simple logic, the negative correlation between data from proteome and metabolite profiling might appear to be the rule in this pathway. Interestingly, the positive correlation observed for cadmium response is thus an exception to this rule since the cysteine-mediated repression seems absent in the presence of cadmium as shown above. Altogether, these data emphasize the necessity to carefully confirm predictions regarding cellular metabolism inferred from gene expression data. They also show the essential contribution of metabolite-profiling analysis to the interpretation of proteomic data, thus underscoring the complementarity of the two approaches. Cell metabolic regulations are multiple and intricate. Metabolite levels are regulated by changes in enzyme expression and activity. In turn, these processes are regulated by metabolite levels, and these reciprocal regulations feed intricate networks for the maintenance of the cellular metabolic balance. In this context, the present study shows the essential contribution of metabolome analyses to the interpretation of the data provided by proteomics and transcriptomics as well as genetic and bio-chemical approaches, thus drawing an integrated view of cell physiology.

https://openalex.org/W2034125855,"The present study was designed to identify novel membrane proteins that signal during platelet aggregation. Because one putative mechanism for signaling by a membrane protein involves phosphorylation, we used oligonucleotide-based microarray analyses and mass spectrometric proteomics techniques to specifically discover membrane proteins and also identify those proteins that become phosphorylated on tyrosine, threonine, or serine residues upon platelet aggregation. Surprisingly, both techniques converged to identify a novel membrane protein we have termed PEAR1 (platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1). Sequence analysis of PEAR1 predicts a type-1 membrane protein, 15 extracellular epidermal growth factor-like repeats, and multiple cytoplasmic tyrosines. Analysis of the tissue distribution of PEAR1 showed that it was most highly expressed in platelets and endothelial cells. Upon platelet aggregation induced by physiological agonists, PEAR1 became phosphorylated on tyrosine (Tyr-925), and serine (Ser-953 and Ser-1029) residues. PEAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation was blocked by eptifibatide, an αIIbβ3 antagonist, which inhibits platelet aggregation. Immune clustering of PEAR1 resulted in PEAR1 phosphorylation. Aggregation-induced PEAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation lead to the subsequent association with the ShcB adaptor protein. Platelet proximity induced by centrifugation also induced PEAR1 tyrosine phosphorylation, a reaction not inhibited by eptifibatide. These data suggest that PEAR1 is a novel platelet receptor that signals secondary to αIIbβ3-mediated platelet-platelet contacts.

These data suggest that PEAR1 is a novel platelet receptor that signals secondary to αIIbβ3-mediated platelet-platelet contacts. Platelet aggregation during arterial thrombosis results in ischemic complications precipitating in acute myocardial infarction and stroke. Platelet aggregation is known to be mediated by signaling events initiated by primary platelet agonists such as thrombin, ADP, and collagen, which induce a conformational change in the platelet integrin αIIbβ3, allowing it to bind soluble fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor, resulting in platelet cross-linking. Platelet-platelet contacts during aggregation subsequently initiate secondary signaling events. Aggregation-induced signaling can result in multiple platelet secondary signaling events such as calcium mobilization, protein tyrosine phosphorylations, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and the release of platelet-dense bodies and α-granules. Aggregation-induced signaling is key to the formation of stable aggregates, particularly when aggregation is induced by low concentrations of one or more primary agonists. Platelet activation also causes the release of ADP from dense bodies and the generation of thromboxane A2, both of which induce further platelet stimulation.Several mediators of aggregation-induced signals have been identified. One is αIIbβ3 itself, which becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and also associates with numerous signaling and cytoskeletal proteins following platelet activation, allowing fibrinogen and/or von Willebrand factor binding and platelet aggregation. The importance of αIIbβ3 “outside-in” signaling in the enhancement of platelet aggregation was demonstrated by the generation of knock-in mice where tyrosine residues Tyr-747 and Tyr-759 were mutated to phenylalanine (1Law D.A. DeGuzman F.R. Heiser P. Ministri-Madrid K. Killeen N. Phillips D.R. Nature. 1999; 401: 808-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (269) Google Scholar). These so-called DiYF mice displayed selective impairment of outside-in signaling, resulting in the formation of unstable aggregates. Other mediators are released from the activated platelets. One is the soluble CD40 ligand, a hydrolytic product produced by metalloprotease cleavage of the CD40 ligand on activated platelets that subsequently binds to αIIbβ3. Another is GAS6, a protein released from α-granules that is involved in the stabilization of platelet-rich thrombi (2Andre P. Prasad K.S. Denis C.V. He M. Papalia J.M. Hynes R.O. Phillips D.R.

Med. 2001; 7: 215-221Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar).Although the importance of each of the platelet secondary signaling reactions described above is well documented, these reactions are dependent upon platelet activation. It has also been well documented, however, that platelet stimulation can be induced by platelet-platelet contact. Signaling of platelet receptors induced by platelet-platelet proximity, independent of platelet aggregation, have not been described. One exception may be the Eph kinases and ephrins, specifically EphA4 and ephrinB1, which, through receptor-ligand interactions on the platelet surface, enhance the binding of αIIbβ3 to immobilized fibrinogen in the presence of physiological agonists (4Prevost N. Woulfe D. Tanaka T. Brass L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 9219-9224Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 5Prevost N. Woulfe D. Tognolini M. Brass L.F. J. Thromb. Haemost. 2003; 1: 1613-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar); however, the importance of this mechanism in platelet-platelet signaling on unstimulated platelets is unknown.The present study was designed to identify novel platelet proteins involved in platelet proximity-induced activation. Reasoning that many signaling receptors become tyrosine-phosphorylated during signaling, we sought not only to identify novel receptors on platelets but to specifically identify those that become phosphorylated upon platelet-platelet interactions, independent of the activation state of the platelet. Initially, we used a bioinformatics approach and profiled platelet RNA on oligonucleotide-based microarrays to identify novel membrane proteins. We also used LC/MS/MS 1The abbreviations used are: LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry; aa, amino acid(s); ECD, extracellular domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ICD, intracellular domain; PEAR1, platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1; hPEAR1, human PEAR1; mPEAR1, mouse PEAR1; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; SREC, scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells; TRAP, thrombin receptor activating peptide. 1The abbreviations used are: LC/MS/MS, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry; aa, amino acid(s); ECD, extracellular domain; EGF, epidermal growth factor; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; HUVEC, human umbilical vein endothelial cell; HRP, horseradish peroxidase; ICD, intracellular domain; PEAR1, platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1; hPEAR1, human PEAR1; mPEAR1, mouse PEAR1; PTB, phosphotyrosine binding; SREC, scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells; TRAP, thrombin receptor activating peptide. to identify platelet proteins that become phosphorylated upon platelet aggregation. Surprisingly, both techniques converged on a novel 1034-amino acid protein we termed PEAR1 (platelet-endothelial aggregation receptor 1). Bioinformatic analyses revealed that PEAR1 is a type 1 membrane protein containing fifteen EGF-like repeats in its extracellular domain. The intracellular domain contains five proline rich domains, which may interact with Src homology 3 domain-containing proteins, as well as four potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Tyr-804, Tyr-925, Tyr-943, Tyr-979). The LC/MS/MS data demonstrated that PEAR1 is, in fact, tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-925. We further demonstrated that PEAR1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated in response to receptor clustering and during platelet aggregation. Finally, we showed that the PEAR1 signaling is induced through platelet-platelet contacts independent of platelet activation. These data are the first demonstration of a platelet receptor to signal through platelet-platelet contacts independent of platelet activation.MATERIALS AND METHODSReagents—The following reagents were purchased from the suppliers named in parentheses: anti-Myc (9E10) monoclonal IgG (Covance; Princeton, NJ); goat anti-rabbit HRP and goat anti-mouse HRP (Bio-Rad); anti-PY99 monoclonal IgG (Santa Cruz Technologies, Santa Cruz, CA); anti-phospho-Src (Tyr-416) polyclonal IgG, anti-Shc polyclonal IgG, and anti-Shc monoclonal IgG (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, MA); 4G10 anti-PY monoclonal antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions); anti-CD62-P and anti-PY20 monoclonal antibodies and isotype-specific anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies (BD Biosciences); IV.3 monoclonal antibody hybridoma (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA); thrombin (Hematologic Technology, Essex Junction, VT); Collagen (Chronolog Corp., Havertown, PA); TRAP (SynPep Corp., Dublin, CA), eptifibatide, (Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Cambridge, MA); Easy-FITC kit (Pierce); Superscript II reverse transcriptase, platinum Pfx DNA polymerase, and pCR-BluntII-Topo vector (Invitrogen); goat anti-rabbit/mouse HRP (Bio-Rad); ECL chemiluminescent detection kit and protein G-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences); Restore stripping buffer (Pierce); and Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore).Purification of Platelet RNA—Platelets were collected from a healthy volunteer by apheresis, including a filtration step that removed lymphocyte contaminants following an Institutional Review Board-approved protocol. This procedure yielded ∼250 ml of platelets (∼1 × 109 platelets/ml). Platelets were diluted 1:4 with CGS (13 mm sodium citrate, 30 mm glucose, and 0.12 m sodium chloride) containing 0.1 μg/ml prostacyclin (PGI2). Platelets were pelleted by spinning for 20 min at 2200 rpm in a Beckman Coulter Allegra 6 centrifuge at room temperature. The supernatant was removed, and the platelet pellet was resuspended in RNA-STAT-60 (Tel-Test) using 1 ml of RNA-STAT-60 per 2.9 × 108 platelets and immediately vortexed to facilitate platelet lysis. The platelet lysate was further processed according to RNA-STAT-60 protocol specifications. Total RNA was then treated with RNA Easy (Qiagen) for further purification.Identification of PEAR1 cDNA and Full-length Cloning—5 μg of DNase-treated platelet RNA was converted to cRNA, fragmented, and hybridized to the Millennium Pharmaceuticals cardiovascular custom 60-mer oligonucleotide array per the manufacturer's suggested protocol (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA). The probe sets contained on the custom array represented 25,000 genes that were selected based on publicly available sequence information and in-house sequencing efforts of endothelial and platelet cDNA libraries. Data were analyzed with MASv5 (Affymetrix) and Rosetta Resolver (Rosetta Biosoftware). cRNA hybridized to probe sets with intensity p values of ≤0.01 were identified. Platelet cRNA hybridized to a probe set for FLJ00193, and through bioinformatic analyses it was determined that the FLJ00193 cDNA encoded an incomplete open reading frame that contained two EGF repeats and a potential transmembrane domain. A proprietary in-house DNA sequence and a publicly available DNA sequence were used to assemble a 3.6-kb predicted cDNA. Platelet cDNA was synthesized by using Superscript II reverse transcriptase. PEAR1 cDNA was amplified using Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase and the primers 5′-GCAGGCTTCATATCCTGAACGCTG-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGATTAACGGTCCTGGCGTCGAAGTGGAGGTGATG-3′ (reverse). The resulting 3.2-kb cDNA was cloned into pCR-BluntII-Topo vector.Generation and Purification of Anti-peptide Antibodies—Anti-PEAR1 rabbit polyclonal antibodies were generated by BIOSOURCE using keyhole limpet hemocyanin-conjugated peptides derived from the N-terminal extracellular domain (aa 72–88; YRTVYRQVVKTDHRQRL) and the intracellular domain (aa 856–874, QGHDNHTTLPADWKHRREP). Serum was affinity-purified using the immunizing peptide coupled to a thiol reactive gel. The antibodies raised against peptide 71–85 are referred to as α-extracellular domain (α-ECD) PEAR1 IgGs. The antibodies raised against peptide 864–874 are referred to as α-intracellular domain (α-ICD) PEAR1 IgGs.In Situ Localization of PEAR1 mRNA Using Biotin-labeled Oligonucleotide Probes Detected by ABC Peroxidase—Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human and rodent tissues were used in this study. Digoxigenin-labeled riboprobes were used to localize PEAR1 mRNA. The details of the non-isotopic in situ hybridization and the tyramide-mediated signal amplification, as well as the methods used for acquiring digital images, have been described earlier (6Komuves L.G. Feren A. Jones A.L. Fodor E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 2000; 48: 821-830Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar, 7Wasserman S.M. Mehraban F. Komuves L.G. Yang R.B. Tomlinson J.E. Zhang Y. Spriggs F. Topper J.N. Physiol. Genomics. 2002; 12: 13-23Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Science), digoxigenin-labeled antisense and sense riboprobes were generated from a DNA template containing nucleotides 2369–2896.TaqMan Analysis—TaqMan experiments were performed using an ABI PRISM 7700 system (Applied Biosystems). Primers were designed using Primer Express software. 50 ng of RNA from a variety of human tissues and primary cell lines were used for analysis. PEAR1 and β-macroglobulin probes were labeled with different fluorescent dyes as per the manufacturer's protocol. β-Macroglobulin was used as an endogenous control to allow for normalization of the amount of RNA added to each reaction. The differential labeling of the target gene (PEAR1) and the reference gene (β-macroglobulin) occurred in the same well.hPEAR1 Constructs, FLAG- and Myc-tagged—The primers 5′-CGGAATTCACCCAGTGATCCCAATACCTGC-3′ (forward) and 5′-GCTCTAGATTAACGGTCCTGGCGTCGAAGTGG-3′ (reverse) were used to PCR-amplify a PEAR1 fragment that coded for amino acids 23–1037. The resulting PCR fragment was digested with EcoR1 and XbaI and subcloned into pFLAG-CMV1 (Sigma) to express a membrane-localized, N-terminally FLAG-tagged PEAR1. A C-terminally Myc-tagged PEAR1 was constructed by PCR amplification using the primers 5′-CGGAATTCAATGTCACCGCCTCTGTGTCC-3′ and 5′-CCGCTCGAGACGGTCCTGGCGTCGAAGTGG-3′. The resulting PEAR1 PCR fragment, which coded for amino acids 1–1037, was digested with EcoR1 and XhoI and subcloned into pCMV-5A (Stratagene).Cell Culture and Transfection—COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's media supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were plated in 6-well dishes (4 × 105 cells/well). After 24 h, transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (2 μg of DNA per well) for 24 h. The vectors and constructs used in the transfection experiments were pCDNA3 (vector control), pFLAG-CMV-PEAR1 (N-terminal FLAG-tagged PEAR1), pCMV-5A-PEAR1 (C-terminal Myc-tagged PEAR1), and pcDNA3-v-Src.Immunoprecipitations and Western Blotting from COS-7 Cells— Transfected cells were lysed with 0.4 ml of lysis buffer (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 5 mm MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin). For immunoprecipitations, lysates were incubated with 2 μg of the indicated antibodies. For Western analysis, polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were incubated with the indicated antibodies (1 μg/ml) for 2 h at 4 °C. Membranes were then incubated with 1:10,000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse or goat anti-rabbit IgG for 1 h at room temperature and developed with the ECL™ chemiluminescent detection kit. Methodologies used for SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitations have been described previously (8Cowan K.J. Law D.A. Phillips D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36423-36429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar).Phosphopeptide Identification by In-gel Digestion and Mass Spectrometry—Washed human platelets were aggregated with 5 μm human TRAP as described below and solubilized in 2× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na2VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin). Solubilized platelet-aggregated proteins from 6 × 109 platelets were incubated with α-phosphotyrosine IgG beads (PY99; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) overnight at 4 °C. The phosphoproteins were eluted with 100 mm phenyl phosphate, resolved by SDS-PAGE, and visualized by Coomassie staining. All Coomassie-stained bands were excised and subjected to in-gel proteolytic digestion with trypsin and analyzed by LC/MS/MS (9Loyet K.M. Stults J.T. Arnott D. Mol. Cell. Proteomics. 2005; 4: 235-245Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Data-dependent LC/MS/MS was performed using electrospray ionization on an LCQ Deca XP ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo Finnigan). An aliquot of each digest mixture was introduced to the mass spectrometer by reversed-phase chromatographic separation with a 75-μm inner diameter capillary column flowing at a rate of ∼350 nl/min and eluted using a 30-min acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid gradient. Chromatographic separation yielded ∼30-s peak widths, and mass spectra were acquired in 9-s cycles. Each cycle was of the form consisting of one full mass spectrometry scan followed by four MS/MS scans on the most abundant precursor ions subjected to dynamic exclusion for a period of 1.5 min. The identity of each peptide sequenced was determined by interpreting the MS/MS spectra using the SpectrumMill software (Agilent Technologies).Platelet Preparation—Human venous blood from healthy drug-free donors was drawn into ACD (85 mm citrate, 111 mm glucose, 714 mm citric acid) supplemented with 50 ng/ml prostacyclin (Sigma) and washed as described previously (10Jantzen H.M. Gousset L. Bhaskar V. Vincent D. Tai A. Reynolds E.E. Conley P.B. Thromb. Haemost. 1999; 81: 111-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Washed platelets were resuspended in Tyrode's solution-Hepes buffer with 1 mm CaCl2 and MgCl2 at a cell density of 1–3 × 108 platelets/ml.Platelet Lysate Preparation—Aggregations were measured in a Chronolog lumiaggregometer. Human washed platelet aggregations (3 × 108 cells/ml) were initiated with 0.5 units/ml thrombin (Hematologic Technology), 10 μg/ml collagen (Chronolog Corp.), or 5 μm human TRAP (SynPep Corp.) and, in some cases, 2 μm eptifibatide (Integrelin®; Millennium Pharmaceuticals) was included. Spun platelet pellets were prepared by centrifugation of human washed platelets (3 × 108 cells/ml) at 14,000 × g for 5 min. Platelet pellets were lysed as described below after various time points. Platelets were lysed in an equal volume of 2× lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 2% Triton X-100, 4 mm EDTA, 250 mm NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 mm Na2VO4, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) and incubated on ice for 30 min. Samples were sonicated for 40 s, and the insoluble fraction was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C.Immunoprecipitiation and Cross-linking of Surface PEAR-1—Immunoprecipitations were performed with Protein G beads and 2.5 μg/ml α-ICD PEAR1 IgG or isotype control overnight at 4 °C. Immunoblotting of the complexes were performed with α-pTyr-4G10 (Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions) and α-pTyr-PY20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) mouse IgGs or α-ECD PEAR1 IgG rabbit IgG. For cross-linking experiments, 3 × 108 platelets/ml were incubated with 5 μg/ml α-ECD PEAR1 IgG in the presence of 25 μg/ml IV.3 monoclonal antibody for 30 min at room temperature followed by cross-linking the bound IgG with α-rabbit secondary antibody for 10 min at 37 °C. Post cross-linking, the reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold 2× lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation of PEAR1 was performed as described above.Flow Cytometry Analysis—α-ECD PEAR1 IgG was FITC-labeled using the EASY-FITC kit. Washed human platelets (1 × 106) were left resting or were activated with 5 μm TRAP for 5 min at 37 °C without stirring. Platelets were fixed with 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde for 30 min at room temperature and stained with nonspecific rabbit-IgG-FITC, α-ECD PEAR1-FITC, or α-CD62-P (P-selectin)-phycoerythrin. Platelets were analyzed on a FACSort flow cytometer (BD Biosciences).RESULTSIdentification of PEAR1 through Gene Profiling—In an effort to identify novel receptors in human platelets, high throughput molecular profiling of RNA isolated from double-phoresed platelets was performed on a custom array that contained probe sets representing 25,000 genes. The sequences for the probe sets represented on the custom arrays were derived both from sequencing of platelet and HUVEC cDNA libraries as well as all the non-overlapping human genes present in the public gene data base. The protein coding sequences of the platelet cRNAs, which hybridized to the microarrays, were then classified based on PROSITE, Pfam, and SMART (11Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Bateman A. Birney E. Biswas M. Bucher P. Cerutti L. Corpet F. Croning M.D. Durbin R. Falquet L. Fleischmann W. Gouzy J. Hermjakob H. Hulo N. Jonassen I. Kahn D. Kanapin A. Karavidopoulou Y. Lopez R. Marx B.

The selected probe sets were assigned structural annotations and further subdivided into classes of interest. The following search terms were used to classify the protein sequences of the hybridized cRNAs: predicted signal sequences, potential transmembrane domains, GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors, kinases, phosphatases, cadherins, EGF domains, fibronectins, Ig domains, SCR (short consensus repeat), leucine rich repeats, CUB (complement Clr/Cls, Uegf, and bone morphogenic protein-1), integrins, chemokines, thrombospondins, and proteases. A search for novel membrane proteins identified a 3282-bp cDNA that contained an open reading frame encoding a novel type 1 membrane protein of 1037 aa (Fig. 1). We termed the protein the platelet endothelial aggregation receptor 1 or PEAR1, based on its primary location on platelets and endothelial cells and its role in aggregation-induced signaling (see below). Homology searches revealed significant overall identity in the extracellular and intracellular domains of human PEAR1, mPEAR1, KIAA1780, and KIAA1781. PEAR1 also displays significant homology to the ECDs of CED-1 (12Zhou Z. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) and SREC (scavenger receptor expressed by endothelial cells) (13Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). A bioinformatics analysis of the PEAR1 ECD revealed the presence of 15 EGF-like repeats that vary in length from 39 to 42 aa and contain a consensus sequence of CX1–2GX2GX2–4CX3CX1–3CX1–2GX1–2CX4GX1CX1CX2GX2GX2C. An alignment of the PEAR1 EGF-like repeats is presented in Fig. 2A. The chromosomal localizations and the degree of identities between hPEAR1 and mPEAR1, KIAA1780, KIAA1781, CED-1, and SREC-I are summarized in Table I. The domain structures present in PEAR1 and related proteins are shown in Fig. 2B. Putative signaling motifs present within the ICD of PEAR1 were identified by the Scansite program (14Obenauer J.C. Cantley L.C. Yaffe M.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 2003; 31: 3635-3641Crossref PubMed Scopus (1327) Google Scholar). Five potential Src homology 3-binding, proline-rich domains (Fig. 3) were identified in hPEAR1 and mPEAR1 but not in KIAA1780 or KIAA1781. Human PEAR1, mPEAR1, and KIAA1780 contain an NPXY motif (Fig. 3) that is known to act as interaction sites for PTB domain-containing proteins (15Barnes H. Larsen B. Tyers M. van Der Geer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19119-19125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The Scansite program also predicted that the tyrosine residues 804, 925, 943, and 979 present in hPEAR1 may be tyrosine-phosphorylated (Fig. 3). Similar tyrosine residues are also present in mPEAR1, KIAA1780, and KIAA1781. Based on overall homology, it is likely that PEAR1, KIAA1780, and KIAA1781 represent a novel family of EGF repeat-containing proteins. Because of the EGF repeats and their homology to SREC and CED-1, possible functions for this novel family of proteins include cell adhesion (16Bork P. Downing A.K. Kieffer B. Campbell I.D. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1996; 29: 119-167Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the uptake of acetylated low density lipoprotein (13Adachi H. Tsujimoto M. Arai H. Inoue K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31217-31220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), and phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies (12Zhou Z. Hartwieg E. Horvitz H.R. Cell. 2001; 104: 43-56Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar).Fig. 2Alignment of the EGF repeats in hPEAR1 (A) and the domain structures of PEAR1 and related proteins (B). A, the predicted EGF repeats present in PEAR1 were aligned based on a ClustalW analysis. 15 EGF-like domains contain a consensus sequence of CX1–2GX2GX2–4CX3CX1–3CX1–2GX1–2CX4GX1CX1CX2GX2GX2C and vary in length from 39 to 42 aa. The consensus EGF repeat contains six conserved glycine residues and eight conserved cysteine residues, suggesting four disulfide-bonded cysteine pairs in each EGF repeat. The exception is EGF repeat number 4 (EGF#4), which contains six cysteines and, therefore, three potential pairs of disulfide-bonded cysteines. The conserved cysteines and glycine residues are listed underneath the aligned EGF repeats. B, hPEAR1, mPEAR1, KIAA1780, KIAA1781, CED-1, and SREC are predicted to be type 1 membrane proteins. The single predicted transmembrane domains are identified as downward slanting striped boxes. The EGF repeats, which were identified by the Pfam search program (11Apweiler R. Attwood T.K. Bairoch A. Bateman A. Birney E. Biswas M. Bucher P. Cerutti L. Corpet F. Croning M.D. Durbin R. Falquet L. Fleischmann W. Gouzy J. Hermjakob H. Hulo N. Jonassen I. Kahn D. Kanapin A. Karavidopoulou Y. Lopez R.

The intracellular domains of human and mPEAR1, KIAA1780, and KIAA1781 are shown as upward slanting striped boxes to indicate their sequence similarity. The intracellular domains of SREC and CED-1 do not share similarity with PEAR-1 and are represented as white (CED-1) and gray (SREC) boxes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Table IChromosomal localizations and degree of identities between hPEAR1 and mPEAR1, KIAA1780, KIAA1781, CED-1 and SREC-IChromosomeMessageAmino acidsECD aaICD aaEGF repeatsHomology of aa to PEAR1%hPEAR11q23.13282103775425915100mPEAR1 (AF444274)aGenBank™ accession number.3429010347532571576/77bFirst number is ECD percentage, second number is ICD percentage.hKIAA1780 (NM_032446)aGenBank™ accession number.5q33752211408852611748/34bFirst number is ECD percentage, second number is ICD percentage.hKIAA1781 (NM_032445)aGenBank™ accession number.15q22.257029697731721748/25bFirst number is ECD percentage, second number is ICD percentage.CED-1 (AF332568)aGenBank™ accession number.Unknown378411119102011638/0bFirst number is ECD percentage, second number is ICD percentage.SREC (NM_003693)aGenBank™ accession number.17P13.33457830420384738/0bFirst number is ECD percentage, second number is ICD percentage.a GenBank™ accession number.b First number is ECD percentage, second number is ICD percentage.

Here we probed the pathway by which SOD2 acquires its manganese catalytic cofactor. We found that a mitochondrial localization is essential. A cytosolic version of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sod2p is largely apo for manganese and is only efficiently activated when cells accumulate toxic levels of manganese. Furthermore, Candida albicans naturally produces a cytosolic manganese SOD (Ca SOD3), yet when expressed in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae, a large fraction of Ca SOD3 also remained manganese-deficient. The cytosol of S. cerevisae cannot readily support activation of Mn-SOD molecules. By monitoring the kinetics for metalation of S. cerevisiae Sod2p in vivo, we found that prefolded Sod2p in the mitochondria cannot be activated by manganese. Manganese insertion is only possible with a newly synthesized polypeptide. Furthermore, Sod2p synthesis appears closely coupled to Sod2p import. By reversibly blocking mitochondrial import in vivo, we noted that newly synthesized Sod2p can enter mitochondria but not a Sod2p polypeptide that was allowed to accumulate in the cytosol. We propose a model in which the insertion of manganese into eukaryotic SOD2 molecules is driven by the protein unfolding process associated with mitochondrial import.

Superoxide dismutase (SOD) 1The abbreviations used are: SOD, superoxide dismutase; YPR, raffinose based medium; CCCP, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone; β-ME, β-mercaptoethanol. enzymes represent a family of metalloproteins that have evolved to catalytically remove toxic superoxide anions. Most eukaryotes express two distinct forms, a copper- and zinc-containing enzyme (SOD1) that largely resides in the cytosol (1McCord J.M. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1969; 244: 6049-6055Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but is also found in the intermembrane space of mitochondria (2Okado-Matsumoto A. Fridovich I. J. Biol.

Hence, the post-translational insertion of the metal represents a key step in controlling enzymatic activity in vivo. Much is known about the mechanism by which SOD1 acquires copper in vivo. Copper is transported and trafficked to the site of SOD1 by the concerted action of cell surface and intracellular copper transporters and a copper chaperone known as CCS (6Culotta V.C. Klomp L.

Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33771-33776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). The copper chaperone can also act on newly synthesized molecules of SOD1 (14Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In either case, oxygen is required for CCS activity, providing a means for regulating SOD1 activity in response to oxygen status (15Furukawa Y. Torres A.S. O'Halloran T.V. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 2872-2881Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). The delivery of manganese to SOD2 should also involve a carefully controlled trafficking system. Using yeast genetics, we have identified two membrane proteins that help deliver manganese to the enzyme. One is the divalent metal transporter Smf2p that localizes in intracellular vesicles (16Cohen A. Nelson H. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33388-33394Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 17Portnoy M.E. Liu X.F. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 7893-7902Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells lacking Smf2p accumulate very low levels of manganese and show defects in manganese requiring enzymes of the Golgi and in Sod2p of mitochondria (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). A second transporter that affects yeast Sod2p is Mtm1p, a member of the mitochondrial carrier family of proteins (19Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Although the precise substrate for transport by Mtm1p is not known, Mtm1p is needed for proper insertion of manganese into mitochondrial Sod2p (19Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Despite the identification of these components, the mechanistic details of the post-translational events associated with activation of eukaryotic SOD2 are still poorly understood. The protein is encoded in the nucleus, transported across two mitochondrial membranes and once inside the mitochondrial matrix, and the polypeptide folds into a tetrameric enzyme. The stage at which manganese is introduced is not known. For example, can manganese be inserted into a pre-existing pool of apoSOD2, as is the case with copper containing SOD1? In addition, it is not clear whether SOD2 requires a mitochondrial location to acquire its metal cofactor. In certain organisms, Mn-SODs can be activated outside the mitochondria. The pathogenic fungi Candida albicans (20Lamarre C. LeMay J.D. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43784-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and the blue crab Callinectes sapidus (21Brouwer M. Hoexum Brouwer T. Grater W. Brown-Peterson N. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) both express Mn-SODs in the cytosol. When the Mn-SODs from either C. albicans or from the bacterium Bacillus stearothermophilus were targeted to the cytosol of S. cerevisiae, they exhibited certain activity (20Lamarre C. LeMay J.D. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43784-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 22Wei J.P. Srinivasan C. Han H. Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. J.

Bacteriol. 1990; 172: 1539-1546Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results alone would suggest that a mitochondrial location may not be essential for manganese activation of SOD2. In this study, we explored the pathway for inserting manganese into mitochondrial SOD2 using S. cerevisiae Sod2p as a model. We found that efficient metalation of Sod2p requires a mitochondrial localization of the protein; a cytosolic version of Sod2p is poorly activated with the metal. Furthermore, only newly synthesized molecules of Sod2p that are freshly imported into mitochondria can acquire the metal in vivo. Manganese cannot be readily inserted into a pool of Sod2p that is apo for manganese. We provide a model in which manganese insertion into Sod2p is driven by the protein unfolding process associated with mitochondrial import. Yeast Strains and Growth Conditions—The yeast strains used in this study, including the wild-type BY4741 (MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0) and the isogenic smf2Δ::kanMX4 (1878) and sod2Δ::kanMX4 (6605) mutant variants, were purchased from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL). Yeast cultures were maintained in enriched yeast-peptone-based medium supplemented with 2% glucose (YPD) or 2% raffinose (YPR) or in minimal synthetic medium supplemented with 2% glucose (24Sherman F. Fink G.R. Lawrence C.W. Methods in Yeast Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York1978Google Scholar). Plasmids—The pEL111 vector was constructed by subcloning the BamHI-SalI fragment of pEL101 (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) containing –557 to +894 of the S. cerevisiae SOD2 gene into the pRS415 vector (25Christianson T.W.

To construct the vector pEL1G1 bearing a GAL1-SOD2 fusion, a SacI site (GAGCTC) was first introduced in the SOD2-expressing vector pEL101 (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) replacing the sequence TAAAAA 15 bp upstream of the SOD2 start codon by site-directed mutagenesis. This plasmid was subsequently digested with SacI and XhoI, and the resulting 910-bp fragment containing the SOD2 open reading frame and its transcriptional terminator was subcloned downstream of a GAL1 promoter in the pYES2/CT vector (Invitrogen) using the same restriction sites. Sequence integrity was confirmed by DNA sequencing analysis (Core Facility, Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions). The multicopy expression vector for cytosolic Sod2p (amino acids 27 to the stop codon) pEL124 was created by subcloning the BamHI-SalI fragment of pEL104 (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) into pRS425 (25Christianson T.W. Sikorski R.S. Dante M. Shero J.H. Hieter P. Gene. 1992; 110: 119-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (1434) Google Scholar) at the same restriction enzyme sites. The resulting construct for cytosolic Sod2p contains the SOD2 gene promoter (–558 to –1) and terminator (+703 to +889) but lacks the mitochondrial presequence. The C. albicans SOD3 expression vector pVTSOD3 was described previously (20Lamarre C. LeMay J.D. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43784-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Biochemical Assays—For preparation of cell lysates, S. cerevisiae strains were inoculated in 50 ml of YPD at a starting A600 of ∼0.05 and allowed to grow without shaking at 30 °C for ∼15 h. In general, whole cell lysates were prepared by glass-bead agitation as described previously (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Where mitochondrial fractionation was required, yeast cells were converted to spheroplasts, lysed with a Dounce homogenizer, and fractionated into mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial cell fractions by differential centrifugation as previously described (26Jensen L. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Whole cell lysates or cellular fractions were analyzed for SOD activity by native gel electrophoresis and staining with nitroblue tetrazolium (27Flohe L. Otting F. Packer L. Methods in Enzymology: Oxygen Radicals in Biological Systems. 105. Academic press, New York1984: 93-104Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Sod2p and C. albicans SOD3 polypeptide levels were monitored by subjecting whole cell lysates or cell fractions to denaturing gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting with an antibody directed against S. cerevisiae Sod2p (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) that cross-reacts with C. albicans SOD3. Where needed, antibodies directed against Mas2p (gift from Dr. Rob Jensen, Johns Hopkins University) and cytosolic Pgk1p (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) were used as described (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). S. cerevisiae Sod2p (containing the N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence) and C. albicans SOD3 were purified as recombinant proteins as described previously (19Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M.

Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 7131-7137Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Molar concentrations of these SOD molecules were determined by amino acid hydrolysis analysis (Protein Chemistry Laboratory, Texas A & M University). To monitor the rate of manganese activation of Sod2p, smf2Δ mutants deficient in manganese were grown in YPD medium for ∼15htoan A600 of ∼3.0. 10 μm MnSO4 was then added and after various time intervals, 25 ml of culture samples were removed for preparation of whole cell lysates by glass bead homogenization and for monitoring Sod2p activity and polypeptide levels as above. Where needed, 100 μg/ml cycloheximide was added to cultures just prior to manganese supplementation. In a duplicate set of cultures, lysates were prepared from spheroplasts, and crude mitochondria were isolated (26Jensen L. Culotta V.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2000; 20: 3918-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). The mitochondria fractions were analyzed for manganese content as described in Ref. 19Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar by atomic absorption spectroscopy using a PerkinElmer AAnalyst 600 graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometer. To follow in vivo mitochondrial import of Sod2p, sod2Δ yeast mutant cells were transformed with the GAL1-SOD2 vector pEL1G1 and cultured for 17 h in YPR medium to an A600 of 1.1–1.5. 2% galactose was then added to induce SOD2 expression. Where needed, 20 μm of the proton uncoupler carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) (Sigma) was added to block mitochondrial import (29Reid G.A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13056-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of 0.05% (v/v) β-mercaptoethenol (β-ME) served to neutralize CCCP as described previously (29Reid G.A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13056-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cell lysates were prepared by spheroplast homogenization, and mitochondrial and post-mitochondrial supernatant fractions were prepared as described above. Efficient Metalation of Sod2p Requires Mitochondrial Localization—We tested whether a mitochondrial localization of Sod2p was needed for manganese insertion into the enzyme. A cytosolic version of S. cerevisiae Sod2p was created by removing the N-terminal mitochondrial presequence (Fig. 1A) (30Marres C. Loon A.V. Oudshoorn P. Steeg H.V. Grivell L. Slater E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1985; 147: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The resulting Sod2p molecule (CytSod2p) was expressed in a sod2Δ mutant of S. ceresiviae lacking the endogenous mitochondrial Sod2p. As seen in Fig. 1B, CytSod2p co-localizes with the cytosolic marker Pgk1p and is largely excluded from the mitochondria marked by the mitochondrial matrix protein Mas2p. By comparison, expression of native Sod2p harboring the N-terminal presequence (MitoSod2p) resulted in a mitochondrial localization of the enzyme as expected (Fig. 1B). To test for enzymatic activity, lysates from cells expressing CytSod2p or MitoSod2p were applied to a native gel and analyzed for SOD activity by nitroblue tetrazolium staining. As seen in Fig. 1C, the cytosolic Sod2p was largely inactive compared with the mitochondrial enzyme (compare lanes 1 and 6). The activity of CytSod2p was restored by manganese supplementation in vivo, indicating that the lack of CytSod2p activity under physiological conditions results from a manganese deficiency in the enzyme. It is noteworthy that the amount of manganese required to activate CytSod2p is quite high (≥100 μm). This is a concentration that is somewhat toxic to the yeast, as indicated by slowed growth ((19Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and (not shown)). The cytosolic form of Sod2p is only active when cells hyperaccumulate manganese. Under physiological conditions, Sod2p needs to be inside the mitochondria to be efficiently activated. Cytosolic SOD3 from C. albicans Is Largely Active When Expressed in S. cerevisiae—The pathogenic fungi C. albicans expresses a manganese-containing SOD in the cytosol (Ca SOD3) that is reported to be active when expressed in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae (20Lamarre C. LeMay J.D. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43784-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). We therefore addressed whether Ca SOD3 has a unique ability to acquire manganese in the cytosol. Consistent with earlier studies (19Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 20Lamarre C. LeMay J.D. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43784-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), Ca SOD3 expressed in S. cerevisiae exhibits some activity under physiological conditions (Fig. 2A, lanes 2 and 8). Expression was observed in both a sod2Δ strain (lane 8) and a strain expressing the endogenous mitochondrial Sod2p of S. cerevisiae (lane 2). Activity of Ca SOD3 expressed in S. cerevisiae is limited by manganese bioavailability. Decreasing intracellular manganese through a deletion of the Smf2p manganese transporter (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) abolished Ca SOD3 activity (Fig. 2A, lane 5), and activity was rescued by growing cells in the presence of 100 μm manganese (lane 6). In fact, such manganese supplementation also had a dramatic effect on Ca SOD3 activity in SMF2 wild-type cells (lanes 3 and 9). Hence, there appears to be a large inactive pool of Ca SOD3 that is manganese-deficient and can be activated at high intracellular manganese, reminiscent of the scenario seen with S. cerevisiae cytSod2p (Fig. 1C). The expression of Ca SOD3 in S. cerevisiae is driven by a high copy vector and the strong constitutive ADH1 promoter (20Lamarre C. LeMay J.D. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43784-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). To estimate how much Ca SOD3 is being produced relative to endogenous Sc Sod2p, purified Sc Sod2p and Ca SOD3 proteins of known concentrations were used as standards in a semiquantitative immunoblot against lysates from cells expressing Sc Sod2p and Ca SOD3. As seen in Fig. 2B, Ca SOD3 is expressed in S. cerevisiae on a per mole basis at levels that are roughly 10-fold higher than the endogenous Sc Sod2p. This overexpression of Ca SOD3 protein may explain why activity can be detected in S. cerevisiae, despite the fact that a large fraction of the protein lacks manganese. Overall, the findings obtained with Ca SOD3 and with cytosolic Sod2p demonstrated that, in S. cerevisiae, efficient activation of Sod2p requires a mitochondrial localization. There is clearly a component absent from the cytosol that is required for efficient activation of Sod2p. Insertion of Manganese into Sod2p Requires New Protein Synthesis—How is mitochondrial Sod2p activated with manganese? We know that, in the case of copper-containing Sod1p, a pre-existing apopool of the enzyme is rapidly activated with copper in the absence of new protein synthesis (13Schmidt P. Kunst C. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33771-33776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 14Bartnikas T.B. Gitlin J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 33602-33608Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). We tested whether the same was true for manganese-containing Sod2p of the mitochondria. To monitor activation of a pool of Sod2p that is largely apo for manganese, we utilized the manganese-deficient smf2Δ mutant. In these cells, the Sod2p polypeptide still accumulates in the mitochondria, but is largely inactive because of low mitochondrial manganese (18Luk E. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 47556-47562Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Sod2p activity is fully restored in this mutant by culturing cells in the presence of 10 μm manganese (Fig. 3, A and C, lanes 3). We monitored the time required to activate Sod2p following the addition of manganese to the growth medium. As shown in Fig. 3, A and C, Sod2p was activated very slowly by manganese and required at least 2–3 h of treatment with the metal. By comparison, activation of cytosolic Sod1p by copper in S. cerevisiae cells is complete in <5 min (13Schmidt P. Kunst C. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33771-33776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The slow activation of mitochondrial Sod2p is not a result of slow trafficking of the metal to the mitochondria, as mitochondrial manganese was restored to near wild-type levels after 15 min of treatment with manganese (Fig. 3B). Such a delay in metalation of the enzyme suggests that new protein synthesis may be required. To address the requirement for protein synthesis, the time course for Sod2p activation was monitored under conditions in which in vivo protein translation was blocked by cycloheximide. Fig. 3C shows that cycloheximide treatment (lanes 5, 7, and 9) completely abolished the increase in Sod2p activity with manganese treatment. Trafficking of manganese into the mitochondria, however, was unaffected by cycloheximide, as indicated by atomic absorption spectroscopy (Fig. 3B). Thus, manganese insertion requires new protein synthesis. The metal is not readily inserted into a pre-existing pool of apoSod2p, and only a freshly synthesized Sod2p molecule appears competent for metalation. Mitochondrial Import and Synthesis of Sod2p Appear Closely Coupled—Synthesis of the Sod2p polypeptide occurs outside the mitochondria, whereas metalation of Sod2p takes place within mitochondria. Based on these distinct cellular locations, why would polypeptide synthesis be required for manganese insertion? As a likely explanation, the synthesis of Sod2p may be closely coupled with mitochondrial import, and it is the import process that facilitates manganese insertion. In fact, it has been suggested that certain mitochondrial proteins are imported co-translationally (31Verner K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 366-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33MacKenzie J.A. Payne R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 9803-9810Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 34Mukhopadhyay A. Ni L. Weiner H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), because folding of the polypeptide in the cytosol would prohibit mitochondrial uptake. We tested whether this was the case for Sod2p. An experiment was designed in which Sod2p synthesis was controlled via the S. cerevisiae GAL1 promoter. A sod2Δ deletion strain was transformed with an inducible Sod2p expression vector (Gal-Sod2p), and following 15–30 min of treatment with galactose, newly synthesized Sod2p became apparent (Fig. 4A). All of the newly synthesized Sod2p migrated as a single species (Fig. 4A), representing the mitochondrial processed (“P”) form. Unprocessed, precursor Sod2p (“U”) is completely absent in the induced samples, suggesting that the mitochondrial import of Sod2p occurs immediately following, or concomitant with, Sod2p synthesis. To address this further, we uncoupled mitochondrial import and protein synthesis. This was achieved through use of the proton ionophore CCCP, which blocks import by disrupting the mitochondrial membrane potential (29Reid G.A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13056-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 4B, lanes 4–6, shows that CCCP completely blocked import of Sod2p into the mitochondria. As a result, the unprocessed Sod2p precursor (U) accumulated in the cytosolic fraction (Fig. 4B, lane 5). The effect of CCCP can be neutralized by β-ME (29Reid G.A. Schatz G. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13056-13061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and when β-ME is added shortly following CCCP, there is no inhibition of import, and newly synthesized Sod2p was taken into mitochondria and processed (P) (Fig. 4B, lanes 7–9). Using this system, we tested whether pre-existing cytosolic Sod2p can be chased into mitochondria. In the experiment of Fig. 4C, Sod2p synthesis was induced for 3 h in the presence of CCCP to allow accumulation of unprocessed cytosolic Sod2p (U) (lane 1). Where indicated, β-ME was then added for an additional 45 min. β-ME clearly reversed the effects of CCCP during this time frame, because the shorter form of Sod2p representing processed mitochondrial Sod2p (P) became apparent (Fig. 4C, lane 3). However, the unprocessed (U) Sod2p that accumulated prior to β-ME treatment was unchanged when mitochondrial import function was restored with β-ME (compare U in Fig. 4C, lanes 1 and 3). Furthermore, the appearance of processed mitochondrial Sod2p required new protein synthesis, as cycloheximide specifically prevented formation of processed (P) Sod2p in β-ME treated cells (lane 4). Together these findings are consistent with the notion that mitochondrial import requires freshly translated Sod2p. Overall, the synthesis, mitochondrial import, and manganese insertion steps for Sod2p are closely coordinated in time. The mitochondrial SOD2 enzyme is well known for its role in eukaryote survival and fitness (35Duttaroy A. Paul A. Kundu M. Belton A.

Yet despite this widespread importance, virtually nothing is known about the maturation of the SOD2 polypeptide in vivo. How is the inactive protein encoded by the nucleus converted into an active manganese-containing enzyme in the mitochondrial matrix? We have shown here that activation of S. cerevisiae Sod2p through insertion of the manganese cofactor must occur within the mitochondria. When expressed in the cytosol of S. cerevisiae, Mn-SOD molecules are poorly activated. Efficient manganese activation also requires new protein synthesis and mitochondrial import. Our data are consistent with a model in which the translation, mitochondrial import, and manganese activation of Sod2p are closely coupled in time. Although Sod2p is largely inactive when expressed in the cytosol of S. cerevsiae, activity could be restored by exposing cells to high toxic concentrations of manganese. Under normal physiological conditions, the bioavailability of manganese in the cytoplasm appears too low to activate newly synthesized Sod2p. This may be a universal phenomenon, because most eukaryotes do not express a cytosolic Mn-SOD. However, there are rare exceptions, as in the case of the cytosolic Mn-SOD of C. albicans (20Lamarre C. LeMay J.D. Deslauriers N. Bourbonnais Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 43784-43791Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) and of decapod crustaceans (21Brouwer M. Hoexum Brouwer T. Grater W. Brown-Peterson N. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Our studies here show that C. albicans SOD3 does not possess an inherent ability to acquire cytosolic manganese, as a large fraction of the protein remained inactive when expressed in the cytoplasm of S. cerevisiae. Instead, C. albicans, as well as the crustaceans, may have evolved novel methods for delivering manganese to Mn-SOD in the cytosol, e.g. mechanisms that involve a manganese chaperone or elevated bioavailability of the metal. Our studies show that import of S. cerevisiae Sod2p into mitochondria requires a freshly synthesized Sod2p polypeptide. If allowed to accumulate and fold in the cytosol, Sod2p is refractory to mitochondrial uptake. When folded, Sod2p is a notoriously stable molecule. Human SOD2 is stable at 60 °C (43Borgstahl G.E. Parge H.E. Hickey M.J. Beyer Jr., W.F. Hallewell R.A. Tainer J.A. Cell. 1992; 71: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), and the S. cerevisiae enzyme can be purified following treatment at 70 °C with little loss in activity (5Ravindranath S.D. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1975; 250: 6107-6112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Studies with homologous manganese SODs from bacteria have shown that even the apoform of the enzyme forms a tight stable structure resistant to thermal denaturation (44Whittaker M. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34751-34757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Mizuno K. Whittaker M.M. Bachinger H.P. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 27339-27344Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). As such, it is not surprising that import of SOD2 into mitochondria must occur before the protein has a chance to fold in the cytosol. In this regard, it is noteworthy that the mRNA for SOD2 in mammalian cells and the mRNA/ribosomes for Sod2p in S. cerevisiae are both found associated with the outer membrane of mitochondria (46Ginsberg M.D. Feliciello A. Jones J.K. Avvedimento E.V. Gottesman M.E. J. Mol. Biol. 2003; 327: 885-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 47Marc P. Margeot A. Devaux F. Blugeon C. Corral-Debrinski M. Jacq C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). With other mitochondrial proteins, the 3′-UTR was found to mediate association with the mitochondrial outer membrane (47Marc P. Margeot A. Devaux F. Blugeon C. Corral-Debrinski M. Jacq C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar), and the same may be true for Sod2p. In any case, translation of S. cerevisiae Sod2p appears to occur at the site of the mitochondria to facilitate co-translational import of the protein into mitochondria (31Verner K. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1993; 18: 366-371Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 32Fujiki M. Verner K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1914-1920Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Mukhopadhyay A. Ni L. Weiner H. Biochem. J. 2004; 382: 385-392Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 47Marc P. Margeot A. Devaux F. Blugeon C. Corral-Debrinski M. Jacq C. EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). Once imported into mitochondria, Sod2p needs to rapidly acquire its metal, because a pre-existing inactive pool of mitochondrial Sod2p failed to acquire manganese in vivo. This is consistent with in vitro studies preformed on the homologous bacterial Mn-SOD enzymes (44Whittaker M. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34751-34757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Mizuno K. Whittaker M.M. Bachinger H.P. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol.

When folded, these enzymes cannot acquire the metal. Activation with manganese is only possible when the proteins were thermally denatured and the metal was present during, but not after, refolding of the polypeptide (44Whittaker M. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34751-34757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Mizuno K. Whittaker M.M. Bachinger H.P. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol.

With Mn-SOD molecules, metal access to the active site is guarded by a large transition state barrier that only becomes accessible when the polypeptide is unfolded (44Whittaker M. Whittaker J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 34751-34757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 45Mizuno K. Whittaker M.M. Bachinger H.P. Whittaker J.W. J. Biol.

We propose that, in the case of eukaryotic manganese SOD2, the requisite protein unfolding step is achieved by mitochondrial import. Passage of polypeptides through the inner mitochondrial membrane requires extensive protein unfolding, followed by refolding once in the matrix (49Matouschek A. Pfanner N. Voos W. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 404-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 50Martin J. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1997; 29: 35-43Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). But in the case of eukaryotic SOD2, manganese insertion must take place prior to refolding. SOD2 has four amino acid ligands for manganese at positions 52, 107, 198, and 194 in the S. cerevisiae enzyme. Perhaps the metal begins to insert at the N-terminal ligands as the polypeptide emerges from the inner membrane (see schematic, Fig. 5). An accessory protein may also be involved to prevent protein folding prior to metal insertion. Currently, the only mitochondrial protein known to facilitate manganese activation of SOD2 is S. cerevisiae Mtm1p (19Luk E. Carroll M. Baker M. Culotta V.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 10353-10357Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Located in the inner membrane of mitochondria, Mtm1p is in a perfect position to assist in Sod2p metalation, as the polypeptide enters the mitochondrial matrix. The precise activity of Mtm1p is not known but may involve direct insertion of the manganese co-factor or maintaining Sod2p in a conformation that is competent for metal activation. These possibilities are under current investigation. Overall, our studies have provided a more detailed mechanistic picture for the post-translational activation of SOD2 with manganese. As shown in our model of Fig. 5, the ribosomes for S. cerevisiae Sod2p synthesis are juxtaposed to the outer mitochondrial membrane (46Ginsberg M.D. Feliciello A. Jones J.K. Avvedimento E.V.

EMBO Rep. 2002; 3: 159-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar). This allows for the coupling of Sod2p synthesis and mitochondrial import. As the polypeptide emerges from the inner membrane, manganese ions are inserted through a process that is facilitated by Mtm1p in the inner membrane and perhaps other accessory proteins as well. Last of all, the manganese-containing protein is folded in the mitochondrial matrix in a stable quaternary tetramer.

Wild type p53 encodes proline at this residue, but in <5% of African Americans, this amino acid is serine. Notably, phosphorylation of the adjacent serine 46 by the proline-directed kinase p38 MAPK is known to greatly enhance the ability of p53 to induce apoptosis. Here we showed that the serine 47 polymorphic variant, which replaces the proline residue necessary for recognition by proline-directed kinases, is a markedly poorer substrate for phosphorylation on serine 46 by p38 MAPK. Consistent with this finding, we showed that the serine 47 variant has up to 5-fold decreased ability to induce apoptosis compared with wild type p53. Mechanistically, we found that this variant has decreased ability to transactivate two p53 target genes, p53AIP1 and PUMA, but not other p53 response genes; this is the first time that phosphorylation of serine 46 has been implicated in transactivation of PUMA by p53. Down-regulation of PUMA in cells with wild type p53 using short interfering RNAs reduced apoptosis in these cells to a level comparable to that in cells containing the serine 47 variant.

Each of the main compound classes, derived from thioflavin T (PIB), Congo Red (BSB), and aminonaphthalene (FDDNP) are believed to bind to mutually exclusive sites on the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide fibrils. We recently reported the presence of three classes of binding sites (BS1, BS2, BS3) on the Aβ fibrils for thioflavin T derivatives and now extend these findings to demonstrate that these sites are also able to accommodate ligands from the other chemotype classes. The results from competition assays using [3H]Me-BTA-1 (BS3 probe) indicated that both PIB and FDDNP were able to displace the radioligand with Ki values of 25 and 42 nm, respectively. BSB was unable to displace the radioligand tracer from the Aβ fibrils. In contrast, each of the compounds examined were able to displace thioflavin T (BS1 probe) from the Aβ fibrils when evaluated in a fluorescence competition assay with Ki values for PIB, FDDNP, and BSB of 1865, 335, and 600 nm, respectively. Finally, the Kd values for FDDNP and BSB binding to Aβ fibrils were directly determined by monitoring the increases in the ligand intrinsic fluorescence, which were 290 and 104 nm, respectively. The results from these assays indicate that (i) the three classes of thioflavin T binding sites are able to accommodate a wide range of chemotype structures, (ii) BSB binds to two sites on the Aβ fibrils, one of which is BS2, and the other is distinct from the thioflavin T derivative binding sites, and (iii) there is no independent binding site on the fibrils for FDDNP, and the ligand binds to both the BS1 and BS3 sites with significantly lower affinities than previously reported.

These ligands are primarily believed to target the polymeric form of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide associated with the senile plaques and may in addition bind to neurofibrillary tangles, which are composed of tau protein polymers (1Nordberg A. Lancet Neurol. 2004; 3: 519-527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Because the number of compounds under development has increased, a somewhat confusing picture has emerged with respect to the interaction of members of the different chemotype classes with the Aβ fibrils. Initial findings, which were based on radioligand binding assays, indicated an independent binding site on the Aβ fibrils for each of the three chemotypes. For example, Agdeppa et al. (9Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Petri A. Satyamurthy N. Liu J. Huang S.C. Small G.W. Cole G.M. Barrio J.R. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar) demonstrated that [18F]FDDNP was not displaced from Aβ fibrils by either Congo Red or thioflavin T. In addition, data from Zhuang et al. (4Zhuang Z.P. Kung M.P. Hou C. Skovronsky D.M. Gur T.L. Plossl K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Kung H.F. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) indicated that the binding sites for TZDM and ISB were mutually exclusive. In contrast, data from Suemoto et al. (10Suemoto T. Okamura N. Shiomitsu T. Suzuki M. Shimadzu H. Akatsu H. Yamamoto T. Kudo Y. Sawada T. Neurosci. Res. 2004; 48: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), using a fluorescence assay format, indicated that both X34 and FDDNP were able to displace thioflavin T from Aβ fibrils. Finally, Kung et al. (11Kung M.P. Hou C. Zhuang Z.P. Skovronsky D. Kung H.F. Brain Res. 2004; 1025: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), using AD brain homogenates rather than in vitro generated Aβ fibrils, found that FDDNP could displace a radiolabeled stilbene derivative SB13. We have recently reported that the interaction of the thioflavin T class of ligands is much more complex than previously appreciated with three classes of binding sites (BSs) present on in vitro generated Aβ-(1–40) fibrils (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar); they are BS1, a medium density site associated with the high fluorescence state of thioflavin T, BS2, a high density site with binding specificity for halogen-containing ligands such as TZPM and TZPI, and BS3, a low density site detected primarily by radioligand assays. In light of these findings we have investigated whether the apparently contradictory results of the displacement assays could be rationalized in terms of the three-site binding model we proposed for the thioflavin T ligands. We have, therefore, examined the interaction of selected compounds from each of the main imaging agent chemotypes with Aβ fibrils under a standard set of conditions using a range of binding assay formats. The results from this study extend our previous model of ligand binding sites on Aβ fibrils in that it demonstrates that BS1, BS2, and BS3 are able to accommodate a range of chemotype structures. Additionally, the results suggest that FDDNP does not have a single discrete type of binding site on the fibrils.

These compounds were custom-synthesized and confirmed for purity by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography, one-dimensional NMR, and mass spectrometer analysis. Thioflavin T was obtained from Merck, and (S)-naproxen ((S)-2-(6-methoxy-2-naphthyl) propionic acid) was obtained from Sigma. Radiolabeled 2-[4′-([3H]methylamino)phenyl]-6-methylbenzothiazole ([3H]Me-BTA-1) (84 Ci/mmol, 1 mCi/ml) was custom synthesized by Amersham Biosciences. The structures of these compounds are shown in Fig. 1. Polymerization of Aβ Fibrils—Human Aβ-(1–40) peptide (Batch MK0611 from California Peptide Research, Napa, CA) was prepared in PB buffer (10 mm sodium phosphate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.4) and characterized as described previously (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Compound Preparation—All compounds were prepared as 10 mm Me2SO stocks before dilution into assay buffer. The maximum final concentration of Me2SO in the assays was 0.5%. Because of the relatively low solubility of the ligands (with the exception of thioflavin T) in aqueous solution, all assays were performed in PB supplemented with 10% ethanol. Radioligand Competition Assays—Competition assays employed a fixed concentration of Aβ-(1–40) (40 nm) and [3H]Me-BTA-1 (4 nm) and used varying concentration ranges of cold competitor dependent on the ligand as described in Lockhart et al. (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). All data points were performed in triplicate, and the specific binding signal in the absence of competitor defined a fractional binding of 1. Data were analyzed in Grafit (Erithacus Software Ltd., Horley, UK) to obtain IC50 values using full four-parameter curve fits. Ki values were derived from the Cheng-Prusoff equation (13Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar), Ki = IC50/(1 + ([L]/Kd)), where [L] was the concentration (4 nm); the Kd (3.25 nm) value of the radioligand was used in the assays. Fluorescence Competition Assays—Competition assays employed a fixed concentration of Aβ-(1–40) (2 μm) and either thioflavin T (1 μm) or FDDNP (0.4 μm) as the fluorescence tracers and varying concentrations of competitor ligands. Reactions were performed in PB supplemented with 10% ethanol in a final volume of 80 μl and were incubated for 2 h at 20 °C before measurement in an Ultra Evolution plate reader (Tecan, Reading, UK) with filter pairs of either 450–505 nm (thioflavin T) or 450–535 nm (FDDNP). All data points were performed in quadruplicate, and the fluorescent signal in the absence of competitor defined a fractional binding of 1. Data were analyzed using Grafit to obtain IC50 values using full four-parameter curve fits. Ki values were derived from the Cheng-Prusoff equation (13Cheng Y. Prusoff W.H. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1973; 22: 3099-3108Crossref PubMed Scopus (12132) Google Scholar) as noted above using Kd values of 750 (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) and 290 nm for thioflavin T and FDDNP, respectively. Intrinsic Fluorescence Intensity Binding Assays—Intrinsic fluorescence intensity (FLINT) changes associated with ligand binding to Aβ-(1–40) were performed as described previously (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Briefly, FLINT1 was performed using a fixed concentration of ligand (25 or 100 nm) and varying concentrations of Aβ-(1–40) polymer. FLINT2 was performed using a fixed concentration of Aβ-(1–40) (500 nm) and varying concentrations of ligand (0 to 2 μm) as detailed under “Results.” The fluorescence signal from the BSB and FDDNP ligands were detected in the Ultra Evolution plate reader using either 340–440- or 450–535-nm filter pairs, respectively. The resulting intensities, corrected where necessary for background fluorescence (FLINT2), were plotted in Grafit. Kd values were determined using the single-site ligand binding module. Radioligand Competition Assays Probing BS3 Interactions— Competition assays used the previously characterized compound [3H]Me-BTA-1 which is a ligand for BS3 (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). The ligand had a Kd of 3.25 nm for this batch of Aβ fibrils (data not shown), which compares favorably with our previously published value of 4.2 nm (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). As expected, the thioflavin T derivative 6-OH-BTA-1/PIB was able to completely displace the radioligand (RL) from the Aβ fibrils in a dose-dependent manner with a Ki value (KiRL) of 25 nm (Fig. 2 and Table I). The Ki value reported here is higher than the previously reported Kd for PIB of 4.7 nm (2Mathis C.A. Wang Y. Holt D.P. Huang G.F. Debnath M.L. Klunk W.E. J. Med. Chem. 2003; 46: 2740-2754Crossref PubMed Scopus (842) Google Scholar). The aminonaphthalene compound FDDNP was able to compete with [3H]Me-BTA-1 in a dose-dependent manner (KiRL = 42 nm) and is in contrast to a previous study in which radiolabeled FDDNP was not displaced by either thioflavin T or Congo Red (9Agdeppa E.D.

The compound (S)-naproxen, which shares some structural similarities with FDDNP (Fig. 1) and had previously been demonstrated to displace [18F]FDDNP from Aβ fibrils (9Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Petri A.

The fractional displacement of [3H]Me-BTA-1 by BSB was more variable than any of the other ligands examined and showed a general trend toward higher values of radiotracer binding (i.e. a fractional binding greater than 1) at the highest concentrations of competitor, a phenomenon that has also been observed by Kung et al. (11Kung M.P. Hou C. Zhuang Z.P. Skovronsky D. Kung H.F. Brain Res. 2004; 1025: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). We have no clear explanation for this behavior, but it may be that the symmetrical nature of BSB cross-links the fibrils, which in turn lead to a nonspecific trapping of radiotracer on the filters. Alternatively, BSB may induce a conformational change in the fibril structure that leads to an apparent increase in the binding capacity of the polymer for the radioligand. However, our data strongly suggests that BSB does not directly compete with [3H]Me-BTA-1 for BS3, and this conclusion is consistent with Zhuang et al. (4Zhuang Z.P. Kung M.P. Hou C. Skovronsky D.M.

Chem. 2001; 44: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), who first demonstrated that the binding sites on Aβ fibrils for thioflavin T and Congo Red derivatives were discrete. Fluorescent Competition Assays Probing BS1 Interactions— The initial set of assays was performed using thioflavin T as a tracer for BS1. All of the compounds assayed were able to completely displace the thioflavin T in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with displacement from a single population of binding sites (Fig. 3 and Table I). The Ki values (KiFL-TT) for PIB, FDDNP, and BSB were 1865, 335, and 600 nm, respectively. (S)-Naproxen was only able to displace the thioflavin T at very high concentrations, and although no direct determination for this compound was attempted, its KiFL-TT was estimated to be >20 μm. The results of these assays were different from the findings in the radioligand assays in two important respects. First, the pattern of compound binding between the two formats was different in that, whereas PIB and FDDNP were able to displace both the radioligand and fluorescence tracers, BSB was only able to displace the fluorescence tracer. Second, the KiFL-TT values were significantly higher (i.e. weaker binding) than those reported from the radioligand assays. The ability of PIB to displace from both the BS1 and BS3 sites was anticipated from our previous work with similar compounds such as IMPY and BTA-1 (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). However, the finding that FDDNP was able to displace from both sites and BSB from only BS1 was unexpected and suggested that these binding pockets displayed a much broader specificity than previously described. Determination of Binding Constants for FDDNP and BSB Binding to Aβ Fibrils—The binding of FDDNP and BSB to Aβ fibrils was directly measured by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence of ligands using two different assay formats, FLINT1 and FLINT2. These assays either vary the concentration of Aβ fibrils with a fixed concentration of ligand (FLINT1) or vary the concentration of ligand with a fixed concentration of Aβ fibrils (FLINT2). The binding isotherms from these assays were all consistent with ligand binding to a single population of binding sites on the fibrils (Fig. 4). The Kd values derived from the assays, KdFLINT1KdFLINT2, for FDDNP and BSB were 13860/290 nm and 300/104 nm, respectively (Table I). The ratio of KdFLINT1:KdFLINT2 is a measure of the binding site density on the Aβ fibrils (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar) such that FDDNP has 1 binding site every ~45 Aβ monomers, whereas BSB has 1 binding site per ~3Aβ monomers. PIB did not produce a significant increase in its intrinsic FLINT when incubated with Aβ fibrils. This is a similar finding to that noted previously for the structurally related compound BTA-1 (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Fluorescence Competition Assays Utilizing FDDNP—The similarity of the KiFL-TT value with that of the KdFL2 value for FDDNP suggested that same site, BS1, was detected by both methods. Further evidence supporting this finding came from competition assays using FDDNP as the fluorescent tracer (Fig. 5 and Table I). A Ki value (KiFL-FD) for PIB of 1365 nm was obtained for the displacement of FDDNP from the Aβ fibrils, which is similar to the KiFL-TT value of 1865 nm obtained for PIB in the thioflavin T displacement assay. This finding supports the argument that the site detected by the different fluorescence tracers is identical (i.e. BS1) and distinct from BS3. (S)-Naproxen was a poor displacer of the fluorescence tracer as noted also in the thioflavin T competition assays. The Ki value for this compound was not determined but was estimated to be >20 μm. Significant contamination of the FDDNP emission signal was observed in this assay format from both thioflavin T (data not shown) and BSB. This was derived from the intrinsic fluorescence of these compounds bleeding through the emission filter. As a consequence, no Ki values could be accurately determined for these compounds. A limited dataset of BSB concentrations that did not show significant fluorescence interference has been plotted on Fig. 5 and demonstrates that the ligand is clearly able to displace the FDDNP from the Aβ fibrils. Although we were not able to define a full displacement curve from these experiments, the shape of the curve is consistent with a Ki of similar magnitude to that observed in the thioflavin T competition assays. The development of imaging agents for detecting and quantifying senile plaque deposition in AD will be a key technology in both the preclinical and clinical evaluation of potential new therapies. Two of the agents, PIB and FDDNP, have already been used in human studies and show increased retention in AD patients in areas of the brain associated with deposition of senile plaques (14Klunk W.E. Engler H. Nordberg A. Wang Y. Blomqvist G. Holt D.P. Bergstrom M. Savitcheva I. Huang G.F. Estrada S. Ausen B. Debnath M.L. Barletta J. Price J.C. Sandell J. Lopresti B.J. Wall A. Koivisto P.

PIB appears to possess the more attractive profile, primarily due to its apparently higher specific signal (16Mathis C.A. Wang Y. Klunk W.E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1469-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). It is, therefore, of great importance that the binding properties of such ligands are fully understood to enable the correct selection of imaging agents and to aid in the interpretation of data collected from imaging studies. We have, therefore, tried to gain a fuller understanding of (i) potential inconsistencies in how members of the three main ligand chemotypes interact on the polymers and (ii) the interaction of these ligands with Aβ fibrils. Data from the radioligand competition assays using [3H]Me-BTA-1 support the original observation by Zhuang et al. (4Zhuang Z.P. Kung M.P. Hou C. Skovronsky D.M. Gur T.L. Plossl K. Trojanowski J.Q. Lee V.M. Kung H.F. J. Med. Chem. 2001; 44: 1905-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar) of independent binding sites for thioflavin T and Congo Red derivatives, as we found that BSB did not compete with the radiotracer. This finding has also been replicated by Kung et al. (11Kung M.P. Hou C. Zhuang Z.P. Skovronsky D. Kung H.F. Brain Res. 2004; 1025: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), who used AD brain homogenates rather than in vitro produced Aβ fibrils. Combined, these findings provide strong support that the site detected by [3H]Me-BTA-1, BS3, does not bind Congo Red derivatives. In contrast to previous reports for FDDNP (9Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Petri A. Satyamurthy N. Liu J. Huang S.C. Small G.W. Cole G.M. Barrio J.R. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar), we found that the ligand was able to displace the radiotracer from BS3, consistent with a direct competition for this site. This finding is supported by the recent observation that FDDNP was able to specifically displace the radiolabeled ligand SB13 from AD brain homogenates (11Kung M.P. Hou C. Zhuang Z.P. Skovronsky D. Kung H.F. Brain Res. 2004; 1025: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Although SB13 is a stilbene, it was demonstrated in the same study to compete with the thioflavin T compound IMPY (11Kung M.P. Hou C. Zhuang Z.P. Skovronsky D. Kung H.F. Brain Res. 2004; 1025: 98-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Further characterization of FDDNP clearly demonstrated a more complex pattern of binding than previously noted for this ligand. Using a fluorescence assay, we found that FDDNP demonstrates binding to the Aβ fibrils consistent with the presence of a single population of sites and a KdFLINT2 of ~300 nm (Fig. 4B, inset). This finding is significantly different from that reported by Agdeppa et al. (8Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Liu J. Flores-Torres S. Satyamurthy N. Petric A. Cole G.M. Small G.W. Huang S.C. Barrio J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who determined that there were two binding sites on the Aβ fibrils for FDDNP with Kd values of 0.12 and 1.86 nm using a similar fluorescence assay format and range of ligand concentrations. When the current dataset was fitted to a two-site binding model, one of the derived Kd values was greater than the highest ligand concentration used in the FLINT2 assay, indicating that the application of this more complex model was incorrect. We have no explanation for the difference in the two sets of data other than to note the alternative analysis methods used. In our work no manipulation of the data was performed other than to subtract the background fluorescence of the ligand in the absence of fibrils followed by fitting of the data using nonlinear regression methods to a single-site binding model. In contrast, Agdeppa et al. (8Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Liu J. Flores-Torres S. Satyamurthy N. Petric A. Cole G.M. Small G.W. Huang S.C. Barrio J.R. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: RC189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) analyzed their raw data using a more complex series of calculations to determine, first, the free concentration of ligand (17Yang X. Liu W.H. Jin W.J. Shen G.L. Yu R.Q. Spectrochim. Acta A Mol. Biomol. Spectrosc. 1999; 55: 2719-2727Crossref Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and then to use those values to construct Scatchard plots from which the binding constants were determined. Moreover, three lines of evidence indicate that the binding site for FDDNP detected by the FLINT assays has properties broadly consistent with that of BS1. First, the ratio of KdFLINT1: KdFLINT2, which is an estimate of binding site density on the fibrils (1 site per ~45 Aβ monomers), is similar to that noted previously for this site (average 1 site per ~35 Aβ monomers) (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). Second, the KdFLINT2 value for FDDNP is very similar to its KiFL-TT value. Finally, PIB was demonstrated to possess similar Ki values when either thioflavin T or FDDNP was used as fluorescence tracers. Taken together the data clearly indicate that there are indeed two classes of ligand binding sites on the Aβ fibrils for FDDNP. However, only one of these sites can be detected using fluorescence based assay techniques (BS1), whereas the second site is sensitive to radioligand assays (BS3). In addition, ligand affinity for these sites is significantly weaker than that reported previously. This observation may in part explain the low signal-to-noise ratio observed with this ligand in in vivo imaging studies compared with that observed with the higher affinity ligand PIB (16Mathis C.A. Wang Y. Klunk W.E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2004; 10: 1469-1492Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). Our findings are further differentiated from those reported previously with respect to the ability of non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs such as (S)-naproxen and (S)-ibuprofen ((S)-(+)-2-(4-isobutylphenyl)propionic acid) to displace FDDNP from Aβ fibrils. Both of these structurally related drugs have been reported to displace [18F]FDDNP from Aβ fibrils with Ki values of 5.7 nm and 11 μm (9Agdeppa E.D. Kepe V. Petri A. Satyamurthy N. Liu J. Huang S.C. Small G.W. Cole G.M. Barrio J.R. Neuroscience. 2003; 117: 723-730Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). In contrast, our data demonstrate that (S)-naproxen only competes with FDDNP at very high concentrations (KiFL-FD > 20 μm), and in addition (S)-ibuprofen at concentrations of up to 100 μm is unable to displace any FDDNP from the Aβ fibrils (data not shown). FDDNP and (S)-naproxen differ in their substituents at the 2 and 6 position of the naphthyl ring (see Fig. 1) whereas(S)-ibuprofen and (S)-naproxen share an identical propionic acid group at the 2 position of their respective phenyl and naphthyl rings. The apparent lack of activity in the displacement assay of (S)-ibuprofen and the weak activity of (S)-naproxen strongly suggest that the 2 position does not significantly contribute to binding specificity or affinity and that the fluoroethyl-substituted amino group at position 6 of the naphthyl ring is the major determinant of ligand binding for this class of imaging agents. The pattern of BSB binding to the Aβ fibrils in the fluorescence assays was also consistent with our previously published model of ligand binding sites. The ratio KdFLINT1:KdFLINT2 for this ligand was ~3, which is consistent with that observed for ligands which interact with BS2, such as TZDM, TZPI, and BF1 (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). These latter three compounds all contain a halogen substituent on their aromatic ring systems, and this feature we believe determines their binding specificity for this site. Despite the different backbone structure of BSB compared with the halogenated thioflavin T derivatives, the Congo Red derivative also contains a bromide atom directly conjugated to one of its aromatic rings. The importance of the positioning of the halogen group is evinced through the observation that, although it has one, the halogen substituent of FDDNP is not directly conjugated to the aromatic ring system, and hence, the ligand does not show the same binding pattern as that observed for TZDM, TZPI, and BF1 (or BSB). BSB does, however, differ slightly in its ability to displace thioflavin T compared with TZDM, TZPI, and BF1. These halogen-substituted thioflavin T derivatives were found to displace around half of the fluorescent tracer (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), whereas BSB displaces almost fully. The ability of BSB to displace more of the tracer may be due to the significantly greater size of the molecule. Evidence from our previous work indicated that BS2 ligands could not only displace compounds from BS1 but that there was also a FRET signal between the sites, indicating that a significant proportion of the sites were also in close proximity to each other (12Lockhart A. Ye L. Judd D.B. Merritt A.T. Lowe P. Morgenstern J.L. Hong G. Gee A.D. Brown J. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 280: 7677-7684Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). It may, therefore, be that the greater molecular size of BSB fully occludes the BS1 sites when bound to the fibrils. In conclusion, the data from this study have established that BS1, BS2, and BS3 are able to bind a wider range of compound structures than previously realized. This finding resolves the issue surrounding the ability of different chemotype classes to displace each other from Aβ fibrils. Second, the data questions the presence of a unique class of binding sites for aminonaphthalene compounds such as FDDNP by identifying both BS1 and BS3 as the major sites of interaction on the Aβ fibril. These results demonstrate that a thorough analysis of in vitro data is an important prerequisite in the selection of compounds for in vivo studies.

https://openalex.org/W1974084078,"The Drosophila melanogaster anterior-posterior axis becomes polarized early during oogenesis by the posterior localization of the oocyte within the egg chamber. The invariant position of the oocyte is thought to be driven by an upregulation of the adhesion molecule DE-cadherin in the oocyte and the posterior somatic follicle cells, providing the first in vivo example of cell sorting that is specified by quantitative differences in cell-cell adhesion. However, it has remained unclear how DE-cadherin levels are regulated. Here, we show that talin, known for its role in linking integrins to the actin cytoskeleton, has the unexpected function of specifically inhibiting DE-cadherin transcription. Follicle cells that are mutant for talin show a strikingly high level of DE-cadherin, due to elevated transcription of DE-cadherin. We demonstrate that this deregulation of DE-cadherin is sufficient to attract the oocyte to lateral and anterior positions. Surprisingly, this function of talin is independent of integrins. These results uncover a new role for talin in regulating cadherin-mediated cell adhesion."
https://openalex.org/W1984533562,"MAPK cascades play the critical role in regulating Ras oncogene activity by phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms. Whereas the ERK MAPK pathway is required for Ras transformation, our previous works established that the p38 activity is inhibitory to Ras signaling in both experimental and ras-mutated cancer cells (Chen, G., Hitomi, M., Han, J., and Stacey, D.

Here we report that K-Ras activated p38γ, a p38 MAPK family member, by inducing its expression without increasing its phosphorylation and that depletion of induced p38γ suppressed Ras transformation in rat intestinal epithelial cells. This p38γ activity contrasts with that of its family member, p38α, which is activated by Ras through phosphorylation, leading to an inhibition of Ras transformation. Mechanistic analyses showed that unphosphorylated p38γ may promote Ras transformation through an increased complex formation with ERK proteins. Significantly, functional p38γ protein was expressed only in K-ras-mutated human colon cancer cells, and p38γ transcripts were ubiquitously increased in a set of primary human colon cancer tissues. These studies thus demonstrate the essential role of p38γ in K-Ras transformation independent of phosphorylation, and elevated p38γ may serve as a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for human colon cancer.

Secondly, expression levels of p38γ mRNA and/or protein are increased by a differentiation-associated process, an effect distinct from all other MAPKs (14Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J. Moller N.P.

Furthermore, elevation of p38γ concentration by transfection, in the absence of upstream activators, induces C2C12 cell differentiation (14Lechner C. Zahalka M.A. Giot J. Moller N.P. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 4355-4359Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). These results together suggest that in addition to phosphorylation-dependent kinase activity (17Wang X.

The Ras family of proteins consists of three isoforms (H-, K-, and N-Ras) that play a critical role in controlling normal and malignant cell growth (24Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Science. 1993; 366: 643-654Google Scholar). K-ras mutation is one of the most common abnormal genetic events in human cancer, with the highest incidence in pancreatic carcinomas (90%) and colorectal tumors (50%) (25Bos J.L. Fearon E.R.

Cancer. 2003; 3: 11-22Crossref PubMed Scopus (2544) Google Scholar). MAPKs (ERK, JNK, and p38) are the best-characterized signal pathways in transduction and regulation of Ras activity (12Chang L.

ERK/MAPK activation has been shown to be both necessary and sufficient in transforming experimental NIH 3T3 cells (28Mansour S. Matten W.T. Hermann A.S. Candia J.M. Rong S. Fukasawa K.

Cell. 1994; 77: 841-852Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar), whereas the JNK pathway is also required for Ras transformation (30Pruitt K. Pruitt W.M. Bilter G.K. Westwick J.K.

On the contrary, activation of p38 MAPK is antagonistic to Ras activity, including inhibition of Ras-induced proliferation in NIH 3T3 cells (6Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), suppression of Ras transformation in RIE cells (30Pruitt K. Pruitt W.M. Bilter G.K. Westwick J.K.

In this study, we sought to test the hypothesis that endogenous p38 family members may regulate Ras activity by an isoform-specific mechanism. Our results showed that in contrast to p38α, K-Ras activates p38γ by inducing its expression without increasing its phosphorylation, and induced p38γ is required for K-Ras transformation by a mechanism possibly involving a complex formation with ERK proteins. Cell culture materials were supplied by Invitrogen and chemicals purchased from Sigma. Fetal bovine serum was obtained from BioWhittaker. Protein Sepharose G and protein A-Sepharose 4B beads were purchased from Zymed Laboratories Inc.. p38-specific antibodies were described previously (17Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S.

ERK1 and ERK2 antibodies were from Santa Cruz. p-p38 and p-ERK antibodies were from Cell Signaling. Rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6, mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3, human colon cancer HCT116, and HT-29 cells were purchased from American Type Culture Collection and maintained in modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics at 37 °C, 5% CO2. FLAG-tagged p38 isoform cDNAs in pcDNA3 vector and their dominant negative AGF counterparts were previously described (17Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S.

The adenovirus vector containing HA-tagged constitutively active MKK6 was used as previously described (17Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32Qi X. Tang J. Pramanik R. Schultz R.M. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol.

HA-tagged K-Ras and H-Ras cDNAs (both with G12V mutation) were provided by Guthrie cDNA Resource Center and subcloned into retroviral vector LZRS (33Tang J. Gordon G.M. Muller M.G. Dahiya M. Foreman K.E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5975-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Retroviral vector pLHCX was used to express the wild-type and non-phosphorylated p38γ cDNA as previously described (34Hayakawa J. Depatie C. Ohmichi M. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20582-20592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). After transfection into Phoenix-Ampo retrovirus packaging cells (American Type Culture Collection), supernatants were used to infect IEC-6 and NIH 3T3 cells. To establish stable Ras-transformed cell lines, transduced cells were selected with puromycin for about 2 weeks. Morphological transformation following retroviral infection was examined under the phase-contrast microscope. For anchorage-independent growth, IEC6/K-Ras cells were either treated with different inhibitors for 24 h or infected with adenovirus (vector and Ad-MKK6) for 5 h or pSUPER siRNA overnight. 2 × 104 cells were plated in growth medium containing 0.33% Sea-plaque-agarose. Formation of multicellular colonies was visualized and quantitated about 2 weeks later (30Pruitt K. Pruitt W.M. Bilter G.K. Westwick J.K. Der C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 31808-31817Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The colonies formed on an entire 60-mm plate were photographed and manually counted, and the number of colonies/field shown came from two to three plates of one experiment and were analyzed for statistical significance using Student's t test. Similar results were obtained from at least two additional experiments. To analyze effects of p38γ overexpression on cell proliferation, normal IEC-6 cells were infected with the retrovirus pLHCX, pLHCX-p38γ, or pLHCX-p38γ/AGF. The protein expression was assessed by Western blot 48 h, and [3H]thymidine incorporation for DNA synthesis was determined 72 h later, as previously described (35Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M.

To assess effects of depleting endogenous p38γ protein on human colon cancer cell proliferation, HCT116 cells were infected with pSR or pSR-siRNA for 72 h. Cells were then pulse-incubated with [3H]thymidine, and DNA synthesis was measured (35Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged p38 isoforms, with and without K-Ras, and collected in modified radioimmune precipitation assay buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin). The FLAG precipitates were analyzed for p38 isoform protein expression using a FLAG antibody, for their phosphorylation using a specific p-p38 antibody, and for bound endogenous ERK/p-ERK proteins by Western blot. The endogenous phosphorylated p38 proteins were isolated with a mouse monoclonal p-p38-specific antibody, and precipitates were analyzed for the presence of p38α and p38γ using specific antibodies (17Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 18Pramanik R. Qi X. Borowicz S. Choubey D.

To isolate endogenous p38γ and p38α proteins, lysates were incubated with respective specific antibodies, and precipitates were examined for the presence of ERK/p-ERK protein by Western blot. To detect cellular distributions of ERK and p38γ, normal IEC-6 cells were transfected with HA-ERK1 in the presence and absence of FLAG-p38γ/AGF. Thereafter, cells were fixed and co-stained with mouse anti-FLAG antibody plus anti-mouse IgG Cy3 to detect transfected FLAG-p38γ/AGF and with anti-HA-IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugate to detect transfected HA-ERK1, as previously described (36Qi X. Borowicz S. Pramanik R. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 6769-6777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For Western blot analyses, cells were directly lysed in 1× loading buffer and separated on SDS-PAGE. All of the following procedures were the same as those described previously (18Pramanik R. Qi X.

Experiments with siRNA to Inhibit p38γ Expression—To deplete endogenous p38γ protein, retroviral vector pSR (VEC-pRT-0002; Oligo-Engine) was used as previously described (37Brummelkamp T.R. Bernards R. Agami R. Science. 2002; 296: 550-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (3971) Google Scholar). The target sequence (5′-AAGGAGATCATGAAGGTGACG-3′) was cloned into the pSR vector, which was transfected into the packaging cells to produce the virus-containing supernatants for infection, as we previously described (32Qi X. Tang J. Pramanik R. Schultz R.M. Shirasawa S. Sasazuki T. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 22138-22144Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Among four sequences analyzed, this siRNA yielded the most substantial effect on p38γ depletion in several cell types and was consequently used for all analyses. Typically, cells were analyzed for p38γ protein depletion 72 h after infection. For Northern blot, total RNA was prepared by using the TRIzol kit. Human p38γ cDNA was used to generate a 520-bp fragment by PCR (primers: forward, 5′-GGCTTTTACCGCCAGGAG-3′; reverse, 5′-GTCATCTCACTGTCTGCCTGCCT-3′). The probe was labeled with [32P]dCTP using the high Prime Kit and purified with Quick Spin Columns (35Qi X. Pramank R. Wang J. Schultz R.M. Maitra R.K. Han J. DeLuca H.F. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25884-25892Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). A matched tumor/normal expression array kit was purchased from Clontech (catalog number 7840-1). The membrane containing the matched cDNA samples was incubated with the [32P]dCTP-labeled p38γ probe according to the manufacturer's instructions. The specific radioactivity was measured with a PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Results were measured with Scion Image software and normalized by ubiquitin. To analyze signaling interactions between Ras and the p38 family, HA-tagged activated K-Ras and H-Ras cDNAs were subcloned into retroviral vector LZRS (33Tang J. Gordon G.M. Muller M.G. Dahiya M. Foreman K.E. J. Virol. 2003; 77: 5975-5984Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After transfection into Phoenix packaging cells, supernatants were used to infect rat intestinal epithelial IEC-6 and mouse fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells, followed by selection with puromycin. We used Western blot to examine these transfected cells for p38 family protein expression and phosphorylation. The specificity of p38 isoform-specific antibodies (17Wang X. McGowan C.H. Zhao M. He L. Downey J.S. Fearns C. Wang Y. Huang S. Han J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4543-4552Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) has been established in our previous publication (18Pramanik R. Qi X. Borowicz S. Choubey D. Schultz R.M. Han J. Chen G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4831-4839Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Results in Fig. 1A show that the predominant form of p38 in vector-transfected IEC-6 cells is p38α, with p38γ barely detectable, whereas p38α, p38β, and p38γ (but not p38δ; data not shown) proteins are expressed in NIH 3T3 cells. Consistent with our previous finding (6Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), increased p38 phosphorylation was observed in both cell lines transfected with either K-Ras or H-Ras oncogene, together with increased phosphorylated ERK proteins. Levels of total p38α and ERK1/2 proteins, however, remained relatively consistent with and without Ras transfections (Fig. 1A; data not shown). Surprisingly, p38γ protein expression was specifically induced by K-Ras in IEC-6 cells but not in NIH 3T3 cells, suggesting its potential role in K-Ras tumorigenesis in epithelial cells. Furthermore, levels of both p38γ protein (Fig. 1A) and p38γ RNA (Fig. 1B) were increased in K-Ras- as well as H-Ras-transfected IEC-6 cells, indicating a Ras isoform-independent p38γ induction. The p-p38 antibody used in the previous analysis reacts with all p38 family members dual-phosphorylated at the Thr and Tyr residues. A single phosphorylated p38 band around 39 kDa in IEC-6 cells (Fig. 1A) suggested that this p-protein may be p38α because only p38α and p38γ proteins are expressed in these cells, and p38γ (about 45 kDa) migrates more slowly than p-p38. To further confirm this speculation, an equal amount of lysates from the vector- and K-Ras-transfected IEC-6 cells was incubated with a mouse p-p38 antibody, and the precipitates were examined for their reactivity with a rabbit antibody against p38α, p38γ, and p-p38 by Western blot. Results in Fig. 1C show that the recovery of p38α was greater in K-Ras-transfected cells than that in mock-transfected cells, in which no change in p38γ was observed. These results thus demonstrate that K-Ras selectively induces p38α, not p38γ, phosphorylation in IEC-6 cells. So far, almost all studies of MAPK signaling have focused on regulation of MAPK activity by phosphorylation (12Chang L. Karin M. Nature. 2001; 410: 37-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (4420) Google Scholar, 38Hazzalin C.A. Mahadevan L.C. Nat. Rev. 2002; 3: 30-40Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). To understand mechanisms by which Ras-induced p38γ protein becomes unphosphorylated, a transient transfection experiment was performed. Normal IEC-6 cells in this case were transfected with FLAG-tagged p38 isoforms, with and without the K-Ras-expressing plasmid. The anti-FLAG precipitates were analyzed by Western blot for phosphorylation of transfected p38 proteins using a p-specific p38 antibody (Fig. 1D). Comparison of the FLAG-p38 (top panel) to the p-p38 band (bottom panel) shows that phosphorylated p38α and p38β signals were increased 1.7- and 3.2-fold by K-Ras, respectively. Surprisingly, K-Ras did not increase p38γ protein phosphorylation, but instead decreased its level by 60% (Fig. 1D, bottom panel). These experiments clearly demonstrated that K-Ras selectively phosphorylates p38α and p38β but dephosphorylates p38γ in these epithelial cells. Inhibition of p38γ phosphorylation by Ras may be due to limited amounts of endogenous upstream kinases to phosphorylate p38γ upon Ras transfection and/or Ras activation of p38γ-specific phosphatases, leading to its dephosphorylation. Stimulation of p38α phosphorylation and inhibition of p38γ phosphorylation by transient K-Ras expression provide an explanation for increased p38α phosphorylation and elevated unphosphorylated p38γ protein expression in stably transfected IEC6/K-Ras cells. That Ras induces p38γ protein expression without increasing its phosphorylation is a novel observation. To explore whether this induction is specific to Ras, normal IEC-6 cells were treated with mitogens (serum and TPA) and stresses (arsenite and tumor necrosis factor-α) and examined for p38γ protein expression by Western blotting. As shown in Fig. 2A, p38γ protein level was not increased by these stimuli, although ERK and/or p38/JNK phosphorylation was strongly increased under the same conditions (there was also no substantial p38γ protein increase 24 h later; data not shown). Interestingly, transient Ras infection led to a substantial p38γ protein elevation (Fig. 2B). Thus, p38γ protein expression is selectively induced by Ras oncogene and not by other mitogens, pointing to its potential role in Ras malignant transformation. Activated Ras induces cell transformation through its constitutively proliferative signaling. To explore whether p38γ alone is mitogenic or oncogenic by a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism, p38γ and its non-phosphorylated mutant p38γ/AGF were overexpressed in normal IEC-6 cells by retroviral vector pLHCX (34Hayakawa J. Depatie C. Ohmichi M. Mercola D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 20582-20592Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and their effects on cell proliferation were assessed by thymidine incorporation. Results in Fig. 2, C and D, show that higher levels of p38γ proteins have no significant effects on DNA synthesis (thymidine incorporation). Furthermore, p38γ overexpression did not lead to soft agar growth (data not shown). Consistent with this observation, both p38γ and p38γ/AGF did not increase ERK phosphorylation, which is strongly induced by TPA and serum (Fig. 2, A and C). These studies thus reveal that p38γ per se is not mitogenic or oncogenic. Previous studies by ourselves (6Chen G. Hitomi M. Han J. Stacey D.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 38973-38980Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 40Chen G. Templeton D. Suttle D.P. Stacey D.

Because Ras stimulates ERK/p38α phosphorylation and induces p38γ expression, we sought to explore whether p38γ is involved in their Ras regulatory activities. To explore potential roles of p38γ in these regulations, stable K-Ras-transformed IEC-6 cells (IEC6/K-Ras) were incubated with a specific ERK inhibitor, PD, or a p38α/β inhibitor, SB, and their effects on Ras transformation and p38γ protein expression were examined. PD treatment almost completely reversed the transformed morphology as compared with normal IEC-6 cells, whereas SB increased the transformation (cells became more refractile) (Fig. 3A). The morphological alterations were further confirmed by an increased soft agar formation by SB and a decreased anchorage-independent growth of IEC6/K-Ras cells by PD (Fig. 3B). Of great interest"

Subsequently, SATB1 was shown to repress many genes expressed in the thymus, including interleukin-2 receptor α, c-myc, and those encoded by mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV), a glucocorticoid-responsive retrovirus. SATB1 binds to MARs within the MMTV provirus to repress transcription. To address the role of the nuclear matrix in SATB1-mediated repression, a series of SATB1 deletion constructs was used to determine protein localization. Wild-type SATB1 localized to the soluble nuclear, chromatin, and nuclear matrix fractions. Mutants lacking amino acids 224–278 had a greatly diminished localization to the nuclear matrix, suggesting the presence of a nuclear matrix targeting sequence (NMTS). Transient transfection experiments showed that NMTS fusions to green fluorescent protein or LexA relocalized these proteins to the nuclear matrix. Difficulties with previous assay systems prompted us to develop retroviral vectors to assess effects of different SATB1 domains on expression of MMTV proviruses or integrated reporter genes. SATB1 overexpression repressed MMTV transcription in the presence and absence of functional glucocorticoid receptor. Repression was alleviated by deletion of the NMTS, which did not affect DNA binding, or by deletion of the MAR-binding domain. Our studies indicate that both nuclear matrix association and DNA binding are required for optimal SATB1-mediated repression of the integrated MMTV promoter and may allow insulation from cellular regulatory elements.

Mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) 1The abbreviations used are: MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; SATB1, special AT-rich binding protein 1; CDP, CCAAT-displacement protein; NRE, negative regulatory element; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; NMTS, nuclear matrix targeting sequence; MAR, nuclear matrix-associated region; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DEX, dexamethasone; ID, internal deletion; HRE, hormone responsive element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; siRNA, small interfering RNA. 1The abbreviations used are: MMTV, mouse mammary tumor virus; LTR, long terminal repeat; SATB1, special AT-rich binding protein 1; CDP, CCAAT-displacement protein; NRE, negative regulatory element; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; NMTS, nuclear matrix targeting sequence; MAR, nuclear matrix-associated region; NLS, nuclear localization signal; DEX, dexamethasone; ID, internal deletion; HRE, hormone responsive element; DBD, DNA-binding domain; siRNA, small interfering RNA. transcription is controlled by regions largely found within the U3 region of the long terminal repeat (LTR) (1Dudley J.P. Webster R.G. Granoff A. The Encyclopedia of Virology. Academic Press, New York, NY1999: 965-972Google Scholar). The MMTV LTR promoter is a paradigm for hormone-regulated transcription (2Kinyamu H.K. Archer T.K. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2004; 1677: 30-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Addition of glucocorticoids to virally infected cells results in a 10- to 50-fold increase in transcription that is dependent on transient binding of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to a hormone-response element (HRE) (3Parks W.P. Scolnick E.M. Kozikowski E.H. Science. 1974; 184: 158-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Ligand-bound GR allows chromatin-remodeling events that then lead to NF1 and Oct1 binding upstream of the LTR transcription start site (4Truss M. Bartsch J. Schelbert A. Hache R.J. Beato M. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1737-1751Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). Previous work by our group has shown that MMTV transcription is highest in the lactating mammary gland, intermediate in reproductive and lymphoid tissues, and undetectable in brain, heart, liver, and skeletal muscle (5Henrard D.

However, MMTV transcription is suppressed in specific tissues by the presence of several negative regulatory elements (NREs) located upstream of the HRE in the viral LTR (6Ross S.R. Hsu C.L. Choi Y.

Dorf M.E. Benjamin T.L. J. Exp. Med. 1995; 181: 1683-1692Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Deletion of one or more NREs leads to increased MMTV expression in non-permissive tissues as well as cell lines derived from semipermissive tissues (6Ross S.R. Hsu C.L. Choi Y. Mok E. Dudley J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 5822-5829Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Bramblett D. Hsu C.L. Lozano M. Earnest K. Fabritius C. Dudley J. J.

In addition, MMTV strains that lack the NREs induce primarily T-cell lymphomas rather than breast cancer (8Hsu C.L. Fabritius C. Dudley J. J. Virol. 1988; 62: 4644-4652Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), yet mammotropic strains require replication in B and T cells for transmission to mammary cells (13Dudley J. Risser R. J.

Varmus H.E. Retroviruses. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1997: 205-261Google Scholar), negative regulation of viral transcription must be controlled by cellular proteins.

CDP overexpression in mammary or fibroblastic cells results in suppression of MMTV LTR-reporter gene expression both in the presence and absence of glucocorticoids (28Zhu Q. Gregg K. Lozano M. Liu J.

Mutations in CDP-binding sites found within the promoter-proximal and promoter-distal NREs elevate MMTV transcription (29Zhu Q. Dudley J.P. J. Virol. 2002; 76: 2168-2179Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). CDP also is differentially expressed during development of the mammary gland, and CDP DNA-binding activity is high in virgin mammary tissue, where MMTV transcription is low. Conversely, MMTV RNA expression is highest in the lactating mammary gland, a tissue in which CDP DNA-binding activity for the MMTV LTR is undetectable (28Zhu Q. Gregg K. Lozano M. Liu J. Dudley J.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6348-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Loss of CDP-binding sites within the NREs elevates MMTV transcription in the mammary gland and accelerates tumorigenesis (32Zhu Q. Maitra U. Johnston D. Lozano M. Dudley J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 4810-4823Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Therefore, CDP is an important regulator of MMTV expression in the mammary gland. The transcription factor, SATB1, also binds to the MMTV NRE within MAR sequences (9Liu J. Bramblett D. Zhu Q. Lozano M. Kobayashi R. Ross S.R. Dudley J.P. Mol. Cell.

SATB1 was first isolated as a factor that bound to the nuclear matrix attachment region (MAR) 3′ of the immunoglobulin heavy chain intronic enhancer (25Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), but also has been implicated in the tissue-specific expression of many genes (33Alvarez J.D.

Cell. 1992; 70: 631-645Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (449) Google Scholar), a tissue that is semi-permissive for MMTV expression, yet little SATB1 is expressed in the mammary glands, a target tissue for high levels of viral transcription (9Liu J.

SATB1-null mice are small in size and have disproportionately small thymi and spleens (33Alvarez J.D. Yasui D.H. Niida H. Joh T. Loh D.Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 521-535PubMed Google Scholar). Approximately 9 of 10 genes surveyed by reverse transcription-PCR had increased expression in SATB1-null thymocytes (33Alvarez J.D. Yasui D.H. Niida H. Joh T. Loh D.Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Genes Dev. 2000; 14: 521-535PubMed Google Scholar), consistent with repressor function. SATB1 appears to function as a homodimer (38Galande S. Dickinson L.A. Mian I.S. Sikorska M. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 5591-5604Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and the N-terminal dimerization sequence may be involved in signaling through protein-protein interactions (39Nourry C. Grant S.G. Borg J.P. Sci. STKE 2003. 2003; : RE7Google Scholar). Recently, it was shown that SATB1 recruits chromatin remodeling complexes such as nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase complex, chromatin-accessibility complex, and ATP-utilizing chromatin assembly and remodeling factor (40Yasui D. Miyano M. Cai S. Varga-Weisz P. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nature. 2002; 419: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar). These chromatin remodeling complexes were suggested to suppress gene expression through histone deacetylation and nucleosome positioning on SATB1-bound sites (40Yasui D. Miyano M. Cai S. Varga-Weisz P. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nature. 2002; 419: 641-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (386) Google Scholar, 41Cai S. Han H.J. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Nat. Genet. 2003; 34: 42-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). SATB1 associates with the nuclear matrix (42de Belle I. Cai S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar), an insoluble nuclear structure that is important for many cellular events, including regulation of gene expression and replication (43Berezney R.

However, the effect of SATB1 association with the nuclear matrix on transcriptional repression has not been demonstrated. In this report, we have identified a domain that plays a dominant role in SATB1 binding to the nuclear matrix. Deletion of this nuclear matrix targeting sequence (NMTS) partially relieved SATB1-mediated transcriptional suppression of integrated MMTV proviruses or MMTV LTR-reporter plasmids even in the presence of positive activators, such as ligand-bound GR. Plasmid Constructions—The plasmid pMTV-LUC (also called pLC-LUC) contains the C3H MMTV LTR upstream of firefly luciferase (11Bramblett D. Hsu C.L. Lozano M. Earnest K. Fabritius C. Dudley J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7868-7876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Full-length SATB1 cDNA from pMAT (47Liu J. Barnett A. Neufeld E.J. Dudley J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4918-4926Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was inserted into the EcoRI site of pUHD10-3 (48Era T. Witte O.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1737-1742Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) to produce pUHD10-3/SATB1. SATB1(1–345) and SATB1(1–494) deletion mutants were constructed by digesting full-length SATB1 cDNA with ScaI or AseI, respectively, followed by treatment with Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I to fill in the overhangs. Each fragment then was ligated to pUHD10-3 that had been digested with EcoRI and treated with Klenow to blunt the ends. The internal deletion mutant, ID(346–494), was constructed by digestion of full-length SATB1 cDNA with ScaI and AseI, and mung bean nuclease treatment was used to generate blunt ends that were ligated. The deletion mutant was then inserted into pUHD10-3 after digestion with EcoRI and Klenow treatment. The plasmid pUHD10-3/SATB1 was digested with EcoNI followed by mung bean nuclease treatment to prepare ID(274–410). The plasmid pUHD10-3/SATB1 was digested with EcoNI and BamHI, treated with Klenow polymerase to blunt the ends, and religated to generate SATB1(1–274). The plasmids SATB1(1–224), SATB1(55–764), SATB1(168–764), SATB1(275–764), and SATB1(510–764) were constructed using PCR with the following primer pairs: SATB199EGFP and SA870DO, SA631UP and SA2497DO, SA700UP and SA2497DO, SA1021AUG and SA2497DO, and SA1723+ and SA2497DO, respectively. The PCR products were digested with EcoRI and inserted into the EcoRI site of pUHD10-3. The NMTS deletion mutant, ID(224–278), was constructed using recombinant PCR (11Bramblett D. Hsu C.L. Lozano M. Earnest K. Fabritius C. Dudley J. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 7868-7876Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, two fragments were separately amplified from the SATB1 cDNA with SA196+ and SA867– and SA1033+ and SA2497DO. The NMTS was deleted in a second PCR step with SA196+ and SA2497DO primers using the first PCR products as a template. To make pGFP-NMTS and pLexA-NMTS, the NMTS of SATB1 was amplified by PCR with Sagfp865+ and SA1032– and Sagal865+ and SA1032–, respectively. To prepare pGFP-SATB1, pGFP-SATB1(1–55), and pGFP-SATB1(1–224), fragments were amplified by PCR using primer pairs SATB199EGFP and SA2497DO, SATB199EGFP and SA363DO, and SATB199EGFP and SA870DO, respectively. The products were cloned into the EcoR1 site of pEGFPC1 or pLexA (both from Clontech). Full-length SATB1 cDNA was PCR-amplified with SA196+ and SA2497DO using pMAT as a template and inserted into the EcoRI site of MigR1 (49Taichman R.S. Torigoe T. Reed J.C. BioTechniques. 1993; 14: 180-182PubMed Google Scholar) to produce the retroviral expression vector, MigR1-SATB1. The ΔNMTS and ΔDBD cDNAs were obtained from ID(224–278) and ID(346–474) for cloning into the EcoRI site of MigR1 to construct MigR1-ΔNMTS and MigR1-ΔDBD. High fidelity, Pfu Turbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) was used for all PCRs as recommended by the manufacturer. Platinum Pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) was used for the second round of recombinant PCR. The final clones were verified by sequencing and restriction enzyme digestions. All restriction enzymes and Klenow DNA polymerase were obtained from NEB. Sequences of PCR primers mentioned above are as follows: SATB199EGFP (5′-CGG AAT TCA CTG AGT ATG GAT CAT TTG AAC-3′); SA363DO (5′-GGC GAA TTC TTA CAC TCC CTG CAT CTT TCC-3′); SA870DO (5′-GGC GAA TTC TTA GTA CGT GCT GTT CAC AAT G-3′); SA631UP (5′-GCG AAT TCC TGA GTA TGG TGC CTT TAA AAC ACT CG-3′); SA2497DO (5′-CGG AAT TCT CTC TCA GTC TTT CAA GTC G-3′); SA700UP (5′-GCG AAT TCC TGA GTA TGA TTC AGT TAC ACA GTT GC-3′); SA1021AUG (5′-GCG AAT TCC TGA GTA TGC CAG GAA ACA CAG CTG AG-3′); SA196+ (5′-CGG AAT TCA GTA TGG ATC ATT TGA ACG AG-3′); SA867–(5′-CTG CTC AGC CGT GCT GTT CAC AAT GGA G-3′); SA1033+ (5′-AAC AGC ACG GCT GAG CAG CCT CCA TCC-3′); Sagfp865+ (5′-CGG AAT TCT ACG TAC TAT GCA AAT GTC-3′); SA1032–(5′-CTG AAT TCT GTG TTT CCT GGG ACA GG-3′); Sagal865+ (5′-CGG AAT TCA CGT ACT ATG CAA ATG TC-3′); SA1723+ (5′-CGG AAT TCA GTA TGG CTA AAG TGT CCC AAG CAC C-3′). Cell Culture and Transfections—The cell lines MCF-7/Tet-off (Clontech), XC, and 293T were grown at 37 °C in 7.5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (29Zhu Q.

Growth conditions for HC11 (28Zhu Q. Gregg K. Lozano M. Liu J. Dudley J.P. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6348-6357Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and Jurkat cells (9Liu J. Bramblett D. Zhu Q. Lozano M. Kobayashi R. Ross S.R. Dudley J.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 5275-5287Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar) have been described before. MCF-7/Tet-off cells were grown in media supplemented with 100 μg/ml G418 to maintain the transactivator plasmid as recommended by the supplier. Cells were plated at a density of 7.5 × 105 cells (XC) or 4 × 106 cells (MCF-7/Tet-off) per 60-mm plate for 24 h prior to transfection. The pUHD10-3/SATB1 or SATB1 mutant (6 μg) and pUHD15–1/hygro (4 μg) constructs or only pUHD10-3/SATB1 construct (6 μg) were introduced into XC or MCF-7/Tet-off cells, respectively, using DMRIE-C reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The transfected cells were incubated for 24–48 h before analysis. XC cells were infected with purified MMTV virions (C3H strain) to produce XC/MMTV cells. The HC11/MTV-LUC and XC/MTV-LUC cells were generated by transfection of HC11 mouse mammary cells or XC rat fibroblasts, respectively, with pTR174 containing the hygromycin-resistance cassette and pMTV-LUC (pLC-LUC). The Jurkat/MTV-LUC cells were obtained by transfection of Jurkat cells with pMTV-LUC modified by insertion of a hygromycin-resistance cassette in the vector backbone (pMTV-LUC/Hyg). Stably transfected cells were selected in the presence of 250 μg/ml hygromycin B for ∼3 weeks. Resistant colonies were pooled and used for analysis. Jurkat/MTV-LUC cells were electroporated with 600 nm SATB1-specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Dharmacon, SMART pool siRNA) or a non-targeting siRNA (Dharmacon, siCONTROL Non-Targeting siRNA #1). Mock treatment consisted of electroporation in the absence of siRNA. Cells were incubated for 60 h in RPMI medium containing 2% fetal bovine serum prior to preparation of protein extracts for Western blotting and luciferase assays. Subcellular Fractionation—Subcellular fractions were prepared according to the method of de Belle et al. (42de Belle I. Cai S. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 335-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) with slight modifications. MCF-7/Tet-off cells transfected with full-length or mutant SATB1 expression constructs were treated with 0.5% Triton X-100 in CSK buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm EGTA) supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 1× protease inhibitor mixture (Sigma, 4-(2-aminoethyl)benzenesulfonylfluoride hydrochloride, bestatin, E-64, leupeptin, pepstatin A, and 1,10-phenanthroline) on ice. The supernatant was recovered after centrifugation and referred to as the soluble fraction. The insoluble fraction was suspended in CSK buffer and treated with 20 units of DNase I (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min at 37 °C, and ammonium sulfate was added to a final concentration of 0.25 m. The soluble material was referred to as the chromatin fraction, and the insoluble fraction was washed with 2 m NaCl. The remainder (nuclear matrix fraction) was dissolved in 8 m urea and 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The same proportion of each fraction was analyzed on denaturing polyacrylamide gels. Fluorescence Microscopy—HC11 mouse mammary cells were transfected with plasmids encoding GFP alone or GFP fused to wild-type or mutant SATB1 proteins. After 24–48 h, cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 300 nm 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, and washed extensively in phosphate-buffered saline. Coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories) and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Western Blotting and Antibodies—Immunoblotting was performed according to standard procedures. Protein samples were mixed with 6× Laemmli buffer (0.35 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% SDS, 36% glycerol, 0.6 m dithiothreitol, and 0.012% bromphenol blue), boiled, and separated on denaturing polyacrylamide gels (percentage varied from 8 to 15%) containing 0.1% SDS prior to transfer onto nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell). Nonspecific binding to the membrane was blocked with TBST buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) containing 5% nonfat dry milk prior to incubation with primary antibodies (mouse monoclonal SATB1 (BD Biosciences), polyclonal goat anti-SATB1 (Santa Cruz) or polyclonal rabbit anti-SATB1 (34Banan M.

Subsequently, the nitrocellulose membranes were washed and incubated with secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Jackson Immunoresearch) for 30 min. Enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) were used for antibody detection. For quantitation, Western blots were incubated with GFP-specific or lamin B-specific antibodies, washed, and incubated with Alexa Fluor 680-conjugated rabbit immunoglobulin-specific (Molecular Probes) or IRDye800-conjugated goat immunoglobulin-specific (Rockland) antibodies. Band intensities were determined using infrared fluorescence and an Odyssey imaging system (LI-COR Biotechnology). Blocking buffer (LI-COR) was used for pretreatment of blots and antibody dilution. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Gel mobility shift assays were performed essentially as described by Dickinson et al. (25Dickinson L.A. Joh T. Kohwi Y. Kohwi-Shigematsu T.

https://openalex.org/W1968307241,"We investigated the role of two MAP kinases, ERK2 and p38, in platelet adhesion and spreading over collagen matrix in static and blood flow conditions. P38 was involved in collagen-induced platelet adhesion and spreading in static adhesion conditions, whereas ERK2 was not. In blood flow conditions, with shear rates of 300 or 1500 s–1, ERK2 and p38 displayed differential involvement in platelet adhesion, depending on the presence or absence of the von Willebrand factor (vWF). Low collagen coverage densities (0.04 μg/cm2) did not support vWF binding. During perfusions over this surface, platelet adhesion was not affected by the inhibition of ERK2 phosphorylation by PD 98059. However, abolishing p38 activation by SB 203580 treatment reduced platelet adhesion by 67 ± 9% at 300 s–1 and 56 ± 2% at 1500 s–1. In these conditions, the p38 activity required for platelet adhesion depends on the α2β1 collagen receptor. At higher collagen coverage densities (0.8 μg/cm2) supporting vWF binding, the inhibition of ERK2 activity by PD 98059 decreased adhesion by 47 ± 6% at 300 s–1 and 72 ± 3% at 1500 s–1, whereas p38 inhibition had only a small effect. The ERK2 activity required for platelet adhesion was dependent on the interaction of vWF with GPIb. In conclusion, ERK2 and p38 have complementary effects in the control of platelet adhesion to collagen in a shear stress-dependent manner.

In conclusion, ERK2 and p38 have complementary effects in the control of platelet adhesion to collagen in a shear stress-dependent manner. The adhesion and aggregation of platelets in response to vascular injury plays a key role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Fibrillar collagen is the most abundant thrombogenic molecule among the macromolecular constituents of the subendothelial layer. Following exposure to collagen, platelets rapidly adhere, spread, become active, and then aggregate (1Rauterberg J. Jaeger E. Althaus M. Curr. Top. Pathol. 1993; : 163-192PubMed Google Scholar, 2Baumgartner H.R. Tschopp T.B. Weiss H.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1977; 37: 17-28Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This interaction of collagen with platelets is both direct and indirect. Under the high shear stress conditions found in small arteries, the von Willebrand factor (vWF), 1The abbreviations used are: vWF, von Willebrand factor; PAK, p21-activated kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; Hsp, heat-shock protein; LT, lethal toxin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GP, glycoprotein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. 1The abbreviations used are: vWF, von Willebrand factor; PAK, p21-activated kinase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase; Hsp, heat-shock protein; LT, lethal toxin; BSA, bovine serum albumin; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate; GP, glycoprotein; mAb, monoclonal antibody; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate; MEK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase; MAP, mitogen-activated protein. which binds to newly exposed collagen fibers, is required to capture flowing platelets (3Savage B. Saldivar E. Ruggeri Z.M. Cell. 1996; 84: 289-297Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1008) Google Scholar) via the GPIb-IX-V complex on the platelet surface. This interaction (vWF-GPIb) cannot support the assembly of a stable platelet thrombus. Subsequent firm platelet adhesion and activation are mediated by two major surface receptors for collagen, the integrin α2β1 and glycoprotein VI (4Farndale R.W. Sixma J.J. Barnes M.J. De Groot P.G. J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 2004; 2: 561-573Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar, 5Watson S.P. Gibbins J. Immunol.

Platelets in Thrombotic and Non-thrombotic Disorders: Pathophysiology, Pharmacology, and Therapeutics. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK2002: 158-178Google Scholar). The relative contributions of these two receptors to collagen-mediated adhesion are unclear, and various models have been proposed (7Saelman E.U. Nieuwenhuis H.K. Hese K.M. De Groot P.G. Heijmen H.F. Sage E.H. Williams S. McKeown L. Gralnick H.R. Sixma J.J. Blood. 1994; 83: 1244-1250Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). According to the two-site, two-step model, the major candidate for involvement in platelet deposition and stabilization on collagen is α2β1, with GPVI mediating activation and initiating the signaling pathway involved in thrombus formation (8Moroi M. Jung S.M. Shinmyozu K. Tomiyama Y. Ordinas A. Diaz-Ricart M. Blood. 1996; 88: 2081-2092Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Platelet activation leads to an increase in the affinity of α2β1, which in turn leads to an increase in adhesion stability. Another model has been proposed in which the absence of functional GPVI impairs adhesion under static and shear conditions (9Nieswandt B. Brakebusch C. Bergmeier W. Schulte V. Bouvard D.

Circulation. 2002; 106: 266-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In this model, GPVI initiates signaling pathways, leading to the activation of the α2β1 integrin and of other integrins involved in firm adhesion at sites of vascular injury (11Nieswandt S. Watson S.P. Blood. 2003; 102: 449-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (895) Google Scholar). However, the intracellular signaling pathway occurring during platelet adhesion and spreading on collagen is poorly understood. The small GTP-binding proteins Cdc42/Rac and the effector p21-activated kinases (PAKs) play an important role in the spreading of platelet lamellipodia over the collagen matrix (12Suzuki-Inoue K. Yatomi Y. Asazuma N. Kainoh M. Tanaka T. Satoh K. Ozaki Y. Blood. 2001; 98: 3708-3716Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), and the Cdc42/Rac-dependent activation of PAK involves cortactin (13Vidal C. Geny B. Melle J. Jandrot-Perrus M. Fontenay-Roupie M. Blood. 2002; 100: 4462-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). A model of intracellular events during α2β1-mediated platelet spreading has been described recently (14Inoue O. Suzuki-Inoue K. Dean W.L. Frampton J. Watson S.P. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 769-780Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). In this model, the α2β1 integrin mediates the activation of Src family kinases and Syk upstream from phospholipase Cγ2 and the Ca2+ mobilization required for platelet spreading. A second pathway may also involve phosphorylation of the tyrosine kinase focal adhesion kinase. MAP kinases are involved in signaling for cell adhesion and spreading. They belong to a serine/threonine kinase family that includes the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAP kinase (15Rossomando A.J. Payne D.M. Weber M.J. Sturgill T.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6940-6943Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In proliferative cells, MAP kinase signaling is essential for normal cell adhesion and spreading and is regulated by growth factors and integrins (16Cobb M.H. Boulton T.G. Robbins D.J. Cell Regul. 1991; 2: 965-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar). In platelets, ERK2, JNK1, and p38 are present and activated by various agonists (17Nadal F. Levy-Toledano S. Grelac F.

Haemostasis. 2004; 91: 102-110Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but their role in hemostatic biology and pathology remains unclear. ERK2 has been reported to be involved in the maintenance of low thrombin levels, collagen-induced platelet aggregation, and the activation of αIIbβ3 by vWF ristocetin and thrombin (20Li Z. Xi D. Du X. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 42226-42232Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 21Li Z. Xi D. Gu M. Feil R. Ye R.D. Eigenthaler M. Hofmann F. Du X.

FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Moreover, P2X1-mediated ERK2 activation amplifies collagen-induced platelet secretion by enhancing myosin light chain kinase activation (23Toth-Zsamboki E. Oury C. Conelessen H. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 46661-46667Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). In transgenic mice overexpressing the P2X1 receptor, injection of a mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor protects against lethal pulmonary thromboembolism provoked by collagen and epinephrine (24Oury C. Kuijpers M. Toth-Zsamboki E. Bonnefoy A. Danloy S. Vreys I. Feijge A.H. De Vos R. Vermylen J. Heemskerk J.W. Hoylaerts M. Blood. 2003; 101: 3969-3976Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). It also regulates store-mediated Ca2+ entry in platelets (25Rosado J.A. Sage S.O. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 15659-15665Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In contrast to these studies implicating ERK2, Watson and co-workers (26Borsch-Haubold A.G. Kramer R.M. Watson S.P. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) suggested that inhibition of the ERK pathway does not impair the primary activation of human platelets. GPIb-dependent platelet activation has been reported to be dependent on Src kinases but not MAP kinases (27Marshall S.J. Senis Y.A. Auger J.M. Feil R. Hofmann F. Salmon G. Peterson T. Burslem F. Watson S.P. Blood. 2004; 103: 2601-2609Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The other MAP kinase, p38, is involved in collagen-induced platelet aggregation (28Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 6586-6589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) and procoagulant activity (29Siljander P. Farndale R.W. Feijge M.A. Comfurius P. Kos S. Bevers E.M. Heemskerk J.W. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2001; 21: 618-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). JNK1 has no known role in platelets. We investigated the roles of p38 and ERK2 in platelet adhesion and spreading over a collagen matrix in static and blood flow conditions. We found that both p38 and ERK2 were involved in platelet adhesion. The role of p38 in platelet adhesion and spreading was independent of blood flow and involved the α2β1 integrin. In contrast, the role of ERK2 was dependent on blood flow and vWF-GPIb interaction. We describe here, for the first time, complementary roles for ERK2 and p38 in platelet adhesion to collagen under flow conditions. Materials—Type I acid-soluble calf skin collagen, leupeptin, aprotinin, apyrase, and rabbit anti-human vWF were obtained from Sigma. The MAP kinase inhibitors, PD 98059 and SB 203580, were purchased from Calbiochem-Novabiochem. Indomethacin was purchased from Cayman Chemical Co. (Ann Arbor, MI). The anti-p38 MAP kinase, anti-ERK, and anti-PAK1/2 antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). The antibody against the phosphorylated form of p38 MAP kinase was purchased from Promega (Madison, WI) and that against the phosphorylated form of ERK from BIOSOURCE International (Camarillo, CA). Anti-Hsp27 and anti-phospho-Hsp27 (Ser78) polyclonal antibodies were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology (Lake Placid, NY). The antibody against the phosphorylated form of PAK1/2 (threonine 423/threonine 402) was obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). Alexa fluor 488-labeled phalloidin and Alexa fluor 594-labeled DNase I were obtained from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Lethal toxin (LT) purified to homogeneity from Clostridium sordellii (strain IP82) and toxin B from Clostridium difficile (strain VPI10463) were obtained from Dr M. Popoff (Institut Pasteur, Paris). The 6F1 mAb against the α2 integrin was generously provided by Prof. B. Coller (Mount Sinai Hospital, New York). The mAb G19H10, which blocks the binding of the vWF to GPIb, was prepared as described previously (30Theilmeier G. Lenaerts T. Remacle C. Collen D. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 2725-2734Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Saratin, which blocks the binding of vWF to collagen, was obtained from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany). Blood Collection and Platelet Isolation—Venous blood was collected in 50 μm PPACK tubes from healthy donors free of medication for at least 2 weeks prior to blood collection. Conventional informed consent was obtained from all donors in accordance with the guidelines of the French Blood Transfusion Agency. Platelet-rich plasma was obtained by centrifuging whole blood at 120 × g for 15 min at 20 °C, and platelets were isolated by differential centrifugation. The platelet pellet was resuspended in 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 5 mm NaHCO3, 0.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose. Static Platelet Deposition—Suspended platelets (50 μl at 200,000 platelets/μl) in the presence of indomethacin (5 μm) were plated with SB 203580 (20 μm), PD 98059 (20 μm), or Me2SO in wells previously coated with collagen (20 μg/ml or 100 μg/ml) corresponding to 0.2 μg/cm2 or 1 μg/cm2) for 1 h at 20 °C. Indomethacin was added to prevent nonspecific effects of SB 203580 and PD 98059 on cyclooxygenase. Plates were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Nonspecific adhesion was determined in wells precoated with 0.5% bovine serum albumin in PBS (PBS-BSA). Platelet deposition was quantified by an acid phosphatase assay as described previously (31Lewis J.M. Cheresh D.A. Schwartz M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 134: 1323-1332Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Flow Experiments and Image Analysis—Whole blood perfusion experiments were performed in a parallel plate perfusion chamber. Briefly, glass coverslips were coated by overnight incubation at 4 °C with 500 μl of 20 or 100 μg/ml collagen, giving coverage densities of 0.04 and 0.8 μg/cm2, respectively, allowing platelet adhesion but not thrombus formation. Various substances were added to the blood at 37 °C 15 min before perfusion: indomethacin (5 μm) in the presence of SB 203580 (20 μm), PD 98059 (20 μm), or Me2SO. In all experiments, indomethacin was added to prevent nonspecific effects of SB 203580 and PD 98059 on cyclooxygenase. Where indicated, antibodies 6F1 (20 μg/ml) and G19H10 (30 μg/ml) and saratin (10 μg/ml) were incubated with platelet-rich plasma for 15 min at 37 °C before use in the presence or absence of a MAP kinase inhibitor. Isolated red blood cells (32Bonnefoy A. Yamamoto H. Thys C. Kito M. Vermylen J. Hoylaerts M.F. Blood. 2003; 101: 1375-1383Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar) (45% of final volume) were added just before the start of the 4-min perfusion. Blood was perfused over the coverslip for 4 min with a syringe pump at shear rates of 300 or 1500 s–1. Adherent platelets were washed in PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and permeabilized. They were then saturated by overnight incubation in PBS-BSA at 4 °C and stained for 30 min with FITC-phalloidin (1/200). They were viewed with an epifluorescence microscope (Nikon, Eclipse 600), and surfaces were analyzed. For each perfused surface, images from 30 random microscopy fields were collected. The mean area covered by adherent platelets was determined and analyzed 2A. Mazharian, S. Roger, P. Maurice, E. Berrou, M. R. Popoff, M. F. Hoylaerts, F. Fauvel-Lafeve, A. Bonnefoy, and M. Bryckaert, personal communication. using NIH Image software (rsb.info.nih.gov/nih-image/). Platelet adhesion is expressed as relative surface coverage to facilitate the comparison of different treatments. Quantification of F-actin/G-actin—Platelet (100,000 platelets/μl) preparations containing indomethacin were incubated with or without SB 203580 (20 μm), PD 98059 (20 μm), lethal toxin 82 (LT82) (5 μg/ml), toxin B (7.5 μg/ml), or Me2SO as a control before plating on collagen with a surface density of 0.08 μg/cm2. They were incubated for 1 h at 20 °C, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized, and stained by incubation for 30 min with TRITC-phalloidin (2 μm) or with Alexa fluor 594-labeled DNase I (3 μm) to detect F-actin and monomeric G-actin, respectively (33Pichon S. Bryckaert M. Berrou E. J. Cell Sci. 2004; 117: 2569-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). Platelets were washed three times, and TRITC-phalloidin and Alexa fluor 594 DNase I binding were measured on a plate reader (Fluoroscan Ascent FL, Labsystems) at appropriate excitation/emission wavelengths. F-actin and G-actin contents were linearly related to platelet number. Immunoblotting—Samples were subjected to immunoblotting as described previously (22Roger S. Pawlowski M. Habib A. Jandrot-Perrus M. Rosa J.-P. Bryckaert M. FEBS Lett. 2004; 556: 227-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Platelets were lysed in SDS denaturing buffer (100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, 50 mm NaF, 5 mm EDTA, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 100 μm phenylarsine oxide, 1% SDS, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, pH 7.4) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Protein concentration was determined by Uptima Kit Micro BCA (Monluçon, France). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE according to standard protocols. The protein bands were transferred to membranes and probed with primary antibodies. Bound antibodies were visualized by chemiluminescence with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. Statistics—Results are expressed as means ± S.E. for at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance was assessed with Student's t test for paired comparisons. Collagen-induced Platelet Deposition Requires p38 MAP Kinase Activation—We investigated the role of MAP kinases p38 and ERK2 in washed platelet deposition on collagen type I applied at a concentration of 20 or 100 μg/ml, corresponding to 0.2 or 1 μg/cm2, in the presence or absence of SB 203580 (20 μm) and PD 98059 (20 μm). In all conditions, control platelets or platelets with inhibitors were pretreated with indomethacin (5 μm) to prevent nonspecific effects of the inhibitors on cyclooxygenase. At a collagen density of 0.2 μg/cm2, the inhibitor of MEK (PD 98059) inhibited platelet deposition by 27 ± 2% (6.6 × 105 platelets versus 9.0 × 105 platelets for the indomethacin with Me2SO control; p < 0.001) (Fig. 1A). SB 203580 gave even stronger inhibition, up to 67 ± 3% (3 × 105 platelets; p < 0.001). In contrast, at higher collagen coverage density (1 μg/cm2), platelet deposition was not affected whatever the MAP kinase inhibitor used; deposition levels were similar to those for the indomethacin with Me2SO control. Similar results were obtained with other MEK (U0126: 10 μm) and p38 (SB 202190: 10 μm) inhibitors and with lower concentrations of SB203580 (1–5 μm) (results not shown). In parallel, we investigated the level of phosphorylation of ERK2 (ERK2-P) and p38 (p38-P) required for activity in the presence and absence of inhibitors (Fig. 1B and C). ERK2-P was detected only in platelets deposited on the higher density of collagen (1 μg/cm2) and was inhibited by PD 98059. p38-P was detected whatever the density of collagen used (Fig. 1C). As SB 203580 inhibits p38 activity but not p38 phosphorylation, we assessed the level of phosphorylation of an indirect substrate of p38, the heat-shock protein Hsp27 (Hsp27-P). As expected, Hsp27-P but not p38-P was inhibited by SB 203580. In static adhesion conditions, much of the adhesion observed was secondary to platelet-platelet interaction through the αIIbβ3 integrin. We investigated the role of p38 in adhesion and/or aggregation using the RGDS peptide (1 mm) and inhibitors of MAP kinases. Adhesion in the presence or absence of the RGDS peptide indicated that αIIbβ3 interaction was not involved at this density of collagen (0.2 μg/cm2) and that the inhibition of adhesion observed with indomethacin (30%) was because of thromboxane A2, which is involved in platelet adhesion only (Fig. 2). The addition of SB 203580 in the presence and absence of the RGDS peptide confirmed that p38 affected platelet adhesion but not platelet aggregation. Our results indicate that p38 plays a major role in collagen-induced platelet adhesion, whereas ERK2 has only a very small effect. Collagen-induced Platelet Spreading Requires p38 MAP Kinase Activation but Not ERK2 Activation—We investigated the roles of p38 and ERK2 in platelet spreading over a collagen matrix (0.2 μg/cm2) under conditions in which MAP kinases have been shown to be involved in platelet adhesion. Polymerized actin was stained with FITC-phalloidin. As expected, polymerized actin formed characteristic filipodia and lamellipodia (Fig. 3A). In the presence of PD 98059 (20 μm), the formation of filipodia and the spreading of lamellae were systematically observed. In contrast, platelet spreading was inhibited by SB 203580 (20 μm); platelets were round without lamellipodial extensions. We quantified the surface area of each platelet labeled with FITC-phalloidin in an attempt to confirm these results (Fig. 3B). SB 203580 inhibited platelet spreading by 35 ± 3%, whereas PD 98059 had no inhibitory effect (4 ± 2%). Similar platelet spreading results were obtained after 1 h in the presence of SB203580 (results not shown). Thus, p38 is involved in platelet spreading, whereas ERK2 is not. The Involvement of p38 Activation in Platelet Spreading Does Not Depend on Actin Polymerization—Actin-rich filipodial and lamellipodial protrusions and activation of the small guanosine triphosphate GTPase Rac1 are required for platelet spreading (13Vidal C. Geny B. Melle J. Jandrot-Perrus M. Fontenay-Roupie M. Blood. 2002; 100: 4462-4469Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). We investigated the role of p38 and ERK2 in actin cytoskeletal remodeling by determining the F-actin/G-actin ratio, which reflects F-actin polymerization. The F-actin/G-actin ratio of platelets adhering to collagen had increased by 60 ± 10% after 5 min (Fig. 4A). In these conditions, SB 203580 and PD 98059 did not affect the F-actin/G-actin ratio in response to collagen. Thus, p38 is involved in platelet spreading but not in actin polymerization. We then used toxin B from C. difficile and LT82 from C. sordellii to determine whether the small G protein Rac required for platelet spreading was involved in p38 activation. Toxin B inactivates Rho, Rac, and Cdc42, whereas LT82 inactivates p21ras, Ra1, Rap, and Rac proteins (34Popoff M.R. Chaves-Olarte E. Lemichez E. von Eichel-Streiber C. Thelestam M. Chardin P.

Petit L. Gibert M. Marvaud J.C. Bouchaud C. Popoff M.R. Int. Microbiol. 1999; 2: 185-194PubMed Google Scholar). LT82 (5 μg/ml) and toxin B (7.5 μg/ml) decreased the collagen-induced F-actin/G-actin ratio by 79 and 84%, respectively (Fig. 4B). It also inhibited collagen-induced PAK2 phosphorylation, one of the most precisely characterized effectors of Rac/Cdc42 involved in lamellipodia formation (Fig. 4C). In these conditions, p38 phosphorylation was inhibited by 57 and 69%, respectively (Fig. 4D). Our findings suggest that p38 activation is largely dependent on Rac activation. This Rac activation, and possibly the activation of other small G proteins, induces p38 phosphorylation and actin polymerization by two different pathways, both of which are required for spreading. Involvement of p38 and ERK2 in Platelet Adhesion to Collagen under Blood Flow Conditions—We investigated the roles of p38 and ERK2 in blood perfusion in conditions of low collagen coverage density (0.08 and 0.4 μg/cm2), allowing platelet adhesion but not thrombus formation. Blood was perfused over immobilized type I collagen at a low (300 s–1) or high (1500 s–1) shear rate to ensure GPIb-dependence. Blood was first treated with indomethacin to prevent PD 98059 and SB 203580 from having nonspecific effects on cyclooxygenase and consequently on thromboxane A2 formation. We compared adhesion at 1500 s–1 in the presence and absence of indomethacin. We found that thromboxane A2 played only a minor role (7%) in blood flow (results not shown). After 4 min of blood perfusion over collagen at low coverage density (0.08 μg/cm2), the p38 inhibitor (SB 203580) decreased collagen-induced platelet adhesion by 67 ± 9 and 56 ± 2% at 300 and 1500 s–1, respectively (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with the other p38 inhibitor, SB 202190 (10 μm) (results not shown). In contrast, the MEK inhibitor had little (8 ± 2%) or no effect (15 ± 8%), regardless of shear rate (300 and 500 s–1). Thus, p38 is also involved in collagen-induced platelet adhesion under shear conditions. The inhibition by SB 203580 of platelet deposition in both static and shear conditions strongly suggests that p38 acts independently of shear conditions and therefore, probably also independently of vWF-GPIb interaction. We investigated the roles of p38 and ERK2 at a higher density of collagen (0.4 μg/cm2) at a shear stress of 300 or 1500 s–1. SB 203580 weakly but significantly inhibited (28 ± 9%) platelet adhesion (Fig. 6) at 1500 s–1. Surprisingly, PD 98059 reduced platelet adhesion by 47 ± 6% at 300 s–1 and by 72 ± 3% at 1500 s–1. Similar inhibition was obtained with lower concentrations (2–10 μm) of two inhibitors of MEK (U0126 and PD98059) at 1500 s–1 (results not shown). Thus, ERK2 is involved in platelet adhesion at higher collagen density, and the involvement of ERK2 seems to depend on shear conditions. Role of Platelet Receptors α2β1 and GPIb in MAP Kinase Activation and Platelet Adhesion—Our results suggest that activated ERK2 and p38 are involved in platelet adhesion via different pathways. We therefore investigated the roles of the collagen receptor, α2β1 integrin, and GPIb-vWF interaction in platelet adhesion and MAP kinase activation in high-shear stress conditions (1500 s–1). We first determined whether vWF was deposited on collagen at low and higher coverage densities (0.08 or 0.4 μg/cm2) after blood perfusion (4 min). At low collagen density (0.08 μg/cm2), only small amounts of vWF were deposited. Significantly larger amounts of vWF were deposited at higher density (0.4 μg/cm2) (Fig. 7A). This strongly suggests that the involvement of p38 in adhesion depends on α2β1, whereas that of ERK2 depends on GPIb-vWF interaction and/or α2β1. We further investigated the effect of p38 inhibition on platelet adhesion to collagen (0.08 μg/cm2) in the presence of mAb 6F1 (20 μg/ml) to block the integrin α2β1, mAb G19H10 (30 μg/ml) to block the vWF-GPIb interaction, or saratin (10 μg/ml) to block the binding site for the vWF on collagen. We found that 6F1 inhibited platelet adhesion by 87 ± 1%, whereas no significant inhibition (9 ± 3 and 12 ± 5%) was observed with G19H10 or saratin (Fig. 7B), as expected given the small amount of vWF present. In the presence of the p38 inhibitor alone, platelet adhesion was inhibited by 78 ± 1%, strongly suggesting that p38 is required for the effect of α2β1. A similar level of inhibition was observed in the presence of 6F1 (88 ± 0.5%). In contrast and as expected, the weak effect on platelet adhesion of mAb G19H10 (9%) alone was strongly increased by adding p38 inhibitor (85 ± 0.6%). Similar results were obtained with saratin in the presence or absence of the p38 inhibitor. The pathways involving p38 and vWF-GPIb were therefore different. Thus, the role of p38 in platelet adhesion is dependent on the collagen receptor (α2β1). We investigated the roles of GPIb and the collagen receptor (α2β1) in the ERK2 activation required for platelet adhesion in conditions of higher collagen density (0.4 μg/cm2)"

In this study we investigated the effect of several frequently detected MLL fusion proteins on p53 transcriptional activity. Our data show that MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, and MLL-ELL substantially down-regulate p53-mediated induction of p21, MDM2, and Bax in response to DNA damage.

Amess J. Lister T.A. Evans G. Young B.D. Blood. 1994; 84: 3776-3780Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As a result of these chromosomal aberrations, the N terminus of MLL is consistently fused in-frame to a number of partner proteins. Although more than 30 genes have been identified as fused to MLL in human leukemias, AF4, AF9, ENL, AF10, and ELL account for the absolute majority of recurrent MLL partners (3Ayton P.M. Cleary M.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5695-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). The precise molecular mechanisms underlying the oncogenic function of MLL fusions are still poorly understood. We and others have recently shown that transient expression of MLL-ELL results in a potent and specific inhibition of p53 (4Maki K. Mitani K. Yamagata T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1999; 93: 3216-3224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), a critical tumor suppressor protein that mediates expression of multiple cell cycle regulatory and pro-apoptotic genes in response to stress (6Vousden K.H. Lu X. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2002; 2: 594-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (2673) Google Scholar). The disruption of p53 interactions with its co-activator p300 has been demonstrated to contribute to the MLL-ELL inhibitory effect on p53 (5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). In the present study, we systematically analyzed the effect of additional frequently detected MLL fusion proteins on p53 activity. Our results show that MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, and MLL-ENL associate with p53 through their partner proteins and significantly down-regulate the transcriptional activity of p53 in reporter assays. Furthermore, stable cell lines expressing low levels of MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, and MLL-ELL exhibit impaired endogenous p53 response to both ionizing radiation and adriamycin treatment. Although having no discernible effect on p53 protein levels, MLL fusions significantly suppress p53-mediated induction of p21, MDM2, and Bax in response to various types of DNA damage. We also find that MLL fusions inhibit stress-induced p300-mediated p53 acetylation, which could explain their inhibitory effect on p53. Collectively, our data identify p53 functional inactivation as a common characteristic of multiple MLL fusions. Plasmid Design—pcDNA-FLAG-p53, Myc-p53, pcDNA-FLAG-p53(6KR), pcDNA-MLL-ELL and pcDNA-MLL-ELLΔCT have been described previously (5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, and MLL-ENL sequences were subcloned into the pcDNA-FLAG vector using standard techniques. Internal deletion in the MLL N terminus was generated by digestion of FLAG-tagged, full-length fusion constructs with HindIII and subsequent re-ligation. cDNAs encoding full-length MLL fusions were also cloned into the pBABEpuro retroviral expression vector. The identities of all constructs were verified by restriction digest and DNA sequencing (Dana Farber Cancer Institute/Harvard Cancer Center Core facility). Cell Culture, Transfection, and DNA Damage Treatments—H1299 and U2OS cells (American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in minimal essential medium (Cellgro) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 2 mm l-glutamine, 10 units of penicillin per milliliter, and 10 μg of streptomycin per milliliter at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. HCT116 cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium (Cellgro), whereas TK6 cells were grown in RPMI (Cellgro) with the supplements indicated above. Cells were transfected by the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) method according to the manufacturer's instructions. To induce DNA damage, cells were irradiated using the Philips industrial x-ray system or treated with adriamycin. Luciferase Assay—H1299 cells were co-transfected in 35-mm dishes with wild-type FLAG-p53, MLL fusions, and a PG13 reporter construct (B. Vogelstein, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine) that contained the luciferase gene under the control of p53-responsive promoter. The pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) was included as transfection efficiency control. Total DNA amount was normalized using empty vector. Both Firefly (PG13) and Renilla (pRL-TK) luciferase activities were determined 24 h post-transfection using the Dual luciferase assay kit (Promega). Preparation of Whole Cell Extracts, Immunoprecipitation, and Western Blot Analysis—For transient transfections, cells were transfected in 60-mm plates and harvested at 24–48 h post-transfection. To obtain whole cell lysates, cells were lysed in 100 μl of RIPA lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.1% SDS, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) by incubating on ice for 30 min, and the extracts were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cellular debris. Protein concentrations were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay. For immunoprecipitation analysis, cell extracts were prepared in high salt lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm EGTA, 0.4 m NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.2 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and protease inhibitors) and then diluted to 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100 using salt- and detergent-free buffer and incubated with anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma) overnight at 4 °C. After the addition of 5× loading buffer, samples were incubated at 95 °C for 5 min and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Schleicher & Schuell) and probed with the antibodies anti-FLAG (M5; Sigma), anti-p53 (Ab-6; Calbiochem), anti-p53 (FL-393, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-acetyl-p53(Lys-373/Lys-382) (Upstate Biotechnology), anti-MDM2 (Ab-1; Calbiochem), anti-p21 (187; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-Bax (Ab-1; Calbiochem), anti-actin (AC-15; Sigma), and anti-green fluorescent protein (Clontech). Proteins were visualized with an enhanced chemiluminescence detection system (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Densitometry measurements were carried out on selected scanned Western blot images using Scion Image J software (Scion Corporation). Retrovirus Infection—Phoenix Ampho Φ cells were transfected with pBABEpuro vectors encoding MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, MLL-ELL, and MLL-ELLΔCT (10 μg), pCG-gagpol (5 μg), and pCG-VSVG (1 μg) (Dr. R. Mulligan, Harvard Medical School) by the calcium-phosphate method. Retroviral supernatant was harvested 48 h post-transfection. U2OS, HCT116, and TK6 cells were infected by incubation with retroviral supernatants and Polybrene (4 μg/ml) for 24 h followed by selection in puromycin (1.5 μg/ml)-containing media for 5 days. Preparation of Total RNA and RT-PCR—500 ng of total RNA was purified from each cell line using the RNeasy kit according to manufacturer's instructions (Qiagen). RNA was then used as a template in RT-PCR, which was performed using the OneStep RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Forward primer for all reactions was 5′-AGAAAAGAAGTTCCCAAAACCACTCCTAGT-3′ for MLL. Reverse primers varied depending on the MLL fusion being amplified as follows: MLL-AF9, 5′-CTTGTCACATTCACCATTCTTTATTTGCTT-3′; MLL-AF10, 5′-AGTCAAGTTTTTAATTGTTCCTCTAATCT-3′; MLL-ENL, 5′-GAAGCAGACCTTCCTCGGCTCCTCCTTGTT-3′; and both MLL-ELL and MLL-ELLΔCT, 5′-TTAATATCTAGACACCCGCTTCAGCAGCTGCTGGTC-3′. PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide. MLL Fusions Suppress Transcriptional Activity of Exogenous p53—We have previously demonstrated that MLL-ELL can potently inhibit p53-driven transactivation, whereas MLL-ELLΔCT has no such effect (5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). To test the effect of additional MLL fusions on p53 transcriptional activity, the expression constructs encoding MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, and MLL-ENL (Fig. 1A) were co-transfected with wild-type p53 and p53-responsive luciferase reporter into p53–/– H1299 cells. MDM2, which is known to suppress p53-mediated transactivation (7Oliner J.D. Pietenpol J.A. Thiagalingam S. Gyuris J. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1993; 362: 857-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (1292) Google Scholar), and MLL-ELL were included as positive controls, whereas MLL-ELLΔCT served as a negative control. Exogenous p53 induced an almost 8-fold up-regulation in reporter construct activity over vector control. However, this induction was substantially reduced by the co-expression of either full-length MLL fusions or MDM2 (Fig. 1B). To confirm and extend these observations, we asked if MLL fusions can interfere with the induction of endogenous p21 and MDM2, two direct transcriptional targets of p53. In H1299 cells, basal levels of p21 and MDM2 were virtually undetectable in the absence of p53 (Fig. 1C, lane 1). Upon introduction of p53, both p21 and MDM2 were up-regulated in cells coexpressing either vector or MLL-ELLΔCT (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 7), but not in the cells transfected with MLL-AF9, MLL-AF10, MLL-ENL, or MLL-ELL (Fig. 1C, lanes 3–6). Taken together, these results indicate that multiple MLL fusions are capable of inhibiting the transcriptional activity of exogenous p53. Partner Proteins Are Sufficient for p53 Binding to MLL Fusions in Vivo—Our current results and previously published observations (4Maki K. Mitani K. Yamagata T. Kurokawa M. Kanda Y. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. Blood. 1999; 93: 3216-3224Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) suggested that, at least in the context of MLL-ELL, the MLL N terminus is dispensable whereas intact ELL is required for binding to p53. We therefore hypothesized that other MLL chimeras might also rely on partner proteins for their association with p53. To facilitate the analysis of leukemic fusion binding to p53 in vivo, we generated an internal deletion in the MLL N terminus to eliminate specific sequences that mediate the strong association of MLL with chromatin and the nuclear matrix (8Yano T. Nakamura T. Blechman J. Sorio C. Dang C.V. Geiger B. Canaani E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 7286-7291Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 9Caslini C. Alarcon A.S. Hess J.L. Tanaka R. Murti K.G. Biondi A. Leukemia. 2000; 14: 1898-1908Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), which makes conventional binding assays nearly impossible (data not shown). Immunoprecipitation/Western blot analysis revealed that MLL fusion mutants strongly bound to p53 in vivo, thus indicating that intact partner proteins are sufficient for the association of MLL chimeras with p53 (Fig. 1D). MLL Fusion Proteins Interfere with p53-mediated Response to Ionizing Radiation—Because p53 mediates cellular response to various forms of genotoxic stress by primarily inducing expression of cell cycle- and apoptosis-related genes, we asked if stable, low level expression of MLL fusion proteins can interfere with p53-mediated response to DNA damage. To address this question, U2OS cells, which express wild-type endogenous p53, were retrovirally transduced with MLL fusion constructs and selected in antibiotic-containing media. The presence of MLL fusion mRNA in U2OS stable lines was confirmed by RT-PCR using primers directed at the fusion junction between MLL and its partner proteins (Fig. 2A). We then utilized ionizing radiation (IR), a well known inducer of p53, to examine the response of MLL fusion-expressing cells to DNA damage. As expected, 3 and 6 h after irradiation with 5 Gy of IR, p53 levels were substantially up-regulated in all cell lines (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–15). In cells expressing vector only, transcriptional activity of p53 was dramatically induced as evidenced by the increased expression of endogenous p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 2B, lanes 1–3). However, in cells stably expressing MLL fusions both p21 and MDM2 induction was severely attenuated (Fig. 2B, compare lanes 1–3 to lanes 4–15). To ascertain if the inhibitory effect exerted by MLL leukemic fusions on p53 can be overcome by increasing the dose of IR, cells were irradiated by 2, 5 and 10 Gy of IR, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blot 4 h post-irradiation. Once again, p53 was induced in a dose-dependent manner in all cell lines (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–20). Whereas vector-expressing cells responded to increasing doses of IR by substantially up-regulating p21 and MDM2, this effect was significantly less pronounced in MLL fusion-expressing cells (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1–4 to lanes 5–20). Collectively, these data show that MLL fusion proteins interfere with p53-mediated induction of p21 and MDM2 in response to IR. Expression of MLL Fusions Decreases p53 Acetylation by p300 in Response to Ionizing Radiation—p300 is an important co-activator of p53 transcriptional activity that acetylates several critical lysine residues on the p53 C terminus (10Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2144) Google Scholar). Our previously published observations showed that reduction in p300-mediated p53 acetylation in vivo contributes to the MLL-ELL inhibitory effect on p53 (5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We asked if this mechanism might be involved in the down-regulation of endogenous p53 activity by MLL-ELL and other MLL fusions. To test this possibility, whole-cell lysates of irradiated U2OS cells expressing MLL chimeras were probed with the antibody that specifically detects p300-mediated acetylation of lysines 373 and 382 on p53. Following exposure to escalating doses of IR, the fraction of acetylated p53 increased dramatically in cells expressing vector only (Fig. 2C, lanes 1–4). In contrast, only a marginal increase in p53 acetylation was observed in cells stably expressing various MLL fusions (Fig. 2C, compare lanes 1–4 to lanes 5–20). These results suggest that reduced p53 acetylation by p300 could be responsible for the inhibitory effect of MLL fusions on p53 activity. MLL Fusions Suppress p53 Activity following Adriamycin Treatment—To rule out the possibility that the suppression of p53 function by MLL chimeras is restricted to IR, we utilized adriamycin as a different type of DNA-damaging agent. p53 protein accumulated to similar levels in all U2OS stable lines following exposure to adriamycin (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–20). A significant increase in protein abundance of p21 and MDM2, as well as the pro-apoptotic regulator Bax, was observed in cells expressing vector only, indicative of increased p53 transcriptional activity (Fig. 2D, lanes 1–4). However, in cells stably expressing MLL fusions, the transactivation function of p53 was inhibited as evidenced by the reduced induction of p21, MDM2, and Bax (Fig. 2D, compare lanes 1–4 to lanes 5–20). These results indicate that MLL fusion proteins suppress the induction of multiple p53 transcriptional targets following exposure to several types of genotoxic stress. The Inhibitory Effect of MLL Fusions on p53 Is Not Cell Type-specific—To exclude cell type-specific effects, we stably transduced another p53+/+ cell line, HCT116 cells, with expression constructs encoding MLL chimeras. In addition, to confirm that the inhibitory effect on p53 requires the presence of a MLL partner protein, we generated cells stably expressing the MLL-ELLΔCT construct that failed to inhibit p53-mediated induction of p21 and MDM2 in transient transfections. The presence of fusion protein mRNA in these cells was confirmed by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A), and, in the case of MLL-ELL and its truncated mutant, by Western blot analysis with a highly sensitive anti-ELL antibody (Fig. 3B). When HCT116 cell lines expressing various MLL fusion proteins were challenged with 5 Gy of IR, p53 protein accumulated over time in all cell lines, as detected by Western blot (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–18). In vector- and MLL-ELLΔCT-expressing cells, increased p53 protein abundance was accompanied by substantial up-regulation of both p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 3C, lanes 1–3 and 16–18). On the contrary, in cell lines expressing full-length MLL fusions, p21 levels barely increased in response to IR, whereas the induction of MDM2 and Bax was attenuated (Fig. 3C, compare lanes 1–3 and 16–18 to lanes 4–15). Next, to determine whether the inhibitory effect of MLL fusions on p53 activity persists over time, we examined the induction of Bax in HCT stable lines at 24 and 48 h following treatment with adriamycin. As shown in Fig. 3D, Bax up-regulation was substantially inhibited at these time points in cells that express full-length MLL fusions, but not in vector- or MLL-ELLΔCT-expressing cell lines. Finally, to increase the relevance of our findings to leukemic disease, we used a retrovirus to stably introduce MLL fusion constructs into acute lymphoblastic leukemia TK6 cells that express wild-type p53. RT-PCR analysis confirmed the presence of leukemic fusion mRNA in TK6 cell lines (Fig. 4A), and the expression of MLL-ELL and MLL-ELLΔCT was further verified by Western blot (Fig. 4B). Upon exposure to IR, p53 levels increased over time in all TK6 stable lines; however, the fraction of acetylated p53 and the induction of p21 was reduced in MLL fusion-expressing cells but was not affected in either vector- or MLL-ELLΔCT-expressing TK6 cells (Fig. 4C, compare lanes 1–3 and 16–18 to lanes 4–15). Taken together, these data show that the inhibitory effect of MLL fusion proteins on p53-mediated transcription persists over time following genotoxic injury and is not cell type-specific. Transcriptional Activity of p53(6KR) Mutant Cannot Be Suppressed by MLL Fusion Proteins—We have observed a substantial reduction in p53 acetylation by p300 in response to stress in U2OS and TK6 cell lines stably expressing MLL fusion proteins. To determine whether this mechanism is primarily responsible for the inhibitory effect of MLL fusions on p53 transcriptional activity, we utilized p53 mutant (p53(6KR)) in which six C-terminal lysine residues (Lys-370, Lys-372, Lys-373, Lys-381, Lys-382, and Lys-386) have been substituted with arginines. Previously published reports have demonstrated that this mutant cannot be acetylated by p300 in vitro or in vivo (5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 11Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). We reasoned that if the disruption in p300-mediated p53 acetylation is the predominant mechanism of action by MLL fusion proteins, then the functional activity of p53(6KR) should not be affected by MLL chimeras. To test this assumption, we co-expressed p53(6KR) with either MLL fusions or MDM2, which has previously been shown to be ineffective in either inhibiting or degrading acetylation-deficient p53 mutants (11Ito A. Kawaguchi Y. Lai C.H. Kovacs J.J. Higashimoto Y. Appella E. Yao T.P. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6236-6245Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar, 12Rodriguez M.S. Desterro J.M. Lain S. Lane D.P. Hay R.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8458-8467Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar). Wild-type p53 was included as a positive control, and the induction of endogenous p21 and MDM2 was used as a readout of either mutant or wild-type p53 transcriptional activity. Consistent with previously published observations (13Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar), p53(6KR) induced both p21 and MDM2, albeit to a lesser degree than wild-type p53 (Fig. 5, compare lanes 2 and 3). As expected, exogenous MDM2 expression did not have an effect on p53(6KR)-mediated induction of p21. Significantly, MLL chimeras also failed to further suppress p53(6KR)-mediated induction of endogenous p21 and MDM2 (Fig. 5, compare lane 3 to lanes 4–8), supporting the notion that interference with p53 acetylation by p300 plays a critical role in the inhibitory effect of MLL fusions. Acute leukemias with 11q23 translocations are characterized by an aggressive clinical course, resistance to conventional treatment regimens, and poor outcomes (1Chen C.S. Sorensen P.H. Domer P.H.

In this report, we show that some of the most frequently detected MLL fusion proteins inhibit p53 transcriptional activity, which may contribute not only to MLL leukemogenesis but also to radiotherapy and chemotherapy resistance. Even though MLL chimeras were expressed at low levels under both transient and stable conditions in this study, they potently suppressed p53 transactivation function. These observations are consistent with previous reports showing that despite low levels of expression, MLL fusions are fully capable of transforming normal bone marrow cells and causing leukemias in animal models (15Schulte C.E. von Lindern M. Steinlein P. Beug H. Wiedemann L.M. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4297-4306Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that high levels of MLL chimeras might be detrimental to cellular growth, whereas low expression facilitates malignant transformation (3Ayton P.M. Cleary M.L. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 5695-5707Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Our results strongly implicate MLL partner proteins in the inhibition of p53 activity and physical binding to p53. The MLL-ELLΔCT mutant, which contained the MLL N terminus found in all fusions and an additional sequence comparable in length to some partner proteins, has consistently failed to suppress p53 activity in reporter assays and in response to DNA damage. ELL has been shown to mediate MLL-ELL binding to p53, and now we demonstrate that AF9, AF10, and ENL are also sufficient to induce p53 association with MLL fusion proteins carrying a large deletion in the MLL N terminus. AF9 and ENL are highly homologous proteins; however, there is little similarity between them and AF10 or ELL at the primary sequence level. Yet, an examination of the predicted secondary structure reveals that all of these partner proteins contain two conserved α-helical motifs in their sequences fused to MLL (data not shown). These secondary structures might mediate their binding to p53, which contains similar motifs in its N terminus. Wild-type, full-length ELL suppresses p53 activity (5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) and functions as a bona fide oncogene to transform normal fibroblasts (16Kanda Y. Mitani K. Kurokawa M. Yamagata T. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5248-5252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). However, it remains to be determined whether wild-type AF9, AF10, or ENL are capable of affecting p53 function in a similar fashion in the absence of fusion to the MLL N terminus. Our results demonstrate that stress-induced p53 acetylation by p300 is substantially inhibited by stable expression of MLL chimeras. A reduction in p53 acetylation has been convincingly linked to the down-regulation of its biological activity. For example, it has been shown that mutant p53 that is resistant to p300-mediated acetylation has an impaired ability to induce both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (13Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Sir2α and HDAC1 deacetylases, which actively remove acetyl moieties from the p53 C-terminal lysines, are known to have a significant inhibitory effect on the p53 function (17Luo J. Su F. Chen D. Shiloh A. Gu W. Nature. 2000; 408: 377-381Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar, 18Vaziri H. Dessain S.K. Ng Eaton E. Imai S.I. Frye R.A. Pandita T.K. Guarente L. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 2001; 107: 149-159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2241) Google Scholar). Yet, our current data as well as previously published observations (13Barlev N.A. Liu L. Chehab N.H. Mansfield K. Harris K.G. Halazonetis T.D. Berger S.L. Mol. Cell. 2001; 8: 1243-1254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (580) Google Scholar) show that acetylation-deficient p53 retains residual transactivating function. We now demonstrate that p53(6KR) activity cannot be further reduced by MLL fusions, which helps explain why the inhibition of wild-type p53 by MLL chimeras is not complete. By reducing p300-mediated p53 acetylation, MLL fusions essentially convert p53 into an acetylation-deficient mutant that is still capable of inducing low-level expression of p53 downstream targets. Exactly how MLL fusions reduce p53 acetylation by p300 remains under investigation. One possibility is that MLL chimeras disrupt the physical association of p300 with p53 by sharing a common binding site, as has been demonstrated for MLL-ELL (5Wiederschain D. Kawai H. Gu J. Shilatifard A. Yuan Z.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 4230-4246Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). On the other hand, MLL fusions might recruit deacetylases to p53, which, in turn, inhibit its activity. Interestingly, the N terminus of MLL has recently been shown to directly interact with histone deacetylase 1 in vivo (19Xia Z.B. Anderson M. Diaz M.O. Zeleznik-Le N.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 8342-8347Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Whereas the partner protein presence is clearly sufficient to promote p53 binding to MLL fusions, the MLL N terminus might be required for the functional suppression of p53 activity. Further studies will address the role of p53 functional inactivation in MLL leukemias and identify opportunities for therapeutic intervention. We are grateful to Mihee Kim for critical review of the manuscript and to Marlene Welsh for help with the generation of MLL deletion mutants."
https://openalex.org/W2038585252,"Abstract Reactive oxygen species, including H2 O2, and are constantly produced in the human body and are involved in the development of cardiovascular diseases. Emerging evidence suggests that reactive oxygen species, besides their deleterious effects at high concentrations, may be protective. However, the mechanism underlying the protective effects of reactive oxygen species is not clear. Here, we reported a novel finding that H2O2 at low to moderate concentrations (50-250 μm) markedly inactivated Src family tyrosine kinases temporally and spatially in vivo but not in vitro. We further showed that Src family kinases localized to focal adhesions and the plasma membrane were rapidly and permanently inactivated by H2O2, which resulted from a profound reduction in phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residue at the activation loop. Interestingly, the cytoplasmic Src family kinases were activated gradually by H2O2, which partially compensated for the loss of total activities of Src family kinases but not their functions. Finally, H2O2 rendered endothelial cells resistant to growth factors and cytokines and protected the cells from inflammatory activation. Because Src family kinases play key roles in cell signaling, the rapid inactivation of Src family kinases by H2 O2 may represent a novel mechanism for the protective effects of reactive oxygen species."

In addition, it mediates vasoprotective actions through inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev.

Chan N. Heart. 2001; 85: 342-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under pathophysiological conditions associated with endothelial dysfunction, such as heart failure (4Sharma R. Davidoff M.N. Congestive Heart Failure. 2002; 8: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), hypertension, hyper-cholesterolemia, atherosclerosis (5Maxwell A.J.

Drug News Perspect. 2001; 14: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar), the ability to produce NO seems to be impaired. Paradoxically, NO production can be impaired by limited availability of the substrate arginine, despite apparently saturating levels of intracellular and extracellular arginine (7Aisaka K. Gross S.S. Griffith O.W. Levi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Cooke J.P. Andon N.A. Girerd X.J. Hirsch A.T.

We have previously shown that under normal conditions, the essential arginine available for NO production is derived from the recycling of citrulline to arginine, catalyzed by two enzymes, argininosuccinate synthase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase (AL) (11Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Goodwin B.L. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol.

Although these two enzymes have been studied extensively in liver, where they participate in the urea cycle (13Morris Jr., S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it was not until the discovery of NO that their function in non-hepatic tissues was clarified. In endothelial cells, AS and AL play a critical role in the operation of a citrulline-NO cycle, which supports endothelial NO production (14Sessa W.C. Hecker M. Mitchell J.A. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl.

Endothelial and hepatic AS appear to have the same primary structure (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol.

Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hepatic urea cycle AS and AL are associated with the mitochondria (20Cohen N.S. Kuda A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas in endothelial cells, AS and AL co-localize with endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in caveolae (11Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). AS expression in liver also differs from AS expression in endothelial cells as demonstrated by the diversity of co-expressed 5′-UTR AS mRNA species in endothelial cells (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Three transcription initiation sites identified in endothelial cells result in overlapping 5′-UTR regions of 92, 66, and 43 nucleotides (nt). The longer forms make up ~7% of the total AS message, with the shortest 43-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNA being the predominant species in endothelial cells, and the only detectable form found in liver. Interestingly, the extended 92- and 66-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNAs contain an out-of-frame, upstream overlapping ORF that is terminated by a stop codon 70 nt past the in-frame start codon for the downstream ORF encoding AS. Previously we reported that in vitro translation of AS mRNA containing the extended 5′-UTRs was suppressed compared with the shortest and most predominant 43-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNA species (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also showed that the translational efficiency of the extended 5′-UTR AS mRNA species was restored to the short form level when the uAUG was mutated to AAG, thus eliminating the uORF (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suppression of expression through cis effects was further demonstrated in vivo when the three forms of the AS 5′-UTR were placed in front of a luciferase ORF and transfected into endothelial cells. Here again, the presence of the uAUG found in the extended AS 5′-UTRs suppressed expression of luciferase in a cis-dependent manner.Upstream ORFs can affect the translation of a downstream ORF in a variety of ways (21Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, initiation of translation generally occurs at the first AUG that resides in a favorable context. When the first AUG context is suboptimal, a portion of the scanning ribosomes may continue past the first AUG and initiate translation downstream at subsequent AUGs via leaky scanning (22Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Several eukaryotic mRNAs have been shown to contain one or more ORFs that affect the translational efficiency of the main, downstream ORF (21Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Depending on factors such as intercistronic length and secondary structure, scanning ribosomes, upon initiation at the uAUG, can either translate the uORF and reinitiate downstream or stall on the mRNA during elongation, thus preventing initiation at other sites (21Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In other cases, partial translation of the nascent peptide prevents downstream re-initiation by interaction of the peptide with a protein or RNA in the ribosome preventing termination from proceeding efficiently (23Gaba A. Wang Z. Krishnamoorthy T. Hinnebusch A.G. Sachs M.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6453-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, another less common event is for the uORF to be translated and for the peptide product to affect translation of the downstream cistron via a trans mechanism (24Parola A.L. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4497-4505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these examples and our previous findings, we show in this report that the uORF in the extended 5′-UTR AS mRNA species is functional and acts to limit overall AS expression as well as NO production, thus providing a novel mechanism for regulating endothelial NO production.DISCUSSIONWe previously established that the recycling of citrulline to arginine is essential to provide the substrate arginine for NO production, even in the presence of saturating levels of intra- and extracellular arginine (11Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Goodwin B.L. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18353-18360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). We demonstrate in this study that expression of the extended 5′-UTR forms of AS mRNA, containing an uORF, mediates a trans effect, suppressing overall endothelial AS expression and causing a corresponding suppression of endothelial NO production. This suppression of AS expression requires a functional, out-of-frame uORF represented in the 5′-UTR regions of the co-expressed extended forms of endothelial AS mRNA (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). The uORF AUG was shown to be functional both in vitro and in vivo. When the uAUG was put in-frame with the downstream AUG by inserting a nucleotide, two in vitro translated 35S-labeled products were evidenced by electrophoretic SDS-polyacrylamide gel analysis. The larger AS species (~49 kDa) was initiated from the uAUG, whereas the smaller (~47 kDa) species represented the translation product initiated from the normal, downstream reading frame encoding AS. Interestingly, the ratio of products in this case favored use of the uAUG. Moreover, when the context of this uAUG was altered to better match the Kozak consensus initiation sequence (22Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar), translation significantly improved from the uAUG. To demonstrate that this uORF, when positioned out-of-frame, was still translated, two putative stop codons for the uORF were mutated to allow production of a larger, more easily identifiable translation product (~21 kDa). Although the difference in methionine content did not permit a quantitative comparison by 35S labeling, the results clearly demonstrated a 21-kDa product, confirming the functionality of the uORF in its natural context.With the support of in vitro results, we then assessed the in vivo functionality of the uORF in endothelial cells using a luciferase reporter assay. Expression of luciferase from the uAUG demonstrated that the context of the uAUG is sufficient to support initiation of translation. Moreover, when the AS uAUG start codon was positioned in-frame, in the context of the entire 5′-UTR and preceding the normal start codon for a luciferase gene, our results again demonstrated functionality. In this case, two luciferase products were identified by Western blot analysis consistent with the interpretation that both the uAUG and the downstream luciferase AUG are recognized in endothelial cells.Previous work from our laboratory suggested that AS mRNA species containing the uORF in the extended 5′-UTR sequence do not express AS well, either in vitro or in vivo, because of cis effects of the uORF (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). In this article, we have clarified not only the functionality of the uORF, but also its trans-mediated effects, showing that overexpression of this uORF resulted in a dramatic decrease in AS expression in endothelial cells. This result suggested that the co-expression of the extended 5′-UTR forms of AS mRNA, containing an out-of-frame uORF, may play a role in suppressing the overall expression of endothelial AS. Additionally we showed that NO production is significantly reduced when the AS uORF is overexpressed, further linking the requirement for AS expression to NO production in endothelial cells. The fact that AS expression was not suppressed when the uORF was rendered nonfunctional, via loss of an operational start codon, or by overexpression of ASuORF containing either a frameshift mutation, or altered start or stop codons, demonstrated that the entire sequence of the uORF is required to mediate the trans effects that decrease endothelial AS expression and NO production. Furthermore, a direct effect was observed that related expression of the translational product encoded by the uORF to the suppression of endothelial AS expression.When expression of the endothelial extended 5′-UTR AS mRNA species were specifically silenced by siRNA treatment, expression of AS increased dramatically (~2-fold), despite the fact that these species represent less than 7% of the total AS mRNA. Consistent with the rate-limiting role of AS in recycling citrulline to arginine and in maintaining the essential arginine for NO production, knockdown of the extended 5′-UTR AS mRNA species containing this uORF resulted in an increased capacity of endothelial cells to produce NO. Thus, the overall results suggest that the uORF found in the extended 5′-UTR forms of endothelial AS mRNA is functional, and as such expresses a protein product that acts to suppress expression of the predominant short form of the AS mRNA.In summary, a small protein produced through expression of the uORF of the extended 5′-UTRs of two minor forms of AS mRNA, unique to endothelial cells, suppresses AS expression. The overall effect of this suppression of AS expression is to decrease NO production in endothelial cells by limiting the availability of the substrate arginine. These results provide evidence for a novel mechanism for the regulation of endothelial AS protein expression and further support the essential role of the citrulline-NO cycle in endothelial NO production. IntroductionNitric oxide (NO) 1The abbreviations used are: NO, nitric oxide; AS, argininosuccinate synthase; AL, argininosuccinate lyase; UTR, untranslated region; uORF, upstream open reading frame; nt, nucleotide(s); BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; dnsAUG, downstream AUG; upsStop, upstream stop; GFP, green fluorescent protein; uORFfs, upstream open reading frame shift; siRNA, small interfering RNA. synthesized from arginine by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase is a potent vasodilator and a critical modulator of blood flow and blood pressure. In addition, it mediates vasoprotective actions through inhibiting smooth muscle proliferation, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion (1Bredt D.S. Snyder S.H. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 175-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (2127) Google Scholar, 2Gow A.J. Ischiropoulos H. J. Cell. Physiol. 2001; 187: 277-282Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 3Vallance P. Chan N. Heart. 2001; 85: 342-350Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Under pathophysiological conditions associated with endothelial dysfunction, such as heart failure (4Sharma R. Davidoff M.N. Congestive Heart Failure. 2002; 8: 165-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), hypertension, hyper-cholesterolemia, atherosclerosis (5Maxwell A.J. Nitric Oxide. 2002; 6: 101-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and diabetes (6Goligorsky M.S. Gross S.S. Drug News Perspect. 2001; 14: 133-142PubMed Google Scholar), the ability to produce NO seems to be impaired. Paradoxically, NO production can be impaired by limited availability of the substrate arginine, despite apparently saturating levels of intracellular and extracellular arginine (7Aisaka K. Gross S.S. Griffith O.W. Levi R. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 163: 710-717Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 8Cooke J.P. Andon N.A. Girerd X.J. Hirsch A.T.

Physiol. 1992; 263: L194-L200Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously shown that under normal conditions, the essential arginine available for NO production is derived from the recycling of citrulline to arginine, catalyzed by two enzymes, argininosuccinate synthase (AS) and argininosuccinate lyase (AL) (11Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 12Goodwin B.L. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 18353-18360Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Although these two enzymes have been studied extensively in liver, where they participate in the urea cycle (13Morris Jr., S.M. Annu. Rev. Nutr. 1992; 12: 81-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar), it was not until the discovery of NO that their function in non-hepatic tissues was clarified. In endothelial cells, AS and AL play a critical role in the operation of a citrulline-NO cycle, which supports endothelial NO production (14Sessa W.C. Hecker M. Mitchell J.A. Vane J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8607-8611Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 15Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol.

Physiol. 1995; 269: L581-L587PubMed Google Scholar).Because AS catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the citrulline-NO cycle (15Xie L. Gross S.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 16624-16630Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), our initial studies have focused on the molecular basis for the functional role of endothelial AS. Endothelial and hepatic AS appear to have the same primary structure (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 19Freytag S.O. Bock H.G. Beaudet A.L. O'Brien W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3160-3166Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but differ in cellular location and level of expression (11Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Hepatic urea cycle AS and AL are associated with the mitochondria (20Cohen N.S. Kuda A. J. Cell. Biochem. 1996; 60: 334-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), whereas in endothelial cells, AS and AL co-localize with endothelial nitric-oxide synthase in caveolae (11Flam B.R. Hartmann P.J. Harrell-Booth M. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. Nitric Oxide. 2001; 5: 187-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). AS expression in liver also differs from AS expression in endothelial cells as demonstrated by the diversity of co-expressed 5′-UTR AS mRNA species in endothelial cells (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Three transcription initiation sites identified in endothelial cells result in overlapping 5′-UTR regions of 92, 66, and 43 nucleotides (nt). The longer forms make up ~7% of the total AS message, with the shortest 43-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNA being the predominant species in endothelial cells, and the only detectable form found in liver. Interestingly, the extended 92- and 66-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNAs contain an out-of-frame, upstream overlapping ORF that is terminated by a stop codon 70 nt past the in-frame start codon for the downstream ORF encoding AS. Previously we reported that in vitro translation of AS mRNA containing the extended 5′-UTRs was suppressed compared with the shortest and most predominant 43-nt 5′-UTR AS mRNA species (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, we also showed that the translational efficiency of the extended 5′-UTR AS mRNA species was restored to the short form level when the uAUG was mutated to AAG, thus eliminating the uORF (18Pendleton L.C. Goodwin B.L. Flam B.R. Solomonson L.P. Eichler D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 25363-25369Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This suppression of expression through cis effects was further demonstrated in vivo when the three forms of the AS 5′-UTR were placed in front of a luciferase ORF and transfected into endothelial cells. Here again, the presence of the uAUG found in the extended AS 5′-UTRs suppressed expression of luciferase in a cis-dependent manner.Upstream ORFs can affect the translation of a downstream ORF in a variety of ways (21Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In higher eukaryotes, initiation of translation generally occurs at the first AUG that resides in a favorable context. When the first AUG context is suboptimal, a portion of the scanning ribosomes may continue past the first AUG and initiate translation downstream at subsequent AUGs via leaky scanning (22Kozak M. Gene (Amst.). 1999; 234: 187-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (1121) Google Scholar). Several eukaryotic mRNAs have been shown to contain one or more ORFs that affect the translational efficiency of the main, downstream ORF (21Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Depending on factors such as intercistronic length and secondary structure, scanning ribosomes, upon initiation at the uAUG, can either translate the uORF and reinitiate downstream or stall on the mRNA during elongation, thus preventing initiation at other sites (21Morris D.R. Geballe A.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 8635-8642Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). In other cases, partial translation of the nascent peptide prevents downstream re-initiation by interaction of the peptide with a protein or RNA in the ribosome preventing termination from proceeding efficiently (23Gaba A. Wang Z. Krishnamoorthy T. Hinnebusch A.G. Sachs M.S. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6453-6463Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). However, another less common event is for the uORF to be translated and for the peptide product to affect translation of the downstream cistron via a trans mechanism (24Parola A.L. Kobilka B.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4497-4505Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these examples and our previous findings, we show in this report that the uORF in the extended 5′-UTR AS mRNA species is functional and acts to limit overall AS expression as well as NO production, thus providing a novel mechanism for regulating endothelial NO production."
https://openalex.org/W2073174205,"Palmitoylation is a reversible, post-translational modification observed in a number of G-protein-coupled receptors. To gain a better understanding of its role in visual transduction, we produced transgenic knock-in mice that expressed a palmitoylation-deficient rhodopsin (Palm–/–). The mutant rhodopsin was expressed at wild-type levels and showed normal cellular localization to rod outer segments, indicating that neither rhodopsin stability nor its intracellular trafficking were compromised. But Palm–/– rods had briefer flash responses and reduced sensitivity to flashes and to steps of light. Upon exposure to light, rhodopsin became phosphorylated at a faster rate in mutant than in wild-type retinas. Since quench of rhodopsin begins with its phosphorylation, these results suggest that palmitoylation may modulate rod photoreceptor sensitivity by permitting rhodopsin to remain active for a longer period.

Palmitoylation is a covalent, post-translational modification occurring at the C terminus in many G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; RT, reverse transcription; ONL, outer nuclear layer; WT, wild-type; ROS, rod outer segment(s); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. 1The abbreviations used are: GPCR, G-protein coupled receptor; RT, reverse transcription; ONL, outer nuclear layer; WT, wild-type; ROS, rod outer segment(s); HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography. (1Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Up to three cysteine residues located ∼10–14 amino acids downstream of the seventh transmembrane domain may be palmitoylated. Although there is no definable consensus sequence (2Probst W.C. Snyder L.A. Schuster D.I. Brosius J. Sealfon S.C. DNA Cell Biol. 1992; 11: 1-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (677) Google Scholar), the evolutionary conservation of C-terminal cysteine palmitoylation implicates its importance in GPCR function. In vitro studies of several GPCRs in which the palmitoylated cysteine(s) was mutated have shown changes in G-protein coupling efficiency and selectivity, receptor phosphorylation and desensitization, and cell surface expression and trafficking (1Qanbar R. Bouvier M. Pharmacol. Ther. 2003; 97: 1-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). However, the effects were highly variable probably due to intrinsic receptor differences and to the utilization of non-native heterologous cell systems.Rhodopsin was the first GPCR in which palmitoylation was reported (3O'Brien P.J. Zatz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 5054-5057Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Palmitates, bound to cysteines 322 and 323 through a reversible thioester bond (4Ovchinnikov Yu A. Abdulaev N.G. Bogachuk A.S. FEBS Lett. 1988; 230: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar), insert into the membrane and anchor the C terminus of rhodopsin (5Moench S.J. Moreland J. Stewart D.H. Dewey T.G. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 5791-5796Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 6Krishna A.G. Menon S.T. Terry T.J. Sakmar T.P. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 8298-8309Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), creating a fourth intracellular domain (Fig. 1). Residues in this domain are important for transducin activation (7Sachs K. Maretzki D. Meyer C.K. Hofmann K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 6189-6194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Menon S.T. Han M. Sakmar T.P. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1659-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). Furthermore, serines and threonines in the C terminus downstream of the palmitoylation anchor are phosphorylated by rhodopsin kinase to terminate rhodopsin activity. Thus, it was logical to examine G-protein signaling activity and receptor phosphorylation in the palmitoylation-deficient rhodopsin mutant.Here we examine the role of receptor palmitoylation in vivo using the rod-specific GPCR rhodopsin as the subject of study. To achieve this goal, we generated a transgenic mouse line that makes only palmitoylation-deficient rhodopsin. Our studies reveal palmitoylation-deficient (Palm–/–) rods to be less sensitive to light, due to increased rhodopsin phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESGeneration of Palm–/– Mice—A mouse 129SV genomic library (Stratagene) was used to make a rhodopsin-targeting construct with two modifications, Cys322 → Thr and Cys323 → Ser, to eliminate both palmitoylation sites (Fig. 1). The modifications introduced a new SpeI restriction site in the gene, which we used diagnostically for genotypic identification. Presence of the desired mutations was verified by sequencing. The targeting strategy included a tACE-Cre-Neo cassette for self-excision of loxP-flanked cassettes in the male germ line of transgenic mice (9Bunting M. Bernstein K.E. Greer J.M. Capecchi M.R. Thomas K.R. Genes. Dev. 1999; 13: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). J1 embryonic stem cells (10Li E. Bestor T.H. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1992; 69: 915-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3183) Google Scholar) were electroporated with the targeting construct (Fig. 2A) and selected with G418 and gancyclovir. The homologous recombinants were identified by Southern blot analysis using the targeting strategy shown in Fig. 2. We injected targeted ES clones into C57BL/6 blastocysts to generate chimeras. Male chimeras were crossed with C57BL/6 females, and offspring heterozygous for the mutant rhodopsin were interbred to produce mice that were homozygous for the palmitoylation deficiency. Animals were handled in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology and the Tufts-New England Medical Center Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Mice were reared on a 14 h light:10 h dark cycle and used at 4–6 weeks of age, except where noted otherwise.Fig. 2Generation of the palmitoylation-defective rhodopsin gene. A, gene targeting strategy for rhodopsin palmitoylation mutant knock-in. The targeting vector (top) carries a negative selection marker, the thymidine kinase (TK) gene, attached to the 5′-end of the targeting construct. The positive selection marker, encoding the neomycin gene under the control of the PolII promoter in the pACN cassette, is flanked by loxP sites. It also includes the angiotensin-converting enzyme promoter, which drives expression of Cre-recombinase in sperm of the first generation of transgenic mice (9Bunting M. Bernstein K.E. Greer J.M. Capecchi M.R. Thomas K.R. Genes. Dev. 1999; 13: 1524-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Introduction of the Cys322 → Thr, Cys323 → Ser mutations created a SpeI restriction site. EcoRV and NcoI double digestions distinguished the targeted locus and the Cre-recombinase modified locus from the genomic locus on Southern blots. The DNA probe, shown as a solid rectangle, lies exterior to the targeting vector. B, Southern blot of EcoRV- and NcoI-digested DNA from ES cells (ES) and from mouse tails of transgenic second-generation mice (G2). WT (+/+) mice yielded a 3.0-kb fragment. A 4.6-kb fragment was present in homozygous mutant mice (–/–), while both the 3.0- and 4.6-kb fragments were present in heterozygotes (+/–). The recombinant ES cell clone shows the 3.0-kb WT band and a 3.4-kb band that reflects homologous recombination prior to Cre-recombinase-mediated excision of the pACN drug selection cassette.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Determination of RNA and Protein Expression in Mutant Mice— Total RNA isolation and RT-PCR procedures were performed using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) and Ready-to-go RT-PCR beads (Amersham Biosciences) following the manufacturer's protocols. Rhodopsin cDNA was amplified with an exon 4 forward primer (5′-CATCTTCTTCCTGATCTGCT-3′) and an exon 5 reverse primer (5′-CTTTCAAGCCACAGTCTCTG-3′). The PCR products were digested by SpeI restriction enzyme to identify the palmitoylation mutation.Protein immunoblot analysis was performed to assess the expression levels of rhodopsin and other phototransduction proteins. Extracts were prepared by homogenizing retinas in radioimmunoprecipitation buffer containing 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 150 mm NaCl, 2 mm EGTA, and a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini Protease Inhibitor Mixture, Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany). Total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). Equivalent amounts of proteins were electrophoresed in 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were stained with anti-rhodopsin (1D4, 1:5000) (11Molday R.S. MacKenzie D.

Wensel, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX), and β-actin (1:1000, Sigma) antibodies and subsequently with goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (BD Biosciences). Immunodetection was performed using enhanced chemiluminescent substrate (Pierce).Retinal Histology and Immunohistochemistry—Mouse eyes were marked for orientation, enucleated, perforated at the cornea, and immersed in 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) at 4 °C overnight. Tissues were then dehydrated in a graded series of alcohols and embedded in paraffin. Eyes were bisected along the vertical meridian through the optic nerve head and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for light microscopy. Morphometric analysis was performed by counting rows of photoreceptor cells in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) from four different areas in the central and midperipheral retina across both the superior and inferior hemispheres. Regional values were averaged for each retina. The counts were taken from three to five animals for each genotype at each age. Results from age-matched WT and mutant mice were compared by an analysis of variance.To analyze rhodopsin localization, retinal sections were incubated in blocking buffer (3% bovine serum albumin, 5% goat serum, and 0.2% Triton X-100 in 0.1 m phosphate buffer solution) for 1 h and then with anti-rhodopsin antibody (1D4, 1:500) at 4 °C overnight, followed by the rhodamine-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature.Single-cell Suction Electrode Recording—Eighteen Palm–/– mice and nine WT mice, aged 5–9 weeks, were used for rod photoresponse recordings. A mouse was dark-adapted for at least 12 h the night before the experiment. All tissue preparations were performed under infrared light. Retinas were dissected, put into oxygenated Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 0.1 mg ml–1 bovine serum albumin (Fraction V, Sigma) and 10 mm glucose and stored on ice until use. A small piece of tissue was chopped finely in L-15 medium containing DNase I (Type IV-S, Sigma) and transferred into an experimental chamber. The tissue was perfused with Locke's medium (mm): 139 Na+, 3.6 K+, 2.4 Mg2+, 1.2 Ca2+, 123.3 Cl–, 20 HCO –3, 10 HEPES, 3 succinate, 0.5 l-glutamate, 0.02 EDTA, 10 glucose enriched with minimal essential medium amino acids (Invitrogen) and basal medium Eagle vitamins (Sigma), equilibrated with 95% O2/5% CO2, and heated to 36.5–37.5 °C (pH 7.4). The outer segment of a rod was pulled into a silanized glass pipette filled with (mm): 140 Na+, 3.6 K+, 2.4 Mg2+, 1.2 Ca2+, 145.8 Cl–, 10 HEPES, 0.02 EDTA, 10 glucose. Photocurrents were recorded with a current-to-voltage converter (Axopatch 200A, Axon Instruments, Union City, CA), filtered at 30 Hz (–3 dB, 8-pole Bessel, Frequency Devices, Haverhill, MA), and digitized at 400 Hz (Pulse Version 8.07, HEKA Elektronik, Lambrecht/Pfalz). No corrections were made for the delay introduced by filtering. Light provided by a xenon arc source passing through a six-cavity interference filter (500 nm, Omega Optical, Brattleboro, VT) was used to stimulate the rod. The duration and intensity of the exposure were controlled by an electronic shutter and neutral density filters, respectively.In Vitro Rhodopsin Phosphorylation—Mice were dark-adapted overnight and retinas were collected under infrared illumination. Rod outer segments (ROS) were purified by flotation on a layered 10%/20% stepped density gradient according to a previously published method (14Tsang S.H. Burns M.E. Calvert P.D. Gouras P. Baylor D.A. Goff S.P. Arshavsky V.Y. Science. 1998; 282: 117-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar). Rhodopsin content was determined spectrophotometrically. ROS preparations were phosphorylated by incubation with (mm): 25 Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 6 MgCl2, 1 EDTA, 0.0005 okadaic acid, and 2 ATP under 2000 lux white light at room temperature for various times. Reactions were quenched with SDS-PAGE sample buffer and then the samples were analyzed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The blots were probed with anti-phospho-Ser338 and -Ser334 rhodopsin antibodies, kindly provided by Dr. D. Williams (University of California, San Diego, CA) (15Adams R.A.L.X. Williams D.S. Newton A.C. Biochem. J. 2003; 374: 537-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). After stripping, the membranes were reprobed with anti-rhodopsin antibody (1D4).Analyses of Rhodopsin Palmitoylation and Phosphorylation by Mass Spectrometry—To verify the absence of palmitoylation in Palm–/– mice, dark-adapted ROS were prepared from Palm–/– and WT mice. Cyanogen bromide fragmentation, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, and mass spectrometric mapping of the Palm–/– and WT mouse rhodopsin followed methodology published elsewhere (16Ablonczy Z. Kono M. Crouch R.K. Knapp D.R. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 4774-4779Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 17Ablonczy Z. Crouch R.K. Goletz P.W. Redmond T.M. Knapp D.R. Ma J.X. Rohrer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40491-40498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar).To quantify the phosphorylation of rhodopsin in vivo, Palm–/– and WT mice were dark-adapted overnight, given 0.5% tropicamide and 5% phenylephrine hydrochloride to dilate their pupils and then exposed to white light for 10 min at 500, 1000, or 2000 lux. After illumination, the retinas were isolated and immediately put into 8 m urea. Asp-N digestion yielded C-terminal rhodopsin peptides, which were separated by HPLC and analyzed by mass spectrometry as described elsewhere (17Ablonczy Z. Crouch R.K. Goletz P.W. Redmond T.M. Knapp D.R. Ma J.X. Rohrer B. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 40491-40498Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Tandem mass spectral data were acquired for the most abundant ion in each mass spectrum for sequence analysis, but for phosphorylation studies tandem mass spectral data were only acquired for rhodopsin phosphopeptides. The mass spectrometer bias against the negatively charged phosphopeptides was corrected (18Lee K.A. Craven K.B. Niemi G.A. Hurley J.B. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 862-874Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), and the average number of phosphates incorporated was calculated with the following formula, ∑06n*Incorr∑06Incorr(Eq. 1) where Icorrn is the corrected intensity for n, the number of phosphorylations per opsin. The results were subjected to an analysis of variance (analysis of variance, Stata Version 6, StataCorp, College Station, TX), treating light as a continuous variable.RESULTSAbrogation of Rhodopsin Palmitoylation in Palm–/– Mice—Palmitoylation-deficient rhodopsin animals were produced by mutation of the cysteine residues at positions 322 and 323 of rhodopsin to non-palmitoylatable threonine and serine sites, respectively. The mutation introduced a unique SpeI restriction site, which facilitated the identification of germ line transmission of the mutated gene in Palm–/– animals by Southern blot analysis (Fig. 2). Expression of the palmitoylation-deficient rhodopsin mRNA was verified by RT-PCR (Fig. 3A). Retinas from WT mice yielded a 300-bp band, while Palm–/– mice yielded bands at 110 and 190 bp following SpeI restriction digestion. All three bands were present in Palm+/– mice. Finally, the absence of palmitates on rhodopsin protein in Palm–/– mice was confirmed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 3B).Fig. 3Disruption of rhodopsin palmitoylation in Palm–/– mice. A, RT-PCR and SpeI digestion to verify the presence of the palmitoylation-deficient rhodopsin mRNA. RNA prepared from WT retinas (+/+) yielded a 300-bp fragment, while homozygous mutant mice (–/–) yielded 190- and 110-bp fragments, due to the unique SpeI site in the mutant rhodopsin gene. Heterozygotes (+/–) have 300-, 190-, and 110-bp fragments, reflecting the presence of both WT and mutant mRNAs. M, DNA size marker. B, confirmation that rhodopsin from transgenic retinas lacked palmitoylation by mass spectrometry. The mutant C-terminal peptide fragment showed a reduction in molecular mass to 1016.9 Da (+3 charge state; upper right panel) from the palmitoylated WT C-terminal peptide fragment at 1181.6 Da (lower left panel) consistent with the mutation of palmitoylated cysteine residues 322 and 323 to non-palmitoylatable threonine and serine residues. In addition, HPLC run time decreased from 65 min (lower left panel) to 12 min (upper right panel), due to the substantial decrease in hydrophobicity. The identities of the peaks were confirmed by sequencing the peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Minimal Retinal Degeneration in Palm–/– Mice—We examined retinal morphology by light microscopy to ascertain whether rhodopsin lacking palmitoylation gave rise to a retinal degeneration. The numbers of photoreceptor nuclei in normal and Palm–/– mice gradually declined with age, as judged by ONL thickness (p < 0.0001), but in Palm–/– mice there were fewer nuclei (p < 0.007). By 12 months of age, Palm–/– rod outer segment lengths were shortened slightly, and ONL thickness had decreased by nearly one row of nuclei relative to WT, indicating a loss of about 10% of the rods (Fig. 4, A and B). Thus, the gross morphology of the retina was minimally affected by the deficiency in rhodopsin palmitoylation.Fig. 4Minimal retinal degeneration and normal rhodopsin distribution in Palm–/– mice. A, light micrographs of WT and Palm–/– retinas at 1 year of age. Palm–/– retinas have fewer nuclei in the ONL and slightly shortened outer segments (OS), indicating a mild retinal degeneration at older ages. INL, inner nuclear layer; IS, inner segment; RPE, retinal pigment epithelium. Scale bar = 20 μm. B, mild thinning of ONL in Palm–/– retinas. From the slopes of the regression lines, photoreceptors were lost at a rate of 0.122, 0.134, and 0.178 rows of nuclei per month in WT, Palm+/–, and Palm–/– retinas, respectively. Although the linear regressions were carried out on collected results, means and standard errors are plotted due to the large numbers of coincident points. C, rhodopsin immunohistochemistry. In both WT and Palm–/– retinas, rhodopsin labeling was restricted to the outer segments (second and third panel from the left). Outer panels show corresponding bright field images (LM). Scale bar = 20 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Palmitoylation-deficient Rhodopsin Showed Normal Expression Levels and Localization—In 4–8-week-old mice, the quantity of mutant rhodopsin in Palm–/– ROS (0.17 ± 0.04 nmol/retina, n = 22), measured spectroscopically, matched that of WT rhodopsin in control retinas (0.19 ± 0.06 nmol/retina, n = 32). The immunohistochemistry of retinas showed that rhodopsin in Palm–/– mice localized to outer segments of rod cells in a staining pattern indistinguishable from that of WT retinas (Fig. 4C). Therefore the absence of palmitoylation did not substantially alter rhodopsin expression, stability, or transport to the rod outer segment. Other key phototransduction proteins were probed by Western analysis to find out whether their expression had changed. The levels of transducin α-subunit, rhodopsin kinase, recoverin, arrestin, and RGS9 in Palm–/– retinas were no different from those of age-matched controls (data not shown).Faster Photoresponse Recovery in Palm–/– Rods—Non-palmitoylated rhodopsin proved capable of G-protein signaling in single cell recordings although there were subtle differences between flash responses of Palm–/– and WT rods (Fig. 5 and Table I). The rising phase and time to peak of the Palm–/– rod response were normal, but recovery was accelerated (Fig. 5C), which shortened integration time. Palm–/– rods were somewhat less sensitive to flashes than WT rods as evidenced by their higher i½. Reduced sensitivity could have arisen from reductions in quantal response amplitude, rod collecting area, or both. Any reductions in quantal response or in outer segment size were too small to resolve, however. Palm–/– rods recovered from bright flashes sooner than did WT rods (Fig. 5, A and D). Since the time in saturation increases with flash strength, the briefer saturation period in Palm–/– rods reflected a decrease in phototransduction gain at late times after the flash. The average magnitude of the change assessed by the increase in flash strength required to achieve a criterion saturation time of 0.5 s was 1.9-fold, Palm–/– rods having the lower gain (Fig. 5D). Palm–/– rods were also 2-fold less sensitive than wild type rods to steps of light (e.g. Fig. 5, E and F). For the cells recorded, the change in sensitivity to steps followed from their 1.5-fold reduction in integration time and 1.2-fold increase in i½. Overall, the lowered sensitivity and accelerated recovery kinetics of the responses to dim and bright flashes in Palm–/– rods suggests that palmitoylation normally hinders the shutoff of photoexcited rhodopsin activity.Fig. 5Lower sensitivity and faster flash response recovery in Palm–/– rods. A, normalized averaged responses of a wild-type rod (thin traces) and a Palm–/– rod (thick traces) to flashes at 500 nm. The rmax was 8.2 pA for the WT rod and 10.3 pA for the Palm–/– rod. The flash monitor is displayed below the traces. B, stimulus response relations for the cells shown in A. Results were fit with the saturating exponential equation: r/rmax = 1 – exp(–ki), where i is the flash strength, and k is a constant. C, normalized dim flash responses of 75 Palm–/– (thick trace) and 43 WT (thin trace) rods. Flashes eliciting responses with mean amplitudes <0.2 rmax were considered to be dim. The time to peak was 129 ms for both types of rods, and the integration times were 335 and 252 ms for the WT and Palm–/– rods, respectively. D, reduced saturation time after bright flashes for the Palm–/– rod shown in A. Traces corresponding to some points were omitted in A for clarity. Saturation time was taken as the period from midflash to 0.9 rmax. The slopes obtained by linear regression were 290 and 182 ms for WT (thin line) and Palm–/– (thick line) rods, respectively. The reduced slope reflects a faster shutoff of phototransduction in the Palm–/– rod (49Pepperberg D.R. Okajima T.I. Exp.

As shown in Fig. 6, A and B, little phosphorylated rhodopsin was detected by the two antibodies in dark-adapted ROS from either type of mouse. With increasing time after exposure to bright light, mutant and WT ROS showed increases in Ser334 and Ser338 phosphorhodopsin, but phosphates accumulated at both sites at a faster rate in Palm–/– than in WT ROS.Fig. 6Increased phosphorylation of rhodopsin in Palm–/– mice. A, rhodopsin phosphorylation levels assessed by Western blot analysis using antibodies specific for phospho-Ser338 (upper left panel) or phospho-Ser334 (upper right panel). ROS prepared from dark-adapted WT or Palm–/– mice were kept in the dark or exposed to 2000 lux for 1, 2.5, 5, or 10 min. Blots probed with anti-phosphorhodopsin antibodies were stripped and reprobed with anti-rhodopsin 1D4 antibody (lower panels), which recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated rhodopsin. As the relative affinity of the two phosphorhodopsin antibodies have not been measured, the phosphorylation at Ser338 and Ser334 was not compared. B, histograms showing the densitometric analyses of phospho-Ser338 and -Ser334, normalized to the density for total rhodopsin as probed with 1D4, from three independent experiments. Error bars show S.E. C, increased numbers of phosphates per opsin molecule in Palm–/– mice compared with WT mice after exposure to light for 10 min as determined by mass spectrometry.

Upon illumination, however, both the Palm–/– and WT animals showed mono to triple phosphorylation with involvement of all six C-terminal sites. There was no distinguishing pattern of phosphorylation between the two sets of animals, although the Palm–/– animals consistently showed a higher level of phosphorylation.

Based on their primary and tertiary structures, the difference in the substrate specificities between NAD and NADH kinases was proposed to be caused by one aligned residue: Gly or polar amino acid (Gln or Thr) in five NADH kinases and a charged amino acid (Arg) in two NAD kinases. The substitution of Arg with Gly in the two NAD kinases relaxed the substrate specificity (i.e. converted the NAD kinases to NADH kinases). The substitution of Arg in one NAD kinase with polar amino acids also relaxed the substrate specificity, whereas substitution with charged and hydrophobic amino acids did not show a similar result. In contrast, the substitution of Gly with Arg in one NADH kinase failed to convert it to NAD kinase. These results suggest that a charged or hydrophobic amino acid residue in the position of interest is crucial for strict specificity of NAD kinases to NAD+, whereas Gly or polar amino acid residue is not the sole determinant for the relaxed substrate specificity of NADH kinases.

https://openalex.org/W1977902540,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare disease that occurs primarily in women and has been linked to both estrogen-mediated signaling events and mutations associated with the tuberous sclerosis complex 2 gene product tuberin. These two observations fostered the hypothesis that tuberin's impact on estrogen-mediated signaling might be through a direct interaction with the intracellular receptor for estrogen, estrogen receptor α (ERα). In the study presented here, tuberin was shown to co-immunoprecipitate and directly bind ERα through a domain localized within the carboxyl 73 amino acids of tuberin. This domain had previously been shown to serve as a binding domain for the intracellular calcium signaling molecule calmodulin (CaM). Competition binding studies identified a potential competitive relationship for binding of tuberin by ERα and CaM. Additionally, tuberin-ERα interactions were found to be modulated by the presence of tuberin's predominant intracellular binding partner hamartin, suggesting that tuberin-hamartin interactions negatively impact the ability of tuberin to modulate ERα-mediated gene transcription events. Cumulatively, data presented here support the hypothesis that interactions between tuberin, ERα, and CaM may play a critical role in the pathology of LAM disease."
https://openalex.org/W2082566243,"T4 RNA ligase 2 (Rnl2) efficiently seals 3′-OH/5′-PO<sub>4</sub>RNA nicks via three nucleotidyl transfer steps. Here we show that the terminal 3′-OH at the nick accelerates the second step of the ligase pathway (adenylylation of the 5′-PO<sub>4</sub> strand) by a factor of 1000, even though the 3′-OH is not chemically transformed during the reaction. Also, the terminal 2′-OH at the nick accelerates the third step (attack of the 3′-OH on the 5′-adenylated strand to form a phosphodiester) by a factor of 25–35, even though the 2′-OH is not chemically reactive. His-37 of Rnl2 is uniquely required for step 3, providing a ~10<sup>2</sup> rate acceleration. Biochemical epistasis experiments show that His-37 and the RNA 2′-OH act independently. We conclude that the broken RNA end promotes catalysis of its own repair by Rnl2 via two mechanisms, one of which (enhancement of step 3 by the 2′-OH) is specific to RNA ligation. Substrate-assisted catalysis provides a potential biochemical checkpoint during nucleic acid repair."

Still, the exact molecular mechanisms defining the IEX-1-mediated cellular response are not fully understood. In particular, the role of IEX-1 during apoptosis is the subject of some controversial data. On the one hand, IEX-1 has been shown to inhibit programmed cell death under certain conditions, i.e. during activation-induced cell death in T-cells (19Wu M.X. Ao Z. Prasad K.V. Wu R. Schlossman S.F. Science. 1998; 281: 998-1001Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Zhang Y. Schlossman S.F. Edwards R.A. Ou C.N. Gu J. Wu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

On the other hand, a significant apoptosis-promoting effect by IEX-1 was observed in fibroblasts, keratinocytes, and epithelial tumor cell lines (20Arlt A. Grobe O. Sieke A. Kruse M.L. Fölsch U.R.

Recent data demonstrated that IEX-1 seems to counteract certain survival pathways, i.e. those involving NF-κB and Akt1 (26Arlt A. Kruse M.L. Breitenbroich M. Gehrz A. Koc B. Minkenberg J. Fölsch U.R. Schäfer H. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 3343-3351Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Osawa Y. Nagaki M. Banno Y. Brenner D.A. Nozawa Y. Moriwaki H. Nakashima S. J. Immunol. 2003; 170: 4053-4060Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), and thus leads to an enhanced sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli. Obviously, IEX-1 is part of cellular signals that modify survival and/or death signaling pathways, and the modulatory effect of IEX-1 herein is determined by yet undefined cell type- and stimulus-specific conditions. Thus, knowledge of the intracellular localization of IEX-1 would give more insight into the mode of action exhibited by this protein. For this purpose, different fusion proteins of IEX-1 and IEX-1 deletion variants with green fluorescent protein (GFP) were generated and investigated in transfected HeLa cells by means of confocal laser scanning microscopy. We also analyzed the localization of endogenous IEX-1 in HeLa cells under different conditions. These studies revealed that IEX-1 is a protein that not only resides in the nucleus but also accumulates in distinct subnuclear regions known as promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies. Materials—Cell culture medium was purchased from PAA-Labs (Linz, Austria), fetal bovine serum from Seromed (Berlin, Germany), recombinant IFNγ, leptomycin-B, and tubulin monoclonal antibodies from Sigma, and secondary antibodies from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR) or from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). Goat IEX-1 antibodies, monoclonal and polyclonal PML antibodies, rabbit HSP90, PARP-1 (89 kDa), and GFP antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). A different monoclonal PML antibody was purchased from MBL (Medical & Biological Laboratories, Nagoya, Japan). A monoclonal GFP antibody and the EGFP control vector were from Clontech. Cell Culture—HeLa cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 1% glutamine, 10% fetal bovine serum, and gentamicin (0.1 mg/ml). Cells were split twice a week and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 at 85% humidity. Generation of GFP Fusion Protein Expression Vectors—Full-length cDNA of IEX-1 (20Arlt A. Grobe O. Sieke A. Kruse M.L. Fölsch U.R. Schmidt W.E. Schäfer H. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 69-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) was cloned into the pCR3.1-NT-GFP vector (Invitrogen), producing a fusion protein of GFP joined to the N terminus of IEX-1 (GFP-IEX-1). By means of PCR, an N-terminal-deleted (position 5–35) fragment of IEX-1 was amplified and cloned into pCR3.1-NT-GFP (GFP-(ΔNT)IEX-1). Using composite SalI primers for PCR, an IEX-1 construct was generated lacking the putative nuclear localization sequence (HRKR, positions 65–68). After subcloning, this IEX-1 variant was cloned into pCR3.1-NT-GFP (GFP-(ΔNLS) IEX-1). All constructs were DNA sequenced. Cell Transfection—Cells (25,000/well), plated directly in 12-well plates or onto coverslips in 12-well plates, were grown overnight and then incubated with 1.0 ml of OptiMEM I (Invitrogen). Transfection (1 μg of plasmid) was done under serum-free conditions for 6 h with 500 μl of ExGen500 (Fermentas) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Further treatment was usually commenced the next day. For immunoprecipitation, cells were seeded at a density of 750,000 cells/plate (9 cm) and submitted to the same transfection procedure as described above, adjusted to 10 μg of plasmid and higher volumes. Plasmids used were: pcr3.1-IEX-1, pcdna3 (mock), pcr3.1-NT-GPF-IEX-1, pcr3.1-NT-GFP-ΔNLS-IEX-1, pcr3.1-NT-GFP-ΔNT-IEX-1, pcdna3-FLAG-PML-III, pcdna3-PML-IV. (PML vectors were a generous gift from Dr. T. Hofmann, Deutsches Krebsforschungszentrum, Heidelberg, Germany). Caspase Assay—For the detection of caspase-3/-7 activity, a homogeneous luminescent assay was performed according to the manufacturer's (Promega) instructions. Morphological Investigations—For double indirect immunofluorescence staining, cells on coverslips were washed with phosphate-buffered saline followed by fixation in ice-cold methanol at -20 °C for 10 min. After washing with TBS, nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in TBS supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) glycine and 0.1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin for at least 1 h at room temperature. Incubation with primary antibody dilutions in TBS was carried out overnight at 4 °C. After washing in at least three changes of TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20, secondary antibodies, and Hoechst dye for nuclear staining, cells were incubated in TBS for 1 h at 37 °C. After washing in TBS as above, coverslips were mounted with Slow Fade Light (Molecular Probes) and sealed. Analysis was done with a LSM510 confocal laser scanning microscope (Carl Zeiss, Jena, Germany) using a 400-fold magnification. Further enlargements are 2–4-fold scan zoom figures. Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in 125 mm Tris, pH 6.8, and 0.1% SDS, 10 mm dithiothreitol containing protease inhibitors (mini complete, EDTA-free; Roche Applied Science) and sonicated for 45 s. Samples were heated (95 °C) for 5 min and submitted to SDS-PAGE using 4–20% Tris-glycine gradient gels (Cambrex). After electroblotting onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, blots were blocked for 1 h with 3% nonfat milk powder, 0.1% bovine serum albumin in TBS (Blotto) at room temperature. Blots were exposed to the primary antibodies diluted in Blotto overnight at 4 °C. After three washes with Blotto, blots were exposed to the appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted in Blotto for 1 h. Blots were then washed three times in TBS, developed with Super-Signal West Dura solution (Pierce), and analyzed with the Chemidoc system (Bio-Rad). Immunoprecipitation—Cells, transfected as described above, were scraped into high salt buffer (20 mm Hepes/HCl, pH 7.9, 0.4 m NaCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1% Triton X-100) and sonicated for 45 s. Then, cell lysates were rotated for 30 min at room temperature and subsequently centrifuged (5 min, 13,000 rpm). The resulting supernatants were adjusted with low salt buffer (10 mm Hepes/HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm KCl, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100) to a final volume of 3 ml and split into three samples subjected to a preclearance (30 min, room temperature) with protein A- or protein G-agarose (Sigma). After centrifugation, the resulting supernatant was incubated with antibodies or without for control purposes and rotated overnight at 4 °C. Protein A- or protein G-agarose was added to collect immunocomplexes and rotated for 1 h at room temperature. After centrifugation, the supernatants were harvested for further use and the pellets washed twice (5 min) with 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.6, and then with 10 mm Hepes, 300 mm NaCl, pH 7.6. Pellets were dried and resuspended in 2× SDS sample buffer. For Western blot analysis, samples were treated as described above. GST Pulldown Experiments—pGEX4T3-GST-IEX-1 (a generous gift from Dr. Porteu, Paris, France) or pGEX4T2-GST were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS (Invitrogen) as described (23Garcia J. Ye Y. Arranz V. Letourneux C. Pezeron G. Porteu F. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 5151-5163Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Bacteria were harvested by centrifugation and sonicated in TBS (6 min) before adjusting to 1% Triton X-100. After lysis (30 min, room temperature) and centrifugation (3000 × g, 15 min), the resulting supernatants were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biotechnologies) overnight at 4 °C. Beads were washed in TBS containing 150 and 500 mm NaCl and then resuspended in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0. For pulldown assays, cell lysates were prepared and precleared with bovine serum albumin-Sepharose 4B as described for immunoprecipitation. Supernatants were then incubated with glutathione-Sepharose-coupled GST-IEX-1 or GST, or with glutathione-Sepharose 4B only as control. Further handling and Western blot analysis were carried out as described above. N-terminal GFP-IEX-1 Fusion Protein Is Accumulated in Distinct Subnuclear Domains in HeLa Cells—To analyze the cellular distribution of IEX-1 in more detail, independent of available antibodies, various GFP fusion proteins were generated encompassing the GFP moiety at the N terminus. Besides full-length IEX-1 (GFP-IEX-1), fusion proteins of an N-terminal-shortened (positions 5–35) IEX-1 variant, GFP-(ΔNT)IEX-1, and IEX-1 lacking a putative NLS (HRKR; positions 65–68), GFP-(ΔNLS)IEX-1, were generated. HeLa cells transfected with these GFP fusion proteins or with EGFP as control protein exhibit strong expression of all these proteins, as verified by Western blotting with a GFP antibody (data not shown). GFP fusion protein transfectants were investigated by confocal LSM. As shown in Fig. 1, transfection of HeLa cells with GFP-IEX-1 produced an intensive and quite distinct nuclear staining after 24 h of expression. In particular, the accumulation of this fusion protein in dense subnuclear compartments was striking. To exclude that overexpression-induced DNA damage accounts for the unique staining pattern seen with GFP-IEX-1, we performed terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP-biotin nick-end labeling (TUNEL) staining to ensure that the accumulated GFP-IEX-1 was not localized to apoptotic bodies, but we did not find DNA damage in transfected cells (data not shown). Addressing the specificity of this nuclear localization of IEX-1, we next elucidated whether two structurally modified IEX-1 variants exhibit an altered intracellular distribution. As shown in Fig. 1B, a quite similar nuclear staining compared with GFP-IEX-1 was observed when the N-terminal-shortened IEX-1Δ5–35 variant (GFP-(ΔNT)IEX-1) was transfected into HeLa cells. In contrast, if the putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) of IEX-1 was deleted, the corresponding GFP fusion protein (GFP-(ΔNL-S)IEX-1) was predominantly expressed in the cytoplasm and no accumulation in the nucleus was seen (Fig. 1C). For comparison, HeLa cells transfected with a vector encoding EGFP only, which lacks an NLS, exhibit a mostly cytoplasmic staining with some diffusion into the nucleus (Fig. 1D). The Nuclear Localization of IEX-1 Relates to Its Apoptosis-sensitizing Effect—To elucidate whether the loss of nuclear localization affects the function of IEX-1 with respect to its cell death-enhancing activity, HeLa cells transfected with EGFP, GFP-IEX-1, or GFP-(ΔNLS)IEX-1 were treated with DNA-damaging apoptotic stimuli. A homogeneous luminescent assay for caspase-3 and caspase-7 activity revealed that EGFP-transfected HeLa cells exhibit a 12- and 7-fold increase of caspase-3/-7 activity if subjected to etoposide treatment and ultraviolet-B radiation, respectively (Fig. 2A). This caspase-3/-7 activation was significantly enhanced in GFP-IEX-1-transfected HeLa cells, exhibiting a 20- and 12-fold increase of caspase-3/-7 activity in response to both apoptotic stimuli, whereas no such enhancement was seen in HeLa cells transfected with GFP-(ΔNLS)IEX-1. Moreover, Western blot analysis of the caspase-dependent cleavage product of PARP-1 (89 kDa) revealed higher levels of cleaved PARP-1 in HeLa cells transfected with GFP-IEX-1 than in EGFP- or GFP-(ΔNL-S)IEX-1-transfected cells (Fig. 2B). These data indicate that the sensitizing effect of IEX-1 on DNA damage-induced apoptosis is impaired if its nuclear localization has ceased. IEX-1 Is Partially Co-localized with PML Protein in the Nuclei of HeLa Cells—As the nuclear localization pattern of IEX-1 resembled nuclear dots, we explored co-localization with PML protein, well known for appearance in subnuclear domains termed PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs) (28Maul G.G.

Mock- or IEX-1-transfected HeLa cells were incubated with 50 ng/ml IFNγ for 24 h, inducing accumulation of PML in PML-NBs (30Lavau C. Marchio A. Fagioli M. Jansen J. Falini B. Lebon P. Grosveld F.

Pancreas. 1999; 18: 378-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) revealed that in mock-transfected, uninduced cells, endogenous IEX-1 protein is found with dominant cytoplasmic staining and in distinct nuclear dots (Fig. 3A, red staining). A similar staining pattern holds true for the PML protein (green), and occasionally, co-localization is seen by yellow staining in the overlay (see single spot in Fig. 3A). IFNγ treatment of mock-transfected HeLa cells resulted in an enhanced staining for PML in the nucleus (Fig. 3B), and endogenous IEX-1 was found partially co-localized with larger PML dots (Fig. 3B). Upon overexpression of native IEX-1 protein and in the absence of IFNγ, co-localization is seen in a few spots as a partial overlap (Fig. 3C). These dots consisted of pure PML staining (green) and pure IEX-1 staining (red), with distinctly co-localized contact sites as demonstrated by yellow coloring. In the presence of IFNγ, overexpressed native IEX-1 was found more completely co-localized with PML nuclear dots (Fig. 3D). Under any circumstances regarding IFNγ-induced endogenous IEX-1 or overexpression of IEX-1, individual single stained nuclear dots for IEX-1 and PML were found. Each protein appears to exist in its own nuclear subdomain, and the proteins only partially co-localize. Leptomycin-B Treatment of HeLa Cells Leads to Enrichment of IEX-1 Protein in the Nucleus—One explanation for the strong enrichment of GFP-IEX-1 in the nucleus might be an inefficient nuclear export, either because of the covering of a potential nuclear export signal by the GFP moiety of the fusion protein or the exhaustion of the respective carrier because of insufficient degradation of the fusion protein. To investigate whether IEX-1 is subject to specific nuclear export, HeLa cells, either mock- or IEX-1-transfected, were treated with leptomycin-B (LMB), an inhibitor of the CRM1 nuclear export protein, leading to the nuclear enrichment of shuttling proteins that depend on CRM1-mediated nuclear export. Compared with untreated cells that show little, though distinct, nuclear staining for IEX-1 (Fig. 4A), HeLa cells treated with 10 ng/ml LMB for 20 h exhibit strongly enhanced nuclear staining, and some cells show an enlargement of IEX-1-positive nuclear subdomains (Fig. 4B) reminiscent of the GFP fusion protein aggregates (compare Fig. 1A). As only endogenous IEX-1 is detected in mock-transfected cells (Fig. 4B), this clearly underlines that inhibition of transport leads to enrichment of IEX-1 in the nucleus. The particular pattern of IEX-1 and PML in partially overlapping nuclear substructures was also seen after LMB treatment (Fig. 4, C and D), suggesting that enhanced nuclear staining for IEX-1 is not only seen during IFNγ treatment but also when nuclear export is blocked by LMB, indicating that the appearance of partial co-localization is a specific process. Overexpression of PML in HeLa Cells Reveals Isoform-dependent Nuclear Dot Structures Serving as a Matrix for Distribution of Overexpressed IEX-1—To explore the co-localization of IEX-1 and PML in more detail, PML isoforms III and IV were independently overexpressed in HeLa cells co-transfected with GFP-IEX-1. Whereas PML-III overexpression (Fig. 5, A–D) resulted in numerous small round dot structures (Fig. 5B, red), PML-IV overexpression (Fig. 5,E–H) was generally weaker, and the protein, as detected by anti-PML antibodies, was distributed more diffusely in patch-like structures (Fig. 5F, red). Interestingly, the expression pattern for GPF-IEX-1 fusion proteins in these double transfected cells followed suit. In PML-III-overexpressing cells, GFP-IEX-1 was seen in numerous small round dots (Fig. 5A, green) and almost totally co-localized with PML-III (Fig. 5, C and D). In PML-IV-overexpressing cells, GFP-IEX-1 expression was weaker and again was distributed like PML-IV in patch-like assemblies (Fig. 5E). This expression pattern for PML isoforms was also found in HeLa cells after individual overexpression of PML-III or -IV (data not shown), and co-localization with GFP-IEX-1 was reproducible in a different, mesenchymal cell line, U2OS (data not shown). Double transfection experiments with both PML isoforms and native IEX-1 revealed a perfect co-localization between PML-IV and IEX-1 (Fig. 6, E–H), showing the same patch-like distribution for IEX-1 (Fig. 6E, green) and PML-IV (Fig. 6F, red), and overexpressed proteins were fully co-localized (Fig. 6, G and H). Native IEX-1 was found more diffuse in the nucleus (Fig. 6A, green) when co-expressed with PML-III (Fig. 6B, red), and co-localization was seen at the rim of PML-III nuclear dots (Fig. 6, C and D). Co-immunoprecipitation Experiments Reveal Direct Interaction of IEX-1 and PML—To detect the physical interaction of IEX-1 with PML, the PML isoforms PML-III and PML-IV as well as IEX-1 were expressed in single or double transfected HeLa cells. Western blotting with antibodies against IEX-1 (C20; Santa Cruz) revealed three different bands of IEX-1 at a size of 20–30 kDa in 4–20% gradient gels. Monoclonal anti-PML antibodies (Santa Cruz) revealed a broader band of PML-IV at a size of 90 kDa and a more distinct band of PML-III at a size of 100 kDa (Fig. 7). Compared with single transfection, the amount of PML-III protein strongly increased in HeLa cells co-transfected with IEX-1, whereas IEX-1 levels were slightly elevated. Co-transfection of PML-IV and IEX-1 did not alter the amount of PML-IV protein in comparison with single transfected cells, but IEX-1 protein levels significantly decreased in the presence of PML-IV (Fig. 7). A high amount of IEX-1 protein was precipitable (Fig. 8a, lane 2) from HeLa cells co-transfected with IEX-1 and PML-III, and a significant portion of IEX-1 co-precipitated together with PML-III in anti-PML immunoprecipitation experiments (Fig. 8a, lane 3). In contrast, very little amount of IEX-1 protein was precipitable (Fig. 8a, lane 8) from HeLa cells co-transfected with IEX-1 and PML-IV, and no IEX-1 protein co-precipitated together with PML-IV (Fig. 8a, lane 9). To ensure optimal PML expression (31Lallemand-Breitenbach V. Zhu J. Puvion F. Koken M. Honore N. Doubeikovsky A. Duprez E. Pandolfi P.P. Puvion E. Freemont P. de The H. J. Exp. Med."

In vivo, BRCA1 exists as a heterodimer with the BARD1 protein, and many of its biological functions are mediated by the BRCA1-BARD1 complex. Here, we show that BARD1 is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner and that the hyperphosphorylated forms of BARD1 predominate during M phase. By mobility shift analysis and mass spectrometry, we have identified seven sites of mitotic phosphorylation within BARD1. All sites exist within either an SP or TP sequence, and two sites resemble the consensus motif recognized by cyclin-dependent kinases. To examine the functional consequences of BARD1 phosphorylation, we used a gene targeting knock-in approach to generate isogenic cell lines that express either wild-type or mutant forms of the BARD1 polypeptide. Analysis of these lines in clonogenic survival assays revealed that cells bearing phosphorylation site mutations are hypersensitive to mitomycin C, a genotoxic agent that induces interstrand DNA cross-links.

Although hereditary breast cancer can often be traced to germ line mutations in the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene, it is still unclear how BRCA1 lesions promote mammary carcinogenesis (1Wooster R. Weber B.L. N. Engl. J. Med. 2003; 348: 2339-2347Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). The major isoform of BRCA1 is a large polypeptide that contains a RING domain at its N terminus and two tandem copies of the BRCT domain at the C terminus (2Miki Y. Swensen J. Shattuck-Eidens D.

In vivo, BRCA1 exists primarily as a heterodimer with BARD1, a distinct but related protein that also harbors an N-terminal RING motif and two C-terminal BRCT domains (3Wu L.C. Wang Z.W. Tsan J.T.

Both proteins colocalize within the same nuclear foci of S phase cells (4Jin Y. Xu X.L. Yang M-C.W. Wei F. Ayi T.-C. Bowcock A.M. Baer R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Co-immunoprecipitation analysis indicates that most of the cellular pool of endogenous BRCA1 exists in the form of a heterodimer with BARD1 (6Yu X. Baer R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18541-18549Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 7Chiba N. Parvin J.D. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4222-4228PubMed Google Scholar), and structural studies have shown that dimerization occurs through a four-helix bundle formed by α-helices flanking the RING motifs of both proteins (8Brzovic P.S. Rajagopal P. Hoyt D.W. King M-C. Klevit R.E. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2001; 8: 833-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). Because the phenotypes of mice null for either Brca1 or Bard1 are essentially indistinguishable (9McCarthy E.E. Celebi J.T. Baer R. Ludwig T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 23: 5056-5063Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the major functions of both proteins are likely to be mediated by the BRCA1/BARD1 heterodimer. This notion is supported by the fact that BRCA1 and BARD1 together form a potent enzymatic complex that can catalyze ubiquitin polymerization in vitro (10Hashizume R. Fukuda M. Maeda I. Nishikawa H.

Early studies established that BRCA1 is hyperphosphorylated in several cellular settings. During normal cell cycle progression, hyperphosphorylation of BRCA1 occurs at the G1/S transition, and various phosphorylated forms of BRCA1 are apparent throughout the subsequent S, G2, and M phases (5Scully R.

In addition, some BRCA1 phosphorylation events are induced in response to growth factor signaling (26Zhang H-T. Zhang X. Zhao H.-Z. Kajino Y. Weber B.L. Davis J.G. Wang Q. O'Rourke D.M. Zhang H.-B.

The phosphorylation status of BRCA1 also changes dramatically when cells are subjected to genotoxic stress (5Scully R. Chen J. Ochs R.L. Keegan K. Hoekstra M. Feunteun J. Livingston D.M. Cell. 1997; 90: 425-435Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar, 24Thomas J.E. Smith M. Tonkinson J.L. Rubinfeld B. Polakis P.

Nature. 2000; 404: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). Indeed, several of these modifications have now been implicated in certain downstream functions of BRCA1. Thus, BRCA1 phosphorylation at Ser1387 is required for the IR-induced intra-S (but not G2/M) checkpoint (31Xu B. O'Donnell A.H. Kim S.T. Kastan M.B. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 4588-4591PubMed Google Scholar), whereas phosphorylation at Ser1423 is necessary for the IR-induced G2/M (but not intra-S) checkpoint (32Xu B. Kim S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 21: 3445-3450Crossref PubMed Scopus (470) Google Scholar, 33Xu B. Kim S.T. Lim D.S. Kastan M.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 1049-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). In addition, phosphorylation at Ser988 (but not Ser1387 or Ser1423) is required for BRCA1 modulation of homologous and non-homologous DNA recombination (34Zhang J. Willers H. Feng Z. Ghosh J.C. Kim S. Weaver D.T. Chung J.H. Powell S.N. Xia F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 708-718Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). These results indicate that the downstream functions of BRCA1 can be influenced by specific phosphorylation events. By most measures, the biological functions of BRCA1 appear to be mediated through the heterodimeric BRCA1/BARD1 complex (35Baer R. Ludwig T. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2002; 12: 86-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Here, we provide evidence that BARD1 is also subject to post-translational phosphorylation and that hyperphosphorylated forms of BARD1 arise primarily during mitosis. Each of the seven identified BARD1 phosphorylation sites resides within an SP or TP sequence motif, indicating the involvement of proline-directed kinases. Significantly, cells that express mutant BARD1 polypeptides that lack these phosphorylation sites are hypersensitive to genotoxic stress, suggesting a role for BARD1 phosphorylation in the cellular response to DNA damage. Cell Culture—The HCT116, HeLa, and H1299 cell lines were obtained from American Type Tissue Culture Collection. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy's 5A medium, and HeLa and H1299 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; both media were supplemented with 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mm l-glutamine, and 10% fetal bovine serum. For cell cycle analysis, HeLa cells were synchronized in prometaphase by a thymidine/nocodazole block and subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) and Western analysis as described previously (36Choudhury A.D.

A phospho-specific antiserum that recognizes Thr299-phosphorylated BARD1 was generated and affinity-purified at Zymed Laboratories Inc. (South San Francisco, CA) from rabbits immunized with the phosphothreonine-containing peptide CSRNEVVpTPEK conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. For detection of exogenous BARD1 polypeptides with the phospho-Thr299-specific antiserum (e.g. Fig. 5B), direct Western analysis was performed as described (36Choudhury A.D. Xu H. Baer R. J. Biol.

After high speed centrifugation for 2 min, the supernatants were incubated with 5 μl of anti-BARD1 monoclonal antibody for 2 h at 4 °C. Protein G-Sepharose beads (50 μl, 20% slurry) were added, and the mixtures were then incubated overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed once with low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer, twice with high salt (1 m NaCl) Nonidet P-40 buffer, and once again with low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads by denaturing at 100 °C in 2× protein loading dye. The beads were filtered through compact reaction columns (U. S. Biochemical Corp.), and the eluted proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE for Western analysis with the phospho-Thr299-specific antiserum. To examine the ability of hyperphosphorylated BARD1 species to interact with BRCA1 (see Fig. 1C), cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the anti-BARD1 monoclonal antibody (36Choudhury A.D. Xu H.

A, electrophoretic mobility shift analysis of BARD1 in nocodazole-arrested cells. HeLa cells were synchronized in prometaphase by a thymidine/nocodazole block. The mitotic cells were then collected by shake-off; and at time 0, the cells were replated at low density to induce cell cycle progression from prometaphase. Cells harvested at various times (1–5 h) after induction were subjected to FACS analyses to determine the cell cycle distribution and to Western analysis to monitor expression of BARD1, BRCA1, Cdc27, and α-tubulin. Asynchronous cells (A; first lane) and nocodazole-arrested cells (N; second lane) were also examined. B, the electrophoretic mobility shift of mitotic BARD1 is attributable to phosphorylation. Lysates of asynchronous HeLa cells (lanes 1 and 2), nocodazole-arrested cells (lanes 3 and 4), and cells released from nocodazole block for 2 h (lanes 5 and 6) or 5 h (lanes 7 and 8) were incubated in the presence (+) or absence (–) of λ-phosphatase (λ-PPase). The digested lysates were then examined by immunoblotting with the BARD1-specific antiserum. C, the hyperphosphorylated BARD1 species of mitotic cells interact with BRCA1. Lysates of asynchronous HeLa cells (lane 1), nocodazole-arrested cells (lane 2), and cells released from nocodazole block for 2 h (lane 3) or 5 h (lane 4) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with the anti-BARD1 (upper panel) or anti-BRCA1 (lower panel) monoclonal antibody. The immunoprecipitates were then examined by Western blotting (WB) with the anti-BARD1 polyclonal antiserum. D, localization of the mitotic BARD1 phosphorylation sites by electrophoretic mobility shift analysis. HeLa cells were transfected with expression plasmids encoding each of the indicated fragments of BARD1 fused to an N-terminal tag containing three tandem copies of the FLAG epitope. The transfected cells were allowed to cycle asynchronously (odd-numbered lanes) or were arrested in prometaphase by a thymidine/nocodazole block (even-numbered lanes). The electrophoretic mobilities of the transfected BARD1 fragments were examined by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibody. As shown, mitotic mobility shifts were apparent with BARD1 fragments 129–228 (lane 4), 189–287 (lane 6), and 280–388 (lane 8).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Mapping BARD1 Phosphorylation Sites by Mutation Analysis— Expression plasmids encoding human BARD1 fragments were generated by inserting PCR-generated segments of human cDNA into the pCMV-FL3-Not vector, a derivative of the p3XFLAG-CMV-7 plasmid (Sigma). Plasmids encoding BARD1 mutants were prepared using the Stratagene QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. To test for electrophoretic mobility shifts of BARD1 fragments during mitosis, HeLa cells were transfected with a BARD1 expression plasmid using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen). 10–12 h after transfection, the cells were split into two plates: one to continue asynchronous cell growth and the other to be subjected to a thymidine/nocodazole block starting 12 h later (36Choudhury A.D.

The lysates were then resolved by SDS-PAGE on 6, 10, or 12% Tris-glycine gels (Invitrogen) and subjected to Western analysis with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody M2. Purification of Phosphorylated BARD1—To generate cell lines that stably express an exogenous BARD1 polypeptide, H1299 cells were transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding human full-length BARD1 with an N-terminal FLAG epitope (NH2-MDYKDDDDKGGS) and a C-terminal HA epitope (GGYPYDVPDYA-COOH) in the pIRESpuro vector (Clontech). H1299 cell transformants were then selected in 2 μg/ml puromycin and maintained in 1 μg/ml puromycin. To generate FLAG-BARD1-HA polypeptides for mass spectrometry, H1299 cells expressing FLAG-BARD1-HA (subclone 7) were seeded on 16 150-mm plates; and at <50% confluence, the cells were treated with 100 ng/ml nocodazole for 16 h. The cells were then collected by scraping to yield a cell pellet of ∼1 ml. All lysis buffers were supplemented with 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, protease inhibitors (0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and Roche Protease Inhibitor Cocktail), and phosphatase inhibitors (5 mm NaF and 0.1 mm Na3VO4). The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of Buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 10 mm KCl, 0.1 mm EDTA) for 15 min, followed by vigorous shaking for 15 s upon addition of 0.5 ml of 10% Nonidet P-40. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min, the pellet was lysed in 2.5 ml of Buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 400 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) by vortexing for 15 min at 4 °C. After centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min, the supernatant was then added to 2.5 ml of Buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA) and 100 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 25,000 × g for 30 min and filtration through a 0.45-μm filter. The lysate was then incubated with 250 μl of anti-FLAG antibody M2 beads (20% slurry) overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed three times with BC200 buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 200 mm NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, and 20% glycerol) and eluted twice for 3 h each with 500 μg/ml FLAG peptide in 100 μl of BC200 buffer. The eluted protein was then trichloroacetic acid-precipitated. For mass spectrometric analysis, the trichloroacetic acid-precipitated pellet was resuspended in 20 μl of 1× protein loading dye, denatured at 70 °C for 10 min, and alkylated by incubation with 2 μl of 125 mm iodoacetamide for 1 h in the dark (37Sechi S. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1998; 70: 5150-5158Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar). The sample was separated by SDS-PAGE on a 4–12% Tris-glycine gel, which was then fixed and stained with GelCode Blue stain reagent (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Mass Spectrometric Analysis of BARD1 Phosphorylation Sites— BARD1 in-gel enzymatic digestion and extraction from gel bands were performed essentially as described (38Qin J. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 4002-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar, 39Krutchinsky A.N. Kalkum M. Chait B.T. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 5066-5077Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Briefly, two Coomassie Blue-stained BARD1 protein bands containing a total protein amount of 1–2 μg were excised and divided into four portions. Each portion was digested with 0.2 μg of modified trypsin, endoproteinase Lys-C, endoproteinase Asp-N, or endoproteinase Glu-C (Roche Applied Science). Each digestion was terminated by adding 30 μl of 7% formic and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid containing 0.5 μl (dry volume) of a 1:1 mixture of POROS R2 and R3 beads (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) directly into the solution containing the gel pieces. The peptides were extracted in the presence of the POROS beads for 3–12 h. The solution containing the POROS beads was aspirated into an Eppendorf Geloader tip pinched at its tip. The column formed at the pipette tip was washed with 10 μl of 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in water, and the peptides were directly eluted onto the MALDI plate with 1 μl of matrix solution (2× dilution of a saturated solution of 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid in 60% methanol and 5% acetic acid). BARD1 phosphorylation sites were analyzed by MALDI-QqTOF mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry on a QSTAR XL mass spectrometer with an oMALDI ion source (Applied Biosystems) operated in a positive ion mode using a nitrogen laser operating at 20 Hz. MALDI mass spectra were collected at m/z 700–7000 for 2 min. MALDI tandem mass spectra were acquired for a period of time ranging from 1 to 6 min with the binning factor set at 8 (maximum number available in Analyst QS SP7) for sensitive fragment ion detection. BARD1 Knock-out Targeting Vector (see Fig. 6A)—The targeting constructs were generated using the pBluescript II-SK plasmid (Stratagene) as a backbone. The homology arms were derived from bacteriophage λ clones containing human genomic BARD1 DNA (40Hoa Thai T. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Massa H.F. Muller C.Y. Ashfaq R. Mathis J.M. Miller D.S. Trask B.J. Baer R. Bowcock A.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The 5′-homology arm spans a 3.6-kb region that includes the first 23 bp of exon 2 and sequences from the preceding intron. The 3′-homology arm spans a 3.6-kb region immediately downstream of exon 3. The arms flank a cassette that includes 1) the hygromycin resistance gene flanked by two loxP sites, 2) the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase polyadenylation signal, and 3) the primer sequence GTGACAAGGAATGTCCTGTGGTGC to facilitate PCR screening of transformants. The diphtheria toxin gene was inserted 5′ of the left homology arm for negative selection of random integration events. BARD1 Knock-in Targeting Vector (see Fig. 6B)—The 5′-arm was derived from bacteriophage λ clones containing human genomic BARD1 DNA (40Hoa Thai T. Du F. Tsan J.T. Jin Y. Phung A. Spillman M.A. Massa H.F. Muller C.Y. Ashfaq R. Mathis J.M. Miller D.S. Trask B.J. Baer R. Bowcock A.M. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1998; 7: 195-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) and spans a 3.8-kb region that includes the first 23 bp of exon 2 and sequences from the preceding intron. The 3′-homology arm was generated by PCR amplification of genomic DNA from HCT116 cells with Platinum Taq High Fidelity polymerase (Invitrogen); it corresponds to a 3.5-kb region of genomic DNA including exon 3 and sequences from the preceding intron. The arms flank a cassette that includes 1) cDNA sequences encoding residues 61–777 of human BARD1; 2) an internal ribosome entry site followed by the neomycin resistance gene, with both flanked by loxP sites; 3) the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase polyadenylation signal; and 4) the primer sequence ACTTGTCCAAGTTACAAAGCTTAGTAGACAGC to facilitate PCR screening of transformants. The diphtheria toxin gene was inserted 3′ of the right homology arm for negative selection of random integration events. Transfection and Selection of HCT116 Cells—The targeting vectors were linearized by restriction digestion with NotI (Promega) and purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and precipitation in 70% ethanol. Cells (6 × 106) were seeded on each of three 100-mm plates; after 20 h, the cells on each plate (at ∼70% confluence) were transfected with 10 μg of the linearized targeting construct and 50 μl of Lipofectamine in serum-free Opti-MEM I according to the protocol of Invitrogen. 24 h after transfection, the cells from each plate were trypsinized and seeded on twenty 96-well plates in medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin B (Roche Applied Science) for knock-out targeting or 300–325 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen) for knock-in targeting. Starting after ∼19 days, cells from wells containing a single colony were transferred to fresh 96-well plates in medium containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin B or 100 μg/ml G418. After screening, cells were cultured in medium without the drug used for selection. Screening HCT116 Transformants—Cells from each well of a 96-well plate were trypsinized and collected, leaving ∼20% to repopulate the well; and genomic DNA was purified using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen Inc.). Transformants were screened by PCR using Platinum Taq High Fidelity polymerase according to the protocol of Invitrogen with primers GTGACAAGGAATGTCCTGTGGTGC and GTCCATGATTTGACAAGTTCTTCCTAATTGC for knock-out targeting and with primers ACTTGTCCAAGTTACAAAGCTTAGTAGACAGC and CCACCGGGTGTGTCACATGC for knock-in targeting. The genomic DNAs from six clones were pooled for screening, after which individual clones in the positive pools were screened. For Southern analysis of HCT116 transformants, genomic DNA was isolated using the QIAamp DNA blood mini kit, and 10-μg aliquots of BglII-digested DNA were subjected to Southern hybridization with the radiolabeled BARD1 5′-probe (a 1.3-kb segment of genomic BARD1 located between exon 1 and the region corresponding to the 5′-homology arm of the targeting constructs). Western Analysis of HCT116 Transformants—Cells were arrested by a thymidine/nocodazole block as described above and collected by scraping. The cell pellets were lysed in low salt Nonidet P-40 buffer supplemented with 2× phosphatase inhibitors as described above, and the lysates were subjected to direct Western analysis or to immunoprecipitation with the anti-BARD1 monoclonal antibody followed by Western analysis as described above. Clonogenic Survival Assays—Approximately 2000 cells were seeded on 100-mm plates. After 24 h, the cells were treated with the indicated concentrations of mitomycin C (Sigma) for 4 h. The cells were then washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated in complete medium, which was changed every 3–4 days. After 10 days, the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, stained with 10% Giemsa solution (Invitrogen) in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min, and washed twice more with phosphate-buffered saline, and drug-resistant colonies were counted.
