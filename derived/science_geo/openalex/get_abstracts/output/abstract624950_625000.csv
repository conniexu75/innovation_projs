We use the X chromosome inactivation (XCI) paradigm to explore the implication of chromatin changes in gene silencing. Using female mouse embryonic stem cells, we initiate XCI by inducing Xist and then monitor the temporal changes in transcription and chromatin by allele-specific profiling. This reveals histone deacetylation and H2AK119 ubiquitination as the earliest chromatin alterations during XCI. We show that HDAC3 is pre-bound on the X chromosome and that, upon Xist coating, its activity is required for efficient gene silencing.

Our results reveal the hierarchy of chromatin events during the initiation of XCI and identify key roles for chromatin in the early steps of transcriptional silencing. Successful development requires the establishment and maintenance of euchromatin and heterochromatin in different parts of the genome. Progressively stable silencing of some genic regions occurs as epigenetic memory continues to accrue, finally leading to facultative heterochromatin formation (Trojer and Reinberg, 2007Trojer P. Reinberg D. Facultative heterochromatin: is there a distinctive molecular signature?.Mol. Cell. 2007; 28: 1-13Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). Multiple layers of chromatin modifications are believed to enable stable transcriptional silencing. However, little is known about how facultative heterochromatin is dynamically formed and to what extent chromatin changes are involved in the establishment of gene silencing. A powerful model for developmentally induced gene silencing and formation of facultative heterochromatin is X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female mammals. Although the role for chromatin changes in maintenance of the inactive state has been extensively studied (Disteche and Berletch, 2015Disteche C.M. Berletch J.B. X-chromosome inactivation and escape.J. Genet. 2015; 94: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), almost nothing is known about their role in the initiation of gene silencing. In female mouse embryos, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly chosen for inactivation around the time of implantation (Lyon, 1962Lyon M.F. Sex chromatin and gene action in the mammalian X-chromosome.Am. J. Hum. Genet. 1962; 14: 135-148PubMed Google Scholar). This phenomenon is dependent on the coating of the future inactive X chromosome (Xi) by the long non-coding RNA Xist (Penny et al., 1996Penny G.D. Kay G.F. Sheardown S.A. Rastan S. Brockdorff N. Requirement for Xist in X chromosome inactivation.Nature. 1996; 379: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (1012) Google Scholar). The conserved A-repeat region of Xist mediates transcriptional silencing (Wutz et al., 2002Wutz A. Rasmussen T.P. Jaenisch R. Chromosomal silencing and localization are mediated by different domains of Xist RNA.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar), whereas other parts of Xist ensure chromosome coating (Almeida et al., 2017Almeida M. Pintacuda G. Masui O. Koseki Y. Gdula M. Cerase A. Brown D. Mould A. Innocent C.

Rasmussen T.P. Jaenisch R. Chromosomal silencing and localization are mediated by different domains of Xist RNA.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). Assays coupling immunofluorescence with RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (IF/RNA FISH) have revealed that, upon Xist RNA coating, a program of striking chromatin rearrangements ensues. These include rapid loss of histone modifications associated with active promoters (H3K4me3, H4ac, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac) and enhancers (H3K27ac and H3K4me1) (Chaumeil et al., 2002Chaumeil J.

The inactive X chromosome in female mammals is distinguished by a lack of histone H4 acetylation, a cytogenetic marker for gene expression.Cell. 1993; 74: 281-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (598) Google Scholar). Furthermore, there is accumulation of H2AK119Ub and H3K27me3, two repressive histone marks dependent on the activity of Polycomb repressive complex (PRC) 1 and 2, respectively (for a review, see Brockdorff, 2017Brockdorff N. Polycomb complexes in X chromosome inactivation.Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 2017; 372: 20170021Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). These progressive alterations of chromatin states are associated with stable repression of the majority of genes on the Xi. Not all X-linked loci are affected in the same way, however, with some genes being silenced much faster than others or even entirely resisting repression (“escapees”) (Disteche and Berletch, 2015Disteche C.M. Berletch J.B. X-chromosome inactivation and escape.J. Genet. 2015; 94: 591-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). The reason for this striking diversity in gene inactivation dynamics remains unclear. It is likely that the susceptibility of loci to Xist spreading plays a role in this process (Borensztein et al., 2017Borensztein M. Syx L. Ancelin K. Diabangouaya P. Picard C. Liu T. Liang J.B.

Lander E.S. et al.The Xist lncRNA exploits three-dimensional genome architecture to spread across the X chromosome.Science. 2013; 341: 1237973Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar); however, differences in their chromatin status could also underpin transcriptional silencing dynamics. Although some chromatin marks have previously been mapped on the X chromosome in female embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and differentiated cells, nothing is known about the dynamics of the XCI process, especially during early stages when gene silencing actually takes place (Marks et al., 2009Marks H. Chow J.C. Denissov S. Françoijs K.J. Brockdorff N. Heard E. Stunnenberg H.G.

Specifically, the order of chromatin changes and their possible role(s) in mediating transcriptional silencing remain largely unknown. Previous studies have relied on ESC differentiation for XCI initiation, which results in highly asynchronous Xist induction and elevated levels of heterogeneity in the population. These complications entirely mask primary chromatin events occurring in a small subset of cells embarking on the process of XCI. Recent advances in the identification of Xist binding proteins revealed that most histone-modifying activities are not directly recruited by Xist RNA but, rather, by its binding partners, like SPEN and HNRNPK (Chu et al., 2015Chu C. Zhang Q.C. da Rocha S.T. Flynn R.A. Bharadwaj M. Calabrese J.M. Magnuson T. Heard E. Chang H.Y.

A major question is whether the chromatin changes that occur early on in XCI are actually involved in gene silencing during XCI and, if so, how. Here we investigate the earliest events accompanying transcriptional silencing of the X chromosome. Using a female ESC line in which one X chromosome can be specifically inactivated via an inducible Xist gene, we performed allele-specific native chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) as well as nascent transcript profiling at the initiation stages of XCI. Using 4-hr time resolution, we were able to reveal the precise order of chromosome-wide epigenetic events that are intricately coupled to gene repression during XCI. We find that loss of histone acetylation and, in particular H3K27ac, is one of the first events following Xist RNA accumulation during initiation of XCI. We also show that histone deacetylation, via HDAC3, is vital for efficient silencing of most genes on the Xist-coated X chromosome. Contrary to the prevailing hypothesis, HDAC3 is not acutely recruited to the X chromosome by Xist; rather, it is pre-loaded, mainly at putative enhancers. Upon Xist coating, pre-loaded HDAC3 likely mediates histone deacetylation and facilitates transcriptional silencing. We also uncover a surprisingly rapid accumulation of the PRC1-dependent H2AK119Ub mark on the X chromosome, particularly at intergenic regions lying in proximity to Xist RNA entry sites, which are pre-marked by Polycomb (PcG) marks. Accumulation of H3K27me3 appears slightly later and is delayed compared with gene silencing. Using Hdac3 and Xist mutant cells, we also show that spread of Polycomb marks into gene bodies can only occur when transcriptional repression begins. Our study reveals the chromatin choreography across the X chromosome during the early steps of XCI initiation and uncovers a role for histone deacetylation in the establishment of gene silencing. A molecular roadmap of the earliest chromatin changes during the initiation of XCI has not yet been established. To reduce heterogeneity and obtain a highly resolved time series of chromatin events upon Xist RNA coating, we used the TX1072 ESC line (Figure 1A; Schulz et al., 2014Schulz E.G. Meisig J.

This hybrid (Mus musculus castaneus x C57BL/6) line harbors a doxycycline (DOX) inducible promoter upstream of the endogenous Xist at the C57BL/6 (B6) allele (Schulz et al., 2014Schulz E.G. Meisig J.

Rasmussen T.P. Jaenisch R. Chromosomal silencing and localization are mediated by different domains of Xist RNA.Nat. Genet. 2002; 30: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (575) Google Scholar). By adding DOX, we synchronously induce Xist expression and can thus decouple the onset of XCI from differentiation-dependent chromatin changes (Figure S1C). We performed allele-specific native ChIP-seq (nChIP-seq) for seven histone modifications across five time points at up to 4-hr resolution on biological duplicates (Figure 1A; Figures S1A and S1B). We focused on histone modifications associated with active promoters (H3K4me3, H3K9ac, H4ac, and H3K27ac) and active enhancers (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) as well as repressive Polycomb-dependent marks (H3K27me3 and H2AK119Ub). All nChIP-seq datasets were sequenced to a depth of at least 40 million reads and showed a high signal-to-noise ratio (Figures S1B and S1E). The reads were split according to content of allele-specific SNPs (B6, mapping to Xi; Cast, mapping to active X); this allelic information was then analyzed in detail to define XCI-specific changes.Figure S1Allele-Specific Native ChIP-Seq Monitors Changes in Active Histone Modifications during XCI, Related to Figure 1Show full caption(A) nChIP enrichment validation using qPCR.

Upon Xist coating, the Xi becomes rapidly depleted of active histone modifications. Although this global loss of euchromatin occurs in a similar time window as the changes in X-linked transcriptional activity (Chaumeil et al., 2002Chaumeil J. Okamoto I. Guggiari M. Heard E. Integrated kinetics of X chromosome inactivation in differentiating embryonic stem cells.Cytogenet. Genome Res. 2002; 99: 75-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), the precise chronology and possible mechanistic relationship of these two events have remained unclear. To address this, we first analyzed nChIP-seq datasets for a panel of active histone modifications (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me3, H3K9ac, and H4ac; Figure S1E). This revealed progressive depletion of B6-specific reads (originating from Xi) upon Xist induction, with different marks showing different kinetics of loss (Figure S1D). To analyze this in detail, we performed peak calling on all the reads (STAR Methods). For each peak with at least 50 allele-specific reads, we calculated its d-score (readsB6/[readsCast + readsB6]). This parameter of allelic skewing uses the active X chromosome as a powerful internal control, rendering the analysis less sensitive to variability in nChIP-seq quality and, thus, more stable between replicates. We first set out to track the relative dynamics of active chromatin marks by comparing d-score dynamics of all peaks. We found that loss of H3K27ac and H4ac is among the earliest and most robust chromatin events on the X chromosome following Xist induction (Figure 1B). Furthermore, we found that not only did different histone modifications show distinct behaviors but, also, that specific regions of the X chromosome followed rather different dynamics of inactivation (Figure S1G). Thus, there is a temporal hierarchy of chromatin events both at the level of different histone marks and genomic loci. To better understand in which context chromatin changes might affect gene silencing, we separately focused on promoters and putative enhancers. For each window, we plotted a d-score (normalized to t = 0 hr) as a function of time and fitted a sigmoidal curve (STAR Methods). We found that the maximal dynamic range of inactivation was from 0.5 to ∼0.2 and, thus, set a threshold for when the curve reached 50% of this dynamic range; i.e., d = 0.35 (STAR Methods). This IC35 (inactivation criterium 0.35) parameter indicates how quickly a given peak becomes significantly decreased or lost (Figure S1F). Pairwise comparisons of the IC35 at X-linked gene promoters revealed that H3K27ac becomes efficiently deacetylated prior to demethylation of H3K4me3 (Figure 1C). This trend holds true for ∼88% of measured promoters (Figure S1H), including a representative example of the Pdk3 promoter (Figure 1D). Similar analysis of the enhancer inactivation dynamics revealed that H3K27ac is efficiently depleted prior to loss of H3K4me1 (Figure 1C). This robust difference is observed in ∼95% of the cases; e.g., at a putative Pdk3 enhancer element (Figure 1E; Figure S1I). Thus, histone deacetylation is an early and efficient event during XCI. Next, to extract information about relative timing rather than the efficiency threshold, we obtained the time when the curve reaches its maximum slope (effective dose 50%, ED50; Figure S1F). ED50 analysis revealed that both H3K27ac and H3K4me3 become depleted concomitantly (Figure S1J). Together with the IC35 data, this indicates that, even though demethylation of promoters and their deacetylation are concurrent, the latter process is significantly more efficient. Furthermore, unlike promoters, enhancers showed significant differences in the ED50 parameter between H3K27ac and H3K4me1, indicating that enhancer demethylation is not only less efficient but also significantly delayed (Figure S1J). To assess the relative deacetylation dynamics of enhancers and promoters, we compared the IC35 parameter for H3K27ac at both types of genomic regulatory elements. Intriguingly, enhancer deacetylation was slightly more efficient than that of promoters (Figure S1K). After pairing active promoters to their putative enhancers (STAR Methods), ∼76% (37 of 49) of them showed more efficient deacetylation at enhancers than at promoters (Figure S1M). On the other hand, loss of H3K4me1 on the Xi, which is indicative of enhancer decommissioning, was found to be significantly less efficient compared with the loss of H3K4me3 at promoters (Figure S1L). Thus, inactivation (loss of H3K27ac) of enhancers proceeds at a slightly higher efficiency than of promoters, although stable decommissioning (loss of H3K4me) of promoters precedes that of enhancers. Intriguingly, upon H3K4me3 loss following Xist induction, we observe a slight increase in H3K4me1 levels around transcriptional start sites (TSSs), which probably reflects an intermediate of stepwise enzymatic H3K4me3 demethylation (Figures S1N and S1O). In summary, our data show that efficient histone deacetylation at promoters and enhancers is one of the first events during XCI, indicating that it might contribute to initiation of transcriptional silencing. In comparison, demethylation of H3K4me3 and H3K4me1 is less efficient and delayed, respectively. Finally, deacetylation of promoters and enhancers seems to follow broadly comparable dynamics, whereas their decommissioning differs significantly. To gain insight into the relationship between loss of active chromatin marks and transcriptional silencing of X-linked genes, we compared our nChIP-seq dataset with transient transcriptome sequencing (TT-seq; Schwalb et al., 2016Schwalb B. Michel M. Zacher B. Frühauf K. Demel C. Tresch A. Gagneur J. Cramer P. TT-seq maps the human transient transcriptome.Science. 2016; 352: 1225-1228Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar). This allows a direct measure of newly synthesized RNA and, thus, enabled us to measure transcriptional activity as the X chromosome becomes inactivated. Comparison of the IC35 for TT-seq and individual histone modifications at associated promoters revealed that transcriptional silencing dynamics are most tightly linked to promoter deacetylation at H3K27 and, to a lesser extent, to loss of H4ac, H3K9ac, and H3K4me3 (Figures 2A and 2B ; Figure S2A). A similar pattern of gene silencing and promoter deacetylation dynamics further exemplifies this correlation (Figure 2C).Figure S2Histone Deacetylation Correlates with Transcriptional Silencing and Some Genomic Features, Related to Figure 2Show full caption(A) Violin plots comparing the dynamics of transcriptional silencing and the loss of active histone modifications from associated promoters.

To test the hypothesis that incorporating genetic diversity into mouse models of AD would improve translational potential, we combined a well-established mouse model of AD with a genetically diverse reference panel to generate mice that harbor identical high-risk human mutations but differ across the remainder of their genome. We first show that genetic variation profoundly modifies the impact of human AD mutations on both cognitive and pathological phenotypes. We then validate this complex AD model by demonstrating high degrees of genetic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic overlap with human AD. Overall, work here both introduces a novel AD mouse population as an innovative and reproducible resource for the study of mechanisms underlying AD and provides evidence that preclinical models incorporating genetic diversity may better translate to human disease."

By contrast, deletion of three intra-TAD CTCF-independent 3D contact sites caused a domain-wide early-to-late RT shift, an A-to-B compartment switch, weakening of TAD architecture, and loss of transcription. The dispensability of TAD boundaries and the necessity of these “early replication control elements” (ERCEs) was validated by deletions and inversions at additional domains. Our results demonstrate that discrete cis-regulatory elements orchestrate domain-wide RT, A/B compartmentalization, TAD architecture, and transcription, revealing fundamental principles linking genome structure and function. The temporal order of DNA replication (replication timing [RT]) is highly coupled with genome architecture, but cis-elements regulating either remain elusive.

Eukaryotic DNA replication follows a defined temporal order (replication timing [RT]). In mammals, developmentally regulated changes in the RT program occur in units of 400–800 kilobases (replication domains [RDs]) that correlate with changes in transcriptional potential (Rivera-Mulia and Gilbert, 2016Rivera-Mulia J.C. Gilbert D.M. Replication timing and transcriptional control: beyond cause and effect-part III.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 40: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Defects in RT occur in several diseases, correlated with mis-regulation of genes and associated with defects in chromosome condensation, sister chromatid cohesion, and genome instability (Koren et al., 2014Koren A. Handsaker R.E. Kamitaki N. Karlić R. Ghosh S. Polak P. Eggan K. McCarroll S.A.

Hematol. 2017; 51: 71-82Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). RT is also closely aligned with genome architecture. Early cytological studies observed sites of briefly labeled DNA synthesis as punctate foci that persist as stable units of chromosome structure throughout multiple cell cycles (Solovei et al., 2016Solovei I. Thanisch K. Feodorova Y. How to rule the nucleus: divide et impera.Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 2016; 40: 47-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). These units are spatially compartmentalized such that early replicating foci are dispersed throughout the interior of the nucleus, while late replicating foci are in close proximity to the nuclear lamina and nucleoli. The structure and compartmentalization of RDs can now be mapped molecularly. High throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) reveals two major compartments of chromatin interaction (A and B) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M.

Hi-C also detects units of self-interacting chromatin called “topologically associating domains” (TADs) (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B.

A/B compartments often consist of several adjacent RDs that replicate at similar times, while individual RDs change their RT and compartment during differentiation (Dixon et al., 2015Dixon J.R.

Both TAD structure and A/B compartment organization are dismantled during mitosis and re-assembled during early G1 phase, coincident with the re-establishment of an RT program (Dileep et al., 2015aDileep V. Ay F. Sima J. Vera D.L. Noble W.S. Gilbert D.M. Topologically associating domains and their long-range contacts are established during early G1 coincident with the establishment of the replication-timing program.Genome Res. 2015; 25: 1104-1113Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The heterogeneity of TADs and the nomenclature reflecting their mechanisms of establishment are still being debated. Here, we define TADs as they were originally defined (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R. Selvaraj S. Yue F. Kim A. Li Y. Shen Y. Hu M. Liu J.S. Ren B.

TADs are heterogeneous and often nested, consisting of at least two categories distinguished by whether their architecture is primarily driven by CTCF and cohesin-dependent loop extrusion versus poorly understood CTCF and cohesin-independent mechanisms (Dixon et al., 2012Dixon J.R.

Organizational principles of 3D genome architecture.Nat. Rev. Genet. 2018; 19: 789-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). Because some TAD boundaries align much more strongly to RD boundaries than others (Pope et al., 2014Pope B.D. Ryba T. Dileep V. Yue F. Wu W. Denas O. Vera D.L. Wang Y. Hansen R.S. Canfield T.K. et al.Topologically associating domains are stable units of replication-timing regulation.Nature. 2014; 515: 402-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (543) Google Scholar), it is possible that a specific category of TADs is more tightly related to RT. The molecular mechanisms regulating the spatiotemporal regulation of replication are poorly understood. Perturbations of many chromatin regulatory proteins have only partial or localized effects on RT or A/B Hi-C compartments (Dileep et al., 2015bDileep V. Rivera-Mulia J.C. Sima J. Gilbert D.M.

Thus, it is not clear whether such large-scale regulation is genetic or epigenetic and whether any role for DNA sequence would be via discrete elements or more complex features such as overall nucleotide composition or secondary structure. Early studies suggested that the β-globin Locus control region (LCR) is sufficient to advance RT at ectopic loci (Goren et al., 2008Goren A. Tabib A. Hecht M. Cedar H. DNA replication timing of the human beta-globin domain is controlled by histone modification at the origin.Genes Dev. 2008; 22: 1319-1324Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, Simon et al., 2001Simon I.

Developmental regulation of DNA replication timing at the human beta globin locus.EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6150-6157Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), but targeted deletion of the LCR at its native locus had no effect on RT (Cimbora et al., 2000Cimbora D.M.

Long-distance control of origin choice and replication timing in the human beta-globin locus are independent of the locus control region.Mol. Cell.

DNA sequence-dependent compartmentalization and silencing of chromatin at the nuclear lamina.Cell. 2012; 149: 1474-1487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (316) Google Scholar), and a human chromosome has been shown to retain its RT regulation when carried in a mouse host (Pope et al., 2012Pope B.D.

Replication-timing boundaries facilitate cell-type and species-specific regulation of a rearranged human chromosome in mouse.Hum. Mol. Genet. 2012; 21: 4162-4170Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), consistent with a role for the underlying DNA sequence in spatiotemporal regulation. To search for putative cis-acting elements, we performed CRISPR-mediated deletions and inversions at a pluripotency-associated RD in mouse ESCs (mESCs). Deletion of the boundaries of this RD or CTCF protein depletion, which weakens the boundaries of most domains, had no consequence on RT. However, we identified cis-regulatory elements within the domain that are responsible for early replication, compartmentalization, local chromatin architecture, and transcription. These elements have properties of enhancers and their prediction genome-wide was validated at multiple loci. These results demonstrate the existence of cis-acting elements controlling the replication timing and 3D architecture of chromosome domains and suggest mechanisms by which they function. The murine Dppa2/4 domain on chromosome 16 (Figures 1A and S1) contains 3 active genes: Dppa4, Dppa2, and Morc1/Morc (Figure 1A). Dppa4 and Dppa2 are important pluripotency markers (Hernandez et al., 2018Hernandez C. Wang Z. Ramazanov B. Tang Y. Mehta S. Dambrot C. Lee Y.-W. Tessema K. Kumar I.

Morc1 is also highly expressed in ESCs and contains an alternative transcription start site (TSS) ∼180 kilobases (kb) downstream (Morc) of the Morc1 TSS (Figure S1B). The Dppa2/4 domain corresponds to a TAD whose boundaries are demarcated by a pair of convergent CTCF and cohesin binding sites without forming prominent corner peaks on the contact map (Nora et al., 2017Nora E.P.

Early-to-late RT regulation of the Dppa2/4 domain during loss of pluripotency coincides with repression of all three genes, spatial compaction of the domain, movement to the nuclear periphery, and a change in A/B compartment (Hiratani et al., 2010Hiratani I.

https://openalex.org/W2885236691,"Covalent DNA-protein cross-links (DPCs) impede replication fork progression and threaten genome integrity. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we previously showed that replication fork collision with DPCs causes their proteolysis, followed by translesion DNA synthesis. We show here that when DPC proteolysis is blocked, the replicative DNA helicase CMG (CDC45, MCM2-7, GINS), which travels on the leading strand template, bypasses an intact leading strand DPC. Single-molecule imaging reveals that GINS does not dissociate from CMG during bypass and that CMG slows dramatically after bypass, likely due to uncoupling from the stalled leading strand. The DNA helicase RTEL1 facilitates bypass, apparently by generating single-stranded DNA beyond the DPC. The absence of RTEL1 impairs DPC proteolysis, suggesting that CMG must bypass the DPC to enable proteolysis. Our results suggest a mechanism that prevents inadvertent CMG destruction by DPC proteases, and they reveal CMG's remarkable capacity to overcome obstacles on its translocation strand."
https://openalex.org/W2906793609,"Natural killer (NK) cells develop from common progenitors but diverge into distinct subsets, which differ in cytokine production, cytotoxicity, homing, and memory traits. Given their promise in adoptive cell therapies for cancer, a deeper understanding of regulatory modules controlling clinically beneficial NK phenotypes is of high priority. We report integrated “-omics” analysis of human NK subsets, which revealed super-enhancers associated with gene cohorts that may coordinate NK functions and localization. A transcription factor-based regulatory scheme also emerged, which is evolutionarily conserved and shared by innate and adaptive lymphocytes. For both NK and T lineages, a TCF1-LEF1-MYC axis dominated the regulatory landscape of long-lived, proliferative subsets that traffic to lymph nodes. In contrast, effector populations circulating between blood and peripheral tissues shared a PRDM1-dominant landscape. This resource defines transcriptional modules, regulated by feedback loops, which may be leveraged to enhance phenotypes for NK cell-based therapies."
https://openalex.org/W2907960662,"Self-renewal and differentiation of pluripotent murine embryonic stem cells (ESCs) is regulated by extrinsic signaling pathways. It is less clear whether cellular metabolism instructs developmental progression. In an unbiased genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screen, we identified components of a conserved amino-acid-sensing pathway as critical drivers of ESC differentiation. Functional analysis revealed that lysosome activity, the Ragulator protein complex, and the tumor-suppressor protein Folliculin enable the Rag GTPases C and D to bind and seclude the bHLH transcription factor Tfe3 in the cytoplasm. In contrast, ectopic nuclear Tfe3 represses specific developmental and metabolic transcriptional programs that are associated with peri-implantation development. We show differentiation-specific and non-canonical regulation of Rag GTPase in ESCs and, importantly, identify point mutations in a Tfe3 domain required for cytoplasmic inactivation as potentially causal for a human developmental disorder. Our work reveals an instructive and biomedically relevant role of metabolic signaling in licensing embryonic cell fate transitions."

Here, we demonstrate that the cholinergic system controls the integrative operations of neocortical principal neurons by modulating dendritic excitability. Direct dendritic recordings revealed that the optogenetic-evoked release of acetylcholine (ACh) transformed the pattern of dendritic integration in layer 5B pyramidal neurons, leading to the generation of dendritic plateau potentials which powerfully drove repetitive action potential output. In contrast, the synaptic release of ACh did not positively modulate axo-somatic excitability. Mechanistically, the transformation of dendritic integration was mediated by the muscarinic ACh receptor-dependent enhancement of dendritic R-type calcium channel activity, a compartment-dependent modulation which decisively controlled the associative computations executed by layer 5B pyramidal neurons.

To directly examine whether activation of the cholinergic system dynamically controls dendritic information processing in the principal output neurons of the neocortex, we made simultaneous whole-cell recordings from the soma and distal apical dendrites of layer 5B (L5B) pyramidal neurons in brain slices of the somatosensory neocortex prepared from mice which selectively expressed channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) in cholinergic neurons under the control of the cholineacetyltransferase (ChAT) promoter (Pinto et al., 2013Pinto L.

The optogenetic-evoked release of ACh from cholinergic axons, which ramified throughout the neocortical layers, was found to profoundly and selectively modulate the electrical excitability of apical dendrites (Figures 1A–1D and S1). In each neuron tested, a brief (4 ms) full-field photoactivation light pulse centered at the dendritic recording site transformed the output of dendritic integration from a single dendritic spike that drove a transient burst of action potential (AP) output to long-duration dendritic plateau potentials, which evoked sustained trains of AP firing (Figures 1A, 1D, S3A, and S3D; n = 66 trials, n = 13 neurons; dendritic current step: amplitude = 0.63 ± 0.04 nA, duration = 0.5 s). This transformation was apparent both immediately (50 ms) and 3.55 s after photoactivation and subsequently decayed with an exponential time course (Figures 1A, 1D, 2A–2D , S3A, and S3D; distribution significantly different from before photoactivation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p < 0.0001 [50 ms], p < 0.0001 [3.55 s]; decay time constant = 23.1 s, n = 13 neurons). This cholinergic modulation of dendritic excitability was unaccompanied by changes in dendritic membrane potential, input resistance, or the area of subthreshold dendritic voltage responses, suggesting the neuromodulation of specific classes of ion channels (Figures 1A, 1D, and 2A–2D; Δ membrane potential = 0.23 ± 0.08 mV, n = 13 neurons; Δ apparent input resistance = 0.65 ± 0.21 MΩ). In contrast to the powerful control of dendritic excitability, simultaneous somatic recording demonstrated that the brief (4 ms) optogenetic-evoked release of ACh had a minimal direct influence on axo-somatic excitability, failing to significantly alter the number of APs evoked by somatic positive current steps, when full-field photoactivation was centered at somatic or dendritic sites (Figures 1C, 1D, S3B, and S3E; distributions not significantly different from before photoactivation, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p = 0.3359 [50 ms], p = 0.2402 [3.55 s], n = 68 trials, n = 13 neurons; somatic current step: amplitude = 0.30 ± 0.04 nA, duration = 0.5 s). Together, these data reveal that the cholinergic system acts to specifically modulate dendritic excitability in the principal output neurons of the neocortex.Figure 2The Phasic Release of Endogenous ACh Selectively and Reversibly Enhances Dendritic ExcitabilityShow full caption(A) Continuous record of voltage responses recorded from the distal apical dendrite (Vdend) of a mouse L5B pyramidal neuron evoked by supra- (upper) or sub-threshold (lower) current pulses (Idend).

Pharmacological analysis revealed that the optogenetic-evoked cholinergic enhancement of apical dendritic excitability was abolished by the selective antagonism of M1 AChRs (Figures 1E, 1F, and S3C; number of APs after [3.55 s] photoactivation: control = 11.7 ± 1.1, telenzepine [100 nM] = 2.1 ± 0.1; t test, p = 0.0005, n = 37 trials, n = 7 neurons). In contrast, the broad-spectrum nAChR antagonist hexamethonium did not alter the cholinergic transformation of dendritic excitability (area of dendritic response; control: before = 14.2 ± 0.8 mV.s, after [3.55 s] = 26.2 ± 1.9 mV.s; hexamethonium: before = 15.4 ± 0.8 mV.s, after [3.55 s] = 25.9 ± 1.7 mV.s; t test, not significantly different, n = 5). The antagonism of nAChRs, however, blocked the small-amplitude, short-duration excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) evoked by optogenetic activation when delivered in isolation (Hedrick and Waters, 2015Hedrick T.

In contrast to the long-lasting control of L5B pyramidal neuron apical dendritic excitability, the optogenetic-evoked release of ACh did not lead to a sustained enhancement of the excitability of interneurons (Figures S5F and S5G; number of APs evoked by current pulses: before = 6.7 ± 0.3; after [3.55 s] photoactivation = 7.0 ± 0.3; Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, not significantly different, p = 0.5996, n = 80 trials, n = 16 neurons). To explore the profile of cholinergic activation which triggered the generation of short-duration nAChR-mediated EPSPs in interneurons and L5B pyramidal neurons when evoked in isolation, and the selective longer-lasting M1 AChR-mediated enhancement of suprathreshold apical dendritic excitability in L5B pyramidal neurons, we investigated the pattern of AP firing evoked by optogenetic activation of BF cholinergic neurons (Figures 2E–2G, S4, and S6). Direct recording from identified nucleus basalis (NB) magnocellular cholinergic neurons, which widely innervate the neocortex (Kalmbach et al., 2012Kalmbach A. Hedrick T. Waters J. Selective optogenetic stimulation of cholinergic axons in neocortex.J. Neurophysiol. 2012; 107: 2008-2019Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar), revealed that brief (4 ms) full-field optogenetic stimuli evoked a single AP in 454 of 468 trials in cell-attached and whole-cell recordings (Figures 2E–2G; latency to AP peak = 8.42 ± 0.06 ms, n = 14 visually targeted in brain slices prepared from ChAT-Cre-ChR2-EYFP mice), a finding consistent with the time-locked and transient AP firing of this population of neurons during reinforcement behavior (Hangya et al., 2015Hangya B.

Central cholinergic neurons are rapidly recruited by reinforcement feedback.Cell. 2015; 162: 1155-1168Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar). Furthermore, because of the long-lasting after-hyperpolarization potentials which followed APs (Hedrick and Waters, 2010Hedrick T. Waters J. Physiological properties of cholinergic and non-cholinergic magnocellular neurons in acute slices from adult mouse nucleus basalis.PLoS ONE. 2010; 5: e11046Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), a single AP was evoked in NB magnocellular cholinergic neurons by longer-duration light stimuli (4–20 ms; n = 13), and repetitive low-frequency AP firing was only manifest in response to prolonged periods of photoactivation (Figure S6; AP firing rate [1 s photoactivation] = 3.7 ± 1.1 Hz, n = 6; rheobase step current-evoked AP threshold = −33.1 ± 1.0 mV; fast AP after-hyperpolarization potential = −26.8 ± 1.9 mV; slow AP after-hyperpolarization potential = −36.9 ± 1.2 mV, n = 14). Consistent with this, the time course of nAChR-mediated EPSPs recorded from supragranular neocortical interneurons did not change when the duration of the optogenetic activation pulse was increased from 4 to 20 ms (Figures S4H and S4I; EPSP half-width [4 ms] = 125.0 ± 7.0 ms; EPSP half-width [20 ms] = 135 ± 9.2 ms; t test, not significantly different, p = 0.193, n = 6). Furthermore, analysis of nAChR-mediated EPSPs in interneurons revealed that their onset latencies exhibited trial-to-trial temporal jitter consistent with the jitter in the timing of APs evoked in NB magnocellular cholinergic neurons in response to identical light stimuli (Figures S4A and S4D). Similarly, brief optogenetic stimuli evoked a transient, highly time-locked, burst of AP firing in a sparsely distributed population of identified cholinergic neocortical interneurons (von Engelhardt et al., 2007von Engelhardt J. Eliava M. Meyer A.H. Rozov A. Monyer H. Functional characterization of intrinsic cholinergic interneurons in the cortex.J. Neurosci. 2007; 27: 5633-5642Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) (Figure S7; light stimuli [4 ms]: APs per trial = 1.86 ± 0.03; inter-spike frequency = 280.3 ± 1.7 Hz; latency to AP peak = 9.61 ± 0.07 ms; n = 576 trials, n = 12 neurons). Together, these data suggest that the brief optogenetic activation of cholinergic axons drives transient AP firing, leading to the phasic release of ACh, which in L5B pyramidal neurons evokes a long-lasting enhancement of apical dendritic excitability through the action of metabotropic AChRs. Consistent with this pharmacological profile, simultaneous dendro-somatic recordings from rat L5B pyramidal neurons revealed that the bath application of the mAChR agonist muscarine (2.5 μM) transformed the pattern of dendritic-current-evoked electrogenesis, leading to the generation of long-duration dendritic plateau potentials, which drove repetitive AP firing (Figures 3A–3C; dendritic recording distance from soma = 715 ± 17 μm; dendritic excitation, AP firing rate: control = 2.9 ± 0.3 Hz, muscarine [2.5 μM] = 22.1 ± 1.8 Hz, t test, p < 0.0001, n = 16; dendritic excitation, current step: amplitude = 1.6 nA, duration = 0.6 s). This positive modulation of dendritic signaling was unaccompanied by changes in apparent input resistance or the current threshold for dendritic spike initiation (Δ apparent input resistance = 0.78 ± 0.58 MΩ; dendritic spike rheobase: control = 1.19 ± 0.03 nA, muscarine [2.5 μM] = 1.21 ± 0.04 nA, t te"

Herein, bacterial strains were first isolated from dairy products and human feces and then screened in vitro for their immunomodulatory activity. Five selected strains were further analyzed in vivo, using a mouse model of diet-induced obesity. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat high-sucrose diet, in combination with 1 of 3 Lactobacillus strains (Lb38, L. plantarum; L79, L. paracasei/casei; Lb102, L. rhamnosus) or Bifidobacterium strains (Bf26, Bf141, 2 different strains of B. animalis ssp. lactis species) administered for 8 wk at 109 colony-forming units/d. Whereas 3 strains showed only modest (Lb38, Bf26) or no (L79) effects, Lb102 and Bf141 reduced diet-induced obesity, visceral fat accretion, and inflammation, concomitant with improvement of glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. Further analysis revealed that Lb102 and Bf141 enhanced intestinal integrity markers in association with selective changes in gut microbiota composition. We have thus identified 2 new potential probiotic bacterial strains with immunometabolic properties to alleviate obesity development and associated metabolic disturbances.-Le Barz, M., Daniel, N., Varin, T.

Except for the virion, which acts as infectious particles, the function of those particles remains elusive. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have been revealed to have biological functions. The EVs which size are less than 100 nm in diameter, were collected from HBV infected-patients. These vesicles contain, complete and incomplete virions, and exosomes, which have been recently shown to be critical as intercellular communicators. Here, the effects of the exosome, the complete, and the incomplete particles on the target cells were investigated. These particles are endocytosed by monocyte/macrophages and function primarily to upregulate PD-L1. The functions and composition of the EVs were affected by nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), suggesting that the EVs are involved in the pathogenesis of HBV hepatitis and clinical course of those patients treated by NRTIs."
https://openalex.org/W2908174501,"Aims Previous studies and community information about everyday difficulties in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) have focussed on domains such as reading and driving. Here, we provide the first in-depth examination of how impaired face perception impacts social interactions and quality of life in AMD. We also develop a Faces and Social Life in AMD brochure and information sheet, plus accompanying conversation starter, aimed at AMD patients and those who interact with them (family, friends, nursing home staff). Method Semi-structured face-to-face interviews were conducted with 21 AMD patients covering the full range from mild vision loss to legally blind. Thematic analysis was used to explore the range of patient experiences. Results Patients reported faces appeared blurred and/or distorted. They described recurrent failures to recognise others' identity, facial expressions and emotional states, plus failures of alternative non-face strategies (e.g., hairstyle, voice). They reported failures to follow social nuances (e.g., to pick up that someone was joking), and feelings of missing out ('I can't join in'). Concern about offending others (e.g., by unintentionally ignoring them) was common, as were concerns of appearing fraudulent ('Other people don't understand'). Many reported social disengagement. Many reported specifically face-perception-related reductions in social life, confidence, and quality of life. All effects were observed even with only mild vision loss. Patients endorsed the value of our Faces and Social Life in AMD Information Sheet, developed from the interview results, and supported future technological assistance (digital image enhancement). Conclusion Poor face perception in AMD is an important domain contributing to impaired social interactions and quality of life. This domain should be directly assessed in quantitative quality of life measures, and in resources designed to improve community understanding. The identity-related social difficulties mirror those in prosopagnosia, of cortical rather than retinal origin, implying findings may generalise to all low-vision disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2907209722,"Agriculture is undergoing important changes in order to meet sustainable soil management with respect to biodiversity (namely agroecology). Within this context, alternative solutions to mineral fertilizers such as agricultural biostimulants are thus promoted and being developed. The mechanisms by which some soil biostimulants sustain soil biological functioning and indirectly increase crop yields are still unknown. Our goal in the present study was to demonstrate if and to what extent the application of a soil biostimulant affects the soil heterotrophic microbial communities that are involved in organic matter decomposition and carbon mineralization. We hypothesized that the addition of a biostimulant results in changes in the composition and in the biomass of soil microbial communities. This in turn increases the mineralization of the organic matter derived from crop residues. We performed soil microcosm experiments with the addition of crop residues and a biostimulant, and we monitored the organic carbon (orgC) mineralization and the microbial biomass, along with the microbial community composition by sequencing 16S rRNA gene and ITS amplicons. The addition of a soil biostimulant caused a pH neutralizing effect and simultaneous enhancement of the orgC mineralization of crop residues (+ 400 μg orgC g-1 dry soil) and microbial biomass (+ 60 μg orgC g-1 dry soil) that were linked to changes in the soil microbial communities. Our findings suggest that the soil carbon mineralization enhancement in the presence of the biostimulant was supported by the specific recruitment of soil bacteria and fungi. Whereas archaea remained stable, several operational taxonomic units (OTUs) of indigenous soil bacteria and fungi were enriched and affiliated with known microbial decomposers such as Cytophagaceae, Phaselicystis sp., Verrucomicrobia, Pseudomonas sp., Ramicandelaber sp., and Mortierella sp., resulting in lower soil microbial richness and diversity."

Three different grades of green tea were measured with the electronic nose and electronic tongue. The sensor array of the E-nose was optimized by correlation analysis. The relationship between the signal of the optimized sensor array and the bitterness and astringency of green tea was developed using multiple linear regression (MLR), partial least squares regression (PLSR), and back propagation neural network (BPNN). BPNN is a multilayer feedforward neural network trained by an error propagation algorithm. The results showed that the BPNN model possessed good ability to predict the bitterness and astringency of green tea, with high correlation coefficients (R = 0.98 for bitterness and R = 0.96 for astringency) and relatively lower root mean square errors (RMSE) (0.25 for bitterness and 0.32 for astringency) for the calibration set. The R value is 0.92 and 0.87, and the RMSE is 0.34 and 0.55, for bitterness and astringency, respectively, of the prediction set. These results indicate that the electronic nose could be used as a feasible and reliable method to evaluate the taste of green tea. These results can provide a theoretical reference for rapid detection of the bitter and astringent taste of green tea using volatile odor information."
https://openalex.org/W2908161680,"Background Homicide kills more people than war globally and is associated with income inequality. In Brazil, one of the most unequal countries of the world, the homicide rate is four times higher than the world average. Establishing if the Brazilian conditional cash transfer programme [Bolsa Familia Programme (BFP)], the largest in the world, is associated with a reduction in the rate of homicide is relevant for violence prevention programs. We aimed to assess the effect of BFP coverage on homicide and hospitalization rates from violence. Methods BFP coverage and rates of homicide (overall and disaggregated by sex and age) and hospitalizations from violence from all 5,507 Brazilian municipalities between 2004 and 2012 were explored using multivariable negative binomial regression models with fixed effect for panel data. Robustness of results was explored using sensitivity analyses such as difference-in-difference models. Findings Homicide rates and hospitalization from violence decreased as BFP coverage in the target population increased. For each percent increase in the uptake of the BFP, the homicide rate decreased by 0.3% (Rate Ratio:0.997; 95%CI:0.996–0.997) and hospitalizations from violence by 0.4% (RR: 0.996;95%CI:0.995–0.996). Rates of homicide and hospitalizations from violence were also negatively associated with the duration of BFP coverage. When, coverage of the target population was at least 70% for one-year, hospitalizations from violence decreased by 8%; two-years 14%, three-years 20%, and four years 25%. Interpretation Our results support the hypothesis that conditional cash transfer programs might have as an additional benefit the prevention of homicides and hospitalizations from violence. Social protection interventions could contribute to decrease levels of violence in low-and-middle-income-countries through reducing poverty and/or socioeconomic inequalities."

Despite tremendous efforts, effective pharmacological agents for the treatment of obesity are still limited. Here, we showed that in contrast to lactate receptor GPR81, niacin receptor GPR109A-deficient mice had progressive weight gain and hepatic fat accumulation. Using high-fat diet–induced mouse model of obesity, we demonstrated that niacin treatment apparently protected against obesity without affecting food intake in wild-type mice but not in GPR109A-deficient mice. Further investigation showed that niacin treatment led to a remarkable inhibition of hepatic de novo lipogenesis. Additionally, we demonstrated that niacin treatment triggered brown adipose tissue and/or white adipose tissue thermogenic activity via activation of GPR109A. Moreover, we observed that mice exposed to niacin exhibited a dramatic decrease in intestinal absorption of sterols and fatty acids. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that acting on GPR109A, niacin shows the potential to maintain energy homeostasis through multipathways, representing a potential approach to the treatment of obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease.—Ye, L., Cao, Z., Lai, X., Wang, W., Guo, Z., Yan, L., Wang, Y., Shi, Y., Zhou, N.

https://openalex.org/W2950283115,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that is implicated in 99.7% of cervical cancers and several other cancers that affect both men and women. Despite the role that HPV plays in an estimated 5% of all cancers and the evolving role of HPV vaccination and testing in protecting the public against these cancers, preliminary research in New Zealand health professionals suggest knowledge about HPV may not be sufficient. Methods A total of 230 practice nurses, smear takers and other clinical and laboratory staff who attended a range of training events completed a cross-sectional survey between April 2016 and July 2017. The survey explored four broad areas: demographics and level of experience, HPV knowledge (general HPV knowledge, HPV triage and test of cure (TOC) knowledge and HPV vaccine knowledge), attitudes towards the HPV vaccine and self-perceived adequacy of HPV knowledge. Results The mean score on the general HPV knowledge questions was 13.2 out of 15, with only 25.2% of respondents scoring 100%. In response to an additional question, 12.7% thought (or were unsure) that HPV causes HIV/AIDS. The mean score on the HPV Triage and TOC knowledge questions was 7.4 out of 10, with only 9.1% scoring 100%. The mean score on the HPV vaccine knowledge questions was 6.0 out of 7 and 44.3% scored 100%. Only 63.7% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed that they were adequately informed about HPV, although 73.3% agreed or strongly agreed that they could confidently answer HPV-related questions asked by patients. Multivariate analyses revealed that knowledge in each domain predicted confidence in responding to patient questions. Furthermore, the number of years since training predicted both HPV knowledge and Triage and TOC knowledge. Discussion Although overall level of knowledge was adequate, there were significant gaps in knowledge, particularly about the role of HPV testing in the New Zealand National Cervical Screening Programme. More education is required to ensure that misinformation and stigma do not inadvertently result from interactions between health professionals and the public."
https://openalex.org/W2908437933,"Introduction Living donor kidney transplantation is preferable to deceased donor transplantation due to its superior long-term patient and graft survivals. However, ABO blood group incompatibility is a major barrier to living donor kidney transplantation. ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation has been performed in Japan since the late 1980’s, but it is still globally uncommon. The objective of this study is to compare the clinical outcomes of ABO-incompatible kidney transplantation (ABO-IKT) with that of ABO-compatible kidney transplantation (ABO-CKT) at an institution where only about two kidney transplants are performed a month on average. Design A single center propensity score-matched cohort study. Patients and methods We retrospectively collected and analyzed the data of 240 patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) who underwent living donor kidney transplantation at Osaka City University Hospital from January 1999 to December 2016, of which 66 patients were ABO-IKT. The remaining 174 patients who underwent ABO-CKT were studied as the control group, and the clinical outcomes of ABO-IKT and ABO-CKT recipients were compared based on propensity score matching. Results After propensity score matching, there were no significant differences in both patient survival and death-censored graft survival rates between the ABO-IKT and ABO-CKT groups. Moreover, there were no significant differences in estimated glomerular filtration rate as well as frequency of acute cellular rejection, antibody-mediated rejection, infectious adverse events, malignancies, and post-operative bleeding between the two groups. Conclusion Currently, ABO-IKT may be an acceptable treatment for patients with ESKD even at a low-volume transplant center."
https://openalex.org/W2906015224,"Primases have a fundamental role in DNA replication. They synthesize a primer that is then extended by DNA polymerases. Archaeoeukaryotic primases require for synthesis a catalytic and an accessory domain, the exact contribution of the latter being unresolved. For the pRN1 archaeal primase, this domain is a 115-amino acid helix bundle domain (HBD). Our structural investigations of this small HBD by liquid- and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) revealed that only the HBD binds the DNA template. DNA binding becomes sequence-specific after a major allosteric change in the HBD, triggered by the binding of two nucleotide triphosphates. The spatial proximity of the two nucleotides and the DNA template in the quaternary structure of the HBD strongly suggests that this small domain brings together the substrates to prepare the first catalytic step of primer synthesis. This efficient mechanism is likely general for all archaeoeukaryotic primases."
https://openalex.org/W2907624885,"Reticulon (RTN) 3 reduces amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques (APs) by negative modulation of β-secretase 1 (BACE1) activity. However, RTN3 aggregates easily, which offsets RTN3's inhibitory effect on BACE1 activity and exacerbates AP deposition. We found that BAP31 was a binding partner of RTN3 and positively correlated with the expression level of RTN3. To further explore how BAP31 is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), conditional knockout mice with targeted BAP31 deletion (B-KO) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were generated and hybridized with amyloid precursor protein (APP) PS1 transgenic (AD model) mice to obtain B-KO-AD mice. BAP31 knock out in primary hippocampal neurons decreased RTN3 monomer availability and enhanced the level of RTN3 aggregates, indicating that BAP31 deficiency increases the instability of RTN3. More importantly, these effects contributed to BACE1-mediated APP processing and were responsible for the increased APs in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of B-KO-AD mice. Thus, elevated expression of BAP31 in the human brain is likely to reduce the formation of both RTN3 aggregates and Aβ by enhancing the stability of RTN3.-Wang, T., Chen, J., Hou, Y., Yu, Y., Wang, B.

https://openalex.org/W2906904747,"Aurora kinase A (AURKA) is necessary for proper primary cilium disassembly before mitosis. We found that depletion of caveolin-1 expression promotes primary cilia formation through the proteasomal-dependent degradation of aurora kinase A and induces premature senescence in human fibroblasts. Down-regulation of intraflagellar transport-88, a protein essential for ciliogenesis, inhibits premature senescence induced by the depletion of caveolin-1. In support of these findings, we showed that alisertib, a pharmacological inhibitor of AURKA, causes primary cilia formation and cellular senescence by irreversibly arresting cell growth. Suppression of primary cilia formation limits cellular senescence induced by alisertib. The primary cilium must be disassembled to free its centriole to form the centrosome, a necessary structure for mitotic spindle assembly and cell division. We showed that the use of the centriole to form primary cilia blocks centrosome formation and mitotic spindle assembly and prevents the completion of mitosis in cells in which cellular senescence is caused by the inhibition of AURKA. We also found that AURKA is down-regulated and primary cilia formation is enhanced when cellular senescence is promoted by other senescence-inducing stimuli, such as oxidative stress and UV light. Thus, we propose that impaired AURKA function induces premature senescence by preventing reabsorption of the primary cilium, which inhibits centrosome and mitotic spindle formation and consequently prevents the completion of mitosis. Our study causally links the inability of the cell to disassemble the primary cilium, a microtubule-based cellular organelle, to the development of premature senescence, a functionally and pathologically relevant cellular state.—Jeffries, E.

Computational tools that predict the course and severity of these symptoms have the potential to assist oncology clinicians to personalize the patient's treatment regimen more efficiently and provide more aggressive and timely interventions. Three common and inter-related symptoms in cancer patients are depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbance. In this paper, we elaborate on the efficiency of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and Non-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis by Neural Networks (n-CCA) to predict the severity of the aforementioned symptoms between two different time points during a cycle of chemotherapy (CTX). Our results demonstrate that these two methods produced equivalent results for all three symptoms. These types of predictive models can be used to identify high risk patients, educate patients about their symptom experience, and improve the timing of pre-emptive and personalized symptom management interventions."
https://openalex.org/W2906803945,"Neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration are common during prion infection, but the mechanisms that underlie these pathological features are not well understood. Several components of innate immunity, such as Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 and Complement C1q, have been shown to influence prion disease. To identify additional components of innate immunity that might impact prion disease within the central nervous system (CNS), we screened RNA from brains of pre-clinical and clinical 22L-infected mice for alterations in genes associated with innate immunity. Transcription of several genes encoding damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) proteins and receptors were increased in the brains of prion-infected mice. To investigate the role of some of these proteins in prion disease of the CNS, we infected mice deficient in DAMP receptor genes Tlr2, C3ar1, and C5ar1 with 22L scrapie. Elimination of TLR2 accelerated disease by a median of 10 days, while lack of C3aR1 or C5aR1 had no effect on disease tempo. Histopathologically, all knockout mouse strains tested were similar to infected control mice in gliosis, vacuolation, and PrPSc deposition. Analysis of proinflammatory markers in the brains of infected knockout mice indicated only a few alterations in gene expression suggesting that C5aR1 and TLR2 signaling did not act synergistically in the brains of prion-infected mice. These results indicate that signaling through TLR2 confers partial neuroprotection during prion infection."
https://openalex.org/W2908114135,"Cathepsin C (CtsC) functions as a central coordinator for activation of many serine proteases in immune cells. However, CtsC expression in gastric epithelial cells and its role in Helicobacter pylori infection remain unclear. Real-time PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry analyses identified that CtsC was decreased in gastric mucosa of H. pylori–infected patients and mice. Isolated gastric epithelial cells and cell lines were stimulated with H. pylori and/or TGF-β1 showed that down-regulation of CtsC in gastric epithelial cells largely depended on H. pylori cagA via Src/ERK and Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways, and the effect could be synergistically augmented by TGF-β1 in an autocrine manner. In human gastric mucosa, CtsC expression was negatively correlated with bacteria colonization; accordingly, provision of exogenous active CtsC overwhelmed H. pylori persistence in gastric mucosa of mice. In the presence of active CtsC, isolated human neutrophils activated via NF-κB pathway with augmented bactericidal capacity in vitro. We also found that neutrophils activated and cleared bacteria in active CtsC-injected mice and that there was no bactericidal capacity in mice that were simultaneously neutrophil-depleted by Ly6G antibody. Our findings identified a mechanism that H. pylori abrogate CtsC to impair neutrophil activation and to ensure persistence in gastric mucosa.

Methods COSTOP was a double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Patients aged ≥18 years, on CPT, and stable on ART (CD4 counts ≥250 cells/μL); were randomised to daily oral placebo (PLC group) or cotrimoxazole 960 mg/tablet (CTX group). Co-primary outcomes were: (i) time to first cotrimoxazole-preventable infection, with non- inferiority of PLC defined as the upper one-sided 95% confidence limit of the adjusted hazard ratio(aHR) ≤1.25; and (ii) time to first grade 3/4 haematological adverse event. Findings 2180 subjects (1091 PLC; 1089 CTX) were enrolled. 932 PLC and 943 CTX completed the trial after 12 months minimum follow up. Ninety-eight participants (59 PLC; 39 CTX) experienced 120 cotrimoxazole- preventable events, mainly bacterial pneumonia (72 events, 4 deaths PLC); (48 events, 2 deaths CTX). The aHR for time to first event was 1.57 (upper one-sided 95% confidence limit 2.21) in per protocol population (similar results in ITT population). 551 participants (318 CTX; 233 PLC) experienced 1043 haematological adverse events (616 CTX; 427 PLC). Time to the first adverse event, mainly neutropenia, was shorter in the CTX group (aHR 0.70 95%CI 0.59–0.82; log-rank χ2 = 18.08; P<0.0001). 362 (276 PLC, 86 CTX) participants experienced at least one episode of confirmed clinical malaria (P<0.0001). Interpretation In ART stable patients with CD4 counts ≥250 cells/μL, continued CPT significantly reduces risk of severe bacterial infections and protects against malaria, while discontinuing CPT reduces haematological adverse events."

The event log is robust in terms of data, containing a total of 262 200 event logs, belonging to 13 087 different credit applications. The goal is to work out a decision model, which represents the underlying tasks that make up the loan application service. To this end we study the impact of incomplete event logs (for instance workers forget to register their tasks). The absence of data is translated into a drastic decrease of precision and compromises the decision models, leading to biased and unrepresentative results. We use non-classical probability to show we can better reduce the error percentage of inferences as opposed to classical probability."

A supine bicycle ergometer was employed to reach twice the resting heart rate during continuous exercise, blood pressure and heart rate were recorded. Bi-ventricular parameters and aortic stiffness were assessed using accelerated cine sequences and flow-encoding CMR. A t-test was used to compare values between groups. A Mann Whitney test was used to compare values within groups.In RTOF both ventricles showed an impaired contractile reserve (RVEF rest 36.2±8.3%, +1.3±3.9% increase after exercise; LVEF rest 53.8±6.1%, +5.7±6.4% increase after exercise) compared to volunteers (RVEF rest 50.5±5.0%, +10.4±7.1% increase after exercise, p = 0.039; LVEF rest 61.9±3.1%, +12.2±4.7% increase after exercise, p = 0.014). RTOF showed a reduced distensibility of the ascending aorta during exercise compared to volunteers (RTOF: 3.4±1.9 10-3.mmHg-1 vs volunteers: 5.1±1.4 10-3.mmHg-1; p = 0.027). Ascending aorta distensibility was correlated to cardiac work in the volunteers but not in RTOF.RTOF showed an impaired contractile reserve for both ventricles. The exercise unmasked a reduced distensibility of the ascending aorta in RTOF, which may be an early sign of increased aortic rigidity."
https://openalex.org/W2908326256,"During vertebrate cardiac development NOTCH signaling activity in the endocardium is essential for the crosstalk between endocardium and myocardium that initiates ventricular trabeculation and valve primordium formation. This crosstalk leads later to the maturation and compaction of the ventricular chambers and the morphogenesis of the cardiac valves, and its alteration may lead to disease. Although endocardial NOTCH signaling has been shown to be crucial for heart development, its physiological role in the myocardium has not been clearly established. Here we have used mouse genetics to evaluate the role of NOTCH in myocardial development. We have inactivated the unique and ubiquitous NOTCH effector RBPJ in early cardiomyocytes progenitors, and examined its consequences in cardiac development and function. Our results show that mice with Tnnt2-Cre-mediated myocardial-specific deletion of Rbpj develop to term, with homozygous mutant animals showing normal expression of cardiac development markers, and normal adult heart function. Similar observations have been obtained after Notch1 deletion with Tnnt2-Cre. We have also deleted Rbpj in both myocardial and endocardial progenitor cells, using the Nkx2.5-Cre driver, resulting in ventricular septal defect (VSD), double outlet right ventricle (DORV), and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV), due to NOTCH signaling abrogation in the endocardium of cardiac valves. Our data demonstrate that NOTCH-RBPJ inactivation in the myocardium does not affect heart development or adult cardiac function."
https://openalex.org/W2953153609,"Because human epidermal growth factor-like receptor (HER) 2 is expressed on the surface of human pancreatic carcinoma cells to varying degrees, trastuzumab, an anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody (mAb), is expected to exert antibody-dependent, natural killer (NK) cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) against the cells. However, some reports found that the effect of trastuzumab against human pancreatic carcinoma cells was limited because most express only limited HER2. We examined whether anti-CD137 stimulating mAb could enhance trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1, a human pancreatic cancer cell line with low HER2 expression, in vitro. Supplementation of anti-CD137 mAb could improve trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against Panc-1 which was insufficient without this stimulating antibody. The ADCC differed in individual cells, and this was related to the expression of CD137 on the surface of NK cells after trastuzumab stimulation in association with the Fcγ-RIIIA polymorphism. NK cells with Fcγ-RIIIA-VV/VF showed high levels of ADCC against Panc-1, but those with Fcγ-RIIIA-FF did not show optimal ADCC. In addition, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC against the human pancreatic cancer cell line Capan-1 with high HER2 expression was generally high and not affected by the Fcγ-RIIIA polymorphism. These results demonstrated that in Fcγ-RIIIA-VV/VF-carrying healthy individuals, trastuzumab plus αCD137 mAb could induce effective ADCC against HER2-low-expressing pancreatic cancer cell lines, and that such an approach may result in similar findings in patients with pancreatic cancer."

Here we use official New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services records of all children reported missing in the period 2007–2010 containing exact dates of disappearance and recovery. In event-history analysis of these data we find that missing boys and girls have comparable daily recovery chances. Black children, however, on average remain missing longer and are more likely to still be missing by the end of our observation period than non-black children."
https://openalex.org/W2906982327,"Objectives We investigated the association between occupational noise exposure and the risk of elevated blood pressure and hypertension by stage in young adults. Methods We utilized 124,286 young adults (18–40 years) from the Project ELEFANT study. We categorized occupational noise exposure as high (75 dBA noise exposure for more than 4 hours per day) or low, and measured blood pressure (mmHg) and categorized participants by hypertension stage (normal, elevated, Stage 1, Stage 2). We applied adjusted logistic regression models to identify associations with hypertension risk, and we further examined the noise-BMI, noise-gender, and noise-residence interactions on hypertension risk in separate models. Results High occupational noise exposure was associated with increases in blood pressure among participants with elevated blood pressure (Estimate = 0.23, 95% CI: 1.09, 1.46, p = 0.0009), in Stage 1 hypertension (Estimate = 0.15, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.25, p = 0.0008), and in Stage 2 hypertension (Estimate = 0.41 95% CI: 1.31, 1.73, p<0.0001). Likewise, noise exposure-BMI interaction was consistently positively associated with increases in blood pressure in participants with elevated blood pressure (Estimate = 0.71, 95% CI: 1.55, 2.69, p<0.0001), in Stage 1 hypertension (Estimate = 0.78, 95% CI: 1.82, 2.61, p<0.0001), and in Stage 2 hypertension (Estimate = 2.06, 95% CI: 5.64, 10.81, p<0.0001). The noise exposure-male interaction showed higher risk for hypertension compared to the noise exposure-female interaction in participants with elevated blood pressure (Estimate = 1.24, 95% CI: 2.56, 4.71, p<0.0001), Stage 1 (Estimate = 1.67, 95% CI: 4.34, 6.42, p<0.0001) and Stage 2 hypertension (Estimate = 1.70, 95% CI: 3.86, 7.77, p<0.0001). Finally, we found that noise exposure-urban interaction was consistently associated with an increase in blood pressure in elevated blood pressure (Estimate = 0.32, 95% CI: 1.19, 1.62, p<0.0001) and in Stage 2 hypertension (Estimate = 0.44, 95% CI: 1.31, 1.80, p<0.0001)."
https://openalex.org/W2907349269,"This study investigates the effects of improved market accessibility on agricultural land use and basic wellbeing, defined by income and rice sufficiency, in Xayaburi province, Lao PDR through a meso-scale and actor-oriented approach with data collection at both district and household level. It also investigates farmers’ decision-making as it relates to regional markets. Increasing market accessibility in rural areas facilitates cash crop trade leading to agrarian change from subsistence to commercial agricultural systems. This transformation raises concerns about food security and vulnerability to market uncertainties as farmers are likely to grow cash crops intensively and in place of food crops, leading to lower food production. Meanwhile incomes from cash crop trade are highly vulnerable to market uncertainties. We found that farmers in the south of Xayaburi, where market accessibility is higher than in the north, primarily grow cash crops and do not suffer from rice insufficiency while farmers in the north, where market accessibility is lower, rely more on subsistence agriculture and have a lower level of basic wellbeing. The major factors of better basic wellbeing in the south include: (1) better market accessibility which can mitigate the risks of market uncertainty and create enough income to compensate for and overcome losses in rice production, (2) availability of more arable land due to a larger amount of level terrain which allows farmers to expand cash crop cultivation and continue growing rice at the same time, and (3) farmer strategy to keep a part of their land for growing rice to meet their minimum consumption needs and prevent the risks of rice insufficiency."

Along the Ligurian shallow rocky coasts (NW Italy), a macroalgae based index (CARtography of LITtoral and upper-sublittoral benthic communities, CARLIT), calibrated according to national characteristics and management needs, has been applied by the Regional Environmental Agency over the last ten years. In 2015, at least a “good” ES was achieved in all Ligurian water bodies except one, located in the Eastern Ligurian coastline, characterized by the lack of the most sensitive species, Cystoseira amentacea var. stricta. A general ES improvement has been observed along the Ligurian coastline, also in comparison with other quality indices (macroinvertebrates and fecal bacteria), and in particular in the Genoa water body, as proved by a relevant increase of C. amentacea abundance, probably as a consequence of enhancement in wastewater treatments. In the present study, the reliability of the observed improvement of the ES over a decade has been assessed, teasing apart intra-seasonal and operator-related variability. These results support the reliability of monitoring procedures carried out though the CARLIT Index and highlight the need and the effectiveness of reduction measures for anthropogenic impacts in order to achieve the ES required by European directives."
https://openalex.org/W2950734971,"The bloodstream form of the parasite Trypanosoma brucei obtains iron from its mammalian host by receptor-mediated endocytosis of host transferrin through its own unique transferrin receptor (TbTfR). Expression of TbTfR rapidly increases upon iron starvation by post-transcriptional regulation through a currently undefined mechanism that is distinct from the mammalian iron response system. We have created reporter cell lines by fusing the TbTfR 3’UTR or a control Aldolase 3’UTR to reporter genes encoding GFP or firefly Luciferase, and inserted the fusions into a bloodstream form cell line at a tagged ribosomal RNA locus. Fusion of the TbTfR 3’UTR is sufficient to significantly repress the expression of the reporter proteins under normal growth conditions. Under iron starvation conditions we observed upregulation of the mRNA and protein level of the TbTfR 3’UTR fusions only, with a magnitude and timing consistent with that reported for upregulation of the TbTfR. We conclude that the dynamic regulation of the T. brucei transferrin receptor in response to iron starvation is mediated via its 3’UTR, and that the effect is independent of genomic location."
https://openalex.org/W2907029344,"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are an important cause of diarrhea globally, particularly among children under the age of five in developing countries. ETEC O6 is the most common ETEC serogroup, yet the genome wide population structure of isolates of this serogroup is yet to be determined. In this study, we have characterized 40 ETEC O6 isolates collected between 1975-2016 by whole genome sequencing (WGS) and by phenotypic antimicrobial susceptibility testing. To determine the relatedness of isolates, we evaluated two methods-whole genome high-quality single nucleotide polymorphism (whole genome-hqSNP) and core genome SNP analyses using Lyve-SET and Parsnp respectively. All isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using a panel of 14 antibiotics. ResFinder 2.1 and a custom quinolone resistance determinants workflow were used for resistance determinant detection. VirulenceFinder 1.5 was used for prediction of the virulence genes. Thirty-seven isolates clustered into three major clades (I, II, III) by whole genome-hqSNP and core genome SNP analyses, while three isolates included in the whole genome-hqSNP analysis only did not cluster with clades I-III by both analyses and formed a distantly related outgroup, designated clade IV. Median number of pairwise whole genome-hqSNPs in clonal ETEC O6 outbreaks ranged from 0 to 5. Of the 40 isolates tested for antimicrobial susceptibility, 18 isolates were pansusceptible. Twenty-two isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic, nine of which were multidrug resistant. Phenotypic antimicrobial resistance (AR) correlated with AR determinants in 22 isolates. Thirty-two isolates harbored both enterotoxin virulence genes while the remaining 8 isolates had only one of the two virulence genes. In summary, whole genome-hqSNP and core genome SNP analyses from this study revealed similar evolutionary relationships and an overall diversity of ETEC O6 isolates independent of time of isolation. Less than 5 pairwise hqSNPs between ETEC O6 isolates is circumstantially indicative of an outbreak cluster. Findings from this study will be a basis for quicker outbreak detection and control by efficient subtyping by WGS."

To promote a comprehensive insight into the molecular basis of EHEC O157:H7 physiology and pathogenesis, the combined proteome of EHEC O157:H7 strains, Clade 8 and Clade 6 isolated from cattle in Argentina, and the standard EDL933 (clade 3) strain has been analyzed. From shotgun proteomic analysis a total of 2,644 non-redundant proteins of EHEC O157:H7 were identified, which correspond approximately 47% of the predicted proteome of this pathogen. Normalized spectrum abundance factor analysis was performed to estimate the protein abundance. According this analysis, 50 proteins were detected as the most abundant of EHEC O157:H7 proteome. COG analysis showed that the majority of the most abundant proteins are associated with translation processes. A KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that Glycolysis / Gluconeogenesis was the most significant pathway. On the other hand, the less abundant detected proteins are those related to DNA processes, cell respiration and prophage. Among the proteins that composed the Type III Secretion System, the most abundant protein was EspA. Altogether, the results show a subset of important proteins that contribute to physiology and pathogenicity of EHEC O157:H7."
https://openalex.org/W2907576079,"Introduction Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a rapidly increasing cause of mortality whose dismal prognosis is mainly due to overwhelming chemoresistance. New therapeutic approaches include physical agents such as ultrasonic cavitation, but clinical applications require further insights in the mechanisms of cytotoxicity. 3-D in vitro culture models such as spheroids exploit realistic spatial, biochemical and cellular heterogeneity that may bridge some of the experimental gap between conventional in vitro and in vivo experiments. Purpose To assess the feasibility and efficiency of inertial cavitation associated or not with chemotherapy, in a spheroid model of PDAC. Methods We used DT66066 cells, derived from a genetically-engineered murine PDAC, isolated from KPC-transgenic mice (LSL-KrasG12D/+; LSL-Trp53R172H/+; Pdx-1- Cre). Spheroids were obtained by either a standard centrifugation-based method, or by using a magnetic nano-shuttle method allowing the formation of spheroids within 24 hours and facilitating their handling. The spheroids were exposed to ultrasonic inertial cavitation in a specially designed setup. Eight or nine spheroids were analyzed for each of 4 conditions: control, gemcitabine alone, US cavitation alone, US cavitation + gemcitabine. Five US inertial cavitation indexes, corresponding to increased US intensities, were evaluated. The effectiveness of treatment was assessed after 24 hours with the following criteria: spheroid size (growth), ratio of phase S-entered cells (proliferation), proportion of cells in apoptosis or necrosis (mortality). These parameters were assessed by quantitative immunofluorescence techniques. Results The 3D culture model presented excellent reproducibility. Cavitation induced a significant decrease in the size of spheroids, an effect significantly correlated to an increasing cavitation index (p < 0.0001). The treatment induced cell death whose predominant mechanism was necrosis (p < 0.0001). There was a tendency to a synergistic effect of US cavitation and gemcitabine at 5μM concentration, however significant in only one of the cavitation indexes used (p = 0. 013). Conclusion Ultrasonic inertial cavitation induced a significant reduction of tumor growth in a spheroid model of PDAC., with necrosis rather than apoptosis as a Cell dominant mechanism of cell death. More investigations are needed to understand the potential role of inertial cavitation in overcoming chemoresistance."
https://openalex.org/W2908379110,"Children who use advanced arithmetic strategies, such as count-on and decomposition, are more accurate when solving arithmetic problems and are more likely to later have higher levels of math achievement. The present study tested the hypothesis that instruction using linear-spatial representations would activate children’s knowledge necessary for use of mental addition strategies and, thus, lead to greater accuracy on addition problems, than instruction using irregular representations of magnitude. As predicted, low-income kindergartners (n = 29) randomly assigned to practice sums up to 10 using materials that instantiated the linear-spatial features of a mental number line (i.e., discrete squares arranged in rows) demonstrated substantially more improvement in solving unpracticed addition problems than children who practiced with irregular materials (i.e., pictures of stars arranged in random arrays). This was particularly true for children with better initial numerical knowledge, which provided support for the idea that existing knowledge was activated. The use of count-on more than doubled from pretest to posttest among children in the linear-spatial condition and this mediated the difference in improvement between conditions. The importance of aligning instructional materials to relevant mental representations–consistent with the Cognitive Alignment Framework for instructional design—is discussed."

Blood samples were obtained at day 0 from all enrollees and on days 14, 28 and 42 from a random sample of 237 participants. Tetanus toxoid (TT) IgG antibody levels were assayed using EUROIMMUN. Analyses included prevalence of TT antibodies at enrollment and used a mixed effects model to determine the immunological response.Mean age was 21.4 years, 65.2% had knowledge of tetanus, 56.6% knew how tetanus was contracted, 22.8% reported ever receipt of TTCV, and 16.8% had current/recently healed wounds. Insufficient tetanus immunity was 57.1% at enrollment, 7.2% at day 14, 3.8% at day 28, and 0% at day 42. Antibody concentration was 0.44IU/ml (CI 0.35-0.53) on day 0, 3.86IU/ml (CI 3.60-4.11) on day 14, 4.05IU/ml (CI 3.81-4.29) on day 28, and 4.48IU/ml (CI 4.28-4.68) on day 42. TT antibodies increased by 0.24IU/ml (CI 0.23, 0.26) between days 0 and 14 and by 0.023IU/ml (CI 0.015, 0.031) between days 14 and 42 days. Immunological response was poorer in HIV-infected clients and men aged 35+ years.Insufficient immunity was common prior to TTCV, and a protective immunological response was achieved by day 14.

Structural elucidation revealed actinoplanic acid A and its demethyl analogue. Full-Text PDF Open Access Combination therapy is a promising solution for treating immunocompromised patients, resistant infections, and cancer. Particularly interesting are compounds that act synergistically—having efficacy greater than the sum of their individual contributions. Synergism can occur directly, by binding to the same target, or indirectly, by causing cascading effects in a targeted pathway. The utility of synergism is evident in several well-documented streptogramin antibiotics, such as Synercid. Considering the potency of such combinations, it is perhaps unsurprising that similar examples of synergistic compounds are found in nature.

The authors noticed two previously undetected compounds; isolation and structural elucidation indicated they were medically relevant APLs. Subsequently, genome re-sequencing and analysis led to the identification of a polyketide synthase (PKS) gene cluster with a domain architecture complementary to this structure. Experimental validation was carried out with in-frame deletions of several genes in the BGC, which revealed a single nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) module to be responsible for the incorporation of a rare tricarballylate moiety; comparison to the only other synthetic route to this moiety suggests an interesting case of convergent evolution. Further interrogation uncovered promiscuous domains and post-processing steps that resulted in a proposed complete biosynthetic pathway—the first for APLs. The APL gene cluster was also found consistently co-localized with the rapamycin BGC in the genomes of Streptomyces iranensis and Actinoplanes sp. MA7066, the only other genome-sequenced species that are known to make rapamycin. This suggested to the authors a possible synergistic relationship between the compounds. To test for possible effects, an antifungal assay was chosen based on the known activities of rapamycin and actinoplanic acids against the eukaryotic TOR complex and Ras farnesyltransferase, respectively. The results showed strong synergism against three fungal genera using concentrations within the production capacity of S. rapamycinicus. Clear results from Rhizopus oryzae showed growth inhibition at 1 nm rapamycin with 2 μm APL, in contrast to only slight inhibition at 25 nm and no activity alone, respectively. Given that the TOR complex is integral to basic cellular processes and farnesylated GTPases of the Ras family are often a part of the upstream signaling pathways, it was concluded that total arrest in growth is most likely achieved by APL-enhanced rapamycin activity. The authors noted that this example of co-associated products with synergistic potency highlights a new avenue that has yet to be exploited in genome-mining efforts. Computational analysis of microbial genomes has led to the identification of thousands of BGCs of unknown function, which beg for meaningful ways of prioritization to exploit them for drug discovery. Indeed, prioritizing predicted BGCs for the identification of synergistic product pairs is likely to yield useful antibiotics, as the synergy also poses a hurdle for resistance development. Although existing tools for identifying BGCs and grouping them into families across species (8Navarro-Munoz, J. C., Selem-Mójica, N., Mullowney, M. W., Kautsar, S. A., Tryon, J. H., Parkinson, E. I., de Los Santos, E. L. C., Yeong, M., Cruz-Morales, P., Abubucker, S., Roeters, A., Lokhorst, W., Fernandez-Guerra, A., Dias Cappelini, L. T., Thomson, R., et al. A computational framework for systematic exploration of biosynthetic diversity from large-scale genomic data. bioRxiv 10.1101/445270.Google Scholar) could be exploited to systematically identify BGC co-associations, it will be important to discriminate possible synergies from co-association “by chance,” e.g. due to recent common ancestry of closely related strains. Based on observations in known superclusters such as the rapamycin-APL case, we propose three criteria that could be leveraged. First, co-conservation across larger evolutionary time scales would distinguish real associations from associations due to recent common ancestry; this could be assessed through a statistical framework that takes into account the species phylogeny, and which offsets the degree of neutral sequence divergence and gene rearrangements against the level of co-association of pairs of BGCs within the same genomes (with a “bonus” for being located adjacently). Second, co-regulation of pairs of BGCs could be either predicted (through computational identification of transcription factor–binding sites) or assessed experimentally using transcriptome analysis. Third, the fact that synergistic molecules tackle the same target or related targets could be leveraged by employing approaches such as the antibiotic-resistant target seeker (ARTS) (9Alanjary M. Kronmiller B. Adamek M. Blin K. Weber T. Huson D. Philmus B. Ziemert N. The Antibiotic Resistant Target Seeker (ARTS), an exploration engine for antibiotic cluster prioritization and novel drug target discovery.Nucleic Acids Res. 2017; 45 (28472505): W42-W4810.1093/nar/gkx360Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) pipeline to identify resistance genes co-associated with both BGCs. The latter would even make it possible to specifically pinpoint pairs that are likely to have novel mechanisms of action. Given the abundance of gene cluster families of unknown function that lie waiting in the riches of genomic data, this presents a promising new avenue for genome-based drug discovery."
https://openalex.org/W2908412629,"Magnesium (Mg2+) is an important cofactor of many enzymes crucial for life; therefore, maintaining a Mg2+ balance in the body is essential. In the kidney, the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) determines the final urinary Mg2+ excretion. The nephron is subjected to variable urinary flow, but little is known about the influence of flow on Mg2+ transport. Primary cilia, which are mechanosensory organelles that sense changes in flow, are expressed on tubular epithelial cells. This study aimed to elucidate whether urinary flow facilitates DCT Mg2+ transport. To this end, mouse DCT15 cells, with and without primary cilia, were exposed to physiologic fluid flow generating 0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 dyn/cm2 fluid shear stress (FSS). FSS stimulated Mg2+ uptake significantly. Net Mg2+ uptake (i.e., the difference between static and FSS) followed a single component saturable first-order transport function and was independent of FSS magnitude and primary cilia. FSS did not affect the expression of magnesiotropic genes, including Cnnm2, Kcna1, Proegf, Trpm6, and Trpm7. Transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily melastatin (TRPM) member 7 (Trmp7) inhibition by 2-aminoethyl diphenyl borinate or knockout of TRPM6 did not alter net Mg2+ uptake, suggesting that TRPM6/TRPM7 homo/heterodimeric channels are not involved in FSS-activated Mg2+ transport. In summary, FSS generated by physiologic fluid flow is a new factor activating Mg2+ transport in DCT independent of primary cilia.—Verschuren, E. H. J., Hoenderop, J. G. J., Peters, D. J.

https://openalex.org/W2906751802,"Background In view of the irreversible pathology of progressive exacerbation, the societal burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing along with the rise in total health expenditure. Meanwhile, disparities remain among urban and rural citizens with different types of health insurance. This study aimed to assess the socioeconomic disparities between hospitalized CKD patients in urban and rural areas. Method A total of 501 CKD inpatients with urban or rural medical insurance (UMI or RMI, respectively) were selected from the top six tertiary hospitals in Wuhan. Demographic and socioeconomic data were collected as influencing factors. Data evaluation was performed using univariate and multivariate analyses. Result Socioeconomic characteristics showed differences among hospitalized CKD patients with different health insurances. Patients with RMI were younger, and reported lower education levels, poor domestic economic conditions, shorter duration, and less frequent hospital stays than those with UMI (P<0.05). The predictors revealed varying associations between UMI and RMI. Among the hospitalized CKD patients with UMI, male and low-education individuals presented high hospitalization expenses (βgender = -0.406, βeducation level = 0.357, P<0.05). By contrast, no significant difference in this aspect was found among RMI inpatients. Conclusions Care delivery and reimbursement models should be re-designed and implemented to improve equity among different CKD patients. The national health education should also be enhanced to prevent CKD and provide early treatment."

https://openalex.org/W2906691191,"Decreases in pH (acidosis) in vitro can alter skeletal muscle mitochondrial function [respiration and reactive oxygen species (ROS) emission]. However, because skeletal muscles readily adapt to exercise, the effects of acidosis may be different on sedentary vs. trained muscle. The aim of this work was to compare the effects of pH on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function between sedentary vs. exercise-trained male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 10 in each cohort). Rates of mitochondrial respiration and ROS emission were determined from the soleus muscle of both cohorts over a physiologic range of pH values (pH 6.2–7.1). Exercise-trained rats had 14% higher mean muscle buffering capacities; 46 and 40% greater enzyme activity of citrate synthase and lactate dehydrogenase, respectively; and greater activity of respiratory complexes I–IV. ADP-stimulated respiration with complex I and II substrates was ∼25% greater in exercise-trained rats but was unaffected by pH in either cohort. In both cohorts, lowering pH decreased respiration only in complex I— and complex II—supported nonphosphorylating (leak) state. However, as pH decreased, ROS emissions in complex I— and complex II—supported leak state decreased only in sedentary rats; in exercise-trained rats, ROS emissions in this state remained constant. We hypothesize that this effect may result from modulation at complex III, which declined 47% per unit pH in sedentary rats, in comparison to 23% in exercise-trained rats. Taken together, these data suggest that pH regulates mitochondrial respiratory complexes and that exercise training can decrease the effects of pH on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.—Hedges, C.

Participants were invited to draw their images during the interviews. Follow-up interviews occurred after treatment completion. Analysis drew upon the principles of Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).Many participants had mental images of their cancer which appeared to both embody and influence their beliefs about their illness, and affect their emotional response. For those who held them, mental images appeared to constitute an important part of their cognitive representation (understanding) of their illness. For some, their images also had a powerful emotional impact, being either reassuring or frightening. Images often appeared to originate from early clinical encounters, and remained fairly stable throughout treatment. Images could be conceptualised as 'concrete' (the perceived reality) and/or 'similic' (figurative). Patients' images reflected the perceived meaning, properties or 'intent' of the cancer-that is beliefs concerning the disease's identity, consequences and prognosis (likelihood of cure or control).People with head and neck cancer may develop a mental image of their disease, often generated early within clinical encounters, which can both reflect and influence their understanding of the cancer. Such images tend to be stable over time. We theorise that careful use of images in early consultations could avoid or minimise some distress, including fears of outcome or recurrence. Concrete or similic images and language could be employed later to change perceptions and reduce distress."

This study establishes a novel pyramidotomy technique in Sprague Dawley rats that generates persistent motor deficits and has a reduced mortality rate. We used viral neural tracing to identify the course and relative distribution of forelimb and hindlimb motor fibers (n = 9). On basis of the neural tracing data, the medullary pyramid was targeted dorsally from the cerebellar cortex for photothrombotic infarct lesioning (n = 18). The photothrombotic technique selectively destroyed the corticospinal fibers in the medullary pyramid with relative preservation of neighboring grey-matter tissue. MicroPET imaging using 2-deoxy-2-[18F]-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG-microPET) showed a decrease in regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) in the bilateral pyramid and ipsilateral sensory cortex (p < 0.001, FDR q < 0.05). In addition, the trapezoid bodies and superior olivary nuclei showed a decrease in rCGM, compatible with damage caused during the introduction of the optical fiber. Connected structures such as the inferior colliculi and auditory cortices also showed decreases in rCGM in both hemispheres (p < 0.001, FDR q < 0.05). There was a significant and persistent decrease in motor and sensory function in the contralateral limb following pyramidotomy, as demonstrated by performance in the single pellet reaching task and the foot-fault test. There was no operative mortality or loss of respiratory function in this study. These results indicate that photothrombotic pyramidotomy with a dorsal transcortical approach is a safe and reliable technique for generating a pyramidotomy model with persistent motor deficits."

One important class of Mg2+ transporters is the family of cystathione β-synthase domain divalent metal cation transport mediators (CNNMs), 2The abbreviations used are: CNNMcystathione β-synthase domain divalent metal cation transport mediatorsCNBHDcyclic nucleotide–binding homology domainCNBDcyclic nucleotide–binding domainHCNhyperpolarization-activated/cyclic nucleotide-sensitive. including CNNM1–CNNM4. Topologically, CNNM transporters contain an N-terminal extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain, and a large cytosolic sequence composed of two discrete domains. However, structural data for the CNNM transporters are sorely lacking, and important questions remain unanswered. What is the overall molecular architecture of the CNNM transporters? What are the functional roles of the extracellular and cytoplasmic regulatory domains? What is the gating and ion permeation mechanism in this family of transporters? Obtaining answers to these questions is important, not only to better understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms of CNNM transporter function, but also to provide strategies for drug design and to gain better insight into disease mutations associated with these transporters. Indeed, mutations in CNNM genes are associated with a range of inherited diseases, including familial dominant hypomagnesemia or Jalili syndrome, characterized by recessive enamel abnormalities and cone-rod dystrophy (1Parry D.A.

In certain ion channels, such as the hERG (8Wang W. MacKinnon R.

Because of their structural resemblance to CNBDs, these domains are referred to as cyclic nucleotide–binding homology domains or CNBHDs. Because cyclic nucleotide binding is impaired in CNBHDs, these domains have evolved to fulfill different roles. For example, in EAG channels, the CNBHD forms a binding interface with calmodulin, which controls channel gating (9Whicher J.R. MacKinnon R. Structure of the voltage-gated K+ channel Eag1 reveals an alternative voltage sensing mechanism.Science. 2016; 353 (27516594): 664-66910.1126/science.aaf8070Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). However, it is important to confirm that the putative CNBHDs are indeed self-liganded, and, furthermore, deciphering what new role they might have adopted can be a complicated task. Because determining the structural details of integral membrane proteins remains a substantial challenge, Chen et al. (2Chen Y.S. Kozlov G. Fakih R. Funato Y. Miki H. Gehring K. The cyclic nucleotide–binding homology domain of the integral membrane protein CNNM mediates dimerization and is required for Mg2+ efflux activity. (2018).J. Biol.

Specifically, the authors obtained the first structures of the CNNM3 and CNNM2 CNBHDs, solved at relatively high resolution (1.9 and 2.6 Å, respectively) and revealing important structural detail. As expected, the CNBHD structures closely resemble those of previously solved CBND structures (Fig. 1). The structural conservation is especially strong for the β-roll region, which is the site of cyclic nucleotide binding in CNBDs. Differences exist in certain loop regions, which are longer in CNNM transporters. The main difference is in the C-terminal αC-helix, which contacts the bound cyclic nucleotide in CNBDs, but it is unstructured in the CNNM CNBHDs. Additionally, the CNBHD in CNNM transporters is self-liganded, similar to other CNBHDs, as a tyrosine residue (Tyr-628) blocks access to the nucleotide-binding site via steric hindrance. The authors use thermal shift assays and NMR spectroscopy to further confirm the absence of nucleotide binding to all four CNNM CNBHDs. If cyclic nucleotide binding is impaired, then what is the role of the CNBHD in CNNM transporters? A possible answer to this question comes from the observation that the CNBHDs form dimers in the crystal structures. The authors confirmed this dimerization was not just a crystallization artifact, as the CNBHD dimers were also detected using size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. Furthermore, the authors identified a region in the β-roll as the dimerization interface; mutation of residues at this interface disrupted assembly in vitro. Amino acid interactions involved at the subunit interface are mainly hydrophobic in nature and mostly conserved between different CNNM members, suggesting an important functional role. To further investigate, the authors employed a Mg2+ efflux assay. They observed that deletion of the CNBHD in CNNM4 transporters impaired Mg2+ efflux without affecting membrane localization. This result suggests that CNBHD deletion mutants are still targeted to the membrane but become nonfunctional. In contrast, one of the single point mutants that disrupt the dimer interface retained close to WT Mg2+ efflux activity, suggesting that dimerization is not essential for transport function. However, the authors note an interesting correlation, which is that the isoforms that form less stable dimers are intrinsically more active proteins, leading them to propose that dimerization could be an inhibitory mechanism for the CNNM proteins. Together, the results from this study bring us one step closer to understanding the structure and regulation of CNNM Mg2+ transporters. First, the high resolution CNBHD structures will be extremely valuable in aiding the structural elucidation of the intact transporter, particularly if that structure is obtained at medium to low resolution. Second, it will be important to confirm whether the CNBHDs in CNNM transporters also form dimers versus other oligomeric states in their physiological environments. The importance of this point is driven home by a prior cautionary tale: Structures reported in 2012 of the isolated CNBHD of EAG-like K+ channels (10Brelidze T.I. Carlson A.E. Sankaran B. Zagotta W.N.

MacKinnon R.

Finally, these new results open up a host of important questions. If the dimer assembly is an intermediate in the gating or transport cycle, how is it regulated and how does it control the overall protein? Can a comparison between CNBHDs such as those in the hERG and EAG channels provide any insights into new hypotheses regarding oligomer assembly and function? Can a more detailed comparison of the CNNM family members' dimerization interface provide insights to enable specificity for drug discovery efforts among these ubiquitous domains? What will the integral protein structure teach us about the true role of CBNHDs in transport function? With this, the race is on to explain how a self-liganding domain got tangled up in Mg2+ transport. I thank Jana Kusch and Genevieve Evans for critical comments."
