The trees, Red Elberta variety, were planted in 1946 on a sassafras loamy sand. This soil is marked by a low organic matter content and low exchange capacity. For the past several years the trees have grown rather poorly, and there has been considerable dieback. This past year a fertility program was initiated in an effort to improve vigor of the trees. A dormant spray of zinc sulfate at the rate of 10 lbs/100 gal water was applied in February. The trees had been fertilized in March 1951 with 1000 lbs/acre of a 5-10-10 containing 10 lbs borax, 20 lbs Teemangam, and 10 lbs copper sulfate per ton. Since early growth was still showing dieback, additional borax was applied in April as a spray at the rate of 1/2 lb/100 gal. of green color between the veins. Accordingly, a spray of 0.05% (by weight) of ferrous sulfate + 0.025% sulfuric acid was applied to leaves of a few trees. There was no beneficial response to this spray or to a miianganous sulfate spray of the same concentration. A relatively complete nutrient spray' containing N, P, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, B, S, and Mo was applied, but this too had no effect on the chlorosis. A spectrographic analysis of normal and chlorotic leaves of the same physiological age from the same tree revealed that normal foliage had 10 times as much strontium as chlorotic leaves. There was 0.002% strontium in the ash of normal foliage, but only 0.0002% in chlorotic foliage. Strontium chloride (0.05% by weight) was sprayed on both upper and lower surfaces of leaves and branches of portions of several trees on August 5, 1951. Unsprayed portions of these trees, as well as unsprayed trees, were left as checks. Within 3 days a definite response was noted on all sprayed leaves. They were markedly greener, with little or no areas without normal color. By August 18, all sprayed leaves were normal in appearance (Fig. 1, B); unsprayed leaves still exhibited typical chlorosis (Fig. 1, A)."

I had been content to serve in the ranks, and I have regarded this position as too honorable to be sought, or to be lightly regarded when spontaneously bestowed. During my term of office I will give you my most devoted service. In ancient times, civilization was born, grew for a few generations and fell into decay. In all instances it was local and covered only small areas. Its habitations were oases in the world-wide desert of ignorance and superstition, and after an ephemeral existence all were buried in the sand. Relatively small bodies of men occupying salubrious regions developed the elements of science and for a few centuries flourished. Their superior knowledge gave them dominion over their less fortunate"
