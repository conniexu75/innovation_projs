https://openalex.org/W2981137429,"Most genetic variants that contribute to disease1 are challenging to correct efficiently and without excess byproducts2–5. Here we describe prime editing, a versatile and precise genome editing method that directly writes new genetic information into a specified DNA site using a catalytically impaired Cas9 endonuclease fused to an engineered reverse transcriptase, programmed with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA) that both specifies the target site and encodes the desired edit. We performed more than 175 edits in human cells, including targeted insertions, deletions, and all 12 types of point mutation, without requiring double-strand breaks or donor DNA templates. We used prime editing in human cells to correct, efficiently and with few byproducts, the primary genetic causes of sickle cell disease (requiring a transversion in HBB) and Tay–Sachs disease (requiring a deletion in HEXA); to install a protective transversion in PRNP; and to insert various tags and epitopes precisely into target loci. Four human cell lines and primary post-mitotic mouse cortical neurons support prime editing with varying efficiencies. Prime editing shows higher or similar efficiency and fewer byproducts than homology-directed repair, has complementary strengths and weaknesses compared to base editing, and induces much lower off-target editing than Cas9 nuclease at known Cas9 off-target sites. Prime editing substantially expands the scope and capabilities of genome editing, and in principle could correct up to 89% of known genetic variants associated with human diseases. A new DNA-editing technique called prime editing offers improved versatility and efficiency with reduced byproducts compared with existing techniques, and shows potential for correcting disease-associated mutations."
https://openalex.org/W2980472864,"Ferroptosis is a form of regulated cell death that is caused by the iron-dependent peroxidation of lipids1,2. The glutathione-dependent lipid hydroperoxidase glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) prevents ferroptosis by converting lipid hydroperoxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols3,4. Ferroptosis has previously been implicated in the cell death that underlies several degenerative conditions2, and induction of ferroptosis by the inhibition of GPX4 has emerged as a therapeutic strategy to trigger cancer cell death5. However, sensitivity to GPX4 inhibitors varies greatly across cancer cell lines6, which suggests that additional factors govern resistance to ferroptosis. Here, using a synthetic lethal CRISPR–Cas9 screen, we identify ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) (previously known as apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondrial 2 (AIFM2)) as a potent ferroptosis-resistance factor. Our data indicate that myristoylation recruits FSP1 to the plasma membrane where it functions as an oxidoreductase that reduces coenzyme Q10 (CoQ) (also known as ubiquinone-10), which acts as a lipophilic radical-trapping antioxidant that halts the propagation of lipid peroxides. We further find that FSP1 expression positively correlates with ferroptosis resistance across hundreds of cancer cell lines, and that FSP1 mediates resistance to ferroptosis in lung cancer cells in culture and in mouse tumour xenografts. Thus, our data identify FSP1 as a key component of a non-mitochondrial CoQ antioxidant system that acts in parallel to the canonical glutathione-based GPX4 pathway. These findings define a ferroptosis suppression pathway and indicate that pharmacological inhibition of FSP1 may provide an effective strategy to sensitize cancer cells to ferroptosis-inducing chemotherapeutic agents. A synthetic lethal CRISPR–Cas9 screen identifies ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 as a key ferroptosis-resistance factor, the expression of which correlates with ferroptosis resistance in hundreds of cancer cell lines."
https://openalex.org/W2981179816,"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent form of necrotic cell death marked by oxidative damage to phospholipids1,2. To date, ferroptosis has been thought to be controlled only by the phospholipid hydroperoxide-reducing enzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4)3,4 and radical-trapping antioxidants5,6. However, elucidation of the factors that underlie the sensitivity of a given cell type to ferroptosis7 is crucial to understand the pathophysiological role of ferroptosis and how it may be exploited for the treatment of cancer. Although metabolic constraints8 and phospholipid composition9,10 contribute to ferroptosis sensitivity, no cell-autonomous mechanisms have been identified that account for the resistance of cells to ferroptosis. Here we used an expression cloning approach to identify genes in human cancer cells that are able to complement the loss of GPX4. We found that the flavoprotein apoptosis-inducing factor mitochondria-associated 2 (AIFM2) is a previously unrecognized anti-ferroptotic gene. AIFM2, which we renamed ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1) and which was initially described as a pro-apoptotic gene11, confers protection against ferroptosis elicited by GPX4 deletion. We further demonstrate that the suppression of ferroptosis by FSP1 is mediated by ubiquinone (also known as coenzyme Q10, CoQ10): the reduced form, ubiquinol, traps lipid peroxyl radicals that mediate lipid peroxidation, whereas FSP1 catalyses the regeneration of CoQ10 using NAD(P)H. Pharmacological targeting of FSP1 strongly synergizes with GPX4 inhibitors to trigger ferroptosis in a number of cancer entities. In conclusion, the FSP1–CoQ10–NAD(P)H pathway exists as a stand-alone parallel system, which co-operates with GPX4 and glutathione to suppress phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis. In the absence of GPX4, FSP1 regenerates ubiquinol from the oxidized form, ubiquinone, using NAD(P)H and suppresses phospholipid peroxidation and ferroptosis in cells."
https://openalex.org/W2904912048,"The strong-coupling regime of cavity-quantum-electrodynamics (cQED) represents light-matter interaction at the fully quantum level. Adding a single photon shifts the resonance frequencies, a profound nonlinearity. cQED is a test-bed of quantum optics and the basis of photon-photon and atom-atom entangling gates. At microwave frequencies, success in cQED has had a transformative effect. At optical frequencies, the gates are potentially much faster and the photons can propagate over long distances and be easily detected, ideal features for quantum networks. Following pioneering work on single atoms, solid-state implementations are important for developing practicable quantum technology. Here, we embed a semiconductor quantum dot in a microcavity. The microcavity has a $\mathcal{Q}$-factor close to $10^{6}$ and contains a charge-tunable quantum dot with close-to-transform-limited optical linewidth. The exciton-photon coupling rate $g$ exceeds both the photon decay rate $\kappa$ and exciton decay rate $\gamma$ by a large margin ($g/\gamma=14$, $g/\kappa=5.3$); the cooperativity is $C=2g^{2}/(\gamma \kappa)=150$, the $\beta$-factor 99.7%. We observe pronounced vacuum Rabi oscillations in the time-domain, photon blockade at a one-photon resonance, and highly bunched photon statistics at a two-photon resonance. We use the change in photon statistics as a sensitive spectral probe of transitions between the first and second rungs of the Jaynes-Cummings ladder. All experiments can be described quantitatively with the Jaynes-Cummings model despite the complexity of the solid-state environment. We propose this system as a platform to develop optical-cQED for quantum technology, for instance a photon-photon entangling gate."
https://openalex.org/W2982254388,"Gut microbial β-glucuronidase (GUS) enzymes have been suggested to be involved in the estrobolome, the collection of microbial reactions involving estrogens. Furthermore, bacterial GUS enzymes within the gastrointestinal tract have been postulated to be a contributing factor in hormone-driven cancers. However, to date, there has been no experimental evidence to support these hypotheses. Here we provide the first in vitro analysis of the ability of 35 human gut microbial GUS enzymes to reactivate two distinct estrogen glucuronides, estrone-3-glucuronide and estradiol-17-glucuronide, to estrone and estradiol, respectively. We show that certain members within the Loop 1, mini-Loop 1, and FMN-binding classes of gut microbial GUS enzymes can reactivate estrogens from their inactive glucuronides. We provide molecular details of key interactions that facilitate these catalytic processes and present the structures of two novel human gut microbial GUS enzymes related to the estrobolome. Further, we demonstrate that estrogen reactivation by Loop 1 bacterial GUS enzymes can be inhibited both in purified enzymes and in fecal preparations of mixed murine fecal microbiota. Finally, however, despite these in vitro and ex vivo data, we show that a Loop 1 GUS-specific inhibitor is not capable of reducing the development of tumors in the PyMT mouse model of breast cancer. These findings validate that gut microbial GUS enzymes participate in the estrobolome but also suggest that the estrobolome is a multidimensional set of processes on-going within the mammalian gastrointestinal tract that likely involves many enzymes, including several distinct types of GUS proteins."
https://openalex.org/W2980692434,"Live-cell imaging of RNA has remained a challenge because of the lack of naturally fluorescent RNAs. Recently developed RNA aptamers that can light-up small fluorogenic dyes could overcome this limitation, but they still suffer from poor brightness and photostability. Here, we propose the concept of a cell-permeable fluorogenic dimer of self-quenched sulforhodamine B dyes (Gemini-561) and the corresponding dimerized aptamer (o-Coral) that can drastically enhance performance of the current RNA imaging method. The improved brightness and photostability, together with high affinity of this complex, allowed direct fluorescence imaging in live mammalian cells of RNA polymerase III transcription products as well as messenger RNAs labeled with a single copy of the aptamer; that is, without tag multimerization. The developed fluorogenic module enables fast and sensitive detection of RNA inside live cells, while the proposed design concept opens the route to new generation of ultrabright RNA probes. A dimerization-induced self-quenching fluorescent dye, Gemini-561, and its aptamer o-Coral were developed for imaging mRNAs in living cells with improved brightness and photostablility."

https://openalex.org/W3101922591,"Topology is a powerful recent concept asserting that quantum states could be globally protected against local perturbations1,2. Dissipationless topologically protected states are therefore of major fundamental interest as well as of practical importance in metrology and quantum information technology. Although topological protection can be robust theoretically, in realistic devices it is often susceptible to various dissipative mechanisms, which are difficult to study directly because of their microscopic origins. Here we use scanning nanothermometry3 to visualize and investigate the microscopic mechanisms that undermine dissipationless transport in the quantum Hall state in graphene. Simultaneous nanoscale thermal and scanning gate microscopy shows that the dissipation is governed by crosstalk between counterpropagating pairs of downstream and upstream channels that appear at graphene boundaries as a result of edge reconstruction. Instead of local Joule heating, however, the dissipation mechanism comprises two distinct and spatially separated processes. The work-generating process that we image directly, which involves elastic tunnelling of charge carriers between the quantum channels, determines the transport properties but does not generate local heat. By contrast, the heat and entropy generation process-which we visualize independently-occurs nonlocally upon resonant inelastic scattering from single atomic defects at graphene edges, and does not affect transport. Our findings provide an insight into the mechanisms that conceal the true topological protection, and suggest routes towards engineering more robust quantum states for device applications."
https://openalex.org/W2980707241,"Cotranscriptional folding is an obligate step of RNA biogenesis that can guide RNA structure formation and function through transient intermediate folds. This process is particularly important for transcriptional riboswitches in which the formation of ligand-dependent structures during transcription regulates downstream gene expression. However, the intermediate structures that comprise cotranscriptional RNA folding pathways, and the mechanisms that enable transit between them, remain largely unknown. Here, we determine the series of cotranscriptional folds and rearrangements that mediate antitermination by the Clostridium beijerinckii pfl ZTP riboswitch in response to the purine biosynthetic intermediate ZMP. We uncover sequence and structural determinants that modulate an internal RNA strand displacement process and identify biases within natural ZTP riboswitch sequences that promote on-pathway folding. Our findings establish a mechanism for pfl riboswitch antitermination and suggest general strategies by which nascent RNA molecules navigate cotranscriptional folding pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2980574182,"Prostate cancer is the most common malignancy in men in developed countries. Overexpression of enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2), the major histone H3 lysine 27 methyltransferase, has been connected to prostate cancer malignancy. However, its downstream genes and pathways have not been well established. Here, we show tumor suppressor Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1β (HNF1B) as a direct downstream target of EZH2. EZH2 binds HNF1B locus and suppresses HNF1B expression in prostate cancer cell lines, which is further supported by the reverse correlation between EZH2 and HNF1B expression in clinical samples. Consistently, restored HNF1B expression significantly suppresses EZH2-mediated overgrowth and EMT processes, including migration and invasion of prostate cancer cell lines. Mechanistically, we find that HNF1B primarily binds the promoters of thousands of target genes, and differentially regulates the expression of 876 genes. We also identify RBBP7/RbAP46 as a HNF1B interacting protein which is required for HNF1B-mediated repression of SLUG expression and EMT process. Importantly, we find that higher HNF1B expression strongly predicts better prognosis of prostate cancer, alone or together with lower EZH2 expression. Taken together, we have established a previously underappreciated axis of EZH2-HNF1B-SLUG in prostate cancer, and also provide evidence supporting HNF1B as a potential prognosis marker for metastatic prostate cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2981097076,"Modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) enzymatic assembly lines are large and dynamic protein machines that generally effect a linear sequence of catalytic cycles. Here, we report the heterologous reconstitution and comprehensive characterization of two hybrid NRPS-PKS assembly lines that defy many standard rules of assembly line biosynthesis to generate a large combinatorial library of cyclic lipodepsipeptide protease inhibitors called thalassospiramides. We generate a series of precise domain-inactivating mutations in thalassospiramide assembly lines, and present evidence for an unprecedented biosynthetic model that invokes intermodule substrate activation and tailoring, module skipping and pass-back chain extension, whereby the ability to pass the growing chain back to a preceding module is flexible and substrate driven. Expanding bidirectional intermodule domain interactions could represent a viable mechanism for generating chemical diversity without increasing the size of biosynthetic assembly lines and challenges our understanding of the potential elasticity of multimodular megaenzymes."

Here, we further investigated the role of ADAR1 in ZIKV replication by utilizing CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing and RNAi-based gene knockdown techniques. Both ADAR1 knockout and knockdown significantly reduced ZIKV RNA synthesis, protein levels, and viral titers in several human cell lines. Trans-complementation with the full-length ADAR1 form p150 or the shorter form p110 lacking the Zα domain restored viral replication levels suppressed by the ADAR1 knockout. Moreover, we observed that the nuclear p110 form was redistributed to the cytoplasm in response to ZIKV infection. ADAR1 was not involved in viral entry but promoted viral protein translation by impairing ZIKV-induced activation of protein kinase regulated by dsRNA (PKR). Of note, the RNA-editing activity of ADAR1 was not required to promote ZIKV replication. We also found that the proviral role of ADAR1 was partially mediated through its ability to suppress IFN production and PKR activation. Our work identifies ADAR1 as a proviral factor involved in ZIKV replication, suggesting that ADAR1 could be a potential antiviral target.

https://openalex.org/W2981069403,"Abstract Chromosomal fragile sites are genomic loci sensitive to replication stress which accumulate high levels of DNA damage, and are frequently mutated in cancers. Fragile site damage is thought to arise from the aberrant repair of spontaneous replication stress, however successful fragile site repair cannot be calculated using existing techniques. Here, we report a new assay measuring recombination-mediated repair at endogenous genomic loci by combining a sister chromatid exchange (SCE) assay with fluorescent in situ hybridization (SCE-FISH). Using SCE-FISH, we find that endogenous and exogenous replication stress generated unrepaired breaks and SCEs at fragile sites. We also find that distinct sources of replication stress induce distinct patterns of breakage: ATR inhibition induces more breaks at early replicating fragile sites (ERFS), while ERFS and late-replicating common fragile sites (CFS) are equally fragile in response to aphidicolin. Furthermore, SCEs were suppressed at fragile sites near centromeres in response to replication stress, suggesting that genomic location influences DNA repair pathway choice. SCE-FISH also measured successful recombination in human primary lymphocytes, and identificed the proto-oncogene BCL2 as a replication stress-induced fragile site. These findings demonstrate that SCE-FISH frequency at fragile sites is a sensitive indicator of replication stress, and that large-scale genome organization influences DNA repair pathway choice."

This in turn will aid the development of healthcare policies and planning for prevention, early diagnosis and management of health conditions. Objective To evaluate patients’ perception of community healthcare seeking behaviour towards both acute and preventive physical and psychosocial health concerns by sex, age and type of primary care setting (as a proxy for affordability of healthcare). Methods A total of 3979 patients from 221 public and 239 private clinics in Malaysia were interviewed between June 2015 and February 2016 using a patient experience survey questionnaire from the Quality and Cost of Primary Care cross-sectional study. Multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for the complex survey design was used. Results After adjusting for covariates, more women than men perceived that most people would see their general practitioners for commonly consulted acute and preventive physical and some psychosocial health concerns such as stomach pain (adjusted odds ratio (AOR), 1.64; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.22–2.21), sprained ankle (AOR, 1.29; 95% CI, 1.06–1.56), anxiety (AOR, 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12–1.55), domestic violence (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.13–1.62) and relationship problems (AOR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02–1.51). There were no significant differences in perceived healthcare seeking behaviour by age groups except for the removal of a wart (AOR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.12–1.76). Patients who visited the public clinics had generally higher perception of community healthcare seeking behaviour for both acute and preventive physical and psychosocial health concerns compared to those who went to private clinics. Conclusions Our findings showed that sex and healthcare affordability differences were present in perceived community healthcare seeking behaviour towards primary care services. Also perceived healthcare seeking behaviour were consistently lower for psychosocial health concerns compared to physical health concerns."

https://openalex.org/W2980696478,"A significant proportion of breast cancer patients develop bone metastases, but the mechanisms regulating tumor cell dissemination from the primary site to the skeleton remain largely unknown. Using a novel model of spontaneous bone metastasis derived from human ER+ MCF7 cells, molecular profiling revealed increased PREX1 expression in a cell line established from bone-disseminated MCF7 cells (MCF7b), which were more migratory, invasive, and adhesive in vitro compared with parental MCF7 cells, and this phenotype was mediated by PREX1. MCF7b cells grew poorly in the primary tumor site when reinoculated in vivo, suggesting that these cells are primed to grow in the bone, and were enriched in skeletal sites of metastasis over soft tissue sites. Skeletal dissemination from the primary tumor was reversed with PREX1 knockdown, indicating that PREX1 is a key driver of spontaneous dissemination of tumor cells from the primary site to the bone marrow. In breast cancer patients, PREX1 levels are significantly increased in ER+ tumors and associated with invasive disease and distant metastasis. Together, these findings implicate PREX1 in spontaneous bone dissemination and provide a significant advance to the molecular mechanisms by which breast cancer cells disseminate from the primary tumor site to bone."
https://openalex.org/W2981582302,"GNA13, the α subunit of a heterotrimeric G protein, mediates signaling through G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). GNA13 is up-regulated in many solid tumors, including prostate cancer, where it contributes to tumor initiation, drug resistance, and metastasis. To better understand how GNA13 contributes to tumorigenesis and tumor progression, we compared the entire transcriptome of PC3 prostate cancer cells with those cells in which GNA13 expression had been silenced. This analysis revealed that GNA13 levels affected multiple CXC-family chemokines. Further investigation in three different prostate cancer cell lines singled out pro-tumorigenic CXC motif chemokine ligand 5 (CXCL5) as a target of GNA13 signaling. Elevation of GNA13 levels consistently induced CXCL5 RNA and protein expression in all three cell lines. Analysis of the CXCL5 promoter revealed that the −505/+62 region was both highly active and influenced by GNA13, and a single NF-κB site within this region of the promoter was critical for GNA13-dependent promoter activity. ChIP experiments revealed that, upon induction of GNA13 expression, occupancy at the CXCL5 promoter was significantly enriched for the p65 component of NF-κB. GNA13 knockdown suppressed both p65 phosphorylation and the activity of a specific NF-κB reporter, and p65 silencing impaired the GNA13-enhanced expression of CXCL5. Finally, blockade of Rho GTPase activity eliminated the impact of GNA13 on NF-κB transcriptional activity and CXCL5 expression. Together, these findings suggest that GNA13 drives CXCL5 expression by transactivating NF-κB in a Rho-dependent manner in prostate cancer cells."
https://openalex.org/W2980876881,"The circadian clock and aging are intertwined. Disruption to the normal diurnal rhythm accelerates aging and corresponds with telomere shortening. Telomere attrition also correlates with increase cellular senescence and incidence of chronic disease. In this report, we examined diurnal association of White Collar 2 (WC-2) in Neurospora and BMAL1 in zebrafish and mice and found that these circadian transcription factors associate with telomere DNA in a rhythmic fashion. We also identified a circadian rhythm in Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA (TERRA), a lncRNA transcribed from the telomere. The diurnal rhythm in TERRA was lost in the liver of Bmal1-/- mice indicating it is a circadian regulated transcript. There was also a BMAL1-dependent rhythm in H3K9me3 at the telomere in zebrafish brain and mouse liver, and this rhythm was lost with increasing age. Taken together, these results provide evidence that BMAL1 plays a direct role in telomere homeostasis by regulating rhythms in TERRA and heterochromatin. Loss of these rhythms may contribute to telomere erosion during aging."
https://openalex.org/W2980900694,"Purpose Even with an optimal treatment protocol, the median survival of glioblastoma (GB) patients is only 12–15 months. Hence, there is need for novel effective therapies that improve survival outcomes. Recent evidence suggests an important role for connexin (Cx) proteins (especially Cx43) in the microenvironment of malignant glioma. Cx43-mediated gap junctional communication has been observed between tumor cells, between astrocytes and between tumor cells and astrocytes. Therefore, gap junction directed therapy using a pharmacological suppressor or modulator, such as tonabersat, could be a promising target in the treatment of GB. In this preclinical study, we evaluated the possible therapeutic potential of tonabersat in the F98 model. Procedures Female Fischer rats were inoculated with ± 25.000 F98 tumor cells in the right frontal lobe. Eight days post-inoculation contrast-enhanced T1-weighted (CE-T1w) magnetic resonance (MR) images were acquired to confirm tumor growth in the brain. After tumor confirmation, rats were randomized into a Control Group, a Connexin Modulation Group (CM), a Standard Medical Treatment Group (ST), and a Standard Medical Treatment with adjuvant Connexin Modulation Group (STCM). To evaluate therapy response, T2-weighted (T2w) and CE-T1w sequences were acquired at several time points. Tumor volume analysis was performed on CE-T1w images and statistical analysis was performed using a linear mixed model. Results Significant differences in estimated geometric mean tumor volumes were found between the ST Group and the Control Group and also between the STCM Group and the Control Group. In addition, significant differences in estimated geometric mean tumor volumes between the ST Group and the STCM Group were demonstrated. No significant differences in estimated geometric mean tumor volumes were found between the Control Group and the CM Group. Conclusion Our results demonstrate a therapeutic potential of tonabersat for the treatment of GB when used in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2981550286,"Finding food is a vital skill and a constant task for any animal, and associative learning of food-predicting cues gives an advantage in this daily struggle. The strength of the associations between cues and food depends on a number of parameters, such as the salience of the cue, the strength of the food reward and the number of joint cue-food experiences. We investigate what impact the strength of an associative odour-sugar memory has on the microbehaviour of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. We find that larvae form stronger memories with increasing concentrations of sugar or odour, and that these stronger memories manifest themselves in stronger modulations of two aspects of larval microbehaviour, the rate and the direction of lateral reorientation manoeuvres (so-called head casts). These two modulations of larval behaviour are found to be correlated to each other in every experiment performed, which is in line with a model that assumes that both modulations are controlled by a common motor output. Given that the Drosophila larva is a genetically tractable model organism that is well suited to the study of simple circuits at the single-cell level, these analyses can guide future research into the neuronal circuits underlying the translation of associative memories of different strength into behaviour, and may help to understand how these processes are organised in more complex systems."
https://openalex.org/W2981774614,"Background Integration of feminizing hormone therapy (FHT) and antiretroviral therapy (ART) is critical in providing gender-affirming HIV care for transgender (trans) women living with HIV. However, interpersonal communications with HIV providers who are not competent with FHT may complicate this integration. Methods We conducted semi-structured interviews with trans women (n = 9) who self-reported as HIV-positive and their HIV providers (n = 15) from community-based venues (e.g., clinics) in Manila, Philippines. Results We identified five key themes from our qualitative data: (1) provider’s concerns; (2) patient’s goals; (3) affirmative vs. non-affirmative provider rhetoric; (4) alignment vs. misalignment of provider rhetoric to patient goals; and (5) FHT and ART-related decisions. Based on these themes, we describe a gender-affirmative HIV care framework to understand FHT-ART decisions among trans women living with HIV. Based on our data, this framework shows that provider-patient communications regarding ART and FHT consists primarily of provider concerns and patient goals regarding FHT. These communications can take on a gender-affirmative or non-affirmative style of rhetoric that either aligns or misaligns with patient goals and may lead to differences in FHT and ART-related decisions among trans women living with HIV. Conclusion There exist mixed regimens and beliefs about taking FHT and ART among this sample of trans women. While trans participants’ main source of health information is their HIV provider, providers are likely to communicate non-affirmative rhetoric that negatively impacts trans women’s decision to take FHT and ART. Research is needed to elucidate co-prescriptions of gender-affirmative services with HIV care among this group in the Philippines."

https://openalex.org/W2980569498,"Background The human resources for health (HRH) crisis and dearth of research on the health labour market in South Africa informed the WiSDOM (Wits longitudinal Study to Determine the Operation of the labour Market among its health professional graduates) cohort study. The study aims to generate new knowledge on the career choices and job location decisions of health professionals in South Africa. Methods WiSDOM is a prospective longitudinal cohort study. During 2017, the first cohort for each of eight professional groups was established: clinical associates, dentists, doctors, nurses, occupational therapists, oral hygienists, pharmacists and physiotherapists. These cohorts will be followed up for 15 years. For the baseline data collection, each final year health professional student completed an electronic self-administered questionnaire (SAQ), after providing informed consent. The SAQ included information on: demographic characteristics; financing of training; reasons for choosing their profession; and their career intentions. We used STATA® 14 to analyse the data. Results We obtained an 89.5% response rate and 511 final year health professional students completed the baseline survey. The mean age of all participants was 24.1 years; 13.1% were born in a rural area; 11.9% and 8.0% completed their primary and secondary schooling in a rural area respectively. The health professional students came from relatively privileged backgrounds: 45.0% had attended a private school, the majority of their fathers (77.1%) had completed tertiary education, and 69.1% of their mothers had completed tertiary education. Students with higher socio-economic status (SES Quintiles 3–5) made up a larger proportion of the occupational therapists (77.8%), physiotherapists (71.7%), doctors (66.7%), and dentists (64.7%). In contrast, individuals from SES Quintiles 1 and 2 were over-represented among the clinical associates (75.0%), oral hygienists (71.4%), nurses (61.9%), and pharmacists (56.9%). Almost one quarter (24.9%) of cohort members indicated that they had partly financed their studies through loans. Although 86.3% of all cohort members indicated that they plan to stay in their chosen profession, this ranged from 43.2% for clinical associates to 100% for dentists. Conclusions WiSDOM has generated new knowledge on health professional graduates of a leading South African University. The results have implications for university selection criteria and national health workforce planning."
https://openalex.org/W2981511223,"2'-Deoxyadenosine 5'-monophosphate (dAMP), a deoxyribonucleotide found in DNA, affects intestinal cell growth. The molecular mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal absorption of foreign DNA ingested along with food has hardly been investigated. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism underlying intestinal absorption of dAMP. The uptake of [3H]dAMP by Caco-2 cells was Na+- and pH-dependent and was inhibited by various nucleosides. In contrast, nitrobenzylthioinosine (NMBPR), an equilibrative nucleoside transporter inhibitor, showed little inhibitory effects on [3H]dAMP uptake. Additionally, human concentrative nucleoside transporter (CNT) 3, transiently expressed in COS-7 cells, mediated the uptake of [3H]dAMP. A kinetic study revealed that the Km value of CNT3-mediated uptake of dAMP (59.6 μM) was close to that of 2'-deoxyadenosine (dAdo) (56.3 μM), whereas the dAMP Vmax (15.6 pmol·mg protein-1min-1) was 500-fold lesser than the dAdo Vmax (7782 pmol·mg protein-1min-1). Further, [3H]dAMP uptake was greater in COS-7 cells expressing ecto-5'-nucleotidase/CD73 with CNT3 than in those expressing CNT3 alone. These data suggest that, although dAMP is a substrate of CNT3, it is dephosphorylated to dAdo by CD73 and is efficiently absorbed as dAdo from the intestinal lumen."
https://openalex.org/W2981874494,"The Southern Ocean (SO) is a net sink for atmospheric CO2 whereby the photosynthetic activity of phytoplankton and sequestration of organic carbon (biological pump) plays an important role. Global climate change will tremendously influence the dynamics of environmental conditions for the phytoplankton community, and the phytoplankton will have to acclimate to a combination of changes of e.g. water temperature, salinity, pH, and nutrient supply. The efficiency of the biological pump is not only determined by the photosynthetic activity but also by the extent of respiratory carbon losses of phytoplankton cells. Thus, the present study investigated the effect of different temperature and salinity combinations on the ratio of gross photosynthesis to respiration (rGP/R) in two representative phytoplankton species of the SO. In the comparison of phytoplankton grown at 1 and 4°C the rGP/R decreased from 11.5 to 7.7 in Chaetoceros sp., from 9.1 to 3.2 in Phaeocystis antarctica strain 109, and from 12.4 to 7.0 in P. antarctica strain 764, respectively. The decrease of rGP/R was primarily dependent on temperature whereas salinity was only of minor importance. Moreover, the different rGP/R at 1 and 4°C were caused by changes of temperature-dependent respiration rates but were independent of changes of photosynthetic rates. For further interpretation, net primary production (NPP) was calculated for different seasonal conditions in the SO with specific combinations of irradiance, temperature, and salinity. Whereas, maximum photosynthetic rates significantly correlated with calculated NPP under experimental ‘Spring’, ‘Summer’, and ‘Autumn’ conditions, there was no correlation between rGP/R and the respective values of NPP. The study revealed species-specific differences in the acclimation to temperature and salinity changes that could be linked to their different original habitats."
https://openalex.org/W2982008527,"The pathophysiology of osteoarthritis (OA) involves dysregulation of anabolic and catabolic processes associated with a broad panel of proteins that ultimately lead to cartilage degradation. An increased understanding about these protein interactions with systematic in vitro analyses may give new ideas regarding candidates for treatment of OA related cartilage degradation. Therefore, an ex vivo tissue model of cartilage degradation was established by culturing tissue explants with bacterial collagenase II. Responses of healthy and degrading cartilage were analyzed through protein abundance in tissue supernatant with a 26-multiplex protein profiling assay, after exposing the samples to a panel of 55 protein stimulations present in synovial joints of OA patients. Multivariate data analysis including exhaustive pairwise variable subset selection identified the most outstanding changes in measured protein secretions. MMP9 response to stimulation was outstandingly low in degrading cartilage and there were several protein pairs like IFNG and MMP9 that can be used for successful discrimination between degrading and healthy samples. The discovered changes in protein responses seem promising for accurate detection of degrading cartilage. The ex vivo model seems interesting for drug discovery projects related to cartilage degradation, for example when trying to uncover the unknown interactions between secreted proteins in healthy and degrading tissues."
https://openalex.org/W2982219546,"The human gait program involves many brain areas such as motor cortices, cerebellum, basal ganglia, brainstem, and spinal cord. The mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), which contains the pedunculopontine (PPN) and cuneiform (CN) nuclei, is thought to be one of the key supraspinal gait generators. In daily life activities, gait primarily occurs in complex conditions, such as through narrow spaces, or while changing direction or performing motor or cognitive tasks. Here, we aim to explore the activity of these subcortical brain areas while walking through narrow spaces, using functional MRI in healthy volunteers and designing a virtual reality task mimicking walking down a hallway, without and with an open doorway to walk through. As a control, we used a virtual moving walkway in the same environment. Twenty healthy volunteers were scanned. Fifteen subjects were selected for second level analysis based on their ability to activate motor cortices. Using the contrast Gait versus Walkway, we found activated clusters in motor cortices, cerebellum, red nucleus, thalamus, and the left MLR including the CN and PPN. Using the contrast Gait with Doorway versus Walkway with Doorway, we found activated clusters in motor cortices, left putamen, left internal pallidum, left substantia nigra, right subthalamic area, and bilateral MLR involving the CN and PPN. Our results suggest that unobstructed gait involves a motor network including the PPN whereas gait through a narrow space requires the additional participation of basal ganglia and bilateral MLR, which may encode environmental cues to adapt locomotion."
https://openalex.org/W2981524268,"Formal psychosocial support programs after weight-loss surgery are limited in scope and availability.This randomized pilot study evaluated the feasibility of a postoperative behavioral intervention program.Postoperative weight-loss surgery patients (N = 50) were recruited from February 2017-July 2017 and randomized to a four-month behavioral program or usual care wait-list. Outcomes evaluated in addition to feasibility included health-related quality of life (Short Form -36), psychosocial functioning and adherence. Secondary outcomes included within-group changes for each outcome.Out of eight possible sessions, intervention participants attended a mean of 4.2 sessions. Intervention group participants experienced greater improvements in the social functioning domain of health-related quality of life compared to usual care. Self-reported dietary adherence in the intervention group remained stable, while usual care group dietary adherence declined. Within the intervention group, participants also reported gains in the physical function, pain and general health aspects of quality life from baseline to post-treatment. No differences in weight, mood or other eating behaviors (e.g., loss of control, emotional eating) were evident between groups.Though participation in a postoperative behavioral intervention varied, the program helped participants to maintain aspects of quality of life and self-reported adherence to dietary recommendations.ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03092479."
https://openalex.org/W2982252376,"The BXD family has become one of the preeminent genetic reference populations to understand the genetic and environmental control of phenotypic variation. Here we evaluate the responses to different levels of fat in the diet using both chow diet (CD, 13–18% fat) and a high-fat diet (HFD, 45–60% fat). We studied cohorts of BXD strains, both inbred parents C57BL/6J and DBA/2J (commonly known as B6 and D2, respectively), as well as B6D2 and D2B6 reciprocal F1 hybrids. The comparative impact of genetic and dietary factors was analyzed by profiling a range of phenotypes, most prominently their cecum bacterial composition. The parents of the BXDs and F1 hybrids express limited differences in terms of weight and body fat gain on CD. In contrast, the strain differences on HFD are substantial for percent body fat, with DBA/2J accumulating 12.5% more fat than C57BL/6J (P < 0.0001). The F1 hybrids born to DBA/2J dams (D2B6F1) have 10.6% more body fat (P < 0.001) than those born to C57BL/6J dams. Sequence analysis of the cecum microbiota reveals important differences in bacterial composition among BXD family members with a substantial shift in composition caused by HFD. Relative to CD, the HFD induces a decline in diversity at the phylum level with a substantial increase in Firmicutes (+13.8%) and a reduction in Actinobacteria (-7.9%). In the majority of BXD strains, the HFD also increases cecal sIgA (P < 0.0001)—an important component of the adaptive immunity response against microbial pathogens. Host genetics modulates variation in cecum bacterial composition at the genus level in CD, with significant quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for Oscillibacter mapped to Chr 3 (18.7–19.2 Mb, LRS = 21.4) and for Bifidobacterium mapped to Chr 6 (89.21–89.37 Mb, LRS = 19.4). Introduction of HFD served as an environmental suppressor of these QTLs due to a reduction in the contribution of both genera (P < 0.001). Relations among liver metabolites and cecum bacterial composition were predominant in CD cohort, but these correlations do not persist following the shift to HFD. Overall, these findings demonstrate the important impact of environmental/dietary manipulation on the relationships between host genetics, gastrointestinal bacterial composition, immunological parameters, and metabolites—knowledge that will help in the understanding of the causal sources of metabolic disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2982253525,"The present study aims at examining the prevalence of awareness and current use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) among middle and high school students from Zhejiang, China. Smoking-related factors associated with e-cigarettes use will also be explored.This cross-sectional study was based on 2017 Zhejiang Youth Risk Behavior Survey. A total of 24,157 adolescents were recruited and relevant data of e-cigarettes and smoking-related factors were collected via a self-reported questionnaire. Logistic regression models were used to examine the association between e-cigarettes current use and the smoking-related factors. Odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported.Overall, 70.61% of middle and high school students reported hearing of e-cigarettes, while only 2.15% reported using e-cigarettes in the past month. Among smoking-related factors, cigarette smoking (ever and current), use of other tobacco products, second hand smoke exposure and previous attempts to quit smoking were significantly associated with higher current e-cigarettes use in adolescents.These results presented high awareness of e-cigarettes while relatively low use in Chinese adolescents. Smoking-related factors were significantly associated with increased e-cigarettes use."
https://openalex.org/W2981228342,"One (1P), two (2P), three (3P) or four (4P) pulses of light supplied by a xenon lamp, were applied to young lettuce plants grown in pots. The lamp used in the trial was similar to those used for fruit surface sterilization. Total flavonols were measured in leaves using the Dualex method. In a first trial conducted in greenhouse conditions, 6 days after the pulsed light (PL) treatment, flavonols were increased by 312% and 525% in the 3P and 4P treatments, respectively, in comparison to the those in the untreated control. Changes in the chlorophyll fluorescence parameters suggest that the PL treatment may induce limited and transient damage to the photosynthetic machinery and that the damage increases with the increasing number of pulses. The performance parameters were not significantly affected by PL and recovered fully by 6 days after the treatments. The 1P and the 2P treatments 6 days after the treatment showed a 28.6% and a 32.5% increase, respectively, in net photosynthetic assimilation, when compared to that of the control. However, 8 days after the treatment, there was no longer a difference between the treatments and the control in net photosynthetic assimilation. Eight days after the light treatment, the 3P treatment showed a 38.4% increase in maximal net photosynthetic assimilation over that of the control, which is an indication of positive long-term adaptation of photosynthetic capacity. As a whole, our observations suggest that PL could be used on field or greenhouse crops to increase their phytochemical content. No long-lasting or strong negative effects on photosynthesis were associated with PL within the range of doses we tested; some observations even suggest that certain treatments could result in an additional positive effect. This conclusion is supported by a second trial conducted in phytotrons. More studies are required to better understand the roles of the different wavelengths supplied by PL and their interactions."
https://openalex.org/W2981547301,"Background Modifiable risk factors for age-related macular degeneration (AMD) include smoking, nutrition and likely physical activity (PA). Levels of PA, however, are impacted by any visual impairment which makes the assessment of any association with AMD difficult. Purpose To assess the impact of visual impairment under both high and low luminance conditions on levels of PA in early and late AMD. Methods Ninety participants with early to late AMD underwent a clinical assessment including conventional best-corrected visual acuity, low luminance visual acuity, contrast sensitivity and the Moorfields acuity test. PA was recorded using a wrist-worn accelerometer (GENEActiv, Activeinsights) on seven consecutive days. Patient characteristics were compared with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and determinants of moderate-to-vigorous-PA (MVPA) were assessed using linear regression models. Results Mean age was 73.9 ± 8.5 years (range 50–89) and 47 subjects (52.2%) were women. Average MVPA time was longer in the early (355.1 ± 252.0 minutes/week) compared to the late AMD group (162.2 ± 134.6 minutes/week; p<0.001). Using linear regression, age [β = -0.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): -12.9; -0.8, p = 0.028] and AMD stage (β = -0.28; 95% CI: -230.9, -25.0; p = 0.015) but not visual impairment on any of the employed tests were associated with MVPA (minutes/week). Conclusions We found late AMD to be associated with reduced PA. As performance on any of the visual tests was not associated with PA, this association cannot entirely be explained by functional impairment. More research is needed to further explore the association of PA and AMD as PA may be a potentially modifiable risk factor."
https://openalex.org/W2980924691,"The conventional reading of the skin prick test (SPT) for diagnosing allergies is prone to inter- and intra-observer variations. Drawing the contours of the skin wheals from the SPT and scanning them for computer processing is cumbersome. However, 3D scanning technology promises the best results in terms of accuracy, fast acquisition, and processing. In this work, we present a wide-field 3D imaging system for the 3D reconstruction of the SPT, and we propose an automated method for the measurement of the skin wheals. The automated measurement is based on pyramidal decomposition and parametric 3D surface fitting for estimating the sizes of the wheals directly. We proposed two parametric models for the diameter estimation. Model 1 is based on an inverted Elliptical Paraboloid function, and model 2 on a super-Gaussian function. The accuracy of the 3D imaging system was evaluated with validation objects obtaining transversal and depth accuracies within ± 0.1 mm and ± 0.01 mm, respectively. We tested the method on 80 SPTs conducted in volunteer subjects, which resulted in 61 detected wheals. We analyzed the accuracy of the models against manual reference measurements from a physician and obtained that the parametric model 2 on average yields diameters closer to the reference measurements (model 1: -0.398 mm vs. model 2: -0.339 mm) with narrower 95% limits of agreement (model 1: [-1.58, 0.78] mm vs. model 2: [-1.39, 0.71] mm) in a Bland-Altman analysis. In one subject, we tested the reproducibility of the method by registering the forearm under five different poses obtaining a maximum coefficient of variation of 5.24% in the estimated wheal diameters. The proposed method delivers accurate and reproducible measurements of the SPT."
https://openalex.org/W2981471023,"The goal of this study was to explore conceptual benefits of characterizing delineated target volumes based on surface area and to utilize the concept for assessing risk of therapeutic toxicity in radiosurgery.Four computer-generated targets, a sphere, a cylinder, an ellipsoid and a box, were designed for two distinct scenarios. In the first scenario, all targets had identical volumes, and in the second one, all targets had identical surface areas. High quality stereotactic radiosurgery plans with at least 95% target coverage and selectivity were created for each target in both scenarios. Normal brain volumes V12Gy, V14Gy and V16Gy corresponding to received dose of 12 Gy, 14 Gy and 16 Gy, respectively, were computed and analyzed. Additionally, V12Gy and V14Gy volumes and values for seven prospective toxicity variables were recorded for 100 meningioma patients after Gamma Knife radiosurgery. Multivariable stepwise linear regression and best subset linear regression analyses were performed in two statistical software packages, SAS/STAT and R, respectively.In a phantom study, for the constant volume targets, the volumes of 12 Gy, 14 Gy and 16 Gy isodose clouds were the lowest for the spherical target as an expected corollary of the isoperimetric inequality. For the constant surface area targets, a conventional wisdom is confirmed, as the target volume increases the corresponding volumes V12Gy, V14Gy and V16Gy also increase. In the 100-meningioma patient cohort, the best univariate model featured tumor surface area as the most significantly associated variable with both V12Gy and V14Gy volumes, corresponding to the adjusted R2 values of 0.82 and 0.77, respectively. Two statistical methods converged to matching multivariable models.In a univariate model, target surface area is a better predictor of spilled dose to normal tissue than target largest dimension or target volume itself. In complex multivariate models, target surface area is an independent variable for modeling radiosurgical normal tissue toxicity risk."
https://openalex.org/W2981641282,"Physiological responses to arm and leg-cycling are different, which may influence psychological and biological mechanisms that influence post-exercise cognitive performance. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of maximal and submaximal (absolute and relative intensity matched) arm and leg-cycling on executive function. Thirteen males (age, 24.7 ± 5.0 years) initially undertook two incremental exercise tests to volitional exhaustion for arm-cycling (82 ± 18 W) and leg-cycling (243 ± 52 W) for the determination of maximal power output. Participants subsequently performed three 20-min constant load exercise trials: (1) arm-cycling at 50% of the ergometer-specific maximal power output (41 ± 9 W), (2) leg-cycling at 50% of the ergometer-specific maximal power output (122 ± 26 W), and (3) leg-cycling at the same absolute power output as the submaximal arm-cycling trial (41 ± 9 W). An executive function task was completed before, immediately after and 15-min after each exercise test. Exhaustive leg-cycling increased reaction time (p < 0.05, d = 1.17), while reaction time reduced following exhaustive arm-cycling (p < 0.05, d = -0.62). Improvements in reaction time were found after acute relative intensity arm (p < 0.05, d = -0.76) and leg-cycling (p < 0.05, d = -0.73), but not following leg-cycling at the same absolute intensity as arm-cycling (p > 0.05). Improvements in reaction time following arm-cycling were maintained for at least 15-min post exercise (p = 0.008, d = -0.73). Arm and leg-cycling performed at the same relative intensity elicit comparable improvements in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that individuals restricted to arm exercise possess a similar capacity to elicit an exercise-induced cognitive performance benefit."
https://openalex.org/W2981861014,"Chromatin remodelers use helicase-like ATPase domains to reorganize histone–DNA contacts within the nucleosome. Like other remodelers, the chromodomain helicase DNA-binding protein 1 (Chd1) remodeler repositions nucleosomes by altering DNA topology at its internal binding site on the nucleosome, coupling different degrees of DNA twist and DNA movement to distinct nucleotide-bound states of the ATPase motor. In this work, we used a competition assay to study how variations in the bound nucleotide, Chd1, and the nucleosome substrate affect stability of Chd1–nucleosome complexes. We found that Chd1–nucleosome complexes formed in nucleotide-free or ADP conditions were relatively unstable and dissociated within 30 s, whereas those with the nonhydrolyzable ATP analog AMP-PNP had a mean lifetime of 4.8 ± 0.7 min. Chd1–nucleosome complexes were remarkably stable with ADP·BeF3− and the transition state analogs ADP·AlFX and ADP·MgFX, being resistant to competitor nucleosome over a 24-h period. For the tight ADP·BeF3−–stabilized complex, Mg2+ was a critical component that did not freely exchange, and formation of these long-lived complexes had a slow, concentration-dependent step. The ADP·BeF3−–stabilized complex did not require the Chd1 DNA-binding domain nor the histone H4 tail and appeared relatively insensitive to sequence differences on either side of the Widom 601 sequence. Interestingly, the complex remained stable in ADP·BeF3− even when nucleosomes contained single-stranded gaps that disrupted most DNA contacts with the guide strand. This finding suggests that binding via the tracking strand alone is sufficient for stabilizing the complex in a hydrolysis-competent state."
https://openalex.org/W2981890517,"The integration of multiple perspectives in both the arts and natural sciences is tremendously powerful and arguably necessary for capturing relevant features of complex phenomena. Individual methods and models comprise abstractions from and idealizations of nature, and only the integration of multiple models, methods, and representations provides a means to reach more accurate results than relying on any single approach. In my Mildred Cohn Award Lecture at the 2019 ASBMB meeting, I illustrated the power of such multidisciplinary work by highlighting the successful integration of data and multiple views afforded by NMR spectroscopy, cryo-electron microscopy, cryo-electron tomography, X-ray crystallography, computation, and functional assays made possible through collaborative efforts by members of the Pittsburgh Center for HIV Protein Interactions. This approach permitted us to generate the first all-atom model of a native HIV-1 capsid core."
https://openalex.org/W2982063632,"While template-free protein structure prediction protocols now produce good quality models for many targets, modelling failure remains common. For these methods to be useful it is important that users can both choose the best model from the hundreds to thousands of models that are commonly generated for a target, and determine whether this model is likely to be correct. We have developed Random Forest Quality Assessment (RFQAmodel), which assesses whether models produced by a protein structure prediction pipeline have the correct fold. RFQAmodel uses a combination of existing quality assessment scores with two predicted contact map alignment scores. These alignment scores are able to identify correct models for targets that are not otherwise captured. Our classifier was trained on a large set of protein domains that are structurally diverse and evenly balanced in terms of protein features known to have an effect on modelling success, and then tested on a second set of 244 protein domains with a similar spread of properties. When models for each target in this second set were ranked according to the RFQAmodel score, the highest-ranking model had a high-confidence RFQAmodel score for 67 modelling targets, of which 52 had the correct fold. At the other end of the scale RFQAmodel correctly predicted that for 59 targets the highest-ranked model was incorrect. In comparisons to other methods we found that RFQAmodel is better able to identify correct models for targets where only a few of the models are correct. We found that RFQAmodel achieved a similar performance on the model sets for CASP12 and CASP13 free-modelling targets. Finally, by iteratively generating models and running RFQAmodel until a model is produced that is predicted to be correct with high confidence, we demonstrate how such a protocol can be used to focus computational efforts on difficult modelling targets. RFQAmodel and the accompanying data can be downloaded from http://opig.stats.ox.ac.uk/resources."
https://openalex.org/W2980532805,"Combining population genetic studies with demographic surveys in long-lived clonal herbs can yield insight into the population dynamics of clonal plant populations. In this study, we assayed clonal diversity and spatial genetic structure in a population of a long-lived understory herb, Trillium recurvatum, that has been the focus of a demographic study spanning 26 years at the Meeman Biological Station in Memphis, Tennessee, USA. Using a set of five newly developed simple sequence repeat markers first reported here, we assessed 1) the extent of clonal diversity within the Meeman site, 2) the degree to which genetic diversity varies with stage class (juvenile, non-flowering, and flowering adults) at this site, 3) whether there is spatial genetic structure at the Meeman site, and 4) how measures of genetic diversity and inbreeding at the Meeman site compare to two additional nearby populations. Along with these analyses, we calculated and compared traditional population genetic metrics with information theory-based diversity indices. Although clonal propagation was present, the focal population displayed moderate levels of clonal diversity comprising 81 genets from the 174 individuals sampled. In the focal site, we also found that genetic diversity was highest in the flowering stage class when compared to the non-flowering and juvenile classes. We report that genets exhibited spatial genetic structure in the focal site exhibiting values for the Sp statistic of 0.00199 for linear distance and 0.0271 for log distance. Measures of unbiased gene diversity and the inbreeding coefficient were comparable across the sampled populations. Our results provide complementary genetic data to previous demographic studies in T. recurvatum, and these findings provide data for future studies aimed at integrating the degree of clonality, genetic variation, and population dynamics in this species. Our findings suggest that T. recurvatum at the focal Meeman site displays higher levels of sexual reproduction than were previously suggested, and spatial genetic structure estimates were comparable to other plant species with mixed and outcrossing mating strategies."

MNPs consist of various noble metallic elements can combine diverse electronic, optical and catalytic properties in a single NP configuration, thus taking the advantage of each element. In this paper, the fabrication of tri- and quad- metallic alloy NPs with noble elements (Ag, Au, Pd and Pt) and the corresponding localized surface plasmon resonance (LPSR) properties are systematically demonstrated. Tri- and quad-metallic alloy NPs come in various size and configurations by the solid-state dewetting of Ag/Au/Pd/Pt quad-layers on sapphire (0001). Tri-metallic AuPdPt NPs are demonstrated by the systematic control of growth temperature along with the significant Ag atom sublimation. Strongly enhanced and tunable LPSR is exerted in the UV-VIS regions depending upon the size, configuration, spacing and elemental composition of the MNPs. The size dependent LSPR response of MNPs is discussed based on the absorption and scattering along with the excitation of dipolar, quadrupolar, high order and multipolar resonance modes. The MNPs exhibit much stronger and dynamic LSPR bands as compared with the monometallic Pt and Pd NPs with the comparable size and configurations."
