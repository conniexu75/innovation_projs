https://openalex.org/W2998795963,"Glia have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Variants of the microglia receptor triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) increase AD risk, and activation of disease-associated microglia (DAM) is dependent on TREM2 in mouse models of AD. We surveyed gene-expression changes associated with AD pathology and TREM2 in 5XFAD mice and in human AD by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. We confirmed the presence of Trem2-dependent DAM and identified a previously undiscovered Serpina3n+C4b+ reactive oligodendrocyte population in mice. Interestingly, remarkably different glial phenotypes were evident in human AD. Microglia signature was reminiscent of IRF8-driven reactive microglia in peripheral-nerve injury. Oligodendrocyte signatures suggested impaired axonal myelination and metabolic adaptation to neuronal degeneration. Astrocyte profiles indicated weakened metabolic coordination with neurons. Notably, the reactive phenotype of microglia was less evident in TREM2-R47H and TREM2-R62H carriers than in non-carriers, demonstrating a TREM2 requirement in both mouse and human AD, despite the marked species-specific differences."

https://openalex.org/W3000522739,"Traditionally viewed as an autodigestive pathway, autophagy also facilitates cellular secretion; however, the mechanisms underlying these processes remain unclear. Here, we demonstrate that components of the autophagy machinery specify secretion within extracellular vesicles (EVs). Using a proximity-dependent biotinylation proteomics strategy, we identify 200 putative targets of LC3-dependent secretion. This secretome consists of a highly interconnected network enriched in RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and EV cargoes. Proteomic and RNA profiling of EVs identifies diverse RBPs and small non-coding RNAs requiring the LC3-conjugation machinery for packaging and secretion. Focusing on two RBPs, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K (HNRNPK) and scaffold-attachment factor B (SAFB), we demonstrate that these proteins interact with LC3 and are secreted within EVs enriched with lipidated LC3. Furthermore, their secretion requires the LC3-conjugation machinery, neutral sphingomyelinase 2 (nSMase2) and LC3-dependent recruitment of factor associated with nSMase2 activity (FAN). Hence, the LC3-conjugation pathway controls EV cargo loading and secretion."

https://openalex.org/W3000668520,"MET exon 14 alterations are oncogenic drivers of non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs)1. These alterations are associated with increased MET activity and preclinical sensitivity to MET inhibition2. Crizotinib is a multikinase inhibitor with potent activity against MET3. The antitumor activity and safety of crizotinib were assessed in 69 patients with advanced NSCLCs harboring MET exon 14 alterations. Objective response rate was 32% (95% confidence interval (CI), 21-45) among 65 response-evaluable patients. Objective responses were observed independent of the molecular heterogeneity that characterizes these cancers and did not vary by splice-site region and mutation type of the MET exon 14 alteration, concurrent increased MET copy number or the detection of a MET exon 14 alteration in circulating tumor DNA. The median duration of response was 9.1 months (95% CI, 6.4-12.7). The median progression-free survival was 7.3 months (95% CI, 5.4-9.1). MET exon 14 alteration defines a molecular subgroup of NSCLCs for which MET inhibition with crizotinib is active. These results address an unmet need for targeted therapy in people with lung cancers with MET exon 14 alterations and adds to an expanding list of genomically driven therapies for oncogenic subsets of NSCLC."
https://openalex.org/W3000332038,"The ability to preserve metabolically active livers ex vivo for 1 week or more could allow repair of poor-quality livers that would otherwise be declined for transplantation. Current approaches for normothermic perfusion can preserve human livers for only 24 h. Here we report a liver perfusion machine that integrates multiple core physiological functions, including automated management of glucose levels and oxygenation, waste-product removal and hematocrit control. We developed the machine in a stepwise fashion using pig livers. Study of multiple ex vivo parameters and early phase reperfusion in vivo demonstrated the viability of pig livers perfused for 1 week without the need for additional blood products or perfusate exchange. We tested the approach on ten injured human livers that had been declined for transplantation by all European centers. After a 7-d perfusion, six of the human livers showed preserved function as indicated by bile production, synthesis of coagulation factors, maintained cellular energy (ATP) and intact liver structure. Livers are stored long term in a sophisticated perfusion system."
https://openalex.org/W2999404032,"Personalized cancer vaccines targeting patient-specific neoantigens are a promising cancer treatment modality; however, neoantigen physicochemical variability can present challenges to manufacturing personalized cancer vaccines in an optimal format for inducing anticancer T cells. Here, we developed a vaccine platform (SNP-7/8a) based on charge-modified peptide–TLR-7/8a conjugates that are chemically programmed to self-assemble into nanoparticles of uniform size (~20 nm) irrespective of the peptide antigen composition. This approach provided precise loading of diverse peptide neoantigens linked to TLR-7/8a (adjuvant) in nanoparticles, which increased uptake by and activation of antigen-presenting cells that promote T-cell immunity. Vaccination of mice with SNP-7/8a using predicted neoantigens (n = 179) from three tumor models induced CD8 T cells against ~50% of neoantigens with high predicted MHC-I binding affinity and led to enhanced tumor clearance. SNP-7/8a delivering in silico-designed mock neoantigens also induced CD8 T cells in nonhuman primates. Altogether, SNP-7/8a is a generalizable approach for codelivering peptide antigens and adjuvants in nanoparticles for inducing anticancer T-cell immunity. Cancer vaccines that self-assemble into uniform nanoparticles improve tumor clearance."
https://openalex.org/W3000365770,"The molecular changes that occur with aging are not well understood1–4. Here, we performed longitudinal and deep multiomics profiling of 106 healthy individuals from 29 to 75 years of age and examined how different types of ‘omic’ measurements, including transcripts, proteins, metabolites, cytokines, microbes and clinical laboratory values, correlate with age. We identified both known and new markers that associated with age, as well as distinct molecular patterns of aging in insulin-resistant as compared to insulin-sensitive individuals. In a longitudinal setting, we identified personal aging markers whose levels changed over a short time frame of 2–3 years. Further, we defined different types of aging patterns in different individuals, termed ‘ageotypes’, on the basis of the types of molecular pathways that changed over time in a given individual. Ageotypes may provide a molecular assessment of personal aging, reflective of personal lifestyle and medical history, that may ultimately be useful in monitoring and intervening in the aging process. Longitudinal multiomics profiling of a cohort of healthy people reveals distinct aging patterns—termed ageotypes—in different individuals."

https://openalex.org/W2998914148,"Protein-coding de novo mutations (DNMs) are significant risk factors in many neurodevelopmental disorders, whereas schizophrenia (SCZ) risk associated with DNMs has thus far been shown to be modest. We analyzed DNMs from 1,695 SCZ-affected trios and 1,077 published SCZ-affected trios to better understand the contribution to SCZ risk. Among 2,772 SCZ probands, exome-wide DNM burden remained modest. Gene set analyses revealed that SCZ DNMs were significantly concentrated in genes that were highly expressed in the brain, that were under strong evolutionary constraint and/or overlapped with genes identified in other neurodevelopmental disorders. No single gene surpassed exome-wide significance; however, 16 genes were recurrently hit by protein-truncating DNMs, corresponding to a 3.15-fold higher rate than the mutation model expectation (permuted 95% confidence interval: 1-10 genes; permuted P = 3 × 10-5). Overall, DNMs explain a small fraction of SCZ risk, and larger samples are needed to identify individual risk genes, as coding variation across many genes confers risk for SCZ in the population."
https://openalex.org/W3000149627,"A lack of tools to precisely control gene expression has limited our ability to evaluate relationships between expression levels and phenotypes. Here, we describe an approach to titrate expression of human genes using CRISPR interference and series of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) with systematically modulated activities. We used large-scale measurements across multiple cell models to characterize activities of sgRNAs containing mismatches to their target sites and derived rules governing mismatched sgRNA activity using deep learning. These rules enabled us to synthesize a compact sgRNA library to titrate expression of ~2,400 genes essential for robust cell growth and to construct an in silico sgRNA library spanning the human genome. Staging cells along a continuum of gene expression levels combined with single-cell RNA-seq readout revealed sharp transitions in cellular behaviors at gene-specific expression thresholds. Our work provides a general tool to control gene expression, with applications ranging from tuning biochemical pathways to identifying suppressors for diseases of dysregulated gene expression. Gene expression is precisely modulated with CRISPR interference and mismatched guide RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W2999103251,"Unlike the sensory thalamus, studies on the functional organization of the midline and intralaminar nuclei are scarce, and this has hindered the establishment of conceptual models of the function of this brain region. We investigated the functional organization of the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT), a midline thalamic structure that is increasingly being recognized as a critical node in the control of diverse processes such as arousal, stress, emotional memory and motivation, in mice. We identify two major classes of PVT neurons-termed type I and type II-that differ in terms of gene expression, anatomy and function. In addition, we demonstrate that type II neurons belong to a previously neglected class of PVT neurons that convey arousal-related information to corticothalamic neurons of the infralimbic cortex. Our results uncover the existence of an arousal-modulated thalamo-corticothalamic loop that links the PVT and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex."
https://openalex.org/W2999521630,"Schizophrenia is a highly polygenic disorder with important contributions from both common and rare risk alleles. We analyzed exome sequencing data for de novo variants (DNVs) in a new sample of 613 schizophrenia trios and combined this with published data to give a total of 3,444 trios. In this new data, loss-of-function (LoF) DNVs were significantly enriched among 3,471 LoF-intolerant genes, which supports previous findings. In the full dataset, genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders (n = 159) were significantly enriched for LoF DNVs. Within these neurodevelopmental disorder genes, SLC6A1, which encodes a γ-aminobutyric acid transporter, was associated with missense-damaging DNVs. In 1,122 trios for which genome-wide common variant data were available, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder polygenic risk were significantly overtransmitted to probands. Probands carrying LoF or deletion DNVs in LoF-intolerant or neurodevelopmental disorder genes had significantly less overtransmission of schizophrenia polygenic risk than did non-carriers, which provides a second robust line of evidence that these DNVs increase liability to schizophrenia. Rees et al. show that de novo mutations in the gene SLC6A1, and more broadly across evolutionary constrained genes and genes implicated in neurodevelopmental disorders, increase the risk for developing schizophrenia."
https://openalex.org/W2998985600,"Socioeconomic factors influence brain development and structure, but most studies have overlooked neurotoxic insults that impair development, such as lead exposure. Childhood lead exposure affects cognitive development at the lowest measurable concentrations, but little is known about its impact on brain development during childhood. We examined cross-sectional associations among brain structure, cognition, geocoded measures of the risk of lead exposure and sociodemographic characteristics in 9,712 9- and 10-year-old children. Here we show stronger negative associations of living in high-lead-risk census tracts in children from lower- versus higher-income families. With increasing risk of exposure, children from lower-income families exhibited lower cognitive test scores, smaller cortical volume and smaller cortical surface area. Reducing environmental insults associated with lead-exposure risk might confer greater benefit to children experiencing more environmental adversity, and further understanding of the factors associated with high lead-exposure risk will be critical for improving such outcomes in children."
https://openalex.org/W3000375548,"Temperatures that deviate from the long-term local norm affect human health, and are projected to become more frequent as the global climate changes1. There are limited data on how such anomalies affect deaths from injuries. In the present study, we used data on mortality and temperature over 38 years (1980-2017) in the contiguous USA and formulated a Bayesian spatio-temporal model to quantify how anomalous temperatures, defined as deviations of monthly temperature from the local average monthly temperature over the entire analysis period, affect deaths from unintentional (transport, falls and drownings) and intentional (assault and suicide) injuries, by age group and sex. We found that a 1.5 °C anomalously warm year, as envisioned under the Paris Climate Agreement2, would be associated with an estimated 1,601 (95% credible interval 1,430-1,776) additional injury deaths. Of these additional deaths, 84% would occur in males, mostly in adolescence to middle age. These would comprise increases in deaths from drownings, transport, assault and suicide, offset partly by a decline in deaths from falls in older ages. The findings demonstrate the need for targeted interventions against injuries during periods of anomalously warm temperatures, especially as these episodes are likely to increase with global climate change."

https://openalex.org/W2999518264,"Midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons encode both reward- and movement-related events and are implicated in disorders of reward processing as well as movement. Consequently, disentangling the contribution of DA neurons in reinforcing versus generating movements is challenging and has led to lasting controversy. In this study, we dissociated these functions by parametrically varying the timing of optogenetic manipulations in a Pavlovian conditioning task and examining the influence on anticipatory licking before reward delivery. Inhibiting both ventral tegmental area and substantia nigra pars compacta DA neurons in the post-reward period had a significantly greater behavioral effect than inhibition in the pre-reward period of the task. Furthermore, the contribution of DA neurons to behavior decreased linearly as a function of elapsed time after reward. Together, the results indicate a temporally restricted role of DA neurons primarily related to reinforcing stimulus–reward associations and suggest that directly generating movements is a comparatively less important function. In mice that have undergone Pavlovian reward conditioning, dopaminergic neurons regulate conditioned movements in a temporally restricted manner, consistent with a primary contribution to associative learning rather than online movement generation."
https://openalex.org/W3000719530,"Progress in high-throughput metabolic profiling provides unprecedented opportunities to obtain insights into the effects of drugs on human metabolism. The Biobanking BioMolecular Research Infrastructure of the Netherlands has constructed an atlas of drug-metabolite associations for 87 commonly prescribed drugs and 150 clinically relevant plasma-based metabolites assessed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance. The atlas includes a meta-analysis of ten cohorts (18,873 persons) and uncovers 1,071 drug-metabolite associations after evaluation of confounders including co-treatment. We show that the effect estimates of statins on metabolites from the cross-sectional study are comparable to those from intervention and genetic observational studies. Further data integration links proton pump inhibitors to circulating metabolites, liver function, hepatic steatosis and the gut microbiome. Our atlas provides a tool for targeted experimental pharmaceutical research and clinical trials to improve drug efficacy, safety and repurposing. We provide a web-based resource for visualization of the atlas (http://bbmri.researchlumc.nl/atlas/)."
https://openalex.org/W2998858138,"Discovery of genotype-phenotype relationships remains a major challenge in clinical medicine. Here, we combined three sources of phenotypic data to uncover a new mechanism for rare and common diseases resulting from collagen secretion deficits. Using a zebrafish genetic screen, we identified the ric1 gene as being essential for skeletal biology. Using a gene-based phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) in the EHR-linked BioVU biobank, we show that reduced genetically determined expression of RIC1 is associated with musculoskeletal and dental conditions. Whole-exome sequencing identified individuals homozygous-by-descent for a rare variant in RIC1 and, through a guided clinical re-evaluation, it was discovered that they share signs with the BioVU-associated phenome. We named this new Mendelian syndrome CATIFA (cleft lip, cataract, tooth abnormality, intellectual disability, facial dysmorphism, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) and revealed further disease mechanisms. This gene-based, PheWAS-guided approach can accelerate the discovery of clinically relevant disease phenome and associated biological mechanisms."

https://openalex.org/W2999157667,"Introduction The first 90 of the 90-90-90 initiative introduced by the World Health Organization(WHO) in 2015 requires 90% of people with HIV be aware of their status by 2020. In South Africa, conventional facility-based testing had reached 84.9% in 2018; innovative new methods, like HIV self-testing(HIVST) may close the testing gap. This study aimed to determine the usability of seven HIVST kits among untrained South Africans. Methods This cross-sectional study of 1400 adults in Johannesburg evaluated the usability of five blood fingerstick and two oral fluid HIVSTs, using WHO prequalification criteria, from June 2016 to June 2018. Participants were handed one kit, with no further information about the device or test procedure, and asked to perform the test in front of an observer. The observer used product-specific semi-structured questionnaires organized into a composite usability index(UI) using a HIVST process checklist, a contrived results interpretation and a post-test interview that expanded on participant experiences with the device and instructions-of-use(IFU). Participants were not tested themselves, but provided with contrived results to interpret. Results The average UI was 92.8%(84.2%-97.6%); the major difficulty was obtaining and transferring the specimen. Participants correctly interpreted 96.1% of the non-reactive/negative, 97.0% of the reactive/positive, 98.0% of the invalid and 79.9% of the weak positive results. Almost all participants(97.0%) stated they would visit a clinic or seek treatment for positive results; with negative results, half(50.6%) stated they should re-test in the next three months while one-third(36.1%) said they should condomize. Nearly all found the devices easy to use(96.6%), the IFUSs easy to understand(97.9%) and felt confident using the test unassisted(95.9%) but suggested improvements to packaging/IFUs to further increase usability; 19.9% preferred clinic-based testing to HIVST. Conclusion The UI and interpretation of results was high and in-line with previous usability studies, suggesting that these kits are appropriate for use in the general, untrained and unsupervised public."
https://openalex.org/W2999258534,"The entorhinal cortex contains neurons that represent self-location, including grid cells that fire in periodic locations and velocity signals that encode running speed and head direction. Although the size and shape of the environment influence grid patterns, whether entorhinal velocity signals are equally influenced or provide a universal metric for self-motion across environments remains unknown. Here we report that speed cells rescale after changes to the size and shape of the environment. Moreover, head direction cells reorganize in an experience-dependent manner to align with the axis of environmental change. A knockout mouse model allows dissociation of the coordination between cell types, with grid and speed cells, but not head direction cells, responding in concert to environmental change. These results point to malleability in the coding features of multiple entorhinal cell types and have implications for which cell types contribute to the velocity signal used by computational models of grid cells."

https://openalex.org/W2999954565,"The role of the ligaments is fundamental in determining the spine biomechanics in physiological and pathological conditions. The anterior longitudinal ligament (ALL) is fundamental in constraining motions especially in the sagittal plane. The ALL also confines the intervertebral discs, preventing herniation. The specific contribution of the ALL has indirectly been investigated in the past as a part of whole spine segments where the structural flexibility was measured. The mechanical properties of isolated ALL have been measured as well. The strain distribution in the ALL has never been measured under pseudo-physiological conditions, as part of multi-vertebra spine segments. This would help elucidate the biomechanical function of the ALL. The aim of this study was to investigate in depth the biomechanical function of the ALL in front of the lumbar vertebrae and of the intervertebral disc. Five lumbar cadaveric spine specimens were subjected to different loading scenarios (flexion-extension, lateral bending, axial torsion) using a state-of-the-art spine tester. The full-field strain distribution on the anterior surface was measured using digital image correlation (DIC) adapted and validated for application to spine segments. The measured strain maps were highly inhomogeneous: the ALL was generally more strained in front of the discs than in front of the vertebrae, with some locally higher strains both imputable to ligament fibers and related to local bony defects. The strain distributions were significantly different among the loading configurations, but also between opposite directions of loading (flexion vs. extension, right vs. left lateral bending, clockwise vs. counterclockwise torsion). This study allowed for the first time to assess the biomechanical behaviour of the anterior longitudinal ligament for the different loading of the spine. We were able to identify both the average trends, and the local effects related to osteophytes, a key feature indicative of spine degeneration."
https://openalex.org/W3000571328,"Background It has been unclear whether diabetes mellitus (DM) is positively associated with a risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In addition, whether the risk of VTE is altered in patients with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) has rarely been explored. Aim We investigated whether patients with T1DM are at a relatively high risk of VTE development. Methods We retrieved data from the National Health Insurance Research Database of Taiwan to conduct this retrospective cohort study. The T1DM group consisted of 4967 patients diagnosed as having T1DM before 2003. The non-T1DM group comprised 19 868 age- and sex-matched enrollees without T1DM. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was used to investigate the hazard ratio of VTE in patients with T1DM relative to those without T1DM. Results During a mean follow-up period of 8.61 years, the risk of VTE in the T1DM group was 5.33-fold higher than in the non-T1DM group after adjusting for dyslipidemia, hypertension, stroke, lower leg fracture or surgery, and obesity. Further stratified analysis revealed that the risk of VTE was significantly high in both sexes and in all age groups below the age of 60. Conclusion T1DM appears to be an independent risk factor for VTE development."
https://openalex.org/W3000594515,"Microbiome research has experienced a surge of interest in recent years due to the advances and reduced cost of next-generation sequencing technology. The production of high quality and comparable data is dependent on proper sample collection and storage and should be standardized as far as possible. However, this becomes challenging when samples are collected in the field, especially in resource-limited settings. We investigated the impact of different stool storage methods common to the TB-CHAMP clinical trial on the microbial communities in stool. Ten stool samples were subjected to DNA extraction after 48-hour storage at -80°C, room temperature and in a cooler-box, as well as immediate DNA extraction. Three stool DNA extraction kits were evaluated based on DNA yield and quality. Quantitative PCR was performed to determine the relative abundance of the two major gut phyla Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and other representative microbial groups. The bacterial populations in the frozen group closely resembled the immediate extraction group, supporting previous findings that storage at -80°C is equivalent to the gold standard of immediate DNA extraction. More variation was seen in the room temperature and cooler-box groups, which may be due to the growth temperature preferences of certain bacterial populations. However, for most bacterial populations, no significant differences were found between the storage groups. As seen in other microbiome studies, the variation between participant samples was greater than that related to differences in storage. We determined that the risk of introducing bias to microbial community profiling through differences in storage will likely be minimal in our setting."
https://openalex.org/W2999624847,"The stress-induced kinase, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase 1 (JNK1) has previously been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis. However, the exact cell type(s) wherein JNK1 exerts its pro-fibrotic role(s) remained enigmatic. Herein we demonstrate prominent activation of JNK in bronchial epithelia using the mouse models of bleomycin- or AdTGFβ1-induced fibrosis. Furthermore, in lung tissues of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), active JNK was observed in various regions including type I and type II pneumocytes and fibroblasts. No JNK activity was observed in adjacent normal tissue or in normal control tissue. To address the role of epithelial JNK1, we ablated Jnk1 form bronchiolar and alveolar type II epithelial cells using CCSP-directed Cre recombinase-mediated ablation of LoxP-flanked Jnk1 alleles. Our results demonstrate that ablation of Jnk1 from airway epithelia resulted in a strong protection from bleomycin- or adenovirus expressing active transforming growth factor beta-1 (AdTGFβ1)-induced fibrosis. Ablation of the Jnk1 allele at a time when collagen increases were already present showed a reversal of existing increases in collagen content. Epithelial Jnk1 ablation resulted in attenuation of mesenchymal genes and proteins in lung tissue and preserved expression of epithelial genes. Collectively, these data suggest that epithelial JNK1 contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis. Given the presence of active JNK in lungs from patients with IPF, targeting JNK1 in airway epithelia may represent a potential treatment strategy to combat this devastating disease."

https://openalex.org/W3000489404,"In a process linked to DNA replication, duplicated chromosomes are entrapped in large, circular cohesin complexes and functional sister chromatid cohesion (SCC) is established by acetylation of the SMC3 cohesin subunit. Roberts Syndrome (RBS) and Warsaw Breakage Syndrome (WABS) are rare human developmental syndromes that are characterized by defective SCC. RBS is caused by mutations in the SMC3 acetyltransferase ESCO2, whereas mutations in the DNA helicase DDX11 lead to WABS. We found that WABS-derived cells predominantly rely on ESCO2, not ESCO1, for residual SCC, growth and survival. Reciprocally, RBS-derived cells depend on DDX11 to maintain low levels of SCC. Synthetic lethality between DDX11 and ESCO2 correlated with a prolonged delay in mitosis, and was rescued by knockdown of the cohesin remover WAPL. Rescue experiments using human or mouse cDNAs revealed that DDX11, ESCO1 and ESCO2 act on different but related aspects of SCC establishment. Furthermore, a DNA binding DDX11 mutant failed to correct SCC in WABS cells and DDX11 deficiency reduced replication fork speed. We propose that DDX11, ESCO1 and ESCO2 control different fractions of cohesin that are spatially and mechanistically separated."
https://openalex.org/W3000575030,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common liver cancer, accountable for 90% cases. Visfatin and vaspin are adipocytokines with various suggested functions and proven significant correlations between BMI and percentage of body fat. The aim was to assess visfatin and vaspin serum levels in HCC patients and controls, compare their levels in patients with different cancer etiology and grade assessed according to the Barcelona-Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) staging system. The additional aim was to analyze relationship between analyzed adipokines and metabolic abnormalities and liver disfunction severity. The study was performed on 69 cirrhotic patients (54 males/15 females) with HCC, aged 59.0 ± 12.1 years, and with BMI 29.0 ± 4.5 kg/m2 compared to 20 healthy volunteers. Serum visfatin and vaspin concentrations were significantly increased in HCC patients compared to controls (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02, respectively). Serum vaspin was significantly higher in HCC patients with viral compared to those with non-viral etiology (p = 0.02), with more evident increase in chronic hepatitis C patients (CHC). Serum visfatin levels were significantly higher in patients with higher insulin resistance (p = 0.04) and with platelets count > 100 000/mm3 (p<0.001). Patients with BMI >30 kg/m2 had markedly up-regulated vaspin levels (p = 0.04). There was no difference in vaspin and visfatin serum levels with respect to liver dysfunction and BCLC classification. In conclusion, our study revealed serum vaspin and visfatin to be significantly increased in HCC patients independently of cancer etiology compared to controls. Additionally, serum vaspin was elevated in viral disease, especially in CHC. Vaspin up-regulation can be a compensatory mechanism against IR in HCC patients. Serum visfatin and vaspin, although up-regulated, seem not to be associated with cancer grade and cirrhosis severity."
https://openalex.org/W2999929574,"This paper explores the phenomenon of international servicification of manufacturing from the period 1995 to 2011. By applying empirical techniques of Social Network Analysis and graph theory, we find that the network of flows of intermediate services embodied in manufacturing exports is still slightly dense and would not correspond to a traditional centre-periphery structure. The mapping shows a numerous, highly cohesive group of countries, with China, the USA and Germany as central economies and an increasing leading role of Asian economies, which would indicate their commitment to upgrading within global value chains. We go a step further by empirically analysing the impact of the countries' centrality in the global network of intermediate services on manufacturing competitiveness. Our findings reveal that, together with the level of embodiment of intermediate services into manufacturing exports, who the providers of those services inputs are is a key determining factor for manufacturing competitiveness."
https://openalex.org/W3000447577,"Recently, poor control of Echinochloa colona with glyphosate has been reported in no-till agriculture systems of the northern grain region (NGR) of Australia. Two experiments were conducted using 10 populations of E. colona selected from the NGR of Australia to understand differences in their growth behavior and resistance pattern. Growth studies revealed that these populations differed in plant height (53-70 cm plant-1), tiller production (30-52 tillers plant-1), leaf production (124-186 leaves plant-1) and seed head production (37-65 seed heads plant-1). Days taken to seed heads and shoot biomass in these populations ranged between 40-48 d and 21-27 g plant-1, respectively. Seed production in these populations ranged between 5380 and 10244 seeds plant-1; lowest for population B17/25 and highest for population B17/13. Correlation studies revealed that seed number plant-1 had a positive correlation with tiller number plant-1 (r = 0.73) and negative relation with days taken to seed head initiation (r = - 0.65). The glyphosate dose-response study showed a wide range of responses in these populations and the glyphosate dose required to kill 50% plants (LD50 values) was estimated between 161 to 2339 g a.e. glyphosate ha-1. LD50 values of populations B17/16, B 17/34 and B17/35 were 1086, 2339 and 1153 g ha-1, respectively, making them 6.7, 15.1 and 7.2-fold resistant to glyphosate compared with the susceptible population B17/37. Growth behavior and seed production potential in these populations had no correlation with the resistance index. These results suggest that some populations of E. colona are highly problematic; for example, population B17/34 was not only highly glyphosate-resistant, but also produced a high seed number (9300 seeds plant-1). This study demonstrated that there is a possibility of great risk with the increased use of glyphosate for managing E. colona in the NGR of Australia. The results warrant integrated weed management strategies and improved stewardship guidelines are required for managing glyphosate-resistant populations of E. colona and to restrict further movement of resistant populations to other regions of Australia."

We propose a new method based on canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to integrate subject-specific models and subject-independent information and enhance BCI performance. We propose to use training data of other subjects to optimize hyperparameters for CCA-based model of a specific subject. An ensemble version of the proposed method is also developed for a fair comparison with ensemble task-related component analysis (TRCA). The proposed method is compared with TRCA and extended CCA methods. A publicly available, 35-subject SSVEP benchmark dataset is used for comparison studies and performance is quantified by classification accuracy and ITR. The ITR of the proposed method is higher than those of TRCA and extended CCA. The proposed method outperforms extended CCA in all conditions and TRCA for time windows greater than 0.3 s. The proposed method also outperforms TRCA when there are limited training blocks and electrodes. This study illustrates that adding subject-independent information to subject-specific models can improve performance of SSVEP-based BCIs."
https://openalex.org/W2999543078,"Photoperiod is considered the most dominant environmental cue allowing animals to anticipate and adapt to seasonal changes. In seasonally breeding mammals, changes in daylength alter pineal melatonin secretion and pituitary prolactin secretion. During the seasonal transition to shorter winter daylengths, increased production of melatonin and declining prolactin are associated with triggering winter coat growth in many animals. Similarly, studies have shown that artificial extension of photoperiod suppresses melatonin secretion and lifts prolactin inhibition to activate moulting. Four longitudinal cohort studies were conducted to determine if extended photoperiod and warmth, provided by mobile light masks and rugs (horse blankets), could reverse the onset of winter coat growth, maintain the summer coat and accelerate winter coat shedding in horses and in ponies. Studies began at dates corresponding to the autumnal equinox, one month post-summer solstice, one month pre-winter solstice and one month post-winter solstice, respectively. To extend photoperiod to approximately 15h of light, commercially available head-worn light masks provided low intensity blue light to one eye until 11pm daily. Coat condition and shedding rate were scored and hair samples collected, measured and weighed bi-weekly. Data from control and treatment groups were analysed by repeated measures ANOVA. Results revealed that extended photoperiod 1) did not reverse winter coat growth when initiated at the autumnal equinox, 2) effectively maintained the summer coat in stabled horses when initiated one month post-summer solstice, 3) accelerated shedding in outdoor living horses when initiated one month pre-winter solstice and 4) did not accelerate shedding in indoor or outdoor living ponies when initiated one month post-winter solstice. To successfully manage equine coat growth while also preserving optimal thermoregulation in both competition and breeding stock correct timing of light application is crucial and requires careful monitoring of environmental temperature. Further studies are needed where variations in breed and management are considered."
https://openalex.org/W3000112894,"Type 1 secretion systems (T1SSs) are broadly distributed among bacteria and translocate effectors with diverse function across the bacterial cell membrane. Legionella pneumophila, the species most commonly associated with Legionellosis, encodes a T1SS at the lssXYZABD locus which is responsible for the secretion of the virulence factor RtxA. Many investigations have failed to detect lssD, the gene encoding the membrane fusion protein of the RtxA T1SS, in non-pneumophila Legionella, which has led to the assumption that this system is a virulence factor exclusively possessed by L. pneumophila. Here we discovered RtxA and its associated T1SS in a novel Legionella taurinensis strain, leading us to question whether this system may be more widespread than previously thought. Through a bioinformatic analysis of publicly available data, we classified and determined the distribution of four T1SSs including the RtxA T1SS and four novel T1SSs among diverse Legionella spp. The ABC transporter of the novel Legionella T1SS Legionella repeat protein secretion system shares structural similarity to those of diverse T1SS families, including the alkaline protease T1SS in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The Legionella bacteriocin (1–3) secretion systems T1SSs are novel putative bacteriocin transporting T1SSs as their ABC transporters include C-39 peptidase domains in their N-terminal regions, with LB2SS and LB3SS likely constituting a nitrile hydratase leader peptide transport T1SSs. The LB1SS is more closely related to the colicin V T1SS in Escherichia coli. Of 45 Legionella spp. whole genomes examined, 19 (42%) were determined to possess lssB and lssD homologs. Of these 19, only 7 (37%) are known pathogens. There was no difference in the proportions of disease associated and non-disease associated species that possessed the RtxA T1SS (p = 0.4), contrary to the current consensus regarding the RtxA T1SS. These results draw into question the nature of RtxA and its T1SS as a singular virulence factor. Future studies should investigate mechanistic explanations for the association of RtxA with virulence."

https://openalex.org/W2999062631,"The innate immune response induced by type I interferons (IFNs) plays a critical role in the establishment of HIV infection. IFNs are induced early in HIV infection and trigger an antiviral defense program by signaling through the IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR), which consists of two subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2. Changes in IFNAR expression in HIV target cells, as well as other immune cells, could therefore have important consequences for initial HIV spread. It was previously reported that IFNAR2 expression is increased in peripheral blood CD4+ CXCR4+ T cells of HIV+ patients compared to HIV uninfected controls, suggesting that HIV infection may alter the IFN responsiveness of target cells. However, the earliest immune cells affected by HIV in vivo reside in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). To date, it remains unknown if IFNAR expression is altered in GALT immune cells in the context of HIV infection and exposure to IFNs, including the 12 IFNα subtypes. Here, we analyzed the expression of surface bound and soluble IFNAR2 on Lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMCs) isolated from the GALT of HIV- individuals and in plasma samples of HIV+ patients. IFNAR2 expression varied between different T cells, B cells and natural killer cells, but was not altered following HIV infection. Furthermore, expression of the soluble IFNAR2a isoform was not changed in HIV+ patients compared to healthy donors, nor in LPMCs after HIV-1 infection ex vivo. Even though the 12 human IFNα subtypes trigger different biological responses and vary in their affinity to both receptor subunits, stimulation of LPMCs with different recombinant IFNα subtypes did not result in any significant changes in IFNAR2 surface expression. Our data suggests that potential changes in the IFN responsiveness of mucosal immune cells during HIV infection are unlikely dictated by changes in IFNAR2 expression."
https://openalex.org/W3000128785,"Soil particles and bound nutrients that erode from agricultural land may end up in surface waters and cause undesirable changes to the environment. Various measures, among them constructed wetlands have been proposed as mitigation, but their efficiency varies greatly. This work was motivated by the assumption that the induced coagulation of particles may accelerate sedimentation in such wetlands and by that help reduce the amount of material that is lost from the vicinity of the diffuse source. Our specific aim was to laboratory-test the effectiveness of various salt-based coagulants in accelerating the process of sedimentation. We tested the effect of Na+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe3+ and Al3+ cations in 10, 20, 40 and 80 mg L-1 doses added to a soil solution in select, soluble forms of their chlorides, sulphates and hydroxides. We mixed such salts with 1 gram of physically dispersed, clay and silt rich (>85% in total) soil material in 500 mL of solution and used time-lapse photography and image analysis to evaluate the progress of sedimentation over 3 hours. We found that 20-40 mg L-1 doses of Mg2+, Ca2+ in their chloride or sulphate forms appeared to provide the best consensus in terms of efficiently accelerating sedimentation using environmentally present and acceptable salts but keeping their dosage to a minimum. Comprehensive in-field efficiency and environmental acceptability testing is warranted prior to any practical implementation, as well as an assessment of small scale economic and large-scale environmental benefits by retaining soil and nutrients at/near the farm."
