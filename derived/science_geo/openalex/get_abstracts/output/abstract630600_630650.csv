https://openalex.org/W2788228074,"Accurate genome assembly is hampered by repetitive regions. Although long single molecule sequencing reads are better able to resolve genomic repeats than short-read data, most long-read assembly algorithms do not provide the repeat characterization necessary for producing optimal assemblies. Here, we present Flye, a long-read assembly algorithm that generates arbitrary paths in an unknown repeat graph, called disjointigs, and constructs an accurate repeat graph from these error-riddled disjointigs. We benchmark Flye against five state-of-the-art assemblers and show that it generates better or comparable assemblies, while being an order of magnitude faster. Flye nearly doubled the contiguity of the human genome assembly (as measured by the NGA50 assembly quality metric) compared with existing assemblers."
https://openalex.org/W2927507212,"Trajectory inference approaches analyze genome-wide omics data from thousands of single cells and computationally infer the order of these cells along developmental trajectories. Although more than 70 trajectory inference tools have already been developed, it is challenging to compare their performance because the input they require and output models they produce vary substantially. Here, we benchmark 45 of these methods on 110 real and 229 synthetic datasets for cellular ordering, topology, scalability and usability. Our results highlight the complementarity of existing tools, and that the choice of method should depend mostly on the dataset dimensions and trajectory topology. Based on these results, we develop a set of guidelines to help users select the best method for their dataset. Our freely available data and evaluation pipeline ( https://benchmark.dynverse.org ) will aid in the development of improved tools designed to analyze increasingly large and complex single-cell datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2932049125,"Several studies have investigated links between the gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC), but questions remain about the replicability of biomarkers across cohorts and populations. We performed a meta-analysis of five publicly available datasets and two new cohorts and validated the findings on two additional cohorts, considering in total 969 fecal metagenomes. Unlike microbiome shifts associated with gastrointestinal syndromes, the gut microbiome in CRC showed reproducibly higher richness than controls (P < 0.01), partially due to expansions of species typically derived from the oral cavity. Meta-analysis of the microbiome functional potential identified gluconeogenesis and the putrefaction and fermentation pathways as being associated with CRC, whereas the stachyose and starch degradation pathways were associated with controls. Predictive microbiome signatures for CRC trained on multiple datasets showed consistently high accuracy in datasets not considered for model training and independent validation cohorts (average area under the curve, 0.84). Pooled analysis of raw metagenomes showed that the choline trimethylamine-lyase gene was overabundant in CRC (P = 0.001), identifying a relationship between microbiome choline metabolism and CRC. The combined analysis of heterogeneous CRC cohorts thus identified reproducible microbiome biomarkers and accurate disease-predictive models that can form the basis for clinical prognostic tests and hypothesis-driven mechanistic studies."
https://openalex.org/W2928157366,"Neuritic plaques, a pathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, comprise extracellular aggregates of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide and degenerating neurites that accumulate autolysosomes. We found that, in the brains of patients with AD and in AD mouse models, Aβ plaque-associated Olig2- and NG2-expressing oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (OPCs), but not astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes, exhibit a senescence-like phenotype characterized by the upregulation of p21/CDKN1A, p16/INK4/CDKN2A proteins, and senescence-associated β-galactosidase activity. Molecular interrogation of the Aβ plaque environment revealed elevated levels of transcripts encoding proteins involved in OPC function, replicative senescence, and inflammation. Direct exposure of cultured OPCs to aggregating Aβ triggered cell senescence. Senolytic treatment of AD mice selectively removed senescent cells from the plaque environment, reduced neuroinflammation, lessened Aβ load, and ameliorated cognitive deficits. Our findings suggest a role for Aβ-induced OPC cell senescence in neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits in AD, and a potential therapeutic benefit of senolytic treatments."

https://openalex.org/W2890999059,"Quantum phase transitions (QPTs) involve transformations between different states of matter that are driven by quantum fluctuations1. These fluctuations play a dominant part in the quantum critical region surrounding the transition point, where the dynamics is governed by the universal properties associated with the QPT. Although time-dependent phenomena associated with classical, thermally driven phase transitions have been extensively studied in systems ranging from the early Universe to Bose–Einstein condensates2–5, understanding critical real-time dynamics in isolated, non-equilibrium quantum systems remains a challenge6. Here we use a Rydberg atom quantum simulator with programmable interactions to study the quantum critical dynamics associated with several distinct QPTs. By studying the growth of spatial correlations when crossing the QPT, we experimentally verify the quantum Kibble–Zurek mechanism (QKZM)7–9 for an Ising-type QPT, explore scaling universality and observe corrections beyond QKZM predictions. This approach is subsequently used to measure the critical exponents associated with chiral clock models10,11, providing new insights into exotic systems that were not previously understood and opening the door to precision studies of critical phenomena, simulations of lattice gauge theories12,13 and applications to quantum optimization14,15. A Rydberg atom quantum simulator with programmable interactions is used to experimentally verify the quantum Kibble–Zurek mechanism through the growth of spatial correlations during quantum phase transitions."
https://openalex.org/W2929354011,"Benchmark small variant calls are required for developing, optimizing and assessing the performance of sequencing and bioinformatics methods. Here, as part of the Genome in a Bottle (GIAB) Consortium, we apply a reproducible, cloud-based pipeline to integrate multiple short- and linked-read sequencing datasets and provide benchmark calls for human genomes. We generate benchmark calls for one previously analyzed GIAB sample, as well as six genomes from the Personal Genome Project. These new genomes have broad, open consent, making this a 'first of its kind' resource that is available to the community for multiple downstream applications. We produce 17% more benchmark single nucleotide variations, 176% more indels and 12% larger benchmark regions than previously published GIAB benchmarks. We demonstrate that this benchmark reliably identifies errors in existing callsets and highlight challenges in interpreting performance metrics when using benchmarks that are not perfect or comprehensive. Finally, we identify strengths and weaknesses of callsets by stratifying performance according to variant type and genome context."
https://openalex.org/W2934212324,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease ranges from steatosis to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), potentially progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we show that platelet number, platelet activation and platelet aggregation are increased in NASH but not in steatosis or insulin resistance. Antiplatelet therapy (APT; aspirin/clopidogrel, ticagrelor) but not nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) treatment with sulindac prevented NASH and subsequent HCC development. Intravital microscopy showed that liver colonization by platelets depended primarily on Kupffer cells at early and late stages of NASH, involving hyaluronan-CD44 binding. APT reduced intrahepatic platelet accumulation and the frequency of platelet–immune cell interaction, thereby limiting hepatic immune cell trafficking. Consequently, intrahepatic cytokine and chemokine release, macrovesicular steatosis and liver damage were attenuated. Platelet cargo, platelet adhesion and platelet activation but not platelet aggregation were identified as pivotal for NASH and subsequent hepatocarcinogenesis. In particular, platelet-derived GPIbα proved critical for development of NASH and subsequent HCC, independent of its reported cognate ligands vWF, P-selectin or Mac-1, offering a potential target against NASH. Blockade of intrahepatic accumulation and function of platelets represents a potential approach to treat non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and prevent subsequent progression to hepatocellular carcinoma"
https://openalex.org/W2935521291,"Human brain organoids generated with current technologies recapitulate histological features of the human brain, but they lack a reproducible topographic organization. During development, spatial topography is determined by gradients of signaling molecules released from discrete signaling centers. We hypothesized that introduction of a signaling center into forebrain organoids would specify the positional identity of neural tissue in a distance-dependent manner. Here, we present a system to trigger a Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) protein gradient in developing forebrain organoids that enables ordered self-organization along dorso-ventral and antero-posterior positional axes. SHH-patterned forebrain organoids establish major forebrain subdivisions that are positioned with in vivo-like topography. Consistent with its behavior in vivo, SHH exhibits long-range signaling activity in organoids. Finally, we use SHH-patterned cerebral organoids as a tool to study the role of cholesterol metabolism in SHH signaling. Together, this work identifies inductive signaling as an effective organizing strategy to recapitulate in vivo-like topography in human brain organoids."
https://openalex.org/W2935468986,"Learned fear often relapses after extinction, suggesting that extinction training generates a new memory that coexists with the original fear memory; however, the mechanisms governing the expression of competing fear and extinction memories remain unclear. We used activity-dependent neural tagging to investigate representations of fear and extinction memories in the dentate gyrus. We demonstrate that extinction training suppresses reactivation of contextual fear engram cells while activating a second ensemble, a putative extinction engram. Optogenetic inhibition of neurons that were active during extinction training increased fear after extinction training, whereas silencing neurons that were active during fear training reduced spontaneous recovery of fear. Optogenetic stimulation of fear acquisition neurons increased fear, while stimulation of extinction neurons suppressed fear and prevented spontaneous recovery. Our results indicate that the hippocampus generates a fear extinction representation and that interactions between hippocampal fear and extinction representations govern the suppression and relapse of fear after extinction. Lacagnina et al. show that extinction training suppresses the associated hippocampal fear engram and generates a distinct extinction engram. Reactivation of extinction engram cells reduces fear, while reactivation of fear engram cells causes fear relapse."
https://openalex.org/W2930099314,"Although mass spectrometry is well suited to identifying thousands of potential protein post-translational modifications (PTMs), it has historically been biased towards just a few. To measure the entire set of PTMs across diverse proteomes, software must overcome the dual challenges of covering enormous search spaces and distinguishing correct from incorrect spectrum interpretations. Here, we describe TagGraph, a computational tool that overcomes both challenges with an unrestricted string-based search method that is as much as 350-fold faster than existing approaches, and a probabilistic validation model that we optimized for PTM assignments. We applied TagGraph to a published human proteomic dataset of 25 million mass spectra and tripled confident spectrum identifications compared to its original analysis. We identified thousands of modification types on almost 1 million sites in the proteome. We show alternative contexts for highly abundant yet understudied PTMs such as proline hydroxylation, and its unexpected association with cancer mutations. By enabling broad characterization of PTMs, TagGraph informs as to how their functions and regulation intersect. A string-based computational tool enables swift, robust identification of post-translational modifications in MS/MS datasets."
https://openalex.org/W2932926289,"Growth plate cartilage contributes to the generation of a large variety of shapes and sizes of skeletal elements in the mammalian system. The removal of cartilage and how this process regulates bone shape are not well understood. Here we identify a non-bone-resorbing osteoclast subtype termed vessel-associated osteoclast (VAO). Endothelial cells at the bone/cartilage interface support VAOs through a RANKL-RANK signalling mechanism. In contrast to classical bone-associated osteoclasts, VAOs are dispensable for cartilage resorption and regulate anastomoses of type H vessels. Remarkably, proteinases including matrix metalloproteinase-9 (Mmp9) released from endothelial cells, not osteoclasts, are essential for resorbing cartilage to lead directional bone growth. Importantly, disrupting the orientation of angiogenic blood vessels by misdirecting them results in contorted bone shape. This study identifies proteolytic functions of endothelial cells in cartilage and provides a framework to explore tissue-lytic features of blood vessels in fracture healing, arthritis and cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2933961522,"Epithelial barrier loss is a driver of intestinal and systemic diseases. Myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) is a key effector of barrier dysfunction and a potential therapeutic target, but enzymatic inhibition has unacceptable toxicity. Here, we show that a unique domain within the MLCK splice variant MLCK1 directs perijunctional actomyosin ring (PAMR) recruitment. Using the domain structure and multiple screens, we identify a domain-binding small molecule (divertin) that blocks MLCK1 recruitment without inhibiting enzymatic function. Divertin blocks acute, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced MLCK1 recruitment as well as downstream myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation, barrier loss, and diarrhea in vitro and in vivo. Divertin corrects barrier dysfunction and prevents disease development and progression in experimental inflammatory bowel disease. Beyond applications of divertin in gastrointestinal disease, this general approach to enzymatic inhibition by preventing access to specific subcellular sites provides a new paradigm for safely and precisely targeting individual properties of enzymes with multiple functions."

https://openalex.org/W2934492351,"The rise of antibiotic resistance demands the acceleration of molecular diversification strategies to inspire new chemical entities for antibiotic medicines. We report here on the large-scale engineering of ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides carrying the ring-forming amino acid lanthionine. New-to-nature variants featuring distinct properties were obtained by combinatorial shuffling of peptide modules derived from 12 natural antimicrobial lanthipeptides and processing by a promiscuous post-translational modification machinery. For experimental characterization, we developed the nanoFleming, a miniaturized and parallelized high-throughput inhibition assay. On the basis of a hit set of >100 molecules, we identified variants with improved activity against pathogenic bacteria and shifted activity profiles, and extrapolated design guidelines that will simplify the identification of peptide-based anti-infectives in the future. Combinatorial shuffling of peptide sequence modules, post-translational modification and screening with a high-throughput growth inhibition assay results in the identification of lanthipeptide variants with altered antibacterial activities."
https://openalex.org/W2929901429,"Recent single-cell RNA-sequencing studies have suggested that cells follow continuous transcriptomic trajectories in an asynchronous fashion during development. However, observations of cell flux along trajectories are confounded with population size effects in snapshot experiments and are therefore hard to interpret. In particular, changes in proliferation and death rates can be mistaken for cell flux. Here we present pseudodynamics, a mathematical framework that reconciles population dynamics with the concepts underlying developmental trajectories inferred from time-series single-cell data. Pseudodynamics models population distribution shifts across trajectories to quantify selection pressure, population expansion, and developmental potentials. Applying this model to time-resolved single-cell RNA-sequencing of T-cell and pancreatic beta cell maturation, we characterize proliferation and apoptosis rates and identify key developmental checkpoints, data inaccessible to existing approaches. A new computational method allows key developmental checkpoints and important parameters of population dynamics to be inferred from single-cell RNA-sequencing time series data."
https://openalex.org/W2963793485,"Sensory stimuli can be recognized more rapidly when they are expected. This phenomenon depends on expectation affecting the cortical processing of sensory information. However, the mechanisms responsible for the effects of expectation on sensory circuits remain elusive. In the present study, we report a novel computational mechanism underlying the expectation-dependent acceleration of coding observed in the gustatory cortex of alert rats. We use a recurrent spiking network model with a clustered architecture capturing essential features of cortical activity, such as its intrinsically generated metastable dynamics. Relying on network theory and computer simulations, we propose that expectation exerts its function by modulating the intrinsically generated dynamics preceding taste delivery. Our model's predictions were confirmed in the experimental data, demonstrating how the modulation of ongoing activity can shape sensory coding. Altogether, these results provide a biologically plausible theory of expectation and ascribe an alternative functional role to intrinsically generated, metastable activity."
https://openalex.org/W2934350872,"Despite expanding knowledge regarding the role of astroglia in regulating neuronal function, little is known about regional or functional subgroups of brain astroglia and how they may interact with neurons. We use an astroglia-specific promoter fragment in transgenic mice to identify an anatomically defined subset of adult gray matter astroglia. Using transcriptomic and histological analyses, we generate a combinatorial profile for the in vivo identification and characterization of this astroglia subpopulation. These astroglia are enriched in mouse cortical layer V; express distinct molecular markers, including Norrin and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), with corresponding layer-specific neuronal ligands; are found in the human cortex; and modulate neuronal activity. Astrocytic Norrin appears to regulate dendrites and spines; its loss, as occurring in Norrie disease, contributes to cortical dendritic spine loss. These studies provide evidence that human and rodent astroglia subtypes are regionally and functionally distinct, can regulate local neuronal dendrite and synaptic spine development, and contribute to disease."

These engineered pertuzumab variants show increased lysosomal delivery and cytotoxicity towards tumor cells expressing intermediate HER2 levels. In HER2int xenograft tumor models in mice, the variants show higher therapeutic efficacy than the parent ADC and a clinically approved HER2-specific ADC. An antibody–drug conjugate targeting HER2 is acid-switched to increase its antitumor efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W2933469919,"Cell wall glycopolymers on the surface of Gram-positive bacteria are fundamental to bacterial physiology and infection biology. Here we identify gacH, a gene in the Streptococcus pyogenes group A carbohydrate (GAC) biosynthetic cluster, in two independent transposon library screens for its ability to confer resistance to zinc and susceptibility to the bactericidal enzyme human group IIA-secreted phospholipase A2. Subsequent structural and phylogenetic analysis of the GacH extracellular domain revealed that GacH represents an alternative class of glycerol phosphate transferase. We detected the presence of glycerol phosphate in the GAC, as well as the serotype c carbohydrate from Streptococcus mutans, which depended on the presence of the respective gacH homologs. Finally, nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of GAC confirmed that glycerol phosphate is attached to approximately 25% of the GAC N-acetylglucosamine side-chains at the C6 hydroxyl group. This previously unrecognized structural modification impacts host–pathogen interaction and has implications for vaccine design. Genetic, structural and biochemical analysis identifies GacH as a glycerol phosphate transferase that modifies N-acetylglucosamine components of group A carbohydrates (GAC) in streptococcal cell walls."
https://openalex.org/W2933733617,"During mouse postnatal eye development, the embryonic hyaloid vascular network regresses from the vitreous as an adaption for high-acuity vision. This process occurs with precisely controlled timing. Here, we show that opsin 5 (OPN5; also known as neuropsin)-dependent retinal light responses regulate vascular development in the postnatal eye. In Opn5-null mice, hyaloid vessels regress precociously. We demonstrate that 380-nm light stimulation via OPN5 and VGAT (the vesicular GABA/glycine transporter) in retinal ganglion cells enhances the activity of inner retinal DAT (also known as SLC6A3; a dopamine reuptake transporter) and thus suppresses vitreal dopamine. In turn, dopamine acts directly on hyaloid vascular endothelial cells to suppress the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and promote hyaloid vessel regression. With OPN5 loss of function, the vitreous dopamine level is elevated and results in premature hyaloid regression. These investigations identify violet light as a developmental timing cue that, via an OPN5–dopamine pathway, regulates optic axis clearance in preparation for visual function. Nguyen et al. show that neuropsin (OPN5) suppresses hyaloid vessel regression in the developing mouse retina in response to light, by regulation of the dopamine reuptake transporter and DRD2-dependent suppression of VEGFR2 activity."

The mVHH-IgA can be produced in soybean seeds or secreted from the yeast Pichia pastoris, freeze- or spray-dried and orally delivered within food."
https://openalex.org/W2934705609,"Although transactional sex is common in many sexual relationships, there has been little research into the degree to which the practice is considered exploitative in the settings in which it is practiced. We describe the social norms that influence transactional sex in two sites in Mwanza, Tanzania, and explore local understandings of whether and under what conditions it is considered exploitative. We then compare these “emic” understandings of exploitation to international definitions and norms around sexual exploitation. This study employed a qualitative research design involving 18 focus group discussions and 43 in-depth interviews with young people aged 14–24 years and parents with children aged 14–24 years in a rural area and an urban center within Mwanza, Tanzania. Thematic analysis was conducted with the aid of NVivo 10. The social norms influencing the practice of transactional sex included: reciprocity as a core cultural value that permeates the way exchange in sexual relationships is judged; gendered expectations that men should provide for women’s material needs in sexual relationships and that women should reciprocate by means of sex; and peer pressure to be perceived as “fashionable”. Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are under strong peer pressure to conform to a “modern lifestyle” as reflected in stylish clothing and other items of modernity such as cellphones. The emic conceptualization of exploitation is defined by circumstances surrounding the relationship or a sexual encounter. Important factors that characterize local notions of when transactional relationships are considered exploitative include: when the encounter or relationship involves an imbalance of power (based on age, male economic power and social status); when a man fails to reciprocate; and when sex is coerced. According to community perspectives, young women’s behavior should be considered exploitative of men when they take gifts or money yet refuse sex or when they demand large sums of money. Interventions aimed at reducing AGYW’s exploitation through transactional sex need to be cognizant of the variations in the understanding of what constitutes sexual exploitation as well as the social and gender norms influencing the practice of transactional sex. Interventions need to involve communities and families in critical thinking that helps them identify positive alternatives to current gendered social norms that shape the involvement of AGYW and men in transactional sex."
https://openalex.org/W2930180746,"The present study explored the motivation of rural-urban migrants who moved from the Himalaya foothills of Uttarakhand to its capital city, Dehradun. A survey of 100 migrant families reported their socio-economic profile before and after migration, personal and general reasons for migration, problems in the village and in the city, and perception of push- and pull factors. A remote sensing-based analysis of land cover and forest changes was conducted for two villages of the migrants' origin, aiming to link the reasons for migration to land cover changes. This was contextualised by reported large scale changes in forest cover. Major reasons for migration mentioned in this study were education, employment opportunities with the associated income, and facilities. These were perceived as both, push and pull factors, whereas environmental factors ranked very low. Declining environment or agriculture were never mentioned spontaneously as personal reason, and only occasionally as a presumed general reason for migration, but were frequently confirmed as a major problem in the village. Thus, although such problems existed, they seemed not a major driver of rural-urban migration. For most of the respondents their migration resulted in a profound change of livelihoods and significantly improved their socio-economic situation. Land and forest cover around the chosen villages fluctuated by up to 15% with a trend to increasing forest cover in recent years. At the district and state scales, forest cover was rather stable. These results question the narrative of deforestation and environmental degradation in the Himalayas as major push-factors for rural-urban migration in Uttarakhand. Even if environmental constraints were felt, it was rather the differences in socio-economic opportunities (education, employment, facilities) that drove people to migrate to the city. Regarding the push-pull paradigm, we conclude that scenarios of external conditions under which people migrate cannot be evaluated without taking the migrants' attitudes and choices into account."
https://openalex.org/W2934701388,"Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) remains the most prevalent nosocomial pathogen and carries the carbapenemase (KPC) gene which confers resistance towards carbapenem. Thus, it is necessary to discover novel antimicrobials to address the issue of antimicrobial resistance in such pathogens. Natural products such as essential oils are a promising source due to their complex composition. Essential oils have been shown to be effective against pathogens, but the overall mechanisms have yet to be fully explained. Understanding the molecular mechanisms of essential oil towards KPC-KP cells would provide a deeper understanding of their potential use in clinical settings. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the mode of action of essential oil against KPC-KP cells from a proteomic perspective by comparing the overall proteome profile of KPC-KP cells treated with cinnamon bark (Cinnamomum verum J. Presl) essential oil (CBO) at their sub-inhibitory concentration of 0.08% (v/v). A total of 384 proteins were successfully identified from the non-treated cells, whereas only 242 proteins were identified from the CBO-treated cells. Proteins were then categorized based on their biological processes, cellular components and molecular function prior to pathway analysis. Pathway analysis showed that CBO induced oxidative stress in the KPC-KP cells as indicated by the abundance of oxidative stress regulator proteins such as glycyl radical cofactor, catalase peroxidase and DNA mismatch repair protein. Oxidative stress is likely to oxidize and disrupt the bacterial membrane as shown by the loss of major membrane proteins. Several genes selected for qRT-PCR analysis validated the proteomic profile and were congruent with the proteomic abundance profiles. In conclusion, KPC-KP cells exposed to CBO undergo oxidative stress that eventually disrupts the bacterial membrane possibly via interaction with the phospholipid bilayer. Interestingly, several pathways involved in the bacterial membrane repair system were also affected by oxidative stress, contributing to the loss of cells viability."

https://openalex.org/W2932719794,"Current fructose consumption levels often overwhelm the intestinal capacity to absorb fructose. We investigated the impact of fructose malabsorption on intestinal endocrine function and addressed the role of the microbiota in this process. To answer this question, a mouse model of moderate fructose malabsorption [ketohexokinase mutant (KHK)−/−] and wild-type (WT) littermate mice were used and received a 20%-fructose (KHK-F and WT-F) or 20%-glucose diet. Cholecystokinin (Cck) mRNA and protein expression in the ileum and cecum, as well as preproglucagon (Gcg) and neurotensin (Nts) mRNA expression in the cecum, increased in KHK-F mice. In KHK-F mice, triple-label immunohistochemistry showed major up-regulation of CCK in enteroendocrine cells (EECs) that were glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)+/Peptide YY (PYY−) in the ileum and colon and GLP-1−/PYY− in the cecum. The cecal microbiota composition was drastically modified in the KHK-F in association with an increase in glucose, propionate, succinate, and lactate concentrations. Antibiotic treatment abolished fructose malabsorption-dependent induction of cecal Cck mRNA expression and, in mouse GLUTag and human NCI-H716 cells, Cck mRNA expression levels increased in response to propionate, both suggesting a microbiota-dependent process. Fructose reaching the lower intestine can modify the composition and metabolism of the microbiota, thereby stimulating the production of CCK from the EECs possibly in response to propionate.—Zhang, X., Grosfeld, A., Williams, E., Vasiliauskas, D., Barretto, S., Smith, L., Mariadassou, M., Philippe, C., Devime, F., Melchior, C., Gourcerol, G., Dourmap, N., Lapaque, N., Larraufie, P., Blottière, H.

https://openalex.org/W2926719416,"Background Many factors contribute to suboptimal diabetes control including insufficiently-intensive treatment and non-adherence to medication and lifestyle. Determining which of these is most relevant for individual patients is challenging. Patient engagement techniques may help identify contributors to suboptimal adherence and address barriers (using motivational interviewing) and help facilitate choices among treatment augmentation options (using shared decision-making). These methods have not been used in combination to improve diabetes outcomes. Objective To evaluate the impact of a telephone-based patient-centered intervention on glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) control for individuals with poorly-controlled diabetes. Design Two-arm pragmatic randomized control trial within an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. Subjects 1,400 participants 18–64 years old with poorly-controlled type 2 diabetes. Intervention The intervention was delivered over the telephone by a clinical pharmacist and consisted of a 2-step process that integrated brief negotiated interviewing and shared decision-making to identify patient goals and options for enhancing diabetes management. Main measures The primary outcome was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes were medication adherence measures. Outcomes were evaluated using intention-to-treat principles; multiple imputation was used for missing values in the 12-month follow-up. We used information from pharmacist notes to elicit factors to potentially explain the intervention’s effectiveness. Key results Participants had a mean age of 54.7 years (SD:8.3) and baseline HbA1c of 9.4 (SD:1.6). Change in HbA1c from baseline was -0.79 (SD:2.01) in the control arm and -0.75 (SD:1.76) in the intervention arm (difference:+0.04, 95%CI: -0.22, 0.30). There were no significant differences in adherence. In as-treated analyses, the intervention significantly improved diabetes control (-0.48, 95%CI: -0.91, -0.05). Qualitative findings provided several potential explanations for the findings, including insufficiently addressing patient barriers. Conclusions A novel telephone-based patient-centered intervention did not improve HbA1c among individuals with poorly-controlled diabetes, though as-treated analyses suggest that the intervention was effective for those who received it.

https://openalex.org/W2929403821,"Objectives Pelvic congestion syndrome is defined as chronic pelvic pain due to incompetent (dilated and refluxing) pelvic veins. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of this condition by examining the prevalence of dilated ovarian and para-uterine veins in pre- and postmenopausal female patients, irrespective of their symptoms. We subsequently investigated how many women with dilated veins suffered from chronic pelvic pain. Additionally, we attempted to define diagnostic criteria that may allow for early identification of affected patients. Methods We reassessed 2384 abdomino-pelvic computed tomography scans performed on women at our institution. The maximal diameters of the ovarian and para-uterine veins were measured. Patients with a pathological process in the abdomen or pelvis affecting the veins were excluded. We considered ovarian vein dilation to be 6 mm or more in the axial plane. For patients that met these criteria, we performed a retrospective chart review to evaluate the clinical presentation and/or symptoms of these patients. Results Dilated pelvic veins were present in 293/2384 (12%) patients, 118/559 premenopausal (21%) and 175/1825 postmenopausal (10%). Chronic pelvic pain of unclear etiology had been documented prior to the CT in 54/293 (18%) women with dilated veins—2% of the whole study collective (54/2384); 8% of all premenopausal (44/559) and 0.5% of all postmenopausal (10/1825). It was often accompanied by urological symptoms such as hematuria, dysuria, and urinary frequency, in the absence of infection (p<0.05). We identified a strong correlation between the presence of dilated ovarian veins and chronic pelvic pain in premenopausal parous patients with hematuria. Conclusions Pelvic congestion syndrome appears to be an underdiagnosed and undertreated disease. In our study, 8% of all premenopausal women had documented chronic pelvic pain of unclear etiology and dilated ovarian and pelvic veins on cross-sectional imaging studies. The features we identified in this study as most relevant should enable a faster identification of patients who could benefit from a specific treatment regimen for this condition."

In-depth understanding of the key variables responsible for disease spread, current hotspots, and vulnerable landscapes is crucial for disease early warning and management. We mapped aggregated disease distribution and hotspots in the AGLR and identified vulnerable landscapes across African banana production zones. Available data on disease prevalence collected over 11 years was regressed against environmental and expert developed covariates to develop the AGLR XW hotspots map. For the Africa-wide risk map, precipitation, distance to hotspots, degree of trade in fresh banana products, production zone interconnectedness and banana genotype composition were used as covariates. In the AGLR, XW was mainly correlated to precipitation and disease/banana management. Altitude and temperature had unexpectedly low effects, possibly due to an overriding impact of tool-mediated spread which is part of the management covariate. In the AGLR, the eastern part of DR Congo was a large hotspot with highest vulnerability. Apart from endemic zones in the AGLR and Ethiopia, northern Mozambique was perceived as a moderate risk zone mainly due to the predominance of ‘Bluggoe’ (Musa ABB type) which is highly susceptible to insect-vectored transmission. Presence of XW hotspots (e.g. eastern DR Congo) and vulnerable areas with low (e.g. north-western Tanzania) or no disease (e.g. Congo basin, western DR Congo and northern Mozambique) pressure suggest key areas where proactive measures e.g. quarantines and information sharing on XW diagnosis, epidemiology, and control could be beneficial."
https://openalex.org/W2930966579,"The pelagic ecosystems of the Western Antarctic Peninsula are dynamic and changing rapidly in the face of sustained warming. There is already evidence that warming may be impacting the food web. Antarctic krill, Euphausia superba, is an ice-associated species that is both an important prey item and the target of the only commercial fishery operating in the region. The goal of this study is to develop a dynamic trophic model for the region that includes the impact of the sea-ice regime on krill and krill predators. Such a model may be helpful to fisheries managers as they develop new management strategies in the face of continued sea-ice loss. A mass balanced food-web model (Ecopath) and time dynamic simulations (Ecosim) were created. The Ecopath model includes eight currently monitored species as single species to facilitate its future development into a model that could be used for marine protected area planning in the region. The Ecosim model is calibrated for the years 1996-2012. The successful calibration represents an improvement over existing Ecopath models for the region. Simulations indicate that the role of sea ice is both central and complex. The simulations are only able to recreate observed biomass trends for the monitored species when metrics describing the sea-ice regime are used to force key predator-prey interactions, and to drive the biomasses of Antarctic krill and the fish species Gobionotothen gibberifrons. This model is ready to be used for exploring results from sea-ice scenarios or to be developed into a spatial model that informs discussions regarding the design of marine protected areas in the region."

https://openalex.org/W2930776640,"Diabetes, a chronic disease affecting over 29 million people in the United States, requires the integration of complex medical tasks into a person’s daily life. Patient-centered care and compassion are recognized as essential dimensions of the quality care experience. This research examined provider attributes that influence adherence to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) regimens and sought to understand the phenomena of provider attributes, treatment adherence, and their relationship to coping ability and treatment outcomes. This quantitative study sampled 474 people with T2DM using a 62-item online survey administered to three different groups. The sample population included people over age 18 diagnosed with T2DM. The first group included 91 persons with T2DM identified through a Facebook group and personal social media connections, the second group included 120 Amazon Mechanical Turk participants with T2DM, and the third group included 263 respondents from a Qualtrics panel who had T2DM. Results indicated that perceived provider compassion (β = .41, ρ < .001) and optimism (β = .48, ρ < .001) positively affected coping ability. Additionally, full mediation effects for self-management were revealed, with coping ability positively mediating the effect of compassion on self-management and the effects of optimism on self-management. Furthermore, full mediation effects were found for treatment satisfaction, with coping ability positively mediating the effect of compassion on treatment satisfaction and the effects of optimism on treatment satisfaction. This research has implications for patients, healthcare professionals, and leaders suggesting that providers who communicate with optimism and compassion positively affect coping ability. As a result, healthcare providers and professionals have an opportunity to enhance self-management adherence by helping their patients cope with the burdens of diabetes. In addition, this study has implications for developing provider communication tools aimed at assessing patients’ coping capacity and increasing compassionate communication."
https://openalex.org/W2926112089,"An efficiently unlimited address space is provided by Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). It aims to accommodate thousands of hundreds of unique devices on a similar link. This can be achieved through the Duplicate Address Detection (DAD) process. It is considered one of the core IPv6 network’s functions. It is implemented to make sure that IP addresses do not conflict with each other on the same link. However, IPv6 design’s functions are exposed to security threats like the DAD process, which is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Such a threat prevents the host from configuring its IP address by responding to each Neighbor Solicitation (NS) through fake Neighbor Advertisement (NA). Various mechanisms have been proposed to secure the IPv6 DAD procedure. The proposed mechanisms, however, suffer from complexity, high processing time, and the consumption of more resources. The experiments-based findings revealed that all the existing mechanisms had failed to secure the IPv6 DAD process. Therefore, DAD-match security technique is proposed in this study to efficiently secure the DAD process consuming less processing time. DAD-match is built based on SHA-3 to hide the exchange tentative IP among hosts throughout the process of DAD in an IPv6 link-local network. The obtained experimental results demonstrated that the DAD-match security technique achieved less processing time compared with the existing mechanisms as it can resist a range of different threats like collision and brute-force attacks. The findings concluded that the DAD-match technique effectively prevents the DoS attack during the DAD process. The DAD-match technique is implemented on a small area IPv6 network; hence, the author future work is to implement and test the DAD-match technique on a large area IPv6 network."
https://openalex.org/W2934313383,"The popularity of myopia treatments based on the peripheral defocus theory has risen. So far, little evidence has emerged around the questions which of these treatments are effective and why. In order to establish a framework that enables clinicians and researchers to acknowledge the possible interactions of different defocus patterns across the retina, different peripheral refractive errors (PRX) of subjects and different designs of optical treatments were evaluated. Dioptric defocus patterns on the retinal level have been obtained by merging the matrices of dioptric defocus maps of the visual field of different scenarios with individual peripheral refractive errors and different optical designs of multifocal contact lenses. The newly obtained matrices were statistically compared using a non-parametric test with familywise error algorithms and multi-comparison tests. Results show that asymmetric peripheral refractive error profiles (temporal or nasal positively skewed) appear to be less prone to be changed by the defocus imposition of multifocal contact lenses than those presenting symmetric patterns (relative peripheral myopia or hyperopia)."
https://openalex.org/W2931103462,"We describe a biomarker-based approach to delivering chemotherapy that entails monitoring treatment changes in the circulating metabolome that reflect efficacy. In-vitro, multiple tumor cell lines were exposed to numerous chemotherapeutics. Supernatants were collected at baseline and 72 hours post treatment. MTT assays were used to quantify growth inhibition. Clinical samples were derived from a phase II clinical trial of second-line axitinib in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. Sera were collected at baseline and 2–4 weeks after treatment initiation. Response to therapy was estimated by CT scan at 8 weeks. Samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry to identify metabolomic changes associated with response. In vitro, we found drug-specific and generalizable patterns of change in the extracellular metabolome accompany growth inhibition. A cell death signature was also identified. This approach was also applied to clinical samples. While the in vitro signatures were detectable in vivo, a more robust signal was identified clinically that appeared within 4 weeks of administering drug that distinguished individuals with a treatment response. These changes were extinguished as tumor growth resumed. Serial monitoring of the metabolome during chemotherapy is a means to follow treatment efficacy and emergence of resistance, informing the oncologist whether to modify treatment."

There is a significant body of literature attributing the success of kicks to observed environmental and situational factors. However, the significance of these is not subject to agreement. In this study, we synthesize the deterministic and stochastic models based on data from the 2000–2017 NFL seasons to identify significant conditions associated with “choking.” This study’s empirical findings focus on integrating the statistical evidence on causality of skill and performance, and the interpretation of observed and unobserved heterogeneity of kicks, on the intervention effect of the new extra-point rule in the NFL since 2015, and on providing an in-depth evaluation of the impact of competition pressure."
https://openalex.org/W2929579427,"p21, an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinase, functions as an oncogene or tumor suppressor depending on the context of a variety of extracellular and intracellular signals. The expression of p21 could be regulated at the transcriptional and/or post-translational levels. The p21 gene is well-known to be regulated in both p53-dependent and -independent manners. However, the detailed regulatory mechanisms of p21 messenger RNA and protein expression via statins remain unknown, and the possible application of statins as anticancer reagents remains to be controversial. Our data showed that the statins—fluvastatin and lovastatin—induced p21 expression as general histone deacetylase inhibitors in a p53-independent manner, which is mediated through various pathways, such as apoptosis, autophagy, cell cycle progression, and DNA damage, to be involved in the function of p21 in HeLa cells. The curative effect repositioning of digoxin, a cardiovascular medication, was combined with fluvastatin and lovastatin, and the results further implied that p21 induction is involved in a p53-dependent and p53-independent manner. Digoxin modified the effects of statins on ATF3, p21, p53, and cyclin D1 expression, while fluvastatin boosted its DNA damage effect and lovastatin impeded its DNA damage effect. Fluvastatin and lovastatin combined with digoxin further support the localization specificity of their interactivity with our subcellular localization data. This study will not only clarify the regulatory mechanisms of p21 induction by statins but will also shed light on the repurposing of widely cardiovascular medications for the treatment of cervical cancer."

https://openalex.org/W2933637586,"Brassica crops require high amounts of inorganic sulfur (S) for optimum yield, and are characterized by the synthesis of S-rich glucosinolates (GSL). Although it is well established that seed and GSL yield can be increased by S fertilizer, the detailed relationship between S supply as primary source and the harvestable sinks of seed GSL and storage proteins is poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that Brassica juncea mustard seed acts as a secondary S sink, and so require a higher rate of S to achieve maximum seed GSL compared to rates required to attain maximum seed biomass. Our experimental strategy involved comparing responses to available S for seed biomass, GSL, and protein. This was carried out in a protected environment using sand culture for a high-GSL condiment-type homozygous B. juncea genotype. A low-GSL canola-type was used as a control, in order to establish a base-line of response. Significantly more S was required to achieve maximum seed GSL than was required to achieve maximum seed mass. Total seed protein content was not significantly affected by increased S. The high-GSL line appeared to have an efficient mechanism of S supply to the secondary S sink, given the observed increase in seed S with increased S availability. From a practical point of view, increases in seed GSL with S availability suggests that S fertilizer rates should be optimized for maximum seed GSL yield, rather that optimizing for seed yield, as occurs for most other crops."
https://openalex.org/W2933740802,"African migrants in Europe and continental Africans are disproportionately affected by type 2 diabetes (T2D). Both groups develop T2D at a younger age, and have higher morbidity and mortality from T2D and complications, compared to European populations. To reduce risk, and avoidable disability and premature deaths, culturally congruent and context specific interventions are required. This study aimed to: (a) assess perceptions and knowledge of T2D among Ghanaian migrants in Europe and their compatriots in Ghana and (b) identify specific perceptions and knowledge gaps that might predispose migrants to higher risk of diabetes. Data was gathered through 26 focus groups with 180 individuals, aged 21 to 70, from Amsterdam, Berlin and London and rural and urban Ashanti Region, Ghana. Thematic analysis of the data was informed by Social Representations Theory, which focuses on the sources, content and functions of social knowledge. Three key insights emerged from analysis. First, there was general awareness, across migrant and non-migrant groups, of T2D as a serious chronic condition with life threatening complications, and some knowledge of biomedical strategies to prevent diabetes (e.g healthy eating) and diabetes complications (e.g medication adherence). However, knowledge of T2D prevention and reduction of diabetes complications was not comprehensive. Secondly, knowledge of biomedical diabetes theories and interventions co-existed with theories about psychosocial and supernatural causes of diabetes and the efficacy of herbal and faith-based treatment of diabetes. Finally, migrants’ knowledge was informed by both Ghanaian and European systems of T2D knowledge suggesting enculturation dynamics. We discuss the development of culturally congruent and context-specific T2D interventions for the research communities."

Due to unavailability of pan-Nigerian reference values, local results interpretation is based on the use of Western values.This study aims to establish national reference values for some haematological parameters in apparently healthy young adult Nigerians.Seven Thousand, Seven Hundred and Ninety-Seven (7,797) volunteers aged 18 to 26 years participated in the study. Participants' interviewer-administered questionnaires and blood samples were collected, analyzed and those with confounding factors (HIV infection, Hepatitis B sero-positivity, Malaria and Pregnancy) were excluded from statistical analysis. The 95-percentile reference range was determined for each haematological parameter using SPSS Version 16®. The result obtained was reviewed with reference to already established reference values in two West African and Western countries.Blood specimens from 6153 (78.9%) participants [comprising 5915 (96.1%) males and 238 (3.9%) females] were analyzed after exclusion of 1,644 (21.1%) participants with confounding variables. Reference ranges among males and females varied and these were consistent with findings from two other West African countries. The median platelets count in this study was 218 x 109/l while commonly used Western value is 280 x 109/l. Other haematological parameters in the study were similar to Western values.The findings of this study will improve clinical and research decision-making. Considering that this study is limited to young adult participants, there is a need to conduct future pan-Nigerian studies that will include all age groups."

https://openalex.org/W2927679491,"Cocos nucifera (C. nucifera) (the coconut palm tree) has been traditionally used to fight a number of human diseases, but only a few studies have tested its components against parasites such as those that cause malaria. In this study, C. nucifera samples were collected from a private natural reserve in Punta Patiño, Darien, Panama. The husk, leaves, pulp, and milk of C. nucifera were extracted and evaluated against the parasites that cause Chagas' disease or American trypanosomiasis (Trypanosoma cruzi), leishmaniasis (Leishmania donovani) and malaria (Plasmodium falciparum), as well as against a line of breast cancer cells. While there was no activity in the rest of the tests, five and fifteen-minute aqueous decoctions of leaves showed antiplasmodial activity at 10% v/v concentration. Removal of some HPLC fractions resulted in loss of activity, pointing to the presence of synergy between the components of the decoction. Chemical molecules were separated and identified using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography (UPLC) approach coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using atmospheric pressure chemical ionization quadrupole-time of flight mass spectrometry (APCI-Q-TOF-MS) and molecular networking analysis, revealing the presence of compounds including polyphenol, flavone, sterol, fatty acid and chlorophyll families, among others."

In this paper, we present an extension of classic OP—Orienteering Problem with Functional Profits (OPFP), where the score of a specific point depends on its characteristics, position in the route, and other points in the route. For solving OPFP, we developed an open-source framework for solving orienteering problems, which utilizes four core components of OP in its modular architecture. Fully-written in Go programming language our framework can be extended for solving different types of tasks with different algorithms; this was demonstrated by implementation of two popular algorithms for OP solving—Ant Colony Optimization and Recursive Greedy Algorithm. Computational efficiency of the framework was shown through solving four well-known OP types: classic Orienteering Problem (OP), Orienteering Problem with Compulsory Vertices (OPCV), Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW), and Time Dependent Orienteering Problem (TDOP) along with OPFP. Experiments were conducted on a large multi-source dataset for Saint Petersburg, Russia, containing data from Instagram, TripAdvisor, Foursquare and official touristic website. Our framework is able to construct touristic paths for different OP types within few seconds using dataset with thousands of points of interest."
https://openalex.org/W2928915298,"Understanding spatial distributions of fish species is important to those seeking to manage fisheries and advise on marine developments. Distribution patterns, habitat use, and aggregative behaviour often vary throughout the life cycle and can increase the vulnerability of certain life stages to anthropogenic impacts. Here we investigate distribution changes during the life cycle of whiting (Merlangius merlangus) to the west of the UK. Density distributions for age-0, age-1 and mature fish were modelled as functions of environmental variables using generalised additive mixed effects models. The greatest densities of age-0 whiting occurred over finer sediments where temperatures were between 12 to 13°C. Age-0 whiting densities decreased with increasing depth. Higher densities of age-1 whiting were also associated with fine sediments and peaked at 60 m, but this influence was also dependent on proximity to shore. Mature fish, while showing no association with any particular sediment type, were strongly associated with depths >60 m. Geostatistical aggregation curves were used to classify space use and showed persistent aggregations of age-0 whiting occupying inshore waters while age-1 and mature fish were more dispersed and differed among years. The differences in distributions among life stages suggested a general coastal to offshore shift as cohorts developed with mature whiting mainly occupying deep offshore waters. The spatial dynamics and areas of persistent life stage aggregation identified here could enable informed targeting and avoidance of specific age-class whiting to aid bycatch reduction. Given that landing obligation legislation is counterproductive unless it encourages greater fishing selectivity, the ability to avoid this species and undersized individuals would aid conservation measures and fishermen alike."
https://openalex.org/W2932354804,"Introduction Osteoporosis (OP) risk factor assessment and bone mineral density (BMD) testing are frequently omitted at baseline in aromatase inhibitor (AI) studies, which may lead to misinterpretation of AI associated bone loss. The present study describes bone health of South African postmenopausal women of predominantly Mixed Ancestry, prior to AI treatment. Methods This descriptive baseline study, nested in a prospective AI cohort study, included postmenopausal women with endocrine sensitive breast cancer, aged 50 to 80 years. A baseline questionnaire documented demographic-, medical-, lifestyle- and fracture history. Body weight was assessed clinically, and body composition and BMD measured via dual energy absorptiometry (DXA). Data was analysed in STATA 14 using descriptive and inferential statistics. Results 101 participants were recruited, with a mean age of 61±7 years. Nearly a third (n = 32) of women at baseline fulfilled global criteria for bone protection (BMD T-score ≥-2SD (n = 18); BMD T-score -1.5SD to < -2SD with risk factors (n = 14). Lower body weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass index and lean mass index were significantly associated with the participants with a BMD measurement in keeping with a diagnosis of OP (p <0.001). Low vitamin D was present in 93% of the cohort tested (n = 95), whilst deficient vitamin D status (<20ng/ml) was documented in 52 women (55%). Conclusions In this study, a third of postmenopausal women considered for AI therapy fulfilled international criteria for bone protective pharmacological intervention. This emphasizes the need for clinical risk and BMD assessment in postmenopausal breast cancer patients at baseline. Body composition and bone health associations highlight bone fragility associated with lower body weight."

To strengthen programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis (PMDT), Taiwan MDR-TB Consortium (TMTC) was established in 2007. We assess the performance and epidemiologic impact of TMTC.We analyzed the trends of proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility testing, enrollment of MDR-TB patients into TMTC and outcomes of treatment of all MDR-TB patients in Taiwan from 2007-2016. We computed the trends of both incidence and prevalence of MDR-TB from 2007-2016. We assessed the trends of MDR-TB among both new and recurrent TB cases. The proportion of TB cases with drug susceptibility testing results increased from 24.2% in 2007 to 97.9% in 2016. Of the 1,452 MDR-TB patients who were eligible for TMTC care, 1,197 (82.4%) were enrolled in TMTC, in whom 82.9% had treatment success. MDR-TB incidence was 9.0 cases per million in 2007, which declined to 4.6 cases per million in 2016 (p<0.0001). MDR-TB prevalence decreased from 19.4 cases per million in 2007 to 8.4 cases per million in 2016 (p<0.0001). The proportion of MDR-TB among new TB cases decreased from 1.4% in 2010 to 1.0% in 2016 (p = 0.039); and that among recurrent TB cases from 9.0% in 2010 to 1.8% in 2016 (p<0.0001).We concluded that effective PMDT have had a significant impact on the epidemic of drug-resistant TB in Taiwan."
https://openalex.org/W2928608473,"Immediate and reliable pathogen detection in large numbers of samples is essential in wildlife disease monitoring and is often realized by DNA-based techniques. Pooling samples increases processing efficiency and reduces processing costs, and has been suggested as a viable technique for quantitative PCR detection of fungal amphibian pathogens of the genus Batrachochytrium. For these fungi, this diagnostic method has been validated by in vitro set ups that provided controlled test conditions but did not take into account potential effects from amphibian skin compounds (e.g. skin secretions and Microbiota) on the approach. Some of these skin compounds are known to cause PCR inhibition in single sample applications and could lead to false negative reactions and thereby hamper pathogen detection. In this study we examined the effect of skin compounds on the pooled extraction method by swabbing individuals of seven amphibian species (one Anura and six Caudata) prior to the inoculation of the swabs with chytrid zoospores. For each species, swabs were extracted in pools of different sizes (from one to four swabs) with only one swab per pool being inoculated with zoospores. There were no significant differences regarding the ability to detect zoospores when comparing pool sizes for any species, with a tendency for more false negatives when the inoculated swab had been inoculated with a single zoospore. This study provides further in vivo evidence for the viability of the pooled extraction method for DNA-based detection of pathogens."
