https://openalex.org/W2064952846,"To examine the in vivo function of presenilin-1 (PS1), we selectively deleted the PS1 gene in excitatory neurons of the adult mouse forebrain. These conditional knockout mice were viable and grew normally, but they exhibited a pronounced deficiency in enrichment-induced neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus. This reduction in neurogenesis did not result in appreciable learning deficits, indicating that addition of new neurons is not required for memory formation. However, our postlearning enrichment experiments lead us to postulate that adult dentate neurogenesis may play a role in the periodic clearance of outdated hippocampal memory traces after cortical memory consolidation, thereby ensuring that the hippocampus is continuously available to process new memories. A chronic, abnormal clearance process in the hippocampus may conceivably lead to memory disorders in the mammalian brain."

https://openalex.org/W1980386941,"A region of the ape brain is uncannily similar to one linked with speech in humans. Brodmann's area 44 delineates part of Broca's area within the inferior frontal gyrus of the human brain and is a critical region for speech production1,2, being larger in the left hemisphere than in the right1,2,3,4 — an asymmetry that has been correlated with language dominance2,3. Here we show that there is a similar asymmetry in this area, also with left-hemisphere dominance, in three great ape species (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus and Gorilla gorilla). Our findings suggest that the neuroanatomical substrates for left-hemisphere dominance in speech production were evident at least five million years ago and are not unique to hominid evolution."
https://openalex.org/W1989875198,"The target-derived neurotrophic factor ""nerve growth factor"" (NGF) signals through TrkA to promote the survival, differentiation, and maintenance of neurons. How the NGF signal in axon terminals is conveyed to the cell body is unknown. The ""signaling endosome hypothesis"" envisions that NGF-TrkA complexes are internalized at the axon terminal and retrogradely transported to the cell body. Following NGF treatment, we found that clathrin-coated vesicles contained NGF bound to TrkA together with activated signaling proteins of the Ras-MAP kinase pathway. Evidence that these vesicles could signal was their ability in vitro to activate Elk, a downstream target of Erk1/2. Our results point to the existence of a population of signaling endosomes derived from clathrin-coated membranes in NGF-treated cells."

https://openalex.org/W2114933644,"The flow of activity in the cortical microcircuitry is poorly understood. We use calcium imaging to reconstruct, with millisecond and single-cell resolution, the spontaneous activity of populations of neurons in unstimulated slices from mouse visual cortex. We find spontaneous activity correlated among networks of layer 5 pyramidal cells. Synchronous ensembles occupy overlapping territories, often share neurons, and are repeatedly activated. Sets of neurons are also sequentially activated numerous times. Network synchronization and sequential correlations are blocked by glutamatergic antagonists, even though spontaneous firing persists in many ""autonomously active"" neurons. This autonomous activity is periodic and depends on hyperpolarization-activated cationic (H) and persistent sodium (Na(p)) currents. We conclude that the isolated neocortical microcircuit generates spontaneous activity, mediated by a combination of intrinsic and circuit mechanisms, and that this activity can be temporally precise."
https://openalex.org/W3102895663,"The X-ray source known as GRS1915+105 belongs to a group dubbed 'microquasars'. These objects are binary systems which sporadically eject matter at speeds that appear superluminal, as is the case for some quasars. GRS1915+105 is also one of only two known binary sources thought to contain a maximally spinning black hole. Determining the basic parameters of GRS195+105, such as the masses of the components, will help us to understand jet formation in this system, as well as providing links to other objects which exhibit jets. Using X-ray data, indirect methods have previously been used to infer a variety of masses for the accreting compact object in the range 10-30 solar masses (M middle dot in circle). Here we report a direct measurement of the orbital period and mass function of GRS1915+105, which allow us to deduce a mass of 14 +/- 4 M middle dot in circle for the black hole. Black holes with masses >5-7 M middle dot in circle challenge the conventional picture of black-hole formation in binary systems. Based on the mass estimate, we interpret the distinct X-ray variability of GRS1915+105 as arising from instabilities in an accretion disk that is dominated by radiation pressure, and radiating near the Eddington limit (the point where radiation pressure supports matter against gravity). Also, the mass estimate constrains most models which relate observable X-ray properties to the spin of black holes in microquasars."
https://openalex.org/W2132082381,"Huntingtin is a protein of unknown function that contains a polyglutamine tract, which is expanded in patients with Huntington's disease (HD). We investigated the localization and a potential function for huntingtin in the nucleus. In human fibroblasts from normal and HD patients, huntingtin localized diffusely in the nucleus and in subnuclear compartments identified as speckles, promyelocytic leukemia protein bodies, and nucleoli. Huntingtin-positive nuclear bodies redistributed after treatment with sodium butyrate. By Western blot, purified nuclei had low levels of full-length huntingtin compared with the cytoplasm but contained high levels of N- and C-terminal huntingtin fragments, which tightly bound the nuclear matrix. Full-length huntingtin co-immunoprecipitated with the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein, and polyglutamine expansion in huntingtin reduced this interaction. Full-length wild-type and mutant huntingtin repressed transcription when targeted to DNA. Truncated N-terminal mutant huntingtin repressed transcription, whereas the corresponding wild-type fragment did not repress transcription. We speculate that wild-type huntingtin may function in the nucleus in the assembly of nuclear matrix-bound protein complexes involved with transcriptional repression and RNA processing. Proteolysis of mutant huntingtin may alter nuclear functions by disrupting protein complexes and inappropriately repressing transcription in HD.

Full-length huntingtin contains candidate binding sites for other proteins with nuclear functions. Huntingtin contains a PXDLS motif, a candidate-binding site for the transcriptional corepressor C-terminal binding protein (CtBP) (12Schaeper U. Boyd J.M. Verma S. Uhlmann E. Subramanian T.

Mutant huntingtin has been implicated in abnormal transcriptional repression in HD. In the HD brain and in HD mice expressing exon 1 of mutant huntingtin, there are marked reductions of mRNAs encoding neurotransmitter receptors (21Cha J.-H Kosinski C.M. Kerner J.A. Alsdorf S.A.

These results suggest that the N terminus of mutant huntingtin may disrupt neuronal function in HD by interfering with nuclear organization and transcriptional regulation. Recent studies have not addressed the ability of full-length normal huntingtin to repress transcription or the ability of larger N-terminal fragments of mutant huntingtin to repress transcription through a mechanism that directs huntingtin to DNA. We investigated the localization of huntingtin in the nucleus using immunohistochemical and biochemical methods. We also tested the hypothesis that full-length wild-type huntingtin interacts with CtBP. Finally, we assessed normal and mutant huntingtin's ability to repress transcription and the potential effects of huntingtin truncation on this function. Human fibroblasts were obtained from the Coriell Cell Repository (Camden, NJ) (normal, repository number GM08399A; homozygous for HD gene, repository number GM04857) and cultured according to the repository's recommended conditions. Clonal striatal cells, C33A cells, and MFC-7 cells were cultured as previously described (14Meloni A.R. Smith E.J. Nevins J.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

All cells were maintained with 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Four polyclonal anti-huntingtin antisera have been characterized in previous publications (2DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K. Schwarz C. Meloni A. Young C.

Another polyclonal antibody, Ab1173, made to aa 1173–1196 of huntingtin, recognizes full-length huntingtin in protein extracts from brain (results not shown). Monoclonal antibodies mAb2170 and mAb2168 made to aa 1247–1645 and aa 2146–2541 of huntingtin, respectively, were obtained from Chemicon (Temecula, CA). The monoclonal antibody mAb1574, which specifically recognizes expanded polyglutamine stretches, was also obtained from Chemicon. Polyclonal anti-CtBP was made against a synthetic peptide containing the N-terminal 20 amino acids of CtBP. An N-terminal lysine residue was added for coupling to KLH. The antibody was purified against the synthetic peptide bound to bovine serum albumin.

Immunofluorescence labeling of cultured cells was performed as previously described (29Kegel K.B. Kim M. Sapp E. McIntyre C. Castano J.G. Aronin N. DiFiglia M. J. Neurosci. 2000; 20: 7268-7278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were washed in PBS, fixed for 10 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS containing calcium and magnesium ions, washed three times, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 30 min, and then blocked with 4% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Alternatively, cells were fixed in ice-cold methanol for 1 min, followed by permeabilization and blocking steps. Fixed cells were then incubated overnight in primary antibodies at 4 °C, washed with PBS, incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature, washed again, and then dehydrated stepwise and mounted in Cytoseal (Stephens Scientific, Riverdale, NJ). Individual images for each excitation wavelength (488 or 568 nm) were obtained using a Bio-Rad 1024 laser confocal microscope through a ×100 objective with oil immersion and merged in Adobe Photoshop (Salinas, CA). Propidium iodide (Molecular Probes) was added with the secondary antibody at 1 μg/ml. Immunoperoxidase labeling of mouse brain sections was performed as previously described (17Sewalt R.G.A.B.

Plates were scraped, and crude homogenates (T) were collected and then centrifuged at 2000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min to obtain a low speed supernatant containing cytoplasmic constituents and a crude nuclear pellet. The crude nuclear pellet was washed twice with 1 ml of lysis buffer, and nuclei were reisolated by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in 25% iodixanol in lysis buffer (Optiprep; Accurate Chemicals, Westbury, NY) and layered on a discontinuous iodixanol gradient (30 and 35%) and centrifuged in a SW41 swing bucket rotor at 10,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Nuclei were collected from the 30–35% interface. All fractions were stored on ice for the duration of the experiment before storing at −70 °C. Total protein was estimated using the Bradford method. Fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis performed as previously described (2DiFiglia M. Sapp E. Chase K. Schwarz C. Meloni A. Young C. Martin E. Vonsattel J.P. Carraway R.

Antibody dilutions for Western blotting are as follows: Ab1, 0.5 μg/ml; calnexin, 1:1000; anti-β tubulin, 1:1000; panhistone, 5 μg/ml. Nuclear matrices were prepared as described by Nickerson et al.

Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar). For immunocytochemistry, cells were washed two times in PBS with Ca2+/Mg2+ and then incubated sequentially with cytoskeletal buffer (CSK) (0.5% Triton X-100, 10 mm PIPES, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, pH 6.8), extraction buffer (CSK buffer with 250 mm ammonium sulfate, no NaCl), digestion buffer (CSK buffer containing DNase I (400 units/ml, RNase-free; Roche Molecular Biochemicals), 50 mm NaCl), and high salt buffer (CSK buffer with 2 m NaCl). Cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde after extractions were complete. All buffers contained RNasin inhibitor (Promega) with 1 mm dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. For biochemical analysis, nuclei were isolated as described above, and equal volumes of nuclei were suspended sequentially in 1 ml of PIPES buffer without Triton X-100, followed by CSK buffer, extraction buffer, digestion buffer, and high salt buffer. After each extraction, nuclei were collected by centrifugation at 2000 × g and then resuspended in 1 ml of the next buffer or in 100 μl of 2× SDS-PAGE sample buffer. cDNAs for full-length FLAG-tagged huntingtin encoding 18 or 100 glutamines and designated FH9774 were subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 and have been described previously (27Kim M.

The insert cDNAs encoding base pairs 314–3210 of the HD gene with 18, 46, or 100 CAG repeats were ligated into pcDNA3-Gal4DBD restricted with BamHI andApaI, creating pGal4-H3221-18, -46, and -100. To create pGal4-H6343-18 and -46, an NsiI toNotI restriction fragment representing base pairs 3210–6343 of the HD cDNA was ligated into the pGal4-H3221 vectors restricted with NsiI and NotI. Gal4-H6343 constructs bearing larger glutamine expansions were unstable in bacteria. The Gal4-H9763 full-length constructs were made by ligating a KpnI to NotI restriction fragment, representing base pairs 2078–9763 of the HD cDNA, into the pGal4-H3221-18, -46, and -100 vectors restricted with KpnI and NotI. To create the pGal4-PLDLS construct, a PCR product was generated using primers within the HD gene (5′-ATTGGATCCGCCTGAAACTTCTCATGCA-3′ and 5′-TAGCTGCG-3′ primer sequences; Invitrogen) and full-length huntingtin cDNA as template. The PCR fragment was gel-isolated, restricted with BamHI and ApaI, and ligated into pcDNA3-Gal4DBD restricted with BamHI andApaI. The construct was verified by sequencing. Plasmid DNA was prepared using Qiagen EndoFree Plasmid Maxi Kit for all applications (Valencia, CA). COS-1 cells grown in 60-mm plates and exposed to transfection reagents but no DNA (mock) or transfected with 5 μg of each plasmid alone (pcDNA3, pFH9774-18, pFH9774-100, pcDNA-Gal4DBD, and pcDNA-Gal4-CtBP) or 2.5 μg of two plasmids together. Transfections were performed using 30 μl of Superfect reagent (Qiagen). Twenty hours after transfection, cells were washed in PBS and lysed into 0.5 ml of IP buffer containing 50 mmTris, 1% Nonidet P-40, 250 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, pH 7.4. Lysates were collected and centrifuged at 10,000 ×g for 10 min at 4 °C to remove insoluble material. One-tenth volume of each supernatant was saved as “total lysate.” The remaining supernatant was incubated with 1.2 μg of Gal4DBD monoclonal antibody for 2 h on ice. 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) slurry in IP buffer (50 mg/ml) was added to each tube and incubated for another 1 h at 4 °C. The entire complex was collected by centrifugation at 10,000 × g, and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was washed four times in IP buffer. Proteins were eluted by the addition of 50 μl of SDS sample buffer containing dithiothreitol and boiled for 5 min. Input lysates and precipitates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot using standard methods, and detection was performed with ECL (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). A similar experiment using M2 Affi-Gel (Sigma) was performed to precipitate the FLAG-tagged huntingtin using the same buffer but omitting protein A-Sepharose. Coprecipitated Gal4-CtBP was detected by Western blot using the polyclonal anti-CtBP antibody and a peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit secondary antibody that was preasdorbed against mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories). For each of four experiments, the average intensities of both full-length huntingtin and the 300-kDa huntingtin-derived fragment were standardized to the average intensities of the Gal4-CtBP immunoprecipitated. The ratio of coprecipitated wild-type huntingtin to mutant huntingtin was calculated for each experiment, and the statistical difference from 1.0 was determined using a one-samplet test (Wilcoxon signed rank test). C33A cells plated in 60-mm dishes were transfected with 40 μl of Polyfect reagent (Qiagen). pTK/luciferase (0.5 μg; a reporter construct containing the herpesvirus thymidine kinase promoter and five Gal4 sites preceding the firefly luciferase gene) was cotransfected with 0.2 μg of pCMV-β-galactosidase to control for transfection efficiency and 2.8 μg of plasmids encoding Gal4DBD or Gal4DBD fused to huntingtin, CtIP, or CtBP cDNAs. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were scraped in 250 μl of Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega), and luciferase activity was measured using the Luciferase Assay System (Promega) and a microplate luminometer with an autoinjection device (LB 99V; EG & G Berthold). Western blot analysis confirmed that similar levels of Gal4 fusion proteins were expressed among transfections. Cells cotransfected with Gal4 fusion constructs were expressed as a percentage of luciferase activity measured in cells cotransfected with pcDNA-Gal4DBD. Huntingtin localization was examined in normal human fibroblasts with a panel of polyclonal antibodies (Ab1, Ab585, Ab1173, Ab2527, and Ab2911) and monoclonal antibodies (mAb2170 and mAb2168) that recognize different regions of huntingtin (Fig. 1 a). Fixation of cells with paraformaldehyde or methanol revealed different compartments of huntingtin labeling in nuclei. In cells fixed with paraformaldehyde, diffuse labeling was seen throughout the nucleus with most anti-huntingtin antisera and was strongest with Ab585 and Ab2527 (Fig. 1 b). Ab2527 also produced areas of more intense labeling that appeared as patches against the background of diffuse staining. Methanol fixation reduced or eliminated the diffuse staining and revealed numerous intensely labeled nuclear dots and patches with all of the antisera except Ab2911, which showed no staining with methanol fixation. Small dots and patches were more apparent with Ab1, Ab585, Ab1173, and mAb2170, whereas larger patches of intense labeling were seen with Ab2527. Ab2527 produced similar diffuse and patchy labeling in HD fibroblasts as in control fibroblasts (Fig.1 c). The nuclear staining observed with anti-huntingtin polyclonal antisera was blocked in the presence of the antigenic peptide but not unrelated peptide (data not shown). Huntingtin immunoreactivity also was present in the nuclei of clonal striatal cells fixed with paraformaldehyde or methanol. When cells were grown under basal conditions, Ab1 and Ab2527 antisera detected diffuse nuclear labeling and small dots (Ab1) and large patches (Ab2527) (Fig.2 a). In normal mouse brain, cortical and striatal neurons also showed diffuse and patchy nuclear labeling with Ab2527 using the immunoperoxidase method (Fig.2 b). To identify the nuclear subdomains that contain huntingtin, we examined the co-distribution of huntingtin in fibroblasts with proteins found in the nucleolus, nuclear speckles, and PML bodies. Nucleolin was used to mark the nucleolus (32Lischwe M.A. Richards R.L. Busch R.K. Busch H. Exp. Cell Res. 1981; 136: 101-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar, 33Dickenson L.A. Kohwi-Shigematsu T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 456-465Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar); snRNP and SC-35 labeling was used to identify speckles (34Nyman U. Hallman H. Hadlaczky G. Pettersson I. Sharp G. Ringertz N.R. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 137-144Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 35Kastner B. Kornstadt U. Bach M. Luhrmann R. J.

Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2288-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar); and PML localization was used to recognize PML bodies (37Dyck J.A. Maul G.G. Miller W.H. Chen J.D. Kakizuka A. Evans R.M. Cell. 1994; 76: 333-343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (723) Google Scholar). The overlap between huntingtin and marker proteins was variable between cells within the same culture dish. Huntingtin labeling was clearly detected within the boundaries of the nucleolus (Fig. 3 a). Huntingtin antiserum Ab2527 stained the nucleolus in 100% of the cells using methanol fixation. Huntingtin was frequently found in speckles and less frequently found in PML bodies (Fig. 3, b–d). Huntingtin co-distributed with 10–50% of the patches labeled for snRNP, 10–80% of the nuclear regions containing SC-35, and 0–30% of the PML bodies, depending on the cell. Using propidium iodide to visualize DNA, we found that huntingtin was located mainly in the interchromatin space and had few sites of interface with DNA throughout the nucleoplasm (Fig. 3 e). To determine whether the localization of huntingtin in the nucleus could be modulated, we treated clonal striatal cells with sodium butyrate, which differentiates cells and can alter transcriptional activity through the inhibition of histone deacetylase (38Walia H.

Sodium butyrate treatment increased the staining of the large patches detected with Ab2527 (Fig. 2 c).

https://openalex.org/W1967760715,"Morphine is unusual in its failure to promote robust desensitization and endocytosis of the mu opioid receptor (MOR), processes that for many receptors contribute directly to tolerance. This apparent paradox has led us to revise the idea that receptor desensitization and endocytosis are solely responsible for tolerance and withdrawal to morphine, and instead test the hypothesis that these side effects occur due to abnormally prolonged MOR signaling. We report here that MOR mutations that facilitate endocytosis reduce the development of cellular tolerance and cAMP superactivation, a cellular hallmark of withdrawal. Moreover, mutant receptors with reduced endocytosis produce exacerbated superactivation. These data demonstrate a critical role for receptor endocytosis in the development of adverse side effects associated with prolonged opiate use."

A bacterial mutant, KAM3, is deficient in multidrug resistance and does not survive on medium containing norfloxacin. After transformation of KAM3 cells with an Arabidopsis cDNA library, transformants were selected for restored growth on the toxic medium. One cDNA clone that complemented KAM3 encodes a novel protein with twelve putative transmembrane domains and contains limited sequence homology to a multidrug and toxin efflux carrier from bacteria. We named this Arabidopsis protein AtDTX1 (forArabidopsis thaliana Detoxification 1). A large gene family of at least 56 members encoding related proteins was identified from the Arabidopsis genome. Further functional analysis of AtDTX1 protein in KAM3 mutant demonstrated that AtDTX1 serves as an efflux carrier for plant-derived alkaloids, antibiotics, and other toxic compounds. Interestingly, AtDTX1 was also capable of detoxifying Cd2+, a heavy metal. Further experiments suggest that AtDTX1 is localized in the plasma membrane in plant cells thereby mediating the efflux of plant-derived or exogenous toxic compounds from the cytoplasm.

Plants, as well as other organisms, synthesize and accumulate a diverse array of natural products, which can serve many functions, including defense against or attraction to various insects and microbes in its environment. On the other hand, plants are also exposed to exogenous toxins, including agrochemicals (e.g. pesticides) and toxic compounds secreted by other plants or pathogenic microbes. Disposal and detoxification of toxic compounds of both endogenous and exogenous origin are important processes for plant survival and development. Several possible mechanisms of detoxification include modification of toxic compounds by endogenous enzymes (1Dixon D.P. Cummins I. Cole D.J. Edwards R. Curr. Opin. Plant Biol. 1998; 1: 258-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), sequestration into vacuole (2Yelin R. Rotem D. Schuldiner S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 949-956Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Liu G. Sanchez-Fernandez R., Li, Z.-S. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8648-8656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), and transport outside of the cell (4Putman M. Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 672-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 5Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). A large number of transport proteins that mediate the efflux of a broad range of compounds have been identified from various bacteria (6Brown M.H. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 394-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Four families of detoxifying efflux transporters have previously been described that include major facilitator superfamily (MFS 1The abbreviations used are:MFSmajor facilitator superfamilySMRsmall multidrug resistance familyRNDresistance/nodulation/cell division familyABCATP-binding cassette familyTMDtransmembrane domainMATEmultidrug and toxic compound extrusion familyMRPmultidrug resistance proteinMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acidMICminimal inhibitory concentrationsGFPgreen fluorescence proteinCCCPcarbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazoneAcrABacriflavine resistance protein AB ), the small multidrug resistance (SMR) family, the resistance/nodulation/cell division (RND) family, and the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily. The MFS, SMR, and RND families are secondary transporters, typically energized by the proton-motive force. In contrast, ATP is utilized as the energy donor for members of the ABC family of multidrug efflux pumps that are often considered primary transporters (4Putman M. Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 672-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar, 6Brown M.H. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 394-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). To date, ABC family of multidrug efflux pumps have been identified in organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, animals, and plants. The SMR and RND are only found in bacteria (4Putman M. Veen H.W. Konings W.N. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 2000; 64: 672-693Crossref PubMed Scopus (643) Google Scholar). Perhaps the most diverse of all is the MFS type of transporters, which have 12–14 transmembrane domains (TMDs) and are involved in the symport, antiport, or uniport of various substrates, such as sugars, Krebs cycle intermediates, phosphate esters, oligosaccharides, and antibiotics (7Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). More recent studies have identified two new multidrug efflux proteins, NorM from Vibrio parahaemolyticus and a homologue in Escherichia coli, YdhE (8Morita Y. Kodama K. Shiota S. Mine T. Kataoka A. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1778-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both transporters are required for the efflux of a broad range of toxic compounds. NorM requires Na+ for their activity, suggesting that these new systems are Na+/toxin antiporters (9Morita Y. Kataoka A. Shiota S. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6694-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The NorM homologues contain 12 predicted transmembrane domains and therefore are grouped into the MFS family. However, these proteins share no sequence similarity with any member of the MFS and do not exhibit any of the signature sequences specific to the 18 MFS families identified by Pao et al. (7Pao S.S. Paulsen I.T. Saier M.H. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1998; 62: 1-34Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). NorM and YdhE are therefore defined as a new family of secondary transporters, which was referred to as the MATE (multidrug and toxic compound extrusion) family (6Brown M.H. Paulsen I.T. Skurray R.A. Mol. Microbiol. 1999; 31: 394-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). major facilitator superfamily small multidrug resistance family resistance/nodulation/cell division family ATP-binding cassette family transmembrane domain multidrug and toxic compound extrusion family multidrug resistance protein 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid minimal inhibitory concentrations green fluorescence protein carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone acriflavine resistance protein AB Although extrusion of toxic compounds by efflux transporters is the major route for detoxification in bacteria, most plant cells possess large vacuoles that can serve as a disposal compartment for toxic compounds. Indeed, at least one member of the plant ABC family, AtMRP1, has been shown to transport glutathione conjugates into vacuoles (10Lu Y.-P., Li, Z.-S. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8243-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar), providing a molecular basis for detoxification by vacuole sequestration in plant cells. Further studies identified a large family of ABC-type proteins from Arabidopsis referred to as AtMRPs (multidrug resistance protein) (3Liu G. Sanchez-Fernandez R., Li, Z.-S. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8648-8656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). At least 60 genes in theArabidopsis genome are identified to encode MRP-like proteins (3Liu G. Sanchez-Fernandez R., Li, Z.-S. Rea P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8648-8656Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 11Davies T.G.E. Coleman J.O.D. Plant Cell Environ. 2000; 23: 431-443Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is speculated that these gene products are localized to various cell membranes and may play different roles in plant cells. For example, a plasma membrane protein, AtPGP1, is highly homologous to animal multidrug resistance protein and is involved in light-dependent hypocotyl elongation (12Sidler M. Hassa P. Hasan S. Ringli C. Dudler R. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1623-1636Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). A plastid ABC protein is involved in the plastid-nucleus communication mechanism (13Moller S.G. Kunkel T. Chua N.-H. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 90-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar). Although all these ABC-related proteins are presumed to play a role in membrane transport, the transport function of AtPGP1 and the plastid ABC protein has yet to be identified. Concerning detoxification by a possible efflux mechanism, none of the plant proteins have been shown to function as an efflux carrier for multidrug transport. Using a functional cloning strategy, this study identified a MATE-related efflux protein from Arabidopsis (AtDTX1). Transport assays have demonstrated that AtDTX1 protein functions as an efflux transporter that detoxifies a number of lipophilic cations and cadmium, a heavy metal. We also provide evidence that AtDTX1 is localized in the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis plants. E. coli mutant strain KAM3 harbors a deletion in the chromosomal AcrAB genes of TG1 strain and was sensitive to many drugs that are known as substrates of the AcrAB system (14Okusu H., Ma, D. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). This mutant strain does not grow on medium containing 0.05 μg/ml norfloxacin (8Morita Y. Kodama K. Shiota S. Mine T. Kataoka A. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1778-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We expressed an ArabidopsiscDNA library CD4–7 (Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center, Columbia, OH) in the KAM3 mutant and selected transformants on the norfloxacin-containing medium. The cDNA clones that supported growth of KAM3 mutant on the toxic medium were sequenced and subcloned into pTrc99A vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). We focused on one cDNA, AtDTX1, for further analyses. The cDNA sequence of AtDTX1 encodes the same protein as annotated under the accession numberAAD28687 in the Arabidopsis genomic sequence data base (available at www.mips.biochem.mpg.de/proj/thal/). For confirmation of complementation, AtDTX1 cDNA was constructed into pTrc99A vector and transformed into KAM3 cells by electroporation. Transformants were selected on the LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Individual transformants were grown in LB liquid medium containing the same concentration of antibiotics and 1 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for induction of AtDTX1 expression. The cultures were adjusted to 1.0A 600, diluted to 10-fold gradient series, and spotted (2 μl) onto LB solid medium supplemented with 0.05 μg/ml norfloxacin or different concentrations of heavy metal or antibiotics. The growth of different strains was scored after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h. The KAM3 mutant transformed with pTrc99A was used as a control. Assay of norfloxacin and ethidium bromide accumulation was performed as described previously (8Morita Y. Kodama K. Shiota S. Mine T. Kataoka A. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 1778-1782Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Morita Y. Kataoka A. Shiota S. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6694-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli KAM3 containing pTrc99A empty vector or pTrc99A-AtDTX1 were grown in the LB broth supplemented with 40 mm potassium lactate to the late, exponential phase of growth under aerobic condition at 37 °C, harvested, and washed with 0.2 m MOPS-Tris buffer (pH7.0) containing 10 mmMgSO4, and suspended in the same buffer to 50 mg (wet weight)/ml. The assay mixture contained cells (10 mg (wet weight)/ml) in the same buffer and 10 mm potassium lactate. After incubation at 37 °C for 5 min, norfloxacin (100 μm, final concentration) was added to initiate the assay. Samples (1 ml each) were taken at intervals, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 30 s at 4 °C, and washed once with the same buffer. After 15 min of initiating, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) was added to the assay mixture at 100 μm to disrupt the proton gradient across the membrane. The pellet was suspended in 1 ml of 100 mm glycine-HCl (pH 3.0). The suspension was shaken vigorously for 1 h at room temperature to release their fluorescent contents and then centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at room temperature. The fluorescence of supernatants was measured (excitation at 277 nm and emission at 448 nm) with a Hitachi F-4500 fluorescence spectrophotometer. The amount of fluorescence was normalized against total protein concentration that was measured by using the Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit (15Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar). Cells used in ethidium bromide accumulation assay were prepared similarly as described above. After cells were washed and suspended in 0.1 m Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) to A 600 of 2.0 and placed in the fluorometer cuvette with 1:10 dilution in the same buffer. Ethidium bromide was added at 20 μg/ml to the cell suspension to initiate the assay. Samples (1 ml each) were taken at different time points. CCCP was added at 100 μm at the 15-min time point. The fluorescence of the sample mixture was measured with excitation and emission wavelength of 500 and 580, respectively (16Bolhuis H. Molenaar D. Poelarends G. Van Veen H.W. Poolman B. Driessen A.J.M. Konings W.N. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 6957-6964Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because ethidium bromide fluorescence results from binding to intracellular components, especially to nucleic acids, the increase in fluorescence intensity reflected the accumulation of the dye in the cell (17Neyfakh A.A. Bidnenko V.E. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). The amount of maximum fluorescence was normalized to 100%. For determining ethidium bromide efflux, cells from an overnight culture (5 ml,A 600 = 2) were pelleted and washed twice with 100 mm MOPS-Tris (pH 7.0), 2 mmMgSO4 buffer. To load cells with ethidium bromide, the cells were incubated in the same buffer supplemented with 10 μg/ml ethidium bromide and 20 μm CCCP by incubation at 37 °C for 30 min as previously described (9Morita Y. Kataoka A. Shiota S. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6694-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar, 17Neyfakh A.A. Bidnenko V.E. Chen L.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4781-4785Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). Cells were pelleted, washed twice, and resuspended at the same ice-cold buffer (A 600 = 4.0). Suspension was placed into a fluorometer cuvette and diluted 100-fold with solutions indicated in each figure legend. Because only nucleic acid-bound ethidium bromide gives significant fluorescence, efflux of ethidium bromide from the cells was determined as a decrease in fluorescence. Measurement of berberine efflux was performed by a similar procedure with excitation at 355 nm and emission at 517 nm. The concentration of berberine for cell loading was 30 μg/ml (18Stermitz F.R. Lorenz P. Tawara J.N. Zenewicz L.A. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1433-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar). Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of heavy metals and drugs were determined by culturing cells in the LB broth containing a particular heavy metal or drug at various concentrations (18Stermitz F.R. Lorenz P. Tawara J.N. Zenewicz L.A. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1433-1437Crossref PubMed Scopus (625) Google Scholar, 19Mata M.T. Baquero F. Perez-Diaz J.C. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 2000; 187: 185-188Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Aliquots of the culture were taken at different time points to measure the growth rates that were used to make a growth curve as indicated in figure legends. Total RNA was isolated fromArabidopsis seedlings by using the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY). 10 μg of total RNA was separated on denaturing 1.2% formaldehyde-agarose gel, transferred to a Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.), and hybridized with probes that were made from full-length AtDTX1 cDNA by random priming (20Gupta R. Huang Y. Kieber J. Luan S. Plant J. 1998; 16: 581-589Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of AtDTX1 protein was addressed by GFP fusion and confocal microscopy. The coding region of AtDXT1 was fused to GFP coding region in binary vector pMD1 that contains the cytomegalovirus35S promoter followed by a short polylinker, GFP-coding region, and the nopaline opine synthase terminator region (21Sheen J. Hwang S. Niwa Y. Kobayashi H. Galbraith D.W. Plant J. 1995; 8: 777-784Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). The AtDTX1 cDNA without a stop codon was inserted into the polylinker region to form an in-frame fusion with the GFP-coding region. This construct was used to transform wild typeArabidopsis plants (Columbia ecotype) by floral dip method (22Clough S.J. Bent A.F. Plant J. 1998; 16: 735-743Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Transformants were selected on 0.5× Murashige-Skoog medium containing 1% (w/v) sucrose, 0.8% (w/v) agar, and 60 μg/ml kanamycin and were propagated in the soil. T2 seedlings were used to localize GFP fluorescence by a confocal microscope (Zeiss 510 UV-visible). The images were processed by Adobe PhotoShop. We designed a functional cloning strategy to identify putative multidrug efflux carriers from Arabidopsis. An E. colimutant strain, KAM3, lacks AcrAB systems that are multidrug efflux carriers required for multidrug resistance (14Okusu H., Ma, D. Nikaido H. J. Bacteriol. 1996; 178: 306-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). As a result, KAM3 cells do not grow on medium containing 0.05 μg/ml norfloxacin, a substrate of AcrAB efflux systems. We transformed KAM3 by an expression cDNA library of Arabidopsis plants and isolated those cDNA clones that restored the growth of KAM3 mutant on the medium supplemented with norfloxacin. Among the sequenced cDNA clones, one showed limited homology to the MATE family efflux transporters in bacteria. We referred to this cDNA clone as AtDTX1. Others encoded proteins without significant similarity to any known proteins in the data base (data not shown). This study focused on the functional characterization of AtDTX1. To confirm that AtDTX1 cDNA indeed complemented KAM3 mutant, we measured AtDTX1-mediated drug resistance with the KAM3 strain as a negative control. As shown in Fig.1, KAM3 containing empty pTrc99A vector did not grow on medium containing 0.05 μg/ml norfloxacin and 100 μg/ml ampicillin. In contrast, KAM3 transformed with pTrc99A-AtDTX1 grew well. Both strains grew normally on LB medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. This result shows that AtDTX1 protein is capable of detoxifying norfloxacin. A search for sequences with homology to the AtDTX1 gene led to the identification of a large family of genes in theArabidopsis genome. At least 56 distinct genes were identified that encode proteins with significant sequence similarity toAtDTX1. We refer to these genes as AtDTX1 toAtDTX56. Phylogenetic analysis of this family revealed that members can be further divided into at least five clusters or subfamilies (Fig. 2 A). The first cluster includes AtDTX1 through AtDTX19, the second cluster includes AtDTX20 through AtDTX41, and the third cluster includes AtDTX42 through AtDTX49. The fourth cluster may include AtDTX50 through AtDTX55. The fifth group contains only AtDTX56. The putative proteins in this family range in size from 414 to 539 residues, and hydropathy analyses revealed that they all possess 12 putative transmembrane domains (TMD) except for the third cluster of genes, which encode proteins with 8–13 TMDs. Sequence alignments among the genes in different clusters indicated that the most conserved sequences are CGQA located between TMD2 and 3, and RVSNXLGA located in TMD8 (Fig. 2 B). Concerning the location of AtDTXgenes in the Arabidopsis genome, 21 members are located on chromosome 1; 10 members on chromosome 2; 7 members on chromosome 3; 9 members on chromosome 4; and 9 members on chromosome 5. TheArabidopsis genome initiative numbers showed their chromosome location as listed in Fig. 2 A. Some of these genes are present as tandem arrangements on the chromosomes. The genes in the same tandem array often show higher homology and are grouped in the same cluster/subfamily, suggesting that they may be derived from gene duplication.Figure 2Sequence analyses of AtDTX1and related genes in the Arabidopsis genome. A, phylogenetic tree showing the relationship of AtDTX1 and other members in the AtDTX superfamily. The five clusters are indicated and numbered.

See A for interpretation.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) AtDTX1 also showed limited homology to several genes in other organisms, including NorM, YdhE, and DinF from bacteria, and ERC1 from yeast (Fig. 2 C). As discussed earlier, NorM and YdhE are MATE family multidrug extrusion transporters. It is not known whether DinF protein functions as an efflux transporter in bacteria (23Thomas D. Surdin-Kerjan Y. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1997; 61: 503-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (544) Google Scholar). Its expression has been shown to be induced by DNA damage (24Thoms B. Wackenagel W. J. Bacteriol. 1987; 169: 1731-1736Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar).ERC1 confers ethionine resistance in yeast, although a direct transport function of ERC1 protein has not been addressed (25Shiomi N. Fukuda H. Morikawa H. Fukuda Y. Kimura A. Appl. Microbiol. Biotech. 1988; 29: 302-304Google Scholar). The phylogenetic relationship of AtDTX1 and these MATE-related proteins is presented in Fig. 2 D. According to this phylogeny “tree,” AtDTX1 shares the highest similarity with NorM gene and its homologues. AtDTX1 gene expression appeared to be ubiquitous. As shown in Fig. 3, AtDTX1 RNA was detected in all organs examined. Its mRNA accumulated in flowers and stems at higher levels as compared with those in leaves and roots. AtDTX1 complemented norfloxacin-sensitive mutant of E. coli and showed sequence similarity to MATE efflux transporters from bacteria, suggesting that AtDTX1 may function as a norfloxacin transport protein. To further determine the functional properties of AtDTX1, we measured norfloxacin accumulation in the KAM3 mutant cells and cells expressing AtDTX1. If AtDTX1 serves as an efflux carrier, it is expected that KAM3 cells expressing AtDTX1 would accumulate less norfloxacin. As shown in Fig.4 A, a high level of norfloxacin accumulation was observed with the mutant cells harboring the empty vector pTrc99A (KAM3-pTrc99A). In contrast, KAM3 transformed by a plasmid expressing AtDTX1 showed much lower levels of norfloxacin accumulation. This result suggests that AtDTX1 is capable of reducing the net accumulation of the drug by inhibiting norfloxacin influx or increasing efflux. Because efflux through secondary transporters often depends on the transmembrane electrochemical gradient of proton or ions (5Zgurskaya H.I. Nikaido H. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 219-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar), we measured norfloxacin accumulation in the presence of CCCP, a de-coupler of the membrane proton gradient. After addition of CCCP to the assay solution, accumulation level of norfloxacin increased dramatically in AtDTX1-expressing cells, implying that AtDTX1 function is inhibited by CCCP. This result is consistent with the possibility that AtDTX1 functions as a norfloxacin efflux transporter that requires a proton motive force. Function of AtDTX1 as a multidrug transporter was examined further by assaying accumulation of ethidium bromide, another putative substrate for MATE transporters. Fig. 4 B indicates that AtDTX1-transformed KAM3 cells accumulated much less ethidium bromide as compared with cells transformed by empty vector. After CCCP was added to the assay mixture, the fluorescence of AtDTX1 transformants was rapidly increased to the similar level in KAM3-pTrc99A cells, suggesting that ethidium bromide, like norfloxacin, was likely to be extruded from KAM3 cells by AtDTX1 protein. To further support that AtDTX1 mediates the efflux of the drugs, we performed ethidium bromide efflux assay according to a previously described procedure (10Lu Y.-P., Li, Z.-S. Rea P.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8243-8248Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 26Hsieh P.-C. Siegel S.A. Rogers B. Davis D. Lewis K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 6602-6606Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Cells were first loaded with ethidium bromide under de-energized conditions in the presence of CCCP. After removing external ethidium bromide and CCCP from the cells, potassium lactate, an energy donor, was added to the efflux buffer to initiate drug efflux process. KAM3 transformed by pTrc99A vector did not show significant efflux of ethidium bromide whereas KAM3-AtDTX1 cells displayed rapid efflux in the same buffer (Fig.5). It was recently reported that bacterial NorM protein functions as a Na+/drug antiporter (9Morita Y. Kataoka A. Shiota S. Mizushima T. Tsuchiya T. J. Bacteriol. 2000; 182: 6694-6697Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). We tested whether AtDTX1 also depends on external Na+ for drug transport. Our results showed that external sodium does not affect AtDTX1 function (data not shown). In both bacteria and higher plants, H+ is a common currency for energizing secondary transport processes (27Michelet B. Boutry M. Plant Physiol. (Rockville). 1995; 108: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). The fact that CCCP inhibited efflux process revealed a requirement for proton-motive force in AtDTX1-mediated transport. Proton-dependent transport is often regulated by external pH values. We assayed ethidium bromide efflux at various extracellular pH values (Fig. 6). From pH 4.0 to 8.0, activity of AtDTX1 increased significantly. When the external pH increased to 9.0, the efflux activity sharply decreased. The pH regulation observed with AtDTX1 is very similar to regulation of EmrE, a multidrug efflux carrier that mediates proton/drug antiport in bacteria (28Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). If an inward proton gradient is the only parameter that is altered by extracellular pH values, increasing extracellular pH values would decrease such a gradient thereby inhibiting drug efflux. Our results on AtDTX1 and from EmrE studies are exactly opposite to this prediction. Clearly, a more complicated mechanism is involved in the pH regulation of AtDTX1- or EmrE-mediated efflux. A model interpreting this pH effect has been proposed with EmrE (28Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). In particular, studies on EmrE suggest that proton and drug substrates share a common binding site in the EmrE protein. Extracellular pH not only changes the proton gradient but also regulates the charge state of the drug, the affinity of the drug and proton to the common binding site of EmrE, and membrane potential. The combination of these effects determines a net result on the regulation of EmrE-mediated drug efflux by extracellular pH (28Yerushalmi H. Schuldiner S. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 14711-14719Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). More studies are required to determine if AtDTX1 regulation by pH follows a similar model. The reversal of pH effect"

https://openalex.org/W2008283517,"AMPA receptors are thought to be a tetrameric assembly of the subunits GluR1-4. We have examined whether two coexpressed subunits (GluR1/2) combine at random to form channels, or preferentially assemble with a specific stoichiometry and spatial configuration. The subunits carried markers controlling ion permeation and desensitization, and these properties were monitored as a function of relative expression level and subunit composition. Homomeric receptors assembled stochastically while heteromeric receptors preferentially formed with a stoichiometry of two GluR1 and two GluR2 subunits, and with identical subunits positioned on opposite sides of the channel pore. This structure will predominate if GluR1 binds to GluR2 more rapidly during receptor assembly than other subunit combinations. The practical outcome of selective heteromeric assembly is a more homogenous receptor population in vivo."

In this study, we show that the NH2 terminus of laforin contains a carbohydrate binding domain that targets the phosphatase to glycogen where it is likely to function. Mutations within the CBD1 abolish the binding of laforin to glycogen, and this is likely to be the cause of some forms of progressive myoclonus epilepsy. Laforin was amplified from a human muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH) by PCR and cloned into BamHI and HindIII sites of the bacteria expression plasmid pET21a (Novagen) to produce a recombinant protein with a COOH-terminal 6-histidine tag. The cDNA of laforin was also cloned into a mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1NF (13Taylor G.S. Maehama T. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 8910-8915Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) by PCR. Fusion proteins expressed from vector pcDNA3.1NF contain an NH2-terminal M2-FLAG epitope of 8 amino acid residues. To produce a fusion protein with a COOH-terminal enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP), the cDNA sequence of laforin was excised from pET21a-Laf with NheI and HindIII and ligated to the same sites of pEGFP-N1 (CLONTECH). All site-directed mutations were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The cDNA of human glycogen synthase was amplified from the human muscle cDNA library (CLONTECH) and contained a COOH-terminal Myc epitope of 10 amino acid residues. Recombinant proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) Codonplus cells (Stratagene). The expressed proteins were purified using Ni2+-agarose (Qiagen) as described previously (14Maehama T. Taylor G.S. Slama J.T. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2000; 279: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). HEK 293 cells and COS1 cells were grown in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v), penicillin (100 units/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml), and l-glutamine (2 mm) (Invitrogen). Transfections with the cDNA constructs were carried out using FuGENE 6 (Roche Diagnostics). For in vitroexperiments, 0.5 μg of purified recombinant protein was incubated in 1 ml of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin containing 10 mg/ml glycogen (Roche Diagnostics) at 4 °C for 30 min. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 90 min, the supernatant and the pellet fractions were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-polyhistidine antibody His probe (H-15) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For in vivo experiments, HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected and after 24 h, and the cells were washed with cold PBS three times and harvested in hypotonic buffer consisting of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mm NaCl, 200 mm sucrose, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm EDTA, 1 μg/ml of aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The cells were then lysed on ice using Dounce homogenizer, and the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. After incubating at 30 °C for 30 min in the presence or absence of 5 units/ml of α-amylase (Sigma), the cell lysates were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min, and the supernatant and pellet fractions were collected and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma). 24 h after transfection, HEK 293 cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times and harvested in ice-cold lysis buffer consisting of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 μg/ml aprotinin, leupeptin, and pepstatin. The cells were lysed at 4 °C by constant agitation for 30 min, and then the cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The supernatants were subjected to binding with prewashed anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma) at 4 °C for 4 h by constant rotation (using 25 μl of resin slurry/106 cells). Then the resins were pelleted by centrifugation at 500 × g for 1 min and washed three times with 1 ml of lysis buffer without 1% Triton X-100. The resulting resins were subjected to phosphatase activity assay and Western blot analysis. The samples were analyzed on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore). The membranes were probed with appropriate first antibodies and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated second antibody. Para-nitrophenylphosphate (pNPP) assays were carried out at 30 °C as described previously (15Taylor G.S. Liu Y. Baskerville C. Charbonneau H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24054-24063Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 16Taylor G.S. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 2001; 295: 122-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), using 0.1 μg of recombinant protein. COS1 cells were transfected with cDNA constructs of laforin-EGFP fusion proteins. After 24 h, the cells were washed with ice-cold PBS three times and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. For COS1 cells co-transfected with pEGFP-Laf and pcDNA4/Myc-GS, after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were permeablized in methanol at −20 °C for 5 min. Then the cells were washed three times with PBS and blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min at room temperature, followed by incubating with mouse anti-Myc antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and Texas red anti-mouse IgG (Vector Laboratories) at room temperature for 1 h, respectively. The Myc-tagged glycogen synthase proteins were visualized as red fluorescence under fluorescence microscope, while the laforin EGFP fusion proteins were visualized as green fluorescence. We cloned the laforin cDNA from a human muscle library (CLONTECH). The sequence of the coding region was identical to that published by Ganesh et al. (10Ganesh S. Agarwala K.L. Ueda K. Akagi T.

Analysis of the protein conserved domain data base (CDD; www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/cdd.shtml) revealed that laforin contained a putative starch binding domain (CBD-4), encompassing the NH2-terminal 116 amino acids (Fig.1B). CBD-4 is found in a variety of glycosylhydrolases from bacteria and fungi (17Svensson B. Jespersen H. Sierks M.R. MacGregor E.A. Biochem. J. 1989; 264: 309-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 18Svensson B. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 141-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar, 19Sauer J. Sigurskjold B.W.

Acta. 2000; 1543: 275-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), where the function of CBD-4 is to bind polysaccharide substrates prior to cleavage. To investigate the function of the CBD of laforin, several point mutations were created at the CBD-4 invariant residues (Fig.1B) and their effects on both phosphatase activity and carbohydrate binding examined. Trp32 was mutated to Gly (W32G), since this is a mutation that is also found in Lafora disease. In addition, we mutated the invariant Lys87 to Ala (K87A) and prepared the double mutant (W32G/K87A). We expressed both wild type and mutant laforin proteins in HEK 293 cells. The expressed proteins were immunoprecipitated and the phosphatase activities determined usingpNPP. All three CBD mutant proteins, W32G, K87A and W32G/K87A, showed about 50% of the wild type phosphatase activity toward pNPP (Fig. 2A). As expected, the active site mutant (C266S) had no phosphatase activity. These results suggested that mutations in the CBD had a limited effect on protein phosphatase activity of laforin. Cells overexpressing laforin with the mutations in the CBD of laforin were then examined by subcellular fractionation. The glycogen-microsomal complexes were sedimented from cytosol by ultracentrifugation. Approximately 50% of the wild type laforin was associated with the pelleted glycogen-microsomal complexes (Fig.2B). Treatment of the glycogen-microsomal suspension with α-amylase is known to lead to digestion of the glycogen particles (20Fong N.M. Jensen T.C. Shah A.S. Parekh N.N. Saltiel A.R. Brady M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 35034-35039Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 2B, α-amylase treatment released laforin from the glycogen complexes, suggesting specific association of laforin with the intracellular glycogen complexes. The catalytically inactive phosphatase mutant (C266S) was also released upon treatment with α-amylase, indicating that phosphatase activity is not required for the glycogen association. Interestingly, the CBD mutant proteins, W32G and W32G/K87A, could not be detected in the glycogen-microsomal complexes, suggesting that they are not associated with the intracellular glycogen complexes. Only a very small fraction of K87A protein was present in the glycogen-microsomal complexes, and after α-amylase treatment all of the K87A protein was released into the cytosol. These results indicate that both the W32G and K87A mutations abolish the association of laforin with glycogen complexes. Many proteins associate with intracellular glycogen complexes via interactions with glycogen binding proteins. For instance, the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1 is associated with glycogen only when it binds to the glycogen-targeting regulatory subunits (21Newgard C.B. Brady M.J. O'Doherty R.M. Saltiel A.R. Diabetes. 2000; 49: 1967-1977Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). To determine whether laforin interacts with an intermediate glycogen-binding protein or directly binds to glycogen, we carried out an in vitro glycogen binding experiment using protein-free glycogen and recombinant wild type and mutant laforin proteins. A His-tagged recombinant laforin was expressed in bacteria and purified on Ni2+-agarose column. To determine whether the recombinant laforin was properly folded, the phosphatase activity was analyzed. The specific activity of the recombinant laforin towardpNPP was 1.34 × 10−5 mol/mg/min at the optimum pH of 5.0. Under the same conditions, the CBD mutant protein W32G/K87A showed 75% activity of the wild type enzyme, while the C266S mutant was inactive. We were unable to purify the W32G mutant protein, because it was present in insoluble bacteria pellet. We incubated the purified recombinant proteins with glycogen at 4 °C for 30 min and then precipitated the glycogen particles by ultracentrifugation. Both wild type enzyme and the C266S mutant protein co-sedimented with glycogen, while the CBD mutant protein W32G/K87A remained in the supernatant (Fig. 2C). Wild type laforin protein did not exhibit any tendency to aggregate, excluding this a reason for its presence in the glycogen pellet (Fig. 2D). Thus our results suggest that laforin associates directly with glycogen, and mutations that disrupt the CBD of laforin abrogate the glycogen binding. Based on our glycogen binding studies of laforin CBD domain, we developed a functional model by threading its amino acid sequence onto the crystal structure of cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (protein data bank number: 2DIJ) using program O (22Jones T.A. Zou J.Y. Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13014) Google Scholar). Our model predicts that the two invariant Trp residues in the CBD of laforin (Fig.3, W32 and W99) directly interact with the polysaccharide in a manner similar to the two Trp residues (Trp616 and Trp662) in cyclodextrin glycosyltransferase (Fig. 1B, CDGT). The invariant residue Lys87 is also predicted to directly interact with the carbohydrate via several hydrogen bonds. Lafora disease-related mutation of Trp32 to glycine (W32G) would disrupt the polysaccharide binding pocket and also potentially unfold the region immediately adjacent to the binding pocket. Our K87A mutation would also affect the carbohydrate binding by disrupting hydrogen bonds between the protein and carbohydrate. Other mutations found in patients with myoclonus epilepsy are also predicted to alter the ability of the protein to bind to glycogen. For example, F84L would affect the positioning of Trp85 in the polysaccharide binding pocket, while F88L would disturb the structural integrity of the polysaccharide binding site by altering the positioning of Lys87. To study the subcellular localization of laforin, the full-length protein was fused to the NH2 terminus of EGFP. The laforin protein was localized to punctate cytoplasmic structures in transfected COS1 cells (Fig. 4,A and B). Glycogen synthase is known to localize to intracellular glycogen particles (23Brady M.J. Nairn A.C. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 29698-29703Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 24Brady M.J. Kartha P.M. Aysola A.A. Saltiel A.R. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 249-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) and was used as a control for laforin expression. Expression of cDNA constructs pEGFP-Laf and pcDNA4/Myc-GS showed that laforin and glycogen synthase co-localize in the same punctate structures within the cytoplasm of transfected COS1 cells (Fig. 4A; laforin was shown ingreen fluorescence; glycogen synthase was shown inred fluorescence.). The subcellular distribution of the phosphatase-inactive laforin mutant proteins (C266S and D234A) showed the same punctate pattern as the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4B). In contrast, the CBD mutant laforins (W32G, K87A, W32G/K87A) distributed evenly throughout the cytoplasm and did not exhibit a punctate expression pattern (Fig. 4B), suggesting that the CBD domain is responsible for the specific subcellular localization of laforin. Taking together, our subcellular localization studies support the concept that laforin is targeted to intracellular glycogen particles by its CBD domain and mutations that disrupt carbohydrate binding abolish laforin targeting. What is the in vivo substrate of laforin? Although there currently is no answer to this question, the clinical and genetic features of Lafora disease distinguish it from other well known glycogen storage diseases (27Wolfsdorf J.I. Holm I.A. Weinstein D.A. Endocrinol. Metab. Clin. 1999; 28: 801-823Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our work clearly demonstrated that laforin is targeted directly to glycogen. It would not be surprising that the substrate would also be directly involved in glycogen metabolism. The substrate likely contributes to the relative complexity of glycogen metabolism in vertebrates, since we have been unable to find laforin orthologues in worms or flies. Efforts are currently in progress to identify candidate phosphoprotein substrates for the laforin phosphatase. In summary, our studies indicate that the laforin phosphatase contains an NH2-terminal CBD that targets the protein to glycogen and that mutations in CBD, including the W32G mutation found in Lafora disease, lead to mis-targeting of laforin. The characteristic histology of Lafora disease is an intraneuronal accumulation of Lafora bodies. The targeting of laforin to intracellular glycogen complexes suggests that it may act on proteins important in glycogen metabolism, which are also co-localized to similar sites within the cell. Mutations that disrupt the CBD of laforin would attenuate its localization to glycogen particles, where the substrate of laforin may reside. This provides an explanation for why some patients with mutations only in the CBD, but not in the phosphatase domain, develop Lafora disease. We thank Gregory S. Taylor for his technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W2002168442,"Synaptic activation of the transcription factor CREB and downstream gene expression usually depend on calcium influx aided by voltage-gated calcium channels. We find that nicotinic signaling, in contrast, activates CREB and gene expression in ciliary ganglion neurons both in culture and in situ only if voltage-gated channels are silent. The nicotinic response requires calcium influx and release from internal stores and acts through CaMK and MAPK pathways to sustain activated CREB. Voltage-gated channels mobilize CaMK to activate CREB initially, but they also enable calcineurin and PP1 to terminate the activation before transcription is affected. L-type voltage-gated channels dominate the outcome and block the effects of nicotinic signaling on transcription. This demonstrates a novel aspect of activity-dependent gene regulation."
https://openalex.org/W2164436869,"Nuclear factor (NF)-κB transcription factors are involved in the control of a large number of normal cellular and organismal processes, such as immune and inflammatory responses, developmental processes, cellular growth, and apoptosis. Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome depends on the intracellular environment where the integrate viral DNA is regulated by a complex interplay among viral regulatory proteins, such as Tat, and host cellular transcription factors, such as NF-κB, interacting with the viral long terminal repeat region. CBP (CREB-binding protein) and p300, containing an intrinsic histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity, have emerged as coactivators for various DNA-binding transcription factors. Here, we show that the p50 subunit as well as the p50/p65 of NF-κB, and not other factors such as SP1, TFIIB, polymerase II, TFIIA, or p65, can be acetylated by CBP/p300 HAT domain. Acetylation of p50 was completely dependent on the presence of both HAT domain and Tat proteins, implying that Tat influences the transcription machinery by aiding CBP/p300 to acquire new partners and increase its functional repertoire. Three lysines, Lys-431, Lys-440, and Lys-441 in p50 were all acetylated in vitro, and a sequence similarity among p50, p53, Tat, and activin receptor type I on these particular lysines was observed. All proteins have been shown to be acetylated by the CBP/p300 HAT domain. Acetylated p50 increases its DNA binding properties, as evident by streptavidin/biotin pull-down assays when using labeled NF-κB oligonucleotides. Increased DNA binding on HIV-1 long terminal repeat coincided with increases in the rate of transcription. Therefore, we propose that acetylation of the DNA binding domain of NF-κB aids in nuclear translocation and enhanced transcription and also suggest that the substrate specificity of CBP/p300 can be altered by small peptide molecules, such as HIV-encoded Tat.

Franzoso G. Brown K. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 405-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (2008) Google Scholar), which are involved in the control of a large number of normal cellular and organismal processes, such as immune and inflammatory responses, developmental processes, cellular growth, and apoptosis. In addition, these factors are active in a number of disease states, including cancer, arthritis, inflammation, asthma, neurodegenerative diseases, and heart disease (2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 16: 225-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (4570) Google Scholar).The prototype NF-κB transcription factor consists of two subunits, NF-κB1 (p50), the DNA-binding subunit, and RelA (p65), the transactivating subunit. NF-κB transcription factors bind to 10-bp DNA sites (κB sites) as dimers. They bind specifically to a decameric sequence (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) in the κ light chain enhancer region (33. Grilli, M., snf Memo, M. (1999) Biochem. Pharmacol., 57, 1-7.Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB is tightly regulated by interaction with inhibitory IκB proteins. The best studied Rel-IκB interaction is that of IκB α with the NF-κB p50-RelA dimer, and this interaction blocks the ability of NF-κB to enter the nucleus and bind to DNA (4Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, in most cells, NF-κB is present as a latent, inactive, IκB-bound complex in the cytoplasm (4Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). When a cell receives any of a multitude of extracellular signals, IκB kinase leads to the phosphorylation of two conserved serines near the N terminus of IκB α, which targets IκB α for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteosome (5Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). The unmasked NF-κB can then enter the nucleus to activate target gene expression. After translocation to the nucleus, NF-κB must gain access to the promoters and enhancers of the genes it regulates before it can stimulate their transcription (6Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).Transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) genome is largely dependent on constitutive DNA-binding proteins, inducible transcription factors (such as NF-κB), and the viral activator Tat (7Jacque J.M.

CBP/p300 are large proteins, containing 2,441 and 2,414 amino acids, respectively, and have the ability to interact simultaneously with various transcription factors such as nuclear hormone receptors, cAMP-responsive element-binding protein, c-Jun, v-Jun, c-Myb, v-Myb, Sap-1a, c-Fos, MyoD, YY1, NF-κB, p53 (20Goldman P.S.

Virology. 2001; 289: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This superinduction in activated transcription on chromatin DNA has been attributed to the HAT activity of CBP/p300 on the integrated HIV-1 promoter. It is known that CBP/p300 acetylates Tat at a double lysine motif in a highly conserved region (24Ott M. Schnolzer M. Garnica J. Fischle W. Emiliani S. Rackwitz H.R. Verdin E. Curr. Biol. 1999; 9: 1489-1492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 25Deng L. de la Fuente C., Fu, P. Wang L. Donnelly R. Wade J.D. Lambert P., Li, H. Lee C.G. Kashanchi F.

Virology. 2001; 289: 312-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In the absence of CBP/p300 and Tat crystal structures, it was shown previously that Tat can change the conformation of the CBP/p300 in vitro such that basal transcription factors such as TATA-binding protein (TBP) and TFIIB could bind with higher affinity to CBP/p300 and influence the activation process by aiding CBP/p300 to recruit new partners into the transcription machinery (25Deng L. de la Fuente C., Fu, P. Wang L. Donnelly R. Wade J.D. Lambert P., Li, H. Lee C.G. Kashanchi F. Virology. 2000; 277: 278-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). In this study, we find that the p50 subunit of transcription factor NF-κB is acetylated by CBP/p300 in presence of HIV-1 viral protein Tat. Interestingly, acetylated p50 or p50/p65 binds with higher affinity to DNA containing NF-κB binding sites. This was observed in a gel shift assay and confirmed further by biotin pull-down and competition assays. Furthermore, acetylated p50 increases the transcription of HIV-1 compared with unacetylated p50. Therefore, our results suggest that acetylated p50 or p50/p65 binds with high affinity to DNA, which in turn increases the rate of transcription.DISCUSSIONMembers of the p300 and CBP family appear to be present only in higher eukaryotic cells. Many viruses have evolved mechanisms to control both viral and host transcriptional machinery through CBP/p300. Tat is known to bind CBP/p300 in the minimal HAT domain (1253–1710), and this binding is stable at high salt wash conditions. Moreover, Tat changes the conformation of CBP/p300 such that the altered molecule can bind to other transcription factors with higher affinity, implying that Tat influences the transcription machinery by aiding CBP/p300 to acquire new partners and increase its functional repertoire (25Deng L. de la Fuente C., Fu, P.

Acetylation regulates many diverse functions, including DNA recognition, RNA binding, protein-protein interaction, and protein stability.

Many examples of such phenomena are exemplified by the interaction of CBP/p300 with an array of transcription factors including sequence-specific DNA-binding proteins, such as NF-κB, CREB, or activator protein 1(AP-1) family members, that interact with promoter and act as either enhancers or repressors of gene expression during cellular activation (25Deng L. de la Fuente C., Fu, P. Wang L. Donnelly R. Wade J.D. Lambert P., Li, H. Lee C.G. Kashanchi F. Virology. 2000; 277: 278-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). The NF-κB that enters the nucleus from the cytoplasm in response to signaling is phosphorylated and associates specifically with CBP/p300. It is only the CBP/p300-associated NF-κB that is transcriptionally active (33. Grilli, M., snf Memo, M. (1999) Biochem. Pharmacol., 57, 1-7.Google Scholar,32Ghosh S. Immunol. Res. 1999; 19: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), leaving the possibility that NF-κB might not interact directly with general transcription factors, but instead use the CBP/p300 coactivator as a bridging molecule (33Perkins N.D. Felzien L.K. Betts J.C. Leung K. Beach D.H. Nabel G.J. Science. 1997; 275: 523-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar, 34Perkins N.D. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 1433-1448Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar).Here, we have shown that NF-κB-p50 either alone or complexed with p65 could be acetylated by CBP/p300 HAT domain only when Tat (either wild type or peptides containing core and basic domains) is present in the system. This opens the possibility that Tat alters the specificity of CBP/p300 activity on a range of other associated factors. In fact, in an attempt to find other non-histone transcription factors that could serve as a substrate for Tat and p300 HAT complex, we utilized all known transcription factors affecting the HIV-1 transcription in vitro and have found that the human TBP can serve as a substrate for acetylation in vitro. 2L. Deng and F. Kashanchi, unpublished results. The increased acetylation on TBP increased its DNA binding to HIV-1 TATA box. It remains to be seen whether TBP acetylation either alone or in the context of SL1, TFIID, or TFIIIB could increase the rate of cellular pol I, II, and III transcription or simple reinitiation of HIV-1 or the transactivation response region independent promoters normally affected by Tat. Therefore, the increased in DNA binding of acetylated TBP to TATA box, or acetylated p53 to its target DNA (36Gu W. Roeder R.G. Cell. 1997; 90: 595-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2152) Google Scholar), is consistent with the effect of acetylated p50 binding with higher affinity to the NF-κB DNA binding site.Also, it is important to note here that we have performed in vivo labeling experiments, where we added either purified Tat or tumor necrosis factor-α to ACH2 (HIV-1-infected latent) cells, labeled with [ 3L. Deng, unpublished results. H]acetate, and immunoprecipitated the nuclear p50, and observed acetylation of NF-κB in these cells.3 However, we have not been successful in obtaining relevant p50 mutant data because we find the K431A mutant to be very unstable in cells, and the K440A/K441A double mutant is unable to enter the nucleus (data not shown).The physical interaction between Tat and CBP/p300 HAT domain could potentially occur in the cytoplasm. This is especially true with cells treated with extracellular Tat, where similar to the enhanceosome affecting the interferon-β promoter, CBP/p300 would modify a cytoplasmic transcription factor, such as p50/p65-IκB complex, and release the p50/p65 from its inactive form to an acetylated active form entering the nucleus. In fact, when looking at the p50/p65-IκB crystal structure and modeling for amino acid changes in the p50 protein, the C-terminal tail of p50 and its respective lysines (Lys-341, Lys-440, Lys-441), which are located outside of the DNA binding domain, allow for potential acetylation in p50 (51Huxford T. Huang D.B. Malek S. Ghosh G. Cell. 1998; 95: 759-770Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (489) Google Scholar). Therefore, we predict that acetylation of p50 by the p300-Tat complex in the cytoplasm would release the p50 from its inhibitory IκB subunit and allow entry of active NF-κB into the nucleus, hence increase transcription.Finally, it is interesting to note a sequence similarity among 50, p53, Tat, and activin receptor type I on lysines that are acetylated by CBP/p300 (Fig. 6 A). Although not all sites are acetylated equally in these proteins, acetylation of these proteins controls either DNA, RNA, or protein binding activities, implying that acetylation is a critical step in transcriptional regulation. Collectively, we propose a model (Fig.6 B) in which acetylation of p50 by p300-Tat complex increases its DNA binding activity, which may recruit more p65 (transactivator subunit of NF-κB) and in turn increase the rate of transcription. Future experiments will define which promoters other than HIV-1 (e.g. interleukin-8) are affected by p50 acetylation and whether p50 DNA binding is regulated through the cell cycle.

In addition, these factors are active in a number of disease states, including cancer, arthritis, inflammation, asthma, neurodegenerative diseases, and heart disease (2Ghosh S. May M.J. Kopp E.B.

NF-κB transcription factors bind to 10-bp DNA sites (κB sites) as dimers. They bind specifically to a decameric sequence (5′-GGGACTTTCC-3′) in the κ light chain enhancer region (33. Grilli, M., snf Memo, M. (1999) Biochem. Pharmacol., 57, 1-7.Google Scholar). The activity of NF-κB is tightly regulated by interaction with inhibitory IκB proteins. The best studied Rel-IκB interaction is that of IκB α with the NF-κB p50-RelA dimer, and this interaction blocks the ability of NF-κB to enter the nucleus and bind to DNA (4Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). Thus, in most cells, NF-κB is present as a latent, inactive, IκB-bound complex in the cytoplasm (4Gilmore T.D. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6842-6844Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). When a cell receives any of a multitude of extracellular signals, IκB kinase leads to the phosphorylation of two conserved serines near the N terminus of IκB α, which targets IκB α for polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26 S proteosome (5Karin M. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6867-6874Crossref PubMed Scopus (993) Google Scholar). The unmasked NF-κB can then enter the nucleus to activate target gene expression. After translocation to the nucleus, NF-κB must gain access to the promoters and enhancers of the genes it regulates before it can stimulate their transcription (6Perkins N.D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 434-440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar).

Recent studies suggest that VHL protein (pVHL) is a component of an E3 ubiquitin ligase, but the detailed biological function of pVHL remains to be determined. To further elucidate the biological functions of pVHL, we searched pVHL-interacting proteins using yeast two-hybrid screening. A novel protein named VHL-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 1 (VDU1) was identified as being able to directly interact with pVHL in vitro and in vivo. We have determined the full-length cDNA of this enzyme, which includes two putative subtypes. Type I consists of 942 amino acids, and type II consists of 911 amino acids with predicted molecular masses of 107 and 103 kDa, respectively. We have also cloned a mouse homologue of this enzyme. Sequence analysis reveals that this protein is conserved between human and mouse and contains the signature motifs of the ubiquitin-specific processing protease family. Enzymatic function studies demonstrate its deubiquitinating activity. We have determined that the VDU1-interacting region in pVHL is located in its β-domain, and several naturally occurring mutations located in this domain disrupt the interaction between pVHL and VDU1 protein. Co-immunoprecipitation demonstrates that VDU1 can be recruited into the pVHL-elongin C-elongin B complex. Finally, we demonstrate that VDU1 is able to be ubiquitinated via a pVHL-dependent pathway for proteasomal degradation, and VHL mutations that disrupt the interaction between VDU1 and pVHL abrogate the ubiquitination of VDU1.

HIF1 is a sequence-specific DNA binding transcriptional complex consisting of an α-subunit and a β-subunit that regulates genes involving angiogenesis (17Wang G.L. Jiang B.H. Rue E.A. Semenza G.L.

Without functional pVHL, HIF1 can be accumulated in cells resulting in overexpression of HIF1 target genes such as vascular endothelial growth factor (11Tyers M. Rottapel R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 12230-12232Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Hemangioblastomas are mainly formed by excessive growth of blood vessels responding to a local increase of angiogenic factors (19Krieg M. Marti H.H. Plate K.H.

Indeed, it has been demonstrated that the overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor in a mouse brain is enough to induce blood vessels to proliferate and generate a structure similar to a hemangioblastoma (21Benjamin L.E. Keshet E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 8761-8766Crossref PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Tumorigenesis in renal cells seems to be more complex because, although loss of the VHL gene has been seen in early premalignant renal cysts, accumulation of other mutations or derailed molecule events are necessary for a full-blown clear cell renal carcinoma (22Kaelin W.G., Jr. Maher E.R. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 423-426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). Besides HIF1-α, other important downstream targets of VCB-CUL-2 E3 ubiquitin ligase might exist. It is important to identify other pVHL-ubiquitinating targets or pVHL-interacting proteins, which may further reveal the molecular mechanisms of pVHL-related tumorigenesis. In this report, we have identified a novel pVHL-interacting protein that belongs to the ubiquitin-specific processing protease (USP) family. We have named this protein as pVHL-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 1 (VDU1). Cloning the full-length cDNAs of human VDU1 (hVDU1) and its mouse homologue (mVDU1) has revealed that this protein is highly conserved between human and mouse and contains the signature motifs of the USP family. Enzymatic function studies demonstrate its deubiquitinating activity. We have determined that the VDU1-interacting region in pVHL is located in the β-domain of pVHL, which is the region harboring naturally occurring mutations in VHL disease and target recognition domain for ubiquitin-dependent degradation pathway. Several naturally occurring mutations located in the β-domain of pVHL disrupt the interaction between pVHL and VDU1 protein. Co-immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that hVDU1 can be recruited into the VCB complex. Finally, we demonstrate that hVDU1 can be ubiquitinated for degradation in a pVHL-dependent manner, and VHL mutations that disrupt the interaction between hVDU1 and pVHL abrogate the ubiquitination of hVDU1. Our current findings indicate that VDU1 is a downstream target of pVHL for ubiquitination and degradation. Yeast two-hybrid system 3 (CLONTECH), an improved GAL4-based system, was used in our experiments. A pretransformed human kidney cDNA library (pACT2 vector) in the Tyr-187 yeast strain was screened via yeast mating with a yeast strain AH109 transformed with a VHL bait construct pGBKT7-hVHL19. This construct, prepared to express a fusion protein containing GAL4 DNA binding domain and pVHL amino acids 54–213, was verified by DNA sequencing. The expression of GAL4-hVHL19 fusion protein in yeast strain AH109 was confirmed by Western blotting. This bait did not have any intrinsic activation function as demonstrated by a bait-testing assay. A stringent selection procedure detecting only strong interactions was used in our experiments. The 5′- and 3′- RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA end) experiments were performed using Marathon cDNA amplification kit (CLONTECH) according to the protocol by the manufacturer. The specific PCR reaction conditions were 94 °C for 3 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 72 °C for 3 min; 5 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 70 °C for 3 min; and then 25 cycles of 94 °C for 5 s, 68 °C for 3 min. The PCR products were subcloned into pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen), and selected clones were sequenced to assemble the full-length cDNA. On-line BLAST searches were performed using the GenBankTM data base via the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) home page on the world wide web. Open reading frame and translated protein sequences were analyzed by MacDNASIS software (HITACHI) and data base searches. To express GST fusion protein,pGEX6p1-VHL19 was constructed by inserting human pVHL19 cDNA into pGEX6p1 vector (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.).pGEX6p1-VHL-(54–83), pGEX6p1-VHL-(54–100), pGEX6p1-VHL-(80–213), andpGEX6p1-VHL-(93–213) derived from pGEX6p1-VHL19 were constructed to express pVHL fragments containing residues 54–83, 54–100, 80–213 and 93–213, respectively. Missense mutation constructs pGEX6p1-VHL19-F76I, N78S, P81S, R82P, P86H, R167W, and R167Q were derived from pGEX6p1-VHL19 by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis. pCMX-VHL19 was constructed for FLAG-tagged pVHL. pcDNA4c-VHL19, pcDNA4c-VHL19-P81S,and pcDNA4c-VHL19-R82P were constructed for in vitro transcription and translation. Because the N terminus of hVDU1 Type I is not conserved in mouse, pSG5-hVDU1 andpcDNA4c-hVDU1 were prepared for expressing hVDU1 Type II without or with 6× His tag, respectively. pM-VHL19 andpVP16-hVDU1 were prepared for mammalian two-hybrid assay.pET28c-hVDU1 was prepared to express 6× His tag-fused hVDU1 in Escherichia coli. pDEST14-hVDU1 andpDEST17-hVDU1 were prepared to express native hVDU1 and 6× His tag-fused hVDU1 in E. coli, respectively.pEGFP-C3-hVDU1 was constructed to express GFP-hVDU1 fusion protein. pGEX-3X-Ub and pACYC-184-Ub-GST were prepared to express ubiquitin C terminus fused with GST (deubiquitinating substrate) in E. coli. pcDNA3-EB andpcDNA4-EC were constructed to express elongin B and 6× His-fused elongin C for co-immunoprecipitation. pSG5-p53 was constructed by inserting a p53-coding sequence into pSG5 vector. All sequences amplified by PCR were confirmed by complete sequencing. COS-7 and human renal cell carcinoma 786-O cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin (25 units/ml), streptomycin (25 μg/ml), and 10% fetal bovine serum. Transient transfection was performed using SuperFect (Qiagen) transfection solution according to manufacturer's protocol. For examining the degradation of VDU1 protein in COS-7 cells, we transiently transfected pEGFP-C3-hVDU1 (1.5 μg) and pCMX-VHL19 (3 μg) into COS-7 cells in 60-mm diameter plastic dishes. After 36 h of incubation, some cells were treated with MG132 (5 μm, Calbiochem) for 6 h. For 786-O cells, the 100-mm diameter dishes of cells were transfected with a total of 10 μg of DNA/transfection (5 μg of each plasmid and, when necessary, supplemented with empty pCMX vector to a total of 10 μg of DNA). 36 h after transfection, cells from each transfection were divided equally into multiple 60-mm dishes, allowed to grow overnight, and then treated with either cycloheximide (100 μg/ml, Sigma) for various time points or MG132 for 6 h. The blot containing ∼2 μg of poly(A) RNA from human heart, brain, placenta, lung, liver, skeletal muscle, kidney, and pancreas was purchased fromCLONTECH and hybridized with32P-labeled hVDU1 cDNA. The blot was subsequently probed with a β-actin cDNA probe. Anti-GST, anti-6× His, anti-ubiquitin, anti-β-actin, and anti-GFP monoclonal antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnologies. Anti-VHL monoclonal antibody was purchased from PharMingen. Samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) or polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore) for subsequent immunoblotting. Overnight cultures of BL21 cells transformed with wild-type, truncated, and mutant VHL GST fusion proteins were diluted 1:100 in a Luria-Bertani medium plus ampicillin and cultured at 30 °C untilA 600 reached 0.8. The fusion proteins were then induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside and purified using glutathione-Sepharose 4B MicroSpin columns (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). The amounts of GST or GST fusion proteins were quantitated using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The same amounts of GST or GST fusion proteins were added into glutathione-Sepharose 4B MicroSpin columns and incubated for 3 h at 4 °C. After the columns were washed three times, 5 μl of in vitro translated [35S]methionine-labeled hVDU1 were added into each of the reactions and incubated at 4 °C for 3 h. After being washed five times, the proteins were eluted by glutathione elution buffer, and 20 μl of eluted protein were resolved on a 5% SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. An in vitro coupled reticulocyte transcription and translation system (Promega) with [35S]methionine was used to generate recombinant proteins. For each immunoprecipitation sample, 10 μl of protein A/G-agarose (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies) were precleared by mixing with 1 mg of mouse IgG at 4 °C for 3 h mixed with 5 μl of each radiolabeled in vitro translation product, 10 μl of antibody, and 470 μl of co-immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.5 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.1% Tween 20). The mixture was incubated at 4 °C for 3 h in a shaker and washed three times. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 3 min in 1× SDS-loading buffer and separated on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel followed by autoradiography. For in vivo co-immunoprecipitation assays, COS-7 cells were transfected with 5 μg of each plasmid pEGFP-C3-hVDU1 and/or pCMX-VHL19. 36 h after transfection, cells were treated with MG132 for 6 h and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, lysed, and centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min. The supernatants were precleared by adding 100 μl of protein A/G-agarose bead slurry/1 ml of cell lysate and incubated at 4 °C for 10 min. Anti-VHL monoclonal antibody was added into the cell lysates and incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. 30 μl of protein A/G-agarose were then added into the mixture followed by rotation at 4 °C for 3 h being spun down and washed three times. The precipitates were resolved on an 8% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted with anti-GFP antibody. pM-VHL19, pVP16-hVDU1, and pG5CAT were co-transfected into COS-7 cells with a constant amount of a second reporter, pCMV-GAL4, for normalizing the transfection efficiency. After 24 h, cells were harvested and lysed. The lysates were used for radioactive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase assay to demonstrate the interaction between the two proteins. For in vivo deubiquitination assay, pDEST14-hVDU1 or pDEST17-hVDU1 together with pACYC-184-Ub-GST was co-transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Stratagene). The cells were grown in Luria-Bertani medium to A 600 of 0.8 and induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C, harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × gfor 20 min, lysed in phosphate-buffered saline by six times of sonication, and centrifuged for 20 min at 14,000 × g. The supernatant was loaded onto a 12% SDS-PAGE gel followed by immunoblotting. For in vitro deubiquitination assay, 6× His tag-fused hVDU1 was purified from E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the pET28c-hVDU1 using a Ni-NTA spin column (Qiagen).E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the empty pET28c was lysed and purified using Ni-NTA spin column. The eluted solution was used as negative control (see Fig. 4 A, 6× His tag). hVDU1 protein was also expressed as 6× His tag fusion protein in COS-7 cells by transient transfection of pcDNA4c-hVDU1. Ubiquitin-GST fusion protein was purified from E. coli BL21 cells transformed with the pGEX-3X-Ub using glutathione-Sepharose 4B MicroSpin column. Purified ubiquitin-GST fusion protein and 6× His tag-fused hVDU1 protein were incubated together in the deubiquitinating buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol) at 30 °C for 1 h. Yeast lysates were used as a positive control. The reaction products were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel followed by immunoblotting. The method for in vitro ubiquitination assay described by Cockman et al.(16Cockman M.E. Masson N. Mole D.R. Jaakkola P. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Maher E.R. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. Maxwell P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25733-25741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (924) Google Scholar) was used in our experiments. COS-7 or 786-O cells were washed twice with cold hypotonic extraction buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm dithiothreitol). Crude extracts were centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and stored in aliquots at −70 °C. Ubiquitination assays were carried out at 30 °C in a total volume of 40 μl containing 3 μl of [35S]methionine-labeled hVDU1 or p53, 2 μl of programmed reticulocyte lysate, 27 μl of cell extract, 4 μl of 10× ATP-regenerating system (20 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm ATP, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 300 mm creatine phosphate, 0.5 mg/ml creatine phosphokinase), 4 μl of 5 mg/ml ubiquitin (Sigma), and 1 μl of 150 μmubiquitin-aldehyde (Calbiochem). For pVHL reconstitution experiments, the same amount of [35S]methionine-labeled wild-type or mutated pVHL19 2In vitro translated protein from pcDNA4c-VHL19, pcDNA4c-VHL19-P81S, and pcDNA4c-VHL19-R82P by TNT system (Promega), the amount of these proteins were estimated using ImageQuant software by quantitating the radioactivity. was preincubated with the reaction mixture at room temperature for 5 min prior to the addition of substrate. Aliquots were removed at indicated times, mixed with SDS sample buffer, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel and autoradiography. After screening 5.5 × 106 clones, two of our positive cDNA clones were identical and ∼2.5 kb in length. DNA sequencing revealed that these two clones encoded 402 amino acids followed by a 1.3-kb 3′-untranslated region and matched to an uncharacterized partial cDNA sequence (GenBankTMaccession number AB029020). A yeast two-hybrid assay using independent co-transformation of the bait vector and these candidate clones followed by growth selection and a β-galactosidase assay further confirmed the interaction between pVHL and these candidate clones. We designated this gene as VHL-interacting deubiquitinating enzyme 1 (VDU1) based on sequence analysis. Using 5′- and 3′-RACE-PCR method, we determined the full-length cDNA sequence of hVDU1. We found two hVDU1 mRNA species with differences at their 5′ regions presumably resulting from RNA alternative splicing. hVDU1 Type I cDNA (GenBankTMaccession number AF383172) contains 4502 nucleotides and encodes an open reading frame of 942 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 107 kDa. Multiple in-frame stop codons are present in hVDU1 Type I mRNA, indicating that the full-length coding region has been obtained. hVDU1 Type II mRNA (GenBankTM accession number AF383173) (4323 nucleotides) contains the same 5′ end as Type I but lacks a 179-bp exon in the 5′ region and encodes an open reading frame of 911 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 103 kDa. The initiation codon of Type II corresponds to the second methionine codon in hVDU1 Type I, and no in-frame stop codon exists in its 5′-untranslated region. We also isolated the mouse homologue (mVDU1) using mouse testis and embryo cDNAs as templates. As in the 5′-untranslated region of hVDU1 Type II, no in-frame stop codon was present in the 5′-untranslated region of mVDU1. The mVDU1 (GenBankTM accession number AF383174) consists of 909 amino acids, which corresponds to hVDU1 Type II. The putative amino acid sequences of hVDU1 and mVDU1 are shown in the Fig.1 A. The alignment of amino acid sequences shows that the mVDU1 has a 92% homology with hVDU1 Type II. After searching the PROSITE data base, two ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase domains, −1 and −2, crucial for the deubiquitinating activity of deubiquitinating enzymes, were identified in human and mouse VDU1. Northern blot analysis showed that hVDU1 mRNA was expressed at the highest levels in brain, kidney, heart, and placenta tissues but at lower levels in the liver, lung, pancreas, and skeletal muscle (Fig. 1 B). The size of hVDU1 mRNA is ∼4.5 kb, and only this single band is shown on the blot (Fig. 1 B), which suggests that if alternative splicing occurs, only small differences may exist in VDU1 mRNAs. This result also further supports our completion of the full-length cDNA cloning of VDU1. Because the extra amino acids in the N terminus of hVDU1 Type I were not conserved in mVDU1 based on our current findings, hVDU1 Type II was constructed into different expression vectors for the studies described below. The association of full-length hVDU1 with pVHL was tested in vitro using a GST pull-down assay. The35S-labeled hVDU1 specifically bound to the GST-pVHL19-(54–213) fusion protein but not to the GST alone (Fig.2 A), indicating a physical association between these two proteins in vitro. The association of hVDU1 with pVHL was also tested by in vitroco-immunoprecipitation. The 35S-labeled hVDU1 and c-Myc-fused pVHL19-(54–213) were transcribed and translatedin vitro. After interacting with c-myc-fused pVHL, hVDU1 was precipitated by an anti-c-Myc antibody (Fig. 2 B). To determine whether pVHL and hVDU1 could interact in mammalian cells, a co-transfection of pM-pVHL-(54–213) and pVP16-hVDU1 into COS-7 cells was performed, which revealed that the expression of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase enzyme was stimulated by the interaction between these two proteins (Fig. 2 C). The interaction between hVDU1 and pVHL was also tested by in vivo co-immunoprecipitation. In this experiment, pEGFP-C3-hVDU1 and pCMX-pVHL were co-transfected into COS-7 cells. As shown in Fig. 2 D, GFP-hVDU1 could be co-precipitated by an anti-VHL antibody (Fig. 2 D). Thesein vitro and in vivo experiments strongly support our conclusion that the hVDU1 protein is a pVHL-interacting partner. To further determine the hVDU1-interacting region in pVHL, GST pull-down assay was performed with pVHL fragments covering different regions. GST-VHL-(54–213), GST-VHL-(54–100), and GST-VHL-(54–83), but not GST-VHL-(80–213) and GST-(93–213), could bind to the in vitro translated hVDU1 protein (Fig.3 A). These results suggest that hVDU1 interacts with pVHL from residues 54 to 83. This region is in the pVHL β-domain, which is responsible for substrate recognition for ubiquitination and degradation. Many missense mutations found in VHL disease or renal cell carcinomas occur in this region. We further tested the interactions between hVDU1 and several common VHL mutants that harbor naturally occurring mutations in the β-domain and α-domain. Our results showed that pVHL mutants harboring the mutations in the β-domain (F76I, N78S, P81S, and R82P) disrupted the interactions between pVHL and hVDU1. The mutant P86H, located in the β-domain of pVHL but not in the hVDU1-interacting region of pVHL, did not affect the interaction between hVDU1 a"

Profound depression and unusual periodic total transmission failures with repetitive stimulation point to a defect in vesicle mobilization/cycling, and these defects were mimicked in (+/+) NMJs by inhibitors of myosin light chain kinase, known to affect vesicle mobilization. Two separate release mechanisms, utilizing different endocytic machinery and Ca(2+) channels, were shown to coexist in (-/-) terminals, with the mature process targeted to presynaptic membrane opposed to muscle, and an abnormally retained immature process targeted to the remainder of the presynaptic terminal and axon. Thus, NCAM plays a critical and heretofore unsuspected role in the molecular organization of the presynaptic NMJ."

We showed that the internal structure of spike bursts was regulated with a precision of circa 0.2 ms, and yielded alignment of acoustic features of song with a precision of circa 1 ms. In addition, interburst intervals and corresponding syllable durations displayed systematic variation within song (average elongation 0.3 ms/s song), and slower ""drift"" across songs. Systematic variation on even a coarser time scale might be difficult to detect in other systems, but could affect the analysis of temporal patterning. The close relationship between precise timing of individual spikes and stereotypic behavior suggests that song is represented in RA by a temporal code."
https://openalex.org/W2066945321,"Peptide nucleic acid (PNA) is a DNA mimic with promising properties for the development of antisense agents. Antisense PNAs targeted to Escherichia coli genes can specifically inhibit gene expression, and attachment of PNA to the cell-permeabilizing peptide KFFKFFKFFK dramatically improves antisense potency. The improved potency observed earlier was suggested to be due to better cell uptake; however, the uptake kinetics of standard or modified PNAs into bacteria had not been investigated. Here we monitored outer and inner membrane permeabilization by using chemical probes that normally are excluded from cells but can gain access at points where membrane integrity is disturbed. Membrane permeabilization was much more rapid in the presence of peptide-PNA conjugates relative to the free components used alone or in combination. Indeed, peptide-PNAs permeabilized E. coli nearly as quickly as antimicrobial peptides. Furthermore, as expected for outer membrane-active compounds, added MgCl2 reduced cell-permeabilization. Concurrent monitoring of outer and inner membrane permeabilization indicated that passage across the outer membrane is rate-limiting for uptake. The enhanced cell-permeation properties of peptide-PNAs can explain their potent antisense activity, and the results indicate an unanticipated synergy between the peptide and PNA components.

The enhanced cell-permeation properties of peptide-PNAs can explain their potent antisense activity, and the results indicate an unanticipated synergy between the peptide and PNA components. Antisense agents are designed to inhibit gene expression through sequence-specific nucleic acid binding, and this normally requires the formation of 10 or more base pairs. Oligonucleotides of such lengths are typically too large for efficient passive cellular uptake by diffusion across lipid bilayers (1Wittung P. Kajanus J. Edwards K. Nielsen P. Norden B. Malmstrom B.G. FEBS Lett. 1995; 365: 27-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and cellular outer membranes can pose additional barriers. Recently we introduced antisense peptide nucleic acids (PNAs) 1PNApeptide nucleic acidLPSlipopolysaccharideNPNN-phenyl-1-naphthylamineONPGo-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside as antisense agents for bacterial applications. The early experiments indicated very encouraging sequence specificity against reporter genes; however, uptake appeared to be limited by bacterial cell barriers (2Good L. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar,3Good L. Nielsen P.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2073-2076Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). This limitation is not surprising as Escherichia coliand other Gram-negative bacteria have outer and inner bilayer membranes. In addition, the outer membrane contains a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) layer that stringently restricts the entry of foreign molecules (4Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, there are opportunities to overcome these cellular barriers and even exploit membrane charge characteristics to enhance delivery. peptide nucleic acid lipopolysaccharide N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside PNA is a DNA mimic with (standard) nucleobases attached to a pseudo-peptide backbone (see Fig. 1) (5Nielsen P.E. Egholm M. Berg R.H. Buchardt O. Science. 1991; 254: 1497-1500Crossref PubMed Scopus (2861) Google Scholar). The PNA molecule provides improved hybridization affinity and specificity, chemical and enzymatic stability, and low toxicity. Antisense PNAs have outperformed DNA analogues in diverse systems (2Good L. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 355-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar, 6Larsen H.J. Bentin T. Nielsen P.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1489: 159-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). The main limitation to wider applications in vivo appears to be poor cellular uptake; however, there are several recent examples showing improved delivery and antisense effects for PNAs attached to carrier peptides. For delivery into eukaryotic cells, PNAs have been attached to a peptide derived from the third helix domain of the Drosophilaantennapedia transcription factor (7Pooga M. Soomets U. Hallbrink M. Valkna A. Saar K. Rezaei K. Kahl U. Hao J.X., Xu, X.J. Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z. Hokfelt T. Bartfai T. Langel U. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar) and to a nuclear localization signal peptide (8Cutrona G. Carpaneto E.M. Ulivi M. Roncella S. Landt O. Ferrarini M. Boffa L.C. Nat. Biotechnol. 2000; 18: 300-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). For delivery into bacteria, we have attached PNAs to a range of cell-permeabilizing peptides and found that this greatly improves antisense effects in E. coli (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). In particular, the KFFKFFKFFK peptide (10Vaara M. Porro M. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1996; 40: 1801-1805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) provides potent bactericidal effects when attached to an antisense PNA targeted to the essentialacpP gene (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The KFFKFFKFFK peptide was assumed to improve antisense effects by improving PNA uptake properties. Previous studies involving mutant strains and cell-permeabilizing agents show that the E. coliouter membrane LPS layer is a major barrier against PNA uptake intoE. coli (11Good L. Sandberg R. Larsson O. Nielsen P. Wahlestedt C. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The KFFKFFKFFK peptide-PNAs were designed to overcome this barrier by providing a membrane-active domain (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). This is a reasonable delivery strategy because such cationic peptides are likely to be attracted to negatively charged portions of the LPS, and the uncharged peptide residues and PNA itself could aid passage across the hydrophobic membrane interior (12Wu M. Maier E. Benz R. Hancock R.E. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 7235-7242Crossref PubMed Scopus (631) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the charge gradient across the cell membrane could help drive cationic peptides into cells (13Hancock R.E. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 37-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Although such mechanistic details are not yet established for membrane-active peptides, improved permeation potentially could enable efficient delivery of peptide-PNAs, and this could explain the improved antisense potencies for these agents (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). If the improved antisense potencies observed for peptide-PNAs are indeed due to outer cell membrane permeabilization, the membrane activity should be measurable using small molecule indicators of membrane integrity (see Fig. 2). Here we show that membrane permeabilization by the peptide-PNA conjugate is higher than for free PNA or free peptide and similar to natural cationic antimicrobial peptides. The improved cell permeation properties of peptide-PNAs can explain their potent antisense effects, and the results reveal an unanticipated synergism between the two linked components. The PNAs and PNA-peptides used in this study were synthesized using the tBoc protection strategy as described previously (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 14Christensen L. Fitzpatrick R. Gildea B. Petersen K.H. Hansen H.F. Koch T. Egholm M. Buchardt O. Nielsen P.E. Coull J. Berg R.H. J. Pept. Sci. 1995; 1: 175-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (349) Google Scholar). The peptide KFFKFFKFFK was synthesized by a standard, solid-phase tBoc strategy (15Merrifield B. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1963; 85: 2149-2154Crossref Scopus (6709) Google Scholar). Polymyxin B sulfate,N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (NPN),o-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactoside (ONPG), and melittin were from Sigma Chemical Co. Nitrocefin was from Oxoid Ltd. (Basingstoke, Hampshire, United Kingdom). E. coli bacteria of wild type strain K12 were obtained from the Coli Genetic Stock Center (Yale University, New Haven CT), and E. coli strain ML-35p was provided by Prof. Robert I. Lehrer (Center for Health Sciences, Los Angeles, CA). Cells were grown in LB medium to 0.4A 550, rinsed once using centrifugation 3000 × g, and suspended in 10 mm HEPES buffer (pH 7.2) or 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) to an A 550 of 0.5. Two methods were used to assess outer membrane permeabilization. The NPN access assay was performed essentially as described previously (16Loh B. Grant C. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1984; 26: 546-551Crossref PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Briefly,E. coli cells were grown, harvested, and suspended as described above. NPN was added to a concentration of 10 mminto quartz cuvettes containing 2 ml of cell suspension. The permeating agents were added, and the sample was mixed by inversion of the cuvette immediately prior to fluorescence monitoring. Fluorescence was measured using a Shimadzu RF-1501 spectrofluorometer with slit widths set to 1 mm and excitation and emission wavelengths set to 350 and 420 nm, respectively. Outer membrane permeability was determined essentially as described previously (17Angus B.L. Carey A.M. Caron D.A. Kropinski A.M. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Briefly, E. coli strain ML-35p cells, which carry a plasmid-borne β-lactamase gene, were prepared as described above. The permeabilization assays were carried out using 96-well microtiter plates with wells containing 100 μl of 5 mmHEPES (7.4), 5 mm carbonyl cyanidem-chlorophenylhydrazone, 20 μg/ml nitrocefin, and cells were added to 0.1 A 550. Following addition of the permeabilizing substances, nitrocefin cleavage was monitored by light absorption measurements at 500 nm. Permeabilization of the inner membrane was assessed by measuring the access of ONPG to the cytoplasm essentially as described previously (18Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Ganz T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar) using E. coli ML35p cells prepared as described above. Briefly, ONPG was added to a concentration of 100 μg/ml, and substrate cleavage in the presence of permeabilizers by β-galactosidase was monitored by light absorption measurements at 485 nm. The PNA, peptide, and peptide-PNAs used here (Fig. 1) are noninhibitory to cell growth at the concentrations used in the cell permeabilization experiments, and the PNAs show sequence-specific antisense effects (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). To test the ability of different PNA constructs to permeabilize the E. coli outer membrane, the hydrophobic fluorescent probe NPN was used as an indicator of membrane integrity (Fig. 2). NPN has a low fluorescence quantum yield in aqueous solution but fluoresces strongly in the hydrophobic environment of a biological membrane. Normally NPN is excluded from E. coli by the outer membrane LPS layer but can enter at points where membrane integrity is compromised. PNA, peptide, or peptide-PNA was added to a suspension of E. coliML35p cells in the presence of NPN, and all compounds were found to permeabilize the membrane to NPN but at different rates (Fig.3 A). Free PNAs showed a slow permeabilization rate, and the free peptide KFFKFFKFFK showed only a slightly higher permeabilization rate. Simultaneous addition of free PNA and free peptide also showed a slow permeabilization rate similar to that for free peptide. In contrast, the peptide-PNA conjugate showed much higher activity than the free components, approaching the activity of polymyxin B in this assay. Similar results were obtained forE. coli K12 (data not shown). Polymyxin B and other cationic antimicrobial peptides are believed to compete for magnesium ion binding sites within the LPS layer as part of their membrane-permeabilizing activities (13Hancock R.E. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 37-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). If PNAs permeabilizeE. coli cells by a mechanism similar to polymyxin B, the activity should be limited by added Mg2+ ions. To test this possibility, excess MgCl2 (1 mm) was added and found to dramatically limit membrane permeabilization by peptide-PNA molecules (Fig. 3 B). This suggests that competition for the Mg2+ binding sites within the LPS layer is an important step in the uptake process. However, it is also possible that excess magnesium ions reduce the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged PNA construct and negatively charged bacterial outer membranes. To corroborate the results from the NPN assay and enable simultaneous monitoring of outer and inner cell membrane permeabilization, two chromogenic reporter molecule systems were used at the same time (Fig. 2). Permeabilization of the outer membrane was monitored using nitrocefin as a probe. Nitrocefin is normally excluded by the outer cell membrane, but if able to pass this barrier it can be cleaved by β-lactamase localized within the periplasmic space. Cleavage results in a color change from yellow to red, and this can be used to monitor outer membrane permeabilization. In a similar way, permeabilization of the inner membrane was monitored using the β-galactosidase substrate ONPG as a probe. In E. colistrain ML35p, which lacks lac permease, ONPG is blocked from cell entry by the inner membrane, but if able to pass this barrier ONPG can be cleaved by β-galactosidase localized within the cytoplasm, and this results in the appearance of a yellow color (18Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Ganz T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). With these two reporter systems, it is possible to monitor permeabilization of both the outer and inner E. coli membranes. The results for outer membrane permeabilization in this assay were similar to those observed with the NPN fluorescence assay described above. Free PNA and free peptide when used separately or added in combination showed little membrane activity, whereas the peptide-PNA conjugate permeabilized the outer membrane more rapidly. In this assay the peptide-PNA permeabilized cells at a rate that was similar to melittin but slower than polymixin (Fig.4 A). Similar results were seen for PNA #1901, which contains a different PNA sequence (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar) (data not shown). As seen in the NPN assay, the peptide-PNA conjugate was much more membrane-active than the free components. Therefore, both assays indicate a surprisingly high membrane activity of the peptide-PNA conjugate. The inner membrane also was permeabilized much more rapidly by the peptide-PNA conjugates than by free PNA or free peptide used separately or in combination (Fig. 4 B). Furthermore, comparison of the results for outer and inner membrane permeabilization indicates that the membrane activities for peptide-PNA conjugates resemble that of melittin with inner membrane permeabilization closely following outer membrane permeabilization. In contrast, polymyxin B, which is highly active against the outer membrane (18Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Ganz T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar), showed relatively weak inner membrane activity (Fig. 4 B). Because outer and inner cell membrane monitoring was concurrent, it is possible to comment on the relative rates of permeabilization of the two membranes (18Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Ganz T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). The similar rates observed for outer and inner membrane permeabilization, characterized by 50% probe conversion after ∼5 min, indicate outer membrane passage as rate-limiting for peptide-PNA uptake as also appears to be the case for free PNA, free peptide (Figs. 3 and 4), and most other foreign compounds (4Nikaido H. Science. 1994; 264: 382-388Crossref PubMed Scopus (1262) Google Scholar). The increased rate of nitrocefin or ONPG conversion also could be attributed to β-lactamase or β-galactosidase escape from cells rather than to probe entry. However, this seems unlikely because the enzymes are much larger than the chromogenic probes and permeabilizing peptides used here. Furthermore, neither β-lactamase nor β-galactosidase leakage in the presence of cell-permeabilizing peptides was associated with the permeabilization assays performed here (17Angus B.L. Carey A.M. Caron D.A. Kropinski A.M. Hancock R.E. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1982; 21: 299-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar, 18Lehrer R.I. Barton A. Ganz T. J. Immunol. Methods. 1988; 108: 153-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, to ensure that such leakage did not confound the results, we treated E. coli with peptide-PNA at 1 μm for 30 min and measured β-lactamase and β-galactosidase activity in the supernatant. No increase was observed relative to untreated cells (data not shown), suggesting that conversion of the chromogenic probes occurs mainly inside cells. To gain insight into mechanistic aspects of the peptide-PNA membrane activities, the peptide-PNA was used in the nitrocefin outer membrane permeabilization assay at a range of concentrations. The time response to addition of the conjugate at concentrations between 0.03 and 10 μm indicates that relatively large changes in permeabilization rates occurred with midrange concentration changes (1–5 μm) (Fig.5). The nonlinear dose response, although modest, may reflect some form of intermolecular cooperative activity between peptide-PNA conjugates during cell entry as observed for certain antimicrobial peptides (19Turner J. Cho Y. Dinh N.N. Waring A.J. Lehrer R.I. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother. 1998; 42: 2206-2214Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this case, however, further analyses are needed to explore this aspect of cell entry by peptide-PNAs. PNA antisense effects in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells can be dramatically improved by the attachment of so-called “carrier” peptides to the PNA (7Pooga M. Soomets U. Hallbrink M. Valkna A. Saar K. Rezaei K. Kahl U. Hao J.X., Xu, X.J. Wiesenfeld-Hallin Z. Hokfelt T. Bartfai T. Langel U. Nat. Biotechnol. 1998; 16: 857-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar, 9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). For E. coli applications, attachment of the cell-permeabilizing peptide KFFKFFKFFK increased antisense potency against E. coli RNA targets by up to 2 orders of magnitude (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). Although it was proposed that the improved antisense effects observed for peptide-PNAs over “naked” PNAs were due mainly to improved cell permeation, this was not established experimentally. Here we have begun to characterize the kinetics of cell permeation by standard PNA and peptide-PNA conjugates and report studies using small chemical probes as indicators of outer and inner membrane permeabilization (Figs. 1 and 2). The results show that peptide-PNAs are indeed membrane permeabilization reagents. Peptide-PNAs showed permeabilization rates much higher than that of the free peptide and similar to natural antimicrobial peptides. Therefore, the results support the contention that cell entry is a limiting factor for antisense PNA potency. Concurrent monitoring of outer and inner membrane permeabilization indicated that peptide-PNA activity at the inner membrane closely followed that of the outer membrane for both standard PNAs and peptide-PNAs. The results are consistent with an earlier study comparing the antisense effects of standard PNAs in mutant and permeabilized cells (11Good L. Sandberg R. Larsson O. Nielsen P. Wahlestedt C. Microbiology. 2000; 146: 2665-2670Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), showing that it is predominantly the outer membrane that limits PNA entry. Therefore, while the kinetics of permeabilization were much faster for peptide-PNAs, permeation of the outer membrane appears to remain rate-limiting for cellular uptake. To explain the improved cell uptake of peptide-PNAs across E. coli cell membranes we can envision a self-promoted uptake pathway as proposed for certain cationic antimicrobial peptides (13Hancock R.E. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 37-42Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In this proposed pathway, the peptide-PNAs would contact the outer membrane through electrostatic attraction and compete for Mg2+binding sites between LPS molecules. This competition would disrupt the integrity of the outer cell membrane, providing opportunities for the membrane charge gradient to force positively charged conjugates into cells. At this time, such details remain speculative. For antimicrobial applications, the linked peptide potentially could improve PNA efficacy in two ways. As a carrier domain, the KFFKFFKFFK peptide can increase antisense effects by improved cellular uptake (9Good L. Awasthi S.K. Dryselius R. Larsson O. Nielsen P.E. Nat. Biotechnol. 2001; 19: 360-364Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). As well, by acting as a permeabilizing domain the peptide could kill cells by causing cell leakage (Figs. 3 and 4). Both effects are potentially useful in antimicrobial development, and the results shown here indicate that peptide-PNAs can posses a surprisingly high level of membrane activity. Although the peptide-PNA was expected to show more membrane activity than free PNA, the observation that the conjugate is more membrane-active than the free peptide was unexpected. This enhanced activity suggests that both portions of the conjugate contribute to membrane activity in a synergistic manner. One possibility is that the uncharged PNA residues provide or enhance amphipathic features that help perturb membranes. In summary, PNAs can permeabilize both the outer and inner E. coli cell membranes, and these activities can be significantly enhanced by conjugation to the cell-permeating peptide KFFKFFKFFK. The improved cell permeabilization observed for peptide-PNA conjugates appears to explain the improved antisense potencies of such conjugates. The mechanistic basis for the peptide-PNA intramolecular synergism observed is not understood; however, competition for Mg2+binding sites within the outer membrane LPS layer and some form of synergism between the peptide and PNA components appear to be important for efficient permeation. The high membrane activity exhibited by peptide-PNA conjugates raises prospects for practical applications of such antisense PNAs and opens additional possibilities to explore in peptide-PNA design.

Res. 1996; 113: 143-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), it has been proposed that these ion channels may play a role in acid-induced nociception (26Waldmann R. Lazdunski M. Curr. Opin.

A. 2001; 98: 395-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). In addition, recent work has demonstrated that BNaC1 is required for normal mechanosensation. Mice with a targeted deletion of theBNaC1 gene show reduced sensitivity of rapidly and slowly adapting mechanoreceptors, which correspond to a subset of large diameter DRG neurons (29Price M.P. Lewin G.R. McIlwrath S.L. Cheng C. Xie J. Heppenstall P.A. Stucky C.L. Mannsfeldt A.G. Brennan T.J. Drummond H.A. Qiao J. Benson C.J. Tarr D.E. Hrstka R.F. Yang B. Williamson R.A. Welsh M.J. Nature. 2000; 407: 1007-1011Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar). With an isoform-specific antiserum, we found that BNaC1α is expressed by most large diameter, mechanosensory DRG neurons, is transported to the periphery, and is present at a variety of specialized cutaneous mechanosensory terminals (30García-Añoveros J. Samad T. Z˘uvela-Jelaska L. Woolf C.J. Corey D.P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2678-2686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Together these findings suggest that BNaC1 isoforms may form subunits of a mechanosensory ion channel complex in peripheral neurons. BNaC1 is thus the only mammalian ion channel known to play a role in touch. In addition, heteromultimerization of BNaC/ASIC family members has been demonstrated in heterologous expression systems (17Lingueglia E. de Weille J.R. Bassilana F. Heurteaux C. Sakai H. Waldmann R.

Channels composed of different combinations of the BNaC/ASIC subunits may participate in both mechanotransduction and nociception. Both the targeting of BNaC1α to specialized touch terminals and its function in touch transduction are likely to require interacting proteins. We have used a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify proteins that interact with the C terminus of BNaC1. Here we report that the PDZ domain protein PICK1 interacts with the C termini of both BNaC1 and BNaC2 and that PICK1 and the BNaC1α isoform are coexpressed by peripheral (sensory) and central (Purkinje and pyramidal) neurons. DNA encoding residues 481–512 or 481–508 of mouse BNaC1 were amplified and cloned into pBHA, a LexA DNA binding domain fusion vector, to create ctBNaC1BHA and ctBNaC1Δ4BHA, respectively. DNA encoding residues 477–526 of rat BNaC2 was amplified and cloned into pBHA to create ctBNaC2BHA. PCR was used to add a tyrosine to residues 481–512 to create ctBNaC1+YBHA. DNA encoding mouse BNaC1 residues 481–512, 481–508, and 481–512, followed by a tyrosine, were also subcloned into pGEX6p1 (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Buckinghamshire, UK) to create the GST fusion vectors GST-ctBNaC1, GST-ctBNaC1Δ4, and GST-ctBNaC1+Y. The GW4 plasmid contains the complete coding sequence of human BNaC1α under the CMV promoter (30García-Añoveros J. Samad T. Z˘uvela-Jelaska L. Woolf C.J. Corey D.P. J. Neurosci. 2001; 21: 2678-2686Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The full-length coding sequence of mouse PICK1 was amplified from mouse brain cDNA and subcloned into pCMVmyc (CLONTECH, Palo Alto, CA) and GAL4.2.1 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) to generate PICK1CMVmyc and PICK1GAL4.2.1. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to change residues 27 and 28 of PICK1 from KD to AA. Yeast two-hybrid screens and reporter gene assays were performed in the L40 yeast strain that contains the HIS3 and βGal reporter genes (34Niethammer M. Sheng M. Methods Enzymol. 1998; 293: 104-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). ctBNaC1BHA was used to screen a mouse inner ear cDNA library constructed in the GAL4 activation domain vector pGAL4.2.1 with the Hybrizap-2.1 two-hybrid Gigapack cloning kit and cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene). Plasmids were introduced into COS-7 cells with LipofectAMINE (Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) or FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) on protamine-coated coverslips for immunocytochemistry and in 35 mm or 100 mm tissue culture dishes for pull-down assays and immunoprecipitations. HEK293 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate. Transfected COS-7 cells were stained 2 days after transfection. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min, rinsed three times with PBS, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, rinsed four times with PBS, and then blocked with 3% normal donkey serum and 3% BSA in PBS for 90 min. Cells were incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer overnight at 4 °C. After four washes with PBS, cells were incubated with the secondary antibodies in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature. Cells were washed five times with PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). DRG and skin sections were prepared and stained as described previously (30García-Añoveros J. Samad T. Z˘uvela-Jelaska L. Woolf C.J. Corey D.P. J.

Cy-3 donkey anti-rabbit, FITC donkey anti-goat and FITC donkey anti-mouse (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) secondary antibodies were used. For brain immunohistochemistry, rats were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde, their brains were postfixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 2 h at 4 °C, and 50-μm sections were cut with a vibratome. Floating sections were permeabilized in 50% ethanol for 30 min and then blocked and labeled with antibodies as indicated above for cultured cells. Mouse anti-MAP2 (HM2, Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) was used at 1/1000 to label dendrites. For controls, the antibodies were preincubated with excess antigenic peptide (9-fold excess for N18, 100-fold for anti-PICK1 2–31, and 500-fold excess of BSA conjugated to the antigenic peptide for anti-BNaC1α (R6798). Transfected HEK293 cells were lysed with lysis buffer containing 50 mm Tris (pH7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, plus Complete protease inhibitor mixture (PIC, Roche Molecular Biochemicals). BSA was added to 4 mg/ml. Lysates were pre-cleared with rabbit IgG and 20 μl of Ultralink immobilized protein A/G (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 h at 4 °C. BNaC1 and associated proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates with 1.5 μg of rabbit αBNaC1α antibody MDeg11a (Alpha Diagnostic International, San Antonio, TX), and 10 μl of immobilized protein A/G overnight at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 250 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100, and PIC. The beads were resuspended in SDS sample buffer and heated for 5 min at 100 °C, and proteins were resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were then electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The anti-myc antibody 9E10 and horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were used for immunoblotting. Immunoblotting was developed with enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (ECL Plus, Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Rat cerebellar membranes were isolated and solubilized in extraction buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and PIC) (37Wyszynski M. Sheng M. Methods Enzymol. 1999; 294: 371-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). 10 μg of goat IgG or αPICK1 N18 antibody were used in immunoprecipitations from cerebellar membranes. Immunoprecipitates were washed three times with wash buffer (50 mm Tris (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm EDTA, and protease inhibitors), resuspended in SDS sample buffer, and processed for immunoblotting. The rabbit BNaC1α antibody AB5460 (Chemicon, Temecula, CA) and horseradish peroxidase goat anti-rabbit IgG were used for immunoblotting. GST fusion proteins were expressed in BL21(DE3)LysS and purified from bacterial lysates on glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). Cell extracts were prepared from COS-7 cells transfected with PICK1CMVmyc or PICK1(K27A,D28A)CMVmyc in lysis buffer. Extracts were incubated for 1 h to overnight at 4 °C with GST fusion proteins. Beads were washed four times and processed as for immunoprecipitations. Examination of the sequences of the BNaC1 and BNaC2 channels reveals that, although their intracellular C termini are largely divergent, the extreme C-terminal eight residues are conserved (Fig.1 A) (4García-Añoveros J. Derfler B. Neville-Golden J. Hyman B.T. Corey D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1459-1464Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). ASIC4 is also similar to BNaC1 and BNaC2 in this region, whereas DRASIC, the remaining gene in the BNaC/ASIC branch, is not. Because many ion channels and receptors interact with other proteins through their C termini, it seemed likely that BNaC channels might also. Therefore, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen with the last 32 amino acids of the BNaC1 C terminus (ctBNaC1) as bait. From a screen of 660,000 transformants, we obtained four positive clones. Partial sequencing showed that all four clones encoded the PICK1 protein. Complete sequencing of one of the clones showed that it contains a full-length, 1.8-kb cDNA of PICK1, which includes 73 bp of 5′-untranslated sequence fused in-frame to the GAL4 activation domain sequence of the GAL4.2.1 vector. We confirmed the PICK1·BNaC1 interaction by subcloning the PICK1 coding sequence alone into the GAL4.2.1 vector and cotransforming with ctBNaC1. Cotransformation resulted in activation of two reporter genes,HIS3 and lacZ, as evidenced by histidine-independent growth and β-galactosidase activity (Fig.1 B). PICK1 was first identified as a protein that interacts with protein kinase C (38Staudinger J. Zhou J. Burgess R. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and has subsequently been shown to interact with other proteins. The 416-amino acid PICK1 protein contains a PDZ domain at its N terminus (39Staudinger J., Lu, J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) followed by a predicted coiled-coil domain (35Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar). PDZ domains are protein·protein interaction domains that bind to short peptide sequences, which usually occur at C termini (40Kim E. Niethammer M. Rothschild A. Jan Y.N. Sheng M. Nature. 1995; 378: 85-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (892) Google Scholar, 41Kornau H.-C. Schenker L.T. Kennedy M.B. Seeburg P.H.

Reed J.C. Science. 1995; 268: 411-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar). To test whether PICK1 interacts with the C-terminal residues of BNaC1, we deleted the last four amino acids of the BNaC1 C terminus bait to create the construct ctBNaC1Δ4. This deletion eliminated the interaction with PICK1 (Fig. 1 B). In addition, we added a tyrosine to the BNaC1 C terminus bait to create the construct ctBNaC1+Y. This alteration also eliminated the interaction with PICK1. Therefore, the last residues of BNaC1 are required for interaction with PICK1, and they must be located at the C terminus. Because of the similarity between the C-terminal residues of BNaC1 and BNaC2, we asked whether the C terminus of BNaC2 also interacts with PICK1 and found that it does (Fig. 1 B). Based on their target binding specificity, PDZ domains have been classified into at least three types, each of which recognizes a site with a hydrophobic amino acid at the most C-terminal, or 0 position. The three types are distinguished by their binding preference at the −2 position with type I PDZ domains binding T or S, type II PDZ domains binding bulky hydrophobic residues, and type III PDZ domains binding E or D at this position (44Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 45Tochio H. Zhang Q.

BNaC1 and BNaC2 contain I or F at the −2 position and, thus, are similar to type II targets, although they differ in having a cysteine at their C terminus. Although a cysteine at the 0 position is not common in PDZ target peptides, it has been found in the binding partners of the PDZ proteins SITAC (47Borrell-Pagès M. Fernández-Larrea J. Borroto A.

PDZ domains possess a 7- to 8-amino acid segment known as the carboxylate-binding loop, which includes a conserved lysine or arginine that interacts with the free carboxylate of the C-terminal residue of target peptides (44Songyang Z. Fanning A.S., Fu, C., Xu, J. Marfatia S.M. Chishti A.H. Crompton A. Chan A.C. Anderson J.M. Cantley L.C. Science. 1997; 275: 73-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (1209) Google Scholar, 56Doyle D.A. Lee A. Lewis J. Kim E. Sheng M. MacKinnon R. Cell. 1996; 85: 1067-1076Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (953) Google Scholar). As in previous studies (35Xia J. Zhang X. Staudinger J. Huganir R.L. Neuron. 1999; 22: 179-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 39Staudinger J., Lu, J. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 32019-32024Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), we mutated this conserved lysine and an adjacent aspartate to alanines (PICK1(K27A,D28A)). This double-mutant form of PICK1 did not interact with ctBNaC1 in yeast (Fig. 1 B). Therefore, the PDZ domain of PICK1 is necessary for the interaction of PICK1 with the C terminus of BNaC1. To confirm in vitro the ability of the C terminus of BNaC1 to bind PICK1, we expressed myc-tagged-PICK1 in COS cells and performed pull-down experiments with a bacterially expressed GST fusion to the C terminus of BNaC1 (GST-ctBNaC1) (Fig.2 A). GST-ctBNaC1 retained mycPICK1, whereas GST alone or the mutated GST-ctBNaC1Δ4 and GST-ctBNaC1+Y did not. However, GST-ctBNaC1 did not retain the double-mutant form of PICK1(mycPICK1(K27A,D28A)) (Fig.2 B). To demonstrate that BNaC1α and PICK1 can also interact in mammalian cells, we coexpressed full-length human BNaC1α and mycPICK1 in HEK293 cells. mycPICK1 was coimmunoprecipitated with a BNaC1α-specific antibody but not with control IgG (Fig. 3 A). Inclusion of antigenic peptide prevented coimmunoprecipitation. Therefore, PICK1 and BNaC1α can interact specifically in mammalian cells as well as in yeast. We also demonstrated an association between endogenous PICK1 and BNaC1α in tissue by coimmunoprecipitating BNaC1α from rat cerebellar membrane extracts using a PICK1 antibody, but not control IgG (Fig. 3 B). However, only a small amount of the total BNaC1α was coimmunoprecipitated. This may be because PICK1 has other binding partners in the cerebellum (36Xia J. Chung H.J. Wihler C. Huganir R.L. Linden D.J. Neuron. 2000; 28: 499-510Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar) but may also be accounted for if only a fraction of cerebellar BNaC1α is bound to PICK1 at any one moment. We were unable to demonstrate coimmunoprecipitation of PICK1 from cerebellar membrane extracts using a BNaC1α antibody; coimmunoprecipitation may be obscured in this case, because the precipitating antibody migrates with a mobility similar to that of PICK1 and is recognized at a low level by the secondary antibody used for immunoblotting. We expressed BNaC1α and mycPICK1 in COS cells and found that they colocalized within cells (Fig.4, A–C). As previously reported (38Staudinger J. Zhou J. Burgess R. Elledge S.J. Olson E.N. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 263-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 50Dev K.K. Nishimune A. Henley J.M. Nakanishi S. Neuropharmacology. 1999; 38: 635-644Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), PICK1 immunoreactivity in COS cells was observed throughout the cytoplasm and around the nucleus, concentrated to one side of the nucleus. BNaC1α immunoreactivity in COS cells is present in intracellular compartments throughout the cytoplasm and in the plasma membrane (Fig. 4 E and data not shown). However, in cells that express both BNaC1 and mycPICK1, these two proteins apparently form intracellular coaggregates with a vesicular appearance in which BNaC1 immunoreactivity colocalizes with mycPICK1 (Fig. 4,A–C). Coaggregates were not seen when BNaC1 is coexpressed with mycPICK1(K27A,D28A), although some overlapping localization was still seen in many cells (Fig. 4, D–F). The formation of coaggregates when BNaC1α was expressed with mycPICK1 but not mycPICK1(K27A,D27A) demonstrates a specific interaction between BNaC1α and mycPICK1 in heterologous cells, which requires the PICK1 PDZ domain. Several BNaC/ASIC genes are expressed in subsets of sensory neuro"

HDAC10 was classified as a class II subfamily member based upon similarity to HDAC6. The genomic structure of HDAC10 was found to consist of 20 exons. HDAC10 has two sequence variants, HDAC10v1 and HDAC10v2, and two transcripts were detectable by Northern blot analysis. HDAC10v1 and HDAC10v2 were found to be identical through exon 17 but diverged after this exon. HDAC10v2 has an 82-bp alternate exon that generates a frameshift and shortens the sequence by 11 amino acids. In this study, the characterization of HDAC10v1 was performed. HDAC10v1 has an N-terminal catalytic domain, two putative C-terminal retinoblastoma protein binding domains, and a nuclear hormone receptor binding motif. The HDAC10v1 enzyme was found to be catalytically active based upon its ability to deacetylate a 3H-acetylated histone H4 N-terminal peptide. Immunofluorescence detection of transfected HDAC10v1-FLAG indicated that the enzyme is a nuclear protein. Furthermore, coimmunoprecipitation experiments indicated that HDAC10v1 associated with HDAC2 and SMRT (silencing mediator for retinoid and thyroid hormone receptors). In addition, based upon the public data base, a single nucleotide polymorphism was found in the C terminus of HDAC10 which changes a Gly residue to Cys, suggesting that HDAC10 molecules containing these single nucleotide polymorphisms may be folded improperly. HDAC10 extends the HDAC superfamily and adds to a growing number of HDACs that have been found to have splice variants, suggesting that RNA processing may play a role in mediating the activity of HDACs.

Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar). The roles of class II HDACs were reviewed recently (9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Additional reports described nuclear complexes of HDAC4 and HDAC5 or HDAC7 with MEF2, a regulator of muscle myogenesis (25Alland L. Muhle R. Hou H. Potes J. Chin L. Schreiber-Agus N. DePinho R.A. Nature. 1997; 387: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (733) Google Scholar, 26Lu J. McKinsey T.A. Zhang C.L. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. 2000; 6: 233-244Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (435) Google Scholar), and HDAC9 was also found to mediate MEF2 transcriptional repression (10Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). The cellular localization of HDAC4, HDAC5, and HDAC7 was determined by their phosphorylation status and whether they were associated with 14-3-3 proteins (9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Complexes of class III HDACs with other proteins have yet to be identified. However, studies in yeast demonstrated that like other HDACs, yeast Sir2 is involved in silencing, cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and meiotic checkpoint control (27Dressel U. Bailey P.J.

Furthermore, the three-dimensional structure of Sir2·Af1 complexed with the cofactor NAD revealed core domains that are conserved among Sir2 proteins and are thought to function in the binding of NAD, histones, and potentially other substrates for deacetylation (31Landry J. Sutton A. Tafrov S.T. Heller R.C. Stebbins J. Pillus L. Sternglanz R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 5807-5811Crossref PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar).The cellular localization, expression patterns, and sensitivity to HDAC inhibitors differ among HDAC classes. Class I human HDACs are predominantly nuclear proteins that are expressed ubiquitously in many human cell lines and tissues (8Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar), whereas class II HDACs are expressed differentially (8Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar) and shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus (9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Class I and class II HDACs are sensitive to HDAC inhibitors, whereas class III HDACs are insensitive to HDAC inhibitor trichostatin A (TSA) (8Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 32Min J. Landry J. Sternglanz R. Xu R.-M. Cell. 2001; 105: 269-279Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar).Recent evidence suggests that classes of HDAC enzymes have specific roles. For example, a genomic approach demonstrated that yeast genes are expressed differentially in response to individual deletions ofRpd3, Sir2, and Hda1 (34Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Yeast HDACs were found to play distinct roles in regulating genes that control cell cycle progression, amino acid biosynthesis, and carbohydrate transport and utilization (34Bernstein B.E. Tong J.K. Schreiber S.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13708-13713Crossref PubMed Scopus (366) Google Scholar). Studies performed inDrosophila demonstrated that Rpd3 plays a regulatory role in segmentation during fly development (35Mannervik M. Levine M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 6797-6801Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar).The sequencing of the human genome has led to the identification of new HDAC family members. In this study, the histone deacetylase class II subfamily member, HDAC10v1 was characterized. This HDAC10 sequence was described in a recent review of class II HDACs, but at that time it was designated HDAC9 (9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and while this manuscript was in review, was also reported as HDAC10α (12Kao H.-Y. Lee C.-H. Komarov A. Han C.C. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). In addition, a splice variant of HDAC10 which is different from the reported splice variant HDAC10β was also found. The catalytically active HDAC10v1 enzyme was found to be expressed in the nucleus, has two sequence variants, and is associated with HDAC2 and SMRT.DISCUSSIONHDACs are members of an expanding family of enzymes that modulate chromatin structure (8Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem.

A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). The sequencing of the human genome allowed us to identify an additional HDAC isoform that was designated HDAC10. The HDAC10 sequence was identified previously as an EST on chromosome 22 (50Dunham I. Shimizu N. Roe B.A. Chissoe S. Hunt A.R. Collins J.E. Bruskiewich R. Beare D.M. Clamp M. Smink L.J. Ainscough R. Almeida J.P. Babbage A. Bagguley C. Bailey J. Barlow K. Bates K.N. Beasley O. Bird C.P. Blakey S. Bridgeman A.M. Buck D. Burgess J. Burrill W.D. O'Brien K.P. et al.Nature. 1999; 402: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (911) Google Scholar) and was subsequently annotated in the human EST data base as a sequence similar to KIAA0901 and mouse HDA2. The HDAC10 sequence was also reported in a recent review of class II HDACs (9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Until now, there were no experimental data to demonstrate that this sequence represented a catalytically active enzyme. In this study, the EST was cloned, characterized, and designated as HDAC10v1.HDAC10v1 represents a new member of the HDAC superfamily, adding to the nine members that were previously reported and classified as class I or class II HDACs (8Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar, 11Zhou X. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). A recent review (9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) divided class II HDACs into two subclasses, class IIa (HDAC4, 5 and 7) and class IIb (HDAC6 and HDAC10) based upon homology among deacetylase domains. In this study, HDAC10 was found to be most similar to HDAC6. Furthermore, HDAC10 has undergone a partial duplication event similar to HDAC6. This is based upon the high identity of HDAC10 N-terminal catalytic domain amino acids with C-terminal amino acids that are part of a second domain that was predicted to be a partial inactive catalytic domain (12Kao H.-Y. Lee C.-H. Komarov A. Han C.C. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Like other HDACs, HDAC10 N-terminal catalytic domain includes conserved residues that were found previously to make up the binding pocket and charge relay systems in the bacterial HDAC-like protein HDLP which are thought to be important for HDAC activity (49, Table I). Multiple sequence alignments of HDAC catalytic domain amino acids suggested that strict conservation of some of these amino acids may not be required. These amino acid differences that are found in subsets of HDACs might offer an additional method of classifying HDACs. HDAC10v1 was demonstrated to be catalytically active, and like other class I and class II HDACs, HDAC10v1 deacetylase activity is inhibited by TSA (Fig.3 C). Although HDAC10v2 has not yet been determined to be catalytically active, HDAC10v2 contains the amino acids that are predicted to be necessary for catalytic activity, and thus, HDAC10v2 is expected to be a catalytically active splice variant.HDACs have generally been found as single transcripts based upon Northern blot analyses (8Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar, 10Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). However, analysis of the genomic structure of HDAC10 and a search of the human genomic data base for sequences that are similar to HDAC10 revealed that HDAC10 had two sequence variants. The presence of HDAC10v1 and HDAC10v2 in the human EST data base and sequenced cDNA clones confirmed their existence. Further evidence for multiple HDAC10 transcripts was demonstrated by the identification of two transcripts in normal tissues by Northern blot analysis (Fig. 2 A) and in mixed tissue and dorsal root ganglion cDNA libraries by Southern analysis (Fig. 3). These data suggested that HDAC10 variants are products of alternative splicing. While this manuscript was in review, another group also found a splice variant of this gene called HDAC10β (12Kao H.-Y. Lee C.-H. Komarov A. Han C.C. Evans R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 187-193Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Interestingly, HDAC10β and HDAC10v2 are different sequences, indicating that HDAC10 has multiple splice variants. Furthermore, other HDACs were also recently found to have multiple splice variants, including HDAC3, HDAC7, and HDAC9 (11Zhou X. Marks P.A. Rifkind R.A. Richon V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 10572-10577Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), suggesting that HDACs are regulated at the level of RNA processing.Previous studies using Northern blot analysis suggested that class I HDACs are expressed ubiquitously, whereas class II HDACs have a more limited tissue distribution (8Gray S.G. Ekstrom T.J. Exp. Cell. Res. 2001; 262: 75-83Crossref PubMed Scopus (493) Google Scholar, 9Bertos R. Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). In this study, HDAC10 was found to be expressed ubiquitously (Fig. 5 A). However, differential expression was found for the two HDAC10 transcripts, and increased RNA levels were observed in certain tissues. The ubiquitous expression of HDAC10 was confirmed by real time PCR (Fig.5 B). In addition, a real time PCR survey of HDAC 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 10 RNA levels in normal tissues and cell lines (data not shown) suggests that HDACs can be classified by their expression patterns in tissues relative to cell lines and demonstrated that HDAC10 is present at varying levels in a wide range of normal tissues and tumor cell lines. The expression pattern of HDAC10v1 was found to be more similar to class II than class I HDACs. Class II HDACs and HDAC10 had similar copy numbers in normal tissues and cell lines, whereas class I HDACs had relatively higher copy numbers in tumor cell lines (data not shown). This pattern of expression suggests that class I HDACs might be important regulators of cell proliferation.Previously, deacetylation and transcriptional repression by mSin3A complexes with HDAC1, HDAC2, and Rb-like proteins were found to be important modulators of cellular proliferation, G1 cell cycle arrest as a result of DNA damage, cellular senescence, and contact inhibition (51Hassig C.A.

Rb represses E2F transcription in an HDAC1- and HDAC2-dependent manner through the interaction of IXCXE motifs in HDAC1 and HDAC2 with the LXCXE motif in Rb and/or other A/B pocket proteins (55Dahiya A. Gavin M.R. Luo R.X. Dean D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2001; 20: 6799-6805Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 56Ayer D.E.

The two LXCXE-like motifs found in the C terminus of HDAC10v1 and HDAC10v2 may suggest that HDAC10 variants can bind Rb and other LXCXE or IXCXE motif-containing proteins (for review, see Ref. 56Ayer D.E.

HDAC3, 4, 5, and 7 associate directly through SMRT repressor domains RD2 and RD3, and HDAC1 and HDAC2 interact indirectly through the SMRT RD1 repressor domain that binds mSin3A (58Nagy L. Kao H.Y.

Wang A.H. Yang X.-J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 243-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar,10Fischle W. Kiermer V. Dequiedt F. Verdin E. Biochem. Cell Biol. 2001; 79: 337-348Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). These corepressors mediate the repression of a diverse array of signaling pathways of unliganded DNA-binding nuclear hormone receptors, including thyroid hormone receptor, retinoic acid receptor, orphan nuclear receptors, and antagonist-bound progesterone and estrogen receptors (61Aranda A. Pascual A. Physiol. Rev. 2001; 81: 1269-1304Crossref PubMed Scopus (1163) Google Scholar). NCoR and SMRT also associate with non-nuclear receptor proteins, such as homeodomain proteins Rpx2 and Pit (62Xu L. Lavinsky R.M. Dasen J.S. Flynn S.E. McInerney E.M. Mullen T.M. Heinzel T. Szeto D. Korzus E. Kurokawa R. Aggarwal A.K. Rose D.W. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Nature. 1998; 395: 301-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Aberrant recruitment of the NCoR·HDAC complex by retinoid receptors was found to play a role in the pathogenesis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (63Minucci S. Pelicci P.G. Semin. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 10: 215-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that HDAC10v1 associated with SMRT. Furthermore, HDAC10v1 and HDAC10v2 contain a putative LXXLL motif that might be involved in binding to hormone receptors (47Heery D.M. Kalkhoven E. Hoare S. Parker M.G. Nature. 2001; 387: 733-736Crossref Scopus (1755) Google Scholar, 48McInerney E.M. Rose D.W. Flynn S.E. Westin S. Mullen T.M. Krones A. Inostroza J. Torchia J. Nolte R.T. Assa-Munt N. Milburn M.V. Glass C.K. Rosenfeld M.G. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3357-3368Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Although the flanking sequences around these motifs have been found to be loosely conserved, the flanking sequences in HDAC10 seem to be very different from other known LXXLL motifs. However, HDAC10v1 was found to be associated with HDAC2 and SMRT in complexes and thus, may play a role in transcriptional repression mediated by these complexes.SNPs (for review, see Ref. 33Isakson A. Landegren U. Syvanen A.-C. Bork P. Stein C. Ortigao F. Brookes A.J. Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 2000; 8: 154-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have been found to account for most of the genetic variation among individuals. The SNPs that are thought to be most likely to alter gene function are changes in regulatory and coding regions that generate non-conservative amino acid changes. SNPs are being evaluated as disease markers by associating higher than expected incidences of SNPs in disease-associated genes. Automated alignment and comparison of EST sequences with SNPs data bases are accepted and efficient approaches to SNP identification. The search for SNPs in the coding region of HDAC10 led to the identification of a variable C terminus that may represent a SNP. A nonconservative amino acid change was found at position 588 which causes a change from Gly (GGC) to Cys (TGC) in five samples compared with four wild type samples that all contained Gly at this position. Although the SNP occurs outside of the catalytic domain, catalytic activity and/or protein-protein interactions could be affected by altered folding of HDAC10 molecules as a result of the improper formation of Cys bridges. The effects of this SNP are not yet known, and the consequences of this SNP await further investigation.In summary, this study characterized the genomic structure, tissue distribution, cellular localization, and protein interactions of a catalytically active novel HDAC (HDAC10). The existence of multiple splice variants and RNA transcripts that display different tissue distributions might indicate a potential mechanism for HDAC10 specificity. Furthermore, the association of HDAC10 with HDAC2 and SMRT will enable further studies on the specific function of this HDAC isoform. Chromatin remodelin"
https://openalex.org/W2055271114,"A cadherin family member, prCAD, was identified in retina cDNA by subtractive hybridization and high throughput sequencing. prCAD is expressed only in retinal photoreceptors, and the prCAD protein is localized to the base of the outer segment of both rods and cones. In prCAD(-/-) mice, outer segments are disorganized and fragmented, and there is progressive death of photoreceptor cells. prCAD is unlikely to be involved in protein trafficking between inner and outer segments, since phototransduction proteins appear to be correctly localized and the light responses of both rods and cones are only modestly compromised in prCAD(-/-) mice. These experiments imply a highly specialized cell biological function for prCAD and suggest that localized adhesion activity is essential for outer segment integrity."

Although ROCK, one of Rho's effectors, has been suggested to mediate hypertrophic signals, the relationship of Rho/ROCK with downstream signals is unknown. A zinc finger transcription factor, GATA-4, is activated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and is required for the up-regulation of the endothelin-1 gene during myocardial cell hypertrophy. However, it is unknown whether Rho/ROCK signals are linked to downstream GATA-4. By transient transfection assays using a dominant-negative mutant and an activated derivative of ROCK-I, we showed that ROCK-I participates in GATA-4-dependent endothelin-1 transcription. Inhibition of the Rho/ROCK pathway by Y-27632, a selective inhibitor of ROCK, suppressed phenylephrine-stimulated phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and increased the DNA binding activity of cardiac GATA-4. Interestingly, latrunculin B, which inhibits actin polymerization, also prevents phenylephrine-induced responses. These findings demonstrate that the Rho/ROCK pathway is linked to downstream GATA-4 via the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases during myocardial cell hypertrophy.

Studies focused on elucidating the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of these genes have identified a group of DNA-binding factors that might mediate the nuclear response to hypertrophic stimuli. These factors include the GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors, which mediate transcriptional activation of the genes for β-MHC and angiotensin II type 1a receptor during pressure overload-induced hypertrophy in vivo (7Hasegawa K.

GATA factors are also required for the transcriptional activation of the endothelin-1 (ET-1) gene during the transition from compensation to heart failure (10Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Wada H. Yanazume T. Sasayama S. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13721-13726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). During the hypertrophic process, cardiac GATA-4 is directly or indirectly phosphorylated by extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, which increases the DNA binding ability of GATA-4 (10Morimoto T.

However, the relationship between ERKs/GATA-4 and upstream signaling pathways is unknown. One of the important upstream signaling molecules that mediate hypertrophic responses is the Ras-like small GTPase Rho. Rho plays a critical role in a variety of cytoskeleton-dependent cell functions including actin polymerization, F-actin bundling, myosin-based contractility, focal adhesion formation, and cytokinesis in other cell types (11Leung T.

In cardiac myocytes, activated Rho has profound effects on myofibrillar organization and stimulates c-fos and atrial natriuretic factor expression (16Hoshijima M. Sah V.P. Wang Y. Chien K.R.

Treatment of neonatal rat cardiomyocytes with C3 exoenzyme, which abrogates Rho's effects, suppresses the expression of natriuretic peptide genes induced by ET-1, angiotensin II, and phenylephrine (16Hoshijima M.

Furthermore, dominant-negative Rho attenuates the Gαq- and Ras-induced transcriptional activation of the atrial natriuretic factor gene (19Hines W.A. Thorburn A. J. Mol. Cell.

These results demonstrate that Rho plays an important role in the modulation of cardiac gene expression during hypertrophy that is induced by signaling through Gαq. Recently, several targets of Rho have been identified, including protein kinase N, citron kinase, ROCK-I (p160ROCK), and ROCK-II (Rho kinase) (15Tapon N. Hall A. Curr. Opin.

In the present study, we investigated the linkage between Rho/ROCK and ERK/GATA-4 pathways during myocardial cell hypertrophy. Primary neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes were prepared as previously described (9Morimoto T. Hasegawa K. Kaburagi S. Kakita T. Masutani H. Kitsis R.N. Matsumori A. Sasayama S. J. Biol.

The cardiac myocytes were grown on flask-style chambers with glass slides (Nalgen Nunc, Naperville, IL) and then stimulated with saline or 1.0 × 10−5m of PE in serum-free medium for 48 h. The cells were then fixed with 3% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 15 min at room temperature. Immunocytochemical staining for β-MHC was performed using the indirect immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescense method as previously described (27Kakita T. Hasegawa K. Iwai-Kanai E. Adachi S.

As the primary antibody we used anti-β-MHC polyclonal antibody (NovoCastra Laboratories Ltd., Newcastle, UK) at a dilution of 1:50. A total of 50 myocardial fibers were selected randomly from cardiac myocytes stained with anti-β-MHC antibody, and the diameters of these cells were measured semiautomatically with the aid of an image analyzer (LUZEX 3U; Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) as previously described (29Inada T.

The shortest diameters of β-MHC-stained myocytes were measured at the level of the nucleus. Northern blot analysis of 10 μg of total RNA was performed as described previously (7Hasegawa K. Lee S.J.

For cold competition experiments a 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled competitor oligonucleotide was included in the binding reaction mixture. Protein-DNA complexes were separated by electrophoresis on 4% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels in 0.25× TBE (1× TBE is 100 mm Tris, 100 mm boric acid, and 2 mm EDTA) at 4 °C. Cells were lysed with 2× Laemmli loading buffer (2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.04 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 0.12 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, and 0.28 m β-mercaptoethanol) (150 μl/35-mm dish). Filters were probed with anti-phosphospecific ERK1/2 antibody (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). To normalize for protein loading after immunoprecipitation, blots were stripped by incubation in 62.5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 100 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, and 2% SDS for 30 min at 50 °C, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and 0.05% Tween, and then probed with an antibody that recognizes both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of ERK1/2 (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). For quantitative analysis, color images were obtained as PICT files by a scanner (PM770C, EPSON, Tokyo, Japan) connected to a Quadra 800 (Apple Computer Japan, Inc., Tokyo, Japan). The brightness and contrast of each image file were uniformly enhanced by Adobe Photoshop version 4.0 followed by analysis using NIH Image freeware (Version 1.59; available on the Internet via file transfer protocol from zippy.nimh.nih.gov). The PICT files were opened in gray scale mode with NIH Image. For density determination of Western blotting files, the specific band was selected and the “Measure” command was used. The mean of the integrated density obtained from three independent files was used as a representative value for each band. Data are presented as means ± S.E. Statistical comparisons were performed using unpaired two-tailed Student's t tests or analysis of variance with Scheffe's test where appropriate, with a probability value less than 0.05 taken to indicate significance. An α1-adrenergic agonist, phenylephrine (PE), can activate several independent features of myocardial cell hypertrophy (1Chien K.R. Knowlton K.U. Zhu H. Chien S.

To examine the role of ROCK in the PE-induced hypertrophic response we utilized a specific inhibitor of ROCK, Y-27632. The affinity of this agent for ROCK kinases is at least 20–30 times higher than that for two other Rho effector kinases, citron kinase and protein kinase N (34Ishizaki T. Uehata M. Tamechika I. Keel J. Nonomura K. Maekawa M. Narumiya S. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 57: 976-983PubMed Google Scholar). To evaluate the effects of this specific ROCK inhibitor on the PE-induced hypertrophic response cardiac myocytes were stimulated with saline or 10−5m PE in the presence or absence of 3 μm Y-27632 for 48 h. These cells were then stained with an antibody against β-MHC. As shown in Fig.1 A, brown signals, which indicated the presence of β-MHC, were observed in both saline- and PE-stimulated cardiac myocytes. Cardiac myocytes stimulated with PE displayed increases in cell size and myofibrillar organization as compared with saline-stimulated cells. A therapeutic level of Y-27632 (3 μm) largely inhibited such changes. As shown in Fig.1 B, the myocardial cell diameter was significantly smaller in cells treated with PE plus Y-27632 (bar 6) than in cells treated with PE alone (bar 4). Y-27632 also dose-dependently inhibited the increase of the cell diameter induced by endothelin-1 (compare bars 7,8, and 9), another representative hypertrophic stimulus. However, Y-27632 alone did not affect the myocardial cell diameter in the basal (i.e. in saline-stimulated cardiac myocytes, bars 2 and 3), suggesting that the inhibitory effect of Y-27632 is not simply due to toxicity. We then examined the effects of Y-27632 on the PE-induced expression of cardiac genes encoding β-MHC and atrial natriuretic factor, whose up-regulation is a well established marker for myocardial cell hypertrophy. As shown in Fig. 2, Y-27632 (3 μm) significantly inhibited the induction of β-MHC and atrial natriuretic factor gene expression by PE. However, Y-27632 alone did not affect the basal expression of these genes. The expression of the ubiquitously and constitutively expressed GAPDH gene was not affected by PE or Y-27632. Taken together, these data demonstrate that a therapeutic concentration of Y-27632 can selectively suppress the PE-induced hypertrophic response.Figure 2Northern analysis of the expression of endogenous β- MHC , ANF , and GAPDH genes. Neonatal rat ventricular cardiac myocytes were incubated with saline or PE (1.0 × 10−5m) in the presence or absence of Y-27632 (3 μm) for 48 h.

We next examined the effect of Y-27632 on PE-induced activation of ET-1 promoter activities. We transfected 2.0 μg of CAT cDNA driven by the 204-bp rat ET-1 promoter (pETCAT) into cultured neonatal rat cardiac myocytes. A small quantity of pRSVluc (0.1 μg) was co-transfected to normalize for transfection efficiency. Stimulation of these cells with PE increased the relative CAT expression from pETCAT by 2.97 ± 0.21-fold (n = 3) compared with saline-stimulated cells, which is in agreement with our previous report (10Morimoto T.

Y-27632 significantly inhibited the PE-stimulated increase inET-1 promoter activity (p < 0.05, 78% decrease compared with PE stimulation, 1.44 ± 0.04-fold compared with saline stimulation, n = 3) whereas Y-27632 alone did not affect the activity in saline-stimulated cardiac myocytes (1.36 ± 0.11-fold compared with saline stimulation,n = 3). These findings suggest that this agent specifically blocks α1-adrenergic signaling in cardiac myocytes.

Corneodesmosin is a secreted glycoprotein located in the corneodesmosomal core and covalently linked to the cornified envelope of corneocytes. Its glycine- and serine-rich NH2-terminal domain may fold to give structural motifs similar to the glycine loops described in epidermal cytokeratins and loricrin and proposed to display adhesive properties. A chimeric protein comprising human corneodesmosin linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse E-cadherin was expressed in mouse fibroblasts to test the ability of corneodesmosin to promote cell-cell adhesion.

To assess the involvement of the glycine loop domain in adhesion, full-length corneodesmosin, corneodesmosin lacking this domain, or this domain alone were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and tested for protein-protein interactions by overlay binding assays.

In the course of their differentiation program, epidermal keratinocytes undergo cornification, a complex set of biochemical events associated with major morphological modifications, resulting in their transformation into corneocytes. Corneocytes, devoid of tripartite plasma membrane, are limited by a highly cross-linked insoluble protein shell, the cornified envelope (1Simon M. Leigh I. Lane E. Watt F. The Keratinocyte Handbook. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK1994: 275-292Google Scholar, 2Roop D. Science. 1995; 267: 474-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (174) Google Scholar, 3Steinert P.M. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 151: F5-F7Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Cornification induces structural modifications of the keratinocyte desmosomes, including the disappearance of the cytoplasmic plaque that is incorporated in the cornified envelope, and the densification of the desmoglea. However, the mechanisms underlying their transformation into corneodesmosomes are still poorly understood. Corneodesmosomes mediate the strong intercellular cohesion in the cornified layers that is crucial for the physical and chemical barrier function of the epidermis. Ultimately, they are degraded at the time of desquamation (4Egelrud T. Loden M. Maibach H.I. Dry Skin and Moisturizers: Chemistry and Function. CRC Press, New York2000: 109-117Google Scholar). Human corneodesmosin (Cdsn), 1The abbreviations used are:CdsncorneodesmosinE-cadE-cadherinGSTglutathioneS-transferasemAbmonoclonal antibodyPBSphosphate-buffered salineHBSSHanks' balance salt solution a 52- to 56-kDa basic glycoprotein specific to the cornified epithelia and the inner root sheath of the hair follicles, is firstly detected in the secretory vesicles (i.e. keratinosomes) of the keratinocytes of the uppermost spinous layer and granular layer. It is also present in the extracellular part of the granular keratinocyte desmosomes and remains in these structures after their transformation into corneodesmosomes. In the cornified layers, Cdsn is covalently linked to the cornified envelope (5Haftek M. Serre G. Mils V. Thivolet J. J. Histochem.

This feature is shared with several epidermal proteins: filaggrin, the intermediate filament-associated protein that participates in the formation of the corneocyte fibrous matrix; loricrin, a major component of the cornified envelope; and both termini of epidermal cytokeratins. The serine- and glycine-rich domains of cytokeratins and loricrin have been proposed, as a consequence of the association of interspersed aromatic or aliphatic residues, to form structural motifs, the so-called “glycine loops,” that would mediate intermolecular adhesion by acting like a Velcro (8Steinert P.M.

Two mutations in cytokeratin genes affecting glycine loop coding sequences were recently shown to be associated with human skin diseases (9Terrinoni A. Puddu P. Didona B., De Laurenzi V. Candi E.

These data reinforce the hypothesis that cytokeratin glycine loops are required for normal intermediate filament organization and function. In Cdsn, serine and glycine residues are distributed all along the sequence but represent more than half of the amino acids within three regions. One of them, from amino acid 60 to 171, perfectly matches features of Steinert's glycine loop model, and could confer adhesive properties to Cdsn. This hypothesis is supported by the subcellular location of the protein. Here, we report that human Cdsn actually is an adhesive molecule. Indeed, when expressed at the surface of mouse fibroblasts, Cdsn mediates homophilic cell aggregation. Using full-length and truncated forms of recombinant Cdsn in protein-protein interaction experiments, we confirm that Cdsn self-associates and we demonstrate for the first time that a glycine loop domain displays adhesive properties in vitro. The eucaryotic pBATEM2 expression vector for full-length mouse E-cadherin (E-cad) (11Nose A. Nagafuchi A. Takeichi M. Cell. 1988; 54: 993-1001Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (556) Google Scholar) and the empty pBATNeo vector were gifts from Dr. M. Takeichi (Kyoto, Japan). The p14.9 plasmid, a derivative of pcDNA.1 containing the complete coding sequence of human Cdsn was as described (12Guerrin M. Simon M. Montézin M. Haftek M. Vincent C. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22640-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). To construct an expression vector for a Cdsn/E-cad fusion protein, the portion of E-cad sequence encoding the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains (nucleotides 2172–2721, GenBankTM accession number X06115.1) was amplified by PCR from pBATEM2 using the following primers 5′-GCTCTAGACCTAGTCGTCCTCGCCACC-3′ and 5′-CCGGATATCGTGGCAGCAGGATTGCAA-3′. After digestion withEcoRV and XbaI, the PCR product was cloned between the corresponding sites of p14.9, to give the plasmid pCH1 encoding a fusion protein comprising amino acids 1–501 of human Cdsn fused to amino acids 702–905 of mouse E-cad (Fig. 1 a). The portion of the Cdsn cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 117–1609 (GenBankTM accession number AF030130) was amplified with the primers S117UBam (5′-CCGGATCCATTGGCACCTTCTCAGACC-3′) and S1609LEco (5′-CCGGAATTCCGGTTGACTTATGGACTGTCG-3′). After digestion withBamHI and EcoRI, the PCR product was cloned between the corresponding sites of pGEX-2T (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.) to give the plasmid pGEX-CdsnΔ33 encoding glutathioneS-transferase (GST) fused to Cdsn amino acids 34–529 (Fig.5 a). The plasmid pGEX-CdsnΔ93, encoding GST fused to Cdsn amino acids 94–529, was obtained from pGEX-CdsnΔ33 by digestion withBamHI and ligation. To construct the plasmid pGEX-CdsnΔ61–171, a PCR mutagenesis strategy was used as previously described (13Allen E., Yu, Q.-C. Fuchs E. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 1367-1382Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). A PCR product was generated from p14.9 using the primer S117UBam and a chimeric primer corresponding to Cdsn nucleotides 177–194 linked to nucleotides 528–545, resulting in deletion of the sequence encoding amino acids 61–171. The PCR product was purified and used as a primer, together with primer S1609LEco, in a new round of amplification, and the obtained product digested withBamHI/EcoRI was inserted in the corresponding sites of pGEX-2T to give pGEX-CdsnΔ61–171 encoding GST fused to amino acids 34–60/172–529 of Cdsn. To produce a GST fusion protein with the NH2-terminal glycine loop domain of Cdsn, a PCR fragment comprising Cdsn nucleotides 195–527 was amplified from p14.9 using the primers S195USma 5′-CGCCCGGGAGACTCCAGCTTCAGTAGC-3′ and S527LEco 5′-CCGGAATTCACCCTACTTGGAAGCTGCTGC-3′. After digestion withSmaI and EcoRI, the PCR product was cloned between the corresponding sites of pGEX-2T to give pGEX-Cdsn60–171 encoding GST fused to amino acids 60–171 of Cdsn. Each plasmid insert was verified by sequencing. Escherichia coli strain BL21-Codon Plus (DE3+)-RIL (Stratagene) was transformed with the various procaryotic expression plasmids, and recombinant proteins were purified from bacterial lysates using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). L cells (ATCC CCL-1) obtained from American Type Culture Collection were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/Ham's F12 medium supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Cells cultured in 35-mm dishes were transfected with 1 μg of plasmid DNA and 6 μl of FuGENE (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To generate stable cell lines, cells were split 1:10 48 h after transfection and cultured in 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). Individual G418-resistant colonies were isolated after 10–12 days of culture. For transient transfection experiments, cells grown on glass coverslips were transfected as described above and fixed 48 h after transfection. The immunoblot analysis was performed as previously described (7Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J. Serre G. J. Biol.

Peroxidase-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG (Biosys) were revealed with the ECL immunoblotting kit (Amersham Biosciences, Inc.). L cells growing on glass coverslips were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min at room temperature and, when indicated, permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min at the same temperature. Cells were analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence as previously described (6Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Reano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). mAbs were used at 2.5 μg/ml, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse IgG goat immunoglobulin Fab fragments (Biosys) were diluted to 1:200. Cells were released from the substrate with 1 mm EDTA in Hanks' balanced salt solution (HBSS, Invitrogen), centrifuged for 5 min at 1000 rpm and re-suspended in HBSS containing either 1 mm EDTA, or 0.05% trypsin and 1 mm CaCl2, or 0.05% trypsin and 1 mm EDTA. After a 15-min incubation at 37 °C, soybean trypsin inhibitor (1X) (v/v) (Sigma-Aldrich) was added, and the cells were analyzed for E-cad or Cdsn/E-cad expression by immunoblot. Cells were released from the substrate as described above, washed three times in HBSS containing 1% bovine serum albumin, and resuspended at 5 × 105 per ml in the same buffer supplemented with 1 mmCaCl2 or 1 mm EDTA. 106 cells were incubated in 35-mm untreated polystyrene dishes (Evergreen Scientific) with gentle shaking (75 rpm) at room temperature. After various incubation periods, cells were fixed at room temperature by addition of 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS, observed by phase-contrast microscopy, and photographed. For quantitative analysis, the particle number at time zero (N 0) and at timet (N t) was determined with a hemacytometer, and aggregation was quantified by theN t/N 0 ratio. Co-aggregation of wild-type L cells mixed at a 1/1 ratio with a stable pCH1-transfected clone was performed after labeling either of these cells using the PKH26 red fluorescent cell linker kit (Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer's procedure. Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. After 30 min of blocking in TBSTL (40 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 2.5% skimmed dry milk), membranes were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with the recombinant proteins diluted in TBSTL. Proteins adsorbed on the membranes were specifically revealed with an appropriate anti-Cdsn antibody: G36-19 mAb at 0.2 μg/ml that recognizes amino acids 306–309 (12Guerrin M. Simon M. Montézin M. Haftek M. Vincent C. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22640-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar) or an affinity-purified polyclonal antibody directed against Cdsn amino acids 40–55 (antiserum A40–55) at 4.2 μg/ml, produced and characterized as described previously (14Simon M. Jonca N. Guerrin M. Haftek M. Bernard D. Caubet C. Egelrud T. Schmidt R. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To study the potential role of Cdsn in homophilic cell-cell interactions in L cells, we expressed a chimeric protein comprising the human Cdsn and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains of mouse E-cadherin (E-cad) (Fig. 1 a). The rationale of this approach was first that Cdsn is tightly linked to corneodesmosomes and, second, that Cdsn expressed by transfected HeLa cells is secreted in the culture medium and is not localized on desmosomes (12Guerrin M. Simon M. Montézin M. Haftek M. Vincent C. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22640-22647Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). In the present experiments, L cells were chosen, because they do not express any cadherins and do not present junctional structures such as desmosomes. Moreover, they were previously used to demonstrate the adhesive properties of cadherins after transfection with the corresponding cDNAs (reviewed in Ref. 15Takeichi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar), showing that they express the intracellular proteins necessary for cadherin to mediate cell adhesion. To check for the expression and location of Cdsn/E-cad fusion protein, indirect immunofluorescence was performed with the anti-Cdsn G36-19 and the anti-E-cad C20820 mAbs. L cells transfected with the Cdsn/E-cad expression vector displayed clear labeling at the cell periphery with the G36-19 mAb, in the absence of permeabilization. On the contrary, with the C20820 mAb labeling was only observed with permeabilized cells (Fig. 1 b). These results suggested that the fusion protein was properly expressed at the cell surface, with the Cdsn moiety exposed to the extracellular space. Expression of the Cdsn/E-cad in four stable L cell clones was then analyzed by immunoblot (Fig. 1 c). Cdsn/E-cad was detected with either G36-19 or C20820 as an 80-kDa polypeptide, in agreement with its expected molecular mass. The irrelevant MOPC-21 mAb gave no signal (data not shown). Clones pCH1-45 and pCH1-47 expressed Cdsn/E-cad at a higher level than clones pCH1-76 and pCH1-86, and were thus selected for further experiments. To confirm the presence of Cdsn/E-cad at the cell surface of stable clones, we performed trypsin treatment experiments. pCH1-45 cells were incubated in HBSS containing either trypsin and Ca2+, trypsin and EDTA, or EDTA alone as a control. The trypsin sensitivity of the fusion protein was analyzed by immunoblot using C20820 mAb. As expected, the protein remained intact after incubation with EDTA alone. Interestingly, the full-length Cdsn/E-cad was degraded by trypsin both in the presence and the absence of Ca2+ (Fig. 1 d, left panel). In agreement with the prediction of 12 Cdsn tryptic fragments, the anti-Cdsn G36-19 mAb gave no signal after trypsin digestion (data not shown). When control experiments were performed with a stable clone of L cells (LEC3) expressing E-cad, the full-length protein was proteolyzed only in the presence of trypsin and EDTA (Fig.1 d, right panel), in full agreement with previous data showing that classic cadherins are resistant to tryptic degradation in the presence of Ca2+ (15Takeichi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). Taken together, these immunohistochemical and immunoblot experiments established that Cdsn/E-cad was correctly expressed at the cell surface with the expected orientation. Moreover, its full sensitivity to trypsin in non-permeabilized cells showed that none was retained in intracellular membrane compartments. To assess the ability of Cdsn/E-cad to mediate intercellular adhesion, we used a standard cell aggregation assay. After a 2-h incubation in the presence of 1 mmCaCl2, clones pCH1-45 and pCH1-47 formed aggregates (Fig.2, a and b), whereas the non-transfected cells remained segregated (Fig.2 c). Under the same conditions, the cells expressing the full-length E-cad also formed aggregates, which were, however, distinctly larger than those observed with the fusion protein (Fig.2 d). Moreover, from quantification of the aggregates, it was clear that Cdsn/E-cad fusion protein was less effective to promote aggregation than the full-length E-cad (Fig. 4, compare pCH1-45 full line and LEC3 full line). Although these data showed that Cdsn/E-cad can mediate cell adhesion, they did not establish that homophilic interactions between the Cdsn extracellular moieties were involved. It was indeed conceivable that cell adhesion is mediated by a heterophilic interaction between Cdsn and a cell-surface protein of the L cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, we performed experiments of co-aggregation between cells expressing Cdsn/E-cad and the parental L cells. In a first series of experiments, transfected cells were labeled with the PKH26 red fluorescent dye and allowed to aggregate in the presence of an identical number of unlabeled parental L cells (Fig. 3,a and b). Under these conditions, the main body of the aggregates was composed of labeled cells only, although occasional unlabeled cells could be observed at the periphery (arrows in Fig. 3 a). Control experiments performed only with transfected cells showed that all the cells were labeled and that the labeling did not affect their aggregation (Fig. 3,c and d). In converse experiments, labeled parental cells were mixed with unlabeled transfected cells (Fig. 3,e and f). Under these conditions, the aggregates were devoid of labeled cells (arrows in Fig. 3 e), although mixed clusters of small size were occasionally observed (arrowhead in Fig. 3 e). A control experiment performed with labeled parental cells alone (Fig. 3, g andh) showed that the labeling did not promote cell aggregation. Taken together, these experiments show that L cells expressing Cdsn/E-cad selectively aggregate with each other, but not with the parental L cells. They strongly suggest that aggregation is mediated by homophilic interactions of the Cdsn extracellular domain of the fusion protein, rather than by heterophilic interactions of the Cdsn moiety with a normal endogenous membrane component of L cells. However, we cannot exclude the unlikely possibility that expression of the chimeric protein induces the expression of a cell surface protein, which actually displays the adhesion.Figure 4Ca2+ depletion does not strongly influence Cdsn-mediated aggregation. The cells were incubated in the presence of either 1 mm CaCl2(continuous lines) or 1 mm EDTA (dashed lines) for up to 4 h. Quantification of the aggregation was performed at various times of incubation. Each pointrepresents an average ratio from four independent experiments, andvertical bars indicate the S.D. Ca2+ depletion has only little effect on the aggregation mediated by Cdsn/E-cad, whereas it strongly inhibits the aggregation of LEC3 cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3Cdsn mediates homophilic aggregation.Single-cell suspensions of labeled pCH1-45 cells were allowed to aggregate either in the presence (a, b) or in the absence (c, d) of an equal number of unlabeled parental L cells. Conversely, labeled parental cells were incubated either in the presence (e, f) or in the absence (g, h) of an equal number of unlabeled pCH1-45 cells. After 2 h, the cells were observed under the microscope. The same fields are shown under phase-contrast (left panels) and fluorescence (right panels) microscopy. In co-aggregation assays, aggregates are almost entirely composed of pCH1-45 cells. Scale bar, 50 μm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Cellular adhesion mediated by classic cadherins is strictly Ca2+-dependent (15Takeichi M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 237-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar). It was therefore interesting to investigate whether this also holds true for Cdsn/ E-cad. In a quantitative aggregation test performed with L cells expressing the fusion protein, only a faint but reproducible decrease in adhesive properties was observed when the cells were incubated without Ca2+ but in the presence of 1 mm EDTA. As an example, a 20% decrease in aggregation was noticed after a 4-h incubation in the absence of Ca2+ (Fig.4). This weak effect is most probably due, at least in part, to a deleterious effect of EDTA. In the same conditions, the aggregation of L cells expressing full-length E-cad was, as expected, strongly inhibited by Ca2+ depletion (a 70% decrease), whereas parental L cells did not aggregate in the presence or in the absence of Ca2+. Therefore, Cdsn-mediated cell aggregation is largely Ca2+-independent, in strong contrast with that mediated by E-cad. To reinforce the results obtained with the fibroblast model, we investigated biochemically the homophilic interactions of Cdsn. To do so, overlay binding assays were performed with purified GST-Cdsn recombinant proteins (Fig. 5 a). The GST-CdsnΔ93 protein, lacking the NH2-terminal epitope recognized by the antiserum A40–55, was resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was then incubated with the GST-CdsnΔ33 protein, corresponding to the full-length form devoid of the signal peptide, as a probe. Binding of the probe onto its target adsorbed on the membrane was specifically revealed with the antiserum A40–55. A dose-dependent interaction between GST-CdsnΔ93 and GST-CdsnΔ33 was clearly observed (Fig. 5 b). When the binding assay was repeated using GST rather than GST-CdsnΔ93 as the target, no signal was observed, showing that the interaction between GST-CdsnΔ93 and GST-CdsnΔ33 was not mediated by GST interactions (Fig. 5 b). In additional experiments, no interactions were detected between the GST-CdsnΔ33 probe and a recombinant GST-human filaggrin produced as previously described (16Girbal-Neuhauser E. Durieux J.-J. Arnaud M. Dalbon P. Sebbag M. Vincent C. Simon M. Senshu T. Masson-Bessière C. Jolivet-Reynaud C. Jolivet M. Serre G. J. Immunol. 1999; 162: 585-594PubMed Google Scholar) or bovine serum albumin (data not shown). The former control was particularly relevant, because filaggrin, like Cdsn, is a serine- and glycine-rich protein but is devoid of glycine loop domains. The NH2-terminal serine- and glycine-rich domain of Cdsn (amino acids 60–171) presents a series of serine and glycine repeats that could fold into glycine loops likely to mediate intermolecular interactions as proposed for cytokeratins and loricrin (8Steinert P.M. Mack J.W. Korge B.P. Gan S.Q. Haynes H.R. Steven A.C. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). We therefore wondered whether this domain of Cdsn was necessary and sufficient for homophilic interactions in the protein overlay binding assay. Only a low signal was detected after incubation of the GST-CdsnΔ93 target with increasing concentrations of GST-Cdsn protein lacking the NH2-terminal glycine loop domain (Fig.5 c). This result establishes that deletion of this domain dramatically reduces Cdsn homophilic interaction in the overlay binding assay. To determine if this domain was sufficient, recombinant GST-Cdsn60–171, containing only the NH2-terminal glycine loop domain of Cdsn (Fig. 5 a), was used as the target in the protein binding assay. Binding was revealed in the test using the anti-Cdsn G36-19 mAb. Strong signals were obtained with the GST-CdsnΔ33 and GST-CdsnΔ93 probes (Fig. 5 d). Deletion of the NH2-terminal domain in the probe strongly reduced the interaction with the GST-Cdsn60–171 target, but a significant interaction was still detected. Taken together, these data confirm the homophilic interaction properties of Cdsn previously suggested by the cellular aggregation test. They further show that, in vitro, the NH2-terminal glycine loop domain is sufficient to interact with the full-length mature form of Cdsn. However, this domain is not strictly necessary, because its deletion strongly reduced but did not abolish the interaction. Cdsn homophilic interaction is probably mediated by a direct interaction between the NH2-terminal domains of two Cdsn molecules, and by a minor, but significant interaction between the NH2-terminal domain and another region of the protein. Serine and glycine represent more than 50% of the residues in two other parts of the molecule, from amino acids 193 to 249 and 375 to 465. These large domains may contribute to the homophilic interaction, even if they do not perfectly fulfill the criteria defined by Steinert et al. (8Steinert P.M. Mack J.W. Korge B.P. Gan S.Q. Haynes H.R. Steven A.C. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar), i.e.that at least two consecutive loops must be formed by the association of aromatic residues. Glycine loops are also present in other epidermal proteins (i.e. cytokeratins and loricrin) and thus may have a general function in intermolecular interactions. The functional model based on the Velcro hypothesis was proposed by Steinert et al. (8Steinert P.M. Mack J.W. Korge B.P. Gan S.Q. Haynes H.R. Steven A.C. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 130-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) in two epidermal scenarios: (i) interactions between the glycine loops of adjacent cytokeratin molecules may form the basis for adaptable intra-cytoskeletal interactions and participate in cytokeratin intermediate filament assembly, and (ii) the glycine loops of cytokeratins could interact with similar structures in loricrin, linking cornified envelope to the intracellular fibrous matrix. Although direct evidence for the involvement of glycine loops in protein-protein interactions is still lacking in vivo, two mutations located in glycine loop coding sequence of cytokeratin genes were recently reported to be associated with human skin diseases. The first one results in a 4-amino acid deletion in the NH2-terminal domain of cytokeratin K16, including an aromatic residue potentially involved in the formation of a glycine loop. This mutation was responsible for a particular form of palmoplantar keratoderma, a disease characterized by marked hyperkeratosis (9Terrinoni A. Puddu P. Didona B., De Laurenzi V. Candi E. Smith F.J.D. McLean I. Melino G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2000; 114: 1136-1140Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The second mutation described in the cytokeratin K1 gene (KRT1) is responsible for a severe form of epidermal hyperkeratosis known as ichthyosis hystrix Curth-Macklin. This mutation leads to the expression of a cytokeratin K1 form with a mutated tail variable domain. This V2 domain presents, instead of the unique glycine-rich motifs and flexible structure characteristic for wild type K1, a highly hydrophobic region probably folded in a globular structure. Expression of the mutated cytokeratin K1 results in a profound abnormality of the cytoskeletal architecture (10Sprecher E. Ishida-Yamamoto A. Becker O.M. Mearekov L. Miller C.J. Steinert P.M. Neldner K. Richard G. J. Invest. Dermatol. 2001; 116: 511-519Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). Our present experimental evidence for glycine loop homophilic binding in vitro supports the relevance of Steinert's model and provides functional data for the involvement of glycine loops in intermolecular adhesion. Cdsn has been shown by immunoelectron microscopy to be linked to the corneodesmosomal zone of cornified envelopes previously extracted using high concentrations of urea, SDS and dithiothreitol, and boiling (6Serre G. Mils V. Haftek M. Vincent C. Croute F. Reano A. Ouhayoun J.-P. Bettinger S. Soleilhavoup J.-P. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1991; 97: 1061-1072Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, after trypsin digestion, these envelopes were shown to contain Cdsn-derived peptides corresponding to the central domain of the molecule (7Simon M. Montézin M. Guerrin M. Durieux J.-J.

Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). These data show that Cdsn is covalently linked to corneodesmosomes and cornified cell envelopes. We presently show that Cdsn exhibits homophilic adhesive properties. Taken together, our previous and present results strongly suggest that Cdsn acts as a cell-cell adhesion molecule in vivo. Cdsn undergoes a sequential proteolytic cleavage during maturation of corneocytes, and this event seems to be a major prerequisite for desquamation (17Lundström A. Serre G. Haftek M. Egelrud T. Arch. Dermatol. Res. 1994; 286: 369-375Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). In the cornified layers, both Cdsn NH2and COOH extremities are sequentially degraded. Finally, only the central part of Cdsn, approximately from amino acids 300 to 425, probably devoid of adhesive properties, is present at the surface of detached corneocytes (14Simon M. Jonca N. Guerrin M. Haftek M. Bernard D. Caubet C. Egelrud T. Schmidt R. Serre G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 20292-20299Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). This recent finding further supports the hypothesis that the adhesive properties of Cdsn are essential for corneodesmosome function and emphasizes the physiological importance of the NH2-terminal glycine loop domain in Cdsn function. Besides Cdsn, the only components of the corneodesmosome core identified to date are the extracellular domains of the desmosomal cadherins (i.e. desmoglein 1 and desmocollin 1). Together with Cdsn, they may be crucial for mediating the strong intercellular cohesion of corneocytes. Unlike the desmosomal cadherins, Cdsn has the unique feature of being secreted. The extracellular domain of desmosomal cadherins are obvious candidates for Cdsn attachment to the desmosomes, but this remains to be established. Its distribution in the epidermis, as well as its genomic location at the human major histocompatibility complex locus (6p21), make Cdsn a good candidate in susceptibility to familial psoriasis, an inflammatory skin disease with impaired desquamation and hyperkeratosis. Genetic associations between polymorphic positions of the CDSN gene and susceptibility to psoriasis were recently reported (18Allen M.H. Veal C. Faassen A. Powis S.H. Vaughan R.W. Trembath R.C.

There is essentially no free copper in the cytoplasm ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (1Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar), and it is anticipated that this applies to other cells. It has become apparent that copper metallochaperones assist in the delivery of copper ions to target proteins (such as superoxide dismutase) or to target compartments, encouraging advantageous copper-protein partnerships while inhibiting others en route (reviewed in Refs. 2O'Halloran T.V.

It is feasible that the lack of intracellular compartments in most prokaryotes (with the crucial exception of most cyanobacteria) circumvents a requirement for a network of copper metallochaperones (2O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), although Enterococcus hirae contains an ATX1-like protein, CopZ, which is implicated in efficient copper perception by the transcriptional regulator CopY (13Odermatt A. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent studies have allowed the formulation of hypotheses about how copper is released from metallochaperones, but it is less clear how and/or where copper metallochaperones acquire copper.Cyanobacteria are believed to occupy an evolutionary transition in the use of copper, the photosynthetic generation of dioxygen having liberated this element from inorganic sulfides and made it available for uptake and recruitment in emergent proteins (14Fraústo da Silva J.R.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1991: 11-20Google Scholar). Photosynthetic electron transport occurs at internal thylakoid membranes in higher plant chloroplasts and in most cyanobacteria includingSynechocystis PCC 6803. It is possible to monitor copper trafficking to this internal compartment (with substantial copper requirements) in vivo in some of these organisms (15Tottey S. Rich P.R. Rondet S.A.M. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19999-20004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Within the thylakoid lumen is the soluble copper protein plastocyanin, which shuttles electrons between membranous photosystems (reviewed in Ref. 16Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the pivotal role of plastocyanin in the primary conversion of light to chemical energy within the biosphere, it has been largely neglected in studies of the intracellular trafficking of copper by metallochaperones. Thylakoid membranes ofSynechocystis PCC 6803 are also a site of respiratory electron transport (17Dworsky A. Mayer B. Regelsberger G. Fromwald S. Peschek G.A. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1995; 38: 35-43Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and copper must be supplied to the CuA and the intramembranous CuB, sites of cytochrome oxidase.The target for ATX1 in S. cerevisiae is CCC2 (12Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), a Golgi-localized variant P-type ATPase (18Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem.

Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). We recently described two such copper transporters inSynechocystis PCC 6803, CtaA and PacS, both of which are required for efficient switching to the use of copper in plastocyanin rather than heme iron in cytochrome c 6 for photosynthetic electron transport (15Tottey S. Rich P.R. Rondet S.A.M. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19999-20004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Disruption of ctaAalso reduced the total amount of copper cell−1, whereas disruption of pacS conferred copper sensitivity. The presence of two CPx-type ATPases, one contributing to copper import as well as one contributing to copper compartmentalization, makes this an attractive model in which to study the action of any putative ATX1-like copper metallochaperone in relation to understanding the mechanisms of copper acquisition and release. This organism contains two additional CPx-type ATPases, ZiaA and CoaT, which are known to be expressed in response to and required for growth in (elevated) zinc (27Thelwell C. Robinson N.J. Turner-Cavet J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 10728-10733Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar) and cobalt (29Rutherford J.C. Cavet J.S. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 25827-25832Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), respectively, highlighting questions about how structurally related transporters discern and select different metals from a common cytosol. Metallochaperones have not previously been documented in an organism containing CPx-type ATPases with differing metal specificities.The cytosolic N-terminal region of CCC2 contains two domains that form a structure (βαββαβ ferredoxin-like fold) similar to the small (73 amino acids) soluble ATX1, with CCC2 and ATX1 possessing complementary acidic and basic surfaces (30Banci L. Bertini I. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 8415-8426Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Both proteins contain the motif MXCXXC (X represents any amino acid) required for metal binding and implicated in the formation of bridged heterodimeric sites during copper transfer from ATX1 to CCC2. The thermodynamic gradient for copper transfer in vitro from ATX1 to an isolated amino-terminal domain of CCC2 is shallow (31Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 18611-18613Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar), raising questions about whether copper transfer is vectoral in vivo and, if so, how? Open reading frame (ORF) 1The abbreviations used are:ORFopen reading framePMPSp-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulfonate 1The abbreviations used are:ORFopen reading framePMPSp-(hydroxymercuri)phenylsulfonate ssr2857from the fully sequenced genome of Synechocystis PCC 6803 (32Kaneko T.

Several features (described above) suggest that this could be a valuable organism for studying copper metallochaperones, and the initial aim of this research was therefore to establish whether or not the product ofssr2857 interacts with amino-terminal regions of PacS and/or CtaA to shuttle copper to the thylakoid. Our data support this, andssr2857 is designated atx1 although the target compartment, the proteins supplied, and the metal-binding motif are distinct from eukaryotic ATX1.We describe the production of mutants of Synechocystis PCC 6803 deficient in atx1, alone and in combination withpacS or ctaA. Their phenotypes (i) show that the action of atx1 is positive with respect to copper-dependent thylakoid redox processes, (ii) show that CtaA is not obligatory for Atx1 function, and (iii) are consistent with Atx1 acting solely in the same pathway as PacS. We report in vitro analyses of the copper binding properties ofSynechocystis PCC 6803 Atx1 and its capacity to exchange copper with the amino-terminal region of PacS. We have exploited a bacterial two-hybrid system to show in vivo interaction between Synechocystis PCC 6803 Atx1 and the amino-terminal region of PacS and a requirement for the CXXC motif of Atx1 for such interaction. An in vivo interaction between Atx1 and the amino-terminal region of CtaA was also detected. Optional copper acquisition from the importer would imply reversal of the vector for transfer between Atx1 and the different cytosolic N-terminal regions of the two ATPases. Comparative modeling of these domains therefore provides insight into the mechanisms that can facilitate transfer. Finally, we report a lack of in vivo interaction between Atx1 and amino-terminal regions of ZiaA and CoaT. This is the first example of discriminatory target recognition by a metallochaperone coinciding with discriminatory specificity of metal transport by CPx-type ATPases.DISCUSSIONSeveral lines of evidence (Figs. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) support a role forSynechocystis PCC 6803 Atx1 in the delivery of copper via PacS to the thylakoid, providing copper for proteins involved in photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport. It remains to be reported whether or not analogous proteins target copper to thylakoidal plastocyanin in plant chloroplasts. That atx1 is required for optimal cytochrome oxidase activity in a ΔctaAbackground (Fig. 4) implies that Atx1 can acquire copper from other locations, although it clearly does also interact with CtaA (Fig. 2). It is proposed that bacterial Atx1, and by analogy some eukaryotic copper metallochaperones, contribute toward the efficient reuse of cell copper by scavenging from weak cytosolic sites. Structural models of bacterial Atx1, PacSN, and CtaAN suggest mechanisms of ligand exchange, which, though subtly different, provide support to those proposed for copper release from eukaryotic ATX1. The absence of any detectable interaction between Atx1 and the amino-terminal regions of ZiaA and CoaT (Fig. 2) illustrates a contribution of protein-protein interactions in determining metal specificity, i.e. which metals go to which locations within a cell.Mutants deficient in PacS are impaired in switching from the use of heme iron in cytochrome c 6 to the use of copper in plastocyanin for photosynthetic electron transport, which is thought to result from a loss of thylakoid copper import by PacS (15Tottey S. Rich P.R. Rondet S.A.M. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19999-20004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Here we also show loss of cytochrome oxidase activity in ΔpacS(Fig. 4). The association of similar phenotypes with atx1coupled with the observation that Atx1 can interact in vivowith (Fig. 2) and transfer copper in vitro to (Fig. 3) PacSN supports a model in which Atx1 delivers copper to PacS for thylakoid import (Fig.6 A). This model is analogous to the delivery of copper to Golgi-localized CCC2 by ATX1 in S. cerevisiae, even though one of the proteins indirectly supplied by Atx1 in Synechocystis PCC 6803, cytochrome oxidase, is a target for the mitochondrial copper metallochaperone COX17 in S. cerevisiae (reviewed in Ref. 2O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). PacS appears to be the sole route for Atx1-bound copper to reach cytochrome oxidase because the genes are not additive (Fig. 4). As noted by others (2O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), it remains to be reported whether or not the other analyzed bacterial copper metallochaperone, CopZ, interacts in vivo with the amino-terminal regions of CPx-type ATPases, CopA and CopB. Where do copper metallochaperones acquire copper? Mutants deficient in CtaA accumulate less copper and, similar to ΔpacS, show phenotypes associated with impaired copper supply to plastocyanin and cytochrome oxidase, consistent with CtaA acting as the principal copper importer at the plasma membrane (15Tottey S. Rich P.R. Rondet S.A.M. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19999-20004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). It is significant that CtaA is not obligatory for Atx1 function (Fig. 4). This implies that Atx1 scavenges copper from other sources, either in the cytosol or from secondary importers (Fig. 6 B). An attractive hypothesis is that Atx1 recycles endogenous copper, perhaps from degraded metalloproteins or otherwise associated with adventitious copper-binding sites in the cytosol (Fig. 6 B). The severe phenotype of Δatx1ΔctaA would result from loss of both the principal importer and endogenous recycling of copper.Figure 6The direct and indirect targets for Atx1 inSynechocystis PCC 6803, sites of copper acquisition and structural predictions. A, the arrows on the model represent Atx1 interacting with and donating copper to the cytosolic amino-terminal domain of thylakoid membrane-localized PacS leading to copper import into the thylakoid. Copper is thereby supplied to plastocyanin (PC) located within the thylakoid lumen and cytochrome oxidase (CO) in thylakoid membranes.B, additivity of ctaA and atx1indicates that Atx1 can acquire copper from locations other than CtaA, either scavenging and recycling copper from adventitious sites within the cytosol (Adv.) or possibly interacting with secondary copper importers. Atx1 can interact with the cytosolic amino-terminal domain of CtaA, and the dotted arrow indicates hypothetical but unproven copper transfer from CtaA to Atx1. C, Atx1 does not interact (crossed lines) with either the truncated cytosolic amino-terminal region of CoaT or the amino-terminal region of ZiaA. The latter is composed of a histidine-rich HXH region and a region with similarity to amino-terminal domains of CtaA and PacS and containing a metal-binding motif GMXCXXC. The indicated specificities of ZiaA and CoaT reflect inducing metals for which homeostasis is known to be altered following gene deletion.D, predicted secondary structure of apo bacterial Atx1 based upon yeast ATX1, showing Cys ligands in loop 1 and a novel His in loop 5. The latter region is predicted to move more freely (arrow) than in yeast ATX1 because of the absence of subsequent β-strand. E, predicted secondary structure of copper-bacterial Atx1 based upon yeast ATX1. F, predicted secondary structure of CtaAN, and G, PacSN based upon yeast ATX1 and showing Tyr-65 of PacSN.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)How is copper acquired and released from Atx1 inSynechocystis PCC 6803, and does it optionally obtain copper from CtaA? The bacterial two-hybrid data might suggest the latter (Fig.2). Pufahl et al. (47Pufahl R. Singer C. Pearison K.L. Lin S.J. Schmidt P. Fahrni C. Culotta V.C. Penner-Hahn J.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1997; 278: 853-856Crossref PubMed Scopus (585) Google Scholar) proposed a model for copper transfer from ATX1 to CCC2 via bridged ATX1-CCC2 copper-binding sites. NMR structural analyses have subsequently shown that the first and final loops (loops 1 and 5) are the main sites for movement in copper-ATX1 upon contact with apoCCC2 (39Arnesano F. Banci L. Bertini I. Cantini F. Ciofi-Baffoni S. Huffman D.L. O'Halloran T.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41365-41376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). The metal-binding Cys residues are associated with loop 1, whereas loop 5 contains a conserved Lys in several eukaryotic ATX1 homologues and is also located close to the metal-binding site in the folded protein. It has been speculated that movement of this residue may trigger metal release from ATX1. Structural modeling of (ancestral) bacterial Atx1, PacSN, and CtaAN strengthens the hypothesis that loop 5 can influence copper transfer (Fig. 6). In bacterial Atx1 the equivalent region to loop 5 contains a His residue that closely approaches the metal binding site when modeled on copper-ATX1, ideal for providing a third ligand (Fig. 6, D and E). The absence of a carboxyl-terminal β-strand is likely to make loop 5 highly mobile (arrow in Fig. 6 D), and it is envisaged that substantial displacement of a His ligand upon interaction with PacSN would be a most effective trigger for metal release. This mobile region could also be well suited to metal acquisition, an exposed His residue forming the first ligand in exchange with adventitious sites and/or perhaps also in acquisition from CtaA. PacSN contains Tyr-His in loop 5. A stable loop 5 of PacSN could favor ligand exchange to Tyr or His coincident with displacement of His from bacterial Atx1. The absence of known copper ligands in the loop 5 region of CtaA is consistent with reversal of the vector for metal transfer (donation to bacterial Atx1) (Fig. 6,F and G).The amino-terminal region of ZiaA (111 amino acids) contains a single GMXCXXC motif (Fig. 1) within a domain that can be modeled to form a ferredoxin-like fold, followed by a region containing seven histidine residues arranged in HXH motifs. However, neither the amino-terminal region ZiaAN nor CoaTN (a 38-amino acid region that does not contain an obvious metal-binding motif) formed detectable two-hybrid interactions with Atx1 (Fig. 2). The detected Atx1 interactions are specific to the amino-terminal regions of the copper transporters (Fig. 6 C). There is no free zinc in the cytosol of E. coli (48Outten C.E. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 2001; 292: 2488-2492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1132) Google Scholar), and it is anticipated that the same is true for Synechocystis PCC 6803 and for cobalt, raising questions about what molecules interact with and supply metals ions to ZiaAN, and CoaTN. It is unclear how widespread metallochaperones are and how significant their associations are in defining which inorganic elements are acquired by metalloproteins in vivo. There is essentially no free copper in the cytoplasm ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae (1Rae T.D. Schmidt P.J. Pufahl R.A. Culotta V.C. O'Halloran T.V. Science. 1999; 284: 805-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (1346) Google Scholar), and it is anticipated that this applies to other cells. It has become apparent that copper metallochaperones assist in the delivery of copper ions to target proteins (such as superoxide dismutase) or to target compartments, encouraging advantageous copper-protein partnerships while inhibiting others en route (reviewed in Refs. 2O'Halloran T.V.

It is feasible that the lack of intracellular compartments in most prokaryotes (with the crucial exception of most cyanobacteria) circumvents a requirement for a network of copper metallochaperones (2O'Halloran T.V. Culotta V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25057-25060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar), although Enterococcus hirae contains an ATX1-like protein, CopZ, which is implicated in efficient copper perception by the transcriptional regulator CopY (13Odermatt A. Solioz M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4349-4354Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Recent studies have allowed the formulation of hypotheses about how copper is released from metallochaperones, but it is less clear how and/or where copper metallochaperones acquire copper. Cyanobacteria are believed to occupy an evolutionary transition in the use of copper, the photosynthetic generation of dioxygen having liberated this element from inorganic sulfides and made it available for uptake and recruitment in emergent proteins (14Fraústo da Silva J.R.R. Williams R.J.P. The Biological Chemistry of the Elements. Oxford University Press, Oxford, United Kingdom1991: 11-20Google Scholar). Photosynthetic electron transport occurs at internal thylakoid membranes in higher plant chloroplasts and in most cyanobacteria includingSynechocystis PCC 6803. It is possible to monitor copper trafficking to this internal compartment (with substantial copper requirements) in vivo in some of these organisms (15Tottey S. Rich P.R. Rondet S.A.M. Robinson N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19999-20004Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Within the thylakoid lumen is the soluble copper protein plastocyanin, which shuttles electrons between membranous photosystems (reviewed in Ref. 16Kerfeld C.A. Krogmann D.W. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 49: 397-425Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Despite the pivotal role of plastocyanin in the primary conversion of light to chemical energy within the biosphere, it has been largely neglected in studies of the intracellular trafficking of copper by metallochaperones. Thylakoid membranes ofSynechocystis PCC 6803 are also a site of respiratory electron transport (17Dworsky A. Mayer B. Regelsberger G. Fromwald S. Peschek G.A. Bioelectrochem. Bioenerg. 1995; 38: 35-43Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar), and copper must be supplied to the CuA and the intramembranous CuB, sites of cytochrome oxidase. The target for ATX1 in S. cerevisiae is CCC2 (12Valentine J.S. Gralla E.B. Science. 1997; 278: 817-818Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar), a Golgi-localized variant P-type ATPase (18Pedersen P.L. Carafoli E. Trends Biochem.

Copper-transporting CPx-type ATPases have been described in bacteria, including cyanobacteria (21Phung L.T. Ajlani G. Haselkorn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The blockade in lipoprotein production was accompanied by mild to moderate hepatic steatosis, but the mice appeared healthy. Although hepatic MTP deficiency appeared to be innocuous, we hypothesized that a blockade in very low density lipoprotein secretion and the accompanying steatosis might increase the sensitivity ofMttp Δ/Δ livers to additional hepatic insults. To address this issue, we compared the susceptibility ofMttp Δ/Δ mice andMttp flox/flox controls to hepatic injury fromEscherichia coli lipopolysaccharides, concanavalin A, andPseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A.

A genetic absence of MTP causes abetalipoproteinemia, a disease characterized by intestinal fat malabsorption, a virtual absence of chylomicrons, very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), low density lipoproteins in the plasma, and strikingly low plasma levels of triglycerides and cholesterol. The fact that a deficiency in MTP reduces the plasma levels of atherogenic lipoproteins has attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical industry. Many companies have established MTP programs, with the goal of identifying MTP inhibitors suitable for treating humans with hyperlipidemias (3Jamil H. Chu C.-H. Dickson J.K., Jr. Chen Y. Yan M.

Heterozygous knockout mice (Mttp +/−) manifested slightly reduced levels of lipoprotein secretion, reduced levels of apoB100-containing lipoproteins in the plasma, and slightly increased levels of neutral lipids (triglycerides and cholesterol esters) in the liver. Homozygous knockout mice (Mttp −/−) died during embryonic development. Subsequently, we usedCre/LoxP recombination techniques to produce mice lacking Mttp expression in the liver but not in the intestine (6Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Those mice, designatedMttp Δ/Δ mice, exhibited strikingly reduced plasma levels of apoB100, sizable reductions in the plasma levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, and mild to moderate steatosis with increased levels of neutral lipids in the liver. TheMttp Δ/Δ mice were healthy and grew normally; their plasma transaminase levels were normal, and their livers were free of inflammatory infiltrates (6Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). The fact that it was possible to eliminate hepatic Mttpexpression in a mammalian model without noticeable side effects supported the concept that it might be possible to develop MTP inhibitors to treat hyperlipidemias. Also encouraging were studies by Wetterau et al. (7Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Harrity T.W. Arbeeny C. Cap M. Connolly F. Chu C.-H. George R.J. Gordon D.A. Jamil H. Jolibois K.G. Kunselman L.K.

In this study, we further investigated the notion that it might be possible, with impunity, to inhibit MTP and block hepatic lipoprotein production. We were suspicious, based on several observations, that MTP inhibition might not be as safe as our original studies and those of Wetterau et al. (7Wetterau J.R. Gregg R.E. Harrity T.W. Arbeeny C.

First, other human conditions associated with hepatic steatosis (e.g. diabetes mellitus, excessive consumption of ethanol, and obesity) increase the risk of developing hepatic inflammation and advanced liver disease (8Diehl A.M. Semin. Liver Dis. 1999; 19: 221-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 9Lieber C.S. J. Hepatol. 2000; 32: 113-128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 10Tsukamoto H. Lu S.C. FASEB J. 2001; 15: 1335-1349Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar). Second, severe liver disease has been reported in humans with abetalipoproteinemia (11Partin J.S. Partin J.C. Schubert W.K. McAdams A.J. Gastroenterology. 1974; 67: 107-118Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Illingworth D.R. Connor W.E. Miller R.G. Arch. Neurol. 1980; 37: 659-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although treatment with short-chain triglycerides might have contributed to the liver disease in those cases, it is also possible that the inability of those livers to secrete lipoproteins caused them to be susceptible to steatohepatitis and advanced liver disease. Normal human livers are required to face toxic insults. For example, intermittent lapses in the intestinal mucosal barrier can allow bacterial products to reach the liver (13Berg R.D. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1999; 473: 11-30Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Normal livers from healthy individuals can cope with these challenges effectively, without inflammation or tissue injury. The livers of susceptible individuals, however, cannot effectively deal with these challenges, either because of genetic differences or metabolic derangements (14Chitturi S. Farrell G.C. Semin. Liver Dis. 2001; 21: 27-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (602) Google Scholar). This failure of normal protective mechanisms can lead to hepatic inflammation and, in some cases, to advanced liver disease. We hypothesized that the blockade of hepatic lipoprotein production and resultant hepatic steatosis might render the liver more susceptible to toxic liver injury. To test this hypothesis, we compared the susceptibility of liver-specific MTP knockout mice and littermate controls to hepatic injury following challenges with exogenous toxins. A conditional Mttp allele, Mttp flox, in which exon 1 of Mttp is flanked by loxP sites, has been described previously (6Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). Mttp flox/floxmice were bred with Mx1-Cre transgenic mice (15Rajewsky K., Gu, H. Kühn R. Betz U.A.K. Müller W. Roes J. Schwenk F. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 600-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar) to generateMttp flox/floxMx1-Cre mice. To excise exon 1 of Mttp and thus eliminate MTP expression in the liver, 21–28-day-old maleMttp flox/floxMx1-Cre mice (16Gu H. Marth J.D. Orban P.C. Mossmann H. Rajewsky K. Science. 1994; 265: 103-106Crossref PubMed Scopus (1169) Google Scholar) were injected with polyinosinic-polycytidylic ribonucleic acid (pI-pC; Sigma; 500 μg every other day for 8 days) (6Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). LittermateMttp flox/flox mice lacking the Cretransgene were also injected with pI-pC. Excision of exon 1 was assessed by Southern blot analysis of SacI-digested genomic DNA using a 3′-flanking probe. The mice had a mixed genetic background (∼50% 129/SvJae and ∼50% C57BL/6). They were housed in a pathogen-free barrier facility with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle and were fed rodent chow containing 4.5% fat (Ralston Purina, St. Louis, MO). Genotypes were determined by Southern blots or by PCR with genomic DNA from tail biopsies. Plasma glucose levels were measured with a glucose (Trinder) 100 kit from Sigma. Plasma insulin levels were measured with a 1-2-3 ultra-sensitive rat insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay from Alpco (Windham, NH). Murine 11K GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) were used to assess hepatic gene expression patterns. Total RNA was isolated from liver biopsies with TRizol Reagent (Invitrogen) and purified further with a RNeasy Midi kit (Qiagen, Los Angeles, CA). cDNA was synthesized from the RNA with the Superscript Choice System (Invitrogen) and T7-(dT)24primers (Genset, La Jolla, CA). Biotin-labeled cRNA was transcribed from the cDNA in the presence of biotin-labeled nucleotides (RNA Transcript Labeling kit for nucleic acid arrays, Enzo Diagnostics, Farmingdale, NY). The integrity of the total RNA and the cRNA was assessed by electrophoresis on a 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel. Fragmented cRNA was mixed with control oligonucleotides Bio B, C, D, and Cre (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) and hybridized to the GeneChip at 45 °C for 16 h. The GeneChip Fluidics Station 400 (Affymetrix) was used to stain the GeneChips with R-phycoerythrin streptavidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR), and the signal was amplified with a biotin-labeled anti-streptavidin antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). The expression data were obtained by scanning the arrays in a GeneArray Scanner (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, CA); data were analyzed with GeneChip 3.1 software (Affymetrix). Expression of the stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 gene (Scd1) was assessed by Northern blotting with a probe described previously (17Shimomura I. Shimano H. Korn B.S. Bashmakov Y. Horton J.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 35299-35306Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (322) Google Scholar). Briefly, 25 μg of total liver RNA was denatured and separated on 1% agarose/formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. The integrity of the total RNA was confirmed on ethidium bromide-stained gels before transfer to a Nytran SuPerCharge membrane (Schleicher & Schuell). Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing procedures were performed as described previously (18Beigneux A.P. Moser A.H. Shigenaga J.K. Grunfeld C. Feingold K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 16390-16399Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). Membranes were probed with [α-32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA fragments, and signals were visualized by autoradiography (Hyperfilm ECL, Amersham Biosciences). Band intensity was quantified by densitometry (Molecular Imager FX, Bio-Rad). An 18 S probe (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to normalize Scd1 expression levels. Levels of Scd1 protein were determined by Western blotting of whole-liver homogenates. Levels of sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 and SREBP-2 were determined by Western blotting of nuclear extracts (19Sheng Z. Otani H. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 935-938Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To prepare the nuclear extracts, livers from four mice were pooled (∼1.5 g) and homogenized in 30 ml of buffer A (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 25 mm KCl, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 2 msucrose, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 150 μm spermine, 2 μm spermidine) and protease inhibitors (Complete-Mini,Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The homogenate was subjected to several strokes with a Teflon pestle and filtered through three layers of cheesecloth. To isolate the nuclear pellet, a 25-ml portion of the homogenate was then layered over 10 ml of buffer A and spun in an SW28 Ti rotor (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) at 24,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 100 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2, 1 mm sodium EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol), and protease inhibitors (Complete-Mini), 0.1 volume of 4 m(NH4)2SO4, pH 7.9, were added. The resuspended pellet was gently mixed and then centrifuged at 85,000 rpm in a TLA-100.2 rotor (Beckman Instruments) for 45 min at 4 °C. Aliquots of the supernatant containing the nuclear extracts (150 μg) and the whole-liver homogenates (100 μg) were then size-fractionated on 8% polyacrylamide gels. Western blots were performed with rabbit antisera against mouse SREBP-1 (20Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin.

The binding of the primary antibodies was assessed by a horseradish peroxidase-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody and ECL Western blotting detection reagents (Amersham Biosciences). Liver pieces (∼100 mg) were homogenized with a Polytron, Ultra-Turbax T8 (VWR, San Francisco, CA), and lipids were extracted with chloroform/methanol, 2:1 (v/v). Plasma lipids were extracted by hexane/isopropyl alcohol, 3:2 (v/v). Before the lipid extraction, known amounts of tri- and pentadecanoic acid (Sigma) were added as internal standards (23Leung G.K. Véniant M.M. Kim S.K. Zlot C.H. Raabe M. Björkegren J. Neese R.A. Hellerstein M.K. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7515-7520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Triglycerides, phospholipids, and fatty acids were identified by thin-layer chromatography, transesterified with methanolic HCl (Aldrich), and quantified by gas chromatography (23Leung G.K. Véniant M.M. Kim S.K. Zlot C.H. Raabe M. Björkegren J. Neese R.A. Hellerstein M.K. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 7515-7520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). One week after the last pI-pC injection, Mttp Δ/Δ mice andMttp flox/flox littermate controls were given an intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia colilipopolysaccharide (LPS, Sigma; 1.0 μg/g) or intravenous injections of concanavalin A (ConA; 400 μg) (Sigma) or Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (PEA, Sigma, 600 μg/kg). Plasma triglycerides and liver injury-associated enzymes (alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)) were determined in the clinical chemistry laboratory of San Francisco General Hospital 12 h before and 4 (LPS, ConA, and PEA) and 24 h (LPS) after the injections of the toxins. Plasma tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) was determined by a commercial immunoassay with antibodies against mouse TNF-α (R & D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). All procedures were approved by the Committee on Animal Research at the University of California, San Francisco. Hepatic levels of mRNAs for a variety of cytokines were quantified by RNase protection assays (24Gilman M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. 1. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1993: 4.7.1-4.7.8Google Scholar) with a multiprobe cDNA template kit (mCK1b, mCK3, mCK5; PharMingen, San Diego, CA). Briefly, cRNA probes were transcribed with [α-32P]UTP (>800 Ci/mmol, Amersham Biosciences). Radiolabeled cRNA (5 × 105 Cerenkov cpm) was combined with 20 μg of liver RNA in 10 μl of hybridization buffer. The mixture was incubated at 55 °C for 16 h, and unhybridized RNA was digested by adding ribonuclease A and T1. RNase digestion was terminated with proteinase K and SDS, and the RNA-RNA hybrids were purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The double-stranded RNA was resuspended in electrophoresis buffer, denatured at 100 °C, and separated through 5% polyacrylamide/urea gels. RNA bands were visualized by autoradiography, and band intensity was quantified by densitometry (Hoefer Scientific Instruments, San Francisco, CA). Signals for specific cytokines were normalized to control RNAs (L32 or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase). Thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARS), frequently used to estimate levels of lipid peroxides (25Ohkawa H. Ohishi N. Yagi K. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 95: 351-358Crossref PubMed Scopus (23531) Google Scholar, 26Leclercq I.A. Farrell G.C. Field J. Bell D.R. Gonzalez F.J. Robertson G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), were determined with 50-mg liver fragments. To prevent the peroxidation of lipids during the procedure, liver fragments were homogenized in a 1.15% KCl solution containing 50 mm desferroxamine (Sigma). To generate mice lacking MTP in the liver (i.e.MttpΔ/Δ mice), Cre expression inMttp flox/floxMx1-Cre mice was induced with pI-pC. Consistent with previous studies (6Raabe M. Véniant M.M. Sullivan M.A. Zlot C.H. Björkegren J. Nielsen L.B. Wong J.S. Hamilton R.L. Young S.G. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 1287-1298Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar), the plasma triglyceride levels were lower in Mttp Δ/Δmice than in Mttp flox/flox mice (TableI). The reduction in plasma triglyceride levels in Mttp Δ/Δ mice was accompanied by an increase in hepatic lipid stores, which was evident both from the gross appearance of the liver (Fig. 1,A and B) and from histology (Fig. 1,C–F). Biochemical studies revealed that the liver triglyceride stores were 3-fold higher inMttp Δ/Δ mice than in littermateMttp flox/flox mice (Table I). The amount of lipid accumulation in this model was modest in comparison to some other genetic models of lipid accumulation. For example, the livers of mice expressing a truncated SREBP-1a synthesize high levels of fatty acids and have a 21-fold increase in liver triglyceride stores (20Shimano H. Horton J.D. Hammer R.E. Shimomura I. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 98: 1575-1584Crossref PubMed Scopus (699) Google Scholar).Table ICharacteristics of MttpΔ/Δ and littermate control Mttpflox/flox miceMouse phenotypeMttpflox/flox (n = 24)MttpΔ/Δ (n = 23)pvalueAge (days)49 ± 849 ± 90.93Body weight (g)19.9 ± 4.322.7 ± 4.50.09Liver weight (g)1.24 ± 0.131-an = 8.1.56 ± 0.231-bn = 12.<0.0001Plasma triglycerides (mg/dl)65.8 ± 18.237.2 ± 13.2<0.0001Plasma fatty acids (mmol/liter)0.21 ± 0.091-an = 8.0.25 ± 0.041-bn = 12.0.38Liver triglycerides (μmol/g)107 ± 871-cn = 7.333 ± 1651-an = 8.0.005Data represent means and S.D. p values calculated by two-tailed, unpaired t test.

Open table in a new tab Data represent means and S.D. p values calculated by two-tailed, unpaired t test. Liver weights and body weights determined in two separate groups of mice. We predicted that the microarray experiments might uncover many perturbations in the expression of genes affecting lipid metabolism. To address this issue, we compared hepatic gene expression inMttp Δ/Δ andMttp flox/flox mice with Affymetrix GeneChips. Remarkably, most genes involved in lipid metabolism were unchanged (e.g. acetyl-CoA carboxylase, acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase, apoE, ATP-citrate lyase, cholesterol 7-α-hydroxylase, fatty-acid synthase, fatty acid transport protein, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A lyase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase, low density lipoprotein receptor, lipoprotein lipase, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-α) (definition of unchanged: fold change <30%,p > 0.15). However, there were two noteworthy exceptions. First, Mttp expression was undetectable in the livers of Mttp Δ/Δ mice (n = 5), whereas Mttp expression inMttp flox/flox mice was 6-fold higher than the threshold detection level (n = 7) (p = 0.00000002). Second, Scd1 expression in the livers of Mttp Δ/Δ mice was reduced by 69% compared with the livers of Mttp flox/floxmice (p < 0.0005). Northern blots and Western blots confirmed the reduction in Scd1 expressionMttp Δ/Δ livers (Fig.2, A and B).Scd1 expression is up-regulated by SREBP-1 (27Tabor D.E. Kim J.B. Spiegelman B.M. Edwards P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22052-22058Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), so we hypothesized that the levels of mature SREBP-1 would be reduced in livers of Mttp Δ/Δ mice. Indeed, this was the case. SREBP-1 (but not SREBP-2) levels were reduced by ∼50% in the livers of Mttp Δ/Δ mice (Fig.2 C). SREBP-1c expression is reduced by low levels of insulin and induced by insulin replacement (28Shimomura I. Bashmakov Y. Ikemoto S. Horton J.D. Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 13656-13661Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 29Shimano H. Prog. Lipid Res. 2001; 40: 439-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (587) Google Scholar). To determine whether the inactivation ofMttp affected glucose or insulin levels, plasma triglycerides, glucose, and insulin levels were measured inMttp flox/flox mice (n = 20),Mttp flox/flox mice treated with subcutaneous injections of water (n = 10), andMttp Δ/Δ mice (i.e. Mttp flox/flox mice treated with subcutaneous injections of pI-pC; n = 10). Consistent with the results in Table I, plasma triglyceride levels were significantly reduced in Mttp Δ/Δ mice (p< 0.001). Plasma glucose levels were reduced by ∼20% inMttp Δ/Δ mice (14.06 ± 0.88 mmol/liter in Mttp flox/flox mice versus11.44 ± 0.50 in Mttp Δ/Δ mice;p < 0.05). Plasma insulin levels were reduced by ∼45% in Mttp Δ/Δ mice (0.39 ± 0.30 ng/ml in Mttp flox/flox mice versus0.21 ± 0.06 in Mttp Δ/Δ mice;p < 0.001). Thus, the lower plasma insulin levels inMttp Δ/Δ mice might well contribute to the lower SREBP-1 levels. Scd1 expression is also down-regulated by polyunsaturated fatty acids (30Ntambi J.M. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1549-1558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hannah V.C., Ou, J. Luong A. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol.

Chem. 2001; 276: 9800-9807Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar), so we sought to determine whether levels of polyunsaturated fatty acids were increased inMttp Δ/Δ mice. Interestingly, the predominant polyunsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid, was increased significantly in the livers of Mttp Δ/Δ mice. The amount of linoleic acid (as a percentage of the total fatty acids) in liver triglycerides was 34.2 ± 4.2 inMttp flox/flox mice (n = 8) and 40.8 ± 2.7 in Mttp Δ/Δ mice (n = 7) (p = 0.0037); the percentage of linoleic acid in liver free fatty acids was 15.8 ± 2.7 inMttp flox/flox mice and 22.7 ± 2.7 inMttp Δ/Δ mice (p = 0.0003). These differences could not be accounted for by differences in the fatty acid composition of the plasma. The amount of linoleic acid (as a percentage of the total fatty acids) in plasma triglycerides was 27.2 ± 5.9 in Mttp flox/flox mice (n = 8) and 24.2 ± 16.3 inMttp Δ/Δ mice (n = 7) (p = 0.62). Because hepatic steatosis in some mouse models leads to hepatic inflammation (26Leclercq I.A. Farrell G.C. Field J. Bell D.R. Gonzalez F.J. Robertson G.R. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 105: 1067-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar), we suspected that the accumulation of lipids inMttp Δ/Δ mice might affect the expression of many genes, including those involved in inflammatory responses. However, the microarray experiments did not uncover evidence for an active inflammatory response in Mttp Δ/Δlivers. Expression levels for inflammation-related genes (e.g. macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1α, MIP-1β, MIP-2, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IL-18, interferon-α, interferon-β, interferon-γ; and TNF-α) and apoptosis-related genes (bax, bcl-2, caspases 1, 2, 3 and 7, c-jun, c-myc, cytochromec, and fas) were either equally low inMttp Δ/Δ andMttp flox/flox livers or below the threshold of detection. To determine whetherMttp Δ/Δ mice were particularly sensitive to hepatic injury, Mttp Δ/Δ andMttp flox/flox mice were challenged with three toxins known to cause acute liver inflammation (LPS, ConA, and PEA). The inflammatory response triggered by these toxins is characterized by the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-α, interferon-γ, IL-2, and IL-6), which leads to hepatocyte injury and increased plasma levels of AST, ALT, and LDH (33Parrillo J.E.

Initial studies revealed the expression of the low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP), the very low density lipoprotein receptor (VLDL), and apoE receptor-2 in mouse aortic smooth muscle cells. Smooth muscle cells isolated from LDLR-null, VLDL-null, and apoE receptor-2-null mice were responsive to apoE inhibition of PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration, suggesting that these receptors were not involved. An antisense RNA expression knockdown strategy, utilizing morpholino antisense RNA against LRP, was used to reduce LRP expression in smooth muscle cells to assess the role of this receptor in apoE inhibition of cell migration. Results showed that apoE was unable to inhibit PDGF-directed migration of LRP-deficient smooth muscle cells. The role of LRP in mediating apoE inhibition of PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration was confirmed by experiments showing that antibodies against LRP effectively suppressed apoE inhibition of PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration.

Aside from its well documented function in mediating lipoprotein clearance by the liver (3Mahley R.W. Ji Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 1-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), recent evidence suggests that apoE also has direct cell regulatory functions in manners that are protective against vascular disease (4Curtiss L.K.

These include the modulation of inflammatory response by suppressing lymphocyte activation (6Hui D.Y. Harmony J.A.K. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol.

Hui D.Y. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 2000; 20: 1020-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). ApoE is also present in the brain and the central nervous system, where it participates in neurite outgrowth and nerve regeneration (12Nathan B.P. Bellosta S. Sanan D.A. Weisgraber K.H. Mahley R.W. Pitas R.E. Science. 1994; 264: 850-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (729) Google Scholar, 13Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Hotzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). These diverse functions of apoE may possibly be attributed to its ability to bind several different receptors on cell surface membranes. The initial step of apoE-mediated cholesterol transport is its binding to the LDL receptor on the cell surface (14Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Subsequent steps include endocytosis of the apoE-containing lipoproteins and their transport to lysosomes where lipoprotein degradation takes place. Unesterified cholesterol liberated from lysosomal degradation of lipoproteins can then be used for maintenance of cellular cholesterol homeostasis (14Brown M.S. Goldstein J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1983; 72: 743-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). The LDL receptor is located in clathrin-coated pits, and its rapid endocytosis is mediated through the NPXY motif on the cytoplasmic tail of the protein (15Chen W.J. Goldstein J.L. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 3116-3123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the absence of a functional LDL receptor, apoE interaction with the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) may also deliver cholesterol to cells through a similar endocytosis/lysosomal processing mechanism (16Lund H. Takahashi K. Hamilton R.L. Havel R.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 9318-9322Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 17Hussain M.M. Maxfield F.R. Mas-Oliva J. Tabas I. Ji Z.S.

In contrast to the LDL receptor, the two NPXY motifs within the cytoplasmic tail of the LRP play only a minimal role in endocytosis (21Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The dominant endocytosis signal in LRP is conferred by a YXXL motif and a dileucine sequence (21Li Y. Marzolo M.P. van Kerkhof P. Strous G.J. Bu G. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17187-17194Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar). The initial step of apoE modulation of cell functions is also mediated by its binding to the cell surface. Previous studies have shown that apoE and immunoregulatory LDL suppress lymphocyte activation via binding to cell surface receptors, but endocytosis is not a prerequisite (6Hui D.Y. Harmony J.A.K. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11775-11781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hui D.Y. Harmony J.A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although the immunosuppressive apoE receptor has not been identified to date, it is quite clear that the LDL receptor is not involved (24Curtiss L.K. Edgington T.S. J. Clin. Invest. 1978; 61: 1298-1308Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). ApoE stimulation of neurite outgrowth is also independent of the LDL receptor and is mediated by apoE interaction with LRP (13Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Hotzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Importantly, both immunosuppression and stimulation of neurite outgrowth by apoE are unrelated to its cholesterol-transporting properties because minimally lipidated or delipidated apoE are equally active in regulating these lymphocyte and neuronal cell functions (6Hui D.Y. Harmony J.A.K. Innerarity T.L. Mahley R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 11775-11781Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hui D.Y. Harmony J.A.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1998; 273: 4206-4212Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In contrast, apoE inhibition of platelet aggregation requires its presence in a lipoprotein form (9Riddell D.R. Graham A. Owen J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the LDL receptor does not appear to play a role in apoE inhibition of platelet aggregation (8Riddell D.R. Owen J.S. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 597-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ApoE inhibition of platelet aggregation is also unrelated to its cholesterol transport function (8Riddell D.R. Owen J.S. Thromb. Res. 1996; 81: 597-606Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) but has been suggested to be mediated through binding to another member of the LDL receptor gene family, the apoE receptor 2 (apoER2), on the platelet membrane (8Riddell D.R.

Chem. 1997; 272: 89-95Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which apoE inhibits smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation is also attributed to its ability to modulate cell signaling events (10Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Granholm N.

Previously, we showed that apoE inhibits growth factor-induced smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation via inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and induction of cyclin D1 expression (10Ishigami M.

Moreover, apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, but not their migration, appears to be mediated by stimulation of nitric-oxide synthase (11Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Hui M.S.

The latter observation suggested that apoE inhibits smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation through different mechanisms. Our recent data confirmed this hypothesis and revealed that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation is mediated through its binding to heparan sulfate proteoglycans, whereas its inhibition of cell migration is mediated through binding to cell surface receptors. Although the heparan sulfate proteoglycan perlecan has been implicated as a mediator for apoE inhibition of cell proliferation (28Paka L. Goldberg I.J. Obunike J.C. Choi S.Y. Saxena U. Goldberg I.D.

Aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated from either C57BL/6 wild type mice or mice that are defective in LDL receptor, VLDL receptor, or apoE receptor-2 gene expression. All the animals were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME), except the apoE receptor-2 knockout mice, which were the gift of Dr. Joachim Herz at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School. Aortic smooth muscle cells were isolated using a modification of the procedure used by Mimura et al. (31Mimura Y. Kobayashi S. Notoya K. Okabe M. Kimura I. Horikoshi I. Kimura M. Biol. Pharm.

The primary aortic smooth muscle cells were cultured in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin.

The reaction was conducted with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 4 min, followed by 35 cycles, each consisting of incubation at 94 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 74 °C for 45 s. The size of the PCR product was assessed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels. The morpholino antisense oligonucleotides were transfected into primary smooth muscle cells using the special delivery agent and instructions as provided by Gene Tools. The cells were made quiescent 24 h after oligonucleotide transfection by incubation for 48 h with DMEM and 0.4% fetal bovine serum. For each experiment, half of the transfected quiescent smooth muscle cells were used for migration studies as described below. The remaining cells were centrifuged at 500 × g for 10 min, resuspended in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis loading buffer, and stored at −80 °C until analyzed by Western blot analysis with monoclonal antibody 11H4 against the 85-kDa subunit of LRP. Smooth muscle cell migration toward PDGF-BB was evaluated according to the procedure of Law et al. (38Law R.E. Meehan W.P. Xi X.P. Graf K. Wuthrich D.A. Coats W. Faxon D. Hsueh W.A. J. Clin.

Chem. 2001; 276: 25043-25048Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Briefly, 6 × 104 quiescent smooth muscle cells in 0.3 ml of DMEM were incubated with or without apoE and in the presence or absence of antibodies for 30 min at 37 °C. An aliquot (0.1 ml) of the incubation mixture was then added to the top chamber of tissue culture-treated Transwell polycarbonate membrane with 8-μm pores in 24-well plates. The lower Transwell compartment contained 0.6 ml of DMEM, 0.4% fetal bovine serum, and 0.2% bovine serum albumin, with or without 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. After incubating the sample for 4 h at 37 °C, the upper surface of the Transwell was washed with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells attached to the membranes were fixed with methanol for 10 min at 4 °C followed by hematoxylin staining. The number of cells that migrated to the lower surface of the filter was determined by counting the cells in six high power fields (×320). Maximum cell migration was determined as the number of cells that migrated toward PDGF at the bottom of the Transwell chamber when incubation was carried out in the absence of apoE. All experiments were performed in triplicate and were repeated at least three times. Human apoE was isolated from pooled fresh plasma obtained from healthy volunteers by the method of Cardin et al. (39Cardin A.D. Holdsworth G. Jackson R.L. Schwartz A. Methods in Pharmacology. 5. Plenum Publishing Co., New York1984: 141-166Google Scholar). The purity of apoE was assessed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Samples containing a single band with Mr = 34,000 were used. The purified apoE was stored as a lyophilized sample at −80 °C and was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline immediately prior to use. The apoE was not reconstituted with lipids prior to its addition to cells. Previous reports show the presence of the LDL receptor, LRP, VLDL receptor, and apoE receptor-2 on human, rabbit, and rat smooth muscle cells (40Yla-Herttuala S. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1996; 7: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 41Yamamoto T. Bujo H. Curr. Opinion Lipid. 1996; 7: 298-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 42Schneider W.J. Nimpf J. Bujo H. Curr. Opin. Lipidol. 1997; 8: 315-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The presence of these LDL receptor family members on mouse aortic smooth muscle cells was verified by reverse transcriptase-PCR amplification of their RNA (Fig.1). Because a common characteristic of LDL receptor family members is the ability to bind apoE, one or more of these receptors may mediate apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration in response to growth factor stimulation. The role of the LDL receptor in apoE inhibition of PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell migration was assessed by determining apoE inhibition of PDGF-directed migration of smooth muscle cells isolated from LDLR+/+ andLDLR−/− mice. The results showed that whereas smooth muscle cells lacking the LDL receptors were less efficient in migration toward PDGF compared with cells containing the LDL receptor, apoE effectively inhibited PDGF-directed migration of smooth muscle cells obtained from both LDLR+/+ andLDLR−/− mice (Fig.2). These results documented that apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration is not because of its binding to the LDL receptor. A similar approach was used to assess the role of the VLDL receptor and apoE receptor-2 on apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration. Smooth muscle cells isolated from VLDLR−/−mice and from apoE receptor-2-negative mice were similar to cells from wild type mice in their response to apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration (Fig. 3). Thus, neither the VLDL receptor nor the apoE receptor-2 was responsible for this apoE effect. The role of LRP in mediating apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell response to PDGF cannot be addressed using a similar approach because of the lethality of the LRP−/− mice. To circumvent this problem, an antisense receptor knockdown approach was used to produce LRP-deficient smooth muscle cells. An antisense oligonucleotide 5′-CCTCTGGTCCTGTTACTTCTTGTCC-3′, which is complementary to LRP mRNA residues 386–410, was synthesized for these experiments. The oligonucleotide was modified by morpholino linkage to increase solubility and to provide highly specific antisense activity in transfected cells (43Summerton J. Weller D. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Develop. 1997; 7: 187-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (870) Google Scholar). The incubation of primary smooth muscle cells with this morpholino-derivatized antisense LRP oligonucleotide resulted in cells that were defective in expression of LRP (Fig.4). As a control, cells incubated with a random sequence oligonucleotide had no effect on LRP expression (Fig.4). The random morpholino oligonucleotide also had no effect on the subsequent ability of the cells to migrate toward PDGF (Fig.5). In contrast, preincubating the smooth muscle cells with the morpholino-derivatized antisense LRP oligonucleotide significantly abrogated the apoE effect on suppression of PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration (Fig. 5). The ability of the antisense LRP oligonucleotide to suppress apoE inhibition of cell migration in each experiment correlated well with its effect on LRP expression (Fig. 5). These data strongly suggest that LRP is the cell surface receptor that mediates apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration.Figure 5Effect of apoE on PDGF-stimulated migration of LRP-deficient smooth muscle cells. Mouse aortic smooth muscle cells were transfected with random or antisense LRP morpholino oligonucleotides as described in the legend to Fig. 4. Quiescent transfected cells were then incubated with or without 50 μg/ml apoE and placed in the top chamber of the Transwell in which the bottom chamber contained 10 ng/ml PDGF-BB. Cell migration was determined after 4 h. The solid bars show results of migration of cells transfected under Conditions A or B with either morpholino antisense LRP oligonucleotides (+) or morpholino random sequence nucleotides (−) incubated in the absence of apoE and without PDGF stimulation.

Polyclonal antibodies that were shown previously to inhibit apoE binding to LRP (13Fagan A.M. Bu G. Sun Y. Daugherty A. Hotzman D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30121-30125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 25Holtzman D.M. Pitas R.E. Kilbridge J. Nathan B. Mahley R.W. Bu G. Schwartz A.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9480-9484Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar) were used in these experiments. The results of these studies showed that anti-LRP antibodies alone have no direct effect on PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell migration (Fig.6). However, the anti-LRP antibodies significantly alleviated apoE inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration toward PDGF (Fig. 6). Results of the current study documented that apoE inhibition of PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration is mediated via its binding to LRP. This conclusion is based on the observations that (i) apoE failed to inhibit PDGF-directed migration of cells with suppressed LRP expression because of antisense knockdown, and (ii) the antimigratory property of apoE was abolished by antibodies against LRP. The LRP-mediated apoE suppression of smooth muscle cell migration is specific to this member of the LDL receptor family proteins because apoE was capable of suppressing migration of cells lacking LDL receptor, VLDL receptor, or apoE receptor-2. The demonstration of a functional role of LRP in modulating smooth muscle cell migration is consistent with results reported previously by other investigators. Okada et al. (44Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) showed that inhibition of LRP function, either by anti-LRP or by the receptor-associated protein RAP, reduced smooth muscle cell migration in response to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator uPA. Although uPA is capable of binding to LRP on smooth muscle cells (45Grobmyer S.R. Kuo A. Orishimo M. Okada S. Cines D.B. Barnathan E.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 13291-13300Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), its promotion of cell migration appeared to be mediated through a distinct uPA receptor (44Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The binding of uPA to LRP was proposed to serve only as a clearance mechanism for protease and protease/inhibitor complexes (46Orth K. Madison E.L. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Herz J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 7422-7426Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 47Nykjaer A. Petersen C.M. Moller B. Jensen P.H. Moestrup S.K. Holtet T.L. Etzerodt M. Thogersen H.C. Munch M.

Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) have suggested that LRP may promote uPA-induced smooth muscle cell migration by clearing uPA and allowing free uPA receptor to return to the cell surface to participate in the stimulatory process. However, there is no direct demonstration that LRP inhibition will decrease uPA receptor expression on the cell surface. In fact, fibroblasts with genetic defects in LRP expression have increased uPA receptor activity and accelerated migration on vitronectin (48Weaver A.M. Hussaini I.M. Mazar A. Henkin J. Gonias S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14372-14379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Fibrosarcoma cells lacking LRP also displayed increased levels of the uPA receptor with a concomitant increase in migration on vitronectin-coated surfaces (49Webb D.J. Nguyen D.H.D. Gonias S.L. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 123-134Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that anti-LRP and receptor-associated protein (RAP) inhibition of uPA-induced smooth muscle cell migration observed in the earlier studies by Okada et al. (44Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was a direct effect of the LRP receptor. Our results demonstrating that apoE binding to LRP inhibited PDGF-directed smooth muscle cell migration are consistent with this interpretation. However, it must be noted that anti-LRP alone had no effect on PDGF-stimulated cell migration in our study, whereas anti-LRP was reported to inhibit uPA-stimulated cell migration (44Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The difference between our results and those reported earlier is unclear but may be related to differences between uPA and PDGF in the mechanism of stimulation of cell migration or to the reactivity differences between the two anti-LRP antibodies used in the respective experiments. It is interesting to note that LRP binding to either apoE (current study) or RAP (44Okada S.S. Grobmyer S.R. Barnathan E.S. Arterioscler. Thromb. Vasc. Biol. 1996; 16: 1269-1276Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) resulted in inhibition of agonist-induced smooth muscle cell migration. These results suggest that occupancy of the extracellular domain of LRP is sufficient to confer resistance to agonist-induced smooth muscle cell migration. Whereas the mechanism by which ligand binding to LRP results in inhibition of smooth muscle cell migration remains unclear at this time, the data add to an expanding literature that suggests LRP may mediate signal transduction events in addition to its role as an endocytosis receptor protein (50Gliemann J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 379: 951-964PubMed Google Scholar, 51Herz J. Neuron. 2001; 29: 571-581Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Recently, yeast two-hybrid assays revealed LRP interaction with an extensive set of cytoplasmic adaptor or scaffold proteins in the brain (52Gotthardt M. Trommsdorff M. Nevitt M.F. Shelton J. Richardson J.A. Stockinger W. Nimpf J. Herz J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 25616-25624Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (393) Google Scholar). In addition, LRP has also been shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated, possibly at one or both of its NPXY domains, and LRP phosphorylatioin results in its interaction with the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Shc (53Barnes H. Larsen B. Tyers M. van der Geer P. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 19119-19125Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Interestingly, most of these LRP-interacting proteins contain PTB or PDZ domains with suggested functions in the regulation of MAP kinases, cell adhesion, vesicle trafficking, or neurotransmission (52Gotthardt M.

We have previously shown that apoE inhibits PDGF-induced MAP kinase activity in smooth muscle cells (10Ishigami M. Swertfeger D.K. Granholm N. Hui D.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 20156-20161Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). In view of the requirement of MAP kinase activation for PDGF-stimulated smooth muscle cell migration (54Cospedal R. Abedi H. Zachary I. Cardiovasc. Res. 1999; 41: 708-721Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), it is possible that apoE binding to LRP may promote LRP phosphorylation, resulting in the recruitment of MAP kinase and disruption of the PDGF receptor signaling cascade. Additional experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis. We thank Dr. Joachim Herz for making the apoE receptor-2 knockout mice available for the isolation of receptor-deficient smooth muscle cells. We also thank Tara Riddle and Josh Basford for excellent technical assistance."

Here we present an event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study that measured activity during the decision period of a delayed face recognition task. A double dissociation of activity between anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and a network including left fusiform face area (FFA) and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), reflected whether a probe face matched the remembered face at the time of decision. Greater activity in the left FFA and left DLPFC correlated with probe faces that matched the remembered face; in contrast, activity in ACC was greater when the probe face did not match the remembered face. These results support a model where frontal regions act in concert with stimulus-specific temporal structures to make recognition decisions about visual stimuli."

This interaction has been proposed to play a role in neurite outgrowth and process elongation during neurodifferentiation. However, there is as yet no direct evidence of the relevance of this pathway to neurodifferentiation under physiological conditions. In this study we have investigated a possible role of RAGE and amphoterin in the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells. The functional inactivation of RAGE by dominant negative and antisense strategies showed that RAGE is not required for process outgrowth or differentiation, although overexpression of RAGE accelerates the elongation of neuritic processes. Using the antisense strategy, amphoterin was shown to be essential for process outgrowth and differentiation, suggesting that amphoterin may interact with other molecules to exert its effect in this context. Interestingly, the survival of the neuroblastoma cells treated with retinoic acid was partly dependent on the expression of RAGE, and inhibition of RAGE function partially blocked the increase in anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 following retinoic acid treatment. Based on these results we propose that a combination therapy using RAGE blockers and retinoic acid may prove as a useful approach for chemotherapy for the treatment of neuroblastoma.

The signal is then transduced by the formation of RXR/RAR heterodimers, which bind to RA response elements to activate the transcription of RA-responsive genes. retinoic acid receptor for advanced glycation end products RAGE full-length RAGE dominant negative soluble RAGE all-trans-retinoic acid proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein kinase C RA receptor retinoid X receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium retinoic acid receptor for advanced glycation end products RAGE full-length RAGE dominant negative soluble RAGE all-trans-retinoic acid proliferating cell nuclear antigen protein kinase C RA receptor retinoid X receptor Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium fetal calf serum fluorescein isothiocyanate phosphate-buffered saline 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium Retinoic acid-induced differentiation leads ultimately to apoptosis in many cell types indicating close links between the molecular pathways of cell differentiation and those of cell death.

The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily, which binds to amphoterin, a member of high mobility group protein, to initiate neurite outgrowth in cortical neurons (15Hori O.

The RAGE-amphoterin interaction elicits Rac and cdc42 activation and stimulates neurodifferentiation in RAGE-expressing cells cultured on amphoterin-coated plates (17Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). RAGE-amphoterin is localized at the leading edge of differentiating neurons, suggesting a role in axonal and dendritic elongation. Although retinoic acid-induced neurodifferentiation is mediated by interaction with nuclear receptors, the molecular details of how exactly the nuclear message leads to axonal and dendritic outgrowth at the cell membrane level is still not clearly understood. An improved knowledge of the pathways that link differentiation and apoptosis during retinoic acid-induced differentiation would provide a basis for the development of better therapeutic approaches for neuroblastoma treatment. The present investigation was designed to study the role of RAGE in retinoic acid-induced neurodifferentiation. The mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a and human SH-SY5Y cell lines chosen as the model for this study extend processes and also undergo apoptosis following retinoic acid treatment. The results presented here show that RAGE-amphoterin interaction plays a critical role in growth retardation and survival of neuroblastoma cells following retinoic acid treatment. The results also suggest that RAGE has a supplementary rather than an essential role in process outgrowth during retinoic acid-induced differentiation. Human RAGE cDNA was a gift from Dr. David Stern, Columbia University, New York. The cytoplasmic deletion mutant of RAGE was prepared by as previously described (14Kohler J.A. Imeson J. Ellershaw C.

Open table in a new tab The mouse neuroblastoma cell line Neuro2a and the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y (Deutsche Sammlung von Mikroorganismen und Zellkulturen GmbH, Germany) were maintained in DMEM containing heat-inactivated 10% FCS,l-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Endogenous RAGE expression in both the cell lines was confirmed by Western and Northern analyses. Transfection of Neuro2a cells was carried out with FuGENE 6 transfection reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Germany) and plasmid at the ratio of 3:1. Stable cell lines expressing full-length RAGE (RAGE-FL), RAGE cytoplasmic deletion mutant (RAGE-Δ), and mock cells harboring the expression vector pcDNA3 were prepared by selection in medium containing 400 μg/ml G418 (Invitrogen). After 6 weeks of selection, nine independent clones were picked and analyzed for RAGE and RAGE dominant negative expression. Of these, three independent clones of RAGE-FL and RAGE-Δ cells were used for further experiments. Antisense oligos (see Table I) were included in the medium for passive cellular uptake. The cells were pre-treated for 24 h with the required concentration of oligos, the presence of oligos was maintained throughout the duration of the experiment, and fresh medium containing oligos was added every second day. Uptake of oligos was monitored using a fluorescence microscope. In general, it was observed that the cellular uptake started from 12 h and the nucleotides were detectable undegraded for 60–72 h after the initial treatment. Neuro2a cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well in a six-well plate and cultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 2% serum and 20 μm ATRA (Sigma). After the required time period of incubation, the percentage of differentiation was analyzed by counting the number of cells that showed neurite-like processes. Cells that showed bidirectional or multidirectional outgrowths were counted. Five random fields were counted for each observation. The percentage of differentiation was calculated from the number of cells that showed process outgrowth divided by the total number of cells in each field. Cells bearing neurite-like processes longer than the diameter of cell body were considered differentiated after 48 h, and cells bearing neurites with length at least double that of cell diameter were considered differentiated after 7 days. Neurite outgrowth was also studied by staining F-actin with FITC-Phalloidin. Neuro2a cells at a density of 5 × 104 per well were seeded in two-well chamber slides (Nunc Lab-Tek) and cultured for 24 h. The medium was then replaced with DMEM containing 2% FCS and 20 μm ATRA. After the required time period of incubation the cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. The fixed cells were subsequently permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 blocked with 1% FCS and stained with FITC-labeled phalloidin (Sigma). The results were analyzed in a conventional fluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axiovert 25). Immediately after the incubation period, the cells were washed twice with PBS and scraped off the plates in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, Triton X-100 1.0%, SDS 0.1% + protease inhibitor mixture from Roche Molecular Biochemicals) with a cell scrapper. The protein concentration of the lysates was determined by using the BCA protein assay reagent (Pierce). Equal amounts of protein were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane in a semi-dry blotting apparatus (Sigma). The membranes were blocked with synthetic blocking agent Roti-Block (Roth, Germany) for RAGE detection and 5% (w/v) nonfat dry milk for all other proteins. The membrane was then incubated with the primary antibody followed by secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase. The bands were subsequently detected following the addition of the sensitive coloring agents nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate-p-toluidine. Primary antibodies used: Anti-RAGE antibody was a gift from Dr. Neeper (Merck Sharp & Dohme Research Laboratories, Germany). Antiamphoterin antibody and recombinant rat amphoterin were produced and purified as has been described previously (18Parkkinen J. Raulo E. Merenmies J. Nolo R. Kajander E.O. Baumann M. Rauvala H. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 19726-19738Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Anti-Bcl-2, Bcl-XL, and proliferation cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were purchased from PharMingen. Dr. Larry Denner (Texas Biotechnology Corp.) donated the Anti-sRAGE antibody. Cells grown on 2-well chamber slides were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, washed with PBS, pH 7.4, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100, blocked in PBS with 1% FCS, and then incubated with primary antibody for 1 h. The slides were washed with PBS and incubated with secondary antibody, Alexa fluor 488 (Molecular Probes, The Netherlands) for 1 h. Slides were then washed with PBS and mounted with mountant containing 1%pphenylenediamine (Sigma) prior to analysis using a fluorescence microscope. Cell viability was studied by the MTT assay, and apoptosis was detected by analyses of DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis. At the end of each experiment, 10 μl of MTT (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and incubated at 37 °C in 95% air/5% CO2 for 4–5 h. The insoluble formazan formed was dissolved in isopropanol/0.01 m HCl, and the absorbance was measured in a spectrophotometer at 570 nm with a background reading of 660 nm. The percentage of cell survival was calculated relative to control (taken as 100%). The detached cells and the adherent cells were processed together for DNA extraction. Detached cells floating in the medium were centrifuged at 500 ×g for 10 min and washed with PBS once. Adherent cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS, and pelleted. The pellet was digested in proteinase K and RNase A at 50 °C for overnight. After addition of DNA extraction solution, DNA was obtained by isopropanol and ethanol precipitation. DNA (10 μg) was examined on 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide. DNA size calibration was performed using a 100-bp marker. Previous reports (17Huttunen H.J. Fages C. Rauvala H. J. Biol.

In this study, we chose cells that express endogenous RAGE to study its contribution to cellular differentiation and outgrowth under the influence of a physiological agent, retinoic acid. We constructed stable Neuro2a cell lines expressing either full-length RAGE (RAGE-FL) or a cytoplasmic domain deletion mutant of RAGE incapable of signaling (RAGE-Δ) (Fig.1, A and B). Neuro2a cells treated with ATRA showed sprouting within 12 h, and process outgrowth was clearly observed from 24 to 48 h in agreement with previous findings (20Riboni L. Prinetti A. Bassi R. Caminiti A. Tettamanti G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26868-26875Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). FITC-phalloidin staining to visualize filamentous actin (Fig.2 A) showed no significant difference in morphology between mock (pcDNA3), RAGE-FL (RAGE full-length), and RAGE-Δ (RAGE cytoplasmic deletion mutant) cells. Compared with untreated control, ATRA treatment for 48 h resulted in 10.0 ± 1.1% of differentiation in mock cells (Fig.2 B). RAGE-Δ cells, which are known to function as a dominant negative mutant for RAGE (21Taguchi A. Blood D.C. del Toro G. Canet A. Lee D.C., Qu, W. Tanji N., Lu, Y. Lalla E., Fu, C. Hofmann M.A. Kislinger T. Ingram M., Lu, A. Tanaka H. Hori O. Ogawa S. Stern D.M. Schmidt A.M. Nature. 2000; 405: 354-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (1092) Google Scholar), also extended neuritic processes and were equally well differentiated (10.5 ± 1.1%) as the mock cells (Fig. 2, A (panel c) andB). However, the percentage of differentiation was significantly higher in RAGE-FL cells (15.2 ± 1.7%) (Fig.2 B), that is, the number of cells undergoing differentiation was significantly increased when RAGE is overexpressed. As a complementary approach, inhibition of RAGE expression by antisense oligos (Table I) (Fig. 1 C) in Neuro2a cells also failed to show any effect either on the morphology (data not shown) or frequency of differentiation following retinoic acid treatment. After 48 h of differentiation, Neuro2a cells treated with antisense oligos (AS-mRAGE1) showed a frequency of 11.0 ± 1.3% of differentiated cells. It was noted that treatment of Neuro2a cells with antisense oligos (AS-mRAGE) resulted in 50–60% inhibition of RAGE expression (Fig. 1 C). Continuing the ATRA treatment for a week resulted in extensive outgrowth and elaborate network of the processes (Fig.3 A), and the percentage of differentiation remained significantly higher in RAGE-FL (20.8 ± 3.1%) compared with mock (15.6 ± 1.0%) or RAGE-Δ cells (14.4 ± 1.4%) (Fig. 3 B). In addition, some of the RAGE-FL cells exhibited extensive elongation of bidirectional processes (Fig. 4 A). Cells bearing processes more than 10 times the diameter of cell body were present in significantly higher number among RAGE-FL (8.1 ± 2.1%) compared with mock cells (2.9 ± 1.4%) (Fig. 4 B), demonstrating that overexpressed RAGE can contribute to the extension of retinoic acid-induced outgrowths even though its absence may not inhibit the initiation of outgrowth.Figure 4Overexpression of full-length RAGE ( RAGE-FL ) stimulated extensive elongation of neurites in Neuro2a cells.

To address the question whether RAGE-Δ cells are susceptible to accelerated growth arrest and/or increased cell death, we analyzed the expression of the proliferation marker PCNA as an index of growth arrest, and MTT reduction assay and DNA fragmentation pattern analyses were carried out to study cell death. Western analysis of the expression of PCNA after 24 and 48 h of ATRA treatment is shown in Fig.5 A. Mock cells showed a mildly reduced expression of PCNA after 24 h and no detectable expression at 48 h. In RAGE-Δ cells, PCNA expression was already strongly reduced within 24 h of ATRA addition, implying that the functional inactivation of RAGE accelerates growth arrest in ATRA-treated cells. As detected by MTT reduction analyses, after 7 days of ATRA treatment, compared with untreated control cells (taken as 100%), only 11.5 ± 0.7% of RAGE-Δ cells survived against 43.0 ± 1.4% of mock cells (Fig. 5 B). Analyses of the DNA fragmentation pattern provided additional evidence for the increased susceptibility of RAGE-Δ cells to retinoic acid-induced apoptosis. Agarose gel electrophoretic analysis of DNA extracted from RAGE-Δ cells revealed laddering from day 3 onward, whereas no clear laddering was noted in DNA extracted from mock and RAGE-FL cells even after 5 days (Fig. 5 C). Similarly, inhibition of RAGE expression by antisense oligos AS-mRAGE1 (Table I) also resulted in reduced survival of ATRA-treated Neuro2a cells. Treatment of Neuro2a cells with ATRA in the presence of sense oligos (S-mRAGE1) for 5 days reduced the percentage of survival to 51.0 ± 3.5% of untreated control (taken as 100%) whereas cells treated under similar conditions with ATRA and antisense oligos (AS-mRAGE1) showed only 26.0 ± 2.1% survival. These findings suggest that functional inactivation of RAGE decreases the survival of retinoic acid-treated cells. The level of expression of anti-apoptotic molecules of the Bcl-2 family proteins is a critical factor known to influence the susceptibility of a cell to undergo apoptosis. Changes in the expression levels of Bcl-2 family proteins have been reported (22Hanada M. Krajewski S. Tanaka S. Cazals-Hatem D. Spengler B.A. Ross R.A. Biedler J.L. Reed J.C.

Biochem. 2001; 268: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) during the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of neuroblastoma cells and are likely to contribute to the altered susceptibility of these cells to apoptosis (24Lombet A. Zujovic V. Kandouz M. Billardon C. Carvajal-Gonzalez S. Gompel A. Rostene W. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 1352-1362Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). We therefore studied the expression of Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 proteins to examine the molecular mechanism underlying the increased susceptibility of RAGE-Δ cells to apoptosis. Western analyses revealed the endogenous expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL in Neuro2a cells (Fig. 6, A–D), and the level of expression of Bcl-2 was increased from 24 h of ATRA treatment in mock cells (Fig. 6 B) whereas that of Bcl-XL remained unchanged (Fig. 6 A). A similar increase in Bcl-2 expression was noted in RAGE-FL cells (Fig.6 C). However, Bcl-2 expression did not increase in RAGE-Δ cells (Fig. 6 C). A densitometric analysis confirmed that, after 36 h of ATRA treatment, mock and RAGE-FL cells had elevated the level of Bcl-2 ∼2.5 ± 0.3- and 2.8 ± 0.26-fold, respectively, relative to the level expressed at 0 h, whereas no elevation was observed in RAGE-Δ cells. These findings imply that RAGE may transmit an anti-apoptotic signal through the increased expression of Bcl-2 during retinoic acid-induced differentiation, thereby influencing the susceptibility of these cells to apoptosis. RAGE-mediated neurite outgrowth is known to be propagated by its interaction with the ligand amphoterin (15Hori O. Brett J. Slattery T. Cao R. Zhang J. Chen J.X. Nagashima M. Lundh E.R. Vijay S.

Chem. 1999; 274: 19919-19924Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). Because the down-regulation of RAGE showed no significant effect on neurite outgrowth and differentiation, we then studied the role of amphoterin in this process. An antisense strategy was employed to inhibit the expression of amphoterin. Immunostaining revealed high concentrations of amphoterin in the nucleus (Fig.7 A), indicating its role as a chromatin-associated protein. Treatment of Neuro2a cells with AS-AMP (3.0 μm) (Table I), for 48 h significantly down-regulated amphoterin expression (>70%) as indicated by the reduced intensity of fluorescence (Fig. 7 A). The effect of amphoterin inhibition on retinoic acid-induced neurite outgrowth and differentiation was subsequently analyzed. The inhibition of amphoterin expression prevented retinoic acid-induced differentiation and neurite outgrowth, as detected by FITC-phalloidin staining (Fig.7 B). However, AS-AMP-treated cells showed early signs of differentiation (i.e. sprouting), demonstrating that amphoterin inhibition prevents the elongation of neurites rather than the early events. Neuro2a cells treated with sense oligos, such as S-AMP, showed 11.9 ± 1.0% of differentiation, whereas cells treated with antisense oligos showed only 4.9 ± 0.8% (Fig.7 C). This shows that, although RAGE is not essential for retinoic acid-induced neurite outgrowth, its putative ligand amphoterin does play an essential role. It also suggests that the functions of amphoterin in neurite outgrowth are not necessarily mediated through RAGE. Because RAGE-FL cells showed extensive process outgrowth and elongation of neuritic processes, we speculated that retinoic acid might increase the expression or secretion of amphoterin during differentiation. To clarify this the expression of amphoterin following ATRA addition was monitored by Western analysis. However, we were unable to detect changes in the expression following ATRA treatment (Fig.7 D). We then addressed the role of amphoterin in cellular survival during retinoic acid-induced differentiation. As observed by the MTT reduction assay, cells treated with sense oligos (S-AMP) showed 48.0 ± 3.2% (of retinoic acid-untreated control) of survival whereas amphoterin inhibition using antisense oligos (AS-AMP) significantly reduced the percentage of survival to 35.5 ± 0.7% (Fig.8 A). This result was further confirmed by DNA fragmentation analyses, wherein characteristic DNA laddering was observed in AS-AMP-treated cells following 5 days of ATRA treatment (Fig. 8 B). Consistent with the results obtained from RAGE-Δ cells, antisense inhibition of amphoterin expression also led to early growth arrest of Neuro2a cells following ATRA treatment. Expression of the proliferation marker, PCNA, was almost completely inhibited within 24 h of ATRA addition (Fig. 5 A). These results parallel those obtained with the RAGE-Δ cells, suggesting that the effect of RAGE on cellular survival during retinoic acid-induced differentiation is achieved through its interaction with amphoterin. Both dominant negative inhibition of RAGE and antisense inhibition of amphoterin resulted in significant reduction in the survival of Neuro2a cells following ATRA treatment. However, there is a discrepancy between the absolute values obtained from MTT reduction analyses of the individual experiments. Treatment with ATRA for 7 days resulted in more than 90% inhibition of cellular survival of RAGE-Δ cells, whereas under similar conditions, antisense inhibition of amphoterin resulted in only 65% inhibition, compared with untreated control cells. Such a difference in percentage of survival is unexpected if RAGE and amphoterin function in the same pathway through their interaction. One possible explanation could"

Immunoprecipitation/Western blot studies revealed a robust increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the non-receptor tyrosine kinase, PYK2, in A7r5 cells treated with 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate or ionomycin. 100 pm AVP also induced PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation, and this effect was inhibited by protein kinase C inhibitors Ro-31-8220 (1–10 μm) or chelerythrine chloride (1–20 μm). In fura-2-loaded A7r5 cells, the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking by 100 pm AVP or 1 nm 4β-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate was completely blocked by PP2 (10 μm, a Src family kinase inhibitor). Salicylate (20 mm, recently identified as a PYK2 inhibitor) and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin A47 (50 μm), but not its inactive analog, tyrphostin A63, also blocked AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking. PYK2 phosphorylation was inhibited by both PP2 and salicylate, whereas tyrphostin A47 failed to inhibit PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation. ERK1/2 kinases did not appear to be involved because 1) 100 pm AVP did not appreciably increase ERK1/2 phosphorylation and U-0126 (2.5 μm) did not inhibit AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking; and 2) epidermal growth factor (10 nm) robustly stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation but did not induce Ca2+ spiking.

It binds to heptahelical V1a vasopressin receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells, leading to G protein-dependent activation of phospholipase C (PLC) and the consequent release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores. This signal transduction pathway is activated independently of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (13Byron K.L. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6945-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and requires nanomolar concentrations of AVP for half-maximal activation (14Doyle V.M. Rüegg U.T. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

We have identified previously a novel signal transduction pathway in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells that is activated by physiological concentrations of AVP (between 10 and 100 pm) and leads to oscillations of [Ca2+] i (Ca2+ spiking) that increase in frequency with [AVP] (15Byron K.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 16Shiels A. Lucchesi P.A. Moran C. Byron K.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 190Google Scholar). This effect of low [AVP] is dependent on L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels (15Byron K.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and correlates with action potential generation (16Shiels A. Lucchesi P.A. Moran C. Byron K.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 190Google Scholar), suggesting that it may represent an effect equivalent to stimulation of arterial vasomotion in vivo. We have recently shown that AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells involves phospholipase D (17Li Y. Shiels A.J. Maszak G. Byron K.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2658-H2664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and activation of one or more protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms (18Fan J. Byron K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 821-831Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). It remains to be elucidated how activation of PKC ultimately produces Ca2+ spiking. One possibility is that PKC activation leads to membrane depolarization and consequently to activation of L-type voltage-sensitive Ca2+ channels. We have preliminary data that suggest that inhibition of delayed rectifier K+channels (K v channels) may provide the trigger for L-type Ca2+ channel activation (16Shiels A. Lucchesi P.A. Moran C. Byron K.L. J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 1998; 30: 190Google Scholar). The present study examines the possibility that one or more tyrosine kinases may serve as intermediary links in this signaling cascade. In particular, we focus on the non-receptor tyrosine kinase PYK2 (proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2, also known as RAFTK or CADTK), a member of the focal adhesion kinase (p125FAK) family, which is activated by stimuli that increase [Ca2+] i or activate PKC in cultured rat aortic smooth muscle cells (19Sabri A.

Hypertension. 1999; 33: 201-206Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). PYK2 has also been linked with inhibition of delayed rectifier K+ channels in non-muscle cells (22Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R.

Src family kinases (SFKs) and epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) are tyrosine kinases that have been implicated as activators and/or downstream mediators of PYK2 in other systems (19Sabri A.

Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Activation of PYK2 is associated with its autophosphorylation on tyrosine 402. This phosphotyrosine moiety may then serve as a docking site for the SH2 domain of Src (22Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 26Dikic I Toliwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). Another tyrosine residue in PYK2 (Tyr-881) may also be phosphorylated and serve as a docking site for Grb2, leading to activation of ERK1/2, members of the family of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) (22Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar, 26Dikic I Toliwa G. Lev S.

The roles of SFKs and transactivation of EGFR or MAPKs in AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking have not been examined previously. The results of the present study are consistent with roles for SFKs and PYK2 activation leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of delayed rectifier K+ channels in this novel signal transduction pathway. However, activation of EGFR or ERK1/2 does not appear to be either necessary or sufficient to induce Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells. Cell culture media were from Invitrogen or MediaTech (Herndon, VA).

U-0126 was from Biomol (Plymouth Meeting, PA). Pefabloc SC“ was from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. A7r5 cells were cultured as described previously (13Byron K.L. Taylor C.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6945-6952Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were subcultured onto rectangular (9 × 22-mm, number 1½) glass coverslips or plastic tissue culture dishes (Corning Glass). Confluent cell monolayers were used 2–5 days after plating. Essentially as described previously (15Byron K.L. Circ. Res. 1996; 78: 813-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 18Fan J. Byron K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 821-831Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar), coverslips were washed twice with control medium (135 mm NaCl, 5.9 mm KCl, 1.5 mm CaCl2, 1.2 mm MgCl2, 11.5 mm glucose, 11.6 mm HEPES, pH 7.3) and then incubated in the same medium with 2 μm fura-2-AM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% Pluronic F127 detergent (27Poenie M. Alderton J. Steinhardt R. Tsien R. Science. 1986; 233: 886-889Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar) for 90–120 min at room temperature (20–23 °C) in the dark. The cells were then washed twice and incubated in the dark in control medium (or pretreated with drugs) for 1–5 h prior to the start of the experiment. Fura-2 fluorescence (at 510 nm) was measured in cell populations with a PerkinElmer Life Sciences LS50B fluorescence spectrophotometer. Background fluorescence was determined at the end of the experiment by quenching the fura-2 fluorescence for 10–15 min in the presence of 5 μm ionomycin and 6 mm MnCl2 in Ca2+-free medium. After background fluorescence was subtracted, the ratio of fluorescence at 340 nm excitation to that at 380 nm was calculated and calibrated in terms of [Ca2+] i . We found that salicylate interfered with the measurement of fura-2 fluorescence, so fluo3 was used to measure [Ca2+] i responses in the presence of salicylate. A7r5 cells were incubated for 1 h in the presence of 10 μm fluo3-AM, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.02% Pluronic F127 detergent, then washed, and incubated in control medium in the absence of fluo3-AM for at least 30 min. For these experiments, a single excitation wavelength (505 nm) was used, and emitted fluorescence (at 535 nm) was collected at 0.5-s intervals. Calibration of fura-2 fluorescence in terms of [Ca2+] i was carried out as described previously (28Byron K.L. Villereal M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18234-18239Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using solutions of known Ca2+ concentration to construct a standard curve. The Ca2+ concentration of the standard solutions was calculated using software (MaxChelator, version 6.60) that accounts for binding of Ca2+ to each constituent of the solution. For analysis of fluorescence ratios recorded from cells, the equation [Ca2+] i =K D ·β·((r −R min)/(R max −r)) (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) was fit to the standard curve (using SigmaPlot® software, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) and used to convert ratios (r) into [Ca2+] i . In situcalibration of fura-2 fluorescence by direct determination of minimum and maximum ratios (R min andR max, respectively (29Grynkiewicz G. Poenie M. Tsien R.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 3440-3450Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar)) from within cells yields similar calibrated values. Traces shown are representative of at least three similar experiments. A7r5 cells were grown to confluence on 100-mm tissue culture dishes (Corning Glass). Cells were washed and incubated in control medium (see above) for 3 h at room temperature, followed by treatment for the indicated time in control medium ± agonist. The medium was aspirated, and 0.8 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mm NaF, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm EGTA, 1.5 mmMgCl2, 10% glycerol, 150 mm NaCl, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mmNa3VO4, 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) was added to the dish on ice for 10 min. Cell lysates were collected, sonicated for 15 s, and centrifuged at 16,000 × gfor 20 min at 4 °C. The protein concentration in the supernatant was determined using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay (Pierce), and 600 μg of protein from each sample was incubated with 3 μg of polyclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody overnight at 4 °C with rocking. 40 μl of packed protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) were then added to each sample and incubated with rocking for 60 min at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 ×g and washed three times in 500 μl of lysis buffer. The procedure for the Kv1.2 or PYK2 immunoprecipitation was similar except that a milder lysis buffer was used to preserve protein-protein interactions (100 mm NaCl, 1% Nonidet P-40 (IGEPAL CA-630), 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 30 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 5 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.5 mm Pefabloc, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 500 μm Na3VO4, 20 mmHEPES, pH 7.4). 700 μg of cell lysates were incubated with 4 μg of monoclonal Kv1.2 antibodies or 5 μg of polyclonal anti-PYK2 antibodies overnight at 4 °C, and immune complexes were collected by incubation with 40 μl of packed protein G-agarose beads. For Western blotting, the immunoprecipitates were subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with the indicated antibody. After blotting, the membrane was washed and treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG). The immunoreactive bands were visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Amersham Biosciences) exposed to Hyperfilm (Amersham Biosciences) in the linear range of the film density. The films were scanned, and densitometric analysis was performed with NIH image software. A variation of these methods was used to measure phosphorylation of ERK1/2. A7r5 cells grown on 100-mm plastic tissue culture dishes were equilibrated for 2 h in control medium at room temperature. The cells were then pretreated for 1 h with 2.5 μmU-0126 or vehicle or 30 min with 20 mm salicylate or vehicle, followed by treatment for up to 30 min with 100 pmAVP in the presence or absence of U-0126 or 20 mmsalicylate. The cells were then lysed in 50 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mm NaF, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 5 mm EGTA, 0.1 mmNaVO4, 0.01% Triton X-100, 10 μg ml−1aprotinin, 10 μg ml−1 leupeptin, 0.5 mmPefabloc, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, scraped off the dish, and centrifuged at 12,000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. The supernatant (a volume containing 40 μg of protein) was subjected to SDS-PAGE, electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, and immunoblotted with polyclonal antibodies against phospho-ERK proteins (Promega, Madison, WI; 1:10,000 dilution). The membranes were re-probed for total ERK protein using polyclonal anti-ERK antibodies (Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.). Data are expressed as mean ± S.E. for at least n = 3 experiments and were analyzed using InStat (Graphpad) or SigmaStat (SPSS Scientific) statistical software. One-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Bonferroni's test or a Dunnett's test was used for comparisons among multiple groups. Paired Student's t test was used to evaluate the effects of PP2 on AVP-stimulated Ca2+spiking. Stimuli that activate PKC or elevate [Ca2+] i have been found to activate the tyrosine kinase, PYK2, leading to its autophosphorylation on a tyrosine residue. The presence of PYK2 in A7r5 cells was confirmed by Western blot analysis that identified a band at ∼112 kDa (Fig.1) that did not cross-react with p125FAK antibodies (not shown). Immunoprecipitation using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies revealed an increase in tyrosine-phosphorylated PYK2 in response to both PMA (1 nm) and ionomycin (1 μm), indicating that it can be activated by either PKC or increased [Ca2+] i in A7r5 cells (Fig. 2).Figure 2PYK2 activation by PMA or ionomycin.Tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 was assessed by immunoprecipitation (IP) with anti-phosphotyrosine (pTyr) antibodies followed by immunoblotting with anti-PYK2. Left panel shows a representative immunoblot from cells treated with PMA (1 nm, 10 min) or ionomycin (Iono, 1 μm, 10 min); right panel shows a quantitative densitometric analysis from five experiments (mean ± S.E.).

A one-way repeated measures ANOVA was performed. * indicates significant difference from control, p < 0.01.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) 100 pm AVP was also found to stimulate PYK2 phosphorylation. The time course for stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 by 100 pm AVP is shown in Fig.3, A and B. A significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation was detected after 2 min, followed by a further increase, which plateaued between 5 and 20 min and then declined at 30 min. The Ca2+-spiking response to 100 pm AVP was typically delayed by several minutes (on average 4.2 ± 0.6 min, as reported previously (18Fan J. Byron K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 821-831Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar)) but is sustained for as long as AVP is present, at least up to 1 h (18Fan J. Byron K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 821-831Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Treatment of A7r5 cells with PLD (2.5 units/ml, 15 min), which has been shown previously to stimulate Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells (17Li Y. Shiels A.J. Maszak G. Byron K.L. Am. J. Physiol. 2001; 280: H2658-H2664Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), also stimulated PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation (not shown). The stimulation of PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation by 100 pm AVP was inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the selective PKC inhibitor Ro-31-8220 (Fig. 4). This drug was shown previously to block AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking (18Fan J. Byron K.L. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2000; 524: 821-831Crossref Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Similar results were obtained using another structurally unrelated PKC inhibitor, chelerythrine chloride (0.1–20 μm, not shown). Salicylate has been reported recently (30Wang Z. Brecher P. Hypertension. 2001; 37: 148-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) to inhibit selectively PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation in angiotensin II-stimulated cardiac fibroblasts. Salicylate (20 mm) inhibited AVP-stimulated PYK2 tyrosine phosphorylation by 82% (p< 0.01, n = 3; Fig.5 A) and completely abolished AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking (Fig. 5 B) in A7r5 cells. In three independent paired experiments, the mean frequency of Ca2+ spiking in cells treated with 100 pm AVP alone was 7.8 ± 1.1 min−1, whereas no spiking was observed in cells treated with 100 pm AVP in the presence of 20 mm salicylate. This concentration of salicylate did not prevent 100 nm AVP-stimulated release of Ca2+ from intracellular stores, the [Ca2+] i response to a high external [K+] solution (not shown), or EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (see below). PP2 is a relatively selective inhibitor of SFKs (31Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1784) Google Scholar). 10 μm PP2 completely inhibited AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking, whereas its inactive analog, PP3, had no effect (Fig. 5 C). PP2 also abolished PMA-stimulated Ca2+ spiking (not shown). AVP-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 was significantly inhibited (by 65 ± 3%,n = 3, p < 0.05) by PP2 (Fig.5 D). SFKs have been found to associate with active PYK2 by binding to its phosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr-402; see Refs. 22Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar and 26Dikic I Toliwa G. Lev S. Courtneidge S.A. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1996; 383: 547-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (879) Google Scholar). We examined the possibility that Src and PYK2 might become associated following AVP treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation results are shown in Fig. 6. A7r5 cells were treated for varying times with 100 pm AVP followed by immunoprecipitation of PYK2. Although PYK2 was readily detected in the immunoprecipitates (and depleted from the supernatants), Src was not detectable in the immunoprecipitates at any time point (but was readily detected in the supernatants). Similar results were obtained by immunoprecipitating Src and probing for PYK2 (not shown). The effects of another tyrosine kinase inhibitor, tyrphostin A47 (TyrA47), on the Ca2+-spiking responses to 100 pm AVP or 1 nm PMA are shown in Fig. 7(A–F). TyrA47 (50 μm) completely abolished the Ca2+-spiking response to both agents, whereas the inactive analog, TyrA63 (50 μm), did not affect the responses. However, in contrast to salicylate or PP2, neither TyrA47 nor TyrA63 prevented AVP- or PMA-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 (Fig. 7 G). Transactivation of EGF receptors (EGFR) and activation of ERK1 and ERK2 MAPKs have been implicated as downstream effectors in other PYK2-mediated cell responses (9–22, 24Inagami T. Eguchi S. Numaguchi K. Motley E.D. Tang H. Matsumoto T. Yamakawa T. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1999; 10: 57-61PubMed Google Scholar, 25Tang H. Nishishita T. Fitzgerald T. Landon E.J. Inagami T. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 8389-8396Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). Activation of ERK1/2 requires dual threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation, both catalyzed by another highly specific kinase, MEK. EGF at concentrations ranging from 1 pm to 100 nm failed to stimulate Ca2+ spiking in A7r5 cells, whereas 50 pm AVP elicited a robust Ca2+-spiking response in the same cells (not shown). Despite its inability to stimulate Ca2+spiking, EGF (10 nm) robustly activated ERK1/2 (Fig.8 A). Salicylate (20 mm) did not prevent EGF-stimulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation (Fig. 8 A), whereas U-0126 (2.5 μm, a selective MEK inhibitor) completely abolished this effect (Fig. 8 B). Phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in response to 100 pm AVP was undetectable in 6 of 9 experiments (Fig. 8 A) and U-0126 did not inhibit AVP-stimulated Ca2+ spiking (Fig.8 C; frequency of Ca2+ spiking in response to 100 pm AVP was 3.8 ± 0.5 min−1 in the absence of U-0126 and 5.3 ± 0.9 min−1 in the presence of U-0126, p > 0.1, n = 4). These results suggest that activation of EGF receptors or ERK1/2 MAPKs is neither necessary nor sufficient to elicit the Ca2+-spiking effect. We next determined whether Kv1.2-delayed rectifier K+channels might be a potential effector for PYK2 in the stimulation of Ca2+ spiking. Kv1.2 channels have been shown to be tyrosine-phosphorylated by PYK2, leading to an inhibition of outward K+ currents in Xenopus oocytes (22Lev S. Moreno H. Martinez R. Canoll P. Peles E. Musacchio J.M. Plowman G.D. Rudy B. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1995; 376: 737-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (1253) Google Scholar). We found that, in A7r5 cells, treatment of the cells with 100 pm AVP significantly increased tyrosine phosphorylation of the Kv1.2 channel protein (Fig. 9 A) and that Kv1.2 channel protein co-immunoprecipitated with PYK2 (Fig.9 B). The amounts of Kv1.2 detected in the PYK2 immunoprecipitates from untreated cells were similar to those from cells treated with 100 pm AVP in five independent experiments (Fig. 9 B and results not shown). AVP-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of Kv1.2 was significantly inhibited by PP2, Ro-31-8220, and salicylate, but not by tyrphostin A47 (% inhibition = 100, 36.9, 31.3, and 18.1, respectively; Fig.9 C). We have identified previously (15Byron K.L. Circ. Res. 19"

Therefore, the elucidation of PrPc gene regulation is important both to define a strategy to control the infection and to better understand PrPc function. We cloned the rat PrPc gene promoter region into a luciferase reporter vector, transfected C6 and PC-12 cells, and isolated clones with stable enzyme expression. The dependence of chromatin conformation on PrPc promoter activity was evaluated using the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, which was able to highly increase not only promoter activity but also PrPc mRNA and protein levels. The phorbol ester (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate) and cAMP poorly induced promoter activity; retinoic acid decreased it by 50%, whereas nerve growth factor and dexamethasone had no effect. When 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate or cAMP but not retinoic acid was associated with trichostatin A, a potentiation of the primary effects was observed. These new data indicate that PrPc gene regulation is highly dependent on disruption of chromatin fiber assembly, which allows some ubiquitous transcription factors accession to specific DNA elements.

Prions cause a variety of neurodegenerative disorders both in animals and humans (1Prusiner S.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 13363-13383Crossref PubMed Scopus (5167) Google Scholar). A wealth of data supports the contention that scrapie prions (PrPsc) 1The abbreviations used are:PrPscscrapie prionsPrPccellular prion proteinTPA12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetateRAretinoic acidRARRA receptorTSAtrichostatin APBSphosphate-buffered salineGAPDHglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenaseCREcAMP-response elementCREBCRE-binding proteinNGFnerve growth factorHDAChistone deacetylase are devoid of nucleic acid and seem to be composed exclusively of a modified isoform of the cellular prion protein (PrPc) (2Stahl N.

Thus, an autocatalytic mechanism initiated by PrPsc-PrPc interaction is the main explanation for prion infectivity (5Cohen F.E. Pan K.M. Huang Z. Baldwin M. Fletterick R.J. Prusiner S.B. Science. 1994; 264: 530-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar). The rate of infection is dependent on the levels of PrPc (6Scott M. Foster D. Mirenda C. Serban D. Coufal F. Walchli M. Torchia M. Groth D. Carlson G. Dearmond S.J. Cell. 1989; 59: 847-857Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (583) Google Scholar), but a precise understanding of the conversion mechanism, its prerequisites, and immediate consequences are hampered because the role of the cellular prion protein is still under investigation. The physiological functions of PrPc were recently described (reviewed in Ref. 7Martins V.R. Mercadante A.F. Cabral A.L. Freitas A.R. Castro R.M. Braz. J. Med. Biol.

Moreover, this protein is also able to bind copper (11Brown D.R. Qin K. Herms J.W. Madlung A. Manson J. Strome R. Fraser P.E. Kruck T. Von Bohlen A. Schulz-Schaeffer W. Giese A. Westaway D. Kretzschmar H. Nature. 1997; 390: 684-687Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), but the antioxidant activity of PrPc-copper complex is still under discussion (12Brown D.R. Schulz-Schaeffer W.J.

PrPc is considered to be a housekeeping gene because its mRNA is constitutively expressed in tissues from adult animals (4Oesch B. Westaway D. Walchli M. Mckinley M.P. Kent S.B. Aebersold R.

However, PrPc is highly regulated during development (16Manson J. West J.D. Thomson V. McBride P. Kaufman M.H. Hope J. Development. 1992; 115: 117-122PubMed Google Scholar), and nerve growth factor (NGF) up-regulates PrPc mRNA expression (17Mobley W.C. Neve R.L. Prusiner S.B. Mckinley M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 9811-9815Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar). In fact, we observed that PC-12 treatment with NGF increases the levels of PrPc protein, which potentiates neurite formation and maintenance, mediated by PrPc interaction with laminin (9Graner E.

Saeki and co-workers (18Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Matsumoto Y. Onodera T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) demonstrated the presence of a promoter region upstream of multiple initiation sites of the rat PrPc gene. This promoter has an inverted CCAAT motif, AP-1- and AP-2-binding sites, and within the region that is critical for promoter activity three Sp-1-binding sites are found (18Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Matsumoto Y. Onodera T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In particular, members of Sp-1 family of transcription factors can act as both positive and negative regulators of gene expression with the latter function being mainly modulated by Sp-1 interaction with histone deacetylase 1 (19Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar). One of the hallmarks of the regulation of gene transcription is local chromatin decondensation mediated by histone acetylation, which leads to a reduced attraction between chromosomal DNA and histones and increases the accession of high molecular weight protein complexes of the transcription machinery. Conversely, histone deacetylase can repress transcription by increasing histone-DNA attraction (reviewed in Ref. 20Kornberg R.D. Lorch Y. Cell. 1999; 98: 285-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1445) Google Scholar). The presence of AP-1 sites on the PrPc gene promoter (18Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Matsumoto Y. Onodera T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) suggests that transcription factors like those belonging to the Jun and Fos family, which are induced by phorbol ester (TPA) (21Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar), could be effectors of PrPc gene regulation. Furthermore, it has been extensively demonstrated in the literature that a large number of transcription factors like CREB (cAMP-regulated protein) and glucocorticoid receptors can associate with Jun and Fos proteins to modulate gene expression (22Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 5: 651-658Google Scholar). In addition, PrPc mRNA levels can be inhibited by retinoic acid (RA) (23Dodelet V.C. Cashman N.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1556-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) whose receptor (RAR) could mediate gene expression via AP-1 and AP-2 transcriptional factors (22Pfahl M. Endocr. Rev. 1993; 5: 651-658Google Scholar, 24Xie W.F. Kondo S. Sandell L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 5026-5032Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and AP-1 element (25Schroen D.J. Brinckerhoff C.E. J. Cell. Physiol. 1996; 169: 320-332Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We observed that trichostatin A (TSA), a potent histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor (26Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), highly increases the PrPc promoter activity in PC-12 (rat pheochromocytoma) and C6 (rat glioma) clones stably transfected with a luciferase reporter vector under control of this promoter. TPA and cAMP up-regulate promoter activity when associated with TSA, whereas RA down-modulates it. NGF and glucocorticoid hormone, known to regulate both NGF and its receptor in glia and neuron (27Scully J.L. Otten U. Neurosci. Lett. 1993; 155: 11-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), were unable to regulate PrPc gene promoter activity. Indeed, PrPc mRNA levels are consistent with promoter activity for most the treatments, and induction of PrPc protein levels is detected in TSA-treated cells. These results indicate that PrPc promoter activity is extremely dependent on chromatin fiber disassembly, which permits the accessibility of specific elements in the DNA to the respective transcription factors. PC-12 and C6 cells were maintained at 37 °C in 5% CO2 atmosphere in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. The concentration of each drug is as follows: NGF (Sigma), 50 ng/ml; dexamethasone (Sigma), 10−6m; TPA (Sigma), 1.6 × 10−6m; cAMP (Sigma) 5 × 10−4m; RA (Biomol) 10−6m; and TSA (Calbiochem), 2.6 × 10−11m. Two oligonucleotides were used as primers (5′-TTAAGTAAGCTTTTAAAGCCACTTCCTG-3′ and 5′-TGCCAAGCTTCTGCCACCGACGCGACG-3′) for Long-PCR to amplify base pairs −2831 to +47 of the rat PrPc gene, as described previously by Saeki et al. (18Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Matsumoto Y. Onodera T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). These primers have HindIII restrictions sites at their 5′ and 3′ ends, and the DNA fragment was amplified using Thermus thermophilus Amersham Biosciences amplification kit. PCR products were digested with HindIII and cloned into the luciferase reporter vector, pGL-3 basic (Promega). Sequencing analysis was performed to check the integrity of the amplified region and the appropriate orientation of the insert. PC-12 and C6 cells were stably transfected using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), with the PrPc promoter luciferase vector and pSV2neo (29Southern P.J. Berg P. J. Mol. Appl. Genet. 1982; 1: 327-341PubMed Google Scholar) at a ratio of 10:1, respectively. After selection in medium containing 0.8 mg/ml active G418 (Sigma), clones were isolated. PC-12 and C6 clones stably transfected with the PrPc promoter luciferase vector were grown on 24-well plates and after each treatment were washed with PBS and harvested in 100 μl of lysis buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 10 mm EDTA, 15% sucrose, 2 mg/ml lysozyme). Luciferase activity was measured using the Promega Luciferase Assay System, and the relative light unit was quantified with a MD3000 Luminometer (Analytical Luminescence Laboratory). The relative luciferase unit was normalized for protein concentration by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar). The luciferase activity of each clone after the different treatments was expressed as relative levels compared with the values obtained for the equivalent clone without treatment. Total RNA was isolated from parental C6 and PC-12 cells treated or not with the different drugs, using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Ten micrograms of RNA from each treatment were fractionated in 1% agarose formaldehyde gels, transferred overnight to Hybond-N (Amersham Biosciences) membranes with 10× SSC, and fixed to the membrane using a UV cross-linker (Fisher). DNA fragments corresponding to mouse PrPc and rat GAPDH (31Fort P. Marty L. Piechaczyk M., El Sabrouty S. Dani C. Jeanteur P. Blanchard J.M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1985; 13: 1431-1442Crossref PubMed Scopus (1972) Google Scholar) were labeled using the Ready-to-Go DNA labeling beads and [α-32P]dCTP (both from Amersham Biosciences) and used as probes to detect PrPc and GAPDH mRNAs (2.1 and 1.2 kb, respectively). Membranes were preincubated with 0.25 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, 7 SDS%, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 1 mm EDTA for 1 h at 65 °C, and this solution was then replaced by a bovine serum albumin-free solution, and labeled probes were added. Membranes were then hybridized for 16 h at 65 °C and subsequently washed with 0.25 mNa2HPO4, pH 7.2, 1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA for 30 min at 65 °C. The autoradiogram was obtained by x-ray film exposition to the membrane. Parental C6 and PC-12 cells grown to near-confluence were treated with TSA (2.6 × 10−11m) for 18 h, washed with PBS, and incubated with lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100) plus protease inhibitors (1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, 2 mm leupeptin, 2 mm aprotinin) at 4 °C for 15 min. Cell extracts were clarified at 22,000 × g, and supernatants were recovered. Protein concentration was measured by the method of Bradford (30Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217508) Google Scholar), and 1 mg of total protein was resolved in SDS-PAGE followed by blotting onto nitrocellulose membranes. Western blots were performed using monoclonal anti-PrPc (6H4 Prionics), monoclonal anti-β-tubulin (Amersham Biosciences), or non-immune mouse IgG followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse IgG peroxidase labeled and developed using the ECL technique (Amersham Biosciences). The non-immune IgG presented no background for the reaction and was omitted in the final figure. Flow cytometry assays were performed using C6 and PC-12 parental cells treated or not with TSA for 18 h. Cells were washed with PBS and incubated with polyclonal anti-PrPc serum (10Graner E. Mercadante A.F. Zanata S.M. Orestes V.F. Cabral A.L.B. Veiga S.S. Juliano M.A. Roesler R. Walz R. Minetti A. Izquierdo I. Martins V.R. Brentani R.R. Brain. Res. Mol. Brain Res. 2000; 76: 85-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar) or non-immune serum for 1 h at 4 °C. Cells were then washed three times, incubated with a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti mouse IgG (Dako) for 1 h at 4 °C, and washed again three times with PBS. Fluorescence was measured with a flow cytometer FACSCAN (Becton Dickinson). Each experiment was done in triplicate, and mean values represent at least three independent experiments. Statistical significance of luciferase assays using just one drug was tested by single mean Student’s t test, and when TSA and other drugs were combined, results were evaluated by the Mann-Whitney test for unpaired samples. In all comparisons,p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. In an attempt to analyze PrPc promoter activity, 12 PC-12 and 6 C6 clones stably transfected with PrPc promoter luciferase vector were generated. Basal luciferase activity of each clone was measured (Table I). The large variation in promoter activity between clones was probably due to the plasmid copy number incorporated or to the place of the genome where they were randomly inserted. Clones with different basal levels were chosen to perform the experiments (PC-12.6, PC-12.8, PC-12.9, and PC-12.11 and C6.1, C6.2, and C6.4), because it is necessary to check if the basal promoter activity levels would not alter the response to different treatments.Table IRelative basal levels of luciferase activity in transfected PC-12 and C6 clonesPC-12 clonesRelative values11213038141566361-aClones selected for study.718411-aClones selected for study.9191-aClones selected for study.1011141-aClones selected for study.125C6 clonesRelative values1491-aClones selected for study.2162,7271-aClones selected for study.3 1411651-aClones selected for study.5161Relative values represent the ratio of luciferase activity in each transfected clone to the respective parental cell.1-a Clones selected for study.

The presence of three Sp-1 sites in the proximal PrPc gene promoter (18Saeki K. Matsumoto Y. Matsumoto Y. Onodera T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 219: 47-52Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and the ability of histone deacetylase to repress gene transcription by binding to Sp-1 transcriptional factors (19Doetzlhofer A. Rotheneder H. Lagger G. Koranda M. Kurtev V. Brosch G. Wintersberger E. Seiser C. Mol. Cel. Biol. 1999; 19: 5504-5511Crossref PubMed Scopus (358) Google Scholar) lead us to investigate the role of chromatin remodeling in its activity. PC-12 and C6 clones were treated for 8–48 h with TSA, a potent histone deacetylase inhibitor (26Yoshida M. Kijima M. Akita M. Beppu T. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 17174-17179Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A large increase on promoter activity from 10 to 4000 times was observed in all clones analyzed (Fig. 1). Thus, these data suggest that chromatin structure has to be disrupted to allow the accession of endogenous transcription factors to specific PrPc promoter-binding sites. In an attempt to test this hypothesis, potential regulators of endogenous transcription factors related with the binding elements within the PrPc promoter were used alone or in combination with TSA to treat PC-12 and C6 clones. The phorbol ester TPA, a potent inducer of both expression and phosphorylation of the AP-1 family members (21Angel P. Imagawa M. Chiu R. Stein B. Imbra R.J. Rahmsdorf H.J. Jonat C. Herrlich P. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 49: 729-739Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2156) Google Scholar), and cAMP are potential candidates to control PrPc gene transcription. Treatment with TPA increased luciferase activity in all PC-12 clones reaching a maximum of 3-fold induction between 2 and 8 h. The effect was less prominent in C6 clones (Fig.2 A). Indeed, it is interesting to note that in all C6 clones, promoter activity decreased to values lower than basal after 18 h of treatment. This effect was not observed in PC-12 clones, suggesting that this pattern may represent a cell type-specific modulation. The effect of cAMP on the PrPc gene promoter was slighter than that mediated by TPA, with 1.5–2 times induction between 8 and 24 h in all PC-12 and one out three C6 clones (Fig. 2 B). Regulation of promoter activity by this compound was also checked for shorter times (data not shown), but no changes were observed. RA was also able to modulate PrPc gene promoter activity (Fig.2 C). With the exception of the C6.4 clone, all others underwent a 50% down-regulation of the PrPc promoter activity after 24 or 72 h of treatment. These results are in agreement with previous data (23Dodelet V.C. Cashman N.R. Blood. 1998; 91: 1556-1561Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showing that RA decreases PrPc mRNA levels in HL-60 cells. Dexamethasone (data not shown), as well as the neurotrophin NGF (TableIII), two potential candidates for PrPc gene transcriptional regulation, had no effect on the promoter activity.Table IIIEffect of NGF association with TSA on PrPc promoter activityClone24 h48 hNGFTSATSA + NGFNGFTSATSA + NGFPC12.61.3 ± 0.4184.7 ± 97.7187.1 ± 94.41.1 ± 0.248.6 ± 24.9318 ± 157.13-ap < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.PC12.81.1 ± 0.6260.7 ± 106274.2 ± 182.21.2 ± 0.3701.9 ± 96.62539 ± 938.23-ap < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.PC12.91.2 ± 0.3246.8 ± 85.5361.9 ± 2321.5 ± 0.5274.6 ± 93.71994.4 ± 768.53-ap < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.PC12.111.1 ± 0.3134.2 ± 66.6414.5 ± 1853-ap < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.1.4 ± 0.264.9 ± 29.11659.8 ± 906.23-ap < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.C6.10.8 ± 0.23000.4 ± 855.73350.5 ± 1997.41.5 ± 0.11362.7 ± 516.2676.2 ± 262.23-ap < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.C6.21.5 ± 0.42.4 ± 0.83.3 ± 13-ap < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.1.2 ± 0.21.8 ± 0.72.4 ± 1.5C6.40.5 ± 0.17 ± 4.225.8 ± 103-ap < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.0.8 ± 0.32.5 ± 0.81.9 ± 0.7The values shown are mean ± S.D. relative luciferase activity (compared with the equivalent clone without treatment) from at least three independent experiments.3-a p < 0.05versus TSA in the equivalent time treatment.

When TPA was combined with TSA for 8 h (TableII), the induction of PrPc promoter activity was potentiated in PC-12, which suggests that disassembly of PrPc promoter chromatin increased the accessibility of transcription factors induced by TPA. On the other hand, TPA association did not change the initial TSA induction in C6 clones. In fact, the different responses observed between PC-12 and C6 cells could be due to their distinct transcription factor composition (32Kapatos G. Stegenga S.L. Hirayama K. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The values shown are mean ± S.D. relative luciferase activity (compared with the equivalent clone without treatment) from at least three independent experiments. cAMP had a small influence on PrPc promoter regulation (Fig.2 B). When combined with TSA for 24 h, it generated distinct results as follows: potentiation of TSA effect in four clones (PC-12.8, PC-12.11, C6.2, and C6.4), a tendency to induce in one (PC-12.6), and a decrease in two (PC-12.9 and C6.1) (Table II). One can argue that the inductive effect is the most prevalent and should represent the real effect, whereas the promoter inhibition seems to be a clonal event. As described previously (Fig. 2 C), retinoic acid treatment down-regulated PrPc promoter activity, and this effect was maintained when TSA was associated (Table II). After 24 h of co-treatment, PC-12.6, PC-12.8, PC-12.9, and C6.1 showed a decrease in the TSA-inductive effect. RA tended to down-regulate the TSA effect in clones C6.2 and C6.4, and it had no activity on clone PC-12.11. NGF did not affect PrPc gene promoter activity but potentiated the induction mediated by TSA treatment for 48 h in all PC-12 clones (Table III). This event seemed to occur earlier (24 h) in two of the C6 clones (C6.2 and C6.4), whereas a different pattern was observed for C6.1. These results suggest that NGF is unable to regulate PrPc promoter activity unless a chromatin disassembly is present. Dexamethasone did not affect promoter activity even after TSA treatment (data not shown), indicating its inability to modulate PrPc transcription regulation. In an attempt to evaluate whether modifications of the PrPc promoter activity are reflected at the mRNA levels, Northern blot assays were performed. PC-12 (Fig.3, A and B) or C6 (Fig. 3, C and D) parental cells were treated with TSA, TPA, cAMP, RA, and NGF as indicated. TSA has a strong positive effect on PrPc mRNA levels, in agreement with our data on promoter activity shown in Fig. 1. The effect was more prominent after 8 than after 24 h of treatment on PC-12 cells (Fig. 3 A). These data confirm the importance of chromatin structure for PrPc gene expression. Cell treatment with TPA increased PrPc mRNA levels and its association with TSA potentiated the effect on PC-12 and C6 cells (Fig.3, A and C). These data correspond to what was observed before for PC-12 cells regarding promoter activity (Figs. 1and 2 and Table II). However, different results were observed for C6 cells because TPA was unable to increase TSA induction of PrPc promoter activity (Table II). RA treatment for 24 h had no apparent effect on PrPc mRNA expression in either cell line (Fig. 3, A and C), which diverges with its respective effect on promoter activity (Fig.2 C). These results might be due to Northern blot sensitivity in detecting repression in an already low basal level of PrPc mRNA (Fig. 3, A and C). However, the inhibition was easily detected in PC-12 and C6 cells previously treated with TSA (Fig.3, A and C), thus confirming that RA represses PrPc gene expression. PrPc mRNA levels were apparently not affected by cAMP in either cell line (Fig. 3, B and D), in agreement with the slight induction (around 1.5-fold) of promoter activity in most clones evaluated (Fig. 2 B). cAMP potentiated the PrPc mRNA induction mediated by TSA in PC-12 but did not affect TSA activity in C6 cells (Fig. 3, B and D). These data agree with what was observed regarding PrPc p"

The coupling of the hydrolysis of ATP to the active transport of Na+ and K+ in the Na+/K+-ATPase (EC 3.6.2.37) takes place through several elementary steps including: (i) the Na+-dependent phosphorylation of the ATPase by ATP, (ii) the K+-activated hydrolysis of the phosphoenzyme thus formed (1Post R.L. Hegyvary C. Kume S. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 6530-6540Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (iii) conformational changes of both the phospho and the dephosphoenzymes, and (iv) the occlusions of Na+ and K+. When occluded, the access of Na+ or K+ to the bulk of the solvent is strongly restricted, probably because they are moving through the ATPase as part of their active transport. K+ can be replaced by Rb+, Cs+, Tl+, or NH 4+ in all the reactions in which it participates. Occlusion of K+ was first proposed on the basis of indirect evidences by Post and co-workers (1Post R.L.

Following Glynn and Karlish (7Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar), we call E 1 the conformer of the pump with high affinity for ATP and for intracellular Na+, which catalyzes the reversible transfer of the terminal phosphate of ATP to the enzyme with formation ofE 1P. E 2 is the conformer of the pump with high affinity for extracellular K+ and low affinity for ATP. E 2 catalyzes the reversible transfer of orthophosphate between E 2P and water. E 1 and E 2 also differ in their spectroscopic properties (8Karlish S.J.D. Yates D.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1978; 527: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and in their reactivity to proteolytic enzymes (9Joergensen P.L. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 401: 399-415Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Extracellular K+ binds to the E 2P (Reaction a in Scheme 1) remaining exchangeable with the medium until Pi is released leaving K+ occluded inE 2. In agreement with other authors (see Ref. 7Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) we call this the physiological route of occlusion because it not only requires the physiological operation of the pump but seems to be a necessary step of this operation (4Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Schwarzbaum P.J. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20779-20790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Occluded K+ is released into the intracellular medium (Reactions c-e in Scheme 1). This step is accelerated about 200 times after intracellular ATP binds toE 2(K+ n )occluded(Reactions d-e in Scheme 1). This effect does not involve the hydrolysis of ATP and is exerted at a site whose affinity is much lower than that of the active site of the ATPase (3Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11104-11115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 4Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Schwarzbaum P.J. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol.

Acta. 1978; 527: 115-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Occlusion of K+ can also be attained by the reversal of Reaction c in Scheme 1. As in previous papers (see Ref. 7Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) we call this thedirect route because it does not involve other intermediates than those formed between K+ and the enzyme. Occlusion through the direct route leads to the equilibrium distribution between free and occluded K+, while the physiological route leads to a steady state, whose duration will depend on the supply of ATP and on the accumulation of Pi and ADP (7Glynn I.M. Karlish S.J.D. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1990; 59: 171-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). Under physiological conditions, a small fraction of the pump units exchange intra- for extracellular K+(K+/K+ exchange (10Karlish S.J.D. Stein W.D. J. Physiol. 1982; 328: 295-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar)). This requires Pi and needs but does not consume ATP and does not lead to net transport. It probably expresses the reversible shuttling of the ATPase between the states shown in Reactions a-e of Scheme 1. Hence, direct as well as physiological occlusion routes would be used during the normal operation of the pump. Scheme 1 and Fig. 1 also show that occlusion can follow the binding of K+ toE 1ATP. This will not be considered here (but see Ref. 11González-Lebrero R.M. Kaufman S.B. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5922-5928Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). During the physiological operation of the pump, the value of the coefficient “n” in Scheme 1 and Fig. 1 seems to be two (4Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Schwarzbaum P.J. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 20779-20790Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 5Rossi R.C. Nørby J.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12579-12590Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) since occlusion only takes place when two K+ (or Rb+) ions are bound. This is consistent with the observation that 2 K+ ions are transported in each Na+/K+-ATPase cycle (12Garrahan P.J. Glynn I.M. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1967; 192: 217-235Crossref Scopus (179) Google Scholar). There is no a priori reason for positing that the two occlusion routes lead to the same enzyme states as it is assumed in Scheme 1 and Fig. 1. On the basis that in general, only identical intermediates having identical distribution will show the same kinetic behavior, we studied the kinetics of deocclusion in media containing different concentrations of Pi or ATP. Studies of this kind have been performed by Forbush (3Forbush III, B. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 11104-11115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) but because of his setting he could not discard the possibility that “different but related occluded states could interconvert.” This proviso does not apply to our experimental procedure (13Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Moreover, the results presented here extend the conditions employed both by Forbush and by ourselves (14González-Lebrero R.M. Kaufman S.B. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. Excerpta Med. Int. Congr. Ser. 2000; 120: 433-436Google Scholar), to a much wider range of ATP or Pi concentrations. The second part of this paper is an analysis of the equilibrium distribution between free and occluded Rb+ and of the kinetics of formation and breakdown of enzyme states holding occluded Rb+ using the direct route. Na+/K+-ATPase was partially purified from pig kidney (15Jensen J. Nørby J.G. Ottolenghi P. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 1984; 346: 219-241Crossref Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The specific activity at the time of preparation ranged from 19 to 28 μmol of Pimin−1 (mg protein)−1 measured at 37 °C in media with 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm KCl, 3 mm ATP, 4 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm imidazole-HCl, pH 7.4. The variability in specific activity was reflected in the maximal amount of occluded rubidium obtained (Rbocc, max) but in all cases the molar ratio Rbocc, max/(ADP-binding sites) was not significantly different from 2. [86Rb]RbCl and [32P]orthophosphoric acid were from PerkinElmer Life Science. [γ-32P]ATP was synthesized using the procedure of Glynn and Chappell (16Glynn I.M. Chappell J.B. Biochem. J. 1964; 90: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (1257) Google Scholar), except that no unlabeled orthophosphate (Pi) was added. All other reagents were of analytical grade. Incubations were performed at 25 °C in media containing 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) and 0.25 mm EDTA. The concentrations of other components varied according to the experiments and are indicated under “Results.” Before starting a reaction, the components to be mixed were diluted in the reaction media. Control experiments (not shown) indicated that, under the conditions used, the enzyme retained its activity for up to 240 min long incubation. Following Rossi et al. (13Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar), quenching of occlusion reactions was attained by means of the quick drop in temperature, in ligand concentrations and in free [86Rb]Rb+. Occluded Rb+ was considered equal to that retained by the enzyme after washing with at least 300 ml of an ice-cold washing solution containing 30 mm KCl and 20 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4 at 0 °C) flowing at a rate of 40 ml/s. The procedure uses a rapid-mixing apparatus (RMA) 1RMArapid mixing apparatus (SFM4 from Bio-Logic, France) connected to a quenching and washing chamber. Depending on the incubation time, the occlusion reactions were performed either in a test tube or in the RMA, but in all cases the reaction was stopped injecting the enzyme suspension from the RMA into the quenching and washing chamber at a flow rate of 1–5 ml/s (13Rossi R.C.

Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). rapid mixing apparatus 70 to 150 μg/ml of Na+/K+-ATPase were incubated during 15 to 120 min in media with [86Rb]RbCl. Blanks were estimated from the amount of [86Rb]Rb+ retained by the filters when the enzyme was omitted. Their values were similar to those obtained with heat-inactivated enzyme (30 min at 65 °C) or with native enzyme in media with 40 mm Na+. Blank values, which were usually much lower than 10% of the amount of occluded [86Rb]Rb+, were independent of the mass of enzyme and linearly related to the Rb+ concentration (13Rossi R.C. Kaufman S.B. González-Lebrero R.M. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Anal. Biochem. 1999; 270: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). 95 to 110 μg/ml Na+/K+-ATPase was incubated with [86Rb]RbCl in media containing NaCl, MgCl2, and micromolar ATP. Incubation lasted for 3 s to ensure steady-state conditions. Blanks were estimated from samples lacking ATP. Enzyme suspension (222 μg of protein/ml) in 25 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) and 0.25 mm EDTA, was mixed in the RMA with an equal volume of the same medium having different concentrations of [86Rb]RbCl and incubated for different lengths of time. Then, 0.57 ml of the incubation mixture was squirted into the quenching and washing chamber. This was done looking at the decrease of occluded [86Rb]Rb+ after isotopic dilution of the [86Rb]Rb+. When the effects of ATP or Pi were compared, 1 volume of the incubation suspension containing the occluded species was mixed with 1 volume of a solution having sufficient unlabeled Rb+ as to give a 100- or 200-fold decrease in the specific activity of [86Rb]Rb+ and to set [Rb+] at 10 mm. When the kinetics of deocclusion was studied using Rb+ as the only pump ligand, isotopic dilution was attained adding enough of a solution of identical composition as to cause a 20-fold decrease in the specific activity of [86Rb]Rb+. This was measured as the amount of [32P]Pi released from [γ-32P]ATP, according to the method described by Schwarzbaum et al. (17Schwarzbaum P.J. Kaufman S.B. Rossi R.C. Garrahan P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1233: 33-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) slightly modified to quantitatively extract the Pi present in the media. Incubation time was short enough as to prevent the hydrolysis of more than 10% of the ATP present and to ensure initial rate conditions. Enzyme concentration was 8 μg of protein/ml and blanks consistent in an assay were all the Na+ in the medium was replaced by K+. Equations were adjusted to the results by nonlinear regression using commercial programs (Excel 7.0 for WindowsTM and Sigma-PlotTM 2.0 for WindowsTM). The goodness of fit of a given equation to the experimental results was evaluated by the AIC criterion (18Yamaoka K. Nakagawa T. Uno T. J. Pharmacokin. Biopharm. 1978; 6: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1936) Google Scholar) defined as AIC = N ln(SS) + 2P, with N = number of data,P = number of parameters, and SS = sum of weighted square residual errors. Unitary weights were considered in all cases. It is obvious that AIC values may be positive or negative. The best equation was considered that which gave the lower value of AIC. To test kinetic models we developed a procedure (19González-Lebrero R.M. Caracterización cinética del fenómeno de oclusión de K+ en la Na+/K+-ATPasa.Ph.D. thesis. University of Buenos Aires, 2001Google Scholar) for its use inMathematica TM for Windows TM (version. 4.1). This includes the following steps. (i) The set of differential equations that describe the model together with the corresponding conservation equations is worked out; (ii) initial values are assigned heuristically to the rate constants and to the total enzyme concentration (E T ), then the numerical solutions of the set of differential equations is obtained; (iii) the solutions are compared with the experimental values and the rate constants and E T are corrected using a procedure based on the Gauss-Newton algorithm (20Fraser R.D.B. Suzuki E. Leach S.J. Physical Principles and Techniques of Protein Chemistry: Part C. Academic Press, New York1973: 301-355Google Scholar); (iv) the corrected values are used to obtain a new set of numerical solutions; and (v) steps iii and iv are repeated until the standard deviation of the residual errors reaches a minimal constant value. We measured the amount of occluded [86Rb]Rb+ (Rbocc) remaining at different times after isotopic dilution in media with different concentrations of either ATP or Pi. A good description of the time course of deocclusion was obtained with the sum of two exponential functions of time plus a time-independent term (Equation 1below). Regression analysis to fit exponentials can yield strong statistical correlation between rate coefficients (k values) and amplitudes (A values). This leads to high standard errors of the parameters, which may affect the evaluation of the significance of differences between two sets of values. To circumvent this, we also compared the data by means of a graphical procedure. This was based on the fact that, if the kinetics of deocclusion were the same for the enzyme states formed via the two routes of occlusion then the time courses of Rb+ loss from both kind of intermediates should differ only in a constant factor contained in the initial amount of occluded Rb+. The effect of this factor can be canceled out by dividing each data value by the initial amount of occluded Rb+ (Rb occ,0). This procedure is simpler and relies on less assumptions than that we had used before, which took into account Rbocc when time tends to infinity (14González-Lebrero R.M. Kaufman S.B. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. Excerpta Med. Int. Congr. Ser. 2000; 120: 433-436Google Scholar). We calculated Rb occ,0extrapolating the function that we had used during regression. Fig. 2 shows the time course of [86Rb]Rbocc formed by either the physiological (panel A) or the direct (panel B) routes and incubated for deocclusion in media of identical composition containing 0 (only in panel B), 10 or 100 μmATP. The value of Rb occ,0 obtained by the direct route was larger than that obtained by the physiological route (cf. panels A and B) because during steady-state hydrolysis of ATP at limiting [Rb+], enzyme states not containing occluded Rb+, such as phosphoenzymes, will represent a significant fraction of the total amount of enzyme. It is clear that ATP induced a large increase in the rate of loss of occluded [86Rb]Rb+. As already mentioned, a good description of the whole set of results was obtained using the sum of two exponential functions of time plus a time-independent term corresponding to the amount of Rb+ that remains occluded when the time after dilution tends to infinity, i.e. Rbocc=A1e−k1t+A2e−k2t+A∞Equation 1 The best fitting values of the parameters of Equation 1 are given in Table I and were used to calculate the continuous lines in Fig. 2. For comparative purposes, Table I also includes the values of the parameters obtained by fitting to the same data a single exponential function of time plus a constant term; these were used to draw the dotted lines in Fig. 2 (panels A and B). As judged from the values of sum of squares (SS) and AIC in Table I it is apparent that Equation 1 gives a better description of the results. As mentioned above we also performed a graphical comparison of the two set of data. Plots of the time course of deocclusion normalized forRb occ,0 in media with 10 or 100 μmATP are given in panels C and D, respectively. It can be seen that the experimental points for the two occlusion routes are almost superimposable. It is noteworthy that the value ofA ∞ cannot be fully explained by the new isotopic equilibrium reached after dilution of [86Rb]Rb+. If this were so residual Rbocc (A ∞) should be 100 or 200 times less than Rb occ,0 (i.e.,A 1 + A 2 +A ∞) whereas as shown in Table I, the actual values of A ∞ were significantly higher.Table IRegression analysis of the results in Fig. 1 using Equation 1 or a single exponential plus a constantEquation 110 μm ATP100 μm ATPDirectPhysiologicalDirectPhysiologicalA 1 (nmol/mg)3.15 ± 0.131.53 ± 0.363.04 ± 0.272.01 ± 0.18k 1 (s−1)1.151 ± 0.0802.14 ± 0.799.1 ± 1.19.3 ± 1.4A 2(nmol/mg)1.24 ± 0.141.11 ± 0.411.66 ± 0.290.62 ± 0.20k 2(s−1)0.136 ± 0.0210.36 ± 0.150.72 ± 0.301.27 ± 0.58A ∞(nmol/mg)0.510 ± 0.0250.402 ± 0.0500.051-aSince it tended to give a small, negative fitting value, this parameter was fixed atRb occ,0/100.0.292 ± 0.038SS0.03300.02460.03650.0180AIC−54.80−27.06−35.3−42.21Single exponential plus constant10 μm ATP100 μm ATPDirectPhysiologicalDirectPhysiologicalA(nmol/mg)3.99 ± 0.132.29 ± 0.123.579 ± 0.0622.357 ± 0.089k(s−1)0.664 ± 0.0570.91 ± 0.127.33 ± 0.355.97 ± 0.53A ∞(nmol/mg)0.680 ± 0.0600.483 ± 0.0621.122 ± 0.0540.385 ± 0.042SS0.5230.08940.05360.0567AIC−6.33−18.15−32.05−31.301-a Since it tended to give a small, negative fitting value, this parameter was fixed atRb occ,0/100. Open table in a new tab We also measured the release of occluded Rb+ into media containing from 0 to 2500 μm ATP. A single exponential function of time plus a constant term was adjusted to the data for each ATP concentration since this gave sufficient quantitative information for performing paired comparisons of deocclusion rates. The best fitting values of the rate coefficients are plotted as a function of [ATP] in Fig. 3. The continuous curves in the figure show that the effect of ATP on them can be adequately described by a hyperbolic function. k=(k∞−k0)[ATP][ATP]+KATP+k0Equation 2 The results in Fig. 3 make it clear that the parameters of Equation 2 are the same regardless of the route followed to occlude Rb+. We looked at the time course of loss of occluded [86Rb]Rb+ formed either through the direct or the physiological routes in media containing from 0 to 8 mmPi. All media also contained 2.5 μm ATP to ensure equal exposure to the nucleotide in all samples. The data were analyzed both by regression and by the graphical method. Fig. 4 shows that Pi induced a large increase in the rate of deocclusion and that at all Pi concentrations the shape of the time courses is the same regardless of the route of occlusion (panels C–G). The results were adequately fitted by Equation 1. Since regression showed that A 1 and A 2 had values that were not significantly different, a more economical fit was obtained by setting A 1 =A 2 = A in Equation 1. Results in Fig.4 also show that Rb occ,0 (see also Fig.5, panel C) was smaller for the species occluded by the direct route. This is fully explained by the decrease induced by Mg2+ in the equilibrium level of Rbocc (11González-Lebrero R.M. Kaufman S.B. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol.

Table II and legend to Fig. 3). All the parameters of Pi-stimulated deocclusion were practically independent of the route of occlusion. Therefore, as in the case of ATP, the kinetics of the deocclusion accelerated by Pi was the same regardless of the route followed to reach occlusion.Table IIEffect of P i on the rate of [86Rb]Rb+deocclusionParameterOcclusion routePanel A (k 1)Panel B (k 2)PhysiologicalDirectPhysiologicalDirectk 0(s−1)0.5 ± 0.30.5 ± 0.50.15 ± 0.050.15 ± 0.02k ∞ (s−1)20.5 ± 0.920 ± 23.4 ± 0.13.05 ± 0.09K 0.5(mm)2.2 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.82.4 ± 0.32.9 ± 0.3Best-fitting values (±1 S.E.) of the parameters in Equation 3 used to draw the continuous lines in Fig. 5.

According to Scheme 1, the effect of Pi on deocclusion is caused by the stimulation by Pi of the reversal of Reaction b. This view is supported by the observations by Forbush (21Forbush III, B. Skou J.C. Nørby J.G Maunsbach A.B. Esmann M. The Na+,K+-Pump. Part A, Molecular Aspects. Alan Liss, Inc., New York1988: 229-248Google Scholar) that Rb+ (K+) is released into the suspending medium of right-side out membrane vesicles loaded with Pi, following the incorporation of Mg2+ into the intravesicular medium. To check this we looked at the effect of Pi on the ATPase activity. Inhibition of the ATPase by Pi is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for attributing the activation of deocclusion by Pi to the reversal of Reaction b in Scheme 1. Fig. 6 shows the results of our measurements of steady-state ATP hydrolysis as a function of [Pi] in media of identical composition and temperature as those used in the deocclusion experiments. Pi acted as a partial inhibitor of the ATPase reducing its activity to about half when [Pi] tended to infinity. Inhibition took place along a hyperbola that was half-maximal at 0.86 ± 0.12 mmPi (continuous line in Fig. 6). The figure also shows that the effect of Pi is enhanced by increasing [Mg2+]. If reversal of Reaction b in Scheme 1 were the cause of acceleration of deocclusion by Pi then it should be accompanied by the phosphorylation of the enzyme. Our attempts to measure EP formation from Pi at the same conditions as those used in the experiments shown in Fig. 6 yielded phosphoenzyme levels, which were a small fraction of the blanks and that therefore gave too much scatter as to allow reliable conclusions (experiments not shown). Low levels of EP under analogous conditions as those used by us has been reported by others (22Post R.L. Taniguchi K. Toda G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 242: 80-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) and could be explained ifE 2P were formed fromE 2(Rb2) with an overall rate constant (20 s−1, see values of k 2in Fig. 5, panel C, and in Table II), which is much slower than the rate constant for breakdown of E 2P at nonlimiting concentration of Rb+ (at least 230 s−1 (4Kaufman S.B.

We measured occlusion and deocclusion of Rb+ via the direct route with Rb+ as the only pump ligand. Na+/K+-ATPase in media containing Rb+ concentrations going from 3 to 228 μm was incubated at 25 °C for periods ranging from 0.037 to 180 s and then Rbocc was measured.

The activity of ENaC is tightly regulated in order to ensure ion and volume homeostasis of the extra- and intracellular milieu. This regulation is under the control of several hormones and intracellular factors by mechanisms that are not yet completely understood (1Garty H. Palmer L.G. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 359-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (1033) Google Scholar). The idea that proteases can modulate the activity of epithelial amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels is not new. Both extracellular and intracellular effects of proteases on epithelial amiloride-sensitive Na+ channels have been reported. Garty and Edelman (2Garty H. Edelman I.S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1983; 81: 785-803Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar) observed that extracellular trypsin, at a concentration of 1 mg/ml, induced an irreversible inhibition of the sodium transport in toad urinary bladder and that this effect could be prevented by amiloride. Lewis and Alles (3Lewis S.A. Alles W.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 5345-5348Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) studied the effects of proteases such as kallikrein, urokinase, and plasmin and observed that these proteases converted a normally highly selective amiloride-sensitive Na+ channel into a nonselective cation channel. Chraibi et al. (4Chraibi A. Vallet V. Firsov D. Hess S.K. Horisberger J.D. J. Gen. Physiol. 1998; 111: 127-138Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) found that trypsin, at a concentration of 2 μg/ml, increased the amiloride-sensitive current up to 20-fold when added to the bathing solution of ENaC-expressingXenopus oocytes. Jovov et al. (5Jovov B. Wills N.K. Donaldson P.J. Lewis S.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1990; 259: C869-C882Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that A6 cells (derived from Xenopus laevis kidney) express and secrete a kallikrein-like serine protease from their apical side. This serine protease has been cloned and named channel-activating protease (CAP1) (6Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Masilamani et al. (7Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) suggested that activation of Na+ currents by aldosterone is mediated by CAP1 that in turn cleaves γ-ENaC in the early portion of extracellular loop (7Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar). Until now, this hypothesis has not been tested. An intracellular effect of trypsin on ENaC immunopurified from human lymphocytes and incorporated in planar lipid bilayers was reported by Ismailov et al. (8Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Bradford A.L. Lifton R.P. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C214-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) who studied Liddle's disease. Liddle's disease is a form of human hypertension caused by mutations in the β- and γ-subunit of ENaC. Many of the described mutations result in truncation of the C termini of either the β- or γ-subunit of ENaC. It is likely that the increased channel activity seen in patients with Liddle's disease is due to both increased ENaC cell surface expression and increased channel open probability (9Ji H.L. Fuller C.M. Benos D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37693-37704Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Ismailov et al.(8Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Bradford A.L.

Intracellular addition of trypsin to lymphocyte Na+ channels obtained from patients with Liddle's disease did not further increase single channelPo.Recent analysis of protein motifs in some members of the DEG/ENaC family revealed the presence of protease prodomains and protease inhibitor motifs. The presence of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor motif that inhibits serine proteases was described by Tavernarakis et al. (10Tavernarakis N. Everett J.K. Kyrpides N.C. Driscoll M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R205-R208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) in the N terminus of α-ENaC subunit. In addition, two nematode proteins, MEC-2 and UNC-1, contain a domain implicated in proteolysis of membrane-associated proteins (11Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Kyrpides N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). These finding led to the suggestion that members of the DEG/ENaC family may be regulated by, or may themselves participate in, proteolysis as an important part of the regulatory mode of these channels (11Tavernarakis N. Driscoll M. Kyrpides N.C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 425-427Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar).Despite numerous biophysical studies that demonstrated the functional effects of serine proteases on ENaC, there are no biochemical data demonstrating proteolysis of any ENaC subunit by trypsin. In this study, we showed that in vitro translated β- and γ-subunits of ENaC can be cleaved by trypsin in the nanogram/ml range and that the most susceptible trypsin cleavage sites are in the C termini of these β- and γ-subunits. We also demonstrate that 2 μg/ml trypsin (the lowest concentration used in functional studies so far) is enough to digest completely each of the three ENaC subunits.RESULTSWe have shown previously that exposure of the “cytoplasmic” surface of purified lymphocyte Na+ channel protein incorporated into planar bilayers to 0.5 mg/ml trypsin increasedPo 5-fold. Moreover, these trypsinized channels resembled, in their conductance and gating characteristics, channels purified from lymphocytes obtained from confirmed Liddle's patients (8Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Bradford A.L. Lifton R.P. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C214-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To test whether trypsin produced comparable effects on ENaC, we transiently transfected 3T3-fibroblasts with α-, β-, γ-rENaC and recorded ENaC in excised patches using the inside-out mode of the patch clamp technique. As can be seen in Fig.1, 5-pS, Na+-selective channels were recorded. After a 5-min exposure to 0.25 mg/ml trypsin, single channel Po increased, and the channel remained essentially in its open state. No effect was seen of 50 μg/ml intracellular trypsin after 5 min of exposure onPo recorded from inside-out patches of ENaC-expressing oocyte membranes (not shown). These results are comparable with those reported for the lymphocyte channel (8Ismailov I.I. Berdiev B.K. Fuller C.M. Bradford A.L. Lifton R.P. Warnock D.G. Bubien J.K. Benos D.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: C214-C223Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because CAPs are thought to work from the extracellular surface of the membrane (6Vallet V. Chraibi A. Gaeggeler H.P. Horisberger J.D. Rossier B.C. Nature. 1997; 389: 607-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), we tested the effects of extracellular trypsin on ENaC activity. For these experiments we used ENaC incorporated into planar lipid bilayers (Fig. 2). The addition of 0.25 mg/ml trypsin to the trans (i.e. outside) bathing solution activated ENaC. The lowest concentration of trypsin that can affect ENaC incorporated into planar lipid bilayers from either side was 200 μg/ml. However, this activation was time-dependent. Prolonged exposure resulted in a deterioration of the functional integrity of the channel and, ultimately, loss of any discernible gating. Thus, both extracellular and intracellular trypsin can “activate” ENaC.Figure 2Effect of trans(extracellular) trypsin on ENaC reconstituted into planar lipid bilayers. Bilayers were bathed with symmetrical 100 mmNaCl, 10 mm MOPS. Trypsin was added to transcompartment of the bilayer chamber in the concentration indicated. Holding potential was +100 mV and referred to the virtually groundedtrans chamber. For illustration purposes records shown were digitally filtered at 100 Hz using pCLAMP software (Axon Instruments).

(7Masilamani S. Kim G.H. Mitchell C. Wade J.B. Knepper M.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 104: R19-R23Crossref PubMed Scopus (621) Google Scholar) hypothesized that CAP1 activates ENaC by a proteolytic cleavage mechanism in the first portion of the extracellular loop of the γ-ENaC subunit. To test this hypothesis, we prepared a construct of γ-ENaC truncated at a predicted proteolytic site (Δ2–136) and examined amiloride-sensitive Na+currents in oocytes expressing wild type α-, β-, γ-rENaC, or rENaC that contained this N-terminal truncated (Δ2–138) γ-rENaC subunit (Fig. 3). Amiloride-sensitive Na+ currents in oocytes expressing this construct were significantly lower than in oocytes expressing wild type rENaC. This finding is in contrast to the predicted activation of ENaC by CAP1 proteolytic cleavage of the γ-subunit. These findings were expected because we have found previously (17Chalfant M.L. Denton J.S. Langloh A.L. Karlson K.H. Loffing J. Benos D.J. Stanton B.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 32889-32896Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) that elimination of the N terminus of the γ-subunit diminishes macroscopic Na+currents in oocytes. As further support of this idea, experiments were conducted in planar lipid bilayers into which wild type α, wild type β, and N-terminal truncated (Δ2–138) γ-rENaC were incorporated. The single channels that were seen were indistinguishable from the wild type, i.e. no change in single channel conductance or open probability was measured, suggesting that the elimination of the early portion of the γ-subunit was not detrimental to the integrity of the functional channels recorded (data not shown). Although the mechanisms by which serine proteases activate ENaC are not clear, functional studies demonstrated that both extracellular and intracellular trypsin can activate ENaC.Because all three rENaC subunits contain numerous trypsin proteolytic sites, our goal in these biochemical studies was to discover the most susceptible trypsin proteolytic cleavage sites within the rENaC subunits. Immunopurified, epitope tag-labeled rENaC subunits (synthesized by in vitro transcription and translation) were used as a source of subunit proteins for trypsin digestion. A schematic representation of each ENaC subunit with corresponding truncation points and positions of epitope tags in each subunit is shown in Fig.4. The locations of the N- and C-terminal truncations of β- and γ-rENaC subunits are labeled bydouble horizontal lines, and the number of the last amino acid before the truncation is indicated. The position of the epitope tag in the extracellular loop of each subunit is shown as asmall black box with the number of the starting and ending amino acid. We used non-glycosylated forms of in vitrotranslated proteins (the transcription mixture did not contain microsomes) for simplicity. Transcription of each construct in this condition resulted in a protein band of the appropriate size (Figs.Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8, Figure 9, lane 1). Trypsinization was performed in TBS at 37 °C for 2 h. By using different concentrations of trypsin, we determined that 2 μg/ml trypsin was sufficient to digest completely all three subunits of ENaC (Figs. 5, A andB, 6, A and B, and 8A). To unmask the most susceptible proteolytic site in each subunit, we decreased the concentration of trypsin 1000-fold and exposed each protein subunit to four different concentrations of trypsin, namely 0.002, 0.02, 0.2, and 2 μg/ml. The proteolytic mixture was analyzed using both 8 and 15% SDS-PAGE. Proteolysis of the α-subunit by trypsin in the range of 0.002–0.2 μg/ml did not result in any visible proteolytic fragments (Fig. 5,A and B). However, 2 μg/ml trypsin completely disintegrated the α-rENaC subunit (Fig. 5, A andB). We also examined the time course of proteolysis by trypsin at 5, 10, 20, and 40 min using 0.02 μg/ml trypsin (data not shown). We did not observe any visible proteolytic fragments at these time points. These results suggest that either all α-rENaC trypsinization sites have a similar susceptibility to trypsin or our experimental conditions are not sensitive enough to detect subtle differences in trypsin effects. Tavarnarakis et al. (10Tavernarakis N. Everett J.K. Kyrpides N.C. Driscoll M. Curr. Biol. 2001; 11: R205-R208Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) described the presence of a Kunitz-type protease inhibitor motif in the N terminus of α-ENaC subunit. It is possible that this protease inhibitor motif protects the α-rENaC subunit from proteolysis at low trypsin concentrations, but 2 μg/ml trypsin is sufficient to overcome this inhibitory effect. By using the same experimental conditions and detection techniques, we found that trypsinization of β-rENaC with 0.002–0.2 μg/ml trypsin resulted in proteolytic fragments (Fig.6A and Fig. 5B). Analysis using 8% SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6A) revealed that trypsinization of β-rENaC produced a double band. The higher band had the same molecular mass as the non-cut protein, and the lower band was 7–8 kDa lower than the non-cut band protein, suggesting a reduction in size due to trypsinization. Similar results were obtained by trypsinization of β-rENaC with 0.02 μg/ml trypsin at 5-, 10-, 20-, and 40-min time points (data not shown). All samples measured at each of these time points contained double bands. There was a decrease in the intensity of the higher band with a concomitant increased intensity of the lower band with time, consistent with a time-dependent proteolytic process. Analysis of trypsinized β-rENaC using 15% SDS-gel electrophoresis (Fig. 6B) revealed the presence of a small (7–8 kDa) band that was visible when 0.02 or 0.2 μg/ml was used for trypsinization. Detection of this 7–8-kDa band on a 15% gel suggests that the reduction in size of β-rENaC resulted from proteolytic cleavage at one side of the protein chain, rather than occurring at multiple sites.Figure 4Transmembrane model of epitope tag α-, β-, and γ-rENaC subunits, including points of N- and C-terminal truncation of β- and γ-rENaC used in this study.

The N-terminally truncated construct had a deletion of 49 amino acids at the N terminus, whereas the C-terminally truncated construct had a deletion of the last 74 amino acids from the C terminus. Our hypothesis was that if trypsin cuts the C terminus of β-rENaC in close proximity to the point of truncation, the C-terminally truncated construct would be unaffected. In this case, the N-terminally truncated construct would be cut, resulting in a similar pattern as non-truncated β-rENaC (just lower molecular mass) and vice versa. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 7. Trypsinization of N-truncated β-rENaC using 0.002–0.2 μg (Fig. 7A) resulted in the appearance of a doublet on 8% gels, a higher band with the same molecular mass as the non-trypsinized protein, and band that was 7–8 kDa lower than the non-trypsinized protein. Trypsinization of C-terminally truncated β-rENaC using trypsin in the range from 0.002 to 0.2 μg/ml did not reveal any proteolytic fragments; a single band without any shift in molecular mass was observed after trypsin treatment (Fig. 9B). These results suggest that the site of trypsin cleavage occurs within the C terminus domain of β-rENaC. Indeed, analysis of the protein structure of β-rENaC in close proximity (±7 amino acids) from the point of the C-terminal truncation (amino acid 564) revealed the presence of five potential trypsin cleavage sites, i.e. four arginines and one lysine (Fig.7C). Thus, we suggest that the most susceptible trypsin cleavage site within β-rENaC is in close proximity to the point of truncation at amino acid 564 of the C-terminally truncated β-rENaC used in this study. This C-terminally truncated β-rENaC is identical to the β-ENaC truncation mutant (R564stop) identified in the proband of Liddle's disease (18Tamura H. Schild L. Enomoto N. Matsui N. Marumo F. Rossier B.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1996; 97: 1780-1784Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar).We next tested the effect of trypsinization on the γ-rENaC subunit (Fig. 8, A and B). Analysis of the proteolytic mixture using an 8% SDS gel (Fig.6A) revealed that γ-rENaC ran as a doublet following trypsinization (0.002–0.2 μg). The higher band ran at ∼71 kDa (the same as the non-trypsinized protein), and the lower band ran at 63 kDa (a 7–8 kDa difference in molecular mass) suggesting a reduction in size due to trypsinization. The presence of this 7–8-kDa band on a 15% gel (Fig. 8B) subsequent to trypsinization suggested that the reduction in size of γ-rENaC was a result of proteolytic cleavage at one proteolytic site, as opposed to multiple cleavage sites. The appearance of a doublet in 8% gels was also seen following trypsinization of γ-rENaC with 0.02 μg/ml trypsin at time points of 5, 10, 20, and 40 min (data not shown). A double band with decreasing intensity of the higher molecular mass band and increasing intensity of the lower band was observed as a function of time. To delineate further whether the C or N terminus of γ-rENaC was cleaved by trypsin, we used C- and N-terminally truncated constructs of γ-rENaC (Fig. 4). The N-terminally truncated γ-rENaC construct was missing the first 53 amino acids. The C-terminally truncated construct had the last 75 amino acids deleted. Our hypothesis was the same as that for β-rENaC, namely that if trypsin cut the C terminus of γ-rENaC, the C-terminally truncated construct will not be cut and the N-terminally truncated construct will be cut. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 8. Incubation of N-truncated γ-rENaC with 0.002–0.2 μg of trypsin (Fig. 8A) resulted in the appearance of a doublet on an 8% gel. The higher band had the same molecular mass as the non-trypsinized protein, and the lower band was 7–8 kDa smaller than the non-trypsinized protein. This result suggested that trypsin cut the C terminus of γ-rENaC in close proximity to amino acid 574. Again, an analysis of the protein structure of the C terminus of γ-rENaC revealed the presence of four potential trypsin cleavage sites, namely two lysine and two arginines (Fig.9C). Trypsinization of C-terminally truncated γ-rENaC did not reveal any proteolytic fragments. Only one band without a shift in molecular weight was observed (Fig. 9B). This result supports our finding that the most susceptible trypsin site of γ-rENaC is in very close proximity to amino acid 574. This C-terminally truncated γ-rENaC is identical to the truncation mutant (R574stop) identified in Liddle's disease (18Tamura H. Schild L. Enomoto N. Matsui N. Marumo F. Rossier B.C. J. Clin.

An empirical equation, with the restrictions imposed by the stoichiometry of ligand binding was fitted to the data. This allowed us to identify which states of the enzyme were present in each condition and to work out the schemes and equations that describe the equilibria between the ATPase, Rb+, and ATP, Mg2+, or Na+. These equations were fitted to the corresponding experimental data to find out the values of the equilibrium constants of the reactions connecting the different enzyme states. The three ligands decreased the apparent affinity for Rb+ occlusion without affecting the occlusion capacity. With [ATP] tending to infinity, enzyme species with one or two occluded Rb+ seem to be present and full occlusion seems to occur in enzymes saturated with the nucleotide. In contrast, when either [Mg2+] or [Na+] tended to infinity no occlusion was detectable. Both Mg2+and Na+ are displaced by Rb+ through a process that seems to need the binding and occlusion of two Rb+, which suggests that in these conditions Rb+ occlusion regains the stoichiometry of the physiological operation of the Na+ pump.

In media in which Rb+ is the only ligand of the Na+/K+-ATPase both the kinetics of direct occlusion and deocclusion and the equilibrium distribution between free and occluded Rb+ seem to indicate that either one or two Rb+ can be occluded per Na+/K+-ATPase molecule (1González-Lebrero R.M.

This contrasts with the experimental evidence that under physiological conditions occlusion takes place only when two Rb+ are trapped per enzyme molecule. This contradiction may be caused because in physiological conditions other pump ligands are also present. This was analyzed in the experiments in this paper by means of a quantitative study of the effects of ATP, Mg2+, or Na+ on the equilibrium between free and occluded Rb+ formed by the direct route. Results show that occlusion of either one or two Rb+persists in enzymes saturated with ATP but not in enzymes fully bound to Mg2+ or Na+. Although in all cases Rb+ was able to displace the second ligand and to reach maximal occlusion, in media with either Na+ or Mg2+ the displacement required the binding of two Rb+ to the enzyme suggesting that Na+ or Mg2+ have to be present to allow Rb+ occlusion to take place with a fixed stoichiometry of two.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESThe enzyme preparation, incubation conditions, reagents, methods for the determination of occluded Rb+ as well as the statistical procedures applied to the data are described in the previous paper of this series (1González-Lebrero R.M.

ATP was purchased as the disodium salt and freed of Na+ by passing a 100 mmsolution of ATP followed by 1 ml of 200 mm imidazole-HCl (pH 7.4 at 25 °C) through a column containing 1 ml of a cation exchange resin (Bio-Rad AG MP-50). Contaminant [Na+] in the eluate, measured by flame photometry, was less than 0.05% of the [ATP] on a mole to mole basis. Free Mg2+ was taken as equal to [MgCl2] minus [EDTA]. In all experiments, occlusion equilibrium was attained by incubating enzyme during 15 min at 25 °C in media of the desired composition.Model SelectionRegression procedures permitted to define the goodness of fit of a given equation to the experimental results and to choose among different models, by using the AIC criterion (2Yamaoka K. Nakagawa T. Uno T. J. Pharmacokin. Biopharm. 1978; 6: 165-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (1938) Google Scholar) which, as mentioned in the previous paper (1González-Lebrero R.M. Kaufman S.B. Montes M.R. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5910-5921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar), is defined asAIC = N ln(SS) + 2 P, with N = number of data, P = number of parameters, and SS = sum of weighted square residual errors. Statistical weights were 1 in all cases. To test if a parameter included in a given equation was significantly different from 0,AIC was calculated either adjusting the parameter or fixing its value to 0 (thus decreasing P by 1), and the equation with the lower AIC value was chosen.The Quantitative Analysis of Rb+ Occlusion and Ligand BindingLet us consider the transition from an occluded state with i occluded Rb+ and j boundX, E(Rb i )X j , to a non-occluded state, ERb i X j , followed by the dissociation into its constituent components.E(Rbi)Xj⇄TijERbiXj⇄KijiRb++jX+E SCHEME1In our experiments, X is ATP, Mg2+, or Na+. This equilibrium is governed by a deocclusion constant, T ij, and a dissociation constant,K ij (see Ref. 1González-Lebrero R.M. Kaufman S.B. Montes M.R. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 5910-5921Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). Note that the dissociation ofERb i X j in Scheme 1 could be split into its elementary reactions and that K ij can accordingly be factored into the equilibrium constants of each step (see Scheme 2 below). According to Scheme 1, the equilibrium concentrations of every E(Rb i )X j and ERb i X j can be written as follows. E(Rbi)Xj=[Rb+]i[X]j[E]KijTij,ERbiXj=[Rb+]i[X]j[E]KijEquation 1 This allows us to express the amount of occluded Rb+(Rbocc) as follows. Rbocc=nmol of occluded Rb+mg protein=ETâˆ'pi=1âˆ'qj=0i[Rb+]i[X]jKijTijâˆ'ri=0âˆ'sj=0[Rb+]i[X]j(1+Tij)KijTijEquation 2 In Equation 2, [E] cancels out because it appears as a factor of all the terms both in the numerator and in the denominator, and when i = j = 0 thenK ij = 1. The equation includes four stoichiometric coefficients which measure the maximal numbers of occluded Rb+ (p), of X bound to the enzyme holding occluded Rb+ (q), of bound Rb+, either occluded or not (r), and of bound X (s). For obvious reasons, the index i in the numerator of Equation 2 starts at one and not at zero. Notice that the numerator contains only terms that correspond to enzyme states holding occluded Rb+, so that p ≤ r andq ≤ s. In this respect, it differs from a general binding equation, in which all bound states are measurable. For this reason the factor 1 + T ij is present in each term of the denominator of Equation 2, where both occluded and not occluded states must be taken into account, and is absent from the terms in the numerator, where only occluded states are considered.Equation 2 can be written as, Rbocc=âˆ'pi=1âˆ'qj=0Nij[Rb+]i[X]jâˆ'ri=0âˆ'sj=0Dij[Rb+]i[X]jEquation 3 where Nij=iETKijTij,Dij=1+TijKijTij.Equation 4 Notice that, from Equation 4 it follows thatN ij /D ij = i E T /(1 + T ij ). This allows us to identify the relative distribution between states with bound Rb+ and states with bound and occluded Rb+(which, to facilitate the reading, we hereafter shall callbound Rb+ and occludedRb+, respectively). If the equilibrium between states with occluded and states with bound Rb+ is displaced toward the occluded states then T ij ≪ 1 and the ratio will become not significantly different from i E T . We have already discussed in detail the consequences ofT ij ≪ 1 on the apparent dissociation constant for Rb+ (see comments to Scheme 2 in Reference 1, whereT ij was denoted asK deocc).Equations 2 and 3 take into account that everyE(Rb i )X j andERb i X j states permitted by the stoichiometry of binding of Rb+ and of X are present. This may not be always the case and, in a given experimental situation, one or more of these states may not exist and their corresponding terms have to be eliminated from Equations 2 and 3. Although it is not possible to know beforehand which states are absent, these can be identified adjusting an “empirical” equation of the form of Equation 3 to the data, without the restrictions imposed by Equation 4. When this is done, the coefficients of terms that express the concentration of absent states will become not significantly different from zero. On this basis, when fitting this empirical equation to our data we discarded those terms whose coefficients became negligible and considered as nonexistent the enzyme states described by them, provided that this did not affect the goodness of the fit and diminished the value of the AIC criterion. We thus obtained a “reduced” empirical equation. Additionally, by evaluating the ratios N ij /D ij as described above, we were able to define which of theE(Rb i )X j andERb i X j states were actually present and use this information to write down the minimal scheme that describes the equilibria among them. Once a minimal equilibrium diagram was established, an equation was derived in terms ofE T and the equilibrium constants of the scheme (for obvious reasons this equation will have the same form as the reduced empirical equation). In general, these equilibrium constants differed from the K ij in Scheme 1 because: (i) stepwise dissociation constants like those governing the following equilibria, ERbiXj⇄KiERb(i−1)Xj+Rb+ ERbiXj⇄KjERbiX(j−1)+X SCHEME2were considered, so that the coefficients K ij of Equation 2 were expressed as the product of these constants, (ii) when information was not enough as to identify them, some of the stepwise equilibrium constants were grouped together into constants that included deocclusion of Rb+ and dissociation of ligands. Thus, using the equation derived from the scheme, the values of the equilibrium constants were obtained by means of regression analysis.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONWhen Rb+ is the only ligand, Equation 2 can be written (for [X] = 0; p = r = 2) as, Rbocc=ET[Rb+]K1+2[Rb+]2K1K21+[Rb+]K1+[Rb+]2K1K2=ETK2[Rb+]+2[Rb+]2K1K2+K2[Rb+]+[Rb+]2Equation 5 in which K 1 and K 2are the equilibrium constants for the release of a single Rb+ from the enzyme states holding either one or two occluded Rb+ (see comment ii to Scheme 2 above). We have shown (1González-Lebrero R.M. Kaufman S.B. Montes M.R. Nørby J.G. Garrahan P.J. Rossi R.C. J. Biol.

In the case of Equation 5, hyperbolic behavior demands that K 2 =4 K 1.When X was present, we also looked at the effect of different fixed values of the stoichiometric coefficients,p, q, r, and s, for the binding of ligands on the goodness of the fit of Equation 3 to the experimental data. In agreement with the stoichiometric numbers observed by most workers, best results were obtained using 2 for the binding and occlusion of Rb+ (3Matsui H. Homareda H. J. Biochem.

Therefore, in terms of Equations 2 and 3, p = r = 2 for Rb+, s = 1 for Mg2+ and ATP, and s = 3 for Na+. Best values ofq, the maximal stoichiometric number for the binding of Mg2+, ATP, or Na+ to the occluded states, were found to be 0, 1, or 2, respectively.On the basis of these properties, when we adjusted an empirical equation of the form of Equation 3 to the data we reduced the number of independent parameters setting as constants the above-mentioned values for p, q, r, and s. Once an equilibrium scheme was obtained, we included the constraint thatK 2 = 4 K 1 for [X] = 0 into its derived equation.In what follows we will apply the reasoning developed in the preceding paragraphs to the studies of the effects of ATP, Mg2+, and Na+ on the equilibrium between free and occluded Rb+ formed through the direct route. As it will be seen, regression analysis reveals with sufficient clarity qualitative and quantitative differences as to allow to interpret with little ambiguity which of the bound species are present in each condition tested, thus making it unnecessary the replot of parameters.The Effects of ATP on the Equilibrium Distribution between Occluded and Free Rb+The equilibrium level of occluded Rb+ was measured after incubating Na+/K+-ATPase preparation in media containing from 0.8 to 500 μm Rb+ and from 0 to 2000 μm ATP. Results are plotted in Fig.1 as Rbocc as a function of either [ATP] (panels A and B) or [Rb+] (panels C and D). It can be seen that at constant [Rb+], the increase in [ATP] led to a progressive decrease in Rbocc, and that this effect was reduced markedly by high [Rb+] (panels Aand B). Conversely, at constant [ATP], Rboccraised along sigmoidal and saturable functions of [Rb+] that were progressively shifted to the right as [ATP] increased (panels C and D).The following empirical equation gave best fit to the experimental data of Rbocc as a function of both [Rb+] and [ATP]. Rbocc=N10[Rb+]+N20[Rb+]2+N11[Rb+][ATP]+N21[Rb+]2[ATP]D00+D10[Rb+]+D20[Rb+]2+D01[ATP]+D11[Rb+][ATP]+D21[Rb+]2[ATP]Equation 6 Equation 6 contains all the terms predicted by the stoichiometry of binding of Rb+ and ATP, which suggests that all the possible states of the enzyme with bound ATP and/or bound or occluded Rb+ are present in equilibrium with free Rb+and ATP. As none of theN ij /D ij ratios were significantly different from i E T (see Equation 4and Scheme 1 for T ij ≪ 1), it follows that all states with bound Rb+ were mostly in the occluded form. These states and the equilibria among them are given in the scheme in Fig. 2. From what we have already mentioned, it is obvious that the equation derived from this scheme will have the same form as Equation 6. The dependence of its coefficients with the equilibrium dissociation constants of the scheme in Fig. 2 is given in Table I and the best fitting values of the constants are shown in TableII. These values were used to draw the continuous lines that fit the data in Fig. 1.Figure 2A minimal model for the equilibria between the ATPase, Rb+, and ATP during direct occlusion of Rb+ in the Na+/K+-ATPase.

Since the K+-K+exchange catalyzed by the pump requires but does not consume ATP (14Karlish S.J.D. Stein W.D. J. Physiol. 1982; 328: 295-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) and probably involves direct occlusion, it is likely that during this condition ATP binds to the enzyme containing two occluded Rb+.2) As [ATP] goes from zero to infinity at constant [Rb+], Rbocc will fall along a rectangular hyperbola whose K 0.5 will depend on [Rb+] according to the following equation. K0.5=Kâ€³ATPK1K2+K2[Rb+]+[Rb+]2K1â€²K2â€²+K2â€²[Rb+]+[Rb+]2Equation 8 Equation 8 indicates that the value of K 0.5for ATP will go from K ATP when [Rb+] = 0 toK ATP“ when [Rb+] tends to infinity. At [Rb+] between these two limits K 0.5 for ATP will be a combination of K ATP,K ATP′ andK ATP“, that is, of the equilibrium constants for the dissociation of ATP from the enzyme having either none, one or two occluded Rb+, respectively. Table II shows thatK ATP“ >K ATP′ >K ATP indicating that increases in [Rb+] will increase K 0.5. It is noteworthy that the best fitting values for K ATPand K ATP“ are comparable with the equilibrium constants for the dissociation of ATP from the catalytic or regulatory sites for the nucleotide, which are usually supposed to be present in the E 1 orE 2 conformers of the ATPase, respectively (5Forbush III, B.

Results are shown in Fig.3 as plots of Rbocc as a function of [Mg2+] (panels A andB). It is apparent that as [Mg2+] increased Rbocc tended to zero along curves which were shifted to the right as [Rb+] raised. Since the set of [Mg2+] was different at each of the [Rb+] tested (i.e. there are only two points for [Mg2+] 4.5 or 1.6 mm, only one point for [Mg2+] 4 or 1.7 mm, etc.), it was not convenient to use experimental values for the curves of Rbocc versus [Rb+] in panels C and D. Instead, we plotted theoretical values (see legend to Fig. 3) whose meaning will be discussed below. Each curve inpanels C and D correspond to a given [Mg2+].Figure 3The effects of Mg2+ on the equilibrium distribution between free and occluded Rb+.

The continuous lines are the plot of Equation 10 where its coefficients were replaced by their meaning in terms of the equilibrium constants of the scheme in Fig. 4 (see TableIII), using the best fitting values given in Table IV. This procedure was also used to replot the calculated values of Rbocc as a function of [Rb+] (panels C and D) for [Mg2+] (read from left to right) 0, 0.01, 0.045, 0.1, 0.45, 1, and 4.5 mm, since there were not enough experimental values for each of these curves.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Best fit to the results was obtained with the following reduced empirical equation. Rbocc=N10[Rb+]+N20[Rb+]2D00+D10[Rb+]+D20[Rb+]2+D01[Mg2+]+D11[Rb+][Mg2+]Equation 10 It can be seen that Equation 10 has no terms containing [Mg2+] in the numerator and that only a first order term in [Rb+] [Mg2+] appears in the denominator.The states of the enzyme with Mg2+ and/or Rb+and the equilibria among them are given in the scheme in Fig.4. In this scheme, Rbocc will obey an equation like Equation 10 whose coefficients will depend on the equilibrium dissociation constants as shown in TableIII and whose best fitting values are given in Table IV. These values were used to draw the continuous lines in Fig. 3.Figure 4A minimal model for the equilibria between the ATPase, Rb+, and Mg2+ during direct occlusion of Rb+ in the Na+/K+-ATPase.

E T was 2.789 ± 0.019 nmol (mg protein)−1. Open table in a new tab The following considerations are relevant to the scheme in Fig.4. 1) Since Rb+ competes with Mg2+, as [Rb+] tends to infinity, Rbocc will tend to 2E T as in the absence of Mg2+. 2) At constant [Rb+], as [Mg2+] tends to infinity, Rbocc will tend to zero along rectangular hyperbolas which will become half-maximal when, KI=KMgâ€²K1K2+K2[Rb+]+[Rb+]2K1â€²K2+K2[Rb+]Equation 11 so that K I will increase without bounds as [Rb+] increases. This is consistent with the scheme in Fig. 4 which shows that Rb+ fully displaces Mg2+ from the enzyme and necessarily means that Mg2+ will also fully displace Rb+ from the ATPase. 3) As [Mg2+] increases, the plots of the theoretical values of Rbocc versus[Rb+] (panels C and D in Fig. 3) evinced an increasing sigmoidicity and a drop in the apparent affinity for Rb+. 4) The initial slope of Rbocc =ƒ([Rb+]), ETKMg′K1KMg′+K1′[Mg2+]Equation 12 will tend to zero as [Mg2+] tends to infinity. 5) Although the scheme in Fig. 4 includes an enzyme state holding only one occluded Rb+, the concentration of this state will be negligible when [Mg2+] tends to infinity so that, in this condition, displacement of Mg2+ will need the binding of two Rb+. Additionally, the scheme includes a Mg2+-bound state where Rb+ is bound, but not occluded (a unique case in this paper).The Effects of Na+ on the Equilibrium Distribution between Occluded and Free Rb+The equilibrium level of occluded Rb+ was measured after incubating Na+/K+-ATPase preparation in media containing from 0 to 10 mm Na+ and from 0.74 to 248 μm Rb+. Results in Fig.5 are plotted as a function of [Na+] (panels A and B) or of [Rb+] (panels C and D). It can be seen that at constant [Rb+], Na+ decreased the equilibrium level of occlusion along sigmoidal curves that tended to zero as [Na+] raised and which were displaced to the right as [Rb+] increased (panel A). The initial part (0 to 0.5 mm Na+) of the Rbocc versus [Na+] curves (panel B) shows that the slope of these curves approached zero as [Na+] tended to zero and [Rb+] tended to either zero or infinity.Figure 5The effects of Na+ on the equilibrium distribution between free and occluded Rb+.

As in the case of ATP, none of theN ij /D ij ratios were significantly different from i E T , indicating that all states with bound Rb+ were mostly in the occluded form.The possible states of the enzyme holding Rb+ and/or Na+ and the equilibria among them are given in the scheme in Fig. 6. In this scheme Rbocc = ƒ([Rb+], [Na+]) will obey an equation like Equation 13 with coefficients depending on the equilibrium dissociation constants as shown in Table V and whose best fitting values are given in Table VI.
