https://openalex.org/W2022874689,"The potential global atmospheric and climatic consequences of nuclear war are investigated using models previously developed to study the effects of volcanic eruptions. Although the results are necessarily imprecise due to wide range of possible scenaros and uncertainty in physical parameters, the most probable first-order effects are serious. Significant hemispherical attenuation of the solar radiation flux and subfreezing land temperatures may be caused by fine dust raised in high-yield nuclear surface bursts and by smoke from city and forest fires ignited by airbursts of all yields. For many simulated exchanges of several thousand megatons, in which dust and smoke are generated and encircle the earth within 1 to 2 weeks, average light levels can be reduced to a few percent of ambient and land temperatures can reach -15 degrees to -25 degrees C. The yield threshold for major optical and climatic consequences may be very low: only about 100 megatons detonated over major urban centers can create average hemispheric smoke optical depths greater than 2 for weeks and, even in summer, subfreezing land temperatures for months. In a 5000-megaton war, at northern mid-latitude sites remote from targets, radioactive fallout on time scales of days to weeks can lead to chronic mean doses of up to 50 rads from external whole-body gamma-ray exposure, with a likely equal or greater internal dose from biologically active radionuclides. Large horizontal and vertical temperature gradients caused by absorption of sunlight in smoke and dust clouds may greatly accelerate transport of particles and radioactivity from the Northern Hemisphere to the Southern Hemisphere. When combined with the prompt destruction from nuclear blast, fires, and fallout and the later enhancement of solar ultraviolet radiation due to ozone depletion, long-term exposure to cold, dark, and radioactivity could pose a serious threat to human survivors and to other species."

A single amino acid difference in this 32,000-dalton protein appears to be responsible for resistance to the herbicide in Amaranthus hybridus."

https://openalex.org/W1975320194,C(60) powders were shock-compressed quasi-isentropically and quenched from pressures in the range 10 to 110 GPa (0.1 to 1.1 Mbar). Recovered specimens were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and optical microscopy. C(60) fullerenes are stable into the 13- to 17-GPa pressure range. The onset of a fast ( approximately 0.5 micros) reconstructive transformation to graphite occurs near 17 GPa. The graphite recovered from 27 GPa and about 600 degrees C is relatively well ordered with crystal planar domain size of about 100 A. Above 50 GPa a continuous transformation to an amorphous state is observed in recovered specimens. The fast transformation to graphite is proposed to occur by pi-electron rehybridization which initiates breakup of the ball structure and formation of the graphite structure at high density.

These surfaces maintain their proper representation during bond rotation and global transformations, and an interior atom removal method yields a comprehensible picture of the molecular surface for large molecules. Both algorithms are faster than previous methods. This combination provides a powerful tool for real-time interactive molecular modeling."
https://openalex.org/W1990143116,"Multistage intercalation has been used to tune the interaction between adjacent blocks of CuO(2) sheets in the bigh-T(c) (high superconducting transition temperature) superconductor Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)Ox. As revealed by atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopy images, foreign iodine atoms are intercalated into every nth BiO bilayer of the host crystal, resulting in structures of stoichiometry IBi2nSr2nCanCu2nOx with stage index n up to 4. An expansion of 3.6 angstroms for each intercalated BiO bilayer decouples the CuO(2) sheets in adjacent blocks. A comparison of the superconducting transition temperatures of the pristine host material and intercalated compounds of different stages suggests that the coupling between each pair of adjacent blocks contributes approximately 5 K to T(c) in Bi(2)Sr(2)CaCu(2)Ox."
https://openalex.org/W1977920002,"The membrane lipid of a new deep-sea hydrothermal vent methanogen, Methanococcus jannaschii, has been structurally characterized. The hydrolyzed polar lipid of this archaebacterium is primarily (95 percent) a macrocyclic glycerol diether, which has not been described previously. The structure was elucidated by a combination of chemical and spectroscopic techniques. An initial survey of selected methanogens failed to indicate the presence of this membrane lipid in any microorganism other than Methanococcus jannaschii."
https://openalex.org/W1997726605,"Transmission electron microscope study of a chondritic interplanetary dust particle has revealed the presence of epsilon iron-nickel carbide, a low- temperature carbide previously encountered only in metallurgical studies. In these studies in-carbide was synthesized by carburization of iron or nickel grains in a stream of carbon monoxide or carbon monoxide plus hydrogen. Similar carburization of an iron-nickel metal in situ may have produced in-carbide during particle heating on atmospheric entry or in solar orbit. Alternatively, the epsilon-carbide may be a by-product of Fischer-Tropsch reactions in the solar nebula. Such reactions have been proposed as the mechanism of hydrocarbon formation in the early solar system."
https://openalex.org/W1999239777,"The solubility of plutonium in Mono Lake water is enhanced by the presence of large concentrations of indigenous carbonate ions and moderate concentrations of fluoride ions. In spite of the complex chemical composition of this water, only a few ions govern the behavior of plutonium, as demonstrated by the fact that it was possible to duplicate plutonium speciation in a synthetic water containing only the principal components of Mono Lake water."
https://openalex.org/W1565237630,Infrared spectra demonstrate that neither FeSO4 ⋅ 7H2O nor its bacterial or abiotic hydrated oxidation products incorporate deuterium in acid D2O solutions. Deuterium exchange occurred as bridging OD when bacterially oxidized iron was precipitated from D2O solutions as ferric hydroxysulfates. The exclusion of deuterium depended upon the stabilization of aquated Fe(II) and Fe(III) complexes by sulfate ions in outer-sphere coordination and is consistent with the requirement and postulated role of sulfate in iron oxidation by Thiobacillus ferrooxidans.
https://openalex.org/W2027409206,"The emergence of applied mathematics as a discipline in the United States is traditionally associated with World War II. Hungarian-born Theodore von Kármán was among those who had waged a long and vigorous campaign well before the war to make applied mathematics respectable to engineers and mathematicians. While advocating the use of mathematics and physics to solve applied problems, he challenged the prevailing philosophy of engineering programs, locked horns with recalcitrant journal editors, and generally encountered the obstacles to building a discipline that cuts across conventional boundaries."

The first outdoor test of a genetically modified virus actually took place in 1984, when Saul Kit of Baylor College tested an altered pseudorabies virus on pigs."
