https://openalex.org/W2049193087,"Differences in the degree of successful matings between pairs of reciprocal hybrid matings indicate the direction of evolution among related species of Drosophila. Females of a derived species do not mate with males of the ancestral species, whereas females of the ancestral species readily mate with males of the derived species."
https://openalex.org/W2015231653,"In seawater enriched with carbon-14-labeled sodium hydrogen carbonate the sacoglossan Placobranchus ocellatus when exposed to light incorporates carbon-14 at a rate 50-fold of that for animals kept in the dark. 9,10-Deoxytridachione, a secondary metabolite of the mollusk, undergoes a photorearrangement to photodeoxytridachione in vivo."
https://openalex.org/W2087362415,"The low-temperature heat capacity behavior of naturally occurring water in Wyodak coal indicates that there are two types of water present. More than two-thirds is ""nonfreezable,"" displaying no evidence of a phase transition in the neighborhood of 273 K where normal bulk water melts. The remainder is ""freezable,"" displaying a somewhat distorted heat capacity peak, which is indicative of a phase transition. This evidence suggests that the nonfreezable water is either adsorbed on the internal surfaces of the coal or is in smaller pores, whereas the freezable water is in larger pores. Parallels to the heat capacity behavior of the coal-water system include the water in a porous ceramic, water in the mineral endellite, and water in the protein collagen."
https://openalex.org/W2057077011,Magnesian calcite overgrowth containing 4 (+/- 2) mole percent magnesium carbonate forms on calcite exposed to natural seawater near the ocean surface. This magnesian calcite is approximately 30 percent less soluble in seawater than pure calcite. The formation of the magnesian calcite of reduced solubility may have a major influence on calcite accumulation in deep sea sediments.

https://openalex.org/W2100382343,"The size distributions of deep-sea manganese nodules are consistent with a simple model of uniform growth at a few millimeters per million years and with the same probability of burial for all nodules, regardless of size. The model suggests that most nodules spend 1 million years or less on the sea floor."
https://openalex.org/W2055283108,"The optical double quasar 0957+561 has been interpreted as the gravitational double image of a single object. A radio map made with the Very Large Array of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory shows unresolved sources coincident with the optical images as well as a complex of related extended emission. Although the results cannot rule out the gravitational lens hypothesis, the complex radio structure is more easily interpreted as two separate quasars. The optical and radio properties of the two quasars are so similar that the two must have been formed at the same time with similar initial conditions."
https://openalex.org/W1970741016,"Estimates are given for the maximum rate at which fossil fuel consumption can be reduced by the introduction of noncarbon-based energy sources, according to the market penetration time concept. These estimates indicate an immediate need to implement a revised energy policy if major climatic changes induced by increased amounts of carbon dioxide are to be avoided in the next century. However, application of market penetration ideas to energy consumption is new and may not be valid for the prediction of future trends."
