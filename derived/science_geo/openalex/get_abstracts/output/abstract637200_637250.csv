https://openalex.org/W3101509799,"Bilayer graphene can be modified by rotating (twisting) one layer with respect to the other. The interlayer twist gives rise to a moiré superlattice that affects the electronic motion and alters the band structure1-4. Near a 'magic angle' of twist2,4, where the emergence of a flat band causes the charge carriers to slow down3, correlated electronic phases including Mott-like insulators and superconductors were recently discovered5-8 by using electronic transport. These measurements revealed an intriguing similarity between magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene and high-temperature superconductors, which spurred intensive research into the underlying physical mechanism9-14. Essential clues to this puzzle, such as the symmetry and spatial distribution of the spectral function, can be accessed through scanning tunnelling spectroscopy. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy to visualize the local density of states and charge distribution in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Doping the sample to partially fill the flat band, we observe a pseudogap phase accompanied by a global stripe charge order that breaks the rotational symmetry of the moiré superlattice. Both the pseudogap and the stripe charge order disappear when the band is either empty or full. The close resemblance to similar observations in high-temperature superconductors15-21 provides new evidence of a deeper link underlying the phenomenology of these systems."

However, due to their cell-type specificity and difficulties in characterizing their regulatory targets, the ability to identify causal genetic variants has remained limited. To address these constraints, we perform an integrative analysis of chromatin interactions, open chromatin regions and transcriptomes using promoter capture Hi-C, assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high-throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) and RNA sequencing, respectively, in four functionally distinct neural cell types: induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-induced excitatory neurons and lower motor neurons, iPSC-derived hippocampal dentate gyrus-like neurons and primary astrocytes. We identify hundreds of thousands of long-range cis-interactions between promoters and distal promoter-interacting regions, enabling us to link regulatory elements to their target genes and reveal putative processes that are dysregulated in disease. Finally, we validate several promoter-interacting regions by using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) techniques in human excitatory neurons, demonstrating that CDK5RAP3, STRAP and DRD2 are transcriptionally regulated by physically linked enhancers. An integrative three-dimensional genomic and transcriptional profiling of four human neural cell types links regulatory elements to their target genes and elucidates the function of noncoding variants in neuropsychiatric disorders."
https://openalex.org/W2966056728,"Butyrate is a short-chain fatty acid derived from the metabolism of indigestible carbohydrates by the gut microbiota. Butyrate contributes to gut homeostasis, but it may also control inflammatory responses and host physiology in other tissues. Butyrate inhibits histone deacetylases, thereby affecting gene transcription, and also signals through the metabolite-sensing G protein receptor (GPR)109a. We produced an mAb to mouse GPR109a and found high expression on podocytes in the kidney. Wild-type and Gpr109a-/- mice were induced to develop nephropathy by a single injection of Adriamycin and treated with sodium butyrate or high butyrate-releasing high-amylose maize starch diet. Butyrate improved proteinuria by preserving podocyte at glomerular basement membrane and attenuated glomerulosclerosis and tissue inflammation. This protective phenotype was associated with increased podocyte-related proteins and a normalized pattern of acetylation and methylation at promoter sites of genes essential for podocyte function. We found that GPR109a is expressed by podocytes, and the use of Gpr109a-/- mice showed that the protective effects of butyrate depended on GPR109a expression. A prebiotic diet that releases high amounts of butyrate also proved highly effective for protection against kidney disease. Butyrate and GPR109a play a role in the pathogenesis of kidney disease and provide one of the important molecular connections between diet, the gut microbiota, and kidney disease.-Felizardo, R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2965604208,"Biochar is widely used as a soil amendment to increase crop yields. However, the impact of the interaction between the biochar and microbial inoculants (e.g., biofertilizer) on plant nutrient uptake and yield in forage rice is not fully understood. A greenhouse study was conducted to evaluate the synergistic effects of rice-husk biochar and Bacillus pumilus strain TUAT-1 biofertilizer application on growth, yield, and nutrient uptake in two forage rice genotypes; Fukuhibiki and the newly bred line, LTAT-29. Positive effects of biochar and biofertilizer, alone or in a combination, on growth traits, nutrient uptake, and yield components were dependent on the rice genotypes. Biochar and TUAT-1 biofertilizer influenced the overall growth of plants positively and increased straw and above-ground biomass in both genotypes. However, although biochar application significantly increased grain yield in LTAT-29, this was not the case in Fukuhibiki. Biochar and TUAT-1 biofertilizer, either alone or combined, significantly affected plant nutrient uptake but the effect largely depended on rice genotype. Results of this study indicate that biochar amendment and TUAT-1 biofertilizer can enhance forage rice productivity depending on genotypes, and therefore, there is a need to consider plant genetic composition when evaluating the potential for crop response to these soil amendments before application on a commercial scale."
https://openalex.org/W2964482333,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most prevalent diseases worldwide. Exercise is a first-line therapy and an important preventive measure for patients with NAFLD, but the underlying mechanisms are not clear. C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and subjected to 12 wk swimming exercise. Exercise protected against hepatic lipid accumulation and alleviated hepatocyte damage in HFD mice. Tandem mass tag-based quantitative proteomic analyses and ingenuity pathway analysis revealed that exercise down-regulated fatty acid-binding protein (FABP)1 signaling pathway, which was most closely associated with lipid metabolism. Moreover, exercise significantly decreased FABP1 expression, and liver-specific overexpression of FABP1 abolished the protective effect of exercise in NAFLD mice. Specifically, exercise significantly increased autophagic flux via restoring lysosomal function, including lysosomal proteolysis and lysosomal acidification maintenance, contributing to enhancement in autophagic clearance and subsequently alleviation of hepatic steatosis. Conversely, Fabp1 overexpression in the mouse liver blocked the protective effect of exercise via inhibiting autophagy flux. The present study identified FABP1 inhibition-mediated replenishment of the autophagy-lysosomal machinery as a novel endogenous mechanism whereby long-term exercise improves lipid homeostasis and ameliorates hepatic steatosis in NAFLD.-Pi, H., Liu, M., Xi, Y., Chen, M., Tian, L., Xie, J., Chen, M., Wang, Z., Yang, M., Yu, Z., Zhou, Z., Gao, F.

https://openalex.org/W2965220546,"Growth hormone (GH) is secreted during hypoglycemia, and GH-responsive neurons are found in brain areas containing glucose-sensing neurons that regulate the counter-regulatory response (CRR). However, whether GH modulates the CRR to hypoglycemia via specific neuronal populations is currently unknown. Mice carrying ablation of GH receptor (GHR) either in leptin receptor (LepR)- or steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1)-expressing cells were studied. We also investigated the importance of signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling in SF1 cells for the CRR. GHR ablation in LepR cells led to impaired capacity to recover from insulin-induced hypoglycemia and to a blunted CRR caused by 2-deoxy-d-glucose (2DG) administration. GHR inactivation in SF1 cells, which include ventromedial hypothalamic neurons, also attenuated the CRR. The reduced CRR was prevented by parasympathetic blockers. Additionally, infusion of 2DG produced an abnormal hyperactivity of parasympathetic preganglionic neurons, whereas the 2DG-induced activation of anterior bed nucleus of the stria terminalis neurons was reduced in mice without GHR in SF1 cells. Mice carrying ablation of Stat5a/b genes in SF1 cells showed no defects in the CRR. In summary, GHR expression in SF1 cells is required for a normal CRR, and these effects are largely independent of STAT5 pathway.-Furigo, I. C., de Souza, G. O., Teixeira, P. D. S., Guadagnini, D., Frazão, R., List, E. O., Kopchick, J. J., Prada, P. O., Donato, J., Jr. Growth hormone enhances the recovery of hypoglycemia via ventromedial hypothalamic neurons."
https://openalex.org/W2965516686,"The reliability of MyotonPRO that can monitor the mechanical properties of tissues is still unclear. This study aimed to analyze the within-day inter-operator and between-day intra-operator reliability of MyotonPRO for assessing tone and stiffness of quadriceps femoris and patellar tendon at different knee angles. The tone and stiffness of healthy participants (15 males and 15 females, aged 24.7±1.6 years) in the supine and resting position were measured using the MyotonPRO device. The measurements were quantified at 0°, 30°, 60°, and 90° of knee flexion. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), standard error of measurement (SEM), and minimal detectable change (MDC) were calculated and a Bland–Altman analysis was conducted to estimate reliability. The results indicated excellent inter-operator reliability (ICC > 0.78) and good to excellent intra-operator reliability (ICC > 0.41). The inter-operator SEM measurements ranged between 0.1–0.9 Hz and 3.8–37.9 N/m, and intra-operator SEM ranged between 0.5–1.3 Hz and 7.9–52.0 N/m. The inter-operator MDC ranged between 0.3–2.5 Hz and 10.5–105.1 N/m, and intra-operator SEM ranged between 1.1–3.3 Hz and 21.9–144.1 N/m. The agreement of inter-operator was better than that of intra-operator. The study concluded that MyotonPRO is a reliable device to detect the tone and stiffness of quadriceps femoris and patellar tendon."
https://openalex.org/W2965287688,"Introduction Intimate partner violence (IPV) is regarded an important public health and human rights issue, characterized by physical, sexual or emotional abuse. Globally more than one in three women report physical or sexual violence by their intimate partners. Though the association between IPV and depression is known, we found no study investigating depression as a risk factor for IPV and very few studies using standard tools in assessing both IPV and depression among pregnant women. Aim To measure the prevalence of IPV and depression during pregnancy and assess the association between IPV and depression and other determinants. Methods A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 589 pregnant women living in Wondo-Genet district, southern Ethiopia. IPV experience was assessed using a structured questionnaire of the World Health Organization (WHO), and maternal depression was measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Descriptive statistics were computed and multivariable logistic regression was carried out to estimate risk and adjust for confounders. Results The overall prevalence of IPV was 21% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 18.1–24.7). After adjusting for potential confounders, increased risk of IPV remained among rural women (adjusted odds ratio[AOR] = 2.09; 95%CI = 1.06–4.09), women who had parental exposure to IPV (AOR = 14.00; 95%CI = 6.43–30.48), women whose pregnancy was not desired (AOR = 9.64; 95%CI = 3.44–27.03), women whose husbands used alcohol (AOR = 17.08; 95%CI = 3.83–76.19), women with depression (AOR = 4.71; 95%CI = 1.37–16.18) and women with low social support (AOR = 13.93; 95%CI = 6.98–27.77). The prevalence of antenatal depressive symptom (with EPDS score above 13) was 6.8% (95% CI 6.2–11.3). Increased risk of depression was found among women who had been exposed to IPV (AOR = 17.60; 95%CI = 6.18–50.10) and whose husbands use alcohol (AOR = 3.31; 95%CI = 1.33–8.24). Conclusion One in five pregnant women experienced IPV and it was strongly associated with depression. Screening for IPV and depression at antenatal visits with referral to relevant care and service is recommended."
https://openalex.org/W2966095633,"2-Cys peroxiredoxins (Prxs) rapidly reduce H2O2, thereby acting as antioxidants and also as sensors and transmitters of H2O2 signals in cells. Interestingly, eukaryotic 2-Cys Prxs lose their peroxidase activity at high H2O2 levels. Under these conditions, H2O2 oxidizes the sulfenic acid derivative of the Prx peroxidatic Cys (CPSOH) to the sulfinate (CPSO2−) and sulfonated (CPSO3−) forms, redirecting the CPSOH intermediate from the catalytic cycle to the hyperoxidation/inactivation pathway. The susceptibility of 2-Cys Prxs to hyperoxidation varies greatly and depends on structural features that affect the lifetime of the CPSOH intermediate. Among the human Prxs, Prx1 has an intermediate susceptibility to H2O2 and was selected here to investigate the effect of a physiological concentration of HCO3−/CO2 (25 mm) on its hyperoxidation. Immunoblotting and kinetic and MS/MS experiments revealed that HCO3−/CO2 increases Prx1 hyperoxidation and inactivation both in the presence of excess H2O2 and during enzymatic (NADPH/thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin) and chemical (DTT) turnover. We hypothesized that the stimulating effect of HCO3−/CO2 was due to HCO4−, a peroxide present in equilibrated solutions of H2O2 and HCO3−/CO2. Indeed, additional experiments and calculations uncovered that HCO4− oxidizes CPSOH to CPSO2− with a second-order rate constant 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of H2O2 ((1.5 ± 0.1) × 105 and (2.9 ± 0.2) × 103 m−1·s−1, respectively) and that HCO4− is 250 times more efficient than H2O2 at inactivating 1% Prx1 per turnover. The fact that the biologically ubiquitous HCO3−/CO2 pair stimulates Prx1 hyperoxidation and inactivation bears relevance to Prx1 functions beyond its antioxidant activity."
https://openalex.org/W2964360826,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent progenitor cells capable of differentiating into adipocytic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, and myogenic lineages. There is growing evidence that MSCs home into the tumor microenvironment attracted by a variety of signals such as chemokines, growth factors, and cytokines. Tumor-homing stem cells may originate from bone marrow-derived MSCs (BMSCs) or adipose tissue-derived MSCs. Recent scientific data suggest that MSCs in combination with tumor cells can either promote or inhibit tumorigenic behavior. In head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), BMSCs are reported to be enriched with a potential negative role. Here, we evaluated the effect of BMSCs from 4 different donors in combination with 4 HNSCC cell lines in a 3-dimensional multicellular spheroid model. Heterogeneous combinations revealed an up-regulation of gene and protein expression of osteogenic markers runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) together with a substantial secretion of matrix metalloproteinase 9. Moreover, heterogenous BMSC/tumor spheroids showed increased invasion compared with homogenous spheroids in a Boyden chamber invasion assay. Furthermore, inhibition of ALP resulted in a substantially decreased spreading of heterogeneous spheroids on laminin-rich matrix. In summary, our data suggest a prometastatic effect of BMSCs combined with HNSCC.-Wessely, A., Waltera, A., Reichert, T. E., Stöckl, S., Grässel, S., Bauer, R. J.

https://openalex.org/W2964724239,"A Common Rejection Module (CRM) consisting of 11 genes expressed in allograft biopsies was previously reported to serve as a biomarker for acute rejection (AR), correlate with the extent of graft injury, and predict future allograft damage. We investigated the use of this gene panel on the urine cell pellet of kidney transplant patients. Urinary cell sediments collected from patients with biopsy-confirmed acute rejection, borderline AR (bAR), BK virus nephropathy (BKVN), and stable kidney grafts with normal protocol biopsies (STA) were analyzed for expression of these 11 genes using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). We assessed these 11 CRM genes for their abundance, autocorrelation, and individual expression levels. Expression of 10/11 genes were elevated in AR when compared to STA. Psmb9 and Cxcl10could classify AR versus STA as accurately as the 11-gene model (sensitivity = 93.6%, specificity = 97.6%). A uCRM score, based on the geometric mean of the expression levels, could distinguish AR from STA with high accuracy (AUC = 0.9886) and correlated specifically with histologic measures of tubulitis and interstitial inflammation rather than tubular atrophy, glomerulosclerosis, intimal proliferation, tubular vacuolization or acute glomerulitis. This urine gene expression-based score may enable the non-invasive and quantitative monitoring of AR."
https://openalex.org/W2964497361,"Memory is a dynamic brain function that is continually processed after encoding. Although psychologic concepts of mental schema are now well established, they have rarely been considered in animal studies. We used a behavior paradigm of multiple flavor-place paired associates (PAs) and showed that memory schema facilitates fast acquisition of new PAs in a single trial. The hippocampus is necessary for the encoding of new PAs and for memory retrieval within a certain time window-24 h following new PA consolidation. Whereas the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) plays a critical role for dynamic PA learning and consolidation during training sessions, ACC is essential in schema representation and activation. New myelin generation is essential for learning. Neural activity in the cortical regions impacts myelination by regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) proliferation, differentiation, and myelin formation. Here, we show that newly formed OL progenitor cells and mature OLs are increased following repeated PA learning and that establishment of the memory schema is associated with enhanced myelin strength in the ACC region. Furthermore, to ensure that myelination is necessary for the acquisition of paired-associate learning, ACC lysolecithin-induced demyelination revealed impaired PA learning associated with decrease in ACC θ band power and reduced spike-field coherence and phase-locking in ACC.-Hasan, M., Kanna, M.

https://openalex.org/W2966517170,"To elicit patterns in pathogenic biofilm composition we characterized the oral microbiome present in patients with dentin caries in comparison to healthy subjects.16S amplicon sequencing was used to analyse a total of 56 patients; 19 samples of carious dentin (pooled from at least three teeth) and 37 supragingival samples (pooled from three healthy tooth surfaces). Oral and periodontal status and socio-demographic parameters were recorded. Group assignment, smoking and further socio-demographic parameters were used as explanatory variables in the microbiome composition analysis.Overall, a total of 4,110,020 DNA high-quality sequences were yielded. Using a threshold of similarity >97% for assigning operational taxonomic units (OTU), a total of 1,537 OTUs were identified. PERMANOVA showed significant differences in microbiome composition between the groups caries/healthy (p = 0.001), smoking/non-smoking (p = 0.007) and fluoride intake during childhood yes/no (tablets p = 0.003, salt p = 0.023). The healthy microbiome had a significantly higher diversity (alpha diversity, p<0.001) and a lower dominance (Berger-Parker index, p<0.001). It was dominated by Fusobacteria. A linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) yielded a set of 39 OTUs being more abundant in carious dentin samples, including Atopobium spp. (14.9 log2FoldChange), Lactobacillus casei (11.6), Acinetobacter spp. (10.8), Lactobacillus gasseri (10.6), Parascardovia denticolens (10.5), Olsenella profusa (10.4), and others. Also Propionibacterium acidifaciens (7.2) and Streptococcus mutans (5.2) were overabundant in caries lesions.The healthy microbiome was highly diverse. The advanced caries microbiome was dominated by a set of carious associated bacteria where S. mutans played only a minor role. Smoking and fluoride intake during childhood influenced the microbiome composition significantly.The presented investigation adds knowledge to the still not fully comprehended patterns of oral microbiomes in caries compared with oral health. By analysing the genetics of biofilm samples from oral health and severe tooth decay we found distinct discriminating species which could be targets for future therapeutic approaches."

https://openalex.org/W2966255382,"Anthropogenic noise decreases signal active space, or the area over which male bird song can be detected in the environment. For territorial males, noise may make it more difficult to detect and assess territorial challenges, which in turn may increase defense costs and influence whether males maintain territory ownership. We tested the hypothesis that noise affects the ability of male house wrens (Troglodytes aedon) near active nests to detect intruders and alters responses to them. We broadcast pre-recorded male song and pink noise on territories to simulate intrusions with and without noise, as well as to noise alone. We measured detection by how long males took to sing or approach the speaker after the start of a playback. To measure whether playbacks changed male behavior, we compared their vocal responses before and during treatments, as well as compared mean vocal responses and the number of flyovers and attacks on the speaker during treatments. Noise did not affect a male’s ability to detect an intruder on his territory. Males altered their responses to simulated intruders with and without noise compared to the noise-only treatment by singing longer songs at faster rates. Males increased peak frequency of songs during intrusions without noise compared to noise-only treatments, but frequency during intruder plus noise treatments did not differ from either. When confronting simulated intruders in noise, males increased the number of attacks on the speaker compared to intruders without noise, possibly because they were less able to assess intruders via songs and relied on close encounters for information. Although noise did not affect intruder detection, noise affected some aspects of singing and aggressive responses, which may be related to the challenge of discriminating and assessing territorial threats under elevated noise."

However, the details of BMP9-transduced intracellular signaling remain ambiguous. Here, we have investigated signal transduction mechanisms of BMP9 in comparison to BMP2, another potent inducer of bone formation, in osteoblasts. In a mouse osteoblast cell line, BMP9 induced higher mRNA levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) than BMP2 within 2 h. Unlike BMP2, BMP9 induced rapid phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-β (GSK3-β) and protein kinase B (Akt) and increased the cellular protein content of β-catenin. BMP9 moderately increased mRNA levels of several canonical Wingless-related integration site to lower degrees than BMP2. Furthermore, BMP9-induced GSK3-β phosphorylation was not inhibited by pretreatment with actinomycin D, cycloheximide, or Brefeldin A, indicating it is independent of Wnt protein secretion. BMP9-induced GSK3-β phosphorylation was abrogated by Akt or class I PI3K-specific inhibitors. Moreover, inactivation of GSK3-β by LiCl did not further promote ALP and Runx2 mRNA induction by BMP9 as significantly as that by BMP2. Notably, BMP9-induced GSK3-β phosphorylation was inhibited by small interfering RNA against endoglin and GIPC PDZ domain-containing family, member 1. Taken together, our present findings have indicated that BMP9 directly activates GSK3β-β-catenin signaling pathway through class I PI3K-Akt Axis in osteoblasts, which may be essential for the potent osteoinductive activity of BMP9.-Eiraku, N., Chiba, N., Nakamura, T., Amir, M.

However, whether MIB2 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that acts on CYLD is unknown. Here, using the cell-free–based AlphaScreen and pulldown assays to detect protein-protein interactions, along with immunofluorescence assays and murine Mib2 knockout cells and animals, we demonstrate that MIB2 promotes proteasomal degradation of CYLD and enhances NF-κB signaling. Of note, arthritic inflammation was suppressed in Mib2-deficient mice. We further observed that the ankyrin repeat in MIB2 interacts with the third CAP domain in CYLD and that MIB2 catalyzes Lys-48–linked polyubiquitination of CYLD at Lys-338 and Lys-530.

https://openalex.org/W2966265295,"Uremic pruritus with elevated levels of calcium phosphate (CaP) in skin is a common symptom in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In this study, we demonstrate that intradermal injection of CaP into mice triggered scratching by up-regulating the IL-6 in skin and phosphorylation of ERKs in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in a dose-dependent manner. IL-6 is essential because the CaP-induced up-regulation of phosphorylated (p)-ERK in DRG was considerably reduced in the IL-6 knockout mice. Microarray analysis in conjunction with real-time PCR revealed a higher mRNA expression of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene in DRG after CaP injection. The inhibition of BTK by ibrutinib noticeably diminish the CaP-induced up-regulation of IL-6 and p-ERK in mice. A high amount of IL-6 was detected in itchy skin and blood of patients with CKD. The expressions of p-BTK and p-ERK in DRG primary cells reached maximum levels at 1 and 10 min, respectively, after treatment of recombinant IL-6 and were significantly reduced by treatment of IL-6 along with ibrutinib.

CENP-C (centromere protein C), a conserved inner kinetochore component, has been broadly characterized as a scaffolding protein and is required for the recruitment of multiple kinetochore proteins to the centromere. At its C terminus, CENP-C harbors a conserved cupin domain that has an established role in protein dimerization. Although the crystal structure of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Mif2CENP-C cupin domain has been determined, centromeric organization and kinetochore composition vary greatly between S. cerevisiae (point centromere) and other eukaryotes (regional centromere). Therefore, whether the structural and functional role of the cupin domain is conserved throughout evolution requires investigation. Here, we report the crystal structures of the Schizosaccharomyces pombe and Drosophila melanogaster CENP-C cupin domains at 2.52 and 1.81 Å resolutions, respectively. Although the central jelly roll architecture is conserved among the three determined CENP-C cupin domain structures, the cupin domains from organisms with regional centromeres contain additional structural features that aid in dimerization. Moreover, we found that the S. pombe Cnp3CENP-C jelly roll fold harbors an inner binding pocket that is used to recruit the meiosis-specific protein Moa1.

ADAR1 is known to be involved in the replication of various viruses, including hepatitis C and D. However, the role of ADAR1 in hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection has not yet been elucidated. Here, for the first time, we demonstrated ADAR1 antiviral activity against HBV. ADAR1 has two splicing isoforms in human hepatocytes: constitutive p110 protein and interferon-α (IFN-α)-responsive p150 protein. We found that overexpression of ADAR1 decreased HBV RNA in an HBV culture model. A catalytic-site mutant ADAR1 also decreased HBV RNA levels, whereas another adenosine deaminases that act on the RNA (ADAR) family protein, ADAR2, did not. Moreover, the induction of ADAR1 by stimulation with IFN-α also reduced HBV RNA levels. Decreases in endogenous ADAR1 expression by knock-down or knock-out increased HBV RNA levels. A major hepatocyte-specific microRNA, miRNA-122, was found to be positively correlated with ADAR1 expression, and exogenous miRNA-122 decreased both HBV RNA and DNA, whereas, conversely, transfection with a miRNA-122 inhibitor increased them. The reduction of HBV RNA by ADAR1 expression was abrogated by p53 knock-down, suggesting the involvement of p53 in the ADAR1-mediated reduction of HBV RNA.

The HBV genome is 3.2 kb long and comprises four genes: core protein (HBc), X protein (HBx), surface protein (HBs), and P protein (P). After HBV enters a hepatocyte, viral DNA is transferred to the cell nucleus, where covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is formed. cccDNA generates viral RNAs, including a replicative intermediate known as pregenomic (pg) RNA and viral mRNAs for the HBs and HBx proteins. HBc, P protein, and pgRNA are assembled into a nucleocapsid, and the P protein converts pgRNA into relaxed circular (RC)-DNA using its reverse transcriptase activity. The mature nucleocapsid finally associates with HBs prior to secretion as an infectious virion (3Nguyen D.H. Ludgate L. Hu J. Hepatitis B virus-cell interactions and pathogenesis.J.

Several members of the ADAR (adenosine deaminases that act on RNA) family have been newly identified as types of antiviral factors. In humans, the ADAR family has three members: ADAR1, ADAR2, and ADAR3. Most of these enzymes can convert adenosine to inosine (Ala to Ile) via their adenosine deaminase activity (7Nishikura K.

The Drosha and Dicer enzymes belong to the RNase III gene family and are key components of the miRNA processing machinery. In the nucleus, Drosha cleaves pri-miRNAs to produce intermediate precursors, pre-miRNAs, with the help of the dsRNA-binding protein DGCR8. Pre-miRNAs are cleaved by Dicer in the cytoplasm to release 21–24–nt mature miRNAs (17Krol J. Loedige I. Filipowicz W. The widespread regulation of microRNA biogenesis, function and decay.Nat. Rev.

The transfected cells were further treated with IFN-α at doses of 100, 500, and 1000 units/ml, selected to match the range reported as antiviral doses in human hepatocytes. Immunoblotting of ADAR1 revealed that the ADAR1 p150 isoform was increased by 3.45-, 5.32-, and 5.98-fold by 100, 500, and 1000 units/ml of IFN-α, respectively (Fig. 1A, top). In contrast, p110 was up-regulated by no more than 1.93-fold by 500 units/ml of IFN-α. RT-quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis was performed in parallel, and copy numbers of p110 and p150 isoforms were individually quantified. We found that both were increased by IFN-α (Fig. 1A, bottom), consistent with the Western blot analysis. Although p110 was reported to constitutively express (11Biswas N. Wang T. Ding M. Tumne A. Chen Y. Wang Q. Gupta P. ADAR1 is a novel multi targeted anti-HIV-1 cellular protein.Virology. 2012; 422 (22104209): 265-27710.1016/j.virol.2011.10.024Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) 1000 units/ml of IFN-α significantly up-regulated p110 in Huh7 cells, albeit not robustly compared with p150. Viral replication was also examined by measurement of total HBV RNA and viral DNA levels secreted into culture supernatants. As shown in Fig. 1B, the levels of both HBV RNA and secreted HBV DNA were decreased in the IFN-α–treated cells, in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, to verify whether ADAR1 expression affects HBV replication, ADAR1-p150 was expressed in HBV-replicating hepatocytes. RT-qPCR revealed decreased levels of HBV RNA in the ADAR1 transfectant, whereas IFN-α mRNA was unaffected (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1). A native agarose gel electrophoresis (NAGE) assay can differentially estimate the amounts of cytoplasmic nucleocapsid protein and its associated DNA, allowing for accurate assessment of viral replication. Using this method, we found that p150 expression also led to a decrease in both nucleocapsid production and secreted viral DNA (Fig. 1C). Collectively, these results suggest that ADAR1 is induced by IFN-α and can decrease HBV RNA levels. Activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) and zinc finger antiviral protein (ZAP) have been reported to decrease HBV RNA and viral replication (20Liang G. Liu G.Y. Kitamura K. Wang Z. Chowdhury S.

Indeed, we observed a reduction in both HBV RNA and secreted HBV DNA levels following the overexpression of AID, ZAP, and ADAR1 (Fig. S2, top). In contrast, another DNA deaminase, APOBEC3G, reduced the level of secreted HBV DNA, but not of viral RNA (Fig. S2, middle and bottom). This is consistent with previous studies, where APOBEC3G targeted HBV DNA, but did not directly affect the HBV RNA levels (20Liang G. Liu G.Y. Kitamura K. Wang Z. Chowdhury S. Monjurul A.M. Wakae K.

To investigate the possibility of whether the induction of ADAR1 suppresses HBV replication in IFN-α-treated hepatocytes, loss-of-function of ADAR1 approaches were adopted. First, siRNA against ADAR1 (or control siRNA; siNC) was transfected together with pPB. Then, one group was further treated with IFN-α and another group was left untreated. As shown in Fig. 2A, among the three kinds of siRNA targeting ADAR1, we found that two (1-1 and 1-2) ablated its expression to almost undetectable levels. Significant suppression of ADAR1 by siADAR1 was also confirmed by RT-qPCR analysis (Fig. 2B, top). As shown in Fig. 2B (lower panel), HBV transcript levels were reduced by IFN-α treatment (compare the first lane with fourth), whose effect was attenuated by transfection with siADAR1. Notably, ADAR1 knock-down cells saw increased HBV RNA levels even in the absence of IFN-α treatment, suggesting the involvement of constitutively expressed ADAR1 proteins (mainly p110) in the regulation of HBV transcript levels in an IFN-α–independent manner. Second, we reduced the ADAR1 expression level by transfection with a CRISPR/Cas9-guide RNA vector targeting ADAR1. Of three sgADAR1 vectors we tested, we confirmed a reduction in ADAR1 in two transfectants (exons 3 and 4) to undetectable levels, as assessed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 2C, top). The HBV RNA levels of two transfectants (exons 3 and 4) were compared with that of the control transfectant, and HBV RNA levels were found to be significantly higher in exons 3 and 4 transfectants compared with the control cells (Fig. 2C, bottom). These results suggest that endogenous ADAR1 (both p110 and p150) negatively regulates HBV transcript levels. ADAR1 catalyzes the conversion of adenosine to inosine in dsRNA by hydrolytic deamination (7Nishikura K. Functions and regulation of RNA editing by ADAR deaminases.Annu. Rev.

To explore the mechanism by which ADAR1 suppresses HBV transcript levels, we first investigated the possibility of Ala to Ile RNA editing of HBV transcripts. Because NC-DNA is generated from pgRNA through reverse transcription, any Ala to Ile conversion in pgRNA should be transduced to be a Thr to Cys mutation in NC-DNA. Therefore, we sequenced NC-DNA purified from cells overexpressing ADAR1. The results showed no Thr to Cys mutations in five, independent clones (Fig. S3, 835 bases sequenced in total). Meanwhile, AID and APOBEC3G, known to be mutators of HBV DNA (22Kitamura K. Wang Z. Chowdhury S. Simadu M. Koura M. Muramatsu M.

Therefore, we next examined whether changes in ADAR1 expression had any effect on miRNA expression. To this end, the level of the miRNAs miR-122, -205, -196b, and -433 (27Wu F.L. Jin W.B. Li J.H. Guo A.G. Targets for human encoded microRNAs in HBV genes.Virus Genes. 2011; 42 (21113793): 157-16110.1007/s11262-010-0555-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), which are abundantly expressed in hepatocytes, were compared between ADAR1 and mock-expressing Huh7 cells. As shown in Fig. 3A and Fig. S4, miR-122, a predominant miRNA in hepatocytes (28Girard M. Jacquemin E. Munnich A. Lyonnet S. Henrion-Caude A. miR-122, a paradigm for the role of microRNAs in the liver.J.

In contrast, the expression of another ADAR family member, ADAR2, did not affect either miR-122 or HBV RNA (Fig. 3B). Moreover, AID and ZAP did not alter the level of miR-122 either, suggesting that their anti-HBV activity is not dependent on miR-122 (Fig. 3C). Meanwhile, two ADAR1 isoforms, p110 and p150, both increased miR-122 levels and suppressed HBV transcript levels when individually overexpressed (Fig. 3D). Collectively, these results suggest that ADAR1 plays a role in the positive regulation of miR-122 in hepatocytes. It has previously been reported that ADAR1 facilitates the conversion of pri-miRNA to miRNA, and that this process does not require deaminase activity (16Ota H. Sakurai M. Gupta R. Valente L.

ADAR1 has one deaminase catalytic domain that is composed of a single zinc finger. Mutation of histidine 910 and glutamine 912, which are located within the catalytic core CHAE motif, abolish ADAR1 deaminase activity (29Lai F. Drakas R. Nishikura K.

The levels of HBV RNA, miR-122, and pri-miR-122 were determined. The results showed that WT ADAR1 decreased HBV RNA levels but increased miR-122 levels, without affecting its precursor pri-miR-122 (Fig. 4). Interestingly, the inactive mutant affected HBV RNA and miR-122 levels in a manner comparable with that of WT ADAR1. These results suggest that ADAR1 increases miR-122 levels by facilitating miRNA processing, and that deaminase activity is not necessarily required for ADAR1-mediated miR-122 up-regulation. To demonstrate the role of ADAR1 in the positive regulation of miR-122, a loss-of-function approach was employed, utilizing siRNA or CRISPR/Cas9-based genetic ablation of ADAR1 (Fig. 5A). In both experiments, decreased ADAR1 levels were associated with decreased miR-122 levels, consistent with the results presented in Figure 3, Figure 4. Next, we examined whether miR-122 is responsible for the ADAR1-mediated down-regulation of HBV transcripts. In accordance with previous reports (31Wang S. Qiu L. Yan X. Jin W.S. Wang Y. Chen L. Wu E. Ye X. Gao G.F. Wang F. Chen Y. Duan Z. Meng S. Loss of microRNA 122 expression in patients with hepatitis B enhances hepatitis B virus replication through cyclin G1-modulated P53 activity.Hepatology. 2012; 55 (22105316): 730-74110.1002/hep.24809Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar), transfection of a miR-122 mimic resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in HBV RNA levels (Fig. 5B, upper panel). Conversely, transfection of a miR-122 inhibitor increased HBV transcript levels in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5B, lower panel). These results suggest that the constitutively expressed miR-122 contributes to HBV RNA reduction. To assess the contribution of miR-122 downstream of ADAR1 expression, Huh7 cells were co-transfected with pPB and the ADAR1/mock expression vector, in combination with the miR-122 inhibitor (Fig. 5C). RT-qPCR analysis was performed to quantify viral RNA levels and revealed that miR-122 inhibitor treatment of the ADAR1 transfectant increased viral RNA (lanes 3 and 4). In the presence of the miR-122 inhibitor, viral RNA levels were comparable between the mock and ADAR1 transfectants (lanes 1 and 3). Collectively, these results suggest that miR-122 negatively regulates HBV RNA, and that ADAR1 reduces HBV transcripts through the up-regulation of miR-122. It has been previously reported that miR-122 and its target, cyclin G1, are involved in immunity to HBV (31Wang S. Qiu L. Yan X. Jin W.S. Wang Y. Chen L. Wu E. Ye X. Gao G.F. Wang F. Chen Y. Duan Z.

Few baseline data on pathogen prevalence and diversity of caribou are available, which hampers our ability to track changes over time and evaluate impacts on caribou health. Archived blood samples collected from ten migratory caribou herds in Canada and two in Greenland were used to test for exposure to pathogens that have the potential to effect population productivity, are zoonotic or are emerging. Relationships between seroprevalence and individual, population, and other health parameters were also examined. For adult caribou, the highest overall seroprevalence was for alphaherpesvirus (49%, n = 722), pestivirus (49%, n = 572) and Neospora caninum (27%, n = 452). Lower seroprevalence was found for parainfluenza virus type 3 (9%, n = 708), Brucella suis (2%, n = 758), and Toxoplasma gondii (2%, n = 706). No animal tested positive for antibodies against West Nile virus (n = 418) or bovine respiratory syncytial virus (n = 417). This extensive multi-pathogen survey of migratory caribou herds provides evidence that caribou are exposed to pathogens that may have impacts on herd health and revealed potential interactions between pathogens as well as geographical differences in pathogen exposure that could be linked to the bio-geographical history of caribou. Caribou are a keystone species and the socio-economic cornerstone of many indigenous cultures across the North. The results from this study highlight the urgent need for a better understanding of pathogen diversity and the impact of pathogens on caribou health."

A multi-species microbiota biofilm model of C. difficile was designed to evaluate the differences in the production of biofilms, sporulation, susceptibility to drugs, expression of sporulating (sigH, spo0A), quorum sensing (agrD1, and luxS), and adhesion-associated (slpA and cwp84) pathway genes between selected C. difficile isolates from R-CDI and non-recurrent patients (NR-CDI). We obtained 102 C. difficile isolates from 254 patients with confirmed CDI (66 from NR-CDI and 36 from R-CDI). Most of the isolates were biofilm producers, and most of the strains were ribotype 027 (81.374%, 83/102). Most C. difficile isolates were producers of biofilm (100/102), and most were strongly adherent. Sporulation was higher in the R-CDI than in the NR-CDI isolates (p = 0.015). The isolates from R-CDI patients more frequently demonstrated reduced susceptibility to vancomycin than isolates of NR-CDI patients (27.78% [10/36] and 9.09% [6/66], respectively, p = 0.013). The minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin and linezolid against biofilms (BMIC) were up to 100 times and 20 times higher, respectively, than the corresponding planktonic MICs. Expression of sigH, spo0A, cwp84, and agrD1 was higher in R-CDI than in NR-CDI isolates. Most of the C. difficile isolates were producers of biofilms with no correlation with the ribotype. Sporulation was greater in R-CDI than in NR-CDI isolates in the biofilm model of C. difficile. The R-CDI isolates more frequently demonstrated reduced susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolid than the NR-CDI isolates in both planktonic cells and biofilm isolates. A higher expression of sporulating pathway (sigH, spo0A), quorum sensing (agrD1), and adhesion-associated (cwp84) genes was found in R-CDI than in NR-CDI isolates. All of these factors can have effect on the recurrence of the infection."

https://openalex.org/W2966797854,"Background Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is characterized by elevated pulmonary artery pressure but classified into subgroups based on disease etiology. It is established that systemic bioenergetic dysfunction contributes to the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial hypertension classified as World Health Organization (WHO) Group 1. Consistent with this, we previously showed that platelets from Group 1 PH patients demonstrate increased glycolysis and enhanced maximal capacity for oxidative phosphorylation, which is due to increased fatty acid oxidation (FAO). However, it remains unclear whether identical mitochondrial alterations contribute to the pathology of other PH subgroups. The most prevalent subgroup of PH is WHO Group 2, which encompasses pulmonary venous hypertension secondary to left heart disease. Here, we hypothesized that platelets from Group 2 subjects show bioenergetic alteration compared to controls, and that these changes were similar to Group 1 PH patients. Method and results We isolated platelets from subjects with Group 2 PH and controls (n = 20) and measured platelet bioenergetics as well as hemodynamic parameters. We demonstrate that Group 2 PH platelets do not show a change in glycolytic rate but do demonstrate enhanced maximal capacity of respiration due at least partially to increased FAO. Moreover, this enhanced maximal capacity correlates negatively with right ventricular stroke work index and is not changed by administration of inhaled nitrite, a modulator of pulmonary hemodynamics. Conclusions These data demonstrate that Group 2 PH subjects have altered bioenergetic function though this alteration is not identical to that of Group 1 PH. The implications of this alteration for disease pathogenesis will be discussed."
https://openalex.org/W2964725633,"Synchronization between biologic clocks and metabolism is crucial for most species. Here, we examined the ability of leptin, important in the control of energy metabolism, to induce leptin signaling at the molecular as well as the behavioral level throughout the 24-h day in mice fed either a control or a high-fat diet (HFD). Furthermore, we investigated the effects of time-restricted feeding (TRF; a limitation of HFD access to 6 h each day) on energy metabolism during different periods throughout the 24-h day. In control mice, molecular leptin sensitivity was highest at zeitgeber time (ZT)0 (lights on), declining during the light phase, and increasing during the dark phase. Surprisingly, leptin resistance in HFD-fed mice was only present from the middle of the dark to the middle of the light period. Specifically, when TRF occurred from ZT21 to ZT3 (when leptin resistance in HFD-fed mice was most profound), it resulted in a disruption of the daily rhythms of locomotor activity and energy expenditure and in increased plasma insulin levels compared with other TRF periods. These data provide evidence that leptin sensitivity is controlled by the circadian rhythm and that TRF periods may be most efficient when aligned with the leptin-sensitive period.-Boucsein, A., Rizwan, M. Z., Tups, A. Hypothalamic leptin sensitivity and health benefits of time-restricted feeding are dependent on the time of day in male mice."
https://openalex.org/W2965260176,"The deleterious effects of statins on skeletal muscle are well known, but the mechanism associated with these effects remains unresolved. Statins are associated with mitochondrial damage, which may contribute to muscle myopathy. Here we demonstrate that simvastatin induces mitophagy in skeletal muscle cells and hypothesized that attenuating this process by silencing the mitophagy adapter p62/sequestosome-1 (SQSTM1) might mitigate myotoxicity. Surprisingly, silencing p62/SQSTM1 in differentiated C2C12 muscle cells exacerbated rather than attenuated myotoxicity. This inhibition of mitophagy in the face of statin challenge correlated with increased release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, activation of caspase-3, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. Correspondingly, targeted knockdown of Parkin, a canonical E3 ubiquitin ligase important for mitophagy, mirrored the effects of p62/SQSTM1 silencing. To corroborate these findings in vivo, we treated Parkin knockout mice with simvastatin for 2 wk. In line with our findings in vitro, these mitophagy-compromised mice displayed reduced spontaneous activity, loss of grip strength, and increased circulating levels of muscle damage marker LDH. Our findings demonstrate that mitophagy is an important mechanism to resist statin-induced skeletal muscle damage.-Ramesh, M., Campos, J. C., Lee, P., Song, Y., Hernandez, G., Sin, J., Tucker, K.

The right diagnosis is crucial for both therapeutic choice and prognosis and influences genetic counseling. The main objective of this study was to search for monogenic diabetes in Spanish pediatric patients suspected of type 1 diabetes with lack of autoimmunity at the onset of the disease. We also evaluated the extra value of ZnT8A in addition to the classical IAA, GADA and IA2A autoantibodies to improve the accuracy of type 1 diabetes diagnosis.Four hundred Spanish pediatric patients with recent-onset diabetes (mean age 8.9 ± 3.9 years) were analyzed for IAA, GADA, IA2A and ZnT8A pancreatic-autoantibodies and HLA-DRB1 alleles. Patients without autoimmunity and those with only ZnT8A positive were screened for 12 monogenic diabetes genes by next generation sequencing.ZnT8A testing increased the number of autoantibody-positive patients from 373 (93.3%) to 377 (94.3%). An isolated positivity for ZnT8A allowed diagnosing autoimmune diabetes in 14.8% (4/27) of pediatric patients negative for the rest of the antibodies tested. At least 2 of the 23 patients with no detectable autoimmunity (8%) carried heterozygous pathogenic variants: one previously reported missense variant in the INS gene (p.Gly32Ser) and one novel frameshift variant (p.Val264fs) in the HNF1A gene. One variant of uncertain significance was also found. Carriers of pathogenic variants had HLA-DRB1 risk alleles for autoimmune diabetes and clinical characteristics compatible with type 1 diabetes except for the absence of autoimmunity.ZnT8A determination improves the diagnosis of autoimmune diabetes in pediatrics. At least 8% of pediatric patients suspected of type 1 diabetes and with undetectable autoimmunity have monogenic diabetes and can benefit from the correct diagnosis of the disease by genetic study."
https://openalex.org/W2966367323,"Background Early identification of HIV-infected infants for treatment is critical for survival. Efficient uptake of early infant diagnosis (EID) requires timely presentation of HIV-exposed infants, same-day sample collection, and prompt release of results. The MoMent (Mother Mentor) Nigeria study investigated the impact of structured peer support on EID presentation and maternal retention. This cascade analysis highlights missed opportunities for EID and infant treatment initiation during the study. Methods HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants were recruited at 20 rural Primary Healthcare Centers. Routine infant HIV DNA PCR testing was performed at centralized laboratories using dried blood spot (DBS) samples ideally collected by age two months. EID outcomes data were abstracted from study case report forms and facility registers. Descriptive statistics summarized gaps and missed opportunities in the EID cascade. Results Out of 497 women enrolled, delivery data was available for 445 (90.8%), to whom 415 of 455 (91.2%) infants were live-born. Out of 408 live-born infants with available data, 341 (83.6%) presented for DBS sampling at least once. Only 75.4% (257/341) were sampled, with 81.7% (210/257) sampled at first presentation. Only 199/257 (77.4%) sampled infants had results available up to 28 months post-collection. Two (1.0%) of the 199 infants tested HIV-positive; one infant died before treatment initiation and the other was lost to follow-up. Conclusions While nearly 85% of infants presented for sampling, there were multiple missed opportunities, largely due to health system and not necessarily patient-level failures. These included infants presenting without being sampled, presenting multiple times before samples were collected, and getting sampled but results not forthcoming. Finally, neither of the two HIV-positive infants were linked to treatment within the follow-up period, which may have led to the death of one. To facilitate patient compliance and HIV-free infant survival, quality improvement approaches should be optimized for EID commodity availability, consistent DBS sample collection, efficient processing/result release, and prompt infant treatment initiation."
https://openalex.org/W2966722832,"Background Despite persistent calls to measure the effectiveness of educational interventions on patient outcomes, few studies have been conducted. Within musculoskeletal physiotherapy, the effects of clinical mentoring on postgraduate physiotherapists have been explored, but its impact on patient outcomes is unknown. The objective of this trial was to assess the effectiveness of a work-based mentoring programme to facilitate physiotherapist clinical reasoning on patient outcomes. Methods In a stepped-wedge cluster RCT in the musculoskeletal physiotherapy outpatient departments of a large NHS organisation, 16 physiotherapists were randomised by cluster to receive the intervention—150 hours of mentored clinical practice—at one of 3 time periods; control was usual training. 441 patients submitted outcome measures: Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) (primary outcome measure), EQ-5D-5L, patient activation and patient satisfaction (secondary outcome measures). A further secondary outcome measure of physiotherapist performance was collected by an independent assessor observing the physiotherapists practice. Results 80.0% of intervention patients achieved clinically significant PSFS scores compared with 63.8% of control patients. Binary logistic regression analysis modelling for time, cluster and patient characteristics showed strong statistical evidence for this difference (p = 0.023; odds ratio 4.24, 95%CI 1.22, 14.79). Physiotherapist performance scores improved from a mean of 47.8% (SD 3.60) pre-intervention to a mean of 56.0% (SD 4.24) (p<0.001). There was no statistical evidence for differences between groups on other secondary outcomes. Conclusion This is the first study that we aware of that provides patient outcomes measurement of an established educational intervention in physiotherapy, providing evidence that this type of intervention positively impacts patient outcomes and physiotherapist performance. This provides a basis for further research in education across other healthcare disciplines and outcome measures."
https://openalex.org/W2964673600,"Background The tobacco industry has aggressively introduced new and diverse products in the market, including electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and heat-not-burn (HNB) tobacco products, to which adolescents are readily susceptible. Conventional cigarettes have a well-established relationship with adolescent risky behaviors such as alcohol and drug use; however, no studies exist on the association between alcohol consumption and use of e-cigarettes or HNB tobacco products among Korean adolescents. This study evaluated alcohol-related behaviors and drug use in relation to whether a Korean nationally representative adolescent sample had ever used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products. Methods Data from the 2018 Korean Youth Risk Behavior Web-based Survey were analyzed. The final study sample comprised 60,040 adolescents. Chi-square and logistic regression were used to examine whether the ever having used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products was associated with alcohol-related behaviors and drug use. P-values for trends were calculated to examine the dose-response relationship for each variable. Results Respondents with higher drinking frequency, drinking quantity, alcohol intoxication, alcohol availability, and drug use were more likely to report having used e-cigarettes and HNB tobacco products, thus implying a significant relationship between substance use and novel tobacco product (P < .001). Conclusions Our findings suggest that at-risk adolescents who are engaged in other forms of risk-taking behaviors are prone to attract the experimentation with e-cigarettes or HNB tobacco products. Thus, smoking cessation programs related to substance use should be implemented, and there is an urgent need to monitor and regulate these products effectively."
https://openalex.org/W2965759123,"What determines a team’s home advantage, and why does it change with time? Is it something about the rowdiness of the hometown crowd? Is it something about the location of the team? Or is it something about the team itself, the quality of the team or the styles it may or may not play? To answer these questions, season performance statistics were downloaded for all NBA teams across 32 seasons (83–84 to 17–18). Data were also obtained for other potential influences identified in the literature including: stadium attendance, altitude, and team market size. Using an artificial neural network, a team’s home advantage was diagnosed using team performance statistics only. Attendance, altitude, and market size were unsuccessful at improving this diagnosis. The style of play is a key factor in the home advantage. Teams that make more two point and free-throw shots see larger advantages at home. Given the rise in three-point shooting in recent years, this finding partially explains the gradual decline in home advantage observed across the league over time."
https://openalex.org/W2964532109,"Glycosaminoglycans in the skin interstitium and endothelial surface layer have been shown to be involved in local sodium accumulation without commensurate water retention. Dysfunction of heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans may therefore disrupt sodium and water homeostasis. In this study, we investigated the effects of combined heterozygous loss of heparan sulfate polymerization genes (exostosin glycosyltransferase 1 and 2; Ext1+/-Ext2+/-) on sodium and water homeostasis. Sodium storage capacity was decreased in Ext1+/-Ext2+/- mice as reflected by a 77% reduction in endothelial surface layer thickness and a lower skin sodium-to-glycosaminoglycan ratio. Also, these mice were characterized by a higher heart rate, increased fluid intake, increased plasma osmolality and a decreased skin water and sodium content, suggesting volume depletion. Upon chronic high sodium intake, the initial volume depletion was restored but no blood pressure increase was observed. Acute hypertonic saline infusion resulted in a distinct blood pressure response: we observed a significant 15% decrease in control mice whereas blood pressure did not change in Ext1+/-Ext2+/- mice. This differential blood pressure response may be explained by the reduced capacity for sodium storage and/or the impaired vasodilation response, as measured by wire myography, which was observed in Ext1+/-Ext2+/- mice. Together, these data demonstrate that defective heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycan synthesis leads to abnormal sodium and water homeostasis and an abnormal response to sodium loading, most likely caused by inadequate capacity for local sodium storage."
https://openalex.org/W2965145268,"Memory deficits affect a large proportion of the human population and are associated with aging and many neurologic, neurodegenerative, and psychiatric diseases. Treatment of this mental disorder has been disappointing because all potential candidates studied thus far have failed to produce consistent effects across various types of memory and have shown limited to no effects on memory deficits. Here, we show that the promotion of neuronal arborization through the expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling 14 of 414 amino acids (RGS14414) not only induced robust enhancement of multiple types of memory but was also sufficient for the recovery of recognition, spatial, and temporal memory, which are kinds of episodic memory that are primarily affected in patients or individuals with memory dysfunction. We observed that a surge in neuronal arborization was mediated by up-regulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling and that the deletion of BDNF abrogated both neuronal arborization activation and memory enhancement. The activation of BDNF-dependent neuronal arborization generated almost 2-fold increases in synapse numbers in dendrites of pyramidal neurons and in neurites of nonpyramidal neurons. This increase in synaptic connections might have evoked reorganization within neuronal circuits and eventually supported an increase in the activity of such circuits. Thus, in addition to showing the potential of RGS14414 for rescuing memory deficits, our results suggest that a boost in circuit activity could facilitate memory enhancement and the reversal of memory deficits.-Masmudi-Martín, M., Navarro-Lobato, I., López-Aranda, M.

https://openalex.org/W2965216186,"Introduction Cardiac catheterization procedures result in high radiation doses and often multiple procedures are necessary for congenital heart disease patients. However, diagnostic reference levels (DRL) remain scarce. Our first goal was finding the optimal DRL parameter and determining appropriate DRLs. The second goal was to calculate organ doses (OD), effective doses (ED) and lifetime attributable risks (LAR) per procedure and to provide conversion factors based on dose area product (DAP). Materials and methods DRLs are calculated for each procedure type, as the 75th percentile of the cumulative value per procedure from the corresponding parameter. All irradiation events in the DICOM Structured Reports were automatically processed and simulated using PCXMC, resulting in OD, ED and LAR. Using a Kruskal Wallis H test and subsequent pairwise comparisons, differences in median values of the DRL parameter between procedure types were assessed. Results Linear regression showed a strong correlation and narrow confidence interval between DAP and product of body weight and fluoroscopy time (BWxFT), even when all procedures (diagnostic and interventional) are combined. Only 15% of the pairwise comparisons were statistically significant for DAP normalized to BWxFT (DAPBWxFT). The latter pairs contained less frequent procedure types with significant outliers. For DAP normalized to BW (DAPBW), 38% of the pairwise comparisons showed statistically significant differences. Conversion factors from DAPBW to OD and ED were reported for various weight groups, due to the higher correlation between DAPBW and both OD and ED than between DAP and both OD and ED. Conclusions The P75 of DAPBWxFT for all procedures combined serves as an appropriate DRL value. This facilitates local DRL determination in smaller paediatric centres, which often have insufficient data to produce appropriate DRLs for different procedure types. Conversion factors are more reliable starting from DAPBW instead of DAP and should be used according to the appropriate BW group."

The biosynthesis of phycoerythrobilin (PEB) is catalyzed by the subsequent action of two ferredoxin-dependent bilin reductases (FDBRs). Although 15,16-dihydrobiliverdin (DHBV):ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebA) catalyzes the two-electron reduction of biliverdin IXα to 15,16-DHBV, PEB:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PebB) reduces this intermediate further to PEB. Interestingly, marine viruses encode the FDBR PebS combining both activities within one enzyme. Although PebA and PebS share a canonical fold with similar substrate-binding pockets, the structural determinants for the stereo- and regiospecific modification of their tetrapyrrole substrates are incompletely understood, also because of the lack of a PebB structure. Here, we solved the X-ray crystal structures of both substrate-free and -bound PEBB from the cryptophyte Guillardia theta at 1.90 and 1.65 Å, respectively. The structures of PEBB exhibit the typical α/β/α-sandwich fold. Interestingly, the open-chain tetrapyrrole substrate DHBV is bound in an unexpected flipped orientation within the canonical FDBR active site. Biochemical analyses of the WT enzyme and active site variants identified two central aspartate residues Asp-99 and Asp-219 as essential for catalytic activity. In addition, the conserved Arg-215 plays a critical role in substrate specificity, binding orientation, and active site integrity. Because these critical residues are conserved within certain FDBRs displaying A-ring reduction activity, we propose that they present a conserved mechanism for this reaction. The flipped substrate-binding mode indicates that two-electron reducing FDBRs utilize the same primary site within the binding pocket and that substrate orientation is the determinant for A- or D-ring regiospecificity.

https://openalex.org/W2966434391,"The BG-Malaria trap (BGM) is an adaptation of the well-known BG-Sentinel trap (BGS) with greater trapping efficiencies for anopheline and culicine mosquitoes. Its continued optimization requires greater understanding of mosquito flight behaviors near it. We used three high-resolution infrared cameras (68 frames/second) to track flight behaviors of laboratory-reared Anopheles arabiensis females in vicinity of the BGM in comparison with BGS. Additional comparisons were done for BGM at 20, 40 and 80cm heights, and for BGMs baited with Ifakara blend plus CO2, CO2 alone, or no bait. More mosquitoes were observed near BGM than BGS. Both BGMs installed 20cm above the floor and baited with CO2 received more visits by host-seeking mosquitoes than the other BGMs evaluated in their respective experiments. Trap designs, height and attractants all influence mosquito activity in vicinity of the traps which can be readily visualized using infrared cameras to accelerate trap development and testing. The greater activity of host-seeking mosquitoes near BGM than BGS supports the proven superiority of BGM traps in field and semi-field settings."

Here, we employed functional genomics (i.e. RNAseq) to determine differentially expressed genes in young and aged TAU58/2 mice to identify alterations in cellular processes that may contribute to neuropathy. We identified genes in cortical brain samples differentially regulated between young and old TAU58/2 mice relative to nontransgenic littermates and by comparative analysis with a dataset of CNS cell type–specific genes expressed in nontransgenic mice. Most differentially-regulated genes had known or putative roles in neurons and included presynaptic and excitatory genes.

https://openalex.org/W2965103268,"Peer support is a widely used intervention that offers information and emotional support to parents during their infant’s admission to the neonatal unit and/or post-discharge. Despite its widespread use, there are no comprehensive insights into the nature and types of neonatal-related peer support, or the training and support offered to peer supporters. We aimed to bridge these knowledge gaps via an international study into neonatal peer support provision. A mixed-methods study comprising an online survey was issued to peer support services/organisations, and follow-up interviews held with a purposive sample of survey respondents. Survey/interview questions explored the funding, types of peer support and the recruitment, training and support for peer supporters. Descriptive and thematic analysis was undertaken. Thirty-one managers/coordinators/trainers and 77 peer supporters completed the survey from 48 peer support organisations/services in 16 different countries; with 26 interviews undertaken with 27 survey respondents. We integrated survey and interview findings into five themes: ‘background and infrastructure of peer support services', ‘timing, location and nature of peer support’, ‘recruitment and suitability of peer supporters’, ‘training provision’ and ‘professional and emotional support’. Findings highlight variations in the types of peer support provided, training and development opportunities, supervisory and mentoring arrangements and the methods of recruitment and support for peer supporters; with these differences largely related to the size, funding, multidisciplinary involvement, and level of integration of peer support within healthcare pathways and contexts. Despite challenges, promising strategies were reported across the different services to inform macro (e.g. to facilitate management and leadership support), meso (e.g. to help embed peer support in practice) and micro (e.g. to improve training, supervision and support of peer supporters) recommendations to underpin the operationalisation and delivery of PS provision."

In this study, field experiments were conducted to determine the critical factors that regulate biomass translocation in rice. Biomass translocation and production characteristics of two rice hybrids (Guiliangyou 2 and Y-liangyou 1) were compared between two site-year environments (Naning-2014 and Yongan-2018). Results showed that biomass translocation parameters (biomass translocation amount and rate and contribution of biomass translocation to filled grain weight) and ratio of biomass production during pre-heading to post-heading (BPpre/BPpost ratio) decreased in Guiliangyou 2 but increased in Y-liangyou 1 with the environment change from Nanning-2014 to Yongan-2018. The decreased BPpre/BPpost in Guiliangyou 2 was attributable to increased biomass production during post-heading (BPpost), while the increased BPpre/BPpost ratio in Y-liangyou 1 was due to increased biomass production during pre-heading (BPpre). Higher cumulative incident solar radiation and larger diurnal temperature variation were responsible for the increased BPpost in Guiliangyou 2 and the increased BPpre in Y-liangyou 1 grown in Yongan in 2018 compared to in Nanning in 2014. The results of this study indicate that changes in biomass translocation and production with environment (climate) in rice are dependent on genotype and that the BPpre/BPpost ratio is an important factor regulating biomass translocation in rice."
https://openalex.org/W2965274660,"Acute alcohol exposure alters the trafficking and function of many G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are associated with aberrant behavioral responses to alcohol. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced changes in GPCR function remain unclear. β-Arrestin is a key player involved in the regulation of GPCR internalization and thus controls the magnitude and duration of GPCR signaling. Although β-arrestin levels are influenced by various drugs of abuse, the effect of alcohol exposure on β-arrestin expression and β-arrestin–mediated GPCR trafficking is poorly understood. Here, we found that acute ethanol exposure increases β-arrestin2 degradation via its increased ubiquitination in neuroblastoma-2a (N2A) cells and rat prefrontal cortex (PFC). β-Arrestin2 ubiquitination was likely mediated by the E3 ligase MDM2 homolog (MDM2), indicated by an increased coupling between β-arrestin2 and MDM2 in response to acute ethanol exposure in both N2A cells and rat PFC homogenates. Importantly, ethanol-induced β-arrestin2 reduction was reversed by siRNA-mediated MDM2 knockdown or proteasome inhibition in N2A cells, suggesting β-arrestin2 degradation is mediated by MDM2 through the proteasomal pathway. Using serotonin 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1ARs) as a model receptor system, we found that ethanol dose-dependently inhibits 5-HT1AR internalization and that MDM2 knockdown reverses this effect. Moreover, ethanol both reduced β-arrestin2 levels and delayed agonist-induced β-arrestin2 recruitment to the membrane. We conclude that β-arrestin2 dysregulation by ethanol impairs 5-HT1AR trafficking.

This notion is further supported by a recent longitudinal study showing that individuals who exhibit higher sensitivity to the rewarding effect and lower sensitivity to the sedative effect of an initial acute alcohol exposure were more likely to develop symptoms of alcohol use disorders and escalate their alcohol consumption over time (4King A.C. Hasin D. O'Connor S.J. McNamara P.J. Cao D. A prospective 5-year re-examination of alcohol response in heavy drinkers progressing in alcohol use disorder.Biol.

Many aspects of behavioral responses to alcohol are mediated by various G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). 2The abbreviations used are: GPCRG-protein–coupled receptor5-HT1ARserotonin 5-HT1A receptorCB1Rcannabinoid type 1 receptorGRKG-protein–coupled receptor kinaseN2Aneuroblastoma 2aNEDD4neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4PFCprefrontal cortexANOVAanalysis of variancemGluR5metabotropic glutamate receptor 5GTPγSguanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphateHRPhorseradish peroxidase8-OH-DPAT8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin. For example, ethanol-induced locomotor stimulation is mediated by serotonin 5-HT1A receptors (5-HT1ARs) because treatment with 5-HT1AR agonist (8-OH-DPAT) reduced locomotor activity in response to an acute ethanol exposure (2.5 g/kg, i.p.) (5Blomqvist O. Söderpalm B. Engel J.A. 5-HT1A receptor agonists reduce ethanol-induced locomotor activity in mice.Alcohol. 1994; 11 (8204202): 157-16110.1016/0741-8329(94)90057-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). Moreover, the sedative effect of ethanol is regulated by metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) as genetic deletion of mGluR5 or treatment with the mGluR5 antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine, increases the duration of loss of righting reflex in mice acutely exposed to ethanol (6Blednov Y.A.

Thus, elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced neuroadaptations in GPCRs is important for identifying potential new targets that mediate aberrant behavioral responses to alcohol.

Upon GPCR activation, β-arrestin is recruited to the receptor followed by uncoupling of the receptor from Gα-proteins and then a direct interaction with clathrin to induce receptor internalization. The rate and amplitude of GPCR internalization mediated by β-arrestin determine the duration and strength of GPCR signaling. Thus, a change in β-arrestin expression would alter receptor internalization, signaling, and receptor-mediated behavioral responses to ethanol. For instance, knockout of β-arrestin2 increases [35S]GTPγS binding to cannabinoid type 1 receptors (CB1Rs) in the cortex, which is presumably due to increased CB1R protein levels on the plasma membrane (7Nguyen P.T. Schmid C.L. Raehal K.M. Selley D.E. Bohn L.M. Sim-Selley L.J. β-Arrestin2 regulates cannabinoid CB1 receptor signaling and adaptation in a central nervous system region-dependent manner.Biol.

The level of CB1R is known to be positively associated with ethanol consumption and preference (8Naassila M. Pierrefiche O. Ledent C. Daoust M.

The effect of acute or chronic ethanol exposure on β-arrestin expression is largely unknown with one exception. Chronic ethanol exposure was reported to increase β-arrestin mRNA and protein levels in the hippocampus and the striatum of alcohol-preferring rats after voluntary ethanol consumption (6% v/v, 21 days) compared with nonpreferring rats (10Björk K. Rimondini R. Hansson A.C. Terasmaa A. Hyytiä P. Heilig M. Sommer W.H.

The route, duration, and dose of ethanol exposure likely influence the effect of ethanol on β-arrestin expression. Thus, the first aim of this study was to examine the effect of acute ethanol exposure on β-arrestin expression using both cultured cells and rodent brains. When GPCRs are internalized upon stimulation, β-arrestin dissociates from the internalized receptors. The dissociated β-arrestin either recycles to the membrane to promote additional cycles of internalization or enters proteasomes or lysosomes for degradation (11Shenoy S.K. Barak L.S. Xiao K. Ahn S.

The endocytic fate of β-arrestin, recycling or degradation, is strongly controlled by post-translational modifications such as ubiquitination (13Jean-Charles P.Y. Freedman N.J. Shenoy S.K. Cellular roles of β-arrestins as substrates and adaptors of ubiquitination and deubiquitination.Prog. Mol. Biol. Transl.

Ubiquitination involves the sequential action of three enzymes: ubiquitin-activating E1 enzyme, ubiquitin-carrying E2 enzyme, and ubiquitin protein E3 ligase (14Hershko A. Ciechanover A. The ubiquitin system.Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1998; 67 (9759494): 425-47910.1146/annurev.biochem.67.1.425Crossref PubMed Scopus (6897) Google Scholar). When E3 ligases bind to their substrates, E2 enzymes are recruited to transfer ubiquitin molecules to the substrate (15Clague M.J. Urbé S. Ubiquitin: same molecule, different degradation pathways.Cell. 2010; 143 (21111229): 682-68510.1016/j.cell.2010.11.012Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar).

For example, β-arrestin forms a complex with MDM2 in CHW cells, COS-7 cells, and mouse brain lysate, and this β-arrestin2–MDM2 interaction results in an increase in both basal and receptor-stimulated β-arrestin ubiquitination (16Shenoy S.K.

However, ubiquitination is a reversible modification as linkages between ubiquitin and substrates are frequently hydrolyzed by deubiquitinating enzymes to maintain protein homeostasis and an available pool of free ubiquitin in the cell (19Akutsu M. Dikic I. Bremm A. Ubiquitin chain diversity at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 (26906419): 875-88010.1242/jcs.183954Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). E3 ligases can modify one or multiple lysine residues of a protein with either a single ubiquitin molecule (mono-ubiquitination) or ubiquitin polymers (poly-ubiquitination) (19Akutsu M. Dikic I. Bremm A. Ubiquitin chain diversity at a glance.J. Cell Sci. 2016; 129 (26906419): 875-88010.1242/jcs.183954Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). Emerging evidence suggests that poly-ubiquitination directs substrates to proteasomes for degradation, whereas mono-ubiquitination is primarily involved in protein trafficking (15Clague M.J. Urbé S.

It has been well-characterized that there is an increase in β-arrestin poly-ubiquitination when receptors are stimulated. For instance, activation of the β2-adrenergic receptor in HEK293 and COS-7 cells increases β-arrestin poly-ubiquitination in an MDM2-dependent manner (11Shenoy S.K. Barak L.S. Xiao K. Ahn S. Berthouze M. Shukla A.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Ubiquitination of β-arrestin links seven-transmembrane receptor endocytosis and ERK activation.J. Biol.

Ubiquitinated β-arrestins are predominantly deubiquitinated and become available for subsequent recruitment to activated receptors; however, persistent ubiquitination of β-arrestin can lead to degradation (11Shenoy S.K. Barak L.S. Xiao K. Ahn S. Berthouze M. Shukla A.K. Luttrell L.M. Lefkowitz R.J. Ubiquitination of β-arrestin links seven-transmembrane receptor endocytosis and ERK activation.J. Biol.

Disruption of β-arrestin ubiquitination homeostasis could dysregulate the post-endocytic fate of β-arrestin and subsequent degradation, which will impact GPCR trafficking and activity. Thus, the second aim of this study was to determine the effect of acute ethanol exposure on β-arrestin ubiquitination and degradation as a potential mechanism for altered β-arrestin expression. Acute ethanol exposure disrupts the trafficking of GPCRs in rodent brains and cultured neurons. For example, acute ethanol treatment (30 mm, 2 h) to rat hippocampus cultured neurons significantly increases GABAB receptor surface expression compared with the vehicle treatment (23Wolfe S.A. Workman E.R. Heaney C.F. Niere F. Namjoshi S. Cacheaux L.P. Farris S.P. Drew M.R. Zemelman B.V. Harris R.A. Raab-Graham K.F. FMRP regulates an ethanol-dependent shift in GABABR function and expression with rapid antidepressant properties.Nat. Commun. 2016; 7 (27666021): 1286710.1038/ncomms12867Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Moreover, acute ethanol administration (2.5 g/kg, p.o.) increases [3H]DAMGO binding to μ-opioid receptors in rat PFC (24Méndez M. Leriche M. Calva J.C. Acute ethanol administration differentially modulates μ opioid receptors in the rat meso-accumbens and mesocortical pathways.Brain Res. Mol.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol-induced alterations in GPCR trafficking remain unclear. Because β-arrestin plays an important role in regulating the trafficking of many GPCRs, a change in β-arrestin expression and/or recruitment by ethanol exposure would influence receptor trafficking. We used 5-HT1ARs as a receptor model system to determine the effect of acute ethanol exposure on β-arrestin–mediated GPCR trafficking because the mechanism of 5-HT1AR trafficking is well-characterized (25Rojas P.S. Fiedler J.L. What do we really know about 5-HT1A receptor signaling in neuronal cells?.Front. Cell.

This study showed for the first time that acute ethanol exposure increases proteasome-dependent β-arrestin2 degradation via MDM2 in both neuroblastoma 2a (N2A) cells and rat PFC. Furthermore, ethanol exposure abolished agonist-induced 5-HT1AR trafficking that is likely attributed to dysregulation of β-arrestin2 expression and activity. We verified the specificity of a commercially available β-arrestin2 antibody in cells treated with β-arrestin2 siRNA. The protein levels of β-arrestin2 were assessed by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Knockdown of β-arrestin2 via siRNA significantly reduced β-arrestin2 protein levels by 63.43 ± 9.40% when compared with the control cells transfected with a corresponding scrambled siRNA (Fig. S1A, unpaired Student’s t test, p < 0.001). Additionally, β-arrestin2 levels were also examined in knockdown and control cells by immunocytochemistry. There was a pronounced reduction of β-arrestin2 fluorescent intensity in β-arrestin2 siRNA-treated cells when compared with the scrambled siRNA treatment (Fig. S1B, unpaired Student’s t test, p < 0.01). We examined the effect of acute ethanol exposure on β-arrestin1/2 expression in both N2A cells and rat PFC. In N2A cells, β-arrestin1/2 levels were determined following the treatment with ethanol (15–75 mm) or vehicle (media) for 18 h without withdrawal (Fig. 1A). Data were normalized to the protein level of β-actin, which was not altered by ethanol treatment. A one-way ANOVA revealed a significant dose effect of ethanol on β-arrestin2 protein level, F(3,20) = 5.796, p < 0.01. Bonferroni post hoc analysis showed that 30 and 75 mm ethanol treatment significantly reduced β-arrestin2 levels by 44.8 ± 2.0 and 60.3 ± 1.7%, respectively, when compared with the vehicle treatment (Fig. 1A, p < 0.01). The β-arrestin1 protein levels were not detectable in N2A cells with or without ethanol treatment. The reduced β-arrestin2 level was not due to toxicity induced by ethanol because the selected ethanol doses did not alter cell viability and membrane permeability measured by trypan blue assay (Fig. S2A) and immunocytochemistry, respectively (Fig. S2, B and C). A similar effect was observed in the PFC of rats acutely exposed to ethanol vapor for 12 h without withdrawal (Fig. 1B). Ethanol exposure significantly reduced β-arrestin2 protein levels in the PFC by 32.4 ± 2.0% compared with the air exposure (Fig. 1B, unpaired Student’s t test, p < 0.05). However, β-arrestin1 protein levels did not significantly differ between ethanol- and air-treated groups. We further examined whether ethanol-induced reduction in β-arrestin2 levels was due to an increase in ubiquitination and subsequent degradation. First, immunocytochemistry was performed to measure the co-localization between fluorescently labeled β-arrestin2 (green) and ubiquitin (red) in N2A cells following 18 h of ethanol (15–75 mm) or vehicle (media) treatment (Fig. 2A). Co-localization was calculated as the number of spatially overlapped pixels (Fig. 2A, yellow) between β-arrestin2 (green) and ubiquitin (red) followed by conversion into a co-localization coefficient using FIJI software (National Institutes of Health). A one-way ANOVA indicated a significant effect of ethanol treatment on the co-localization between β-arrestin2 and ubiquitin, F(3,116) = 14.87, p < 0.01. Bonferroni post hoc analysis revealed that 30 and 75 mm ethanol treatment significantly increased this co-localization by 87.6 ± 2.1% (30 mm) and 201.9 ± 7.5% (75 mm) when compared with the vehicle treatment (Fig. 2B, p < 0.01). We also performed immunoprecipitation assays as a complementary approach to immunocytochemistry to examine whether there was an increased coupling between ubiquitin and β-arrestin2 following ethanol exposure (30 mm; 18 h). First, to verify the specificity of the β-arrestin2 antibody used for immunoprecipitation, we immunoprecipitated β-arrestin2 in the presence or absence of a custom-made β-arrestin2–blocking peptide in drug-naïve N2A cells and rat PFC tissue. The blocking peptide completely eliminated signals produced by antibodies used to immunoblot for ubiquitin and β-arrestin2 from immunoprecipitated β-arrestin2 samples (Fig. 2C), suggesting the specificity of this β-arrestin2 antibody for immunoprecipitation. Then, we used this antibody to immunoprecipitate β-arrestin2 followed by immunoblotting for ubiquitin, which resulted in distinct mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination signals (Fig. 2D). We selected the ∼60-kDa band as mono-ubiquitinated β-arrestin2 based on the presumed ∼8-kDa upward shift in the molecular mass of β-arrestin2 caused by the addition of one ubiquitin chain. The poly-ubiquitination signal for β-arrestin2 present at a molecular mass of >80 kDa was consistent with reports from the literature (22Fornai F. Lenzi P. Capobianco L. Iacovelli L. Scarselli P. Lazzeri G. De Blasi A. Involvement of dopamine receptors and beta-arrestin in methamphetamine-induced inclusions formation in PC12 cells.J.

In N2A cells, we found that ethanol treatment increased both mono-ubiquitination and poly-ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 by 83.2 ± 1.7 and 83.6 ± 2.7%, respectively, compared with the vehicle treatment (Fig. 2, E and F, unpaired Student’s t test, p < 0.01). Similar to our observation in N2A cells, immunoprecipitation of β-arrestin2 in rat PFC homogenates showed that ethanol exposure significantly increased mono-ubiquitination by 46.8 ± 1.5% and poly-ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 by 50.9 ± 2.2% compared with the air treatment (Fig. 2, I–K), unpaired Student’s t test, p < 0.05. Because the interaction between the protein substrate and E3 ligases facilitates protein ubiquitination, we further assessed the strength of β-arrestin2 coupling to MDM2 in response to ethanol exposure. Ethanol exposure increased the association of MDM2 with immunoprecipitated β-arrestin2 by 91.1 ± 2.2 and 32.6 ± 1.3% in N2A cells and rat PFC, respectively, when compared with their corresponding control treatments (Fig. 2, G and L, unpaired Student’s t test, p < 0.05). In contrast, ethanol exposure had no effect on the association of immunoprecipitated β-arrestin2 with another E3 ligase, NEDD4, in either model system (Fig. 2, H and M). It is also worth noting that the relative intensities of bands between mono- and poly-ubiquitinated β-arrestin2 in N2A cells were notably different from those in rat PFC tissues. This is likely attributed to differential expressions of various E2 and E3 ligases involved in ubiquitination of β-arrestin2 in each model. Additionally, bands located between mono- (∼60 kDa) and poly-ubiquitinated β-arrestin2 (>80 kDa) likely reflect a spectrum of different ubiquitination states (bi-, tri-, tetra-ubiquitination, etc.) on individual lysine residues, as described previously (31Seyfried N.T. Xu P. Duong D.M. Cheng D. Hanfelt J. Peng J. Systematic approach for validating the ubiquitinated proteome.Anal. Chem. 2008; 80 (18433149): 4161-416910.1021/ac702516aCrossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Because the role of these intermediate ubiquitination states is currently unclear, this study focused on mono- and poly-ubiquitination of β-arrestin2. Because there was an increased association of β-arrestin2 with MDM2 following ethanol exposure, we further determined whether MDM2 was involved in ethanol-induced degradation of β-arrestin2. To this end, MDM2 was knocked down via siRNA in N2A-5HT1AR cells, and β-arrestin2 protein levels were measured after ethanol treatment (30–75 mm, 18 h) (Fig. 3B). MDM2 siRNA treatment reduced the MDM2 protein level by 57.8 ± 1.4% (Fig. 3A, unpaired Student’s t test, p < 0.05) when compared with scrambled siRNA treatment. Furthermore, a two-way ANOVA revealed significant main effects of knockdown, F(1,24) = 18.24, p < 0.01; ethanol exposure, F(2,24) = 7.70, p < 0.01; and interaction, F(2,24) = 4.67, p < 0.05. Bonferroni post hoc analysis showed that MDM2 knockdown completely blocked ethanol-induced β-arrestin2 degradation when compared with scrambled siRNA treatment (Fig. 3, B and C, p < 0.05). Previous studies showed that ubiquitination primarily directs β-arrestin2 for proteasome-dependent degradation in C6 glioma and PC12 cells (21Golan M. Schreiber G. Avissar S. Antidepressants increase β-arrestin 2 ubiquitinylation and degradation by the proteasomal pathway in C6 rat glioma cells.J. Pharmacol. Exp.

Our aim was to co-develop Impilo neZenkolo (‘Health through Faith’), a healthy lifestyle programme for low-income, black South Africans delivered through churches, and evaluate its feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness. In the first phase we developed programme materials with church members. In the second phase we trained lay leaders to deliver the programme and assessed feasibility, acceptability (observation, focus groups and interviews) and potential effectiveness (pre and post measurement of weight, hip and waist circumferences, blood pressure, self-reported physical activity, dietary habits, health status, self-esteem, psychological distress). The study was conducted in four churches in urban and rural South Africa. The development workshops led to increased focus on positive benefits of participation, widening inclusion criteria to all adults and greater emphasis on Christian ethos. Challenges to feasibility included: recruitment of churches; scheduling of programme sessions (leading to one church not delivering the programme); attendance at the programme (63% attended more than half of the 12 weekly sessions); and poor programme fidelity (in particular in teaching behaviour change techniques). Aspects of the programme were acceptable, particularly the way in which the programme was aligned with a Christian ethos. There was some indication that amongst the 42/68 (62%) for whom we were obtained pre- and post-programme measurements the programme has potential to support weight loss. We conclude that a healthy lifestyle programme for low-income, black South Africans, delivered through churches, may be viable with extensive re-development of delivery strategies. These include finding external funding for the programme, endorsement from national level denominational organisations and the professionalization of programme leadership, including paid rather than volunteer leaders to ensure sufficient time can be spent in training."

The effect of various wash-coated materials and catalyst promoter on the growth rate of CNFs on monolith substrates were examined. The characteristics of the synthesized CNFs-coated monolith composites were examined using Raman spectroscopy, Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), and Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques. According to the textural characterization study, the specific surface area and pore volume of CNFs-coated monolith composites were significantly improved as compared to bare monolith which might be attributed to the growth of highly pure and aligned CNFs over monolith substrate. Besides that, the synthesized CNFs-coated monolith possessed extremely well thermal stability up to the temperature of 550 °C which was corresponded to the strong attachment of highly graphitized CNFs over monolith substrates."

The present study tested the generalization of an associative deficit across word, name, and nonword stimulus types in younger and older adults. Participants completed associative and item memory tests in one of three stimulus conditions and made metacognitive ratings of perceptions of self-efficacy, task success (""postdictions""), strategy success, task effort, difficulty, fatigue, and stamina. Surprisingly, no support was found for an age-related associative deficit on any of the stimulus types. We analyzed our data further using a multilayer perceptron artificial neural network. The network was trained to classify individuals as younger or older and its hidden unit activities were examined to identify data patterns that distinguished younger from older participants. Analysis of hidden unit activities revealed that the network was able to correctly classify by identifying three different clusters of participants, with two qualitatively different groups of older individuals. One cluster of older individuals found the tasks to be relatively easy, they believed they had performed well, and their beliefs were accurate. The other cluster of older individuals found the tasks to be difficult, believed they were performing relatively poorly, yet their beliefs did not map accurately onto their performance. Crucially, data from the associative task were more useful for neural networks to discriminate between younger and older adults than data from the item task. This work underscores the importance of considering both individual and age differences as well as metacognitive responses in the context of associative memory paradigms."
https://openalex.org/W2966307297,"Beyond subject matter learning, primary science teaching aims at encouraging positive attitudes toward, and lasting interest in, science. This study tested whether the learning and science commitment of 8- to 10-year old pupils was affected by extracurricular learning opportunities involving repeated interactions with free-living northern bald ibis (Geronticus eremita; an endangered bird species) and professional researchers. To examine the project's efficacy, pupils' learning progress was monitored by repeated measures of knowledge (i) about northern bald ibises in specific, and (ii) of bird diversity in general. In addition, the children's attitudes toward science were monitored and their dynamic mental models of northern bald ibis' morphology and size were assessed from drawings. A total of 55 pupils from two schools were tested for eight months (before, during and after the experience). Control groups went through regular (curricular) science lessons with similar content and time investment. The extracurricular experience produced a clear learning progress with large effect sizes, which was particularly evident on a long timescale. In addition to subject matter knowledge, the project group pupils could name more bird species and expressed their views about the importance of scientific research for society in a higher proportion than control groups. Differences between schools suggest that project participation also changed the teacher's own interest in northern bald ibises, which affected learning in the control group taught by the same teacher. Beyond the pupils' language and reading skills, learning progress was also visible by scoring ibis-typical features in drawings; their mental models of relative size were not changed due to project participation, however. The results are discussed in reference to inducing and maintaining pupils' attitude and interest in a topic. The study adds empirical evidence for the potentials of advancing primary science education e. g. by fostering the collaboration of schools with scientists."
https://openalex.org/W2966617376,"Geophagia is a feeding behavior involving the regular intake of soil, including clay-like kaolin. Frequent in Africa, kaolin consumption is associated with heavy metal intoxication, iron and other micronutrient deficiencies, geohelminth infection and inactivation of concomitantly taken drugs. It is expected that this practice would be imported into an asylum country during the immigration process. To confirm this hypothesis, a single center, cross-sectional study was conducted at the University Hospital of Nantes, France, whose main objective was to assess whether the prevalence of kaolin consumers was high in a migrant population living in a large French metropolitan area (the city of Nantes). Each woman consulting for the first time at the Medical and Psychosocial Gynecology Obstetric Unit during the inclusion period ranging from January 1, 2017, to July 1, 2017, was asked for consent to be included in the study. The main outcome was the proportion of positive answers regarding consumption of kaolin within the last twelve months, with its 95% confidence interval (CI). A logistic regression was performed to identify drivers of consumption, and a clustering approach was conducted to identify profiles of consumers. A total of 284 women were included in the study, of whom 110 (38.7%) were pregnant. Our main finding was a 14.1% (95% CI: 10.5-18.6) prevalence of clay consumers. Second, the characteristic most strongly associated with consumption was Central or West Africa origin (adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) = 52.7; 95% CI: 13.7-202.2). Finally, 60% of consumers showed signs of addictive-like phenomena, and three profiles were identified, depicting a continuum of patients in regard to their control over their kaolin consumption. Our results suggest that kaolin consumption is frequent in particular subpopulations of migrants. This warrants further study of the clinical consequences of kaolin consumption and its associated addictive-like symptoms."

Although missense mutations are diverse in their location within the p53 coding sequence, a great majority (>90%) of these missense mutations are clustered within the central, highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) 4The abbreviations used are: DBDDNA-binding domainOSCCoral squamous cell carcinomaEMSAelectrophoretic mobility shift assayGuHClguanidine hydrochlorideTSGtumor suppressor geneDEGdifferentially expressed genesMMP1matrix metalloproteinase 1P4Hprolyl 4-hydroxylaseqPCRquantitative PCRβ-galβ-galactosidaseEGFRepidermal growth factor receptorGOFgain of function. region (13Pavletich N.P.

These residues are termed as “hot spot residues” (15Freed-Pastor W.A. Prives C.

Mutations have an impact on p53 protein at two different yet interconnected levels. p53 mutants that arise due to the mutations in amino acid residues that make direct contact with the target DNA sequence are “DNA contact” or Class I mutants (such as mutation in Arg-273, Arg-248), whereas “conformational” or Class II mutants (such as Arg-175, Gly-245, Arg-282) arise due to the mutations in residues responsible for maintaining the tertiary structure or conformation of the protein and hence cause disruption in the structure of p53 protein at either a local or global level (16Wong K.B.

Mutations in p53 can have various consequences that are not mutually exclusive. Apart from losing WT functions due to loss in DNA-binding activity of p53 and dominant-negative effects where mutant p53 forms mixed tetramer with coexpressed WT p53 and renders it incapable of DNA binding and transactivation (19Willis A. Jung E.J. Wakefield T. Chen X. Mutant p53 exerts a dominant negative effect by preventing wild-type p53 from binding to the promoter of its target genes.Oncogene. 2004; 23 (14743206): 2330-233810.1038/sj.onc.1207396Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar); missense mutations in p53 also contribute to tumorigenesis through their novel “gain-of-function” effects where mutant p53 acquire new biochemical and biological properties (20van Oijen M.G.

High frequency of missense mutations, high expression levels and prolonged t½ of mutant p53 (23Strano S. Dell'Orso S. Di Agostino S. Fontemaggi G. Sacchi A. Blandino G. Mutant p53: an oncogenic transcription factor.Oncogene. 2007; 26 (17401430): 2212-221910.1038/sj.onc.1210296Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) in the cell conspicuously supports the gain-of-function hypothesis (15Freed-Pastor W.A. Prives C. Mutant p53: one name, many proteins.Genes Dev. 2012; 26 (22713868): 1268-128610.1101/gad.190678.112Crossref PubMed Scopus (832) Google Scholar). Oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is the most frequent cancer type of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (24Poeta M.L. Manola J. Goldwasser M.A. Forastiere A. Benoit N. Califano J.A. Ridge J.A. Goodwin J. Kenady D. Saunders J. Westra W. Sidransky D. Koch W.M. TP53 mutations and survival in squamous-cell carcinoma of the head and neck.N. Engl. J. Med. 2007; 357 (18094376): 2552-256110.1056/NEJMoa073770Crossref PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar). TP53 mutations are etiologically associated with OSCC. One study reports tobacco users with a significantly higher evidence of TP53 mutation (25Lazarus P. Stern J. Zwiebel N. Fair A. Richie Jr., J.P. Schantz S. Relationship between p53 mutation incidence in oral cavity squamous cell carcinomas and patient tobacco use.Carcinogenesis. 1996; 17 (8625484): 733-73910.1093/carcin/17.4.733Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). R248Q, R175H, R273H, and R282W are the most frequent missense mutations observed in OSCC (26Petitjean A. Mathe E. Kato S. Ishioka C. Tavtigian S.V. Hainaut P. Olivier M. Impact of mutant p53 functional properties on TP53 mutation patterns and tumor phenotype: lessons from recent developments in the IARC TP53 database.Hum. Mutat. 2007; 28 (17311302): 622-62910.1002/humu.20495Crossref PubMed Scopus (1276) Google Scholar). The P152L mutation, although, not a hot spot mutation, still ranks 36th among the 50 most frequent p53 cancer mutants (27Brachmann R.K. p53 mutants: the Achilles' heel of human cancers?.Cell Cycle. 2004; 3 (15280671): 1030-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Moreover, the P152L mutation has also been reported in OSCC at the tongue and in the gingivobuccal site (28Hsieh L.L. Wang P.F. Chen I.H. Liao C.T. Wang H.M. Chen M.C. Chang J.T. Cheng A.J. Characteristics of mutations in the p53 gene in oral squamous cell carcinoma associated with betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking in Taiwanese.Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22 (11532872): 1497-150310.1093/carcin/22.9.1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). However, surprisingly, biochemical and functional characterization of this mutant protein has not been carried out yet. The proline to leucine mutation, at the 152nd position, resides in the S3/S4 turn opposite to the DNA-binding surface of the mutant p53. Here, we first performed biochemical assays to assess the impact of the P152L mutation on the cognate site DNA-binding ability. Our data clearly indicates the limited but detrimental effect of this mutation on the critical structural conformation essential for DNA binding of the full-length protein, which is ineffective in the context of isolated DBD. The stable expression of P152Lp53 in a p53-null cell line (H1299) significantly induces the tumorigenicity in a xenograft mouse model. RNA-Seq analysis of tumor cell-derived RNA samples reveals unique gain-of-function pathways induced by P152Lp53. To screen TP53 mutations in oral cancer samples, we performed immunohistochemistry with PAb240 antibody, which recognizes only conformational p53 mutants. From the tumor samples showing high expression levels of mutant p53 in the nucleus, we isolated genomic DNA from the stained region (Fig. 1a). The samples were sequenced for the region spanning the DNA-binding domain using specific primers from exons 4 to 9. In one of the oral cancer samples, we found C > T nucleotide substitution, which leads to a change in the amino acid from proline to leucine at position 152 in the DNA-binding domain of p53 (Fig. 1b). To predict a possible model of P152Lp53 interaction with the cognate DNA-binding site through the PyMOL-generated image, the coordinates of tumor suppressor p53 complexed with DNA (RCSB code 1TUP) were used. It was observed that Pro-152 is far and opposite to the surface of the protein, which is in contact with the cognate DNA sequence site (Fig. 1c). The zygosity of the mutant allele in the patient sample was determined by an allelic discrimination assay. Due to certain limitations of the software, calls were made manually by assessing the calculated normalized dye fluorescence (ΔRn) as a function of cycle number and the cycle threshold (CT) values, from which the mutant allele from the patient sample was found to be a heterozygote for P152L mutation (Table S5). The P152L mutation in p53 has earlier been identified in a patient with esophageal cancer (29Casson A.G. Mukhopadhyay T. Cleary K.R. Ro J.Y. Levin B. Roth J.A. p53 gene mutations in Barrett's epithelium and esophageal cancer.Cancer Res. 1991; 51 (1868473): 4495-4499PubMed Google Scholar), oral squamous cell carcinoma (28Hsieh L.L. Wang P.F. Chen I.H. Liao C.T. Wang H.M. Chen M.C. Chang J.T. Cheng A.J. Characteristics of mutations in the p53 gene in oral squamous cell carcinoma associated with betel quid chewing and cigarette smoking in Taiwanese.Carcinogenesis. 2001; 22 (11532872): 1497-150310.1093/carcin/22.9.1497Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), and Li-Fraumeni syndrome having pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma (30Wagner J. Portwine C. Rabin K. Leclerc J.M. Narod S.A. Malkin D. High frequency of germline p53 mutations in childhood adrenocortical cancer.J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1994; 86 (7966399): 1707-171010.1093/jnci/86.22.1707Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). To the best of our knowledge, the detailed functional characterization of P152Lp53 is yet to be done. We performed multiple sequence alignment of p53 protein sequences and observed the conservation of Pro-152 across the organisms during evolution suggesting its structural and functional importance (Fig. 1d). Upon analyzing the prevalence of the P152Lp53 mutation in cancer samples using COSMIC database, it was observed that, most of the mutation at the Pro-152 locus (73%) were missense rather than insertion or deletion mutations (Fig. S1a). Within a sequence stretch of 150–155 amino acids in the DNA-binding domain, frequency of the P152L missense mutation was relatively high as compared with other amino acid substitutions and is comparable with P151S substitution (Fig. 1e), which has already been found to confer gain-of-function activity in head and neck cancer cells (31Xie T.X. Zhou G. Zhao M. Sano D. Jasser S.A. Brennan R.G. Myers J.N. Serine substitution of proline at codon 151 of TP53 confers gain of function activity leading to anoikis resistance and tumor progression of head and neck cancer cells.Laryngoscope. 2013; 123 (23625637): 1416-142310.1002/lary.23846Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The most prevalent missense amino acid change at Pro-152 was found to be P152L (68.5%, Fig. 1f), indicating a higher occurrence of leucine substitution at Pro-152 loci in cancers as compared with other amino acid substitutions. The P152L mutation in p53 occurs in several solid cancers and its total distribution across different cancer tissue types is as follows: large intestine (26.13%), central nervous system (15.32%), esophagus (10.81%), and so on (Fig. 1g). An overall analysis suggested high prevalence of the TP53 (P152L) allele in human cancers, among all other type of mutations at the Pro-152 codon. During DNA damage activated p53 gets overexpressed and stabilized and causes activation of a number of p53 downstream target genes through its direct binding to its cognate sites on respective gene promoters. Hence, to investigate impact of the P152L mutation on the DNA-binding ability of the p53 protein we cloned and expressed both the full-length and the DNA-binding domain (Fig. S1b) of WT p53 and P152Lp53 and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with recombinant FLAG-tagged full-length Wtp53 and P152Lp53 protein using several γ-32P–labeled oligonucleotides containing p53 responsive elements of the following genes, GADD45A, CDKN1A, BAX, and MDM2. We observed that the full-length P152Lp53 protein could not bind to the p53 cognate sequences at all, as compared with WT protein (Fig. 2a). To ensure the sequence specific binding of p53 to its oligonucleotides, point mutations in the GADD45A consensus sequence was created and subjected to EMSA. As expected, both the WT and mutant p53 could not form any complex with the GADD45A mutant consensus sequence (Fig. S1c, lanes 4 and 8). These observations suggest that P152L missense mutations leads to abrogation of the DNA-binding ability of p53. Pro-152 is located in a very intriguing position in the DBD of p53 (Fig. 1c). Mutation at this position should not affect the DNA binding of p53, at least of the DBD. Therefore, the effect of the P152L mutation on the DNA-binding ability of the DBD of p53 was assessed. For this purpose EMSA was performed using bacterially expressed untagged WT and P152Lp53 DBD protein. Remarkably, we observed that both WT and P152Lp53 DBD were able to form DNA-protein complex with the GADD45A, CDKN1A, BAX, and MDM2 promoter consensus sequence (Fig. 2b). Likewise, they could not bind to the GADD45A mutant consensus sequence suggesting that DBD-DNA complexes are a result of sequence-specific binding (Fig. S1d, lanes 2 and 3 versus lanes 5 and 6). We validated this result further with cold competition assay for mutant p53 DBD binding to the GADD45A promoter consensus sequence (Fig. S1e, lanes 2–5 and 6–8). These results collectively show that the P152L mutation does not alter the DNA-binding ability of p53 DBD, although it abrogates full-length p53 DNA binding. To study the mutational effect on the transcriptional outcome in the cellular context, ChIP-qPCR for various p53 responsive genes (CDKN1A, BAX, DRAM1, and BBC3) was performed in the H1299 doxycycline-inducible WT and P152Lp53 cell line (Fig. S2a) to assess the enrichment of P152Lp53 on several p53 promoter sequences. Consistent with the in vitro data, a significant decrease in promoter binding was observed for P152Lp53 as against wtp53 (Fig. 2c). In addition, a luciferase assay was performed using transient transfection and expression of WT and P152Lp53 in the H1299 (p53−/−) cell line. The p53 expressing vectors (either mutant or WT) were co-transfected with reporter vector containing p53 responsive elements. Upon transfection of expression vectors, P152Lp53 showed very minimal promoter activation as compared with WT (Fig. S2b). The protein expression was confirmed by Western blotting (Fig. S2c). This observation is consistent with the result obtained in a similar assay (32Wasserman J.D. Novokmet A. Eichler-Jonsson C. Ribeiro R.C. Rodriguez-Galindo C. Zambetti G.P. Malkin D. Prevalence and functional consequence of TP53 mutations in pediatric adrenocortical carcinoma: a children's oncology group study.J. Clin. Oncol. 2015; 33 (25584008): 602-60910.1200/JCO.2013.52.6863Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar) where a significant reduction of TP53 function was observed upon P152L mutation. Functionally p53 binds to the cognate DNA site as a tetramer (2Friedman P.N. Chen X. Bargonetti J. Prives C. The p53 protein is an unusually shaped tetramer that binds directly to DNA.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1993; 90 (8475074): 3319-332310.1073/pnas.90.8.3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar, 33Stenger J.E. Mayr G.A. Mann K. Tegtmeyer P.

Several of the mutations in the oligomerization domain of p53, such as L344P or L330H, abolish its ability to tetramerize and hence these mutants exist as monomers and do not bind to DNA. Although a few exceptions do exist: for example, L344A and R337C mutants, which retain the ability to form dimer and tetramer, and hence either show partial or no loss of DNA-binding ability, respectively (Table 1, top). Intriguingly, there are studies where it has been reported that few conformational mutants (V143A, G245S), which have their DNA-binding ability abrogated, still form tetramers upon glutaraldehyde treatment (Table 1, top). To examine the impact of the P152L mutation on its tetramer formation ability, we performed glutaraldehyde cross-linking followed by Western blotting where we observed that P152Lp53 retains the ability to form a tetramer (Fig. 2d, fourth lane). The tetramerization mutant (L344P), as expected, did not show any tetramer formation, rather a dimer was observed. The glutaraldehyde percentage (0.005%) used was standardized as the minimum concentration required to form a tetramer of WT p53.Table 1The DNA binding and oligomerization status of p53 mutants (information retrieved from TP53 mutant database (http://p53.fr/TP53Mutload/database_access/search.php), and the DNA binding property of full-length and DBD of p53 mutantsp53 mutantsBinding and oligomerization statusClassDNA bindingOligomerization statusV143AConformational− −TetramerG245SConformational− −TetramerL344PTetramerization mutant− −MonomerL344ATetramerization mutantPartialDimerL330HTetramerization mutant− −MonomerR337CTetramerization mutant+ +Tetramerp53 mutantsDNA-binding propertyClassDBD-DNA bindingFull length DNA bindingR248WDNA Contact− −aSee Ref. 50.− −bSee Ref. 51.R248QDNA Contact− −aSee Ref. 50.− −bSee Ref. 51.R249SConformational− −aSee Ref. 50.− −cSee Ref. 52.H115NConformational+ +aSee Ref. 50.+ +dSee Ref. 53.V143AConformational+ +eSee Ref. 17.− −fSee Ref. 54.a See Ref. 50Merabet A.

Open table in a new tab The observation that the P152Lp53 tetramer is devoid of DNA-binding property, whereas the DBD retains significant sequence-specific DNA-binding ability, indicates altered subunit-subunit association. The mutant protein may also be aggregated or inherently unstable. To better understand the effect of the mutation on the protein structure, we first measured the hydrodynamic radii of the WT and mutant p53 by dynamic light scattering. Fig. S2d shows the dynamic light scattering profile of the WT and P152Lp53. The measured hydrodynamic radii are 35.5 and 40.9 Å, respectively, for the WT and P152Lp53. The measured radii suggest that neither of the proteins is aggregated to any significant extent and the P152Lp53 protein is modestly enlarged. This is consistent with the idea that the subunits are arranged in a different mode in the mutant protein. GuHCl (guanidine hydrochloride) denaturation of the WT and mutant tetramers was performed to measure the stability of the proteins. Fig. 2e shows the GuHCl-induced equilibrium denaturation profile of the WT and P152Lp53 as measured by increased solvent exposure of tryptophan residues (F340/F350) as a function of GuHCl. The fitted curve is a two-state equation as described in Ref. 34Mandal A.K. Samaddar S. Banerjee R. Lahiri S. Bhattacharyya A. Roy S.

The fluorescence emission spectra of the mutant are modestly red-shifted compared with that of the WT (reflected in the lower F340/F350 value of the mutant). The midpoints of the transition of the WT and mutant protein are around 1.1 m GuHCl, indicating the stability is not impacted by the mutation in a major way. The change of exposure recorded here most likely reflects the unfolding of the proteins as CD spectra recorded at 3 m GuHCl is devoid of any protein-like bands (data not shown). To delineate whether P152Lp53 manifests any gain-of-function properties, we generated a stable cell line expressing P152Lp53 in H1299 (p53−/−) cells. The expression of the mutant protein was confirmed by Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence showed that P152Lp53 localizes in the nucleus as that of WT p53 (Fig. S3, a and b). To ascertain whether expression of mutant p53 alters the migration potential of H1299 stable cell lines, a wound-healing assay was performed. We observed that H1299 cells expressing P152Lp53 migrated faster as compared with the vector control cell line (Fig. 3a, Fig. S3c). Furthermore, we also tested the proliferation ability of P152Lp53 expressing cells through a colony formation assay in which the number of colonies obtained determines the proliferativ"
https://openalex.org/W2965119254,"This study aimed to investigate the function of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes in grass carp treated with emodin combined with diazinon (DZN) exposure. The transcription levels of five ABC transporter genes in different tissues of grass carp and at different time points were measured by real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR). The analysis of different tissues showed higher ABCB1 expression in the skin (26-fold) and gill (2-fold) than in the liver. In addition, ABCB11 expression was higher in the skin (109-fold) and gill (57-fold) than in the liver, ABCC1 was more highly expressed in the gill (50-fold) than in the liver, and ABCG2 was expressed at higher levels in the skin (659-fold, p < 0.01), gill (628-fold, p < 0.01) and liver (659-fold, p < 0.01) than in brain tissue. The analysis of different time points revealed that the ABCB1, ABCB11, ABCC1, ABCC2 and ABCG2 genes were highly expressed at 24 h in the liver in the experimental group. However, analysis of the intestinal tissue of the experimental group showed that the expression of ABCB1 and ABCB11 peaked at 6 h, the expression of ABCC1 and ABCC2 peaked at 5 d, and the expression of ABCG2 peaked at 3 d. Furthermore, the emodin concentrations in the liver and intestine reached their peak levels (50.18 and 117.24 μg·ml-1, respectively) after 48 and 1 h of treatment with emodin combined with DZN, respectively. The peak DZN concentrations in the liver (1.42 ng·ml-1) and intestine (0.2 ng·ml-1) were detected 3 and 6 h after emodin treatment combined with DZN, respectively. In conclusion, this study shows that the transcript levels of ABC transporters respond to the presence of emodin, which indicates their potential involvement in and contribution with the metabolic process in grass carp."

The secondary aim was to assess the change in pDDIs for patients between admission and discharge. Material and methods This multicentre study applied a cross-sectional design and was conducted in six Brazilian hospitals, from October 2016 to July 2018. Data from patients with NPFT were collected through electronic forms. All regular medications prescribed were recorded. Medications were classified according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical code. Drug-drug interaction screening software was used to screen patients’ medications for pDDIs. Negative binomial regression was used to account for the over dispersed nature of the pDDI count. Since the number of pDDIs was closely related to the number of prescribed medications, we modelled the rate of pDDIs with the count of pDDIs as the numerator and the number of prescribed medications as the denominator; six variables were considered for inclusion: time (admission or discharge), patient age, patient gender, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score, type of prescription (electronic or handwritten) and patient care complexity. To account for correlation within the two time points (admission and discharge) for each patient a generalised estimating equations approach was used to adjust the standard error estimates. To test the change in pDDI rate between admission and discharge a full model of six variables was fitted to generate an adjusted estimate. Results In this study, 327 patients were included. At least one pDDI was found in more than 91% of patients on admission and discharge and most of these pDDIs were classified as major severity. Three factors were significantly associated with the rate of pDDIs per medication: patient age, patient care complexity and prescription type (handwritten vs electronic). There was no evidence of a difference in pDDI rate between admission and discharge. Conclusion Patients with a NPFT are at high risk of pDDIs. Drug interaction screening tools and computerized clinical decision support systems could be effective risk mitigation strategies for this patient group."

In March 2011, the supporting international non-governmental organization transitioned management of the program to the Machinga District Health Office (DHO). We evaluated maternal and HIV service use before and after program transition to the DHO.We compared pre- and post-transition periods by examining data recorded in ANC and maternal registries in 15 healthcare facilities (HCFs) by proportion z-tests. We classified HCFs by size, using the median monthly patient volumes as the split for large or small facilities. We used logistic regression to evaluate changes in the use of ANC, maternal, and HIV services and their interactions with HCF size.The percentage of women attending their first ANC visit during the first trimester was similar in the pre-and post-transition periods (9.3% vs 10.2%). Although the percentage of women with ≥4 ANC visits was similar from pre- to post-transition (26.0% vs 24.8%), the odds increased among women in small facilities (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.24-1.51), and decreased among women in large facilities (OR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.75-0.85). Although a similar percentages of pregnant women were diagnosed with HIV in all HCFs in the pre- and post-transitions periods (6.4% vs 4.8%), a substantially larger proportion of women were not tested for HIV in large HCFs (OR: 6.34, 95% CI: 5.88-6.84). A larger proportion of women gave birth at both small (OR: 1.30, 95% CI: 1.16-1.45) and large HCFs (OR: 1.55, 95% CI: 1.43-1.67) in the post-transition vs. the pre-transition period.The evaluation results suggest that many positive aspects of this donor-supported program continued following transition of program management from a non-governmental organization to a DHO."
