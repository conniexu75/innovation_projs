https://openalex.org/W2056145463,"Mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake is crucial for the regulation of the rate of oxidative phosphorylation1, the modulation of spatio-temporal cytosolic Ca2+ signals2,3,4 and apoptosis5. Although the phenomenon of mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration, its characteristics and physiological consequences have been convincingly reported6,7, the actual protein(s) involved in this process are unknown. Here, we show that the uncoupling proteins 2 and 3 (UCP2 and UCP3) are essential for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake. Using overexpression, knockdown (small interfering RNA) and mutagenesis experiments, we demonstrate that UCP2 and UCP3 are elementary for mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration in response to cell stimulation under physiological conditions — observations supported by isolated liver mitochondria of Ucp2−/− mice lacking ruthenium red-sensitive Ca2+ uptake. Our results reveal a novel molecular function for UCP2 and UCP3, and may provide the molecular mechanism for their reported effects8,9,10. Moreover, the identification of proteins fundemental for mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake expands our knowledge of the physiological role for mitochondrial Ca2+ sequestration."

IL-17F is a disulfide-linked dimer that contains a cysteine-knot motif. We hypothesized that IL-17F and IL-17A could form a heterodimer due to their sequence homology and overlapping pattern of expression. We evaluated the structure of recombinant IL-17F and IL-17A proteins, as well as that of natural IL-17F and IL-17A derived from activated human CD4+ T cells, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunoprecipitation followed by Western blotting, and mass spectrometry. We find that both IL-17F and IL-17A can form both homodimeric and heterodimeric proteins when expressed in a recombinant system, and that all forms of the recombinant proteins have in vitro functional activity. Furthermore, we find that in addition to the homodimers of IL-17F and IL-17A, activated human CD4+ T cells also produce the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer. These data suggest that the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer may contribute to the T cell-mediated immune responses. IL-17F and IL-17A are members of the IL-17 pro-inflammatory cytokine family.

Med. 1996; 183: 2593-2603Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar), although crystal structure or data defining the precise subunit interactions are lacking. The IL-17F homodimer includes a classical cysteine knot motif, which is found in the TGF-β, bone morphogenetic protein, and nerve growth factor superfamilies (25McDonald N.Q. Lapatto R.

One difference in the cysteine knot motif of IL-17F compared with the other known cysteine knot protein families is that it only utilizes four cysteines instead of the classical six cysteines to form the knot.There have been reports that some of the cysteine knot family members can exist as heterodimers in vivo. TGF-β1.2 and -β2.3 were identified in bovine bone extracts, whereas inhibin and activin AB have been found in gonadal fluids (27Ogawa Y. Schmidt D.K. Dasch J.R. Chang R.J. Glaser C.B. J. Biol.

In addition, there are other cytokines that are expressed as heterodimers, such as IL-12, which is composed of two protein subunits p35:p40 (30Kobayashi M. Fitz L. Ryan M. Hewick R.M. Clark S.C.

More importantly, we show for the first time that activated human CD4+ T cells produce the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer along with the corresponding homodimers.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCloning of IL-17 Proteins—Full-length IL-17F and IL-17A genes were cloned from phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and the ionomycin-activated human peripheral blood mononclear cell library and used as templates for the following constructs. The amino-terminal FLAG™-tagged IL-17A construct was made by sequential overlapping PCR amplifications using a honeybee signal sequence, followed by a GSP spacer, and a FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) joined to the mature region of IL-17A (residues 20–156). The amino-terminal streptavidin- and FLAG-tagged IL-17A construct consists of a honeybee signal sequence, a GSP spacer, the streptavidin tag (WSHPQFEK), a GSG spacer, and the FLAG tag (DYKDDDDK) joined to the mature region of IL-17A (residues 20–156). The amino-terminal His-tagged IL-17F construct consists of a honeybee leader, a GSG spacer, a His tag, and an EK cleavage site (GDDDDK) fused to mature IL-17F (residues 31–164). The amino-terminal protein C (HPC)-tagged IL-17F constructs consist of a honeybee leader, a GSG spacer, a HPC (EDQVDPRLIDGK) tag, an GSG spacer, a His tag followed by an EK cleavage site and fused to mature IL-17F (residues 31–164). All constructs utilized a cytomegalovirus promoter driven expression vector and were verified by DNA sequencing.Expression of IL-17 Proteins—Proteins were expressed by transient transfection (TransIT-LT1, Mirus) of HEK293 cells (for purification) or COS-1 cells (for immunoprecipitation). Heterodimers were produced by co-transfection of IL-17F and IL-17A on separate plasmids using equal amounts of DNA. Twenty-four hours post-transfection, medium containing the DNA/liposome mixture was removed and replaced with serum-free medium. The conditioned medium was harvested 48 h later and protein production was evaluated by Western analysis.Purification of IL-17 Proteins—Chinese hamster ovary conditioned medium containing the His-tagged IL-17F homodimer was passed over a nickel-NTA Fast Flow column (Qiagen). The column was washed with 17.5 mm imidazole and eluted with 250 mm imidazole. The eluted protein was dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.2), and then digested with enterokinase at a 1500:1 ratio of protein to enterokinase for 4 h at room temperature. The digested protein was re-applied to nickel-NTA and washed with 10 mm imidazole. The cleaved IL-17F was eluted with 40 mm imidazole. HEK293 conditioned medium containing the streptavidin-FLAG-tagged IL-17A homodimer was flowed over a Strep-Tactin column (IBA), then washed with Tris-buffered saline and eluted with 3 mm desthiobiotin. HPC His-tagged IL-17F/FLAG-tagged IL-17A heterodimer was purified by batch binding the co-transfected HEK293-conditioned medium to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity resin (Sigma). The IL-17A homodimer and IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer were eluted with 200 μg/ml of FLAG peptide (Sigma). The protein was then batch bound to an anti-protein C affinity matrix (Roche) and the heterodimer was eluted with 5 mm EDTA. All of the purified proteins were dialyzed against PBS (pH 7.2), and characterized by SDS-PAGE gel, Western analysis, mass spectrometry, and analytical SEC.ELISA Quantitation of IL-17 in Conditioned Medium—The IL-17A homodimer concentration was determined by capturing with plate-bound anti-huIL-17A antibody (4 μg/ml of clone 41809; R&D Systems) followed by detection with the same antibody (0.5 μg/ml) and poly-streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1/10,000; Pierce). Recombinant human IL-17A homodimer (Wyeth Research) was used as a standard. Due to the antibody selection based on specificity, the IL-17A ELISA sensitivity is 2.5 ng/ml. The concentration of IL-17F homodimer was determined by capturing with plate-bound anti-huIL-17F-07 (2 μg/ml; Wyeth Research) followed by detection with biotinylated anti-huIL-17F-07 (0.5 μg/ml) and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1/10,000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), using recombinant human IL-17F as a standard (Wyeth Research). IL-17F/A heterodimer concentration was determined by capturing with plate-bound anti-huIL-17F-01 (2 μg/ml; Wyeth Research) followed by goat anti-huIL-17A biotin (75 ng/ml; R&D Systems) and streptavidin horseradish peroxidase (1/10,000; Zymed Laboratories Inc.), using recombinant human IL-17 F/A heterodimer (Wyeth Research) as a standard.Immunoprecipitation of IL-17 for Western Blot—COS conditioned medium (50 μl) was mixed with 20 μg/ml murine anti-huIL-17A-02 (Wyeth Research) or murine anti-huIL-17F-01 (Wyeth Research) monoclonal antibodies for 1 h at 4°C under gentle rotation. Antibody complexes were captured with 50 μl of hydrated Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C under gentle rotation. The beads were then sequentially washed with PBS + 1% Tween 20, PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, and PBS + 0.05% Tween 20. The immunoprecipitated pellets were resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer and loaded onto a 10% Tricine gel for Western blot analysis using either goat anti-huIL-17A (R&D Systems) or rabbit anti-huIL-17F antibodies (Wyeth Research) for detection.BEAS-2B in Vitro Assay of IL-17 Proteins—BEAS-2B, human bronchial epithelial cells (ATCC, CRL-9609), were maintained in HITES medium (ATCC formulation) supplemented with 2% fetal calf serum and 100 units/ml penicillin + 100 μg/ml streptomycin. Cells were released from the culture flasks using trypsin/EDTA and seeded at 2 × 104 cells/well into 96-well microtiter plates in which cytokines (streptavidin FLAG IL-17A, IL-17F, and HPC His IL-17F/FLAG IL-17A) pre-diluted in culture medium. Cells were incubated at 37 °C for 24 h; supernatants were then removed and analyzed for GRO-α by ELISA (R&D Systems matched antibody pairs).In Vitro T Cell Activation for Immunoprecipitation followed by Western Blot—Human CD4+ T cells from peripheral blood lymphocytes were purified using RosetteSep® (StemCell Technologies Inc). The cells were stimulated for 48 h with anti-CD3 microspheres (5 μg/107 microspheres) at a ratio of 1:1, and soluble anti-CD28 at 5 μg/ml. After this primary activation, the microspheres were removed and the cells were washed, resuspended in fresh medium, and rested overnight. The rested cells underwent a secondary stimulation with the same amounts of anti-CD3 microspheres and soluble anti-CD28 in addition to 60 ng/ml huIL-21 (R&D Systems). The supernatant was harvested at 72 h.Immunoprecipitation of IL-17 from Activated CD4+ T Cells—Activated T cell medium (500 μl) was mixed with 15 μg/ml murine anti-huIL-17A-02 (Wyeth Research) or murine anti-huIL-17F-01 (Wyeth Research) monoclonal antibodies and treated as described above for the immunoprecipitation of COS conditioned medium. The immunoprecipitated pellets were resuspended in non-reducing sample buffer and loaded onto a 10% Tricine gel for Western blot analysis using a rabbit anti-huIL-17F antibody for detection (Wyeth Research).In Vitro T Cell Activation for ELISA and Mass Spectrometry—Human CD4+ T cells were purified as described above. Tosyl-activated magnetic microspheres (Dynal Biotech) were coated with anti-CD3 antibody (clone UCHT-1, 1 μg/107 microspheres) and anti-CD28 (clone CD28.2, 0.5 μg/107 microspheres). Human IgG was used to saturate the binding capacity of the microspheres (total protein = 5 μg/107 microspheres). Protein-coated microspheres were added to purified CD4+ T cells (1 × 106 cells/ml) at a ratio of 1:1. Additionally, 10 ng/ml IL-23, 1 ng/ml TGF-β, 20 ng/ml IL-6, 10 ng/ml TNF-α, 10 ng/ml IL-1β,10 μg/ml anti-IL-4, and 1 μg/ml anti-interferon γ were added to the culture. Supernatants (90 ml at 2 × 106 cells/ml) were harvested at 72 h and the concentrations of homodimeric and heterodimeric IL-17F and IL-17A were measured by ELISA.Mass Spectrometry of IL-17 from Activated CD4+ T Cells and COS CM—70 ml of activated human T cell medium was mixed with 15 μg/ml murine anti-IL-17A-02 (Wyeth Research) and 20 μg/ml murine anti-huIL-17F-01 (Wyeth Research) antibodies for 1 h at 4°C under gentle rotation. Antibody complexes were captured with 175 μl of hydrated Protein A-Sepharose (Amersham Biosciences) overnight at 4 °C under gentle rotation. The immunoprecipitated pellets were then sequentially washed with PBS + 1% Tween 20, PBS + 0.1% Tween 20, and PBS + 0.05% Tween 20. The immunoprecipitated proteins from activated T cells or purified recombinant proteins (1–2 μg) were eluted from the pellets using SDS sample buffer and then loaded onto a 10–20% Tricine gel (Invitrogen). The proteins were stained with Imperial™ Protein Stain Solution (Pierce). The positively stained gel bands were excised and further cut into about 1 × 1-mm2 pieces. To remove the stain, the gel pieces were dehydrated in acetonitrile (ACN), rehydrated, and washed in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0), and dehydrated again in ACN. Proteins were digested by immersing the gel pieces in a solution containing 0.5 μg of trypsin in 25 mm sodium phosphate (pH 6.0) at 37 °C for 4 h. The resultant peptides were extracted from the gel using 60% ACN + 1% formic acid (FA) and 90% ACN + 5% FA, successively. All eluted fractions were then combined for each sample, concentrated to near dryness by vacuum and reconstituted again in ∼20 μl of 2% ACN and 0.1% FA prior to mass spectrometric analysis.Mass spectrometric analysis was performed on an Agilent 1100 nanoflow system connected to a linear ion trap mass spectrometer (LTQ, ThermoFinnigan). The digested samples were pressure-loaded onto a C18 PicoFrit microcapillary column (New Objective) packed with Magic C18 beads (5 μm, 75 μm × 11 cm, Michrom BioResources) and desalted on-line with solvent A (2% ACN and 0.1% FA) prior to mass spectrometric analyses. The peptides were eluted with a gradient from 4 to 60% solvent B (90% ACN and 0.1% FA) over 70 min with a flow rate of 250 nl/min. The fragment ion spectra (MS/MS spectra) were acquired in a data-dependent manner in which each MS scan was followed by consecutive MS/MS scans on the first three most intense ions from the MS scan. To gain additional sensitivity, the ions with m/z values corresponding to the hypothesized disulfide-bonded peptides were specifically targeted using selected ion monitoring (m/z window 10 Da). The fragment ion spectra of all disulfide-linked peptides were manually interpreted based on the IL-17F and IL-17A protein sequences. To further confirm the presence of the disulfide linkages, part of the immunopurified IL-17 proteins were also reduced with 100 mm dithiothreitol for 1 h at 37°C and then alkylated using 113 mm iodoacetamide in 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.5) for 30 min at room temperature in the dark, prior to in-gel tryptic digestion and subsequent mass spectrometric analysis.RESULTSPlasmids containing either IL-17F or IL-17A cDNA or both were transfected into COS cells. Cytokine expression in the conditioned medium was determined by ELISA analysis, using capture and detection antibodies that were specific for either IL-17F or IL-17A or IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer (see supplementary data). As shown in Fig. 1, the IL-17F or IL-17A homodimer could be detected in the conditioned medium following transfection with either cDNA using antibodies specific for either cytokine (A/A; F/F). Co-transfection of both plasmids resulted in the secretion of both IL-17F and IL-17A homodimers (A/A; F/F), as well as a protein that could be captured using an anti-huIL-17F antibody and detected with the anti-huIL-17A antibody (F/A) or the reciprocal capture and detection pair (A/F), consistent with an IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer.The transfected COS cell-conditioned medium was further characterized by immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. When an anti-huIL-17A-specific antibody was used for both immunoprecipitation and Western detection on medium from COS cells transfected with only IL-17A, two bands are detected that migrate between 25 and 37 kDa that are consistent with the glycosylated forms of the IL-17A homodimer (Fig. 2A, lane 3) (32Hurst S.D. Muchamuel T. Gorman D.M. Gilbert J.M. Clifford T. Kwan S. Menon S. Seymour B. Jackson C. Kung T.T. Brieland J.K. Zurawski S.M. Chapman R.W. Zurawski G. Coffman R.L. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 443-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (526) Google Scholar). These bands are not seen using this antibody on conditioned medium from COS cells expressing only IL-17F (Fig. 2A, lane 2). The bands detected above the 50-kDa molecular mass marker are the heavy and light chains of the antibodies used in the immunoprecipitation. When an anti-huIL-17F specific antibody was used for both the immunoprecipitation step and Western detection on medium from COS cells transfected with only IL-17F, two bands are detected that migrate at or just above 37 kDa that are consistent with the glycosylated forms of the IL-17F homodimer (Fig. 2B, lane 3). These bands are not seen using this antibody on conditioned medium from COS cells expressing only IL-17A (Fig. 2B, lane 2).FIGURE 2Immunoprecipitation of transiently transfected COS CM with IL-17F cDNA, IL-17A cDNA, or both cDNAs followed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis.

The upper band is the IL-17F homodimer (due to the cross-reactivity of the detection antibody with IL-17F at high protein concentrations in Western blots, data not shown) and the lower band is the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer. When immunoprecipitation was carried out using an anti-huIL-17A specific antibody and an anti-huIL-17F antibody was used for Western detection, a band corresponding to the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer was only seen in the co-transfected conditioned medium, and not in the singly transfected medium (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–7).Identification of the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer and corresponding homodimers was confirmed by mass spectrometric analyses of the purified recombinant proteins. The purified IL-17F or IL-17A homodimers and heterodimer were first digested with trypsin after separation on SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions. The resulting peptides were then analyzed by nano-liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-LC-MS/MS) to determine the exact interprotein disulfide linkages. A number of the disulfide-linked peptides were identified based on their parent masses (Table 1) and their sequences were confirmed by their corresponding fragment ion spectra. For example, a peptide with m/z at 1196.9 (3+) corresponds to an inter-protein disulfide-linked peptide from the IL-17F homodimer, with Cys17 from one of the IL-17F molecules covalently linked to Cys107 from the other IL-17F molecule (Table 1). This linkage is consistent with the findings from the crystal structure of the IL-17F homodimer (23Hymowitz S.G. Filvaroff E.H. Yin J.P. Lee J. Cai L. Risser P. Maruoka M. Mao W. Foster J. Kelley R.F. Pan G. Gurney A.L. de Vos A.M. Starovasnik M.A. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5332-5341Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). A similar disulfide-linked peptide for the IL-17A homodimer was also positively identified. The fragment ion spectrum of this peptide is shown in Fig. 3, in which the sequence ions (b and y ions) clearly indicate an inter-protein disulfide bond between residues Cys10 and Cys106. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the inter-protein disulfide-linked peptides within IL-17A.TABLE 1Mass spectrometric analysis of disulfide-linked peptides from the recombinant cytokinesStructureTheoretical molecular weightm/z calculated [M + 3H]3+m/z observed [M + 3H]3+ recombinantIL-17ANPGCPNSEDKNFPR EPPHCPNSFR2754.2919.1919.6IL-17FA-1VGHTFFQKPESCPPVPGGSMK EPPHCPNSFR3409.61137.51138.1IL-17FA-2NPGCPNSEDK HQGCSVSFQLEK2419.1807.4807.9IL-17FVGHTFFQKPESCPPVPGGSMK HQGCSVSFQLEK3588.71197.21196.9 Open table in a new tab FIGURE 3Fragment ion spectrum of an interdimer disulfide-linked peptide resulting from tryptic digestion of non-reduced recombinant IL-17A homodimer.

Mass spectrometric analysis identified that the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer contains two inter-protein disulfide-linked peptides, each with one peptide from IL-17F and the other from IL-17A. These peptides were identified based on their molecular masses (Table 1) and fragment ion spectra (data not shown). This clearly confirms that COS cells are capable of expressing an IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer. In addition, the positions of the disulfide linkages (Cys17(F)-Cys106(A) and Cys107(F)-Cys10(A)) from the heterodimer resemble those inter-protein disulfides within IL-17F or IL-17A homodimers, which are involved in the cysteine knot formation. This indicates that the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer has a very similar head-to-toe configuration like its corresponding homodimers.The activity of purified IL-17F, IL-17A, and the IL-17F/IL-17A heterodimer was evaluated using a cell-based assay. It has been shown that IL-17F induces the secretion of IL-8 and the granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor in the BEAS-2B human bronchial epithelial cell line (17Kawaguchi M. Takahashi D.

In mammals, A1 forms its own subfamily and is distinguished from other TRP channels by the presence of ∼14 ankyrin repeats in its N terminus (1Clapham D.E. Nature. 2003; 426: 517-524Crossref PubMed Scopus (2164) Google Scholar). TRPA1 was initially described as a cold sensitive nonselective cation channel (2Story G.M. Peier A.M. Reeve A.J. Eid S.R.

A model suggests TRPA1 activation by bradykinin, a potent algogenic substance released due to tissue injury and inflammation, in two possible ways: through PLC-mediated increases in intracellular Ca2+ or other metabolites (e.g. diacylglycerol) and via Ca2+ influx through TRPV1 (9Bautista D.M. Jordt S.E. Nikai T. Tsuruda P.R. Read A.J. Poblete J. Yamoah E.N. Basbaum A.I. Julius D. Cell. 2006; 124: 1269-1282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1498) Google Scholar). Whether an increase in intracellular Ca2+ is sufficient to activate TRPA1 is still debated (4Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M. Hogestatt E.D. Meng I.D. Julius D.

It was shown that extracellular Ca2+ enhances the current rate and magnitude of AITC-induced currents (4Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M. Hogestatt E.D. Meng I.D. Julius D. Nature. 2004; 427: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 10Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Ca2+ is thought to be responsible for fast channel closure (10Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). In addition, single channel recordings of heterologously expressed TRPA1 revealed an AITC-induced conductance, which is reduced in the presence of Ca2+ (10Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Together these reports emphasize the importance of Ca2+ for TRPA1 function. Very recently the existence of a putative EF-hand calcium-binding domain (EF-hand CBD) at the N terminus of TRPA1 was reported (11Hinman A. Chuang H.H. Bautista D.M. Julius D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 19564-19568Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar). The EF-hand CBD is the most common motif among Ca2+-binding sites of a large number of Ca2+-interacting proteins (12Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The classical EF-hand is a helix-loop-helix motif that coordinates the Ca2+ ion in a pentagonal pyramidal configuration. The domain consists usually of 12 residues, whereas six residues in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 are postulated to be involved in Ca2+-binding (12Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). In this study we set out to clarify the role of Ca2+ on TRPA1 channel activation by studying human TRPA1 transiently expressed in HEK293 cells. Consistent with previous studies on AITC, our results show that Ca2+ potentiates the cinnamaldehyde- and carvacrol-induced responses. In addition, we determine Ca2+ as essential co-agonist for icilin activity on TRPA1. Interestingly, Ca2+ also directly activates TRPA1 (EC50 of 905 nm) in whole-cell and excised inside-out patch recordings. The mechanism underlying Ca2+-dependent activation is analyzed using pharmacological approaches and mutagenesis studies, thereby identifying the EF-hand CBD as potential Ca2+-binding site. Cells Culture—Human embryonic kidney 293 and 293T cells (HEK293) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm l-glutamine, 100 μg/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) at 37 °C in a humidity controlled incubator with 5% CO2. Transient Expression of Human TRPA1 and Mutagenesis—For transient expression of human TRPA1 (hTRPA1) we used a recombinant expression plasmid (pcDNA5-FRT) carrying the entire protein coding region for hTRPA1. The plasmid was kindly provided by H.-J. Behrendt. Semiconfluent HEK293 cells were transiently transfected (2 μg of hTRPA1 cDNA per dish) in 35-mm dishes (Flacon, BD Bioscience, Heidelberg, Germany) using the CaP-precipitation method as described previously (13Zufall F. Hatt H. Firestein S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 9335-9339Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Co-transfected pIRES-EGFP (0.2 μg per dish) served as transfection marker. All recordings were performed at room temperature ∼24–48 h after transfection. Untransfected cells were used for control recordings. For point mutations to the putative TRPA1 EF-hand CBD we followed established protocols. Briefly, overlap extension PCR (14Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar) was used to perform site-directed mutagenesis of the EF-hand domain. The six residues reported to be involved in binding of the Ca2+ ion are in positions 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 12 (12Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). We exchanged the amino acids in these positions to alanine to induce the loss of Ca2+-binding capability (D468A, S470A, T472A, L474A, N476A, D479A). The primer pairs used for mutations were as follows: external primers, CTGATGATATCGTCCTATTCTGGTAGCG (forward) and GCATCATGCTGAAGGTCTGGATTATAGA (reverse); pos 1 (D468A), GAGGCTCCTACAAGCCATAAGTGA (forward) and CTCGTATCACTTATGGCTTGTAGGAGC (reverse); pos 3 (S470A), CTACAAGACATAGCTGATACGAGG (forward) and AAGCCTCGTATCAGCTATGTCTTGTAG (reverse); pos 5 (T472A), ATAAGTGATGCGAGGCTTCTGAATG (forward) and CTTCATTCAGAAGCCTCGCATCACTTATG (reverse); pos 7 (L474A), GATACGAGGGCTCTGAATGAAGGTGAC (forward) and AGGTCACCTTCATTCAGAGCCCTCGTATC (reverse); pos 9 (N476A), AGGCTTCTGGCTGAAGGTGACCTTCA (forward) and CATGAAGGTCACCTTCAGCCAGAAGCCTCG (reverse); pos 12 (D479A), GAATGAAGGTGCACTTCATGGAATG (forward) and GTCATTCCATGAAGTGCACCTTCATTC (reverse). The different PCR products carrying the corresponding mutation were cloned into the HpaI/BamHI sites of hTRPA1. The nucleotide sequence of the mutants was verified by sequencing the corresponding cDNA. Solutions—For electrophysiological measurements all solutions were adjusted to pH 7.3. The experimental solutions contained the following (in mm) for whole-cell experiments: standard extracellular solution, 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2; Ca2+-free solution, 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 5 EGTA; standard intracellular solution, 140 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.1 CaCl2, 5 EGTA, 10 HEPES. For ramp protocols KCl was replaced by CsCl. For whole-cell recordings of Ca2+-activated currents, CaCl2 was added either to the standard extracellular solution resulting in a concentration of 10 mm CaCl2 or to the standard intracellular solution resulting in a concentration of 5 mm CaCl2. The intracellular solution for the Ca2+ dose-response curve contained 140 KCl, 10 HEPES, 1 MgCl2, 10 EGTA. Ca2+ was added as follows: 4.918 mm CaCl2 for 100 nm free Ca2+, 7.421 mm CaCl2 for 300 nm free Ca2+, 9.05 mm CaCl2 for 1 μm free Ca2+, 9.663 mm CaCl2 for 3 μm free Ca2+, 9.906 mm CaCl2 for 10 μm free Ca2+, 9.995 mm CaCl2 for 30 μm free Ca2+. The free Ca2+ concentration was calculated by the software WCabuf (G. Droogmans, Leuven, Belgium). The influence of Ca2+ on icilin-induced currents was studied by adding 5 mm BAPTA to the standard intracellular solution or increasing the extracellular Ca2+ concentration to 5 mm CaCl2. For excised-patch recordings pipette and bath solutions were symmetric (in mm): 140 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 2 EGTA. Solutions with nano- or micromolar concentrations of free Ca2+ were obtained by adding CaCl2 to this EGTA-based buffer as follows: 1.012 mm CaCl2 for 100 nm free Ca2+, 1.509 mm CaCl2 for 300 nm free Ca2+, 1.823 mm CaCl2 for 1 μm free Ca2+ and 1.940 mm CaCl2 for 3 μm free Ca2+. Chemicals were prepared as concentrated stock solutions in either distilled water or Me2SO and diluted to the final concentration using standard extracellular solution or standard pipette solution as indicated in the text. AITC, carvacrol, icilin, and BAPTA were obtained from Sigma; ruthenium red (RR), U73122, and calmidazolium (CMZ) were purchased from Calbiochem; CALP2 was obtained from Tocris bioscience; and cinnamaldehyde was from Henkel. Electrophysiological Recordings—All recordings were performed with an EPC7 amplifier (List-Medical Electronic, Darmstadt, Germany). Data were acquired using Pulse software (HEKA, Lambrecht, Germany). Excised patches were sampled at 2 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass (GC150TF-10, Harvard Apparatus Ltd.) and fire polished to 3–5 mΩ tip resistance using a horizontal pipette puller (Zeitz Instruments, Munich, Germany). Solution exchange was achieved by placing cells in front of a theta-capillary and moving manually from one side of the outlet to the other. Excised patches were placed in front of a microperfusion pipette and solution exchange was achieved by switching from one solution to another under computer control. Data Analysis—Electrophysiological data were analyzed using the software Pulse (HEKA), IgorPro (Wavemetrics), SigmaPlot (SPSS Science), OriginPro (Origin Lab Corp.), TAC (Bruxton), and Microsoft Excel. Significance was tested using Student’s independent t test (p < 0.05 is marked by an asterisk). The dose-response curve was fitted with a Hill equation of the form y = base + (max-base)/[1 + (xhalf/x)n]. Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Western Blotting—HEK293 cells were transfected with equal amounts of cDNA for wild-type TRPA1 and EF-hand mutants. Whole cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection, mixed with Laemmli buffer (30% glycerol, 3% SDS, 125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8) and heated at 95 °C for 5 min. Equal amounts of protein were loaded and resolved by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Protran; Schleicher & Schuell). The nitrocellulose membranes were stained with Ponceau S (Sigma) and blocked with TBST (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris-HCl, Tween 20, pH 7.4) containing 2% ECL Advance Blocking Agent (Amersham Biosciences). TRPA1 was detected using two reported antibodies directed either against the C terminus of mouse TRPA1 (1:500) or the N terminus of mouse TRPA1 (1:1000) (10Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G.

The primary antibodies were diluted in 2% ECL Advance Blocking Agent in TBST. After washing and incubation with horseradish peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody, detection was performed with ECL Advance (Amersham Biosciences) on Hyperfilm ECL (Amersham Biosciences). Icilin Requires Ca2+ for Its Agonist Efficacy—Ca2+ is known to modulate agonist-induced responses of various TRP channels (16Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 17Strotmann R. Schultz G. Plant T.D. J. Biol.

Cell Calcium. 2003; 33: 489-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Voltage-clamp recordings from TRPA1-expressing Xenopus oocytes or HEK293 cells have shown that AITC-induced responses are potentiated by external Ca2+ ions (4Jordt S.E. Bautista D.M. Chuang H.H. McKemy D.D. Zygmunt P.M. Hogestatt E.D. Meng I.D. Julius D. Nature. 2004; 427: 260-265Crossref PubMed Scopus (1561) Google Scholar, 10Nagata K. Duggan A. Kumar G. Garcia-Anoveros J. J. Neurosci. 2005; 25: 4052-4061Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). We were interested to examine the effect of external Ca2+ ions on agonist efficacy of various TRPA1 agonists. Therefore, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with cDNA of hTRPA1 and applied AITC, cinnamaldehyde, carvacrol, and icilin in the presence and absence of external Ca2+ ions at a holding potential of Vh =–60 mV (Fig. 1). As expected, AITC (25 μm) induced a slowly developing current in the absence of external Ca2+ ions. Addition of 2 mm CaCl2 to the bath solution evoked a strong potentiation of the inward current (Fig. 1A). The same was true for cinnamaldehyde (500 μm) and carvacrol (500 μm). The currents developed slowly in the absence of external Ca2+ ions and were boosted when Ca2+ was replenished in the extracellular recording solution (Fig. 1, B and C). In contrast, icilin (100 μm) displayed very little or no agonist activity in the absence of external Ca2+ ions (40.3 ± 15.5 pA, Fig. 1, D and F). This low icilin efficacy under Ca2+-free conditions does not seem to reflect a decrease of agonist potency, since increasing icilin concentration from 100 to 500 μm did not produce larger inward currents under Ca2+-free conditions (Fig. 1E). A recovery of icilin agonist efficacy was observed when Ca2+ was added to the extracellular recording solution (Fig. 1, D and E). These data let us suggest that Ca2+ serves as co-agonist with icilin by interacting directly with TRPA1, in a manner resembling the effect of Ca2+ on icilin efficacy at TRPM8 (16Chuang H.H. Neuhausser W.M. Julius D. Neuron. 2004; 43: 859-869Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar). Raising the extracellular Ca2+ concentration from 2 to 5 mm did not significantly increase icilin-induced currents (1815 ± 302 pA, Fig. 1F). To test for the hypothesis that intracellular Ca2+ is required for icilin efficacy, we added BAPTA (5 mm) to the pipette solution while recording in standard extracellular solution containing 2 mm CaCl2. Interestingly, icilin-evoked currents were significantly reduced (863 ± 235 pA, p = 0.048) compared to control conditions with standard intracellular solution (1586 ± 222 pA), indicating a role of intracellular Ca2+ for icilin agonist efficacy (Fig. 1F). Taken together, our results argue for a distinct mechanism of activation by icilin as compared with other TRPA1 agonists. Ca2+ Influx Is Sufficient to Activate TRPA1—In light of the clear dependence of agonist activity on Ca2+, we asked whether Ca2+ itself is sufficient to activate TRPA1. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings in standard extracellular solution for extended periods of time revealed the activation of an inward current that developed after on average 331 ± 58 s in the absence of any agonist in 12 out of 15 recorded cells (Fig. 2A). The current first showed a slow activation kinetic, which was boosted when the initial current reached on average 26.3 ± 3.3% of the total current. Both the initial current and the sudden sharp increase in current were blocked by 1 μm RR, indicating that both components of the biphasic response are mediated through TRPA1 activation (Fig. 2B). Ca2+ may enter through spontaneously active TRPA1 channels, thereby triggering further channel opening until the intracellular Ca2+ concentration reaches a certain threshold level responsible for the sudden sharp increase in current. To clarify whether the leak influx of extracellular Ca2+ activates TRPA1, we recorded under the same conditions at a positive holding potential of Vh =+60 mV. The driving force for Ca2+ is reduced at depolarized membrane potentials resulting in less Ca2+ entry. Therefore, we expected the biphasic response to be abolished or delayed at Vh =+60 mV. Indeed, no sudden sharp increase in current developed within the given time frame of 8 min in which currents developed at –60 mV (Fig. 2C). Application of AITC (10 s, 25 μm) elicited currents, confirming the expression of TRPA1 in the recorded cells. The hypothesis that Ca2+ leak influx activates TRPA1 is further supported by the finding that the biphasic current activation is induced faster when extracellular Ca2+ is increased to 10 mm (59 ± 6 s, Fig. 2D). Again, this current was completely blocked by 1 μm RR (data not shown) and was absent in untransfected HEK293 cells (Fig. 2E). Taken together, these results indicate that influx of extracellular Ca2+ into the cell is sufficient to activate TRPA1. Increase in Intracellular Ca2+ Elicits TRPA1 Currents—To investigate the impact of intracellular Ca2+ on activation of TRPA1, we directly increased the intracellular Ca2+ concentration to 5 mm resulting in a free Ca2+ concentration of 23 μm. A prominent inward current developed almost instantaneously after establishing the whole-cell configuration in cells recorded either in standard extracellular solution (219 ± 38 pA) or Ca2+-free solution (214 ± 68 pA) (Fig. 3A and B, Vh =–60 mV). This current was blocked by 1–5 μm RR (Fig. 3A) and was absent or only exiguous in untransfected HEK293 cells (35 ± 10 pA, Fig. 3C), supporting the finding that intracellular Ca2+ triggers TRPA1 activation. Next, we quantified the sensitivity of TRPA1 channels to intracellular Ca2+ concentrations ranging from 100 nm to 30 μm. We chose a holding potential of Vh = –80 mV to increase the driving force for Na+ ions, which should elicit larger inward currents. Ca2+ was added to an EGTA-buffered pipette solution to define various Ca2+ concentrations. The dose-response relationship was fitted with a Hill equation determining an EC50 of 905 ± 249 nm and a Hill-Coefficient of 0.9 ± 0.2 (Fig. 3D). Ca2+ Activates TRPA1 in Excised Inside-out Patches—In whole-cell recordings many receptors or ion channel proteins might be modulated by intracellular processes or factors like enzymatic activity or cytosolic signaling molecules. To reduce a possible influence of cytosolic factors that might control the behavior of channels, we examined the effect of Ca2+ on excised patches from transfected HEK293 cells in the insideout configuration. Interestingly, application of Ca2+ in nanomolar concentrations to the intracellular side of the membrane was sufficient to elicit TRPA1 single-channel currents with amplitudes of on average –9.5 pA at a membrane potential (Vm) of –80 mV resulting in a single-channel conductance of 119 ± 6.3 pS (Fig. 4, A and B). Application of higher Ca2+ concentrations (1–3 μm) led to activation of more channels or even induced macroscopic currents in some patches (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we observed desensitization of Ca2+-induced currents (see Fig. 4A). Consistent with the Ca2+ dose-response curve for TRPA1 in whole-cell recordings (see Fig. 3D), we also found dose dependence in inside-out patches (Fig. 4C). In untransfected control cells we observed an endogenous Ca2+-sensitive ion channel with a single-channel conductance of 40 pS at Vm =–80 mV, which interferes with the overexpressed TRPA1 in transfected cells (Fig. 4D). Further analysis of single-channel currents in transfected cells during voltage ramp-protocols showed that currents evoked by Ca2+ (3 μm) or AITC (25 μm) have identical reversal potentials and rectification properties arguing that Ca2+-activated currents are due to TRPA1 activation (Fig. 4E). Ca2+ Activates TRPA1 in a PLC-independent Fashion—In light of the clear activation of TRPA1 by intracellular Ca2+ we asked whether Ca2+ directly gates TRPA1 or via a PLC-dependent signaling pathway. Since endogenous PLC activity remains preserved in inside-out patches (19Nilius B. Mahieu F. Prenen J. Janssens A. Owsianik G. Vennekens R. Voets T. EMBO J. 2006; 25: 467-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar) we stimulated inside-out patches with 3 μm Ca2+ after 30 s preincubation with the PLC-inhibitor U73122 (10 μm). Ca2+ was still able to induce TRPA1-mediated currents (Fig. 4F), indicating that Ca2+ may directly gate TRPA1 probably by binding to a high affinity Ca2+-binding site at the channels cytosolic side. TRPA1 Exhibits a Putative EF-hand CBD—While screening for Ca2+-binding domains, we identified a putative EF-hand motif at the N terminus of TRPA1 (Asp-468-Leu-480). To test for the hypothesis that Ca2+ activates TRPA1 by binding through the EF-hand CBD, we used a 12-mer Ca2+ like peptide, CALP2, known to function as antagonist at the EF-hands of calmodulin and troponin C (20Villain M. Jackson P.L. Manion M.K. Dong W.J. Su Z. Fassina G. Johnson T.M. Sakai T.T. Krishna N.R. Blalock J.E. J. Biol.

Immunol. 2001; 166: 861-867Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). We examined the effect of CALP2 on Ca2+-induced TRPA1 single-channel currents in excised inside-out patches at Vm =–80 mV. Interestingly, Ca2+-induced (1 μm) activity was strongly reduced in the presence of CALP2 (50 μm). The open probability decreased by ∼90%, whereas the single-channel amplitude was unaffected (8.3 ± 0.5 pA before CALP2; 7.7 ± 1.7 pA during CALP2) (Fig. 5A). The inhibitory effect of CALP2 was reversed by removal of the peptide and channel activity reverted back to the prior level (Fig. 5A). To exclude that CALP2 blocks the channel pore, we evaluated the effect of CALP2 on AITC-induced currents (Fig. 5B). Co-application of CALP2 (50 μm) had no influence on AITC-induced (25 μm) open probability nor on single-channel currents (13.1 ± 4.3 pA before CALP2; 14.5 ± 2.8 pA during CALP2). It should be noted that AITC-induced current amplitudes varied extremely (Fig. 5B) and reached on average larger amplitudes as compared with Ca2+-induced currents (Fig. 5A). Up to now a role of calmodulin in TRPA1 function has not been reported. However, CALP2 might interact with calmodulin bound to TRPA1. To exclude a role of calmodulin in Ca2+-dependent activation, we preincubated the excised patches with CMZ, a known calmodulin inhibitor. We used a concentration known to be active in other calmodulin-dependent processes (10 μm) (22Zhang Z. Tang J. Tikunova S. Johnson J.D. Chen Z. Qin N. Dietrich A. Stefani E. Birnbaumer L. Zhu M.X. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 3168-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 23Lupinsky D.A. Magoski N.S. J. Physiol. (Lond.). 2006; 575: 491-506Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar). After 20 s preincubation we exposed the patches to 1 μm Ca2+ in the presence of CMZ. Ca2+ still elicited TRPA1 single-channel currents (8.9 ± 3 pA), arguing that calmodulin is not involved in Ca2+-dependent activation of TRPA1 (Fig. 5C). A Single Mutation within the EF-hand CBD Impairs Ca2+ Sensitivity—Based on the effect of CALP2 on Ca2+-induced single-channel currents, we were interested to see whether sensitivity of TRPA1 to Ca2+ could be limited to a single residue within the EF-hand CBD. The EF-hand motif of TRPA1 appears to be highly conserved within different species (Fig. 6A). To identify the site(s) responsible for Ca2+ binding, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis for the residues proposed to be involved in Ca2+ binding (Fig. 6B) (12Lewit-Bentley A. Rety S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2000; 10: 637-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar). The resulting mutants (D468A, S470A, T472A, L474A, N476A, and D479A) were expressed in HEK293 cells and expression was first confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 6C). Mouse TRPA1 antibodies recognized an expected band of ∼128 kDa for wild-type TRPA1 and EF-hand mutants, indicating effective expression of all mutants. It should be noted that although the antibodies only recognized one band for the mutant T472A, this was of lower molecular weight than predicted. No band was detected in the whole cell extract from untransfected cells (Fig. 6C). To analyze for functionality of the mutant receptors, we verified the sensitivity to AITC (25 μm) before examining changes in Ca2+ sensitivity of the mutants. Mutations at positions Asp-468, Ser-470, and Leu-474 were found to retain AITC sensitivity (Fig. 6D). Although slight differences were observed in mean current amplitudes elicited after 10 s application of AITC (Fig. 6E), currents showed identical reversal potentials and rectification properties for mutants as compared with the wild-type channel, arguing for plenary functionality of the mutants D468A, S470A, and L474A (Fig. 6, D and E). No currents could be observed for cells expressing the T472A, N476A, and D479A mutants (Fig. 6D). Even prolonged exposure to AITC (25 μm, 60s) did not induce any inward or outward currents (Fig. 6D)."

The molecular mechanisms underlying glial cell activation, however, have not been clearly elucidated. In this study, we found that damaged sensory neurons induce the expression of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-1β, interleukin-6, and inducible nitric-oxide synthase genes in spinal cord glial cells, which is implicated in the development of neuropathic pain. Studies using primary glial cells isolated from toll-like receptor 2 knock-out mice indicate that damaged sensory neurons activate glial cells via toll-like receptor 2. In addition, behavioral studies using toll-like receptor 2 knock-out mice demonstrate that the expression of toll-like receptor 2 is required for the induction of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia due to spinal nerve axotomy. The nerve injury-induced spinal cord microglia and astrocyte activation is reduced in the toll-like receptor 2 knock-out mice.

Traditionally, pain has been thought to be mediated solely by neurons. Recent discoveries on the role of spinal cord glial cells, however, provide support for a different model of pathological pain hypersensitivity. Increasing evidence indicates that glial cell activation in the spinal cord plays a critical role in the initiation and/or maintenance of pathological pain with various etiologies (1Watkins L.R. Milligan E.D. Maier S.F. Trends Neurosci. 2001; 24: 450-455Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). In a neuropathic pain model with fifth lumbar (L5) spinal nerve ligation, microglia and astrocyte activation is manifested in the dorsal horn ipsilateral to the injury (2Colburn R.W. Rickman A.J.

Inhibition of glial cell activation using chemical inhibitors such as minocycline suggested that microglia activation is required for the induction, but not for the maintenance, of nerve injury-mediated neuropathic pain (4Ledeboer A.

Upon activation, glial cells express various inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α, 4The abbreviations used are: TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor-α; IL-1β, interleukin-1β; iNOS, inducible nitric-oxide synthase; TLR, Toll-like receptor; RT, reverse transcription; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK, c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; hsp, heat shock protein; SDSN, supernatant of damaged sensory neuron; DRG, dorsal root ganglion; COX-2, cyclooxygenase-2; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein.

It is suggested that the expression of these mediators in the spinal cord contributes to the development of pain hypersensitivity, although the mechanisms have not been clearly elucidated yet (10Sommer C.

Brain Res. 2004; 1015: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Thus far, several candidate molecules have been suggested to activate spinal cord glial cells upon peripheral nerve injury. For instance, fractalkine, a member of the chemokine family, was suggested to transmit neuron-derived signal to microglia. In addition, it was reported that the expression of P2X4, an ATP receptor, in microglia is required for the development of neuropathic pain (14Tsuda M. Shigemoto-Mogami Y. Koizumi S. Mizokoshi A. Kohsaka S. Salter M.W. Inoue K. Nature. 2003; 424: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar), suggesting that ATP is a microglial activator. However, P2X4 is rarely expressed on resting microglia but induced only after nerve injury or inflammatory stimulation (14Tsuda M. Shigemoto-Mogami Y. Koizumi S. Mizokoshi A. Kohsaka S. Salter M.W. Inoue K. Nature. 2003; 424: 778-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (1271) Google Scholar, 15Guo L.H. Trautmann K. Schluesener H.J. J. Neuroimmunol. 2005; 163: 120-127Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting an additional spinal cord glial cell activator that induces P2X4 expression on microglia. Given these previous reports, it is still inconclusive how spinal cord glial cells are activated upon peripheral nerve injury. In this regard, it is of interest that damaged sensory neurons or peripheral nerves can induce inflammatory Schwann cell activation through toll-like receptors (TLRs) (16Lee H. Jo E.K. Choi S.Y. Oh S.B. Park K. Kim J.S. Lee S.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2006; 350: 742-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar, 17Karanth S. Yang G. Yeh J. Richardson P.M. Exp. Neurol. 2006; 202: 161-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). These reports suggest that spinal cord glial cells may also be activated by damaged sensory neuron-derived molecules. TLRs are type I transmembrane-signaling proteins that are expressed in the cells of the innate immune system (18Li M. Carpio D.F. Zheng Y. Bruzzo P. Singh V. Ouaaz F. Medzhitov R.M. Beg A.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7128-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). Each TLR recognizes pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are structures expressed by microorganisms. Several pathogen-associated molecular patterns have been identified, including lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria, peptidoglycan, and lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria, bacterial flagellin, double-stranded viral RNA, and bacterial DNA. Thus far, more than 10 different TLRs with distinct ligand specificities have been identified (19Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Akira S. J. Immunol. 2000; 165: 5392-5396Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar, 20Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sanjo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S.

Greenblatt M.B. Bussey C. Flavell R.A. Ghosh S. Science. 2004; 303: 1522-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (882) Google Scholar). In the central nervous system, microglia and astrocytes were shown to express various TLRs, including TLR2 and TLR4, which suggests their role as innate immune cells in the central nervous system (23Bsibsi M. Ravid R. Gveric D. van Noort J.M. J. Neuropathol. Exp. Neurol. 2002; 61: 1013-1021Crossref PubMed Scopus (812) Google Scholar). Interestingly, the expression of TLRs in glial cells is implicated in the development of neurological disorders. In the rat neuropathic pain model, TLR4 transcripts are up-regulated in the spinal cord upon spinal nerve injury (24Tanga F.Y. Raghavendra V. DeLeo J.A. Neurochem. Int. 2004; 45: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar). It has also been reported that TLR4 is required for the maximum induction of pain hypersensitivity upon spinal nerve transection (25Tanga F.Y. Nutile-McMenemy N. DeLeo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5856-5861Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar). However, it is not known how TLR4 contributes to the degree of pain hypersensitivity. Neither, the involvement of other members of TLR in the development of neuropathic pain has been investigated. All surgical and experimental procedures were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Seoul National University. The animal treatments were performed according to the guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain. Animals and Surgery—TLR2 knock-out mice (26Takeuchi O. Hoshino K. Kawai T.

Immunity. 1999; 11: 443-451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2790) Google Scholar) of C57BL/6 background and C57BL/6 mice were housed in an animal facility with a specific pathogen-free barrier at a temperature of 23 ± 2 °C. They experienced a 12-h light-dark cycle and were fed food and water ad libitum. All mice were aged 8 weeks at the time of surgery, and efforts were made to limit distress to the animals. Mice were anesthetized with halothane (2–4%) in O2 during surgery via a nose cone. The L5 spinal nerves were transected as previously described (25Tanga F.Y. Nutile-McMenemy N. DeLeo J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 5856-5861Crossref PubMed Scopus (525) Google Scholar, 27Kim S.H. Chung J.M. Pain. 1992; 50: 355-363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2681) Google Scholar) with the following minor modification. Briefly, following surgical preparation, the left paraspinal muscles were separated by an incision from spinal processes at L4 to S2 levels. The L6 transverse process was partially removed, and the L4 and L5 spinal nerves were identified. Then, the L5 spinal nerve was separated and transected. The wound was irrigated with saline and closed in two layers with surgical skin staples. Behavioral Testing—Mechanical allodynia was assessed by measuring foot withdrawal thresholds in response to mechanical stimuli to the hind paw. The 50% withdrawal threshold was determined using the up-down method (28Chaplan S.R. Bach F.W. Pogrel J.W. Chung J.M. Yaksh T.L. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1994; 53: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (5549) Google Scholar) with a set of von Frey filaments (0.02–6 gauge, Stoeling, Wood Dale, IL). Heat hyperalgesia was determined by using the plantar test (Ugo Basile, Italy) following a modified method of Hargreaves et al. (29Hargreaves K. Dubner R. Brown F. Flores C. Joris J. Pain. 1988; 32: 77-88Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (4319) Google Scholar). Two different intensities for heat hyperalgesia are employed: low intensity (IR 30) and high intensity (IR 60). Animals were habituated to the apparatus that consisted of three individual Perspex boxes on an elevated glass table. A mobile radiant heat source was located under the table and focused onto the hind paw. Paw withdrawal latencies were recorded in seconds. The heat intensity was adjusted to obtain average paw withdrawal latencies of 7–8 s and 4–5 s for the application of low intensity (IR 30) and high intensity (IR 60), respectively, and the cut-off time was set at 15 s to prevent tissue damage. The heat stimulation was repeated three times at an interval of 5–10 min for each paw, and the mean was calculated. The behavioral tests were performed blinded. Cell Culture—Primary rat spinal cord glial cells were prepared from 7-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats as previously described (30Eccleston P.A. Silberberg D.H. Brain Res. 1984; 318: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) with the following minor modification. Briefly, after anesthetized, spines were cut out from 0.5 cm above the tail, a syringe with phosphate-buffered saline was inserted, and the spinal cord was pushed out by hydraulic pressure. After removal of the meninges, the spinal cord was triturated by repetitive pipetting and seeded in 75-cm2 flasks. Cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 1 mm HEPES, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, and 1× antibiotic/antimycotic. After 2 weeks, the cells were seeded in 6-well plates and used for experiments. The cell composition of the spinal cord mixed glial cell culture was routinely monitored by immunostaining using anti-GFAP (DAKO, Denmark) and anti-CD11b (Serotec, Oxford, UK) antibodies. With a similar procedure, primary spinal cord glial cells were prepared from C57BL/6 and TLR2 knock-out mice. DRG explant cultures were prepared as previously described (31Nishino J. Yamashita K. Hashiguchi H. Fujii H. Shimazaki T. Hamada H. EMBO J. 2004; 23: 1998-2008Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Briefly, DRGs were dissected from embryonic day 15 Sprague-Dawley rats. After being stripped of nerve roots and connective tissues, five DRGs were plated on a glass slide in a 35-mm tissue culture dish containing 200 μl of culture medium (Neurobasal medium (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with 100 ng/ml nerve growth factor)) and incubated at 37 °C in an atmosphere containing 5% CO2. The glass slides were coated with poly-l-lysine (Sigma) and laminin (Invitrogen). To eliminate non-neuronal cell growth, 10 μm 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine (Sigma) was added to the culture medium for 24 h on day 2, followed by replacing the 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine medium with normal medium and culturing for 48 h. This process was repeated several times until the cultures were used. Cells were used from 7 to 10 days after plating. F11 cells (a hybrid cell line of mouse N18TG2 neuroblastoma and rat DRG sensory neuron) were maintained as described elsewhere (32Francel P.C. Harris K. Smith M. Fishman M.C. Dawson G. Miller R.J. J. Neurochem. 1987; 48: 1624-1631Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Preparation of Supernatant of Damaged Sensory Neurons (SDSN)—To obtain SDSN, F11 were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in a glial cell culture media at 106 cells/ml. F11 cell damage was induced by four cycles of freezing on liquid nitrogen followed by thawing in water bath at 37 °C. Such treatment generally resulted in 95% lysis of the cells as judged by trypan blue inclusion. The cells were spun down, and the supernatant was used for the following studies. Prior to its use in the experiments, the SDSN was tested for endotoxin contamination using the kinetic colorimetric limulus amebocyte lysate assay (QCL-1000, Cambrex Bioscience, Walkersville, MD). Real-time RT-PCR—Real-time RT-PCR was performed using the Sybr Green reagents kit and an ABI Prism 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The sequences of the primers used in this study are presented in Table 1. The level of each gene was normalized to the levels of the rat GAPDH or mouse GAPDH gene and represented as a -fold induction.

A total of 50 μg of cell lysate from each sample was resolved by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and blocked with 5% nonfat dry milk in Tween 20-containing Tris-buffered saline (TBST, 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 0.1% Tween 20, and 150 mm NaCl). The membranes were probed overnight with primary antibody (IκB-α, phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, or phospho-JNK at 1:3000; Cell Signaling, Beverly, MA) at 4 °C, which was followed by incubation with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at room temperature for 1 h prior to ECL treatment and exposure to x-ray film. For normalization of antibody signal, the membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies for actin, ERK, p38, or JNK (1:3000). ELISA—Primary rat glial cells were stimulated with SDSN for various time periods. Then culture supernatants were collected, and cell lysates were prepared from each sample by repetitive freeze-thaw cycles in 300 μl of TBST (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100). The expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 protein was quantified using TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 ELISA kits (BioSource, Camarillo, CA), respectively, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Total protein concentration from each cell lysate was measured using a Bio-Rad (Hercules, CA) protein assay kit and used for normalization. Nitrite Assay—Nitric oxide (NO) production was measured using Griess reagents (G4410, Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, equal volumes of the culture supernatants and the Griess reagent were mixed, and the absorbance was measured at 540 nm after 15 min. The nitrite concentration in each sample was calculated from a standard curve and normalized to the cell number in each sample. Immunohistochemistry—TLR2 knock-out mice and C57BL/6 wild-type mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with fresh 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) on days 0, 4, and 7 after surgery. The L5 segment of the spinal cord was removed by laminectomy and post-fixed at 4 °C overnight and then transferred to 30% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline for 48 h. Transverse sections (20-μm thick) of L5 spinal cord were prepared using a cryocut microtome (Leica CM3050S). The floating sections were incubated with 3% H2O2 for 30 min and blocked in solution containing 5% normal goat/horse serum, 5% fetal bovine serum, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for 2 h at room temperature. Then, the sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with monoclonal antibody for CD11b (1:500), GFAP (1:10,000), or phospho-p38 (1:500). After washing, the sections were then incubated with biotinylated secondary antibody (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with avidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories) at 1:200 for 1 h at room temperature, and then visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Sigma). For double immunofluorescent staining, floating sections were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a mixture of mouse anti-TNF-α (1:500, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) and rabbit anti-phospho-p38 antibodies, or mouse anti-TNF-α and rabbit anti-Iba-1 antibodies (1:2000, Wako, Japan). The sections were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a mixture of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies (1:200, Jackson ImmunoResearch). The sections were mounted with Vectashield (Vector Laboratories). Fluorescent images were obtained with a confocal microscope (LSM 5 Pascal, Carl Zeiss). Statistical Analysis—All data are presented as means ± S.E. The statistical significance of differences between the values was determined by Student t test or analysis of variance with post hoc test. A p value of <0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Damaged Sensory Neurons Induce Spinal Cord Glial Cell Activation—To investigate the mechanisms of spinal cord glial cell activation due to peripheral nerve injury, we prepared the primary mixed glial cells from rat spinal cord and stimulated them with a supernatant of a damage-sensory neuronal cell line (F11). The addition of the SDSN to the spinal cord mixed glial cell culture strongly induced the transcripts of the various pain-mediating inflammatory genes. It up-regulated the transcripts of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS genes by 160-, 280-, 940-, and 2500-fold, respectively (Fig. 1A). In addition, it induced COX-2 mRNA, another important gene involved in pain hypersensitivity (34Ma W. Du W. Eisenach J.C. Brain Res. 2002; 937: 94-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), expression by 80-fold (data not shown). The supernatant of undamaged F11 culture, however, did not significantly induce expression of the above mentioned pain-mediating genes, indicating that the majority of the putative glial cell-activating molecules are released only after neuron damage has occurred. Similarly, the SDSN stimulation induced the secretion of TNF-α and IL-6 and the production of NO in the spinal cord glial cells (Fig. 1B). Interestingly, SDSN up-regulated the intracellular IL-1β level >30-fold (Fig. 1B), although it did not induce the secretion of the protein (data not shown). The SDSN activated the glial cells in a dose-dependent manner. Maximum induction of TNF-α gene expression was observed when SDSN was added into glial cells at a 1 × 105 cells/ml concentration (Fig. 1C). Studies of the intracellular signaling pathways showed that SDSN stimulation induced the activation of p38, ERK, and JNK MAPKs. The activation of ERK and JNK MAPKs peaked after 45 min of stimulation with SDSN, whereas p38 activation peaked at 30 min. Similarly, NF-κB, which was measured by IκB-α degradation, was activated after 15 min of SDSN stimulation (Fig. 2A). Our study using pharmacological inhibitors revealed that the activation of NF-κB, ERK, and p38 is required for SDSN-mediated TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS gene expression, whereas JNK activation is required for IL-6 gene expression (Fig. 2B). In an independent experiment, we stimulated the spinal cord glial cells with degenerating neurites of DRG. The data show that, in the absence of a neuronal cell body, the DRG neurites alone are able to induce the expression of the aforementioned cytokines, iNOS and COX-2, in the spinal cord glial cells (Fig. 3). Taken together, these data demonstrate that damaged sensory neurons release strong glial cell-activating factor(s), which might be involved in the activation of spinal cord glial cells upon peripheral nerve damage.FIGURE 2The activation of NF-κB and MAPKs are required for SDSN-mediated pro-inflammatory gene expression. A, SDSN stimulation activates NF-κB and MAPKs in rat spinal cord glial cells. Rat spinal cord glial cells were stimulated with SDSN (1 × 105 cells/ml) for various time periods. Cell lysates were prepared from each sample and used for Western blot analysis. The nitrocellulose membranes were probed with antibodies for IκB, phospho-ERK, phospho-p38, and phospho-JNK. The membranes were stripped and reprobed with antibodies for actin, total ERK, total p38, and total JNK, respectively. B, the spinal cord glial cells were treated with SDSN in the presence or absence of various inhibitors: Hel (helenalin, NF-κB inhibitor, 5 μm), U (U0126, ERK inhibitor, 5 μm), SB (SB202190, p38 inhibitor, 5 μm), and SP (SP600125, JNK inhibitor, 5 μm). The inhibitors were added 1 h prior to the SDSN stimulation. The mRNA expression of each gene was measured by real-time RT-PCR (*, p < 0.05, versus SDSN-treated control sample).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)FIGURE 3The addition of damaged neurites alone induced pro-inflammatory gene expression in glial cells. The DRG neurons were prepared using E15 Sprague-Dawley rat embryos and were cultured on a glass slide. Upon maximum outgrowth of neurites, the neuronal cell body was cut out from the glass slide and the rest of the degenerating DRG neurites were added to the glial cell culture. The images of the DRG explant before and after the removal of the cell body are shown in the upper panels. The spinal cord glial cells were stimulated with the degenerating DRG neurites for 3 h. The total RNA was prepared and used for real-time RT-PCR to measure the expression levels of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, iNOS, and COX-2 genes (*, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; versus control sample).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) TLR2 Is Required for the SDSN-induced Pro-inflammatory Cytokine and iNOS Gene Expression—Recently, it was reported that necrotic cells activate innate immune cells via a specific transmembrane receptor called TLR2 (18Li M. Carpio D.F. Zheng Y. Bruzzo P. Singh V. Ouaaz F. Medzhitov R.M. Beg A.A. J. Immunol. 2001; 166: 7128-7135Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). To test whether TLR2 is involved in the SDSN-mediated spinal cord glial cell activation, we prepared spinal cord glial cells from TLR2 knock-out mice as well as from wild-type control mice. Upon stimulation with SDSN, the mRNA expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-6, and iNOS genes was up-regulated by 180-, 1010-, 80-, and 150-fold, respectively. The gene induction by SDSN, however, was almost completely abrogated in the cells from the TLR2 knock-out mice (Fig. 4). These data demonstrate that the effects of SDSN are mediated by the TLR2 of spinal cord glial cells. TLR2 Contributes to the Induction of Pain Hypersensitivity after L5 Spinal Nerve Transection—We then tested the susceptibility of the TLR2 knock-out mice to nerve injury-induced pain hypersensitivity. Upon L5 spinal nerve axotomy, wild-type mice showed increased sensitivity to both mechanical and thermal stimuli (Fig. 5). The paw withdrawal threshold to the mechanical stimuli decreased 1 day after nerve axotomy, and, after 7 days, was reduced to 0.05 ± 0.01 g, compared with the original threshold before transection (0.84 ± 0.08 g). The threshold remained below 0.1 g on day 14. The paw withdrawal threshold of the TLR2 knock-out mice, however, reduced only to 0.50 ± 0.12 g (Fig. 5A), compared with the original threshold (1.01 ± 0.14 g). Likewise, the threshold to the thermal stimuli in the wild-type mice decreased by >55% after 7 days, whereas, in TLR2 knock-out mice, it decreased <40% (Fig. 5B). Pain hypersensitivity was not observed in the sham-operated wild-type or TLR2 mice. These data indicate that TLR2 is required for the maximum induction of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia upon L5 spinal nerve injury.

https://openalex.org/W2092536825,"Hedgehog (Hh) signaling is deregulated in multiple human cancers including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Because KRAS mutation represents one of the earliest genetic alterations and occurs almost universally in PDA, we hypothesized that oncogenic KRAS promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis in part through activation of the Hh pathway. Here, we report that oncogenic KRAS activates hedgehog signaling in PDA cells, utilizing a downstream effector pathway mediated by RAF/MEK/MAPK but not phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT. Oncogenic KRAS transformation of human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells increases GLI transcriptional activity, an effect that is inhibited by the MEK-specific inhibitors U0126 and PD98059, but not by the PI3K-specific inhibitor wortmannin. Inactivation of KRAS activity by a small interfering RNA specific for oncogenic KRAS inhibits GLI activity and GLI1 expression in PDA cell lines with activating KRAS mutation; the MEK inhibitors U0126 and PD98059 elicit a similar response. In addition, expression of the constitutively active form of BRAFE600, but not myr-AKT, blocks the inhibitory effects of KRAS knockdown on Hh signaling. Finally, suppressing GLI activity leads to a selective attenuation of the oncogenic transformation activity of mutant KRAS-expressing PDA cells. These results demonstrate that oncogenic KRAS, through RAF/MEK/MAPK signaling, is directly involved in the activation of the hedgehog pathway in PDA cells and that collaboration between these two signaling pathways may play an important role in PDA progression.

It was estimated that in 2006 33,730 new cases would be diagnosed, and 32,300 would die from the disease (American Cancer Society Cancer Facts and Figures 2006). Therefore, PDA is one of the most lethal human diseases, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 4% and a median survival of less than 6 months. PDA is one of the better-characterized neoplasms at the genetic level. There are now sufficient clinical, genetic, and pathological data to support a tumor progression model for PDA in which the pancreatic ductal epithelium progresses from normal to increased grades of pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia to invasive cancer (1Hruban R.H.

Pathol. 2002; 15: 441-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Accompanying the progressive morphological changes is the sequential accumulation of genetic alterations in the KRAS oncogene and the tumor suppressors INK4A, p53, and SMAD4/DPC4, although these alterations have not been linked to the acquisition of specific histopathological attributes (3Moskaluk C.A.

In addition to these frequent genetic abnormalities, mutations in the tumor suppressors BRCA2, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2, the serine-threonine kinases AKT2 and LKB1/STK11, and certain DNA mismatch-repair genes represent other less common genetic events in PDA (6Goggins M.

Aberrant RAS activation plays a critical role in tumorigenesis; activating RAS mutations are found in 30% of all human cancers (12Bos J.L. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 4682-4689PubMed Google Scholar). Of all human cancers, PDA has the highest incidence of activating KRAS mutations (13Almoguera C. Shibata D. Forrester K. Martin J. Arnheim N. Perucho M. Cell. 1988; 53: 549-554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1904) Google Scholar).

The frequency of KRAS mutations correlates with disease progression, reaching almost 100% in pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

These observations suggest that KRAS plays an essential role in the initiation, development, and maintenance of PDA.

Hh signaling is essential for morphogenesis, tissue patterning, and stem cell maintenance in metazoan embryos (24Ingham P.W. McMahon A.P. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 3059-3087Crossref PubMed Scopus (2489) Google Scholar). Hh binds to its membrane receptor Patched (PTC), releasing PTC inhibition of a seven-transmembrane protein, Smoothened (SMO), which in turn activates downstream cytoplasmic transcription factors; that is, the CI protein in Drosophila or the mammalian homologue GLI proteins (25Lum L. Beachy P.A. Science. 2004; 304: 1755-1759Crossref PubMed Scopus (695) Google Scholar).

The coincidence of uncontrolled activation of the RAS and Hh pathways in the early stages of PDA suggests that cross-talk between these two pathways may be a very important mechanism for the initiation and development of PDA. However, the causal effects between KRAS and Hh signaling in pancreatic tumorigenesis are not clear. Earlier results from Pdx-Shh mice had suggested that ectopic expression of Hedgehog ligands is sufficient to activate the Ras signaling pathway by inducing a mutation in the Kras gene (21Thayer S.P. di Magliano M.P.

Sekine S. Ermilov A. Ferris J. Dlugosz A.A. Hebrok M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3161-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). In addition, although expression of endogenous level of oncogenic Kras, KrasG12D, leads to pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia identical to all three stages found in the cognate human condition and eventually PDA in mice (19Hingorani S.R.

Sekine S. Ermilov A. Ferris J. Dlugosz A.A. Hebrok M. Genes Dev. 2006; 20: 3161-3173Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Because KRAS mutation represents one of the earliest genetic alterations and occurs almost universally in pancreatic adenocarcinomas, we hypothesized that oncogenic KRAS promotes pancreatic tumorigenesis in part through activation of the Hh signaling pathway in PDA. Our study shows that oncogenic transformation of human pancreatic ductal epithelial (HPDE) cells by oncogenic KRAS is indeed accompanied by enhanced GLI activation and that specific down-regulation of oncogenic KRAS activity inhibits Hh signaling in PDA cell lines with KRAS mutations. These results demonstrate that oncogenic KRAS is involved in activation of the Hh/GLI pathway in PDA cells and that cross-talk between the oncogenic KRAS and Hh pathways may play an important role in promoting cancer development during pancreatic tumorigenesis.

Cell Culture and Transfection—HPDE-c7, an immortalized pancreatic ductal epithelial cell line, was provided by Dr. Ming-Sound Tsao (University of Toronto, Canada) and cultured in keratinocyte serum-free (KSF) medium supplemented with bovine pituitary extract and epidermal growth factor (Invitrogen). KRASV12-transformed HPDE-c7 cells were produced by retroviral infection of HPDE-c7 cells with a KRASV12 construct. Panc-1 and AsPC-1 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (AsPC-1) or Dulbecco’s modified Essential medium (Panc-1) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen). Transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (the ratio of plasmid (μg) to lipid (μl) was 1:3). Retroviral Infection—Retroviruses were generated by transfecting amphotropic Phoenix packaging cells with the retroviral vector pBabepuro-KRAS4BG12V and the corresponding empty vector pBabepuro using Lipofectamine Plus reagent (Invitrogen). Retroviral supernatants were collected, filtered, and incubated with the target cells in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene (Sigma). After 48 h, cells were subjected to selection using 0.5 μg/ml puromycin (ICN Biomedicals, Irvine, CA) until all the untransduced cells had died. RAS Activity Assay—The GTP loading status of RAS was assessed using a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion of the RAS binding domain (RBD) of RAF (GST-RAF-RBD) as described earlier (32Young T.W. Mei F.C. Yang G. Thompson-Lanza J.A. Liu J. Cheng X. Cancer Res. 2004; 64: 4577-4584Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Anchorage-independent Cell Growth Assay—Cells (1 × 103–5 × 105) were suspended in 2 ml of HPDE cell medium with 0.35% agarose (Invitrogen), and the suspension was placed on top of 5 ml of solidified 0.7% agarose. Triplicate cultures at three different dilutions for each cell type were maintained at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, and fresh medium was added after 1 week. Colonies were photographed between 14 and 24 days under a phase contrast microscope. The number of colonies was counted from each experiment, and the experiment was reproduced twice. Student’s t test for two samples was used to determine the statistical significance between the two groups. A p value less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Immunoblotting Analysis—Protein concentration of cell lysates was assayed with the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Equal amounts of protein (5–30 μg) were loaded onto 10% SDS-polyacrylamide mini-gels (Bio-Rad) and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after electrophoresis. After being blocked overnight in 5% milk in Tris-buffered saline-Tween, blots were incubated with primary antibodies for 1.5 h followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (1:4000) for 45 min. Antigen-antibody complexes were detected by enhanced chemiluminescence. Luciferase Reporter Gene Assay—For luciferase assay, cells were transfected with the Gli or other luciferase reporter construct (0.5 μg/well) and the SV40-Renilla control plasmid (2 ng/well) using Lipofectamine 2000. After 6 h the medium was replaced with fresh growth medium, and the cells were incubated in 5% CO2 at 37 °C overnight. After treatment with U0126 or other compounds, the cells were harvested, and luciferase activity was measured with the dual luciferase reporter assay system (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Briefly, the transfected cells were lysed in the 12-well plates with 100 μl of reporter lysis buffer, and the lysate was transferred into Eppendorf tubes. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at top speed for 30 s in a refrigerated microcentrifuge. 20 μl of the supernatant was mixed with 100 μl of LAR II buffer, and the luminescence was immediately measured (first reading). After 20 s, 100 μl of Stop & Glo® reagent was added to measure the Renilla luciferase activity (second reading). The value from the first reading was divided by the value from the second reading of each sample to obtain normalized luciferase activity. Each experiment was repeated at least three times with similar results. Gli luciferase reporter constructs 8 × 3′Gli BSwt-luc and 8 × 3′Gli BSmut-luc were provided by Dr. H. Sasaki (29Sasaki H. Hui C. Nakafuku M. Kondoh H. Development. 1997; 124: 1313-1322Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Quantitative Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated from cultured cells as previously described (33Mei F.C. Young T.W. Liu J. Cheng X. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 497-499Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Real-time PCR analysis was conducted using an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 sequence detection system and TaqMan® gene expression assays for relative quantification of GLI1 (Hs00171790_ m1) and hedgehog-interacting protein (Hs00368450_m1) mRNA. Duplicate CT values were analyzed in Microsoft Excel using the comparative CT(ΔΔCT) method as described by the manufacturer (Applied Biosystems). The amount of target (2–ΔΔCT) was obtained by normalized to endogenous reference (18 S) and relative to a calibrator. Oncogenic Transformation of HPDE by KRASV12—To probe the mechanism of oncogene KRAS-mediated pancreatic tumorigenesis, we established a KRAS oncogene-based human PDA model using an immortalized primary HPDE cell line, HPDE-c7. This well characterized cell line is a near-diploid human pancreatic duct epithelial cell line originally derived from normal pancreas. Although immortalized by E6/E7 genes of human papilloma virus-16, HPDE-c7 is non-tumorigenic and incapable of inducing tumor growth in nude mice (34Furukawa T. Duguid W.P. Rosenberg L. Viallet J. Galloway D.A. Tsao M.S. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1763-1770PubMed Google Scholar, 35Ouyang H. Mou L. Luk C. Liu N. Karaskova J. Squire J. Tsao M.S. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 157: 1623-1631Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). Stable expression of KRASV12 in HPDE-c7 cells using a retroviral expression vector led to transformation of the cell line. For all experiments performed in this study, we used early passages of the same puromycin-selected pool of KRASV12-transformed HPDE-c7 cells to eliminate potential clonal and passage variations. The resultant cells, HPDE-c7-KRASV12, expressed increased levels of total RAS protein, showed high RAS-GTP activity, and grew anchorage-independently in soft agar. In addition, expression of KRASV12 in HPDE-c7 cells also led to the activation of its downstream effectors, such as MAPK and AKT. The basal phospho-MAPK and phospho-AKT levels were enhanced in the HPDE-c7-KRASV12 cells compared with the parental cells. These observations are in complete agreement with results obtained from an independently established KRAS human PDA model using the same HPDE-c7 parental cell line (36Qian J. Niu J. Li M. Chiao P.J. Tsao M.S. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 5045-5053Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Activation of Hh Signaling by KRASV12 in HPDE—To examine the roles of the activating KRAS oncogene in controlling Hh signaling during the oncogenic transformation of HPDE, we compared the activities of Hh signaling in parental, vector control, and KRASV12-expressing HPDE cells. As shown in Fig. 1A, KRASV12 expression led to a significantly increased activation of Gli-mediated luciferase activity, whereas the expression of the Myc reporter and a mutant Gli reporter that is incapable of binding GLI transcription factors were not affected. Moreover, the KRASV12-induced Gli-luciferase activity was insensitive to cyclopamine treatment (5 μm), whereas the same treatment resulted in significant inhibition of Gli-luciferase activity in an SMO-expressing 10T1/2 cell line (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that KRASV12 activates Hh signaling in HPDE cells in a ligand-independent manner. Further supporting our results based on the luciferase assay, oncogenic KRAS also up-regulated endogenous levels of GLI1 and hedgehog-interacting protein mRNAs, both of which are Hh target genes, in immortalized HPDE cells as measured by real-time PCR (Fig. 1C). To ensure that the apparent activation of Hh signaling observed in HPDE-c7-KRASV12 cells was caused specifically by activation of the KRAS pathway rather than an indirect effect associated with the transformation of HPDE, we suppressed the oncogenic KRAS activity in HPDE-c7-KRASV12 cells using a specific nontoxic RAS antagonist, FTS, which dislodges RAS from its membrane anchorage domains and accelerates its degradation (37Marom M.

FTS has been shown to act as a functional KRAS inhibitor in human pancreatic cell lines that express activated KRAS (39Weisz B. Giehl K. Gana-Weisz M. Egozi Y. Baruch G. Ben Marciano D. Gierschik P. Kloog Y. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 2579-2588Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 1D, treatment of HPDE-c7-KRASV12 with FTS led to an inhibition of Gli-luciferase and endogenous GLI1 mRNA. Taken together, our studies suggest that KRASV12 specifically activates Hh signaling in HPDE cells as GLI1 is not only a downstream effector but also a direct target gene and a reliable marker of Hh signaling pathway activities (40Kasper M. Regl G. Frischauf A.M. Aberger F. Eur. J. Cancer. 2006; 42: 437-445Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar). Oncogenic KRAS Is Responsible for GLI1 Activation in PDA Cells—To further test whether oncogenic KRAS is essential for GLI1 activation in PDA cells, we knocked down the expression of the oncogenic KRAS in human PDA cell lines (AsPC-1 and Panc-1) that express mutant KRASD12 using RNA interference. A previously reported siRNA duplex that specifically knocks down KRASD12 in AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells was used (41Brunner T.B. Cengel K.A. Hahn S.M. Wu J. Fraker D.L. McKenna W.G. Bernhard E.J. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 8433-8441Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The inactivation of KRAS oncogene by the KRASD12-specific siRNA duplex in AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells led to decreased cellular RAS levels (Fig. 2A). Consistent with the reduced KRAS level, the phospho-MAPK levels were suppressed in KRASD12-knockdown AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells compared with cells treated with the control siRNA, confirming the specificity and effectiveness of KRASD12-siRNA. Gene silencing of KRASD12 in AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells eventually led to growth inhibition and cell death 96 h after siRNA transfection. Therefore, experiments related to KRASD12 siRNA were performed 24 h after transfection when no noticeable difference between control and KRASD12 siRNA-transfected cells could be observed. KRASD12 knockdown by siRNA resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Gli-luciferase activity and endogenous levels of GLI1 mRNA in AsPC-1 (Fig. 2B). Similar results were also observed in Panc-1 cells (Fig. 2C). To exclude the possibility that our observed inactivation of Gli-luciferase by KRASD12-specific siRNA was due to potential off-target effects, we used a PDA cell line, BxPC-3 cells (which does not contain KRAS mutation), to confirm the specificity of KRASD12 siRNA. As expected, the Gli-luciferase activity and GLI1 mRNA level in BxPC-3 cells did not change significantly after introducing KRASD12-specific siRNA (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that effects of KRASD12 siRNA observed in AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells are specific to the KRASD12 mutant allele. Taken together, our data indicate that oncogenic KRAS plays an important role in regulating Hh signaling in PDA cells. RAF/MEK/MAPK, but Not the PI3K/AKT Pathway, Is Required for the KRAS-mediated Activation of Hh Signaling—To further determine which downstream effectors of the oncogene KRAS mediate the activation of Hh signaling, we examined the levels of Hh activity in HPDE-c7-KRASV12 cells in response to specific inhibitors that target the RAS downstream effectors MEK and PI3K. Inhibition of MEK by U0126 (20 μm) and PD98059 (40 μm) led to a significant reduction of Gli-luciferase activity and endogenous GLI1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3A), whereas wortmannin (100 nm), a PI3K-specific inhibitor, had little effect. These results suggested that the RAF/MEK/MAP kinase pathway was directly responsible for the KRAS-mediated activation of Hh signaling in HPDE-c7-KRASV12 cells. The inhibitory effect of U0126 and PD98059 was also observed in PDA cells expressing activating KRAS mutant. When AsPC-1 and Panc-1 cells were treated with the various inhibitors for 24 h, U0126 and PD98059 inhibited Gli1-luciferase expression (Fig. 3B) as well as endogenous GLI1 mRNA levels (Fig. 3C), whereas wortmannin had no effects. To ensure that the apparent non-effect of wortmannin is not due to a lack of efficacy of the compound, we determined the phosphorylation status of MAPK and AKT in Panc-1 cells treated with various pharmacological inhibitors. As shown in Fig. 3D, U0126 and PD98059 significantly suppressed the phosphorylation levels of MAPK. Wortmannin abolished the phosphorylation of Ser-473 of AKT, which is essential for its activation. If the RAF/MEK/MAPK, but not the PI3K/AKT pathway, is indeed responsi"

Accordingly, DNA-photolyase was considered a model system for the light activation process of cryptochromes. In line with this view were recent spectroscopic studies on cryptochromes of the CryDASH subfamily that showed photoreduction of the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) cofactor to its fully reduced form. However, CryDASH members were recently shown to have photolyase activity for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers in single-stranded DNA, which is absent for other members of the cryptochrome/photolyase family. Thus, CryDASH may have functions different from cryptochromes. The photocycle of other members of the cryptochrome family, such as Arabidopsis Cry1 and Cry2, which lack DNA repair activity but control photomorphogenesis and flowering time, remained elusive. Here we have shown that Arabidopsis Cry2 undergoes a photocycle in which semireduced flavin (FADH·) accumulates upon blue light irradiation. Green light irradiation of Cry2 causes a change in the equilibrium of flavin oxidation states and attenuates Cry2-controlled responses such as flowering. These results demonstrate that the active form of Cry2 contains FADH· (whereas catalytically active photolyase requires fully reduced flavin (FADH-)) and suggest that cryptochromes could represent photoreceptors using flavin redox states for signaling differently from DNA-photolyase for photorepair.

The photoreduction of flavin in DNA-photolyase involves several aromatic amino acid residues (mostly tryptophans) that transfer electrons from the protein surface to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which is buried in a U-shaped conformation in the α-helical domain of the protein (13Park H-W.

Indeed, time-resolved ultrafast absorption spectroscopy on Arabidopsis Cry1 showed the transient formation of tryptophan (and tyrosine) radicals (17Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M. Brettel K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) consistent with a photoreduction process similar to DNA-photolyase. In contrast to DNA-photolyase, Arabidopsis Cry1 accumulated semireduced FAD under blue light illumination, an observation that had been noted previously when Cry1 was expressed and purified from insect cells (8Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Schuman Jornes M. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). These results suggested that cryptochromes in their signaling state could carry the flavin cofactor in another redox state than DNA-photolyase in its catalytically active form. To elucidate this possibility, we analyzed the photocycle of Arabidopsis Cry2 in vitro and observed the accumulation of the flavin semiquinone radical under blue light irradiation. This flavin species absorbs green light, in contrast to fully oxidized and fully reduced FAD (18Ehrenberg A. Hemmerich P. Biological Oxidation. 1968; (Singer, T. P., ed) pp. , Interscience Publisher, New York: 239-262Google Scholar). Green light irradiation of Cry2 in vitro caused a change in the equilibrium of the flavin oxidation states associated with a decrease in the level of semireduced FAD and attenuated Cry2-controlled responses such as flowering and the induction of the flowering gene FT. Together these results strongly suggest that the signaling state of Arabidopsis Cry2 contains flavin semiquinone.

All mono- and dichromatic light treatments (blue, 470 ± 10 nm; green, 563 ± 12 nm) were done with a fluence rate of 2 μmol m-2 s-1 applied through double interference filters (Schott, Mainz, Germany). For the determination of the flowering time, plants were shifted back to short day after the treatment with monochromatic light or kept continuously under short day as a control. Flowering time was measured as the number of days from sowing until the first flower of each plant had opened. Cry2 Expression and Spectroscopy—Full-length Arabidopsis Cry2 was expressed as an N-terminal His-tagged fusion in Sf21 insect cells using the baculovirus expression system (Clontech Laboratories/BD Biosciences, Mountain View, CA). Purification was carried out on nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). All purification steps were performed under dim red light. Samples containing Cry2 in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.5 m NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 10 mm EDTA (instead of β-mercaptoethanol) at 10 °C, were illuminated with blue light (450 ± 12 nm; 16 or 50 μmol m-2 s-1 as indicated) and absorption spectra measured every 5 min on a Shimadzu UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV2401 PC, Kyoto, Japan). Green light (559 ± 11 nm, fluence rate 160 μmol m-2 s-1) was applied for the indicated periods of time. During all light treatments, heat emitted from the lamp was blocked by a heat-absorbing filter (KG1, 5 mm, Schott, Mainz, Germany) positioned in a water column with a 5-cm path length. In addition, the temperature of the probe was measured before and after light treatments, and the increase in temperature was found to be <0.1 °C. All experiments were performed under aerobic conditions. Energy fluence rates were determined using a P-2000 optometer combined with a calibrated PD-9306–2 detector (Gigahertz, Puchheim, Germany), and photon fluence rates were calculated from these measurements. EPR Spectroscopy—X-band continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded using a pulsed EPR spectrometer (Bruker Elexsys E580) with a cavity resonator (Bruker SHQE-4122-W1) and helium Cryostat (Oxford CF-910). X-band-pulsed electron nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectra were recorded on the same spectrometer using an ENDOR accessory (Bruker E560-DP), a radio frequency amplifier (Amplifier Research 250A250A), and a dielectric ring ENDOR resonator (Bruker EN4118X-MD-4W1) immersed in a helium gas flow Cryostat (Oxford CF-935). The temperature was regulated to ±0.1 K by a temperature controller (Oxford ITC-503S). The continuous wave EPR spectra were recorded at 120 K with a microwave power of 5.0 μW at a 9.38-GHz microwave frequency with a field modulation amplitude of 0.3 millitesla (at 100 kHz modulation frequency). For Davies-type ENDOR spectroscopy, a microwave pulse sequence π-T-π/2-τ-π with 64- and 128-ns π/2 and π pulses, respectively, and a radio frequency pulse of 10 μs duration starting 1 μs after the first microwave pulse were used. The pulse separations T and τ between the microwave pulses were selected to be 13 μs and 500 ns, respectively. To avoid saturation effects due to long relaxation times, the entire pulse pattern was repeated with a low repetition frequency of 200 Hz. Spectra were taken at a magnetic field of 345.7 milliteslas and a microwave frequency of 9.71 GHz. Sf21 insect cells expressing N-terminal His-tagged Cry2 and control Sf21 cells were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline supplemented with 50% (v/v) glycerol in the dark. Aliquots were transferred into EPR quartz tubes (3 mm inner diameter) and illuminated for different times at 290 K with blue light (Halolux 30HL, Streppel, Wermelskirchen-Tente, Germany) using a 420-470-nm band filter (Schott, Mainz, Germany). Samples were then frozen rapidly under illumination in liquid nitrogen and stored therein. Gene Expression Studies—Total RNA was extracted from the aerial part of seedlings using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). cDNA synthesis was performed with superscript RNase H-reverse transcriptase and oligo(dT) (Invitrogen). Real time PCR was performed using SYBR green I (Roche Applied Science), Platinum TaqDNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with an icycler machine (Bio-Rad). Fragments of FT and UBQ10 were amplified with the following primers: FT (5′-CCCTGCTACAACTGGAACAACC-3′, 5′-CTGTTTGCCTGCCAAGCTGTCG-3′); and UBQ (5′-GCAAGAGTTCTGCCATCCTCC-3′, 5′-CGGGAAAGACGATTACTCTTGAGG-3′). Data treatment was done as described previously (22Pfaffl M.W. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 2002-2007Crossref Scopus (25578) Google Scholar). Gene expression data were represented relative to the maximum value among all data sets after normalization to the UBQ control. Immunoblot Analysis—Total protein extracts from 7-day-old Arabidopsis wild type or cry2 mutant seedlings were isolated and used for ECL immunoblot analysis as described previously (23Kleiner O. Kircher S. Harter K. Batschauer A. Plant J. 1999; 19: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated with CRY2 antibodies and reprobed with an antibody against HSC70 as a control for equal loading and transfer. The density of the bands was scanned to obtain quantitative data. Statistical Analysis—Data from flowering time were treated with analysis of variance and post hoc tests (Tukey’s honestly significant difference test) using the program Statistica 6.0. To investigate light effects on the redox state of FAD in Cry2, we expressed full-length protein in Sf21 insect cells, purified the protein close to homogeneity (Fig. 1A), and confirmed its identity by MALDI-TOF MS. Approximately 80% of the purified Cry2 contained the FAD chromophore, and from our isolation procedure, we conclude that most, if not all, of the expressed Cry2 protein is soluble (data not shown). Continuous treatment of the sample with monochromatic (450 nm) blue light under aerobic conditions led to a light-induced absorbance change with a strong decrease in the blue absorption and a concurrent increase of the absorption at wavelengths >500 nm (Fig. 1B), indicative for the formation of semireduced FADH·. Blue light-induced formation of semireduced flavin was described previously also for Arabidopsis Cry1 (8Lin C. Robertson D.E. Ahmad M. Raibekas A.A. Schuman Jornes M. Dutton P.L. Cashmore A.R. Science. 1995; 269: 968-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 17Giovani B. Byrdin M. Ahmad M. Brettel K. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2003; 10: 489-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Cry1, however, requires anaerobic conditions for efficient photoreduction. Significant FADH· accumulation can be observed within minutes after the onset of blue irradiation, and the reaction was nearly completed with little fully oxidized FAD left after 5 min (Fig. 1B). The half-life of oxidized FAD in Cry2 under these conditions is 30 ± 10 s (supplemental Fig. 1A). Reducing the fluence rate from 50 to 16 μmol m-2 s-1 had only a small effect on the final level of formed semireduced FADH· (Fig. 1C), indicating that these fluence rates were already saturating for photoconversion. Subsequent incubation of the photo-reduced sample in darkness led to dark recovery of the fully oxidized form within ∼15 min (Fig. 1D) with a half-life of the semiquinone form of 250 ± 40 s (supplemental Fig. 1B), indicating that semireduced Cry2 is maintained in vitro only under continuous blue light irradiation. In contrast to fully oxidized FAD, semireduced FADH· absorbs at wavelengths >500 nm (18Ehrenberg A. Hemmerich P. Biological Oxidation. 1968; (Singer, T. P., ed) pp. , Interscience Publisher, New York: 239-262Google Scholar). We therefore evaluated whether the ratio between the fully oxidized and semireduced flavin in Cry2 is altered when blue (450 nm) and green light (559 nm) are applied simultaneously. Comparison of Fig. 1, panels C and E, shows that there is a shift in the equilibrium of the flavin species with a decrease in the level of semireduced flavin under green light illumination (supplemental Fig. 2). This effect was also observed by Gindt et al. (24Gindt Y.M. Vollenbroeck E. Westphal K. Sackett H. Sancar A. Babcock G.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 3857-3866Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) in Escherichia coli DNA-photolyase. Because in the double beam experiment the total fluence rate applied was higher than in those experiments where the sample was irradiated only with blue or green light, we performed a control double beam experiment in which the Cry2 sample was irradiated simultaneously with blue (450 nm) and red light (682 nm) with the same fluence rates as for the blue plus green light treatment. Red light had no effect on the equilibrium of the flavin species as expected, because neither the fully oxidized nor the semiquinone form of FAD absorb in this wavelength region (supplemental Fig. 2). Decomposition of the UV-visible spectra into components of all three flavin redox states allowed a reliable determination of only those species contributing >10% of the total flavin content. The amount of fully reduced flavin upon blue or green light treatment in Cry2 remained below this threshold. Because of the small extinction coefficient in the visible range, however, some formation of fully reduced FAD in Cry2 cannot be excluded (extinction coefficient >400 nm is below 3000 m-1 cm-1). To confirm that the observed light-induced absorbance change is caused by the reduction of FAD, fluorescence emission spectra were recorded. The peak emission at 520 nm and its decrease after blue light treatment clearly shows that only FAD and no other cofactor produces this light-induced absorbance change and that the fully oxidized FAD is reduced by blue light treatment (supplemental Fig. 3). Furthermore, EPR measurements were performed using Sf21 cells expressing Cry2. The spectra (see Fig. 2A) show the formation of a paramagnetic species with an EPR signal centered at g≈2 and a peak-to-peak line width of 1.75 milliteslas. This signal reaches its maximum intensity after ∼12 min of blue light illumination and completely decays overnight in the dark at 277 K. To characterize this signal, X-band-pulsed ENDOR spectroscopy was applied (Fig. 2B). The observed spectrum is very similar to that of the flavin semiquinone radical observed in DNA-photolyase (25Weber S. Kay C.W.M. Bacher A. Richter G. Bittl R. Chem. PhysChem. 2005; 6: 292-299Google Scholar) and, in particular, found for purified Cry1 and in whole Cry1-expressing insect cells (26Bouly J.P. Schleicher E. Dionisio-Sese M. Vandenbussche F. van der Straeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittl R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). Together with our companion study on Cry1 (26Bouly J.P. Schleicher E. Dionisio-Sese M. Vandenbussche F. van der Straeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittl R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), these experiments are the first ENDOR characterization of a protein cofactor in whole cells of an overexpression system to arise from the formation of FADH· and identify the absorbance changes in isolated Cry2 and the EPR signal in intact Sf21 cells expressing Cry2 upon blue light illumination. In summary, the UV-visible and EPR measurements show that Cry2 undergoes a blue light-induced photoreduction in which the formation of fully reduced flavin is, in contrast to DNA-photolyases and other DASH cryptochromes, dramatically reduced. To determine whether our spectroscopic data are of biological relevance, we analyzed the effects of blue and green light on responses that are controlled by Cry2. Flowering time of Arabidopsis is regulated by day length. Long day conditions promote flowering of wild type plants, whereas the cry2 mutant flowers late both under long day and short day conditions (27Guo H. Yang H. Mockler T.C. Lin C. Science. 1998; 279: 1360-1363Crossref PubMed Scopus (615) Google Scholar). Arabidopsis wild type and cry2 mutant plants were grown for 14 days under short day followed by continuous monochromatic light treatments for 72 h and shifted back afterward to short day conditions. Fluence rates of monochromatic lights used in these experiments did not induce strong Cry2 degradation (28Lin C. Yang H. Guo H. Mockler T. Chen J. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2686-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Wild type plants kept continuously under short day started flowering after 45.2 ± 2.5 days (Fig. 3). Blue light-treated wild type plants flowered ∼10 days earlier (35.1 ± 2.6 days), whereas treatment with green light alone had essentially no effect on flowering time (46.5 ± 2.1 days), as already described previously, based on night break experiments with Sinapis alba (29Hanke J. Hartmann K. Mohr H. Planta. 1969; 86: 235-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Dichromatic light treatments with blue plus green light led to a significant delay in flowering (41.5 ± 2.3) compared with plants that received blue light alone (Fig. 3). Because the cry2 mutant plants did not show any significant response to the same light treatments (Fig. 3), we conclude that the observed promotion of flowering by blue light is mediated by Cry2 and that this effect can be reverted, at least in part, by simultaneous green light treatment. Cry2 plays a key role in transmitting the blue light signal to flowering by its effect on stabilizing the product of the flowering gene CONSTANS. High levels of CONSTANS induce the expression of the downstream gene FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) only in the presence of light through the action of Cry2 (30Imaizumi T. Tran H.G. Swartz T.E. Briggs W.R. Kay S.A. Nature. 2003; 426: 302-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (451) Google Scholar, 31Suárez-López P. Wheatley K. Robson F. Hitoshi O. Valverde F. Coupland G. Nature. 2001; 410: 1116-1120Crossref PubMed Scopus (1070) Google Scholar, 32Yanovsky M.J. Kay S.A. Nature. 2002; 419: 308-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar, 33El-Assal S.E.D. Alonso-Blanco C. Peeters A.J.M. Wagemaker C. Weller J.L. Koornneef M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar). We therefore analyzed how the observed promotion of flowering by blue light and the inhibitory effect of green light affect FT expression. Plants grown under short day conditions were given monochromatic light for 8 h at the end of the short day (day extension), and FT transcript levels were quantified by real time PCR. As shown in Fig. 4, blue light promotes FT expression in wild type plants. Similarly to flowering time, green light alone had no effect on FT transcript levels, but given simultaneously with blue light, it reduces the strong blue light effect. To confirm that the effects of blue and green light on the transcript level of FT are indeed caused by Cry2, we quantified FT transcripts in the cry2 mutant under the same light conditions (Fig. 4). Indeed, the FT transcript level remained low in the cry2 mutant under all light treatments, indicating that Cry2 (but no other photoreceptor) is the blue/green photoreversible pigment that induces FT expression. Cry2 is degraded in vivo when irradiated with blue light, most likely resulting from direct absorption of light by Cry2 followed by proteasomal degradation (28Lin C. Yang H. Guo H. Mockler T. Chen J. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 2686-2690Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar, 34Shalitin D. Yang H. Mockler T.C. Maymon M. Guo H. Whitelam G.C. Lin C. Nature. 2002; 417: 763-767Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). To determine whether the above described photoreversible responses were also reflected in the stability of Cry2, we analyzed Cry2 protein levels under the same conditions as for the quantification of FT transcripts. Irradiation with weak monochromatic blue light (2 μmol m-2 s-1) caused only a minor reduction in the Cry2 protein level to 73 ± 8% of the dark control, as expected (Fig. 5), whereas green light and blue plus green light given together caused no reduction effect in Cry2 protein levels (Fig. 5). Repetitive 3-min pulses of blue light (447 nm, 10 μmol m-2 s-1) applied to etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings followed by 3-min dark intervals given over 48 min caused a strong degradation of the Cry2 protein. When the dark periods were replaced by green light (559 nm, 10 μmol m-2 s-1), Cry2 degradation was essentially abolished (26Bouly J.P. Schleicher E. Dionisio-Sese M. Vandenbussche F. van der Straeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittl R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), demonstrating again that Cry2 itself is affected by green light and that no other photoreceptor is involved in the responses analyzed here. Action spectroscopy on Cry-regulated processes in plants shows a broad maximum in the blue region resembling the absorption spectrum of a fully oxidized flavin in Cry (35Ahmad M. Grancher N. Heil M. Black R.C. Giovani B. Galland P. Lardemer D. Plant Physiol. 2002; 129: 774-785Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar) that represents most likely the ground state of these photoreceptors. However, it remained unknown which flavin oxidation state is present in the signaling state of cryptochromes. In analogy to the structurally related DNA-photolyase enzymes, it was hypothesized that cryptochromes could also use the fully reduced FAD cofactor for signaling either through intramolecular electron transfer inducing conformational changes within the protein moiety of the photoreceptor or by transfer of an electron to a substrate or signaling partner (4Brautigam C.A. Smith B.S. Ma Z. Palnitkar M. Tomchick D.R. Machius M. Deisenhofer J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 12142-12147Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 7Malhotra K. Kim S-T.

Science. 1999; 284: 760-765Crossref PubMed Scopus (800) Google Scholar). Indeed, irradiation of V. cholerae Cry1 and Arabidopsis Cry3 with blue light leads to the accumulation of fully reduced flavin in vitro (10Saxena C. Wang H.Y. Kavakli H. Sancar A. Zhong D.P. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005; 127: 7984-7985Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 11Song S.H. Dick B. Penzkofer A. Pokorny R. Batschauer A. Essen L-O. J. Photochem. Photobiol. B Biol. 2006; 85: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). However, V. cholerae Cry1 and Arabidopsis Cry3 belong to a separate cryptochrome group, the CryDASH subfamily (which was shown most recently to have photolyase activity for single-stranded DNA (12Selby C.P. Sancar A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2006; 103: 17696-17700Crossref PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar)), and has evolved independently from the previously identified plant and animal cryptochromes (36Daiyasu H. Ishikawa T. Kuma K. Iwai S. Todo T. Toh H. Genes Cells. 2004; 9: 479-495Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Our results from in vitro and in vivo studies suggest that Cry2 undergoes a photocycle in which fully oxidized FAD represents the ground state and semireduced FADH·, the signaling state of this photoreceptor. This conclusion is based on our spectroscopic studies, which show significant accumulation of flavin semiquinone upon blue light treatment. Green light, which is efficiently absorbed by the semireduced flavin (18Ehrenberg A. Hemmerich P. Biological Oxidation. 1968; (Singer, T. P., ed) pp. , Interscience Publisher, New York: 239-262Google Scholar), reverses this process likely by the formation of a fully reduced intermediate that is rapidly reoxidized. The long known reversion of blue light-induced responses by green light, such as the leaflet closure in Oxalis (37Bjoörkman O. Powles S.B. Carnegie Inst. Wash. Yb. 1981; 80: 59-62Google Scholar), can now be explained by the action of a single flavin receptor. However, our results do not preclude the existence of a unique green light-sensing photoreceptor, and the more recently described enhancement of the hypocotyl growth rate and repression of chloroplast gene expression by a pulse of green light (38Folta K.M. Plant Physiol. 2004; 135: 1407-1416Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 39Dhingra A. Bies D.H. Lehner K.R. Folta K.M. Plant Physiol. 2006; 142: 1256-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) seem not to be caused by the inactivation of the cryptochrome signaling state, because these responses were the same in wild type and cry mutant plants. The inhibitory effect of green light on the responses analyzed here (flower induction, FT expression, Cry2 degradation) is seen, however, only when Cry2 is present (no effect in the cry2 mutant) and when Cry2 is activated by simultaneous blue light irradiation or by a pulse of blue light that is applied directly before the pulse of green light. Together these data strongly suggest that green light inactivates Cry2 directly. Studies on stomatal blue light responses have shown green light reversion of the blue light-stimulated opening of stomata (40Talbott L.D. Hammad J.W. Harn L.C. Nguyen V.H. Patel J. Zeiger E. Plant Cell Physiol. 2006; 47: 332-339Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). In this case, the npq1 mutant that is not synthesizing the putative blue light receptor zeaxanthin does neither respond to blue nor to green light in contrast to the phot1/phot2 double mutant. It is therefore possible that blue light photoreceptors, which have no flavin chromophore, are also inactivated by green light as proposed previously by Frechilla et al. (41Frechilla S. Talbott L.D. Zeiger E. Plant Cell Physiol. 2004; 45: 1709-1714Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Because cryptochromes also regulate stomatal opening (42Mao J. Zhang Y.C. Sang Y. Li Q.H. Yang H.Q. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 12270-12275Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar), several blue light photoreceptors involved in the same response could be affected by green light. The inhibitory effect of green light on Cry2 activity seems to conflict with data showing an enhanced hypocotyl inhibition response to the green light of tobacco seedlings that overexpress Arabidopsis Cry1 (43Lin C. Ahmad M. Gordon D. Cashmore A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8423-8427Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). However, broadband (490–570 nm) green light was used in the prior study that extends into the region of Cry absorption in its fully oxidized state (see Fig. 1), in contrast to the narrow bandwidth green light (559 ± 11 nm) applied here to excite specifically the semireduced flavin in Cry2. There are many examples for co-action of photoreceptors in plants. For example, phytochrome B acts antagonistically to Cry2 in flower induction (33El-Assal S.E.D. Alonso-Blanco C. Peeters A.J.M. Wagemaker C. Weller J.L. Koornneef M. Plant Physiol. 2003; 133: 1-13Crossref Google Scholar, 44Mockler T.C. Guo H. Yang H. Duong H. Lin C. Development. 1999; 126: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), raising the question as to whether the inhibitory effect of green light on the flower and FT induction that is described here could be mediated by phytochrome B. We consider this possibility unlikely, because the continuous blue light irradiation with λmax at 470 nm and a fluence rate of 2 μmol m-2 s-1 already establishes a calculated Pfr/Ptot ratio of 45% (45Mancinelli A.L. Kendrick R.E. Kronenberg G.H.M. Photomorphogenesis in Plants. 1994: 211-269Google Scholar). Analysis of floral induction in the phyB mutant plants grown under the identical light conditions that we used for wild type and the cry2 mutant (see “Experimental Procedures”) showed an early flowering phenotype under long day and short day conditions as well as under short days interrupted by continuous blue, green, or blue plus green light (data not shown). This result is in accordance with the published data (44Mockler T.C. Guo H. Yang H. Duong H. Lin C. Development. 1999; 126: 2073-2082Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) showing early flowering of the phyB mutant under short day and long day conditions and the resulting model showing that Cry2 suppresses the inhibitory effect of phytochrome B on flower induction. In addition, we consider the fact that a pulse of green light given after a pulse of blue light prevents the blue light-induced Cry2 degradation to the same extent as when blue and green light were given simultaneously to be a strong argument against the participation of another photoreceptor in the green light responses described here. This behavior resembles the photoconversion of the physiologically active Pfr form of phytochrome by a pulse of far red light to the Pr form (46Schaöfer E. Nagy F. Schaöfer E. Nagy F. Photomorphogenesis in Plants and Bacteria. 2006: 1-12Google Scholar). The findings presented here, in conjunction with our companion study on Cry1 (26Bouly J.P. Schleicher E. Dionisio-Sese M. Vandenbussche F. van der Straeten D. Bakrim N. Meier S. Batschauer A. Galland P. Bittl R. Ahmad M. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 9383-9391Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar), strongly indicate that the photochemistry of the plant cryptochromes and that of photolyase are different, because photolyase requires fully reduced FADH- for electron transfer to its substrate (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). In addition, photolyase can photoreduce oxidized FAD in a process called photoactivation (2Sancar A. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2203-2237Crossref PubMed Scopus (1032) Google Scholar). It seems that cryptochromes have conserved the photoactivation part of the photolyase photochemistry but accumulate the flavin radical instead of fully reduced flavin and use this process for signaling, most likely by conformational changes in their C-terminal output domains that are sufficient for Cry signaling (47Yang H-Q.

(2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 41725–41731). Data base analysis indicates that human Set1A protein shares 39% identity with an uncharacterized SET domain protein, KIAA1076, hereafter denoted Set1B. Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry reveal that Set1B associates with a ∼450 kDa complex that contains all five non-catalytic components of the Set1A complex, including CFP1, Rbbp5, Ash2, Wdr5, and Wdr82. These data reveal two human protein complexes that differ only in the identity of the catalytic histone methyltransferase. In vitro assays demonstrate that the Set1B complex is a histone methyltransferase that produces trimethylated histone H3 at Lys4. Both Set1A and Set1B are widely expressed. Inducible expression of the carboxyl terminus of either Set1A or Set1B decreases steady-state levels of both endogenous Set1A and Set1B protein, but does not alter the expression of the non-catalytic components of the Set1 complexes. A 123-amino acid fragment upstream of the Set1A SET domain is necessary for interaction with CFP1, Ash2, Rbbp5, and Wdr5. This protein domain is also required to mediate feedback inhibition of Set1A and Set1B expression, which is a consequence of reduced Set1A and Set1B stability when not associated with the methyltransferase complex. Confocal microscopy reveals that Set1A and Set1B each localize to a largely non-overlapping set of euchromatic nuclear speckles, suggesting that Set1A and Set1B each bind to a unique set of target genes and thus make non-redundant contributions to the epigenetic control of chromatin structure and gene expression. We previously identified a mammalian Set1A complex analogous to the yeast Set1/COMPASS histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex (Lee, J.-H., and Skalnik, D. G. (2005) J. Biol.

Covalent modification of histone proteins, including methylation, acetylation, ubiquitination, and phosphorylation, confers critical epigenetic information that controls chromatin structure and regulation of gene expression (1Shilatifard A.

A large number of histone methyltransferases contain SET domains and catalyze the addition of methyl groups to lysine residues. Prominent sites of mammalian histone methylation include histone H3-Lys4, which is associated with euchromatin, and methylation of histone H3-Lys9, which is associated with heterochromatin. The yeast Set1 protein is the sole yeast histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase and associates with a multimeric complex denoted COMPASS (5Miller T. Krogan N.J. Dover J. Erdjument-Bromage H. Tempst P.

Set1 is recruited by the RNA polymerase II machinery to actively expressed genes, and subsequent trimethylation of histone H3-Lys4 at these sites provides a localized mark of recent transcriptional activity (5Miller T.

Although yeast express only a single histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase, mammalian cells contain approximately 12 histone methyltransferases that exhibit this specificity (10Glaser S. Schaft J. Lubitz S. Vintersten K. van der Hoeven F. Tufteland K.R. Aasland R. Anastassiadis K. Ang S.-L. Stewart A.F. Development. 2006; 133: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The Set1-like family of histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferases includes Set1A, MLL, MLL2, MLL3, and MLL4 (10Glaser S. Schaft J. Lubitz S. Vintersten K. van der Hoeven F. Tufteland K.R. Aasland R. Anastassiadis K. Ang S.-L. Stewart A.F. Development. 2006; 133: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Similar to the yeast Set1 protein, human MLL is localized to the 5′-end of actively expressed genes (11Guenther M.G. Jenner R.G. Chevalier B. Nakamura T. Croce C.M. Canaani E. Young R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 8603-8608Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar). A major unanswered question concerns the significance of the complexity of mammalian histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferases. Although generally widely expressed, these mammalian methyltransferases provide non-redundant functions, as loss of a single member of the family can lead to disease or death. For example, chromosomal translocations involving the gene encoding the MLL histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase are frequently found in leukemia (12Domer P.H. Fakharzadeh S.S. Chen C.S. Jockel J.

It is likely that non-redundant function of each histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase is a result of distinct target gene specificity, but the nature of these gene targets and the mechanisms utilized to achieve unique subnuclear targeting of each methyltransferase are largely unknown. We previously cloned CXXC finger protein 1 (CFP1) 3The abbreviations used are: CFP, CXXC finger protein; aa, amino acid; ES, embryonic stem; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HEK, human embryonic kidney; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; RT, reverse transcriptase; GST, glutathione S-transferase; PIPES, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid.

Biol. 2000; 20: 2108-2121Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), the mammalian homologue of yeast Spp1, a component of the Set1/COMPASS histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase complex. Biochemical purification of the human CFP1 complex revealed it to be analogous to the yeast COMPASS complex. The CFP1 complex contains human homologues of the COMPASS complex, including Set1A, Wdr5, Ash2, Rbbp5, and Wdr82 (previously denoted hSwd2) (21Lee J.-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41725-41731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). The human Set1A-CFP1 complex exhibits histone H3-Lys4 methyltransferase activity in vitro. Data base analysis reveals a predicted human protein that exhibits high homology to the human Set1A protein. The purpose of the studies reported here was to examine whether this novel protein, denoted Set1B, is a functional histone methyltransferase, whether it associates with a complex similar to COMPASS, and to assess possible functional interactions between these two Set1-like enzymes. The data presented demonstrates that Set1B associates with a complex indistinguishable from the Set1A complex (except for the identity of the catalytic methyltransferase), and that these histone methyltransferase complexes exhibit both overlapping and non-redundant properties. Cell Lines—Human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293) were cultured and transfected as previously described (22Lee J.-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42259-42267Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar), and transfected cells were selected in 200 μg/ml hygromycin B. Established stably transfected cell lines were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 50 μg/ml hygromycin B. A T-REx HEK293 cell line (Invitrogen) that constitutively expresses the tetracycline repressor was maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium supplemented with 10% bovine calf serum and 5 μg/ml blasticidin. To establish inducible cell lines, T-REx HEK293 cells were transfected, selected in 200 μg/ml hygromycin B and 5 μg/ml blasticidin, and maintained in media containing 50 μg/ml hygromycin B and 5 μg/ml blasticidin. Mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were cultured and differentiated as previously described (23Lee J.-H. Hart S.R.L. Skalnik D.G. Genesis. 2004; 38: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Plasmid Construction—Expression vectors carrying human Set1A, CFP1, Ash2, Rbbp5, Wdr5, and Wdr82 cDNAs were prepared using the pcDNA3.1/Hygro vector that carries an amino-terminal FLAG epitope, as previously described (21Lee J.-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41725-41731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Various deletion constructs of human Set1A were subcloned using the PCR and restriction enzyme digestions into the pcDNA5/TO vector (Invitrogen), which encodes an amino-terminal FLAG epitope. A partial cDNA of human Set1B (KIAA1076, accession number AB028999) was obtained from the Kazusa DNA Research Institute. The cDNA encoding amino acid (aa) residues 1120–1923 was subcloned into pcDNA5/TO vector, which encodes an amino-terminal FLAG epitope. The nucleotide sequence of all plasmid constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing. The nucleotide sequences of oligonucleotide PCR primers are available upon request. Purification of the Set1B Complex and Identification of Its Components—A T-REx HEK293 cell line that inducibly expresses FLAG-Set1B (aa 1120–1923) was treated with 1 μg/ml of doxycycline for 4 days to induce protein expression. Nuclear extracts were prepared from cells (5 ml cell pellet volume) carrying the FLAG-Set1B or parental expression vector and used for FLAG immunoprecipitation as described (21Lee J.-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41725-41731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Bound proteins were eluted twice with 0.5 ml of binding buffer (10 mm PIPES, pH 7.0, 300 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, supplemented with the protease inhibitors leupeptin, aprotinin, pepstatin (1 μg/ml each), and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5% Triton X-100) containing 250 μg/ml FLAG peptide. The eluants were combined and loaded onto 10–50% sucrose gradients and subjected to centrifugation at 38,000 × g for 18 h using an SW41 rotor (Beckman). Five-hundred-milliliter fractions were collected. Molecular weight markers were applied to a parallel gradient, and their migration was analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. Fractions enriched for Set1B were identified by Western blotting analysis and were pooled (fractions 11–14). The pooled sample was then subjected to a second round of FLAG immunoprecipitation. Bound proteins were eluted twice with 0.25 ml of binding buffer containing 250 μg/ml FLAG peptide, and the eluant was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra-4 concentrator (100 kDa cutoff). The sample was denatured and separated by 4–12% SDS-PAGE. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue or subjected to silver staining. Protein bands were excised and processed for in-gel trypsin digestion using standard protocols. Peptides were extracted with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid for 30 min at 37 °C and injected onto a 75 μm × 5-cm C-18 reverse-phase column (Waters, Picofrit column), and were eluted with a 5–45% acetonitrile gradient developed over 30 min at a flow rate of 250 nl/min using an Agilent 1100 series nanopump. The column was interfaced with a LTQ ion trap mass spectrometer (Thermo), and data were collected in the triple-play mode. MS/MS spectra were searched against the IPI human protein data base using SEQUEST. Generation of Polyclonal Antisera—Anti-Set1A, anti-Set1B, anti-CFP1, anti-Wdr5, and anti-Wdr82 antisera were generated in rabbits (Proteintech Group) by using as antigens a recombinant GST-Set1A fragment (aa 258–458), recombinant GST-Set1B fragment (aa 1444–1596), recombinant GST-CFP1 fragment (aa 213–367), recombinant GST-Wdr5 fragment (aa 1–334), and recombinant GST-Wdr82 fragment (aa 1–173). Each human antigen was expressed in Escherichia coli and affinity purified. Goat antisera recognizing Set1A was also similarly generated against a recombinant GST-Set1A fragment (aa 795–993) (Proteintech Group). Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting Analysis—Nuclear extracts were incubated with anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma) for 3 h and extensively washed. Bound proteins were eluted with SDS sample buffer. Anti-FLAG (mouse monoclonal M2) antibody was obtained from Sigma, anti-Ash2 (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-Rbbp5 (rabbit polyclonal) antisera were obtained from Bethyl Laboratories, anti-Brg1 (rabbit polyclonal) antiserum was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, anti-H3K4me2 (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-H3K9me2 (rabbit polyclonal) antisera were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, and anti-H3K4me3 (rabbit polyclonal) and anti-histone H3 (rabbit polyclonal) antisera were obtained from Abcam. Pulse-Chase Analysis of Protein Stability—T-REx HEK293 cell lines carrying empty vector or FLAG-Set1A fragment (aa 1082–1707) were treated with doxycycline for 4 days. Cells were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and T-REx medium lacking methionine and cysteine, and were incubated in medium lacking methionine and cysteine for 15 min. Cells were then metabolically labeled for 45 min in medium containing 0.1 mCi/ml [35S]Met/Cys mixture (EasyTag Expres35S protein labeling mix, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Cells were rinsed and incubated with medium containing excess cold methionine and cysteine for the indicated time points. Whole cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation by anti-Set1A (Bethyl Laboratories, catalog number BL1193) and anti-Set1B antibodies using a rabbit IgG TrueBlot kit (eBioscience). As demonstrated in Fig. 6C, anti-Set1A antibody recognizes both endogenous Set1A and FLAG-Set1A fragment (aa 1082–1707). Immunoprecipitates were denatured and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The gel was dried and radioactivity was quantitated by phosphorimager analysis (Bio-Rad Personal FX System). Histone Methyltransferase Assay—Histone methyltransferase assays were performed as described previously (21Lee J.-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41725-41731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 24Strahl B.D. Ohba R. Cook R.G. Allis C.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14967-14972Crossref PubMed Scopus (413) Google Scholar). Either 10 μg of purified core histones (Upstate Biotechnology) or 2 μg of recombinant human histone H3 purified from E. coli (Upstate Biotechnology) were used for methyltransferase reactions. Reaction products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Blue staining and fluorography. To assess methyltransferase specificity, reaction products were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and analyzed by Western blotting using modification-specific antisera. Analysis of Set1A and Set1B Expression—Total RNA was isolated from undifferentiated ES cells, differentiated embryoid bodies (5 and 10 days following the removal of leukemia inhibitory factor), and HEK293, HEL, K562, Jurkat, and HeLa cells using TriReagent solution (Molecular Research Center) per the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. Total RNA (5 μg) was reverse transcribed using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Roche) at 42 °C for 60 min. Single-stranded cDNA (0.1 μg) was amplified in a 50-μl reaction mixture that included 0.2 mm of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 50 pmol of sense and antisense primers, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Roche) in buffer supplied by the manufacturer. Samples were heat denatured at 94 °C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles at 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, 72 °C for 1 min, and finally 10 min at 72 °C. Amplified DNA was subjected to restriction enzyme digestion and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis along with the undigested amplified DNA. PCR primers were selected that amplify both Set1A and Set1B cDNA. Human PCR products were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion with PmlI, which does not cleave the Set1A PCR product but generates 189- and 261-bp fragments of the Set1B PCR product. Murine PCR products were subjected to restriction enzyme digestion with AflIII, which does not cleave the Set1A PCR product but produces a 190-bp doublet product from the Set1B PCR product. Plasmids containing human and murine Set1A and Set1B cDNA were used as controls for amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. Primer pairs were as follows: murine Set1, 5′-AACCAGCTCAAGTTTCG-3′ and 5′-GGGAACTTGTAGTCGTA-3; human Set1, 5′-AGATGACCATCCTGTATGACA-3′ and 5′-TCCGGAACTTGAGCTGGTTGA-3′; human glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), 5′-ACAGTCCATGCCATCACTGCCACTC-3′ and 5′-CCAGCCCCAGCATCAAAGGTGG-3′; murine Oct4, 5′-GGCGTTCTCTTTGGAAAGGTGTTC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAACCACATCCTTCTCT-3′; and murine HPRT, 5′-CACAGGACTAGAACACCTGC-3′ and 5′-GCTGGTGAAAAGGACCTCT-3′. Relative Set1A and Set1B gene expression in murine tissues was determined by quantitative RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from mouse tissues and cDNA was prepared as described above. TaqMan gene expression assays containing a primer set and probe (FAM fluorescent reporter dye) were purchased from PE Applied Biosystems. Primer pairs were located in two different exons to avoid amplification of any contaminating genomic DNA for Set1A (Exon 6–7, catalog number Mm00626143_m1) and Set1B (Exon 5–6, catalog number Mm00616971_m1). Mouse GAPDH (catalog number 4352932E) served as an endogenous control. An Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-Time PCR System was used to detect PCR products following a standard amplification protocol recommended by the manufacturer. The comparative CT method was used to determine relative gene expression for each gene compared with the GAPDH control, which was then averaged over three independent experiments. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—HEK293 cells were seeded onto coverglass at 2–5 × 104 cells/well in a 24-well dish and cultured for 24 h. Cells were fixed with 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS and then permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. Cells were then incubated for 1 h in a blocking solution (PBS containing 2.5% normal bovine serum and 0.2% Tween 20). Anti-Set1A goat IgG (1:250) and anti-Set1B rabbit IgG (1:250) was added and incubated for 2 h. Cells were washed three times with PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20. Bovine anti-goat IgG-Texas Red and bovine anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate (2 μg/ml in blocking solution) were added and incubated for 1 h. Cells were washed three times and nuclei were counterstained with 0.1 μg/ml 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole in PBS for 5 min followed by washing with PBS. Cells were mounted with 10 μl of Fluoromount G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and scanned with a Zeiss LSM 510 laser scanning confocal microscope. Confocal microscopy was performed at the Indiana Center for Biological Microscopy at the Indiana University School of Medicine. KIAA1076 Is Highly Homologous to Set1A—We previously reported that the human Set1A complex is analogous to the yeast Set1-COMPASS complex (21Lee J.-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol.

Several mammalian proteins exhibit significant similarity to the yeast Set1 protein, including Set1A (25Wysocka J. Myers M.P. Laherty C.D. Eisenmann R.N. Herr W.

Data base analysis indicates that yeast Set1 is most closely related with human Set1A and the uncharacterized KIAA1076 protein (10Glaser S. Schaft J. Lubitz S. Vintersten K. van der Hoeven F. Tufteland K.R. Aasland R. Anastassiadis K. Ang S.-L. Stewart A.F. Development. 2006; 133: 1423-1432Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Hereafter, we will refer to KIAA1076 as Set1B. Human Set1A and Set1B proteins share 35 and 37% identity to yeast Set1, respectively, and human Set1A and Set1B proteins exhibit 39% identity and 56% similarity (Fig. 1). Human Set1A and Set1B proteins are 85% identical and 97% similar throughout the catalytic SET and post-SET domains (Set1A residues 1563–1707), 60% identical and 78% similar throughout the region upstream of the SET domain (N-SET domain, Set1A residues 1414–1562), 46% identical and 66% similar in a central region (Set1A residues 786–916), and 61% identical and 83% similar throughout an NH2-terminal region that includes the RNA recognition motif domain (Set1A residues 85–173) (7Roguev A.

Set1A additionally contains an HCF-1 binding motif that interacts with HCF-1 in vivo (25Wysocka J. Myers M.P. Laherty C.D. Eisenmann R.N. Herr W. Genes Dev. 2003; 17: 896-911Crossref PubMed Scopus (320) Google Scholar), but Set1B lacks this HCF-1 binding motif domain. The extensive homology between Set1A and Set1B, particularly throughout the SET domain, suggests that Set1B functions as a histone methyltransferase. Identification of the Set1B Complex—Sucrose gradient equilibrium centrifugation was performed to analyze the size of the native Set1B complex, and to compare it with the Set1A complex. Nuclear extracts isolated from cells expressing FLAG-CFP1, a component of the Set1A complex (21Lee J.-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41725-41731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), were prepared and subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation. Bound proteins were eluted with FLAG peptide and separated on a 10–50% sucrose gradient, and gradient fractions were analyzed by Western blotting. Set1B and Set1A proteins were both co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-CFP1 and co-migrate at ∼450 kDa (Fig. 2A). Because the carboxyl-terminal SET domain of the MLL protein interacts with three protein components of the Set1A-CFP1 complex (Ash2, Rbbp5, and Wdr5) (26Yokoyama A. Wang Z. Wysocka J. Sanyal M.

Biol. 2006; 13: 713-719Crossref PubMed Scopus (569) Google Scholar), we reasoned that the highly conserved carboxyl terminus of Set1B interacts with components of its cognate complex. The carboxyl-terminal region of Set1B (aa 1120–1923), containing an amino-terminal FLAG epitope, was conditionally expressed in T-REx HEK293 cells. To purify Set1B-associated proteins, cells were induced with doxycycline for 4 days and nuclear extracts were prepared (Fig. 2B). Nuclear extracts were subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation, bound proteins were eluted by FLAG peptide, and eluants were separated on 10–50% sucrose gradients. Gradient fractions enriched for the FLAG-Set1B carboxyl-terminal fragment were pooled and subjected to a second round of FLAG immunoprecipitation and then visualized by SDS-PAGE. Several protein bands were specifically associated with the FLAG-tagged Set1B fragment, and were not apparent in samples that were isolated from T-REx HEK293 cells transfected with empty expression vector (Fig. 2C). Set1B-interacting protein bands were excised and analyzed by mass spectrometry. These were determined to be components of the Set1A complex, including CFP1 (accession number NP_055408), Ash2 (accession number NP_004665.1), Rbbp5 (accession number NP_005048.1), and Wdr5 (accession number NP_060058.1). To further evaluate the authenticity of the putative Set1B complex, nuclear extracts isolated from cells expressing the carboxyl terminus of FLAG-Set1B (aa 1120–1923) were subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation followed by Western blot analysis. CFP1, Ash2, Rbbp5, and Wdr5 were detected by specific antisera, but were not detected in FLAG immunoprecipitates prepared from cells carrying the empty expression vector (Fig. 3A). Similar analysis was performed following immunoprecipitation of endogenous Set1A or Set1B proteins (Fig. 3B). Western analysis of immunoprecipitated material reveals the presence of all members of the previously described Set1 complex (21Lee J.-H. Skalnik D.G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 41725-41731Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar), including Wdr82. The failure to detect Wdr82 in co-immunoprecipitation studies using the carboxyl half of Set1B (Fig. 2C) indicates that Wdr82 interacts with the amino half of the Set1B protein. Similar to the inability of FLAG-tagged Set1B fragment to immunoprecipitate Set1A (Fig. 3A), immunopr"

https://openalex.org/W2128341240,"A major obstacle to successful chemotherapy is intrinsic or acquired multi-drug resistance (MDR). The most common cause of MDR involves increased drug efflux from cancer cells mediated by members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family. The regulation of ABC transporters in the context of cancer is poorly understood, and clinical efforts to inhibit their function have not been fruitful. Constitutive activation of the Hedgehog (Hh) pathway has been shown to contribute to the growth and maintenance of various cancers. Here, we show that inhibition of Hh signaling increases the response of cancer cells to multiple structurally unrelated chemotherapies. We further show that Hh pathway activation induces chemoresistance in part by increasing drug efflux in an ABC transporter-dependent manner. We found that Hh signaling regulates the expression of the ABC transporter proteins multi-drug resistance protein-1 (MDR1, ABCB1, P-glycoprotein) and (BCRP, ABCG2), and that targeted knockdown of MDR1 and BCRP expression by small interfering RNA partially reverses Hh-induced chemoresistance. These results suggest that the Hh pathway may be a target to overcome MDR and increase chemotherapeutic response."

The antiapoptotic mechanism of epinephrine primarily involves phosphorylation and inactivation of the proapoptotic protein BAD by cAMP-dependent protein kinase. Moreover, BAD phosphorylation was observed at epinephrine concentrations found after acute and chronic psychosocial stress.

Epinephrine levels are sharply increased in response to acute stress and can be continuously elevated during persistent stress and depression (1Gold S.M. Zakowski S.G. Valdimarsdottir H.B.

Thus, more information about the mechanisms by which stress hormones affect tumors is necessary to resolve the controversy over the connection between stress and cancer.

Ther. 2004; 101: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Epinephrine binding leads to activation of GTPase and dissociation ofα andβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. Depending on the cell context, this may trigger multiple signaling pathways, including the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated kinase, NFκB, and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) pathways, which regulate diverse cellular responses, such as proliferation, differentiation, secretion, or apoptosis (9Pierce K.L. Premont R.T. Lefkowitz R.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 639-650Crossref PubMed Scopus (2064) Google Scholar).Since resistance to apoptosis has been implicated in cancer pathogenesis (10Green D.R. Evan G.I. Cancer Cell. 2002; 1: 19-30Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar), we decided to analyze the effects of the β2-AR agonist epinephrine on apoptosis in prostate cancer cells. In this paper, we demonstrate that epinephrine reduces sensitivity of prostate cancer cells to apoptosis via β2-AR/PKA signaling that triggers BAD phosphorylation at S112. This anti-apoptotic mechanism operates in the prostate cancer cell lines LNCaP and C4-2 and in the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB231. Our findings suggest that stress may contribute to cancer etiology and therapeutic resistance by decreasing sensitivity of cancer cells to apoptosis.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESCell Lines and Transfection—LNCaP and C4-2 cells were a gift from Leland Chung (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). PC3 and MDA-MB-231 cells were obtained from ATCC. LNCaP were maintained in T-medium supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum, C4-2 and PC3 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 with 10% fetal bovine serum, and MDA-MB-231 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. All cells were kept in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. Transient transfection was performed at 60–70% confluence using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.Antibodies and Other Reagents—Antibodies were from the following sources: androgen receptor, BAD, phospho-specific BAD (Ser112, Ser136, and Ser155), phospho-Akt (Ser473 and Thr308), and phospho-CREB (Ser133) from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA); antibodies to β-actin and anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibodies from Sigma; secondary horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies used for Western blots from Amersham Biosciences. Protein G-agarose beads, forskolin, epinephrine, and DEVD-afc were from Calbiochem. All other chemicals and reagents (unless specified) were purchased from Sigma. Tissue culture reagents were purchased from Invitrogen.Plasmid and DNA Constructs—pcDNA3-HA-BAD and pcDNA3-HA-BADs112/136A constructs were from Robert Datta and Michael Greenberg (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA); pCMV14-FLAG-CREB was from Gary Kammer (WFUSM, Winston-Salem, NC), EGFP was from Clontech Inc. The PKA inhibitors PKI-GFP and RevAB-GFP have been described previously (11Guo M. Pascual R.M. Wang S. Fontana M.F. Valancius C.A. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Tilley S.L. Penn R.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13771-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar).shRNA Experiments—For shRNA knockdown experiments of the androgen receptor, a lentiviral vector (pLL3.7) was used with a shRNA insert of annealed oligonucleotides. The androgen receptor DNA target sequence used was 5-TGCACTGCTACTCTTCAGCAttcaagagaTGCTGAAGAGTAGCAGTGCTTTTTTC-3 (sequence that corresponds to AR is shown in boldface type; loop sequence is in italic type), and the scrambled sequence was 5-TGTACTGCAGCCACATTCTCttcaagagaGAGAATGTGGCTGCAGTACTTTTTTC-3. HEK 293 cells were transfected with pLL3.7 vector containing either of these sequences in combination with packaging vectors (VSVG, RSV-REV, and pMDL g/p RRE). After 48 h, supernatants were collected from these cells and used to infect LNCaP cells. 48 h after infection, cells were plated for subsequent experiments.Apoptosis Assays—Prostate cancer LNCaP cells are relatively resistant to apoptosis, even in serum-free culture conditions, due to constitutively active PI3K/Akt signaling. Inhibitors of PI3K reduce Akt activity and induce apoptosis in LNCaP cells, which can be further enhanced by thapsigargin, an inhibitor of the sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (12McConkey D.J. Greene G. Pettaway C.A. Cancer Res. 1996; 56: 5594-5599PubMed Google Scholar). For analysis of apoptosis in whole cell populations, cells were serum-starved overnight (16 h) and treated with 50 μm LY294002 and 1 μm thapsigargin. Thapsigargin alone does not induce apoptosis in prostate cancer cells within 24 h (13Wertz I.E. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 11470-11477Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 14Tombal B. Weeraratna A.T. Denmeade S.R. Isaacs J.T. Prostate. 2000; 43: 303-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), but in our experimental conditions, thapsigargin synchronized caspase activation in cells treated with LY294002. This protocol shortened the time and increased the reproducibility of caspase assays and also permitted analysis of apoptosis by time lapse video recording. Apoptosis in whole cell populations was quantified by measuring caspase-3 activity with the fluorogenic substrate Ac-DEVD-7-amido-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin (DEVD-afc) (Bachem) as specified by the manufacturer. Caspase activity in cells treated only with proapoptotic agents was assigned a value of 100.Apoptosis in a population of transiently transfected GFP-positive cells was measured by time lapse video recording followed by counting the percentage of cells with apoptotic morphology, as described elsewhere (15Sastry K.S. Karpova Y. Kulik G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27367-27377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). At least four randomly chosen fields for each treatment were recorded. A similar methodology was used to video record cells infected with pLL3.7 lentivirus vector that contained androgen receptor shRNA and a GFP expression cassette. Apoptosis in fragmented cells was confirmed by immunofluorescent detection of active caspase 3 and nuclear fragmentation (15Sastry K.S. Karpova Y. Kulik G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 27367-27377Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) (Fig. S1). Results were confirmed by at least two independent experiments. T-tests (two-tailed distribution, two-sample unequal variance) were used for statistical analysis.Immunoprecipitation—20 h after transfection, cells were deprived of serum for 3 h, and different treatments were given at this point. Cells were harvested in a cell lysis buffer that contained 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 40 mm NaF, 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 1 μg each of leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm NaVO4, 50 mm β-glycerophosphate, 40 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, and 1 mm dithiothreitol. The lysates were cleared of insoluble material by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. Cell extracts were incubated with 6–8 μg of anti-HA antibodies (12CA5) overnight at 4 °C and with protein A-conjugated beads for another 3 h. Beads were washed three times with cell lysis buffer, and proteins were eluted with an SDS sample buffer for Western blotting analysis.RESULTSEpinephrine Protects LNCaP Cells from Apoptosis by Activating β2-ARs—β2-ARs that bind epinephrine are abundantly expressed in normal prostate epithelial cells and prostate cancer cells (5Nagmani R. Pasco D.S. Salas R.D. Feller D.R. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 65: 1489-1494Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 16Poyet P. Gagne B. Labrie F. Prostate. 1986; 9: 237-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). To determine whether epinephrine can regulate apoptosis, we examined its effects on prostate cancer LNCaP cells.Analysis of apoptosis by measuring caspase activity, poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage, and time lapse video recording reveals that maximal apoptosis is observed 6 h after treatment with LY294002 and thapsigargin, whereas concomitant treatment with epinephrine substantially decreases apoptosis (Fig. 1, A–C). Epinephrine protected LNCaP cells from apoptosis in the absence of PI3K activity that was judged by continuous inhibition of Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 (Fig. 1B).To examine the role of β2-ARs in epinephrine-induced antiapoptotic signaling, we utilized the highly β2-AR-selective antagonist ICI118,551 (17Samama P. Pei G. Costa T. Cotecchia S. Lefkowitz R.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 390-394PubMed Google Scholar). Complete inhibition of the antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine by ICI118,551 suggests that the effects of epinephrine are mediated solely via the β2-AR (Fig. 1D). In contrast, the antiapoptotic effect of forskolin (a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase) was not inhibited by ICI118,551.Antiapoptotic Effect of Epinephrine Is Mediated via PKA—Epinephrine and forskolin have been previously shown to activate adenylyl cyclase, increase cAMP levels, and activate PKA in LNCaP cells (18Cox M.E. Deeble P.D. Bissonette E.A. Parsons S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 13812-13818Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Besides PKA, cAMP can also activate the EPAC/Rap1 pathway (19de Rooij J. Zwartkruis F.J. Verheijen M.H. Cool R.H. Nijman S.M. Wittinghofer A. Bos J.L. Nature. 1998; 396: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in addition to increased cAMP levels, β2-ARs may trigger other signaling pathways via βγ subunits of G-proteins or β-arrestins. Thus, it is possible that antiapoptotic effects of epinephrine are mediated via PKA-independent signaling by the β2-ARs (20Dent G. Br. J. Pharmacol. 2001; 133: 1199-1200Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar).To address the role of PKA in apoptosis, we examined survival effects of epinephrine and forskolin in LNCaP cells transiently expressing a GFP chimera of the PKA inhibitor PKI (PKI-GFP (11Guo M. Pascual R.M. Wang S. Fontana M.F. Valancius C.A. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Tilley S.L. Penn R.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13771-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Time lapse video microscopy was used to determine cumulative cell death in LNCaPs transfected with GFP or PKI-GFP. Both epinephrine and forskolin delayed apoptosis in cells transfected with GFP, but neither agent inhibited apoptosis in cells expressing PKI-GFP (Fig. 2). Inhibition of PKA by PKI-GFP was confirmed by measuring phosphorylation of CREB, a known PKA substrate (21Shaywitz A.J. Greenberg M.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 821-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1759) Google Scholar) (Fig. S2A). Similar results were obtained in cells expressing a mutant regulatory subunit of PKA (RevAB-GFP) (11Guo M. Pascual R.M. Wang S. Fontana M.F. Valancius C.A. Panettieri Jr., R.A. Tilley S.L. Penn R.B. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 13771-13782Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) capable of inhibiting PKA activation (Fig. S2B). These data indicate that PKA activation is necessary for the antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine.FIGURE 2Antiapoptotic effects of epinephrine and forskolin depend on PKA activation. Cells transfected with GFP (white bars) or with PKI-GFP (black bars) were treated with 0.3% Me2SO (contr), 50 μm LY294002, and 1 μm thapsigargin (LY+T) followed by 100 nm epinephrine (Epi) or 5 μm forskolin (Fsk) as indicated. Apoptosis was measured by time lapse video recording of GFP-positive cells. Approximately 200 cells were scored for apoptotic morphology (cytoplasmic and nuclear fragmentation).

Androl. 1992; 13: 457-464PubMed Google Scholar). Because signaling through the Gαs/PKA pathway has been shown to transactivate the androgen receptor in a ligand-independent fashion (24Kasbohm E.A.

Chem. 1999; 274: 7777-7783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar), we examined whether AR plays a role in antiapoptotic signaling by epinephrine.Androgen receptor expression was decreased by an androgen receptor-specific shRNA construct introduced into LNCaP cells using the lentiviral vector pLL3.7 (Fig. 3A). Apoptosis in LNCaP cells infected with a lentiviral expression vector bearing androgen receptor shRNA, scrambled shRNA, or with empty vector was assessed by caspase assays. In cells infected with androgen receptor shRNA, the antiapoptotic effect of R1881 was completely suppressed. We observed a slight increase in apoptosis in androgen receptor shRNA infected cells treated with R1881, whereas we observed no significant difference in protection from apoptosis by R1881 in cells infected with empty vector or scrambled shRNA (Fig. 3B). Epinephrine reduced apoptosis in cells infected with all lentiviral vectors, although in cells infected with androgen receptor-specific shRNA, we observed a modest but statistically significant reduction of epinephrine-induced survival. Similar results were obtained in experiments where apoptosis was measured by time lapse video recording (Fig. 3C).FIGURE 3The antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine is partially dependent on androgen receptor expression. A, LNCaP cells were infected with the lentiviral vector pLL3.7 that expresses androgen receptor-specific shRNA (AR shRNA), scrambled shRNA, or empty vector. 48 h after infection, cells were lysed and immunoblotted for androgen receptor expression. Androgen receptor-deficient PC3 cells were used as a negative control. Equal loading was confirmed by probing Western blots with antibodies to β-actin. B, cells infected with empty vector, scrambled shRNA, or androgen receptor-specific shRNA were incubated 18 h in serum-free medium alone or supplemented with the androgen analog R1881 (10 nm) and treated with combinations of LY294002 (25 μm), thapsigargin (1 μm), and epinephrine (100 nm). 6 h after treatments, cells were collected, and caspase activity was measured with the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-afc (shown in relative units). Error bars represent the average ± S.D. of three independent experiments. C, cells were infected and treated as in B, and apoptosis was followed by time lapse video recording. At least 300 cells in randomly chosen fields were followed for each treatment. Solid lines, cells infected with empty vector; dashed lines, cells infected with androgen receptor-specific shRNA.

Therefore, PKA targets that directly regulate apoptosis are primarily responsible for the survival effect of epinephrine.Epinephrine Inhibits Apoptosis through PKA-dependent BAD Phosphorylation at Ser112—Recently, we demonstrated that BAD phosphorylation plays an important role in apoptosis regulation in LNCaP cells. In intact LNCaP cells, BAD is constitutively phosphorylated at Ser75, which corresponds to Ser112 in mouse BAD. Dephosphorylation of BAD in cells treated with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 precedes the onset of apoptosis in LNCaP cells, whereas knockdown of BAD expression with shRNA inhibits apoptosis (26Sastry K.S. Smith A.J. Karpova Y. Datta S.R. Kulik G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 20891-20901Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Analysis of endogenous BAD phosphorylation with phospho-specific antibodies to Ser(P)112 showed that epinephrine increased BAD phosphorylation over basal levels. Treatment with LY294002 decreased BAD phosphorylation, which was restored with concomitant epinephrine treatment. We reasoned that epinephrine-induced BAD phosphorylation was independent of PI3K/Akt signaling, because Akt phosphorylation remained inhibited in cells treated with LY294002 and epinephrine (Figs. 1B and 4A).FIGURE 4Survival effect of epinephrine depends on PKA-mediated BAD phosphorylation at Ser112. A, phosphorylation of endogenous BAD and Akt in whole cell lysates of LNCaP cells. Cells were maintained in serum-free medium for 3 h and treated with 25 μm LY294002 for 2 h, followed by 100 nm epinephrine. Cell lysates were immunoblotted with phosphospecific antibodies against Ser(P)112 BAD or Thr(P)308 Akt or antibodies to total BAD or Akt to control equal loading. B, LNCaP cells were transfected with HA-BAD mixed with either GFP or PKI-GFP and treated with 0.3% Me2SO (control) or 25 μm LY294002 (LY) for 2 h, followed by 300 nm epinephrine (Epi) or 5 μm forskolin (Fsk) for 1 h where indicated. HA-BAD was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with phosphospecific antibodies to Ser(P)112, Ser(P)136, and Ser(P)155 or total BAD. C, cells were transfected with either wild-type BAD (white bars) or BADS112A (black bars) mixed with GFP cDNAs (9:1) and treated with LY294002 (LY) alone or in combination with epinephrine (LY+Epi). Cumulative cell death was measured by time lapse video recording of GFP-positive cells for 6 h. Bars show percentage of apoptosis 6 h after treatments (time course of apoptosis is shown in Fig. S3). Each bar was generated by counting at least 350 cells. Error bars show S.D. between four randomly selected fields. Difference between apoptosis in cells expressing BADwt and BADS112A and treated with LY294002 plus epinephrine was statistically significant at p < 0.05. D, expression of HA-BADwt and HA-BADS112A detected by immunoblotting with antibodies against BAD. Endogenous BAD is shown as loading control.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Since PKA activation was connected with the antiapoptotic effects of epinephrine (Fig. 2), we assessed the role of PKA in site-specific BAD phosphorylation by epinephrine. Phospho-BAD-specific antibodies to Ser(P)136 and Ser(P)155 are not sensitive enough for detecting endogenous BAD phosphorylation. To overcome the lack of sensitivity of phospho-BAD antibodies, recombinant mouse HA-BAD was expressed in LNCaP cells. As shown in Fig. 4B, Ser112 and Ser136 sites in BAD were dephosphorylated in LNCaP cells treated with LY294002, whereas epinephrine restored BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 and also modestly increased phosphorylation at Ser155 over the level observed in cells with active PI3K/Akt signaling (Fig. 4B, lanes 1–4). Co-transfection of HA-BAD with the PKA inhibitor PKI-GFP completely abolished BAD phosphorylation by either epinephrine or forskolin at both Ser112 and Ser155 (Fig. 4B, lanes 5–8). In contrast, PKA inhibition did not decrease BAD phosphorylation, which depends on constitutive PI3K signaling (Fig. 4, lanes 1 and 5).To determine the role of BAD phosphorylation at Ser112 in the antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine, we examined epinephrine-induced survival in cells expressing BADS112A with a mutated phosphorylation site. Wild-type BAD and BADS112A were transiently expressed at comparable levels (Fig. 4D). Comparison of cells expressing wild-type BAD and mutant BADS112A showed that the antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine was significantly decreased in cells expressing BADS112A (Figs. 4C and S3). Thus, protection of prostate cancer LNCaP cells from apoptosis by epinephrine is predominantly mediated by phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein BAD at Ser112.Resting epinephrine concentrations in human and mouse plasma are reportedly below 1 nm. In response to acute stress, epinephrine concentrations may increase to 25 nm (27Grouzmann E. Cavadas C. Grand D. Moratel M. Aubert J.F. Brunner H.R. Mazzolai L. Pflugers Arch. 2003; 447: 254-258Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 28Wortsman J. Frank S. Cryer P.E. Am. J. Med. 1984; 77: 779-784Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). To determine a minimal dose of epinephrine that induces BAD phosphorylation and protects from apoptosis, we tested a range of epinephrine concentrations in LNCaP cells. Reductions in apoptosis and increased BAD phosphorylation were observed with 1 nm epinephrine (Fig. 5, A and B).FIGURE 5Physiological concentrations of epinephrine protect cells from apoptosis and induce BAD phosphorylation. A, LNCaP cells were serum-starved and treated with 0.3% Me2SO (control), 50 μm LY294002, and 1 μm thapsigargin (LY+T) and increasing concentrations of epinephrine (1–300 nm). Cells were collected 6 h after treatments and lysed, and caspase activity was measured using fluorogenic substrate DEVD-afc. Bars, average ± S.E. of duplicate samples. Comparable results were observed in three independent experiments. B, cells were serum-starved and treated with 50 μm LY294002 for 2 h followed with increasing concentrations of epinephrine (0.01–1000 nm) for 1 h. Then cells were lysed and immunoblotted with antibodies that recognize BAD phosphorylated at Ser112 and CREB phosphorylated at Ser133. Antibodies to total BAD and β-actin were used to control equal loading.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)To test whether the antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine and BAD phosphorylation occurs in other cancer cell lines, we conducted similar experiments in C4-2 prostate cancer cells and in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. C4-2 cells, characterized by increased tumorigenicity (29Thalmann G.N. Anezinis P.E. Chang S.M. Zhau H.E. Kim E.E. Hopwood V.L. Pathak S. von Eschenbach A.C. Chung L.W. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 2577-2581PubMed Google Scholar), exhibited apoptosis comparable with that of LNCaP cells upon treatment with LY294002 and thapsigargin. In contrast, MDA-MB-231 cell lines were more resistant to apoptosis than were LNCaP cells. Therefore, irradiation with UVB, alone or in combination with LY294002, was used to induce apoptosis. As with LNCaP cells, treatment with epinephrine increased BAD phosphorylation and reduced apoptosis in C4-2 and MDA-MB231 cells (Fig. 6).FIGURE 6Epinephrine protects from apoptosis and induces BAD phosphorylation in prostate cancer C4-2 and breast cancer MDA-MB231 cells. C4-2 (A) or MDA-MB-231 (B) cells were serum-starved for 18 h and treated with 0.3% Me2SO (control), 50 μm LY294002 (LY), 1 μm thapsigargin (T), 1 min of UV-B (UV), and 100 nm epinephrine (Epi) as indicated. Cells were lysed 6 h after treatments, and caspase activity was measured using the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-afc. Lysates of C4-2 (C) and MDA-MB-231 (D) cells were immunoblotted with antibodies that recognize BAD phosphorylated at Ser112 and total BAD.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)DISCUSSIONIn the present study, we have shown that epinephrine, a catecholamine secreted by adrenal glands and sympathetic nerve terminals in response to stress, protects prostate and breast cancer cells from apoptosis. Specifically, the antiapoptotic effect of epinephrine is mediated by β2 adrenergic receptor- and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of BAD at Ser112. This antiapoptotic mechanism can be activated within the range of epinephrine levels observed in response to emotional stress.β2-ARs belong to a GPCR superfamily that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer. Several publications report increased expression of GPCRs and GPCR agonists in malignant prostate specimens (30Xu L.L. Stackhouse B.G. Florence K. Zhang W. Shanmugam N. Sesterhenn I.A. Zou Z.

https://openalex.org/W2014337610,"Cancer cells display an altered distribution of DNA methylation relative to normal cells. Certain tumor suppressor gene promoters are hypermethylated and transcriptionally inactivated, whereas repetitive DNA is hypomethylated and transcriptionally active. Little is understood about how the abnormal DNA methylation patterns of cancer cells are established and maintained. Here, we identify over 20 DNMT3B transcripts from many cancer cell lines and primary acute leukemia cells that contain aberrant splicing at the 5' end of the gene, encoding truncated proteins lacking the C-terminal catalytic domain. Many of these aberrant transcripts retain intron sequences. Although the aberrant transcripts represent a minority of the DNMT3B transcripts present, Western blot analysis demonstrates truncated DNMT3B isoforms in the nuclear protein extracts of cancer cells. To test if expression of a truncated DNMT3B protein could alter the DNA methylation patterns within cells, we expressed DNMT3B7, the most frequently expressed aberrant transcript, in 293 cells. DNMT3B7-expressing 293 cells have altered gene expression as identified by microarray analysis. Some of these changes in gene expression correlate with altered DNA methylation of corresponding CpG islands. These results suggest that truncated DNMT3B proteins could play a role in the abnormal distribution of DNA methylation found in cancer cells."

Furthermore, our studies reveal that pathway activity and responsiveness is confined to progenitor cells within these tumors. Additionally, we demonstrate that Hh signaling in glioma progenitor cells is ligand-dependent and provide evidence documenting the in vivo source of Sonic hedgehog protein.

https://openalex.org/W2091537338,"A central dogma in immunology is that antibody specificity is a function of the variable (V) region. However serological analysis of IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b switch variants of murine monoclonal antibody (mAb) 3E5 IgG3 with identical V domains revealed apparent specificity differences for Cryptococcus neoformans glucuronoxylomannan (GXM). Kinetic and thermodynamic binding properties of mAbs 3E5 to a 12-mer peptide mimetic of GXM revealed differences in the affinity of these mAbs for a monovalent ligand, a result that implied that the constant (C) region affects the secondary structure of the antigen binding site, thus accounting for variations in specificity. Structural models of mAbs 3E5 suggested that isotype-related differences in binding resulted from amino acid sequence polymorphisms in the C region. This study implies that isotype switching is another mechanism for generating diversity in antigen binding and that isotype restriction of certain antibody responses may reflect structural constraints imposed by C region on V region binding. Furthermore, isotype affected the polyreactivity of V region identical antibodies, implying a role for C region in determining self-reactivity.

Each H and L chain contains a V domain that when combined defines the antigen (Ag) binding site. In the mammalian genome, there are five major classes of heavy constant (CH) domains that determine Ab isotype. These are usually assumed to have effector functions without directly affecting the Ag binding affinity and/or specificity. However, the CH domains are known to contribute to the apparent affinity through avidity effects that result from the polyvalent nature of certain immunoglobulins (Ig) classes. Hence, the classical view of Ig function is that the V domains are solely responsible for Ab affinity and specificity, whereas the C region is responsible for the biological properties such as complement activation, Fc receptor binding, avidity, and serum half-life (1Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1286) Google Scholar). This concept posits that when B cells switch from one CH region to another, the avidity and effector functions of an Ab change without altering the specificity for the antigen (2Tonegawa S. Nature. 1983; 302: 575-581Crossref PubMed Scopus (3177) Google Scholar). However, V region-identical Abs have been reported to manifest differences in the magnitude of binding to Ag, fine specificity, and idiotypic (Id) recognition (3Greenspan N.S. Dacek D.A. Cooper L.J.

Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar), thus challenging this central immunological dogma. A critical condition for Ab-Ag binding is the formation of a specific complex between the Ab and the Ag. Understanding the interaction of these two biological macromolecules requires detailed knowledge of the structure and functional characteristics of the complex. The structure of the Ab-Ag complex can be described using x-ray crystallography and computer-generated structural models. The functional activity can be described by the kinetic rate constants (kon/off), equilibrium constants (K), and thermodynamic parameters of the binding complex. The equilibrium constant is related to the Gibbs free energy of binding (ΔG) by the relationship ΔG =-RTlnKA =ΔH - TΔS.A net negative change in ΔG indicates successful binding interactions, and the magnitude of this change directly determines the binding affinity. ΔG involves and is modulated by two other thermodynamic parameters, the enthalpy change (ΔH) and the entropy change (ΔS) (8Janin J. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Manivel V. Bayiroglu F. Siddiqui Z. Salunke D.M. Rao K.V. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 888-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Enthalpy describes heat changes resulting from molecular interactions at the binding site involving electrostatic, hydrophobic, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals intermolecular interactions, whereas entropy changes reflect the net conformational, stereochemical, and structural perturbations that occur within the interacting entities or in the surrounding solvent molecules (8Janin J. Biochimie (Paris). 1995; 77: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar, 9Manivel V. Bayiroglu F. Siddiqui Z. Salunke D.M. Rao K.V. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 888-897Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Our previous studies using a family of mouse-human chimeric (ch) Abs and two families of murine IgG isotype switches demonstrated that isotype contributes to Ab fine specificity differences for multivalent Ags by showing differences in binding and Id recognition for these mAbs to their Ags (7Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar, 10McLean G.R. Torres M. Elguezabal N. Nakouzi A. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2002; 169: 1379-1386Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Those studies relied entirely on serological methods to investigate binding differences. To formally prove the notion that the CH region affects binding to a monovalent ligand, we have used surface plasmon resonance (SPR) in a Biacore system. SPR allows measurements of the formation and dissociation of complexes, in real time and in a label-free environment. Using SPR analysis we determined the kinetic and thermodynamic constants for the interaction of V region-identical IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 with a monovalent Ag in the form of peptide mimetic. The binding kinetics are best described by a two-state bimolecular association model consistent with an Ab and Ag encounter step followed by a docking step, which may include conformational rearrangements. Consequently, the results presented here indicate kinetic and thermodynamic variations that imply diverse Ab-Ag interactions within IgG molecules expressing different CH regions but identical V regions. mAbs and Peptides—GXM-binding mAb 3E5 (IgG3) was produced by a hybridoma isolated from a mouse immunized with a GXM-tetanus toxoid conjugate vaccine (11Casadevall A. Mukherjee J. Devi S.J. Schneerson R. Robbins J.B. Scharff M.D. J. Infect. Dis. 1992; 165: 1086-1093Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). The IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b switch variants of 3E5 IgG3 were generated in vitro by sib selection (12Spira G. Scharff M.D. J. Immunol. Methods. 1992; 148: 121-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Members of the mAb 3E5 family share identical VH and VL sequences (7Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). All murinem mAbs were purified by protein A or G affinity chromatography (Pierce) from hybridoma culture supernatants and dialyzed against PBS. mAb concentration was determined by ELISA and Bradford measurements. All Abs were tested by PAGE to verify their integrity and correct molecular weight. mAbs 3E5 were analyzed by MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight) mass spectrometry at the Laboratory for Macromolecular Analysis, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, to confirm the absence of mAb aggregates (7Torres M.

Generation of Fabs—Fabs were generated from mAbs 3E5 IgG2a and 3E5 IgG3. mAb 3E5 IgG2a was dialyzed against 20 mm Na2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, before enzymatic digestion. Papain digestion was carried out overnight at room temperature in 20 mm Na2PO4, 10 mm EDTA, pH 7.0, and 0.8 mm dithiothreitol with an E:S ratio of 1:20. mAb 3E5 IgG3 was dialyzed against 20 mm Tris-NaCl pH 7.4, before enzymatic digestion. Papain digestion was carried out overnight at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-NaCl, pH 7.4, and 0.8 mm dithiothreitol with an E:S ratio of 1:20. After digestion, Fab molecules from both mAbs were purified by protein A affinity chromatography (Pierce) and dialyzed against at least two changes of PBS. GXM-3E5 mAbs Binding ELISA at Different pHs—Polystyrene plates were coated with a 5 μg/ml solution of GXM in PBS, incubated 1.5 h at 37 °C, and blocked overnight at 4 °C with 1% BSA in TBS. mAbs 3E5 were added at 50 μg/ml in 0.2 m phosphate buffer at pH ranging from 4.4 to 10.4 and serially diluted. The plates were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. mAb binding was determined with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse κ (Southern Biotech) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. GXM-3E5 mAbs Binding ELISA in Ethanol—Polystyrene plates were coated with a 5 μg/ml solution of GXM in PBS, incubated 1.5 h at 37 °C, and blocked with 1% BSA in TBS. mAb was added at 50 μg/ml in 5% ethanol, 1% BSA. Serial dilutions were made, and plates were incubated for 1.5 h at 37 °C. mAb binding was determined as above. Polyreactivity ELISA—mAbs 3E5 were screened for polyreactivity against a panel of antigens by ELISA. Polystyrene plates were coated overnight at 4 °C with actin (Sigma), tubulin (ICN), and thyroglobulin (Sigma) at 5 μg/ml in bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6, and with double-stranded DNA (Sigma) and single-stranded DNA (Sigma) at 100 μg/ml in sodium citrate buffer, pH 6.0. Plates were blocked with 1% BSA in TBS for 2 h at 4 °C. mAbs were added at 50 μg/ml in 1% BSA/TBS and serially diluted. Plates were incubated overnight at 4 °C. mAb binding was determined with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-mouse κ (Southern Biotech) and p-nitrophenyl phosphate substrate by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. Immobilization of 3E5 mAbs onto CM5 Chips—The Biacore 3000 system and research grade sensor chip CM5 (Biacore) were used. mAbs and Fabs were immobilized on the surface of a CM5 chip through primary amino groups using reactive esters. The carboxylated matrix was first activated with 70 μl of a 1:1 mixture of N-ethyl-N′(dimethylaminoporpyl)-carbodiimide (Pierce) and N-hydroxysuccinimide (Pierce). mAbs 3E5 were injected at 25 μg/ml in 10 mm MES (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 6.0. Fab 3E5 IgG2a and Fab 3E5 IgG3 were injected at 100 and 50 μg/ml, respectively, in 10 mm sodium acetate (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 4.99. After mAb injection, remaining N-hydroxysuccinimide ester groups were blocked by an injection of 70 μl of 1 m ethanolamine (Sigma-Aldrich), pH 8.5. Biacore Binding Assays—Peptide mimetic of GXM P1 was used to analyze the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of the mAbs utilized in this study. This peptide was recovered from a peptide phage display library screened with 3E5 IgG3, and it has been previously shown to bind all mAb 3E5 isotypes (7Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The interaction of the mAb-peptide complexes was analyzed at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35 °C. Peptide P1 was tested at concentrations ranging from 1.56 to 200 μm at high flow rate (100 μl/min) in 0.2 mm K2HPO4/KH2PO4, pH 6.5, 150 mm KCl, and 0.05% P20. At the end of the dissociation phase, the surface was regenerated by injecting 50 μl of 50 mm ethanolamine in 50% ethylene glycol (Sigma-Aldrich) and 50 μl of 10 mm HCl. Nonderivatized flow cells served as a reference surface. The continuous flow ensured that no changes in analyte concentration occurred during the measurements. The availability of a constant free analyte concentration is particularly important for the determination of kinetic parameters. By using one of the flow channels as an in-line reference, a control is obtained on the same sample aliquot, eliminating the variations that occur with separate reference and sample measurements. Kinetic data were interpreted with BIAevaluation 4.1 software. Data for each group were analyzed globally using a two-state model to obtain the individual forward (k+1, k+2) and reverse (k-1, k-2) rate constants. The rate constants for each global fit were used to calculate the equilibrium constant (KA). Ka1=k1/K-1(Eq.1) Ka2=k2/K-2(Eq.2) KA=Ka1(1+Ka2)(Eq.3) The Gibbs free energy changes (ΔG) were calculated from the equilibrium constants, ΔG1=-RTlnKa1Eq.4 ΔG2=-RTlnKa2(Eq.5) ΔG=-RTlnKA=ΔG1+ΔG2(Eq.6) ΔG=ΔH-TΔSEq.7 By rearranging the equations above, we can rewrite the relationship into lnKA=-ΔH/RT+ΔS/REq.8 By measuring KA as a function of temperature, one can draw a plot of lnKD (1/KA) versus 1/T. Ideally, this plot, known as a van’t Hoff plot, should yield a straight line with a slope of -ΔH/R and an intercept ΔS/R. Enthalpy changes (ΔH) were calculated from the slope of the van’t Hoff plot. Entropy changes (ΔS) were calculated from the equation ΔG =ΔH - TΔS by substituting the values of ΔG (from ΔG =-RTlnKA) and assuming ΔH is constant with temperature. Equilibrium affinity constants were calculated without considering the errors of the rate constants. Molecular Modeling—The variable domains of the heavy and light chains of mAbs 3E5 IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, and IgG3 sequences are identical. Thus, only one set of sequences corresponding to the VH and VL sequences of 3E5 IgG1, with accession numbers AAT81538 and AAT81540, were downloaded from GenBank™ (14Benson D.A. Karsch-Mizrachi I. Lipman D.J. Ostell J. Wheeler D.L. Nucleic Acids Res. 2006; 34: D16-D20Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). Each sequence was used to scan the Protein Data Bank (15Berman H.M. Westbrook J.

PSI-BLAST outputs were filtered using BlastProfiler (17Rai B.K. Madrid-Aliste C.J. Fajardo J.E. Fiser A. Bioinformatics (Oxf.). 2006; 22: 2691-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) to select templates with the highest sequence coverage and high sequence identity. Selected templates were inspected manually to choose those with the highest crystallographic quality. The models were built with MODELLER (18Sali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar, 19Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar), combining two experimental structures as templates for each sequence. A common structure for all sequences (Protein Data Bank code 2h1p), was used as template for V and C regions of both the L and H chains and a specific template for the CH1 domain depending on the Ab isotype (Protein Data Bank codes 1sbs, 1jgu, 2cgr, and 1pz5 for IgG1, IgG2a, IgG3b, and IgG3 CH1 domain, respectively). The 2h1p structure corresponds to the experimental three-dimensional structure of anti-GXM mAb 2H1 with peptide mimetic of GXM PA1. The average sequence identity between target sequences and templates was greater than 90%, assuring high quality models (19Fiser A. Sali A. Methods Enzymol. 2003; 374: 461-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (1372) Google Scholar). Five models were generated for each mAb, and the one with lowest energy (according to MODELLER energy function) was selected and further analyzed with PROSA-II (20Sippl M.J. Proteins. 1993; 17: 355-362Crossref PubMed Scopus (1792) Google Scholar) and PRO-CHECK (21Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 283-291Crossref Google Scholar) to determine the quality of the models. Identifying “Highly Connected” Regions—Structural models were submitted to the SARIG (structural analysis of residue interaction graphs) server (22Amitai G. Shemesh A. Sitbon E. Shklar M. Netanely D. Venger I. Pietrokovski S. J. Mol. Biol. 2004; 344: 1135-1146Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The SARIG server converts protein structures into residue interaction graphs (RIGs) in which amino acid residues serve as the nodes of the graph and their interatomic contacts with each other are the graph edges. SARIG analyzes the so-called closeness of the residue(s). Closeness is a property that measures how close each node (or residue) is to all other nodes in the network. The distance is defined as the length of the shortest path between the two nodes. Closeness values are expressed in Zscores and thus are standardized by the standard deviation from the mean value calculated for each protein structure. It was shown that functionally important residues typically have high closeness values. Residues with high closeness values, i.e. highly connected ones, may interact directly or through intermediates (allostery) with other residues of the protein. One-step Versus Two-step Kinetic Models—We chose the two-state model based on the proposal that these mAbs may have changes in their Fab structure or Ig surface properties, which could be a result of binding to Ag (7Torres M. May R. Scharff M.D. Casadevall A. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 2132-2142Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The two-step model fitted better than one-step model to our experimental data (Fig. 1S in supplemental data, and data not shown) and it has been shown to be a more precise representation of Ab-Ag interactions (23Lipschultz C.A. Li Y. Smith-Gill S. Methods (San Diego). 2000; 20: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 24Lipschultz C.A. Yee A. Mohan S. Li Y. Smith-Gill S.J. J. Mol.

In addition, we found that the Langmuir one-step binding model was not applicable because of the higher apparent affinity obtained with intact IgG. Thus, binding kinetics indicates that mAbs 3E5-P1 complexes are best described by a two-state model, This model allows the estimation of two forward rates constants (k+1, k+2) and two reverse rate constants (k-1, k-2). The rate constants k+2 and k-2 are not true on- and off-rate constants but rather are the rates of monomolecular complex conversion between the docked and undocked form. The rate constants k+2 and k-2 modulate the observed on- and off-rates when they become rate-limiting, i.e. when k+2 < k+1 or k-2 < k-1 (25Selzer T. Schreiber G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 409-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The fitting of sensorgram data to a two-state model (supplemental data, Fig. 1S) is significantly better than to a one-step model based on low and evenly distributed residuals, low χ2 (<1), and visual inspection of the binding curves. This fitting is not attributable to heterogeneity of the IgG sample or to nonspecific interactions, because all mAbs were obtained from hybridoma culture supernatant, affinity-purified, and tested for GXM binding by ELISA. PAGE and mass spectrophotometry were used to verify mAb integrity and to discard the possibility that some of our results were due to the presence of mAb aggregates. Effect of Antibody Subclass on the Kinetic and Equilibrium Rate Constants—SPR analysis revealed differences between the binding kinetics of the mAbs 3E5-P1 complexes that were also observed throughout the temperature range studied. Examination of the dissociation equilibrium constants and individual rate constants indicates that all four Abs and the two Fabs exhibited different kinetic and thermodynamic properties on binding. These changes were also observed with variation in temperature. Furthermore, the magnitude of the temperature effect was characteristic for each Ab-peptide complex (Figs. 1 and 2). Rate and equilibrium constants also revealed that the variation in temperature had different impacts on the encounter and docking steps.FIGURE 2Equilibrium affinities for the binding of mAbs 3E5 to peptide P1. Van’t Hoff plots of the equilibrium association rate constant (KA) (A), encounter equilibrium association rate constant (Ka1) (B), and docking equilibrium association rate constant (Ka2) (C) for mAbs 3E5 binding to peptide P1. All equilibrium constants were calculated from the rate constant obtained from the fittings to a two-state model. Lines represent the best fit to a linear regression using a 95% confidence interval. Errors bars were calculated using propagation of error for S.E. of each assay.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Slightly different results were observed for the effect of temperature on the association and dissociation rates of mAb 3E5-P1 complex formation with the different isotypes. For all complexes, the encounter forward rate constant (k+1) decreased at higher temperatures (Fig. 2A). Fig. 1C shows that for 3E5 IgG1-P1, IgG2a-P1, and IgG2b-P1 complexes, the docking association rate constant (k+2) decreased at high temperatures, whereas for 3E5 IgG3, Fab IgG2a, and Fab IgG3 the magnitude of this parameter increased. The curves for the encounter reverse rate constant (k-1) increased at higher temperatures for 3E5 IgG1-P1, IgG2a-P1, and IgG3-P1 complexes, whereas for Fab 3E5 IgG2a-P1 complex a decrease of k -1 was observed. For 3E5 IgG2b-P1 and Fab 3E5 IgG3-P1 complexes, the data most closely fit a curvilinear regression, and therefore these interactions appeared to be more complex (Fig. 1B). The plots for docking reverse rate constant (k-2) showed a decrease with a temperature increase for 3E5 IgG2a-P1, IgG2b-P1, and Fab IgG3-P1 complexes, whereas k-2 increased with temperature for the remaining complexes (Fig. 1D). However, quantitatively the individual rate constants showed differential response to temperature, with variations on the amount of these decreases between mAbs 3E5-P1 complexes. The differences in the rate constants for these complexes accounted for the variations observed in the equilibrium rate constants. The affinity of mAbs 3E5 for peptide P1 calculated from the van’t Hoff plots decreased at higher temperatures, except for Fab 3E5 IgG2a, in which affinity for the peptide increased (Fig. 2A). The equilibrium constants for the encounter steps (Ka1) for these complexes decreased as temperature increased, except for the 3E5 Fab IgG2a-P1 complex, where Ka1 increased (Fig. 2B). For the IgG2a-P1 complex, the decrease of k-1 (Fig. 1C) as a function of temperature may contribute to the temperature increase of Ka1. Also, it is noticeable that the van’t Hoff plots for the encounter association constant Ka1 were approximately parallel to those for the overall affinity constants KA (Fig. 2A). In contrast, the docking equilibrium constants (Ka2) were relatively insensitive to changes in temperature for all complexes (Fig. 2C), with the exception of the Fab 3E5 IgG2a-P1 complex where this parameter decreased at lower temperatures. The Ka2 of the Fab 3E5 IgG3 also decreased initially at lower temperatures but increased again at temperatures below 15 °C (288 K) (Fig. 2C). The decrease of overall affinity with increasing temperatures reflects a primary temperature-related reduction in the encounter equilibrium constants of the mAbs 3E5-P1 complexes except for the Fab 3E5 IgG2a-P1 complex. For this complex, the increase in overall affinity reflects a temperature-related increase in the encounter equilibrium constant. The k+2/k-1 ratio is a sensitive indicator of favorable docking (23Lipschultz C.A. Li Y. Smith-Gill S. Methods (San Diego). 2000; 20: 310-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar, 26Selzer T. Schreiber G. Proteins. 2001; 45: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Throughout the range of temperatures studied, this ratio is <1 (supplemental data, Table 2S) suggesting that all mAb 3E5-P1 complexes are more likely to remain at the encounter step than to dock. In addition, k+1 > k+2 for all mAbs 3E5 binding to P1 at the entire range of temperature, thus increasing the time required for the complexes to reach equilibrium and making the docking step rate-limiting. Because of the slower docking and faster dissociation of the encounter complex, the apparent association rate constant for the mAbs 3E5-P1 interactions appeared to be much slower than it is. The reaction rates can be modified through the action of long range electrostatic forces, which can maneuver a protein complex into a different configuration, a phenomenon known as electrostatic steering (27Davis M.E. Madura J.D. Sines J. Luty B.A. Allison S.A. Mc-Cammon J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 473-497Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 28Kozack R.E. d'Mello M.J. Subramaniam S. Biophys. J. 1995; 68: 807-814Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). The stability of the encounter complex is proportional to 1/k-1 (Fig. 3A), whereas the relative overall impact on electrostatic steering from the changes in rate constants due to the associated CH regions is related to the product of k+1k+2 (Fig. 3B). The overall stability for mAbs 3E5-P1 complexes are similar (Fig. 3A), thus suggesting that the proportion of the complexes within the steering region is comparable for each isotype. In addition, there is an overall increase in the electrostatic steering of Fab 3E5 IgG2a relative to the intact molecule (Fig. 3B), and thus this complex will form an encounter complex faster. In contrast, there was an overall decrease in the electrostatic steering for the Fab 3E5 IgG3 relative to the parental mAb (Fig. 3B), and thus this complex will form an encounter complex more slowly than 3E5 IgG3. Antibody Subclass Has Different Effects on the Thermodynamic Parameters—The variation in the relative responses reflects differences in the encounter and docking rate constants for the different mAb 3E5-P1 complexes. ΔG decreases with temperature for Fab 3E5 IgG2a-P1 complex while increasing for the remaining complexes (Fig. 4A). When the encounter and docking energies of binding, ΔG1 and ΔG2, respectively, are considered individually, a similar trend of ΔG1 (Fig. 4B) with respect to ΔG is noticeable (Fig. 4A). In contrast, the binding energies of docking (ΔG2) are relative constant throughout the temperature range examined (Fig. 4C), with a slight decrease at high temperatures for Fab 3E5 IgG2a-P1 and Fab 3E5 IgG3-P1 complexes. From these data, we can establish that for all of these interactions most of the free energy changes come from the encounter step (ΔG1). Also, the differences in ΔG (ΔΔG) for the mAbs 3E5-P1 interactions with respect to the parental 3E5 IgG3 increased with higher temperatures (supplemental data, Fig. 2S). Furthermore, if we compare the difference of energy of the encounter and docking steps of 3E5 IgG2a with the parental 3E5 IgG3, there is an overall increase in the binding energies at all temperatures for the docking step (ΔΔG2 <-0.5 kcal/mol) (supplemental data, Fig. 2S), indicating that the associated CH region of an Ab can affect the energy of binding. This favoring in energy includes its Fab counterpart, Fab 3E5 IgG2a, in which both ΔΔG1 and ΔΔG2 have become more favorable than the paternal 3E5"
https://openalex.org/W2041265494,"Several acid/base-coupled membrane transporters, such as the electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1), have been shown to bind to different carbonic anhydrase isoforms to create a “transport metabolon.” We have expressed NBCe1 derived from human kidney in oocytes of Xenopus leavis and determined its transport activity by recording the membrane current in voltage clamp, and the cytosolic H+ and Na+ concentrations using ion-selective microelectrodes. When carbonic anhydrase isoform II (CAII) had been injected into oocytes, the membrane current and the rate of cytosolic Na+ rise, indicative for NBCe1 activity, increased significantly with the amount of injected CAII (2–200 ng). The CAII inhibitor ethoxyzolamide reversed the effects of CAII on the NBCe1 activity. Co-expressing wild-type CAII or NH2-terminal mutant CAII together with NBCe1 provided similar results, whereas co-expressing the catalytically inactive CAII mutant V143Y had no effect on NBCe1 activity. Mass spectrometric analysis and the rate of cytosolic H+ change following addition of CO2/ HCO3- confirmed the catalytic activity of injected and expressed CAII in oocytes.

Cytosolic proton buffering and proton regulation are essential properties of all cells, and regulation of H+ is mainly attributable to Na+ and/or H+/ HCO3--dependent carriers, which can recover intracellular and extracellular pH from an acidification or alkalinization. These transporters include the SLC4 family of HCO3- transporters, divided into three Cl-/ HCO3- exchangers (AE1–3) 2The abbreviations used are: AE, anion exchanger; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; DIDS, 4,4-diisothiocyano stilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid; NBCe1, electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter; CA, carbonic anhydrase; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EZA, 6-ethoxy-2-benzothiazolesulfonamide. 2The abbreviations used are: AE, anion exchanger; NHE, Na+/H+ exchanger; DIDS, 4,4-diisothiocyano stilbene-2,2-disulfonic acid; NBCe1, electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter; CA, carbonic anhydrase; DEPC, diethyl pyrocarbonate; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid; EZA, 6-ethoxy-2-benzothiazolesulfonamide. and five Na+-coupled HCO3- transporters (NBCe1, NBCe2, NBCn1, NDCBE, and NCBE) and the family of Na+/H+ exchangers (NHEs) consisting of 9 known isoforms, NHE1-NHE9 (SLC9). The electrogenic sodium-bicarbonate cotransporter (NBCe1) is found in many epithelial cells, such as renal proximal tubule cells (1Boron W.F. Boulpaep E.L. J. Gen.

One main source of intracellular HCO3- that serves as substrate for the NBC is CO2, the hydration and dehydration of which is catalyzed by the enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). After the report on the binding of carbonic anhydrase isoform II (CAII) to the carboxyl terminus of the human anion exchanger AE family (8Vince J.W. Reithmeier R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 28430-28437Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar), evidence has accumulated for a direct interaction between various acid/base transporters with different isoforms of carbonic anhydrase (9Sterling D.

Chem. 2004; 19: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Reports on interaction between NBC and CA goes back to the finding that application of the CA inhibitor acetazolamide inhibits the transport of bicarbonate across the basolateral cell membrane in renal proximal tubule of rabbits (11Burg M. Green N. Am. J. Physiol. 1977; 233: F307-F314PubMed Google Scholar, 12Sasaki S. Marumo F. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: F947-F952PubMed Google Scholar, 13Seki G. Fromter E. Pflugers Arch. 1992; 422: 60-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). By heterologous expression of the kidney NBCe1 in a mouse proximal tubule cell line, Gross et al. (14Gross E. Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Fedotoff O. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. 2002; 544: 679-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar) found that CAII increases the short-circuit current through the transporter in an acetazolamide-sensitive manner, when the NBCe1 was operating in the 3 HCO3-:1 Na+ mode, but not in the 2:1 mode. In the same study, isothermal titration calorimetry experiments showed a binding between the transporter and CAII. Pushkin et al. (15Pushkin A. Abuladze N. Gross E. Newman D. Tatishchev S. Lee I. Fedotoff O. Bondar G. Azimov R. Ngyuen M. Kurtz I. J. Physiol. 2004; 559: 55-65Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) then showed in the mouse proximal tubule cell line that CAII activity enhances the bicarbonate flux via the NBCe1 and is likely to form a “transport metabolon” with the cotransporter. Experiments with mutated CAII-binding sites on the NBCe1 indicated that activity of CAII can only enhance the NBCe1 current, when it is bound to the NBCe1, whereas unbound CAII had no effect on NBCe1-mediated transport. Binding and interaction was also shown for the electroneutral NBC3 with CAII (16Loiselle F.B. Morgan P.E. Alvarez B.V. Casey J.R. Am. J. Physiol. 2004; 286: C1423-C1433Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), and for the NBCe1 with extracellular CAIV (17Alvarez B.V. Loiselle F.B. Supuran C.T. Schwartz G.J. Casey J.R. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 12321-12329Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). Recently, however, Lu et al. (18Lu J. Daly C.M. Parker M.D. Gill H.S. Piermarini P.M. Pelletier M.F. Boron W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19241-19250Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), by measuring the slope conductance of NBCe1-expressing Xenopus oocytes, injected with CAII or co-expressing a fusion protein of NBCe1 and CAII, found no CAII-induced increase in NBCe1 activity. The authors concluded that CAII does not form a transport metabolon with NBCe1, and that the enzymatic activity of CAII in the vicinity of the NBC is unlikely to enhance HCO3- transport substantially, when CO2 is nearly in equilibrium across the cell membrane. Furthermore, by using solid-phase binding assays with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay detection, the same group demonstrated that CAII cannot bind to pure SLC-Ct peptides, and can bind to GST-SLC4-Ct fusion proteins only when the CAII is immobilized and the fusion protein is soluble, but not vice versa (19Piermarini P.M. Eugene Y.K. Boron W.F. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 1409-1421Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). These results reject the idea of a physical and also functional metabolon formation between CAII and bicarbonate transporters. These results disagree with the findings of other groups (8Vince J.W.

We have also addressed the question, if NBCe1 and CAII interact, by heterologously expressing human kidney NBCe1 in Xenopus oocytes with and without injected or co-expressed CAII. We used two mutants of CAII, a catalytically inactive mutant (CAII-V143Y), in which the deletion of the hydrophobic pocket of the enzyme’s active site significantly diminishes enzyme activity by 3 × 105-fold (20Fierke C.A. Calderone T.L. Krebs J.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11054-11063Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 21Alexander R.S. Nair S.K. Christianson D.W. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11064-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and a mutant with 6 exchanged amino acids in the NH2-terminal tail, which prevents binding of the mutant to the anion exchanger AE1. 3Dr. R. Reithmeier, personal communication. 3Dr. R. Reithmeier, personal communication. We have measured the activity of both NBCe1 and CAII activity independently by recording cytosolic H+ and Na+, the membrane current in voltage clamp, and by using mass spectrometry. Our results clearly indicate that CAII enhances the transport activity of the NBCe1 under these conditions. Constructs, Oocytes, and Injection of cRNA and Carbonic Anhydrase—The human CAII cDNA (CAII-WT) and the mutant CAII-HEX with mutations of the amino acids at positions H3P, H4Q, L9A, H10K, H15Q, and H17S was kindly provided by Dr. Reinhart Reithmeier. The catalytically inactive mutant CAII-V143Y was a gift from Dr. Carol Fierke (20Fierke C.A. Calderone T.L. Krebs J.F.

Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 11064-11072Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). All three constructs were subcloned into the oocyte expression vector pGemHeJuel, which contains the 5′- and 3′-untranscribed regions of the Xenopus β-globulin flanking the multiple cloning site. The human NBCe1 cDNA (hkNBCe1) cloned in oocyte expression vector pGH19 was kindly provided by Dr. Walter Boron (22Choi I. Romero M.F. Khandoudi N. Bril A. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: C576-C584Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was linearized with NotI and transcribed in vitro with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of the cap analogon m7G(5′)ppp(5′)G (mMessage mMachine, Ambion Inc.) to produce a capped RNA transcript. The cRNA was purified with the Qiagen RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany) and stored at -80 °C in DEPC/H2O. Integrity of the cRNA was checked by formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. Xenopus laevis females were purchased from Horst Kähler, Hamburg, Germany. Oocytes were isolated and singularized by collagenase (collagenase A, Roche, Mannheim, Germany) treatment in Ca2+-free oocyte saline at 28 °C for 2 h. The singularized oocytes were left overnight in an incubator at 18 °C in Ca2+-containing oocyte saline (pH 7.8) to recover. The oocyte saline had the following composition (in mm): NaCl, 82.5; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1, Na2HPO4; 1, HEPES, 5, titrated with NMDG to pH 7.4. The bicarbonate-containing saline contained (in mm): NaCl, 72.5; KCl, 2.5; CaCl2, 1; MgCl2, 1; Na2HPO4, 1; NaHCO3, 24, gassed with 5% CO2 and HEPES, 5, to stabilize the pH. Oocytes of stages V and VI were selected and injected with 14 ng of NBCe1/cRNA dissolved in DEPC/H2O using glass micropipettes and a microinjection device (Nanoliter 2000, World Precision Instruments, Berlin, Germany). Control oocytes were injected with an equivalent volume of DEPC/H2O. CAII was either injected as protein or co-expressed with the NBCe1. For injection of protein, 50 ng of CAII, isolated from bovine erythrocytes (C3934, Sigma), dissolved in 25 nl of DEPC/H2O, were injected 20–24 h before electrophysiological measurement. Control oocytes were injected with 25 nl of DEPC/H2O. For coexpression of CAII, 12 ng of CAII/cRNA were injected either alone or together with the NBCe1/cRNA. Intracellular pH and Na+ Measurements—For measurement of intracellular pH (pHi) and membrane potential double-, and for intracellular Na+ (Na+i), single-barreled microelectrodes were used; the manufacture and application have been described in detail previously (23Deitmer J.W. J. Gen. Physiol. 1991; 98: 637-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Briefly, for double-barreled microelectrodes, two borosilicate glass capillaries of 1.0 and 1.5 mm in diameter were twisted together and pulled to a micropipette. The ion-selective barrel was silanized with a drop of 5% tri-N-butylchlorsilane in 99.9% pure carbon tetrachloride, backfilled into the tip. The micropipette was baked for 4.5 min at 450 °C on a hot plate. The H+-sensitive mixture (Fluka 95291, Fluka, Buchs, Switzerland) was backfilled into the tip of the silanized ion-selective barrel and filled up with 0.1 m sodium citrate (pH 6.0). The reference barrel was filled with 3 m KCl. To increase the opening of the electrode tip, it was beveled with a jet stream of aluminum powder suspended in H2O. Calibration of the electrodes was carried out in oocyte saline by changing the pH by 0.6 units. The central and reference barrel of the electrodes were connected by chlorided silver wires to the head stages of an electrometer amplifier. Electrodes were accepted for use in the experiments, when their response exceeded 50 mV per unit change in pH; on average, they responded with 54 mV for unit change in pH. In the experimental chamber, they responded faster to a change in saline pH than the fastest reaction measured in the oocyte cytosol. For single-barreled Na+-sensitive microelectrodes, a 1.5-mm borosilicate glass capillary was silanized as described above and backfilled with a Na+-sensitive mixture, made of 10 weight % sodium ionophore VI (Fluka 71739), 89.5 weight % 2-nitrophenylether (o-NPOE), and 0.5 weight % sodium tetraphenylborate. The pipette was filled up with 100 mm NaCl and 10 mm MOPS buffer (pH 7.0). Calibration of the electrodes was carried out in oocyte saline with Na+ concentrations of 5, 10, 15, and 84.5 mm; on average, the electrodes responded with 52 mV for a 10-fold change in the Na+ concentration. As described previously (24Bröer S. Schneider H.P. Bröer A. Rahman B. Hamprecht B. Deitmer J.W. Biochem. J. 1998; 333: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar), optimal pH changes were detected when the electrode was located near the inner surface of the plasma membrane. This was achieved by carefully rotating the oocyte with the impaled electrode. All experiments were carried out at room temperature (22–32 °C). Only oocytes with a membrane potential negative to -30 mV were used for experiments. Calculation of [H+]i—The measurements of pHi were stored digitally using homemade PC software based on the program LabView (National Instruments Germany GmbH, München, Germany) and was routinely converted into intracellular H+ concentration, [H+]i. Thus, changes in the [H+]i are recorded, which take into account the different pH baseline, e.g. measured in HEPES- and CO2/ HCO3--buffered salines (see also Ref. 25Becker H.M. Deitmer J.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 28057-28062Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Amplitude and rate of change of the measured pHi or [H+]i were analyzed. Voltage Clamp Recording—A borosilicate glass capillary, 1.5 mm in diameter, was pulled to a micropipette and backfilled with 3 m KCl. The resistance of the electrodes measured in oocyte saline was around 1 mΩ. For voltage clamp, both electrodes were connected to the head stages of an Axoclamp 2B amplifier (Axon Instruments). The experimental bath was grounded with a chlorided silver wire coated with agar dissolved in oocyte saline. Oocytes were clamped to a holding potential of -40 mV. To obtain current-voltage relationships, the membrane potential was changed stepwise in 20-mV increments between -120 and +20 mV. Fluorescent Staining of NBCe1 and CAII in the Oocyte—Frog oocytes, either injected with cRNA for NBCe1 and CAII, or with 50 ng of CAII, as well as native control oocytes, were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. Oocytes were treated with 100% methanol and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100. Unspecific binding sites were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin and 1% normal goat serum. The cells were incubated in phosphate-buffered saline containing the primary antibodies (guinea pig anti-Na+/ HCO3- cotransporter polyclonal antibody (1:100) and rabbit anti-carbonic anhydrase II (human and bovine erythrocytes) and polyclonal antibody (1:1000, Chemicon International, Inc.) overnight at 4 °C. Oocytes were then incubated with the secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-guinea pig IgG and Alexa Fluor 546 goat anti-rabbit IgG, Molecular Probes, Inc.). The stained oocytes were analyzed with a laser scanning microscope (LSM 510, Carl Zeiss GmbH, Oberkochem, Germany), using whole oocytes, through which cross-sectional optical planes were laid, or the cell surface was viewed. Additionally oocytes were embedded in 2% agarose and sectioned into 300-μm thick slices with a microtome (752M Vibroslice, Campden Instruments Ltd., United Kingdom). Determination of CAII Activity—Activity of CAII was determined by monitoring the 18O depletion of doubly labeled 13C18O2 through several hydration and dehydration steps of CO2 and HCO3- at 25 °C (26Silverman D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 732-752Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar, 27Sültemeyer D.F. Fock H. Canvin D.T. Plant Physiol. 1990; 94: 1250-1257Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The reaction sequence of The relative 18O enrichment was calculated from the measured 45, 47, and 49 abundance as a function of time according to: log enrichment = log(49 × 100/(49 + 47 + 45)). For calculation of the CAII activity of the sample, the rate of 18O degradation was obtained from the linear slope of the log (enrichment) over the time, using the spreadsheet analyzing software Origin 6.0 (Microcal Software Inc.). The rate was compared with the corresponding rate of the non-catalyzed reaction. Enzyme activity in units was calculated from these two values as defined by Badger and Price (28Badger M.R. Price G.D. Plant Physiol. 1989; 89: 51-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). From this definition, 1 unit corresponds to 100% stimulation of the non-catalyzed 18O depletion of doubly labeled 13C18O2. For the experiments, the cuvette was filled with 10 ml of oocyte saline with a pH of 7.35 according to the mean intracellular pH of CAII-injected oocytes at 25 °C. To determine the catalytic activity, CAII expressing oocytes were pipetted into the cuvette in a batch of 20. For calibration, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 μg of CAII were directly added to the cuvette and compared with the activity of oocytes, which either expressed CAII or were injected with CAII. Calculation and Statistics—Statistical values are presented as mean ± S.E. For calculation of significance in differences, Student’s t test or, if possible, a paired t test was used. In the figures shown, a significance level of p ≤ 0.05 is marked with a single asterisk, p ≤ 0.01 a double asterisk, and p ≤ 0.001 with triple asterisks. Expression of NBCe1—NBCe1-expressing oocytes either injected with CAII from bovine erythrocytes or co-expressing CAII-WT, CAII-V143Y, and CAII-HEX, respectively, were stained with Alexa dye-linked antibodies against an epitope of NBCe1 or CAII, respectively (see “Experimental Procedures”). Confocal images of the surface (Fig. 1, A–I) and in cross-sections (Fig. 1, M–O) of oocytes show staining for both NBCe1 (red, Fig. 1, I and N) and CAII (Fig. 1, A–D and M, green) in the plasma membrane of the oocyte, whereas no staining was evident in the cytoplasm. An overlay of both signals (Fig. 1, E–H and O) shows co-localization of the two proteins. Native oocytes treated the same way with the dye-linked antibodies showed no visible staining (Fig. 1, J–L, Q, and R). To confirm that cytosolic CAII was only localized in the plasma membrane, but not in the cytosol, and that the fluorescence was not quenched when optical slices were taken from intact oocytes, a CAII-injected oocyte was sectioned into 300-μm thick slices. The confocal image of the upper part of the slice shows that CAII is only found in the oocytes plasma membrane, but not in the cytosol (Fig. 1P). The same is true for oocytes expressing CAII (data not shown). We do not know what anchors the CAII in the membrane, but because this effect is not only observed in NBCe1-expressing oocytes, but also in native oocytes injected with, or expressing, CAII, CAII itself may bind to the plasma membrane of oocytes. We determined the transport activity of the NBCe1 expressed in Xenopus oocytes by simultaneously measuring the membrane current, the intracellular sodium activity, Na+i, and the intracellular proton activity, H+i, of oocytes voltage-clamped to a membrane holding potential of -40 mV. The NBCe1 was challenged by changing from a HEPES-buffered to a 5% CO2, 24 mm HCO3--buffered solution (Fig. 2A). In NBCe1-expressing oocytes, application of CO2/ HCO3- induced a membrane outward current and a rise in the intracellular H+ and Na+ concentrations. Expression of NBCe1 led to a significant reduction of the CO2-induced intracellular acidification (ΔH+) from 91.1 ± 6.1 to 31.0 ± 3.3 nm (p ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2C). The rate of cytosolic H+ change following introduction of CO2/ HCO3- was also significantly changed by expressing NBCe1, being 33.0 ± 3.3 and 16.4 ± 1.6 nm/min in native and NBCe1-expressing oocytes, respectively (p ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2D), presumably due to the dampening effect of HCO3- influx via the NBCe1 accompanying the diffusion of CO2 into the cells. The acidification was accompanied by a membrane outward current (ΔIm) of 302 ± 30 nA (Fig. 2G) and an increase in cytosolic Na+ concentration (ΔNa+) of 4.17 ± 0.56 mm (Fig. 2E) with a rate of 2.07 ± 0.32 mm/min (Fig. 2F), which was not observed in control oocytes injected with H2O instead of NBCe1/cRNA (Fig. 2, B, F, and G). Furthermore, expression of the NBCe1 substantially increased the membrane conductance (Gm) of the oocytes in CO2/ HCO3--buffered saline from 0.8 ± 0.1 to 6.1 ± 0.1 μS(p ≤ 0.001; Fig. 3, A and C). Application of 0.5 mm of the anion exchange inhibitor DIDS increased the CO2/ HCO3--induced acidification in NBCe1-expressing oocytes by 158%, whereas the membrane current and membrane conductance decreased to 20 and 38%, respectively (data not shown), suggesting reduced NBCe1 activity in the presence of DIDS. The reversal potential (Erev) of the CO2/ HCO3--induced current in NBCe1-expressing oocytes was -55.6 mV, suggesting a stoichiometry of 2 HCO3-:1 Na+. If calculated from an intracellular Na+ concentration of 14.0 ± 3.5 mm and an intracellular HCO3- concentration of 21.0 ± 6.3 mm, reversal potentials of -52.6 and -28.0 mV are predicted for a stoichiometry of 2:1 and 3:1 for the NBCe1, respectively.FIGURE 3Membrane currents and conductance in NBCe1-expressing oocytes with and without injected CAII.

B, CAII-dependent current-voltage relationship (obtained by subtraction of the currents in NBCe1-expressing and in native oocytes with and without injected CAII in CO2/ HCO3--buffered solution). In NBCe1 expressing, but not in native, oocytes, CAII adds an additional membrane conductance of 2.5 μS (C and D).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Effect of CAII Injection—Injection of CAII into native control oocytes resulted in a significant increase in the rate of rise of intracellular H+ concentration (ΔH+/t) from 33.0 ± 3.3 to 128.0 ± 15.8 nm/min following introduction of CO2/ HCO3- (p ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2D). The amplitude of the CO2/ HCO3--induced acidification was, however, not changed by injection of CAII (92.5 ± 6.3 versus 91.1 ± 6.1 nm; Fig. 2C). Injection of CAII into native oocytes did not induce any membrane currents or changes in the cytosolic Na+ concentration (Fig. 2, B and E–G), and did not change the membrane conductance Gm of the oocytes (0.8 ± 0.1 versus 0.9 ± 0.1 μS; Fig. 3, A–C). Injection of CAII into NBCe1-expressing oocytes increased the amplitude of the CO2/ HCO3--induced acidification from 31.0 ± 3.3 to 51.0 ± 6.5 nm (p ≤ 0.05; Fig. 2C), and, like in native, control oocytes, also increased the rate of rise of the intracellular H+ concentration following application of CO2/ HCO3- from 16.4 ± 1.6 to 145.1 ± 35.5 nm/min (p ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2D). In contrast to control oocytes, however, injection of CAII into NBCe1-expressing oocytes increased the membrane current in CO2/ HCO3--buffered solution from 302 ± 30 to 568 ± 37 nA (p ≤ 0.001; Fig. 2G), and the rate of rise in Na+ concentration from 2.07 ± 0.32 to 8.20 ± 1.80 mm/min (p ≤ 0.05; Fig. 2F). The amplitude of the cytosolic Na+ change was not significantly different, indicating an increase in transport rate, but not in absolute amount of transported substrates. Furthermore, injection of CAII added an additional membrane conductance of 2.5 ± 1.6 μS (Fig. 3, B–D), leading to a membrane conductance of 8.7 ± 0.6 μS in NBCe1-expressing oocytes (Fig. 3, A and C). The membrane current in NBCe1-expressing oocytes with CAII injected reversed at -53.5 mV, as compared with -55.6 mV in oocytes not injected with CAII (Fig. 3A). The membrane current attributable to CAII, isolated by subtraction of the I/V curves, had a reversal potential of -46.2 mV, and a slope conductance of 2.5 ± 1.6 μS (Fig. 3, B and D). Thus, these results suggest that injection of CAII into NBCe1-expressing oocytes enhances the transport activity of NBCe1, as indicated by the increased CO2/ HCO3--induced membrane current and conductance, as well as by the increased rate of rise of cytosolic Na+. Effect of EZA on CAII-injected Oocytes—To check whether the increase in NBCe1 activity by CAII injection depends on the catalytic activity of the CAII, we used the potent enzyme inhibitor 6-ethoxy-2-benzothiazolesulfonamide (EZA, 10 μm). Application of EZA to NBCe1-expressing oocytes injected with CAII reduced the rate of rise of the intracellular H+ concentration from 216.2 ± 48.7 to 18.6 ± 3.0 nm/min (p ≤ 0.01; Fig. 4, A and C), the latter value being similar to the values of NBCe1-expressing oocytes not injected with CAII before (18.6 ± 3.0 nm/min) and after (22.2 ± 5.1 nm/min) application of EZA (Fig. 4C, n.s.). This also suggests that the CA activity in native Xenopus oocytes is negligible. EZA decreased the membrane currents in NBCe1-expressing oocytes injected with CAII from 513 ± 55 to 376 ± 48 nA (p ≤ 0.001), a value similar to those of currents in NBCe1-expressing cells not injected with CAII, being 282 ± 29 nA before, and 257 ± 36 nA after application of EZA (Fig. 4B, n.s.). The rate of the CO2/ HCO3--induced rise in the cytosolic Na+ concentration was decreased in the presence of EZA from 8.20 ± 1.18 to 1.91 ± 0.60 mm/min (p ≤ 0.05), a value similar to those for oocytes not injected with CAII, being 2.07 ± 0.32 and 1.86 ± 0.30 mm/min in the absence and presence of EZA, respectively (Fig. 4D, n.s.). Application of 0.1 (v/v) ethanol, the dissolvent of EZA, alone had no effect on the CO2/ HCO3--induced membrane current, rate of rise of intracellular H+ concentration, and membrane conductance (Fig. 4E), indicating that the observed effects of EZA were directly related to the blocker and not to the dissolvent. In summary, blocking the catalytic activity of CAII with EZA reversed the CAII-induced increase in the rate of rise of the cytosolic H+ and Na+ concentrations and in the membrane current, but had no significant effect on these parameters in oocytes not injected with CAII. This indicates that the CAII-mediated enhancement of NBCe1 transport activity is attributable to the catalytic activity of CAII. Dose-response Curve of CAII—Wherea"
https://openalex.org/W2134415527,"NOD2 plays an important role in the innate immunity of the intestinal tract. By sensing the muramyl dipeptide (MDP), a bacterial wall component, NOD2 triggers the NF-κB signaling pathway and promotes the release of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8. Mutations in Nod2 (1007FS, R702W, G908R) impinge on NOD2 functions and are associated with the pathogenesis of Crohn disease, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. Although NOD2 is usually described as a cytosolic receptor for MDP, the protein is also localized at the plasma membrane, and the 1007FS mutation delocalizes NOD2 to the cytoplasm (Barnich, N., Aguirre, J. E., Reinecker, H. C., Xavier, R., and Podolsky, D. K. (2005) J. Cell Biol. 170, 21-26; McDonald, C., Chen, F. F., Ollendorff, V., Ogura, Y., Marchetto, S., Lecine, P., Borg, J. P., and Nunez, G. (2005) J. Biol. Chem. 280, 40301-40309). In this study, we demonstrate that membrane-bound versions of NOD2 and Crohn disease-associated mutants R702W and G908R are capable of responding to MDP and activating the NF-κB pathway from this location. In contrast, the 1007FS mutant remains unable to respond to MDP from the plasma membrane. We also show that NOD2 promotes the membrane recruitment of RICK, a serine-threonine kinase involved in NF-κB activation downstream of NOD2. Furthermore, the artificial attachment of RICK at the plasma membrane provokes a constitutive and strong activation of the NF-κB pathway and secretion of interleukin-8 showing that optimal RICK activity depends upon its subcellular localization. Finally, we show that endogenous RICK localizes at the plasma membrane in the THP1 cell line. Thus, our data suggest that NOD2 is responsible for the membrane recruitment of RICK to induce a regulated NF-κB signaling and production of proinflammatory cytokines.

Resistance to infectious diseases relies on the ability of the organism to prevent the invasion of pathogens and to mount efficient and sustainable immune responses. Epithelial cells act as a fence against external aggressions by forming a barrier between the interior and the exterior of the body. When invasion of pathogens occurs despite this, innate and adaptative immune responses prepare to eradicate the intruders.

NOD2 contains two amino-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a central nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD), and carboxyl-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) (9Inohara N. Nunez G. Nat.

NOD2 is a general sensor for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria because it is able to respond to MDP, a component of bacterial peptidoglycans (11Girardin S.E. Boneca I.G. Viala J.

The NOD2R702W, NOD2G908R, and NOD21007FS mutations are lying in proximity to or within the LRRs of NOD2 thought to be involved in MDP recognition (13Tanabe T. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Zhu L. Qiu S.

The CARDs are required for the binding to RICK (also called Ripk2), a serine-threonine kinase involved in the activation of the NF-κB pathway through ubiquitinylation of IKKγ and phosphorylation of the IκB kinases, which promotes the production of proinflammatory cytokines (10Ogura Y.

In CD patients, increased amounts of activated NF-κB are evidenced in the inflamed epithelial tissues as well as increased amounts of proinflammatory cytokines secreted by lamina propria mononuclear cells such as tumor necrosis factor α and IL-1β in response to lipopolysaccharide (16Rogler G. Brand K. Vogl D. Page S. Hofmeister R. Andus T. Knuechel R. Baeuerle P.A. Scholmerich J. Gross V.

Gut. 1998; 42: 477-484Crossref PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar). Furthermore, knock-in mice carrying two 1007fs alleles (2939iC mutant) have an increased colonic inflammation when treated with dextran sulfate sodium (18Maeda S. Hsu L.C. Liu H. Bankston L.A. Iimura M. Kagnoff M.F. Eckmann L. Karin M. Science. 2005; 307: 734-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar), and stimulation of their bone marrow-derived macrophages with MDP produces a higher NF-κB response, resulting in enhanced secretion of IL-1β. This “gain-of-function” phenotype is further supported by the fact that Nod2-/- mice do not develop an IBD-like phenotype, although they display innate and adaptative immune defects (19Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nunez G. Flavell R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). For example, Nod2-/- mice appear to be deficient in α-defensin production that may affect innate immunity responses and mucosal homeostasis with the commensal flora (19Kobayashi K.S. Chamaillard M. Ogura Y. Henegariu O. Inohara N. Nunez G. Flavell R.A. Science. 2005; 307: 731-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (1489) Google Scholar). Strikingly, this gain of function hypothesis is in contrast with other studies indicating that the NOD21007FS mutation leads to a deficient NOD2 activity. Indeed, peripheral blood mononuclear cells from CD patients carrying the NOD21007FS mutation are unable to secrete proinflammatory chemokine IL-8 in response to MDP or peptidoglycan but are still able to respond to lipopolysaccharide (20van Heel D.A.

Accordingly, in transfected cells, the NOD2-dependent NF-κB activity in response to MDP is lost when the NOD21007FS mutant is expressed, suggesting that it acts as a loss-of-function mutant (12Inohara N.

Immun. 2004; 5: 800-808Crossref Scopus (702) Google Scholar) with splenic macrophages of Nod2-/- mice have highlighted a possible negative role of intact NOD2 on a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) signaling pathway that may explain the increased inflammation observed with the NOD21007FS mutant. Because of its absence of response to MDP, NOD21007FS mutant may cause an excessive lymphocyte T helper type 1 (Th1) cytokine production by enhancing TLR2-mediated -NF-κB activation, particularly through the c-Rel subunit (23Watanabe T.

The paradox may only be apparent, however, and the consequence of the CD-associated NOD21007FS mutation may be either a gain or a loss of function depending on the cellular or animal model and on the readout. In any case, a better understanding on the function of NOD2 at the molecular level within a specific cellular environment is needed.

Recently it has been shown that a pool of NOD2 localizes at the plasma membrane in HEK293 cells and in a polarized epithelial cell model (Caco-2 cells), where it is associated with Erbin, a basolateral protein belonging to the leucine-rich repeat and PDZ family (1Barnich N.

Furthermore, the activity of NOD2 proteins correlates with their ability to localize to the plasma membrane because the NOD21007FS mutant, delocalized to the cytoplasm, is unable to properly activate NF-κB in response to MDP (1Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). In this study we have further investigated the activity of NOD2 that triggers NF-κB activation at the plasma membrane. We demonstrate that an enforced localization of NOD2 at the plasma membrane maintains its NF-κB activity. We also show that NOD2 recruits RICK at the plasma membrane, thus promoting NF-κB activation and IL-8 secretion. Taken together, these data emphasize the importance of membrane localization of NOD2 and RICK to trigger an optimal NF-κB activation. Cell Culture—HEK293T and MDCKII cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FCS decomplemented, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin sulfate. Caco-2 cells were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 20% FCS decomplemented, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin sulfate. HCT116 were grown in McCoy’s medium containing penicillin and streptomycin and 10% FCS. THP1 cells were grown in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% FCS decomplemented. Cell transfections were performed using FuGENE 6 (Roche Applied Science) or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s recommendations. Expression Vectors—All cloning experiments were performed using the Gateway™ system (Invitrogen). All cDNAs were cloned into pDONR™ 201 or pDONR™/Zeo from PCR products. All cDNAs were fully sequenced in pDONR and subsequently shuttled into pEGFP-GW, pMyrEGFP-GW, pRK5myc-GW, pECFP-GW. or pEYFP-GW. pECFP-GW and pEYFP-GW are described in Ref. 31Simpson J.C. Wellenreuther R. Poustka A. Pepperkok R. Wiemann S. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 287-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (299) Google Scholar. pEGFP-GW was constructed by subcloning a Gateway cassette into the XbaI and SalI sites of pEGFPC1. pMyrEGFP-GW was created by cloning the PCR product (using pEGFP-C1 (Clontech) as a template and the following primers: Myr-EGFPFW, CGCGCTAGCACCATGGGCTGTGGCTGCAGCTCACACCCGGAAGATGTGAGCAAGGGCGAGGAGCTGT, and Myr-EGFP-RV, GTTATCTAGATCCGGTGGATCC) into pEGFP-GW (NheI and XhoI). Mutations in NOD2 cDNA were introduced using the QuikChange™ mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Biochemical Procedures—Cells were rinsed twice in cold PBS and lysed in buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 1 mm EGTA, 150 mm NaCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, supplemented with 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm orthovanadate, and Protease Inhibitors Mixture (Sigma). Triton-soluble proteins were recovered in the supernatant of a 20-min centrifugation at 13,000 × g and at 4 °C. For cell fractionation, cells were lysed in hypotonic buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl) using a Dounce homogenizer (20 strokes). Sucrose and EDTA were added to the homogenate to a final concentration of 0.25 m and 1mm, respectively, and nonhomogenized debris was removed by centrifugation at 3,500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was termed the hypotonic fraction. The pellet was then resuspended in lysis buffer for 10 min at 4 °C and centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant and the pellet were termed Triton X-100-soluble and Triton X-100-insoluble fractions, respectively. Immunofluorescence and Confocal Microscopy—MDCKII cells were grown on Transwell™ filters, washed twice in PBS, 0.1 mm Ca2+, 1 mm Mg2+, and fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C. Cells were permeabilized during 5 min with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature and blocked in 0.25% gelatin for 1 h at room temperature. Antibodies diluted in the blocking buffer were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After four 15-min washes, the cells were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with secondary antibodies coupled to fluorescent probes. Cells were washed and filters were mounted in Dako (The Jackson Laboratory) for confocal microscopy analyses on an Olympus IX70 (Fluoview 500). For HEK293T and HCT116 cells, immunofluorescence labeling was done on coverslips 16-20 h following transfection. Coverslips were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, washed three times in PBS, permeabilized in Triton 0.2%, blocked in 3% bovine serum albumin/PBS one time, and incubated with an anti-Myc monoclonal antibody (9E10; 0.4 μg/ml). After 1 h of incubation and five washes in PBS, coverslips were incubated 45 min with a secondary goat anti-mouse antibody (highly cross-adsorbed) coupled to Alexa 594 (Molecular Probes). Finally, the cells were washed extensively and mounted in Dako (The Jackson Laboratory) or Vectashield for microscopic analysis on a Zeiss Axiovert 200M microscope. HEK293T or HCT116 expressing EGFP, ECFP, or EYFP fusion proteins were washed in PBS, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, washed in PBS, and mounted directly for microscopic analysis.

Secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase and used for Western blotting are from DakoCytomation and The Jackson Laboratory. Secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa fluorophores for immunofluorescent experiments are from Molecular Probes. MDP (Sigma) was used at 50-500 ng/ml. NF-κB Activation and ELISAs—HEK293T cells were plated at 105 cells/well in 24-well plates and transfected 1 day after with 150 ng of pNF-κB-luciferase Firefly (Clontech), 15 ng of pGL4-TK-luciferase Renilla (Promega), and 2-10 ng of NOD2 or RICK pEGFP-expressing plasmid. Transfected cells were stimulated or not for 20-24 h with 50 ng/ml MDP, then lysed in 1× reporter lysis buffer (Promega), and assayed for Firefly luciferase (Yelen Corp.) or for Firefly and Renilla luciferase sequentially (Promega). Firefly luciferase values were normalized by dividing by the amount of protein or by the Renilla luciferase values. Averages and standard deviations were calculated from duplicate wells using Microsoft Excel. Each experiment was done at least three times. HEK293T cells were plated at 105 cells/well in 24-well plates, transfected the following day, and then stimulated with MDP ligand for 20-24 h. Cell culture supernatants were collected kept at -20 °C, and IL-8 levels were assayed by ELISA according to the manufacturer’s instructions (R&D Biosystems or Clinisciences). Supernatants of transiently transfected HEK293T were also analyzed on a Proteoplex 16-well human cytokine array kit (Novagen) to detect in parallel 12 human cytokines. Proteoplex slide was treated and scanned as recommended by the manufacturer. NOD2 Localizes at the Plasma Membrane of Epithelial Cells—NOD2 is a multimodular protein containing two amino-terminal CARD domains, a central NOD, and a carboxyl-terminal LRR domain (Fig. 1A). To evaluate the subcellular localization of NOD2 in epithelial cells, we expressed EGFP fused to the amino terminus of NOD2 or NOD2 mutants in HEK293T cells and evaluated their expression. Comparable amounts of proteins were detected by Western blot using anti-GFP antibody (Fig. 1A). Activity of EGFP-NOD2 was next assessed by transcriptional assays and ELISAs. Expression of EGFP-NOD2 in HEK293T cells results in an increase of NF-κB activity measured by a κB-luciferase reporter gene in an MDP-dependent manner (Fig. 1B). As expected from previous studies, introduction of the 1007FS, R702W, and G908R mutations within the EGFP-NOD2 sequence impaired with various degrees the MDP-dependent NF-κB transcriptional activity of the protein (Fig. 1B). Although EGFP-NOD21007FS, a mutant unable to respond to MDP, had basal NF-κB activity, EGFP-NOD2R702W and EGFP-NOD2G908R maintained their inducible NF-κB activity following MDP stimulation, as reported elsewhere (12Inohara N. Ogura Y. Fontalba A. Gutierrez O. Pons F. Crespo J. Fukase K. Inamura S. Kusumoto S. Hashimoto M. Foster S.J. Moran A.P. Fernandez-Luna J.L. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 5509-5512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1413) Google Scholar), albeit with a small decrease in intensity (Fig. 1B). In contrast, no difference is observed in IL-8 secretion between the EGFP-NOD2R702W and EGFP-NOD2G908R mutants and the wild type construct (Fig. 1B). As a control, we also expressed EGFP-NOD2LRR that encompasses the LRRs of NOD2 (Fig. 1A). No NF-κB activity was detected with this construct (data not shown). To correlate the NF-κB transcriptional activity with a biological response, we analyzed the level of different cytokines secreted in the medium of HEK293T cells transfected with EGFP-NOD2 and EGFP-NOD21007FS. Out of 12 cytokines tested, we only observed a significant increase of IL-8 (supplemental Fig. S1). Therefore, in this cellular model, the NF-κB transcriptional activity of EGFP-NOD2 and its mutants was correlated to the amount of the secreted proinflammatory chemokine interleukine-8 (IL-8) in the supernatants of transfected cells (Fig. 1B). As expected, the release of IL-8 from HEK293T cells transfected with EGFP-NOD21007FS was not increased following MDP stimulation. Inspection of the localization of the proteins in these cells reveals that EGFP-NOD2 is a membrane-associated protein as shown previously (1Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Interestingly, EGFP-NOD21007FS is no longer found at the plasma membrane and has a cytoplasmic distribution (Fig. 1C), whereas the EGFP-NOD2R702W and EGFP-NOD2G908R mutants are still found at the plasma membrane (data not shown and see Ref. 1Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar). Thus, the loss of inducible NF-κB activity upon MDP treatment of NOD21007FS is correlated to its loss of membrane localization. The 1007FS Mutation Impairs the Basolateral Localization of NOD2—We have already shown that NOD2 is localized basolaterally in polarized Caco-2 cells (2McDonald C. Chen F.F. Ollendorff V. Ogura Y. Marchetto S. Lecine P. Borg J.P. Nunez G. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 40301-40309Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). We confirm here by using another well recognized model of polarized epithelial cells (MDCKII) that EGFP-NOD2 is localized at the basolateral membrane compartment and that the NOD21007FS mutation abrogates this membrane localization (supplemental Fig. S2). Activity of myr-EGFP-NOD2 and myr-EGFP-NOD2FS—Barnich et al. (1Barnich N. Aguirre J.E. Reinecker H.C. Xavier R. Podolsky D.K. J. Cell Biol. 2005; 170: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) have proposed that the presence of NOD2 at the plasma membrane is a prerequisite of its NF-κB activity. If so, targeting of NOD2 at the plasma membrane should provide a maximal activation of the protein. We thus constructed a myristoylated version of EGFP-NOD2 by fusing the first 11 amino acids of Lck to EGFP (myr-EGFP-NOD2) and transfected HEK293T cells to study the localization and the activity of the myristoylated protein. This construct strongly localizes at the plasma membrane in cells in contrast to EGFP-NOD2, which is more weakly found at the cell periphery and more abundant in the cytosol (Fig. 2A and data not shown). However, overexpression of myr-EGFP-NOD2 exhibits NF-κB activity comparable with the nonmyristoylated form as indicated by the luciferase NF-κB reporter assay and IL-8 secretion (Fig. 2, B and C). Because enforcing the plasma membrane localization of NOD2 has only a slight effect on basal NF-κB activity and induction upon MDP stimulation, we can conclude that a limiting factor prevents a further increased activity of the myristoylated EGFP-NOD2 at the plasma membrane. Because EGFP-NOD21007FS does not localize at the plasma membrane, we ask the question whether enforcing EGFP-NOD21007FS localization to the plasma membrane may rescue its MDP response. The myristoylated EGFP-NOD21007FS protein was expressed in HEK293T cells, and NF-κB transcriptional activity as well as IL-8 secretion were measured (Fig. 2, C and D). Although myr-EGFP-NOD21007FS is readily found at the plasma membrane (Fig. 2A), it is unable to induce NF-κB transcriptional activity or IL-8 secretion in response to MDP (Fig. 2, C and D). Therefore, the impaired NF-κB transcriptional activity of EGFP-NOD21007FS in response to MDP is not linked to its cytosolic localization but rather to its inability to recognize MDP. Surprisingly, the ability of the myr-EGFP-NOD21007FS mutant to induce NF-κB and mostly to produce IL-8 is decreased compared with the nonmyristoylated protein (Fig. 2, B and C). This suggests that membrane localization of NOD21007FS may have a negative effect on IL-8 production through a signaling pathway different from the NF-κB signaling. Membrane targeting of the other different CD-associated mutants (R702W and G908R) and the Blau mutant (R334Q) of NOD2 by myristoylation has little if any effect on NF-κB transcriptional activity and IL-8 production (Fig. 2D and data not shown). From these experiments we can conclude th"
https://openalex.org/W2027920581,"The inhibitory PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim) domain protein (IPAS), a dominant negative regulator of hypoxia-inducible transcription factors (HIFs), is potentially implicated in negative regulation of angiogenesis in such tissues as the avascular cornea of the eye. We have previously shown IPAS mRNA expression is up-regulated in hypoxic tissues, which at least in part involves hypoxia-dependent alternative splicing of the transcripts from the IPAS/HIF-3α locus. In the present study, we demonstrate that a hypoxia-driven transcriptional mechanism also plays a role in augmentation of IPAS gene expression. Isolation and analyses of the promoter region flanking to the first exon of IPAS gene revealed a functional hypoxia response element at position –834 to –799, whereas the sequence upstream of the HIF-3α first exon scarcely responded to hypoxic stimuli. A transient transfection experiment demonstrated that HIF-1α mediates IPAS promoter activation via the functional hypoxia response element under hypoxic conditions and that a constitutively active form of HIF-1α is sufficient for induction of the promoter in normoxic cells. Moreover, chromatin immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays showed binding of the HIF-1 complex to the element in a hypoxia-dependent manner. Taken together, HIF-1 directly up-regulates IPAS gene expression through a mechanism distinct from RNA splicing, providing a further level of negative feedback gene regulation in adaptive responses to hypoxic/ischemic conditions.

Taken together, HIF-1 directly up-regulates IPAS gene expression through a mechanism distinct from RNA splicing, providing a further level of negative feedback gene regulation in adaptive responses to hypoxic/ischemic conditions. Cellular adaptation to hypoxic conditions is accompanied by changes in expression of a panel of genes encoding physiologically relevant proteins (1Semenza G.L. Roth P.H. Fang H.M. Wang G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23757-23763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Shweiki D. Itin A. Soffer D. Keshet E. Nature. 1992; 359: 843-845Crossref PubMed Scopus (4163) Google Scholar, 3Jelkmann W.

These genes have been shown to contain hypoxia response elements (HREs) 2The abbreviations used are: HRE, hypoxia response element; IPAS, inhibitory PAS domain protein; HIF, hypoxia-inducible factor; Arnt, arylhydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator; VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor; MBEC, mouse brain endothelial cell(s); EMSA, electrophoretic mobility shift assay; Epo, erythropoietin; HBS, HIF-1-binding site; CMV, cytomegalovirus; RT, reverse transcription; PGC-1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ coactivator-1; ChIP, chromatin immunoprecipitation; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; nt, nucleotide(s). in their promoter regions. Under hypoxic conditions the response elements are recognized by a hypoxia-inducible transcription factor (HIF)-1, a heterodimeric complex of the basic helix-loop-helix PAS (Per/Arnt/Sim) domain proteins HIF-1α and HIF-1β (Arnt) (4Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1230-1237Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1729) Google Scholar). In addition, the HIF-1α paralogs HIF-2α (5Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K.

Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 3320-3324Crossref PubMed Scopus (520) Google Scholar) and HIF-3α (7Gu Y.Z. Moran S.M. Hogenesch J.B. Wartman L. Bradfield C.A. Gene Expr. 1998; 7: 205-213PubMed Google Scholar) dimerize with Arnt in hypoxic cells to form DNA-binding complexes. Two distinct mechanisms are important for regulation of HIF-1α and HIF-2α activity by oxygen. Under normoxic conditions, HIF-α is targeted by the von Hippel-Lindau protein (pVHL) for ubiquitylation and rapid proteasomal degradation (8Maxwell P.H. Wiesener M.S. Chang G.W. Clifford S.C. Vaux E.C. Cockman M.E. Wykoff C.C. Pugh C.W. Maher E.R. Ratcliffe P.J. Nature. 1999; 399: 271-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (4152) Google Scholar, 9Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). pVHL binding is mediated through hydroxylation of specific prolyl residues located in the central region of HIF-α proteins. Hydroxylation at the 4-position of those prolines of HIF-α enables formation of two hydrogen bonds to pVHL and increases the binding of pVHL to HIF-α by several orders of magnitude (10Masson N. Willam C. Maxwell P.H. Pugh C.W. Ratcliffe P.J. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 5197-5206Crossref PubMed Scopus (858) Google Scholar). This post-translational modification of HIF-α is catalyzed by HIF-prolyl hydroxylases, a set of dioxygenases that require O2, Fe(II), and 2-oxoglutarate as cosubstrates. At low oxygen levels, there is a corresponding decrease in prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-α, resulting in release of pVHL and stabilization of HIF-α protein (11Schofield C.J. Ratcliffe P.J. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol. 2004; 5: 343-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (1622) Google Scholar, 12Kaelin W.G. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2005; 74: 115-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar). Stabilized HIF-α then translocates to the nucleus where it dimerizes with Arnt to bind to the HREs of target genes (13Poellinger L. Johnson R.S. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2004; 14: 81-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). Recently, a similar mode of regulation of HIF-3α at the protein expression level has been suggested (14Maynard M.A. Qi H. Chung J. Lee E.H. Kondo Y. Hara S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Ohh M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 11032-11040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). In addition to stabilization of HIF-α protein levels, hypoxia induces the function of the transactivation domains of HIF-α proteins and enhances their ability to interact with transcriptional coactivator proteins (5Ema M. Taya S. Yokotani N. Sogawa K. Matsuda Y. Fujii-Kuriyama Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 4273-4278Crossref PubMed Scopus (844) Google Scholar, 15Carrero P. Okamoto K. Coumailleau P.

Med. 2000; 6: 1335-1340Crossref PubMed Scopus (474) Google Scholar). Under normoxic conditions this interaction is blocked by hydroxylation of a conserved asparagine residue within C-terminal transactivation domain of HIF-α (17Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). Asparagine hydroxylation is abrogated under hypoxic conditions (17Lando D. Peet D.J. Whelan D.A. Gorman J.J. Whitelaw M.L. Science. 2002; 295: 858-861Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), allowing HIF-α to recruit coactivators. Therefore, it has been speculated that both the prolyl and asparagine hydroxylases modulating HIF-α function may serve as oxygen sensors in the hypoxia signal transduction pathway (18Safran M. Kaelin Jr., W.G. J. Clin. Investig. 2003; 111: 779-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). As yet another determinant of cellular responsiveness to hypoxia, we have identified IPAS, a dominant negative regulator of HIF-α function (19Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Asman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). IPAS targets HIF-α subunits to form a complex lacking binding activity to the HRE and thereby impairs HIF target gene expression under hypoxic conditions. High expression of IPAS was found in the cornea, which correlates with low level of hypoxia-inducible VEGF expression and an avascular phenotype in this tissue. Thus, IPAS defines a novel mechanism of negative regulation of angiogenesis and tissue-specific control of responsiveness to hypoxic conditions (19Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Asman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Interestingly, sequencing of the mouse IPAS genomic structure revealed that IPAS is a splicing variant of the HIF-3α locus (20Makino Y. Kanopka A. Wilson W.J. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32405-32408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). An important physiological aspect of IPAS is its hypoxia-inducible expression. In tissues including brain, heart, lung, and skeletal muscle of mice, expression of IPAS mRNA is up-regulated following exposure to hypoxia, suggesting the presence of a negative feedback mode of regulation of hypoxia-inducible gene expression (19Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Asman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Interestingly, such hypoxia-inducible expression of IPAS is supported at least in part by an alternative splicing mechanism that is observed exclusively under hypoxic conditions in these tissues (20Makino Y. Kanopka A. Wilson W.J. Tanaka H. Poellinger L. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32405-32408Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). Here we demonstrate that IPAS promoter activity is also induced by hypoxia. Functional analyses of the promoter region of IPAS/HIF-3α gene revealed an HRE mediating up-regulation of IPAS gene transcription under hypoxic conditions. HIF-1 binds to the cis-element and plays an essential role in transactivation of the IPAS gene. Thus, the IPAS-mediated negative feedback regulatory circuit in HIF-1-dependent gene regulation involves both hypoxia-dependent alterations in the splicing pattern of IPAS/HIF-3α transcripts as well as transcriptional activation of the IPAS-specific promoter. Plasmids—For construction of a series of IPAS or HIF-3α promoter-driven luciferase reporter plasmids, various lengths of DNA fragments from the 5′-flanking region of IPAS exon 1a or HIF-3α exon 1 were amplified on mouse genomic DNA templates by PCR with flanking 5′-KpnI and 3′-NcoI enzyme restriction site using Platinum pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). The PCR products were enzyme-digested then cloned into the KpnI-NcoI site of pGL3-Basic vector (Promega). Oligonucleotides corresponding to the sequence of the hypoxia-responsive 35-bp region of the IPAS promoter were synthesized and two or three copies of them were inserted in front of luciferase gene to generate reporter plasmids pIPAS/HRE 2x and pIPAS/HRE 3x, respectively. A hypoxia-inducible luciferase reporter containing three tandem repeat of HRE from the erythropoietin gene enhancer, pT81luc/HRE, HIF-1α, or Arnt expression plasmid pCMV4-HIF-1α or pCMV4-Arnt, respectively, and the expression plasmid pcDNA3 HIF-1α/1–396/VP16 encoding a constitutively active form of HIF-1α, have been described elsewhere (19Makino Y.

Ohnuma K. Yamauchi K. Yabe Y. Poellinger L. Okada Y. Morimoto C. Tanaka H. J. Immunol. 2003; 171: 6534-6540Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). To generate an IPAS/HIF-3α mini-gene plasmid, a genomic region containing exon 3, exon 4a, exon 4, and corresponding introns was cloned by PCR using bacterial artificial chromosome encompassing cognate mouse genomic fragment as a template and then ligated into pcDNA-3 vector (Invitrogen). Cell Culture—Primary mouse brain endothelial cells (MBEC) were kindly supplied by Dr. Yihai Cao (Karolinska Institutet) and maintained in Ham’s F-12 medium (Invitrogen) containing 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. Mouse hepatoma Hepa1c1c7 cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in α-minimum essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. MBEC stably integrated with IPAS/HIF-3α mini-gene was established by lipocationic transfection and subsequent selection of the cells by the antibiotics G418 (Promega). Isolation of Tissue Total RNA—Male C57Bl6 mice (8 weeks old) were exposed to either normoxic (21%) or hypoxic (6%) conditions for 6 h and then sacrificed by cervical dislocation, and the organs were removed. Total RNA was isolated from frozen tissues using RNA WIZ reagent (Ambion). All of the animal experiments were approved by the local animal research ethics committee of Institute of Medical Science, The University of Tokyo, Japan, and conducted according to their guidelines. RNase Protection Assays—To generate the templates for an RNA probe, PCR was performed on mouse genomic DNA template using Platinum pfx DNA polymerase (Invitrogen) with the following primers; forward primer, 5′-TCTAGACCCTCCTCCTTCTCGGGA-3′; reverse primer, 5′-AAGCTTCACGCGCTGCAGCCCCAA-3′). The PCR product was digested with HindIII and XbaI and subcloned into the corresponding site of pcDNA3. The RNA probe was transcribed on the XbaI-digested templates by T7 RNA polymerase-based MAXI script in vitro transcription kit (Ambion) incorporating 32P-labeled UTP. The full-length 202-bp riboprobe was separated and isolated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel. The assay was performed using RPA III assay kit (Ambion). Briefly, the probe was coprecipitated with 50 μg of total RNA from the normoxic/hypoxic tissues, dissolved in hybridization buffer, and incubated at 42 °C for 18 h, followed by the digestion with the mixture of RNase A and T1. The protected RNA fragments were precipitated, denatured, then separated on an acrylamide gel, and visualized by autoradiography. RT-PCR—For synthesis of first strand cDNA, 2 μg of DNase-treated total RNA from mouse tissues were reversely transcribed by Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using oligo(dT)18 primers, according to the manufacturer’s protocol. PCR amplification using 1 μl of the first strand cDNA as a template was carried out in a total volume of 30 μl of mixture composed of 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.3), 50 mm KCl, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 200 μm dNTPs, 0.25 μm each of the sense and anti-sense primers, 1 unit of ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan). Amplification by 33 cycles of a step program (94 °C for 30 s, 51 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min) was performed after 3 min of denaturing of the samples at 94 °C. The identities of the PCR products were confirmed by sequencing. Oligonucleotide PCR primers were as follows: exons 1a of IPAS, forward (primer 1): 5′-AAGGGCGAGCATGGCGTTG-3′; exons 1 of HIF-3α, forward (primer 2): 5′-AGGACAGAGGGCCTTAGGCA-3′; exon 2 of IPAS/HIF-3α, reverse (primer 3): 5′-GGCGCATGATGGAGGCCTTG-3′. Transient Transfection and Luciferase Assay—MBEC and Hepa1c1c7 cells were seeded in 6-well culture plate and transiently transfected with 1.0 μg of IPAS/HIF-3α promoter luciferase by the Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen). When indicated, HIF-1α, Arnt, or HIF-1α/1–396/VP16 expression plasmids were cointroduced into the cells. After 6 h of incubation, the culture medium was replaced with fresh medium and incubated for a further 24 h under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions, and then cellular extracts were prepared for luciferase activity measurement. pRL-SV40 vector (Promega) expressing Renilla reniformis luciferase under control by SV40 early enhancer/promoter was used as an internal control reporter for normalization of transfection efficiency. Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay—Nuclear extracts were prepared from normoxic or hypoxic MBEC as described previously (19Makino Y. Cao R. Svensson K. Bertilsson G. Asman M. Tanaka H. Cao Y. Berkenstam A. Poellinger L. Nature. 2001; 414: 550-554Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar). Five micrograms of nuclear extract was incubated with 32P-labeled W18 HRE probe (22Wang G.L. Semenza G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 21513-21518Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or an oligonucleotide probe encompassing the hypoxia-responsive region of the IPAS promoter (IPAS –834/–799) and its mutants (M1–M5) for 20 min on ice in a total volume of 30 μl containing 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 60 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 2% Ficoll, and 500 ng of poly(dI-dC) (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) and separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels at 200 V in 0.5× TBE (1× TBE: 89 mm Tris, 89 mm boric acid, 5 mm EDTA) buffer. The sequence of the sense strands of the oligonucleotides were as follows: 5′-CCCAAACCTGCATACGGAAGGAACACTGCTCCTTCACCCCTGT-3′ (IPAS –834/–799), 5′-CCCAAACCTGCATACGGAAGGAACACTGCTCCTTTTTCCCTGT-3′ (M1), 5′-CCCAAACCTGCATACGGAAGGAATTTTGCTCCTTCACCCCTGT-3′ (M2), 5′-CCCAAACCTGCATACGGAAGGAATTTTGCTCCTTTTTCCCTGT-3′ (M3), 5′-CCCAAACCTGCATACGGAAGGAACACTGCTCTTTCACCCCTGT-3′ (M4), and 5′-CCCAAACCTGCATACGGAAGGAACACTGCTCCTTCACTTTTGT-3′ (M5). When indicated, 20 molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide or unspecific oligonucleotide was introduced to the reaction mixture for competition assay, and antibodies were used for induction of larger protein-DNA complexes. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Analysis—For the ChIP analysis, MBEC were cultured under either normoxic or hypoxic conditions for 6 h, washed once in PBS, and then incubated in PBS + 1% formaldehyde at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were washed with ice-cold PBS and then scraped into cold 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.7), 10 mm dithiothreitol, incubated for 15 min at 30 °C, and subsequently pelleted at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The pellets were sequentially washed with cold PBS, Buffer I (0.25% Triton X-100, 10 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5), and Buffer II (200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, pH 6.5). The pellets were then resuspended in lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) containing 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science) and thereafter sonicated until DNA was 500–700 bp in size. The samples were diluted 1:10 in 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1× Complete protease inhibitor mixture, and then incubated by rotation with 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA, 6 μg of anti-human IgG antibodies (rabbit polyclonal, Abcam, Cambridge, UK) and 45 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences) for 2 h at 4 °C. Supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 15 s and incubated at 4 °C overnight by rotation with antibodies against HIF-1α (rabbit polyclonal, Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO) or mouse IgG (rabbit polyclonal) as a negative control. 2 μg of sheared salmon sperm DNA. Thereafter 45 μl of 50% protein G-Sepharose slurry were then added and incubated by rotation for another 2 h at 4°C. The Sepharose beads were collected at 3000 rpm for 15 s and sequentially washed for 15 min each under rotation with TSE I (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 150 mm NaCl), TSE II (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mm EDTA, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1, 500 mm NaCl), and Buffer III (0.25 m LiCl, 1% Nonidet P-40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.1) at room temperature. The beads were washed three times with TE buffer followed by elution in 1% SDS, 0.1 m NaHCO3 (3000 rpm, 15 s). The supernatants were incubated overnight at 65 °C, and DNA was purified using the PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The DNA was then used for 35 cycles of PCR together with primers flanking the putative HRE within the IPAS gene promoter: forward, CAATAAATCCATTTCTGCCGCA, and reverse, GAGAGGGCGTGGACACTAAGGA. Primers flanking the HRE of the VEGF gene promoter were used as a positive control: forward, AACAAGGGCCTCTGTCTGCCCA, and reverse, TTGTGGCACTGAGAACGGGGGT. Hypoxia-dependent Up-regulation of IPAS Gene Transcription—To examine the involvement of the IPAS promoter in hypoxia-inducible IPAS gene expression, we performed RNase protection assays for determination of the level of mRNA containing exon 1a of the IPAS/HIF-3α gene. Total RNA extracted from the heart of mice either exposed to normoxic or hypoxic conditions was hybridized with an RNA probe encompassing IPAS exon 1a and its 138-base upstream sequence and then subjected to RNase digestion. The protected mRNA fragment corresponding to the transcript spanning from nt 1 to 62 of exon 1a was readily detected in RNA samples from normoxic mice, indicating basal transcriptional levels of the IPAS gene (Fig. 1A). In the heart from mice exposed to hypoxic conditions, the amount of the protected fragment containing IPAS exon 1a was clearly increased, whereas the level of β-actin mRNA was constant, demonstrating that the transcripts initiated upstream of IPAS exon 1a were specifically up-regulated by hypoxia (Fig. 1A). In excellent agreement with these observations, RT-PCR analysis using primers recognizing IPAS exon 1a and 2 showed up-regulation of the content of exon 1a in the transcripts isolated from hypoxic mouse heart tissue. Interestingly, the same RT-PCR analysis employing a primer pair specific for HIF-3α exon 1 showed only a modest increase of the transcript containing HIF-3α exon 1(Fig. 1B). Taken together, these data indicate that hypoxia specifically up-regulates transcription initiating in an upstream of IPAS exon 1a of the mouse HIF-3α. Localization of the Sequence-mediating Hypoxia-dependent Activation of the IPAS Promoter—To further investigate the mechanism of hypoxia-dependent activation of the IPAS promoter, we generated and cloned into a luciferase expression vector a series of truncated fragments of the 5′-flanking region of the IPAS gene (Fig. 2A). MBEC were transiently transfected with these reporter plasmids and cultured either under normoxic (21% O2) or hypoxic (1% O2) conditions prior to monitoring of cellular luciferase activity (Fig. 2B). Cells transfected with pIPAS/–350 or with pIPAS/–678 luciferase reporter carrying 350- or 678-bp-long segments of the IPAS gene upstream from the ATG in exon 1a, respectively, failed to show an increase of luciferase expression in response to hypoxia. Reporter constructs containing longer fragments of the IPAS promoter such as pIPAS/–1061, pIPAS/–1220, pIPAS/–1855, pIPAS/–2205, pIPAS/–2748, and pIPAS/–3548, produced similarly low levels of cellular luciferase activity under normoxic conditions. In contrast, under hypoxic conditions, these reporter plasmids showed 2–3-fold higher expression of luciferase, as compared with normoxic cells, indicating that a region mediating hypoxia-inducible IPAS gene transcription is localized between positions –678 and –1061 of the IPAS promoter (Fig. 2B). On the other hand, luciferase reporters fused to DNA fragments encompassing ∼1.5, 2.7, and 3.5 kb upstream of HIF-3α exon 1 showed only basal levels of luciferase expression even following exposure to hypoxic conditions. Thus, in agreement with the lack of hypoxia-dependent generation of transcripts spanning HIF-3α exon 1, these data suggest that the HIF-3α promoter is not inducible by hypoxia (Fig. 2B). In support of this conclusion, experiments similarly conducted in a similar fashion in a different cell line, Hepa1c1c7 cells demonstrated the same location of the hypoxia-responsive region of the IPAS promoter, i.e. a location between nt –1061 and –678. Moreover, no hypoxia-dependent induction of the HIF-3α promoter was observed in these cells (Fig. 2C). Taken together, these data demonstrated that this sequence localized upstream of IPAS exon 1a mediates hypoxia-dependent induction of IPAS gene transcription. Effect of HIF-1 on Promoter Activity of the IPAS Gene—To determine the involvement of HIF-1 in the hypoxia-dependent increase of IPAS promoter activity, the same set of luciferase reporters containing IPAS promoter sequences was cotransfected with a HIF-1α expression plasmid into MBEC. It has been described that overexpression of wild type HIF-1α by transient transfection induces HRE-regulated transcription to some extent even under normoxic conditions (23Hu C.J. Wang L.Y. Chodosh L.A. Keith B. Simon M.C. Mol. Cell Biol. 2003; 23: 9361-9374Crossref PubMed Scopus (1069) Google Scholar, 24Leonard M.O. Cottell D.C. Godson C. Brady H.R. Taylor C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 40296-40304Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar), possibly because of saturation of endogenous pVHL levels and ensuing stabilization of the HIF-1α protein (9Tanimoto K. Makino Y. Pereira T. Poellinger L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4298-4309Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Reporter gene activities by pIPAS/–350 and pIPAS/–678 were not influenced by coexpression of HIF-1α under normoxic culture conditions and not increased upon exposure to hypoxia (Fig. 3A). In contrast, activity of reporter constructs such as pIPAS/–1061, pIPAS/–1220, pIPAS/–1855, pIPAS/–2205, pIPAS/–2748, and pIPAS/–3548 were clearly augmented following coexpression of HIF-1α under normoxic conditions and further increased by hypoxia (Fig. 3A). On the other hand, overexpression of Arnt in the presence of the same panel of reporter plasmids (pIPAS/–1061, pIPAS/–1220, pIPAS/–1855, pIPAS/–2205, pIPAS/–2748, and pIPAS/–3548) in MBEC resulted neither in up-regulation of basal luciferase activity under normoxic conditions nor in further hypoxia-dependent enhancement of the activity of the reporter genes (Fig. 3B). Taken together, IPAS promoter activity was increased by overexpression of HIF-1α, and the region mediating the effect of HIF-1α coincided with the locus responsible for hypoxia-inducible induction of the IPAS promoter. Determination of the Functional Hypoxia Response Element in the IPAS Gene Promoter—To precisely map the cis-acting element mediating hypoxia-dependent IPAS promoter activation, we generated another set of luciferase reporters carrying different lengths of DNA fragments containing the 5′-flanking region of the IPAS gene and performed transient transfection assays normalized to SV40 early enhancer/promoter-generated Renilla-derived luciferase activities. MBEC transfected with pIPAS/–771 and pIPAS/–799 showed similar levels of modest luciferase activity either under normoxic or hypoxic conditions. In contrast, reporters pIPAS/–834 and pIPAS/–863 responded to hypoxia by expressing higher level of luciferase activity (Fig. 4A). These data suggested that an element of 35 bp between positions –834 and –799 of IPAS promoter is responsible for hypoxia-mediated activation of IPAS gene transcription. In an excellent agreement with these observations, pIPAS/–902, pIPAS/–964, pIPAS/–1023, and pIPAS/–1061, as well as the reporter constructs containing a longer fragment of IPAS promoter, pIPAS/–1220, showed the hypoxia-dependent induction response, whereas pIPAS/–678, pIPAS/–746 did not respond (Fig. 4B). In strong support of these observations, chimeric reporter constructs carrying two or three copies of this 35-bp region in front of the luciferase gene produced transcriptional response to hypoxia in a copy number-dependent manner (Fig. 4C). Moreover, removal of the sequences carrying the 35-bp region from hypoxia-responsive pIPAS/–1220, generating a reporter construct named pIPAS/–1220(Δ–891/–799), pIPAS/–1220(Δ–845/–799), and pIPAS/–1220(Δ–834/–799), resulted in loss of the hypoxia-dependent induction response (Fig. 4D). These data demonstrate that the 35-bp region of the IPAS promoter is critical for induction under hypoxic conditions. To further characterize the hypoxia-responsive 35-bp element of the IPAS promoter, we tested the effect of HIF-1α on the function of the region. To this end, we employed the expression plasmid for the constitutively active form of HIF-1α in reporter gene assays using IPAS promoter-luciferase constructs. As a constitutively active form of HIF-1α, we used a chimeric protein of truncated HIF-1α (lacking the degradation domain and endogenous transactivation function) fused to the activation domain of the viral transcription factor VP16: HIF-1α/1–396/VP16. This fusion protein has been shown to activate HRE-driven luciferase gene expression even under normoxic conditions, thus allowing us to test the direct effect of HIF-1α without the influence of other signaling pathways in the hypoxic cells (25Nakamura H. Makino Y. Okamoto K. Poellinger L. Ohnuma K. Morimoto C. Tanaka H. J. Immunol. 2005; 174: 7592-7599Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The IPAS promoter-luciferase reporter genes pIPAS/–834, pIPAS/–1061, and pIPAS/–1220 were induced by HIF-1α/1–396/VP16 in normoxia to levels comparable with those observed under hypoxic conditions. In contrast, neither pIPAS/–771 nor pIPAS/–799 responded to coexpression"

Oxidation of Grx1 induced a complex pattern of disulfide-bonded dimers and oligomers formed between Cys-8 and either Cys-79 or Cys-83. In addition, an intramolecular disulfide between Cys-79 and Cys-83 was identified, predicted to have a profound effect on the three-dimensional structure. In contrast, mitochondrial Grx2 retains activity upon oxidation, did not form disulfide-bonded dimers or oligomers, and could not be S-nitrosylated. The dimeric iron sulfur cluster-coordinating inactive form of Grx2 dissociated upon nitrosylation, leading to activation of the protein.

It has numerous functions in providing cells with electrons for reduction, is important in detoxification, and serves as a major cellular antioxidant. The redox state of the 2GSH/GSSG (glutathione disulfide) couple is determined by both the concentration of GSH as a squared function and the level of GSSG. In proliferating cells the GSH pool is highly reduced, whereas it becomes more oxidized during growth arrest either because of differentiation or contact inhibition. During severe oxidative stress the ratio of GSSG to GSH increases strongly; upon induction of apoptosis GSH is exported from cells and the GSSG concentration increases (3van den Dobbelsteen D.J.

Grx2 has a high affinity for glutathionylated proteins and the unique ability to use reducing equivalents from both GSH and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) (34Johansson C. Lillig C.H. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 7537-7543Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar). Grx2 promotes cell survival upon treatment with reactive oxygen species-generating apoptotic stimuli. Silencing of Grx2 expression by RNA interference dramatically sensitized HeLa cells to cell death induced by oxidative stress (35Lillig C.H. Loönn M.E. Enoksson M. Fernandes A.P. Holmgren A. Proc.

Grx2 was recently described as the first iron-sulfur protein from the thioredoxin family of proteins (37Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Loönn M.E. Hudemann C. Bill E. Holmgren A. Proc. Natl. Acad.

This iron-sulfur cluster is complexed by the two N-terminal active site thiols of two Grx2 monomers and two molecules of glutathione that are bound non-covalently to the proteins and in equilibrium with glutathione in solution (38Berndt C.

Because holo-Grx2 is enzymatically inactive, it was proposed to serve as redox sensor for the activation of the protein during oxidative stress (37Lillig C.H. Berndt C. Vergnolle O. Loönn M.E.

Grx1s from bovine, rabbit, and pig contain two cysteines (Cys-79 and Cys-83, human Grx1 numbering) C-terminal of the active site, whereas human Grx1 also contains a third cysteine (Cys-8) N-terminal of the active site (Fig. 1). Grx2s from human, mouse, and rat contain two additional cysteines, one located N-terminal (Cys-28, human Grx2 numbering starting at exon II) and the other one C-terminal (Cys-113) to the active site thiol/disulfide pair (42Sagemark J. Elgán T.H. Burglin T.R. Johansson C. Holmgren A. Berndt K.D. Proteins in press. 2007; Google Scholar) (Fig. 1).Grx1 and Grx2 have been implicated in major cellular processes that require strict redox regulation. Oxidation with H2O2 or GSSG has been shown to partially inactivate Grx1 (28Qiao F. Xing K. Liu A. Ehlers N. Raghavachari N. Lou M.F. Investig. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 2001; 42: 743-751PubMed Google Scholar, 43Starke D.W. Chen Y. Bapna C.P. Lesnefsky E.J. Mieyal J.J. Free Radic. Biol.

In the present study, we have analyzed the thiol redox state and the molecular mechanism of oxidation of both Grx1 and Grx2 following treatment with GSSG and S-nitroso-glutathione (GSNO) to understand how glutaredoxins behave upon oxidative conditions. Our results revealed remarkable differences between the two human Grxs that reflect different functions in redox signaling and protection against oxidation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—NAP-5 and Hi-Trap chelating columns were purchased from GE Healthcare. Bovine serum albumin, NADPH, GSH, GSSG, yeast glutathione reductase, reduced and oxidized DTT, SIN-1, and 5-IAF were from Sigma, HED was from Aldrich. GSNO was prepared as previously reported by the reaction of acidified sodium nitrite and glutathione (44Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar).Protein Expression and Purification—Human Grx1 and Grx2 (exon II-IV) were expressed as His-tagged proteins in the BL21-Codon Plus (DE3)-pRIL Escherichia coli strain (Stratagene) and purified on HiTrap chelating columns (GE Healthcare) as previously described (32Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of Grx1 and Grx2 were determined spectrophotometrically using molar extinction coefficients of 3160 and 6880 m-1 cm-1 at 280 nm, respectively (45Gill S.C. von Hippel P.H. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 182: 319-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (5022) Google Scholar).Recombinant rat TrxR was a kind gift from Olle Rengby and Elias Arné;r from the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics, Karolinska Institutet, and expressed and purified as described previously (46Rengby O. Johansson L. Carlson L.A. Serini E. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Karsnas P. Arner E.S. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 2004; 70: 5159-5167Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). The concentration of TrxR was determined from the reduction of 5 mm DTNB, using the relationship that 1200 A412 units ml-1 correspond to 1 mg ml-1 protein (19Luthman M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant human Trx was expressed and purified according to Ren et al. (47Ren X. Bjoörnstedt M. Shen B. Ericson M.L. Holmgren A. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9701-9708Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar).Reduction, Oxidation, and S-Nitrosylation of Human Glutaredoxins—The proteins were reduced by incubating Grx (50–125 μm) with either 10 mm DTT or 10 mm GSH for 30 min at 37 °C followed by desalting on NAP-5 columns (Sephadex G25) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-HCl, 1 mm EDTA, pH 7.5. Oxidized proteins were prepared by incubating the reduced proteins with either 10 mm GSSG or 10 mm oxidized DTT for 30 min at 37 °C, followed by desalting on NAP-5 columns.To study S-nitrosylation, freshly prepared reduced Grx in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA were incubated with 10 equivalents of GSNO for 1 h at 37 °C either aerobically or in an anaerobic work station (Mk3; Don Whitley Scientific, Shipley, UK), and Grx was isolated by chromatography on a NAP-5 column equilibrated with the buffer described above. S-nitrosylation of Grx was confirmed by analyzing the UV-visible spectra of the proteins, because nitrosylated samples exhibit an additional absorbance peak at 335 nm. For quantification, an extinction coefficient of 920 m-1 cm-1 (335 nm) for nitrosothiols was used (44Hart T.W. Tetrahedron Lett. 1985; 26: 2013-2016Crossref Scopus (380) Google Scholar). For denitrosylation of proteins, nitrosylated samples were incubated with 100 molar equivalents of DTT for 60 min at 37 °C followed by NAP-5 Sephadex chromatography as described above.Enzymatic Assays—Enzymatic activity of oxidized and reduced glutaredoxins was determined using hydroxyethyl disulfide (HED) as substrate (19Luthman M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 6686-6690Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.7 mm HED was added to a mixture containing 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 2 mm EDTA, 0.1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm NADPH, 1 mm GSH, and 6 μgml-1 glutathione reductase. After 3 min of preincubation, Grx1 or Grx2 were added to the sample cuvettes and the same volume of buffer to the reference cuvette. The decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was followed using a Shimadzu UV-2100 spectrophotometer. Activity was expressed as μmol NADPH oxidized/min using a molar extinction coefficient of 6200 m-1 cm-1.To study the reaction between GSSG-treated Grx1 and the thioredoxin system, 20 μm GSSG-treated Grx1 in argon-purged PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, and 200 μm NADPH in a final volume of 500 μl were incubated with 40 nm TrxR. The oxidation of NADPH was followed at 340 nm subtracting the identical reference lacking Grx1.Analysis of Protein Thiol Content—The number of free thiols in Grx proteins was determined spectrophotometrically with DTNB as described by Ellman (48Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21072) Google Scholar). In brief, the reduced or oxidized proteins were added to a mixture containing 6 m guanidine hydrochloride in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 1 mm DTNB at room temperature, and the absorbance at 412 nm was determined. Thiols were calculated using a molar extinction coefficient of 13600 m-1 cm-1 (48Ellman G.L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1959; 82: 70-77Crossref PubMed Scopus (21072) Google Scholar).Alkylation using fluorescent 5-(iodoacetamido)-fluorescein (Sigma-Aldrich) was performed as described by Lillig et al. (49Lillig C.H. Potamitou A. Schwenn J.D. Vlamis-Gardikas A. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 22325-22330Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, oxidized Grx1 and Grx2 (20 μm) in 100 mm KPO4, pH 8.0, were incubated with the reductants 5 mm GSH, 5 mm DTT, 275 nm TrxR, and 3.2 mm NADPH or 275 nm Trx, 275 nm TrxR, and 3.2 mm NADPH for 1 h at 37 °Cinan argon atmosphere. The samples were then alkylated in the dark with 6.5 mm 5-(iodoacetamido)-fluorescein (dissolved in N-N-dimethyl formamide) for 30 min at room temperature before separation by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (8–16%, Ready Gels; Bio-Rad). Fluorescence was analyzed on a UV table followed by protein staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue.Determination of the Number of Disulfides in the Active Site of Nitrosylated Grx1—The method is based on the use of NADPH, GSH, and glutathione reductase to specifically reduce the disulfide in the active site of Grx-S2 (Reactions 1 and 2). Grx-S2+GSH→Grx-(SH)2+GSSGReaction 1 NADPH+H+GSSG→NADP++2GSHReaction 2 The final volume of 500 μl of deoxygenated and argon-purged PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA contained 0.1 mg ml-1 bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm NADPH, 1 mm GSH, and 6 μgml-1 GR. The reaction was started by adding Grx1 to the reaction cuvette and buffer to the reference cuvette. NADPH oxidation was followed at 340 nm, and an extinction coefficient of 6200 m-1 cm-1 was used for calculating the number of disulfide bonds in the active site.Mass Spectrometry—Human Grx1 and Grx2 were reduced with DTT or oxidized with GSSG as described above. For analysis by nano-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (nESI-MS), the proteins were alkylated 30 min at room temperature with 25-fold excess of iodoacetamide before digestion for 1 h at 37 °C with trypsin (a ratio of 1:10 trypsin:Grx) in a buffer containing 50% acetonitrile and 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate (50Russell W.K. Park Z.Y. Russell D.H. Anal. Chem. 2001; 73: 2682-2685Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). In a separate experiment the oxidized and reduced proteins were denatured for 20 min at 95 °C in 8 m urea, followed by digestion with trypsin according to the manufacturer’s recommendations (Promega). For mass determination of thiol-alkylated full-length Grx2, 70 μm untagged protein purified as described in Ref. (32Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar) were reduced with 2 mm DTT or oxidized with 2 mm GSSG, alkylated with 25 mm iodoacetamide, and diluted 10-fold with 30% formic acid. The protein was desalted by two rounds of 10-fold concentrating and 10-fold diluting the sample in 30% formic acid using Nanosept Spin Columns (Pall).For nESI-MS, aliquots of protein or tryptic digests were desalted using reverse-phase ZipTip columns (C18; Millipore), eluted in 60% acetonitrile containing 1% acetic acid and analyzed by nano-electrospray mass spectrometry (Q-TOF; Micromass). For identification of fragments and assignment of disulfide bonds, the resulting mass spectra were processed using the MaxEnt3 software (Micromass) and the data (singly charged ions) compared with theoretical tryptic peptide mass maps. For MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, the desalted samples were eluted in 75% acetonitrile containing 1% trifluoroacetic acid, mixed 1:1 (v/v) with a saturated solution of α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid in 50% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and analyzed using the Voyager DE-PRO system (Applied Biosystems).RESULTSEffect of Thiol Oxidation on Grx1 and Grx2—Following overexpression and purification, freshly prepared Grx1 and [Fe,S]-free Grx2 did not contain any free thiols as determined using DTNB in 6 m guanidine HCl. To analyze the effect of oxidation and reduction of the Cys residues on the enzymatic activity, we reduced the proteins with DTT (100 molar equivalents) followed by treatment with GSSG (100 equivalents) and finally re-reduction with DTT. After each step, aliquots of the desalted Grx1 and Grx2 were examined for catalytic activity using the GSH-dependent reduction of the GSH β-mercaptoethanol mixed disulfide (HED assay).For Grx1, we found a decrease in activity after oxidation with GSSG of ∼25% (Fig. 2) and upon treatment with H2O2 of ∼80% (not shown), which is in agreement with earlier observations (32Lundberg M. Johansson C. Chandra J. Enoksson M. Jacobsson G. Ljung J. Johansson M. Holmgren A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 26269-26275Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (257) Google Scholar). Full activity was regained by re-reduction with DTT (>100-fold molar excess for 60 min), suggesting that the partial inactivation was caused by disulfide formation. In contrast, the activity of Grx2 was not affected by treatment with oxidants or reductants (Fig. 2).FIGURE 2Effects of GSSG, GSNO, and SIN-1 on the activity of human glutaredoxins. After treatment of fully reduced human Grx 1 and 2 with GSSG (black bars), GSNO (horizontal and vertical dashed bars for aerobic and anaerobic conditions, respectively), and SIN-1 (diagonal dashed bars), the activity was measured using HED as the substrate. The reversibility of these effects was also investigated after re-reduction of the proteins with DTT followed by a desalting step. The activity of reduced samples (white bars) served as reference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Why were Grx1 and Grx2 differently affected by oxidation of their cysteine residues? To answer this question, we investigated the redox state of the cysteinyl groups in both proteins. First, we analyzed reduced and oxidized proteins using thiol-specific alkylation with the fluorescent probe 5-(iodoacetamido)-fluorescein followed by non-reducing SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3). In addition, we have determined the number of free thiols spectrophotometrically using DTNB in 6 m guanidine HCl (Fig. 4). Oxidation of Grx1 by GSSG led to a complex mixture of monomers, dimers, and oligomers while only a small fraction of the protein kept free thiols (Fig. 3A, lane 1; 0.4 thiols/monomer when probed with DTNB, Fig. 4). The physiological reductant GSH partially reduced Grx1; the number of free thiols increased to 2.5/monomer. The amount of dimeric Grx1 was reduced and no oligomers could be detected (Fig. 3A, lane 2). Incubation of oxidized Grx1 with TrxR, both in the absence and presence of Trx, decreased the amount of oligomeric protein, indicating the reduction of some intermolecular disulfides by TrxR (Fig. 3A, lanes 4 and 5). Reduction of the protein with DTT resulted in complete reduction (4.9 thiols/monomer) and monomerization of the protein (Fig. 3A, lane 3). A kinetic analysis revealed that the incomplete reduction of GSSG-treated Grx1 by TrxR occurs with an initial rate of 4.2 s-1 and consumes a total of 1.6 mol NADPH/mol Grx1 (Fig. 3C). Appropriate control experiments confirmed that Grx1 and TrxR samples were not contaminated with GSSG and glutathione reductase, respectively. Because the disulfide bridge in Grx1 active site is not a substrate for mammalian TrxR, intermolecular disulfides and/or glutathionylated Cys residues must be the targets for TrxR.FIGURE 3Non-reducing SDS-PAGE and thiol-specific fluorescence labeling of reduced, oxidized, and re-reduced Grx1 and Grx2. Reduced Grx1 (A) and Grx2 (B) were oxidized with 10 mm GSSG, desalted (lane 1), and incubated with different reductants (lane 2, 5 mm GSH; lane 3, 5 mm DTT; lane 4, 275 nm TrxR plus 3.2 mm NADPH; or (lane 5) 275 nm TrxR plus 3.2 mm NADPH and 275 nm Trx). Thereafter, the samples were alkylated with the thiol-specific fluorescent alkylator 5-(iodoacetamido)-fluorescein and separated by SDS-PAGE. Images were taken from the resulting fluorescence (panel II) and after staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (panel I). C, the reaction between oxidized Grx1 and TrxR is shown. 20 μm GSSG-treated Grx1 were incubated with 200 μm NADH in 500 μl of argon-purged PBS, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. Then, 40 nm calf liver TrxR were added to the mixture, and oxidation of NADPH was followed at 340 nm. The number of disulfides reduced was given by the equivalents of NADPH oxidized.View Large"
https://openalex.org/W2011360674,"Zinc is an essential micronutrient, so it is important to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of zinc homeostasis, including the functional properties of zinc transporters. Mammalian zinc transporters are classified in two major families: the SLC30 (ZnT) family and the SLC39 family. The prevailing view is that SLC30 family transporters function to reduce cytosolic zinc concentration, either through efflux across the plasma membrane or through sequestration in intracellular compartments, and that SLC39 family transporters function in the opposite direction to increase cytosolic zinc concentration. We demonstrated that human ZnT5 variant B (ZnT5B (hZTL1)), an isoform expressed at the plasma membrane, operates in both the uptake and the efflux directions when expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. We measured increased activity of the zinc-responsive metallothionein 2a (MT2a) promoter when ZnT5b was co-expressed with an MT2a promoter-reporter plasmid construct in human intestinal Caco-2 cells, indicating increased total intracellular zinc concentration. Increased cytoplasmic zinc concentration mediated by ZnT5B, in the absence of effects on intracellular zinc sequestration by the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum, was also confirmed by a dramatically enhanced signal from the zinc fluorophore Rhodzin-3 throughout the cytoplasm of Caco-2 cells overexpressing ZnT5B at the plasma membrane when compared with control cells. Our findings demonstrate clearly that, in addition to mediating zinc efflux, ZnT5B at the plasma membrane can function to increase cytoplasmic zinc concentration, thus indicating a need to reevaluate the current paradigm that SLC30 family zinc transporters operate exclusively to decrease cytosolic zinc concentration.

Zinc is essential to a wide range of cellular processes through functions that include playing a critical structural role in many proteins, including approximately 1,000 human zinc finger transcription factors, and also acting as a catalytic component in several hundred human enzymes (1Andreini C. Banci L. Bertini I. Rosato A. J. Proteome Res. 2006; 5: 196-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (713) Google Scholar). Cell zinc status must be, therefore, tightly regulated. Membrane transporters that mediate cellular zinc uptake and efflux as well as intracellular zinc sequestration play a central role in cellular zinc homeostasis, but functional characterization of many of these transport proteins remains poor. Cloned mammalian cDNAs that encode proteins with either demonstrated or assumed zinc transport activity fall into one of two main families, classified as SLC30 and SLC39 (2Eide D.J. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 796-800Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 3Palmiter R.D. Huang L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). SLC30 family zinc transporters (ZnT transporters in mammalian systems) have been shown to reduce cytosolic zinc concentration by promoting zinc efflux from the cell or transport into intracellular compartments (3Palmiter R.D. Huang L. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 744-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (330) Google Scholar). SLC39 family transporters have been shown to function to increase cytosolic zinc concentration, transporting extracellular zinc into the cell across the plasma membrane or intracellular zinc into the cytosol from intracellular compartments (2Eide D.J.

Researchers have studied the functional properties of zinc transporters belonging to both families through a number of different methodologies that can be divided broadly into two main approaches: (i) direct measurement of transport function and (ii) determination of the effects of transporter expression on cellular responses to zinc (i.e. indirect measurement). Most evidence relating to the function of mammalian SLC30 family transporters is indirect. For example, expression of ZnT1 or ZnT2 rescued a mutant baby hamster kidney cell line from zinc sensitivity (4Palmiter R.D. Cole T.B. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1784-1791Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar, 5Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). Also, ZnT3 knock-out mice failed to accumulate zinc in synaptic vesicles of neurons on which the ZnT3 protein is normally expressed (6Cole T.B. Wenzel H.J. Kafer K.E. Schwartzkroin P.A. Palmiter R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1716-1721Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), and transformation of ZnT4 into a mutant zinc-sensitive yeast strain complemented a mutation in ZRC1, a gene homologous to the mammalian SLC30 family transporters (7Huang L. Gitschier J. Nat. Genet. 1997; 17: 292-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). Direct evidence for zinc transport function within the SLC30 family includes increased zinc efflux and uptake in baby hamster kidney cells expressing ZnT1 (5Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), 65Zn uptake into Golgi-enriched vesicles from Hela cells transfected with ZnT5 (8Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J.

These apparently different reported functional activities of ZnT5 may correspond with two splice variants of the SLC30A5 gene. The sequences reported (8Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J.

The ZnT5 splice variants adopted different subcellular localizations when expressed as fusions to GFP 2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ZnT5B, ZnT5 variant B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MT2a, metallothionein 2a; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. 2The abbreviations used are: GFP, green fluorescent protein; ZnT5B, ZnT5 variant B; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; MT2a, metallothionein 2a; FITC, fluorescein isothiocyanate. from the corresponding transgenes introduced into Chinese hamster ovary cells. Variant A was expressed in the Golgi apparatus, and variant B (ZnT5B) was expressed throughout the cell, including at the plasma membrane (10Jackson K.A. Helston R.M. McKay J.A. O'Neill E.D.

Plasma membrane localization of ZnT5B, specifically localization at the apical membrane, was also observed in human intestinal Caco-2 cells (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), and we also reported previously localization of ZnT5 to the apical enterocyte membrane in human small intestine, using an antibody that may potentially recognize both splice variants (11Cragg R.A. Phillips S.R. Piper J.M. Varma J.S. Campbell F.C. Mathers J.C. Ford D. Gut. 2005; 54: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to examine in more detail the functional properties of ZnT5B, the isoform expressed at the plasma membrane. We present additional data confirming our earlier observations that ZnT5B expressed in X. laevis oocytes functions to increase zinc uptake (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) but also show function in the opposite direction in the same system. In addition, we show increased zinc-responsive reporter gene expression in Caco-2 cells in which ZnT5B was overexpressed, indicative of increased zinc uptake across the plasma membrane. We also show increased intracellular zinc content in cells overexpressing ZnT5B and demonstrate that these effects of ZnT5B are not related to increased accumulation of zinc in the Golgi apparatus or endoplasmic reticulum. The observations bring into question the prevailing view that SLC30 family transporters operate exclusively to reduce cytosolic zinc and demonstrate clearly a role for ZnT5B in cellular zinc uptake. Plasmid Constructs—Plasmid pCR2.1-ZnT5B, for in vitro transcription of ZnT5B, was generated as described previously (10Jackson K.A. Helston R.M. McKay J.A. O'Neill E.D. Mathers J.C. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10423-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCDNA3.1-ZnT5B-myc, for in vitro transcription of ZnT5B with a C-terminal myc epitope tag, was generated by subcloning the ZnT5 insert obtained by restriction digestion of pCR2.1-ZnT5B with EcoRI into the plasmid pCDNA3.1/myc-HisA (Invitrogen). Plasmid pEGFP-ZnT5B, for expression of ZnT5B as an N-terminal fusion to GFP in Caco-2 cells, was generated as described previously (10Jackson K.A. Helston R.M. McKay J.A. O'Neill E.D. Mathers J.C. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 282: 10423-10431Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Plasmid pCDNA3.1-ZnT5B, for expression of ZnT5B in Caco-2 cells, was generated by restriction digestion of pEGFP-ZnT5B with ApaI and XhoI followed by ligation into the plasmid pCDNA3.1/Zeo (Invitrogen). The plasmid pBlue-MT2a, including the Escherichia coli β-galactosidase reporter gene downstream of the human MT2a promoter (from -358 to +40), was generated as described previously (12Helston R.M. Phillips S.R. McKay J.A. Jackson K.A. Mathers J.C. Ford D. Placenta, in press. 2006; Google Scholar). In Vitro Transcription of ZnT5B RNA—Plasmids pCR2.1-ZnT5B and pCDNA3.1-ZnT5-myc were linearized 3′ of the ZnT5 insert using the restriction endonuclease SstI. RNA was transcribed from the T7 promoter upstream of the ZnT5B cDNA using the mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Measurement of ZnT5B Activity in X. laevis Oocytes—X. laevis oocytes were prepared and injected with ZnT5B RNA or water as described previously (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). Zinc uptake into oocytes was measured by incubating groups of 8–10 oocytes for 30 min in 300 μl of uptake buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm ascorbic acid, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.0) plus 12 μm ZnCl2 including 6.4 μCi/ml 65Zn2+ (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Oocytes were washed three times in uptake buffer before measuring 65Zn2+ incorporation into single oocytes as γ emission. Measurement of zinc efflux was based on a method described previously (13Peter G.J. Davies A. Watt P.W. Birrell J. Taylor P.M. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 169-176Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Fifty nanoliters of 65ZnCl2 at a specific activity of 6.4 μCi/ml were injected into the cytoplasm of individual oocytes. After a 30-min recovery period, each oocyte was transferred into a separate vial containing 0.5 ml of modified Barth’s medium (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The efflux of radioactive 65Zn was allowed to continue for 20 min, after which time the buffer was transferred to a counting vial for measurement of γ emission, and 0.5 ml of fresh buffer were added. This process was repeated for 100 min. The amount of radioactivity that remained in each oocyte was also determined. Tracer efflux was assessed from plots of -ln(Ct/C0) against time, where C0 and Ct are the levels of activity (dpm) in the cell at the start and end, respectively, of each experimental period (obtained by summation of residual oocyte radioactivity and sequential radioactive losses to vials by tracer efflux). Localization of ZnT5B in X. laevis Oocyte—Oocytes injected with RNA transcribed in vitro from plasmid pCDNA3.1-ZnT5B-myc were fixed at 4 °C for 1 h in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, prepared in PBS. After washing in PBS, oocytes were incubated at 4 °C in a 30% sucrose solution overnight. Oocytes were frozen rapidly in OCT medium (VWR International), and sections were cut to a thickness of ∼15 μm using a Shandon Cryotome. Sections were mounted on slides and incubated for 20 min in 200 μl of blocking solution (PBS containing 10% fetal calf serum). The blocking solution was removed, and the slides were incubated in the dark for 1 h with 100 μl of PBS, 10% fetal calf serum containing FITC-conjugated anti-myc antibody (Invitrogen; 1:500 dilution of antibody). After incubation, slides were washed twice in PBS. Sections were then mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Ltd.), and the pattern of fluorescence was visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Leica DMBRE). Transfection of Caco-2 Cells and Measurement of Reporter Gene Activity—Human intestinal Caco-2 cells were cultured routinely as described previously (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). For transfection, Caco-2 cells were seeded into 12-well plates at 3.5 × 105 cells/well. Cells were transfected 24 h after seeding using Genejammer reagent (Stratagene) following the manufacturer’s instructions and using a ratio of DNA:transfection reagent of 2 μg:4.5 μl. After 24 h, transfected cells were incubated in serum-free medium, with or without the addition of 100 μm ZnCl2 or 100 μm CuSO4 plus 1 mm ascorbate, for a further 24 h. β-Galactosidase activity was measured in cell lysates using the substrate chlorophenol red-β-D galactopyranoside (Sigma), as described previously (12Helston R.M. Phillips S.R. McKay J.A. Jackson K.A. Mathers J.C. Ford D. Placenta, in press. 2006; Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad Laboratories) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma), as the standard. Visualization of Intracellular Zinc Concentration Using Rhodzin-3—Caco-2 cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 105 cm2 onto glass coverslips. Twenty-four hours after seeding, cells were transfected with pEGFP-ZnT5B or vector only (pEGFPN; Clontech). After a further 24 h, cells were loaded with the zinc fluorophore Rhodzin-3 AM (5 μm; Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with PBS and left at 37 °C for 1 h to allow de-esterification. Cells were treated with 100 μm ZnCl2 in serum-free medium for a further 24 h prior to fixing for 1 h in 4% (v/v) paraformaldehyde, prepared in PBS. Cells were mounted in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories Ltd.), and the pattern of fluorescence was visualized by confocal laser scanning microscopy (Leica TCS NT). Data Analysis—Data are presented as mean ± S.E. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Microsoft SPSS package. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. We assayed directly the functional activity of ZnT5B by measuring the flux of the radiotracer 65Zn2+ across the plasma membrane of X. laevis oocytes injected with ZnT5B RNA. The uptake of 65Zn2+, supplied at 12 μm, into oocytes injected with ZnT5B cRNA was significantly greater (∼4-fold) than into uninjected controls (Fig. 1A). For measurement of zinc efflux, oocytes were injected with 50 nl (5 μCi/μl) of 65ZnCl2. The efflux of 65Zn2+ was increased in oocytes injected with ZnT5B RNA when compared with water-injected controls (Fig. 1B). The rate constant for zinc efflux in this experiment was calculated as the slope of progressive tracer loss (ln (Ct/co)) with time and was 2.45 ± 0.4 (× 10 -3)/min for ZnT5-injected oocytes and 1.15 ± 0.2 (× 10-3)/min for controls (n = 8 cells each, p < 0.0001 by one way analysis of variance followed by Dunnett’s multiple comparisons test). Increasing the extracellular Zn2+ concentration to 1 mm had no effect on 65Zn2+ efflux (Fig. 1B), indicating that ZnT5B can mediate zinc efflux against a concentration gradient. To establish the location of the heterologously expressed ZnT5B in X. laevis oocytes, cells were injected with a C-terminal myc-tagged ZnT5B construct, and the protein was detected in sections of paraformaldehyde-fixed oocytes using a FITC-labeled anti-myc antibody. Immunofluorescence at the plasma membrane in oocytes injected with ZnT5B-myc cRNA was observed and was clearly not visible in water-injected controls (Fig. 1C), demonstrating localization at the plasma membrane. To determine the effect of increased ZnT5 expression on intracellular zinc concentration in a physiologically relevant cell type, we measured the effect of heterologous overexpression of ZnT5B, in the vector pCDNA3.1, on the activity of a zinc-activated reporter gene, comprising the E. coli β-galactosidase coding sequence downstream of the zinc-activated human MT2a promoter. Co-expression of ZnT5 (from plasmid pCDNA3.1-ZnT5B) with the reporter construct (plasmid pBlue-MT2a) increased significantly β-galactosidase activity (∼4-fold) in serum-free medium with and without the addition of 100 μm extracellular zinc when compared with cells co-transfected with pBlue-MT2a plus vector pCDNA3.1 only (no ZnT5 insert), indicating increased transcription from the zinc-responsive MT2a promoter and so increased intracellular zinc concentration (Fig. 2A). To exclude the possibility that the effect of ZnT5B overexpression on MT2A promoter activity was the result of any change in intracellular Cu2+ concentration or distribution, we demonstrated that the reporter gene activity was unaffected by changes in Cu2+ availability in this experimental system (Fig. 2B). We determined the effects of ZnT5B overexpression, as an N-terminal fusion to GFP to allow visualization, on intracellular zinc concentration and distribution in Caco-2 cells using the zinc-activated fluorophore Rhodzin-3 (Invitrogen). Cells expressing ZnT5B as an N-terminal fusion to GFP (from plasmid pEGFP-ZnT5B) showed localization of ZnT5B to the plasma membrane along with clear cytoplasmic red/orange fluorescence, which was not visualized in cells transfected with vector pEGFPN only (Fig. 3), indicating dramatically elevated total intracellular zinc concentration in cells expressing ZnT5B at the plasma membrane. It is becoming widely accepted that members of the SLC30 family of mammalian zinc transporters function to reduce cytosolic zinc concentration by promoting zinc efflux from the cell or intracellular zinc sequestration. The results of the current study and evidence from previous work (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) indicate clearly that this dogma should be challenged. Specifically, ZnT5B can mediate zinc uptake across the plasma membrane. Expression of ZnT5B at the plasma membrane in X. laevis oocytes resulted in increased transmembrane fluxes of 65Zn2+, consistent with the view that ZnT5B mediates zinc transport across the plasma membrane. Previously, we demonstrated that ZnT5B mediates Zn2+ uptake in the X. laevis oocyte (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). We now provide further confirmation of these observations using a modified uptake buffer in which ZnT5B-mediated zinc uptake at an extracellular concentration of 12 μm was greater when compared with control (4-fold higher) than was measured previously (∼2-fold higher). We also now demonstrate that ZnT5B is expressed at the plasma membrane in X. laevis oocytes. In addition, we demonstrate the efflux of Zn2+ in the same expression system. Based on these observations, we suggest that ZnT5B is capable of bidirectional Zn2+ transport. A possible explanation for increased Zn2+ flux in a specific direction (uptake or efflux) in oocytes expressing ZnT5B is that it is a compensatory response to ZnT5B-mediated zinc transport in the opposite direction. Such a mechanism was suggested to explain the increase in zinc uptake as well as efflux into baby hamster kidney cells expressing ZnT1 (5Palmiter R.D. Findley S.D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 639-649Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar). We demonstrated previously that the possibility that zinc uptake into oocytes expressing ZnT5B is compensatory for zinc efflux can be excluded by virtue of a differential effect of extracellular pH on the ZnT5B-mediated and endogenous oocyte zinc uptake mechanisms (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar). The possibility that efflux was a compensatory response to zinc uptake can be excluded on the grounds that ZnT5B-stimulated efflux occurred in the absence of extracellular zinc. A major exchange mode of ZnT5B function can be excluded because 65Zn2+ effluxes were not trans-stimulated in the presence of extracellular zinc. Bidirectional transporter-mediated transport of zinc is not without precedent and was reported in Saccharomyces cerevisiae for the transporter Yke4p, a member of the SLC39 family (14Kumanovics A. Poruk K.E. Osborn K.A. Ward D.M. Kaplan J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 22566-22574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). To measure ZnT5B function in a physiologically relevant cell type, the effect of increased ZnT5B expression on the intracellular zinc status of the human intestinal cell line Caco-2 was determined by measuring the activity of a zinc-stimulated reporter gene. Increased activity of the zinc-responsive MT2a promoter when ZnT5B was co-expressed in Caco-2 cells indicated increased total intracellular zinc content, altered intracellular zinc partitioning or altered status, or intracellular distribution with respect to other metals capable of activating MT expression. It is known that copper can activate metallothionein gene expression (15Jahroudi N. Foster R. Price-Haughey J. Beitel G. Gedamu L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 6506-6511Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but an effect on copper status and/or distribution as being responsible for the observed activation of the MT2a promoter can be excluded because extracellular Cu2+ did not induce an MT2a promoter response in this system. An increase in total intracellular zinc mediated by ZnT5B expression at the plasma membrane, in the absence of effects on intracellular zinc sequestration, was confirmed by a greatly increased signal from the zinc fluorophore Rhodzin-3 throughout the cytoplasm in Caco-2 cells expressing a GFP-tagged ZnT5B transgene. There was no evidence of zinc accumulation in the Golgi apparatus, where localization of ZnT5 splice variant A (8Kambe T. Narita H. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Hirose J. Amano T. Sugiura N. Sasaki R. Mori K.

Chem. 2002; 277: 26389-26395Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (176) Google Scholar) and ZnT7 (17Kirschke C.P. Huang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 4096-4102Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar), has been reported, or in the endoplasmic reticulum. It has been reported that Rhodzin-3 is a marker of mitochondrial zinc content (18Sensi S.L. Ton-That D. Sullivan P.G. Jonas E.A. Gee K.R. Kaczmarek L.K. Weiss J.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 6157-6162Crossref PubMed Scopus (355) Google Scholar), so it is feasible that the pattern of localization we observed included a component due to increased total cytoplasmic zinc concentration resulting in uptake into mitochondria. The evident bidirectional transport capability of ZnT5B raises questions about the physiological role of this transporter. We demonstrated previously apical location of ZnT5B in Caco-2 cells (9Cragg R.A. Christie G.R. Phillips S.R. Russi R.M. Kury S. Mathers J.C. Taylor P.M. Ford D. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22789-22797Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar) and detected ZnT5 at the apical membrane in human small intestine (11Cragg R.A. Phillips S.R. Piper J.M. Varma J.S. Campbell F.C. Mathers J.C. Ford D. Gut. 2005; 54: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). An apically located intestinal zinc transporter operating in an uptake mode would facilitate the absorption of dietary zinc. Our previous observation that expression of ZnT5 was reduced in the small intestinal mucosa of human volunteers given a zinc supplement for 14 days (11Cragg R.A. Phillips S.R. Piper J.M. Varma J.S. Campbell F.C. Mathers J.C. Ford D. Gut. 2005; 54: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) can be rationalized in terms of this being a homeostatic response to reduce the uptake of excess zinc by the transporter operating in uptake mode. An apical intestinal zinc transporter operating in efflux mode may regulate net zinc absorption to maintain homeostasis at high dietary intakes, but our data on the regulatory response of the transporter to increased zinc intake (11Cragg R.A. Phillips S.R. Piper J.M. Varma J.S. Campbell F.C. Mathers J.C. Ford D. Gut. 2005; 54: 469-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar) appear inconsistent with such a role for ZnT5B in the intestine. In summary, the data presented demonstrate that ZnT5 can operate in an efflux mode, in agreement with the accepted functional characteristics of zinc transporters belonging to the SLC30 family, but also has the capability to increase intracellular zinc content in the absence of any effect on zinc sequestration into specific intracellular compartments. The findings, therefore, necessitate re-evaluation of the current paradigm that SLC30 family zinc transporters operate exclusively to decrease cytosolic zinc concentration."

Although all determinants required for this tight binding are contained within the small growth factor-like domain of uPA (GFD residues 1–48) (9Ploug M. Østergaard S. Hansen L.B. Holm A. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 3612-3622Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), it critically depends on maintenance of a three-domain, modular structure of uPAR (10Ploug M. Ellis V. Danø K. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8991-8997Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Accordingly, site-directed mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling studies have shown that elements located in distinct domains of uPAR are involved in the interactions with both uPA (8Gårdsvoll H.

The assembly of the three homologous domains in uPAR creates a large and deep central ligand-binding cavity, where aliphatic side chains, provided by uPAR domain I, establish a hydrophobic binding site on one side of the cavity. The high affinity for both uPA and the linear peptide antagonists is achieved by an intimate interaction with this cavity (8Gårdsvoll H. Gilquin B. Le Du M.H. Ménez A. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. J.

Des. 2004; 10: 2359-2376Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). As opposed to this, the binding sites mediating the interactions between uPAR and its auxiliary binding partners, e.g. vitronectin (21Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol.

As these interactions are dependent on or modulated by receptor occupancy with uPA (22Wei Y. Waltz D.A. Rao N. Drummond R.J. Rosenberg S. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32380-32388Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 25Sidenius N. Andolfo A. Fesce R. Blasi F. J. Biol.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), uPAR may orchestrate the assembly of these ternary complexes on the cell surface and thus assist in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration. In accordance with this proposition, it has been reported that cell lines with low endogenous uPAR expression adhere poorly to vitronectin, but this adhesion is markedly promoted by receptor saturation with exogenously added uPA (21Waltz D.A. Chapman H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14746-14750Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27Sidenius N. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Increased uPAR expression in vitro by transfection or cytokine treatment may, however, uncouple this ligand dependence enabling adhesion to vitronectin by a local high density of unoccupied uPAR (27Sidenius N. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Partitioning into lipid rafts may generate such a local high density of uPAR and could thus play a regulatory role for uPAR-mediated vitronectin adhesion (28Cunningham O. Andolfo A. Santovito M.L. Iuzzolino L. Blasi F. Sidenius N. EMBO J. 2003; 22: 5994-6003Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). In contrast to the well characterized uPAR-ATF interaction, the structural elements in the uPAR·uPA complex that are responsible for the interaction with matrix-deposited vitronectin are largely undefined. Two important functional relationships have nonetheless been established for this interaction. First, the binding sites for uPA and vitronectin on uPAR must be completely nonoverlapping because of the ability to form tri-molecular complexes. Second, the integrity of the intact three-domain structure of uPAR is mandatory for this complex formation (27Sidenius N. Blasi F. FEBS Lett. 2000; 470: 40-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 29Høyer-Hansen G. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Danø K. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). So far, only one study (12Li Y. Lawrence D.A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29925-29932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) has sought to define the functional epitope on uPAR for this interaction. Using homologue-scanning mutagenesis, by which segments of the individual domains of uPAR were swapped with the corresponding sequences in the single domain homologue CD59, Li et al. (12Li Y. Lawrence D.A. Zhang L. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 29925-29932Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) reported that two segments in uPAR domain II (Asn172–Lys175 and Glu183–Asn186) 3The numbering of amino acid residues in PAI-1, uPA, uPAR, and vitronectin refers to the cDNA-derived sequences omitting the signal sequences. Nomenclature for the secondary structure elements in uPAR follows the conventions established for snake venom α-neurotoxins and are more explicitly clarified for the modular domains in uPAR (17Llinas P. Le Du M.H. Gårdsvoll H. Danø K. Ploug M. Gilquin B. Stura E.A. Ménez A.

EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1655-1663Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). were important for vitronectin binding but not for uPA binding. To gain further insight into the molecular details of this interaction, we have therefore probed the interaction between purified pro-uPA·uPAR complexes and vitronectin by using an almost complete alanine-scanning library of single-site uPAR mutants. We find that the functional epitope for this interaction encompasses a small region located outside the central uPA-binding cavity and involves residues in two loops connecting the central four-stranded β-sheet in uPAR domain I as well as residues in the linker peptide connecting uPAR domains I and II. Intriguingly, this functional epitope on uPAR for vitronectin binding resembles the corresponding binding site on PAI-1 for the somatomedin B-like (SMB) domain of vitronectin as both interactions employ arginine as the critical hot spot residue. Chemicals and Reagents—All reagents for time-resolved fluorescence measurements (DELFIA®) as well as the stable Eu3+-chelate used for specific protein conjugation (i.e. N1-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)diethylenetriamine-N1,N2,N3,N3-tetraacetic acid) were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Protein Preparations—Monomeric human vitronectin purified from plasma was obtained from Molecular Innovations (Southfield, MI). Recombinant active PAI-1 produced in Escherichia coli was a kind gift from Dr. M. D. Andersen (NOVO-Nordisk, Denmark). The monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody R2 (30Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ellis V. Ploug M. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. FEBS Lett. 1991; 288: 233-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar), which also recognizes uPAR-vitronectin complexes (29Høyer-Hansen G. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Danø K. Preissner K.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 420: 79-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), was produced in-house and was labeled with Eu3+ using the stable Eu3+-chelate of N1-(p-isothiocyanatobenzyl)diethylenetriamine-N1,N2,N3,N3-tetraacetic acid at pH 9.3 and a molar ratio of 20:1. This procedure yielded a labeling density of 2–4 molecules of Eu3+ per R2. The monoclonal anti-uPA clone 5 as well as a mixture of four monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies (clones 2, 3, 5, and 7) also prepared in-house were labeled with Eu3+ following the same procedure. Expression and Purification of Soluble Recombinant Human uPAR—Soluble forms of human uPAR were expressed and secreted by Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) or Drosophila melanogaster Schneider 2 (S2) cells, which were stably transfected with either suPAR (residues 1–277) (33Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Nielsen H.J. Wöllisch E. Weidle U. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) or pMTC/uPAR (residues 1–283) (31Gårdsvoll H. Werner F. Søndergaard L. Danø K. Ploug M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). These proteins are secreted to the conditioned medium because of a deletion of the carboxyl-terminal signal sequence that is required for glycolipid anchoring (1Ploug M. Rønne E. Behrendt N. Jensen A.L. Blasi F. Danø K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 1926-1933Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 2Ploug M. Curr. Pharm. Des. 2003; 9: 1499-1528Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). Single-site alanine replacements were introduced into pMTC/uPAR by site-directed mutagenesis using a previously designed three-gene cassette approach (31Gårdsvoll H. Werner F. Søndergaard L. Danø K. Ploug M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and the corresponding soluble uPAR mutants (244 in all) were expressed by S2 cells and immunoaffinity-purified as described (8Gårdsvoll H. Gilquin B. Le Du M.H. Ménez A. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19260-19272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Two additional uPAR variants with multiple mutations were generated in which the sequences 172NTTK175 and 183ELEN186 were swapped with the corresponding sequences found in the glycolipid-anchored, single domain homologue CD59, i.e. 65KKDL68 and 79GTSL82. In addition, selected positions were mutated to residues other than alanine. The following mutants were produced: R30E, R30D, R30K, W32F, W32Y, E37K, R58K, R58E, R58D, I63L, I63V, R91D, R91E, R91K, Y92F, and Y92W. All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing using an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), and the identities of the individually purified uPAR mutants were also verified at the protein level by peptide-mass mapping using in-gel digestion of the reduced and alkylated protein followed by mass assignment and MS/MS-sequencing using an Autoflex™ TOF-TOF II (8Gårdsvoll H. Gilquin B. Le Du M.H. Ménez A. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19260-19272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). As judged from SDS-PAGE of ∼5 μg of reduced and alkylated sample, the purity of these uPAR mutant preparations was >95%. Concentrations of purified uPARWT were accurately quantified by amino acid composition analyses (32Barkholt V. Jensen A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Protein concentrations of the purified uPAR mutants were determined using an extinction coefficient E280nm1% of 9.2 (33Rønne E. Behrendt N. Ploug M. Nielsen H.J. Wöllisch E. Weidle U. Danø K. Høyer-Hansen G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 167: 91-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) except for those mutants involving Trp32 or Trp129 for which an estimated E280nm1% of 6.8 was used. Expression and Purification of Recombinant Human Pro-uPAS356A and Human Vitronectin Fragments—Human pro-uPA was produced by Drosophila S2 cells stably transfected with a pMTB/uPA (residues 1–411) vector. Expression of pro-uPAWT or the active site-mutated pro-uPAS356A was induced by 0.5 mm Cu2SO4 as described previously (31Gårdsvoll H. Werner F. Søndergaard L. Danø K. Ploug M. Protein Expression Purif. 2004; 34: 284-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), but in this particular case the S2 media also contained 10 μg/ml aprotinin to prevent activation of pro-uPA. The pro-uPA was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography using an immobilized anti-uPA monoclonal antibody (clone 6). The purity of this pro-uPA was >95%, and the preparation showed no evidence of conversion as judged by SDS-PAGE. The identity of the purified pro-uPA was verified by MS as described (8Gårdsvoll H. Gilquin B. Le Du M.H. Ménez A. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19260-19272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Protein concentration of a stock solution of pro-uPAS356A was accurately determined by amino acid composition analysis (32Barkholt V. Jensen A.L. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 177: 318-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Vitronectin fragment 1–121 was expressed in S2 cells using the expression vector pMTC/Vn-(1–121)/uPAR-DIII (34Gårdsvoll H. Hansen L.V. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This construction covers vitronectin residues 1–121 followed by an enterokinase cleavage sequence (DDDDK) and finally a carboxyl-terminal tag comprising uPAR domain III (uPAR-DIII residues 182–283) to assist subsequent immunoaffinity purification (34Gårdsvoll H. Hansen L.V. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. Protein Expression Purif. 2007; 52: 384-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The following single-site alanine replacements (F13A, V15A, D22A, E23A, L24A, S26A, Y27A, Y28A, and Q29A) as well as the double substitutions (T50A/T57A and T50E/T57E) were introduced into pMTC/Vn-(1–121)/uPAR-DIII as described previously (35Picard V. Ersdal-Badju E. Lu A. Bock S.C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2587-2591Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. These fusion proteins were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography using an immobilized anti-uPAR antibody (R2), as outlined previously for the purification of uPAR, and used as uncleaved fusion proteins. Human GFD-(1–48) and SMB-(1–47) domains fused to a carboxyl-terminal His6 tag were expressed by stably transfected Pichia pastoris strain X-33 using the yeast expression vector pPICZα. The secreted domains were purified by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography followed by reversed-phase chromatography as described previously (8Gårdsvoll H. Gilquin B. Le Du M.H. Ménez A. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19260-19272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Assessing uPAR Binding to Immobilized Vitronectin by Dissociation-enhanced Time-resolved Fluorescence—White Maxisorb fluoroplates (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) were coated overnight at 4 °C with 1 μg/μl human vitronectin in 0.5 m carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Excess binding sites were blocked by a brief incubation with SuperBlock™ (Pierce) diluted to 50% (v/v) in 0.04 m NaH2PO4 and 0.3 m NaCl, pH 7.4. Complexes between 10 nm pro-uPAS356A and 100 nm uPAR were preformed by incubation for 30 min at room temperature, and the interaction with immobilized vitronectin was subsequently allowed to proceed for 60 min at room temperature on an orbital shaker. All incubations and dilutions were performed in DELFIA® assay buffer (50 mm Tris-buffered saline, pH 7.8, containing 0.5% (w/v) BSA, bovine immunoglobulin, 0.04% (v/v) Tween 40, and 20 μm diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid). After washing the fluoroplates six times, they were incubated for 60 min with 0.6 μg/ml of the Eu3+-labeled R2 monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody in DELFIA® assay buffer followed by six additional washes. Finally, the Eu3+ attached to the receptor-bound R2 was dissociated from its chelator by incubation in DELFIA® enhancement solution for 5 min. The fluorescence of the free Eu3+ was measured by time-resolved fluorescence using a Fluostar Galaxy fluorometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) with excitation set at 340 nm and reading emission at 615 nm with a 400-μs delay and a 400-μs acquisition window. In a modified version of this binding assay, fusion proteins containing derivatives of vitronectin linked to uPAR domain III (Vn-(1–121)/uPAR-DIII) were immobilized on white Maxisorb fluoroplates using a 2-fold dilution series in coating buffer covering 0.12 to 1 μg/ml. After blocking excess binding sites as described above, the coated wells were either incubated with preformed pro-uPA·uPAR complexes (100 nm uPAR preincubated with 10 nm pro-uPAS356A as described above), 10 nm active PAI-1, or with buffer alone. In these experiments the DELFIA® assay buffer included an additional 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 and 0.25 m NaCl. The level of immobilized fusion protein was assessed by adding 0.6 μg/ml of the Eu3+-labeled monoclonal anti-uPAR antibody R2 to wells incubated with buffer only. Quantification of the pro-uPA-uPAR interaction with the immobilized vitronectin fusion proteins was accomplished by incubating the relevant wells with the Eu3+-labeled monoclonal anti-uPA antibody clone 5 and measuring the released Eu3+ as described above. PAI-1 binding was measured by a similar approach after incubation with a Eu3+-labeled mixture of four monoclonal anti-PAI-1 antibodies. Surface Plasmon Resonance Studies—All real time interaction studies were carried out on a Biacore 3000™ instrument (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden) using 10 mm HEPES, 150 mm NaCl, 3 mm EDTA, and 0.005% (v/v) surfactant P-20 at pH 7.4 as running buffer. Human recombinant pro-uPAS356A (0.25 to 1 μg/ml) was immobilized covalently on a carboxymethylated dextran matrix (CM5 sensor chip) using N-hydroxysuccinimide/N-ethyl-N′-[3-(diethylamino)propyl]carbodiimide as described previously (11Gårdsvoll H. Danø K. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37995-38003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). To obtain comparative evaluations of the kinetics for the uPA-uPAR interaction, 2-fold serial dilutions of the various uPAR mutants (2–200 nm in running buffer) were analyzed in parallel for uPA binding at a flow rate of 50 μl/min at 20 °C. Compared with previous studies (8Gårdsvoll H. Gilquin B. Le Du M.H. Ménez A. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19260-19272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar, 11Gårdsvoll H. Danø K. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37995-38003Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), in this study we have used a very high flow rate to minimize effects from mass transport limitations on the assessment of the kinetic rate constants. After each run the sensor chip was regenerated by two consecutive injections of 0.1 m acetic acid in 0.5 m NaCl. The kinetic rate constants, kon and koff, were derived from these real time interaction analyses by fitting the association and dissociation phases to a bimolecular interaction model using the BIAevaluation 4.1 software (Biacore, Uppsala, Sweden), as described in detail previously (8Gårdsvoll H. Gilquin B. Le Du M.H. Ménez A. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19260-19272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). For direct affinity measurements of the SMB-uPAR interaction, purified human uPARWT, uPARW32A, and uPARR91A (2.5 μg/ml) were immobilized by conventional amine chemistry in separate flow cells on a single CM5 sensor chip with coupling yields ranging from 1,500 to 2,000 RU. 2-Fold serial dilutions of either GFD-(1–48)-His6 (0.5–125 nm) or SMB-(1–47)-His6 (0.02–80 μm) were analyzed in parallel for uPAR binding at a flow rate of 50 μl/min at 4 °C. Kinetic rate constants for GFD binding were derived by fitting the data to a single binding site model using BIAevaluation 4.1 software (8Gårdsvoll H. Gilquin B. Le Du M.H. Ménez A. Jørgensen T.J. Ploug M. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 19260-19272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). KD and Rmax values for the SMB-uPAR interaction were calculated from the equilibrium binding isotherm by nonlinear curve fitting assuming a model with saturation of a single binding site as shown in Equation 1, Req=Rmax[SMB]KD+[SMB]Eq.1 The equilibrium binding (Req) and binding capacity (Rmax) of the sensor chip are determined in resonance units (RU), but these can be transformed into binding densities using the approximation that 1000 RU equals 1 ng/mm2. For affinity measurements of the interaction between SMB and preformed pro-uPA·uPAR complexes, the immobilized uPAR mutants were initially saturated by 200-μl injections of 200 nm solutions of pro-uPAS356A, ATF-(1–143), or GFD-(1–48) before 67 μl of 2-fold serial dilution series of SMB were injected (up to 10 μm). Quantification of the Interaction between Immobilized Vitronectin and Pro-uPA·uPAR Complexes Using Time-resolved Fluorescence—Cellular attachment and adhesion studies to vitronectin are often conducted with immobilized protein in microtiter plates because the adsorbed vitronectin in such studies is considered a suitable in vitro surrogate for the natural, matrix-embedded protein.

https://openalex.org/W1988275985,"Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a malignant hematopoietic disorder whose proliferative component is a result of RAS pathway deregulation caused by somatic mutation in the RAS or PTPN11 oncogenes or in patients with underlying neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF-1), by loss of NF1 gene function. To search for potential collaborating genetic abnormalities, we used oligonucleotide arrays to analyse over 116 000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across the genome in 16 JMML samples with normal karyotype. Evaluation of the SNP genotypes identified large regions of homozygosity on chromosome 17q, including the NF1 locus, in four of the five samples from patients with JMML and NF-1. The homozygous region was at least 55 million base pairs in each case. The genomic copy number was normal within the homozygous region, indicating uniparental disomy (UPD). In contrast, the array data provided no evidence for 17q UPD in any of the 11 JMML cases without NF-1. We used array-based comparative genomic hybridization to confirm 17q disomy, and microsatellite analysis was performed to verify homozygosity. Mutational analysis demonstrated that the inactivating NF1 lesion was present on both alleles in each case. In summary, our data indicate that a mitotic recombination event in a JMML-initiating cell led to 17q UPD with homozygous loss of normal NF1, provide confirmatory evidence that the NF1 gene is crucial for the increased incidence of JMML in NF-1 patients, and corroborate the concept that RAS pathway deregulation is central to JMML pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W2056187099,"Pituitary tumor transforming gene (PTTG1) was isolated from rat pituitary tumor cells, and subsequently identified as a securin protein as well as a transcription factor. We show here a global transcriptional effect of PTTG1 in human choriocarcinoma JEG-3 cells by simultaneously assessing 20 000 gene promoters using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-on-Chip experiments. Seven hundred and forty-six gene promoters (P<0.001) were found enriched, with functions relating to cell cycle, metabolic control and signal transduction. Significant interaction between PTTG1 and Sp1 (P<0.000001) was found by transcriptional pattern analysis of ChIP data and further confirmed by immunoprecipitation and pull-down assays. PTTG1 acts coordinately with Sp1 to induce cyclin D3 expression ∼threefold, and promotes G1/S-phase transition independently of p21. PTTG1 deletion was also protective for anchorage-independent cell colony formation. The results show that PTTG1 exhibits properties of a global transcription factor, and specifically modulates the G1/S-phase transition by interacting with Sp1. This novel signaling pathway may be required for PTTG1 transforming activity."

The construct was verified by DNA sequencing. E. coli transformed with the EmLEM vector was grown on either Luria Bertini or minimal medium (with 15NH4Cl and 13C6-glucose as the nitrogen and carbon sources, respectively), induced with 1 mm isopropyl d-thiogalactopyranoside at A600 ∼ 0.8, and harvested by centrifugation 3 h following induction. After harvesting, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 ml (per liter of culture) of 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mm dine-Sepharose column (1 ml; Amersham Biosciences), followed by the addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The cleaved His6-thioredoxin was removed by loading the digested proteins over a HisTrap HP column. EmLEM was further purified by a Sephadex-75 gel filtration column (Amersham Biosciences) equilibrated with 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, and 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide. This buffer was used for NMR studies on free EmLEM. Human BAF was expressed and purified as described (4Cai M. Huang Y. Zheng R. Wei S.Q. Ghirlando R. Lee M.S. Craigie R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

The following isotopically labeled samples were prepared: U-15N/13C-labeled, 10% 13C-labeled and unlabeled (natural isotopic abundance) EmLEM;U-15N/13C-labeled, U-15N/13C/2H/[methyl-1H]Val/Leu/Ile-labeled, 10% 13C-labeled and unlabeled BAF2 dimer. NMR samples of the BAF2-EMLEM complex were prepared in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 95% H2O, 5% D2O. Light Scattering—Static light scattering data were obtained using an analytical Superdex-75 column (1.0 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) with in-line multiangle light scattering (DAWN EOS, Wyatt Technology, Inc., Santa Barbara, CA) and refractive index detectors (OPTILAB DSP, Wyatt Technology Inc.). 145 μg of BAF2 dimer mixed with or without EmLEM in 125 μl of 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl was applied to the pre-equilibrated Superdex-75 column (1 × 30 cm; GE Healthcare) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min at room temperature and eluted in the same buffer. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—Protein stocks purified in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 6.5, 200 mm NaCl, and 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol were used to prepare the samples for sedimentation equilibrium experiments. Samples of the purified complex (eluted in a single peak by gel filtration chromatography) were studied at a loading concentration of 12 μm. Different stoichiometric BAF2 dimer to EmLEM mixtures were prepared at 3:1, 2:1, 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3 ratios and nominal BAF2 concentrations of 20 μm. The 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2 mixtures were also studied at nominal BAF2 concentrations of 13 μm. All samples were kept at 4 °C and loaded into pre-chilled cells. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were conducted at 4 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples of the complex and various BAF2/EmLEM mixtures were studied at rotor speeds of 16,000, 20,000, 24,000, and 28,000 rpm. Data were acquired using 6-hole cells as an average of 4 absorbance measurements at 280 nm and a radial spacing of 0.001 cm. Sedimentation equilibrium was achieved within 48 h. Data collected at different speeds and different loading concentrations were analyzed globally in terms of various species analysis models using SEDPHAT 4.1b (13Lebowitz J. Lewis M.S. Schuck P.S. Protein Sci. 2002; 11: 2067-2079Crossref PubMed Scopus (624) Google Scholar) to obtain the buoyant molecular mass M(1 - vρ). A solution density ρ of 1.01310 cm3/g was measured at 20 °C on a Mettler-Toledo DE51 density meter and corrected to a value of 1.0149 cm3/g at 4 °C, which is the value used experimentally. Partial specific volumes (v) for BAF and EmLEM (at 4 °C) were calculated based on the amino acid composition using SEDNTERP: the values are 0.7287 and 0.7184 cm3/g, respectively. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—ITC was performed using a high-precision VP-ITC calorimetry system (Microcal Inc.). BAF2 dimer and EmLEM were dialyzed against degassed 25 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 6.5, and 0.2 m NaCl prior to the experiment. BAF2 dimer (31 μm) in the calorimetric cell at 30 °C was titrated with EmLEM (at a concentration of 854 μm in the injection syringe). Analysis of the data were performed using the Origin software provided with the instrument. NMR Spectroscopy—Spectra were recorded at 30 °C on Bruker DMX500, DRX600, DRX750, and DRX800 spectrometers.

The structure of EmLEM is very similar to our previously published structure of the BAF binding LEM domain of LAP2 (9Cai M. Huang Y. Ghirlando R. Wilson K.L. Craigie R. Clore G.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 4399-4407Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar) with a Cα atomic r.m.s. difference of 1.3 Aå for 44 atoms (residues 2-46 of EmLEM and 111-154 of LAP2; percentage sequence identity of 36%). The Cα atomic r.m.s. difference between the current EmLEM structure and the NMR structure previously published by Wolff et al. (8Wolff N. Gilquin B. Courchay K. Callebaut I. Worman H.J. Zinn-Justin S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) is 2.4 Aå for residues 2-46 and 1.5 Aå for residues 3-44. Although the fold and topology of the two EmLEM structures are obviously the same, there are clearly differences in detail, which are significant when one wants to use the coordinates of the free EmLEM domain to solve the structure of the BAF2-EMLem complex using conjoined rigid body/torsion angle dynamics. In this regard, we note that the agreement of the EmLEM coordinates of Wolff et al. (8Wolff N. Gilquin B. Courchay K. Callebaut I. Worman H.J. Zinn-Justin S. FEBS Lett. 2001; 501: 171-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with the 1DNH RDCs measured for EmLEM both free and bound to the BAF2 dimer is rather poor with RDC R-factors (46Clore G.M. Garrett D.S. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999; 121: 9008-9012Crossref Scopus (232) Google Scholar) of 49 and 61%, respectively, determined by singular value decomposition. In contrast, the present structure of the EmLEM domains agrees extremely well with the 1DNH RDCs measured on the BAF2-EmLEM complex with an RDC R-factor of 14.8%. The latter value is comparable with the value one would expect for a 1.5-2-Aå resolution crystal structure (23Bax A. Kontaxis G. Tjandra N.

Open table in a new tab Stoichiometry of the BAF2-EMLEM Complex by NMR—The BAF2-EmLEM complex is in slow exchange on the chemical shift scale and portions of the 1H-15N HSQC spectra recorded as a function of various ratios of EmLEM to BAF2 dimer are shown in Fig. 2A. The binding of EmLEM to the BAF2 dimer disrupts the symmetry of the dimer such that the chemical shifts of many equivalent residues of the two subunits (about 55% of the 1H-15N cross-peaks for BAF) are no longer identical in the complex. Under the conditions of the NMR experiment (concentration of BAF2 dimer of ∼130 μm), binding of EmLEM is stoichiometric with one molecule of EmLEM bound per BAF2 dimer (Fig. 2B). Increasing the ratio of EmLEM to BAF2 dimer above 1:1 results in no change in the intensity of the bound BAF2 cross-peaks (Fig. 2, A and B). Because a single molecule of EmLEM binds to the BAF2 dimer, the chemical environments of the two subunits of BAF2 are necessarily no longer identical. The backbone of the two subunits of BAF2, however, remains identical within coordinate errors as judged from RDC measurements (i.e. the values of the 1DNH RDCs for the two subunits of BAF2 are identical in the complex). It should also be noted that if two molecules of EmLEM bound the BAF2 dimer symmetrically, the chemical environment and hence the chemical shifts of the two subunits of BAF2 would be identical in the complex. Stoichiometry of the BAF2-EMLEM Complex by Light Scattering—The calculated molecular mass of the BAF2 dimer and the EMLEM domains are 20,116 and 5,572 Da, respectively. The BAF2 dimer elutes as a single peak with a molecular mass of 21.3 ± 0.2 kDa determined from light scattering and the refractive index data (Fig. 3A). A 1:1 mixture of BAF2 dimer and EmLEM results in a shift of the BAF2 peak to a lower retention volume with a molecular mass of 25.9 ± 0.2 kDa (Fig. 3B). Increasing the ratio of EmLEM to BAF2 does not change the position of the latter peak and the molec"

We investigated how embryonic stem cells (ESCs) convert leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) concentration into an all-or-nothing cell-fate decision (self-renewal). Using a combined experimental/computational approach we demonstrate unexpected switch-like (on/off) signaling in response to LIF. This behavior emerges over time due to a positive feedback loop controlling transcriptional expression of LIF signaling pathway components. The autoregulatory loop maintains robust pathway responsiveness (""on"") at sufficient concentrations of exogenous LIF, while autocrine signaling and low concentrations of exogenous LIF cause ESCs to adopt the weakly responsive (""off"") state of differentiated cells. We demonstrate that loss of ligand responsiveness is reversible and precedes loss of the ESC transcription factors Oct4 and Nanog, suggesting an early step in the hierarchical control of differentiation. While endogenously produced ligands were insufficient to sustain the ""on"" state, they buffer it, influencing the timing of differentiation. These results demonstrate a novel switch-like behavior, which establishes the LIF threshold for ESC self-renewal."

These data demonstrate that LMW-PTP is a key negative regulator of insulin action and a potential novel target for the treatment of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. The incidence of diabetes has been steadily increasing and has become a major public health concern. Over 85% of diabetic patients have type 2 diabetes. Obesity, which can result from a sedentary life style and high calorie diet, is a major risk factor for the development of this disorder (1Bazzano L.A. Serdula M. Liu S. J. Am. Coll. Nutr. 2005; 24: 310-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). A hallmark of type 2 diabetes is insulin resistance, characterized by a decreased insulin response in a variety of tissues (2Reaven G.M. Diabetes. 1988; 37: 1595-1607Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), including liver, fat, and muscle. Therefore, increasing insulin sensitivity is a practical strategy for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.

Activated PI3-K stimulates Akt (or protein kinase B) that in turn phosphorylates and inactivates glycogen synthase kinase-3 (11Cross D.A. Alessi D.R. Cohen P. Andjelkovich M. Hemmings B.A. Nature. 1995; 378: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (4397) Google Scholar), resulting in activation of glycogen synthase (12Srivastava A.K. Pandey S.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1998; 182: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar), thereby increasing the utilization of glucose for glycogen synthesis. In fat and muscle, activation of this pathway also causes transfer of GLUT4 from the cytoplasm to the cell membrane, resulting in increased glucose uptake (13Bryant N.J. Govers R. James D.E. Nat.

Therefore, IR-IRS-1/2-PI3-K-Akt signaling cascade is a key pathway in mediating the effects of insulin action on blood glucose levels. A number of studies have established a role for intracellular phosphatases in the negative regulation of insulin signaling (14Butler M. McKay R.A. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Witchell D. Murray S.F.

Insulin sensitivity was enhanced in PTP1B knock-out mice, in which increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR was found in liver and muscle but not in adipose tissue. Insulin sensitivity was also increased in ob/ob and db/db mice treated with antisense inhibitors that reduced PTP1B expression in liver and fat (17Gum R.J. Gaede L.L. Koterski S.L. Heindel M.

Furthermore, in these mice insulin signaling was enhanced in liver but not in fat tissue. Therefore, PTP1B negatively regulates insulin signaling with tissue specificity (15Elchebly M. Payette P.

In addition, PTEN and SHIP2 also negatively regulate insulin signaling in vivo via dephosphorylating phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate, which results in decreased phosphorylation and inactivation of Akt. Enhanced insulin sensitivity was observed in ob/ob and db/db mice after antisense reduction of PTEN expression which was accompanied by increased levels of phosphorylated Akt at serine 473 (AktSer473) in liver (14Butler M. McKay R.A. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Witchell D. Murray S.F. Dean N.M. Bhanot S. Monia B.P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar). Increased phosphorylated AktSer473 levels in both liver and muscle were also found in SHIP2 knock-out mice (19Sleeman M.W. Wortley K.E. Lai K.M. Gowen L.C. Kintner J. Kline W.O. Garcia K. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Glass D.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Moreover, protection from diet-induced insulin resistance was observed in these knock-out mice when fed a high fat diet (19Sleeman M.W. Wortley K.E. Lai K.M. Gowen L.C. Kintner J. Kline W.O.

Therefore, intracellular phosphatases play a key role in insulin signaling activity and in modulating insulin sensitivity. A distinct PTP called low molecular weight PTP (LMW-PTP), also known as acid phosphatase locus 1, is an 18-kDa cytosolic enzyme with two catalytically active isoforms, named A and B, derived from alternate splicing of a single pre-mRNA (20Ramponi G. Stefani M. Int. J. Biochem. Cell Biol. 1997; 29: 279-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 21Bottini N. Bottini E. Gloria-Bottini F. Mustelin T. Arch. Immunol. Ther.

Giannoni E. Raugei G. Cirri P. Paoli P. Modesti A. Camici G. Ramponi G. FEBS Lett. 1998; 437: 263-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Biochemical studies have shown that LMW-PTP can dephosphorylate tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (23Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G. Ramponi G. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Limited in vitro studies have suggested a role for LMW-PTP as a negative regulator of insulin-mediated mitogenic and metabolic signaling (23Chiarugi P. Cirri P. Marra F. Raugei G. Camici G. Manao G.

Res. Commun. 2000; 270: 564-569Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested that LMW-PTP levels are associated with dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in human subjects (26Bottini N. MacMurray J. Peters W. Rostamkhani M. Comings D.E. Mol. Gen. Met. 2002; 77: 226-229Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar, 27Iannaccone U. Bergamaschi A. Magrini A. Marino G. Bottini N. Lucarelli P. Bottini E. Gloria-Bottini F. Metabolism. 2005; 54: 891-894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). However, the precise role of LMW-PTP in regulating insulin action in vivo remains unknown. Here, we have used a specific antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) to suppress the expression of LMW-PTP in cultured hepatocytes and in liver and fat of diet-induced obese and leptin-deficient obese mice to investigate the mechanism of the insulin-sensitizing effect of LMW-PTP. Previous pharmacokinetic studies have found that the specific ASO chemistry employed in this study leads to good distribution (and consequent activity) in a variety of tissues in vivo, including liver and adipose tissue (28Dean N.M.

Reduction in the levels of both LMW-PTP isoforms in vitro and in vivo increased tyrosine phosphorylation of IR and AktSer473 and increased IRS-1- and IRS-2-associated PI3-K activities in both liver and fat. The enhanced insulin signaling activity was accompanied by a reduction in blood glucose and insulin levels and improved insulin and glucose tolerance in obese mice. These results demonstrate for the first time a novel role for LMW-PTP as a key negative regulator of insulin signaling in vivo. Selection of LMW-PTP ASOs—Rapid throughput screens of about 80 ASOs against LMW-PTP were performed in A549 cells, and the reduction of target gene expression was analyzed with real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR after transfection of the cells with different concentrations of the ASOs for 24 h. Based on IC50 values, four potent ASOs were selected, and their in vivo activity was confirmed in lean C57BL/6J-Lepob/+ mice. The final selection of the ASOs was based upon the maximal reduction of hepatic LMW-PTP mRNA levels in lean mice without any evidence of overt toxicity. The selected LMW-PTP ASO (ASO 1), ISIS 288267, was then used for the current study. Another LMW-PTP ASO (ASO 2), ISIS 288291, was also used in some in vitro experiments for comparison. All ASOs have a uniform phosphorothioate backbone with a 20-base chimeric design, with 2′-O-(methoxy)-ethyl modification in the first five and last five bases. The modification enhances their binding affinity to complimentary sequences and their resistance to the action of nucleases. A negative control ASO (ISIS 141923), which has the same chemical composition as ISIS 288267 but no complementarities to any known gene sequence, was also included in the study. Isolation and Transfection of Primary Hepatocytes—Mouse primary hepatocytes were prepared according to a method described earlier (29Yu X.X. Murray S.F. Pandey S.K. Booten S.L. Bao D. Song X.Z. Kelly S. Chen S. McKay R. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). Briefly, the mice were anesthetized by Avertin, and the livers were perfused through portal vein with a buffer containing Ca2+/Mg2+-free Hanks’ balanced salt solution (Invitrogen), 10 mm Hepes, and 0.5 mm EGTA, pH 7.4, for 4 min. Then it was perfused with digestion buffer (William’s E medium, 10 mm Hepes, 2 mm glutamic acid, 0.63 mg/ml collagenase B, and 0.01 mg/ml gentamycin) for 6-8 min. Perfused livers were detached from the animal, and the liver cells were gently dissociated and dispersed in a wash buffer (the digestion buffer without collagenase but with 10% fetal bovine serum). The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 450-500 rpm in a CR412 centrifuge (Jouan, Winchester, VA) to separate parenchymal cells from nonparenchymal cells, and the former were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline. The parenchymal cells were then plated and maintained in William’s E medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1 nm insulin at 37 °C under 95% O2, 5% CO2. After overnight culture the cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and incubated with 1-2 ml of transfection mixture containing 150 nm ASO (control or LMW-PTP ASO), 4.5 μg of Lipofectin (Invitrogen) in William’s E medium for 4-6 h. Then the cells were switched to a complete medium containing William’s E and 10% fetal bovine serum for an addition 16-18 h for mRNA analysis or 48-55 h for protein analysis. For insulin signaling-related protein analysis, the hepatocytes were incubated in William’s E medium containing only 0.1% bovine serum albumin overnight prior to challenge with 10 nm insulin. Mice Care and Treatments—Animal care and other procedures were the same as described previously (29Yu X.X. Murray S.F. Pandey S.K. Booten S.L. Bao D. Song X.Z. Kelly S. Chen S. McKay R. Monia B.P. Bhanot S. Hepatology. 2005; 42: 362-371Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). In brief, male C57BL/6J mice and C57BL/6J-Lepob/ob (ob/ob) mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory at 6-7 weeks of age and maintained with 12-h light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. C57BL/6J mice were fed a diet containing 60 kcal % fat (research diet D12492; Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) for 12 weeks to induce obesity and insulin resistance. The animals were then divided into different groups based on BW, blood glucose, and insulin concentrations and treated (subcutaneous injection) with LMW-PTP ASO or control ASO (dissolved in saline) at a dose of 25 mg/kg BW or with a similar volume of saline, twice a week for 6 weeks. A group of lean C57BL/6J mice fed normal rodent chow and injected with saline served as normal controls. At the end of the study, the mice were sacrificed, blood was collected through cardiac puncture, and different tissues were dissected and quickly frozen in liquid N2 until further analysis. For the ob/ob mice study, after acclimation to the animal care facility for 4-5 days, the mice were grouped based on BW and blood glucose levels and injected with LMW-PTP ASO at 25 mg/kg BW or a similar volume of saline twice a week for 4 weeks. Because the negative control ASO treatment did not exhibit specific metabolic effects as compared with saline treatment in the DIO mice study, it was not included in the ob/ob mice study. For the insulin challenge studies, DIO mice were treated with LMW-PTP ASO or control ASO at a dose of 50 mg/kg BW or with a similar volume of saline, twice a week for 2 weeks, and ob/ob mice were treated with LMW-PTP ASO at 25 mg/kg BW or saline twice a week for 4 weeks. The animals were then fasted overnight and given a bolus intraperitoneal injection of insulin at 2 units/kg of BW or vehicle. Ten minutes later, the animals were sacrificed, and liver and epididymal fat were collected and quickly frozen in liquid N2 for further analysis. All of the above experiments were performed in accordance with Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee guidelines. Metabolic Rate Measurement—After 3.5 weeks of treatment, metabolic rate in ob/ob mice was measured using indirect calorimetry (Oxymax System; Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH). The animals were acclimated to metabolic chambers for 24 h before initiation of the measurement. For each treatment group, five animals were measured for a 24-h period. Biochemical Analysis—Plasma insulin levels were measured with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (ALPCO diagnostics, manufactured by Mercodia) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Plasma glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, aspartate transaminase, and alanine transaminase levels were measured with an Olympus Analyzer AU400 (Melville, NY). Gene Expression Analysis—For gene expression analysis, total RNA from hepatocytes was isolated by using a Qiagen RNA easy kit, and total RNA from animal tissues was isolated by homogenizing tissues in RLT buffer (Qiagen) followed by centrifugation with cesium chloride gradient. Real time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR was performed with custommade reverse transcription-PCR enzymes and reagents kit (Invitrogen), primer and probe sets designed with Primer Express Software (PE Applied Bioscience, Foster City, CA), and an ABI prism 7700 sequence detector (PE Applied Biosciences). For the analysis, 100 ng of total RNA was used for each reaction. Each sample was run in duplicate or triplicate, and the mean values were used to calculate the mRNA levels and gene expression. The expression was normalized with the amount of total RNA loaded that was determined with a RiboGreen assay. Insulin and Glucose Tolerance Tests (ITT and GTT)—ITT and GTT in DIO mice were conducted after 4.5 and 5.5 weeks of treatment, respectively. The mice were fasted for 4 h prior to ITT and overnight prior to GTT. Blood glucose levels were measured before insulin or glucose injection (0 min, base-line values), and the animals were then administered (intraperitoneally) insulin (R-insulin; Lilly Research Laboratories, Indianapolis, IN) at a dose of 0.5 unit/kg BW for ITT or glucose at 1.0 g/kg of BW. Blood glucose was then measured at 30, 60, 90, and 120 min after insulin or glucose injection using a Glucometer (Abbott Laboratories, Bedford, MA). Histological Analysis—Liver samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin wax for staining with hematoxylin and eosin or directly embedded in an optimal temperature embedding medium followed by immediate snap-freezing in liquid N2 for oil-red O staining. Multiple adjacent 6-μm sections were cut and mounted on glass slides and then stained. Images of the histological sections were analyzed. Western Blot Analysis—The cells were lysed, or tissues were homogenized in a lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm NaOV, 1 mm NaF) containing protease inhibitor mixture I (Calbiochem). The lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000 × g. Equal amounts of total protein for different samples were separated on 10% or 16% SDS-PAGE gels under reduced conditions and then transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. The blots were then incubated with antibody against IR-β subunit (C-19; Santa Cruz, CA), tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins (4G10; Upstate Biotechnology Inc., Lake Placid, NY) or Ser473-phosphorylated Akt (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA). The blots were also incubated with antibody against PTP1B, SHP2/SHPTP2 (from Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), PTEN (Cell Signaling, Danvers, MA and Upstate Biotechnology Inc.), or LMW-PTP antibody (kindly provided by Dr. Thomas Mustelin of Burnham Institute, La Jolla, CA). The signals were detected by using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody and ECL detection reagents. Immunoprecipitation—The clarified lysates were first incubated with protein agarose A/G beads (1:1 ratio) for 3-4 h at 4 °C followed by incubation with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody for another 3-4 h at 4 °C. The immunocomplex was washed with lysis buffer three times and then boiled in Laemmli’s sample buffer and Western blotted with anti-IR-β subunit antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) as described earlier. PI 3-Kinase Activity Assay—The PI3-K activity was measured as described previously (30Pandey S.K. Anand-Srivastava M.B. Srivastava A.K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7006-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). Briefly, the clarified lysates (500 μg of protein) were subjected to immunoprecipitation with 1 μg of IRS-1 or IRS-2 antibody for 2 h at 4°C, followed by incubation with protein A/G-Sepharose for an additional 2 h. The immunocomplexes were then washed and used for PI3-K activity assay using l-α-phosphatidylinositol and [γ-32P]ATP as substrates. The reaction was stopped by the addition of a mix of CHCl3:CH3OH:HCl (100:200:2). The produced phosphorylated lipid was extracted with CHCl3 and separated on a TLC plate. The plate was then exposed to a Kodak film. The radioactivity associated with PIP3 spots was quantified by Image Quant, or the PIP3 spots were scratched off the plates and counted in scintillation counter. Statistical Analysis—The values are expressed as the means ± S.E. of at least three to five in vitro or five in vivo independent measurements per treatment. Statistical difference across treatment groups was determined using Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance with Tukey HSD multiple comparisons. Differences were considered significant at p < 0.05. Reduction of LMW-PTP Expression Enhances Insulin Signaling in Mouse Hepatocytes—To investigate the role of LMW-PTP in insulin signaling, mouse primary hepatocytes were transfected with LMW-PTP ASO or vehicle. LMW-PTP ASO treatment reduced LMW-PTP mRNA levels by ∼90% (Fig. 1A), which was associated with dramatic reduction in the protein levels for both A and B isoforms (Fig. 1B). Reprobing the membrane with anti-PTP1B antibody revealed no compensatory increase in PTP1B protein levels in the ASO-treated cells (Fig. 1B). We next examined the effect of LMW-PTP reduction on the insulin activation of IR and Akt, two critical members of the insulin signaling cascade. LMW-PTP ASO or control ASO transfected mouse primary hepatocytes were incubated with insulin (10 nm) for 10 min, and cell lysates were prepared for Western blot analysis. Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of IRβ subunit (pY-IRβ; Fig. 1C) and Ser473 phosphorylation levels of Akt (pAktSer473; Fig. 1D) were higher in LMW-PTP ASO-treated cells than in control ASO-treated groups after insulin stimulation. Under these conditions there was no change in the total protein levels of either IRβ subunit (Fig. 1C) or Akt (Fig. 1D). To further confirm that these insulin enhancing effects were secondary to a specific antisense reduction of LMW-PTP, we evaluated the effect of second ASO (ASO 2) that was targeted to a different region of the LMW-PTP mRNA. ASO 2 reduced LMW-PTP expression to a similar extent as compared to ASO 1 and also enhanced the phosphorylation levels of AktSer473 to a similar extent upon insulin stimulation (Fig. 1D, middle panel). These data suggest that reduction of LMW-PTP expression sensitized the response of the hepatocytes to insulin stimulation without any compensation by PTP1B. Suppression of LMW-PTP Improves Insulin Sensitivity in DIO Mice with No Change in Body Weight—To ascertain the role of LMW-PTP in insulin action in vivo, we suppressed its expression with the ASO in high fat diet-induced obese (DIO) mice. After being fed a 60 kcal % fat diet for 12 weeks, the mice were treated with saline or a control ASO or LMW-PTP ASO (dissolved in saline) at a dose of 25 mg/kg of BW twice a week for 6 weeks. LMW-PTP ASO treatment reduced LMW-PTP mRNA levels by about 90% in liver and 75% in fat as compared with controls (Fig. 2A), which resulted in a significant reduction in both tissues of LMW-PTP protein levels (Fig. 2B). As was observed in hepatocytes, ASO-mediated reduction of LMW-PTP did not cause a compensatory increase in PTP1B protein levels in either tissue (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, we examined the expression of SHP2/SHPTP2 and PTEN; two well known phosphatases that play an important role in glucose homeostasis (14Butler M. McKay R.A. Popoff I.J. Gaarde W.A. Witchell D. Murray S.F. Dean N.M. Bhanot S. Monia B.P. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1028-1034Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 19Sleeman M.W. Wortley K.E. Lai K.M. Gowen L.C. Kintner J. Kline W.O. Garcia K. Stitt T.N. Yancopoulos G.D. Wiegand S.J. Glass D.J. Nat. Med. 2005; 11: 199-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Western blot analysis revealed that there was no significant difference in the protein levels of both these phosphatases between LMW-PTP ASO treatment group and saline or control ASO treatment group in liver or fat tissues of DIO mice (Fig. 2B, top and middle panels). Note that we observed two strong bands for SHP2/SHPTP2 in the liver tissues from both DIO and ob/ob mice (Figs. 2B and 3B, bottom panels, respectively) but one band for SHP2/SHPTP2 from the fat tissues of either animal model (Figs. 2B and 3B, bottom panels, respectively).FIGURE 3Suppression of LMW-PTP expression by LMW-PTP ASO improved insulin sensitivity in ob/ob mice. Treatment with LMW-PTP ASO reduced LMW-PTP mRNA levels by about 90% in liver and 60% in fat (A), which resulted in similar degrees of reduction in the LMW-PTP protein levels (both A and B isoforms) in liver and fat, respectively, without any compensatory changes in PTP1B, SHP2, and PTEN expression in these tissues (B). ASO treatment caused reduced fed (C) and fasted (D) plasma glucose levels as well as insulin levels (E). The ASO treatment improved liver steatosis, as demonstrated by hematoxylin and eosin staining and oil-red O staining (F). The data and representative blots presented were from at least five mice for each treatment group. *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01 versus controls.

In addition to a variation of sphingol species, hydroxylation of the amide-linked fatty acids contributes to the diversity of epidermal ceramides. Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, encoded by the gene FA2H, the mammalian homologue of FAH1 in yeast, catalyzes the synthesis of 2-hydroxy fatty acid-containing sphingolipids. We assessed here whether FA2H accounts for 2-hydroxyceramide/2-hydroxyglucosylceramide synthesis in epidermis. Reverse transcription-PCR and Western immunoblots demonstrated that FA2H is expressed in cultured human keratinocytes and human epidermis, with FA2H expression and fatty acid 2-hydroxylase activity increased with differentiation. FA2H-siRNA suppressed 2-hydroxylase activity and decreased 2-hydroxyceramide/2-hydroxyglucosylceramide levels, demonstrating that FA2H accounts for synthesis of these sphingolipids in keratinocytes. Whereas FA2H expression and 2-hydroxy free fatty acid production increased early in keratinocyte differentiation, production of 2-hydroxyceramides/2-hydroxyglucosylceramides with longer chain amide-linked fatty acids (≥C24) increased later. Keratinocytes transduced with FA2H-siRNA contained abnormal epidermal lamellar bodies and did not form the normal extracellular lamellar membranes required for the epidermal permeability barrier. These results reveal that 1) differentiation-dependent up-regulation of ceramide synthesis and fatty acid elongation is accompanied by up-regulation of FA2H; 2) 2-hydroxylation of fatty acid by FA2H occurs prior to generation of ceramides/glucosylceramides; and 3) 2-hydroxyceramides/2-hydroxyglucosylceramides are required for epidermal lamellar membrane formation. Thus, late differentiation-linked increases in FA2H expression are essential for epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis.

Thus, late differentiation-linked increases in FA2H expression are essential for epidermal permeability barrier homeostasis. Sphingolipids are ubiquitously distributed in eukaryotic cellular membranes, primarily in glycosylated and phosphorylated forms, which are involved in cell-cell recognition, signal transduction, and intercellular adhesion (see review in Refs. 1Hakomori S.

In addition to these ubiquitous bioregulatory functions, Cer are abundant bulk components of the extracellular lamellar membranes in the outermost layers of the epidermis, i.e. the stratum corneum (SC), where they subserve permeability barrier function (5Elias P.M. Menon G.K. Adv. Lipid Res. 1991; 24: 1-26Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Holleran W.M. Takagi Y. Uchida Y. FEBS Lett. 2006; 580: 5456-5466Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Newly synthesized Cer are converted to glucosylceramide (GlcCer) and sphingomyelin in the suprabasal, nucleated cell layers of the epidermis, but following secretion at the stratum granulosum-SC interface, these polar precursors are hydrolyzed, again generating Cer (7Holleran W.M.

To fulfill this barrier requirement, Cer synthesis increases during epidermal differentiation under basal conditions and accelerates still further in response to acute barrier perturbations (11Holleran W.M.

Galactosylceramides and sulfatides containing amide-linked 2-hydroxy fatty acids (2-OH FA) are plentiful in the central and peripheral nervous systems of mammals (12Hoshi M. Kishimoto Y. J. Biol.

Lipid Res. 1963; 4: 139-143Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), whereas Cer containing 2-OH FA (N-2-hydroxy-acylsphingosine or 2-OH Cer) and N-ω-hydroxy-acylsphingosine (ω-OH Cer), as well as their glucosylated counterparts, 2-OH GlcCer and ω-OH GlcCer, are also abundant in epidermis (10Hamanaka S.

Whereas ω-OH Cer and ω-OH GlcCer are found only in the differentiated layers of mammalian epidermis, where they are known to be important for epidermal permeability barrier function (16Behne M.

In model lipid systems, the 2-OH moiety stabilizes multilammelar structures by increasing intermolecular hydrogen bonding (18Veiga M.P. Arrondo J.L. Goni F.M. Alonso A. Marsh D.

In addition to the contribution of N-(ω-O-acyl)-acylsphingosine (acylCer) to the long periodicity phase in SC lamellar bilayer membranes (20de Jager M.W. Gooris G.S. Dolbnya I.P. Bras W. Ponec M. Bouwstra J.A. Chem. Phys. Lipids. 2003; 124: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), 2-OH Cer appears to play a supportive role in the formation of this phase (21Bleck O. Abeck D. Ring J. Hoppe U. Vietzke J.P. Wolber R. Brandt O. Schreiner V. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1999; 113: 894-900Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Thus, 2-OH Cer could be important for permeability barrier function. Additionally, because exogenous 2-OH Cer are less pro-apoptotic than nonhydroxylated Cer (22Ji L. Zhang G. Uematsu S. Akahori Y. Hirabayashi Y. FEBS Lett. 1995; 358: 211-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), conversion to 2-OH Cer could protect the epidermis from apoptosis, as bulk Cer synthesis increases during epidermal differentiation. Prior studies have demonstrated that a non-P-450 protein is responsible for the 2-hydroxylation of fatty acid (FA) in murine brain (12Hoshi M. Kishimoto Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4123-4130Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Subsequently, the gene that encodes the fatty acid 2-hydroxylase, FAH1 (SCS7), was identified in yeast (23Haak D. Gable K.

The mammalian homologue of FAH1, FA2H, was recently identified and found to encode a 43-kDa transmembrane protein (25Alderson N.L. Rembiesa B.M. Walla M.D. Bielawska A. Bielawski J. Hama H. J. Biol.

Zoller I. Gieselmann V. Biochem. J. 2005; 388: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar), which likely accounts for the progressive incorporation of 2-OH galactosylceramide into myelin (29Hoshi M. Williams M. Kishimoto Y. J. Neurochem. 1973; 21: 709-712Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). We and others have demonstrated the molecular heterogeneity of both Cer and GlcCer in epidermis, including a progressive enrichment in 2-OH Cer and 2-OH GlcCer species during keratinocyte differentiation (30Ponec M. Weerheim A. Kempenaar J. Mommaas A.M. Nugteren D.H. J. Lipid Res. 1988; 29: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Hamanaka S. Nakazawa S. Yamanaka M. Uchida Y. Otsuka F. Br. J. Dermatol. 2005; 152: 426-434Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although these results suggest that 2-OH FA synthesis could be linked to keratinocyte differentiation, neither the regulation of FA2H in relation to keratinocyte differentiation nor its role in 2-OH Cer/2-OH GlcCer synthesis in epidermis has been assessed systematically. Here, we demonstrate that FA2H: 1) is expressed in cultured human keratinocytes (CHK) and in human epidermis in a differentiation-associated manner; 2) accounts for 2-OH Cer/2-OH GlcCer generation in keratinocytes; 3) utilizes FA as a substrate; and 4) is required for epidermal permeability barrier formation. Materials—Cer and GlcCer were purchased from Sigma and Matreya (Pleasant Gap, PA), respectively. High performance thin layer chromatography plates (Silica Gel 60) were purchased from Merck. Cell Culture—Normal human keratinocytes were isolated from neonatal foreskins by a modification of the method of Pittelkow and Scott (32Pittelkow M.R. Scott R.E. Mayo Clin. Proc. 1986; 61: 771-777Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) under an Institutional Review Board-approval protocol (University of California, San Francisco). The cells were grown in keratinocyte growth medium supplemented with bovine epidermal growth factor, bovine pituitary extract, insulin, hydrocortisone, and 0.07 mm calcium chloride (Cascade Biologics, Portland, OR). CHK at three subsequent stages of differentiation were employed for these studies. To generate undifferentiated CHK, the cells were grown in a low Ca2+ (0.07 mm)-containing and serum-free medium and harvested at 80–90% confluence. For early stage differentiated CHK, a Ca2+ concentration in the medium was raised to 1.2 mm Ca2+, when the cells were at 90% confluence, and harvested 2 days later. Advanced stage differentiated CHK, which generate both epidermal lamellar bodies and the full spectrum of Cer species (33Uchida Y. Behne M. Quiec D. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1307-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), were obtained by post-confluent growth of CHK in Dulbecco’s and Ham F-12 media (2:1, v/v), containing ≥1.2 mm calcium, supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, insulin (10 μg/ml), hydrocortisone (0.4 μg/ml) (34Sando G.N.

The cultures were maintained at 37 °C under 5% CO2 in air. Because we use primary human cultured keratinocytes isolated from neonatal foreskin from various donors, we prepared analytical samples from two or three different cell preparations to minimize possible variation between sources of skin and combined these samples for analysis. In addition, we combined multiple culture dishes (five to ten) in each experiment to further minimize differences between dishes. Assay of Fatty Acid 2-Hydroxylation Activity—Fatty acid 2-hydroxylase activity was measured as described previously (26Alderson N.L. Walla M.D. Hama H. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 1569-1575Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomal fractions (25 μg of protein) or cell lysate (50 μg of protein) were incubated with 2.7 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, containing 1.28 mm NADP, 3.3 mm glucose 6-phosphate, 3.3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 unit of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase, 1 μg of human NADPH:cytochrome P-450 reductase, with the substrate, 1 μg (2.7 nmol) of [3,3,5,5-D4]tetracosanoic acid (C24) at 37 °C for 120 min. At the end of incubations, 1 pmol of tricosanoic acid (C23) was added to each sample as an internal standard, and FA were extracted immediately with 100% diethyl ether following acidification by glacial acetic acid. FA were converted to O-trimethylsilyl FA methyl esters, and then the derivatives were analyzed by gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (GCMS-QP2010; Shimadzu Scientific, Columbia, MD) on a Restek RTX-5 column (30 m × 0.25 mm I.D., 0.25 μm D.F., Restek Corporation Bellefonte, PA). The initial temperature was 110 °C with 10 °C increases each min up to 300 °C. Blockade of FA2H Activity Using siRNA—CHK, cultured in a low Ca2+ (0.07 mm) and serum-free medium, were incubated with 30 nm of siRNAs for FA2H (Ambion, Austin, TX or B-Bridge International, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA), using X-treme-GEN siRNA transfection reagent (Roche Applied Science) for 24 h. The mixtures of siRNA duplex (1:1:1) with the following sense and antisense sequences were used: 5′-GGAUUUGGUAUCAGCACUA-3′ (sense) and 5′-UAGUGCUGAUACCAAAUCC-3′ (antisense); 5′-GGCUAAAGAGAAGCAG UUU-3′ (sense) and 5′-AAACUGCUUCUCUUUAGCC-3′ (antisense); and 5′-CCACGGUUCAAAGUGGUGG-3′ (sense) and 5′-CCACCACUUUGAACCGUGG-3′ (antisense). siRNA for green fluorescence protein (B-Bridge International, Inc.) was used as control siRNA control. The Ca2+ concentration in the medium was then raised to 1.2 mm and cultured for 48 h. Alternatively, siRNA were transfected into CHK twice. The medium was switched to advanced differentiation medium (as above) 24 h following the first transfection and cultured for an additional 24 h. CHK then were incubated with siRNA mixtures for second time (as above) for 48 h and cultured for an additional 3 days. Reverse Transcription-PCR Analysis—Reverse transcription-PCR or quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (q-rtPCR) was performed using cDNA prepared from total RNA, as described previously (35Houben E. Holleran W.M. Yaginuma T. Mao C. Obeid L.M. Rogiers V. Takagi Y. Elias P.M. Uchida Y. J. Lipid Res. 2006; 47: 1063-1070Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 36Uchida Y.

The following primer sets were used for q-rtPCR 5′-AGCCTGTAGCCCTTGAGGAAAC-3′ and 5′-TTCACCACCTAACCCTGTTCC-3′ (77 bp). For q-rtPCR, 10 ng of cDNA was mixed with sets of primer pairs (final concentration, 200 pm) and SYBR Green PCR mix containing Taq DNA polymerase and SYBR Green I dye (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). The thermal cycling conditions were 50 °C for 2 min, 95 °C for 10 min followed by 95 °C for 15 s, and 60 °C for 1 min, repeated for 40 times on ABI Prism 7700 (Applied Biosystems). The values shown represent the means (±S.D.) for three independent assays. mRNA expression was normalized to levels of 18 S ribosomal RNA and G3PDH. Western Immunoblot Analysis—Western blot analysis was performed using a previously described procedure (36Uchida Y. Murata S. Schmuth M. Behne M.J. Lee J.D. Ichikawa S. Elias P.M. Hirabayashi Y.

Briefly, the cell lysates (prepared as described above) were suspended in sample buffer (60 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, containing 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% β-mercaptoethanol, and 0.005% bromphenol blue) and resolved by electrophoresis on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel (20 μg of proteins/lane). The resultant bands were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane, probed with anti-human FA2H polyclonal antibody (25Alderson N.L. Rembiesa B.M. Walla M.D. Bielawska A.

Chem. 2004; 279: 48562-48568Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and detected using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences). Analysis of Amide-linked FA of Cer and GlcCer—Total lipids were isolated from CHK by the method of Bligh and Dyer (37Bligh E.G. Dyer W.J. Can. J. Biochem. Physiol. 1959; 37: 911-917Crossref PubMed Scopus (42855) Google Scholar), and Cer/GlcCer fractions were fractionated as described previously (10Hamanaka S. Hara M. Nishio H. Otsuka F. Suzuki A.

Briefly, total lipid extracts were first applied to aminopropyl silica gel column (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA), equilibrated with n-hexane to separate the Cer and GlcCer containing fraction from free FA (FFA). After washing the column with n-hexane, the fraction containing Cer and GlcCer was eluted with chloroform-isopropanol (2:1, v/v). FFA fraction was then eluted with 2% acetic acid in diethylether. The Cer- and GlcCer-containing fraction was subjected to mild alkaline hydrolysis and then enriched on an aminopropyl silica gel column, as above. To quantify the amide-linked FA of Cer and GlcCer, a mixture of odd chain FA (C15-C25) was added to each sample as internal standards. Following methanolysis the resulting FA methylesters were derivatized to O-trimethylsilyl ethers and then were analyzed by gas liquid chromatographymass spectrometry, as above. Electron Microscopy—CHK samples were fixed in situ by the addition of modified Karnovsky’s fixative to the Petri dish for 1 h (room temperature), transferred to a glass tube, and fixed further overnight (4 °C); the samples were divided and post-fixed in either ruthenium tetroxide or 2% aqueous osmium tetroxide, both containing 1.5% potassium ferrocyanide, as previously described (33Uchida Y.

Ghadially R. Elias P.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 1991; 96: 215-223Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar). After fixation, all of the samples were dehydrated in graded ethanol solutions and embedded in an Epon-epoxy mixture. Ultrathin sections were examined, with or without further contrasting with lead citrate, in an electron microscope (Zeiss 10A; Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) operated at 60 kV. Statistical Analysis—Statistical analyses were performed using an unpaired Student’s t test. Increased FA 2-Hydroxylase Activity Parallels Increased 2-OH Cer/2-OH GlcCer Generation during Keratinocyte Differentiation—The molecular heterogeneity of Cer and GlcCer, including the appearance of species containing amide-linked 2-OH FA, becomes evident late in keratinocyte differentiation (33Uchida Y. Behne M. Quiec D. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1307-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, keratinocytes further 2-hydroxylate some FFA, generating 2-OH Cer and 2-OH GlcCer (33Uchida Y. Behne M. Quiec D. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1307-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Hence, we first compared FA 2-hydroxylase expression in relation to the generation of 2-OH Cer/2-OH GlcCer as CHK progressively differentiate. Three different stages of differentiation were assessed: 1) undifferentiated, proliferative CHK (undifferentiated CHK); 2) early stage differentiated CHK; and 3) advanced stage differentiated CHK) (for details see “Experimental Procedures”). Cellular proliferation declines, and differentiation initiates by 2 days following an increase in medium Ca2+ concentration from 0.07 to 1.2 mm (39Pillai S. Bikle D.D. Hincenbergs M. Elias P.M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1988; 134: 229-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar), but late differentiation markers, e.g. loricrin (40Denning M.F. Kazanietz M.G. Blumberg P.M. Yuspa S.H. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 1619-1626PubMed Google Scholar) and the full spectrum of Cer species, characteristic of SC, appear only after CHK stratify with prolonged growth in high Ca2+ plus vitamin C and 10% serum (33Uchida Y. Behne M. Quiec D. Elias P.M. Holleran W.M. J. Investig. Dermatol. 2001; 117: 1307-1313Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). As noted previously (33Uchida Y. Behne M.

Moreover, gas liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of amide-linked FA in the Cer and GlcCer fractions indicates increased levels of molecular species containing 2-OH FA in advanced stage differentiated CHK (359% of undifferentiated CHK and 333% of early stage differentiated CHK) (Table 1).TABLE 1Amide-linked FA composition of Cer and GlcCer of CHKFA compositionUndifferentiated CHKEarly stage differentiated CHKAdvanced stage differentiated CHKnmol/mg of protein (% total FA)Total FA208.7 (100)216.4 (100)246.3 (100)Total non-OH FA170.4 (81.7)175.1 (80.9)108.7 (44.2)16:078.9 (37.8)80.0 (37.0)50.0 (20.3)18:090.0 (43.1)92.5 (42.7)49.8 (20.2)20:00.51 (0.2)0.71 (0.3)0.34 (0.1)22:00.73 (0.3)0.99 (0.5)5.65 (2.3)24:00.29 (0.1)0.81 (0.4)2.59 (1.1)26:00.04 (0.02)0.13 (0.1)0.36 (0.1)Total 2-OH38.3 (18.3)41.2 (19.1)137.5 (55.8)2-OH 16:037.1 (17.8)40.2 (18.6)86.2 (35.0)2-OH 18:00.29 (0.1)0.41 (0.2)8.03 (3.3)2-OH 20:00.11 (0.03)0.20 (0.1)2.96 (1.2)2-OH 22:00.06 (0.2)0.07 (0.03)2.81 (1.1)2-OH 24:00.47 (0.2)0.30 (0.1)29.2 (11.9)2-OH 26:00.25 (0.1)0.06 (0.03)8.33 (3.4) Open table in a new tab We next compared FA 2-hydroxylase activity in the CHK in parallel cultures, i.e. three stages of differentiation.

Yet there was no further increase in enzyme activity in advanced versus early stage differentiated CHK. Together, these results show that FA 2-hydroxylase activity is up-regulated during keratinocyte differentiation in parallel with the appearance of increased levels of 2-OH Cer/2-OH GlcCer.TABLE 2Increased FA 2-hydroxylase activity and FA2H mRNA levels in differentiated CHKFA2H activitymRNA expression relative to undifferentiated CHKExperiment 1Experiment 2nmol/mg of protein/minUndifferentiated CHK0.310.211.00 ± 0.21Early stage differentiated CHK4.874.654.91 ± 0.79Advanced stage differentiated CHK4.384.546.58 ± 1.03 Open table in a new tab FA2H mRNA and Protein Expression Increase with Keratinocyte Differentiation—To investigate whether the differentiation-associated increase in enzyme activity is regulated at a transcriptional level, we next compared mRNA levels for FA2H under the same conditions.

https://openalex.org/W2071661441,"We have previously shown that disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential by depletion of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or treatment with a mitochondrial ionophore, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, initiates a stress signaling, which causes resistance to apoptosis, and induces invasive behavior in C2C12 myocytes and A549 cells. In the present study we show that calcineurin (Cn), activated as part of this stress signaling, plays an important role in increased glucose uptake and glycolysis. Here we report that, although both insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor levels (IR and IGF1R, respectively) are increased in response to mitochondrial stress, autophosphorylation of IGF1R was selectively increased suggesting a shift in receptor pathways. Using an approach with FK506, an inhibitor of Cn, and mRNA silencing by small interference RNA we show that mitochondrial stress-activated Cn is critical for increased GLUT 4 and IGF1R expression and activation. The importance of the IGF1R pathway in cell survival under mitochondrial stress is demonstrated by increased apoptosis either by IGF1R mRNA silencing or by treatment with IGF1R inhibitors (AG1024 and picropodophyllin).

Similarly, a cybrid cell line carrying mutations in mtDNA-encoded ATPase6 gene exhibited increased tumorigenicity and reduced apoptosis (18Petros J.A. Baumann A.K. Ruiz-Pesini E. Amin M.B. Sun C.Q. Hall J. Lim S. Issa M.M. Flanders W.D. Hosseini S.H. Marshall F.F. Wallace D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2005; 102: 719-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (676) Google Scholar, 19Shidara Y. Yamagata K.

An increasing number of recent studies shows that proliferating tumors in both human patients and animal models contain mutated or deleted mtDNA and/or dysfunctional mitochondria (19Shidara Y.

In mtDNA-depleted C2C12 and A549 cells, increased resistance to apoptosis was associated with higher expression of Bcl2 and/or increased phosphorylation of Bid, Bad, and Bax (22Biswas G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Avadhani N.G. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Rapidly growing tumors meet their metabolic demand by increased expression of genes encoding glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes (23Mazurek S. Eigenbrodt E. Anticancer Res. 2003; 23: 1149-1154PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study we investigated the mechanism of cell proliferation and induced glycolysis in C2C12 cells subjected to mitochondrial respiratory stress. Our results show that selective inhibition of IR autophosphorylation and Cn-dependent activation of the IGF1R pathway is the basis for increased glucose utilization and cell proliferation. Interestingly, mitochondrial stress-induced metabolic change appears to be an important survival factor in these cells, because blocking the IGF1R function caused increased cell death. Results also show that elevated GLUT 4 and IGF1R levels are directly related to increased Cn activity, which is an essential component of the mitochondria-to-nucleus stress signaling pathway. Cell Lines and Culture Conditions—Murine C2C12 skeletal myoblasts (ATCC CRL1772), human pulmonary carcinoma A549 cells (ATTC CCL 185), mouse fibroblasts NIH 3T3 (ATCC CRL-1658), and rat H9C2 cardiac myocytes (ATCC CRL 1446) were grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Life Technology Inc.) supplemented with 10% FBS and 0.1% gentamycin. In some specified experiments charcoal-treated FBS was used. Depletion of mtDNA was carried out by EtBr treatment (100 ng/ml, for 30 passages) as described before (2Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Selected clones containing ∼20% mtDNA contents were grown in presence of 1 mm sodium pyruvate and 50 μg/ml uridine. Reverted cells represent mtDNA-depleted cells (with 85% DNA depleted) grown for 30 cycles in the absence of EtBr until the mtDNA content reached 80% of control cells. The mtDNA contents were estimated by Southern hybridization using a DNA probe from cytochrome oxidase I + II coding region as described before (2Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). Calcineurin Aα, IGF1R, and IR mRNA Knockdown by siRNA—Predesigned siRNAs for mouse CnAα (ID #292199), IGF1R (ID #159115), and IR (ID #67808) and negative controls (scrambled siRNA) were purchased from Ambion Inc. (Austin, TX). Control and mtDNA-depleted cells (104 cells/well) were transfected with pre-annealed double-stranded siRNAs at a final concentration of 30 nm by the method of reverse transfection. Transient transfections were carried out in triplicate using siPORT NeoFX reagent (Ambion Inc). RNA was isolated 48 h after transfections using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen), and the level of silencing of CnAα, IGF1R, and IR mRNA was quantitated by real-time PCR as described later in this section. Transfection with IGF1R cDNA—MtDNA-depleted cells were transfected with human IGF1R cDNA, kindly provided by Dr. Renato Baserga (Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, PA) (24Pietrzkowski Z. Lammers R. Carpenter G. Soderquist A.M. Limardo M. Philiphs P.D. Baserga R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1992; 3: 199-205PubMed Google Scholar) using FuGENE 6 by a standard method described before (1Amuthan G. Biswas G. Zhang S.Y. Klein-Szanto A. Vijayasarathy C. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1910-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Uptake of 2-Deoxyglucose—Glucose uptake was measured as described previously (25Frevert E.U. Kahn B.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells grown in 6-well plates were serum-starved for 6 h, and incubated in the presence or absence of indicated levels of insulin for 30 min in glucose-free medium. 1 μCi of 2-[3H]DOG (1 mCi/0.1 mmol, American Radiolabeled Chemicals, St. Louis, MO) was added to each well containing 2 ml of medium and incubated for an additional 15 min. The transport was terminated by washing cells rapidly three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in 1 n NaOH. Aliquots of the lysates were counted in liquid scintillation counter (Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Measurement of Cellular ATP Levels—Total cellular ATP levels were determined by bioluminescence using ATP-bioluminescent somatic cell assay kit (Sigma) as described before (6Amuthan G. Biswas G. Ananadatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Shephard H.M. Avadhani N.G. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 7839-7849Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Briefly, 106 cells were lysed using the “somatic cell releasing reagent,” which caused the release of cellular ATP by altering membrane permeability. ATP-dependent formation of light was measured in a Chameleon Multilabel Microplate Reader (Bioscan Inc., Washington, D. C.) with appropriate ATP standards. In these experiments, cells were treated with 25 μm CCCP and/or 25 μm oligomycin for 1 h. Measurement of Hexokinase, Phosphofructokinase, and Pyruvate Kinase Activities—Hexokinase assay was carried out as described by Miccoli et al. (26Miccoli L. Oudard S. Sureau F. Poirson F. Dutrillaux B. Poupon M.F. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 957-962Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Glucose 6-phosphate produced in the hexokinase reaction was coupled to glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μg of the cell lysate, and the rate of NADPH production was measured by the increase in absorbance at 340 nm for 20 min in a Cary Varian spectrophotometer. Phosphofructokinase activity was measured spectrophotometrically by coupling the enzyme with aldolase, triosephosphate isomerase, and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as described before (27Liu Y.Q. Tornheim K. Leahy J.L. J. Clin. Invest. 1998; 101: 1870-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of 50 μg of the cell lysate, and the rate of NADH metabolized over a time of 20 min was measured by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. Pyruvate kinase reaction was coupled to lactate dehydrogenase, and the activity was measured by the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm for 20 min as described before (28Devin A. Nogueira V. Leverve X. Guerin B. Rigoulet M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 3943-3949Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The reaction was started by the addition of 0.15 mm phosphoenolpyruvate and 50 μg of the cell lysate. Calcineurin Activity Assay—Calcineurin activity was assayed according to Antoni et al. (29Antony F.A. Shipston M.J. Smith S.M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 194: 226-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) with the following modifications. Total serine/threonine phosphatase activity was first determined by incubating cell lysate (2 μg) from untreated, AICAR (2 mm, 2 h)-treated, and FK506 (10 nm, 30 min)-treated cells with threonine phosphopeptide (Upstate, Cat. no. 12-219) in a final volume of 25 μl for 20 min at 30 °C in 50 μm Tris-Cl, pH 7.0, 0.1 mm CaCl2. The phosphate released was quantitated by incubating with 100 μl of malachite green and measuring the absorbance at 660 nm after 15 min. In parallel, control incubations containing phosphatase inhibitor mix I (NaF, 5 mm; okadaic acid, 500 nm; orthovanadate, 100 μm; FK506, 1 nm; calyculin, 0.1 μm; and cyclosporine A, 100 μm) and phosphatase inhibitors mix II (FK506, 1 nm; calyculin, 0.1 μm; and cyclosporine A, 100 μm) were also carried out. Nonspecific phosphatase activity under these conditions was subtracted from total serine/threonine phosphatase activity referred to as corrected activity. Calcineurin activity was calculated by subtracting the activity obtained from incubation with phosphatase inhibitor mix II from the corrected activity. Immunoprecipitation and Receptor Autophosphorylation—Plasma membrane fractions from control and mtDNA-depleted C2C12 cells were isolated as described (30Nishimura H. Saltis J. Habberfield A.D. Garty N.B. Greenberg A.S. Cushman S.W. Londos C. Simpson I.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 11500-11504Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylation of the IR and IGF1R in the plasma membrane fractions was carried out at 37 °C in the presence of 10 mm MnCl2, [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 mm and 2-15 cpm/fmol), 0.1 μm insulin for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 15 mm EDTA. The autophosphorylated receptors (100 μg of plasma membrane protein) were immunoprecipitated overnight at 4 °C with the IR or IGF1Rβ antibody (2 μg/ml). The immune complexes were collected on Protein A-agarose beads (Sigma) and washed extensively with PBS. The immunoprecipitates were extracted from the beads with 2× Laemmli buffer devoid of β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 5 min for further analysis. Immunoblot Analysis—The protein contents were estimated by the Lowry method (31Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cytosolic, nuclear, and plasma membrane proteins (30 μg) solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer were resolved by electrophoresis on 10 or 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207018) Google Scholar) and subjected to immunoblot analysis. The immunoblots were developed using SuperSignal West Femto maximum sensitivity substrate (Pierce). In each case, blots presented here are a representative of two to three independent experiments. Plasma Membrane Lawn Assay—The level of plasma membrane GLUT 4 was determined using the plasma membrane lawn assay as described earlier (33MaCaulay S.L. Stoichevska V. Grusovin J. Gough K.H. Castelli L.A. Ward C.W. Biochem. J. 2003; 376: 123-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Cells grown on poly-l-lysine-coated coverslips were treated with or without insulin (100 nm for 30 min). The coverslips were rinsed in PBS and subjected to hypotonic shock with three washes (10 s each) in membrane buffer (70 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 3 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 30 mm HEPES, pH 7.2). The coverslips were submerged in membrane buffer and sonicated using a Probe sonicator, to generate a lawn of plasma membrane fragments that remained attached to the coverslip. The fragments were then immunolabeled with anti-GLUT 4 polyclonal antibody (1:100, U.S. Biologicals, Swampscott, MA) and Alexa 488 goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Molecular Probes, 1:300). The membrane fragments were viewed through an immunofluorescence microscope. At least six fields were examined within any one experiment for each condition. mRNA Quantitation by Real-time PCR—Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent as per the supplier’s protocol (Invitrogen). cDNA was generated from 5 μg of RNA using the cDNA Archive kit from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA), and 50 ng of this cDNA was used as template per reaction. Relative quantification of GLUT 4, IGF1R, and IR mRNA by real-time PCR was done using a TaqMan assay probe (Applied Biosystems), and CnAα mRNA was quantified using SYBR Green (Applied Biosystems) in an ABI PRISM 7300 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems). Data were normalized to 18 S RNA (for TaqMan assay) and β-actin contents (for SYBR Green) as endogenous controls. Annexin V Assay—The assay for cells undergoing apoptosis was performed using a Nexin Kit (Guava Technologies, Hayward, CA) according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. Cells (106 each) treated without or with inhibitors (Genistein, 0.1 mg/ml; AG1024, 10 μm; and PPP, 2.5 μm) for 2 h were washed with 1 ml of 1× Nexin Buffer (Guava Technologies) and resuspended in the same buffer. After labeling with Annexin V-PE, the percentage of apoptotic cells was quantified using the Personal Cytometer (Guava Technologies). In the case of the siRNA experiments, cells were harvested 48 h after the siRNA transfections and counted as described above. Matrigel Invasion Assay—The in vitro invasion assays were carried out as described previously (34Yagel S. Warner A.H. Nellans H.N. Lala P.K. Waghorne C. Denhardt D.T. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 3553-3557PubMed Google Scholar). The Matrigel invasion chambers were prepared at 1:2 dilution of Matrigel (BD Biosciences, Belford, MA) as described before (1Amuthan G. Biswas G. Zhang S.Y. Klein-Szanto A. Vijayasarathy C. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 1910-1920Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Equal numbers of viable cells (4 × 104) were seeded on top of the Matrigel layer. After incubation for 24 h at 37 °C, non-invading cells in the Matrigel layer were quantitatively removed, and the microporous membrane containing invaded cells was stained and viewed under a Olympus BX 61 bright field microscope as described before (22Biswas G. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Avadhani N.G. Cell Death Differ. 2005; 12: 266-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). At least six fields were examined within any one experiment for each condition. Statistical Analysis—Data on enzyme activity, glucose uptake, mRNA quantitation, and immunoblot analysis have been presented as means ± S.D. of three to five independent measurements. Differences between paired variables were determined using two-way analysis of variance. p values <0.05 were considered statistically significant, and p values <0.001 were highly significant. Increased Glucose Uptake by mtDNA-depleted Cells—Initially, we evaluated glucose uptake by control and mtDNA-depleted C2C12 cells containing 20% of control cell mtDNA content, and reverted cells with mtDNA content restored to ∼80% of control cells (Fig. 1A, left panel). Fig. 1A (right panel) shows the relative levels of nuclear DNA as assessed by the cytochrome c oxidase IVil amplicons using 10 ng of genomic DNA template in each case. Aliquots of cells from the same parent stock culture as shown in Fig. 1A were used to ascertain uniform cellular mtDNA contents in all experiments reported herein. We studied the uptake of 2-DOG in the three cell types under uninduced and insulin stimulation, with insulin concentrations ranging from 0 to 1 μm (Fig. 1B). The mtDNA-depleted cells showed >2-fold higher glucose uptake in the absence of added insulin (basal) compared with control cells (p ≤ 0.001). The reverted cells showed glucose uptake closer to the control cells. With added 0.1 μm insulin, the mtDNA-depleted cells showed nearly 2-fold higher glucose uptake than control cells. With 0.5 μm and 1 μm insulin, the increase was only 60 and 40%, respectively, suggesting a saturating effect. Results also showed that all three cell lines take up higher 2-DOG in response to increasing levels of insulin, although the increase was markedly apparent in control and reverted cells (p < 0.05), but less apparent in mtDNA-depleted cells. The glucose uptake in mtDNA-depleted cells with added 1 μm insulin as compared with no insulin controls was also significant (p < 0.05). Although not shown, a similar pattern of 3-O-methyl-d-glucose uptake was observed confirming altered transport. The mitochondrial stress-induced signaling in different cell lines involves activation of Cn and its related factors (2Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar, 5Butow R.A. Avadhani N.G. Mol. Cell. 2004; 14: 1-15Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar). Fig. 1C shows that FK506, an inhibitor of Cn, inhibited glucose uptake by control and reverted cells only marginally (15 and 20%, respectively), but to a markedly higher extent of 70% in mtDNA-depleted cells (p ≤ 0.001). These results suggested the role of Cn in glucose uptake. A reduced glucose uptake by reverted cells also suggested a direct link between mitochondrial genetic stress and glucose uptake. Previously we proposed that disruption of ΔΨm by CCCP treatment also activates the mitochondrial stress signaling similar to mtDNA depletion (2Biswas G. Adebanjo O.A. Freedman B.D. Anandatheerthavarada H.K. Vijayasarathy C. Zaidi M. Kotlikoff M. Avadhani N.G. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 522-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar). In accordance with these observations, CCCP treatment indeed caused ∼2.5-fold higher glucose uptake by C2C12 cells, which was further increased by ∼40% in response to added insulin (Fig. 1D). These results further support the role of mitochondrial stress in inducing cellular glucose uptake. The predominant isoforms of glucose transporters in skeletal muscle cells are GLUT 4 and GLUT 1 (35Watson R.T. Pessin J.E. Recent Prog. Horm. Res. 2001; 56: 175-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). There was no difference in the levels of GLUT 1 between control and mtDNA-depleted cells (data not shown). In keeping with the results of glucose uptake, immunoblot in Fig. 2A shows that mtDNA-depleted cells contain >2-fold higher GLUT 4 protein as compared with control cells, which is in accordance with 3- to 4-fold higher mRNA level (Fig. 2B). GLUT 4 protein (Fig. 2A) and mRNA (Fig. 2B) levels in reverted cells were markedly lower than that of mtDNA-depleted cells and closer to that of control cells. These results show that increased GLUT 4 expression is directly related to mitochondrial stress. GLUT 4 mRNA level in mtDNA-depleted cells, but not in control cells, was sensitive to AG1024, an inhibitor of IGF1R. Although not shown, PPP, a more specific inhibitor of IGF1R (36Girnita A. All-Ericsson C. Economou M.A. Astrom K. Axelson M. Seregard S. Larsson O. Girnita L. Clin. Cancer Res. 2006; 12: 1383-1391Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 37Stromberg T. Ekman S. Girnita L. Dimberg L.Y. Larsson O. Axelson M. Lennartsson J. Hellman U. Carlson K. Osterborg A. Vanderkerken K. Nilsson K. Jernberg-Wiklund H. Blood. 2006; 107: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar) also decreased GLUT 4 protein levels in mtDNA-depleted cells. These results suggest that increased GLUT 4 expression in response to mitochondrial stress may be related to stress-mediated activation of IGF1R pathway. In keeping with increased glucose uptake (Fig. 1D), addition of CCCP increased the level of GLUT 4 in control cells. Additionally, FK506 added to mtDNA-depleted cells resulted in a marked reduction of both GLUT 4 protein and mRNA level (Fig. 2, A and B) further suggesting the role of Cn pathway in increased glucose uptake. Relative contributions of IGF1R and Cn activation on GLUT 4 expression was further investigated by overexpression of IGF1R in mtDNA-depleted cells treated with Cn inhibitor FK506. As seen from Fig. 2C, FK506 treatment caused a 60% reduction of GLUT 4 mRNA in mock transfected mtDNA-depleted cells. Transfection of mtDNA-depleted cells with IGF1R cDNA caused a near 2-fold increase in GLUT 4 mRNA level, which was reduced to near basal level by FK506. These results suggest that IGF1R and Cn pathways may cooperatively induce the expression of GLUT 4 mRNA. The results also show that GLUT 4 protein and mRNA contents were increased by 2.5- to 4.0-fold in mtDNA-depleted cells that returned close to the control cell level in reverted cells. We carried out the lawn assay for determining the level of GLUT 4 protein in the plasma membrane compartment of control and mtDNA-depleted cells. Fig. 2D shows that the basal level of GLUT 4 in the plasma membrane fraction was higher in mtDNA-depleted cells as compared with control cells. Furthermore, insulin treatment increased the plasma membrane contents of GLUT 4 in both cell types. These results are consistent with GLUT4 mRNA and protein levels in mtDNA-depleted c"
https://openalex.org/W2000185616,"How and why tumors metastasize is still a matter of debate. The assumption is that mutations render tumor cells with a metastatic phenotype, enabling entrance in and transport through lymph or blood vessels. Distant outgrowth is thought to occur only in a suitable microenvironment (the seed and soil hypothesis). However, the anatomical location of most metastases in cancer patients suggests entrapment of tumor cells in the first microcapillary bed that is encountered. We here investigated how vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) attributes to the metastatic process. We describe here that VEGF-A enhances spontaneous metastasis by inducing intravasation of heterogeneous tumor cell clusters, surrounded by vessel wall elements, via an invasion-independent mechanism. These tumor clusters generate metastatic tissue embolisms in pulmonary arteries. Treatment of tumor-bearing mice with the antiangiogenic compound ZD6474 prevented the development of this metastatic phenotype. This work shows that tumors with high constitutive VEGF-A expression metastasize via the formation of tumor emboli and provides an alternative rationale for anti-VEGF-A therapy, namely to inhibit metastasis formation."
https://openalex.org/W1976781795,"TREX1 is the most abundant mammalian 3′ → 5′ DNA exonuclease. It has been described to form part of the SET complex and is responsible for the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome in humans. Here we show that the exonuclease activity is correlated to the binding preferences toward certain DNA sequences. In particular, we have found three motifs that are selected, GAG, ACA, and CTGC. To elucidate how the discrimination occurs, we determined the crystal structures of two murine TREX1 complexes, with a nucleotide product of the exonuclease reaction, and with a single-stranded DNA substrate. Using confocal microscopy, we observed TREX1 both in nuclear and cytoplasmic subcellular compartments. Remarkably, the presence of TREX1 in the nucleus requires the loss of a C-terminal segment, which we named leucine-rich repeat 3. Furthermore, we detected the presence of a conserved proline-rich region on the surface of TREX1. This observation points to interactions with proline-binding domains. The potential interacting motif “PPPVPRPP” does not contain aromatic residues and thus resembles other sequences that select SH3 and/or Group 2 WW domains. By means of nuclear magnetic resonance titration experiments, we show that, indeed, a polyproline peptide derived from the murine TREX1 sequence interacted with the WW2 domain of the elongation transcription factor CA150. Co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed this interaction with the full-length TREX1 protein, thereby suggesting that TREX1 participates in more functional complexes than previously thought.

When DNA replicates, recombines, or is repaired, its ends often require remodeling to prevent the formation of aberrant structures, which might result in serious cell dysfunctions. Among these DNA remodeling enzymes the 3′ → 5′ exonucleases act by removing nucleotides at the 3′ termini and were initially found to perform proofreading functions associated with DNA polymerases. However, in the last few years, several eukaryotic 3′ → 5′ exonucleases with functions unrelated to proofreading activities have been reported. Alterations in the genes encoding these autonomous exonucleases lead to dramatic consequences, such as strong mutator phenotypes, premature aging, susceptibility to cancer, and even lack of viability (1Shevelev I.V. Ramadan K. Hubscher U. Scientific World J. 2002; 2: 275Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Despite unquestionable evidence about the in vivo importance of autonomous exonucleases, the molecular mechanisms and biological roles of these enzymes are only now beginning to be elucidated.

Biophys. 1999; 30: 331-352Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TREX1 is the most abundant mammalian 3′ → 5′ exonuclease. The inactivation of the Trex1 gene in mice revealed the relevance of this exonuclease. Trex1 knock-out mice develop inflammatory myocarditis, resulting in progressive cardiomyopathy that leads to circulatory failure and a dramatic reduction in survival (5Morita M. Stamp G. Robins P. Dulic A. Rosewell I. Hrivnak G. Daly G. Lindahl T. Barnes D.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2004; 24: 6719-6727Crossref PubMed Scopus (271) Google Scholar). Recently, TREX1 has been implicated in the Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, a severe neurological brain disease that mimics a viral infection acquired in the uterus (6Crow Y.J. Hayward B.E. Parmar R. Robins P. Leitch A. Ali M. Black D.N. van Bokhoven H. Brunner H.G. Hamel B.C. Corry P.C. Cowan F.M. Frints S.G. Klepper J. Livingston J.H. Lynch S.A. Massey R.F. Meritet J.F. Michaud J.L. Ponsot G. Voit T. Lebon P. Bonthron D.T. Jackson A.P. Barnes D.E. Lindahl T. Nat. Genet. 2006; 38: 917-920Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). TREX1, together with some members of the SET complex, has recently been implicated in DNA degradation during granzyme A-mediated cell death (7Chowdhury D. Beresford P.J. Zhu P. Zhang D. Sung J.S. Demple B. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Given that TREX1 is an autonomous non-processive robust exonuclease, several biological roles have been proposed for this enzyme, including participation in proofreading functions. In fact, in reconstituted systems with exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerases, TREX1 shows 3′-editing activity, in particular for (i) the nuclease-deficient replicative DNA polymerase α (3Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), (ii) the repair DNA polymerase β (8Hoss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), and (iii) the DNA lesion bypass polymerase η (9Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2317-2320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Similar activity has been observed for the closely related TREX2, which interacts with the exonuclease-deficient DNA polymerase δ, thereby increasing its fidelity under adverse conditions (1Shevelev I.V. Ramadan K. Hubscher U. Scientific World J. 2002; 2: 275Crossref Scopus (20) Google Scholar). On the basis of its sequence, TREX1 has been classified as a member of the 3′ → 5′ exonuclease family DnaQ. This family includes the proofreading exonuclease fragments Klenow of polymerase I and ɛ186 of polymerase III in Escherichia coli and is characterized by the presence of four non-contiguous acidic residues, three aspartates, and one glutamate, which play a crucial role by binding the two catalytic metal ions (10Derbyshire V. Pinsonneault J.K. Joyce C.M. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 363-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). A fifth residue, either a tyrosine or a histidine, completes the family catalytic motif (represented as DEDDy or DEDDh, respectively) distributed among three separate sequence segments named Exo I, II, and III (11Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The information available to date indicates that the structure is well preserved among DnaQ family members, although some have very low sequence similarities outside the Exo segments (11Moser M.J. Holley W.R. Chatterjee A. Mian I.S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 5110-5118Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar, 12Zuo Y. Deutscher M.P. Nucleic Acids Res. 2001; 29: 1017-1026Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). Members of the family are monomeric, except for TREX1 and TREX2 proteins, which are the only DnaQ deoxyribonucleases characterized as dimers (13Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17022-17029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TREX2 is the only known homologue of TREX1 in mammals (44% sequence identity). TREX-related proteins have been identified in a number of insects and in baculovirus (14Yang D.H. de Jong J.G. Makhmoudova A. Arif B.M. Krell P.J. J. Gen. Virol. 2004; 85: 3569-3573Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar) but no homologous genes have been found in yeast. During the submission of this article, a complementary work showing the structure of TREX1 has been reported providing the molecular basis for understanding the mutations that lead to Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (15de Silva U. Choudhury S. Bailey S.L. Harvey S. Perrino F.W. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2007; 10.1074/jbcM700039200Google Scholar). To better understand the relationship between the structure and function of TREX1, we determined the crystal structures of the binary complexes with a nucleotide product of the exonuclease reaction and with a single-stranded DNA substrate, which we identified using binding site selection experiments. By means of nuclear magnetic resonance experiments, we demonstrated that a group 2 WW domain can interact with a peptide selected from the polyproline-rich region in TREX1. In addition, using confocal microscopy, we also analyzed the role of the C-terminal region in regulating the subcellular localization of the TREX1 protein. To our knowledge, TREX1 interaction with its substrate (DNA) and with its product (single nucleotide) represents the only structures of these complexes described to date from a mammalian deoxyribonuclease of the DnaQ family. Protein Preparation—A murine Trex1 cDNA construct (residues 9-245) was cloned into the expression vector pETM-10 (pETM-10-Trex1). The protein was overexpressed in the E. coli strain Rosetta (DE3) (Novagen) by adding 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at a A595 = 0.6 and culturing the cells overnight at 15 °C. Pelleted cells were resuspended in buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 10 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 8% glycerol. A cell lysate was obtained after mechanical lysis using a French Press. The protein was affinity purified from the supernatant of the cell lysate by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose resin (Qiagen), with an elution buffer containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 200 mm imidazole, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 8% glycerol, and a second purification step was carried out by a Superdex-75 gel filtration column (GE Healthcare), in a Tris-based buffer (30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol). The purified protein was concentrated to 7 mg/ml in the same buffer using Centricon centrifugal filter units (Millipore). The cDNA for the mutant Trex1 H195A was produced from the pETM-10-TREX1 vector, using a PCR site-directed mutagenesis strategy with the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), and the mutant protein was purified by the same protocol. Crystallization, Data Collection, and Structure Refinement—Purified TREX1 protein solution was mixed with 2 mm dTMP, left overnight at 4 °C and used for crystallization. 1 μl of this solution was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (22% PEG3350, 100 mm MES, 2The abbreviations used are: MES, 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid; dTMP, deoxythimidine monophosphate; EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein; LRR3, leucine-rich repeat 3; MBP, maltose-binding protein; PPII, polyproline type II helix conformation; HPLC, high pressure liquid chromatography; SH3, Src homology domain 3. pH 6.0, 200 mm Li2SO4) and crystallization was carried out by the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. Single crystals were soaked for 24 h in the same crystallization solution, except that it contained 200 mm MgSO4 and 50 mm Li2SO4. Crystals were then flash-frozen with 30% ethylene glycol as cryoprotectant. For the complex with DNA, a 25-mer single-stranded oligonucleotide was used (5′-GCTAGGCAGGAACCCCTCCTCCCCT-3′, derived from a binding site selection technique). It was mixed with the purified protein at stoichiometric concentrations and incubated overnight at 4 °C. 1 μl of this preparation was mixed with 1 μl of reservoir solution (20% PEG2KMME, 100 mm imidazole, pH 6.5, 300 mm Li2SO4) and crystallized at 20 °C. These crystals were cross-linked with 25% glutaraldehyde for 30 min and then frozen with 28% glycerol as cryoprotectant. Diffraction data were collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France), and processed using DENZO and SCALE-PACK (16Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref Scopus (38253) Google Scholar). A first model was obtained for TREX1-dTMP by molecular replacement from the structure of the TREX2 protein (17Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), and the model was completed and refined using the CCP4 package and manually refined with the graphic programs Turbo and Coot. Residues 166-174 were disordered and were therefore excluded from the model. The first model for TREX1-DNA was obtained by molecular replacement from the TREX1-dTMP structure, and the model was refined by the same method. The disordered loop in TREX1-DNA was partially resolved. Crystallographic data collection, processing, and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. Structure representations were made with Pymol, and electrostatic potential surfaces were calculated with GRASP.TABLE 1Data collection, structure solution, and refinement statisticsTREX1-nucleotideTREX1-DNAData collectionSpace groupP21P43212Cell parametersa, b, c (Aå)67.18, 81.46, 93.1380.76, 80.76, 171.22α, β, γ (°)90, 103.22, 9090, 90, 90Resolution limits (Aå)30.0-2.3525.0-3.5Multiplicity3.9 (3.9)6.9 (6.0)Number of unique reflections40,389 (4,047)6,708 (623)Completeness (%)98.2 (87.6)87.9 (83.6)Average 1/σ (I)10.0 (3.7)3.7 (1.1)Rsym (%)6.8 (23.2)15.6 (44.0)Crystallographic refinementResolution range (Aå)30.0-2.35 (2.41-2.35)24.85-3.5 (3.59-3.5)R factor20.33 (21.2)24.33 (29.6)Rfree factor25.46 (33.4)28.34 (35.7)Number of reflections38,687 (2,870)6,402 (321)Final model parametersNumber of monomers42Residues (each monomer)217218Hetero groups (each monomer)2 Magnesium ions 1 dTMP4-mer ssDNANumber of water molecules1870Average B-factor, protein (Aå2)19.996.2Average B-factor, water molecules (Aå2)25.6Root mean square deviationCovalent bond lengths (Aå)0.0100.005Bond angles (°)1.361.007Quiral centers (°)0.0740.050 Open table in a new tab NMR Experiments—A DNA fragment encoding the WW2 motif of mouse CA150 (corresponding to residues 442-479) was produced as described (18Macias M.J. Gervais V. Civera C. Oschkinat H. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). This domain is the same as that of FBP28_WW2, and shares the same amino acid sequence in human and mouse. NMR samples of the WW2 domain had a concentration of ∼0.2 mm for structure determination and were dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate buffer, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm NaN3, and 10% D2O at pH 6.0. For binding studies (or titrations) synthetic peptides corresponding to the prolinerich sequence of murine TREX1 (HPPPVPRPPRV) and human TREX1 (PPPTVPPPPRV) were synthesized in-house using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) strategy with a rink-amide matrix (Novabiochem). The final peptides were cleaved with 95% trifluoroacetic acid and 5% H2O and then precipitated in cold ether. The crude material was purified by preparative HPLC using a C18 column to 90% purity (as characterized by HPLC-mass spectrometry). For the binding studies, we titrated the CA150_WW2 domain with increasing amounts of TREX1-derived peptides. Peptide was added to the 15N-labeled CA150_WW2 up to a molar peptide:protein ratio of ∼9:1. The NMR data corresponding to the titration were acquired on a Bruker DRX-800 NMR spectrometer at 285 K. Protein assignment was performed using published homonuclear data as the starting point. The same experiment was carried out with the human and murine TREX1 proline-rich peptides. Co-immunoprecipitation—Cell extracts were prepared as described (19Xaus J. Cardo M. Valledor A.F. Soler C. Lloberas J. Celada A. Immunity. 1999; 11: 103-113Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar), mixed with pre-immune or CA150-specific antiserum and TrueBlot anti-rabbit Ig IP Beads (eBioscience) overnight at 4 °C. After three washes, Western blotting was performed with primary antibodies (CA150 or TREX1 specific serums) and secondary antibody (Rabbit ExactaCruz, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Binding Site Selection—The binding site selection was made as described (20Tang W. Perry S.E. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28154-28159Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Trex1 was cloned into pMal-C2 vector (Promega), and overexpressed in E. coli XL1Blue cells. After lysis, proteins were purified by an amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Maltose-binding protein (MBP) was prepared with the same protocol and used for controls. Randomized oligonucleotides (5′-CGACTCTAGAGGATCC(N)24GAATTCAAGCTTCACG-3′) were made double-stranded using Taq polymerase and [α-32P]dCTP. The probes (200,000 cpm) were used for electrophoretic mobility shift assay with 2-0.5 μg of MBP-TREX1. The purified DNA was PCR amplified with [α-32P]dCTP (primers: 5′-CGACTCTAGAGGATCC-3′, 5′-CGTGAAGCTTGAATTC-3′). The recovered DNA was used in 3 subsequent rounds and the affinity-selected oligonucleotides were cloned into a pCR2.1 vector (Invitrogen). Positive clones were sequenced, the sequences were aligned using DNAStar and the consensus sequences were derived after analysis. SYBR Green-based Exonuclease Activity Assay—Exonuclease reactions were performed in a 96-well plate. First, 10× the indicated double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide (50 μm) was incubated with 10× SYBR Green (Invitrogen), heated for 10 min at 95 °C, and left for 30 min at room temperature so as to anneal the DNA probe and allow the SYBR Green to incorporate into the DNA. For each well, the reaction mixture was prepared in a final volume of 14 μl containing 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 5 mm MgCl2, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 1 ng of MBP-TREX1. 3 μl of the SYBR Green/DNA mixture was then added to the wall of each well and, after a spin of the plate, the reaction was real time followed with an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems) (program: 25 °C for 5 min, 25 °C for 1 min for 90 times, and 4 °C for 2 min). TREX1 dilutions were prepared at 4 °C in 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin. Each DNA probe was annealed with its complementary oligonucleotide by heating at 95 °C for 10 min. Subcellular Localization Experiments—A20 cells were permeabilized with 0,2% Triton X-100. After blocking with 3% bovine serum albumin in Tris-buffered saline, samples were incubated with TREX1 antiserum and secondary antibody (Cy3-Goat anti-rabbit IgG, Amersham Biosciences). DNA was labeled with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). Several Trex1 cDNA constructs were cloned into a pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) and transfected into the murine fibroblast cell line L929: pEGFP-Trex1 wt (residues 1-314), pEGFP-Trex1Δ1 (42-314), pEGFP-Trex1Δ12 (85-314), pEGFP-Trex1Δ123 (85-280), and pEGFP-Trex1Δ3 (1-280). Empty pEGFP-N3 was used as control (EGFP alone). 100,000 cells were plated into each well of a 24-well plate with each well containing a coverslip. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 1 μg of each construct using the transfection kit Lipofectamine™ 2000 (Invitrogen), following the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were incubated for 24 h more, fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde, and visualized by confocal microscopy. The Optimal DNA Sequences That Bound to TREX1 Correlate with the Exonuclease Activity—TREX1 was initially cloned by exploiting its capacity to recognize a given DNA motif (21Klemsz M.J. McKercher S.R. Celada A. Van Beveren C. Maki R.A. Cell. 1990; 61: 113-124Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (754) Google Scholar). To further explore whether TREX1 displays DNA-binding specificity or selectivity toward certain motifs, we used the PCR binding site selection method (22Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar). We thus generated a pool of degenerated oligonucleotides and performed binding selection cycles with recombinant TREX1 protein. Three sets of oligonucleotide sequences were selected by the protein: in 26% of the cases the consensus showed GAG (sequence A), in 25% ACA (B), and in 18% CTGC (C). To examine the potential preference of TREX1 for these sequences, we performed binding assays by incubating the probes (oligonucleotides containing each of the three motifs in tandem) with increasing amounts of protein. Binding was detected by gel retardations. Under these experimental conditions, the affinity differed depending on the DNA sequence (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, when we replaced the Gly by Cys in motif A, binding was abolished. To correlate the binding with the functional activity of TREX1, we also performed a sensitive and quantitative exonuclease activity test, using SYBR Green as indicator. Detection was made by a real time PCR assay (Fig. 1B). We found a clear correlation between binding and exonuclease activity of TREX1. This observation indicates that the specificity of TREX1 for some sequences is correlated with its functional activity, a new feature in the field of deoxyribonucleases. Regions Responsible for TREX1 Nucleus-Cytoplasm Localization—TREX1 is involved in the SET complex that degrades DNA during granzyme A-mediated cell death. This observation implies an initial cytoplasmic localization for the protein and a stimulus-mediated translocation to the nucleus (7Chowdhury D. Beresford P.J. Zhu P. Zhang D. Sung J.S. Demple B. Perrino F.W. Lieberman J. Mol. Cell. 2006; 23: 133-142Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). The observation that TREX1 binds proteins involved in nucleic acid polymerization (3Perrino F.W. Miller H. Ealey K.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16357-16363Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 8Hoss M. Robins P. Naven T.J. Pappin D.J. Sgouros J. Lindahl T. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3868-3875Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 9Bebenek K. Matsuda T. Masutani C. Hanaoka F. Kunkel T.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 2317-2320Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) suggests that TREX1 is involved in a range of activities in the cell nucleus. In fact, when we localized TREX1 using polyclonal antibodies we found that present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). Both TREX proteins contain a pair of leucine-rich repeats at their N termini, which in TREX2 were incorporated in the protein fold. However, TREX1 contains a highly hydrophobic C-terminal region, absent in TREX2, which we named leucine-rich repeat 3 (LRR3). Indeed, bioinformatic tools predict that this region forms a putative transmembrane helix (supplemental Fig. S1). Furthermore, protein constructs lacking the LRR3 region were expressed in the soluble fractions and in higher amounts than the full-length protein. In addition, the TREX1 construct lacking the LRR3 segment maintained full catalytic capacity because it was able to bind and degrade DNA (supplemental Fig. S2). On the basis of these observations, we hypothesized that this region influences the subcellular localization of TREX1 in vivo. To test this hypothesis, cDNAs coding for distinct fragments of TREX1 were cloned in an expression vector fused to enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP). Four fragments were prepared, TREX1Δ1, TREX1Δ12, TREX1Δ123, and TREX1Δ3 (Fig. 2B). L929 fibroblasts were transfected with these constructs, and subcellular localization of the fusion proteins was visualized by confocal microscopy. Results showed that the entire TREX1 protein was located in the cytoplasm. The protein translocated to the nucleus when it lacked the LRR3 at the C terminus (TREX1Δ3 and TREX1Δ123), but not when it lacked any other region (TREX1Δ1 and TREX1Δ12). The pEGFP control (empty vector pEGFP-N3) showed the typical nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution for the EGFP protein. These results indicate that the LRR3 region is involved in the nucleus-cytoplasm localization of TREX1. Furthermore, TREX1Δ3 and TREX1Δ123 fused to two EGFPs presented the same nuclear localization pattern as when fused to a single EGFP. These observations discard the possibility that the nuclear localization was caused by passive transport (data not shown). Second, Trex1 wt cloned into a pEGFP-C1 vector, where TREX1 is at the C terminus of the EGFP, showed the same localization pattern as when cloned into pEGFP-N3, thereby demonstrating that the position of the EGFP does not determine the localization of the fusion protein (Data not shown). Thus our data showed that the presence of the C-terminal LRR3 region of TREX1 is involved in cytoplasmic retention of the protein and its elimination allows the protein to be translocated to the nucleus. On the basis of the data obtained from the solubility and localization experiments and also from the DNA selection technique, we designed a number of oligonucleotides and prepared several TREX1 constructs and mixtures with DNA, which were later used for crystallization trials. The mixtures contained either double-stranded or single-stranded DNAs corresponding to both the forward and reverse sequence of each oligonucleotide selected. In parallel, trials with 2 mm deoxythymidine 5′-monophosphate (dTMP) were also attempted. TREX1 Overall Structure—Despite a huge number of trials, only one construct lacking the LRR3 segment was crystallized. The protein crystals belong to space group P21, and the asymmetric unit contains four protein subunits organized as two molecular dimers, two magnesium ions, and a dTMP molecule per active center. This is consistent with the results obtained for the protein in solution (13Mazur D.J. Perrino F.W. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 17022-17029Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) (supplemental Fig. S3). The final model was refined at 2.35-Aå resolution (Table 1) and includes 190 solvent molecules. Both the global structure and the dimeric molecular organization of TREX1 are closely related to those in TREX2 (about 40% sequence identity) (17Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Despite low sequence identity with respect to monomeric exonucleases of the DnaQ family, such as the Klenow fragment of E. coli DNA polymerase I (about 20%) (23Shevelev I.V. Hubscher U. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 3: 364-376Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar), their overall fold is quite conserved. TREX subunits consist of a central five-stranded anti-parallel β-sheet surrounded by nine α-helices (Fig. 3A). The structures of the four subunits are very similar, with an averaged root mean square deviation between Cα atoms of 0.32 Aå. The sheet extends throughout the molecular 2-fold axis to the second subunit in the molecule, thereby giving a continuous 10-stranded anti-parallel sheet. Both polar and hydrophobic interactions act between monomers, mainly because of residues from the β3 strand and the α4 helix. TREX1 has a proline-rich segment (residues 54-63), which is absent in TREX2. This segment is located on the protein surface not far from the molecular 2-fold axis (closest distance 10.19 Aå, from Cα of Pro60) and adopts a polyproline type II helix conformation (PPII). There is a disordered segment in TREX1 adjacent to the active site (residues 166-174). The corresponding loop in TREX2, also disordered, appears to play an important role in DNA binding (17Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Overall, the main differences between the two TREX structures are the additional helix α1 and a long loop, which, in TREX1, corresponds to residues 47-65 including the proline-rich segment (Fig. 3B). Active Site—The electron density map confirmed the binding to each protein subunit of one dTMP nucleotide and two magnesium ions (named MgA and MgB), defining an active site located away from the molecular 2-fold axis, in agreement with what was proposed for TREX2 (17Perrino F.W. Harvey S. McMillin S. Hollis T. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 15212-15218Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3A). The dTMP molecule would correspond to the product of the exonuclease reaction that remains bound by hydrophobic and hydrogen-bond interactions with the protein and also by interactions with magnesium ions. MgA, with an approximate trigonal bipyramidal geometry, coordinates with oxygen molecules O2P and O3P from the dTMP phosphate group and with the carboxylate oxygen molecules from Asp18, Glu20, and Asp200. In turn, MgB, with nearly perfect octahedral geometry, coordinates with the dTMP oxygen O3P, with the second carboxylate oxygen from Asp18 and with four molecules of water, one of them hydrogen-bonded to th"
https://openalex.org/W2088515517,"Excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in smooth and cardiac muscles is mediated by the L-type Ca2+ channel isoform Cav1.2 and the ryanodine receptor isoform RyR2. Although physical coupling between Cav1.1 and RyR1 in skeletal muscle is well established, it is generally assumed that Cav1.2 and RyR2 do not directly communicate either passively or dynamically during E-C coupling. In the present work, we re-examined this assumption by studying E-C coupling in the detrusor muscle of wild type and Homer1-/- mice and by demonstrating a Homer1-mediated dynamic interaction between Cav1.2 and RyR2 using the split green fluorescent protein technique. Deletion of Homer1 in mice (but not of Homer2 or Homer3) resulted in impaired urinary bladder function, which was associated with higher sensitivity of the detrusor muscle to muscarinic stimulation and membrane depolarization. This was not due to an altered expression or function of RyR2 and Cav1.2. Most notably, expression of Cav1.2 and RyR2 tagged with the complementary C- and N-terminal halves of green fluorescent protein and in the presence and absence of Homer1 isoforms revealed that H1a and H1b/c reciprocally modulates a dynamic interaction between Cav1.2 and RyR2 to regulate the intensity of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and its dependence on membrane depolarization. These findings define the molecular basis of a “two-state” model of E-C coupling by Cav1.2 and RyR2. In one state, Cav1.2 couples to RyR2 by H1b/c, which results in reduced responsiveness to membrane depolarization and in the other state H1a uncouples Cav1.2 and RyR2 to enhance responsiveness to membrane depolarization. These findings reveal an unexpected and novel mode of interaction and communication between Cav1.2 and RyR2 with important implications for the regulation of smooth and possibly cardiac muscle E-C coupling. Excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling and Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release in smooth and cardiac muscles is mediated by the L-type Ca2+ channel isoform Cav1.2 and the ryanodine receptor isoform RyR2. Although physical coupling between Cav1.1 and RyR1 in skeletal muscle is well established, it is generally assumed that Cav1.2 and RyR2 do not directly communicate either passively or dynamically during E-C coupling. In the present work, we re-examined this assumption by studying E-C coupling in the detrusor muscle of wild type and Homer1-/- mice and by demonstrating a Homer1-mediated dynamic interaction between Cav1.2 and RyR2 using the split green fluorescent protein technique. Deletion of Homer1 in mice (but not of Homer2 or Homer3) resulted in impaired urinary bladder function, which was associated with higher sensitivity of the detrusor muscle to muscarinic stimulation and membrane depolarization. This was not due to an altered expression or function of RyR2 and Cav1.2. Most notably, expression of Cav1.2 and RyR2 tagged with the complementary C- and N-terminal halves of green fluorescent protein and in the presence and absence of Homer1 isoforms revealed that H1a and H1b/c reciprocally modulates a dynamic interaction between Cav1.2 and RyR2 to regulate the intensity of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release and its dependence on membrane depolarization. These findings define the molecular basis of a “two-state” model of E-C coupling by Cav1.2 and RyR2. In one state, Cav1.2 couples to RyR2 by H1b/c, which results in reduced responsiveness to membrane depolarization and in the other state H1a uncouples Cav1.2 and RyR2 to enhance responsiveness to membrane depolarization. These findings reveal an unexpected and novel mode of interaction and communication between Cav1.2 and RyR2 with important implications for the regulation of smooth and possibly cardiac muscle E-C coupling. The Homer family of scaffolding proteins consists of three members, Homer1, Homer2, and Homer3, and several splice variants (1Szumlinski K.K. Kalivas P.W. Worley P.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Homers are typified by an N-terminal Ena/VASP homology 1 (EVH) 3The abbreviations used are: EVH, Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1; E-C, excitation-contraction; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; RyR2, ryanodine receptor type 2; [Ca2+]i, free intracellular Ca2+ concentration; HEK, human embryonic kidney; H1a, Homer1a; H1b/c, Homer1b/c; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; WT, wild type; DSM, detrusor smooth muscle; IP3R, IP3 receptor. 3The abbreviations used are: EVH, Ena/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein homology 1; E-C, excitation-contraction; CICR, Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release; RyR2, ryanodine receptor type 2; [Ca2+]i, free intracellular Ca2+ concentration; HEK, human embryonic kidney; H1a, Homer1a; H1b/c, Homer1b/c; GFP, green fluorescent protein; TRPC, canonical transient receptor potential; IP3, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate; WT, wild type; DSM, detrusor smooth muscle; IP3R, IP3 receptor. domain and C-terminal coiled coil and leucine zipper domains. The EVH domain is a protein-protein binding module that recognizes the proline-rich motifs PPXXF, PPXF, and LPSSP (2Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Muallem S. Worley P.F. Cell. 2003; 114: 777-789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), whereas the coiled coil domain and leucine zippers serve to multimerize the Homers into scaffolds that assemble signaling proteins into complexes (1Szumlinski K.K. Kalivas P.W. Worley P.F. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 2006; 16: 251-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). The Homer1 gene is unique in that it codes for the short Homer1a (H1a) and a long Homer1b/c (H1b/c) (3Fagni L. Worley P.F. Ango F. Science's STKE 2002. 2002; 137: RE8Google Scholar). H1a lacks the coiled coil domain and leucine zipper, and it antagonizes the functions of the multimerizing Homers by dissociating the complexes formed by them.Many Ca2+ signaling proteins express Homer binding sequences, including G protein-coupled receptors, plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase pumps, IP3 receptors, canonical transient receptor potential (TRPC) channels, and notably, the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) and the α1C subunit of Cav1.2 and α1D subunit of Cav1.3 L-type Ca2+ channels (1Szumlinski K.K.

The Homers recruit the Ca2+ signaling proteins to the plasma membrane (8Kammermeier P.J. BMC Neurosci. 2006; 7: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar) and cellular microdomains, such as dendritic spines (9Sala C. Roussignol G. Meldolesi J. Fagni L. J.

On the other hand, the Homers modulate the efficiency (2Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H. Muallem S. Worley P.F.

Worley P.F. Muallem S. J. Cell Biol. 2003; 162: 293-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) by negatively regulating the activity of proteins within the Ca2+ signaling complex.Another important function of Homer1 is the mediation of the conformational coupling between IP3Rs and TRPC channels. Thus, Homer1 binds TRPC channels and the IP3Rs to allow the gating of TRPC channels by IP3Rs (2Yuan J.P. Kiselyov K. Shin D.M. Chen J. Shcheynikov N. Kang S.H. Dehoff M.H. Schwarz M.K. Seeburg P.H.

Pfluegers Arch. 2005; 451: 116-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). This form of coupling is reminiscent of excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling in muscle, which is mediated by the sarcolemmal voltage-activated L-type Ca2+ channels and the RyRs Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (12Franzini-Armstrong C. Biol. Res. 2004; 37: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Marks A.R. Annu. Rev.

Homer1 may play a role in E-C coupling, because it was reported to activate the skeletal and cardiac muscle RyR isoforms RyR1 (15Feng W. Tu J. Yang T. Vernon P.S. Allen P.D. Worley P.F. Pessah I.N.

Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar), respectively. Furthermore, recently it was suggested that the short, dissociating H1a activates L-type Ca2+ current in neocortex pyramidal cells (19Yamamoto K. Sakagami Y. Sugiura S. Inokuchi K. Shimohama S. Kato N. Eur. J. Neurosci. 2005; 22: 1338-1348Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).There are three forms of E-C coupling, depending on muscle type (12Franzini-Armstrong C. Biol. Res. 2004; 37: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Marks A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 69-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 14Kotlikoff M.I. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Skeletal muscle displays mechanical coupling between the skeletal muscle L-type Ca2+ channel isoform Cav1.1 and RyR1, whereby the Ca2+ release units are organized in tetrads mediated by physical interaction between the cytosolic domains of RyR1 and Cav1.1 (12Franzini-Armstrong C. Biol. Res. 2004; 37: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The activating depolarization is sensed by Cav1.1 and is directly conveyed to RyR1 to initiate Ca2+ release that then propagates by a Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (CICR) mechanism. In cardiac muscle, RyR2 communicates with the cardiac muscle L-type Ca2+ channel Cav1.2, but the channels do not physically interact. CICR is initiated by Ca2+ influx through Cav1.2 that then activates RyR2 (13Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Marks A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 69-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). However, at the cardiac Ca2+ release units, RyR2 and Cav1.2 are in close proximity, and Ca2+ entering through Cav1.2 is rapidly sensed by RyR2 (12Franzini-Armstrong C. Biol. Res. 2004; 37: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Marks A.R. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 2005; 67: 69-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar). Although all RyR isoforms were reported to be expressed in smooth muscle, RyR2 is the major isoform in this muscle type (20Wray S. Burdyga T. Noble K. Cell Calcium. 2005; 38: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar), including the urinary bladder detrusor muscle (21Ji G. Feldman M.E. Greene K.S. Sorrentino V. Xin H.B. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Ca2+ influx during E-C coupling of smooth muscle is mediated by Cav1.2 (22Wegener J.W. Schulla V. Lee T.S. Koller A. Feil S. Feil R. Kleppisch T. Klugbauer N. Moosmang S. Welling A. Hofmann F. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1159-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). However, E-C coupling in smooth muscle was termed loose coupling (14Kotlikoff M.I. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 2003; 83: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) based on the relatively slow rate of activation of CICR (23Collier M.L. Ji G. Wang Y. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 653-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar).The properties of E-C coupling and CICR in cardiac and smooth muscles led to the belief that Cav1.2 and RyR2 do not directly communicate either passively or dynamically during E-C coupling (12Franzini-Armstrong C. Biol. Res. 2004; 37: 507-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar, 13Wehrens X.H. Lehnart S.E. Marks A.R. Annu. Rev.

Protasi F. Franzini-Armstrong C. Allen P.D. Beam K.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 1019-1022Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). We re-examined this assumption by studying E-C coupling in the detrusor muscle of wild type (WT) and Homer1-/- mice and by demonstrating a Homer1-mediated interaction between RyR2 and Cav1.2 using the split GFP technique. We report that Homer1 modulates a dynamic interaction between Cav1.2 and RyR2 to regulate the intensity of CICR and its dependence on membrane depolarization. These findings define the molecular basis of a “two-state” model of E-C coupling by Cav1.2 and RyR2. In one state, Cav1.2 couples to RyR2 by H1b/c, which results in reduced responsiveness to membrane depolarization, and in the other state, H1a uncouples Cav1.2 and RyR2 to enhance responsiveness to membrane depolarization. These novel forms of interaction between RyR2 and Cav1.2 have important implications for smooth and possibly cardiac muscle E-C coupling.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials and Solutions—Fura-2/AM and Fluo-3/AM were from Teff Laboratories, Inc., Indo1 was from Molecular Probes, anti-α1C subunit of Cav1.2 antibodies were from Alomone, and anti-RyR2 antibodies C3-33 were from Sigma. The standard bath solution A contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 1 CaCl2, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4 with NaOH), and 10 glucose. The standard solution B used for experiments with muscle strips and cells contained (in mm) 120.5 NaCl, 4.8 KCl, 1.2 MgSO4, 1.2 NaH2PO4, 20.4 NaHCO3, 1.6 CaCl2, and 10 glucose, pH 7.4. High K+ solutions were prepared by isosmotic replacement of NaCl with KCl. The α1C, β, and α2δ plasmids were generously provided by Dr. Ilya Bezprozvanny (Department of Physiology, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center), and the RyR2 plasmid was generously provided by Dr. Andrew Marks (Department of Physiology, Columbia University).Transfection—Human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were seeded in a 6-well plate at the density of 0.3 × 106 cells/well on the day before transfection using the Lipofectamine and Plus reagents with 1 μg of DNA/well, in a ratio of 2:1:1:2:4 (α1C: β:α2δ: RyR2:empty vector/H1a/H1b/c).Western Blot Analysis and Co-immunoprecipitation—Microsomes were prepared by homogenization in a buffer containing (in mm) 250 sucrose, 10 HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 EDTA, 1 dithiothreitol, and 0.2 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatants were collected and centrifuged at 40,000 × g for 20 min. The pellets were suspended in lysis buffer composed of (in mm) 50 Tris (pH 6.8 with HCl), 150 NaCl, 2 EDTA, 2 EGTA, and 1% Triton X-100 supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.2 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/μl leupeptin, 15 μg/μl aptotinin, 1 mm benzamidine) and extracted by a 1-h incubation on ice. The lysate was centrifuged to remove insoluble material and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.For the co-immunoprecipitation experiments, 150-μl extracts prepared from transfected HEK cells, as described above, were incubated with 5 μl of anti-α1C antibodies overnight at 4 °C under gentle agitation. The immune complexes were collected with 30 μl of a 1:1 goat anti-IgY antibody-conjugated microbead slurry and were incubated for an additional 2 h at 4 °C. The beads were collected, washed three times with lysis buffer, and the precipitates were probed for H1b/c.Animals—All experiments with mice have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center and adhere to National Institutes of Health guidelines.Assay of Urinary Bladder Continence—Bio-Rad filter paper sheets (Model 583) were placed over fresh cage bedding material, and the mice were placed over the filter papers while having free access to water and food. After 2 h, the filter papers were collected and the urine spots were counted under UV light.Preparation of Detrusor Smooth Muscle (DSM) Cells and Strips—DSM cells and strips were prepared as described previously (25Huang G. Yao J. Zeng W. Mizuno Y. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Harding H.P. Ron D. Muallem S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 26Isotani E. Zhi G. Lau K.S. Huang J. Mizuno Y. Persechini A. Geguchadze R. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 6279-6284Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In brief, the bladder was excised into solution B, and the urothelium was dissected away. DSM cells were prepared by mincing the muscle and incubation for 20 min at 37 °C in 5 ml of solution B containing 1 mg/ml papain, 1 mg/ml dithiothreitol, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The fragments were washed twice with solution B and incubated at 37 °C for 10 min with 5 ml of solution B containing 1 mg/ml collagenase type 2, 100 μm Ca2+, and 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The tissue was washed, and cells were released by trituration. The cells were collected by passing through 125-μm nylon mesh and were concentrated by centrifugation at 100 × g.DSM strips were prepared by cutting the bladder muscle into three strips of ∼0.5 × 0.5 × 8.0 mm. The strips were stretched (×1.2 slack length), and incubated in the dark with solution B containing 10 μm Indo-1/AM or 10 μm Fura-2/AM, 0.01% pluronic F-127, and 0.02% cremophor for 4 h at room temperature. The strips were then incubated in fresh solution B for 30 min at room temperature to allow completion of dye hydrolysis and used for measurements of [Ca2+]i and force (Indo-1) or [Ca2+]ii only (Fura2).Measurement of Cav1.2 Current in DSM Cells and HEK Cells— The whole-cell current was measured with pipette solution containing (in mm) 140 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 1 MgATP, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.2 with CsOH. The bath solution contained (in mm) 140 NaCl, 10 BaCl2, 4 KCl, and 10 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. When desired, recombinant H1a and H1b/c prepared in MgATP-free pipette solution were diluted into the pipette solution just before use. Cav1.2 current was recorded using Ba2+ as the current carrier to avoid the [Ca2+]i-mediated inhibition of the current. The current was sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. Current/voltage relationships were obtained by holding the membrane potential at -80 mV and stepping at 10-mV intervals for 800 ms to +60 mV. Clampex and Clampfit software were used for data acquisition and analysis.Measurement of [Ca2+]i and Force in Smooth Muscle Strips— Ca2+ and force of muscle strips were measured as described before (25Huang G. Yao J. Zeng W. Mizuno Y. Kamm K.E. Stull J.T. Harding H.P. Ron D. Muallem S. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 153-161Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). In brief, Indo-1-loaded strips were mounted on a force transducer and were illuminated at 365 nm. Emitted light at 405 and 485 nm was used to obtain the 405/485 ratio. When only [Ca2+]i was measured, Fura2-loaded DSM strips were taped onto glass coverslips, and fluorescence was measured by illumination at 350 and 380 nm, and the emitted light was used to calculate the 350/380 ratio.Measurement of [Ca2+]i in HEK Cells—Thirty hours after transfection, the HEK cells were trypsinized and replated onto glass coverslips. After 18 h, the cells were incubated in solution A containing 10 μm Fura-2/AM for 30 min at room temperature. Fluorescence was recorded at an excitation wavelength of 350 and 380 nm, and the emitted light at 500 nm was used to calculate the 350/380 ratio.Preparation of Split GFP-tagged Cav1.2 and RyR2—The α1C was tagged with the C-terminal half of GFP as follows. First, the stop codon of α1C was removed by PCR amplification using the primers 5′-GGGGTACCATGGTCAATGAAAACACGAG-3′ (sense; the underlined region is a KpnI site) and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTCAGGTTGCTGACATAGGAC-3′ (antisense; the underlined region is a NotI site). The bolded base is an insert needed to make the downstream half GFP in-frame with α1C. The PCR product of α1C was cloned into pcDNA3.1(+). Positive clones were confirmed by sequencing and referred as α1CΔS. Thereafter, the C-terminal half of GFP (amino acids 158-237) was amplified using the primers 5′-ATGCGGCCGCGGCGGCAGCGGCAGCGGCAAGAATGGAATCAAAGTTAA-3′ (sense; underlined region is a NotI site, and bolded region is a linker) and 5′-ATGCGGCCGCCTATTTGTATAGTTCATCCA (antisense; underlined region is a NotI site) and inserted into the NotI site of the C-terminal of α1CΔS. Positive clones were confirmed by sequencing and by current measurement.The second half GFP was fused to the N terminus of RyR2 as follows. The N-terminal half GFP (amino acids 1-157) was amplified by the sense primer 5′-ATAGCGGCCGCATGAGTAAAGGAGAAGAAC-3′ and antisense primer 5′-ATGCGGCCGCTGCCGCTGCCGCCTTGTTTGTCTGCCATGATGTAGAC-3′ (the underlined region is a NotI site, and the bolded region is a linker) and inserted into the NotI site of the RyR2 plasmid, which is located upstream of the open reading frame of RyR2. Positive clones were confirmed by sequencing and caffeine-mediated Ca2+ release.Measurement of GFP Fluorescence and [Ca2+]i by Confocal Microscopy—Images were acquired with a Bio-Rad 1024 laser scanning confocal microscope as single images at low rate/high resolution or by continuous monitoring at a resolution of two images/sec (see Fig. 7). For measurement of depolarization-triggered CICR, after monitoring the GFP fluorescence, the cells expressing split GFP-tagged Cav1.2 and RyR2 and H1b/c were loaded with Fluo-3 by incubation with Fluo-3/AM for 20 min at room temperature or until Fluo-3 fluorescence was 20-fold higher than the GFP fluorescence. GFP and Fluo-3 fluorescence was measured using the 488 line of the microscope.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONDeletion of Homer1 Increases Detrusor Muscle Activity—The amino acid sequences 812-817 and 1964-1967 in RyR2 and 1526-1530 in the smooth and cardiac muscle α1C isoform of Cav1.2 are proline-rich, Homer binding consensus sequences, and indeed, RyR2 (18Westhoff J.H. Hwang S.Y. Duncan R.S. Ozawa F. Volpe P. Inokuchi K. Koulen P. Cell Calcium. 2003; 34: 261-269Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and Cav1.2 (see below) bind Homer. Therefore, it was of interest to determine whether the Homers participate in E-C coupling. We followed urinary bladder function, because the detrusor muscle expresses RyR2 (21Ji G. Feldman M.E. Greene K.S. Sorrentino V. Xin H.B. Kotlikoff M.I. J. Gen. Physiol. 2004; 123: 377-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and Cav1.2 (22Wegener J.W. Schulla V. Lee T.S. Koller A. Feil S. Feil R. Kleppisch T. Klugbauer N. Moosmang S. Welling A. Hofmann F. FASEB J. 2004; 18: 1159-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar), and detrusor muscle contraction is mediated by CICR. Fig. 1, A-C, shows measurement of bladder continence as reported by urination patterns of freely moving WT mice and mice from which the Homer1, Homer2, or Homer3 genes were deleted. WT, Homer2-/-, and Homer3-/- mice produced an average of 2.7 ± 0.7, 2.6 ± 0.9, and 6.5 ± 2.6 (n = 3-15, trails) respectively, large and medium urine spots in 2 h. By contrast, the Homer1-/- mice produced 169 ± 42 (n = 18) small urine spots during the same period of time, indicating overactive bladder in the Homer1-/- mice.FIGURE 1Detrusor muscle function in Homer1-/- mice. Urinary bladder continence was assayed by counting urine spots after placing WT (A) or Homer1-/- (B) mice for 2 h in cages lined with filter paper. C summarizes the results obtained with WT (n = 15), Homer1-/- (n = 9), Homer2-/- (n = 4), and Homer3-/- mice (n = 3). D, sample traces of simultaneous measurement of peak [Ca2+]i and force in response to the stimulation of the detrusor muscles from WT mice with 10 μm carbachol. The dose response for carbachol-stimulated [Ca2+]i (E) and force (F) was measured in detrusor muscle strips from four WT and four Homer1-/- mice. Two strips were used from each bladder. The same number of mice and strips were used to measure the muscle response to membrane depolarization by elevated K+o (G and H). Results are presented as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Overactive bladder can result from altered detrusor muscle activity and/or altered neuronal control of muscle function, because the L-type Ca2+ channels and the Ca2+ release channels in both cell types can bind Homer. Moreover, deletion of the K+ channel mSlo1 also results in overactive bladder, (27Meredith A.L. Thorneloe K.S. Werner M.E. Nelson M.T. Aldrich R.W. J. Biol.

We consider this unlikely, because mSlo1 does not have a Homer binding ligand. In addition, although the membrane potential in the isolated cells is low because of the extensive collagenase digestion and the trituration needed to isolate the cells, the membrane potential is similar in WT (-17 ± 3.2 mV) and Homer1-/- cells (-16.8 ± 2.8 mV).Because we are interested in muscle E-C coupling, we asked whether deletion of Homer1 affected muscle function independent of neuronal function. Therefore, to test for a specific role of Homer1 in muscle E-C coupling, we measured [Ca2+]i and contraction in isolated, urothelium-free, detrusor muscle strips from WT and Homer1-/- mice. Fig. 1D shows representative traces of Ca2+ and contraction measurements in response to stimulation with 10 μm carbachol of muscle strips from WT mice. The summary in Fig. 1, E and F, shows that deletion of Homer1 results in increased sensitivity of the muscle to stimulation of the muscarinic receptors with carbachol, whereas not affecting the [Ca2+]i or force response to maximal stimulation with 10 μm carbachol. Notably, Fig. 1, G and H, shows that the same effect was observed in response to depolarizing the muscle strips with high extracellular K+ (K+o), indicating that the effect of deletion of Homer1 does not involve specific biochemical pathways stimulated by carbachol but rather involves E-C coupling directly. Moreover, these results indicate that deletion of Homer1 specifically affected muscle function.Deletion of Homer1 Does Not Affect the Activity of RyR2—Increased sensitivity to membrane depolarization in the Homer1-/- mice could result from increased activity of Cav1.2, increased activity of RyR2, or altered coupling between Cav1.2 and RyR2.

These organic anions comprise endogenous as well as exogenous compounds including frequently used drugs of various chemical structures.

Kinetic experiments revealed that chloride did not alter the apparent Km for PAH but influenced Vmax in wild type OAT1-expressing oocytes. In R466K mutants the apparent Km for PAH was similar to that of the wild type, but Vmax was not changed by chloride removal.

Since the organic anion transporters were first cloned in 1997, much work has been done to understand their structure, functioning, and regulation (1Sekine T. Watanabe N. Hosoyamada M. Kanai Y.

Moewes B. Burckhardt G. Am. J. Physiol. 1987; 253: F795-F801PubMed Google Scholar). Located at the basolateral membrane of proximal tubules in the kidneys, OAT1 has been shown to interact with a wide variety of structurally diverse therapeutically important compounds like antivirals, diuretics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (5Burckhardt B.C. Burckhardt G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem. Pharmacol. 2003; 146: 95-158Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). As regards structure-function studies in OAT1, phosphorylation and glycosylation states of the transporter have been shown to be important. Phosphorylation through protein kinase C down-regulated hOAT1 through carrier internalization, but so far no amino acid residue was implicated (6Wolff N.A. Thies K. Kuhnke N. Reid G. Friedrich B. Lang F. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), whereas glycosylation of asparagines in the first large extracellular loop of mouse and human OAT1 is necessary for proper trafficking to the plasma membrane. One of these, Asn39, also plays a role in substrate binding/recognition (7Tanaka K. Xu W. Zhou F. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 14961-14966Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Apart from this an alanine scanning mutagenesis was made in the first transmembrane domain (TMD) of hOAT1 that demonstrated the importance of leucine 30 and threonine 36 for transport (8Hong M. Zhou F. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 31478-31482Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cysteine scanning mutagenesis of mOAT1 revealed that although individual cysteines are not required for transport function, they collectively influence targeting to the plasma membrane (9Tanaka K. Zhou F. Kuze K. You G. Biochem. J. 2004; 380: 283-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Recently it was shown that the C terminus of hOAT1 has two critically important amino acids: the anionic aspartate 506 and Leu512 (10Xu W. Tanaka K. Sun A.Q. You G. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 31178-31183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Asp506 was reported to be important because it may maintain structural integrity through the formation of salt bridges with cationic amino acids elsewhere in the transporter. Because the mutant L512V showed similar Km but reduced Vmax compared with the wild type (wt), it was said to critically affect the turnover of hOAT1. Further amino acid residues that are involved in substrate binding or translocation have been investigated with the flounder OAT1 and mouse OAT3. In the flounder OAT1, it was shown that two nonconservative amino acid mutations K394A and R478D resulted in a loss of interaction with dicarboxylates but not PAH, suggesting that these cationic residues are important for dicarboxylate but not PAH binding (11Wolff N.A. Grunwald B. Friedrich B. Lang F. Godehardt S. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the study by Feng et al. (12Feng B. Dresser M.J. Shu Y. Johns S.J. Giacomini K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5511-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the same corresponding amino acids in mouse OAT3 were mutated. Neutral and opposite charge replacements were made as K370A, R454D, and R454N. All of the mutants showed considerably reduced transport of PAH, estrone sulfate, and ochratoxin A, no transport of the organic cation 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, but uptake of cimetidine similar to that of wild type. Interaction with the counter ion α-ketoglutarate was not tested. Interestingly, although the R454D mutant could not transport 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium, the double mutant R454D/K370A did so in preference to the anion PAH. In this case too, charge-conserving mutations were not made. The present study sought to identify one of the key residues that may be involved in substrate binding and translocation in the human OAT1 with the reasoning that positive charges within the transporter should be involved in substrate binding. Through sequence alignment of all mammalian OATs, we could identify positively charged amino acids that were completely conserved. To narrow down the search, we identified amino acids that were also oppositely charged in the organic cation transporters (OCTs) (13Koepsell H. Endou H. Pfluegers Arch. Eur. J. Physiol. 2004; 447: 666-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). We chose to investigate Arg466 because secondary structure analysis predicted that this residue lies approximately at the center of TMD 11, a segment that is known to be critical for the functioning of hOAT1 (hOAT1–3 and -4 isoforms lacking this TMD are nonfunctional) (14Bahn A. Ebbinghaus C. Ebbinghaus D. Ponimaskin E.G. Füzesi L. Burckhardt G. Hagos Y. Drug. Metab. Dispos. 2004; 32: 424-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and also replaced by an opposite charge in OCT1s. We therefore investigated what effect conservative, i.e. replacing Arg466 with Lys, and then nonconservative, i.e. replacing Arg466 with oppositely charged Asp, mutation would have on the transporter. Chemicals—All of the chemicals were of reagent grade. p-[glycyl-2-3H]Aminohippurate ([3H]PAH), 1–5 Ci/mmol, was obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. [1,5-14C]Glutaric acid (55 mCi/mmol), was obtained from MP Biomedicals (Heidelberg, Germany). [3H(G)]Ochratoxin A (7.2 Ci/mmol) was obtained from Moravek Biochemicals Inc. (Brea, CA). Unlabeled PAH, glutaric acid, adipic acid, and malonic acid and all other chemicals were obtained from Sigma. Site-directed Mutagenesis and Plasmid Constructs—Mutations were created in the hOAT1 clone described previously that had a FLAG epitope in the large first extracellular loop between amino acid residues 107 and 108 (6Wolff N.A. Thies K. Kuhnke N. Reid G. Friedrich B. Lang F. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Mutations were introduced by use of the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, Cambridge, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instructions using two synthetic oligonucleotide primer pairs (sense and antisense) containing the desired mutation (Table 1). The presence of the mutation was confirmed on both strands in each clone by automated DNA sequencing (ABI 377; Applied Biosystems, Weiterstadt, Germany) followed by alignments using online tools (e.g. CustalW).TABLE 1Mutations introduced into hOAT1R466K5′-GGCAGCACCATGGCC (AAA) GTGGGCAGCATCGTG-3′ (sense)5′-CACGATGCTGCCCAC (TTT) GGCCATGGTGCTGCC-3′ (antisense)R466D5′-GGCAGCACCATGGCC (GAC) GTGGGCAGCATCGTG-3′ (sense)5′-CACGATGCTGCCCAC (GTC) GGCCATGGTGCTGCC-3′ (antisense) Open table in a new tab cRNA Transcription, Oocyte Injection, and Transport Experiments—wt and mutant hOAT1 plasmid DNA from the constructs described above were used as templates for respective cRNA synthesis. Plasmids were linearized with NotI, and in vitro cRNA transcription was performed using a T7 mMessage mMachine Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). The resulting cRNAs were resuspended in purified, RNase-free water to a final concentration of 1 μg/μl. Stage V–VI oocytes were defolliculated by overnight incubation at 18 °C with collagenase (0.5 mg/ml, Type CLSII; Biochrom, Berlin, Germany) in oocyte Ringer’s solution (ORI) (90 mm NaCl, 3 mm KCl, 2 mm CaCl2, 1 mm MgCl2, 5 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.6) followed by washing for 10 min in Ca2+-free ORI. Oocytes were then injected with 23 nl of water or 23 ng of cRNA in an equivalent volume. After injection, the oocytes were incubated for 3 days at 18 °C in modified Barth’s solution (88 mm NaCl, 2 mm KCl, 0.82 mm MgSO4, 0.66 mm NaNO3, 0.77 mm CaCl2, 5 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.6) containing 12 μg/ml gentamycin. Uptake of [3H]PAH, [14C]glutarate, or [3H]ochratoxin A was assayed at room temperature (experimental parameters are described in the figure legends) in ORI. FLAG-tagged OAT1 and mutants were used in all of the experiments. The oocytes were then rinsed with ice-cold ORI (3 × 4 ml) and dissolved in 1 N NaOH, and their 3Hor 14C content was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Cl–-free ORI was prepared by substitution with gluconate (90 mm Na+-gluconate, 3 mm K+-gluconate, 2 mm Ca2+-gluconate, 1 mm Mg2+-gluconate, 5 mm HEPES-Tris, pH 7.6). For transport assays in the absence of Cl–, the oocytes were initially washed three times with Cl–-free ORI over 15 min and then incubated at room temperature for the appropriate time periods, in the Cl–-free ORI containing the radiolabel. For cis-inhibition experiments 1 mm malonic, glutaric, or adipic acid solutions were prepared in ORI, and pH was adjusted to 7.6. Uptake of [3H]PAH was assayed in the presence of each dicarboxylate at room temperature for 1 h using uptake of [3H]PAH in ORI without any dicarboxylate as control. Trans-stimulation experiments were performed by injecting oocytes with 46 nl of 5 mm unlabeled glutaric acid solution in water (pH adjusted to 7.6). They were then washed and kept on ice for 15 min, and then the uptake of [3H]PAH was assayed over 1 h in ORI. Oocytes not preloaded with glutarate served as controls. Immunocytochemistry—To study hOAT1 trafficking, oocytes were injected with the cRNA of FLAG-tagged wt or mutant hOAT1 or an equivalent volume of water (mocks). On day 3 after injection, they were manually devitellinized after 5–10 min of incubation in 200 mm K+ aspartate and then fixed in Dent’s solution (80% methanol, 20% Me2SO) overnight at –20 °C. The fixative was washed out, and oocytes were incubated with mouse anti-FLAG M2 IgG monoclonal antibody (Sigma) (dilution 1:1000) in the presence of 10% goat serum at 4 °C for 12 h. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, incubation with secondary Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) (dilution 1:200) was performed at room temperature for 3 h. After being washed with phosphate-buffered saline, stained oocytes were postfixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde for 30 min. The embedding procedure in acrylamide (Technovit 7100; Heraeus Kulzer, South Bend, IN) was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Embedded oocytes were cut into 5-μm sections and analyzed with a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss Axiophot, Germany). Quantification of Surface Expression—Photographs were taken under exactly the same conditions with 1-s exposures, and no changes were made in the acquired image files for adjusting brightness, contrast, sharpness, etc. All of the images were 8-bit gray scale. Following this, the program Image J was used to assess the intensity of fluorescence as represented by their gray values. Rectangular selections of equal area were made on individual oocytes and the function analyze > measure was used to estimate minimum and maximum vertically averaged pixel intensity (gray values) along the section. We took three such measurements from each oocyte, and 10 oocytes were used for each group, i.e. mock, wild type hOAT1, and mutants R466K and R466D (see Fig. 2C). Km Determinations—An indirect approach was applied for determining changes in affinity between mutant and wild type transporters and between normal and chloride free conditions. Oocytes expressing the respective transporter were assayed for 1 μm [3H]PAH uptake over 30 min in ORI with or without chloride and in the presence of increasing concentrations of unlabeled PAH (0–500 μm). The addition of unlabeled PAH inhibited uptake of [3H]PAH by a process adequately described by the Michaelis-Menten equation for competitive interaction of the labeled and unlabeled substrate (15Malo C. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 122: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), V=Vmax⋅[*S]Km+[*S]+[S]+C(Eq.1) where V is the rate of [3H]PAH transport from a concentration of labeled substrate equal to [*S]; Vmax is the maximum rate of mediated PAH transport; Km is the PAH concentration that resulted in half-maximal transport; [S] is the concentration of unlabeled PAH in the transport reaction; and C is a constant representing the component of total PAH uptake that was not saturated (over the range of substrate concentrations tested) and presumably reflected the combined influence of diffusive flux, nonspecific binding, and/or incomplete washing. Kinetics of glutarate transport were determined using 1.9 μm [14C]glutarate and increasing concentrations of unlabeled glutarate, and Km values were calculated as described for PAH above. Statistical Analysis—All of the data presented are the means ± S.E. of the number of observations indicated in the text or figure legends. n is given as the number of experiments on oocytes from different donor animals, with the number of oocytes used per treatment in each individual experiment being 9–12. Statistical analysis was performed using SigmaPlot version 10 (Systat Software GmbH, Erkrath, Germany). Significant p values are indicated and were calculated by Student’s t test and one-way analysis of variance. In Fig. 1A we show the currently accepted secondary structure model of the human organic anion transporter 1 that contains a positively charged arginine at position 466 in the middle of the putative 11th transmembrane helix (16Burckhardt G. Wolff N.A. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: F853-F866Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 17Hong M. Tanaka K. Pan Z. Ma J. You G. Biochem. J. 2007; 401: 515-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This arginine residue is conserved in OAT1 homologues from human, monkey, pig, rabbit, mouse, rat, flounder, and Caenorhabditis elegans, as well as in other organic anion transporters of the SLC22 family: OAT2, OAT3, and OAT4 (Fig. 1B), and is also oppositely charged in the OCTs, which suggested to us an important role for this residue for function. When expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, the FLAG-tagged wild type human OAT1 transports the model anion, p-aminohippurate (PAH; Fig. 2A). 1 μm [3H]PAH uptake into wt hOAT1 expressing oocytes was 2.7 ± 0.4 pmol/oocyte·30 min. By site-directed mutagenesis, we then replaced the arginine 466 of FLAG-tagged hOAT1 by lysine (mutant R466K), keeping the positive charge at this position untouched. This subtle mutation resulted in a considerably decreased uptake of PAH (Fig. 2A), although PAH uptake by R466K was still significantly higher than in mock oocytes. 1 μm [3H]PAH uptake by mutant R466K was 0.30 ± 0.05 pmol/oocyte·30 min. These values represent ∼31-fold and 3.5-fold increases in PAH uptake over mocks by wt and mutant R466K-hOAT1 expressing oocytes, respectively. Charge reversal by substitution with aspartic acid (mutant R466D) led to a further loss of function by the transporter to about half that of R466K (see Fig. 4). Because the lower transport rate of R466K could be the result of a decreased expression of this mutant, we used anti-FLAG antibodies to detect the protein at the cell membrane. As shown in Fig. 2B, mock oocytes did not show any immunoreactivity, excluding a nonspecific labeling of endogenous proteins by anti-FLAG antibodies. Oocytes expressing the FLAG-tagged wt OAT1 revealed a clear fluorescence labeling at their plasma membrane. Likewise, the mutants R466K and R466D (also Fig. 2B) appeared at the plasma membrane. A quantification of surface expression yielded a similar density of wtOAT1, R466K, and R466D (Fig. 2C). Hence, the low transport rate of R466K (and of R466D) is not due to a decreased expression of the transporter protein at the cell membrane. Another signature of the OAT1s is that PAH transport is cis-inhibitable by dicarboxylates with a minimum chain length of five carbon atoms (18Uwai Y. Okuda M. Takami K. Hashimoto Y. Inui K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We next tested whether the mutant R466K interacts with dicarboxylates of different chain lengths. Fig. 3 (left panel) shows the effect of 1 mm malonate (three carbons, backbone), glutarate (five carbons), and adipate (six carbons) on wt OAT1. Malonate slightly inhibited the uptake of PAH, whereas glutarate and adipate completely abolished it. This result is in agreement with the previously observed dependence of inhibition on the chain length of dicarboxylates (18Uwai Y. Okuda M. Takami K. Hashimoto Y. Inui K. FEBS Lett. 1998; 438: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Similar to the wild type, the mutant R466K was slightly but not significantly inhibited by malonate (Fig. 3, right panel), whereas glutarate and adipate significantly decreased PAH uptake. Physiologically, OAT1 exchanges extracellular organic anions with intracellular α-ketoglutarate. We therefore preloaded oocytes with glutarate, the nonmetabolizable analogue of α-ketoglutarate. As shown in Fig. 4, this preloading significantly stimulated PAH uptake into wt-expressing oocytes. This increase in PAH uptake is termed trans-stimulation, because glutarate was offered from the trans-side, and labeled PAH from the cis-side, of the oocyte cell membrane. A trans-stimulation of PAH uptake by intracellular glutarate was also observed with the mutant R466K, suggesting that the replacement of arginine 466 by lysine did not impair the interaction of OAT1 with dicarboxylates. A replacement of arginine by the negatively charged aspartate (R466D), however, not only decreased PAH uptake below that observed with R466K, but in addition abolished the trans-stimulation by glutarate (Fig. 4, right panel). Yet, the mutant R466D was expressed at the cell membrane (Fig. 2, B and C). Transport by OAT1 was reported to be stimulated by chloride (19Hosoyamada M. Sekine T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F122-F128PubMed Google Scholar). Fig. 5 depicts an experiment in which we replaced chloride with gluconate. Upon removal of chloride, PAH uptake by the wt OAT1 was decreased by ∼87% from 2.7 ± 0.4 pmol/oocyte·30 min to 0.35 ± 0.09 pmol/oocyte·30 min but was still significantly (p < 0.05) higher than PAH uptake in mock cells. In mock cells, chloride removal had no effect, excluding nonspecific effects on the oocytes. As opposed to the wt, chloride removal in R466K-expressing oocytes did not alter PAH uptake (Fig. 5, right panel). PAH uptake by R466K was 0.30 ± 0.05 pmol/oocyte·30 min in the presence of chloride and 0.30 ± 0.06 pmol/oocyte·30 min in its absence. Thereby, PAH uptake by wt in the absence of chloride and by R466K in the presence or absence of chloride was of the same magnitude, suggesting that arginine 466 is required for the chloride sensitivity of OAT1. The mutation of Arg466 may influence the chloride sensitivity of only the PAH uptake or of organic anion transport in general. Therefore we investigated the effect of chloride on the uptake of radiolabeled glutarate (Fig. 6, left panel) and ochratoxin A (right panel), two compounds with unrelated chemical structures. Chloride removal clearly inhibited glutarate uptake as well as ochratoxin A transport in wt-expressing oocytes. Uptake of both glutarate and ochratoxin A was found to be reduced in the mutant R466K and no longer to be dependent on the presence or absence of chloride. These results suggest that optimal transport of PAH, glutarate, and ochratoxin A requires chloride in wt OAT1 but not in the mutant R466K. The strongly decreased uptake of PAH by the wt in the absence of chloride and by R466K in the presence and absence of chloride may be due to either a decrease in affinity or in maximal velocity of OAT1. To discriminate between these possibilities, we measured uptake at various concentrations of PAH and used the method of Malo and Berteloot (15Malo C. Berteloot A. J. Membr. Biol. 1991; 122: 127-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) to determine Km and Vmax of PAH uptake (see “Materials and Methods” for details). The results are shown in Table 2. With the wt OAT1, the Km is 3.1 ± 0.8 μm in the presence of chloride and 4.0 ± 1.5 μm in its absence. The mutant R466K exhibited an apparent Km for PAH of 6.4 ± 0.2 μm in the presence of chloride and of 4.5 ± 1.1 μm in its absence. Therefore, chloride removal did not significantly change the apparent affinity of wt and mutant OAT1 for PAH. Because the apparent Km values of wt and R466K did not differ significantly, the mutation itself appeared to have no impact on the affinity of OAT1 for PAH.TABLE 2Effect of chloride on the kinetic parameters of wt hOAT1 and mutant R466KhOAT1Uptake bufferKmVmaxμmpmol/30 min·oocyteWild type+Cl-3.1 ± 0.87.17 ± 2.11Wild type-Cl-4.0 ± 1.50.99 ± 0.06R466K+Cl-6.4 ± 0.21.10 ± 0.15R466K-Cl-4.5 ± 1.10.55 ± 0.11 Open table in a new tab Similar kinetic experiments performed with [14C]glutarate also revealed that the mutation does not influence affinity.

Table 2 shows that the removal of chloride strongly decreased Vmax of PAH uptake by the wt OAT1. Hence, the decrease in PAH uptake seen after chloride removal is due to a change in Vmax at constant Km. In the mutant R466K, chloride removal decreased Vmax to a much smaller extent than that seen in wt OAT1. Because Vmax values depend on the level of transporter expression that differs between various oocyte preparations, we measured chloride dependence of wild type and mutant R466K in a single preparation using a total PAH concentration of 100 μm. To account for nonspecific uptake, we subtracted uptake in the presence of 10 mm unlabeled PAH. At 100 μm PAH the transporter would be saturated and run at Vmax. As shown in Fig. 7, the transporter-mediated maximal PAH uptake was reduced by >80% in wt hOAT1 in the absence of chloride but remained unchanged for the mutant R466K. It is recognized that the OATs have a truly multispecific substrate selectivity. In recent years the number of characterized pharmaceutically and physiologically important compounds interacting with the OATs had increased. Among pharmaceuticals, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, antivirals, and antineoplastics (5Burckhardt B.C. Burckhardt G. Rev. Physiol. Biochem.

The next step, i.e. investigating interindividual variations or the pharmacogenomics has also been taken. Single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified for OAT1, and pharmacologically relevant effects on drug handling have been demonstrated, for example, for antivirals (23Bleasby K. Hall L.A.

This calls for greater understanding of the physiology of organic anion transport through OATs. Until the exact structure of OATs is known through crystallography, mutational analyses may provide insight. The existing crystal structures of the SLC family, i.e. that of H+/lactose symporter (LacY) and the phosphate/glycerol-3-phosphate antiporter (GlpT), already provide some clues toward the structure of OATs and serve as templates for putative in silico molecular models (26Abramson J. Kaback H.R. Iwata S. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2004; 14: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Indeed, positively charged residues embedded in the middle of TMDs have been found to be involved in substrate binding/translocation in both LacY and GltP. Many researchers have used these models as templates to aid functional studies in transporters related to OAT1. In particular, the functional importance of anionic amino acids in the 11th TMD of rOCT1 (27Gorboulev V. Volk C. Arndt P. Akhoundova A. Koepsell H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1999; 56: 1254-1261Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar) and in the 10th TMD of rbOCT2 (28Zhang X. Shirahatti N.V. Mahadevan D. Wright S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 34813-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) have been demonstrated using these models as templates. Recently, Perry et al. (29Perry J.L. Dembla-Rajpal N. Hall L.A. Pritchard J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 38071-38079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) provided a theoretical three-dimensional model for hOAT1 based on the crystal structure of GlpT where they showed Arg466 (the residue investigated in this study) to be one of the residues that surround the putative active cavity of hOAT1. In the present study we report that the positively charged arginine 466 in the helix 11 of hOAT1 is critically important for the transporter. Arg466 Is Important for Both Binding of Dicarboxylates and Conformational Changes Required for Substrate Translocation—Mutation of this positively charged residue Arg466 to a negative aspartate D led to severely reduced transport of PAH. No trans-stimulation of radiolabeled PAH influx could be seen upon preloading with the exchange partner glutarate, suggesting that interaction with dicarboxylates was abolished. In our earlier studies with the flounder OAT1 (11Wolff N.A. Grunwald B. Friedrich B. Lang F. Godehardt S. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it was shown that this mutation led to a loss of interaction with dicarboxylates, and no trans-stimulation or cis-inhibition of PAH transport could be demonstrated along with a reduction of PAH affinity. Because of the extremely low uptake of R466D mutant in hOAT1, we were unable to measure affinity. Because in flounder OAT1 only a nonconservative Arg to Asp substitution was made, in the present study, we made a conservative mutation wherein the cationic arginine 466 in hOAT1 was mutated to Lys, another cationic amino acid. We report that this conservative mutation could rescue the Arg to Asp mutant in many ways. First, the transport rate was increased; second, the affinity remained similar to the wild type transporter; third, cis-inhibition profile of the mutant by a series of dicarboxylates of increasing chain lengths remained qualitatively similar to the wild type; and fourth, the mutant transported glutarate and could also be trans-stimulated by it. The counterparts of Arg466 in hOAT1 have been investigated in other transporters of the SLC22 family, namely, in fOAT1 (11Wolff N.A. Grunwald B. Friedrich B. Lang F. Godehardt S. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2001; 12: 2012-2018Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), rOCT1 (27Gorboulev V. Volk C. Arndt P. Akhoundova A. Koepsell H. Mol.

Chem. 2005; 280: 34813-34822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), rOAT3 (12Feng B. Dresser M.J. Shu Y. Johns S.J. Giacomini K.M. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 5511-5520Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and rOCT2 (31Bahn A. Hagos Y. Rudolph T. Burckhardt G. Biochimie (Paris). 2004; 86: 133-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar). In the above cases, both a conservative mutation and Km determination was only made for hOAT1 (present study) and for rOCT1. In both cases it was found that the Km values remained the same (PAH for OAT1 and 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium for OCT1) or were decreased (choline, tetraethylammonium, N1-methylnicotinamide for OCT1), whereas the maximal transport rate (Vmax) went down severely. Because the low Vmax could have been due to reduced surface expression, we checked for membrane trafficking and found similar expression of the mutant and wild type transporters. Because arginine is ∼1.5 Å longer than lysine and has a different pKa and hydrogen bonding profile, one possible explanation why lysine does not substitute for arginine is that Arg466 plays a role in conformational change via short range interactions and shortening the residue even by this little is not able to rescue the reduced turnover. The low turnover number indicates that this residue also contributes structurally to the transporter apart from its interaction with dicarboxylates. This may be through stabilizing the binding site through the formation of salt bridges with adjacent/nearby amino acids. Because of the large substrate specificity of hOAT1, it is likely that a number of residues will contribute to substrate binding. The fact that in the R466K mutant affinity for PAH has remained unchanged and interaction with glutarate could be rescued by simply manipulating the charge implies that this residue is important for binding of dicarboxylates and may or may not be a player in PAH binding. Arg466 Interacts with Chloride as a Major Determinant in Substrate Movements through the Transporter—Our second set of observations was concerned with determining what role chloride plays in OATs. Stimulation by chloride has been reported for a number of the cloned OATs (6Wolff N.A. Thies K. Kuhnke N. Reid G. Friedrich B. Lang F. Burckhardt G. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2003; 14: 1959-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar, 19Hosoyamada M. Sekine T. Kanai Y. Endou H. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: F122-F128PubMed Google Scholar, 32Race J.E. Grassl S.M. Williams W.J. Holtzman E.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 255: 508-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar), and an earlier study using basolateral membrane vesicles from rat kidney (33Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar). Although OAT1 and OAT3 have been reported to be dependent on chloride such that the rate of transport decreases in the absence of chloride, OAT4 was stimulated under chloride-free conditions, suggesting Cl–/organic anion exchange (34Hagos Y. Stein D. Ugele B. Burckhardt G. Bahn A. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 2007; 18: 430-439Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). First, we quantified the transport of OAT1 substrates of different physicochemical properties, namely, PAH (monovalent anion), glutarate (divalent anion), and ochratoxin A (bulky monovalent anion), all high affinity substrates of OAT1, in the presence and absence of chloride. For PAH we found that chloride removal brings down transport rate to ∼13% of the original value. This was also the case for the other substrates, namely, glutarate and ochratoxin A. Therefore, we conclude that the chloride effect is a general phenomenon on hOAT1 and not dependent upon the substrate. Kinetic analyses of PAH transport in wild type hOAT1, in the presence and absence of chloride showed no significant change in affinity but greatly reduced Vmax. Because affinity for PAH did not change in the absence of chloride, it can be considered that chloride does not interact with the PAH-binding site. There arise two ways of interpreting these findings: 1) chloride is co-transported with organic anions via a binding site different from that of PAH, and 2) chloride binds to OAT1 but is not transported and serves other purposes important for turnover. The possibility of chloride transport has been tested in the earlier study by J. B. Pritchard (33Pritchard J.B. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: F597-F604PubMed Google Scholar) using basolateral membrane vesicles, and it was found that 36Cl– uptake by basolateral membrane vesicles was not altered by PAH transport, nor could a chloride gradient (in > out) stimulate PAH entry. Therefore chloride is not co-transported. We favor the other possibility that chloride binding stimulates the transporter through conformational changes resulting in increased turnover of the transporter. That is why chloride depletion leads to lowered Vmax at unaltered Km. Based on our results, it is likely that chloride exerts these effects through the amino acid arginine 466, because the mutant R466K essentially behaves like hOAT1 under chloride free conditions; it has similar affinity for PAH, and it can be cis-inhibited and trans-stimulated by dicarboxylates; however, it is not stimulated by chloride. In summary, we report that hOAT1 is stimulated by chloride, and in the absence of chloride its turnover number decreases, whereas PAH affinity does not change. The chloride effect is observed for other substrates as well. A charge-conserving mutation of the arginine in helix 11 of hOAT1, R466K, results in a functional mutant with low transport rates but similar affinity to PAH and similar interaction with dicarboxylates. The mutation of this single amino acid has two effects: 1) Vmax is reduced although surface expression remained the same, suggesting a structural role for this amino acid, and 2) chloride dependence is abolished, suggesting that this residue may be the one through which chloride exerts its stimulatory effects."

Animals with these mutations exhibited alterations in their blood glucose concentration that were inversely related to the relative activity index of GK. Moreover, the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion from islets with either the activating or inactivating mutation were left- or right-shifted, respectively. However, we were surprised to find that mice with the activating mutation had markedly reduced amounts of hepatic GK activity. Further studies of bacterially expressed mutant enzymes revealed that GKA456V is as stable as the wild type enzyme, whereas GKK414E is thermolabile. However, the ability of GK regulatory protein to inhibit GKA456V was found to be less than that of the wild type enzyme, a finding consistent with impaired hepatic nuclear localization. Taken together, this study indicates that it is necessary to have knowledge of both thermolability and the interactions of mutant GK enzymes with GK regulatory protein when attempting to predict in vivo glycemic phenotypes based on the measurement of enzyme kinetics.

Increased GK in either cell type leads to more glucose uptake and glucose phosphorylation, whereas diminished GK expression has the opposite effect. In the β cell, these changes impact insulin secretion by altering the threshold for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Indeed, in mice with a β cell-specific knock-out of GK, glucose-stimulated insulin secretion is so markedly impaired that death occurs shortly after birth due to severe hyperglycemia. In the liver, alterations in GK activity directly affect rates of glucose uptake and glycogen synthesis. However, the total absence of GK in hepatocytes, unlike β cells, results only in mild hyperglycemia. In contrast to the pancreatic β cell and hepatocyte, our understanding of the role of GK in other sites of expression, such as pancreatic α-cells, gut L- and K-type enterocytes, the pituitary, and certain hypothalamic nuclei of the brain, is less extensive (15Jetton T.L.

In contrast, mutations from MODY-GK pedigrees are characterized by an increase in glucose S0.5 and/or a decrease in Kcat. However, in some cases, the kinetics of the bacterially expressed mutant enzymes do not exhibit the expected kinetic abnormalities. In these instances, other explanations, such as increased thermolability or loss of regulation by GKRP, need to be invoked in order to explain diminished GK catalysis (4Burke C.V. Buettger C.W.

To assess whether kinetic measurements alone of bacterially expressed mutant GK enzymes provide sufficient information to predict the blood glucose phenotypes, we generated gkA456V and gkK414E mutant alleles and characterized their in vivo effects. These two particular mutations were chosen because kinetic information is available for both (7Christesen H.B. Jacobsen B.B. Odili S. Buettger C. Cuesta-Munoz A. Hansen T. Brusgaard K. Massa O.

Magnuson M.A. Matschinsky F.M. Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). GKK414E, which was found in a pedigree with MODY-GK (3Froguel P. Zouali H. Vionnet N. Velho G. Vaxillaire M. Sun F. Lesage S. Stoffel M. Takeda J. Passa P. Permutt M.A. Beckmann J.S. Bell G.I. Cohen D. N. Engl. J. Med. 1993; 328: 697-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (716) Google Scholar), has only a modestly impaired relative activity index (GK Kcat/glucose Sh0.5) (2.5/2.5 + ATP Km) compared with the wild type enzyme of 0.32, as shown in Table 1 (37Davis E.A.

By choosing an enzyme with only modest kinetic impairments, we hoped that mice homozygous for this mutation might only be modestly hyperglycemic and therefore viable. On the other hand, we thought that GKA456V, which was identified in a patient with PHHI-GK and has a relative activity index of 37.9 (7Christesen H.B. Jacobsen B.B. Odili S. Buettger C. Cuesta-Munoz A. Hansen T. Brusgaard K. Massa O. Magnuson M.A. Shiota C. Matschinsky F.M. Barbetti F. Diabetes. 2002; 51: 1240-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar), would cause marked hypoglycemia in a mouse model, particularly when the mutant allele was present as a homozygous trait.TABLE 1Kinetic constants of bacterially expressed GST fusion proteinsKinetic parameterWild typeGST-GKA456VGST-GKK414Ekcat (s−1)53.2 ± 0.9784.9 ± 4.511.0 ± 3.33Glucose S0.5 (mmol/liter)8.04 ± 0.282.53 ± 0.1012.3 ± 3.30nH (unitless)1.67 ± 0.041.21 ± 0.031.67 ± 0.11ATP Km (mmol/liter)0.39 ± 0.020.29 ± 0.031.73 ± 0.2Relative activity index (unitless)1.037.90.32 Open table in a new tab Surprisingly, both the gkA456V and gkK414E mutant mice were phenotypically different than expected. First, animals that were homozygous for the gkK414E mutation exhibited perinatal lethality, a finding that led us to discover that this mutation results in a thermolabile enzyme. Second, mice that are either heterozygous or homozygous for the gkA456V mutation exhibited only modest hypoglycemia and, surprisingly, exhibited diminished hepatic GK activity. Further analysis revealed that the gkA456V mutant enzyme has a reduced affinity for GKRP, a finding that would explain both the impaired nuclear localization and diminished hepatic GK activity observed in the gkA456V mice. Taken together, these studies indicate that knowledge of how specific point mutations affect GK stability and GKRP binding is essential for accurately predicting in vivo glycemic phenotypes based on the kinetics of bacterially expressed enzymes. Gene Targeting—Two gene targeting vectors were made for independently introducing K414E and A456V mutations into the mouse gk gene. The targeting vectors were based on a design that has been described previously (13Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J. Cherrington A.D. Magnuson M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 305-315Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1028) Google Scholar). PCR-based mutagenesis was performed using the primers 5′-GTGGATGGCTCCGTGTACGAGCTGCAGCCGAGGTCA and 5′-TGACCTCGGGTGCAGCTCGTACACGGAGCCATCCAC to introduce the K414E mutation into exon 9. Similarly, the A456V mutation was introduced into exon 10 using the primers 5′-CTGGTCTCTGCGGTGGTCTGCAAGAAGGCTTGCATG and 5′-CATGCAAGCCTTGCTTGCAGACCACCGCAGAGACCAG. Both vectors were linearized with SalI prior to electroporation into a 129S6 mouse ES cell line (13Postic C. Shiota M. Niswender K.D. Jetton T.L. Chen Y. Moates J.M. Shelton K.D. Lindner J.

Symp. 1994; 182: 157-178PubMed Google Scholar). ES cell clones were selected with 2 μm ganciclovir and 200 μg/ml G418. Chimeric mice were generated by blastocyst microinjections into 3.5-day-old embryos derived from C57Bl/6 mice using clones 1E7 and 1E10 that bore the gkK414E and gkA456V mutations, respectively. The resulting chimeric mice were bred to either wild type 129S6 mice or to C57Bl/6J animals bearing an EIIa-cre transgene. This resulted in the retention of the pgk-neoR cassette in the 129S6 background and removal of the cassette in the C57Bl/6J background. Off-spring from the EIIa-cre transgene matings that did not pass the transgene were subsequently interbred with C57Bl/6J animals for 10 generations to generate a new congenic line for both the gkK414E and gkA456V alleles. Mouse Husbandry and Genotyping—Mice were maintained in a specific pathogen-free state, exposed to a 12-h light/dark cycle, and fed a standard rodent chow (Purina Mills, St. Louis, MO). The mutant gk alleles were distinguished from the wild-type allele by DNA PCR analysis. The gkK414E+neo and gkA414V+neo alleles were detected using primer 1 (5′-TGTCTCAATTTGCTGTGTCCTCCA and 5′-AGCCTCTGTTCCACATACACTTCA), which amplifies a 725-bp fragment of pgk-neo cassette. The wild type gk allele (gkW) was detected as a 636-bp fragment using primer 1 and 5′-ATGTGTGAGTGTGCCAATATGAGT. Analytical Procedures—Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance tests were performed on 8-28-week-old mice fasted for 6 h (8 a.m. to 2 p.m.). Animals were injected intraperitoneally with glucose (1 g/kg of body weight). Whole blood was collected from the saphenous vein, and blood glucose was measured using a Hemocue analyzer. Plasma insulin was measured using a sensitive rat insulin radioimmunoassay (RIA) kit (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Plasma glucagon was measured using glucagon RIA kit (Linco). Plasma triglyceride concentrations were measured using a Triglycerides GPO reagent kit (Raichem, San Diego, CA) following a 6-h fast. Glucose Ramp Studies—Islets were isolated by collagenase digestion and cultured for 3 days in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mm glucose as previously described (42Li C. Buettger C. Kwagh J. Matter A. Daikhin Y. Nissim I.B. Collins H.W. Yudkoff M. Stanley C.A. Matschinsky F.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 13393-13401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). The culture medium was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mm glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and the islets were incubated at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, 95% air-humidified incubator. Batches of 100 cultured mouse islets were loaded onto a nylon filter in a chamber and perifused with Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate buffer (115 mmol/liter NaCl, 24 mmol/liter NaHCO3, 5 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter MgCl2, 2.5 mmol/liter CaCl2, 10 mm HEPES, pH 7.4) with 0.25% bovine serum albumin at a flow rate of 2 ml/min. Perifusate solutions were gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2 and maintained at 37 °C. Samples were collected every min for insulin assays. Insulin was measured by RIA. Real Time PCR—Total RNAs were extracted from liver (8-12-week-old mice) using a GenElute Mammalian Total RNA Miniprep kit (Sigma). The total RNAs were treated with RNase-free DNase (Promega, Madison, WI) and then converted into cDNA using a Taqman reverse transcription kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA). Real-time PCR quantification of gene expression was performed using SYBR green (Applied Biosystems) on an Applied Biosystems Prism 7000 thermocycler, and gene expression was calibrated against 18 S RNA. The GK primers were 5′-CACAATGATCTCCTGCTACT and 5′-TTCTGCATCTCCTCCATGTA. The GKRP primers were 5′-GTGAGCATGGCCAGAAATGAT and 5′-GCATCCGCTCTGCCACTT. Immunoblot Analysis—Animals were anesthetized with 40 mg of Nembutal per kg of body weight and then killed by decapitation. The livers were quickly removed and frozen in liquid nitrogen. 0.2 g of frozen liver tissue was homogenized in 1 ml of lysis buffer (50 mm triethanolamine-HCl, pH 7.3, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 1 pellet of protein inhibitors/10 ml of lysis buffer (Roche Applied Science)). Homogenates were incubated with 200 μl of 25% polyethylene glycol (Mr 3350; Sigma) on ice for 15 min. Clarified lysates were obtained by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for 15 min, and liver extracts were frozen at -70 °C. Islets of Langerhans were isolated by a collagenase technique as described (43Lacy P.E. Kostianovsky M. Diabetes. 1967; 16: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (2492) Google Scholar), hand-picked, and then sonicated in 50 μl of lysis buffer. Protein concentrations were measured by Bio-Rad protein assay. 10 μg of liver protein extracts and 1 μg of islet protein extracts were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad). The membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies: sheep anti-GST fusion GK (1:10,000 dilution) (44Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2619-2623Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), rabbit anti-GKRP (1:40,000 dilution) (45Shiota M. Postic C. Fugimoto U. Jetton T.L. Dixon K. Pan D. Grimsby J. Grippo J.F. Magnuson M.A. Cherrington A.D. Diabetes. 2001; 50: 622-629Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (1:80,000 dilution; Abcam) overnight at 4 °C. Membranes were incubated with the following secondary antibodies: Alexa Fluor 680 donkey anti-sheep, Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit (1:40,000 dilution; Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR), and IRDye 800 donkey anti-mouse (1:40,000 dilution; Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA). Visualization and quantification of the immunolabeled proteins was accomplished using the Odyssey™ infrared imaging system (Li-Cor, Lincoln, NE), which measures integrated pixel intensity. Glucokinase Kinetics—Approximately 200 mg of frozen liver was homogenized in 2 ml of buffer consisting of 50 mmol/liter HEPES, 100 mmol/liter KCl, 1 mmol/liter EDTA, 5 mmol/liter MgCl2, and 2.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol (46Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 25019-25025Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Homogenates were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 45 min to sediment the microsomal fraction. GK activity was measured in the cytosolic fraction. The supernatants were analyzed for GK in a medium (pH 7.4 at 37 °C) containing 50 mmol/liter HEPES, 100 mmol/liter KCl, 7.5 mmol/liter MgCl2, 5 mmol/liter ATP, 2.5 mmol/liter dithiothreitol, 0.5 (for hexokinase), 7.5 (for GK), or 100 mmol/liter glucose (total phosphorylating activity), 0.5 mmol/liter NAD+, and 4 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Sigma). The reaction was initiated by the addition of ATP, and the reduction of NAD+ was assessed by measuring absorbance at 340 nm after 10, 20, and 30 min of incubation time. GK activity (Vmax) was determined as the change in absorbance between 10 and 30 min at 100 mm glucose minus the absorbance at 0.5 mm glucose (which measures hexokinase activity). The relative GK activity ratio was determined as the absorbance change between 0.5 and 7.5 mm glucose divided by the GK Vmax and normalized to wild type values. Enzyme Stability Measurements—Thermolability of the GK mutants K414E, A456V, and E300K and wild type GST-GK fusion protein was assessed using protocols previously described (40Gloyn A.L. Odili S.

Structure. 2004; 12: 429-438Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (398) Google Scholar) was measured by incubation with 0 to ∼100 mm glucose while maintaining protein concentrations of ∼75 μg/ml. GK activity was then determined after incubation at 42.5 °C for 30 min. A GKRP inhibition assay was carried out as previously described (37Davis E.A. Cuesta-Munoz A. Raoul M. Buettger C. Sweet I.

Diabetologia. 1999; 42: 1175-1186Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) using 11.1 nm wild type or mutant GK with glucose at the inflection point of each enzyme so that glucose concentrations are equivalent. Glucose concentrations were 3.0 mm for wild type GK, 2.75 mm for K414E, and 0.612 mm for A456V. ATP concentrations were 1 mm for wild type GK, 2.3 mm for GK-K414E, and 0.61 mm for GK-A456V. Pancreatic Insulin Content—Pancreata were removed from 20-30-week-old mice, weighed, and homogenized for 45 s with 3 ml of cold acid/ethanol buffer (1% HCl and 75% EtOH). The Polytron probe was rinsed with 3 ml of acid/buffer, and the two buffers were combined and incubated overnight at 4 °C. Lysates were centrifuged at 2400 rpm for 30 min, and the supernatants were put into a 15-ml tube. 1 ml of acid/ethanol buffer was added to the pellet and homogenized for 45 s. The lysate was incubated for 2 h at 4 °C. Centrifugation was performed as before as well as homogenization. The supernatants were combined and frozen at -70 °C. Insulin was measured using a sensitive rat insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Linco, St. Charles, MO). Histological Analysis—Pancreas was fixed overnight, and liver tissues were fixed for 3 h in 4% paraformaldehyde and processed as described (44Jetton T.L. Magnuson M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Although cell stimulation experiments demonstrate the preferential activation of TLR9 by CpG-containing nucleic acids, direct binding investigations have reached contradictory conclusions with respect to the ability of this receptor to bind nucleic acids in a sequence-specific manner. To address this apparent discrepancy, we report the purification of the soluble ectodomain of human TLR9 with characterization of its ligand binding properties. We observe that TLR9 has a high degree of specificity in its ability to bind nucleic acids that contain CpG dinucleotides as well as higher order motifs that mediate species-specific activation. However, TLR9 is also functionally influenced by nucleic acids in a sequence-independent fashion as both stimulatory and nonstimulatory nucleic acids sensitize TLR9 for in vitro ligand binding as well as in vivo activation. We propose a model in which receptor activation is achieved in a sequence-dependent manner, and sensitivity is modulated by the absolute concentration of nucleic acids in a sequence-independent fashion. This model bears resemblance to that recently proposed for Toll in that activation is a two-step process in which formation of a ligand-bound monomer precedes formation of the activated dimer. In each model receptor sensitivity is determined within the second step with the crucial distinction that Toll undergoes negative cooperativity, whereas TLR9 is sensitized through a positive cooperative effect.

The mammalian innate immune system initiates conserved responses against an array of microbial challenges by targeting biomolecules that are conserved within microbes but largely absent from the host. These pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) 2The abbreviations used are: PAMP, pathogen-associated molecular pattern; TLR, Toll-like receptor; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ODN, oligodeoxynucleotide; PTO, phosphothioate; PD, phosphodiester; PBMC, peripheral blood mononuclear cell; PNGase F, peptide N-glycosidase F; LBD, ligand-binding domain. are recognized by germ line-encoded, pattern recognition receptors that include the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (1Hallman M. Raömet M. Ezekowitz R.A. Pediatr. Res. 2001; 50: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). TLRs are highly conserved type I integral membrane proteins that sample PAMPs in both the extracellular and intracellular compartments (2Ahmad-Nejad P. Hacker H. Rutz M. Bauer S. Vabulas R.M. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2002; 32: 1958-1968Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar). The ligand-binding regions of the TLRs consist primarily of repeating elements of a leucine-rich repeat motif (3Bell J.K. Mullen G.E. Leifer C.A. Mazzoni A. Davies D.R. Segal D.M. Trends Immunol. 2003; 24: 528-533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (605) Google Scholar). This motif is present in a large number of eukaryotic proteins that often share the unifying characteristic of mediating biomolecular interactions (4Kobe B. Kajava A.V. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 725-732Crossref PubMed Scopus (1297) Google Scholar). Indeed, the primary function of the leucine-rich repeat motif appears to be to provide an adaptable structural matrix for biomolecular interactions, the versatility of which is exemplified by the vast and structurally diverse ligands that are recognized by different TLRs as follows: microbial DNA (TLR9), lipopolysaccharides (TLR4), and bacterial flagella (TLR5) (5Janssens S. Beyaert R. Clin. Microbiol. Rev. 2003; 16: 637-646Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 6Kirk P. Bazan J.F. Immunity. 2005; 23: 347-350Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). There is considerable evidence that microbial DNA serves as the physiological ligand for TLR9. Most convincingly, TLR9 knock-out mice are unresponsive to bacterial DNA but can be made responsive through expression of TLR9 (7Hemmi H. Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Kaisho T. Sato S. Sajo H. Matsumoto M. Hoshino K. Wagner H. Takeda K. Akira S. Nature. 2000; 408: 740-745Crossref PubMed Scopus (5391) Google Scholar). Foreign and host DNA appear to be discriminated on the basis of unmethylated cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) dinucleotide sequences, which are frequent within microbial DNA but largely absent from host genetic material (8Bird A.P. Nature. 1986; 321: 209-213Crossref PubMed Scopus (3032) Google Scholar). The ability for CpG motifs, in the context of bacterial DNA or synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) analogs, to activate innate immune responses is well documented (9Krieg A.M. Yi A.K. Matson S. Waldschmidt T.J. Bishop G.A. Teasdale R. Koretzky G.A. Klinman D.M. Nature. 1995; 374: 546-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (3106) Google Scholar, 10Wagner H. Adv. Immunol. 1999; 73: 329-368Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although the CpG dinucleotide represents the minimum recognition element, TLR9 undergoes preferential activation, in a species-dependent manner, by specific higher order hexameric sequences. For example, mice are most responsive to a GACGTT motif, whereas human and bovine cells are preferentially activated by GTCGTT sequences (11Takeshita F. Leifer C.A. Gursel I. Ishii K.J. Takeshita S. Gursel M. Klinman D.M. J. Immunol. 2001; 167: 3555-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar, 12Bauer S. Kirschning C.J. Hacker H. Redecke V. Hausmann S. Akira S. Wagner H. Lipford G.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 9237-9242Crossref PubMed Scopus (1285) Google Scholar). The ability for specific sequences of ODNs to mediate species-dependent responses is generally assumed to reflect the unique ligand preferences of TLR9s from various species, although there is little direct experimental evidence to support this hypothesis. The low cost, ease of production, and stability of nucleic acids make TLR9 an attractive target for immunotherapeutic intervention. CpG-ODNs have the additional advantage of being one of the most selective stimulators of dendritic cells with minimal systemic toxicity (13Ioannou X.P. Griebel P.J. Mean A. Gomis S.M. Godson D.L. Mutwiri G. Hecker R. Babiuk L.A. van Drunen Little-van den Hurk S. Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev. 2003; 13: 157-167Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). There have been numerous human trials examining the immunotherapeutic potential of CpG-ODNs toward the applications of priming the innate immune system to mediate protection against infectious pathogens, as adjuvants, as anti-allergens, and as immunotherapeutics in the treatment of various malignancies (14Klinman D.M.

Despite the considerable therapeutic potential of CpG-ODNs, reasonable concerns have been raised with respect to their safety, in particular their potential to trigger autoimmune disorders. Studies have shown that high doses of bacterial DNA elicit the production of auto-antibodies against double-stranded DNA in normal mice (16Gilkeson G.S. Riuz P. Howell D. Lefkowith J.B. Pisetsky D.S. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1993; 68: 283-292Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) and accelerate the production of autoimmune antibodies in lupus-prone animals (17Gilkeson G.S. Pippen A.M. Pisetsky D.S. J. Clin. Investig. 1995; 95: 1398-1402Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). CpG-ODNs may also facilitate the development of toxic shock by lowering the pathological threshold of lipopolysaccharide tolerance (18Sparwasser T. Meithke T. Lipford G. Borschert K. Hicker H. Heeg K. Wagner H. Nature. 1997; 386: 336-338Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). Although the risks associated with these scenarios are low, they nevertheless emphasize the importance of optimization of TLR9 agonists. Currently, the rational design of TLR9 agonists is limited by a lack of basic information on the receptor-ligand interaction. This is largely a consequence of difficulties associated with purification of sufficient quantities of the receptor for biochemical characterization. As such, TLR9 ligands are currently evaluated primarily on the basis of their ability to elicit responses in immune cells. An inherent danger to this approach is that the reduction of numerous potential points of regulation to a single measured output does not permit discrimination of specific events, such as ligand binding, from the overall process. This is particularly problematic given the emerging evidence that the current paradigm of CpG-mediated activation likely underestimates the complexity of this system in terms of inputs and functional outputs (19O'Neill L.A.J. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2006; 18: 3-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (527) Google Scholar), as well as the observation that nucleic acids can elicit TLR9-independent cellular responses (20Wagner H. Bauer S. J. Exp. Med. 2006; 203: 265-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). A wealth of cell stimulation experiments has demonstrated the preferential ability for CpG, rather than GpC-ODNs, to initiate innate immune responses (21Krieg A.M. Yi A.K. Hartmann G. Pharmacol. Ther. 1999; 84: 113-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar, 22Bauer M. Heeg K. Wagner H. Lipford G.B. Immunology. 1999; 97: 699-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), and this is generally assumed to reflect sequence-specific binding by TLR9. However, ligand binding investigations have reached contradictory conclusions with respect to the ability of TLR9 to bind nucleic acids in a sequence-specific fashion. Although two in vitro studies have shown the preferential association of TLR9 with single-stranded CpG-ODNs (23Rutz M. Metzger J. Gellert T. Luppa P. Lipford G.B. Wagner H. Bauer S. Eur. J. Immunol. 2004; 34: 2541-2550Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar, 24Corné;lie S. Hoebeke J. Schacht A.M. Bertin B. Vicogne J. Capron M. Riveau G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15124-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar), both CpG- and non-CpG-ODNs were equally effective in mediating immunoprecipitation of TLR9, indicating that the receptor interacts with both activating and nonactivating ODNs (25Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). Furthermore, recent demonstrations of in vivo activation of TLR9 by phosphodiester ODNs in a CpG-independent fashion (26Yasuda K. Rutz M. Schlatter B. Metzger J. Luppa P.B. Schmitz F. Haas T. Heit A. Bauer S. Wagner H. Eur. J. Immunol. 2006; 36: 431-436Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar), as well as the suggestion that the discrimination of host and foreign DNA is dependent upon TLR9 localization rather than specificity of ligand binding (27Barton G.M. Kagan J.C. Medzhitov R. Nat. Immun. 2006; 7: 49-56Crossref Scopus (560) Google Scholar), undermine the hypothesis of exclusive CpG-mediated activation of TLR9. Collectively these data highlight the current lack of consensus on the ligand-binding proclivities of TLR9 as well as the emerging distinction between TLR9 ligand binding and receptor activation. The complexity of TLR activation is perhaps predicted by investigations of Toll, a receptor that bears considerable structural and functional similarity to the Toll-like receptors. Activation of Toll by the cytokine ligand Spaötzle involves two nonequivalent binding events and is influenced by receptor-receptor and receptor-ligand interactions (28Gay N.J. Gangloff M. Weber A.N.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar, 29Weber A.N.R. Moncrieffe M.C. Gangloff M. Imler J.L. Gay N.J. J. Biol. Chem. 2005; 280: 22793-22799Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). As full-length Toll ectodomains are able to form dimers in the absence of ligand, the resting state of Toll is suggested to involve ligand-free, inactive dimers (28Gay N.J. Gangloff M. Weber A.N.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Ligand binding segregates these inactive dimers into ligand-free and ligand-bound subunits. Their re-association to the formation of the active ligand-bound dimer is influenced by the ability of Spaötzle to induce structural alterations within the binding monomer that are translated to the incoming monomer. The functional consequence of these induced alterations is to decrease the affinity of the second subunit for Spaötzle such that ligand binding by the second Toll monomer occurs with an ∼3-fold lower affinity than that of the first (28Gay N.J. Gangloff M. Weber A.N.R. Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2006; 6: 693-698Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). This negative cooperative effect is proposed to represent a mechanism to increase the range of substrate concentrations to which Toll is responsive. Negative cooperativity in the activation of Toll is supported by kinetic investigations in which 400-fold increases in ligand concentration are required to achieve full activation of the receptor (30Weber A.N. Tauszig-Delamasure S. Hoffmann J.A. Lelievre E. Gascan H. Ray K.P. Morse M.A. Imler J.L. Gay N.J. Nat. Immun. 2003; 4: 794-800Crossref Scopus (345) Google Scholar). To investigate the specificity of ligand binding, as well as the occurrence of higher order regulatory events that may influence receptor function, we have expressed and purified the ectodomain of human TLR9 as a soluble protein for investigation of its ligand binding properties. Through this model we resolve a number of key issues with respect to the sequence and structural parameters that influence the ability of nucleic acids to function as TLR9 ligands. We also demonstrate that sequences that are unable to mediate direct activation of TLR9 nevertheless influence TLR9 function by sensitizing the receptor for in vitro ligand binding as well as in vivo activation. Cloning—With some species-specific variations, TLR9 is a protein of ∼1030 amino acids. The ligand-binding ectodomain consists of residues 1–815; residues 815–825 represent the transmembrane region, and the final C-terminal residues form the intracellular TIR domain. As the ligand-binding region of TLR9 has not been well characterized, we selected the entire ectodomain, amino acids 1–815, to represent the ligand-binding domain TLR9(LBD). A eukaryotic expression system, which employs the bovine hsp70A gene promoter to direct the heat-regulated synthesis of proteins in transfected bovine kidney epithelial cells, was used to express TLR9(LBD). This system has proven highly effective for the overexpression of other glycosylated proteins (31Kowalski J. Gilbert S.A. van Drunen-Little-van der Hurk S. van der Hurk J. Babiuk L.A. Zamb T.J. Vaccine. 1993; 11: 1100-1107Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). DNA encoding the ectodomain was PCR-amplified, with the addition of a 6-residue histidine tag at the C terminus, using a plasmid containing the human TLR9 open reading frame as a template (kindly provided by Grayson Lipford). The resulting PCR product was cloned downstream of a bovine hsp70A gene promoter, and the expression cassette was stably introduced into Madin-Darby bovine kidney cells by lentiviral delivery (32Rouas R. Uch R. Cleuter Y. Jordier F. Bagnis C. Mannoni P. Lewalle P. Martiat P. Van den Broeke A. Cancer Gene Ther. 2002; 9: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Purification—An advantage of this expression system is that the recombinant proteins are secreted into the culture media to greatly facilitate purification. Although the yields of the recombinant protein are relatively low, ∼50 μg of protein per liter of culture media, the nondestructive nature of this system permits large scale production by splitting the culture and ongoing heat-shock cycling. Sufficient quantities of the protein could be produced from 10 rounds of temperature shifting of 40 T150 flasks. Each round consists of 6 h at 39 °C followed by 18 h at 37 °C. The secreted protein was further purified from the media using commercially available nickel columns (Novagen). Purified TLR9(LBD) was dialyzed against 20 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Deglycosylation of TLR9(LBD)—To confirm the mass of the unmodified polypeptide, purified TLR9(LBD) was subjected to deglycosylation. TLR9(LBD) (20 μg) was denatured in 5% SDS with 0.4 m dithiothreitol for 10 min at 100 °C. Following this procedure, reaction buffer (0.5 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.5)) and 10% Nonidet P-40 were added at 1:10 reaction volume with 2.5 μl of peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F). The deglycosylation reaction was allowed to proceed at 37 °C for 1 h. Agarose Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—Unless otherwise specified, DNA binding assays were performed with the incubation of 8 μg of TLR9(LBD) (20 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm β-mercaptoethanol)) with 1.4 μg of DNA (pFLAG-CMV-2 expression vector (Sigma)) in the presence of 10 mm MgCl2. Reactions were buffered with 100 mm sodium acetate (pH 5.2). The final volume of each reaction was 50 μl. Reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 10 min, stopped with the addition of 10 μl of agarose loading solution (30% glycerol), and immediately electrophoresed through a 0.8% agarose gel at 95 V for 1 h. DNA visualization was through ethidium bromide staining. Agarose Electrophoretic Supershift Assays—Supershift assays were performed by the same methodology as described for the mobility shift assays with the exceptions that the TLR9(LBD) was dialyzed against (50 mm phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2), 100 mm NaCl), and the binding reactions were performed at pH 7.2 (50 mm Tris). For the supershift assay, 1 μg of a human TLR9 monoclonal antibody (Oncogene Research Products (EMD Biosciences)) was preincubated with 8 μg of TLR9(LBD) in reaction buffer for 1 h at room temperature. Plasmid DNA was added after this incubation period and electrophoresis performed as described earlier. Western Blot Analysis—Proteins were resolved through a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. Following electrophoresis, the proteins were transblotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PolyScreen, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The membranes were blocked with 3% molecular grade fat-free skim milk powder in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.02% (v/v) Tween 20. Primary and secondary washes were carried out using this sample buffer. The monoclonal antibody to human TLR9, α-hTLR9, was used at a dilution of at 4 μl/ml. The secondary antibody (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Inc.) (goat α-mouse IgG (H + L) at 0.5 μl/ml) was used to probe for TLR9-antibody complexes. Acrylamide Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assays—ODNs were end-labeled with [γ-32P]dCTP (Mandel) using the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I (Promega). Binding reactions containing 0.2 ng of double-stranded labeled probe, 8 μg of TLR9(LBD), 10 mm Tris (pH 7.8), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% glycerol were incubated at 37 °C for 20 min. Nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels (5%) containing 8.9 mm Tris (pH 8.0), 8.9 mm boric acid, 1 mm EDTA were pre-run at 5 V/cm for 30 min at 20 °C prior to loading of the binding reactions. Samples were loaded onto acrylamide gels with the addition of 5 μl of nondenaturing loading dye (50% v/v glycerol, 0.005% w/v bromphenol blue, 0.005% xylene cyanol) and electrophoresed for 2 h at 10 V/cm. Gels were dried for 1 h at 80 °C and exposed to a Kodak Storage Phosphor Screen GP. Storage phosphor screens were scanned with a Bio-Rad Molecular Imager FX using Bio-Rad Quantity One software. Cell Stimulation Assays—The isolation and culture of bovine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were as described previously (33Mena A. Nichani A.K. Popowych Y. Ioannou X.P. Godson D.L. Mutwiri G.K. Hecker R. Babiuk L.A. Griebel P. Oligonucleotides. 2003; 13: 245-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Briefly, PBMC were isolated from three mature (>1 year old) male and female cattle. Lymphocyte proliferative responses for each animal were assayed by stimulating triplicate cultures (2 × 105 cells/well) in a U-bottom 96-well culture plate. Cells were cultured for 72 h at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2, and 0.4 μCi of [3H]thymidine (Amersham Biosciences) was added to each well. Cells were harvested using standard liquid scintillation protocols, and the incorporation of 3H was measured using a beta-counter (Topcount, Packard Instrument Co.). The lymphocyte proliferative response was calculated as the mean counts/min for the triplicate cultures. Oligodeoxynucleotides—The sequences of the ODNs used in this investigation are presented in Table 1. The phosphothioate (PTO) versions of the 2007 ODNs consist exclusively of phosphothioate linkages. Phosphodiester (PD) ODNs were purchased from Invitrogen, and PTO ODNs were kindly provided by Qiagen.TABLE 1Oligodeoxynucleotides used in this investigationODN nameSequenceHuman CpGGGATCAGCGGAGGTCGTTTTGTCGTTCTCTGTCHuman GpCGGATCGACAGAGAACGACAAAACGACCTCCGCTMouse CpGGGATCAGCGGAGGACGTTCTGACGTTCTCTGTCMouse GpCGGATCGACAGAGAACGTCAGAACGTCCTCCGCT2007 CpGTCGTCGTTGTCGTTTTGTCGTT2007 GpCTGCTGCTTGTGCTTTTGTGCTT Open table in a new tab Determination of the Relative Abundance of TLR9 and DNA in Nucleoprotein Complexes—The stoichiometry of the shifted nucleoprotein complexes was determined by comparing the relative abundances of both nucleic acid and TLR9(LBD) within uniquely migrating species hypothesized to represent monomeric and dimeric forms of the TLR9 nucleoprotein complex. To qualify the nucleic acid component, agarose gels were scanned with an AlphaImager gel dock system (Alpha Innotech Corp.), and the intensities of the bands were expressed as a percentage of the total intensity of the two bands. To determine the relative ratio, the protein component of the shifted bands was excised, and proteins were extracted from the agarose by overnight freezing at –80 °C followed by high speed centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 30 min. Supernatants from the spins were subjected to Western blot analysis utilizing the same protocol and TLR9-specific antibody as described earlier. The blots were scanned using the same gel dock system, and the relative intensities of each of the bands was expressed as a percentage of the total intensity of the two bands. Purification of TLR9(LBD)—From our expression system, the recombinant TLR9(LBD) is secreted into the media as a soluble glycosylated protein. Following nickel-column purification, a single protein species, which is reactive with a monoclonal antibody to the ectodomain of human TLR9, was observed. The mass of this reactive band is consistent with that reported by others for the glycosylated form of comparable fragments of the receptor (25Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar). This protein was not present in media collected from cells that were not transfected with the TLR9(LBD) expression vector (Fig. 1A). Treatment of TLR9(LBD) with the deglycosylation enzyme PNGase F resulted in a protein species of ∼100 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted mass of the nonglycosylated polypeptide, as well as the observations of others (25Latz E. Schoenemeyer A. Visintin A. Fitzgerald K.A. Monks B.G. Knetter C.F. Lien E. Nilsen N.J. Espevik T. Golenbock D.T. Nat. Immun. 2004; 5: 190-198Crossref Scopus (1164) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1B). The principal objective in the expression/purification of the recombinant receptor was to obtain sufficient quantities of the protein for biochemical characterization through mobility shift assays. Importantly, these assays are not dependent upon the absolute purification of the receptor as the presence of the protein in nucleoprotein complexes is confirmed through supershift assays employing a specific monoclonal antibody. TLR9(LBD) Binds Plasmids—The ability of TLR9(LBD) to bind nucleic acids was investigated through a modified agarose electrophoretic mobility shift assay. This assay is based upon differential patterns of DNA migration in the presence of DNA-binding proteins. This system permits high-throughput analysis in a manner that is not dependent upon immobilization of either the receptor or the ligand. This permits more flexible characterization of receptor/ligand dynamics with respect to the formation of higher order structures such as dimers (34Ozer J. Mitsouras K. Zerby D. Carey M. Lieberman P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14293-14300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Within this system, patterns of nucleoprotein migration are dependent upon the charge/mass ratio of the complexes, as well as the formation of higher order structures that influence the overall size of the molecule. As such, there is not a linear relationship between the calculated molecular mass and the distance migrated within the gel. The shifts are qualitative in nature, permitting discrimination and visualization of nucleoprotein complexes of differing compositions. This is of particular value for discrimination of nucleic acid binding by monomeric or dimeric forms of proteins as these complexes migrate as distinct entities. The ability of TLR9(LBD) to influence the migration pattern of a plasmid demonstrates the ability of TLR9 to bind double-stranded DNA, which has been a point of contention in the literature. The ligand employed in our assay system is a closed circular plasmid that is present in both supercoiled and relaxed forms. We observe that TLR9(LBD) undergoes preferential association with supercoiled forms of plasmids, which may account for the reported discrepancies with regard to the efficiency of plasmid binding by TLR9. Investigations that report minimal association with plasmid have employed linear, double-stranded nucleic acids, whereas investigations supportive of plasmid binding have employed circular plasmids (24Corné;lie S. Hoebeke J. Schacht A.M. Bertin B. Vicogne J. Capron M. Riveau G. J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 15124-15129Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar, 25Latz E. Schoenemeyer A.

The difference in the ability of these ligands to form supercoiled species would account for their unique abilities to serve as TLR9 ligands. The association with nucleic acids is dependent upon the maintenance of a correctly folded structure as deliberate disruption of the structure of TLR9(LBD) by thermal denaturation prior to its addition to the reaction mixture abolished DNA binding activity (Fig. 2A). That the differential patterns of plasmid migration result specifically from TLR9(LBD) binding was verified by a supershift assay employing a monoclonal antibody to the extracellular domain of human TLR9. The binding of the antibody to TLR9(LBD) resulted in a uniquely migrating species of the plasmid, confirming the presence of TLR9(LBD) in the nucleoprotein complex (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, proteins extracted from the shifted bands were shown to be reactive with a human TLR9 monoclonal antibody (data not shown). TLR9 Forms Monomeric and Dimeric Nucleoprotein Complexes—TLR9(LBD) influences the migration of plasmid DNA as evidenced by the formation of two distinct migrating bands (Fig. 2A). These two nucleoprotein species likely represent nucleoprotein complexes involving monomeric and dimeric forms of the receptor. Ligand-induced dimerization is a common theme within the Toll and Toll-like family (35Takeuchi O. Kawai T. Muhlradt P.F. Morr M. Radolf J.D. Zychlinsky A. Takeda K. Akira S. Int.

https://openalex.org/W2009284265,"Src-like adaptor protein 2 (SLAP-2) is a hematopoietic adaptor protein previously implicated as a negative regulator of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR)-mediated signaling. SLAP-2 contains an SH3 and an SH2 domain, followed by a unique carboxyl-terminal tail, which is important for c-Cbl binding. Here we describe a novel role for SLAP-2 in regulation of the colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R), a receptor tyrosine kinase important for growth and differentiation of myeloid cells. SLAP-2 co-immunoprecipitates with c-Cbl and CSF-1R in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. Using murine myeloid cells expressing CSF-1R (FD-Fms cells), we show that SLAP-2 is tyrosine-phosphorylated upon stimulation with CSF-1 and associates constitutively with both c-Cbl and CSF-1R. In addition, we show that expression of a dominant negative form of SLAP-2 impairs c-Cbl association with the CSF-1R and receptor ubiquitination. Impaired c-Cbl recruitment also correlated with changes in the kinetics of CSF-1R down-regulation and trafficking. CSF-1-mediated differentiation of FD-Fms cells and activation of downstream signaling events was also enhanced in cells stably expressing dominant negative SLAP-2. Together, these results demonstrate that SLAP-2 plays a role in c-Cbl-dependent down-regulation of CSF-1R signaling.

All of the functions of colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) are mediated by CSF-1R, which is the primary regulator of the common myeloid lineage consisting of osteoclasts and mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes and macrophages) in vivo (2Dai X.M.

Ligand binding induces CSF-1R dimerization and autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues that regulate both kinase activity and mediate binding to downstream SH2 and PTB domain-containing proteins. Recruitment of such proteins leads to activation of signaling cascades involved in determining the biological outcomes of CSF-1R activation as well as receptor down-regulation (6Wilhelmsen K.

A number of adaptor proteins, including Gads/Mona, FMIP, DOK-2, and c-Cbl, have been implicated as negative regulators of CSF-1R signaling. c-Cbl possesses a variant SH2 domain (TKB domain) that mediates binding to activated tyrosine kinases and a RING finger domain demonstrated to confer E3 ubiquitin ligase activity, which promotes the ubiquitination of activated tyrosine kinases (9Meng W. Sawasdikosol S. Burakoff S.J. Eck M.J. Nature. 1999; 398: 84-90Crossref PubMed Scopus (248) Google Scholar, 10Joazeiro C.A. Wing S.S. Huang H. Leverson J.D. Hunter T. Liu Y.C. Science. 1999; 286: 309-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (917) Google Scholar). In c-Cbl-deficient macrophages, both CSF-1R ubiquitination and endocytosis of the ubiquitinated receptor are impaired (11Lee P.S. Wang Y. Dominguez M.G. Yeung Y.G. Murphy M.A. Bowtell D.D. Stanley E.R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 3616-3628Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Subsequent to CSF-1R ubiquitination, activated CSF-1R is degraded intralysosomally (12Guilbert L.J. Stanley E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 4024-4032Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The degradation of ligand-stimulated CSF-1R normally occurs rapidly, and the half-life of the CSF-1R decreases from 3 h to 5 min upon ligand binding (13Fixe P. Praloran V. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 1997; 8: 125-136PubMed Google Scholar, 14Carlberg K. Tapley P. Haystead C. Rohrschneider L. EMBO J. 1991; 10: 877-883Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Mutation of the tyrosine residue within the c-Cbl binding site (Tyr-969 in human CSF-1R) has been frequently observed in myelodysplasia and acute myeloblastic leukemia (15Ridge S.A. Worwood M. Oscier D. Jacobs A. Padua R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 1377-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). Similarly, the transforming viral homologue of CSF-1R, v-Fms, lacks the c-Cbl binding site. Importantly, re-addition of the c-Cbl binding site to v-Fms decreases its transforming activity (16Mancini A. Koch A. Wilms R. Tamura T. J. Biol.

Src-like adaptor protein family proteins, SLAP and SLAP-2, have an amino-terminal myristoylation signal required for association with cell membranes, closely juxtaposed SH3 and SH2 domains, and a unique carboxyl-terminal region that mediates association with c-Cbl. Both SLAP and SLAP-2 have been demonstrated to function as negative regulators of T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling via a mechanism requiring the c-Cbl binding region (17Loreto M.P. Berry D.M.

In addition to c-Cbl, SLAP-2 associates with the Zap-70 and Syk cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases and promotes their degradation when co-expressed. Recent work has shown that SLAP functions as a negative regulator of the TCR by promoting c-Cbl-dependent ubiquitination of TCR chain ζ and down-regulation of the CD3 complex (17Loreto M.P.

Although SLAP and SLAP-2 have been implicated in the regulation of antigen receptor signaling, SLAP was originally discovered in the context of RTK signaling (24Pandey A. Duan H. Dixit V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 19201-19204Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar) and ectopic expression of SLAP in fibroblasts shown to inhibit platelet-derived growth factor receptor-induced proliferation, suggesting that SLAP may also act as a negative regulator of RTK signaling (25Roche S.

Biol. 2000; 20: 3396-3406Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Both SLAP and SLAP-2 are expressed in lymphoid tissues and cell lines, whereas SLAP-2 is also abundantly expressed in myeloid cell lines such as KG1a, OCI, AML-2, -3, and -5 (27Loreto M.P. McGlade C.J. Oncogene. 2003; 22: 266-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). A recent study by Manes et al. (28Manes G.A. Masendycz P. Nguyen T. Achuthan A. Dinh H. Hamilton J.A. Scholz G.M. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1791-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) demonstrated that SLAP-2 is expressed in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and suggested a potential role for SLAP-2 in CSF-1 signaling. Here we provide evidence that SLAP-2 plays a role in c-Cbl recruitment to activated CSF-1 receptors and consequent down-regulation of CSF-1R signaling by promoting internalization and degradation of activated receptors. Bacterial and Mammalian Expression Constructs—Wild-type SLAP-2 and SLAP-2 mutants have been previously described (17Loreto M.P. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4241-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SLAP-2 G2A contains a point mutation changing amino acid 2 to alanine, SH2* has a point mutation changing the arginine residue at amino acid position 120 to lysine, and in the ΔC truncation mutant a stop codon was introduced such that it lacks the last 70 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. SLAP-2 GST fusion proteins were prepared as previously described (17Loreto M.P. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4241-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). SLAP and SLAP-2 (WT, G2A, and SH2*) constructs were subcloned into the HSC retroviral vector (provided by Dr. James Ellis) at SalI and BamHI sites for use in preparation of ecotropic virus. FD-Fms Cell Culture, Cell Stimulation, and Lysis—Murine myeloid FDC-P1 cells expressing wild-type Fms (FD-Fms cell line) were kindly provided by Dr. Larry R. Rohrschneider (Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center). FD-Fms cells were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO2 in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 5% WEHI cell supernatant (as a source of IL-3). WEHI supernatant was prepared by culturing cells in RPMI 1640 medium and 10% FBS for 7–10 days. Before FD-Fms cells were stimulated with CSF-1, they were starved of IL-3 by washing twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and culturing in DMEM with 10% FBS for 5–6 h. Cells were then suspended at 10–20 × 106 cells/ml in serum-free DMEM and 100 ng/ml rmCSF-1 (R&D Systems) at 37 °C for various times before pelletting and lysis in cold Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0) freshly supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm NaF. Retroviral Infection of FD-Fms Cells—The ecotropic Phoenix packaging cell line (generously provided by Dr. Ian Clarke) was cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS and transiently transfected using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) with the HSC IRES-eGFP retroviral vectors containing wild-type (WT), and mutant forms SLAP-2. Viral particle containing supernatants were collected, and carryover cells/debris was removed by passing through a 45-μm filter (Millipore) and used directly for spin infection of FD-Fms cells. Briefly, 1.5 × 106 FD-Fms cells were suspended in 3 ml of retroviral supernatant supplemented with 8 μg/ml Polybrene (Hexadimethrine Bromide, from Sigma). Cells were centrifuged in 50-ml Falcon tubes at 1800 rpm (650 × g) for 90 min at room temperature. Cells were resuspended, and a second spin was performed. The cells were suspended in fresh viral supernatant plus Polybrene and incubated overnight at 32 °C and 5% CO2. Media was then changed back to DMEM with 10% FBS and 5% WEHI supernatant, and cells were expanded for 4 days. GFP-positive cells were collected using fluorescence-assisted cell sorting, expanded, and resorted as necessary to select comparable levels of WT, G2A, and SH2* SLAP-2 protein levels. Differentiation of FD-Fms Cells—FD-Fms cell lines (HSC, G2A, WT, and SH2*) were washed twice, suspended in DMEM with 10% FBS and seeded at 5000 cells/ml in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2500 units of hCSF-1/ml (provided by Dr. E. Richard Stanley) in 10-ml cultures. Cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using FlowJo software (Tree Star) on day 3 of culture to measure side-scatter (SSC) and CD11b (Mac-1). Cells were incubated with Fc block (anti CD16/32 antibody) prior to incubation with PE-anti-CD11b or isotype control (Rat IgG2b) antibodies. Dead cells were excluded from the analysis by staining with propidium iodide. Preparation and Stimulation of Primary Bone Marrow-derived Macrophages—Primary bone marrow-derived macrophage were prepared from the femur bone marrow of 6-week-old mice. To remove differentiated cells, bone marrow was suspended in RPMI supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen), 5 units of penicillin C/ml, and 5 mg of streptomycin sulfate/ml for 2 h. Adherent cells were discarded, while nonadherent cells were counted, and plated at 1.25 × 105 cells/ml in DMEM with 10% FBS and 2,500 units of recombinant hCSF-1/ml for 7–10 days in 10-cm culture plates. Adherent bone marrow-derived macrophages were starved of CSF-1 for 24 h and stimulated by washing once with serum-free DMEM at 37 °C, and then stimulated for various times in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 100 ng/ml rmCSF-1. Stimulated cells were subsequently lysed in Nonidet P-40 buffer, and soluble protein lysates were used for immunoprecipitations as described. Immunoprecipitation and Western Blotting—Cells were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with complete protease inhibitors and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm (20,800 × g) at 4 °C for 10 min and precleared by incubation with 50 μl of 20% (v/v) protein G-Sepharose beads or with protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma) at 4 °C for 30 min. Precleared lysates were incubated with antibodies (described below) and either protein G- or protein A-Sepharose beads as described above and then incubated at 4 °C with gentle rotation for 90 min. Immune complexes were washed four times in 1 ml of cold Nonidet P-40 wash buffer (Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer with 0.1% Nonidet P-40, without EGTA, and 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5)), and bound proteins were eluted by boiling for 5 min in 2× SDS sample buffer. Eluted proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE on 10% gels. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and incubated in blocking solution for a minimum of 30 min prior to the addition of antibodies. Bound antibodies were detected by using enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (ECL, PerkinElmer Life Sciences). In Vitro Binding Assays and Far Western—GST fusion proteins were expressed in DH5α bacteria and purified on glutathione-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences). In vitro binding assays were done with FD-Fms cell lysates (1 mg/ml) either unstimulated or stimulated with rmCSF-1. Lysates were incubated with 4 μg of GST fusion proteins for 90 min at 4 °C. Following several washes, bound proteins were eluted in 2× SDS sample buffer and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Membranes were stained with Coomassie Blue dye to ensure equal loading of fusion proteins. For the far Western, GST-SLAP-2 was eluted from Sepharose beads by incubating beads in 3 mg/ml glutathione in 50 mm Tris, pH 8.0, then dialyzing in PBS before quantifying. Anti-CSF-1R immunoprecipitates from the FD-Fms cell line were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and transferred to Nitrocellulose (Amersham Biosciences) membranes. The membranes were blocked in TBST (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1% (v/v) Tween 20) with 5% (w/v) skim milk powder for 1 h at room temperature, followed by incubation with 10 μg/ml GST-SLAP-2 in blocking solution supplemented with 10 mm dithiothreitol overnight at 4 °C. Following three 5-min washes with TBST, membranes were incubated with anti-GST antibody in blocking solution for 1 h, washed again, then incubated with protein-A linked horseradish peroxidase for 40 min. Finally, membranes were washed (4 × 5 min and 1 × 10 min) with TBST before ECL detection was used. Antibodies—Polyclonal SLAP-2 was produced as previously described (17Loreto M.P. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4241-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). 10 μl (3 ug) of affinity-purified SLAP-2 antibody was used in immunoprecipitation experiments, and a concentration of 0.3 μg/ml was used for immunoblotting. The following antibodies and conditions were used: anti-phosphotyrosine 4G10 (UBI), 1:1000 for Western blotting; rabbit anti-STAT3 (UBI), 1:1000; anti-phospho-STAT3 (UBI), 1:1000; a 1:1 mix of mouse anti-c-Cbl (clone 17, BD Transduction Laboratories) and clone 7G10 (UBI), 1:1000; rabbit anti-Fms (CSF-1R) (UBI) was used at 2 μl for immunoprecipitation; 1:1 mix of rabbit anti-pY-CSF receptor (CSF-1R) phosphotyrosine 723 and phosphotyrosine 809 (Cell Signaling), 1:1000; rabbit anti-CSF-1R clone C-20 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 1:1000; antiubiquitin (Covance) 1:1000; anti-transferrin receptor (Zymed Laboratories Inc.) 1:1000; anti-GST (UBI), 1:1000; sheep anti-mouse antibody (1:6000 dilution); and protein A (1:3000 dilution) conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were used to detect bound primary mouse monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal antibodies, respectively. Blocking solutions varied according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PE-conjugated anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), rat IgG2b, and anti-CD32/16 antibodies used for flow cytometry were purchased from eBioscience. Subcellular Fractionation—FD-Fms cells (2.5 × 107) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed in 1 ml of hypotonic lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1 mm MgCl2) containing complete protease inhibitors and 1 mm sodium orthovanadate. Cells were passed through a Dounce homogenizer until all cells were lysed, as checked by trypan blue staining. Lysed cells were adjusted back to isotonic conditions by the addition of 5 m NaCl to a final concentration of 150 mm. Lysates were centrifuged at 3,000 rpm (900 × g) for 10 min at 4 °C. The pellet representing the nuclear fraction was discarded. The supernatant from the first spin was centrifuged in a Beckman tabletop ultracentrifuge by using the TLA-45 rotor at 43,000 rpm (100,000 × g) for 30 min at 4 °C. The pellet representing the membrane fraction was resuspended in extraction buffer (1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate) in 10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm MgCl2. The supernatant was adjusted to 0.1% SDS-0.1% Triton X-100/0.1% sodium deoxycholate. Biotinylation of Surface Proteins—FD-Fms cells were stimulated for various times with 100 ng/ml rmCSF-1 (R&D Systems) at 37 °C. After stimulation, cells were cooled on ice for 5 min and washed twice with cold PBS. Cells were then incubated with biotin (EZ-Link NHS-SS-Biotin, Pierce) diluted at 0.2 mg/ml in biotinylation buffer (154 mm NaCl, 10 mm HEPES, 3 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, pH 7.6) for 1 h at 4 °C. After labeling, cells were washed twice with cold PBS, blocked for 5 min in DMEM (10% FBS, 100 mm glycine) at 4°C, washed twice in cold PBS, and lysed in PLC lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1% (v/v) Triton-X-100, 1 mm EGTA (pH 8.0) freshly supplemented with complete protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, and 10 mm NaF). Biotin-labeled proteins were recovered by incubating ∼1 mg of lysate with 30 μl of streptavidin beads (ImmunoPure Immobilized Streptavidin, Pierce) overnight. Beads were washed 4× with PLC wash buffer and boiled in SDS sample buffer. Samples were analyzed by Western blotting against CSF-1R. SLAP-2 Associates with c-Cbl and CSF-1R in Primary Bone Marrow Macrophages and in FD-Fms Cells—To investigate the role of SLAP-2 in CSF-1R signaling, we performed immunoprecipitations from untreated or CSF-1-stimulated bone marrow-derived macrophage cell lysate using anti-SLAP-2 and anti-CSF-1R antibodies. Anti-phosphotyrosine Western blotting revealed that several tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins co-precipitated with SLAP-2 following CSF-1 stimulation compared with pre-immune control serum (Fig. 1A, upper panel). The tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of ∼120 kDa was identified as c-Cbl (Fig. 1A, lower panel). Notably the association of SLAP-2 with c-Cbl was observed in unstimulated cells but was enhanced following treatment with CSF-1. A similar constitutive association between SLAP-2 and c-Cbl has also been observed in primary thymocytes (17Loreto M.P. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4241-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). A tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 180 kDa that co-migrated with the CSF-1R was also observed (Fig. 1A, upper panel), although anti-CSF-1R antibody was not sensitive enough to confirm its identity. A phospho-specific antibody (pY-CSF-1R) directed against phosphorylated tyrosine residues Tyr-807 and Tyr-721 on the activated CSF-1R was able to detect the CSF-1R that was co-precipitated with SLAP-2 (Fig. 1B). Due to a high level of background, and the low level expression, endogenous SLAP-2 could not be detected upon subsequent re-blotting of the SLAP-2 immunoprecipitates (data not shown). To further investigate the role of SLAP-2 in CSF-1R signaling, we utilized the FDC-P1 myeloid cell line, FD-Fms, which expresses wild-type murine CSF-1R (29Rohrschneider L.R. Metcalf D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5081-5092Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 30Bourette R.P. Myles G.M. Carlberg K. Chen A.R. Rohrschneider L.R. Cell Growth & Differ. 1995; 6: 631-645PubMed Google Scholar). Immunoprecipitation of endogenous SLAP-2 from lysates of unstimulated or CSF-1-stimulated cells probed with anti-SLAP-2 revealed bands corresponding to the p28 and p25 forms of SLAP-2 that have previously been described in hematopoietic cell lines and tissues (Fig. 1C, bottom panel) (17Loreto M.P. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4241-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Endogenous SLAP-2 was specifically co-immunoprecipitated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of 120 and 180 kDa following CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. 1C, top panel). Re-blotting identified the 120-kDa band as c-Cbl and showed that C-Cbl associated with SLAP-2 prior to CSF-1R stimulation (Fig. 1C, middle panel). Again, anti-CSF-1R antibody was not sensitive enough to detect the co-immunoprecipitated CSF-1R; however, using the pY-CSF-1R antibody we were able to demonstrate that the CSF-1R is co-precipitated with SLAP-2 in FD-Fms cells (Fig. 1D). To determine which regions of SLAP-2 mediate its association with c-Cbl and CSF-1R, GST-pulldown assays were carried out using lysates from FD-Fms cells. Recombinant wild-type (WT) GST-SLAP-2 associated with tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins of similar size observed in SLAP-2 immunoprecipitates, and subsequent immunoblotting confirmed the identity of c-Cbl and CSF-1R, respectively (Fig. 2B). Similarly, a GST fusion of the related SLAP molecule also bound to c-Cbl and the CSF-1R. In this system, SLAP-2 association with the receptor appeared to be constitutive, whereas SLAP binding to CSF-1R was strongly induced by CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. 2B). In addition, c-Cbl binding to both GST-SLAP-2 and GST-SLAP was strongly induced by CSF-1 stimulation (Fig. 2B). A GST-SLAP-2-ΔC fusion protein, which lacks the entire carboxyl-terminal region (ΔC, Fig. 2A), was unable to associate with c-Cbl, consistent with previous studies that indicated the C-terminal region of SLAP-2 mediates its association with c-Cbl (Fig. 2B, second panel) (17Loreto M.P. Berry D.M. McGlade C.J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 4241-4255Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 19Holland S.J. Liao X.C. Mendenhall M.K. Zhou X. Pardo J. Chu P. Spencer C. Fu A. Sheng N.

This form of SLAP-2 also showed a significant reduction in CSF-1R binding suggesting that this region also stabilizes SLAP-2 binding to the receptor. A mutant form of SLAP-2 with an inactivating mutation in the SH2 domain (Fig. 2A, SH2*) failed to bind CSF-1R (Fig. 2B, third panel), suggesting that the SLAP-2 SH2 domain is required for receptor association in the presence or absence of growth factor stimulation. These observations contradict those of Manes et al., who observed that neither mutation of the SH2 domain nor deletion of the carboxyl terminus had an effect on CSF-1R binding when co-expressed in HEK293T cells (28Manes G.A. Masendycz P. Nguyen T. Achuthan A. Dinh H. Hamilton J.A. Scholz G.M. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1791-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). To address whether the association between SLAP-2 and CSF-1R is direct, CSF-1R was immunoprecipitated from FD-Fms cell lysates and separated by SDS-PAGE, and then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was incubated with purified recombinant GST-SLAP-2 and immunoblotted with anti-GST antibody to detect bound GST-SLAP-2. As shown in Fig. 2C, GST-SLAP-2 bound to a band at the size expected for CSF-1R as well as another slower migrating protein. Subsequent reprobing of the same membrane with anti-CSF-1R confirmed that the bound GST-SLAP-2 overlapped with the CSF-1R signal and suggests that SLAP-2 associates with CSF-1R directly both before and after stimulation (Fig. 2C). SLAP-2 Is Tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CSF-1 Stimulation—When endogenous SLAP-2 was immunoprecipitated from lysates of CSF-1-stimulated FD-Fms cells we observed slower migrating species in addition to the two SLAP isoforms expressed in these cells. (Fig. 3A). Previously we and others (28Manes G.A. Masendycz P. Nguyen T. Achuthan A. Dinh H. Hamilton J.A. Scholz G.M. FEBS J. 2006; 273: 1791-1804Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar) reported that SLAP-2 is phosphorylated on serine residues when ectopically expressed, but tyrosine phosphorylation had not been reported. To test whether the slower migrating SLAP-2 species observed following CSF-1 stimulation is also tyrosine-phosphorylated, SLAP-2 was immunoprecipitated from a cell line engineered to overexpress WT SLAP-2 and immunoblotted with anti-phosphotyrosine (Fig. 3B). A tyrosine-phosphorylated band that co-migrated with the transient higher molecular weight form of SLAP-2 was observed, suggesting that SLAP-2 is transiently tyrosine-phosphorylated upon activation of the CSF-1R. When SLAP-2 immunoprecipitates were incubated with phosphatase, the anti-phosphotyrosine reactivity was lost and accompanied by a change in electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 3C). Taken together, these results suggest that SLAP-2 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated upon CSF-1 stimulation. SLAP-2 Modulates c-Cbl Association and Down-regulation of the CSF-1R—To examine the role of SLAP-2 in CSF-1R signaling and down-regulation, we created FD-Fms stable cell lines expressing wild-type SLAP-2 (WT) or forms of SLAP-2 harboring mutations that disrupt myristoylation (G2A) and inactivate the SH2 domain (SH2*). Stably transduced cell lines (HSC, WT, G2A, and SH2*) were stimulated with CSF-1 at 4 °C (to slow the kinetics of receptor down-regulation), and membrane fractions were isolated and blotted for CSF"
https://openalex.org/W1986861947,"DNA topoisomerase I (Top1) is a nuclear enzyme that plays a crucial role in the removal of DNA supercoiling associated with replication and transcription. It is also the target of the anticancer agent, camptothecin (CPT). Top1 contains eight cysteines, including two vicinal residues (504 and 505), which are highly conserved across species. In this study, we show that thiol-reactive compounds such as N-ethylmaleimide and phenylarsine oxide can impair Top1 catalytic activity. We demonstrate that in contrast to CPT, which inhibits Top1-catalyzed religation, thiolation of Top1 inhibited the DNA cleavage step of the reaction. This inhibition was more pronounced when Top1 was preincubated with the thiol-reactive compound and could be reversed in the presence of dithiothreitol. We also established that phenylarsine oxide-mediated inhibition of Top1 cleavage involved the two vicinal cysteines 504 and 505, as this effect was suppressed when cysteines were mutated to alanines. Interestingly, mutation of Cys-505 also altered Top1 sensitivity to CPT, even in the context of the double Cys-504 to Cys-505 mutant, which relaxed supercoiled DNA with a comparable efficiency to that of wild-type Top1. This indicates that cysteine 505, which is located in the lower Lip domain of human Top1, is critical for optimal poisoning of the enzyme by CPT and its analogs. Altogether, our results suggest that conserved vicinal cysteines 504 and 505 of human Top1 play a critical role in enzyme catalytic activity and are the target of thiol-reactive compounds, which may be developed as efficient Top1 catalytic inhibitors.

Struct. 2004; 33: 95-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 3Leppard J.B. Champoux J.J. Chromosoma (Berl.). 2005; 114: 75-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). This role is dependent upon the ability of Top1 to introduce transient single strand breaks in duplex DNA via the formation of a covalent bond between the 3′-phosphate of the cleaved strand and a tyrosine residue of the enzyme (Tyr-723 in human) (4Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 4805-4809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Within the covalent Top1-DNA complex, rotation of the broken strand around the uncleaved strand results in DNA supercoil relaxation (5Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 6Koster D.A. Croquette V. Dekker C. Shuman S. Dekker N.H. Nature. 2005; 434: 671-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). DNA continuity is then restored by Top1-catalyzed religation of the 5′-hydroxyl termini. Under normal conditions, the DNA cleavage step of the DNA cleavage/religation equilibrium is rate-limiting, which results in the detection of a small fraction of cleavage complexes at any given time (7Champoux J.J. Wang J.C. Cozarelli N.R. Mechanistic Aspects of Type-I Topoisomerases. 1990: 217-242Google Scholar). Top1 poisons, such as camptothecin (CPT) and its analogs, reversibly stabilize the Top1-DNA complex by inhibiting DNA religation (8Liu L.F. Desai S.D. Li T.K. Mao Y. Sun M. Sim S.P. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 922: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 9Pommier Y. Pourquier P. Fan Y. Strumberg D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1400: 83-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (549) Google Scholar). Collision of the stabilized complexes with advancing replication forks leads to the formation of irreversible strand breaks that are ultimately responsible for cell death (10Hsiang Y.H. Lihou M.G. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 5077-5082PubMed Google Scholar, 11Holm C. Covey J.M. Kerrigan D. Pommier Y. Cancer Res. 1989; 49: 6365-6368PubMed Google Scholar). Conversely, catalytic inhibitors exert their cytotoxicity by preventing Top1 binding to the DNA and/or Top1 cleavage, resulting in the inhibition of DNA relaxation. This is the case for DNA binders and DNA intercalators, which presumably prevent Top1 binding by altering the structure of DNA in the vicinity of a Top1 DNA cleavage site (12McHugh M.M. Woynarowski J.M. Sigmund R.D. Beerman T.A. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 2323-2328Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 13Bailly C. Riou J.F. Colson P. Houssier C. Rodrigues-Pereira E. Prudhomme M. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3917-3927Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar), and naphthoquinones, which have been suggested to directly react with the enzyme (14Li C.J. Averboukh L. Pardee A.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2263-2268Google Scholar). Previous studies suggest that Top2α poisoning by β-lapachone and related naphthoquinones may result from the alkylation of exposed thiol residues of the enzyme when it is bound to DNA (15Neder K. Marton L.J. Liu L.F. Frydman B. Cell. Mol. Biol. 1998; 44: 465-474PubMed Google Scholar, 16Frydman B. Marton L.J. Sun J.S. Neder K. Witiak D.T. Liu A.A. Wang H.M. Mao Y. Wu H.Y. Sanders M.M. Liu L.F. Cancer Res. 1997; 57: 620-627PubMed Google Scholar). More recently, Wang et al. (17Wang H. Mao Y. Chen A.Y. Zhou N. LaVoie E.J. Liu L.F. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 3316-3323Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar) reported a correlation between the potency of menadione and related quinones to stimulate Top2-mediated DNA cleavage with their ability to undergo Michael-type nucleophilic addition but not with their reduction potential. Other studies in trypanosomatids and in human leukemia cell lines have also demonstrated the capability of β-lapachone to induce reactive oxygen species that could target Top1 and lead to activation of apoptosis (18Shiah S-G. Chuang S.-E. Chau Y.-P. Shen S.-C. Kuo M.-L. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 391-398PubMed Google Scholar, 19Molina Portela M.P. Fernandez Villamil S.H. Perissinotti L.J. Stoppani A.O.M. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1875-1882Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 20Chau Y-P. Shiah S.-G. Don M.-J. Kuo M.-L. Free Radic. Biol. Med. 1998; 24: 660-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). Several crystal structures of a 70-kDa C-terminal fragment of human Top1 (Topo70) in complex with DNA revealed that the enzyme is a bi-lobed protein that clamps tightly around duplex DNA via protein-DNA phosphate interactions (5Stewart L. Redinbo M.R. Qiu X. Hol W.G. Champoux J.J. Science. 1998; 279: 1534-1541Crossref PubMed Scopus (622) Google Scholar, 21Redinbo M.R. Stewart L. Kuhn P. Champoux J.J. Hol W.G. Science. 1998; 279: 1504-1513Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Top1 activity relies on two essential domains of the enzyme as follows: the C-terminal domain (residues 713–765) containing the catalytic tyrosine and the core domain (residues 215–636) that is connected to the C terminus by a linker region (22Champoux J.J. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2001; 70: 369-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (2218) Google Scholar). Although the paired α-helical structure of the linker domain may be a common structural feature of eukaryotic Top1, the relative lengths and primary amino acid sequence of the linker (residues 637–712) and N-terminal domains (residues 1–215) are poorly conserved among species, and both are dispensable for Top1 activity. Human nuclear Top1 contains eight cysteines (Cys-300, -341, -386, -453, -504, -505, -630, and -733), including two vicinal residues 504 and 505. All cysteines are located in two domains that are essential for Top1 activity (23Gupta M. Fujimori A. Pommier Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1262: 1-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar) and are highly conserved. Thus, we inferred that they may play a critical role in Top1-catalyzed DNA cleavage complex formation and could be the potential target of thiol-reactive compounds. In this study, we investigated whether Top1 cysteines are the target of thiol-reactive compounds such as N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) and phenylarsine oxide (PAO) and whether Top1 thiolation alters enzyme activity. We show that thiolation selectively inhibited the cleavage step of the Top1 reaction, without affecting enzyme binding to DNA. This inhibition was even more pronounced when Top1 was preincubated with the thiol-reactive compound. We show that vicinal cysteines 504 and 505 play a critical role in the PAO-mediated inhibition of Top1 cleavage as this effect was abrogated by mutation of these residues to alanine. Interestingly, the combination of these Cys substitutions did not significantly alter Top1-catalyzed relaxation of supercoiled DNA but conferred resistance to the Top1 poison camptothecin, indicating that these conserved vicinal cysteines are a critical determinant of human Top1 sensitivity to thiol-reactive inhibitors as well as chemotherapeutic agents that stabilize the covalent Top1-DNA complex. Chemicals and Drugs—NEM, PAO, dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO), and camptothecin (CPT) were purchased from Sigma. [α-32P]Cordycepin was purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase was purchased from Invitrogen. Full-length human Top1 was purified as described below or purchased along with pHot1 plasmid DNA from Topogen (Columbus, OH). Human recombinant Topo70 was a kind gift from Dr. Y. Pommier (NCI, Bethesda MD) (24Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Proteinase K was purchased from Roche Applied Science. Plasmids and Yeast Strains—Yeast strain EKY3 (MATα, top1Δ::TRP1, trp1Δ63, leu2Δ1, his3Δ200, ura3-52) has been described (25Woo M.H. Vance J.R. Marcos A.R. Bailly C. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol.

Chem. 2000; 275: 15246-15253Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Yeast cells were transformed and cultured using standard methods. Site-directed mutagenesis of Top1 cysteines was performed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (Amsterdam, Netherlands). Sequences of sense primers (Eurogentec, Herstal, Belgium) used for mutagenesis were as follows (5′ to 3′): GCGGACACTGTGGGCgcCTGCTCACTTCG for C504A, GCGGACACTGTGGGCTGCgcCTCACTTCG for C505A, and GCGGACACTGTGGGCgcCgcCTCACTTCGTGTGG for the double mutant. 125 ng of complementary primers were annealed to 50 ng of the pZIP GFP-top1 plasmid (kind gift from Dr. J. Tazi, Institut de Genetique Moleculaire de Montpellier, France) in the presence of 2.5 units of PfuTurbo DNA polymerase. PCR was performed as follows: denaturation of 30 s at 95 °C followed by 16 cycles of 30 s 95 °C, 1 min 55 °C, and a final extension of 7 min at 68 °C. Reactions were cooled down to 4 °C and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with 10 units of DpnI. One μl of each reaction was used to transform XL1-blue super-competent cells (Stratagene). Transformants were selected on LB medium plates containing kanamycin (30 μg/ml). Purification of plasmid DNAs was performed using the Qiaprep spin miniprep kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Plasmids YCpGAL1-ehTOP1, YCpGAL1-ehtop1N722S, and YCpGAL1-ehtop1Y723F encode FLAG epitope-tagged human wild-type Top1, the CPT-resistant Top1N722S, or the catalytically inactive Top1Y723F under the control of a galactose-inducible promoter (25Woo M.H. Vance J.R. Marcos A.R. Bailly C. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3813-3822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The h prefix, designating human TOP1, is dropped in the following discussions. The FLAG epitope, designated by the e prefix, was included in all TOP1 constructs to facilitate protein purification. The C504A mutant sequences, excised in a BamHI-NheI DNA fragment from top1C504A sequences in pZIP GFP-top1, were first ligated into a LEU-based vector YCpGAL1-top1C504A·L and then subcloned in a BamHI-NotI DNA fragment into the URA3 marked vector YCpGAL1-top1C504A. The FLAG epitope was subsequently introduced in a BamHI-SacII DNA fragment, from YCpGAL1-eTOP1, to yield YCpGAL1-etop1C504A. The vectors YCpGAL1-etop1C505A and YCpGAL1-etop1C504A,C505A were generated by homologous recombination of PCR products amplified from pZIP vectors containing the mutant top1 cDNAs with YCpGAL1-eTOP1 linearized with SphI, as described (27van Waardenburg R.C. Duda D.M. Lancaster C.S. Schulman B.A. Bjornsti M-A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2006; 26: 4958-4969Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). In all cases, mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. Top1 Protein Purification—Full-length human Top1, Top1C504A, Top1C505A, Top1C504A,C505A, and Top1Y723F proteins, all containing an N-terminal FLAG epitope, were partially purified as described (28Woo M.H. Losasso C. Guo H. Pattareool L. Benedetti P. Bjornsti M-A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 13767-13772Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) from galactose-induced cultures of top1Δ yeast cells, transformed with YCpGAL1-eTOP1 vectors. To obtain homogeneous protein preparations, Top1 fractions were applied to an anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma), and the proteins were eluted with an excess of FLAG peptide in TBS (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm KCl). To remove the peptide, the fractions were bound to a phosphocellulose column, and the homogeneous Top1 proteins were eluted in TEEG buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol) plus 1.0 m KCl and protease inhibitors, diluted with 50% glycerol and stored at -20 °C. Protein integrity was assessed in immunoblots as described (25Woo M.H. Vance J.R. Marcos A.R. Bailly C. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3813-3822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Top1-catalyzed Relaxation Assays—Top1 catalytic activity was assessed in plasmid DNA relaxation assays, using pHot1 or pHC624 as substrates. pHot1 reaction mixtures (10 μl each), containing 0.25 μg of supercoiled DNA in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 0.1 mm spermidine, 5% glycerol and NaCl at the indicated concentrations), were incubated with 2 units of human Top1 in the absence or in the presence of NEM for 25 min at 37 °C. For some experiments Top1 was preincubated with NEM for 1 or 5 min prior to the addition of plasmid DNA. Reactions were terminated by the addition of stop buffer (5% Sarkosyl, 0.0025% bromphenol blue, 25% glycerol) and directly electrophoresed in 1% agarose gels. The reaction products were visualized by ethidium bromide staining, and relaxed DNA topoisomers were quantified using SigmaGel software (Jandel Scientific, San Rafael, CA). Plasmid pHC624 DNA relaxation was assessed as described previously (25Woo M.H. Vance J.R. Marcos A.R. Bailly C. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3813-3822Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Oligonucleotide Labeling—High pressure liquid chromatography-purified oligonucleotides used in this study were purchased from Eurogentec (Angers) and are shown in Fig. 2A. 3′-End labeling (Fig. 2B, A*) of the scissile strands were performed as described previously (29Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Briefly, 10 pmol of oligonucleotides were incubated with 3 μl of [α-32P]cordycepin and 1 μl of terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase in labeling buffer (100 mm potassium cacodylate, pH 7.2, 2 mm CaCl2, 200 μm DTT) for 1 h at 37 °C. The reaction mixture was passed through a G-25 Sephadex spin column by centrifugation at 1,000 × g for 5 min to remove the excess of unincorporated nucleotide. The 3′-labeled oligonucleotide was mixed with the same amount of unlabeled complementary strand in annealing buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2EDTA) and annealed by heating the reaction mixture for 5 min at 95 °C followed by a slow cool down at room temperature. Top1-catalyzed Cleavage Assays—Top1-catalyzed cleavage assays were performed as described previously (24Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) using either full duplex oligonucleotides (Fig. 2B, panel a) or partially double-stranded oligonucleotides, referred to as suicide substrates (Fig. 2B, panel b). For each reaction (10 μl each) ∼20 fmol of 3′-labeled substrate was incubated with 0.2 pmol of purified human recombinant Top1 in a buffer containing 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 0.1 mm Na2 EDTA, 15 μg of bovine serum albumin, 0.2 mm DTT, 10 μm CPT (in the case of the full duplex only), with or without thiol-reactive compound for different times at room temperature. In some experiments Top1 was preincubated with the thiol-reactive compound prior to the addition of the DNA substrate. Reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.5% SDS; loading buffer (80% formamide, 10 mm NaOH, 1 mm Na2EDTA, 0.1% xylene cyanol, 0.1% bromphenol blue) was added (3:1), and the samples were resolved in 16 or 20% acrylamide DNA sequencing gels containing 7 m urea. Imaging and quantitation of the cleavage products were performed using a Typhoon PhosphorImager (Amersham Biosciences). Top1 Binding to DNA—Noncovalent binding of catalytically inactive human Top1Y723F to DNA was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay according to previously published procedures (24Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Incubation of Top1 was performed in the presence or absence of PAO for 5 min at room temperature prior to electrophoresis on a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel. Gels were dried, autoradiographed, and quantitated using a PhosphorImager. Top1-DNA Religation Assays—Top1-catalyzed religation assays were performed as described previously using a donor-acceptor system (Fig. 2B, panel c) (24Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Briefly, 3′-end Top1-linked oligonucleotides were obtained following a 10-min incubation of 0.2 nmol of Top1 with 20 fmol of unlabeled 18-mer suicide substrate where the nonscissile strands were 5′-phosphorylated to avoid recombination (29Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). An equivalent amount of 3′-end-labeled single-stranded 23-mer oligonucleotide, complementary to the 5′-end of the nonscissible strand, was then added to the reaction mixture in the absence or in the presence of the thiol-reactive compound. The formation of 37-mer religated products was measured as a function of time. Plasmid DNA Nicking Assay—CPT-induced Top1 cleavage of plasmid DNA was assessed in a DNA nicking assay as described previously (30Knab A.M. Fertala J. Bjornsti M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6141-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Briefly, 0.3 μg of plasmid pblueAK3-1 DNA was incubated with Top1 protein and increasing concentrations of CPT in a final 5% Me2SO in reaction buffer for 30 min at 37 °C. The reactions were terminated with SDS-proteinase K, and the nicked DNA was resolved in a 1% agarose gel containing 2 μg/ml ethidium bromide and 0.1% SDS. Yeast Cell Viability Assays—To assess cell sensitivity to CPT, exponential cultures of top1Δ cells, transformed with the indicated YCpGAL1-eTOP1 vector, were adjusted to A600 = 0.3 and serially diluted, and 5-μl aliquots were spotted onto selective media supplemented with 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.2, 2% dextrose or galactose and 0, 0.005, or 0.05 μg/ml CPT in a final volume of 0.15% Me2SO. Colony formation was assessed following incubation at 30 °C for 3 days. NEM Inhibits Top1-catalyzed DNA Relaxation—To investigate the contribution of the conserved cysteine residues of human Top1 to enzyme catalysis, we first incubated Top1 with NEM, a compound that reacts with protein sulfhydryl groups to form thiol adducts and has been reported to inhibit eukaryotic Top1 activity (31Durnford J.M. Champoux J.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1978; 253: 1086-1089Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Goto T. Laipis P. Wang J.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 10422-10429Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Addition of the–SH group to the olefinic double bond of NEM to form a thioether is a rapid and specific reaction at NEM concentrations of 1–5 mm (Fig. 1A). We first examined the effect of NEM on Top1 catalysis. When added to a plasmid DNA relaxation assay, NEM exhibited a dose-dependent inhibition of Top1 activity (see time 0 in Fig. 1, B and C). Moreover, this inhibitory activity of NEM on Top1 was enhanced when the enzyme was preincubated with NEM, in a time-dependent manner. Top1 activity was completely inhibited by preincubating the enzyme for 5 min with a NEM concentration as low as 0.12 mm. These results suggest the inhibition of Top1 catalysis is a direct consequence of NEM thiolation of sulfhydryl groups in the purified protein. NEM Inhibits the Cleavage Step of the Top1 Cleavage/Religation Equilibrium—To identify which step in the Top1 reaction is impaired by NEM-induced thiolation, a series of 3′-end-labeled oligonucleotide substrates that contained a unique Top1 cleavage site was used in an in vitro assay, which allowed us to assess any effects of NEM on steady-state levels of covalent DNA-Top1 complexes and on the relative rates of Top1-catalyzed DNA cleavage or religation. CPT reversibly stabilizes a covalent Top1-DNA complex by inhibiting DNA religation. The sequences of the oligonucleotides used and experimental design are diagrammed in Fig. 2, A and B. For example, in the scheme of Fig. 2B (panel a), the formation of CPT-induced Top1-DNA complexes with the 37-mer duplex DNA substrate would result in the accumulation of a cleaved 23-mer product. Thus, under steady-state conditions, we can directly assess an effect of Top1 thiolation on CPT-induced covalent complex formation by measuring 23-mer product levels. Indeed, as seen in Fig. 3, A (left panel) and B, NEM inhibited the formation of CPT-Top1-DNA complexes in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, consistent with the relaxation experiments in Fig. 1, preincubating the enzyme with NEM completely abrogated the formation of CPT-Top1-DNA complexes (Fig. 3, A, right panel, and B). Thus, the formation of human Top1 covalent complexes is inhibited by NEM thiolation of sulfhydryl groups. A decrease in covalent complexes can either result from decreased rates of DNA cleavage by Top1 or increased rates of religation, either because of an intrinsic increase in enzyme-catalyzed DNA religation or a decrease in CPT affinity for the covalent Top1-DNA intermediate. To distinguish between these possibilities, we used a DNA substrate containing a truncated scissile strand, which acts as a suicide substrate to uncouple the DNA cleavage from religation reactions of the Top1 catalytic cycle. As diagrammed in Fig. 2B (panel b), cleavage of the 3′-end-labeled 19-mer liberates a 5-mer cleavage product that dissociates from its complementary strand and cannot be religated by the enzyme (24Pourquier P. Takebayashi Y. Urasaki Y. Gioffre C. Kohlhagen G. Pommier Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1885-1890Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 33Svejstrup J.Q. Christiansen K. Gromova I.I. Andersen A.H. Westergaard O. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 222: 669-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar, 34Shuman S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16755-16758Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The lower strand was phosphorylated in order to avoid intramolecular religation (29Pommier Y. Jenkins J. Kohlhagen G. Leteurtre F. Mutat. Res. 1995; 337: 135-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Under these conditions, the kinetics of DNA cleavage was assessed in the absence or in the presence of increasing concentrations of NEM (Fig. 4A), by monitoring the accumulation of the 5-mer product. An approximate 2-fold reduction in the cleavage rate was observed in the presence of NEM, demonstrating that NEM thiolation of Top1 inhibits the cleavage step of the catalytic cycle. Inhibition was drastically enhanced when NEM was preincubated with Top1 prior to the addition of the DNA substrate (data not shown). We next analyzed the effect of NEM on DNA religation using the “donor-acceptor” system diagrammed in Fig. 2B (panel c). In this assay, the unlabeled suicide substrate is incubated with Top1 for 10 min to generate “acceptor” complexes, where Top1 is covalently linked to the 3′-end of the scissile strand (Fig. 2B (panel c)). The “acceptor” complexes are then incubated with a 10-fold excess of a 3′-end-labeled, complementary single-stranded 23-mer oligonucleotide referred to as “donor” molecule, and the amount of 37-mer religated product is quantitated as a function of time. The kinetics of Top1-catalyzed DNA religation were evaluated under these conditions in the absence or in the presence of 2 and 5 mm NEM concentrations (Fig. 4B). The initial slopes (Fig. 4B, inset) did not indicate any difference in the rate of DNA religation, suggesting that NEM does not affect this step of Top1 catalysis. The final levels of religated product reflect the differences in the amount of Top1-DNA acceptor complexes generated in the presence of increasing NEM concentrations. Taken together, these results indicate that the reduction in Top1 cleavage complex formation induced by NEM results from an inhibition of Top1-catalyzed DNA cleavage. Thus, NEM thiolation acts as a Top1 catalytic inhibitor. The Vicinal Thiol-reactive Compound Phenylarsine Oxide Inhibits Top1-catalyzed DNA Cleavage—PAO is a trivalent arsenic derivative that, at micromolar concentrations, selectively cross-links vicinal thiol groups by forming a stable ring structure (Fig. 5A) (35Frost S.C. Lane M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 2646-2652Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 36Gerhard R. John H. Aktories K. Just I. Mol. Pharmacol. 2003; 63: 1349-1355Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). As two of the eight cysteine residues contained in the conserved core and C-terminal domains of human Top1 are vicinal (Cys-504 and Cys-505), we asked if PAO cross-linking of these vicinal thiol groups exerts the same effects on Top1 catalysis as NEM thiolation. Indeed, using the 3′-end-labeled “suicide” oligonucleotide as a substrate, we demonstrated that treatment of Top1 with micromolar concentrations of PAO inhibited enzyme-catalyzed DNA cleavage to the same extent as NEM (Fig. 5B), with an approximate 2-fold reduction in the rate of DNA cleavage in the presence of 0.5 or 1 μm PAO. Moreover, as observed with Top1 thiolation by NEM, inhibition of DNA cleavage was more pronounced when Top1 was preincubated with PAO, with a complete inhibition of Top1 complex formation induced by 0.25 μm PAO (data not shown). These effects were not because of an inhibition of Top1 binding to the DNA substrate as shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (Fig. 5B, inset). In the absence of PAO, incubation of DNA with catalytically inactive human Top1Y723F, which retains its DNA binding properties but cannot cleave DNA, resulted in a mobility shift (Fig. 5B, inset, lane 2). The intensity of this band shift was unaffected by the presence of 1 or 2 μm PAO (Fig. 5B, inset, compare lanes 3 and 4 to lane 2, respectively). Also, no significant effect of PAO on Top1-catalyzed religation was detected, even when high concentrations of the arsenic derivative were used (Fig. 5C). Together, these results suggest that the thiolation of vicinally spaced cysteines within Top1 inhibited enzyme-catalyzed DNA cleavage. NEM- and PAO-in"

In humans as well as Drosophila, perturbation of this complex results in muscular dystrophies and brain malformations and in some cases cellular polarity defects. However, the regulation of the Dg·Dys complex is poorly understood in any cell type. We now find that in loss-of-function and overexpression studies more than half (34 residues) of the Dg proline-rich conserved C-terminal regions can be truncated without significantly compromising its function in regulating cellular polarity in Drosophila. Notably, the truncation eliminates the WW domain binding motif at the very C terminus of the protein thought to mediate interactions with dystrophin, suggesting that a second, internal WW binding motif can also mediate this interaction. We confirm this hypothesis by using a sensitive fluorescence polarization assay to show that both WW domain binding sites of Dg bind to Dys in humans (Kd = 7.6 and 81 μm, respectively) and Drosophila (Kd = 16 and 46 μm, respectively). In contrast to the large deletion mentioned above, a single proline to an alanine point mutation within a predicted Src homology 3 domain (SH3) binding site abolishes Dg function in cellular polarity. This suggests that an SH3-containing protein, which has yet to be identified, functionally interacts with Dg.

The dystroglycan-dystrophin complex contains multiple proteins, including the actin-binding protein dystrophin, the transmembrane protein dystroglycan, and a variety of extracellular proteins, including laminin, agrin, and perlecan (1Davies K.E.

Dg binds Dys at its proline-rich C-terminal end and laminin at its highly glycosylated N-terminal end (2Barresi R. Campbell K.P. J.

In mouse models, loss of Dg in muscle cells causes mild muscular dystrophy phenotypes (6Cohn R.D. Henry M.D. Michele D.E. Barresi R. Saito F. Moore S.A. Flanagan J.D. Skwarchuk M.W. Robbins M.E.

Furthermore, several human forms of MD, such as Fukuyama MD, result from mutations in the enzymes that glycosylate Dg. In addition to its role in maintaining the structural integrity of muscle cell membranes, Dg is also required in the brain. When it is knocked out in the mouse brain, disrupted neural migration and disorganized cortical layers are observed (7Moore S.A. Saito F. Chen J. Michele D.E. Henry M.D. Messing A. Cohn R.D.

This is consistent with the fact that brain malformations as well as learning and memory difficulties are often observed in MD patients (9Martin-Rendon E. Blake D.J. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2003; 24: 178-183Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 10Martin P.T. J. Neurocytol. 2003; 32: 915-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 11Martin P.T.

Neurol. 2004; 17: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Dg is not only important in the pathogenesis of MD and the associated brain malformations, but it also has an important role in cell adhesions and anchoring the cell to the extracellular matrix. Loss of Dg protein has been associated with the progression of various epithelial cancers (2Barresi R. Campbell K.P. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 199-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar, 13Sgambato A. Brancaccio A. J. Cell. Physiol. 2005; 205: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Specifically, Dg is down-regulated in breast and prostate cancers (14Henry M.D. Cohen M.B. Campbell K.P. Hum. Pathol. 2001; 32: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Muschler J. Levy D. Boudreau R. Henry M. Campbell K. Bissell M.J. Cancer Res. 2002; 62: 7102-7109PubMed Google Scholar).In vitro studies have suggested that the interaction between Dg and Dys is mediated by the most C-terminal WW domain binding motif, PPXY, on Dg and the Dys WW and EF-hand domains (16Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27305-27310Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 17Rentschler S. Linn H. Deininger K.

Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In vitro experiments have also shown that when the tyrosine of the PPXY motif is phosphorylated, the binding between Dg and Dys is abolished (19Sotgia F. Lee H. Bedford M.T. Petrucci T. Sudol M. Lisanti M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14585-14592Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Ilsley J.L. Sudol M. Winder S.J. Cell. Signal. 2002; 14: 183-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). This suggests a potential mechanism to regulate the Dg and Dys interaction, in which signaling proteins containing SH2 or SH3 domains may bind to Dg in a tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent manner. In the search for a potential regulator, recent studies have revealed several proteins that interact with Dg. Both the Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) adaptor protein, as well as MEK1, and ERK of the Ras-Raf mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade have been shown to interact, in vitro and in vivo, with the C terminus of Dg (21Yang B. Jung D. Motto D. Meyer J. Koretzky G. Campbell K.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11711-11714Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar, 22Spence H.J. Dhillon A.S. James M. Winder S.J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, Dg appears to be only an anchor for MEK1 and ERK rather than a substrate (22Spence H.J. Dhillon A.S. James M. Winder S.J. EMBO Rep. 2004; 5: 484-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar), and Dg might not have a direct involvement in this signaling pathway. Independently, recent work has revealed that laminin and dystroglycan-dependent phosphorylation of syntrophin affects the Grb2-SOS-Rac1-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway and ultimately results in the phosphorylation of c-Jun on Ser-65 (23Zhou Y.W. Thomason D.B. Gullberg D. Jarrett H.W. Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 2042-2052Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Thus, although studies suggest a clear role for Dg in signaling, the regulation of Dg by signaling and the specific regions of the Dg C terminus involved in this process are unknown.To shed light on the regulation of Dg and its role in signaling, we have analyzed the binding motifs that are required for the function of the Dg·Dys complex in cellular polarity in Drosophila. The proline-rich C terminus of Dg has several potential protein-binding motifs, which suggests that it may be involved in regulating the complex and potentially may have a signaling role. Proline-rich sequences have been shown to be the targets of several protein interaction domains involved in signal transduction. For example, SH3 domains have been shown to bind core PXXP motifs (where P is proline and X indicates any amino acid). Drosophila Dg contains two putative SH3-binding sites, consisting of the core PXXP motif. Proline-rich sequences also serve as targets for binding by WW domains (24Kay B.K. Williamson M.P. Sudol M. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 231-241Crossref PubMed Scopus (1036) Google Scholar). In particular, the class I WW domain ligand, PPXY (where Y is tyrosine), appears twice in the C-terminal region of Dg. The more C-terminal PPXY motif has been established as a binding site for the WW domain of dystrophin in humans (17Rentschler S. Linn H. Deininger K. Bedford M.T. Espanel X. Sudol M. Biol. Chem. 1999; 380: 431-442Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar, 18Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) and in Drosophila by in vitro binding studies (25Shcherbata H.R. Yatsenko A.S. Patterson L. Sood V.D. Nudel U. Yaffe D. Baker D. Hannele Ruohola-Baker D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). The role of a putative second, more N-terminal WW domain binding site or the potential SH3 domain binding sites are not yet understood.Drosophila is an excellent system to study the Dg·Dys complex (25Shcherbata H.R.

Neurosci. 2006; 26: 333-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). In particular, Dg is required for cellular polarity in the oocyte and epithelial cells in Drosophila as well as in mouse mammary epithelial cells (26Deng W.M. Schneider M. Frock R. Castillejo-Lopez C. Gaman E.A. Baumgartner S. Ruohola-Baker H. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 30Weir M.L. Oppizzi M.L. Henry M.D. Onishi A. Campbell K.P. Bissell M.J. Muschler J.L. J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 4047-4058Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Furthermore, Drosophila is a model for the MD disease phenotype, as reduction of dystrophin and dystroglycan in the muscles leads to progressive muscle degeneration and loss of muscle function (25Shcherbata H.R. Yatsenko A.S. Patterson L. Sood V.D. Nudel U. Yaffe D. Baker D. Hannele Ruohola-Baker D. EMBO J. 2007; 26: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). In this study, we test which regions of the Dg C terminus are essential for Dg function in cellular polarity in vivo. Specifically, we show by a single amino acid substitution that a putative SH3 domain binding site is critical for Dg function in both loss-of-function and overexpression studies. However, the most C-terminal WW domain binding site previously shown to be essential for dystrophin binding is dispensable for cellular polarity in Drosophila.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESFly Stocks—Drosophila melanogaster stocks were raised on standard cornmeal/yeast/agar medium at 25 °C. For overproduction of pUASp-Dg in the germ line, we used the following: NGT40; P(w+:nanosGal4:VP-16)Ab-2 (31Tracey Jr., W.D. Ning X. Klingler M. Kramer S.G. Gergen J.P. Genetics. 2000; 154: 273-284Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 32Van Doren M. Williamson A.L. Lehmann R. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 243-246Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Mat-α4-Tub > Gal4-VP16/CyO (33Hacker U. Perrimon N. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 274-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar). For overproduction of pUASp-Dg in embryos we used Daughterless-Gal4 (34Wodarz A. Hinz U. Engelbert M. Knust E. Cell. 1995; 82: 67-76Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (546) Google Scholar). For overproduction of pUASp-Dg in the follicle cells, we used hsFlp; act < FRT-CD2-FRT < Gal4; UAS-GFP (35Pignoni F. Zipursky S.L. Development (Camb.). 1997; 124: 271-278Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). For generation of dystroglycan clones, we used FRT42D-Dg323/CyO (Dg323 is a dystroglycan loss-of-function mutant with a 3155-bp deletion between bp 32,345 and 35,669 of DS03910) (26Deng W.M. Schneider M. Frock R. Castillejo-Lopez C. Gaman E.A. Baumgartner S. Ruohola-Baker H. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) and hsFLP; FRT42D Ubi-GFP/CyO. For overproduction of pUASp-Dg in a dystroglycan mutant background, we used FRT42DDg323/CyO; P(w+ nos-Gal4:VP16)A4-2 III, and hsFLP; FRT42D Ubi-GFP/CyO; pUASp-Dg/TM3 or pUASp-Dg /FM7; FRT42DDg323/CyO, and hsFLP; FRT42D Ubi-GFP/CyO; P(w+ nos-Gal4: VP16)A4-2 III (pUASp-Dg refers to all dystroglycan constructs: FL, C1, C2, 4P, DC2, Pro → Ala, ALLP, AATA).Generation of pUASp-Dg Transgenic Animals—Full-length and truncated dystroglycan PCR products that can be expressed in the germ line were synthesized from the template LD11619 using the forward primer GGGGTACCAACATGAGATTCCAGTGGTTCT in conjunction with one of the following reverse primers: FL, CTCTAGATTATGGCGACACATATGGCGGT; C1, GCTCTAGATTACTTCTCGTCCTTGAGTATGAC; C2, GCTCTAGATTAATATGGCGGTGGCTTCTCGTCCTTGAGTATAGAC; 4P, GCTCTAGATTATGGCGACACAGGTGGCGGT; DC2, GCTCTAGATTAGTCCACGTCGTTGTCAC (Invitrogen) and cloned into pUASp, a vector that allows efficient germ line expression (36Rorth P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 78: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar).To generate a construct with mutated SH3-binding sites (pUASp-2XSH3 knock-out, Pro → Ala), the QuickChange® XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) was used to introduce proline to alanine substitutions in the SH3bsI (PATP → AATA). LD11619 was used as a template with forward primer CGTGGCAAGTCGGCAGCCACGGCCTCTACCGCAAACC and reverse primer GGTTTGCGGTAGGAGGCCGTGGCTGCCGACTTGCCACG, generating the intermediate plasmid pBS-Dg AATA. pBS-Dg AATA then served as a template for PCR with the forward primer GGACGAGAAGCCGGCGCTGCTGCCACCATCCTACAATACC and the reverse primer GGTATTGTAGGATGGTGGCAGCAGCGCCGGCTTCTCGTCC, designed to substitute the first proline of the SH3bsII with an alanine (PLLP → ALLP), thus generating pBS-2XSH3 knockout. This served for the template for standard PCR performed with the forward primer GGGGTACCAACATGACATTCCAGTGGTTCT and reverse primer GCTCTAGATTATGGCGACACATATGGCGGT.PCR products were digested with KpnI and XbaI and cloned into the pUASp vector (36Rorth P. Mech. Dev. 1998; 78: 113-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). The constructs were injected into embryos to obtain at least two independent stable transformant lines.Overproduction of Dystroglycan in the Germ Line, Follicle Cells, and Embryos—For Dg overproduction in germ line cells, balanced pUASp-Dg/P(w+:nanosGal4:VP-16)Ab-2 or Mat- α4-Tub > Gal4-UP16/CyO animals were raised in yeasted vials at 25 °C for 3 days, dissected, and analyzed. For Dg overproduction in the follicle cells, hsFlp; UAS-GFPact < FRTCD2FRT < Gal4/pUASpDg animals were heat-shocked at 37 °C for 1 h, raised in yeasted vials at 25 °C for 3 days, dissected, and analyzed. All pUASp-Dg constructs used were crossed to these three Gal4 drivers to test for proper overproduction of protein and correct localization of protein to the membrane in the germ line and somatic cells. The following pUASp-Dg lines were used for germ line analysis: FL-1, 5; 4P-1, -2, -3, -4; DC2-1, -2; Pro → Ala-1-3; C2-1, 3; C1-1, -2; ALLP-1-3; AATA-1,2,4. For Dg overproduction in the embryo, pUASp-Dg/Daughterless-Gal4 embryos were collected and left for 20 h at 18 °C to develop to stage 13, stained, and analyzed. The following pUASp-Dg lines were used to analyze embryos: FL-1, -2, -4; 4P-1, -3; DC2-1, 3; Pro → Ala-1, -2, -3; C2-1, -5, -10; C1-1, -2. For Dg rescue experiment the following lines were used: FL-1, -2, 3, -5, -6; 4P-1, -3, -4; DC2-2, 3-; Pro → Ala-1-3; C2-1, -3; C1-1, -2; ALLP-1-3; AATA-1,2,4. Importantly, the low level of Dg constructs driven by only one copy of the nanosGal4-driver used in the rescue experiments does not generate significant overexpression phenotypes. Abnormal stage 7-8 clones (severe necrosis, no oocyte, or abnormal Orb staining) were not included in our calculations. For each construct, values for the proportion of ovaries or embryos with mislocalized polarity markers between independent insertion lines were averaged, and average deviations were calculated.Antibody Staining Procedure—Ovaries were dissected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed while shaking on a nutator for 10 min in PBS containing 5% formaldehyde. Embryos were collected in (0.7% NaCl, 0.3% Triton X-100), dechorionated, and fixed for 20 min in (4% formaldehyde, 0.1 m sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.2). Embryos were transferred to a 20-ml scintillation vial containing fixture and 100% n-heptane 1:1 and fixed for 20 min at room temperature on a shaker. Next, the fixture was removed, and an equal amount of 100% methanol was added. The vial was shaken vigorously to rupture the vitelline membrane. Embryos were rinsed with methanol and dehydrated through an ethanol series and rehydrated prior to antibody staining.Ovaries and embryos were rinsed with PBT (PBS, 0.2% Triton X-100) four times (15 min each rinse) and blocked in PBTB (PBT, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 5% normal goat serum) for 1 h at room temperature. The tissue was incubated with primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C and then incubated in secondary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The next day they were rinsed with PBT for 15 min, stained with DAPI (1 μg/ml in PBT) for 10 min, and rinsed with PBT and mounted onto slides in 70% glycerol, 2% n-propyl gallate, 1× PBS. To analyze slides, a two-photon laser-scanning confocal microscope (Leica TCS SP/MP) was used.The following primary antibodies were used at the following designated dilutions: rabbit anti-dystroglycan (1:3000 (26Deng W.M.

Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar)), mouse anti-Orb and anti-Crb (1:20; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank), and rabbit anti-GFP directly conjugated AF488 (1:1000; Molecular Probes). The following secondary antibodies were used at the designated dilutions: Alexa 568 anti-rabbit and Alexa 568 anti-mouse (1:500; Molecular Probes) and 488 phalloidin (1:50; Molecular Probes).Plasmid Construction for in Vitro Analysis and Protein Expression—The WW-EF hand region (DBR) of Drosophila dystrophin was amplified from the template LD11292 using PCR with forward primer GGAATTCCATATGACCATTGGACCACTGCCC and reverse primer CCGCTCGAGTTACTGGTGCTTGGCCGCCTC and cloned between the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites of the His tag expression vector pET-15b (Novagen). Drosophila DBR protein was expressed in Escherichia coli strain BL21(DE3) after induction by 1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside in standard LB medium (Qbio-gene/Bio 101, Inc.). Cell pellets were collected, resuspended in Binding Buffer solution (150 mm MOPS, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mm imidazole), and lysed by a French press. Protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) affinity chromatography. Protein was concentrated using an Amicon ultracentrifugal device (Millipore), and imidazole was removed by dialysis. Purified DBR protein was stored in 50 mm MOPS, pH 6.5, 150 mm NaCl, 400 mm Na2SO4, 10 mm dithiothreitol.The Drk (Dreadlock)-FL gene of Drosophila was amplified via PCR from the template LD12029 with forward primer CCGCTCGAGATGGAAGCGATTGCCAAACACG and reverse primer CGCGGATCCTTATGAATGATATGGCGTCACAT and then cloned into the His tag expression vector pET-15b (Novagen) using the XhoI and BamHI restriction sites. Drosophila Drk protein was expressed in E. coli strain BL21(DE3) after induction by 0.1 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. Cell pellets were collected and lysed by a French press. Protein was purified using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Qiagen) affinity chromatography. Protein was concentrated using an Amicon ultracentrifugal device (Millipore) and imidazole removed by dialysis. Purified Drk protein was stored in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.9, 150 mm NaCl, 150 mm Na2SO4.The DBR of human dystrophin (18Huang X. Poy F. Zhang R. Joachimiak A. Sudol M. Eck M.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 634-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) was expressed as a glutathione S-transferase fusion protein and purified by glutathione affinity chromatography. Five hundred units of thrombin (Amersham Biosciences) were loaded onto the glutathione column with DBR bound, and the column was sealed and incubated overnight at 4 °C to cleave the glutathione S-transferase from the DBR. The DBR was washed off the column and concentrated, and the buffer was exchanged during concentration to the same storage buffer used for the Drosophila DBR.Fluorescence Polarization Experiments—Synthesized dystroglycan peptides (Fig. 5C) were N-terminally tagged with tetramethylrhodamine by Invitrogen Evoquest Services (sequences DmWWbsI, GKSPATPSYRKPPPYVSP; HmWWbsI, KNMPTYRSPPPYVPP; DmWWbsII, PVI-LKDEKPPLLPPSYNT; HmWWbsII, PL-ILQEEKAPLPPPEYSN). Six additional tetramethylrhodamine-labeled peptides were ordered from Genemed Synthesis Inc. (DmWWbsI-pY, GKSPATPYRKPPPpY-VSP; DmWWbsII-pY, PVILKDEKPPLL-PPSpYNT; HmWWbsI-pY, KNMPTYRSPPPpYVPP; DmWWbsI-W, GKSPATPYRKWPPYVSP; DmWWbsII-G, PVI-LKDEKPPLLLPPSGNT; and DmSH3bsII-2A, PVILKDEKPALLPPSYNT). All peptides were over 95% pure based upon high pressure liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry analysis. Fluorescence polarization experiments were performed at 25 °C using a Wallac 1420 Victor3 fluorescence plate reader (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Dystroglycan peptide (200 nm) was incubated with increasing concentrations of dystrophin protein in storage buffer to a final volume of 250 μl. Anisotropy values were measured at an excitation wavelength of 531 nm and an emission wavelength of 595 nm. Dissociation constants (Kd) were determined by plotting millianisotropy versus the concentration of Dys and fitting the data to the equilibrium binding Equation 1, WDgDg=Dg+W+Kd-Dg2Kd2W2-2×Dg×W×Kd+2×Dg×Kd2×DgEq. 1 where Dg is the total concentration of dystroglycan peptide; W is the total concentration of dystrophin protein; WDg is the concentration of dystroglycan-dystrophin complex, and Kd is the apparent dissociation constant for the complex. The assays using phosphorylated peptides were performed with (1:100; phosphatase inhibitor cocktail 2, Sigma) and without phosphatase inhibitors resulting into the same Kd values. This suggests that no obvious effects of contaminant phosphatases were observed in this assay.FIGURE 5Human and Drosophila dystrophin binds both dystroglycan WW-binding sites in vitro (A and B). Fluorescence polarization analysis of human dystrophin binding to 200 nm HmWWbsI (×), HmWWbsII (□), and HmWWbsI-pY (○) reveals binding to all peptides but shows significantly higher affinity for HmWWbsI and HmWWbsII compared with HmWWbsI-pY. B, Drosophila dystrophin binds to both the DmWWbsI (×) and DmWWbsII (□) but shows a significant loss of binding when these sites are mutated in DmWWbsI-W (▪) and DmWWbsII-G (•) peptides. Tyrosine phosphorylation of WWbsI (DmWWbsI-pY) (○) results in reduced binding compared with nonphosphorylated DmWWbsI (×). Bovine serum albumin (BSA; *) binding by HmWWbsI (A) or DmWWbsI (B) serves as a nonspecific protein binding control.

Castillejo-Lopez C. Gaman E.A. Baumgartner S. Ruohola-Baker H. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). The C terminus of Dg contains several putative WW, SH2, and SH3 domain binding sites where signaling proteins may bind and participate in the regulation of the Dg·Dys complex (Fig. 1A) (26Deng W.M. Schneider M. Frock R. Castillejo-Lopez C. Gaman E.A. Baumgartner S. Ruohola-Baker H. Development (Camb.). 2003; 130: 173-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Specifically, Drosophila Dg contains two class I WW domain binding sites, WWbsI and WwbsII; three putative SH2-binding sites, SH2bsI, SH2bsII, and SH2bsIII; and two putative SH3-binding sites, SH3bsI and SH3bsII (Fig. 1A). To analyze the function of each of these potential binding sites, we generated transgenic animals expressing a variety of Dg constructs, in which some of these binding sites are deleted, and we examined their capacity to affect polarity in overexpression and loss-of-function experiments (Figs. 3 and 4). We first generated the C1 construct, which lacks all C-terminal binding sites, and compared its function to full-length Dg (C1, FL; Fig. 1B). The most C-terminal PPPY motif (WWbsI) binds dystrophin (16Jung D. Yang B. Meyer J. Chamberlain J.S. Campbell K.P. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 2007; 26: 481-493Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar). To test the importance of this interaction in vivo in Drosophila, we generated C2, which only contains this PPPY motif (Fig. 1B). When the tyrosine of the PPPY motif is phosphorylated, Dys binding to the Dg C terminus is reduced (Fig. 5) (19Sotgia F. Lee H. Bedford M.T. Petrucci T. Sudol M. Lisanti M.P. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 14585-14592Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). To test whether tyrosine phosphorylation is an important component in the regulation of the Dg·Dys complex in vivo, we generated 4P, in which the PPPY motif (WWbsI) has been altered to PPPP. To analyze the importance of the second WW domain binding site, we generated DC2, which contains the second WW and SH3 domain binding sites (WWbsII and SH3bsII). Finally, to analyze whether the two SH3 domain binding sites are critical, we generated P → A, in which both sites (SH3bsI and SH3bsII) have been disrupted by proline to alanine substitutions (Fig. 1B). The Gal4-UAS system for protein expression was utilized to express the Dg constructs in the follicle cells, the germ line cells, and the embryos. To avoid problems because of positional effects, 2-6 independent lines were generated and analyzed for each construct. The results represent mean values for experiments done with multiple independent insertion lines. All"
https://openalex.org/W2009311932,"The NifL protein from Azotobacter vinelandii senses both the redox and fixed nitrogen status to regulate nitrogen fixation by controlling the activity of the transcriptional activator NifA. NifL has a domain architecture similar to that of the cytoplasmic histidine protein kinases. It contains two N-terminal PAS domains and a C-terminal transmitter region containing a conserved histidine residue (H domain) and a nucleotide binding GHKL domain corresponding to the catalytic core of the histidine kinases. Despite these similarities, NifL does not exhibit kinase activity and regulates its partner NifA by direct protein-protein interactions rather than phosphorylation. NifL senses the redox status via a FAD co-factor located within the PAS1 domain and responds to the nitrogen status by interaction with the signal transduction protein GlnK, which binds to the GHKL domain. The ability of NifL to inhibit NifA is antagonized by the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the N-terminal GAF domain of NifA. In this study we have performed site-directed mutagenesis of the H domain of NifL to examine its role in signal transmission. Our results suggest that this domain plays a major role in transmission of signals perceived by the PAS1 and GHKL domains to ensure that NifL achieves the required conformation necessary to inhibit the 2-oxoglutarate-bound form of NifA. Some of the substitutions discriminate the redox and fixed nitrogen sensing functions of NifL implying that the conformational requirements and/or domain interactions necessary for NifA inhibition differ with respect to the signal input.

The Azotobacter vinelandii NifL regulatory protein is an evolutionary relative of the histidine protein kinases (HPKs) 3The abbreviations used are: HPK, histidine protein kinase; PAS, Per-Arnt-Sim; GAF, cGMP phosphodiesterase, adenylate cyclase, FhlA; GHKL, gyrase, Hsp90, histidine kinase, MutL; ITC, isothermal titration calorimetry; Ni-NTA, nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid.

Kahn D. Nat. Rev. Microbiol. 2004; 2: 621-631Crossref PubMed Scopus (746) Google Scholar, 4Martinez-Argudo I. Little R. Shearer N. Johnson P. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). NifL has domain architecture similar to cytoplasmic HPKs such as NtrB and FixL. It contains two N-terminal PAS domains (5Taylor B.L. Zhulin I.B. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 479-506Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and a C-terminal transmitter region containing a conserved H motif (H domain) and nucleotide binding domain belonging to the GHKL superfamily of ATPases (6Dutta R. Inouye M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 24-28Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (632) Google Scholar) (see Fig. 1). Although the C-terminal region of NifL is homologous to HPKs, NifL does not exhibit kinase activity. In response to signals, NifL tightly controls the activity of its partner protein NifA, a σ54-dependent transcriptional activator, by direct protein-protein interaction rather than by phosphorylation (4Martinez-Argudo I. Little R. Shearer N. Johnson P. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2004; 186: 601-610Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). NifA is not a response regulator, and its ability to interact with NifL is controlled by a regulatory N-terminal GAF domain (7Aravind L. Ponting C.P. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 458-459Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (490) Google Scholar) that is responsive to the binding of 2-oxoglutarate, a potential metabolic signal of the carbon status (8Little R. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28711-28718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 9Martinez-Argudo I. Little R. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 52: 1731-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). It, therefore, appears that NifL has evolved from canonical HPKs to control the activity of its partner by protein-protein interactions rather than by phosphorylation. Discrete domains of NifL are required for its redox and nitrogen sensing functions. The N-terminal PAS domain (PAS1) binds a FAD co-factor that is responsive to redox status (10Zhulin I.B. Taylor B.L. Dixon R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 331-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (344) Google Scholar, 11Macheroux P. Hill S. Austin S. Eydmann T. Jones T. Kim S.-O. Poole R. Dixon R. Biochem. J. 1998; 332: 413-419Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Oxidation of the flavin cofactor results in activation of NifL and consequent inhibition of NifA activity, whereas reduction of the FAD moiety deactivates NifL (12Hill S. Austin S. Eydmann T. Jones T. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2143-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The C-terminal GHKL domain of NifL has a bipartite function. As in the case of bona fide HPKs, this domain binds adenosine nucleotides, although it exhibits neither ATPase nor transphosphorylation activities. The binding of nucleotide to the GHKL domain potentiates the inhibitory functions of NifL and its interaction with NifA (13Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T. Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14Money T. Jones T. Dixon R. Austin S. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 4461-4468Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 15Perry S. Shearer N. Little R. Dixon R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). The GHKL domain is also the target for interaction with the signal transduction protein GlnK, which in its noncovalently modified form interacts with the GHKL domain to convey the fixed nitrogen status (16Little R. Reyes-Ramirez F. Zhang Y. van Heeswijk W.C. Dixon R. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6041-6050Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 17Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol.

Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 812-820Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). The H domain of NifL is predicted to have a similar secondary structure to that of the dimerization and phospho-transfer (HisKA) domains of the HPKs and contains an H box motif signifying an autophosphorylation site. However, the conserved histidine residue in NifL is not essential for signal transduction (19Woodley P. Drummond M. Mol. Microbiol. 1994; 13: 619-626Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Nevertheless it is likely that the H domain plays an important role in signal transmission and interactions with NifA. We have recently identified an arginine residue (Arg-306) adjacent to the conserved histidine in the H motif that is critical for signal transmission within NifL. Substitutions of Arg-306 cause NifL to constitutively inhibit NifA irrespective of environmental cues. We have demonstrated that the phenotype of one such mutation, R306C, is associated with a conformational change that apparently locks NifL in a form similar to the oxidized “on” state so that the mutant NifL protein inhibits NifA even under conditions appropriate for nitrogen fixation (20Martinez-Argudo I. Little R. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16316-16321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We observe that some mutations in the GHKL domain of NifL that substantially reduce ADP binding suppress the phenotype of the R306C mutation. These observations suggest that nucleotide binding may influence the topological relationship of the H and GHKL domains to bring about the conformational changes required to inhibit NifA (20Martinez-Argudo I. Little R. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16316-16321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). The key role of arginine 306 in signal transmission has prompted us to investigate the role of other residues of the H domain of NifL in signal propagation. In this study we have analyzed the properties of 12 amino acid substitutions in the predicted helical regions of the H domain. Our results suggest that this domain plays a major role in signal transmission to influence interactions with NifA. Site-directed Mutagenesis—The A288T and L292I mutations were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). ApaI-BstEII fragments containing the nifL mutations were subcloned into pPR34 encoding wild-type NifL and NifA (13Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T. Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Two further mutations were constructed by PCR using primers MS1 (5′-GGGAAAACCTCGCCGCCCCC-3′) and L307A reverse (5′-GTTGACCGGGCCCTGGGCGCGATGGATGGCGGCGTT-3′) for the L307A mutation and S315A forward (5′-CTGCAGGGCCCGGTCAACCTGATCGCGGCGGCGATGCGCATG-3′) and L2 (5′-GTCGCTGTTCAGGTGGAGG-3′) for the S315A mutation. The remainder of the site-directed mutagenesis was carried out by two-step PCR. The first step consisted of two PCR reactions; one carried out with primer MS1 and a reverse primer containing the desired mutation and the other with a forward primer containing the desired mutation and primer L2. PCR products were purified and used as a template for the second step PCR using the above primers MS1 and L2. The resulting fragments were cut with NotI and ApaI and cloned into plasmid pPR34. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. β-Galactosidase Assays—In vivo activity of NifL and NifA was measured in Escherichia coli strain ET8000 using the reporter plasmid pRT22 which carries a nifH lacZ translational fusion. NifL and NifA were expressed on a second plasmid from a constitutive promoter (13Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T. Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown in 4 ml of NFDM medium (27Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3076-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) supplemented with casein hydrolysate (200 μg/ml) for nitrogen limiting conditions or with (NH4)2SO4 (1 mg/ml) for nitrogen excess conditions. Strains were grown in a plastic vial (internal volume, 7 ml) sealed with a rubber closure for anaerobic conditions. When conditions required aerobiosis, 5-ml cultures were grown with vigorous shaking in 25-ml conical flasks. β-Galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously (15Perry S. Shearer N. Little R. Dixon R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Western Blotting—To obtain protein extracts, cultures containing pRT22 and the plasmid of interest were grown in the same conditions used for β-galactosidase assays. Cells were centrifuged (0.8 units at A600), and the pellet was resuspended in Laemmli loading buffer. Equivalent amounts of proteins were separated by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels and electrotransferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were probed with polyclonal antisera against NifL. Primary antibodies were detected with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibodies. Detection was carried out by staining the membrane with 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphte and nitro blue tetrazolium. Protein Expression and Purification—Plasmids pTJ45, pIM73, and pDB737 were used for overexpression of Nhis6NifL, Nhis6NifL-(147–519), and NifA, respectively (8Little R. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28711-28718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 20Martinez-Argudo I. Little R. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For overexpression of mutant derivatives of Nhis6NifL, an NdeI-BamHI fragment encoding the corresponding mutation was cloned into plasmid pET28b (Novagen). For mutant derivatives of Nhis6NifL-(147–519), an NdeI-BamHI fragment encoding the truncated NifL protein was generated using the forward primer NifL-147 and the reverse primer NifL2 (20Martinez-Argudo I. Little R. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2004; 101: 16316-16321Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Cultures were grown aerobically in Luria-Bertani broth, and expression from the T7 promoter was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to 1 mm. Proteins were purified as described previously (8Little R. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 28711-28718Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 22Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6777-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). Concentrations of NifL and NifA were calculated on the basis that these proteins are tetrameric and dimeric, respectively. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Gel permeation chromatography was performed over a Superdex 200 HR10/30 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris-Cl, pH 7.5, 15% glycerol, 200 mm NaCl, and 20 mm imidazole. Molecular weight standards used for calibration were cytochrome c, carbonic anhydrase, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, aldolase, catalase, ferritin and thyroglobulin. The void volume of the column was determined with blue dextran. Open Promoter Complex Assays—NifA-promoted catalysis of open promoter complexes by σ54-RNA polymerase was used to assay NifA activity and its inhibition by NifL as described previously (15Perry S. Shearer N. Little R. Dixon R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). All experiments contained the following components required for open complex formation; 5 nm template DNA, 125 nm core RNA polymerase, 220 nm σ54, 75 nm integration host factor, and single-stranded competitor DNA (final concentration 2.3 μg/ml). Limited Trypsin Proteolysis—Trypsin proteolysis of NifL was performed in TA buffer (50 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, 100 mm potassium acetate, 8 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol) at 25 °C. Samples were incubated for 5 min before initiating digestion with trypsin (Sigma, from bovine pancreas). The enzyme was diluted from a 0.5 mg/ml stock solution into the reaction at the trypsin:NifL weight ratio indicated in the legend to Fig. 4. At the times indicated, 15 μl of sample was withdrawn and added to microcentrifuge tubes containing 0.3 μg of trypsin inhibitor (Roche Applied Science). An equal volume of gel loading buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, 4% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 20% glycerol, 10% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, pH 8.6) was added, and samples were heated at 100 °C for 4 min before electrophoretic separation on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Densitometric analysis of bands was carried out using SynGene software (Synoptics Ltd). NifL· NifA Complexes—All reactions and washing steps were carried out at room temperature in the following buffer: 50 mm Tris acetate, pH 8.0, 15% glycerol, 100 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm KSCN, 3.5 mm magnesium acetate, 20 mm imidazole, 200 mm NaCl, 50 μm ADP. Hexahistidine-tagged NifL (Nhis6NifL) and mutant derivatives (final concentration, 400 nm) were incubated in 500 μl of buffer containing 50 μl of Ni-NTA magnetic-agarose bead suspension (Qiagen) for 45 min. Agitation was maintained throughout to prevent settlement of the beads. After this incubation the buffer was replaced and NifA (final concentration, 800 nm) added to a total volume of 500 μl. The samples were incubated for 1 h, after which four cycles of washing/buffer replacement involving complete re-suspension of the beads was performed. After final buffer removal, NifL was eluted with 50 μl of 500 mm imidazole solution in 50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl. Samples were run on SDS-PAGE. The gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250, destained with 5% acetic acid and 40% methanol, and subsequently subjected to densitometric analysis using SynGene software (Synoptics Ltd). Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC)—Experiments were performed in a VP-ITC isothermal titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Inc.) at 28 °C in a cell volume of 1.43 ml as described previously (15Perry S. Shearer N. Little R. Dixon R. J. Mol. Biol. 2005; 346: 935-949Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Buffer conditions were 50 mm Tris acetate, 100 mm potassium acetate, 50 mm KSCN, 15% glycerol, 3.5 mm magnesium acetate, pH 8.0. NifL protein samples were dialyzed overnight at 4 °C before ITC, and protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Ligands were titrated from a 250-μl injection syringe into the sample cell, which was stirred at 300 rpm. The heat change for the dilution of the ligand in the absence of protein was measured for each experiment and was subtracted from the measured heat change of ligand binding to protein. Data analysis was performed with the Origin program, provided by MicroCal, using equations and curve-fitting analysis to obtain least squares estimates of the binding enthalpy, stoichiometry, and binding constant (23Wiseman T. Williston S. Brandts J.F. Lin L.N. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 179: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (2447) Google Scholar). Binding stoichiometries were derived on the assumption that proteins and ligand were fully active with respect to binding. Surface Plasmon Resonance (Biacore)—Experiments were performed using a Biacore X biosensor system (Biacore AB). Hexahistidine-tagged derivatives of NifL were immobilized on Ni-NTA biosensor chip surfaces. Nickel was firstly bound to the NTA surface through injection of 20-μl volumes of 500 μm nickel chloride. Proteins for immobilization were introduced to the protein-chip surface at a concentration of 40 nm. Experiments were performed at 25 °C in buffer containing 10 mm HEPES, 0.005% Tween 20, 150 mm NaCl, 25 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4, at a flow rate of 20 μl/min. ATP and 2-oxoglutarate were present concentrations of 3.5 and 2 mm respectively. Sensorgrams were derived by injection of various concentrations of GlnK as indicated in the legend to Fig. 7. The control flow cell contained NifL-(1–284)his6, which does not interact with GlnK (13Söderbäck E. Reyes-Ramirez F. Eydmann T. Austin S. Hill S. Dixon R. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 179-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 17Little R. Colombo V. Leech A. Dixon R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 15472-15481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Kinetic constants were derived using BIAe-valuation 3.1 software. Mutagenesis of the H Domain of NifL—The sequence of NifL located between the PAS2 domain and the nucleotide binding GHKL domain contains an H box motif, similar to that surrounding the autophosphorylation site of the histidine protein kinases (2Wolanin P.M. Thomason P.A. Stock J.B. Genome Biology. 2002; 3 (reviews 3013.3011–3013.3018)Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), with conserved histidine, proline, and hydrophobic residues (Fig. 1). In the HPKs this region constitutes a dimerization domain in which α-helices pack against each other to form a four-helix bundle (24Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar, 25Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). Although this portion of NifL is not annotated as a dimerization and histidine phospho-transfer domain in some of the protein databases, secondary structure predictions using the PSIPRED server (26McGuffin L.J. Bryson K. Jones D.T. Bioinformatics. 2000; 16: 404-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (2777) Google Scholar) suggest that this region comprises two α-helices connected by a turn, similar to that found in the structures of the cytoplasmic region of the Thermotoga maritima HK853 HPK (25Marina A. Waldburger C.D. Hendrickson W.A. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 4247-4259Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar) and the HisKA domain of E. coli EnvZ (24Tomomori C. Tanaka T. Dutta R. Park H. Saha S.K. Zhu Y. Ishima R. Liu D. Tong K.I. Kurokawa H. Qian H. Inouye M. Ikura M. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 729-734Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Identical predictions were obtained with E. coli NtrB and E. coli PhoQ. Hereafter we refer to this region of NifL as the H domain. To shed light on the function of this domain, we made 12 amino acid substitutions (mostly to alanine) in residues corresponding to the helical regions of EnvZ and HK583 (Fig. 1). The activity of the mutant proteins was measured in E. coli using a two plasmid system consisting of a nifHp-lacZ reporter and a second plasmid in which nifL and nifA are expressed from a constitutive promoter. Wild-type NifL inhibits NifA activity in response to oxygen (Fig. 2A, compare open and light gray bars) and fixed nitrogen (Fig. 2A, compare open and dark-gray bars). As shown previously in this system (22Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2002; 184: 6777-6785Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 27Reyes-Ramirez F. Little R. Dixon R. J. Bacteriol. 2001; 183: 3076-3082Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), NifL inhibits NifA activity to a certain extent even under conditions appropriate for nitrogen fixation (anaerobic, nitrogen-limiting growth conditions) as the activity of the reporter is at least 4-fold lower in the presence of NifL compared with NifA alone (Fig. 2, compare open bars marked NifL with those marked as ΔNifL). Mutant proteins appeared to fall into three different classes, (a) a response similar to wild-type NifL to fixed nitrogen and oxygen (mutants F300A, M318A, and to a certain extent, S315A), (b) mutants deficient in the response to oxygen that retain a response to fixed nitrogen (N301A, M338A, and R339A), and (c) mutants substantially deficient in both the redox and fixed nitrogen response and lacking the ability to inhibit NifA activity under anaerobic, nitrogen limiting conditions (A288T, L292I, M296A L307A, L349A, and L352A). All the mutant proteins were apparently stable under the four growth conditions tested, as detected by Western blotting (Fig. 2B). Redox-insensitive Mutants—The in vivo properties of the N301A, M338A, and R339A mutants suggest that they are defective in signaling the redox status but remain competent to inhibit NifA in response to fixed nitrogen. Whereas N301A and M338A were totally defective in redox sensing and partially defective in the nitrogen response, R339A retained some response to oxygen (∼50%) but remained fully responsive to fixed nitrogen (Fig. 2A). N-terminal histidine tagged derivatives of the mutant proteins were overexpressed and purified and compared with the biochemical properties of wild-type NifL. Spectroscopic measurements revealed that all three mutant proteins had a similar FAD content to that of the wild-type NifL (∼3 FAD/mol (12Hill S. Austin S. Eydmann T. Jones T. Dixon R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 2143-2148Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar)) (Table 1) with an adsorption maxima at 445 nm that was bleached upon reduction with sodium dithionite (data not shown). These properties suggest that the N301A, M338A, and R339A mutants are not defective in flavin binding or perception of the redox signal but are apparently unable to couple signals sensed by the PAS1 domain to the inhibition of NifA activity.TABLE 1Flavin content and association state of mutant and wild-type NifL proteinsProteinMol of FAD1aExpressed as mol of FAD·mol of tetramer-1 using a molar absorption co-efficient of 12,250 m-1·cm-1 for NifL-bound FAD (11).Retention volumebGel permeation chromatography on Superdex 200 as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Apparent molecular masscCalculated from gel permeation chromatography.Association statedThe subunit molecular masses of N6hisNifL and Nhis6NifL-(147-519) are 59,991 and 43,514 respectively.mlkDaN6hisNifL2.711.82208,912TetramerN6hisNifL-N301A3.111.80211,084TetramerN6hisNifL-M338A3.811.71221,141TetramerN6hisNifL-R339A2.911.70222,288TetramerN6hisNifL-A288T2.9NDNDN6hisNifL-L292I3.1NDNDN6hisNifL-L307A3.1NDNDNhis6NifL-(147-519)ND13.3183,428DimerNhis6NifL-(147-519)-N301AND13.4378,884DimerNhis6NifL-(147-519)-M338AND13.4378,884DimerNhis6NifL-(147-519)-R339AND13.2486,199DimerNhis6NifL-(147-519)-A288TND13.1092,019DimerNhis6NifL-(147-519)-L292IND13.3382,653DimerNhis6NifL-(147-519)-L307AND13.3183,428Dimera Expressed as mol of FAD·mol of tetramer-1 using a molar absorption co-efficient of 12,250 m-1·cm-1 for NifL-bound FAD (11Macheroux P.

Open table in a new tab In the presence of adenosine nucleotides, NifL is competent to inhibit NifA irrespective of the redox state of the PAS1 domain, and indeed truncated forms of NifL lacking the PAS1 domain retain the ability to inhibit NifA when ADP is present (12Hill S.

To examine whether N301A, M338A, and R339A mutant proteins exhibit this activity, we measured their ability to inhibit the formation of open promoter complexes by NifA. These assays quantitate the formation of heparin-resistant σ54-RNA polymerase promoter complexes catalyzed by NifA, with GTP as the donor for nucleotide hydrolysis and ADP (50 μm) added as an effector of NifL. Surprisingly, N301A and R339A were more effective than wild type in this assay and exhibited greater inhibition of NifA activity at substoichiometric NifL: NifA ratios. M338A inhibited NifA activity to the same extent as wild-type NifL (Fig. 3A). Thus, the three mutant proteins retain the capacity to interact with NifA under these conditions. Although the data in Fig. 3A imply that the N301A, M338A, and R339A mutants retain the response to ADP, we considered the possibility that mutations in the H domain could influence the affinity of this nucleotide for the GHKL domain. We, therefore, investigated the binding of ADP to the mutant proteins using isothermal ITC. For M338A and R339A the calorimetric titration gave a best fit to single site model with a stoichiometry of 1 and a KD similar to wild-type NifL (∼20–25 μm) (Table 2). However, in the case of N301A, the binding constant for ADP was lower than wild-type (∼11 μm), perhaps explaining why this mutant form is more effective than NifL in inhibiting NifA in the presence of ADP.TABLE 2Thermodynamic parameters for ADP binding to NifL and mutant proteins determined by ITCProteinKDStoichiometryΔHμmnCal·mol-1N6hisNifL24.7 ± 2.50.95 ± 0.070-13,870 ± 1311N6hisNifL-N301A10.8 ± 0.81.081 ± 0.016-10,130 ± 210N6hisNifL-M338A23.0 ± 3.31.0 (fixed)-16,130 ± 874N6hisNifL-R339A20.2 ± 0.70.98 ± 0.007-11,280 ± 116 Open table in a new tab The response of NifA to NifL is controlled by the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the GAF domain of the activator. The ability of ADP to activate inhibition by the reduced form of NifL is antagonized by the binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the GAF domain of NifA, thus enabling the activator to escape inhibition by NifL under conditions appropriate for nitrogen fixation (8Little R.

When Gγ1, -2, -4, -10, -11, -12, and -13 were expressed in HEK293 cells they were completely processed according to the current understanding of the prenylation reaction. In contrast, Gγ5 was processed to two forms; a minor one, fully processed as predicted, and a major one that was prenylated without further processing. When the Ca1a2X motif of Gγ5, CSFL, was exchanged for that of Gγ2, CAIL, Gγ5 was completely processed. Conversely, Gγ2-SFL was incompletely processed. Differential processing of Gγ5 was found due to the presence of an aromatic amino acid in its Ca1a2X motif. Retrieving endogenous Gγ subunits from HEK293 or Neuro-2a cells with FLAG-Gβ constructs identified multiple Gγ subunits by mass spectrometry in either cell, but in both cases the most prominent one was Gγ5 expressed without C-terminal processing after prenylation. This work indicates that post-prenylation reactions can generate multiple products determined by the C-terminal Ca1a2X motif.

These include a number of proteins affecting cell growth, including the Ras and Rho proteins, numerous other small GTPases, many phosphatases and kinases, the nuclear lamins A and B, and all of the Gγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins involved in cell signaling. The role of prenylation in protein function appears to be multiple and complex; it affects membrane localization, intracellular trafficking, and protein-protein interactions. In general, prenylated proteins require correct processing to mediate their biological functions (7Kato K. Cox A.D. Hiska M.M. Graham S.M. Buss J.E. Der C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Protein prenylation is catalyzed by one of three prenyl transferases that adds either a farnesyl or a geranylgeranyl group to a Cys residue four amino acids from the C terminus of target proteins (1Glomset J.A. Farnsworth C.C. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1994; 10: 181-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 5Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev.

Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar). In yeast, there are two prenyl proteases, Rce1 and Afc1/Ste24 (13Boyartchuk V.L. Ashby M.N. Rine J. Science. 1997; 275: 1796-1800Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), each with fairly broad specificity (14Trueblood C.E. Boyartchuk V.L. Picologlou E.A. Rozema D. Poulter D. Rine J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 4381-4392Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In vertebrates, Rce1 appears responsible for most proteolysis of prenyl proteins (15Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B.

Fong L.G. Michaelis S. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 46: 2531-2558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Finally, the new C terminus of the protein is carboxymethylated (5Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 407-412Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 6Wright L.P. Philips M.R. J.

The involvement of prenylated proteins in the regulation of cell growth, their relatively low number, and the specialized enzymology of this modification have resulted in all three steps in this enzymatic cascade being targeted for production of anticancer drugs (5Winter-Vann A.M.

J. Cell Sci. 2006; 119: 3265-3272Crossref PubMed Scopus (136) Google Scholar). Prenyl transferase inhibitors are currently in Phase III clinical trials, with both advantages and disadvantages. They appear to be promising for treatment in a number of tumors, but they have lower efficacy, particularly for solid tumors, than first envisioned (19Basso A.D. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. J. Lipid Res. 2005; 47: 15-31Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar), and alternative strategies have been suggested for their use, such as adjunct treatment with other cancer drugs (22Rowinsky E.K. J. Clin. Oncol. 2006; 19: 2981-2984Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). One issue with the further development of these drugs is that their relevant substrates have turned out to be ambiguous and difficult to determine. For example, it is uncertain that the Ras proteins for which the drugs were originally designed are related to the pharmacological effects of these drugs (23Sebti S.M. Der C.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2003; 3: 945-951Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). Another issue is that the complex enzymology involved seems to include effects of inhibitors causing a switch in the biological targets of different enzymes (24Whyte D.B. Kirschmeier P. Hockenberry T.N. Nunez-Oliva I. James L. Catino J.J. Bishop W.R. Pai J-K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 14459-14464Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (728) Google Scholar). An alternative strategy for future therapies using prenyl transferase inhibitors is the development as adjunct therapy drugs targeting the carboxymethylation and proteolysis steps (5Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 407-412Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). The mammalian Rce1 enzyme that catalyzes proteolysis of the C terminus of prenyl proteins is a unique metalloprotease primarily targeting prenylated proteins (25Pei J. Grishin N.V. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 275-277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In general, it is thought to target most or all naturally occurring prenylated proteins, and a recent review identified no significant or important exceptions to this (5Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 407-412Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Deletion of this enzyme is lethal during embryonic development or shortly after birth (15Kim E. Ambroziak P. Otto J.C. Taylor B. Ashby M. Shannon K. Casey P. Young S.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 8383-8390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar), indicating the importance of this reaction. Undoubtedly, the successful development of Rce1 as a therapeutic target, as has proved true for the farnesyl/geranylgeranyl transferase inhibitors (5Winter-Vann A.M. Casey P.J. Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2005; 5: 407-412Crossref Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 19Basso A.D. Kirschmeier P. Bishop W.R. J.

Previously, we found that Gγ5 associated with purified bovine brain G proteins is largely unprocessed by either proteolysis or carboxymethylation after prenylation (26Cook L.A. Schey K.L. Wilcox M.D. Dingus J. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12280-12286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The significance of this observation has remained unclear, however, and this processing pattern has been perceived as likely explained by isolation of a precursor or an abnormally processed protein. Here, we have investigated the origin and significance of this unprocessed protein after expression of G protein subunits in mammalian cells. Materials—FLAG-Gγ and FLAG-Gβ constructs in pcDNA3 were recently described (27Dingus J. Wells C.A. Campbell L. Cleator J.H. Robinson K. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and corresponded to human (γ1, γ4, γ12, and γ13), bovine (γ2) or rat (γ5) sequences. FLAG-tagged γ5 and γ2 were further modified using the QuikChange kit (Stratagene) to generate chimeras by swapping the three C-terminal residues of each isoform: Gγ5-AIL and Gγ2-SFL. Finally, a series of FLAG-tagged γ5 constructs were generated with QuikChange substituting codons for all combinations of aromatic amino acids into the aliphatic positions within the Ca1a2X motif (Table 1). The sequence of all constructs was verified by complete DNA sequencing of the final insert.TABLE 1Primers for FLAG-Gγ C-terminal mutations and chimeraConstructPrimer sequence (forward)Gγ2GG GAG AAG AAG TTT TTC TGT GCT ATC CTT TAA GTCTTCAGGAGGGγ2-(SFL)GG GAG AAG AAG TTT TTC TGT TCC TTT TTG TAA GTCTTCAGGAGGGγ5-C AGA CCC CAG AAA GTC TGC TCC TTT TTG TAG TCATATATCTCGAGGGγ5-(AIL)-- --- CCC CAG AAA GTC TGC GCT ATC CTT TAG TCATATATCTCGGγ5 (AFL)-- --- -CC CAG AAA GTC TGC GCA TTT TTG TAG TCATATATCTCGAGGGγ5 (SIL)-C AGA CCC CAG AAA GTC TGC TCC ATT TTG TAG TCATATATCTCGGγ5 (SYL)-- --- CCC CAG AAA GTC TGC TCC TAT TTG TAG TCATATATCTCGAGGGγ5 (SWL)-C AGA CCC CAG AAA GTC TGC TCC TGG TTG TAG TCATATATCTCGGγ5 (YIL)-C AGA CCC CAG AAA GTC TGC TAT ATT TTG TAG TCATATATCTCGAGGGγ5 (WIL)-C AGA CCC CAG AAA GTC TGC TGG ATT TTG TAG TCATATATCTCGAGGGγ5 (FIL)-C AGA CCC CAG AAA GTC TGC TTT ATT TTG TAG TCATATATCTCGAGG Open table in a new tab Cell Culture and Transfection—HEK293 and Neuro-2a cells were obtained from ATCC and grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (MediaTech) supplemented with l-glutamine, pyruvate, non-essential amino acids, and 10% fetal bovine serum. One day prior to transfection, cells were plated onto 100-mm diameter dishes (3.5 × 106 cells/dish). Co-transfection with cDNA for all three subunits (αi1, 3 μg; β1, 3 μg; and FLAG-γ, 12 μg), was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Post-transfection cells (40–48 h) were rinsed twice with phosphate-buffered saline without calcium or magnesium (MediaTech) and scraped into 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes with 1 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (800 × g, 10 min, 4 °C), and the supernatant was removed prior to snap freezing in liquid nitrogen. Immunoprecipitation—Frozen cell pellets were thawed on ice before addition of 600 μl of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 2.5 mm MgCl2, 10 μm GDP, 5 mg/ml DNase I, 10 mg/ml RNase A, 1× protease mixture mix 1 (Calbiochem), 1% cholate) and incubation for 1 h at 4 °C in a rotating mixer. Lysate was then centrifuged for 15 min (16,000 × g, 4 °C), and the supernatant transferred to a new tube. FLAG monoclonal antibody-conjugated agarose beads (Sigma, 10 μl of 50% slurry) were added, and the mixture was incubated for 3 h while rotating at 4 °C. Beads were precipitated by 10-s centrifugation at 300 rpm in a microcentrifuge, the supernatant removed, and the beads were washed twice with cold Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl) and twice with cold H2O. Bound proteins were eluted with 70% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (50 μl). MALDI-MS—Eluted FLAG-tagged proteins were concentrated by vacuum spin drying to <1 μl volume and resuspended with 5 μl of 50% acetonitrile/0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The matrix (sinapinic acid, 10 mg/ml) was solubilized with acetonitrile-trifluoroacetic acid. Protein mass standards (Calibration mixture 3, Applied Biosystems) were mixed with the matrix, and both matrix alone and matrix with calibrant were pre-spotted for each sample and allowed to fully air dry. Each protein sample (1 μl) was mixed with matrix (1 μl), and 0.5 μl of protein-matrix mixture was applied to both the matrix and calibration mixture dried spots to obtain spectra with internal and external calibration.

Calibration was performed using the two closest neighbors bracketing the mass of the sample. Observed values are reported with mass to charge ratio (m/z) of singly protonated proteins (M+H)+. Immunoblots—One microliter of concentrated eluted protein sample was dried down and resuspended in SDS sample buffer. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE on 8–16% gradient Tris-HCl gels (Bio-Rad Criterion gel) and transferred to 0.1 μm of nitrocellulose. Membranes were incubated with FLAG polyclonal antibody (1:5,000, Sigma) for 1 h, washed four times with Tris-buffered saline/Tween 20, and incubated with secondary anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody (1:20,000) for 30 min. ECL was performed using the Pierce West-Femto Super-Signal, and images were captured on a Bio-Rad FluorImager. Mass spectrometry (MS) has proven to provide an effective approach for characterizing the post-translational modifications of the Gγ subunits of the heterotrimeric G proteins purified from brain (11Cook L.A.

Gγ subunits were expressed as FLAG-tagged proteins in HEK293 cells and isolated by immunoprecipitation on anti-FLAG beads after detergent solubilization of cell pellets. Although expression and recovery after FLAG immunoprecipitation were variable, as evaluated on FLAG immunoblots (Fig. 1, IP), all the expressed proteins generated robust MALDI-TOF MS signals (Fig. 2). Samples from cells expressing FLAG-Gγ1 (Fig. 2A), FLAG-Gγ2 (Fig. 2E), FLAG-Gγ4 (Fig. 2B), FLAG-Gγ12 (Fig. 2C), and FLAG-Gγ13 (Fig. 2D) all generated MS spectra containing a single very prominent mass in the 8- to 10-kDa mass range characteristic of singly charged FLAG-Gγ proteins. In contrast, precipitates from control pcDNA-transfected cells generated no appreciable signal in this mass range (data not shown). The average masses observed in repeated independently isolated samples were characteristic of the Gγ isoform expressed, had errors (S.D.) of 1.6 Da or less, and were within 1.1 Da or less (113 parts per million; range 45–190 ppm) of the predicted mass of the correct subunit isoform modified as expected from past studies of prenylated proteins (Fig. 2). Thus, FLAG-Gγ1 had a mass compatible with that of a farnesylated protein, whereas all of the others had masses compatible with geranylgeranylated proteins, as predicted by their C-terminal Ca1a2X sequence. Additionally, all of the masses were compatible with those of a FLAG-tagged protein with an acetylated N terminus.FIGURE 2MALDI-TOF spectra of FLAG-Gγ isoforms expressed in HEK293 cells. HEK293 cells were transfected as described in Fig. 1 with FLAG-Gγ cDNAs. Detergent lysates were prepared and used to recover FLAG-tagged proteins for MALDI-TOF MS, as also described in Fig. 1. Masses reported are based on measurements with internal calibrants and are reported as mean ± S.D. of data from three independent experiments. Also indicated in each panel is the structure of the predicted or most probably modified protein corresponding to the major peak in the spectrum. The cDNAs expressed corresponded to FLAG-Gγ1(A), FLAG-Gγ4(B), FLAG-Gγ12 (C), FLAG-Gγ13 (D), FLAG-Gγ2(E), and FLAG-Gγ2-SFL (F). The most prominent mass (peak a) corresponded, within <1 Da, to Ac-FLAG-Gγ2-(gg)-SFL without proteolytic loss of the three terminal amino acids. The other masses detected corresponded to: peak b, the unacetylated version of peak a with predicted mass of 9176.6 and observed mass of 9176.0; peak c, the acetylated protein expressed without further processing with expected mass of 8937.3 and observed mass of 8938.1; peak d, the fully processed Ac-FLAG-Gγ2-(gg)-OCH3 with predicted mass of 8876.3 and observed mass of 8876.8; and peak e, an expressed Ac-FLAG-Gγ2 that has been cleaved prior to the prenylated Cys with predicted mass of 8486.6 and observed mass 8488.5. G, FLAG-Gγ5. Mass in peak a corresponds to the previously observed FLAG version of Gγ5 without proteolytic processing of the prenyl signal and with the structure Ac-FLAG-Gγ5-Cys(gg)-SFL. Peak b corresponds to the Gγ5 processed as predicted and with observed mass of 8294.4 and predicted mass of 8294.6. H, FLAG-Gγ5-AIL.

The predicted FLAG-Gγ5 should have a mass of 8294.6, but the most prominent signal had an m/z ratio of 8628.0 ± 1.1 (Fig. 2G, peak a). This corresponds to the predicted mass of 8628.0 for the FLAG-tagged version of a Gγ5 protein prenylated with a geranylgeranyl moiety but lacking the expected C-terminal proteolysis and carboxymethylation. Such aGγ5 protein was previously characterized in bovine brain G proteins (26Cook L.A. Schey K.L. Wilcox M.D. Dingus J. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12280-12286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Just as in that case, there was a minor peak (Fig. 2G, peak b) at 8294.4 m/z that was compatible with the protein processed as predicted. The similarity of the spectrum in Fig. 2G to that previously found for bovine brain G protein Gγ5 suggests that differential proteolysis of the C terminus of Gγ5is a characteristic of the processing of this protein in mammalian cells. An initial hypothesis was that this processing pattern depended directly on the C-terminal Ca1a2X prenylation sequence of the protein. To test this possibility, we expressed a chimeric FLAG-Gγ5 protein containing the Ca1a2X sequence from Gγ2 (CAIL) instead of its parent sequence (CSFL). This chimeric FLAG-Gγ5-AIL protein generated a single prominent peak (Fig. 1H) characteristic of the predicted processed Gγ5 protein, which was geranylgeranylated with proteolysis of AIL and carboxymethylation of the new C terminus. In contrast, expression of a chimeric FLAG-Gγ2-SFL construct generated multiple peaks (Fig. 2F), the most prominent of which (peak a) was within 1 Da (33 ppm) of the geranylgeranylated protein lacking C-terminal proteolysis and carboxymethylation. Another mass (peak d), as with Gγ5, was compatible with correctly processed Gγ2, suggesting that the -SFL sequence of Gγ5 is weakly processed by Rce1. Whereas expressed FLAG-Gγ5 has a primary mass indicative of prenylation without further processing (Figs. 2G and 3A), the FLAG-Gγ5-AIL chimera is processed normally (Figs. 2H and 3B). This indicates that the Gγ5Ca1a2X sequence determines the susceptibility of the protein to proteolysis by Rce1. Gγ5 has the hydrophilic amino acid Ser at position a1 of its Ca1a2X sequence instead of an aliphatic amino acid. To determine if this Ser determines susceptibility to proteolysis we tested a mutant FLAG-Gγ5-AFL construct (Fig. 3C), which was also found to be insensitive to proteolysis by Rce1. Thus, the presence of a hydrophilic amino acid at position a1 does not seem to account for differential processing by Rce1; a conclusion supported also by the observation that two other Gγ subunits, γ4 and γ13, which are processed normally (Fig. 2, B and D), contain a threonine in that position. More significantly, the Ca1a2X sequence of Gγ5 differs from that of all other Gγ subunit isoforms in that it contains an aromatic amino acid at position a2 (CSFL) instead of a canonical aliphatic amino acid. In contrast to unmodified Gγ5 (Fig. 3A) ending in -SFL, the -SIL mutant (Fig. 3D) was correctly processed, as was the protein ending in the native Gγ2 -AIL sequence (Fig. 3B). This indicates that it is the Phe in the Gγ5Ca1a2X motif that is responsible for poor proteolytic processing by Rce1. Replacing the Phe at a2 with either Tyr (Fig. 3E) or Trp (Fig. 3F) also generated a Gγ5 protein resistant to Rce1 proteolysis. Finally, the effect of an aromatic amino acid in the Ca1a2X motif was not unique to the a2 position but also resulted from any aromatic amino acid in the a1 position (Fig. 3, G–I). Thus, any aromatic amino acid (Phe, Tyr, or Trp) at either the a1 or a2 position in the Ca1a2X sequence resulted in expression of a protein that was prenylated without further C-terminal processing. Interestingly, most (but not all) of these point mutants showed more complete suppression of the C-terminal processing than was even found in the case of the unmodified -SFL sequence. Most, in fact, lacked any evidence of production of a processed protein. The data in Figs. 2 and 3 were generated with Gγ constructs containing a FLAG epitope tag. To substantiate that the results obtained were not dependent upon the epitope tag, an alternative expression strategy was used whereby untagged Gγ constructs were co-expressed with FLAG-Gβ1 (Fig. 4). In the case of Gγ2, once again, FLAG immunoprecipitation generated a single prominent peak with a singly charged m/z of 7750.1 consistent with the predicted N- and C-terminal modifications (Fig. 4C) previously observed for native bovine brain Gγ2 (31Wilcox M.D. Schey K.L. Busman M. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 212: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Co-expression of Gγ5 with FLAG-Gβ1 resulted in recovery of a primary peak of 7502.1 corresponding to prenylated Gγ5 without further C-terminal processing, but with correct N-terminal processing (Fig. 4C), as reported previously (26Cook L.A. Schey K.L. Wilcox M.D. Dingus J. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12280-12286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). A second, less prominent peak, was also observed at 7168.7 that corresponded to the fully processed Gγ5 with a predicted mass of 7168.4, as also had been previously observed (26Cook L.A. Schey K.L. Wilcox M.D. Dingus J. Hildebrandt J.D. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 12280-12286Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). In fact, all of the remaining Gγ constructs characterized in Fig. 2, when expressed as untagged proteins in the presence of Gβ1, generated a primary mass very consistent with that predicted for both correct N- and C-terminal processing (Fig. 4C). These results substantiate correct processing of multiple forms of expressed Gγ isoforms and their functional formation of a Gβγ dimer based upon co-immunoprecipitations with FLAG-Gβ1. Although the data in Fig. 4 indicated preferential association of expressed FLAG-Gβ1 with co-expressed Gγ constructs, the spectra obtained often had minor masses that seemed to be compatible with predicted masses of processed Gγ isoforms. When FLAG-Gβ isoforms were expressed without an associated Gγ construct in HEK293 cells, mass spectra of FLAG immunoprecipitation samples showed numerous peaks in the Gγ subunit range, at least for Gβ1–Gβ4 (Fig. 5, A–D). In contrast, as reported by others (32Snow B.E. Krumins A.M. Brothers G.M. Lee S.F. Wall M.A. Chung S. Mangion J. Arya S. Gilman A.G. Siderovski D.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Biochemistry. 2005; 44: 11882-11890Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), FLAG-Gβ5 failed to form stable dimers with any proteins in this mass range (Fig. 5E). The distinct signals found associated with Gβ1–Gβ4 were generally consistent with one another and had average masses compatible with expression of multiple Gγ proteins processed as predicted, including, in particular, Gγ5, Gγ10, Gγ11, and Gγ12 (Fig. 5G). Of these, the one that appeared to be different"
https://openalex.org/W2016417841,"RUNX1 (AML1, CBFα2, PEBP2αB) is a transcription factor essential for the establishment of the hematopoietic stem cell. It is generally thought that RUNX1 exists as a monomer that regulates hematopoietic differentiation by interacting with tissue-specific factors and its DNA consensus through its N terminus. RUNX1 is frequently altered in human leukemia by gene fusions or point mutations. In general, these alterations do not affect the N terminus of the protein, and it is unclear how they consistently lead to hematopoietic transformation and leukemia. Here we report that RUNX1 homodimerizes through a mechanism involving C terminus-C terminus interaction. This RUNX1-RUNX1 interaction regulates the activity of the protein in reporter gene assays and modulates its ability to induce hematopoietic differentiation of hematopoietic cell lines. The promoters of genes regulated by RUNX1 often contain multiple RUNX1 binding sites. This arrangement suggests that RUNX1 could homodimerize to bring and hold together distant chromatin sites and factors and that if the dimerization region is removed by gene fusions or is altered by point mutations, as observed in leukemia, the ability of RUNX1 to regulate differentiation could be impaired.

Of these three mechanisms, perhaps the one best studied at the molecular level is the generation of fusion proteins after chromosomal translocations. A common feature of the fusion partners of RUNX1 is their ability to associate with chromatin remodeling factors and to form dimers through their own self-interaction domains that are invariably retained in the fusion proteins with RUNX1. Thus, it is generally thought that through this self-interaction domain the fusion proteins acquire the ability to recruit to RUNX1-regulated promoters inappropriate transcription complexes that deregulate hematopoietic gene programs (44Fears S.

Given the critical role of correct gene expression during hematopoiesis, it is likely that the minimal disturbance of gene expression could indeed have a dominant effect in the final ratio between progenitor cells and differentiated cells and in the abundance and balance of the hematopoietic mature cells. This model is based in part on the presumption that RUNX1 is unable to interact with itself or with the fusion proteins. However, here we show that RUNX1 is capable of self-interaction through the C terminus in a region previously described as an inhibitory domain (22Kanno T. Kanno Y. Chen L.F. Ogawa E. Kim W.Y. Ito Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 2444-2454Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). When expressed separately, this domain represses in trans the transcription regulatory activity of the normal RUNX1 and disrupts the hematopoietic differentiation of the 32Dcl3 cells, suggesting that self-interaction regulates the transcription activity of RUNX1, and loss of autoregulation could affect the ability of RUNX1 to execute correctly the differentiation programs. These results introduce a new level of complexity to the generally accepted model of leukemic transformation by RUNX1 fusion proteins. Construction of Deletion Mutants—All the deletion mutants were generated by standard or PCR-mediated cloning techniques and inserted in pCMV-FLAG (Sigma) or in a modification of pCMV-FLAG in which the HA epitope replaced the FLAG epitope (pCMV-HA) or in modified pCMV/myc/nuc (Invitrogen) with a FLAG or HA epitope inserted. When necessary, a nuclear localization signal (NLS) was added in-frame before the stop codon. All the clones were DNA-sequenced to confirm that no sequence error had been introduced. Specifically, for construction of FLAG-RUNX1-ID (F-ID), FLAG-RUNX1-IDs (F-IDs), HA-RUNX1-ID (H-ID), and HA-RUNX1-IDs (H-IDs), DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 346–411(ID) and amino acids 372–411(IDs) were amplified by PCR and subcloned in modified pCMV/myc/nuc downstream of FLAG or HA epitope. For construction of HA-RUNX1-RD (H-RD), FLAG-RUNX1-RD (F-RD), FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRD (F-ΔRD), and HA-RUNX1-ΔRD (H-ΔRD), DNA fragments corresponding to amino acids 50–177, amino acids 1–177 and amino acid 185–453 were amplified by PCR and subcloned in pCMV-FLAG or pCMV-HA. FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRDΔID (F-ΔRDΔID) was generated by overlapping PCR. Briefly, two sets of primers (AML1–1387 and AML1–371R and primers AML1–371F and AML1–1917SalI) were used to generate overlapping fragments excluding the region between amino acids 371 and 411. These two fragments were annealed and amplified with primers AML1–1387 and AML1–1917SalI. The product was digested with SalI and cloned into the SalI-digested vector backbone FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRD. FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRDΔ351–411 (F-ΔRDΔ351–411) was generated in the same way with the two sets of primers, AML1–1387 and AML1–351R and primers AML1–351F and AML1–1917SalI. Left region (F-(185–351)) was generated by PCR using primers 5′pCMV-FLAG and AML1–1068KpnI and primer FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRDΔ351–411 as template. After HindIII and KpnI digestion, the fragment was cloned into HindIII-KpnI-digested FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRD. The right region (F-411–453) was cloned by amplifying FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRDΔ351–411 with primers AML1–1792HindIII and pCMV/myc/nuc-918M. The product was digested with HindIII and BamHI and cloned into HindIII-BamHI-digested FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRDΔ351–411. For FLAG-RUNX1-Δ351–411 (F-Δ351–411), pCMV/NotI-FLAG-RUNX1 was digested with BstEII and XbaI, and the large fragment was used as vector backbone. FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRDΔ351–411 was used as template to amplify the region flanking deletion 351–411 using primers AML1–1521 and AML1–1920XbaI. The sequences of the primers used are: AML1–1387, 5′-CCTGGACGTGCCAGCGGCATG-3′; AML1–371R, 5′-GCCGGTGGATTGGAACGGGCCTCCCTGCGC-3′; AML1–371F, 5′-CCCGTTCCAATCCACCGGCTCCGCGCTG-3′; AML1–1917SalI, 5′-AAAAGTCGACGTAGGGCCTCCACACGGC-3′; AML1–351R, 5′-AGCCGGTGGAGTAGCGCGTGGCCGAGCC-3′; AML1–351F, 5′-CCACGCGCTACTCCACCGGCTCCGCGCTG-3′;5′pCMV-FLAG, 5′-GAACCGTCAGAATTGATCTACC-3′; AML1–1608KpnI, 5′-TTTTGGTACCGAGTAGCGCGTGGCCGAGCCCATG-3′; AML1–1792HindIII, 5′-TTTTAAGCTTTCCACCGGCTCCGCGCTGCTC-3′; pcmv/myc/nuc-918M, 5′-ATCCTGGGATCCCTAGAGTTTTTGTTCTGCGGCCGTATC-3′; AML1–1521, 5′-CTATCCAGGCGCCTTCAC-3′; AML1–1920XbaI, 5′-TTTATCTAGATCAGTAGGGCCTCCACAC-3′. Cell Culture, Transfection, and Infection, Immunoprecipitation (IP), and Western Blot Analysis—The adherent cell lines 293T, SW13, HeLa, and NIH-3T3 were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% newborn bovine serum. DNA-transfection of adherent cells was performed by calcium phosphate precipitation (Invitrogen) or with the Escort IV transfection kit (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The cells were harvested 48 h after transfection and treated as described (46Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Proteins separation on denaturing gels and their transfer to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane were carried out as described (46Chakraborty S. Senyuk V. Sitailo S. Chi Y. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44936-44943Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). The protein bands were identified with commercially available monoclonal rat antibody to the HA epitope (Roche Applied Science) and monoclonal mouse antibody M2 (Sigma) or goat antibody ECS (Bethyl) to the FLAG epitope. Co-IP assays were performed by FLAG beads (Sigma). The 32Dcl3 cells were maintained in RPMI containing 10% newborn bovine serum and interleukin-3 supplement. To generate stable expression of integrated genes, the 32Dcl3 and the SW13 cell lines were infected or transfected, selected with G418, and maintained as described (47Chi Y. Senyuk Chakraborti S. Nucifora G. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 49806-49811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). The 32Dcl3 cells were differentiated as described (48Vradii D. Zaidi S.K.

GST Fusion Pulldown Assays—The expression and purification of GST fusion proteins and their interaction with RUNX1 were carried out as described (49Senyuk V. Li D. Zakharov A. Mikhail F.M. Nucifora G. Cancer Res. 2005; 65: 7603-7611Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Reporter Gene and Mammalian Two-hybrid Assays—We used NIH-3T3 cells for reporter gene studies with the RUNX1-responsive M-CSFR promoter linked to the luciferase reporter gene (pM-CSFR-luc) containing the -416 to +71 region of the human M-CSFR promoter (50Rhoades K.L. Hetherington C.J. Rowley J.D. Hiebert S.W. Nucifora G. Tenen D.G. Zhang D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 11895-11900Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). For normalization of transfection efficiency, we used pRL-TK plasmid (Promega) that expresses Renilla luciferase. Each assay was repeated at least three times. For mammalian two-hybrid assays, FLAG-RUNX1 and FLAG-RUNX1-ΔRD were fused in-frame to the activation domain of VP16. HA-RUNX1-ΔRD was cloned in-frame to the DNA binding domain of GAL4. The plasmid pG5Luc (Promega) with five GAL4 binding sites upstream of the luciferase coding sequence was used as reporter plasmid. Plasmid pRL-TK was an internal control. The assays were carried out by transient transfection in HeLa cells, and the luciferase readings were recorded with a Promega Dual-Luciferase Assay System by luminometer (Turner Design TD20/20). Immunofluorescence Analysis—HeLa cells were cultured on glass slides in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (Sigma) containing 10% newborn bovine serum. The initial concentration of the cells was 1 × 105 cells/ml. After 24 h the transfected cells were fixed in 100% methanol at -20 °C and processed for indirect immunofluorescence. As primary antibodies, we used rat monoclonal anti-HA (Roche Applied Science) and mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG (Sigma). Alexa Fluor 594 goat anti-rat IgG (H+L) conjugate and Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) highly cross-adsorbed (Molecular Probes) were used as secondary antibodies. Background binding of the antibodies was reduced by preincubation with bovine serum albumin (5% in phosphate-buffered saline, Sigma). Cells were incubated with primary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature, washed in phosphate-buffered saline, and then incubated with the secondary antibodies for 45 min. The specific binding and cellular distribution of the antigens were assessed by fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss). To visualize the nucleus, we used 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (Sigma). RUNX1 Homodimerizes in Vitro and in Vivo—The promoters of several genes regulated by RUNX1 often contain multiple DNA consensus motifs for RUNX1 binding. These recognition sequences can be found next to each other or separated by a few dozen to a few hundred base pairs, and almost always they are located next to the recognition site of other factors (C/EBPs, GATA1, PU.1, etc.) that cooperate with RUNX1 in gene regulation. The organization of these promoters suggest that RUNX1 could interact with itself to either stabilize its own DNA interaction in adjacent sites or to facilitate/stabilize long range interactions by bringing together the proteins located next to distant RUNX1 sites. To determine whether RUNX1 is capable of self-interaction, we used co-IP assays of 293T cells transiently co-transfected with HA- and FLAG-tagged RUNX1. The results shown in Fig. 1A indicate that RUNX1 interacts with itself (lane 3, top panel). To confirm these results and determine whether the interaction is direct, we performed a GST pulldown assay. We used bacterially expressed and purified GST-RUNX1 and in vitro translated RUNX1. The results shown in Fig. 1B indicate that in vitro translated RUNX1 interacts with GST-RUNX1 immobilized on a solid support. The DNA binding domain of RUNX1, RD, located at the N terminus of the protein, is very highly charged and tends to interact non-specifically with other proteins. The occurrence of nonspecific interaction could be especially evident at high level of protein expression. Therefore, to avoid potential false positive results, we generated a stable RUNX1-expressing SW13 cell line, SW13-FLAG-RUNX1 (S-F-R), by transfection and selection. To ensure that the level of stably expressed RUNX1 was low, we selected those clones in which the expression of RUNX1 was detected after immunoprecipitation but not by Western blotting (not shown). We used these low expressing cell lines to verify RUNX1-RUNX1 interaction after transient transfection. Untransfected SW13 cells were used as the control. The cells were lysed 48 h after transfection, and the proteins were co-immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody, separated by electrophoresis, transferred to a membrane, and analyzed with anti-HA antibody. The results show that HA-RUNX1 co-precipitates with FLAG-RUNX1 (Fig. 1C, lanes 5 and 6, top panel), indicating that RUNX1 interacts with itself. Anti-FLAG antibody did not precipitate HA-RUNX1 in SW13 cells (Fig. 1C, lanes 2 and 3, top panel). Lanes 4–6, bottom panel, confirm the presence of immunoprecipitated RUNX1 in S-F-R cells. Lanes 8, 9, 11, and 12, top panel, show the expression of HA-RUNX1 transiently transfected in normal SW13 and S-F-R cells. The RUNX1-RUNX1 Interaction Involves the C Terminus of the Protein—To map the interaction domain, we tested the interaction of RUNX1 separately with either the N terminus, consisting mostly of the runt-domain (RUNX1-RD), or the C terminus, which does not contain runt domain (RUNX1-ΔRD). The diagram of the plasmids used in this study is shown in Fig. 2. We used co-IP assays of SW13-FLAG-RUNX1 (S-F-R) cells and normal SW13 cells for transient transfection with the N terminus (RUNX1-RD) or the C terminus (RUNX1-ΔRD). The results shown in Fig. 3A indicate that full-length RUNX1 is unable to co-precipitate with RUNX1-RD (lane 4, top panel). However, the C terminus of the protein, RUNX1-ΔRD, co-precipitates with RUNX1 (Fig. 3B, lane 4, top panel). Anti-FLAG antibody did not precipitate the RUNX1-ΔRD in SW13 cells (Fig. 3B, lane 2, top panel). The expression of RUNX1 in S-F-R cells is shown in lanes 3 and 4 of Fig. 3, A and B, lower panels. The expression of HA-tagged transiently transfected RUNX1-RD or RUNX1-ΔRD in SW13 cells and S-F-R cells is confirmed in the top panels (lanes 6 and 8).FIGURE 3RUNX1 interaction with itself involves its C terminus. Stably transfected RUNX1-expressing SW13 cells, SW13-FLAG-RUNX1 (S-F-R), and naïve SW13 cells as control were transfected with HA-tagged RUNX1-RD (A) or RUNX1-ΔRD (B) and analyzed as described in Fig. 1. IP, immunoprecipitate; CL, cell lysates. A, FLAG-RUNX1 is unable to co-precipitate HA-RUNX1-RD (lane 4, top panel).

Lanes 3 and 4 (bottom panel) in A and B confirm the presence of immunoprecipitated FLAG-RUNX1 in S-F-R cells.

Full-length RUNX1, RUNX1-ΔRD, or RUNX1-RD was transiently transfected in S-H-ΔRD cells or in normal SW13 cells. After co-IP, the proteins were separated and analyzed by Western blotting. The results of the assay, shown in Fig. 4, indicate that RUNX1 and the C terminus (lanes 6 and 7, top panel) but not the runt domain (lane 8, top panel) are able to interact with the stably expressed C terminus (HA-RUNX1-ΔRD). This interaction does not occur in control cells (lanes 1–4, top panel) or in untransfected cells (lane 5, top panel). After the detection of the proteins with HA antibody, the blot was stripped and hybridized to anti-FLAG antibody (lanes 1–8, bottom panel). The right side of the figure shows the expression of the proteins in cell lysates by Western blotting. These results indicate that C terminus of RUNX1 interacts with itself but not with the N terminus runt domain. The Inhibitory Domain Is the Major Interaction Region—Somatic or inherited point mutations introducing frameshifts or stop codons that inhibit translation of the C terminus are often detected in RUNX1 patients (28Imai Y.

Through its interaction with other factors, the C terminus of RUNX1 carries out several functions that are necessary for RUNX1 signaling. Between amino acids (aa) 291 and 371 there is a region that interacts with co-activators and modulates gene transcription. This region is generally indicated as an activation domain and also contains a nuclear matrix targeting signal (aa 324–353). By deletion mutation analysis it was previously reported that a short amino acid region between aa 372 and 411 functions as a transcription inhibitory domain (ID). Based on these functional boundaries we generated several mutants, shown in Fig. 2, that were used to further map the interaction region within the C terminus of RUNX1. We first generated two fragments containing the inhibitory domain (ID) spanning aa 346–411 and including part of nuclear matrix targeting signal (named ID) or spanning aa 372–411 (named IDs). Both fragments were HA- or FLAG-tagged at the N terminus and included a NLS at the C terminus to provide appropriate localization. In addition, we generated two internal deletion mutants in the C terminus lacking aa 372–411 (RUNX1-ΔRDΔID) or aa 351–411 (RUNX1-ΔRDΔ351–411). These two mutants were FLAG-tagged at the N terminus and included a NLS at the"
https://openalex.org/W1981312057,"Somatostatin (SS) is a peptide hormone that inhibits insulin secretion in β-cells by activating its Gi/o-coupled receptors. Our previous work indicated that a βγ-dimer of Gi/o coupled to SS receptors can activate phospholipase D1 (PLD1) (Cheng, H., Grodnitzky, J. A., Yibchok-anun, S., Ding, J., and Hsu, W. H. (2005) Mol. Pharmacol. 67, 2162–2172). The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SS-induced PLD activation. We demonstrated the presence of ADP-ribosylation factor Arf1 and Arf6 in clonal β-cells, HIT-T15. We also determined that the activation of PLD1 was mediated through Arf6. Overexpression of dominant-negative (dn) Arf6 mutant, Arf6(T27N), and suppression of mRNA levels using siRNA, both abolished SS-induced PLD activation, while overexpression of wild type Arf6 further enhanced this PLD activation. In contrast, overexpression of dn-Arf1 mutant Arf1(T31N) or dn-Arf5 mutant Arf5(T31N) failed to reduce SS-induced PLD activation. These findings suggested that Arf6, but not Arf1 or Arf5, mediates the effect of SS. We further determined the involvement of the Arf6 guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) EFA6A, a GEF previously thought to be found predominantly in the brain, in the activation of PLD1 in HIT-T15 cells. Using Northern and Western blot analyses, both mRNA and protein of EFA6A were found in these cells. Overexpression of dn-EFA6A mutant, EFA6A(E242K), and suppression of mRNA levels using siRNA, both abolished SS-induced PLD activation, whereas overexpression of dn-EFA6B mutant, EFA6B(E651K), failed to reduce SS-induced PLD activation. In addition, overexpression of dn-ARNO mutant, ARNO(E156K), another GEF of Arf6, had no effect on SS-induced activation of PLD. Taken together, these results suggest that SS signals through EFA6A to activate Arf6-PLD cascade."
https://openalex.org/W2029687104,"The MukBFE complex is essential for chromosome segregation and condensation in Escherichia coli. MukB is functionally related to the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins. Similar to SMCs, MukB requires accessory proteins (MukE and MukF) to form a functional complex for DNA segregation.

Structural Maintenance of Chromosomes (SMC) 4The abbreviation used is: SMC, structural maintenance of chromosomes. proteins participate in most genetic transactions affecting chromatin structure. SMCs have a characteristic domain arrangement. The N- and C-terminal regions joined by a long helix associate to form a bipartite ATPase, the head domain. A hinge domain in the middle of the protein disrupts the central helix and reverses its orientation, creating a long anti-parallel coiled-coil region (1Melby T.E. Ciampaglio C.N. Briscoe G.

Curiously, a subset of proteobacteria including Escherichia coli does not have SMC homologues. Instead, they encode three proteins essential for chromosome partitioning, MukB, MukE, and MukF, (13Niki H. Jaffe A. Imamura R. Ogura T. Hiraga S.

MukB has been classified as a distant relative of the SMC proteins because of its molecular architecture and the phenotypes associated with mukB mutant strains. MukF contains a winged helix domain and bridges the interaction between MukB and MukE, and thus it has been classified as a kleisin (17Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Overproduction of MukB causes DNA condensation to an extent similar to that observed when the MukBFE complex is overexpressed, but it does not reduce the production of anucleate cells or rescue the temperature sensitivity of MukBFE-deficient cells (18Wang Q. Mordukhova E.A. Edwards A.L. Rybenkov V.V. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4431-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Thus, MukE and MukF seem to participate in maintenance of chromatin architecture rather than chromosome condensation (18Wang Q. Mordukhova E.A. Edwards A.L. Rybenkov V.V. J. Bacteriol. 2006; 188: 4431-4441Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Indeed, electron microscopy studies of MukB and MukBFE show that the MukE and MukF proteins mediate the formation of higher ordered structures that could work as chromatin scaffold (19Matoba K.

In the present work, we characterize the oligomerization states of MukE, MukF, and their complexes using size exclusion chromatography and analytical ultracentrifugation. MukF is a dimer in solution, whereas MukE exhibits reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium. MukE and MukF form two high affinity complexes with stoichiometries F2E2 and F2E4. Co-expression of MukE and MukF yields a roughly equimolar mixture of the two complexes, suggesting that both these complexes are present in vivo. Protein Purification—MukE (pAG8009), MukF (pAG8011), and MukFE (pAG8135) were purified similarly. Cell pellets were resuspended in buffer A (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.5 m NaCl, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol) containing protease inhibitors and lysed by sonication. Cleared lysates were loaded onto a HiTrap nickel-chelating column (GE Healthcare), washed with buffer A containing 45 mm imidazole, and eluted with 0.3 m imidazole. Proteins were further purified over a MonoQ column (GE Healthcare). Fractions containing pure protein were concentrated and stored at 4 °C in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.1 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1.4 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 5% (v/v) glycerol. All subsequent experiments were conducted in storage buffer. Size Exclusion Chromatography—Three sets of experiments were conducted at MukF concentrations corresponding to 4, 1, and 0.5 mg/ml. MukF was mixed with increasing amounts of MukE to obtain samples at stoichiometries of 2:1, 2:2, 2:4, 2:6, and 2:8 (F:E). Each sample was incubated 15 min on ice, spun down, and loaded onto a Superdex-200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with storage buffer. Sedimentation Equilibrium—Experiments were conducted at 4 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples of MukE and MukF were studied at loading A280 ranging from 0.43 to 1.2 and rotor speeds of 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, and 16 krpm. Data were acquired using 6-hole cells as an average of four absorbance measurements at 280 nm using a radial spacing of 0.001 cm. Sedimentation equilibrium was achieved within 48 h. Data collected at different speeds and different loading concentrations were analyzed simultaneously in terms of various species analysis models using SEDPHAT 4.1b (21Schuck P. Anal. Biochem. 2003; 320: 104-124Crossref PubMed Scopus (519) Google Scholar) to obtain the sample molecular mass. In the case of MukE, data collected at six loading concentrations were analyzed globally in terms of a reversible monomer-dimer self-association model using mass conservation in SEDPHAT 4.1b. Solution densities ρ were measured at 20 °C on a Mettler-Toledo DE51 density meter and corrected to 4 °C. The partial specific volumes ν used for subsequent calculations were 0.7336 cm3 g-1 (MukE) and 0.7341 cm3 g-1 (MukF). These values were calculated based on the amino acid composition of the proteins using SEDNTERP (www.jphilo.mailway.com). To characterize the complexes formed between MukF and MukE, similar experiments were performed for 2:1, 2:2, 2:4, 2:6, and 2:8 loading molar ratios (F:E). In each case three loading A280 of ∼0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 were studied and analyzed globally. The selected loading ratios of 2:1, 2:2, and 2:4 were also studied at a loading A230 of ∼0.4 with data collected at 230 nm. Sedimentation Velocity—Experiments were conducted at 4 °C on a Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge. Samples of MukF (loading volume of 300 μl) were studied at loading A280 of ∼1.0 and rotor speeds of 50 and 55 krpm. Samples of MukE were analyzed in a similar fashion at loading A280 of 0.29 to 1.0 as well as at a loading A230 of 0.8. Loading ratios of F:E ranging from 2:1 to 2:8 were studied at loading A280 of ∼1.0 and rotor speeds of 45, 50, and 55 krpm. Aluminum double centerpiece cells were used. 100-125 scans were acquired at approximately 3-min intervals as a single absorbance measurement at 280 nm and a radial spacing of 0.003 cm. Data were analyzed using SEDFIT 9.2 (22Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3084) Google Scholar) in terms of a non-interacting discrete species for F2 and F2E4 or in terms of a continuous c(s) distribution. Sedimentation coefficients s were corrected to s20,w based on the solvent density and viscosity (η) calculated based on the composition in SEDNTERP. Sedimentation velocity profiles for selected F:E mixtures were also analyzed in terms of a hybrid local continuous/global discrete model in SED-PHAT. In these analyses three species corresponding to F2, F2E4, and an unknown intermediate were considered. The masses and experimental sedimentation coefficients for the F2 and F2E4 species were fixed. Sedimentation velocity data obtained for MukE at loading concentrations of 15, 32, and 50 μm were each analyzed in SEDPHAT 4.1b in terms of reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium. Mass conservation constraints were implemented. Hydrodynamic Calculation—The sedimentation coefficients s obtained were used to calculate the frictional coefficient f, using the relation s = M(1 - νρ)/Nf, where M is the molecular mass, ν the partial specific volume, ρ the solution density, and N Avogadro’s number. The value of f was compared with the smallest possible frictional coefficient fo for a sphere of equivalent mass (4Hirano M. Hirano T. Mol. Cell. 2006; 21: 175-186Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar): fo = 6πηr = 6πη(3 Mν/4πN)1/3 where r is the radius of the sphere and η the solution viscosity. Oligomerization of MukF and MukE—Purified MukF eluted as a single peak from a Superdex-200 column earlier than expected for a protein of 50,579 Da (Fig. 1A). Based on published data (17Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 20Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar), the early elution time of MukF is expected due to dimerization and its non-globular asymmetric shape. The size exclusion chromatography profile showed some tailing of the MukF peak toward smaller molecular masses, suggesting either the equilibrium between various species or a nonideal interaction of MukF with the column resin. To determine whether MukF existed exclusively as dimer, we carried out sedimentation equilibrium experiments at three loading concentrations using the exact same protein preparation as for the size exclusion chromatography experiments (Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1). A global analysis in terms of single ideal solute returned excellent fits with an experimental molecular mass of 105 ± 3 kDa, confirming that MukF is a monodisperse dimer (n = 2.07 ± 0.06). The monodispersity of the MukF dimer was further confirmed by sedimentation velocity experiments and continuous c(s) analysis (Fig. 1C). Data analysis in terms of a single species yielded a corrected s20,w of 4.85 ± 0.05 S with excellent fits. Based on these data, an f/fo ratio of 1.6 was determined, indicative of an elongated shape and consistent with the anomalous migration noted by size exclusion chromatography. MukE (25,894 Da) also eluted earlier than expected from a Superdex-200 column at a time point corresponding to an apparent molecular mass of ∼44 kDa (Fig. 1A). The elution time and the marked asymmetry of the peak were indicative of a monomer-dimer self-association. To further characterize this interaction, we carried out sedimentation equilibrium experiments at six loading concentrations (15-56 μm, Fig. 1D and supplemental Fig. S2). The weight-average molecular mass increased with the loading concentration, and like the size exclusion chromatography profiles, the molecular masses obtained were larger than those expected for a monomer but smaller than those expected for a dimer. A simultaneous data analysis in terms of reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium returned a log10 Ka value of 4.74 ± 0.06 with excellent fits, which corresponds to a Kd of 18 ± 3 μm. Attempts to model the sedimentation equilibrium data in terms of other self-association models led to poorer fits. Sedimentation velocity experiments on MukE at various loading concentrations also supported a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium, based on the continuous c(s) profiles observed (Fig. 1, C and E). We therefore analyzed the sedimentation velocity data collected at 280 nm in terms of the monomer-dimer self-association of MukE. Excellent fits were obtained (data not shown) returning an average log10 Ka value of 4.8 ± 0.16. This corresponds to a Kd of 15 ± 6 μm, a value identical, within the error of the method, to that obtained by sedimentation equilibrium. These analyses returned sedimentation coefficients s20,w of 2.3 ± 0.2 and 3.6 ± 0.1 S for the monomer and dimer, respectively. The corresponding f/fo ratios (1.35 and 1.37, respectively) are indicative of slight molecular asymmetries. MukE Forms Two High Affinity Complexes with MukF—Complexes at different ratios of MukF (10 μm) and MukE were prepared and fractionated by size exclusion chromatography. The elution profiles observed at ratios of 2:1 and 2:2 (F:E) showed progressive disappearance of free MukF in favor of two larger molecular mass species consistent with complex formation (Fig. 2A, top panel). Samples at 2:4 ratios showed a single peak, and thus we assumed that MukF and MukE form a stable complex having a 2:4 stoichiometry (F2E4). Indeed, samples at ratios of 2:6 and 2:8 showed the F2E4 peak and an additional peak corresponding to excess MukE (Fig. 2A, bottom panel). Sedimentation velocity experiments at a 2:4 (F:E) loading ratio resulted in a single species with a corrected s20,w of 7.40 ± 0.05 S and an f/fo of 1.7, as evidenced by the continuous c(s) distribution (Fig. 2B). Based on f/fo, the asymmetric shape observed for both MukF and MukE is retained upon complex formation. Sedimentation equilibrium studies of this sample were also consistent with the presence of a single species having a mass of 206 ± 7 kDa, confirming the formation of the F2E4 complex (n = 1.00 ± 0.03) (supplemental Fig. S3). Further analyses carried out at lower loading concentrations, with data collected at 230 nm, yield similar results (M = 201 ± 4 kDa, n = 0.98 ± 0.02) (Fig. 2C), showing that MukF and MukE interact with submicromolar affinities. Interestingly, sedimentation velocity experiments carried out at 2:2 and 2:1 (F:E) loading ratios indicated that F2E4 was present along with free MukF and an intermediate complex having a sedimentation coefficient of 6.3 S (Fig. 2B, top panel). These distributions and the relative abundance of each species are virtually identical to the size exclusion chromatography profiles (Fig. 2, A and B). An analysis of the sedimentation velocity profiles in terms of a global discrete model containing only three species was carried out. In this model the masses and sedimentation coefficients of the F2 and F2E4 species were fixed. Excellent data fits were observed with a third species having a sedimentation coefficient of 6.25 ± 0.05 S and an estimated molecular mass of 135 ± 10 kDa (data not shown). Sedimentation equilibrium experiments returned weight average molecular masses of 189 ± 5 and 177 ± 5 kDa for the complexes formed in the 2:2 and 2:1 mixtures, respectively. If the 6.25 S species represents an F2E2 complex, then the weight average molecular masses obtained by sedimentation equilibrium are in agreement with those based on the integration of the sedimentation velocity c(s) profiles (Fig. 2B and data not shown). This intermediate complex is therefore proposed to have a 2:2 (F:E) stoichiometry representing the binding of a single MukE dimer to a dimer of MukF. In very good agreement with the size exclusion chromatography data, sedimentation velocity experiments carried out at 2:6 and 2:8 (F:E) loading ratios indicate that the F2E4 complex was present along with excess MukE (Fig. 2, A and B), demonstrating that a MukF dimer binds a maximum of two MukE dimers. To analyze whether the two MukE binding sites on the MukF dimer are independent, a series of MukF:MukE mixtures (4:1 to 2:4) were analyzed by sedimentation velocity. When plotted as a function of y = [MukE]/2[MukF], the mole fractions of F2, F2E2, and F2E4, obtained by integration of the c(s) distributions, closely tracked the functions (1-y)2, 2y(1-y), and y2, respectively (Fig. 2D), demonstrating that two MukE dimer binding sites on the MukF dimer are independent and do not show any form of cooperativity. These observations provide further confirmation for the F2E2 stoichiometry of the intermediate complex. The F2E4 and F2E2 Complexes Form in Vivo—In parallel, mukE and mukF were subcloned into the same vector with a 6× histidine tag at the N terminus of MukE. Co-expressed MukFE was purified over nickel-chelating, MonoQ and Superdex-200 columns. This three-step purification protocol yielded pure complex as judged by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3A). However, the asymmetry of the peak eluting from the sizing column suggested the presence of multiple unresolved species (Fig. 3B). Sedimentation velocity experiments (loading A280 = 1.1) revealed the presence of mainly two species corresponding to the F2E2 (2.2 μm) and the F2E4 (2.9 μm) complexes, along with traces of free MukF (0.32 μm) (Fig. 3C). These concentrations correspond to mole fractions of 0.06, 0.406, and 0.535 for the F2, F2E2 and F2E4, respectively, and a MukE:MukF ratio of 1.45. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments returned a weight average molecular mass of 186 ± 5 kDa consistent with the presence of mainly F2E2 and F2E4 complexes in nearly equimolar amounts. We have shown that MukF exists exclusively as a monodisperse dimer in the concentration range studied, whereas MukE shows a reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium, characterized by a Kd of 15-18 μm. Purified MukF and MukE form two stable complexes with stoichiometries of 2:2 and 2:4, respectively. The F2E2 and F2E4 complexes are also found in samples purified from bacteria transformed with a co-expression plasmid, reflecting that both can be formed in vivo at least when the two proteins are overexpressed. Our data do not support stoichiometries of F2E1 or F2E3 (Fig. 2, C and D), suggesting that only the dimeric form of MukE interacts with MukF. Loading ratios of 2:4 (F:E) returned exclusively the F2E4 complex, whereas loading ratios of 2:2 (F:E) yielded both F2E2 and F2E4 complexes along with free MukF (Fig. 2, A and B), suggesting that F2E4 forms with a higher affinity than F2E2. Indeed, the copy number of MukE (340 ± 100) and MukF (170 ± 50) inside the cell would support the formation of a F2E4 complex (23Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34208-34217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The bimodal association of MukF and MukE also explains why both excess and absence of MukF causes defects in chromosome segregation (14Yamanaka K. Ogura T. Niki H. Hiraga S. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1996; 250: 241-251PubMed Google Scholar), because imbalance of MukF would alter the ratio between the F2E2 and F2E4 complexes. The structural and functional comparison of MukF (17Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with other known kleisins (2Haering C.H. Lowe J. Hochwagen A. Nasmyth K. Mol.

Ehrlich S.D. Polard P. Noirot P. Mol. Microbiol. 2004; 51: 1629-1640Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) suggests that a dimer of MukF interacts with two MukB subunits. We propose that MukE works as a latch to secure the intrinsically unstable interaction between MukB and MukF (20Yamazoe M. Onogi T. Sunako Y. Niki H. Yamanaka K. Ichimura T. Hiraga S. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5873-5884Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Therefore, association of F2E4 with MukB would cross-link MukB either intramolecularly to form rings (Fig. 4) or intermolecularly to form filaments or rosette-like structures (19Matoba K. Yamazoe M. Mayanagi K. Morikawa K. Hiraga S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2005; 333: 694-702Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Alternatively, binding of F2E2 to MukB or the loss of a MukE dimer from the B2F2E4 complex would allow for a switch from a locked to a functional remodeling complex (Fig. 4). Because B2F2E2 has only one of the MukB-MukF monomers latched by MukE, the complex would be able to open and close at the other arm, facilitating the access of DNA to the inner side of the V-shaped MukB (Fig. 4). Two different MukBFE complexes have been recently identified (23Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34208-34217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). The first one, with a B2F2E4 stoichiometry, is refractory to DNA binding, reinforcing the idea that MukE latches the complex and thus prevents access to the DNA binding moieties of MukB. The second one, with a proposed B2F1E2 stoichiometry, binds and condenses DNA. These results are puzzling because MukF is a monodisperse dimer regardless of the ionic strength and the presence or absence of divalent ions (Fig. 1 and data not shown). Furthermore, the structure of the dimerization region of MukF is a doubly domain-swapped dimer, implying that dimerization is necessary to achieve the correct folding of the protein (17Fennell-Fezzie R. Gradia S.D. Akey D. Berger J.M. EMBO J. 2005; 24: 1921-1930Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Rybenkov and co-workers (23Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34208-34217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) assembled the MukBFE complexes from MukB and co-expressed MukFE, assuming that the latter was a single species of stoichiometry F2E4. Using size exclusion chromatography and sucrose gradient fractionation, they identified a short-lived B2F2E4 complex and a substoichiometric B2F1E2 complex, presumably formed by the loss of half of the F2E4 complex. We have now shown that co-expressed MukFE samples contain both F2E4 and F2E2. If both complexes interact with MukB, then they should form B2F2E4 (546 kDa) and B2F2E2 (494 kDa). Alternatively, one of the two MukFE complexes may not interact with MukB; however, their size exclusion chromatography data do not support this possibility (23Petrushenko Z.M. Lai C.H. Rybenkov V.V. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 34208-34217Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). B2F1E2 and B2F2E2 only differ in size by 51 kDa, a difference that is too small to be detected by size exclusion chromatography. Hence, we propose that it is the B2F2E2 complex, rather than the B2F1E2 complex, that remodels DNA. Considering that the F2E4 and F2E2 complexes are stable, the different stability of the two complexes found by Rybenkov and co-workers must be induced by MukB binding. Kleisins bind SMCs in the vicinity of their ATP binding site (26Haering C.H. Schoffnegger D. Nishino T. Helmhart W. Nasmyth K. Lowe J. Mol. Cell. 2004; 15: 951-964Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (246) Google Scholar); therefore, the interaction between MukB and MukF might be affected by subtle conformational changes induced upon ATP binding or hydrolysis. Reasonably, different nucleotide-bound states of MukB may have different affinities by F2E4 or F2E2. Therefore, a number of factors such as the availability of ATP and magnesium or the rate of ATP hydrolysis may determine whether MukB interacts preferentially with F2E2 to form a functional complex. Likewise, these factors may determine whether B2F2E2 gains or B2F2E4 loses a dimer of MukE to modulate the remodeling activity of the complex. In summary, we have identified two stable MukFE complexes and propose that both can interact with MukB to form a locked B2F2E4 complex and a functional B2F2E2 remodeling complex. We thank J.

https://openalex.org/W2050133832,"The human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8)-encoded G protein-coupled chemokine receptor (vGPCR) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), particularly because of its high constitutive signaling activity. Here, we used retroviral transduction to generate vGPCR-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts that are tumorigenic in nude mice, but as expected fail to induce tumors in their immunocompetent counterparts. However, tumor fragments obtained from nude mice grow progressively in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. Unexpectedly, vGPCR-expressing cells established from grafted tumor fragments gave rise to tumors in immunocompetent mice. These tumors exhibit a striking histological resemblance to KS including plump spindle cell morphology, a high degree of vascularization and brisk mitotic activity. High expression of vGPCR was confirmed in the cell lines and tumors using a newly developed vGPCR-specific monoclonal antibody. Finally, short interfering RNA directed at vGPCR abrogated or significantly delayed tumorigenesis in mice, demonstrating that the tumor development is specifically driven by vGPCR. This novel model for vGPCR-mediated oncogenesis will contribute to our understanding of the role of vGPCR in the pathogenesis of HHV-8 and may even be important in identifying critical molecular and epigenetic changes during tumor progression in vivo."
