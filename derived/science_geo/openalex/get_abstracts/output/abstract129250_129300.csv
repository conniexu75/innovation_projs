https://openalex.org/W1986993954,"There is a requirement for cellular defense against excessive peroxynitrite generation to protect against DNA strand breaks and mutations and against interference with protein tyrosine-based signaling and other protein functions due to formation of 3-nitrotyrosine. Here, we demonstrate a role of selenium-containing enzymes catalyzing peroxynitrite reduction using glutathione peroxidase (GPx) as an example. GPx protected against the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine 123 by peroxynitrite more effectively than ebselen (2-phenyl-1,2-benzisoselenazol-3(2H)-one), a selenoorganic compound exhibiting a high second-order rate constant for the reaction with peroxynitrite, 2 × 106m−1 s−1. Carboxymethylation of selenocysteine in GPx by iodoacetate led to the loss of “classical” glutathione peroxidase activity but maintained protection against peroxynitrite-mediated oxidation. The maintenance of protection by GPx against peroxynitrite requires GSH as reductant.When peroxynitrite was infused to maintain a 0.2 μmsteady-state concentration, GPx in the presence of GSH, but neither GPx nor GSH alone, effectively inhibited the hydroxylation of benzoate by peroxynitrite. Under these steady-state conditions peroxynitrite did not cause the loss of classical GPx activity. GPx, like selenomethionine, protected against protein 3-nitrotyrosine formation in human fibroblast lysates, shown in Western blots. The formation of nitrite rather than nitrate from peroxynitrite was enhanced by GPx or by selenomethionine. The results demonstrate a novel function of GPx and potentially of other selenoproteins containing selenocysteine or selenomethionine, in the GSH-dependent maintenance of a defense line against peroxynitrite-mediated oxidations, as a peroxynitrite reductase.

Peroxynitrite is a potent biological oxidant (1Beckman J.S. Beckman T.W. Chen J. Marshall P. Freeman B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Peroxynitrite (ONOO−) is a relatively stable species compared with free radicals, but peroxynitrous acid (ONOOH) decays with a rate constant of 1.3 s−1. Peroxynitrite is a mediator of toxicity in inflammatory processes with strong oxidizing properties toward biological molecules, including sulfhydryls, ascorbate, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides, and it can cause strand breaks in DNA. Free or protein-bound tyrosine residues and other phenolics can be nitrated by peroxynitrite (see Beckman (2Beckman J.S. Lancaster J. Nitric Oxide. Principles and Actions. Academic Press, San Diego, CA1996: 1-82Google Scholar) for review). Protein tyrosine nitration may interfere with phosphorylation/dephosphorylation signaling (3Kong S.-K. Yim M.B. Stadtman E.

https://openalex.org/W2063460322,"Several human cDNAs encoding a histone deacetylase protein, HDAC3, have been isolated. Analysis of the predicted amino acid sequence of HDAC3 revealed an open reading frame of 428 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 49 kDa. The HDAC3 protein is 50% identical in DNA sequence and 53% identical in protein sequence compared with the previously cloned human HDAC1. Comparison of the HDAC3 sequence with human HDAC2 also yielded similar results, with 51% identity in DNA sequence and 52% identity in protein sequence. The expressed HDAC3 protein is functionally active because it possesses histone deacetylase activity, represses transcription when tethered to a promoter, and binds transcription factor YY1. Similar to HDAC1 and HDAC2, HDAC3 is ubiquitously expressed in many different cell types. Several human cDNAs encoding a histone deacetylase protein, HDAC3, have been isolated.

The organization of chromatin structure is a fundamental and significant component of transcriptional regulation in all eukaryotic cells. Transcriptionally active or repressed chromatin is determined, at least in part, by the modification of histones. For example, hyperacetylation of histones generally leads to an increase in transcription, whereas hypoacetylation of histones appears to have the opposite effect (reviewed in Refs. 1Brownell J.E.

We have now utilized monoclonal antibodies specific for cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers or 6-4 photoproducts, respectively, to measure their repair in UV-irradiated human fibroblasts. Cells homozygous for p53 mutations were deficient in the repair of both photoproducts, whereas cells heterozygous for mutant p53 exhibited normal repair of 6-4 photoproducts, but decreased initial rates of removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, compared with normal cells. The specificity of the effect of wild-type p53 on nucleotide excision repair was demonstrated in a p53 homozygous mutant cell line containing a tetracycline-regulated wild-type p53 gene. Wild-type p53 expression and activity were suppressed in the presence of tetracycline, whereas withdrawal of tetracycline resulted in the induction of p53 expression, cell cycle checkpoint activation, and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. The regulated expression of wild-type p53 resulted in the recovery of normal levels of repair of both cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and 6-4 photoproducts in genomic DNA, but did not alter the transcription-coupled repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. Therefore, the wild-type p53 gene product is an important determinant of nucleotide excision repair activity in human cells.

Chem. 272, 28073-28080) Full-Text PDF Open Access The molecular mechanisms that regulate the responses of normal and neoplastic human cells to DNA damage are critical determinants for the biological end points of mutagenesis and cell death. The p53 tumor suppressor gene plays a central role in mediating the cellular responses to DNA damage in mammalian cells, as demonstrated by its ability to regulate cell cycle progression and programmed death in cells exposed to DNA damaging agents (1Kastan M.B. Onyekwere O. Sidransky D. Vogelstein B. Craig R.W. Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 6304-6311PubMed Google Scholar, 2Kuerbitz S.J. Plunkett B.S. Walsh W.V. Kastan M.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Oncogene. 1993; 8: 307-318PubMed Google Scholar). A wide variety of endogenous and exogenous agents cause damage to DNA, and multiple enzymatic processes exist to repair these different lesions. The most versatile and ubiquitous mechanism for DNA repair is nucleotide excision repair (NER), 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; CPD, cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer; LFS, Li-Fraumeni syndrome; wt, wild-type; mut, mutant; TEV, T4 endonuclease V; DHFR, dihydrofolate reductase; Tet, tetracycline; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; BrdUrd, 5-bromodeoxyuridine. which operates to remove many types of lesions, including UV-induced cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) and 6-4 pyrimidine-pyrimidone photoproducts (hereafter referred to as 6-4 photoproducts). Such lesions may pose as structural blocks to transcription and replication, and they may also result in mutations if translesional replication occurs or if they are not repaired correctly. NER is heterogeneous within the mammalian genome, and CPDs are more efficiently removed from actively expressed genes than from unexpressed regions of the genome (5Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Okumoto D.S. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1985; 40: 359-369Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1015) Google Scholar, 6Mellon I. Bohr V.A. Smith C.A. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 8878-8882Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). Generally, the transcribed strand of an active gene is repaired more rapidly than the non-transcribed strand (7Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar), a process termed transcription-coupled repair. In normal human cells, both CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts are removed from genomic, non-transcribed DNA through a pathway referred to as global genomic NER. We and others have presented evidence for a direct role for p53 in NER, potentially unrelated to cell cycle and cell death events (8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar, 9Smith M.L. Chen I.T. Zhan Q. O'Connor P.M. Fornace Jr., A.J. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1053-1059PubMed Google Scholar, 10Wang X.W. Yeh H. Schaeffer L. Roy R. Moncollin V. Egly J.M. Wang Z. Friedberg E.C. Evans M.K. Taffe B.G. Bohr V.A. Hoeijmakers J.H. Forrester K. Harris C.C. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 188-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (515) Google Scholar). For example, the effects of mutations in the p53 gene on NER and cellular sensitivity to UV irradiation were examined in primary human skin fibroblasts from patients with the cancer prone disorder Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which were heterozygous for mutations in one allele of p53, and in derived sublines expressing only mutant p53 (8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The p53 homozygous mutant cells were severalfold more resistant to UV cytotoxicity and exhibited much less UV-induced apoptosis than did the primary p53 heterozygous mutant cells or than normal skin fibroblasts expressing only wild-type (wt) p53. However, the p53 homozygous mutant cells were deficient in the global genomic NER of CPDs compared with normal cells or to p53 heterozygous mutant cells. Similarly, the rate of repair of the non-transcribed strands of the actively expressed dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene and the p53 gene in p53 homozygous mutant cells was decreased relative to that in normal fibroblasts, consistent with the decreased overall genomic repair level. However, the p53 homozygous mutant cells retained the ability to perform transcription-coupled repair. Thus, p53 homozygous mutant cells were deficient in global genomic NER of CPDs, whereas transcription-coupled repair remained intact. To further characterize the effect of loss of wt p53 function on global genomic NER, we used a different method allowing for the measurement of removal of both CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts from genomic DNA of UV-irradiated cells. Whereas we previously used alkaline sucrose sedimentation analysis of T4 endonuclease V (TEV)-treated DNA to measure removal of CPDs, we have now utilized monoclonal antibodies which specifically recognize CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts to measure their rate of removal from human fibroblasts that are wild-type, heterozygously mutant, or homozygously mutant for the p53 gene. Furthermore, to assess the role of the wt p53 gene product in modulating NER, analyses of both global and transcription-coupled repair have been performed in a LFS p53 homozygous mutant cell line containing a stably integrated tetracycline (Tet)-regulated wt p53 gene. Our results show that loss of wt p53 activity results in a decrease in the global genomic NER of both CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts, but not transcription-coupled repair of CPDs, and that the expression of functional wt p53 protein in a p53 mutant human fibroblast cell line results in restoration of normal levels of global genomic repair of both photoproducts, as well as enhanced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis following UV irradiation. All human fibroblasts were maintained as exponentially growing cultures in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and incubated at 37 °C in 5% CO2. LFS skin fibroblast cell lines (originally obtained from Dr. Michael Tainsky, M. D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX) from patient MDAH041 (hereafter termed 041 wt/mut) and MDAH087 (termed 087 wt/mut) were finite cell populations heterozygous for single base mutations in p53 at codons 184 and 248, respectively (11Yin Y. Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Wahl G.M. Cell. 1992; 70: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). Spontaneously immortalized derivatives of each LFS cell line homozygous for mutant p53 have been described previously, and are termed 041 mut and 087 mut, respectively (8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Early passage GM38 normal primary human diploid skin fibroblasts, which express only wild-type p53, were obtained from the NIGMS Human Genetic Mutant Cell Repository (Coriell Institute for Medical Research, Camden, NJ). Transformed GM2096-SV3 cells from a patient with xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) complementation group C were obtained from Dr. Dan Canaani (12Teitz T. Naiman T. Avissar S.S. Bar S. Okayama H. Canaani D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8801-8804Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar). TR9-7 cells, provided by Dr. George Stark (Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH), were constructed from LFS 041 mut cells into which a Tet-regulated system for expression of wt p53 was stably transfected (13Agarwal M.L. Agarwal A. Taylor W.R. Stark G.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8493-8497Crossref PubMed Scopus (804) Google Scholar). TR9-7 were subcloned, and a single clone demonstrating optimal regulation of wt p53 expression was selected for use in all experiments described, and termed 041 TR. This cell line was grown continuously in the presence of 600 μg/ml G418 and 50 μg/ml hygromycin to maintain selection pressure for the two stably integrated plasmid constructs containing the wt p53 cDNA together with the neomycin resistance gene, and the Tet-regulated transactivator together with the hygromycin resistance gene, respectively. 041 TR cells were cultured in the continuous presence of 2 μg/ml Tet when suppression of wt p53 expression was desired. For analysis of p53 and p21CIP1/WAF1 (hereafter termed p21) protein levels, total cellular protein was isolated by lysing cells in a buffer consisting of 1% Triton X-100, 50 mm Tris (-HCl, pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 10 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 100 μg/ml aprotinin (Sigma). The lysed cells were centrifuged at 15,000 ×g for 15 min, and the supernatants collected. Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford method, and equal amounts (75 μg) of protein were separated by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (14Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207856) Google Scholar) and electroblotted to a nitrocellulose membrane (15Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44969) Google Scholar). Immunoblotting was performed by incubating the membranes for 1 h with mouse monoclonal antibodies to human p53, diluted by 1/200 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (DO-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and human p21, diluted by 1/1000 in PBS (Ab-1, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), followed by incubating the membranes for 1 h with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody diluted by 1/5000 in PBS. Proteins were detected using enhanced chemiluminescence and autoradiography according to the manufacturer's protocol (Amersham Corp.). The relative amounts of detected proteins were determined by scanning densitometry of autoradiographs, using NIH Image analysis software. The relative number of CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts in total genomic DNA from cells collected at various times following UV irradiation was determined using an immunoblot assay. Briefly, exponentially growing cells were prelabeled with [3H]thymidine, washed with PBS, and irradiated with 10 J/m2 UV using a 15-watt germicidal UV lamp delivering predominately 254 nm light. Cells were either processed immediately or incubated in growth medium for various periods. At appropriate times, cells were lysed in a solution containing 10 mm Tris (-HCl, pH 7.5), 1 mm EDTA, 0.5% SDS, 0.1 mg/ml proteinase K, and 0.1 mg/ml RNase, at 37 °C. Genomic DNA was isolated by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and DNA concentrations and specific radioactivity were determined. DNA was denatured by boiling for 5 min and placing on ice (since the monoclonal antibodies recognize UV photoproducts in single-stranded DNA), and equal amounts of genomic DNA from each sample in equal parts Tris-EDTA and 20 × SSPE were fixed to a Hybond N+ nylon membrane (Amersham Corp.) in triplicate using a slot-blot apparatus (0.1 μg of DNA/slot for detection of CPDs, 1 μg of DNA/slot for detection of 6-4 photoproducts). Equal amounts of genomic DNA from unirradiated cells were also loaded for each experiment to control for nonspecific DNA binding of the monoclonal antibodies. The membrane was incubated for 1 h with mouse monoclonal antibodies specific for either CPDs (TDM-2) or 6-4 photoproducts (64M-2), at a dilution of 1/2000 in PBS (antibodies provided by Dr. Toshio Mori, Nara Medical University, Nara, Japan; Ref. 16Mori T. Nakane M. Hattori T. Matsunaga T. Ihara M. Nikaido O. Photochem. Photobiol. 1991; 54: 225-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (391) Google Scholar). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 1/5000 in PBS, enhanced chemiluminescence (Amersham Corp.), and phosphorimager analysis (Bio-Rad model GS-363) were employed for detecting the primary antibodies. Following antibody detection, equal DNA loading to each slot of the membrane was confirmed by scintillation spectrophotometry of individual pieces cut from the membrane. Data from triplicate DNA samples from at least three different experiments for each cell line were averaged, and consistently exhibited less than 5% variation. Repair of CPDs was examined within the transcribed and non-transcribed strand of the 20-kilobase pair KpnI restriction fragment spanning the central region of the DHFR gene, using methods previously described (7Mellon I. Spivak G. Hanawalt P.C. Cell. 1987; 51: 241-249Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1044) Google Scholar,8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). Cells were UV-irradiated with 10 J/m2, lysed immediately for an initial sample or incubated in growth medium containing 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) to density label newly replicated DNA, and then lysed at various times. Density labeling was performed during repair periods to allow unreplicated DNA to be isolated by cesium chloride isopycnic density gradient sedimentation (17Smith C.A. Cooper P.K. Hanawalt P.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. 1B. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 289-305Google Scholar). The frequency of induction of CPDs and their rate of removal from the transcribed and non-transcribed strands of the human DHFR gene was measured by treating purified KpnI-digested DNA with TEV, and then quantifying the reappearance of the full-length restriction fragments in DNA from cells allowed various times to remove CPDs from their DNA. KpnI-treated samples from each time point were treated or mock-treated with TEV, electrophoresed in parallel under denaturing conditions, Southern transferred to a membrane, and hybridized with 30 × 106 cpm 32P-labeled strand-specific RNA probes generated by transcription in vitro of the plasmid pGEM0.69EH (8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). The ratio of full-length restriction fragments in the TEV treated and untreated samples was determined by phosphorimager analysis (Bio-Rad model GS-363), and was used to calculate the average number of CPDs (endonuclease-sensitive sites) per fragment using the Poisson expression. For analysis of cell cycle distribution and apoptosis, both floating and adherent cells (≥1 × 106 cells/time point) were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS, treated with 100 μg/ml RNase, and stained with 20 μg/ml propidium iodide. For each sample, at least 10,000 cells were analyzed for DNA content using a Coulter EPICS 753 flow cytometer (Coulter Electronics). The percentage of cells in sub-G1, G1, S, and G2/M was determined using an EASY2 computer system (Coulter Electronics). To determine if UV treatment resulted in morphological changes characteristic of apoptosis, cultured cells were irradiated or not with 20 J/m2 UV, incubated for 48 h, fixed in 70% ethanol in PBS, stained with the fluorescent DNA stain Hoeschst 33258 (0.5 μg/ml), and examined microscopically. Cells were judged to be apoptotic if they displayed the following morphological characteristics: interphase cells that possessed hypercondensed marginated masses of DNA along the inner surface of their nuclear membranes, cell surface blebbing, and overall cell shrinkage due to reductions in cytoplasmic volume. The effect of UV irradiation on p53 protein levels and p53-dependent transcriptional activity in normal human primary fibroblasts and in the two p53 homozygous mutant human fibroblast cell lines derived from LFS patients was examined by Western blot analysis of protein extracts from cells prior to, and at various times following, treatment with 20 J/m2 UV irradiation, using monoclonal antibodies to p53 and to p21, which is transcriptionally regulated by wt p53 (18El-Deiry W.S. Tokino T. Velculescu V.E. Levy D.B. Parsons R. Trent J.M. Lin D. Mercer W.E. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. Cell. 1993; 75: 817-825Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7970) Google Scholar). In GM38 normal human fibroblast cells, wt p53 protein levels were induced by approximately 10-fold following UV irradiation, with peak levels occurring between 12 and 24 h (Fig. 1 A). In addition, levels of p21 protein were also induced by approximately 8-fold following UV irradiation, reaching a maximum at 24 h. LFS 041 mut cells contain a frameshift mutation at codon 184 of the p53 gene, resulting in a truncated message (19Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis of protein extracts from these cells demonstrated no detectable p53 protein prior to or following UV irradiation, nor any induction of the p21 gene product (Fig. 1 B). LFS 087 mut cells contain a missense Arg → Trp substitution mutation at codon 248 of the p53 gene (19Tainsky M.A. Bischoff F.Z. Strong L.C. Cancer Metastasis Rev. 1995; 14: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Western blotting analysis of protein extracts from these cells demonstrated constitutive overexpression of the mutant protein both prior to and following UV irradiation, but no induction of the p21 gene product following UV irradiation (Fig. 1 C). Therefore, UV irradiation of normal human fibroblasts results in a strong and persistent induction of p53 protein levels and transcriptional activity. Furthermore, in human fibroblasts, UV induction of p21 expression appears to be dependent upon wt p53 activity. The induction and repair of UV-induced CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts in genomic DNA was determined using an immunoblot assay and monoclonal antibodies specific to these lesions. Normal human diploid fibroblasts containing wt p53 efficiently repaired both CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts, removing a greater percentage of 6-4 photoproducts at earlier times than CPDs (Fig.2), as expected from previous studies (20Mitchell D.L. Haipek C.A. Clarkson J.M. Mutat. Res. 1985; 143: 109-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar). As a negative control, repair in human fibroblasts mutant for the XP-C gene was also measured. The XP-C gene product is required for global genomic NER, but not for the transcription-coupled repair pathway (21Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1997; 221: 47-70PubMed Google Scholar); as expected, these cells showed very low levels of removal of both CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts (Fig. 2). Both LFS cell lines homozygous for p53 mutations showed a reduced rate and extent of repair of both UV-induced photoproducts compared with normal cells. Repair of CPDs in these cells was only slightly better than in the XP-C cells (Fig. 2 A), while repair of 6-4 photoproducts was substantially better than in the XP-C cells, but significantly lower than in normal cells (Fig. 2 B). Both LFS cell lines heterozygous for mutant p53 exhibited normal repair of 6-4 photoproducts, but slightly decreased initial rates of removal of CPDs, compared with normal cells. To determine the specificity of wt p53 for regulation of global genomic NER and apoptosis following UV irradiation, a derivative of the LFS 041 mut cell line was used, in which the expression of wt p53 could be regulated. In this cell line, 041 TR, suppression or induction of wt p53 activity was tightly controlled by treating cells with non-cytotoxic levels of Tet. In the presence of 2 μg/ml Tet, p53 and p21 protein levels were nearly undetectable (Fig.3 A, 0 h lane), similar to the parental 041 cell line (Fig. 1 B). However, following withdrawal of Tet, p53 protein levels increased by approximately 10-fold, reaching maximum levels at 24 h (Fig.3 A). p21 gene expression was also induced by approximately 12-fold, peaking at 24–48 h. Therefore, wt p53 expression and activity were specifically induced in this cell line by withdrawal of Tet. Furthermore, in the presence of Tet, UV irradiation did not induce p53, and p21 levels increased only slightly, if at all (Fig. 3 B). When 041 TR cells were UV-irradiated 24 h following withdrawal of Tet, a 2-fold and 4-fold further increase in p53 and p21 protein levels occurred, respectively (Fig. 3 C). To further characterize the functional status of the wt p53 gene in this cell line, the effects of withdrawing Tet on other p53 dependent processes were examined. One of the most clearly defined roles of p53 is the inhibition of DNA replication following DNA damage. We therefore investigated DNA replication in UV-irradiated 041 TR cells. Cells were incubated with BrdUrd following UV irradiation (10 J/m2). Newly replicated, density-labeled DNA was resolved from parental DNA by isopycnic cesium chloride gradients (17Smith C.A. Cooper P.K. Hanawalt P.C. Friedberg E.C. Hanawalt P.C. DNA Repair: A Laboratory Manual of Research Procedures. 1B. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York1981: 289-305Google Scholar). As can be seen (Fig.4), in the presence of Tet, a significant amount of DNA replication occurred within 24 h of UV irradiation, whereas following withdrawal of Tet and induction of wt p53, DNA replication following UV irradiation was completely blocked. Flow cytometric analysis of propidium iodide-stained 041 TR cells was performed to determine the effects of Tet withdrawal and UV irradiation on cell cycle distribution. Following withdrawal of Tet and induction of wt p53, 041 TR cells exhibited a time-dependent increase in cells in both the G1 and G2/M phases and a decrease in cells in S phase (Fig.5 A). A small increase in apoptosis was suggested by the increased sub-G1 DNA fraction seen at 48–72 h. In the presence of Tet, UV-irradiated 041 TR cells did not undergo significant DNA damage-induced G1checkpoint arrest, inhibition of DNA replication, or apoptosis (Fig.5 B). In contrast, following induction of wt p53, UV-irradiated 041 TR cells showed an increase in cells in G1 and G2/M phases from 0 to 48 h, as well as a dramatic increase in sub-G1 apoptotic DNA degradation at 72 h (Fig. 5 C). The effect of wt p53 induction on UV-induced apoptosis in 041 TR cells was confirmed by morphologic examination of fluorescent stained cells. In the presence of Tet, 20 J/m2 UV irradiation had little effect on the number of apoptotic cells seen 48 h later (Fig.6). However, following withdrawal of Tet and induction of wt p53, a significant increase in the number of cells displaying morphologic alterations consistent with apoptosis was seen. Therefore, the use of non-cytotoxic levels of Tet in 041 TR cells allows for the regulation of wt p53 levels, as well as regulation of several of the hallmark cellular functions of wt p53 following UV irradiation, including transcriptional activation of p53-responsive genes, induction of cell cycle checkpoints, inhibition of DNA replication following DNA damage, and DNA damage-induced apoptosis. Therefore, this cell line was appropriate for analysis of the effect of wt p53 expression and function on the cellular processing of UV-induced DNA damage. The effect of wt p53 activity on the repair of CPDs and 6-4 photoproducts in overall genomic DNA, and the repair of CPDs in individual strands of the DHFR gene was examined in 041 TR cells in the presence or absence of Tet. In the presence of Tet, 041 TR cells removed less than 25% of CPDs from overall genomic DNA within 24 h (Fig.7 A), similar to the parental 041 mut cells (Fig. 2 A). However, when cells were irradiated 24 h following withdrawal of Tet, 041 TR cells removed ∼70% of the CPDs from overall genomic DNA within 24 h after irradiation (Fig. 7 A). When the cells were irradiated coincident with the removal of Tet, a similar response was observed (data not shown). The removal of 6-4 photoproducts from overall genomic DNA following withdrawal of Tet occurred with kinetics similar to that for normal fibroblasts. In the presence of Tet, removal was slightly slower (for example, 55% versus 70% repair of 6-4 photoproducts by 2 h, Fig. 7 B). Even in the presence of Tet, however, the 041 TR cells exhibited more efficient repair of 6-4 photoproducts than the parental 041 mut cells (55% versus 30% repair at 2 h, Fig. 2 B). This probably results from low levels of wt p53 expression occurring in the 041 TR cells in the presence of Tet, which may selectively affect the removal of 6-4 photoproducts, but not alter the repair of CPDs. We demonstrated previously that both the LFS 041 mut and 087 mut cells were also deficient in removing CPDs from the non-transcribed strand of the p53 and DHFR genes, consistent with their deficiency in global genomic NER. However, both these p53-deficient cell lines maintained the ability to preferentially repair the transcribed strand of these expressed genes in a manner identical to normal, p53 wt cells (8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). To confirm that this selective reduction of CPD removal from the non-transcribed strand was due specifically to the wt p53 gene, repair of CPDs within individual strands of the human DHFR gene was analyzed in 041 TR cells in the presence or absence of Tet, using quantitative Southern hybridization and strand-specific RNA probes (Fig.8). Following quantitation, it was clear that the presence or absence of Tet had no effect on repair of CPDs within the transcribed strand of DHFR (Fig.9). However, the presence of Tet had a significant affect on the rate of removal of CPDs from the non-transcribed strand of DHFR. Specifically, in the presence of Tet, only ∼30% of CPDs were removed from the non-transcribed strand of the DHFR gene by 24 h, an amount similar to that seen for the parental 041 mut cells (8Ford J.M. Hanawalt P.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8876-8880Crossref PubMed Scopus (326) Google Scholar). However, following withdrawal of Tet and induction of wt p53, repair of the non-transcribed strand occurred at a normal level, displaying a slightly decreased rate compared with the transcribed strand, as seen previously for many other normal primary human fibroblasts (8Ford J.M.

In vitro, the proteins spontaneously assemble into a ternary complex that can be dissociated by the ATPase N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein and the cofactors α-, β-, and γ-SNAP. Since the structural changes associated with these reactions probably form the basis of membrane fusion, we have embarked on biophysical studies aimed at elucidating such changes in vitro using recombinant proteins. All proteins were purified in a monomeric form. Syntaxin showed significant α-helicity, whereas SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin exhibited characteristics of largely unstructured proteins. Formation of the ternary complex induced dramatic increases in α-helicity and in thermal stability. This suggests that structure is induced in SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin upon complex formation. In addition, the stoichiometry changed from 2:1 in the syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex to 1:1:1 in the ternary complex. We propose that the transition from largely unstructured monomers to a tightly packed, energetically favored ternary complex connecting two membranes is a key step in overcoming energy barriers for membrane fusion.

Neurons release their neurotransmitters by the Ca2+-dependent exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. In recent years, several membrane proteins have been identified which are required for exocytotic membrane fusion. These proteins include the synaptic vesicle protein synaptobrevin (also referred to as VAMP) 1The abbreviations used are: VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein; NSF,N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein; SNAP, soluble NSF attachment protein; SNARE, SNAP receptor; SNAP-25, synaptosomal associated protein of 25 kDa; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, PCR, polymerase chain reaction; TCEP, Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine hydrochloride); MALLS, multiangle laser light scattering. and the synaptic membrane proteins syntaxin and SNAP-25, collectively referred to as SNAREs. Synaptobrevin and syntaxin both contain a single transmembrane domain at the C terminus (1Bennett M.K. Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Science. 1992; 257: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (1077) Google Scholar, 2Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). SNAP-25 does not contain a transmembrane domain but carries palmitoyl side chains attached to cysteine residues in the middle of the sequence (3Hess D.T. Slater T.M. Wilson M.C. Skene J.H.P. J. Neurosci. 1992; 12: 4634-4641Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 4Veit M. Söllner T.H. Rothman J.E. FEBS Lett. 1996; 385: 119-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). Homologues of these proteins have been identified in many eukaryotic cells including yeast, suggesting that fusion of trafficking vesicles with their respective target membranes is mediated by a conserved mechanism (2Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar,5Ferro-Novick S. Jahn R. Nature. 1994; 370: 191-193Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 6Calakos N. Scheller R.H.

While the evidence linking synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin to exocytosis is compelling, their precise role is unknown. In detergent extracts of brain membranes, the three proteins form a tight complex (9Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E.

A ternary complex with properties similar to the native complex can be formed using recombinant proteins lacking their transmembrane anchors (11Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Both native and recombinant complexes can be disassembled by the concerted action of the ATPase NSF and the protein α-SNAP (9Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E.

They are essential for the fusion of trafficking vesicles with their target membranes (9Söllner T. Bennett M.K. Whiteheart S.W. Scheller R.H. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1993; 75: 409-418Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1586) Google Scholar,10Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (2637) Google Scholar). The assembly and disassembly of the SNARE proteins has not yet been integrated into a coherent picture of exocytosis. However, any interference with these reactions seriously inhibits membrane fusion (6Calakos N. Scheller R.H. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 1-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 7Rothman J.E. Wieland F.T. Science. 1996; 272: 227-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (1026) Google Scholar, 8Augustine G.J. Burns M.E. DeBello W.M. Pettit D.L. Schweizer F.E. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1996; 36: 659-701Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). To further understand these essential reactions, one needs to learn more about the structural and energetic properties of assembly and disassembly. Therefore, we have begun intensive biophysical and biochemical studies of the SNAREs and of their complexes. Nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, multiangle laser light scattering (MALLS), and CD spectroscopy were used to investigate structural properties of the individual proteins and their complexes. Dramatic changes in structure, oligomerization, and thermal stability upon complex formation were observed. All recombinant proteins were expressed as His6-tagged fusion proteins. Subcloning was performed using standard techniques (14Saiki R.K. Gelfand D.H. Stoffel S. Scharf S.J. Higuchi R. Horn G.T. Mullis K.B. Ehrlich H.A. Science. 1988; 239: 487-491Crossref PubMed Scopus (13517) Google Scholar). For all polymerase chain reactions (PCR)Pfu DNA polymerase was used. For synaptobrevin 2, the coding sequence for the cytoplasmic domain (i.e. residues 1–96) was amplified by PCR using the primers 5′-CCCGGATCCATATGTCGGCTACCGCTGCCACCGTC-3′ and 5′-CGCGGGATCCCTCGAGTTACATCATCTTGAGGTTTTTCCA-3′ and subsequently subcloned into the pET-15b vector (Novagen) using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites. This resulted in a fusion protein with an N-terminal His6 tag that is cleavable with thrombin. The cDNA encoding for rat synaptobrevin 2 (15Elferink L.A. Trimble W.S. Scheller R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11061-11064Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was kindly provided by R. H. Scheller (Stanford University). For the expression of SNAP-25 and syntaxin, expression vectors (referred to as pHO vectors) with versatile polylinker and a C-terminal His6 tag were constructed. First, a short linker consisting of the oligonucleotides 5′-AATTGGTCGAGCC-3′ and 5′-AGCTGGCTCGACC-3′ was inserted between the EcoRI and HindIII site of pET-11c and pET-11d (kindly provided by F. W. Studier and A. H. Rosenberg (16Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar)), resulting in the deletion of both cleavage sites. The vector pHO2d was constructed by inserting DNA sequence containing a new multiple cloning site followed by bases coding for a His6 tag and a stop codon. This insert was generated by annealing the partially complementary primers p1 (5′-CGCCATATGGCCATGGTACCCGGGTCGACAAGCTTGAATTCGCAC-3′) and p2 (5′-GGCGGATCCTATCAGTGATGGTGGTGATGGTGCGAATTCAAGCTTGT-3′) and filling the missing 3′ ends by Pfu DNA polymerase activity. The product was cut with NcoI and BamHI, gel-purified, and inserted into the corresponding sites of the modified pET-11d vector. In analogy, the vector pHO2c was constructed from the modified pET-11c vector using the primer p3 (5′-GGGATTCCATATGGTACCCGGGTCGACAAGCTTGAATTCGCAC-3′) instead of primer p1 for the construction of the insert. Rat SNAP-25B (1–206, entire coding sequence) was subcloned viaNcoI and EcoRI into the vector pHO2d. The SNAP-25B sequence was first amplified by PCR from the SNAP-25B (rat) cDNA (kindly provided by T. C. Südhof, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center) (17Blasi J. Chapman E.R. Link E.

The cDNA encoding for rat syntaxin 1A (19Bennett M.K. Garcia-Arraras J.E. Elferink L.A. Peterson K. Fleming A.M. Hazuka C.D. Scheller R.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 863-873Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by R. H. Scheller. Rat syntaxin 1A-(1–265) (i.e. without the transmembrane region) was subcloned either into TrcHisA (Invitrogen) with an N-terminal His6 tag as described previously (18Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or into the vector pHO2c with a C-terminal His6 tag. For subcloning into the vector pHO2c, the coding region corresponding to amino acid residues 1–265 was amplified using the primers 5′-GGGATTCCATATGAAGGACCGAACCCAG-3′ and 5′-GCGAATTCCCCTTCTTCCTGCGTGCCTT-3′. The resulting product was subcloned into the NdeI and EcoRI sites of the vector pHO2c resulting in the additional C-terminal sequence GNSHHHHHH. This syntaxin construct was used for nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (Figs. 1 and 2). However, the location of the His6 tag showed little effect on the properties of syntaxin.Figure 2Stoichiometry of SNAP-25 and syntaxin in the ternary complex with synaptobrevin, monitored by nondenaturing electrophoresis. Synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin (concentrations as indicated) were incubated overnight in standard buffer prior to separation by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Note that due to an isoelectric point of 8.5, monomeric synaptobrevin is not detectable in the nondenaturing gel. To achieve complete transition to the ternary complex in each case, an excess of synaptobrevin was used.A, constant amounts of SNAP-25 were incubated with increasing amounts of syntaxin; B, constant amounts of syntaxin were incubated with increasing amounts of SNAP-25.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) His6-tagged fusion proteins were first purified by Ni2+-Sepharose chromatography (18Chapman E.R. An S. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27427-27432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Proteins were eluted by increasing the imidazole concentration stepwise to 40, 80, 120, or 240 mm (in 20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mm NaCl). Fractions were analyzed for purity by SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) and staining with Coomassie Blue. Fractions containing recombinant proteins were dialyzed against standard buffer (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol). SNAP-25 and syntaxin were further purified by anion exchange chromatography on a Mono-Q column and synaptobrevin by cation exchange chromatography on a Mono-S column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). After loading, the proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of NaCl in standard buffer. The peak fractions were pooled and dialyzed against standard buffer. The His6 tag of synaptobrevin was cleaved with thrombin followed by another chromatographic step on a Mono-S column. The eluted protein was 95% pure as determined by gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. The syntaxin-SNAP-25 and ternary complexes were purified using a Mono-Q column (Pharmacia). The ternary complex was disassembled when incubated with NSF, α-SNAP, and ATP (not shown), demonstrating that the proteins are functional with respect to NSF-mediated disassembly (12Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 13Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). After purification, the proteins and the protein complexes were dialyzed against standard buffer and concentrated by ultrafiltration to final concentrations of 1–10 mg/ml. Protein concentrations, measured at 280 nm, were calibrated by internally standardized amino acid analysis following acid hydrolysis (carried out by the W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University). Far-UV CD spectra were obtained by averaging over 5–20 scans with a step size of 0.5 nm on an AVIV model 62DS CD spectrometer equipped with a thermoelectric temperature controller. All measurements were performed in Hellma quartz cuvettes with a path length of 0.1 or 0.5 cm. For thermal melts, the mean residue ellipticities at 222 nm were measured as a function of temperature with the conditions indicated in the panels. Thermal unfolding experiments were repeated in the presence of 10 mm dithiothreitol. Little or no effect on the CD profiles was observed. All CD spectra were recorded after reaching equilibrium following an overnight incubation at 4 °C in standard buffer. To evaluate changes of the CD spectrum attributable to complex formation, the spectra were compared with the theoretically noninteracting sum of the spectrum using the equation [Θ]sum = Σ i c i n i [Θ] i /Σ i c i n i, where c i are the respective concentrations of protein molarity,n i are the respective numbers of amino acids, and [Θ] i are the mean residue ellipticities of the individual proteins. In the case of several species, CD spectra will show the average mean residue ellipticity weighted by the concentration of each species. Thus, in the interpretation of the binary and ternary complexes, the high order complexes will have a negligible effect on the spectra. SDS-PAGE was carried out as described by Laemmli (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar). When testing for SDS resistance, samples were solubilized in SDS sample buffer (final concentrations: 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 3% β-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at room temperature (unboiled) or 95 °C (boiled) for 5 min before being analyzed on a 15% gel. Nondenaturing gels were prepared and run in an identical manner as SDS-polyacrylamide gels (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207538) Google Scholar) except that SDS was omitted from all buffers. To allow for comparison with the spectroscopic data, the samples were incubated overnight in standard buffer at the concentrations indicated in the panels. After adding sample buffer (final concentrations: 60 mm Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol), the samples were separated on a 3% stacking (Tris, pH 6.5) and a 9% separation gel (Tris, pH 8.8). Size exclusion chromatography was performed on a HR-10/30 Superdex-200 column (Pharmacia) in standard buffer with the NaCl concentration increased to 300 nm and with 10 mm TCEP at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min. The elution profiles were monitored by UV absorption at 280 nm, light scattering at 690 nm, and differential refractometry. Light scattering and differential refractometry were carried out using the Mini-Dawn and Optilab instruments of Wyatt Technology Corp. Analysis was carried out as described by Astra software (21Wyatt P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). For each sample, 100 μl of protein solution was loaded. The protein concentrations were obtained by amino acid analysis (W. M. Keck Foundation Biotechnology Resource Laboratory at Yale University). The dn/dc value (change of solution refractive index with respect to a change in concentration of the molecules being investigated) is fairly constant for proteins (22Wen J. Arakawa T. Philo J.S. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 240: 155-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar) and was set to 0.185 for the analysis of the light-scattering data. In our initial experiments we noticed that comparison of CD spectra of the purified SNAP-25-syntaxin complex with that of a 1:1 mixture showed a large discrepancy in agreement with earlier CD results (see Fig. 5, D and F, in Ref.23Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Although it is currently believed that the SNAP-25-syntaxin complex has a 1:1 stoichiometry, we thought that this discrepancy warranted reinvestigation of the oligomerization of the SNAREs and their complexes. Assembly reactions at precisely defined protein concentrations (using amino acid analysis) were performed, and each mixture was analyzed using nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. This technique allows for the separation of the individual proteins from complexes, provided that the latter are of sufficient stability. In the first set of experiments, the formation of the binary syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex was monitored. Constant amounts of SNAP-25 were incubated with increasing amounts of syntaxin (Fig.1 A) and vice versa(Fig. 1 B). Both experiments showed that about 2 molar equivalents of syntaxin were required for complete binding of 1 molar equivalent of SNAP-25. A binary complex of synaptobrevin with either SNAP-25 or syntaxin was not detected by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis (not shown), in agreement with previous observations reporting that these interactions are weaker than the interaction of syntaxin with SNAP-25 (11Hayashi T.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the experiment described above was repeated in the presence of an excess of synaptobrevin. Only individual proteins and the ternary complex were observed. This suggests that any binary complex of syntaxin and SNAP-25 participates in the formation of a ternary complex (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 shows that the molar ratio between syntaxin and SNAP-25 changes from 2:1 in the binary complex to 1:1 in the ternary complex. To evaluate the stoichiometric ratio of synaptobrevin to syntaxin and SNAP-25 in the ternary complex, approximately equimolar amounts of syntaxin and SNAP-25 were incubated with increasing amounts of synaptobrevin. In the absence of synaptobrevin, all syntaxin was found in the binary complex, whereas a fraction of SNAP-25 was uncomplexed, in agreement with a 2:1 stoichiometry of the binary complex. When increasing amounts of synaptobrevin were added, the binary complex as well as uncomplexed SNAP-25 gradually disappeared, and ternary complex was formed (data not shown). The three proteins were present in the ternary complex in roughly equimolar amounts (1:1:1 stoichiometry). The results described so far suggest that in the binary syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex, one of the syntaxin molecules may serve as a “place holder” that occupies the binding site for synaptobrevin and that it is displaced when synaptobrevin is added. To test this hypothesis, synaptobrevin was added to the purified syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex. In addition to nondenaturing gel electrophoresis, the incubation mixture was also analyzed by SDS-PAGE without boiling the samples, a procedure known to preserve the ternary but none of the binary complexes (11Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.3, some syntaxin is released from its complex with SNAP-25 when synaptobrevin is added, confirming that the stoichiometric ratio of syntaxin and SNAP-25 changes upon transition from the binary to the ternary complex. During size exclusion chromatography, synaptobrevin, SNAP-25, and syntaxin and their complexes eluted at positions of high apparent molecular mass when compared with globular molecular mass standards (not shown). To determine the absolute molecular mass, we used MALLS, a technique that is independent of the shape of molecules (21Wyatt P. Anal. Chim. Acta. 1993; 272: 1-40Crossref Scopus (1299) Google Scholar). Synaptobrevin eluted as a monomeric species (Fig. 4 A) with a molecular mass of 11 kDa, in excellent agreement with the molecular mass determined by mass spectroscopy (11 kDa, not shown). Furthermore, a15N-1H heteronuclear single-quantum coherence-NMR spectrum of synaptobrevin at 0.5 mmconcentration showed narrow line widths, demonstrating that synaptobrevin does not aggregate even at high concentrations. 2G. Warren and A. T. Brünger, unpublished results. Both SNAP-25 and syntaxin eluted as monomeric species with molecular masses of 26 kDa (Fig. 4 B) and 37 kDa (Fig. 4 C), in agreement with the theoretical molecular masses of 25 and 35 kDa. The syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex eluted as a major peak in the 86-kDa range, which is reasonably close to the theoretical molecular mass of the 2:1 complex (Fig. 4 D). The purified ternary complex eluted as a major peak in the 90-kDa range, which is within measurement error to the theoretical molecular mass of the ternary complex (Fig.4 E). The results presented so far demonstrate that both the binary SNAP-25-syntaxin and the ternary complex are defined molecular entities with a fixed stoichiometry that can be purified by chromatographic methods. Furthermore, complex formation is virtually quantitative when the components are mixed in the correct stoichiometric ratio. Therefore, comparison of CD spectra obtained from the individual proteins with those of stoichiometric mixtures or purified complexes should reveal structural changes associated with complex formation. The CD spectrum of syntaxin showed significant α-helical content, as indicated by the characteristic double minimum at 208 and 222 nm (Fig.5 A). In contrast, SNAP-25 had a low secondary structure content (Fig. 5 A), in agreement with previous results on the SNAP-25 homologue from leech (Hirudo medicinalis) (23Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). Likewise, synaptobrevin showed little secondary structure content (Fig. 5 A). It also appears to lack tertiary interactions as assessed by two-dimensional 1H nuclear Overhauser effect NMR spectroscopy,2 suggesting a random coil conformation or an unusual conformation with little secondary structure. To investigate structural changes associated with binding, CD spectra of each binary combination and of the ternary complex were measured by mixing the proteins at the appropriate stoichiometric ratios. The CD spectra of these mixtures were compared with the theoretically noninteracting sum of the individual mean residue ellipticities (see “Materials and Methods”). For the syntaxin-SNAP-25-complex, the mean residue ellipticity is significantly larger than that expected for a noninteracting mixture (Fig. 5 B), similar to our previous findings on the leech homologues (23Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar). In contrast, only a small increase in molar ellipticity was observed when SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin were mixed (Fig. 5 C), and no change was observed when synaptobrevin was mixed with syntaxin (Fig.5 D), in agreement with the observation that no complexes were found by nondenaturing gel electrophoresis. Upon ternary complex formation, an even larger relative increase in mean residue ellipticity was observed than for the syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex (Fig. 5 E). Little difference was observed between the stoichiometric mixtures of the components and the purified complexes (not shown). Furthermore, the observed CD spectrum has a more pronounced α-helical double minimum profile than the theoretical noninteracting mixture. Thus, the formation of the ternary complex is associated with a dramatic increase in secondary structure. Most likely, this is due to induction of structure in the unstructured proteins synaptobrevin and/or SNAP-25. The spontaneous and quantitative binding of SNARE proteins suggests that assembly is an energetically favorable reaction that results in stable complexes. As a first step toward understanding complex stability, thermal stabilities have been measured by monitoring Θ222 as a function of temperature. The thermal unfolding of syntaxin shows a mildly biphasic behavior, with a first transition point at 55 °C and a second, more pronounced transition at 80 °C. In contrast to syntaxin, no significant changes in ellipticity were observable for synaptobrevin and SNAP-25, in agreement with the apparent lack of secondary structure (Fig.6 A). Fig. 6 B shows the thermal unfolding curve of the purified syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex. The curve shows a more pronounced biphasic behavior but no increase in thermal stability compared with syntaxin. In contrast, formation of the ternary complex resulted in a dramatic increase in thermal stability (Fig.6 C). The thermal unfolding curve was monophasic, with a cooperative transition at T m ≈ 90 °C. No precipitates were detectable at 95 °C. In addition, thermal denaturation was largely reversible with about 80% recovery (not shown). A thermal unfolding curve of the ternary complex was also recorded in 0.1% SDS (Fig. 6 D). This experiment was suggested by the observation that the ternary complex is resistant to treatment with SDS without boiling (11Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar). Indeed, SDS resistance has been used for evaluating the stability of ternary complexes formed from mutant proteins (11Hayashi T. McMahon H. Yamasaki S. Binz T. Hata Y. Südhof T.C. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5051-5061Crossref PubMed Scopus (664) Google Scholar, 26Kee Y. Lin R.C. Hsu S.C. Scheller R.H. Neuron. 1995; 14: 991-998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 27Hao J.C. Salem N. Peng X.R. Kelly R.B. Bennett M.K. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1596-1603Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6 D, denaturation occurs gradually as a function of temperature with no cooperative transition, indicating that SDS affects folding and stability of the ternary complex. Synaptobrevin, syntaxin, and SNAP-25 form a stable ternary complex with 1:1:1 stoichiometry and a tendency to self-associate. This complex can be purified by chromatographic procedures and migrates as a single band on a nondenaturing gel. The mean residue ellipticity of the complex is about twice as high as that of the theoretically noninteracting mixture of its components. Interestingly, similar structural changes were observed upon assembly of the yeast homologues Snc1, the SNAP-25-like domain of Sec9 (Sec9c), and Sso1 (28Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brünger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We conclude that the structural similarities of the assembly reactions between the yeast and neuronal SNARE proteins are far higher than indicated by their sequence identity. A detailed understanding of this unique assembly reaction will be essential for elucidating the mechanism by which these proteins drive membrane fusion. The 2:1 stoichiometric ratio of the “binary” syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex is surprising. However, a close evaluation of our data on the leech homologues (23Fasshauer D. Bruns D. Shen B. Jahn R. Brünger A.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4582-4590Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar) yields the same ratio, suggesting that this is common to neuronal complexes. In contrast, the complex formed from the yeast homologues Sso1 and Sec9c shows a 1:1 stoichiometry (28Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brünger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). This represents a potentially interesting structural difference between neuronal and yeast SNAREs. In contrast to syntaxin, both SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin have very little secondary structure. However, both proteins are active in the sense that they can form the ternary complex with high efficiency (Figs. 2 and 5 E). Although we cannot distinguish which of the three proteins is responsible for the large increase in ellipticity during assembly, it is likely that both SNAP-25 and synaptobrevin assume a more stable and ordered conformation in the complex. Unlike syntaxin and the syntaxin-SNAP-25 complex, the ternary complex is remarkably resistant to heat denaturation. In addition, the equilibrium for the assembly reaction appears to be far on the side of complex formation, being essentially irreversible under normal experimental conditions (12Hayashi T. Yamasaki S. Nauenburg S. Binz T. Niemann H. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 2317-2325Crossref PubMed Scopus (227) Google Scholar, 13Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Thus, it is probable that substantial amounts of energy are released upon assembly and that the complex represents a state of lower energy. How can these findings be integrated into a coherent concept that explains assembly and disassembly of this complex in the context of membrane fusion? Recent studies from our laboratory have shown that a ternary complex from native proteins can assemble with all three proteins residing as neighbors in a single membrane (29Otto H. Hanson P.I. Jahn R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 6197-6201Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). However, the bulk of syntaxin and SNAP-25 is localized to the plasma membrane and synaptobrevin is almost exclusively localized to the membrane of synaptic vesicles (2Südhof T.C. Nature. 1995; 375: 645-653Crossref PubMed Scopus (1770) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is attractive to speculate that complex assembly results in a “zipping up” of the proteins that forces the membrane anchors and thus the two opposing membranes close together (30Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. Jahn R. Curr. Opin. Neurobiol. 1997; 7: 310-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (334) Google Scholar). This is further supported by results from the yeast homologues suggesting significant interactions between SNAREs close to the transmembrane domain of Snc1 (28Rice L.M. Brennwald P. Brünger A.T. FEBS Lett. 1997; 415: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The proteins would achieve their final “low energy conformation” by bringing the membranes close together, and the energy released during assembly would thus be utilized to overcome energy barriers for membrane fusion.

Here we examine whether leptin acutely regulates peripheral and hepatic insulin action. Recombinant mouse leptin (0.3 mg/kg·h, Leptin +) or vehicle (Leptin −) were administered for 6 h to 4-month-old rats (n = 20), and insulin (3 milliunits/kg·min) clamp studies were performed. During physiologic hyperinsulinemia (plasma insulin ∼65 microunits/ml), the rates of whole body glucose uptake, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis and the rates of 2-deoxyglucose uptake in individual tissues were similar inLeptin − and Leptin +. Post-absorptive hepatic glucose production (HGP) was similar in the two groups. However, leptin enhanced insulin's inhibition of HGP (4.1 ± 0.7 and 6.2 ± 0.7 mg/kg·min; p < 0.05). The decreased HGP in theLeptin + group was due to a marked suppression of hepatic glycogenolysis (0.7 ± 0.1 versus 4.1 ± 0.6 mg/kg·min, in Leptin + versus Leptin −, respectively;p < 0.001), whereas the % contribution of gluconeogenesis to HGP was markedly increased (82 ± 3%versus 36 ± 4% in Leptin + andLeptin −, respectively; p < 0.001). At the end of the 6-h leptin infusion, the hepatic abundance of glucokinase mRNA was decreased, whereas that of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase mRNA was increased compared with Leptin −. We conclude that an acute increase in plasma leptin 1) enhances insulin's ability to inhibit HGP, 2) does not affect peripheral insulin action, and 3) induces a redistribution of intrahepatic glucose fluxes and changes in the gene expression of hepatic enzymes that closely resemble those of fasting.

A. 1997; 94: 4242-4245Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Since the most common alteration in energy balance, obesity, is tightly associated with insulin resistance, it has been proposed that leptin may play a role in carbohydrate metabolism and insulin action (8Flier J.S.

Science. 1996; 274: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar) has suggested that leptin may antagonize insulin action in these cells. Conversely, early work on the effect of exogenous leptin inob/ob mice had demonstrated a marked decrease in both plasma insulin and glucose concentrations following prolonged administration of this protein (2Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J.

Science. 1995; 269: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (4184) Google Scholar). Since the decline in plasma glucose and insulin was greater in leptin-treated mice than in pair-fed control mice (2Pelleymounter M.A. Cullen M.J. Baker M.B. Hecht R. Winters D. Boone T. Collins F. Science. 1995; 269: 540-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (3838) Google Scholar, 14Schwartz M.W. Baskin D.G. Bukowski T.R. Kuijper J.L. Foster D. Lasser G. Prunkard D.E. Porte D.J. Woods S.C. Seeley R. Weigle D. Diabetes. 1996; 45: 531-535Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), it has been proposed that leptin may directly or indirectly improve in vivo insulin action. However, it is well established that changes in food intake, body weight, fat mass and/or fat distribution similar to those associated with long term leptin administration can independently alter insulin action, particularly in insulin-resistant and obese animal models (16Kissebah A.H. Int. J. Obes. 1991; 15: 109-115PubMed Google Scholar,17Bjorntorp P. Diabetes Care. 1991; 14: 1132-1143Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Thus, it is presently unknown whether the short term administration of exogenous leptin modulates insulin's ability to promote glucose disposal and/or to regulate hepatic glucose fluxes. Furthermore, a recent report in cultured hepatocytes indicates that leptin may also regulate the gene expression of a key gluconeogenic enzyme, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (9Cohen B. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Science. 1996; 274: 1185-1188Crossref PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar), and may thus regulate the intrahepatic distribution of glucose fluxes. To delineate whether leptin acutely regulates hepatic and peripheral insulin action in vivo, we examined the effects of systemic infusion of recombinant leptin on whole body glucose disposal, hepatic glucose fluxes, and glucokinase and PEPCK 1The abbreviations used are: PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FFA, free fatty acids; GK, glucokinase; HGP, hepatic glucose production; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. 1The abbreviations used are: PEPCK, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; FFA, free fatty acids; GK, glucokinase; HGP, hepatic glucose production; MOPS, 4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid. mRNA in the presence of euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp studies in conscious rats. Two groups of male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were studied. Group 1 consisted of 8 rats receiving an infusion of vehicle for 6 h (Leptin −) and group 2 consisted of 12 rats receiving an infusion of recombinant mouse leptin (Amgen, Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA; >95% pure by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) at the rate of 5 μg/kg·min for 6 h (Leptin +). Rats were housed in individual cages and subjected to a standard light (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.)/dark (6 p.m. to 6 a.m.) cycle. One week before the in vivostudy, rats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital (50 mg/kg body weight), and indwelling catheters were inserted in the right internal jugular vein and in the left carotid artery. The venous catheter was extended to the level of the right atrium and the arterial catheter was advanced to the level of the aortic arch (23Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Habener J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 24Kraegen E. James D. Jenkins A. Chisolm P. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E353-E362PubMed Google Scholar, 25Giaccari A.

Shulman G.I. Papachristou D. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 19Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin.

Fat-free mass and fat mass were calculated from the whole body volume of distribution of water, estimated by tritiated water bolus injection in each experimental rat (20Barzilai N. Massillon D. Rossetti L. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 819-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Briefly, boluses of 20 μCi of 3H20 (NEN Life Science Products) were injected intra-arterially on the morning of the study (9 a.m.). Steady state for 3H20-specific activity in rats is generally achieved within 45 min; 5 samples were collected between 1 and 2 h after injection. The distribution space of water was obtained by dividing the total radioactivity injected by the steady-state specific activity of plasma water which was assumed to be 93% of the total plasma volume. Fat-free mass was calculated from the whole body water distribution space divided by 0.73. Studies were performed in unrestrained rats using the insulin clamp technique (18Rossetti L. Smith D.

Giaccari A. Barzilai N. Howard K. Sebel G. Hu M. J. Clin. Invest. 1993; 92: 1126-1134Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar, 22Giaccari A. Rossetti L. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Food was removed for ∼5 h before the in vivo protocol. All studies lasted 360 min and included a 120-min equilibration period for assessment of the space of distribution of water, a 120-min basal period for assessment of the post-absorptive rates of glucose turnover, and a 120-min hyperinsulinemic clamp period. At the beginning of the basal period and 120 min before starting the glucose/insulin infusions, a primed continuous infusion of high pressure liquid chromatography purified [3-3H]glucose (NEN Life Science Products; 20 μCi bolus, 0.2 μCi/min) was initiated and maintained throughout the remaining 4 h of the study. A bolus of [U-14C]2-deoxyglucose (20 μCi) was injected 30 min before the end of the study. [U-14C]Lactate (5 μCi bolus/0.25 μCi/min) was infused during the last 10 min of the study. The protocol followed during the insulin clamp study was similar to that described previously (18Rossetti L. Smith D. Shulman G.I. Papachristou D. DeFronzo R.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1987; 79: 1510-1515Crossref PubMed Scopus (674) Google Scholar, 19Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar, 21Rossetti L.

Invest. 1992; 89: 36-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Briefly, a primed continuous infusion of regular insulin (3 milliunits/kg·min) was administered, and a variable infusion of a 25% glucose solution was started at time 0 and periodically adjusted to clamp the plasma glucose concentration at ∼7 mm. To control for possible effects of leptin on the endocrine pancreas (23Kieffer T.J. Heller R.S. Habener J.F. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 224: 522-527Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar), somatostatin (1.5 μg/kg·min) was also infused to inhibit endogenous insulin secretion in both groups. Plasma samples for determination of [3H]glucose- and [3H]water-specific activities were obtained at 10-min intervals during the basal and clamp periods. Steady-state conditions for the plasma glucose concentration and specific activity were achieved within 90 min in both the basal and clamp periods of the studies (Fig. 1). Plasma samples for determination of plasma insulin and FFA concentrations were obtained at 30-min intervals during the study. Plasma samples for determination of plasma [U-14C]2-deoxyglucose-specific activity were obtained at 90, 91, 93, 95, 98, 100, 105, 110, 115, and 120 min during the clamp studies. The total volume of blood withdrawn was ∼3.0 ml/study; to prevent volume depletion and anemia, a solution (1:1 v/v) of ∼4.0 ml of fresh blood (obtained by heart puncture from littermates of the test animals) and heparinized saline (10 units/ml) was infused at a rate of 20 μl/min. Furthermore, following larger samples, red blood cells were resuspended in saline and immediately returned through the sampling catheter. All determinations were also performed on portal vein blood obtained at the end of the experiment. At the end of the in vivo studies, rats were anesthetized (pentobarbital 60 mg/kg body weight, intravenously); the abdomen was quickly opened; portal vein blood was obtained, and rectus abdominal and hindlimb muscle and liver were freeze-clamped in situwith aluminum tongs pre-cooled in liquid nitrogen. The time from the injection of the anesthetic until freeze-clamping of the tissues was less than 45 s. All tissue samples were stored at −80 °C for subsequent analysis. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Plasma glucose was measured by the glucose oxidase method (Glucose Analyzer II, Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA). Plasma insulin, glucagon, and leptin (rat Leptin radioimmunoassay kit, Linco Research Inc., St. Charles, MO) concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. The plasma concentration of free fatty acids was determined by an enzymatic method with an automated kit according to the manufacturer's specifications (Waco Pure Chemical Industries, Osaka, Japan). Plasma [3H]glucose radioactivity was measured in duplicates in the supernatants of Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4precipitates (Somogyi procedure) of plasma samples (20 μl) after evaporation to dryness to eliminate tritiated water. The rates of glycolysis were estimated as described previously (19Rossetti L. Giaccari A. J. Clin. Invest. 1990; 85: 1785-1792Crossref PubMed Scopus (237) Google Scholar). Briefly, plasma-tritiated water-specific activity was determined by liquid scintillation counting of the protein-free supernatant (Somogyi filtrate) before and after evaporation to dryness. Because tritium on C-3 of glucose is lost to water during glycolysis, it can be assumed that plasma tritium is present either in tritiated water or [3-3H]glucose. To measure plasma [U-14C]2-deoxyglucose, samples were deproteinized as described above, and an aliquot of the supernatant was counted in a double channel beta-counter after addition of 500 μl of water and 5 ml of liquid scintillation mixture. To measure muscle [U-14C]2-deoxyglucose, frozen tissue samples were weighed and dissolved in 0.5 ml of 1 m NaOH kept in a shaking water bath at 60 °C for 1 h. Following neutralization with 0.5 ml of 1 m HCl, 2 aliquots were taken. One was deproteinized with Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 and the other with 6% HClO4. The HClO4 supernatant contains both phosphorylated and unphosphorylated 2-deoxyglucose, whereas the Ba(OH)2 and ZnSO4 supernatant contains only the unphosphorylated form. The difference in dpm between the two supernatants measures the muscle content of 2-deoxyglucose-phosphate (24Kraegen E. James D. Jenkins A. Chisolm P. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E353-E362PubMed Google Scholar). Uridine-diphosphoglucose (UDP-Glc), uridine-diphosphogalactose (UDP-galactose), and phosphoenolpyruvate (P-enolpyruvate) concentrations and specific activities in the liver were obtained through two sequential chromatographic separations, as previously reported (21Rossetti L.

Hepatic glucokinase (GK) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) mRNA abundance was assessed by Northern blot analysis (27Barzilai N. Rossetti L. J. Biol.

The isolated RNA was assessed for purity by the 260/280 ratio absorbency. Twenty μg of total RNA were electrophoresed on a 1.2% formaldehyde denatured agarose gel in 1 × MOPS running buffer. The RNA was visualized with ethidium bromide and transferred to a hybond-N membrane (Amersham Corp.). The GK and PEPCK cDNA probes were labeled with 32P using the Megaprime labeling system kit (Amersham Corp.). Prehybridization and hybridization were carried out using the rapid hybridization buffer (Amersham Corp.). The filters were then exposed to Fuji x-ray films for 12–48 h at −80 °C with intensifying screens. Quantification of GK and PEPCK mRNA was done by scanning densitometry, normalized for ribosomal RNA signal to correct for loading irregularities. The term total glucose output is intended as total in vivo flux through Glc-6-Pase. The term hepatic glucose production (HGP) is intended as the net rates of Glc-6-P dephosphorylation to glucose. Finally, glucose cycling is defined as the input of extracellular glucose into the Glc-6-P pool followed by exit of plasma-derived Glc-6-P back into the extracellular pool. Under steady-state conditions for plasma glucose concentrations, the rate of glucose disappearance (Rd) equals the rate of glucose appearance (Ra). The latter was calculated as the ratio of the rate of infusion of [3-3H]glucose (dpm/min) and the steady-state plasma [3H]glucose-specific activity (dpm/mg). When exogenous glucose was given, the rate of endogenous glucose production was calculated as the difference between Ra and the infusion rate of glucose. The rate of 2-deoxyglucose uptake was calculated as described by Kraegen et al. (24Kraegen E. James D. Jenkins A. Chisolm P. Am. J. Physiol. 1985; 248: E353-E362PubMed Google Scholar). The percent of the hepatic glucose 6-phosphate pool directly derived from plasma glucose was calculated as the ratio of [3H]UDP-Glc- and plasma [3H]glucose-specific activities. The percent of the hepatic glucose 6-phosphate pool derived from P-enolpyruvate gluconeogenesis was calculated as the ratio of the specific activities of [14C]UDP-Glc and 2 × [14C]P-enolpyruvate following in vivo labeling with [U-14C]lactate (21Rossetti L.

To examine the effect of the acute administration of leptin on whole body, skeletal muscle, and liver insulin action, 12 rats were infused with 5 μg/kg·min leptin for 6 h and were compared with 8 control rats receiving a vehicle infusion. There were no differences in the mean body weights, average food intake, and fat-free mass between the two groups of rats. Similarly, following ∼5-h fast (post-absorptive state), the plasma insulin, glucose, and FFA concentrations were similar in the rats assigned to the two experimental groups.Table IBase-line characteristics of rats receiving infusions of vehicle (Leptin −) or leptin (Leptin +)GroupLeptin−Leptin +n812Body weight (g)322 ± 19311 ± 11Food intake (g)20 ± 120 ± 1FFM (% of body wt)90 ± 487 ± 3Plasma glucose (mm)7.6 ± 0.27.9 ± 0.2Plasma insulin (microunits/ml)34 ± 433 ± 4Plasma FFA (meq/liter)0.90 ± 0.020.89 ± 0.03Rats were fasted for 5 h prior to plasma sampling.

Food intake represents the average ± S.E. of the last 3 days, and fat-free mass (FFM) was estimated from the steady-state specific activity of 3H2O (five plasma samples at 20-min intervals) 1–2 h following the injection of a bolus of 3H2O (20 μCi). Open table in a new tab Rats were fasted for 5 h prior to plasma sampling. Biochemical parameters represent the average ± S.E. of at least three basal measurements in each rat. Food intake represents the average ± S.E. of the last 3 days, and fat-free mass (FFM) was estimated from the steady-state specific activity of 3H2O (five plasma samples at 20-min intervals) 1–2 h following the injection of a bolus of 3H2O (20 μCi). To assess the metabolic effects of insulin in vivo, a physiologic increase in the plasma insulin concentrations was generated for 120 min, and the plasma glucose concentrations were maintained at the basal levels (∼7 mm) by a variable glucose infusion. Thus, conscious rats were compared in the presence of similar steady-state hyperinsulinemia and normoglycemia in the presence or absence of exogenous leptin (TableII). Steady-state conditions for plasma glucose concentration and specific activity were achieved within 90 min during both the basal and clamp periods (Fig. 1). The plasma FFA concentration did not change significantly from its post-absorptive levels following the vehicle infusion (Table II and Fig. 1). However, there was a transient increase (by ∼35%) in the plasma FFA concentrations between 120 and 180 min during the leptin infusion. Regardless of their basal levels, the plasma FFA concentrations were decreased at a similar level during the hyperinsulinemic clamp studies. The plasma leptin concentrations during the leptin infusions averaged 458 ± 49 ng/ml. The rates of glucose infusion required to maintain the plasma glucose concentration at the target level during the hyperinsulinemic clamp studies were similar in the rats receiving vehicle and leptin (Table II).Table IISteady-state plasma glucose, insulin, and free fatty acids (FFA) concentrations and average rate of glucose infusion (GIR) in Leptin − and Leptin + rats during the basal period (Basal) and during the hypeinsulinemic clamp studies (Insuli"

Surface biotinylation followed by wheat germ agglutinin column chromatography and anti-CD44-mediated immunoprecipitation indicate that both CD44s and p185 HER2 are expressed on the cell surface and most importantly, that these two molecules are physically linked to each other via interchain disulfide bonds. We have also determined that hyaluronic acid stimulates CD44s-associated p185 HER2 tyrosine kinase activity, leading to an increase in the ovarian carcinoma cell growth.After transfection of the ovarian carcinoma cell line with the adenovirus 5 E1A gene, which is known to repress p185 HER2 expression, we observed that both surface CD44s expression and CD44s-mediated cell adhesion to hyaluronic acid are significantly reduced in the transfectant cells compared with the control cells. These data suggest that down-regulation of p185 HER2 blocks CD44s expression and subsequent adhesion function. Our findings also indicate that the CD44s-p185 HER2 interaction is both functionally coupled and biosynthetically regulated.

CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is widely distributed in different cell types and tissues (for reviews see Refs. 1Bourguignon L.Y.W. Curr. Top.

The extracellular domain of CD44 is extensively modified byN,O-glycosylation and glycosaminoglycan addition (2Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P. Adv.

The cytoplasmic domain of CD44 contains at least one ankyrin binding site (6Lokeshwar V.B. Fregien N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J.

Chem. 1992; 267: 22073-22078Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) enhances the binding between CD44 and ankyrin. The transmembrane interaction between CD44 and the cytoskeleton appears to play an important role in the early signal transduction events leading to cell activation (10Bourguignon L.Y.W.

The gene encoding the CD44 protein (located on human chromosome 11) contains 20 exons, of which only 10 are expressed in the standard form (CD44s). 1The abbreviations used are: CD44s and CD44v, standard and variant forms of CD44, respectively; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hyaluronic acid; E1A, adenovirus 5 gene. 1The abbreviations used are: CD44s and CD44v, standard and variant forms of CD44, respectively; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; HA, hyaluronic acid; E1A, adenovirus 5 gene. The remaining 10 exons are expressed in different combinations in the extracellular domain of variant isoforms of the protein (CD44v), generated by alternative splicing of the mRNA (11Screaton G.R.

Cancer Res. 1991; 51: 5292-5297PubMed Google Scholar). Some of these CD44v isoforms are selectively expressed on certain tumor cell surfaces during metastasis (13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Iida N. Welsh C.F.

In addition, high levels of CD44s/CD44v expression have been correlated with the progression of various carcinomas (13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Iida N. Welsh C.F. Zhu D. Krongrad A. Pasquale D. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1995; 26: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Tanabe K.K. Ellis L.M. Saya H. Lancet. 1993; 341: 725-726Abstract PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). At the present time, information concerning possible factors involved in triggering CD44v formation and CD44s overexpression during tumorigenesis or metastasis is very limited. Ovarian carcinoma is the most lethal tumor of the female genital tract and continues to be the major cause of mortality in female cancer patients. Ovarian cancer has a unique pattern of spreading, which is primarily by intraperitoneal seeding (16Piver M.S. Baker T.R. Piedmonte M. Sandecki A.M. Semin. Oncol. 1991; 18: 177-185PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that ovarian cancer cells express CD44s predominantly, which causes very strong adhesion to peritoneal mesothelium (17Cannistra S.A. Kansas G.S. Niloff J. DeFranzo B. Kim Y. Ottensmeier C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3830-3838PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cannistra S.A. DeFranzo B. Niloff J. Ottensmeier C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been reported that a significant reduction in tumor implants occurred in nude mice 5 weeks after intraperitoneal injection of ovarian cancer cells incubated with anti-CD44 antibody compared with injected cells pretreated with antibodies to other cell surface proteins (17Cannistra S.A. Kansas G.S. Niloff J. DeFranzo B. Kim Y. Ottensmeier C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3830-3838PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cannistra S.A. DeFranzo B. Niloff J. Ottensmeier C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar). These findings suggest that CD44 plays an important role in the implantation of ovarian cancer metastasis. The HER2 oncogene (also called c-erbB-2 or neu) encodes a 185-kDa (p185 HER2 ) membrane protein that contains a single transmembrane spanning region, two cystine-rich extracellular domains and a tyrosine kinase-associated cytoplasmic domain (19Bargmann C.I. Hung M.C. Weinberg R.A. Cell. 1986; 45: 649-657Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (806) Google Scholar). This protein belongs to the epidermal growth factor receptor subgroup of the receptor-linked tyrosine kinase superfamily (20Pele E. Yarden Y. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Overexpression and amplification of HER2 oncogenes have been found to correlate with poor survival of many known cancers including ovarian cancer (21Berchuck A. Kamel A. Whitaker R. Kerns B. Olt G. Kinney R. Soper J.T. Dodge R. Clarke-Pearson D.L. Marks P. McKenzie P.Yin. Bast J.R.C. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 4087-4091PubMed Google Scholar, 22Hung M.C. Zhang X. Yen D.-H. Zhang H.-Z. He G.-P. Zhang T.-Q. Shi D.R. Cancer Lett. 1992; 61: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Hung and co-worker (23Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that the HER2 oncogene is also overexpressed in certain ovarian carcinoma cell lines, such as SKOV3.ipl, shown to display high tumorigenic and metastatic potential. Therefore, coexpression of both CD44s and p185 HER2 appears to be closely associated with ovarian cancer progression. In this study we have addressed the question of whether there is any interaction between CD44s and p185 HER2 in ovarian tumor cells using various human ovarian carcinoma cell lines including SKOV3.ipl (established from ascites of a nu/nu mouse given an intraperitoneal injection of SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinoma cell line) and derivatives (e.g. two stable transfectant cell lines designated as SKOV3.ipl.E1A (expressing E1A genes) and SKOV3.ipl.Efs (E1A frameshift mutants)) as model systems. Our results clearly indicate that these two surface molecules (i.e.CD44s and p185 HER2 ) are physically linked, functionally coupled, and biosynthetically regulated together. We proposed that the interaction between CD44s and p185 HER2 may be critically important for the onset of tumorigenesis and spreading during ovarian tumor development. The SKOV3.ipl cell line was established from ascites that developed in a nu/nu mouse given an intraperitoneal injection of SKOV-3 human ovarian carcinoma cell line (obtained from the American Type Culture Collection) as described previously (23Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, F12 medium supplement (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Two stable transfectant cell lines, SKOV3.ipl.E1A transfectants (expressing E1A genes) andE1A frameshift mutants (SKOV3.ipl.Efs) were prepared as a control cell line (to make sure the changes in transformation phenotypes (if any) in ipl.E1A transfectants were not due to the selection process or to transfection of the plasmids and thepSV2-neo gene) (23Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (Clone 020, Isotype IgG2b; obtained from CMB-TECH, Inc., Miami, FL) used in this study recognizes a common determinant of the CD44 class of glycoproteins including CD44s and other variant isoforms (15Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and is capable of precipitating all CD44 variants. Monoclonal mouse anti-p185 HER2 antibody (c-neu-ab-3) and anti-phosphotyrosine antibody were purchased from Oncogene Science, Inc. (Manhasset, NY) andZymed Laboratories Inc. (PY-plusTM, clone PY20, IgG2b; South San Francisco, CA), respectively. Total RNA was extracted from ≈1 g of human ovarian cells (e.g. SKOV3.ipl) and processed for RT-PCR (using specific primer pairs (e.g. exon 5 and 15 primer pairs)) and Southern blot analyses as described previously (15Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Twenty μg of total RNA isolated from SKOV3.ipl cells was separated on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membrane, and hybridized to the CD44s cDNA probe at 42 °C for 16 h. Human ovarian carcinoma cells (SKOV3.ipl) and derivatives (e.g. SKOV3.ipl.E1A2 and SKOV3.ipl.Efs) suspended in PBS were surface-labeled using the following biotinylation procedure. Briefly, cells (107cells/ml) were incubated with sulfosuccinimidobiotin (Pierce) (0.1 mg/ml) in labeling buffer (150 μm NaCl, 0.1 mHEPES (pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS to remove free biotin. Subsequently, the biotinylated cells were used for anti-CD44-mediated immunoprecipitation as described below. Surface-biotinylated cells (5 × 105cells) were washed in 0.1 m PBS (pH 7.2) and solubilized in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100 buffer followed by sequential wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose chromatography and immunoprecipitation by rat anti-CD44 antibody plus goat anti-rat IgG. The immunoprecipitated material was solubilized in either nonreducing or reducing SDS sample buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE (with 6 or 7.5% gel). Separated polypeptides were then transferred onto nitrocellulose filters. After blocking nonspecific sites with 3% bovine serum albumin, the nitrocellulose filters were incubated with ExtrAvidin-peroxidase (Sigma) or with anti-p185 HER2 antibody (5 μg/ml) plus peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) followed by an addition of peroxidase substrate (Pierce). The blots were developed using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Life Science, Inc., UK) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some cases, surface-biotinylated SKOV3.ipl cells (treated with hyaluronic acid (HA) (50 μg/ml) for 1 h, or pretreated with anti-CD44 followed by HA treatment (50 μg/ml) for 1 h, or untreated) were processed for anti-CD44-mediated immunoprecipitation to obtain the CD44s·p185 HER2 complex. This material was then analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to the nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with ExtrAvidin peroxidase (Sigma) to detect surface-biotinylated CD44 and/or anti-phosphotyrosine antibody plus peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) to detect p185 HER2 tyrosine kinase activity. In some experiments, cells (e.g.SKOV3.ipl.E1A2 and SKOV3.ipl.Efs) were immunoprecipitated with anti-CD44 or immunoblotted with various immunoreagents such as mouse anti-p185 HER2 antibody, anti-E1A (M73) antibody, and anti-α-actin followed by incubation with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1:10,000 dilution) at room temperature for 1 h. After an addition of peroxidase substrate, the blots were developed using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. After SDS-PAGE, the 280-kDa gel band that was detected under nonreducing conditions was excised, eluted from the gel, and further labeled using the following biotinylation procedure. Briefly, eluted 280-kDa protein was incubated with sulfosuccinimidobiotin (0.1 mg/ml) in labeling buffer (150 μm NaCl, 0.1 m HEPES (pH 8.0) for 30 min at room temperature followed by extensive dialysis against PBS buffer (0.1m phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and 150 mm NaCl). This biotinylated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions, transferred to the nitrocellulose filters, and incubated with ExtrAvidin peroxidase. After an addition of peroxidase substrate, the blots were developed using Renaissance chemiluminescence reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions. In some cases, the biotinylated material was analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions followed by immunoblotting/immunoprecipitation with anti-p185 HER2 and/or anti-CD44 antibody according to the procedures described above. Human ovarian carcinoma cells such as SKOV3.ipl were washed with PBS buffer and fixed by 2% paraformaldehyde. Fixed cells were then incubated with rat anti-CD44 antibody (10 μg/ml) and fluorescein-labeled goat anti-rat antibody (10 μg/ml) to detect surface CD44 expression. Subsequently, these fluorescein-labeled cells were rendered permeable by ethanol treatment and stained with monoclonal mouse anti-p185 HER2 followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. To detect nonspecific antibody binding, fluorescein-labeled cells were incubated with normal mouse IgG followed by rhodamine-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG. No labeling was observed in such control samples. The fluorescein- and rhodamine-labeled samples were examined with a confocal laser scanning microscope (MultiProbe 2001 inverted confocal laser scanning microscope system, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Human ovarian carcinoma cell lines including SKOV3.ipl and derivatives (e.g.SKOV3.ipl.E1A2 and SKOV3.ipl.Efs) were metabolically labeled with Tran35S label (20 μCi/ml) as described previously (10Bourguignon L.Y.W. Lokeshwar V.B. Chen X. Kerrick W.G.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6634-6644PubMed Google Scholar). After labeling, the cells were washed in PBS and incubated in PBS containing 5 mm EDTA at 37 °C to obtain a nonadherent single-cell suspension. Labeled cells (9.1 × 105cpm/105 cells) were incubated on HA-coated plates (prepared as described previously) (10Bourguignon L.Y.W. Lokeshwar V.B. Chen X. Kerrick W.G.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6634-6644PubMed Google Scholar) at 4 °C for 30 min either alone or in the presence of a unique monoclonal rat anti-CD44 antibody (50 μg/ml). After incubation, the wells were washed three times in PBS, the adherent cells were solubilized in PBS containing 1% SDS, and the well-bound radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. SKOV3.ipl cells (5 × 103 cells/well) (treated with HA (50 μg/ml), pretreated with anti-CD44 followed by HA treatment (50 μg/ml), or untreated) were plated in 96-well culture plates in 0.2 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, F12 medium supplement containing either 0.5% fetal bovine serum or no serum for 24 h at 37 °C in 5%CO2, 95% air. In each experiment, a total of five plates (10 wells/treatment (e.g. HA treatment or anti-CD44 plus HA treatment or no treatment)/plate) was used. Experiments were repeated three times. The in vitro growth of these cells was analyzed by measuring increases in cell number using the 3-(4,5-dimethyl thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assays (CellTiter 96R nonradioactive cell proliferation assay according to the procedures provided by Promega). Subsequently, viable cell-mediated reaction products were recorded by a Molecular Devices (Spectra Max 250) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader at a wavelength of 450 nm. The expression of CD44 is known to be closely correlated with the metastatic and proliferative behavior of a variety of tumor cells including human ovarian tumor cells (13Bourguignon L.Y.W. Iida N. Welsh C.F. Zhu D. Krongrad A. Pasquale D. J. Neuro-Oncol. 1995; 26: 201-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 14Tanabe K.K. Ellis L.M. Saya H. Lancet. 1993; 341: 725-726Abstract PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar, 15Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 17Cannistra S.A.

Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar). To examine the expression of CD44 transcripts at the mRNA level, total RNA from ovarian tumor cells (SKOV3.ipl) was isolated and analyzed by RT-PCR with exon 5 and 15 primer pairs (designed to amplify the open reading frame region of CD44 involved in the alternative splicing of several exons) (15Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). By employing ethidium bromide staining (Fig.1 A, lane 1) of agarose gels followed by Southern blot hybridization (Fig.1 A, lane 2), we have identified a major PCR product of 156 base pairs that comigrates with an amplimer of CD44s (the standard form) in human ovarian tumor cells (e.g.SKOV3.ipl). Northern blot analysis also reveals a single 2.8-kilobase CD44s transcript that is expressed in these cells (Fig. 1 B). Nucleotide sequence data confirm that this transcript represents the CD44 standard form, CD44s (data not shown). CD44 expression at the mRNA level does not always correlate with cellular protein expression. Therefore, it is important to further characterize CD44 protein expression in the human ovarian tumor cells. To examine CD44 expression on the surface of ovarian tumor cells, we have utilized surface biotinylation techniques and a specific monoclonal anti-CD44 antibody that recognizes the standard form of CD44 (CD44s) as well as other variant isoforms (15Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that a single surface-biotinylated polypeptide (molecular mass ≈ 85 kDa) displaying immunological cross-reactivity with CD44s is preferentially expressed on the cell surface of human ovarian cells (Fig. 1 C, lane 1). No CD44s-containing material is observed in control samples when normal rat IgG is used (Fig.1 C, lane 2). Therefore, we believe that the major CD44 isoform expressed on the surface of the human ovarian tumor cells (SKOV3.ipl) is CD44s. These results are consistent with previous findings indicating ovarian cancer cells express predominantly CD44s (17Cannistra S.A. Kansas G.S. Niloff J. DeFranzo B. Kim Y. Ottensmeier C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 3830-3838PubMed Google Scholar, 18Cannistra S.A. DeFranzo B. Niloff J. Ottensmeier C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1995; 1: 333-342PubMed Google Scholar). Both CD44s and the p185 HER2 oncogene are often overexpressed (as much as 100-fold) in human tumor cells as a consequence of gene amplification and/or transcriptional regulation (15Iida N. Bourguignon L.Y.W. J. Cell. Physiol. 1995; 162: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 24Ram T.G. Ethier S.P. Cell Growth Differ. 1996; 7: 551-561PubMed Google Scholar, 25Xia W. Lau Y.K. Zhang H.Z. Liu A.R. Li L. Kiyokawa N. Clayman G.L. Katz R.L. Hung M.C. Clin. Cancer Res. 1997; 3: 3-9PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we addressed the question regarding whether there is an interaction between CD44s and p185 HER2 in human ovarian tumor cells. Using the nonionic detergent Triton X-100 to extract surface-biotinylated cells followed by sequential wheat germ agglutinin-Sepharose column chromatography and anti-CD44-mediated immunoprecipitation, we found that only one surface-biotinylated 85-kDa CD44s band is revealed under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE (Fig.2, lane 1). However, under nonreducing conditions, we have detected a large polypeptide (≈280 kDa) that is co-isolated with 85-kDa CD44s (Fig. 2, lane 2). To further characterize this large polypeptide, the 280-kDa protein was first eluted from the nonreducing SDS-PAGE gel and processed for biotinylation labeling. Under reducing conditions, we found that this biotinylated 280-kDa polypeptide is readily reduced into two proteins (Fig. 2, lane 3). One corresponds to p185 HER2 (185 kDa) and the other is CD44s (85 kDa) as verified by anti-p185 HER2 (Fig. 2, lane 4) and anti-CD44s immunoblot (Fig. 2, lane 5), respectively. Preliminary data indicate that the p185 HER2 associated with the plasma membrane of SKOV3.ipl cells is not surface-biotinylated. However, if p185 HER2 is denatured by SDS treatments, the sites for biotinylation of this molecule become available. This is the reason why we eluted the 280-kDa complex (Fig. 2, lane 2) and biotinylated again to detect both p185 HER2 and CD44s (Fig. 2,lane 3). In addition, we carried out anti-p185 HER2 or anti-CD44s-mediated precipitation followed by anti-CD44s immunoblot or anti-p185 HER2 immunoblot, respectively, using reducing SDS-PAGE analyses. Our results indicate that the CD44s band is revealed in anti-p185 HER2 -immunoprecipitated materials (Fig. 2,lane 6). The p185 HER2 band can also be detected in the anti-CD44s-immunoprecipitated materials (Fig. 2, lane 7). These findings clearly indicate that CD44s and p185 HER2 are closely associated with each other in a complex involving interchain disulfide bonds in ovarian tumor cells. Based on the predicted sequence obtained from cDNA cloning of the human CD44s gene, several cysteine residues have been identified, including 6–7 cysteine residues at the external domain, one Cys (amino acid 286) in the transmembrane region, and one Cys (amino acid 295) in the cytoplasmic domain (11Screaton G.R. Bell M.V. Jackson D.G. Cornelis F.B. Gerth U. Bell J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 12160-12164Crossref PubMed Scopus (974) Google Scholar). The functional significance of the cysteine residues at the external domain of CD44s is not clear at the present time. However, point mutation of Cys286 (but not Cys295) of human CD44s has been reported to cause a reduction (or loss) of HA binding (26Liu D. Sy M.S. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1987-1994Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Certain cysteine residues (e.g. Cys286 (in the transmembrane domain) and/or Cys295 (in the cytoplasmic domain)) in mouse CD44s have been shown to play an important role in signal transduction and cell adhesion. For example, these residues appear to be involved in CD44s fatty acylation required for CD44s and ankyrin interaction (7Bourguignon L.Y.W. Kalomiris E. Lokeshwar V.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11761-11765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that some of these cysteine residues of CD44s may also be involved in the disulfide linkage with one or more cysteine residues in p185 HER2 . The question of which cysteine residues in human CD44s are directly responsible for forming disulfide linkages with p185 HER2 is currently under investigation in our laboratory. The association of p185 HER2 with other surface molecules via disulfide linkages has been reported previously (27Adelsman M.A. Huntley B.K. Maihle N.J. J. Virol. 1996; 70: 2533-2544Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Further analyses using double immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy also support the notion that CD44s (Fig.3 A) and p185 HER2 (Fig.3 B) are co-localized at the periphery of ovarian tumor cells (Fig. 3 C). Therefore, we believe that CD44s and p185 HER2 are physically linked in a complex in vivoin ovarian tumor cells such as SKOV3.ipl. HA has been shown to play an important role in several important physiological functions such as maintaining cartilage integrity, balancing homeostasis of water and plasma proteins in the intercellular matrix, and promoting mitosis and cell migration (28Laurent T.C. Fraser R.E. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2397-2404Crossref PubMed Scopus (2041) Google Scholar). In addition, degradation products of HA containing 3–25 disaccharide units are known to promote angiogenesis, which involves cell proliferation, migration, and tubule formation (29Lokeshwar V.B.

CD44 is the major hyaluronan cell surface receptor (32Underhill C. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 103: 293-298Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and cellular adhesion molecule in many different cell types (1Bourguignon L.Y.W. Curr. Top. Membr. 1996; 43: 293-312Crossref Scopus (24) Google Scholar,2Lesley J. Hyman R. Kincade P. Adv. Immunol. 1993; 54: 271-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (1025) Google Scholar). Specific HA binding motifs have been identified and localized in the extracellular domain of a number of CD44 isoforms (33Liao H.X. Lee D.M. levesque M.C. Haynes B.F. J. Immunol. 1995; 155: 3938-3945PubMed Google Scholar). In this study we examined the ability of ovarian tumor cells to adhere to HA-coated plates. Our data indicate that ovarian tumor cells display a high level of CD44-specific cell adhesion to HA-coated plates (TableI). After treatment with specific rat anti-CD44 antibody, the cells were largely inhibited from displaying HA-mediated cell adhesion (Table I). These results confirm that CD44s is a hyaluronan receptor required for HA-mediated cell adhesion in these ovarian cells.Table ICell adhesion assaysCellsRadioactivitycpmCD44-mediated cell adhesion to HA-coated plates in SKOV3.ipl human ovarian tumor cellsSKOV3.ipl cells78,000SKOV3.ipl cells pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody7,200Effects of E1A on CD44-mediated cell adhesion to HA-coated plates in various human ovarian tumor cellsSKOV3.ipl.Efs cells75,000SKOV3.ipl,Efs cells pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody7,000SKOV3.ipl.E1A cells6,500SKOV3.ipl,E1A cells pretreated with anti-CD44 antibody550Cells were labeled with Tran35S-methionine.

All numbers represent an average of triplicate determinations of at least three separate experiments with a S.D. < ±5%. Adenovirus 5 E1A (E1A) products have been shown to be involved in regulating the expression of a number of important regulatory molecules (e.g. p185 HER2 and nm23) in fibroblast model systems (34Yu D. Hamada J. Zhang H. Nicolson G.L. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2263-2270PubMed Google Scholar, 35Rosengard A.M. Krutzsch H.C. Shearn A. Bigg J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M.K. King C.R. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). For example, the E1Aproducts act as effective suppressors of invasion and metastasis in p185 HER2 -overexpressed 3T3 mouse fibroblasts (34Yu D. Hamada J. Zhang H. Nicolson G.L. Hung M.C. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 2263-2270PubMed Google Scholar). In addition,E1A is involved in elevating the expression of nm23(a metastatic tumor suppressor gene) in ras-transfected rat embryo fibroblasts (35Rosengard A.M. Krutzsch H.C. Shearn A. Bigg J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M.K. King C.R. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). These results suggest that E1A genes play an important role in suppressing certain cellular events leading to the metastatic cascade. Previously, it has been shown that introduction of the E1A gene into SKOV3.ipl ovarian cancer cells (e.g. SKOV3.ipl.E1A2) results in the suppression of p185 HER2 -induced metastatic properties, including tumor cell adhesion and invasion (23Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar, 35Rosengard A.M. Krutzsch H.C. Shearn A. Bigg J.R. Barker E. Margulies I.M.K. King C.R. Liotta L.A. Steeg P.S. Nature. 1989; 342: 177-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). In this study we determined the effects of E1A genes on regulating CD44s and p185 HER2 interaction in ovarian tumor cells. Our results indicate that control cells (SKOV3.ipl.Efs) withoutE1A (Fig. 4, A–D,lane 1) express very high levels of p185 HER2 (Fig.4 B, lane 1). However, in transfectants (e.g. SKOV3.ipl.E1A2) (Fig. 4, A–D, lane 2) containing E1A (Fig. 4 A, lane 2)), p185 HER2 oncogene expression is significantly suppressed (Fig. 4 B, lane 2). These results are consistent with previous findings reported by Hung and co-workers (22Hung M.C. Zhang X. Yen D.-H. Zhang H.-Z. He G.-P. Zhang T.-Q. Shi D.R. Cancer Lett. 1992; 61: 95-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar,23Yu D. Wolf J.K. Scanlon M. Price J.E. Hung M.C. Cancer Res. 1993; 53: 891-898PubMed Google Scholar). Most importantly, CD44s expression in those transfectants containing E1A is also concomitantly decreased (Fig.4 C, lane 2) as compared with that in the control cells (Fig. 4 C, lane 1). Our recent results indicate that up-regulation of p185 HER2 and CD44s promotes CD44s-mediated cell adhesion (36Zhu D. Bourguignon L.Y.W. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 2309-2314PubMed Google Scholar). The fact that CD44s-mediated cell adhesion to HA-coated plates displays significant reduction in theE1A transfectants (Table I) suggests that down-regulation of these two molecules (e.g. CD44s and p185 HER2 ) blocks CD44s-mediated cell adhesion function. Other cellular proteins, such as actin, do not show any detectable changes in the E1Atransfectants (Fig. 4 D, lane 2) as compared with the untransfected cells (Fig. 4 D, lane 1). This tightly coupled interaction between CD44s and p185 HER2 may be very important for the early onset of the metastatic cascade during ovarian cancer. HA is also known to be involved in a number of pathophysiological processes. For example, high levels of HA in solid tumors (e.g. breast, lung, hepatic, and bladder tumors) appear to be closely associated with tumor progression and metastasis (37Knudson W. Biswas C. Li X.-Q. Nemec R.E. Toole B.P. Evered D. Whelan J. The Biology of Hyaluronan. Ciba Foundation, London1989: 150-169Google Scholar, 38Pauli B.U. Knudson W. Hum. Pathol. 1988; 19: 628-639Crossref PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). In this study, we found that CD44s-associated p185 HER2 tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 5 A,lower panel, lane 1 and subsequent ovarian tumor cell growth are significantly stimulated by HA treatment, as detected by anti-phosphotyrosine-mediated immunoblotting techniques (Fig.5 A, upper panel, lane 1) and an in vitro growth assay (Fig. 5 B, a). We believe that HA-triggered p185 HER2 kinase activation (Fig. 5 A upper panel, lane 1) and cell growth up-regulation (Fig.5 B, a) are CD44s-specific since control samples (either without HA treatment (Fig. 5, A, upper panel, lane 2 and B, b) or pretreated with anti-CD44 to inhibit HA binding effects (10Bourguignon L.Y.W. Lokeshwar V.B. Chen X. Kerrick W.G.L. J. Immunol. 1993; 151: 6634-6644PubMed Google Scholar) (Fig. 5,A, upper panel, lane 3 and B, c) followed by HA treatments) display very low levels of CD44s (Fig. 5,A, lower panel, lanes 2 and 3)-associated p185 HER2 tyrosine kinase activity (Fig. 5 A,upper panel, lanes 2 and 3) and tumor cell growth (Fig. 5, B, b and c). These findings clearly demonstrate that both CD44s-associated p185 HER2 kinase activity and ovarian tumor cell growth are stimulated by HA. Recently, we found that the formation of a CD44·p185 HER2 complex plus HA-mediated p185 HER2 kinase activation and cell growth also occur in other ovarian tumor cells (e.g. SKOV-3 and CAOV, etc.) as well as breast tumor cells (e.g. Met-1 and MDA231, etc.). 2L. Y. W. Bourguignon, H. Zhu, A. Chu, N. Iida, L. Zhang, and M.-C. Hung, preliminary observations. A number of other molecules (including epidermal growth factor, neuregulins, neu-activating factor, ascites sialglycoprotein-2, a factor from bovine kidney (NEL-GF), and unknown factors in serum) have been implicated as potential agonists for the activation of p185 HER2 -linked tyrosine kinase activities (20Pele E. Yarden Y. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 815-823Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Therefore, we believe that the results of this study provide new evidence that the physiological ligand for CD44s, HA, may also play an important role in activating CD44s-associated p185 HER2 kinase activity required for the onset of tumor cell growth and spreading during ovarian tumor development.

https://openalex.org/W2093498304,"Bovine cornea contains three unique keratan sulfate proteoglycans (KSPGs), of which two (lumican and keratocan) have been characterized using molecular cloning. The gene for the third protein (KSPG25) has not been identified. This study examined the relationship between the KSPG25 protein and the gene for osteoglycin, a 12-kDa bone glycoprotein. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of KSPG25 occurs in osteoglycin cDNA cloned from bovine cornea. The osteoglycin amino acid sequence makes up the C-terminal 47% of the deduced sequence of the KSPG25 protein. Antibodies to osteoglycin reacted with intact corneal KSPG, with KSPG25 protein, and with a 36-kDa protein, distinct from lumican and keratocan. KSPG25-related proteins, not modified with keratan sulfate, were also detected in several connective tissues. Northern blot analysis showed mRNA transcripts of 2.4, 2.5, and 2.6 kilobases in numerous tissues with the 2.4-kilobase transcript enriched in ocular tissues. Ribonuclease protection analysis detected several protected KSPG25 mRNA fragments, suggesting alternate splicing of KSPG25 transcripts. We conclude that the full-length translation product of the gene producing osteoglycin is a corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycan, also present in many non-corneal tissues without keratan sulfate chains. The multiple size protein products of this gene appear to result from in situ proteolytic processing and/or alternative splicing of mRNA. The name mimecan is proposed for this gene and its products.

The specialized nature of corneal proteoglycans was recognized almost 60 years ago with the initial description of keratan sulfate, the most abundant glycosaminoglycan in cornea (1Suzuki M. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1939; 30: 185-191Crossref Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Corneal keratan sulfate is a highly sulfated, linear polymer of N-acetyllactosamine, linked to asparagine residues in the KSPG core proteins (2Hascall V.C. Prog. Clin. Biol. Res. 1982; 110B: 3-15Google Scholar). The unusual abundance of keratan sulfate in the cornea and studies of heritable metabolic diseases suggest that the KSPG molecules are essential in maintenance of corneal transparency (3Hassell J.R.

Understanding the role of the KSPGs in corneal transparency, their interactions with cells and other matrix molecules, and the tissue-specific nature of their biosynthesis requires complete knowledge of their structure. Although we have excellent information regarding the carbohydrate components of the KSPGs, the core proteins as representatives of the primary KSPG gene products are still not fully understood.

A third 25-kDa KSPG core protein, KSPG25, was recognized as unique from lumican and keratocan, but its primary sequence is not yet known. The deduced amino acid sequences of lumican and keratocan identify them as members of a group of small leucine-rich proteoglycans (SLRPs) (7Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Brown S.J. Vergnes J.P.

These proteins share a common β-pleated sheet tertiary structure generated by a series of characteristic leucine-rich repeats. Other members of this group are common components of the extracellular matrix of a number of tissues. They include another keratan sulfate-containing proteoglycan, fibromodulin, and the dermatan sulfate proteoglycans decorin biglycan, and epiphycan (9Iozzo R.V. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol.

A seventh member of the family, isolated from bone, was originally called osteoinductive factor and later renamed osteoglycin (10Bentz H. Nathan R.M. Rosen D.M. Armstrong R.M. Thompson A.Y.

The deduced amino acid sequence obtained from the cDNA of this gene suggests it is potentially a proteoglycan and a member of the SLRP family (12Madisen L. Neubauer M. Plowman G. Rosen D. Segarini P. Dasch J. Thompson A. Ziman J. Bentz H. Purchio A.F. DNA Cell Biol. 1990; 9: 303-309Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). The only known protein product of this gene is osteoglycin, a 12-kDa protein representing the C-terminal 35% of the coded protein (13Bentz H. Chang R.J. Thompson A.Y. Glaser C.B. Rosen D.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 5024-5029Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Osteoglycin is thought to be a proteolytic fragment of a larger translation product; however, a full-length protein has not been identified. In this study, we identified the KSPG25 protein as a product of this gene, and found that the KSPG25 protein is secreted by keratocytes as a full-length translation product. We propose the name mimecan for this gene and its products. Preparation of bovine corneal KSPG, endo-β-galactosidase, and antibody against KSPG proteins has been described previously (14Fukuda M.N.

Antibodies recognizing the N terminus of the KSPG25 protein were affinity-purified from anti-KSPG γ-globulin by two rounds of adsorption to a 2-ml column of SulfoLink gel (Pierce), on which was immobilized 5 mg of a synthetic peptide matching the deduced N-terminal sequence of KSPG25 (NH2-DENITPLPPKKENDEMPTC-COOH) using a procedure described previously (8Corpuz L.M.

Monoclonal antibody against bovine osteoglycin was generously donated by Celtrix Biologicals (18Dasch J.R. Pace D.R. Avis P.D. Bentz H. Chu S. Connect. Tissue Res. 1993; 30: 11-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). N-Glycanase was obtained from Genzyme Corp. (Cambridge, MA). Tissues from slaughter-aged steers were minced and extracted in 10 volumes of 4 m guanidine-HCl in the presence of protease inhibitors (17Conrad G.W. Ager-Johnson P. Woo M.L. J. Biol.

Before electrophoresis, the extracts were treated overnight at 4 °C with 0.015 units/ml affinity-purified endo-β-galactosidase (14Fukuda M.N. J. Biol.

Total RNA was isolated from different bovine tissues and from cultured bovine keratocytes by extraction with guanidinium thiocyanate as described previously (8Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L.

First strand cDNA was generated from 5 μg of total RNA from cornea and keratocytes using cloned Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase (Superscript I, Life Technologies, Inc.) using the buffers supplied by the manufacturer. The single-stranded cDNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using a pair of oligonucleotide primers designed from the published bovine osteoglycin cDNA sequence. Primer pairs BOG307 (AATATTGCTTCGATGGTCTGC, sense) and BOG1233 (AGCGTATCTCTTCAATGCGG, antisense) were used to generate a 926-bp amplified product. This product was gel-purified and used as a template for primers BOG 472 (CAGCACCACCATCTCAGC, sense), and BOG 1080 (CCAAGTAGAGGAAGGAGAGG, antisense) to produce a 608-base pair amplified product. These fragments were cloned into the pGEM-T plasmid (Promega Corp., Middleton, WI). Sequence analysis confirmed that the two fragments represent a partial sequence of the bovine osteoglycin cDNA, with the shorter 608-bp fragment contained within the larger 926-bp fragment. A Uni-ZAP-XR cDNA library made from cultured bovine keratocytes as described previously (8Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.W. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol.

Initial screening was done at high plating density (20–30 × 103 plaques/150-mm plate) and indicated high abundance (about 0.08%) of clones for the KSPG25 cDNA in this library. Forty-six positive clones were selected for subsequent rescreening at a low plating density. After the third screening, two clones were excised from the phage vector and subjected to sequence analysis. The clone with the largest insert (clone 60) was used for further studies. Full bi-directional DNA sequence of the insert DNA was obtained with a redundancy of >2 in each direction using automated sequencing with primers generated from the published sequence (8Corpuz L.M.

TheHindIII-BglII DNA fragment of bovine keratocan cDNA (positions 592–961) was cloned into theHindIII-BamHI sites of the pGEM-1 plasmid (Promega). Antisense RNA for RNase protection was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from this plasmid linearized with HindIII. For lumican, a BglII-NruI DNA fragment of bovine lumican (positions 548–1099) was cloned into theBamHI-SmaI sites of pGEM-1. The lumican antisense RNA probe was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase from this plasmid linearized with HindIII. For KSPG25, a 662-bpHindIII fragment (positions 298–960) was cloned into theHindIII site of pGEM-1. The orientation with respect to the vector's polylinker was determined by restriction enzyme mapping. KSPG25 antisense RNA probe was generated by SP6 RNA polymerase from the plasmid linearized with PstI. In vitrotranscription reactions with SP6 and T7 RNA polymerases were performed as described previously (20Tasheva E. Roufa D. Genes Dev. 1995; 9: 304-316Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) using [α-32P]rUTP (NEN Life Science Products) at a specific activity of 2 × 104 mCi/mmol. Integrity of the RNA transcripts was examined by agarose gel electrophoresis. For RNase protection, 1 μg of total RNA and 1 × 106 cpm of each probe were dried under vacuum and resuspended in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (80% deionized formamide, 0.4 m NaCl, 40 mm PIPES, pH 6.4, 1 mm EDTA). Samples were heated at 90 °C for 3 min, and hybridization was carried out at 60 °C for 14–16 h. RNase A/T1 mixture (Ambion, Austin, TX) was added to each sample and digestion was carried out for 30 min at 37 °C. Then 20 μl of 10% SDS and 10 μl 10 mg/ml proteinase K were added to each sample, and incubation was continued for 30 min at 37 °C. Samples were extracted with phenol/chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. The protected fragments were resolved on 6% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and detected by autoradiography of the dried gel. RNase protection was performed on two independent RNA preparations. Northern blotting and hybridization were carried out on 5 μg of total RNA from keratocyte cultures and various bovine tissues essentially as described previously (8Corpuz L.M. Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Bottomley G.W. Prakash S. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9753-9759Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (196) Google Scholar). We previously reported a 13-residue amino acid sequence obtained from the 25-kDa protein of bovine KSPG (5Funderburgh J.L. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8297-8303Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A search of computer data bases of known sequences revealed a close similarity between this sequence and the open reading frame of a cDNA (GenBank accession number M37974) that codes for a protein originally named bovine osteoinductive factor, later renamed osteoglycin. As shown in thetop panel of Fig. 1, the match occurs in the interior of the deduced sequence not at the N terminus of a protein, and differs from the experimentally determined KSPG25 sequence by at least 2 amino acids. The similarity, nevertheless, was at least 10 of 13 amino acids, strongly suggesting a relationship between KSPG25 and this gene. We searched for the presence of M37974-related mRNA in bovine cornea by reverse transcription-PCR using two sets of primers made from the published cDNA sequence. As shown in the bottom panel of Fig. 1, DNA of the predicted size was amplified by an initial set of primers from both cultured keratocyte and corneal cDNA. Re-amplification of this product with a inner set of primers also gave a DNA product of the size predicted from clone M37974. Cloning of the PCR product and subsequent sequencing (data not shown) confirmed that the cDNA amplified from corneal mRNA was closely related or identical to the M37974 sequence. The DNA insert in the cloned PCR product was used as a probe to screen a λ Zap expression library made from cultured bovine keratocyte mRNA. A purified clone that hybridized with the PCR product was sequenced and found to be identical to the published bovine cDNA sequence coding for osteoglycin, with the exception of eight single-base locations. Of these differences, shown withasterisks in Fig. 2, the most significant occurs at base 665, in which replacement of adenosine in the published sequence with cytosine resulted in the alteration of the deduced amino acid sequence at position 79 from Asn to Thr. This change occurs at the observed mismatch between the published and experimental amino acid sequence (Fig. 1) resolving one of the discrepancies between the published and experimentally determined amino acid sequence. As shown in Fig. 3, the experimentally determined KSPG25 sequence represents the N terminus of a 233-amino acid protein with a calculated molecular size of 25 kDa. The experimentally determined sequence of osteoglycin comprises the C-terminal 105 amino acids of the KSPG25 protein. A full-length mature protein coded by this cDNA would have a calculated molecular mass of 34 kDa excluding an 18-amino acid signal peptide. We found previously that three unique core proteins can be separated from purified corneal KSPG by a combination of ion exchange chromatography and SDS-PAGE after enzymatic removal of the keratan sulfate chains (6Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteins, separated as shown in Fig.4 A, were subjected to immunoblotting with two antibodies having specificity for the osteoglycin gene product. In Fig. 4 B, proteins were detected using an antiserum specific for the amino acid sequence from the N terminus of the KSPG25 protein (amino acids 77–95). In Fig.4 C, a monoclonal antibody raised to the bovine osteoglycin protein was also used. In both cases, the antibodies bound primarily to the 36-kDa band in lane 1, shown previously to be a glycosylated form of the KSPG25 protein (6Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In longer exposures of these blots, weak interaction was also observed of both antibodies with a protein band in lane 2 in the 48–50-kDa size range (see below). Immunoblotting of unfractionated corneal extract with either of these two KSPG25-specific antibodies showed immunoreactive compounds separated as a smear of molecules with large and heterogeneous molecular sizes (Fig. 4 D, lane 1). Digestion of the keratan sulfate in the extract using endo-β-galactosidase, an enzyme that hydrolyzes internal bonds of keratan sulfate chains, released the antigenic proteins into two bands of 36 and 48 kDa (Fig.4 D, lane 2). Release of the osteoglycin-related proteins by endo-β-galactosidase confirms these proteins as core proteins of corneal keratan sulfate proteoglycans. The nature of the two antigenically related proteins in the corneal extract was further investigated by ion exchange high performance liquid chromatography separation of KSPG proteins after treatment with endo-β-galactosidase, shown in Fig.5 A. The elution characteristics of these proteins under these conditions are dependent on their substitution with sialic acids (6Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14226-14231Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Distribution of lumican and keratocan in the fractions was identified after SDS-PAGE by immunoblotting with antibodies specific for these two proteins (Fig.5 B). In Fig. 5 C, immunoblotting of the separated proteins using the anti-osteoglycin monoclonal antibody is shown. The smaller (25 kDa) form of the KSPG25 protein co-elutes with keratocan, but can be distinguished by its size. The larger protein reacting with the anti-osteoglycin monoclonal antibody eluted later than the 25-kDa form. Its elution position partially overlapped the elution position of lumican but was distinct from lumican. Lumican eluted in two peaks under these conditions, but the larger of KSPG25-related protein was detected only in a trailing shoulder of the first lumican peak. This pattern of reactivity shows that the osteoglycin antibody identified a unique KSPG25-related protein in these fractions and was not merely exhibiting cross-reactivity with lumican or keratocan. Multiple sizes of KSPG proteins have been observed previously in species other than bovine, suggesting that KSPG25 may not be limited to bovine cornea (16Jost C.J. Funderburgh J.L. Mann M. Hassell J.R. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 13336-13341Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 21Funderburgh J.L. Stenzel-Johnson P.R. Chandler J.W. Curr. Eye Res. 1983; 2: 769-776Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). We examined purified KSPG preparations from mouse, human, bovine, and chicken with the monoclonal anti-osteoglycin antibody. As shown in Fig. 6 A, treatment of human KSPG with endo-β-galactosidase released a protein, somewhat smaller than the bovine KSPG25 protein, that reacted strongly with the antibody. The other KSPG preparations did not show specific reactivity with this antibody (data not shown). These results indicate that the protein product of the gene producing osteoglycin is a KSPG core protein in human as well as bovine corneas. The experimentally determined N terminus of the bovine 25-kDa corneal KSPG protein occurs at amino acid residue 77 of the deduced amino acid sequence, immediately preceded by a lysine, a site of potential cleavage by serine proteases. The smaller form of this protein may arise, therefore, from proteolytic cleavage of a larger form of this protein. In Fig. 6 B, immune precipitation of pulse-labeled proteins in keratocyte cultures was carried out using anti-KSPG25 peptide antibody to examine potential precursor-product relationship of the large and small forms of the corneal KSPG25 proteins. After a 30-min labeling period with [35S]methionine and a 2-h chase in unlabeled medium, KSPG25 proteins were precipitated and treated with N-glycanase to deglycosylate the proteins fully, and then separated by SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 6 B, the major labeled component precipitated was a protein exhibiting a molecular mass estimated as 36 kDa, slightly larger than the 34-kDa mature protein predicted from the sequence in Fig. 2. Little intracellular KSPG25 protein was present at 4 and 8 h after the pulse, but a similar 36-kDa protein was immune-precipitated in the culture medium after 4 h and was present at 8 and 16 h after the labeling. A smaller, 25-kDa form was not observed during this time. In addition to cornea, a number of tissues were found to have proteins recognized by the antibodies to the KSPG25 protein. As shown in Fig.6 C, proteins reacting to the antibody were most abundant in cornea, sclera, cartilage, aorta, and skin. Antigenic proteins in extracts of bone were much less abundant than in other tissues. The intact antigenic molecules in non-corneal tissues were smaller and more homogeneous than those in cornea, and the molecular size was not reduced as dramatically by treatment with endo-β-galactosidase. These results indicate that only in cornea is the KSPG25 protein linked to long, sulfated keratan sulfate chains. The proteins released by endo-β-galactosidase of non-corneal tissue extracts exhibited a molecular mass of about 44–46 kDa, clearly differing from the two forms of corneal KSPG25. Northern blotting using total RNA from a range of bovine tissues (Fig. 7) showed the presence of KSPG25 transcripts in many tissues. Binding of the probe to corneal and scleral RNA was strongest, suggesting higher steady state concentrations of KSPG mRNA in these tissues. KSPG25 mRNA was distributed more widely than lumican transcripts, and both were more generally present than keratocan mRNA. Unlike lumican and keratocan, several sizes of KSPG25 transcripts were present in different tissues. The major form in cornea and cultured keratocytes of 2.4 kb was clearly distinguishable from the 2.5-kb form present in most tissues. A minor 2.6-kb band was present in some tissues as well. RNase protection was carried out on samples of total RNA using mixed probes for KSPG25, lumican, and keratocan. Using this technique (shown in Fig. 8), the abundance of the protected fragments reflects the quantitative relationships among these transcripts within a single tissue as well as among tissues. Of several antisense probes examined, all KSPG25 probes produced multiple protected fragments, suggesting the possibility of splice variants of KSPG25 mRNA. The 660-base probe used in Fig. 8 generated two protected fragments <600 bases. The intensity of the these protected mRNA fragments varied among the different tissues. The smaller fragment was particularly strong in cornea and sclera, whereas the larger fragment was weak in these tissues but represented the strongest band in several other tissues. The single protected lumican mRNA fragment was found with similar intensity to the KSPG25 mRNA but in fewer overall tissues. Keratocan was the least highly expressed mRNA and of the most limited distribution. RNase protection products of keratocan were present in detectable levels only in cornea, sclera, and cultured keratocytes. The work presented here ties together independent lines of research to show that two proteins having no apparent a priori relationship to one another are actually products of the same gene, and are likely to be proteolytic products of the same propeptide. The relationship between KSPG25 and osteoglycin was established initially in the identity of 10 of 13 amino acids in a GenBank search, a coincidence that is unlikely in unrelated proteins. We went on to identify mRNA with the osteoglycin sequence in cornea and to show that the KSPG25 amino acid sequence was part of the open reading frame present in this RNA. Northern blotting showed that this mRNA was present in many tissues but was most abundant in sclera, cornea, and cultured keratocytes. A monoclonal antibody made to bovine osteoglycin and a polyclonal antibody affinity-purified against the KSPG25 N-terminal peptide (a sequence of amino acids not present in the osteoglycin protein) both bound the same protein. This protein was identified as KSPG25 by its chromatographic properties, its attachment to keratan sulfate, and its molecular size on SDS-PAGE. All of these observations led to the conclusion that the gene originally identified as that producing osteoglycin is the gene for the corneal KSPG 25-kDa protein. The protein known as osteoglycin, isolated from demineralized bone, was originally named osteoinductive factor (OIF). Later, it was determined that co-purifying bone morphogenic proteins were the source of its growth stimulatory activity in this preparation, and the protein and its gene were renamed osteoglycin. Our current results add a new level of understanding about this gene and its products. Western and Northern blotting show that both mRNA and protein products of this gene are common in connective tissues but most abundant in eye tissue. Immunoreactive material was not abundant in extracts of bone, demonstrating that expression of this gene is not bone-related. The major protein bands detected by the anti-osteoglycin monoclonal antibody were at least as large as the corneal KSPG25; thus, the 12-kDa “osteoglycin” form of this protein is not common. These observations suggest that the name osteoglycin may be inappropriate for this gene and its major translation products. The small and elusive nature of this protein suggested the name “mimecan” for this gene and its products, based on the deceitful dwarf, Mime, from Wagnerian opera and Norse legend whose head continued to survive and was consulted as a source of wisdom even after being cleaved from its body. The probes we used to detect the mimecan products identified several forms of this protein and its mRNA. Western blotting identified a minor corneal KSPG core protein antigenically related to KSPG25 but of a size similar to lumican. This material exhibited different chromatographic properties from lumican and keratocan and thus did not appear to be a result of antigenic cross-reactivity with these proteins, suggesting the possibility that it was a full-length translation product of the mimecan cDNA. Immune precipitation of mimecan-related proteins from pulse-labeled keratocyte cell cultures identified only a larger not the 25-kDa form. The estimate of 36 kDa for this protein after enzymatic deglycosylation makes it consistent with a full-length translation product having calculated molecular mass of 34 kDa, based on the cDNA sequence. Our interpretation of these results is that the mimecan gene product is secreted as a full-length protein and in situ is cleaved to form the 25-kDa form that predominates in the adult bovine cornea. A Lys residue just next to the N terminus of the 25-kDa protein could serve as a cleavage site for serine proteases. Proteolytic cleavage might also be the explanation for the apparently larger size of the antigenically related protein present in non-ocular tissues. However, the data are not conclusive regarding the origin of the non-corneal form of the mimecan protein. Northern blotting revealed three distinct size classes of mimecan mRNA that varied in abundance depending on the tissue source (Fig.7). The smallest (2.4 kb) form was predominant in cornea and sclera. Such heterogeneity can arise as a result of alternate splicing of RNA or by alternate usage of polyadenylation sites. The RNase protection assay (Fig. 8) used a probe near the 5′ end of the mRNA that included about 300 bases of the translated region. This assay detected two sizes of protected fragments that varied in intensity depending on the tissue source. As with the Northern blotting, the smaller form was predominant in cornea and sclera. These results are consistent with the presence in cornea and sclera of a 5′ splice variant that is about 100 bases shorter than the predominant mimecan RNAs of non-ocular tissues. Should the splice site occur in the translated region of the mRNA, it could be responsible for the difference in protein sizes observed between ocular and non-ocular tissues (shown in Fig. 6 C). Investigations are currently under way in our laboratory to clarify the nature of these heterogeneities in mimecan mRNA and protein size. Since its initial cloning, the mimecan gene has been recognized as a member of the gene family known as SLRPs. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of the mimecan protein with that of lumican and keratocan does not show the high sequence identity present between lumican and keratocan. However, comparison of structural domains among all three proteins, as shown in Fig. 9, indicates good conservation of certain molecular features. Each of the three proteins has one or more tyrosines adjacent to acidic amino acids (Glu or Asp) in the N-terminal region. These represent consensus sites for tyrosine sulfation (22Antonsson P. Heinegard D. Oldberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16859-16861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Each of the three KSPG proteins has 4 cysteines immediately preceding the leucine-rich domains. Each has five evenly spaced leucine-rich domains following the N-terminal cysteines and a C-terminal leucine-rich domain centered between two Cys moieties spaced 33/34 residues apart. One consensus site for N-linked glycosylation is common among all three sequences, just N-terminal to the fifth leucine-rich repeat. This site has recently been shown to be modified with keratan sulfate in chicken lumican, and thus serves as the leading candidate for the location of the single keratan sulfate chain attached to mimecan (23Hassell J. Dunlevy J.J.-P.V. Neame P. Invest. Ophthalmol. Vis. Sci. 1997; 38: S681Google Scholar). Closer comparison of these features may help us understand exactly what sequence elements are required for a SLRP protein to become a KSPG. As with lumican and keratocan, the mimecan protein is present in many tissues as a non-sulfated glycoprotein. Treatment with endo-β-galactosidase shifted the molecular size of this protein up to 10 kDa in several tissues indicating that, like arterial lumican, these proteins are modified with unsulfated oligolactosamine (24Funderburgh J.L. Funderburgh M.L. Mann M.M. Conrad G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24773-24777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In cornea, mimecan as well as the other two KSPG proteins is transcribed and translated severalfold greater than the other tissues in which they are found. This phenomenon appears to be a new example of the phenomenon known as gene sharing. In the lens, genes for common intracellular proteins are massively overexpressed to produce the crystalline proteins that provide transparency to this tissue (25Piatigorsky J. Kantorow M. Gopal-Srivastava R. Tomarev S.I. EXS. 1994; 71: 241-250PubMed Google Scholar). Recent studies of transketolase in the corneal epithelium suggest a similar mechanism may also be important to corneal transparency (26Sax C.M. Salamon C. Kays W.T. Guo J. Yu F.X. Cuthbertson R.A. Piatigorsky J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 33568-33574Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). In the keratocytes, it would appear that an entirely analogous process is taking place with a family of common extracellular proteins. In the stroma, however, a tissue-specific glycosylation of these proteins converts them from non-sulfated matrix glycoproteins to a unique class of proteoglycans. Elucidation of mechanisms by which keratocytes up-regulate expression of these genes and then provide unique glycosylation to selected sites on the proteins will greatly enhance our understanding of how this tissue obtains transparency and how it might be restored in pathological situations.

The HMG domain is a DNA-binding and DNA-bending motif comprising about 80 amino acid residues. It has been shown that SRY and SOX9 are nuclear proteins. Using normal or mutant SRY-β-galactosidase and SOX9-β-galactosidase fusion proteins in transfection studies involving COS-7 cells, we have identified two nuclear localization signals (NLSs) within the HMG domains of both proteins that can independently direct the fusion proteins into the nucleus. Only mutational inactivation of both NLS motifs resulted in complete exclusion of the fusion proteins from the nucleus. The NLS sequences are located at the N and C termini of the HMG domain and are a bipartite NLS motif and a basic cluster NLS motif, respectively. Both NLS motifs are conserved in the HMG domains of other transcription factors. The implications of the present results are discussed regarding (a) the apparent dual function of certain basic amino acid residues in the HMG domain of SRY in both DNA binding and in nuclear localization and (b) the possible control of SOX9 in early gonadal differentiation at the level of nuclear translocation.

We have shown in similar transfection assays that SOX9 also functions as a transcription factor, contains a C-terminal transactivation domain (13.Nat. Genet. 13, 230–232Südbeck, P., Schmitz, M. L., Baeuerle, P. A., and Scherer, G. Nat. Genet., 13, 230–232.Google Scholar) and can bind via its HMG domain to the motif AACAAT (14Meyer J. Südbeck P. Held M. Wagner T. Schmitz M.L. Eggermont E.

Recently, mouse Sox9 was found to be expressed in the gonadal anlage of both sexes, with expression increasing in the developing testis and decreasing in the developing ovary, consistent with a role forSOX9/Sox9 in Sertoli cell differentiation (15Morais da Silva S.

Development (Camb.). 1996; 122: 2813-2822Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).As transcription factors, SRY and SOX9 must gain access to the nucleus. Studies on nuclear localization indicate that transport across the nuclear envelope is an active process mediated by one or more nuclear localization signal sequences (NLSs), usually present in the protein itself or in a cofactor (for review, see Refs. 17Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar and 18Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). With some exceptions, two main types of NLS motifs exist. One is a short cluster of mainly basic amino acids (arginine and/or lysine), its prototype found in the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (19Kalderon D. Roberts B.L. Richardson W.D. Smith A.E. Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). The other is a bipartite NLS motif that comprises two basic amino acids, a spacer of about 10–15 residues consisting of any amino acid, followed by generally three basic residues, as first described for nucleoplasmin (17Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Specialized NLS-binding transporter proteins that carry NLS-containing proteins through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus have been identified recently (20Görlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar).Karyophilic NLS sequences are generally identified by their ability to direct an otherwise cytoplasmic protein to the nucleus when fused to it genetically or biochemically and by the effects of deletion or point mutations on nuclear entry (18Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Using these approaches with β-galactosidase as a reporter protein, we have identified two independent NLS motifs within the DNA-binding HMG domains of SRY and SOX9 that are both required for complete nuclear translocation. In a previous study, only one of the two NLSs had been identified in SRY (21Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.-P. Gozé C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).DISCUSSIONWe have observed that SRY and SOX9, two proteins essential for normal testis formation during human embryonic development, are located exclusively in the nuclei of transfected cells, in agreement with previous findings (15Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 21Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.-P. Gozé C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A bipartite and a basic cluster NLS motif were identified within the HMG domains of both proteins to be necessary and sufficient for effective nuclear import. Both NLS motifs are conserved in the HMG domains of other members of this family of transcription factors (Fig. 3). This is particularly evident for the subgroup of the SRY HMG-box (domain)-related SOX proteins. It is conceivable that most, if not all, HMG domain transcription factors utilize NLS motifs identical or related to those we have identified here. In fact, for the lymphocyte-specific factor LEF-1, which apparently lacks a bipartite NLS, the extended basic cluster at the C terminus of its HMG domain has been identified as its major NLS (Ref. 30Prieve M.G. Guttridge K.L. Munguia J.E. Waterman M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7654-7658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; see Fig. 3). Moreover, the recently identified SOX17 isoform that lacks essentially all of the HMG domain except the C-terminal basic cluster sequence was found to be localized in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (31Kanai Y. Kanai-Azuma M. Noce T. Saido T.C. Shiroishi T. Hayashi Y. Yazaki K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). By contrast, the full-length SOX17 with the complete HMG domain containing a bipartite and a basic cluster NLS motif very similar to those in SRY and SOX9 (Fig. 3) was completely nuclear (31Kanai Y. Kanai-Azuma M. Noce T. Saido T.C. Shiroishi T. Hayashi Y. Yazaki K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). This is in line with our observation of two independent NLSs in the HMG domain being necessary for complete nuclear translocation.While this work was in progress, a similar study by Poulat et al. (21Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.-P. Gozé C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar) appeared describing the N-terminal bipartite NLS in the HMG domain of SRY. These authors identified the same basic residues as essential components of this motif as the present study. However, in contrast to our findings, they describe nuclear import of SRY to be controlled solely by the bipartite NLS motif. By deleting the 20 N-terminal residues of the HMG domain that span this motif in full-length SRY, the little nuclear staining seen in transfected cells with an SRY antibody was interpreted as passive diffusion of the NLS-deleted protein into the nucleus. The same deletion in the context of an SRY-β-galactosidase fusion construct was reported, but not shown, to result in localization only in the cytoplasm. In contrast, in the present study, by mutating the relevant residues in both parts of the bipartite NLS but keeping the remainder of the HMG domain unchanged in construct SRY-M3, nuclear translocation was observed to be reduced but clearly not abolished. Only after additional deletion of the C-terminal basic cluster in construct SRY-D3-M3 did we observe complete nuclear exclusion (Fig. 1). Furthermore, when tested individually and outside the context of the HMG domain, not only the bipartite NLS, but also the basic cluster NLS, was able to direct the reporter protein into the nucleus, although not completely, as shown by constructs SRY-biNLS and SRY-bcNLS (Fig. 1). Corresponding results were obtained for SOX9 (Fig. 2). Our data do not allow one to decide as to which of the two NLS motifs is stronger. It is possible that under the experimental conditions used by Poulat et al. (21Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.-P. Gozé C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), the basic cluster NLS functioned as a slightly weaker nuclear localization signal than the bipartite NLS and therefore was not apparent in their study. A weakly functioning basic cluster NLS may also explain why a peptide corresponding to the entire SRY HMG domain but the first 16 residues failed to translocate coupled rabbit IgG to the nucleus in the study of Poulat et al. (21Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.-P. Gozé C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). It has been shown that weak NLS motifs require a high coupling ratio of peptide/IgG to drive the coupled protein into the nucleus (25Vandromme M. Cavadore J.-C. Bonnieu A. Froschlé A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).It is unlikely that another functional NLS, in addition to the two motifs in the HMG domain, is present in SRY. The fact that constructs SRY-D3-M1, -M2, and -M3, where these motifs are mutated, are localized only in the cytoplasm, argues against an NLS in the N-terminal 58 residues. The C-terminal 68 residues of SRY that are missing from these constructs contain only six basic residues that are not clustered. Furthermore, the HMG domain is the only conserved region in SRY sequences from different species (24Whitfield L.S. Lovell-Badge R. Goodfellow P.N. Nature. 1993; 364: 713-715Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar), suggesting that this domain is the only functionally relevant part. However, for SOX9, where we have only analyzed the HMG domain, we cannot fully exclude an additional NLS elsewhere in the 509-residue SOX9 protein, although a typical NLS motif is not apparent from the sequence.Two interesting features of the NLSs present in the HMG domain of SRY and SOX9 are shared by other nuclear proteins. The first relates to the phenomenon of multiple karyophilic signals. As in SRY and SOX9, other nuclear proteins contain two mutually independent NLSs that have to be inactivated together to completely abolish nuclear import (25Vandromme M. Cavadore J.-C. Bonnieu A. Froschlé A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 32Hall M.N. Craik C. Hiraoka Y. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6954-6958Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Such an arrangement may reduce the susceptibility of a nuclear protein to total loss of nuclear translocation by NLS-inactivating point mutations. The second feature is the location of the NLSs in a DNA-binding domain, a situation described for several other proteins, including a number of transcription factors such as MyoD (25Vandromme M. Cavadore J.-C. Bonnieu A. Froschlé A. Lamb N. Fernandez A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 4646-4650Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) or NF-κB (33Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K. Müller J.M. Fanning E. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). The apparent economic design of incorporating basic nuclear targeting sequences together with frequently basic DNA-binding residues in a single domain may be the result of an evolutionary process if, as has been suggested (17Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar), DNA-binding domains were the archetypal targeting signals during evolution of the nuclear membrane. Interestingly, in the case of SRY, the two arginine residues 62 and 75 in the bipartite NLS (residues 5 and 18 in Fig. 3) contribute to the DNA binding of the HMG domain, both by forming salt bridges to phosphate residues and by hydrophobic interactions with sugar residues, as revealed by the NMR structure of the SRY/DNA complex (10Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). Likewise, the lysine and arginine residues in LEF-1 that correspond to basic residues 61, 62, and 75 in the bipartite NLS of SRY (residues 4, 5, and 18 in Fig. 3) also interact with the DNA backbone in the LEF-1/DNA complex (11Love J.J. Li X. Case D.A. Giese K. Grosschedl R. Wright P.E. Nature. 1995; 376: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Since the NMR analysis of the SRY-DNA complex did not clearly resolve the residues of the basic cluster NLS (10Werner M.H. Huth J.R. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 705-714Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar), it is not known if some of these residues may also make DNA contacts. This is likely, however, in view of the fact that the C-terminal basic residues in the HMG domain of LEF-1 (see Fig. 3) contact the sugar-phosphate backbone extensively in the LEF-1/DNA complex (11Love J.J. Li X. Case D.A. Giese K. Grosschedl R. Wright P.E. Nature. 1995; 376: 791-795Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar).It thus appears that certain basic residues in both NLS motifs of the HMG domain serve two functions, playing a role both in nuclear import and in DNA binding. Sex reversal in XY females with amino acid substitutions affecting these basic residues in SRY, or in SOX9, may then result not only from impaired DNA binding but also from impaired nuclear uptake of the mutant protein. Whereas one such published mutation in SRY, R62G (26Affara N.A. Chalmers I.J. Ferguson-Smith M.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 785-789Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar), showed normal nuclear translocation, another mutation tested, R76L, resulted in reduced nuclear import (Fig.1). It is likely that this or similar mutations will be described in the future.There is growing evidence that gene transcription can be controlled by regulating the nuclear import of transcription factors. This can be achieved by interacting proteins masking one or several NLSs present in these factors, thus rendering these signals nonfunctional (33Henkel T. Zabel U. van Zee K. Müller J.M. Fanning E. Baeuerle P.A. Cell. 1992; 68: 1121-1133Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar, 34Chen C.-M.A. Kraut N. Groudine M. Weintraub H. Cell. 1996; 86: 731-741Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such a masking mechanism could account for the recent observation that SOX9 is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm of cells of the developing gonadal ridge in both sexes prior to day 11.5 of mouse embryogenesis, while it is completely nuclear at later stages of male gonadal development (15Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar). Whatever the nature of this hypothetical masking factor, the role of which may be an essential one in controlling mammalian sex determination, it is likely to interact with one or both NLS motifs in SOX9 identified in this study. Mammalian sex determination and early gonadal differentiation is a developmental process involving a cascade of regulatory gene interactions.

Cell. 1984; 39: 499-509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1854) Google Scholar). The other is a bipartite NLS motif that comprises two basic amino acids, a spacer of about 10–15 residues consisting of any amino acid, followed by generally three basic residues, as first described for nucleoplasmin (17Dingwall C. Laskey R.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1991; 16: 478-481Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1708) Google Scholar). Specialized NLS-binding transporter proteins that carry NLS-containing proteins through the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus have been identified recently (20Görlich D. Vogel F. Mills A.D. Hartmann E. Laskey R.A. Nature. 1995; 377: 246-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (409) Google Scholar). Karyophilic NLS sequences are generally identified by their ability to direct an otherwise cytoplasmic protein to the nucleus when fused to it genetically or biochemically and by the effects of deletion or point mutations on nuclear entry (18Garcia-Bustos J. Heitman J. Hall M.N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1071: 83-101Crossref PubMed Scopus (442) Google Scholar). Using these approaches with β-galactosidase as a reporter protein, we have identified two independent NLS motifs within the DNA-binding HMG domains of SRY and SOX9 that are both required for complete nuclear translocation. In a previous study, only one of the two NLSs had been identified in SRY (21Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.-P. Gozé C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). DISCUSSIONWe have observed that SRY and SOX9, two proteins essential for normal testis formation during human embryonic development, are located exclusively in the nuclei of transfected cells, in agreement with previous findings (15Morais da Silva S. Hacker A. Harley V. Goodfellow P. Swain A. Lovell-Badge R. Nat. Genet. 1996; 14: 62-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar, 21Poulat F. Girard F. Chevron M.-P. Gozé C. Rebillard X. Calas B. Lamb N. Berta P. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 128: 737-748Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). A bipartite and a basic cluster NLS motif were identified within the HMG domains of both proteins to be necessary and sufficient for effective nuclear import. Both NLS motifs are conserved in the HMG domains of other members of this family of transcription factors (Fig. 3). This is particularly evident for the subgroup of the SRY HMG-box (domain)-related SOX proteins. It is conceivable that most, if not all, HMG domain transcription factors utilize NLS motifs identical or related to those we have identified here. In fact, for the lymphocyte-specific factor LEF-1, which apparently lacks a bipartite NLS, the extended basic cluster at the C terminus of its HMG domain has been identified as its major NLS (Ref. 30Prieve M.G. Guttridge K.L. Munguia J.E. Waterman M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7654-7658Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar; see Fig. 3). Moreover, the recently identified SOX17 isoform that lacks essentially all of the HMG domain except the C-terminal basic cluster sequence was found to be localized in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of transfected cells (31Kanai Y. Kanai-Azuma M. Noce T. Saido T.C. Shiroishi T. Hayashi Y. Yazaki K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 667-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar). By contrast, the full-length SOX17 with the complete HMG domain containing a bipartite and a basic cluster NLS motif very similar to those in SRY and SOX9 (Fig. 3) was completely nuclear (31Kanai Y. Kanai-Azuma M. Noce T. Saido T.C. Shiroishi T. Hayashi Y. Yazaki K. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 667-681Crossref PubMed Sco"

Biol. Chem.271, 27072–27082). Mouse 3-OST cDNAs were isolated by proteolyzing the purified enzyme with Lys-C, sequencing the resultant peptides as well as the existing amino terminus, employing degenerate polymerase chain reaction primers corresponding to the sequences of the peptides as well as the amino terminus to amplify a fragment from LTA cDNA, and utilizing the resultant probe to obtain full-length enzyme cDNAs from a λ Zap Express LTA cDNA library. Human 3-OST cDNAs were isolated by searching the expressed sequence tag data bank with the mouse sequence, identifying a partial-length human cDNA and utilizing the clone as a probe to isolate a full-length enzyme cDNA from a λ TriplEx human brain cDNA library. The expression of wild-type mouse 3-OST as well as protein A-tagged mouse enzyme by transient transfection of COS-7 cells and the expression of both wild-type mouse and human 3-OST by in vitrotranscription/translation demonstrate that the two cDNAs directly encode both HSact conversion and 3-OST activities. The mouse 3-OST cDNAs exhibit three different size classes because of a 5′-untranslated region of variable length, which results from the insertion of 0–1629 base pairs (bp) between residues 216 and 217; however, all cDNAs contain the same open reading frame of 933 bp. The length of the 3′-untranslated region ranges from 301 to 430 bp. The nucleic acid sequence of mouse and human 3-OST cDNAs are ∼85% similar, encoding novel 311- and 307-amino acid proteins of 35,876 and 35,750 daltons, respectively, that are 93% similar. The encoded enzymes are predicted to be intraluminal Golgi residents, presumably interacting via their C-terminal regions with an integral membrane protein. Both 3-OST species exhibit five potentialN-glycosylation sites, which account for the apparent discrepancy between the molecular masses of the encoded enzyme (∼34 kDa) and the previously purified enzyme (∼46 kDa). The two 3-OST species also exhibit ∼50% similarity with all previously identified forms of the heparan biosynthetic enzymeN-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, which suggests that heparan biosynthetic enzymes share a common sulfotransferase domain.

This inhibition is secondary to the generation of 1:1 enzyme·AT complexes whose formation is dramatically enhanced by the mast cell product, heparin (2Rosenberg R.D. Damus P.S. J. Biol.

Nature. 1973; 246: 355-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (422) Google Scholar) hypothesized that endothelial cell surface heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) function in a similar fashion to accelerate coagulation enzyme inactivation by AT and therefore are responsible for the nonthrombogenic properties of blood vessels. We initially demonstrated that perfusion of the hind limbs of normal rodents and rodents deficient in mast cells with purified thrombin and AT leads to a greatly elevated rate of thrombin·AT complex formation and that the enzyme heparitinase as well as the natural heparin antagonist platelet factor 4 suppress the above acceleration (4Marcum J.A.

The biosynthesis of HSPGact requires generation of a core protein; assembly of a linkage region of four neutral sugars on specific serine attachment sites of the core protein; elongation of a GAG backbone composed of alternating N-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid residues; and modification of this homogenous copolymer by partial N-deacetylation with coupledN-sulfation of glucosamine residues, partial epimerization of glucuronic acid to iduronic acid residues, partial 2-O-sulfation of uronic acid residues, and partial 6-O-sulfation and partial 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues (reviewed in Ref. 9Lindahl U.

This multienzyme pathway generates HSPGact with regions of defined structure that contain the primary AT binding domain sequence found in anticoagulant heparin: uronic acid → glucosamine (N-acetyl/N-sulfate) 6-O-sulfate → glucuronic acid → glucosamine N-sulfate 3-O-sulfate (6-O-sulfate) → iduronic acid 2-O-sulfate → glucosamine N-sulfate 6-O-sulfate (10Atha D.H.

These reactions also produce HSPGinact with regions of varying monosaccharide sequence that lack the primary AT-binding domain. The structure-function relationships of the AT binding domain have been elucidated with heparin/heparan sulfate oligosaccharides in association with fast reaction kinetics and equilibrium binding assays. The 6-O-sulfate group on residue 2 and the 3-O-sulfate group on residue 4 function in a thermodynamically linked fashion to supply half of the binding energy for interaction with AT and trigger a conformational event that accelerates neutralization of specific coagulation proteases (11Atha D.H.

Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 6454-6461Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The amino and ester sulfate groups at residues 5 and 6 as well as carboxyl groups at other sites provide the other half of the binding energy for interaction with protease inhibitor (10Atha D.H.

Furthermore, monosaccharide sequences outside the primary AT binding domain are essential in facilitating inhibition of coagulation proteases other than factor Xa (18Oosta G.M. Gardner W.T.

The heparan biosynthetic enzymes must function in a coordinated manner to produce the AT binding domain, because the abundance of this sequence is much greater than predicted from a random assembly of constituents (32Casu B. Adv. Carbohydr. Chem. Biochem. 1985; 43: 51-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). The postulated regulatory mechanism must direct the biosynthetic enzymes to carry out the appropriate sequence of epimerization/sulfation reactions to generate the AT binding domain (33Shworak N.W.

We have previously described a soluble cell-free system to investigate HSact generation and developed assays for defining critical enzymatic components (35Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Liu J. Butler L.D. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27063-27071Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The investigations employing the above approach define a limiting HSact conversion activity that acts upon an excess precursor population to regulate cellular HSPGact biosynthesis (35Shworak N.W.

The major component of the limiting HSact conversion activity proved to be the long sought 3-OST, as documented by purification and characterization of this protein (26Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27072-27082Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The investigations utilizing the above technique also showed that HSact precursor (35% of the HSinact pool) is 3-O-sulfated to generate HSPGact and that HSinact precursor (65%) is 3-O-sulfated to produce HSPGinact. However, only a small fraction of either substrate is modified, with the remaining precursor population exiting the Golgi apparatus to appear on the cell surface. Thus, 3-OST constitutes a rate-limiting enzymatic activity that defines the level of cellular HSPGact generation. In contrast, the level of 3-OST activity does not appear to limit the mast cell formation of anticoagulant heparin, which contains a high proportion of molecules with the AT binding site (∼30%) (36Lam L.H. Silbert J.E. Rosenberg R.D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1976; 69: 570-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (370) Google Scholar); structural and biochemical analyses indicate that the precursor of anticoagulant heparin is present in minimal amounts (37Linhardt R.J.

Despite this biosynthetic difference, for both heparin and heparan, 3-O-sulfation does not guarantee the formation of anticoagulant GAG (33Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Colliec-Jouault S. Liu J.

This phenomenon may be secondary to alterations in the relative concentrations of two functional forms of 3-OST that differentially act upon HSact precursorversus HSinact precursor or changes in the relative levels of HSact precursor versus the HSinact precursor. The two functional forms of 3-OST may be due to two discrete gene products, posttranslational modification of a single gene product, or the presence of a regulatory factor that directs the enzyme to modify one or the other precursor. The relative levels of HSact precursor versusHSinact precursor are presumably controlled by earlier biosynthetic enzymes. In the current paper, we molecularly clone as well as express murine and human 3-OST, and we show that the expressed enzyme is able to 3-O-sulfate both HSactprecursor and HSinact precursor. Furthermore, the deduced structure of 3-OST, when compared with NST, defines a heparan sulfate sulfotransferase domain and also suggests a novel mechanism for limiting the action of the enzyme.

Unless otherwise stated, all cell lines were maintained in logarithmic growth by subculturing biweekly in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) containing 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 units/ml penicillin at 37 °C under 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere, as described previously (42Shworak N.W. Shirakawa M. Mulligan R.C. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21204-21214Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Exponentially growing cultures were generated by inoculating 54,000 cells/cm2 and incubating for 2 days, whereas postconfluent cultures were produced by inoculating 250,000 cells/cm2 and allowing growth for 10 days with medium exchanges on days 4, 7, 8, and 9. The purification of mouse 3-OST froml-33+ has been previously described (26Liu J. Shworak N.W. Fritze L.M.S. Edelberg J.M. Rosenberg R.D. J. Biol.

After application of the sample, the reverse phase matrix was washed with 60% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and bound species were eluted with 78.4% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Samples of 1.5 or 3 μg, from two independent purifications, were digested with 0.15 or 0.3 μg, respectively, of endopeptidase Lys-C (Waco) in a reaction volume of 100 μl containing 1% RTX100 (Calbiochem), 10% acetonitrile, and 100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, at 37 °C for ∼16 h (43Fernandez J. DeMott M. Atherton D. Mische S.M. Anal. Biochem. 1992; 201: 255-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Digestion products were chromatographed on a HP 1090 M system (Hewlett Packard) equipped with the above described C4 reverse phase HPLC column equilibrated in 98% buffer A (0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)), 2% buffer B (80% acetonitrile (v/v), 0.85% trifluoroacetic acid (v/v)). After application of digestion products, the reverse phase matrix was washed with 98% buffer A, 2% buffer B, and bound species were eluted with linear gradients of buffer B increasing to 37.5% over 60 min, to 75% over 30 min, and to 98% over 15 min (44Stone K.L. Elliott J.I. Peterson G. McMurray W. Williams K.R. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 193: 389-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The eluate was monitored for absorbance at 210 and 280 nm, and peptide peaks were individually collected and analyzed with a model 477A/120A Protein Sequenator (Applied Biosystems). In addition, the NH2-terminal sequence of 1 μg of concentrated 3-OST sample was directly determined. Cytoplasmic RNA (17.5 mg) was isolated from postconfluent cultures of LTA cells (12 flasks of 175 cm2, ∼1.6 × 109 cells) by a modification of the procedure of Favaloroet al. (45Favaloro J. Treisman R. Kamen R. Methods Enzymol. 1980; 65: 718-749Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar). Monolayers were twice washed with PBS, cells were recovered by trypsinization and centrifugation (1000 ×g for 2 min), and cell pellets were washed by resuspension in PBS followed by centrifugation (1300 × g for 4 min). Cells were lysed by vortexing for 30 s in 12 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 140 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm vanadium ribonucleoside complexes (Life Technologies); samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then vortexed for 1 min. Nuclei were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 × g for 10 min, the supernatant was mixed with an equal volume of 200 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 300 mm NaCl, 2% SDS, 25 mm EDTA, containing 200 μg/ml proteinase K (Boehringer Mannheim), and the mixture was incubated at 65 °C for 2 h. Samples were extracted twice against an equal volume of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), the aqueous phase was combined with 0.7 volumes of isopropyl alcohol, cytoplasmic RNA was pelleted by centrifugation at 3500 ×g for 10 min, and RNA was resuspended in 3.6 ml of 10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA. Poly(A)+ RNA (59 μg) was isolated from 16 mg of cytoplasmic RNA by two sequential purifications against 100 mg of oligo(dT)-cellulose (Life Technologies, catalog number 15939–010) according to the manufacturer's specifications except that binding and wash buffers contained 0.1% SDS, and LiCl was substituted for NaCl. The final eluate (1.5 ml) was extracted against 1.5 ml of phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1), the aqueous phase was then adjusted to 100 mm LiCl and 260 mm NaCl, an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol was added, the mixture was centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the poly(A)+ RNA pellet was recovered in 40 μl of diethyl pyrocarbonate-treated water. Degenerate PCR primers (Fig. 1) were obtained from Biosynthesis. First strand cDNA was generated in a 50-μl volume from 5 μg of LTA poly(A)+ RNA primed with oligo(dT) using a reverse transcriptase-PCR kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's specifications.

Two distinct sets of touchdown PCR conditions were required to obtain optimal yields of product. For amplification with primers 1S and 2A, reactions were heated to 95 °C for 9 min, subjected to 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 68 °C for 1 min with a 0.5 °C reduction per cycle, followed by 20 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s and 58 °C for 30 s with a 0.5 °C reduction per cycle and 75 °C for 30 s, and then 15 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 10 s, and ramping to 75 °C over 50 s. Alternatively, for amplification with primers 1S and 3A or primers 2S and 3A, reactions were heated to 95 °C for 4 min, subjected to 47 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 69.5 °C for 2 min with 0.2 °C and 1 s reductions per cycle, followed by 25 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 15 s, and ramping to 75 °C over 1 min. Amplification products were purified as the retentate from centrifugal ultrafiltration against a 30,000 molecular weight cut-off membrane (Millipore, catalog number SK1P343JO), and then 200 ng of DNA was end-polished with Pfu DNA polymerase and subcloned into pCR-Script Amp SK(+) (Stratagene, catalog number 211188) according to the manufacturer's specifications. A resulting plasmid, pNWS182, contained the 1S/3A amplification product of 779 bp, which was released by digestion with EcoRI and SacII and isolated by low melting point agarose gel electrophoresis. A32P-labeled primer extension probe was then generated with a random primer labeling kit (Stratagene, catalog number 300385) by replacing the random primers with 5 μm of primer 3A. Using the manufacturer's recommended conditions an oligo(dT)-primed λ Zap Express cDNA library (Stratagene, catalog number 200451) was generated from 5 μg of LTA poly(A)+RNA that had been pretreated with methylmercury hydroxide. About 1.5 × 106 primary recombinants were plaque-amplified by infection into Escherichia coli XL1-Blue MRF′. From the amplified library, 1.3 × 106 plaques were transferred to a Colony/Plaque Screen (NEN Life Science Products) and screened with the above described 32P-labeled probe specific for 3-OST. Hybridizations were performed at 42 °C in 1.7 × SSC, 8.3% dextran sulfate, 42% formamide, 0.8% SDS, and filters were washed twice with 2 × SSC, 1% SDS for 30 min at 65 °C. Positive clones were plaque-purified and then in vivo excised into pBK-CMV-based phagemids by infection with ExAssist helper phage followed by transduction of filamentous phage particles into E. coli XLOLR.

In mammalian cells, p38 MAPK is activated by endotoxins, inflammatory cytokines, and environmental stresses. We show here that p38 MAPK is also activated upon stimulation of G protein-coupled receptors (Gq/G11-coupled m1 and Gi-coupled m2 muscarinic acetylcholine and Gs-coupled β-adrenergic receptors) in human embryonal kidney 293 cells. The activation of p38 MAPK through the m2 and β-adrenergic receptors was completely inhibited by coexpression of Gαo, whereas the activation by the m1 receptor was only partially inhibited. Furthermore, we show that overexpression of Gβγ or a constitutively activated mutant of Gα11, but not Gαs and Gαi, can stimulate p38 MAPK. These results suggest that the signal from the m2 and β-adrenergic receptors to p38 MAPK is mediated by Gβγ, whereas the signal from the m1 receptor is mediated by both Gβγ and Gαq/11.

On the other hand, much less is known about the activation of p38 MAPK by G protein-coupled receptors.In this study, we demonstrate that p38 MAPK is activated by the stimulation of m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine and β-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, we examine the involvement of G protein α, β, and γ subunits in p38 MAPK activation.DISCUSSIONp38 MAPK was identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa in lipopolysaccharide-treated cells (45Han J.

A variety of extracellular stimuli, such as endotoxins, inflammatory cytokines, and stresses, activate p38 MAPK in mammalian cells (10Raingeaud J. Gupta S. Rogers J.S. Dickens M. Han J. Ulevitch R.J.

Saklatvala et al. (49Saklatvala J. Rawlinson L. Waller R.J. Sarsfield S. Lee J.C. Morton L.F. Barnes M.J. Farndale R.W. J. Biol.

More recently, Krump et al. (50Krump E. Sanghera J.S. Pelech S.L. Furuya W. Grinstein S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 937-944Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar) also reported that the chemotactic peptide (formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine) induces p38 MAPK activation, leading to the activation of MAPK-activated protein kinase-2 in human neutrophils. Although thrombin, thromboxane, and formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine receptors are known to be members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, it remains to be shown whether each G protein subunit mediates the signals from the receptors to p38 MAPK.In this study, we showed that p38 MAPK is activated by the stimulation of m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine and β-adrenergic receptors in HEK 293 cells. The activation of p38 MAPK by the β-adrenergic and m2 receptors was completely inhibited by coexpression of Gαo, whereas the activation by the m1 receptor was partially inhibited (Fig. 3). Expression of a constitutively activated mutant of Gα11, but not Gαs and Gαi2, activated p38 MAPK, and overexpression of Gβ1γ2 also induced activation (Fig. 4). It seems likely that the p38 MAPK activation by the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is mediated by both Gβγ and Gαq/11, whereas the activation by the β-adrenergic and m2 receptors is mainly mediated by Gβγ, but not by Gαs and Gαi.Recently, some upstream protein kinases involved in the activation of p38 MAPK were identified in mammalian cells. It has been shown that MKK3 and MKK6 are specific activators of p38 MAPK in the signaling pathway caused by endotoxins, inflammatory cytokines, and stresses (51Raingeaud J. Whitmarsh A.J. Barrett T.

It remains to be clarified whether these molecules participate in G protein-mediated p38 MAPK activation.The physiological role of p38 MAPK activation by G protein-coupled receptors also remains to be clarified. It has been suggested that the p38 MAPK pathway may be involved in the inhibition of cell growth and the promotion of cell death (6Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. J. Biol.

Further studies on the molecular mechanism of p38 MAPK activation induced by two distinct G protein components, Gβγ and Gαq/11, may provide new insight into the functions of p38 MAPK. We are currently investigating the molecular connections that lead to p38 MAPK activation. A variety of extracellular stimuli cause the sequential protein phosphorylation leading to the activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; MAPK/ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK/SAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase; G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; Gα, G protein α subunit; Gβγ, G protein βγ subunit; HEK, human embryonal kidney; GST, glutathione S-transferase; [3H]QNB, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. 1The abbreviations used are: MAPKs, mitogen-activated protein kinases; MAPK/ERK, mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase; JNK/SAPK, c-Jun N-terminal kinase/stress-activated protein kinase; G protein, heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein; Gα, G protein α subunit; Gβγ, G protein βγ subunit; HEK, human embryonal kidney; GST, glutathione S-transferase; [3H]QNB, [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate. which are divided into three major classes: MAPK/ERK, JNK/SAPK, and p38 MAPK (1Davis R.J.

Heterotrimeric guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory proteins (G proteins) are composed of α, β, and γ subunits and mediate a variety of extracellular signals from seven transmembrane receptors to effector molecules (16Gilman A.G.

Several G protein-coupled receptors are known to stimulate the MAPK/ERK pathway through different G protein subunits. In the case of Gq/G11-coupled m1 muscarinic acetylcholine and α1-adrenergic receptors, the activation of MAPK/ERK is mediated primarily by α subunits (21Koch W.J. Hawes B.E. Allen L.F. Lefkowitz R.J.

In this study, we demonstrate that p38 MAPK is activated by the stimulation of m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine and β-adrenergic receptors. Furthermore, we examine the involvement of G protein α, β, and γ subunits in p38 MAPK activation. DISCUSSIONp38 MAPK was identified as a tyrosine-phosphorylated protein with an apparent molecular mass of 38 kDa in lipopolysaccharide-treated cells (45Han J. Lee J.-D. Tobias P.S. Ulevitch R.J. J.

Although thrombin, thromboxane, and formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine receptors are known to be members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, it remains to be shown whether each G protein subunit mediates the signals from the receptors to p38 MAPK.In this study, we showed that p38 MAPK is activated by the stimulation of m1 and m2 muscarinic acetylcholine and β-adrenergic receptors in HEK 293 cells. The activation of p38 MAPK by the β-adrenergic and m2 receptors was completely inhibited by coexpression of Gαo, whereas the activation by the m1 receptor was partially inhibited (Fig. 3). Expression of a constitutively activated mutant of Gα11, but not Gαs and Gαi2, activated p38 MAPK, and overexpression of Gβ1γ2 also induced activation (Fig. 4). It seems likely that the p38 MAPK activation by the m1 muscarinic acetylcholine receptor is mediated by both Gβγ and Gαq/11, whereas the activation by the β-adrenergic and m2 receptors is mainly mediated by Gβγ, but not by Gαs and Gαi.Recently, some upstream protein kinases involved in the activation of p38 MAPK were identified in mammalian cells.

https://openalex.org/W1978810830,"Activation of the serine/threonine kinase Akt, also called protein kinase B (PKB), was investigated in human neutrophils. Stimulation of the cells with the chemoattractant fMet-Leu-Phe or the chemokines IL-8 and GROα leads to the rapid and transient activation of PKB. Maximum PKB activation correlates with the well documented kinetics of respiratory burst and exocytosis. Wortmannin, a selective inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI 3-kinases) in neutrophils, abrogates PKB activation. Similarly homo and heterotypic cross-linking of FcγIIA and FcγIIIB causes a transient activation of PKB that is sensitive to wortmannin treatment. Kinase activity measurements in immunoprecipitates from lysates of the myelocytic GM-1 cells or GM-1/CXCR1 cells, which are transfected with the IL-8 receptor 1, confirmed the transient activation of PKB observed in neutrophils. Stimulation of human monocytes with the CC chemokine RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) also results in the activation of PKB. Preincubation of monocytes and neutrophils with Bordetella pertussis toxin inhibits fMet-Leu-Phe and RANTES-stimulated PKB activation, demonstrating that coupling of the receptors to heterotrimeric Gi-protein is required. The data show, that activation of PKB by Gi-protein-coupled receptors is mediated by PI 3-kinase and suggest that PKB is a constituent of neutrophil activating pathways.

Rev. 1993; 73: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar). Stimulation of the receptors in neutrophils triggers chemotaxis, exocytosis, and the respiratory burst (1Thelen M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). The signal transduction induced by the receptors leads to the rapid activation of phospholipase Cβ2 by the βγ subunits of the Gi-proteins (3Camps M. Carozzi A. Schnabel P. Scheer A. Parker P.J. Gierschik P. Nature. 1992; 360: 684-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 4Katz A. Wu D. Simon M.I. Nature. 1992; 360: 686-689Crossref PubMed Scopus (419) Google Scholar) and to the subsequent elevation of cytosolic free calcium and protein kinase C activation (1Thelen M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Physiol. Rev. 1993; 73: 797-821Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Parallel to the activation of phospholipase C, a calcium-independent pathway leads to the activation of phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) 1The abbreviations used are: PI 3-kinase, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; PKB, protein kinase B; RANTES, regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted; HIV, human immunodeficiency virus; GαM, goat anti-mouse; mAb, monoclonal antibody; IFN, interferon; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.

Chem. 1988; 263: 16179-16184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Neutrophils can also be activated in vitro by cross-linking Fcγ-receptors. The resting cells express the FcγRIIA, a transmembrane protein with a cytoplasmic domain of 76 amino acids, and the FcγIIIB, which is membrane-anchored by glycosyl phosphatidylinositol moiety and does not possess a cytoplasmic tail (7Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1991; 9: 457-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). Cross-linking of the cell-surface receptor in vitro has been used to study distinct Fcγ-receptor-stimulated pathways (8Vossebeld P.J.M. Kessler J. Von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Roos D. Verhoefen A.J. J.

Immunol. 1996; 8: 36-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). Fcγ-receptor signaling is not dependent on Gi-proteins and leads to activation of phospholipase Cγ1 by a tyrosine kinase-dependent mechanism (10Santana C. Noris G. Espinoza B. Ortega E. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1996; 60: 433-440Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar) and, in the case of FcγRIIA, to the activation of PI 3-kinase (11Ninomiya N. Hazeki K. Fukui Y. Seya T. Okada T. Hazeki O. Ui M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22732-22737Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The fungal metabolite wortmannin is a selective and potent inhibitor of PI 3-kinase (6Thelen M. Wymann M.P. Langen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4960-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar, 12Ui M. Okada T. Hazeki K. Hazeki O. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 303-307Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). Treatment of phagocytes with wortmannin revealed that PI 3-kinase activity is required for the stimulation of the respiratory burst, exocytosis, and phagocytosis (5Dewald B. Thelen M. Baggiolini M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16179-16184Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Thelen M. Wymann M.P. Langen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

However, chemotaxis and shape change of neutrophils stimulated by agonists of G-protein-coupled receptors are insensitive to wortmannin, indicating that PI 3-kinase is not involved (14Thelen M. Uguccioni M. Bösiger J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1995; 217: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar, 15Baggiolini M. Kernen P. News Physiol. Sci. 1992; 7: 215-219Google Scholar). Several isoforms of PI 3-kinase have been characterized in neutrophils, mainly the classical PI 3-kinaseα (p85/p110) (6Thelen M. Wymann M.P. Langen H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4960-4964Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), and the more recently described PI 3-kinaseγ, which is activated by the βγ subunits of G-proteins (16Stephens L. Smrcka A.

Little information is available on potential downstream effectors of PI 3-kinase in neutrophils. So far the p21 activated kinase PAK (18Knaus U.G. Morris S. Dong H.-J. Chernoff J. Bokoch G.M.

The serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB, also called Akt or RAC-PK), first identified as an oncogene, was subsequently shown to be a major target of PI 3-kinase-dependent signaling in growth factor stimulation (21Coffer P.J.

Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) and in stably transfected myelocytic GM-1 cells (20Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Furthermore, regulation of neuronal survival and suppression of c-Myc-induced apoptosis implicate that PKB is involved in the transduction of survival signals (29Dudek H. Datta S.R. Franke T.F.

Gilbert C. Coffer P. Downward J. Evan G. Nature. 1997; 385: 544-548Crossref PubMed Scopus (1073) Google Scholar). However, the mitogen lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) which binds to G-protein-coupled receptors was reported to have no effect on the activation of PKB in fibroblasts (25Burgering B.M.T. Coffer P.J. Nature. 1995; 376: 599-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1880) Google Scholar). Recent data, by contrast, suggest that PKB becomes transiently activated upon stimulation of Gi-protein-coupled receptors in platelets (31Franke T.F. Kaplan D.R. Cantley L.C. Toker A. Science. 1997; 275: 665-668Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar) and by Gs-protein-coupled receptors in adipocytes (32Moule S.K. Welsh G.I. Edgell N.J. Foulstone E.J. Proud C.G. Denton R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7713-7719Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar). Chemokine receptors were recently shown to function as co-receptors during HIV-infection of CD4+ cells (33Moser B. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 88-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A homozygous defect in the CCR5 gene, that encodes for the receptor of the CC chemokines RANTES, MIP1α, and MIP1β, was shown to provide resistance to HIV infection of multiply exposed individuals (33Moser B. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 88-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). It was further reported that RANTES and RANTES antagonists prevent infection of lymphocytes with macrophage tropic HIV isolates (33Moser B. Trends Microbiol. 1997; 5: 88-90Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), indicating that binding of the HIV envelope protein gp120 the co-receptor is essential for virus uptake. However, the contribution of signal transduction stimulated by gp120 binding to CD4 and the Gi-protein coupled co-receptors for HIV infection is still controversial (34Horak I.D. Popovic M. Horak E.M. Lucas P.J. Gress R.E. June C.H. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1990; 348: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar, 35Popik W. Pitha P.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 6532-6541Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We show here for the first time that in phagocytes activation of PKB can be stimulated by a variety of Gi-protein-coupled receptor-agonists and by cross-linking of Fcγ-receptors. The transient PKB activation observed in neutrophils correlates with other typical responses of the cells, such as the respiratory burst and exocytosis. The findings implicate that PKB is part of the signal cascade involved in neutrophil activation. RPMI 1640 media, Hank's balanced salt solution, antibiotics, and additional cell culture supplements were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. Protein A-Sepharose CL-4B was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Immobilon-P (PVDF) was from Millipore Corp., histone 2B was from Fluka, [γ-32P]ATP was from Amersham Life Science, Inc. and B. pertussis toxin was from List Biochemicals. Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was obtained from Bio-Rad, and the goat anti-mouse (GαM) IgG F(ab′)2 fragments were from Dianova. All other reagents were of molecular biology grade. The anti-RAC469–480antibodies were prepared as described previously (23Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). The monoclonal antibodies against Fcγ receptors IIA (mAb IV.3) and IIIB (mAb SD2) were kindly provided by Dr. A. J. Verhoeven. Chemokines IL-8, GROα, and RANTES were chemically synthesized by Dr. I. Clark-Lewis (Vancouver, Canada). The CXCR1 (IL-8R1) gene was kindly supplied by Dr. B. Moser, and 17-hydroxywortmannin was a gift from Dr. T. Payne. The CXCR1 gene was inserted into pPUR (pPUR/CXCR1) under the control of the CMV-1 promotor. GM-1 cells (36Garotta G. Thelen M. Delia D. Kamber M. Baggiolini M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar) were transfected with the pPUR/CXCR1 as described (20Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Resistant clones (GM-1/CXCR1) were selected in RPMI 1640 media supplemented with 10% FCS and 0.2 μg/ml puromycin. Parental GM-1 cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FCS and, where indicated, differentiated with IFNγ as described previously (36Garotta G. Thelen M. Delia D. Kamber M. Baggiolini M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Neutrophils were isolated from freshly drawn blood of healthy volunteers (37Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) or from buffy coats of citrated donor blood stored up to 20 h at 4–10 °C provided from the Swiss Red Cross (Bern, Switzerland) (38Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 132: 267-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Monocytes were prepared from buffy coats as described (39Uguccioni M. D'Apuzzo M. Loetscher M. Dewald B. Baggiolini M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1995; 25: 64-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Pretreatment of neutrophils and monocytes with B. pertussis toxin was as described previously (40Thelen M. Peveri P. Kernen P. von Tscharner V. Walz A. Baggiolini M. FASEB J. 1988; 2: 2702-2706Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). Briefly, neutrophils or monocytes (1.35 × 107/ml) were incubated for 90 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 1 μg/ml B. pertussis toxin in a balanced salt solution (110 mm NaCl, 10 mm KCl, 1 mmMgCl2, 10 mm glucose, 30 mm HEPES, and 0.1% w/v bovine serum albumin). The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and resuspended in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (6 × 106 cells/ml for neutrophils or monocytes). Aliquots (500 μl) were incubated for 10–15 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 nm wortmannin prior to stimulation with the indicated stimuli. The reactions were stopped by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 10%. Precipitated protein was recovered by centrifugation, washed twice in cold acetone, air dried, and resuspended in sample buffer for SDS-PAGE (37Thelen M. Rosen A. Nairn A.C. Aderem A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5603-5607Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Hetero or homotypic cross-linking (41Vossebeld P.J.M. Kessler J. von dem Borne A.E.G.K. Roos D. Verhoeven A.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10671-10679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) was performed as follows. Neutrophils or serum-starved GM-1 cells (107/ml) were incubated for 25 min on ice with 10 μg/ml monoclonal antibodies for the Fcγ-receptors IIA (mAb IV.3) and/or IIIB (mAb SD2). Excess antibodies were removed by centrifugation, and the cells were resuspended in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (1.2 × 107 cells/ml for immunoprecipitations or 6 × 106 cells/ml for total protein precipitations). Aliquots (500 or 250 μl) were incubated for 10–15 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 nm wortmannin prior to stimulation with cross-linking GαM IgG F(ab′)2 fragments. The reactions were terminated either with trichloroacetic acid, as above, or ice-cold lysis buffer (described below). GM-1/CXCR1 and IFNγ differentiated GM-1 cells were serum-starved overnight or for 3 h at 37 °C in RPMI 1640. The cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and resuspended in Hank's balanced salt solution containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4 (1.2 × 107 cells/ml). Aliquots (500 μl) were incubated for 10–15 min at 37 °C in the absence or presence of 100 nm wortmannin prior to stimulation with the indicated stimuli or as described above for Fcγ-receptor cross-linking. The reactions were stopped by the addition of concentrated lysis buffer giving final concentrations of 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1% Nonidet P-40, 120 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.1 mm sodium vanadate, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 2 μmmicrocystin-LR and were subsequently frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples were unthawn on ice, centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 ×g at 4 °C and precleared with protein A-Sepharose. Endogenous PKB was immunoprecipitated (5 × 106 cells) for 2 h at 4 °C with an affinity-purified rabbit antibody specific for the conserved carboxyl terminus (anti-RAC469–480 (23Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar)) coupled to protein A-Sepharose. Immunoprecipitates were washed twice with lysis buffer and once with kinase buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mm benzamidine). In vitro kinase assays were performed as described previously (20Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), with the exception that histone 2B was used as a substrate. The incorporation of 32P into histone 2B was determined from 13.5% SDS-PAGE using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The PKB content of the immunoprecipitates were measured on Western blots (see below). Immunoprecipitated or total protein samples were resolved by 8.0% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and incubated with the anti-RAC469–480 antibody. Detection was performed using alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. The determination of PKB activity by substrate phosphorylation from chemoattractant-stimulated neutrophils gave inconsistent results. The high proteolytic and phosphatase activities found in detergent lysates of neutrophils cause the rapid degradation and dephosphorylation of PKB, even in the presence of high concentrations of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. However, activation of PKB was demonstrated to coincide with the phosphorylation on Ser473 and Thr308, resulting in an altered electrophoretic mobility (42Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar, 43Alessi D.R. Andjelkovic M. Caudwell B. Cron P. Morrice N. Cohen P. Hemmings B.A. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 6541-6551Crossref PubMed Scopus (2517) Google Scholar) which is detected on Western blots using an antibody directed against the carboxyl terminus of the kinase (23Jones P.F. Jakubowicz T. Pitossi F.J. Maurer F. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 4171-4175Crossref PubMed Scopus (443) Google Scholar). Fig.1 shows the transient activation of PKB in human neutrophils stimulated by fMet-Leu-Phe, IL-8, and GROα. Phosphorylated PKB with reduced elctrophoretic mobility is detectable as early as 10 s after stimulation of the neutrophils and shows a maximum of activation at ∼40–80 s. Stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe leads to a marked phosphorylation of PKB that is still apparent after 5 min. IL-8, which binds with high affinity to both IL-8 receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2, elicits a more transient activation of PKB. Stimulation with GROα, which binds only to CXCR2 with high affinity (2Baggiolini M. Dewald B. Moser B. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 97-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (2263) Google Scholar), causes an even less pronounced response. Pretreatment of neutrophils with wortmannin abolishes the phosphorylation of PKB in all cases, confirming previous observations that PKB is a downstream effector of PI 3-kinase (20Didichenko S.A. Tilton B. Hemmings B.A. Ballmer-Hofer K. Thelen M. Curr. Biol. 1996; 6: 1271-1278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 28Klippel A. Reinhard C. Kavanaugh W.M. Apell G. Escobedo M.A. Williams L.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4117-4127Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). To measure PKB activity we used promyeolocytic GM-1 cells that can be differentiated with IFNγ to respond to stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe (36Garotta G. Thelen M. Delia D. Kamber M. Baggiolini M. J. Leukocyte Biol. 1991; 49: 294-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Endogenous PKB was immunoprecipitated with affinity purified antibodies from detergent lysates of GM-1 cells and subjected to Western blot analysis. Like in neutrophils, stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe results in the wortmannin-sensitive transient phosphorylation of PKB (Fig. 2,left). The electrophoretic mobility shift of endogenous PKB in serum-starved GM-1 cells can be detected as early as 10 s, shows a maximum at ∼40–80 s, and is still apparent 5 min after stimulation. We assessed protein kinase activity from the same anti-PKB immunoprecipitates from lysates of IFNγ-differentiated cells using histone 2B as substrate. Exposure of serum-starved GM-1 cells to fMet-Leu-Phe stimulates ∼3-fold the activity of endogenous PKB. The increase in PKB activity shows a maximum at 40–80 s and is still measurable after 5 min. Incubation of the anti-PKB immunoprecipitates with wortmannin did not inhibit the activity of the kinase, confirming that PKB is not a target. However, pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin blocks agonist-dependent PKB activity, indicating that PI 3-kinase is an upstream regulator. In agreement with previous results (42Andjelkovic M. Jakubowicz T. Cron P. Ming X.-F. Han J.-W. Hemmings B.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5699-5704Crossref PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar), incubation of the immunoprecipitates with protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) abolished PKB activity and the electrophoretic mobility shift (data not shown). Differentiation induced with IFNγ may alter signaling pathways which could regulate PKB activation. To exclude this possibility, we introduced the IL-8 receptor CXCR1 into GM-1 cells and cloned stable transfectants. GM-1 cells expressing CXCR1 (GM-1/CXCR1) showed a typical rise in cytosolic free calcium upon stimulation with IL-8 (data not shown). The cells were then used for testing IL-8-dependent activation of PKB. Lysates of control and IL-8-stimulated cells were treated with anti-PKB antibodies, and the immunoprecipitates were resolved on SDS-PAGE. Like in neutrophils, stimulation of serum-starved GM-1/CXCR1 cells results in the transient phosphorylation of PKB (Fig. 2, right). The effect is fully prevented by pretreatment of the cells with 100 nmwortmannin. Measurements of kinase activity associated with the immunoprecipitates from GM-1/CXCR1 cells confirm the transient IL-8-stimulated activation of PKB. The kinase activity shows a maximum at 40 s after stimulation. As in the case of neutrophils, stimulation with IL-8 results in a less pronounced and more transient activation of PKB than stimulation with fMet-Leu-Phe. Measurements of PKB activity stimulated by different concentrations of IL-8 displays a bell-shaped dose-response curve (Fig. 3). Maximum stimulation, about 3-fold, is obtained with 100 nmIL-8. At higher IL-8 concentrations, a slightly weaker activation of PKB is observed (Fig. 3). This effect could be mediated by an increase of phosphatase activities, which are more potently stimulated at high agonist concentrations. However, stimulation of kinase activity can be detected in anti-PKB immunoprecipitates from cells exposed to concentrations as low as 1 nm IL-8, suggesting a close coupling of PKB activation to the chemokine receptor. Cross-linking of Fcγ-receptors has been reported to induce the activation of PI 3-kinase (44Lin C.-T. Shen Z. Boros P. Unkeless J.C. J. Clin. Immunol. 1994; 14: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). We have therefore tested if homo or heterotypic cross-linking of Fcγ-receptors IIA and/or IIIB (41Vossebeld P.J.M.

Fig.4 shows the effect of goat anti-mouse F(ab′)2-stimulated cross-linking of Fcγ-receptors in neutrophils that were preincubated with receptor-specific monoclonal antibodies, mAb IV.3 (anti-FcγRIIA) and/or mAb SD2 (anti-FcγRIIIB). The phosphorylation-induced electrophoretic mobility shift of PKB was absent if the cells were pretreated with 100 nm wortmannin or if the cells were incubated only with receptor-specific antibodies or cross-linking F(ab′)2. In contrast, following cross-linking, FcγRII induces the transient activation of PKB which shows a maximum at ∼90–120 s and was nearly absent after 5 min. Similarly, heterotypic cross-linking of both receptors causes the transient phosphorylation of PKB. Because of the rapid degradation of PKB in neutrophil lysates, we used GM-1 cells to assess Fcγ-receptor-stimulated kinase activity in anti-PKB immunoprecipitates. Cross-linking of FcγRII results in 2.5–3-fold stimulation of PKB activity (Fig.5). Pretreatment of the cells with wortmannin inhibits FcγRII-stimulated PKB activity. Incubation of GM-1 cells with mAb IV.3 or cross-linking F(ab′)2 alone does not stimulate PKB activity. Like U937 cells, the GM-1 express very low levels of FcγRIII (36Garotta G. Thelen M. Delia D.

Chemoattractants, such as fMet-Leu-Phe or IL-8, bind to heptahelical receptors that are coupled to the Gi class of heterotrimeric G-proteins (40Thelen M. Peveri P. Kernen P. von Tscharner V. Walz A.

Uncoupling of the Gi-proteins from the receptors is a result of ADP-ribosylation by B. pertussis toxin. We have tested the effect of pertussis toxin treatment on the activation of PKB in phagocytes. Fig. 6 shows that preincubations of neutrophils with the toxin blocks fMet-Leu-Phe-stimulated activation of PKB. Western blot analysis of total cellular proteins from human peripheral blood monocytes reveals the expression of PKB (Fig."

Octadecanoids are plant signaling molecules derived from α-linolenic acid and comprise 18-carbon members as well as metabolites derived from these via β-oxidation, notably the 12-carbon compound jasmonic acid. Within the C18-group, 12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) 1The abbreviations used are: OPDA, 12-oxophytodienoic acid; OPC-8:0, 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid; OYE, Old Yellow Enzyme; HBA, N-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)aminohexyl; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NTA, nitrilotriacetate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. 1The abbreviations used are: OPDA, 12-oxophytodienoic acid; OPC-8:0, 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic acid; OYE, Old Yellow Enzyme; HBA, N-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)aminohexyl; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; CAPS, 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid; IPTG, isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside; NTA, nitrilotriacetate; GC, gas chromatography; MS, mass spectrometry. is the first cyclic metabolite in the biosynthetic pathway. OPDA originates from cyclization of 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid by allene oxide synthase and allene oxide cyclase, the hydroperoxy precursor being derived from α-linolenic acid in a reaction catalyzed by lipoxygenase (1Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 458-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). OPDA is then reduced to 3-oxo-2-(2′-pentenyl)-cyclopentane-1-octanoic (OPC-8:0) by OPDA reductase (Fig. 1), and OPC-8:0 is further converted, through three cycles of β-oxidation, to jasmonic acid (1Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 458-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Octadecanoids have multiple physiological functions in plants (2Sembdner G. Parthier B. Annu. Rev. Plant Physiol. Plant Mol. Biol. 1993; 44: 569-589Crossref Scopus (677) Google Scholar). They are signal transducers in herbivore defense (3Farmer E.E. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A. 1992; 89: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), mechanotransduction (6Falkenstein E. Groth B. Mithöfer A. Weiler E.W. Planta. 1991; 185: 316-322Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 7Weiler E.W. Kutchan T.M. Gorba T. Brodschelm W. Niesel U. Bublitz F. FEBS Lett. 1994; 345: 9-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar), they promote senescence (8Ueda J. Kato J. Plant Physiol. 1980; 66: 246-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and induce leaf defense volatile emission (9Boland W. Hopke J. Donath J. Nüske J. Bublitz F. Angew. Chem. 1995; 107: 1715-1717Crossref Google Scholar, 10Bruin J. Dicke M. Sabelis M.W. Experientia. 1992; 48: 525-529Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Only recently, evidence has emerged that different octadecanoids may have distinct and different profiles of biological activities. For example, OPDA is the strongest inducer of tendril coiling in Bryonia dioica, a process of mechanotransduction (11Weiler E.W. Albrecht T. Groth B. Xia Z.-Q. Luxem M. Liss H. Andert L. Spengler P. Phytochemistry. 1993; 32: 591-600Crossref Scopus (175) Google Scholar), while mainly jasmonic acid is held responsible for inducing herbivore and pathogen defenses (3Farmer E.E. Ryan C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 7713-7716Crossref PubMed Scopus (1106) Google Scholar, 5Gundlach H. Müller M.J. Kutchan T.M. Zenk M.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 2389-2393Crossref PubMed Scopus (992) Google Scholar), whereas conjugates of jasmonic acid with amino acids seem to be inducers of plant volatile emission (12Krumm T. Bandemer K. Boland W. FEBS Lett. 1995; 377: 523-529Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). The molecular analysis of these processes has only begun. Little is known about the mechanisms regulating octadecanoid production and translocation within a tissue. The biosynthetic pathway from α-linolenic and to jasmonic acid (1Vick B.A. Zimmerman D.C. Plant Physiol. 1984; 75: 458-461Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in all probability involves three compartments. OPDA is synthesized in plastids (13Blee E. Joyard J. Plant Physiol. 1996; 110: 445-454Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 14Laudert D. Pfannschmidt U. Lottspeich F. Holländer-Czytko H. Weiler E.W. Plant Mol.

A. 1995; 92: 8675-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar). In support of this, suppression of expression of the only plastidic lipoxygenase isoform occurring in Arabidopsis thaliana by antisense technology suppressed jasmonate accumulation (15Bell E. Creelman R.A. Mullet J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8675-8679Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), and allene oxide synthase genes cloned from flax (16Song W.-C. Funk C.D. Brash A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8519-8523Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar) and A. thaliana(14Laudert D. Pfannschmidt U. Lottspeich F. Holländer-Czytko H. Weiler E.W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1996; 31: 323-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar) encode precursor polypeptides with transit peptides characteristic for plastid targeting sequences. On the other hand, β-oxidation in plants occurs exclusively in microbodies (peroxisomes and glyoxisomes). Thus, this should be the compartment where OPC-8:0 is being converted to jasmonic acid. OPDA reductase plays a central role in octadecanoid biosynthesis in that the enzyme controls metabolite flow from the C18 group to the C12 group of cyclic α-linolenic acid derivatives. The enzyme is soluble and not associated with either plastids or microbodies and is thus probably cytosolic (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This location reinforces the notion that OPDA reductase is a critical checkpoint in octadecanoid biosynthesis. To understand the molecular aspects of cellular control over OPDA reductase and of pathway control by OPDA reductase, we have recently isolated the enzyme in pure form (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (EC 1.3.1.42) to make it accessible to reverse genetics. Here, we report the molecular cloning of OPDA reductase from A. thaliana and its functional expression in a bacterial host. Sequence analysis has revealed a surprising similarity of OPDA reductase to Warburg's Old Yellow Enzyme (OYE) (18Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1933; 266: 377-411Google Scholar, 19Saito K. Thiele D.J. Davio M. Lockridge O. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20720-20724Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (EC 1.6.99.1). This prompted a more detailed comparison of the two enzymes. We report that yeast OYE also has OPDA reductase activity. It is thus probable that the, as yet unknown, biological function of OYE may involve reduction of α,β-double bonds in cyclic oxo-fatty acids. OPDA reductase was purified in enzymatically active form from cell suspension cultures of Corydalis sempervirens as described previously (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The protein (25 mg) was finally precipitated with methanol at −20 °C and subjected to SDS-PAGE (20Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (206602) Google Scholar) on a preparative 12% gel from which the 41-kDa band was electroeluted using a Biotrap BT1000 (Schleicher & Schuell), precipitated with methanol, and redissolved in 1 ml of double distilled water. Peptides were generated by cyanogen bromide cleavage at Met-X bonds according to Smith (21Smith B.J. Walker J.M. New Protein Techniques. Humana Press, Clifton, NJ1988: 71-75Google Scholar) and separated by SDS-PAGE according to Schägger and von Jagow (22Schägger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10457) Google Scholar). They were then electrotransferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (ImmobilonTM, Millipore) at 50 V (20 °C, 30 min) in 10 mm CAPS buffer, pH 11.0, containing 10% (by volume) methanol, and localized with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Exised bands were subjected to gas phase Edman sequencing (performed by Dr. J. Block, Max-Planck-Institut für Molekulare Physiologie, Dortmund). The amino acid sequence information obtained for theC. sempervirens OPDA reductase was used to screen data bases of expressed sequence tags of A. thaliana. A 33-amino acid sequence stretch aligned with high similarity (>78% identical amino acids) to EST clone 179A13T7 of the NCBF EST-clone collection. This clone contained a 1.3-kilobase pair insert which was sequenced on both strands employing the dideoxy chain termination method (23Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52495) Google Scholar) and series of subclones exonuclease III-digested from either the 5′- or the 3′-end of the cDNA (24Henikoff S. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 155: 156-165Crossref Scopus (676) Google Scholar). The region between nucleotides 800 and 950 was additionally sequenced using specific primers corresponding to nucleotides 990–970 and 725–745. Two primers were designed from the 3′- and 5′-ends of EST clone 179A13T7 to allow amplification of the entire coding sequence of the putative OPDA reductase from a cDNA library of A. thaliana, race Columbia, shoots maintained in λZAP (provided by Dr. R. Hell, Bochum). Primer A (5′-GCT CAA GCT TGG ATC CAT G GA AAA CGG AGA AGC-3′) encompassed the translational start ATG and nucleotides 75–88 of the sequence of EST clone 179A13T7 flanked by a BamHI restriction site (underlined), primer B (5′-GAG GGC TGC ACC CGG GGG AAA CAC-3′) encompassed nucleotides 1217–1225 of the EST sequence flanked by aSmaI site (underlined). Using these primers, a cDNA fragment of the predicted size (1.18 kilobase pairs) was obtained. The amplified fragment was cloned into the vector pBS SK(+) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) and sequenced on both strands to provide independent verification of the nucleotide sequence obtained for the EST clone 179A13T7. Furthermore, the polymerase chain reaction-generated full-length A. thaliana cDNA fragment was cloned into the protein expression vector pQE-30 (Qiagen) using theBamHI/SmaI restriction sites and transfected intoEscherichia coli strain XL1-blue (25Bullock W.O. Fernandez J.M. Short J.M. Biotechnique. 1987; 5: 376-378Google Scholar) by electroporation (26Kinosita K. Tsong T.Y. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 471: 227-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar) for protein expression studies. Nucleotide sequences were aligned using AssemlyLIGNTM (Eastman Kodak Co.), amino acid sequences were aligned using DNAsis (Hitachi) and MacVector (Kodak) software. Expression of protein was induced by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to log-phase bacteria up to 2 mm concentration for 5 h. In parallel, control bacteria transfected with pQE-30 containing no insert, were processed. Native, hexahistidine-tagged protein was purified from bacterial lysates on Ni-nitrilotriacetate (Ni-NTA) resin according to the protocol (no. 5) provided by the supplier (Qiagen) and was obtained as a 1 mg/ml solution in 50 mm Na-phosphate, 300 mm NaCl, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 500 mm imidazole, pH 6.0. The eluate was further concentrated using Amicon Centriprep-10 ultrafiltration units and taken up in 0.1 m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4, pH 8.0 (1.2 mg/ml protein). This fraction was used for affinity chromatography. OYE was purified from bakers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 500 g of packed cells) as described elsewhere (27Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The synthesis ofN-(4-hydroxybenzoyl)aminohexyl (HBA)-Sepharose followed the protocol of Abramovitz and Massey (27Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and Stott et al.(28Stott K. Saito K. Thiele D.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6097-6106Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The affinity matrix (10 ml) was equilibrated with 0.1m Tris-HCl, 0.1 m(NH4)2SO4, 10 μmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, pH 8.0, and used at 4 °C. Total soluble yeast protein representing 500 g of cells was applied at a flow rate of 1.5 ml/min. OYE was eluted with the equilibration buffer containing 3 mm sodium dithionite (flow rate, 1.5 ml/min) and concentrated, using an Amicon Centriprep-10 ultrafiltration unit, to a protein concentration of 1.5 mg/ml. Prepurified protein fractions from C. sempervirens cell cultures (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (2 mg) or Ni-NTA affinity purified recombinant protein from cell lysates of E. coli (1–2 mg) (see above) was subjected to affinity chromatography on HBA-Sepharose under the same conditions. The substrate,cis-(±)-OPDA was synthesized enzymatically from 13-hydroperoxylinolenic acid using recombinant A. thalianaallene oxide synthase (29Laudert D. Hennig P. Stelmach B.A. Müller A. Andert L. Weiler E.W. Anal. Biochem. 1997; 246: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The trans-isomer was produced from the cis-isomer by base-catalyzed enolization (30Hamberg M. Hughes M.A. Lipids. 1988; 23: 469-475Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Assays contained, in a total volume of 0.5 ml or 1.0 ml of buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate, pH 7.5) 0.1 mmsubstrate, 1.0 mm NADPH, and protein (10 μg of partially purified, recombinant OPDA reductase or control protein (data in Fig.5 C); 1 μg of affinity-purified OPDA reductase (data in Fig. 5 F); 2 μg of partially purified OYE (data in Fig. 7)) and were incubated for 30–60 min at 25 °C (reaction linear under these conditions for 60 min). Because of potential NADPH-oxidase side reactions, all enzyme activities were based on quantitations of product formed versus substrate consumed made by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry as detailed in Schaller and Weiler (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Product verification was further done by using 17[2H2],18[2H3]OPDA as substrate and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the reaction products (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar).Figure 7Analysis of reaction products obtained from incubations of purified yeast OYE and of recombinant A. thaliana OPDA reductase with pentadeuteratedcis-(±)-OPDA.

Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44841) Google Scholar) to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h in TBS-T buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20) containing 2% skim milk powder. The primary antibody against OPDA reductase fromC. sempervirens (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:10,000 in TBS-T buffer. Membranes were incubated in this solution for 1 h at room temperature and were then washed three times, 10 min each, in TBS-T buffer, followed by incubation with goat anti-rabbit IgG coupled to alkaline phosphatase (Promega) and enzymatic analysis as described previously (32Key G. Weiler E.W. Planta. 1988; 176: 472-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). To obtain partial amino acid sequence information, OPDA reductase (25 mg) was purified from cell suspension cultures of C. sempervirensand obtained as a soluble, yellow preparation containing predominantly a single, 41-kDa, polypeptide (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Treatment with CNBr yielded, on SDS-PAGE using 16.5% separating gels, seven fragments ranging from 4 to 12 kDa in apparent molecular masses. N-terminal Edman gas-phase sequencing of the two predominant peptides yielded single sequences in each case. These were: 9-kDa peptide, RKAFNGTFIAAGGYKKDDGGKAAIENHHD, and 12-kDa peptide, GKFNLSHRVVLAPLTFDRSYDNLPQQHAAAYYY. The latter sequence of 33 amino acids was used to screen protein data bases andA. thaliana EST data bases. The peptide aligned with significant similarity (73% identical plus similar amino acids) to an N-terminal stretch of the known sequence of S. cerevisiaeOYE. One A. thaliana EST clone (179A13T7), partially sequenced from its 5′-end, was found to encode a protein clearly homologous (>78% identical residues in the 33-amino acid sequence stretch) to C. sempervirens OPDA reductase. The complete nucleotide sequence of EST clone 179A13T7 is shown in Fig. 2. The sequence encompasses an open reading frame starting at position 72 and ending at position 1187 that would encode a polypeptide of 41165 Da with a calculated pI of 6.35. Since the apparent molecular mass of purified OPDA reductase was found to be 41 kDa, the sequence is considered complete. This is further suggested by the 3′-noncoding region ending with poly(A) and by the fact that the first ATG and the sequence elements surrounding it are in agreement with the consensus motif for plant translational start sites (33Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1987; 15: 8125-8130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4160) Google Scholar). Also aligned in Fig. 2 are the two partial sequences obtained from amino acid sequencing of the purified OPDA reductase of C. sempervirens, both of which are clearly very similar and preceded by a methionine in the A. thaliana-deduced sequence, in agreement with the CNBr cleavage sites. A comparison of the complete amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA with sequence information already available in data bases (Fig. 3) revealed significant similarities with all yeast OYEs, namely OYE1 from S. carlsbergensis (19Saito K.

J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which is more similar to the putative OPDA reductase than to OYEs and with the Candida albicansestrogen-binding protein (EBP1 in Fig. 3), which is an oxidoreductase (37Madani N.D. Malloy P.J. Rodriguez-Pombo P. Krishnan A.V. Feldman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 922-926Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). More detailed analysis of the sequences strengthens the evidence that the protein encoded by EST clone 179A13T7 belongs to the OYE family of FMN-containing reductases (Fig. 4). From the crystal structure of OYE1 from S. cerevisiae, it has been deduced that the following amino acids (numbering as in Fox and Karplus (38Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar)) contribute to the FMN binding site: Pro35, Thr37, Gly72, Gln114, Arg243, Gly324, Asn325, Phe326, Gly345, Gly347, and Arg348. Eight out of these 11 amino acids are conserved inA. thaliana sequence (corresponding to Pro31, Thr33, Gln106, Arg235, Gly304, Phe306, Gly326, Arg327, numbering as in Fig. 2) and two more are substituted similar amino acids (Gly72 → Ala64 and Gly345 → Ala324). There is only a single nonconservative amino acid change (Asn325→ Gly305) in this domain in the A. thalianapolypeptide. From the crystal structure of yeast OYE (38Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), main chain interactions with bound FMN are predicted for all residues that are variant in the A. thaliana sequence. Thus, all requirements for a functional FMN-binding site are fulfilled by the A. thaliana protein. Furthermore, His191, Asn194, Tyr196, and Tyr375, which are critical for catalytic activity of OYE and may be part of the enzyme's active site (38Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar, 39Karplus P.A. Fox K.M. Massey V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1518-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), are all conserved in the A. thaliana sequence (His183, Asn186, Tyr188, and Tyr354). The conserved residues His191 and Asn194 of OYEs (corresponding to His183 and Asn186 in the A. thalianasequence) are also involved in binding the nicotinamide moiety of NADPH and are thus critical for electron transfer from NADPH to oxidized FMN (39Karplus P.A. Fox K.M. Massey V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1518-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). NADPH is also the preferred electron donor of OPDA reductase (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the turn between the β4-α4 domains of OYE contains a characteristic structural signature of unknown function conserved among OYE subfamily members C-terminally adjacent the active site (amino acids 207–222 of OYE1 (39Karplus P.A. Fox K.M. Massey V. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 1518-1526Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar)). This stretch is also conserved between OYE and the A. thaliana protein (11 amino acids out of 16 are identical). OYE1 is a member of the α,β-barrel class of proteins (38Fox K.M. Karplus P.A. Structure. 1994; 2: 1089-1105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Using the software Swiss-Model/RasMol v2.5 (40Peitsch M.C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 1996; 24: 274-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (899) Google Scholar,41Sayle R.A. Milner-White E.J. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1995; 20: 374-376Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2312) Google Scholar), the predictions of the most likely three dimensional structure of the A. thaliana protein yields an almost perfect fit to the three-dimensional structure of yeast OYE1 and clearly that of an α,β-barrel protein. Thus, information from the cDNA sequence and from structure predictions (not shown) leaves little doubt that the protein encoded by EST clone 179A13T7 represents a plant homolog of OYE. No indication of putative targeting sequences or transit-peptide sequences can be derived from the deduced amino acid sequence, in agreement with biochemical data showing that OPDA reductase is, in all probability, a cytosolic enzyme (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA encompassing the complete coding sequence of the putative OPDA reductase from A. thaliana, generated as detailed under “Experimental Procedures,” was inserted, as a BamHI/SmaI restriction fragment, into the multiple cloning site of the protein expression vector pQE-30. The construct (pQE-30-AT1) was electroporated into the E. coli host XL1-blue. IPTG-induced expression from this vector results in the formation of an N-terminally hexa-histidine (His6)-tagged protein. Although different concentrations of IPTG (0.1–2 mm), temperatures ranging from 28 to 37 °C, and induction periods between 1 and 16 h were tested, under all conditions, most of the expressed protein was associated with inclusion bodies, and only a minor portion remained soluble (not shown). Thus, total soluble protein from lysates of cells transformed with pQE-30-AT1 was affinity-purified on Ni-NTA-agarose. For controls, protein from cells transfected with the empty vector pQE-30 was always processed in parallel. As can be seen from Fig.5 A, there was little difference in the polypeptide patterns from cells transfected with either pQE-30-AT1 or pQE-30 alone, even after Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography (Fig. 5 A, lanes e versus E), since the expression level was too low to allow for effective competition of the tagged fusion protein with endogenous bacterial proteins for the metal binding sites on the column. The relevant area in the electropherograms was masked by a prominent ∼43-kDa polypeptide that co-eluted on Ni-NTA-agarose. The successful expression of the desired 41-kDa protein, and its binding to the affinity matrix, was, however, unequivocally demonstrated by immunoblotting using an antiserum against the C. sempervirens enzyme (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5 B). This protein was absent in control bacteria. Although some reduction of the substrate, OPDA, was observed in crude soluble protein fractions from control (pQE-30 transfected) bacteria, the determination of OPDA reductase activity in the fraction eluting from Ni-NTA-agarose revealed a clear increase in OPDA reductase activity in the immunoreactive protein fraction obtained from pQE-30-AT1-transfected cells (Fig.5 C; protein as in Fig. 5 B, lane E versus lane e). For structural identification of the reaction product, see below (Fig. 7). A characteristic property of yeast OYE is its specific retention on HBA-Sepharose and elution with the reductant, sodium dithionite (27Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It was found that the recombinant OPDA reductase (affinity-prepurified on NTA-agarose) was also retained by this column and eluted by sodium dithionite (Fig. 5, D and E). The experiment revealed some heterogeneity of the recombinant enzyme, a fast eluting fraction, which was an active OPDA reductase, a slower eluting, likewise enzymatically active fraction, and a strongly retained, immunoreactive polypeptide migrating slightly slower (43 kDa) in SDS-PAGE and being devoid of enzymatic activity. Clearly, OPDA reductase activity was associated with the recombinant 41-kDa polypeptide. The 43-kDa band probably represents reductase inactivated by some post-translational modification by the bacterial host cell, while the fast eluting, active reductase (E-1 fraction, Fig.5, D-F) is front-end eluted upon contact with reductant under our fast flow conditions. Next, it was determined whether the enzyme purified from C. sempervirens cell suspension cultures would also be retained on HBA-Sepharose. This was the case (Fig. 6,lanes 3–7); electrophoretically pure polypeptide was obtained by sodium dithionite elution (Fig. 6, lane 5). As a control, reference (27Abramovitz A.S. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1976; 251: 5321-5326Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) yeast OYE was also purified (Fig. 6, lane 1) for further characterization. The yeast fraction was checked for its immunoreactivity with the OPDA reductase antiserum from the higher plant (Fig. 6, lane 2); there was a clear and specific decoration of the 43-kDa polypeptide representing yeast OYE. Altogether, these results strengthen the conclusions drawn from the sequence information and prove that yeast OYE and higher plant OPDA reductase are similar in their size, overall biochemical properties, structure, and immunoreactivity and thus must be quite closely related. Similarities in enzymatic reactivity of OPDA reductase and OYE were suggested earlier by the observation that OPDA reductase would convert 2-cyclohexenone, a standard OYE substrate (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Although being the first discovered flavoprotein (18Warburg O. Christian W. Biochem. Z. 1933; 266: 377-411Google Scholar), the biological function of Warburg's Old Yellow Enzyme is still uncertain (42Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). The enzyme catalyzes the oxidation of a range of cyclic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds to phenols with concurrent reduction of the olefinic bond of a second substrate molecule, while also catalyzing the NADPH-dependent reduction of the olefinic bond in other cyclic or acyclic α,β-unsaturated carbonyl compounds, e.g. (42Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar). A natural substrate, however, is not known. We tested, if OPDA was a substrate for OYE. To avoid any potential contamination by endogenous materials, racemic pentadeuterated cis-OPDA (18[2H3],17[2H2]-cis-(±)-12-oxophytodienoic acid) was used as a substrate for yeast OYE. As a control, recombinantA. thaliana OPDA reductase was analyzed in parallel. Both enzymes converted, in an NADPH-dependent reaction, the pentadeuterated substrate to a product that had identical retention times on high performance liquid chromatography and capillary gas chromoatography as well as identical mass spectra which were in complete agreement with those of authentic OPC-8:0 (not shown). Thermal isomerization converted both reaction products into theirtrans-isomers which, again, exhibited identical chromatographic and mass spectroscopic behavior (Fig.7) in agreement with the literature (17Schaller F. Weiler E.W. Eur. J. Biochem. 1997; 245: 294-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). This established the structure of the reaction product unequivocally as [2H5]-OPC-8:0. Thus, yeast OYE can function as an OPDA reductase. Prostaglandin-like metabolites have been found in some yeasts (43Coetzee D.J. Kock J.L.F. Botha A. Van Dyk M.S. Smit E.J. Botes P.J. Augustyn O.P.H. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 311-318Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 44Kock J.L.F. Coetzee D.J. Van Dyk M.S. Cloete F.C. Van Wyk V. Augustyn O.P.H. S. Afr. J. Sci. 1991; 87: 73-76Google Scholar) and were assigned a biological role in ascospore development (43Coetzee D.J. Kock J.L.F. Botha A. Van Dyk M.S. Smit E.J. Botes P.J. Augustyn O.P.H. Syst. Appl. Microbiol. 1992; 15: 311-318Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 45Botha A. Kock J.L.F. Van Vuuren D.J. Van Dyk M.S. S. Afr. J. Sci. 1994; 90: 604-606Google Scholar). It is thus conceiveable that yeast OYE may play a role in the metabolism of yeast oxylipins. OPDA reductase catalyzes a decisive step in biosynthesis of plant octadecanoids, signal transducers in mechanotransduction, pathogen, and herbivore defense. Molecular cloning has revealed that the enzyme is the first plant member of the OYE family of reductases that now comprises members in bacteria, fungi, and higher plants. While all OYEs catalyze the NADPH-dependent reduction of olefinic bonds of α,β-unsaturated carbonyls, such as in morphinone (36French C.E. Bruce N.C. Biochem. J. 1995; 312: 671-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), 4,4-dimethyl-2-cyclohexenone (42Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), or 2-cyclohexenone (34Niino Y.S. Chakraborty S. Brown B.J. Massey V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 1983-1991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 42Vaz A.D.N. Chakraborty S. Massey V. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 4246-4256Crossref PubMed Scopus (133) Google Scholar), OPDA reductase is the only member within this family whose biological function is currently known. The proof that yeast OYE also has OPDA reductase activity suggests a physiological function of OYEs in oxylipin metabolism."
https://openalex.org/W2083663211,"In addition to tyrosine phosphorylation of the 66-, 52-, and 46-kDa Shc isoforms, epidermal growth factor (EGF) treatment of Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the human EGF receptor also resulted in the serine/threonine phosphorylation of approximately 50% of the 66-kDa Shc proteins. The serine/threonine phosphorylation occurred subsequent to tyrosine phosphorylation and was prevented by pretreatment of the cells with the MEK-specific inhibitor PD98059. Surprisingly, only the gel-shifted 66-kDa Shc isoform (serine/threonine phosphorylated) was tyrosine phosphorylated and associated with Grb2. In contrast, only the non-serine/threonine-phosphorylated fraction of 66-kDa Shc was associated with the EGF receptor. To assess the relationship between the three Shc isoforms in EGF-stimulated signaling, the cDNA encoding the 66-kDa Shc species was cloned from a 16-day-old mouse embryo library. Sequence alignment confirmed that the 66-kDa Shc cDNA resulted from alternative splicing of the primary Shc transcript generating a 110-amino acid extension at the amino terminus. Co-immunoprecipitation of Shc and Grb2 from cells overexpressing the 52/46-kDa Shc isoforms versus the 66-kDa Shc species directly demonstrated a competition of binding for a limited pool of Grb2 proteins. Furthermore, expression of the 66-kDa Shc isoform markedly accelerated the inactivation of ERK following EGF stimulation. Together, these data indicate that the serine/threonine phosphorylation of 66-kDa Shc impairs its ability to associate with the tyrosine-phosphorylated EGF receptor and can function in a dominant-interfering manner by inhibiting EGF receptor downstream signaling pathways."
https://openalex.org/W2046933986,"Trichohyalin (THH) is a major structural protein of the inner root sheath cells and medulla layer of the hair follicle and, to a lesser extent, of other specialized epithelia. THH is a high molecular weight insoluble α-helix-rich protein that forms rigid structures as a result of postsynthetic modifications by two Ca2+-dependent enzymes, transglutaminases (TGases) (protein cross-linking) and peptidyl-arginine deiminase (conversion of arginines to citrullines with loss of organized structure). The modified THH is thought to serve as a keratin intermediate filament matrix protein and/or as a constituent of the cell envelope. In this paper, we have explored in vitro the order of processing of THH to fulfill these functions, using an expressed truncated, more soluble form THH-8. THH-8 is a complete substrate for three known TGases expressed in epithelia, but the kinetic efficiency with TGase 3 is by far the greatest. Following maximal conversion of its arginines to citrullines, THH-8 is cross-linked even more efficiently by TGase 3, using most glutamines partially and all lysines. In addition, we show that insoluble aggregates of THH-8 or native pig tongue THH can be solubilized following peptidyl-arginine deiminase modification. Together, these data suggest an in vivo model in which THH located in insoluble cytoplasmic droplets is first modified by peptidyl-arginine deiminase which denatures it and makes it more soluble. This renders it available for efficient cross-linking by TGase 3 to form highly cross-linked rigid structures in the cells. This temporal order of reaction is supported by the observation that THH is expressed in hair follicle cells before the TGase 3 enzyme.

Trichohyalin droplets were first described by Vörner (1Vörner H. Dermatol. Z.

Subsequently, it was shown that the major if not only component of these droplets is a protein termed trichohyalin (THH) (2Rothnagel J.A. Rogers G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). THH has been isolated from sheep hair follicles (2Rothnagel J.A. Rogers G.E. J.

The THHs are high molecular mass (≥200 kDa) proteins that are insoluble under physiological conditions. They have been predicted to adopt an elongated (>200 nm) single-stranded α-helical conformation based on their unusually high content of charged residues (10Lee S.-C. Kim I.-G. Marekov L.N.

Their sequences suggested multiple roles in tissues such as calcium binding, structural roles, an interfilamentous matrix, and cornified cell envelope precursors (10Lee S.-C. Kim I.-G. Marekov L.N.

Although the role of THH in the palate, tongue, epidermis, or other tissues is not yet clear, its role in hair follicle biology is better understood. IRS cells are first identifiable at the base of the follicle by their content of THH droplets. A few cell layers higher, KIF are expressed. As terminal differentiation proceeds, the THH droplets disperse, and the contents become intermixed with the KIF (2Rothnagel J.A. Rogers G.E. J.

The IRS cells harden to form a rigid insoluble multi-layer sheath that plays an essential role in shape determination of the hair fiber cortical cells internal to the sheath structure (11Fraser R.D.B.

The mature IRS cells are packed with KIF that become highly aligned along the long axis of the cell and are separated by 1–2 filament diameters by a less densely staining matrix of THH (2Rothnagel J.A.

Differentiation. 1988; 37: 137-157Crossref PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar). In the terminally differentiated medulla cells within the mature hair fiber, the THH protein becomes dispersed as amorphous vacuolated deposits before the fiber emerges from the skin surface (12Auber L. Trans. R. Soc. Edinb. 1950; 62: 191-254Google Scholar). By entrapment of air, these vacuoles play an essential role in the maintenance of body temperature in mammals. Some of the biochemical events that modify the α-helical THH protein to an interfilamentous matrix (IRS) or unstructured (medulla) protein are now emerging. Early histochemical analyses revealed that while the THH droplets contain an arginine-rich protein, the mature IRS and medulla cells stain for citrulline (15Rogers G.E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1963; 11: 700-705Crossref Google Scholar). Subsequently it was shown that the Ca2+-dependent enzyme peptidyl-arginine deiminase (PAD) is responsible for this modification reaction (16Rogers G.E. Harding H.W.J. Llewelln-Smith I.J. Biochim.

Recently, we have shown that a bacterially expressed shorter form of human THH (THH domain 8, THH-8) is a substrate for the type 2 PAD enzyme (28Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar), the substrate specificity of which has been shown to be very similar to that of the type 3 enzyme (20Watanabe K. Akiyama K. Hikichi K. Ohtsuka R. Okuyama A. Senshu T. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 966: 375-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar). Interestingly, this reaction converts the highly α-helical THH-8 to a disorganized structure (28Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In addition, it was found that the proteins of the medulla were cross-linked by N ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bonds (29Harding W.W.J. Rogers G.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), formed by the action of one or more Ca2+-dependent transglutaminase (TGase) enzymes present in these tissues (30Harding H.W.J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Again, it was deduced that THH was a major substrate, based on limited sequencing analyses of isolated peptides from medulla (and IRS) digests (16Rogers G.E. Harding H.W.J. Llewelln-Smith I.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1977; 495: 159-175Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 24Harding H.W.J. Rogers G.E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1976; 427: 315-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), although characterization of peptides from THH containing citrulline and cross-linked by isopeptide bonds has not been reported yet. KIF can be isolated from mature IRS cells following limited proteolysis (35Steinert P.M. Dyer P.Y. Rogers G.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1971; 56: 49-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Apparently, proteolysis cleaves sequences on the end domains of the constituent KIF chains that are adjoined by cross-links between KIF and the interfilamentous THH (26Steinert P.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5045-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This releases morphologically intact KIF (although with somewhat pruned chains) and solubilized peptides highly enriched in cross-link and citrulline with a THH-like amino acid composition (26Steinert P.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 5045-5052Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, several questions remain to be elucidated. For example, the TGase enzymes used for cross-linking, and the glutamine and lysine residues of THH utilized, are not known. It has been speculated that the cytosolic so-called hair follicle or TGase 3 enzyme is involved (30Harding H.W.J. Rogers G.E. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 2858-2863Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 31Chung S.-I. Folk J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but cytosolic and membrane-associated forms of the TGase 1 enzyme, and the ubiquitously expressed TGase 2 enzyme, are also likely to be present in these cells (35Steinert P.M. Dyer P.Y. Rogers G.E. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1971; 56: 49-54Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 36Parenteau N.L. Pilato A. Rice R.H.

In this study, we have examined the substrate properties of THH-8 for TGases, established that TGase 3 enzyme is indeed favored to cross-link THH, and identified the glutamine and lysine residues used. Another fundamental question concerns the temporal order of the multiple postsynthetic modification processing events of THH. We demonstrate here that THH is most likely modified by PAD prior to cross-linking, in order for it be dispersed from the droplets and fulfill its roles in forming rigid structures in a variety of advanced differentiated epithelial tissues. The following were purchased: type 2 peptidyl-arginine deiminase (PanVera Corp., Madison, WI); [1,4-14C]putrescine dihydrochloride (specific activity, 109 mCi/mmol) (Amersham Corp.); the serine protease inhibitor 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (ICN Biomedicals, Aurora, OH); endoproteinase Asp-N (sequencing grade, Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany); precast polyacrylamide gels (Novex, San Diego, CA); and anti-TGase 2 antibody (clone TG100, NeoMarkers, Freemont, CA). An anti-TGase 3 antibody was raised in goats against bacterially expressed human TGase 3, 2E. Tarcsa, W. W. Idler, and P. M. Steinert, unpublished observations. and the cross-reactivity against TGase 1 was pre-absorbed on an affinity column prepared from bacterially expressed human TGase 1 (39Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G.

Dermatol. 1995; 104: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Domain 8 of human THH (THH-8, residues 1250–1849) was expressed and purified fromEscherichia coli as reported previously (28Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Intact pig tongue THH was purified as described (3Hamilton E.H. Sealock R. Wallace N.R. O'Keefe E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 881-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar), but after every step aliquots were frozen for further investigation. The protein concentration of the samples was determined by amino acid analysis or by the method of Bradford (41Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (216202) Google Scholar). Purified THH-8 (60 μg/ml) was incubated with PAD (2 μg/ml) in a buffer of 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 0.3m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 10 mm CaCl2 for 18 h at 37 °C. Under these conditions, THH-8 becomes maximally modified (≈65% of arginines converted to citrullines (28Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar)). Reactions were terminated by the addition of EDTA (10 mm final concentration) and subsequent heating to 70 °C for 30 min. Aliquots were hydrolyzed (5.7n HCl, 110 °C, 20 h) and analyzed (Beckman 6300 Analyzer). Corrections were made for hydrolytic losses of citrulline to ornithine (28Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). A specific polyclonal antibody was raised in rabbits (Lofstrand, Gaithersburg, MD) against recombinant human THH-8, which had been purified and refolded from bacterial inclusion bodies as described previously (28Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). The antibody was affinity purified by chromatography on a column of THH-8 covalently bound to ReactiGel (6 ×) (Pierce). The specificity and cross-reactivity of the antibody were determined by Western blotting using THH-8 bacterial cultures and mouse hair follicle lysates. Cross-linking reactions were carried out using full-length baculovirus expressed TGase 1, 3E. Candi, A. Lahm, R. Ceci, A. Rossi, G. Melino, and P. M. Steinert, submitted for publication. guinea pig liver TGase 2 (Sigma), or guinea pig hair follicle TGase 3 purified as described previously (34Kim H.C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The enzyme activities were measured by [14C]putrescine incorporation into succinylated casein, and an equal amount of activity (4 pmol of putrescine/min) was used for all TGases to compare their cross-linking efficiencies (43Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). THH-8 and PAD-modified THH-8 (50 μg) were incubated in a 1-ml reaction volume at 37 °C with the TGases in the presence of 1 mm DTT and 10 mm CaCl2. Aliquots were removed at different time points and terminated by the addition of EDTA and immediate boiling in SDS gel loading buffer. The reaction products were separated on 6% SDS-PAGE, blotted overnight onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and analyzed with the anti-THH-8 antibody. Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit antibody was used as the second antibody, and the detection was carried out with a chemiluminescent substrate (Supersignal, Pierce). Increasing concentrations (0.1–1.0 μm) of THH-8 or PAD-modified THH-8 were incubated at 37 °C with TGase 1, TGase 2, and TGase 3 enzymes in the presence of [14C]putrescine (40, 90, 160, and 300 mm) in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.8), 1 mm EDTA, 0.3m NaCl, 5 mm DTT, and 10 mmCaCl2 in a 100-μl reaction volume. The reactions were stopped at different time points by spotting 25 μl of the mixture on 3MM filter paper (Whatman) as described previously (43Candi E. Melino G. Mei G. Tarcsa E. Chung S.-I. Marekov L.N. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26382-26390Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The incorporated radioactivity was determined with liquid scintillation counting. The kinetic constants were calculated based on the modified double displacement mechanism as described previously (39Kim S.-Y. Kim I.-G. Chung S.-I. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 27979-27986Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In these studies putrescine was used in a large molar excess to avoid the cross-linking of THH-8 through putrescine bridges and, more importantly, to avoid the possible competition between the lysines of the THH-8 molecule and the putrescine for the acyl donor glutamines. [14C]Putrescine was incorporated into THH-8 or PAD-modified THH-8 (80 μg) using 4 pmol of putrescine/min of TGase 3 for 30 min. The reaction was stopped by heat (20 min, 70 °C), and the protein was digested with Asp-N (1:200 w/w for 18 h at 37 °C). The peptides were separated by HPLC on a 2.1 × 250-mm μBore column (Vydac, Hesperia, CA) with a flow rate of 0.24 ml/min and a linear 5–60% acetonitrile gradient in 60 min. The fractions containing radioactivity were sequenced (LF3000 sequencer, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, CA), and the radioactivity in each cycle was measured. THH-8 and PAD-modified THH-8 (50 μg) were cross-linked with TGase 3 (activity of 4 pmol/min) for 30 min. The reaction was terminated by heating (70 °C, 20 min), and the samples as well as uncross-linked controls were digested with Asp-N (1:200 w/w, 18 h, 37 °C). The peptides were separated on HPLC as described above, and the shifted peaks were sequenced. The amount of isodipeptide cross-link inserted into THH-8 was measured following total enzymatic digestion followed by amino acid analysis, as described previously (44Hohl D. Mehrel T. Lichti U. Turner M.L. Roop D.R. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6626-6636Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Amounts could also be estimated from the loss of lysine and glutamine residues. Frozen serial sections (6 μm) of 5-day-old mouse skin were hydrated in phosphate-buffered saline for 2 min and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min at 23 °C. Sections were incubated in 10% bovine serum albumin in saline for 2 h at 23 °C to reduce nonspecific binding. The antibodies used were as follows: polyclonal goat anti-human TGase 1 (dilution 1:50) (40Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Yoneda K. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar); mouse monoclonal anti-guinea pig TGase 2 (dilution 1:10); polyclonal rabbit (34Kim H.C. Lewis M.S. Gorman J.J. Park S.C. Girard J.E. Folk J.E. Chung S.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21971-21978Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or goat anti-human TGase 3 (dilution 1:5); and polyclonal rabbit anti-human THH-8 (dilution 1:30). Primary antibody incubations were carried out at 4 °C for 12–16 h. Primary antibody reactions were then visualized with appropriate affinity purified secondary antibodies (Cappel Organon Teknica Corp., Durham, NC), fluorescein-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (1:40), rhodamine-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (1:150) or anti-rabbit IgG (1:300), and biotin-conjugated anti-goat IgG (1:100) followed by either rhodamine- (1:100) or fluorescein (1:300)-conjugated streptavidin. Controls included incubation of sections with secondary antibodies only. Sections were observed as described previously (40Kim S.-Y. Chung S.-I. Yoneda K. Steinert P.M. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1995; 104: 211-217Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Human THH-8 and intact pig tongue THH (1.5–3 mg) were precipitated in 50% methanol. The pellets were washed in buffer and resuspended at 1 mg/ml in buffer of 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT and preincubated at 37 °C for 3 h with constant shaking to equilibrate with buffer. Under these conditions, the pellets of THH formed particulate suspensions (particle size ≥1 μm). PAD was added to the suspension and then made 10 mm to CaCl2 to initiate the reaction. Aliquots (50 μl) were withdrawn, mixed with 5 μl of 0.5m EDTA, and pelleted at 100,000 × g in an Airfuge (Beckman). Amino acid analyses were performed on the pellets and supernatants to measure citrulline contents and solubility. The purpose of this study was to understand better the complex series of postsynthetic modifications of THH, a major differentiation product of the IRS and medulla cells of the hair follicle/hair fiber, and a component of other epithelial tissues. However, full-length pig THH for example is only slightly soluble in buffers of physiological ionic strength and pH values (∼3 μg/ml): indeed, the method of its isolation is based in part on this unusual property (2Rothnagel J.A. Rogers G.E. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 102: 1419-1429Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 3Hamilton E.H. Sealock R. Wallace N.R. O'Keefe E.J. J. Invest. Dermatol. 1992; 98: 881-889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This also explains why the protein is initially deposited in cells in large insoluble droplets (reminiscent of inclusion bodies). Moreover, this property poses an important question: how does this insoluble protein fulfill its major presumed functions? Furthermore, THH in the fully differentiated cells is cross-linked by isopeptide bonds inserted by TGases, which cannot be cleaved specifically without also breaking peptide bonds; this imposes severe limitations on biochemical characterization of THH processing in vivo. To circumvent these technical difficulties, we have expressed the domain 8 portion of human THH (THH-8) that constitutes about 40% of the full-length protein (10Lee S.-C. Kim I.-G. Marekov L.N. O'Keefe E.J. Parry D.A.D. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 12164-12176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is sufficiently soluble (∼60 μg/ml) for in vitro biochemical assays (28Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). We have also demonstrated that THH-8 is a substrate for the PAD enzyme (28Tarcsa E. Marekov L.N. Mei G. Melino G. Lee S.-C. Steinert P.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30709-30716Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Early studies identifiedN ε(γ-glutamyl)lysine cross-links in the citrulline-containing proteins derived from the medulla (29Harding W.W.J. Rogers G.E. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 624-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar), most likely having derived from THH, but sequences of peptides containing citrulline and cross-links have not been reported. Nor is it known which of several TGase enzymes expressed in epithelial tissues is responsible for the cross-linking. We have used THH-8 as well as THH-8 that had been maximally modified by PAD (∼65% of arginines converted to citrullines, with a total citrulline content of 15%), prepared as described previously (28Tarcsa E.

There is one binding site for 2′-deoxyadenosine per C1/C2 heterodimer; the K d is 40 ± 3 μm. Binding is observed only in the presence of one of the products of the adenylyl cyclase reaction, pyrophosphate (PPi). A substrate analog, Ap(CH2)pp (α,β-methylene adenosine 5′-triphosphate), and cyclic AMP compete for the P-site in the presence of PPi, but P-site analogs do not compete for substrate binding (in the absence of PPi). Kinetic analysis indicates that release of products from the enzyme is random. These facts permit formulation of a model for the adenylyl cyclase reaction, for which we provide substantial kinetic support. We propose that P-site analogs act as dead-end inhibitors of product release, stabilizing an enzyme-product (E-PPi) complex by binding at the active site. Although product release is random, cyclic AMP dissociates from the enzyme preferentially. Release of PPiis slow and partially rate-limiting.

Although several mechanisms for P-site inhibition have been proposed, there is as yet no conclusive evidence to support any particular hypothesis. Using engineered, soluble forms of mammalian adenylyl cyclase, we and others have shown that the conserved cytosolic domains of the enzymes contain the structural components necessary for Gsα- and forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity, as well as the characteristic features of P-site inhibition (14Tang W.-J.

We have also utilized the competitive substrate analog Ap(CH2)pp to identify a single substrate binding site on the enzyme (19Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Binding of Ap(CH2)pp to adenylyl cyclase is completely unaffected by the addition of a potent P-site inhibitor. Neither of the two cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase contains a classical nucleotide binding motif, although these domains share approximately 200 amino acid residues of similar sequence. These observations add credence to the possibility that the substrate binding and P sites on the enzyme are structurally distinct. The experiments described herein further define the nature of the P site and the mechanism of P-site inhibition. P-site inhibition is also used as a tool to facilitate understanding of the reaction catalyzed by adenylyl cyclases. 2′-[3H]Deoxyadenosine (7 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN and lyophilized regularly to remove [3H]H2O. Ap(CH2)pp was also purchased from ICN. Hexokinase and type XI glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim and Sigma, respectively; these preparations were centrifuged, and the pelleted enzymes were resuspended in 20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0) prior to use. Recombinant Gsα and the two cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase, VC1(591)Flag and IIC2, were purified after expression in Escherichia coli as described (16Whisnant R.E. Gilman A.G. Dessauer C.W.

Gsα was activated (whenever used) by incubation with 50 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 20 mm MgSO4, 1 mm EDTA, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 400 μm GTPγS at 30 °C for 30 min; free GTPγS was then removed by gel filtration. Synthesis of cyclic AMP was measured as described (21Smigel M.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 1976-1982Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) for 10–15 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 100 μl. GTPγS-Gsα was present (400 nm) unless otherwise indicated. Activities are expressed per mg of the limiting adenylyl cyclase domain in the assay (VC1). The other cytosolic domain (IIC2) was present in excess (1 μm) to drive the interaction between the two protein fragments. To determine kinetic constants, the concentration of MgATP was varied from 10 μm to 2.56 mm with a fixed excess of 10 mm Mg2+. Initial velocities were linear with time, and less than 10% of the ATP was consumed at the lowest substrate concentrations. All points were measured in duplicate and experiments shown were repeated two to four times. Values are reported ± S.E. of the mean. Synthesis of ATP from cyclic AMP and PPi, the reverse reaction, was measured spectrophotometrically in the presence of glucose, hexokinase, NADP, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Reaction velocities were calculated from the linear increase inA 340 resulting from the reduction of NADP. Reactions contained 20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 50 mm glucose, 0.8 mm NADP, 3 mm free MgCl2, 1.7 units of hexokinase, and 0.3 units of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase in a volume of 500 μl. The concentrations of substrates varied: 1.25–20 mm for cyclic AMP and 0.125–4 mm for MgPPi. PPiwas always added last to avoid precipitation. Reactions were typically started by addition of 0.4 μm VC1, 2 μm IIC2, and 1 μmGTPγS-Gsα (final concentrations) to the other reaction components (at 30 °C), and absorbance changes were measured for 10–15 min in a Beckman DU650 spectrophotometer with a temperature-controlled cuvette holder. The increase in absorbance in the absence of adenylyl cyclase was subtracted as background (<0.006 OD units/min). Optical densities of greater than 1.5 were excluded from analysis. Equilibrium dialysis was performed essentially as described (19Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). To quantify binding of 2′-deoxyadenosine, each chamber contained 20 mm NaHepes (pH 8.0), 2.5 mm MgCl2, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 75 mm NaCl, 2′-[3H]deoxyadenosine (12.5–250 μm), and other additions as indicated. One chamber contained 18 μmVC1, 18 μm IIC2, and 25 μm GTPγS-Gsα; both of the cytosolic domains of adenylyl cyclase were necessary to observe binding. The opposite chamber contained buffer in lieu of the proteins. Samples were removed after dialysis for 24 h at 4 °C with rotation. Duplicate 15-μl aliquots from each chamber were analyzed by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Binding data have been normalized to protein concentrations based on the amount of active protein in the preparation, which was determined by titration with GTPγS-Gsα (19Dessauer C.W. Scully T.T. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 22272-22277Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Preparations of VC1 and IIC2 were more than 60% active by this criterion. We derived the rate equation for the reaction scheme presented in Fig. 5 using steady-state assumptions for the catalytic steps and rapid equilibrium for inhibitor binding. The critical features of the model include random release of products and no binding of P-site inhibitor to the free enzyme. The rates of both the forward and reverse reactions are complicated functions, described as v = [E t]*f([ATP], [cyclic AMP], [PPi], [2′-deoxyadenosine]), where v is the velocity in m/s and [E t] is the total molar concentration of enzyme. The equations that describe this function are presented in the “.” Because of their complexity, they have not been rearranged to conform to standard Michaelis-Menten format. Curve fitting of individual experiments and modeling of kinetic data based on the steady-state rate equations were performed using Sigma Plot (Jandel Scientific). Inhibition of the Gsα-stimulated catalytic activity of our preparation of adenylyl cyclase by the P-site inhibitor 2′-deoxyadenosine is uncompetitive with respect to MgATP (Fig.1). These reactions (and those described below) were performed with a limiting concentration of the C1 domain of type V adenylyl cyclase and an excess of the C2 domain of type II adenylyl cyclase to drive the protein-protein interaction that is necessary for catalytic activity. Similar uncompetitive kinetics has been observed previously with a more potent P-site inhibitor, 2′-deoxy-3′-AMP, using Gsα-stimulated bovine brain adenylyl cyclase (22Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) (presumably a mixture of isoforms) or a soluble system in which the two cytosolic domains of the enzyme were linked covalently (15Dessauer C.W. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16967-16974Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Although 2′-deoxyadenosine has an unfortunately high K i (240 ± 60 μm) compared with 2′-deoxy-3′-AMP (5 μm, data not shown), we have utilized 2′-deoxyadenosine for this work because of the availability of the compound in radiolabeled form. Adenylyl cyclases (native enzymes or the soluble system utilized here) display noncompetitive or mixed noncompetitive inhibition by P-site analogs with respect to MnATP (3Londos C. Preston M.S. J.

We have focused our analysis on Gsα-activated adenylyl cyclase activity with MgATP as substrate (in the absence of Mn2+) to avoid the complications of mixed patterns of inhibition and the use of a second divalent cation (particularly Mn2+ in the presence of PPi, which has limited solubility). Uncompetitive inhibition implies that 2′-deoxyadenosine and ATP do not combine with the same form of the enzyme; noncompetitive inhibition is consistent with such a mechanism (but does not demand it). Florio (25.Florio, V. A. (1983) Inhibition of the Catalytic Unit of Mammalian Adenylate Cyclase by Adenosine and Adenosine Analogs.Ph.D. thesis dissertation, University of Virginia.Google Scholar) suggested that P-site ligands were dead-end inhibitors that formed a complex with the PPi-bound form of the enzyme (see Fig. 5). Alternatively, Johnson and Shoshani (22Johnson R.A. Shoshani I. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 11595-11600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) suggested that the P site is distinct from the active site and that both inhibitor and substrate could be bound simultaneously. To distinguish between these possibilities, we utilized equilibrium dialysis to examine directly the requirements for binding of 2′-deoxyadenosine to adenylyl cyclase. This was not possible previously because of limiting quantities of protein. We were unable to detect binding of 80 μm 2′-deoxyadenosine to 18 μm VC1 and IIC2 in the presence of Gsα and Mg2+ or Mn2+ (Fig.2 A); similar results were obtained after addition of the substrate analog Ap(CH2)pp. However, a modest level of binding was detected upon addition of 5 mm ATP under conditions (24-h incubation and very high enzyme concentration) where ATP and the products of the adenylyl cyclase reaction, cyclic AMP and PPi, should be in equilibrium. (The equilibrium constant, 0.065 m (26Hayaishi O. Greengard P. Colowick S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5840-5843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), implies final concentrations of roughly 0.33 mm ATP and 4.67 mm cyclic AMP and PPi.) We thus tested the capacity of cyclic AMP and PPi to support binding of 2′-deoxyadenosine. Binding of the P-site inhibitor was readily observed in the presence of PPi; this was not true in the case of cyclic AMP. Binding of 2′-deoxyadenosine required both VC1 and IIC2 and was not observed with the individual proteins in the presence or absence of Gsαand/or pyrophosphate (Fig. 2 A and data not shown). Analysis of 2′-[3H]deoxyadenosine binding to adenylyl cyclase in the presence of activated Gsα, Mg2+, and 2.5 mm PPi revealed a single binding site per C1/C2 heterodimer with a K d of 40 ± 3 μm (Fig.3). Both cyclic AMP and Ap(CH2)pp inhibited the binding of 2′-deoxyadenosine, implying that these molecules compete with P-site inhibitors for a single binding site (Fig. 2 B). Inhibition by the substrate analog, Ap(CH2)pp, renders highly unlikely the possibility of 2′-deoxyadenosine binding to a site that is distinct from the catalytic site but that still requires PPi to be manifest. This is the first direct evidence in support of Florio's hypothesis (25.Florio, V. A. (1983) Inhibition of the Catalytic Unit of Mammalian Adenylate Cyclase by Adenosine and Adenosine Analogs.Ph.D. thesis dissertation, University of Virginia.Google Scholar) of dead-end inhibition of adenylyl cyclase by P-site agents. Binding of a P-site inhibitor that is observable only in the presence of a reaction product suggests that release of product from the enzyme is at least partially rate-limiting. Patterns of inhibition of enzymatic activity by product are useful in determining if release of product is an ordered or random event. Adenylyl cyclase activity is inhibited by both reaction products, and previous studies with the enzyme from Brevibacterium liquefaciens demonstrated their random release (27.Wolin, M. S. (1981) Adenylate cyclase from Brevibacterium liquifaciens: A kinetic characterization of the catalytic mechanism and regulation of the enzyme by uncomplexed Mg2+ and pyruvate. Ph.D. thesis dissertation, Yale University.Google Scholar). Our enzyme system also displays random release of products, since the kinetics of inhibition of enzymatic activity by both cyclic AMP and PP is mixed; this is the pattern predicted by steady-state models. The intersection points for double-reciprocal plots (1/activity versus1/substrate concentration) at increasing concentrations of either product, PPi (Fig.4 A) or cyclic AMP (Fig.4 B), are above the abscissa and to the left of the ordinate. A purely competitive pattern of inhibition is expected for both products only if rapid equilibrium kinetics applies (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). The slopes of Fig. 4 B are not a linear function of cyclic AMP concentration and tend to curve upwards at high concentrations of the cyclic nucleotide. This is also indicative of a steady-state system where the assumption of rapid equilibrium does not apply (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar). Finally, both cyclic AMP and PPi can compete with Ap(CH2)pp for binding to adenylyl cyclase (equilibrium dialysis data not shown); this again indicates that release of product is random. The equilibrium binding studies and patterns of product inhibition described to this point permit formulation of a model for inhibition of Gsα-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity by P-site inhibitors (Fig. 5). We observe binding of 2′-deoxyadenosine only in the presence of PPi, and therefore the inhibitor is hypothesized to bind to only a single intermediate along the reaction coordinate. This is consistent with the uncompetitive kinetic pattern between P-site inhibitor and substrate. If P-site inhibitors bind to the enzyme in the absence of PPi, the interaction is apparently quite weak compared with that with the enzyme-PPi complex. Analysis of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity by both a P-site inhibitor and PPi or cyclic AMP provides additional kinetic information about the mechanism of inhibition and catalytically important steps. A diagnostic test for the interaction between two inhibitors is provided by Dixon plots of 1/velocity versusthe concentration of one inhibitor at a constant concentration of substrate and different fixed concentrations of the other inhibitor (28Segel I.H. Enzyme Kinetics. John Wiley & Sons, New York1975Google Scholar) (Fig. 6). The family of curves obtained at different 2′-deoxyadenosine concentrations with respect to cyclic AMP are parallel, indicating that the actions of these two inhibitors are mutually exclusive (Fig. 6 B). The IC50 for inhibition by cyclic AMP increases as the concentration of 2′-deoxyadenosine increases in a manner analogous to the interaction between a competitive inhibitor and substrate. This result is consistent with equilibrium binding data, which suggested a competitive interaction between cyclic AMP and 2′-deoxyadenosine. A Dixon plot of 1/velocity versus the concentration of PPi at different fixed concentrations of 2′-deoxyadenosine yields a family of intersecting lines, indicating that the two inhibitors do not bind to adenylyl cyclase in a mutually exclusive fashion (Fig. 6 A). The slope of the line for one inhibitor now depends on the concentration of the second. The intersection of these curves above the [PPi] axis indicates slight synergy between PPi and 2′-deoxyadenosine, and such synergy is anticipated from the binding data. However, the degree of synergy is dependent on a number of factors. The complexity of this result will be discussed below. The reaction catalyzed by adenylyl cyclase is readily reversible (26Hayaishi O. Greengard P. Colowick S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 5840-5843Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Takai K.

The synthesis of ATP from cyclic AMP and PPi is activated by both Gsα and forskolin, as anticipated (Table I). The velocity of the reverse reaction is approximately 6% of that of the forward reaction assuming infinite substrate concentrations (TableII); a similar value was obtained with the pyruvate-stimulated bacterial enzyme (30Takai K.

The N-terminal region of aggrecan contains two structurally related globular domains, G1 and G2 separated by IGD domain. The G1 domain consists of three subdomains, A, B, and B′, structural features characteristic to many other HA-binding proteoglycans. Here, we studied the interaction of aggrecan domains with HA using recombinant proteins expressed in 293 cells, an embryonal kidney cell line. Deglycosylation of the recombinant aggrecan fragment reduced the HA binding activity. We found that both the B and B′ subdomains were required for HA binding and that a single module of A, B, or B′ was unable to bind HA. The A subdomain increased the HA binding activity of the B-B′ region. The G2 domain had no HA binding activity confirming previous reports. Studies of HA-binding properties using a BIAcoreTM biosensor system revealed that the K D of recombinant aggrecan fragment (AgW) consisting of G1, IGD, and G2 was 0.226 μm, whereas the K D of another HA-binding protein, native bovine link protein, is 0.089 μm. In contrast, AgMut11 which lacked subdomain A showed little HA binding activity. AgMut12 consisting of only B-B′ had a 3.4-fold lower affinity and AgMut13 containing A-B-B′ was 1.5-fold lower than AgW. These results suggest that carbohydrates are essential for high level aggrecan binding to HA and that the A subdomain of aggrecan functions in a cooperative manner with subdomains B and B′.

HA has various functions, including tissue morphogenesis, wound repair, cell migration, tumor invasion, and immune recognition (for review, see Refs. 1Knudson C. Knudson W. FASEB. J. 1993; 7: 1233-1241Crossref PubMed Scopus (601) Google Scholar and 2Sherman L. Sleeman J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar). These functions of HA are mediated through specific interactions with HA-binding molecules. A number of these extracellular matrix and cell-surface molecules have been identified and possible mechanisms of interaction with HA have been proposed (for review, see Refs. 2Sherman L. Sleeman J. Herrlich P. Ponta H. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1994; 6: 726-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (383) Google Scholar, 3Knudson W. Sheikh H. Uff C.R. Peck D. Isacke C.M. Am. J. Pathol. 1996; 148: 1721-1726PubMed Google Scholar, 4Hardingham T.E. Fosang A.J. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 861-870Crossref PubMed Scopus (1013) Google Scholar). Several studies have suggested that a proteoglycan tandem repeat (PTR), acts as a functional site of interaction with HA (5Perin J.P. Bonnet F. Thurieau C. Jolles P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 13269-13272Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Perkins S.J. Nealis A.S. Dudhia J. Hardingham T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 206: 737-753Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Most of the HA-binding molecules, including link protein and aggrecan, contain PTRs. For example, link protein contains three looped domains: A, B, and B′, in which B and B′ contain PTR modules. Aggrecan (7Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) is a member of a family of large extracellular matrix proteoglycans, which includes versican/proteoglycan-mesenchyme (8Zimmermann D.R. Ruoslahti E. EMBO J. 1989; 8: 2975-2981Crossref PubMed Scopus (502) Google Scholar, 9Shinomura T. Nishida Y. Ito K. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 14461-14469Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), neurocan (10Rauch U. Karthikeyan L. Maurel P. Margolis R.U. Margolis R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 19536-19547Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and brevican (11Yamada H. Watanabe K. Shimonaka M. Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10119-10126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These proteoglycans have N-terminal globular domains, G1, whose structure is homologous to link protein. Like link protein, G1 consists of an A subdomain and PTR-containing B and B′ subdomains. Aggrecan is the only member of this family containing an additional globular domain, G2, which has a structure similar to G1 and is separated from it by the interglobular domain, IGD, at the N terminus. The G2domain also contains B and B′ subdomains but without the A subdomain and lacks HA binding activity. The HA-receptor CD44 (12Stamenkovic I. Amiot M. Pesando J.M. Seed B. Cell. 1989; 56: 1057-1062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (565) Google Scholar) and the arthritis-associated protein tumor necrosis factor-stimulated gene-6 (TSG-6) (13Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) have been reported as HA-binding molecules. These molecules contain one PTR motif, suggesting that a single PTR can interact with HA. Although various HA-binding molecules with PTR have been reported, the HA-binding mechanism of PTR has not yet been well elucidated. For example, it is not clear which one of the PTRs of link protein or of the proteoglycans interacts with HA. The role of the A subdomain for HA binding is also unknown. Various expression systems have been employed to produce recombinant PTR molecules. However, studies of the HA-binding function using these systems have been hampered by insolubility of the PTRs, ternary structure formed by disulfide bonds, and possible effects of glycosylation on HA-binding function. Link protein (14Varelas J.B. Kollar J. Huynh T.D. Hering T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and TSG-6 (15Day A.J. Aplin R.T. Willis A.C. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) have been expressed in Escherichia coli. Since bacteria have no protein disulfide isomerases, disulfide bonds occur at random and the recombinant proteins do not form a correct structure. Therefore, refolding of the molecule with glutathiones (14Varelas J.B. Kollar J. Huynh T.D. Hering T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) or laborious purification steps to obtain molecules with correct structure were performed (15Day A.J. Aplin R.T. Willis A.C. Protein Exp. Purif. 1996; 8: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). Link protein has also been expressed in a baculovirus system (16Grover J. Roughley P.J. Biochem. J. 1994; 300: 317-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Since the glycosylation machinery of insect cells is different from that of mammalian cells, the HA binding of the recombinant protein may not be properly assessed. Recent nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies of the PTR structure of TSG-6 show that the ternary structure is similar to the C-type lectin domain (17Kohda D. Morton C.J. Parkar A.A. Hatanaka H. Inagaki F.M. Campbell I.D. Day A.J. Cell. 1996; 86: 767-775Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (266) Google Scholar). Since the TSG-6 was expressed in bacteria, these studies have not considered the role of glycosylation on structure and activity. Various assays have previously been established such as the transblot assay using labeled HA (18Yu Q. Toole B.R. Biotechniques. 1995; 19: 122-128PubMed Google Scholar, 19Yang B. Yang B.L. Goetinck P.F. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 299-306Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 20Hoare K. Savani R.C. Wang C. Turley E.A. Connect.

Acta. 1979; 578: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar), co-precipitation using HA-Sepharose or cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) (13Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (22Peach R.J. Hollenbaugh D. Stamenkovic I. Aruffo A. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 257-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Since HA has a highly negative charge, it may interact with any positively charged molecules or basic amino acid residues in a protein. Also by virtue of its viscous nature, HA may trap molecules nonspecifically. In addition, previous studies that used synthetic peptides to identify an active sequence of link protein for HA-binding (23Goetinck P.F. Stirpe N.S. Tsonis P.A. Carlone D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), were inconclusive (24Horita D.A. Hajduk P.J. Goetinck P.F. Lerner L.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 1699-1704Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we developed a novel mammalian expression system and expressed a soluble recombinant human aggrecan fragments consisting of various portions of the G1∼G2 domains linked to the C-terminal portion of the laminin γ1 chain. This system allows us, for the first time, to study the HA-binding function of recombinant aggrecan domains expressed in mammalian cells. We analyzed these recombinant proteins for HA-binding by several different methods including the HA-Transblot assay and lipid-conjugated HA-binding assay (HA-PE assay). We also used a BIAcoreTM biosensor instrument to evaluate the kinetics of binding of recombinant aggrecan fragments and bovine link protein to HA. By measuring the changes in surface plasmon resonance signal of aggrecan domain- and subdomain-specific mutants associating to and dissociating from the immobilized HA on the sensor chip, the binding characteristics of these molecules were monitored in real-time. This technique allows accurate and highly reproducible calculation of their kinetic rate constants. Our results suggest that both B and B′ are required for HA binding and that the A subdomain and carbohydrates are important for high level interaction between HA and aggrecan. A basic expression vector pBFX was constructed from the pcDNA3 vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) with several modifications. The pBFX vector contains the following sequences: cytomegalovirus promoter, a rabbit β-globin splicing site (25O'Hare K. Benoist C. Breathnach R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar), a human interleukin-2 receptor signal peptide sequence (26LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), a FLAG epitope tag (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems, Rochester, NY), a factor Xa cleavage site, and a segment of mouse laminin γ1 chain (27Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17111-17117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The splicing signal was placed in the 5′-untranslated region since it is necessary for high-level expression of the recombinant protein in stably transfected cells. 2Y. Yamada, unpublished data. The fusion protein can be purified with anti-FLAG antibody affinity column, and the recombinant protein can be released from the γ1 chain by factor Xa cleavage. The following is a detailed description for these modifications. First, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to generate a 207-amino acid cDNA segment of the mouse laminin γ1 chain using pfuDNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The forward primer was 5′-GGATCCATCGAAGGTCGTGCCATCAACCGGACCATAGCT-3′ (residues 4417 to 4437) with a BamHI linker site and factor Xa cleavage site at 5′-end and the reverse primer was 5′-GGGCCCTTAGCCGGTTGGTAGGGTCTTCTT-3′ (residues 6037 to 6007) with an ApaI linker site and a translation termination codon at 5′-ends. The reaction program was 25 cycles of 94 °C for 12 s, 58 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min (Gene Amp PCR System 9600, Perkin-Elmer, Norwalk, CT). The PCR-amplified DNA fragment that encodes factor Xa cleavage site (Ile-Glu-Gly-Arg) followed by the mouse laminin segment (27Sasaki M. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 17111-17117Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted at BamHI andApaI sites of pcDNA3. The interleukin-2 receptor and FLAG sequences were prepared by PCR with the plasmid cytomegalovirus-interleukin-2 receptor (26LaFlamme S.E. Akiyama S.K. Yamada K.M. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 437-447Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar) as a template using the following set of primers: 5′-GGTACCCCAAGGGTCAGGAAGATGGAT-3′ with a KpnI linker site; 5′-GAATTCCCGGAATTCCTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTA-3′ with anEcoRI linker site. The β-globin splicing signal was prepared by PCR with the plasmid pKCR (25O'Hare K. Benoist C. Breathnach R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 1527-1531Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar) and was cloned into theHindIII site. The resulting plasmid designated as pBFX was used as the basic vector for further aggrecan gene constructions. DNA segments for various regions of aggrecan were generated by PCR with pSA005 (7Doege K.J. Sasaki M. Kimura T. Yamada Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 894-902Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as a template using a set of primers carrying aXhoI linker site for the forward primer and aBamHI linker site for the reverse primer as shown in TableI. These primers are as follows: F1 and R1 for AgW; F2 and R1 for AgMut11; F2 and R2 for AgMut12; F1 and R2 for AgMut13; F1 and R3 for AgMut14; F1 and R4 for AgMut16; F2 and R3 for AgMut17; F3 and R2 for AgMut18; F4 and R1 for AgMut19. For construction of AgMut20, PCR was performed with primers F5 and R1, both of which carry a BamHI linker site. The amplified DNA was inserted into the BamHI site of AgMut16. The mutant proteins, AgMut21 and AgMut22, were constructed using a QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The cDNA insert from AgMut13 was subcloned into pBluescript II SK(−) and the plasmid was used as a template for mutagenesis. The primers used for AgMut21 were F6 and R5. In these primers, a TGG codon for tryptophan is replaced with a GCG codon for alanine. The primers for AgMut22 were F7 and R6. The sequence GCCGCC in the forward primer and GGCGGC in the reverse primer encoding two threonines are replaced by ACCACC encoding two alanines. The PCR fragments with the mutations were subcloned into theXhoI and BamHI sites of pBFX. The sequence of all expression constructs was confirmed by DNA sequencing using an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Table IPrimers for polymerase chain reactionsPrimerSequenceSubdomain/domain (residues)F15′-CTCGAGGAAACTTCAGACGATGACAAC-3′A loop/G1 (121–141)F25′-CTCGAGGGCATCGTGTTCCATTACAGA-3′B loop/G1 (514–534)F35′-CTCGAGGGTGAGGTCTTTTATGCAACA-3′B′ loop/G1 (817–837)F45′-CTCGAGGGGGTCGTCTTCCACTACCGC-3′B loop/G2 (1489–1509)F55′-GGATCCGGGGTCGTCTTCCACTACCGC-3′B loop/G2 (1489–1509)F65′-CCAAGAATCAAGGCGAGCCGTGTGTCCAAG-3′A loop/G1(271–300)F75′-CATGCACCCTGTGGCCGCCGCCCCTTCTAC-3′A loop/G1 (228–257)R15′-GGATCCTCGGAAGCAGAAGGCATGGTG-3′B′ loop/G2 (2082–2062)R25′-GGATCCTGTGTAGCAGATGGCGTCGTA-3′B′ loop/G1 (1110–1080)R35′-GGATCCACCCTCCATCTCCTCGGCGAA-3′B loop/G1 (819–799)R45′-GGATCCTTTCACCACGACTTCCAGGGT-3′A loop/G1 (513–493)R55′-CTTGGACAGACGGCTCGCCTTGATTCTTGG-3′A loop/G1(300–271)R65′-GTAGAAGGGGCGGCGGCCACAGGGTGCATG-3′A loop/G1 (257–228)Sequence underlined represents a XhoI or BamHI linker site.

The cells at ∼70% confluency in 6-well plates were transfected with 2 μg of expression vector DNA and 6 μl of LipofectAMINETM (Life Technologies, Gaithersburg, MD) per well according to the manufacturer's instructions. Forty-eight h after transfection, the medium was replaced with Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-10 containing 650 μg/ml G418 (Life Technologies). The cells were cultured for 10 days in the presence of G418 and a pool of stable transfectants was further grown to confluency. For preparation of recombinant proteins, 10 dishes (15 cm in diameter) of the confluent cells were used. The cells were rinsed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and collected in 10 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Brij 35, 10 mm EDTA, 2 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and 10 mm N-ethylmaleimide. The protein fractions were extracted twice from the cell lysate by homogenization and centrifugation for 30 min at 10,000 × g. The sample was sonicated on ice (W-385, Heat Systems-Ultrasocic, Inc.), and then was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was applied to an anti-FLAG M2 column (1 ml) pre-equilibrated with the buffer mentioned above. The column was washed twice with 5 ml of 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 1 m NaCl and 10 mm EDTA (TBSE), and twice with 5 ml of 4 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 30 mm NaCl, and 2 mm EDTA (one-fifth × TBSE) and eluted with 5 ml of 150 μg/ml FLAG peptide (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) in one-fifth × TBSE. The eluate was concentrated five times using a SpeedVac. The eluate from the anti-FLAG M2 column was further purified on a fast protein liquid chromatography system equipped with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc., Piscataway, NJ). Fractions with the recombinant protein, monitored by immunoblot analysis, were combined and stored at −80 °C. The purity of the recombinant proteins was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The concentration of the purified proteins was measured using a BCA protein assay kit (Pierce, Rockford, IL). The sample was separated by SDS-PAGE under both reducing and non-reducing conditions and was electrotransferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. The membrane was blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.15 m NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20 (TBST), and 5% instant non-fat dry milk (Super G, Inc. Landover, MD). For immunoblot analysis, the membrane was incubated with 2.5 μg/ml mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) in TBST containing 5% dry milk for 1 h at room temperature, then reacted with 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (Pierce). ECL detection reagents (Amersham, Cleveland, OH) were used to visualize protein bands. For the HA-Transblot assay, the membrane was incubated with 10 μg/ml biotinylated HA prepared as previously reported (28Yang B. Yang B.L. Savani R.C. Turley E.A. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 286-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar) for 2 h at room temperature after blocking (Biotinylated HA for the initial experiment was a gift from Dr. M. Yoneda, Aichi Medical University). The membrane was then reacted with 2 μg/ml horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin (Pierce, Rockford, IL) for 1 h, and treated with ECL to detect proteins that bound to biotinylated HA. The band density was quantitated using a densitometer (PDSI-PC, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA) for HA binding activity. A 96-well microtiter plate was coated with 50 μl (100 μg/ml) of HA conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine dipalmitoyl (HA-PE, a gift from Seikagaku Corp., Tokyo, Japan) (29Sugiura N. Sakurai K. Hori Y. Karasawa K. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15779-15787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in PBS at 4 °C overnight. The plate was then blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. After washing the wells with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 (PBST) three times, 50 μl of the sample solution was added to each well and was incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The anti-FLAG M2 antibody (1:1,000) was used as the first antibody and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:2,000) as second antibody. After washing the well with PBST, 50 ml of the substrate solution (100 μg/ml o-phenylenediamine, 1% (v/v) methanol, 0.01% (v/v) H2O2) was added and read at A 490 nm using a microtiter plate reader. As a control, bovine link protein or a biotinylated hyaluronan binding region (HABR) prepared from bovine nasal cartilage (30Heinegård D. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4250-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was reacted with HA. For bovine link protein, mouse monoclonal antibody, 8A-4 (a gift from Dr. B. Caterson, University of Wales), was used instead of anti-FLAG M2 antibody. For HABR, horseradish peroxidase-streptavidin was used instead of the antibodies. For studies of specificity, the same amount of chondroitin sulfate-PE or heparan sulfate-PE (a gift of Seikagaku Corp.) (29Sugiura N. Sakurai K. Hori Y. Karasawa K. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15779-15787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) as HA-PE was used. Chemical deglycosylation of the protein was performed using trifluoromethane sulfonic acid (TFMSA) as described previously (31Horvath E. Edwards A.M. Bell J.C. Braun P.E. J. Neurosci. Res. 1989; 24: 398-401Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). Briefly, 100 ng of the dry sample was resuspended in 10 μl of anisol (Fluka, Ronkonkoma, NY). Ninety μl of TFMSA was added to the reaction and it was incubated at 4 °C for 2 h. The sample was precipitated and washed five times with ice-cold diethyl ether. The precipitate was vacuum dried. For immunoblot analysis or HA-binding transblot assay, the sample was dissolved in SDS sample buffer. The Glycoshift De-N-Glycosylation kit (Oxford GlycoSystems, Bedford, MA) was used for enzymatic deglycosylation. Briefly, 200 ng of the recombinant proteins was incubated with 0.4 units of peptide N-glycosidase F for 1 h at 37 °C in TBS. The co-precipitation experiment was performed (14Varelas J.B. Kollar J. Huynh T.D. Hering T.M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1995; 321: 21-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), using HA-Sepharose (21Tengblad A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1979; 578: 281-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) or CPC as described previously (13Lee T.H. Wisniewski H.G. Vilcek J. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 116: 545-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar). For immobilization of HA to a SA sensor chip (Biacore, Inc., Piscataway, NJ), a solution of biotinylated HA at 40 μg/ml in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 m NaCl, 0.005% Tween 20 was injected into the flow cell at a flow rate of 5 μl/min. The amount of biotinylated HA immobilized in each flow cell was controlled by varying the injection volume of the protein solution. In the kinetic studies, the binding assays were performed at 25 °C with a constant flow rate of 50–100 μl/min in both association and dissociation phases. In brief, a series of protein concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 mm in running buffer was injected into the flow cell, and the change in response unit was recorded. After each run, regeneration of the sensor chip surface was accomplished by two successive injections of 15 μl of 5 mm HCl. The values for rate constants were determined by nonlinear regression analyses using BIAevaluation 2.1 software provided by the manufacturer and as described in detail by Karlsson et al. (32Karlsson R. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 221: 142-151Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 33Karlsson R. Stahlberg R. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 228: 274-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (258) Google Scholar). Association rate constants (k a ) were calculated from the linear portion of sensorgrams during the early association phase. Dissociation rate constants (k d ) were calculated from the early portion of the dissociation phase about 20 s after the completion of the sample injection during the wash-out period. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (K D ) was calculated as the ratio of k d /k a . The kinetic constants were determined by six to 10 independent experiments. The pBFX vector was constructed for expression of recombinant aggrecan fragments (Fig.1 A). A recombinant aggrecan fragment (AgW) containing the N terminus of human aggrecan core protein spanning from G1 to G2 domains was expressed in 293 cells, a human embryonal kidney cell line. AgW is a fusion protein consisting of a segment of the mouse laminin γ1 chain at the C terminus and the FLAG tag sequence at the N terminus. The cleavage sequence for factor Xa was inserted between the aggrecan G2domain and the segment of the laminin γ-1 chain. The FLAG tag was used for identification and purification of AgW. Expression of the recombinant protein as a fusion protein was necessary because the N-terminal portion of aggrecan without the γ1 chain was not expressed in 293 cells probably due to rapid degradation of the protein (data not shown). Hence, all recombinant aggrecan molecules in this study were expressed as a fusion protein. The AgW monomer was purified to an apparent homogeneity by two-step column purification with an anti-FLAG M2 antibody and a Superdex-200 FPLC column (data not shown). Approximately 200 μg of the recombinant protein was obtained from 10 confluent tissue culture dishes (15 cm in diameter). The expression of the recombinant protein was examined by immunoblot using an anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Fig. 1 B). The HA binding activity of AgW was examined by several methods. First, the HA-Transblot assay confirmed the HA binding activity of AgW (Fig. 1 B). Reduced AgW did not bind to HA (data not shown), suggesting the importance of disulfide bonds in the G1 domain for the activity as previously reported for link protein (23Goetinck P.F. Stirpe N.S. Tsonis P.A. Carlone D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2403-2408Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). To examine the effect of the laminin γ1 chain on HA-binding, the fusion protein (AgW) was cleaved by activated factor Xa and examined for its HA binding activity by the HA-Transblot analysis (Fig. 1 C). Western blotting with anti-FLAG M2 antibody showed that the fusion protein (M r 138,000) was cleaved to a protein consisting of FLAG sequence and the G1 and G2 domains (M r 86,000) with factor Xa. HA-Transblot showed that there is no difference in HA binding ability between the fusion protein and the factor Xa-cleaved 86-kDa product (Fig. 1 C). These results indicate that the laminin γ1 chain does not affect HA binding to AgW. The lipid-conjugated HA-binding (HA-PE) assay was also used to measure the activity of AgW and to compare its activity with bovine link protein and with the HABR that represents the G1 domain prepared by partial proteolytic digestion of native bovine aggrecan (30Heinegård D. Hascall V.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 4250-4266Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this method, PE dipalmitoyl, a lipid, was covalently coupled to the reduced terminus of the HA chain (HA-PE) and coated on a 96-well dish (29Sugiura N. Sakurai K. Hori Y. Karasawa K. Suzuki S. Kimata K. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15779-15787Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). PE has a high affinity for plastic while HA does not, which leads to the preferential attachment of PE to the dish, and leaves the HA portion of the HA-PE conjugate free in solution and available for binding. AgW had approximately 50 and 25% of HA binding activity when compared with the bovine aggrecan fragment and bovine link protein (Fig. 2 A). A control recombinant protein, FLAG-laminin γ1 chain, showed no HA binding activity. AgW did not bind to chondroitin sulfate or heparan sulfate (Fig. 2 B), indicating specific interaction of AgW with HA. Increasing s"

Herein we have cloned a cDNA for its human counterpart. SPA-1 cDNA encodes a 130-kDa protein (p130 SPA-1 ) consisting of proline-rich regions and rap1GAP-related domain followed by a coiled-coil stretch. Baculovirally expressed p130 SPA-1 exhibited GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity for Rap1 and Rap2, but not for Ras, Rho, Cdc42, Rac, and Ran, with comparable specific activity to the rap1GAP gene product (p85/95 rap1GAP ). In the cells, p130 SPA-1 was mostly localized at the perinuclear membranous region co-localizing with Rap1 and Rap2. Expression of SPA-1 and rap1GAP genes tended to be segregate in various tissues, lymphoid tissues expressing abundantSPA-1 transcript without rap1GAP, while those such as brain, kidney, and pancreas exhibiting rap1GAPmRNA with little SPA-1. Promyelocytic HL-60 cells, which expressed p130 SPA-1 with little p85/95 rap1GAP in uninduced state, showed progressive decline in p130 SPA-1 and conversely drastic increase in p85/95 rap1GAP as they ceased from proliferation and differentiated into macrophages by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate. These results suggested that products of SPA-1 and rap1GAPgenes, albeit comparable GAP activity for Rap1 and Rap2, functioned in the distinct contexts depending on cell types and/or states.

Stimulation of immunocompetent lymphocytes via antigen receptors induces a series of signal transduction including activation of phosphatidylinositol-phospholipase Cγ leading to the phosphatidylinositol turnover as well as Ras-signaling pathway (see Ref. 1Weiss A. Littman D.R. Cell. 1994; 76: 263-274Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1957) Google Scholar, for review), and the cells undergo extensive proliferation called clonal expansion. The activation of p21 ras is initiated by tyrosine kinases associated with receptors (2Downward J. Graves J.D. Warne P.H. Rayter S. Cantrell D.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 719-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (687) Google Scholar), which can be achieved in principle by two ways (3Boguski M.S. McCormick F. Nature. 1993; 366: 643-654Crossref PubMed Scopus (1762) Google Scholar). The receptors phosphorylated by the kinases may interact with an adaptor molecule Grb2, either directly or indirectly via a second adaptor such as Shc, which binds and recruits mSos to the membrane (4Lowenstein E.J.

Recently, a docking protein p62 dok, which served as an excellent substrate for the cytosolic tyrosine kinases and was able to bind to p120 Ras-GAP, has been cloned (10Yamanashi Y. Baltimore D.

Weiss A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 32579-32585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and to play a crucial role in the development and activation of lymphocytes (14Fischer K.D. Zmuldzinas A. Gardner S. Barbacid M. Bernstein A. Guidos C. Nature. 1995; 374: 474-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). Vav has been recently shown to function as a guanosine nucleotide exchange factor for Rac (15Crespo P. Schuebel K.E. Ostrom A.A. Gutkind J.S. Bustelo X.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 169-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar), a small G protein of Ras family required for the Ras-mediated signaling (16Qiu R.G. Chen J. Kirn D. McCormick F. Symons M. Nature. 1995; 374: 457-459Crossref PubMed Scopus (813) Google Scholar). Rap1 is another close member of Ras family small GTPases (17Pizon V. Chardin P. Lerosey I. Olofsson B. Tavitian A. Oncogene. 1988; 3: 201-204PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike Ras, Rap1 does not have oncogenic potential, but rather is shown to inhibit Ras-mediated oncogenic or growth-promoting activity (18Kitayama H. Sugimoto Y. Matsuzaki T. Ikawa Y. Noda M. Cell. 1989; 56: 77-84Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (763) Google Scholar, 19Cook S.J. Rubinfeld B. Albert I. McCormick F. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3475-3485Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar). Since Rap1 shares the same effector domain with Ras and can interact with several effector molecules of Ras pathway, it has been suggested that the Ras-antagonizing effects of Rap1 was due to the competitive inhibition for the Ras effectors such as Raf-1 and p120 Ras-GAP (20Frech M.

Rap1 is also implicated to be involved in the cAMP-induced inhibition of Ras-MAP kinase pathway (23Altschuler D.L. Peterson S.N. Ostrowski M.C. Lapetina E.G. J. Biol.

Chem. 1996; 271: 8564-8569Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). On the other hand, GAP specific for Rap1 (rap1GAP) was previously identified (27Kikuchi A. Sasaki T. Araki S. Hata Y. Takai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9133-9136Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 28Polakis P.G. Rubinfeld B. Evans T. McCormick F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 239-243Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar) and molecularly cloned from the human brain (29Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). The rap1GAP, however, was reported to be expressed mostly in the brain with little expression in the lymphoid tissues where the highest Rap1 GAP activity was detected (29Rubinfeld B. Munemitsu S. Clark R. Conroy L. Watt K. Crosier W.J. McCormick F. Polakis P. Cell. 1991; 65: 1033-1042Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). We have previously cloned a new gene, Spa-1, transcriptionally induced in the mouse lymphocytes by mitogenic stimulation (30Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur e Kamal M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The original Spa-1 cDNA contained an ORF encoding 693 residues, the N-terminal portion (190 residues, ΔN GRD) of which was highly homologous to human rap1GAP. The GST fusion protein of ΔN GRD was indicated to show GAP activity for Rap1 and Ran, although activity of the complete protein remained to be seen (30Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur e Kamal M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It was recently found that the original Spa-1cDNA clone had 1-base deletion in its N terminus, and the corrected cDNA sequence was revealed to contain a N terminally extended ORF longer than originally reported (1,038 residues). In the present study, we have cloned a human SPA-1 cDNA that contained an ORF encoding 1,042 residues 90% identical to that of the revised mouse cDNA. We now show that the SPA-1 gene product in its complete form (130 kDa) exhibits a specific GAP activity for Rap1 and Rap2, but not for Ran or other small GTPases. It was indicated that the expression patterns of SPA-1 and rap1GAP genes were quite distinct and tended to be segregate in various human tissues, in that lymphoid tissues abundantly expressed SPA-1transcript in the absence of rap1GAP, while tissues such as brain, kidney, and pancreas strongly exhibitedrap1GAP transcript with little SPA-1 expression. Furthermore, the expression of p130 SPA-1 and p85/95 rap1GAP was regulated in an opposite manner during the growth arrest and differentiation of promyelocytic HL60 cells into macrophages, raising a possibility that these proteins albeit the comparable Rap1 GAP activity exhibited distinct functions in the cells. Poly(A)(+) RNA was prepared from the human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (2 μg/ml) and TPA (10 ng/ml) for 48 h and the cDNA library was made in a pcDL-SRα296 vector. Using a 32P-labeled mouse full-length Spa-1 cDNA as a probe, a cDNA was isolated by colony hybridization with high stringency condition. The insert of 3.6 kilobase pairs was subcloned into pBluescript KS(+) vector (Stratagene, CA) and sequenced. To introduce a BamHI site just before the initiation codon, the fragment encoding the N-terminal region of human SPA-1 (residues 285 to 805) was amplified by polymerase chain reaction using the sense (5′-ATGGATCCACAGAGCATGCCCATGT) and the antisense (5′-CCGAGCTCACACACAAAGCCAGGTGC) primers. After digestion withBamHI and SacI, the fragment was ligated into theBamHI-XhoI site of pSP73 vector (Promega Corp., WI) together with the SacI-XhoI fragment of the pBluescript KS(+) SPA-1 cDNA. The C-terminally 6 × histidine (His)-tagged pBac SPA-1 was constructed as follows. After removing the NcoI-XhoI fragment from pSP SPA-1, the NcoI-BstXI fragment of pSP SPA-1 and theBstXI-XhoI synthetic oligonucleotides including 3′ His and the stop codon (5′-CTGGGCTCACCCACCGCCGACCTGGCGAATTCGATGCATCACCATCACATCACTGAC and 5′-TCGAGTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCATCGAATTCGCCAGGTCGGCGGTGGGTGAGCCCAGCTGC) were ligated into the NcoI-XhoI site of the pSPSPA-1. Then the BamHI-XhoI fragment of pSP SPA-1-His was subcloned into the pBacPAK8 (CLONTECH). To generate the C terminally His-tagged pBac rap1GAP, pAcRG9T (provided by Dr. B. Rubinfeld, Onyx Inc., Emeryville, CA) was digested with BglII andPvuII, and the fragment was ligated into theBamHI-XhoI site of pBacPAK8 together with thePvuII-XhoI synthetic oligonucleotides including 3′ His and the stop codon 5′-CTGGAAGCATCTGAGCAGCACATGCCCCAGCTGGGCTGTAGGAATTCGATGCATCACCATCACCATCACTGAC and 5′-TCGAGTCAGTGATGGTGATGGTGATGCATCGAATTCCTACAGCCCAGCTGGGGCATGTGCTGCTCAGATGCTTCCAG). pNeo SRα SPA-1 was constructed by subcloning theBamHI-XhoI fragment of pSP SPA-1 into the BamHI-XhoI site of pNeoSRα. N terminally His-tagged mouse E1, provided by Dr. F. Yamao, National Institute of Genetics, Mishima, Japan, was subcloned intoSmaI-EcoRI sites of a pVL1393 baculoviral transfer vector (Invitrogen Corp.). All constructs were confirmed by sequencing. Using pSPSPA-1 as a template, in vitro transcription and translation was done by the TNT-coupled wheat germ extract system (Promega) with [35S]methionine according to the manufacture's protocol. cDNAs for Rap1A and Ras were provided by Dr. H. Maruta, Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research, Melbourne, Australia; cDNA for Ran by Dr. M. Dasso, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD; cDNAs for RhoA, Cdc42, and Rac by Dr. S. Narumiya, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan; and cDNA for Rap2A was supplied from Dr. J. Gunzburg, INSERUM, France. All small G proteins were expressed as GST fusion proteins and purified from Escherichia coli by single step purification using glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia Biotech, Sweden) as described previously (30Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur e Kamal M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). The His-tagged SPA-1 and rap1GAP proteins were expressed by the Sf9/baculovirus expression system. To generate recombinant virus, 0.5 μg of pBacPAK8 transfer vector containing each cDNA was cotransfected with 5 μl of BacPAK6 viral DNA (Bsu36I digest, CLONTECH) into insect Sf9 cells. Recombinant virus was then isolated by plaque purification. 4 × 105/ml Sf9 cells were infected with the recombinant virus at 1–5 plaque forming units/cell and incubated at 27 °C. After 48 h, the cells were harvested, washed with phosphate-buffered saline, and lysed with lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate). The recombinant proteins were purified by single step purification using Ni-NTA-agarose (QIAGEN Inc., Chatsworth, CA), dialyzed against 50 mm Na-PO4, pH 7.0, containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, aliquoted, rapidly frozen in liquid N2, and then stored at −80 °C. [γ-32P]GTP was loaded to the GST fusion proteins of various small GTPases as follows. Small G proteins (5 μg) were added to 20 μl of 4.4 nm[γ-32P]GTP (ICN Biochemicals Inc.) diluted with exchange buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5 mmEDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin) and the mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 30 min for Rap1A, Rap2A, Ran, and Ras, or at room temperature for 10 min for RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. After adding MgCl2 to final concentration of 15 mm, 20 μl of the [γ-32P]GTP-loaded proteins were added to the GAP samples (100 μl) in exchange buffer containing 15 mm MgCl2 or bufffer control. Samples were incubated at 30 °C (Rap1A, Rap2A, Ran, and Ras) or at 24 °C (RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42) for indicated periods. Reaction was stopped by adding 1 ml of ice-cold 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, containing 15 mm MgCl2, followed by rapid vacuum filtration through NC45 nitrocellulose membrane filter. The filters were washed three times with 4 ml of the same buffer, dried, and the radioactivity remaining on the filter was counted by liquid scintillation counter. Rabbit antiserum was raised against the N-terminal region of mouse Spa-1 (SpaN, residues 245 to 801) by immunizing with a recombinant thioredoxin (Trx)-SpaN fusion protein. The antiserum was affinity purified using the immobilized Trx-SpaN fusion protein on Affi-Gel 10 (Bio-Rad) followed by extensive adsorption with the immobilized Trx. Anti-rap1GAP antiserum was kindly provided by Dr. P. Polakis, Onyx Inc., Emeryville, CA, and anti-βCOP antiserum was a gift from Dr. J. Donaldson, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD. Anti-Rap1, anti-Rap2, and anti-calnexin antibodies were purchased from the Transduction Laboratories Inc., Lexington, KY. Lysates of cell lines or Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculovirus were incubated with 2 μg/ml purified anti-SpaN antibody followed by precipitation with protein A-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia). The beads were washed, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were transferred to the polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, probed with the indicated antibodies, and visualized using horseradish peroxidase-coupled ECL detection system. Northern blot analysis was performed as described previously (30Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur e Kamal M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). HeLa cells were transfected with a SPA-1 cDNA in pSRα expression vector with a CaPO4 precipitation method. Two days later, the cells were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline, fixed with 3% folmaldehide, permealized with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in phosphate-buffered saline, blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and then stained with various antibodies followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated second antibodies. They were examined with a confocal laser microscopy. HL60 cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (CCL-240) and maintained in RPMI 1640 medium (Life Technologies, Inc., Rockville, MD) supplemented with 20% fetal calf serum and antibiotics. For the induction of differentiation, HL60 cells were plated at 1 × 106 cells/ml and exposed with 1 × 10−7m TPA (Sigma) for the indicated periods of time. Morphological examination was done by Wright-Giemza staining, and cell cycle analysis was performed using a flow cytometry as described before (30Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur e Kamal M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). 5 × 106 cells were resuspended in 500 μl of hypotonic buffer (10 mmHEPES pH 7.5, 5 mm KCl, 2 mmMgCl2), incubated at 4 °C for 5 min, and then lysed with the Dounce homogenizer. After centrifugation at 2,500 rpm for 5 min to remove nuclear fraction, the supernatant was separated into the S100 and P100 fractions by ultracentrifugation at 100,000 ×g for 1 h. A cDNA of 3.6 kilobase pairs long has been cloned from the cDNA library of phytohemagglutinin-stimulated human PBL using a murine Spa-1cDNA probe. Despite the extremely high overall homology to the murine Spa-1 cDNA (83% identical at the nucleotides level), the human cDNA contained an ORF (nucleotides 297 to 3425, 1,042 residues) much longer than that of previously reported mouseSpa-1 cDNA (nucleotides 1194 to 3277). This prompted us to re-examine the original mouse Spa-1 cDNA sequence carefully, and by the sequencing of independent cDNA as well as genomic clones the original mouse Spa-1 cDNA clone was found out to have one base deletion at nucleotide 378. Inclusion of the missing nucleotide negated the previous initiation codon and resulted in the N-terminal extension of the ORF retaining the reading frame, now encoding 1,038 residues. Alignment of the human and revised murine cDNAs revealed that the deduced amino acid sequences of the ORFs were 90% identical (Fig. 1 A). A N-terminal region (residues 192 to 539) was highly homologous to human rap1GAP (GRD), 38% of residues being identical, and almost perfectly conserved between human and mouse (98% identical). The region covered entire reported catalytic region ofrap1GAP (33Rubinfeld B. Crosier W.J. Albert I. Conroy L. Clark R. McCormick F. Polakis P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 4634-4642Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). N terminally to the GRD was a proline-rich region including possibly SH3-binding motifs (PPXXP), and a coiled-coil stretch with hydrophobic heptad repeats was noted at the C terminus following the probable PEST sequences (Fig. 1 B). A leucine zipper-like motif (Lx6Lx6Lx6Ex6Lx6Lx6L) at the C terminus was also completely conserved between the two species. There are a number of possible phosphorylation sites, including those by Cdk2 in the N-terminal region. In vitrotranscription/translation of the full-length SPA-1 cDNA resulted in the single protein with relative molecular mass 130 kDa, comparable to the calculated molecular mass 112 kDa (Fig.2 A). An identical protein was produced by the baculoviral expression system, and the recombinant human p130 SPA-1 was found to be cross-reactive to anti-mouse Spa-1 antibody (SpaN) by immunoprecipitation/immunoblotting (Fig.2 B). When expressed by baculovirus, a minor C-terminally truncated 85-kDa product devoid of His-tag was usually detected by SpaN (Fig. 2 B). Using the antibody, both human and mouse endogenous SPA-1 proteins could be indeed identified to be 130-kDa proteins in HL60 promyelocytic and 70z/3 pre-B cell lines (Fig.2 B). Using the baculovirally expressed recombinant protein (Fig.3 A), we now examined GAP activity of the SPA-1 in its complete form (p130 SPA-1 ) for a series of small G proteins. As summarized in Fig. 3 B, p130 SPA-1 potently stimulated the GTPase activity of Rap1A and Rap2A, both of which showed negligible intrinsic GTPase activity, without affecting that of other small G proteins such as Ras, Rho, Cdc42, and Rac. Unlike a GST-ΔN GRD (residues 346 to 539) fusion protein of mouse Spa-1, p130 SPA-1 failed to show any significant Ran GAP activity either. A control protein E1 similarly expressed in the baculoviral expression system showed no detectable GAP activity at all for any of the GTPases. We then compared the specific GAP activity of p130 SPA-1 with that of the baculovirally expressed p85/95 rap1GAP (Fig. 3 A). As shown in Fig.3 C, the specific GAP activity of p130 SPA-1 for Rap1A was nearly equivalent to that of p85/95 rap1GAP, which was some 40 times more active than the previously reported GST-ΔN GRD fusion protein (30Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur e Kamal M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Interestingly, p85/95 rap1GAP appeared to be significantly more effective for Rap2A than Rap1A in our hands, while p130 SPA-1 showed comparable activity against both (Fig. 3, C and D). Subcellular fractionation analysis was done to see the intracellular localization of p130 SPA-1 using HL60 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, the vast majority of p130 SPA-1 was detected in the insoluble membrane fraction (P100), although a minor portion was also found in the soluble fraction (S100). In the parallel experiments, both Rap1 and Rap2 were exclusively detected in the P100 fraction, as was endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein calnexin. A significant portion of p130 SPA-1 was also associated with the nuclear fraction, but it was most likely due to the contamination of undisrupted cells and/or insoluble cytosolic microsomes because a endoplasmic reticulum-resident protein calnexin was similarly detected in the preparation (see also below). Since immunostaining analysis was rather difficult in the hematopoietic cells, further study was performed by the transient expression of SPA-1 cDNA into HeLa cells, which exhibited undetectable endogenous SPA-1transcript (data not shown). As shown in Fig.5, the expression of p130 SPA-1 was detected with anti-SpaN in the cytosol in a speckled pattern with predominant localization in the perinuclear region (B) possibly including juxtanuclear Golgi area stained with anti-βCOP (E), and no staining was detected at all in the nucleus. This particular pattern did not seem to simply reflect overexpression of the protein, since predominant perinuclear staining was similarly observed in the cells only weakly expressing the protein (B). The staining pattern of p130 SPA-1 was quite similar to those of Rap1 and Rap2 as well as calnexin (Fig. 5, C, D, and F). Taken together, it was suggested that p130 SPA-1 was in the cytosol associated mostly, if not exclusively, with the perinuclear endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi region, probably colocalized with Rap1 and Rap2.Figure 5Immunostaining for the p130 SPA-1 . HeLa cells were transfected with a SPA-1 cDNA in a pSRα expression vector, and 2 days after transfection, the cells were fixed and stained with control IgG (A), anti-SpaN (B), anti-Rap1 (C), anti-Rap2 (D), anti-βCOP (E), or with anti-calnexin (F) followed by a fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated corresponding second antibody and analyzed by a confocal laser scanning microscopy.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Since it was indicated that p130 SPA-1 functioned as GAP for Rap1 with comparable specific activity with p85/95 rap1GAP, expression of both transcripts was then compared in various normal human tissues.SPA-1 mRNA was expressed quite abundantly in the lymphoid tissues such as thymus, spleen, and PBL (Fig.6 A), conforming to the results in mice (30Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur e Kamal M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). It was also expressed in some other tissues albeit by far lower levels. It should be noted, however, that the preparations of these tissues such as intestine and colon were inevitably contaminated by the associated lymphoid tissues as well as PBL expressing abundantSPA-1 transcript, possibly leading to the overestimation. In the brain and kidney, on the other hand, SPA-1 transcript was hardly detected. In contrast, rap1GAP mRNA was significantly expressed in the brain, kidney, and strongly in pancreas, while it was undetectable in the lymphoid tissues and PBL (Fig.6 A). Although not shown, among the nervous system,rap1GAP transcript was most abundant in the cerebral cortex with much less expression in the spinal cord, while significantSPA-1 mRNA was detected in the spinal cord with undetectable expression in the cerebral cortex. These results indicated not only that SPA-1 and rap1GAP showed distinct tissue distribution patterns, but also that their expression tended to segregate each other, the lymphoid system exclusively expressingSPA-1 while the nervous system and kidney mainlyrap1GAP. To confirm the above notion, various human leukemia/lymphoma cells were also examined. As shown in Fig.6 B, SPA-1 transcript was expressed in all lines at varying degrees, while that of rap1GAP was hardly detected in any of them. Among them, SP49 lymphoma cells which had t(11q13;14q32) chromosomal translocation at the BCL-1 site expressed unusually high level of SPA-1 mRNA (Fig. 6 B) as well as p130 SPA-1 (data not shown), which is interesting because human SPA-1 locus is mapped at the 11q13 in the neighborhood close to BCL-1 (31Wada Y. Kubota H. Maeda M. Taniwaki M. Hattori M. Imamura S. Iwai K. Minato N. Genomics. 1997; 39: 66-73Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). We have previously suggested that the expression of murineSpa-1 was regulated in association with the proliferative state of cells (30Hattori M. Tsukamoto N. Nur e Kamal M.S. Rubinfeld B. Iwai K. Kubota H. Maruta H. Minato N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 552-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), and therefore intended to examine the possible regulation of p130 SPA-1 during the cellular growth and/or differentiation in comparison with p85/95 rap1GAP in a defined system. Human promyelocytic HL60 line is induced to differentiate into macrophage by TPA, which is manifested by gradual morphological changes from floating round cells to firmly adherent large spread cells (Fig. 7 A). The process is preceded by the rapid arrest of cell cycle at G1/0 stage (Fig. 7 A). As shown in Fig.7 B, uninduced proliferating HL60 expressed a significant level of p130 SPA-1 . When the cells were induced by TPA, however, the level of p130 SPA-1 was progressively re"

As rescue dNTP concentrations are increased, pol III holoenzyme suffers a maximum 8-fold reduction in fidelity as proofreading of mispaired primer termini are reduced in competition with incorporation of a next correct nucleotide.

Chem. 272, 27931–27935 (accompanying paper)). The first in vitro measurement of DNA synthesis fidelity was carried out by Kornberg and co-workers in 1962 (1Trautner T.A. Swartz M.N. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1962; 48: 449-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) to analyze the mutagenic behavior of 5-bromouracil. Pol I 1The abbreviations used are: pol I, E. coli DNA polymerase I; pol III, E. coli DNA polymerase III; pol III core, comprised of α (polymerase), ε (3′ → 5′ proofreading exonuclease), and θ; pol III holoenzyme, comprised of pol III core + β (sliding processivity clamp) + γ complex (clamp loading complex containing γ, γ′, δ, χ, ψ); α holoenzyme, comprised of α + β, γ complex; pol δ; eucaryotic DNA polymerase δ; p/t, primer/template; SSB, E. coli single-stranded DNA-binding protein; T (in boldface), refers to the template target site at which fidelity is measured and should not be confused with T which refers to a template thymine; SCH, single completed hit conditions referring to extension of a primer via interaction with a DNA polymerase at most once, followed by polymerase dissociation; MCH, multiple completed hit conditions referring to extension of a primer via multiple interactions with DNA polymerase. was found to misincorporate dGMP more readily opposite template bromouracil than opposite T, thus providing a biochemical basis for understanding bromouracil's ability to stimulate A·T → G·C transition mutations in Escherichia coli and bacteriophage T4 (2Freese E.

The next 3 decades bore witness to a wide range of fidelity studies investigating the biochemical basis of spontaneous and base analog-induced mutagenesis. These studies focused primarily on elucidating the properties of DNA polymerases and proofreading 3′-exonucleases and on developing and implementing methods to measurein vitro and in vivo mutational spectra.

However, polymerases can interact with groups of accessory proteins to carry out processive chromosomal replication. The first experiments to identify and characterize proteins that confer high processivity were performed by Alberts, Nossal, and co-workers (6Nossal N.G. Alberts B.M. Mathews C.K. Kutter E.M.

These studies were instrumental for the subsequent development of in vitro systems to study replication holoenzymes from E. coli (8Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol.

Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). X-ray diffraction data show that the β subunit is a doughnut-shaped dimer that can form a ring around DNA (15Kong X.-P. Onrust R. O'Donnell M. Kuriyan J. Cell. 1992; 69: 425-437Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar) and functions as a sliding clamp that inhibits dissociation of pol III core from DNA during chain elongation (14Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The five-subunit γ complex is required to load β onto DNA (9McHenry C.S. Annu.

The processivity of pol III core alone is only 10–20 nucleotides (16Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while in the presence of β and γ complex it is increased to greater than 5000 nucleotides (8Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6561-6569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis of the specific effects of β, γ complex on fidelity is key to understanding the effect of processivity proteins on base substitution and frameshift mutations. It has been shown that mutations in T4 polymerase accessory proteins in vivo can cause both mutator and antimutator effects on the levels of spontaneous base substitution mutations (17Watanabe S.M. Goodman M.F. J. Virol. 1978; 25: 73-77Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A measurement of T7 pol fidelity in anin vitro gap-filling assay suggests that processive synthesis, requiring the presence of thioredoxin, leads to an elevation in base substitutions and simple frameshift mutations in nonrepetitive sequences (18Kunkel T.A. Patel S.S. Johnson K.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6830-6834Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). A recent study of eucaryotic pol δ suggests that nucleotide misincorporation efficiencies are increased in the presence of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen sliding clamp, a eucaryotic sliding clamp analogous to the E. coli β subunit (19Mozzherin D.Ju.

In this paper, we analyze the individual and combined effects of the β, γ complex and ε proofreading exonuclease on nucleotide misincorporation efficiencies using a generalized gel kinetic assay (20Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). We compare fidelities at the same p/t DNA site for α subunit, α holoenzyme, pol III core, and pol III holoenzyme; α is the polymerase subunit of pol III core, which lacks proofreading activity. We also quantify a fundamental hallmark of proofreading, the dependence of pol III holoenzyme fidelity on the concentration of next correct dNTP. Fidelity measurements for enzymes with poor processivity and/or high fidelity, such as are reported here, require pushing the limits of the gel kinetic assay. In the “Appendix” (see accompanying paper (60Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)), we provide an analysis that extends the usefulness of the assay by allowing for multiple encounters between DNA polymerase and DNA. This important generalization facilitates measurements of high fidelities with or without proofreading or processivity proteins. E. coli DNA pol III proteins were purified as described: α, ε, and γ (21Studwell P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1171-1178Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); β (15Kong X.-P.

Enzyme reaction buffer contained 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 40 μg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 50 mm NaCl, and 8 mm MgCl2. T4 polynucleotide kinase was purchased from U. S. Biochemical Corp. or Amersham Corp. T4 DNA ligase was purchased from Promega. E. coli SSB was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Two 30-mer primers, one 80-mer, and two 100-mer templates were used. The primers were annealed to the middle of their templates with equal lengths (25 or 35 nucleotides) of single-stranded DNA overhang on each side. Both 30-mer primers, two 40-mers, and three 50-mers, which were the 3′- and 5′-half of 80-mer and 100-mer templates, respectively, were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems 392 DNA/RNA synthesizer. The 3′-half of a template was 5′-end-phosphorylated by ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase. The two halves were then annealed to the 30-mer primer and ligated to form the full template. Primers and templates were gel-purified. The sequences of the 30-mer primer/80-mer template were as follows. The sequences of the 30-mer primer/100-mer templates were as follows. G is the target site where misincorporation frequencies are measured. The next nucleotide downstream from the target G is either C or A. dNTP substrates were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. [γ-32P]ATP (4500 Ci/mmol) was purchased from ICN Radiochemicals. The primer was 5′-end-labeled with32P using T4 polynucleotide kinase in enzyme reaction buffer at 37 °C for 60 min. p/t DNA was annealed in enzyme reaction buffer using a ratio of 1 primer to 1.2 templates by heating to 90 °C and gradually cooling to room temperature. The concentration of p/t DNA after annealing was 100 nm (primer terminus). p/t DNA and ATP were incubated at 37 °C with different combinations of accessory proteins (β, γ complex) and SSB in 20 μl of enzyme reaction buffer containing 4% glycerol for 4 min; then, 10 μl of enzyme reaction buffer containing 4% glycerol, four dNTPs, and pol III core was added to start the reaction. Reactions were run for 3 min at 37 °C and quenched by adding 60 μl of 20 mm EDTA in 95% formamide (F/E) to the reaction mixture. Final concentrations in the reactions were 5 nm p/t, 5 nm pol III core, 167 μm ATP, 133 μm dATP, 133 μm dCTP, 133 μm dGTP, 133 μmdTTP, and the accessory proteins, if present, were 20 nmγ complex, 80 nm β2, 320 nmSSB. Primer extension reactions were carried out using pol III core, pol III holoenzyme, α subunit, and α holoenzyme. All reactions were carried out in a similar way. Time courses were run prior to kinetics experiments to determine conditions for measuring incorporation opposite a target site. Three solutions were made for measurements using pol III core in the presence of β, γ complex and SSB. Solution A contained 15 nm p/t, 60 nm γ complex, 240 nmβ2, 960 nm SSB, and 4% glycerol in enzyme reaction buffer. Solution B consisted of enzyme reaction buffer containing 0.5 mm ATP and varied concentrations of the dNTP to be incorporated opposite target site. Solution C contained 15 nm of pol III core, 150 μm running start dATP, and 4% glycerol in enzyme reaction buffer. The reaction was performed as follows: 5 μl of solution A was first mixed with 5 μl of solution B and incubated at 37 °C for 4 min to allow the γ complex to load β sliding clamp onto the DNA; then 5 μl of solution C was added to the A + B mixture to initiate the primer extension reaction. The concentrations in the final 15-μl reaction mixture were 5 nm p/t, 5 nm pol III core, 20 nmγ complex, 80 nm β2, 320 nmSSB, 167 μm ATP, 50 μm dATP, and varied concentrations of the dNTP to be incorporated opposite the target site. Reactions were run at 37 °C for 6 min for misincorporation opposite a target site. This constituted a multiple completed hit (MCH) condition in which about 50% of the primers were used (see the “Appendix” (60Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). For correct incorporation opposite the target site, 3 nm pol III core was present in solution C to give 1 nm in the final reaction, and the reactions were run for 1 min at 37 °C, creating single completed hit (SCH) conditions, in which about 10% of the primers were utilized. Reactions were quenched by adding 30 μl of F/E to the reaction mixture. The samples were heated to 100 °C for 6 min, placed on ice for 3 min, then loaded on a 16% polyacrylamide denaturing gel. The gel was run at 2000 V for 3 h to separate reaction products. Primer extension reactions by α subunit in the presence of β, γ complex and SSB were carried out similarly using 8 nm α subunit instead of pol III core polymerase in 6 min reactions for misincorporation (MCH conditions, 50% of primers used) and 2 nm α subunit in 1 min reactions for correct incorporation opposite the target site (SCH conditions, 10% of primers used). Primer extension by α subunit or pol III core without accessory proteins were done with 8 nm α subunit or 5 nm of pol III core for misincorporation and 1 nm α subunit or 0.5 nm of pol III core for correct incorporation opposite the target. Also, ATP was omitted from solution C, and the incubation of the A + B mixture was reduced to 1 min. Reactions by α subunit and by pol III core were run for 30 min for misincorporation (MCH condition) and 1 min for correct incorporation (SCH condition). 30-Min reactions utilized about 90% of the primers, while 1-min reactions utilized 10% of the primers. Experiments were identical to primer extension reactions with core holoenzyme, except that the concentration of rescue nucleotide, dCTP, was 3-fold greater in solution C than its final concentration in the assay. Misincorporation and correct incorporation reactions were both carried out with 5 nm pol III core and were run for 6 min (MCH condition, 50% of primers used). Misincorporation of the running start nucleotide, dAMP, opposite the target site and beyond was not detected for concentrations up to 100 μm dATP, in the absence of other nucleotides. A gel fidelity analysis, outlined in Fig.1, was used to determine the kinetics of incorporation of each of the four dNTPs opposite the target site as a function of dNTP concentration (20Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Integrated polyacrylamide gel band intensities were measured on a PhosphorImager using ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). The nucleotide incorporation rate opposite a target site, in either the presence or absence of proofreading exonuclease activity, can be obtained by measuring I T Σ/I T−1, where I T Σ is the integrated gel band intensities of primers extended to the target site and beyond, and I T−1 is the integrated gel band intensity of primers extended to the site just prior to the target site (20Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A plot of the relative incorporation rate, I T Σ/I T−1 as a function of dNTP substrate concentration results in a rectangular hyperbola whose slope in the initial linear region is the apparentV max/K m . ApparentK m and relative V max values (20Creighton S. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4759-4774Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 26Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 14689-14696Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were obtained using a least squares fit to the rectangular hyperbola. The relative V max value is equal to the maximum value of I T Σ/I T−1 . In reactions where misincorporation opposite the target site was relatively inefficient, plots of I T Σ/I T−1 versus dNTP concentration showed little or no curvature, and apparent V max/K m values were obtained by a least squares fit of the data to a straight line. Apparent V max/K m values that were obtained under MCH conditions were corrected to SCH conditions (see the “Appendix” (60Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar)). The misincorporation efficiency,f inc, which is the inverse of the fidelity, is given by the ratio, finc=fidelity−1=(Vmax/Km)W(Vmax/Km)REquation 1 where the subscripts W and R refer to wrong and right incorporations, respectively. Measurement errors forV max/K m are ± 30% and for f inc are ± 40% (one S.D.). 2 nm 30-mer/100-mer DNA was preincubated for 3 min with 100 nm β2, 20 nm γ complex, 300 nm SSB in the presence of 1 mm ATP, and 0.4 mm dGTP, 0.4 mmdTTP, which are the nucleotides at the 3′-end of the primer. 10 nm pol III core was then added to the mixture to allow formation of pol III holoenzyme on the p/t DNA. Because dATP was not present, an idling reaction occurred in which dTMP and dGMP could be removed and then added back on to the 3′-end of the primer, preventing degradation of the 5′-32P-labeled primer. In a second tube, 500 nm unlabeled 30-mer/80-mer p/t DNA (trap DNA) was preincubated for 3 min with 4.5 μm β2, 1 μm γ complex, 10 μm SSB, 1 mmATP in the presence of 0.4 mm dGTP, 0.4 mmdTTP, and 0.6 mm dATP. The contents of the pol III holoenzyme (5 μl) and trap preincubation mixture (containing dATP) (10 μl) were then immediately combined, and four separate reactions were carried out in which 5 μl of dCTP of 1.6 mm, the nucleotide to be incorporated opposite the target G site, was added at delay times of 0, 10, 20, and 40 s. The reaction products were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the proportion of DNA extended beyond the target site was graphed as a function of delay time. A band at the T+2 site was caused by misincorporation at the target site and was not considered true extension, because its intensity was independent of whether dCTP was added (see Fig. 3 A). The same general procedure was used to measure pol III dissociation at the T−1 site for M13 DNA and a 30-mer/209-mer p/t DNA, where the 209-mer template was a restriction fragment of M13 DNA. The procedure was modified for the full-length circular M13 DNA as follows: an unlabeled primer (30-mer) was annealed to the M13 DNA downstream of the 32P-labeled primer to form a 60-nt gap; SSB was not present in the reaction and trap solutions. The effectiveness of the unlabeled 30-mer/80-mer DNA trap was demonstrated by adding pol III core plus β, γ complex, dNTPs and ATP first to the trap and then mixing with the radioactive labeled p/t DNA, followed by the delayed addition of dCTP. The trap was found to be effective over the entire length of the experiment, because negligible DNA synthesis (<1%) occurred on the labeled p/t DNA (data not shown). Utilization of multiple p/t DNA molecules by pol III (i.e.cycling) was assayed by measuring the increase in the fraction of primer DNA extended as a function of time. Time course reactions were carried out with 20 nm 30-mer/100-mer using two concentrations of pol III holoenzyme (1 and 3 nm) in the presence of all four dNTPs (each at 500 μm). The procedure used was the same as in the primer extension reaction (see above). A gel kinetic assay (26Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Three experimental criteria must be satisfied to measure the fidelity of a holoenzyme using this assay: (i) the holoenzyme must be processive on the p/t DNA used in the assay; (ii) primer extension bands attributable to the core enzyme (without processivity proteins) must be negligible compared with holoenzyme-catalyzed extension bands; (iii) primer extension bands attributable to the holoenzyme must arise either from SCH, in which an enzyme encounters a given p/t DNA at most once and then dissociates, or alternatively from MCH, in which enzymes encounter and dissociate from a given p/t DNA multiple times; primer extension bands caused by incompleted hits, arising if an enzyme remains bound at the primer-3′ terminus when the reaction is terminated, must be negligible. All three criteria are satisfied in our system, as demonstrated in the next two subsections. A detailed mathematical analysis of the effects of SCH and MCH on the fidelity measurements is given in the “Appendix” (60Fygenson D.K. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 27931-27935Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). On large DNA templates, such as φX and M13, pol III core polymerase typically incorporates between 10 and 20 nucleotides per binding event (16Fay P.J. Johanson K.O. McHenry C.S. Bambara R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 976-983Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), while pol III core plus β and γ complex (pol III holoenzyme) incorporates more than 5000 nucleotides per binding event (8Maki S. Kornberg A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6561-6569Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Stukenberg P.T. Studwell-Vaughan P.S. O'Donnell M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11328-11334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This difference implies that the processivity proteins (β, γ complex) increase the time pol III core remains bound to p/t DNA by 2 to 3 orders of magnitude. We have recently shown that a DNA template as small as 80 nucleotides in length, annealed to a 30-mer primer, supports processive synthesis by pol III holoenzyme in the presence of SSB (29Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The SSB protein, although useful in eliminating secondary structure that can cause polymerase pausing, is generally not required for processive synthesis on long, closed circular DNAs such as bacteriophage φX or M13. In our 30-mer/100-mer or 30-mer/80-mer (29Bloom L.B. Turner J. Kelman Z. Beechem J.M. O'Donnell M. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30699-30708Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) constructs, however, SSB is required, perhaps to prevent the β clamp from sliding off the end of the template before it has had time to associate with a polymerase molecule. Fig. 2 illustrates the requirements for processive synthesis in our systems. Synthesis by pol III core is essentially nonprocessive on the 30-mer/100-mer p/t DNA (Fig. 2,lane 9). The addition of β or γ complex, alone or together, has little effect; the enzyme still fails to reach the end of the template strand and dissociation bands are evident at each template position (Fig. 2, lanes 6–8). SSB alone strongly inhibits core polymerase, even in the presence of either β or γ complex (Fig. 2, lanes 3–5). However, when β, γ complex and SSB are all present in the reaction, synthesis proceeds processively, reaching the end of the 100-mer template (Fig. 2, lane 2). Note that dissociation bands characteristic of the core enzyme (Fig. 2,lanes 6–9) are strongly attenuated during holoenzyme synthesis in the presence of SSB (Fig. 2, lane 2). The α subunit lacks the ε proofreading 3′-exonuclease of pol III core and is lower in polymerase activity than pol III core, but its requirements for processive synthesis are similar. On its own, it cannot replicate to the end of the 100-mer template (Fig. 2, lane 11) but in the presence of β, γ complex and SSB it becomes much more processive (Fig. 2, lane 10). Despite their high processivity, the pol III and α holoenzymes eventually dissociate from p/t DNA. We measured the lifetime of pol III holoenzyme on p/t DNA using three different templates: a 100-mer, a 209-nt restriction fragment of M13 DNA, and full-length circular M13 DNA. Pol III holoenzyme was loaded onto a labeled p/t DNA in the presence of dGTP and dTTP allowing the polymerase to idle. Next, dATP was added along with a large excess of unlabeled trap DNA, and the reaction was allowed to incubate for varying “delay” times before addition of dCTP allowed processive synthesis. For each p/t DNA, the fraction of extended primer decreased with increasing delay times, exhibiting a good fit to an exponential decay (Fig. 3 A). The lifetimes (t½ values) of the pol III-β-p/t complexes are 4.7 s for the 100-mer, 25 s for the 209-nt M13 fragment, and 46 s for the full-length M13 DNA (Fig. 3 A). Cycling of pol III holoenzyme is apparent from the level of primer utilization over time. In the extreme, if enzymes fail to dissociate from p/t DNA, the fraction of extended primers would saturate at the pol/DNA ratio. We measured an exponen"

Preparation of recombinant rat Bcl-xL yielded two forms, one deamidated at -Asn-Gly- sequences to produce isoaspartates and the other not deamidated. The crystal structures of the two forms show that they both adopt an essentially identical backbone structure which resembles the fold of human Bcl-xL: three layers of two α-helices each, capped at one end by two short helices. Both forms have a long disordered region, which contains the potential deamidation sites. The molecular structure exhibits a low level of interhelical interactions, the presence of three cavities, and a notable hydrophobic cleft surrounded by walls rich in basic residues. These unique structural features may be favorable for its accommodation into membranes or for possible rearrangement to modulate homo-/heterodimerization. Homology modeling of Bcl-2 and Bax, based on the Bcl-xL structure, suggests that Bax has the strongest potential for membrane insertion.

Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL share four conserved regions termed BH1, BH2, BH3, and BH4, and other Bcl-2 family members possess one or more of these regions (15Yin X.M. Oltvai Z.N. Korsmeyer S.J.

Korsmeyer S.J. Nature. 1994; 369: 321-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (1212) Google Scholar) proposed a hypothesis that Bcl-2 indirectly represses apoptosis through the heterodimerization with Bax to antagonize it. An NMR study revealed the molecular basis for heterodimer formation of Bcl-xL with the peptides derived from Bak (24Sattler M Liang H. Nettesheim D. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Eberstadt M. Yoon H.S. Shuker S.B. Chang B.S. Minn A.J. Thompson C.B. Fesik S.W. Science. 1997; 275: 983-986Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar), whereas mutational analyses showed that the heterodimerization with Bax is not necessarily required for the anti-apoptotic activity of Bcl-xL (25Cheng E.H.

Furthermore, it has been shown that both Bcl-xL and its Caenorhabditis elegans homologue CED-9 bind to CED-4 (21Spector M.S. Desnoyers S. Hoeppner D.J. Hengartner M.O.

Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 578-591Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar, 28Steller H. Science. 1995; 267: 1445-1449Crossref PubMed Scopus (2419) Google Scholar). Recently, Muchmore et al. have reported the three-dimensional structure of human Bcl-xL, and they concluded from the analogy to channel forming proteins, such as the diphtheria toxin, that Bcl-xL also may have an ion channel forming ability (29Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Actually, it has been reported that Bcl-xL can form an ion channel in synthetic lipid membranes (30Minn A.J. Velez P. Schendel S.L. Liang H. Muchmore S.W. Fesik S.W. Fill M. Thompson C.B. Nature. 1997; 385: 353-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (717) Google Scholar). Thus, the channel formation by Bcl-2 family proteins appears to be another possible mechanism for apoptosis regulation. However, the structure of human Bcl-xL has been solved using the sample prepared through denaturing and refolding processes (29Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is important to confirm whether or not a homologous protein more mildly prepared shows a similar conformation to that reported previously. Using the multiple isomorphous replacement method, we have independently determined the 2.5-Å resolution crystal structure of a recombinant rat Bcl-xL soluble region, which was prepared without denaturing and refolding. It was already established that asparagine residues in the conformationally flexible peptides, especially at the sequence of -Asn-Gly-, are frequently deamidated through a succinimide intermediate formation to yield a mixture of aspartate and isoaspartate (backbone peptide bonds were linked through the side chain β-carboxyl group of Asp) residues (31Meinwald Y.C. Stimson E.R. Scheraga H.A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 28: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In this report, we demonstrate that rat Bcl-xL indeed can be post-translationally modified by such deamidation, which is facilitated by denaturing process. In addition, homology modeling on the basis of the present crystal structure allowed us to expand the channel formation ability to discussion including the other Bcl-2 family members. cDNA clones for the ratbcl-x L gene were isolated as reported before (11Shiraiwa N. Inohara N. Okada S. Yuzaki M. Shoji S. Ohta S. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13258-13265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The DNA fragment encoding the soluble region from Met1 to Gly196 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and was introduced into the NcoI andHindIII site of the expression vector pAR2154 (a kind gift from Prof. Y. Nishimura, Yokohama City University), under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The plasmid was transfected intoEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) by electroporation. The transfectant was grown in LB medium containing a high concentration of ampicillin (200 mg/liter) at 1.0 OD600 and the Bcl-xL protein was overexpressed by adding isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to 0.4 mm, followed by continuous culture at 37 °C for 12 h with a vigorous shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication in a lysis buffer containing 50 mm potassium phosphate, 125 mm potassium chloride, 1 mm EDTA, 25% (v/v) glycerol, 5 mmβ-mercaptoethanol, 0.2% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, and 0.1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, at pH 6.0. The crude extract was clarified by centrifugation at 140,000 × g for 10 min. Solid fine ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to adjust the concentration to 1 m and the resulting precipitate was again removed by centrifugation. Then, the protein fraction containing the expressed Bcl-xL was applied to a hydrophobic column (butyl-Toyopearl, Tosoh) and developed with a linear gradient from 0.5 to 0 m ammonium sulfate. After a step of ultrafiltration, the concentrated sample of Bcl-xL was purified by gel filtration chromatography (Superdex 200, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Furthermore, anion exchange column (Mono Q, Pharmacia) chromatography was employed to separate the two forms, designated as Bcl-xL(A) and Bcl-xL(B). The amount of isoaspartate in proteins or peptides was measured by the ISOQUANTTM protein deamidation detection kit (Promega). Lysylendopeptidase (Wako Pure Chemical) digested peptides were prepared by treatment with 2% (w/w) enzyme at 37 °C for 16 h, and were fractionated by reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (CosmosilTM5C18, Nacalai tesque). N-terminal amino acid sequences were analyzed with a peptide sequencer (model 492A, Applied Biosystems).

The positive ion was detected in a linear mode. Metal ions (Ca2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Fe2+,3+, Ni2+, and Al3+) were measured using a Zeeman atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Z-8270, Hitachi) with a graphite furnace. Crystals were grown at 20 °C, by the vapor diffusion method in hanging drops containing 10 μl of 7 mg/ml Bcl-xL(B) in 50 mm MES, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.7m Na2SO4 at pH 5.6. The reservoir solution contained 100 mm MES, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, and 1.4 mNa2SO4 at pH 5.6. Oily precipitation appeared within 1 day, and the crystals grew slowly over 3 to 5 days. For the Bcl-xL(A) protein, 1.5 mNa2SO4 was required for crystallization. Before data collection, the crystals were transferred to a harvest buffer containing 1.5 m Na2SO4, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 100 mm MES at pH 5.6. We were unable to crystallize either form using polyethylene glycol 4,000 as a precipitant at pH 7.4, although it was successfully used to produce human Bcl-xL crystals (29Muchmore S.W. Sattler M.

Intensity data were collected using either an automated oscillation camera system (DIP-100, DIP-2030, MAC Science) with CuKα radiation, generated by a rotating anode M18X (Mac Science), or the macromolecular-oriented Weissenberg camera (35Sakabe N.

A. 1991; 303: 448-463Crossref Scopus (320) Google Scholar) installed on beamline BL-6A at the Photon Factory of the National Laboratory for High Energy Physics, Tsukuba, Japan. Diffraction data processing was performed with the use of DENZO and SCALEPACK programs (36Otwinoski Z. An Oscillation Data Processing Suite for Macromolecular Crystallography. Yale University, New Haven1992Google Scholar). All of the diffraction experiments were performed at room temperature. Two heavy atom derivatives of Bcl-xL(B) were prepared by soaking the crystals in the harvest buffer lacking dithiothreitol and containing either 5 mm K2PtCl4 or 1 mm EMTS for 1 day. Heavy atom parameters were refined, and the phase calculations were carried out using the MLPHARE (37CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project No. (4) SERC Daresbury Laboratory Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) program. The multiple isomorphous replacement phases were calculated to 2.8-Å resolution and were improved using either the DM (37CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project No. (4) SERC Daresbury Laboratory Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) or the SOLOMON (37CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project No. (4) SERC Daresbury Laboratory Acta Crystallogr. Sect.

The X-FIT program in QUANTA (Molecular Simulations Inc.) was used to identify the major α-helices in the solvent-flattened electron density map. The phases calculated from the initial structure were combined with the multiple isomorphous replacement phase at 50 to 2.8-Å resolution using SIGMAA (37CCP4: Collaborative Computational Project No. (4) SERC Daresbury Laboratory Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D. 1994; 50: 760-763Crossref PubMed Scopus (19668) Google Scholar) and REFMAC (38Murshudov G.N. Dodson E.J. Proceedings of the CCP4 Study Weekend.

X-PLOR Manual (version 3.1). Yale University, New Haven1992Google Scholar) and REFMAC programs. The iterative use of both programs was essential to accomplish the refinement. The final model of Bcl-xL(B), including 145 residues (Ser2-Val30, Ile81-Gly196) and 51 water molecules, was refined to a crystallographic R-factor of 22.2% (R-free factor = 27.3%), using all reflections between 20.0- and 2.5-Å resolution, by the REFMAC program. The crystal structure of Bcl-xL(A) was initially solved using the rigid-body refinement in the X-PLOR program with Bcl-xL(B) as a starting model, and was refined at 20.0 to 2.8-Å resolution by the X-PLOR and REFMAC programs. The quality of the structure was assessed using the PROCHECK (40Laskowski R.A. MacArthur M.W. Moss D.S. Thornton J.M. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 282-291Crossref Google Scholar) program.

The recombinant rat Bcl-xL protein eluted in two separate fractions by anion exchange column chromatography (Fig. 1 a). These two proteins showed significantly different migrations by SDS-PAGE analysis (Fig. 1 b). However, sequence analysis revealed that both proteins have the same N-terminal sequence, in which the first formylmethionine is processed out by an endogenous E. coli enzyme (41Hirel P.H. Schmitter M.J. Dessen P. Fayat G. Blanquet S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 8247-8251Crossref PubMed Scopus (660) Google Scholar). In addition, the molecular mass analysis by MALDI-TOF MS revealed nearly identical values of 21,936 ± 4 Da and 21,938 ± 2 Da for the peak A and B proteins, respectively; they agree well with the calculated molecular mass of 21,932 Da for the soluble portion of rat Bcl-xL(Ser2-Gly196). Analysis by Zeeman atomic absorption spectrometry failed to detect any particular metals bound to either of the proteins, implying that the difference cannot be ascribed to the chelation of metals. Circular dichroism measurements revealed identical helical contents (data not shown). Thus, the two forms of rat Bcl-xL appear to have somewhat different electrostatic properties, although they are identical in their primary and secondary structures. We designated these two forms as Bcl-xL(A) and Bcl-xL(B), respectively. The rat Bcl-xL protein contains three -Asn-Gly- sequences, which are susceptible to asparagine deamidation (31Meinwald Y.C. Stimson E.R. Scheraga H.A. Int. J. Pept. Protein Res. 1986; 28: 79-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 32Geiger T. Clarke S. J. Biol.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 6164-6170Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The deamidated asparagine then spontaneously converts to either isoaspartate or aspartate. We analyzed the isoaspartate contents in the two forms (TableII); Bcl-xL(B) contained 0.4 mol of isoaspartate/mol of protein, while no isoaspartates were detected in Bcl-xL(A). On the premise that the anion exchange chromatography initially separated the unmodified protein and the deamidated protein into peaks A and B, respectively, the Bcl-xL(B) sample is a mixture of isoaspartate and aspartate forms at one or more of the potential deamidation sites. Bcl-xL(A) is not modified and contains asparagine residues at each site.Table IIIsoaspartate contents of rat Bcl-xLBcl-xL(A) (mol/mol)2-aThe isoaspartate contents are expressed as the ratio of moles of isoaspartate per mol of sample.

Open table in a new tab To clarify the deamidation site(s), the lysylendopeptidase-digested fragments separated by high performance liquid chromatography were analyzed. In Bcl-xL(B), isoaspartate was found only on the Gly21-Lys87 fragment, which contains two possible deamidation sites (Asn52 and Asn66); no isoaspartate was detected within the fragment containing the third potential deamidation site (Asn185). However, the present analyses cannot determine which or if both residue(s) (Asn52 and/or Asn66) was deamidated. Furthermore, the denaturation treatment caused additional deamidation at both Gly21-Lys87 and Glu158-Gly196 fragments, suggesting that all the three -Asn-Gly- sites (Asn52, Asn66, and Asn185) were deamidated (Table II). Crystals of both forms were grown from sodium sulfate solutions by the hanging-drop method. Rat Bcl-xL(A) crystals were usually twinned or clustered, while Bcl-xL(B) reproducibly formed single crystals that diffracted beyond 2.5-Å resolution. The intensity distributions are significantly different between the two forms;R iso for the F data in 45 to 2.8-Å resolution was 13%. Both of the diffraction patterns exhibit thermal diffuse scattering and notably large overall temperature factors (64.0 Å2 for Bcl-xL(A), 55.6 Å2 for Bcl-xL(B)), indicating a high content of disordered regions. The ribbon drawing of the rat Bcl-xL(B) molecule is shown in Fig.2, where we designate the “top” and the “bottom” of the molecule. Bcl-xL(B) consists of eight α-helices that form a three-layered all α structure which is similar to those of diphtheria toxin and colicin as originally pointed out by Muchmore et al. (29Muchmore S.W. Sattler M. Liang H. Meadows R.P. Harlan J.E. Yoon H.S. Nettesheim D. Chang B.S. Thompson C.B. Wong S.L. Ng S.C. Fesik S.W. Nature. 1996; 381: 335-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (1277) Google Scholar). The two central α-helices, α5 and α6, are sandwiched between the two layered structures, which consist of the α1 and α2 helices on one side and the α3 and α4 helices on the other side. Two α helices, α6 and α7, appear to be split from a longer helix by a sharp kink. The C-terminal helices, α7 and α8, are located at the top of the molecule, and they are connected by a turn with the invariant sequence -Asn-Gly-Gly-Trp-. Helices α1 and α2 are connected by a long disordered region between Glu31 and Val80. A definitive model for this region could not be built, because of the weak and fragmented electron densities arising from structural disorder in the crystal. The deamidation site(s) of Bcl-xL(B) is/are located within this disordered region. The overall structure of Bcl-xL(A) were essentially identical to that of Bcl-xL(B); the root mean square deviations between the two models are 0.50 and 0.98 Å for main chain atoms and for all non-hydrogen atoms, respectively. However, notable conformational differences were observed at the loop region connecting α2 and α3 and both ends of the disordered region. In addition, the analysis of superposition between the two molecules by LSQKAB (37CCP4:"

However, the role of sphingomyelinase in UV-induced c-June N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation is still unclear. Thus, we investigated this issue directly using a genetic SMase-deficient (2 ∼3% residual acid SMase activity) lymphoblast cell line, MS1418. The results showed that while UV irradiation markedly induces JNK activation in a normal human lymphoblast cell line, JY, it induces only weak JNK activation in MS1418 cells. This difference of JNK response to UV irradiation between these two cell lines was further observed in time course and dose-response studies. In contrast, 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate-induced JNK activation could be observed in both JY and MS1418 cells. Furthermore, significant JNK activation can be observed in MS1418 cells by exposure of the cells to SMase or C2-ceramide, whereas phospholipase A2 or phospholipase C did not show significant induction of JNK activity, and C2-dihydroceramide and sphingosine induce only much weaker JNK activation in MS1418 cells than that by C2-ceramide. These data demonstrated that SMase plays an essential role in UV-induced JNK activation.

Previous studies indicated that exposure of cells to UV light rapidly activates Src-family tyrosine kinase, followed by activation of the Ha-Ras, the cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinase Raf-1 as well as c-Jun, an important component of AP-1 (8Devary Y.

Since c-Src and Ha-Ras are involved in the UV-induced signal transduction pathway, the primary signal generated by UV must be initiated from upstream of Ras/Raf. Therefore, it was assumed that the signaling cascade leading to the activation of AP-1 by UV is generated from the plasma membrane (10Karin M. Hunter T. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar). Very recently, we demonstrated that atypical PKC (aPKC) is required for UV-induced AP-1 activation by using both a mouse PKC-ζ antisense and a dominant negative mutant construct of Xenopus PKC-λ/ι (6Huang C.S.

Although the upstream effector of aPKC in the UV signal transduction cascade is not clear, some lipids or their metabolites, such as phosphatidic acid and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-P3, are believed to be responsible for the activation of aPKC (11Dominguez I.

Based on this evidence and the results from different groups indicating that addition of exogenous ceramides to cells induces JNK activation (24Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S.

All the cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. Confluent monolayers of JB6 P1–1+ were trypsinized, and 8 × 103 viable cells suspended in 100 μl of 5% FBS MEM were added into each well of a 96-well plate. Plates were incubated at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. Twelve to twenty-four hours later, cells were starved by culturing cells in 0.1% FBS MEM for 12 h, and then exposed to UV, C2-ceramide, or SMase for AP-1 induction for 24 h. Since the normal UVB lamp also generates a small amount of UVC light, the UVB irradiation was carried out in a UVB exposure chamber fitted with a Kodak Kodacel K6808® filter that eliminates all wavelengths below 290 nm.

Dong Z. Int. J. Oncol. 1996; 8: 389-393PubMed Google Scholar). JNK assay was carried out as described by protocol of New England Biolabs. In brief, JB6 C141 cells or lymphoblasts JY or MS1418 cells were starved for 24 h in 0.1% FBS MEM or 0.5% FBS mixture of RPMI 1640 and DMEM at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator. The cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and were exposed to UVB with K6808® filter, UVC, TPA, C2-ceramide, and SMase at the concentrations and for the times indicated in the figure legends. Then, the cells were washed once with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 300 μl of lysis buffer per sample (20 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mg/ml leupeptin). The lysates were sonicated and centrifuged, and the supernatant was incubated with 2 μg of N-terminal c-Jun (1–89) fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose beads overnight at 4 °C. The beads were washed twice with 500 μl of lysis buffer with phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride and twice with 500 μl of kinase buffer (25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 5 mm β-glycerolphosphate, 2 mmdithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 10 mm MgCl2). The kinase reactions were carried out in the presence of 100 μm of ATP at 30 °C for 30 min. C-Jun phosphorylation is selectively measured by Western immunoblotting using a chemiluminescent detection system and specific c-Jun antibodies against phosphorylation of c-Jun at serine 63. Previous work indicated that UV irradiation induces both activation of transcription factor AP-1 and a rapid increase of ceramide (6Huang C.S. Ma W.-Y. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol.

Therefore, we proposed that SMase and its product are involved in UV-induced AP-1 activation. To test this hypothesis, we exposed P1–1+ cells, a stable AP-1 luciferase transfectant of epidermal JB6 cells, to UV irradiation, SMase, or cell-permeable synthetic C2-ceramide for AP-1 induction. The results showed that, in addition to UV irradiation, both SMase and C2-ceramide induced the transactivation of AP-1 activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig.1), whereas sphingosine, a metabolite of ceramide, did not induce AP-1 activity (Fig. 1). We further measured the JNK activation of JB6 cells exposed to these agents. Significant JNK activations were observed in cells exposed to UV irradiation or stimulated by either SMase or C2-ceramide (Fig.2).Figure 2JNK activation by UV irradiation, SMase, or C2-ceramide in JB6 cells. JB6 Cl 41 were cultured in monolayers in 100 mm-diameter dishes until to 90% confluent. The cells were starved by changing the medium with 0.1% FBS MEM for 24∼-48 h. Then, the cells were or were not exposed toA, UVB (3 kJ/m2 with filter) UVC (60 J/m2) and cultured at 37 °C for 30 min; B, different concentration of C2-ceramide for 10 min or SMase for 30 min; or C, C2-ceramide (20 μm) or SMase (0.5 unit/ml) for the time as indicated. The cells were harvested, and JNK activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To examine the role of SMase in UV-induced JNK activation directly, we compared the activation of JNK by UV irradiation between EBV-transformed normal human lymphoblast cell line, JY, and EBV-transformed SMase-deficient (2∼3% residual acid SMase activity) lymphoblast cell line, MS1418. The results are shown in Fig.3. UV irradiation markedly induced JNK activation in normal human lymphoblast, JY, while only very weak JNK activation was found in MS1418, a SMase-deficient lymphoblast cell line. In contrast, similar levels of TPA-induced JNK activation were observed in both JY cells and MS1418 cells (Fig. 3). The results from time course and dose-response studies are consistent with these findings (Fig. 4). These results strongly suggest that SMase is involved in the UV-induced JNK activation pathway.Figure 4Comparison of JNK activation induced by UV irradiation between JY and MS1418 cells by time course and dose response studies. Normal lymphoblasts, JY, or SMase-deficient lymphoblasts MS1418 were starved for 48 h in 0.5% FBS mixture of RPMI 1640 and DMEM at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator. The cells were washed once with culture medium, then the cells (5 × 106/sample) were or were not exposed toA, UVB (2 kJ/m2 with filter) or UVC (30 J/m2) and cultured for the time as indicated andB, different doses of UVB or UVC as indicated, and cultured for 30 min. The cells were harvested, and JNK activity was measured as described under “Experimental Procedures.”View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further demonstrate a role for SMase in JNK activation, we investigated the effect of SMase and C2-ceramide on JNK activation in MS1418 cells. Addition of exogenous SMase directly into the culture medium caused activation of JNK in both JY and MS1418 cells (Fig. 5). Furthermore, exposure of MS1418 cells to C2-ceramide also caused activation of JNK (Fig. 5). In contrast, PLA2 or PLC did not show significant induction of JNK activity, and C2-Dhc (an inactive form of ceramide) or sphingosine (a metabolic of ceramide) induces only very weak JNK activation in MS1418 cells (Fig. 6). These data are consistent with previous reports that C2-Dhc slightly induces JNK activation in U937 cells (Fig. 3 of Ref. 24). These experiments support the model that the defects of UV-induced JNK activation in MS1418 cells is due to its deficiency of SMase.Figure 6No induction of JNK activity by PLA2 or PLC, and little activation of JNK activity by C2-Dhc or sphingosine. JY cells or MS1418 cells were starved for 48 h in 0.5% FBS mixture of RPMI 1640 and DMEM at 37 °C, 5% CO2 atmosphere incubator.

Verheij et al. (24Verheij M. Bose R. Lin X.H. Yao B. Jarvis W.D. Grant S. Birrer M.J. Szabo E. Zon L.I. Kyriakis J.M. Haimovitz-Friedman A. Fuks Z. Kolesnick R.N. Nature. 1996; 380: 75-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (1707) Google Scholar) reported that UVC or x-ray irradiation lead to an increase of ceramide production in exposed cells, and exogenous ceramide could induce activation of both Erks and JNKs. However, it is not clear whether ceramide and SMase are required for UV-induced activation of a signal transduction pathway. In this study, we addressed this issue by using a genetic SMase-deficient lymphoblast. While UV irradiation induces a high level of JNK activity in normal human lymphoblasts, it induces little JNK activation in MS1418 cells, SMase-deficient human lymphoblasts. In contrast, TPA induces activation of JNK in both JY and MS1418 cells. Moreover, significant JNK activation is observed in MS1418 lymphoblasts by exposure of cells to exogenous SMase or C2-ceramide. In a JB6 mouse epidermal cell line, SMase and C2-ceramide also induce the activation of JNK and transcription factor AP-1. All this evidence demonstrated that SMase plays an essential role in UV-induced signal transduction. Sphingomyelin is preferentially localized in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane of most mammalian cells (19Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). It is comprised of a long chain sphingosine backbone, a fatty acid, and a phosphocholine head group (19Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). The activation of SMase results in the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to yield ceramide and phosphocholine (27Kolesnick R.N. Prog. Lipid Res. 1991; 30: 1-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). It has long been known that a number of extracellular stimulators can lead to activation of SMase. These stimulators include UV or ionizing irradiation, heat shock, nerve growth factor, TNF-α, endotoxin, interferon-γ, interleukin-1, Fas, and CD28 (17Hannun Y.A. Science. 1996; 274: 1855-1859Crossref PubMed Scopus (1483) Google Scholar, 22Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3125-3128Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Kolesnick R. Golde D.W.

Some evidence revealed involvement of sphingolipids in signaling transduction pathways that are associated with the regulation of cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis (17Hannun Y.A.

Synthetic ceramide mimicked vitamin D3 in inducing monocytic differentiation in HL60 cells (22Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

TNF-α induced apoptosis in a number of cellular models, including U937 monocytic cells, HL60 cells, and L929 fibrosarcoma cells. TNF-α also induced rapid sphingomyelin hydrolysis to ceramide. Further, synthetic ceramide analogs and sphingomyelinase mimicked the action of TNF-α in the initiation of apoptosis (19Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar, 28Hannun Y.A. Bell R.M. Adv. Lipid Res. 1993; 25: 27-41PubMed Google Scholar,29Obeid L.M. Linardic C.M. Karolad L.A. Hannun Y.A. Science. 1993; 259: 1769-1771Crossref PubMed Scopus (1585) Google Scholar). All of these experiments involving the role of ceramide rely largely on intact cells and their exposure to permeable ceramides (18Testi R. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 468-471Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Although it has been reported that ceramide activates the Erks and JNKs and that UV irradiation causes the increase of ceramide, it is still not clear whether SMase and its product, ceramide, play a role in UV-induced JNK activation and the transactivation of AP-1. In the present study, we found that UV irradiation, SMase, or C2-ceramide induces JNK activation and transactivation of AP-1 activity in the JB6 cell system. In the lymphoblast cell system, marked UV-induced JNK activation is observed in a normal human lymphoblast, JY, but only a little activation of JNK in MS1418, a SMase- deficient (2 ∼3% residual acid SMase activity) lymphoblast cell line. Moreover, exposure of cells to SMase or C2-ceramide leads to significant JNK activation in either JY cells or MS1418 cells. These data suggest that the lack of response of MS1418 cells to UV irradiation in terms of JNK activation is due to its deficiency of SMase, but not the downstream location of SMase. Thus, we provide direct evidence that SMase and its products play an essential role in UV-induced JNK activation. The little activation of JNK activity in MS1418 cells induced by UV irradiation may be due to the response of cells through the 2 ∼3% residual acid SMase activity. The use of cell-permeable ceramide has shown that different serine/threonine protein kinase cascades, as well as protein phosphatases, are activated. A ceramide-activated protein kinase can phosphorylate Raf-1, which in turn activates the Erk2 (30Yao B. Zhang Y. Delikat S. Basu S. Kolesnick R. Nature. 1995; 378: 307-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar). Ceramide might also act as an upstream activator of Ras (31Gubins E. Coggeshall K.M. Langlet C. Baier G. Bonnefoy-Berard M. Bum P. Wittinghofer A. Katzav S. Altman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 906-913Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). In stress-response kinase cascades, ceramide activates the JNKs possibly through stress-activated protein kinase/Erk kinase (4Devary Y. Gottlieb R.A. Lau L.F. Karin M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 2804-2811Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar, 32Westwick J.K. Bielawska A.E. Dbaibo G. Hannun Y.A. Brenner D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 22689-22692Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). It has been suggested that ceramide induces the activation of a signal transduction pathway leading to activation of nuclear factor κ B by activation of PKC-ζ (16Lozanó J. Berra E. Municio M.M. Diaz-Meco M.T. Dominguez I. Sanz L. Moscat J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19200-19202Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the direct target of ceramide is not known at present. The direct target of ceramide should be activated by ceramidein vitro, and it should mediate most of the biological effects of ceramide in cells. Our previous studies demonstrated that aPKCs are required for UV-induced AP-1 activation (6Huang C.S. Ma W.-Y. Bowden G.T. Dong Z. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31262-31268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 7Huang C.S. Ma W.-Y. Dong Z. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1945-1954Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Since UV responses are believed to be initiated from the plasma membrane (10Karin M. Hunter T. Current Biol. 1995; 5: 747-757Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (656) Google Scholar), sphingomyelin hydrolysis by sphingomyelinase and stimulation of ceramide-activated protein kinase likely also occur within the plasma membrane (19Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar). Taken together with the evidence that ceramide induces phosphorylation of PKC-ζ in cells and it activates the PKC-ζin vitro (19Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (901) Google Scholar), we speculate that the direct target of ceramide in UV-induced JNK and AP-1 activation may be aPKC. We thank Dr. H. H. O.

The histidine permease of Salmonella typhimurium and the maltose permease of Escherichia coli have been extensively characterized; both are good model systems for understanding the mechanism of action of this superfamily (5Shyamala V.

Academic Press, New York1990: 225-245Crossref Google Scholar). Our general approach toward understanding the mechanism of action of these transporters has been to purify and characterize biochemically (a) the intact complex, (b) the isolated nucleotide-binding subunit, HisP, and (c) a reassembled system in which the isolated nucleotide-binding subunit has been reconstituted into membrane vesicles and proteoliposomes containing only HisQ and HisM. Such an analysis will delineate the properties intrinsic to the individual subunits, relate them to those of the intact complex, and, in combination with the creation and analysis of mutant proteins, it will provide information of general use for understanding the mechanism of action of the traffic ATPases superfamily. In this article we present the purification and properties of the ATP-binding subunit of the histidine permease, HisP. HisP binds and hydrolyzes ATP and, presumably, is the subunit responsible for energizing the transport process. We show that HisP functions as a dimer and that under optimal conditions the rate at which it hydrolyzes ATP is comparable to that by the intact complex, HisQMP2. The properties of HisP are compared with those of the intact complex and of related subunits from other traffic ATPases. The construction of pFA351, a plasmid carrying the S. typhimurium hisP (His6) gene under the control of an IPTG-inducible T7 polymerase gene (13Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar), is described in the text. GA596, the E. coli strain containing plasmid pFA351 (freshly introduced by transformation) was grown at 30 °C until the culture reached anA 650 nm of 0.6. The slower growth at this temperature allows a higher percentage of HisP to remain in the soluble fraction. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 100 μm and growth continued for 2 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at −80 °C as a paste. In a typical preparation, 8 g of cells harvested from 4 liters of culture were defrosted, washed with 40 ml of 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.1, 1 mm MgCl2, resuspended in 40 ml of 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.1, and disrupted twice at 10,000 p.s.i. in a French press apparatus. After centrifugation for 10 min at 1,300 × g, ATP was added to a final concentration of 5 mm to the supernatant fraction (crude extract), which was then centrifuged in a TLA 100.4 rotor at 100,000 rpm for 30 min in a Beckman ultracentrifuge (the supernatant is the cytoplasmic fraction). The cytoplasmic fraction (35 ml) was applied to a column (Bio-Rad glass Econo column; 2.5 × 10 cm) prepared from 10 ml of a slurry of TALON metal affinity resin (CLONTECH) equilibrated with 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.1, 1 mmMgCl2, and gently shaken at 4 °C for 45 min. The column was allowed to drain (flow-through fraction) and washed with 40 ml of cold buffer A (50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.1, 100 mmNaCl, 5 mm ATP, 20% glycerol) and then with 20 ml of cold buffer A containing 6 mm imidazole. The resin was then transferred to a narrower column (1.5 × 13 cm) and eluted with 10 ml of buffer A containing 100 mm imidazole and 0.1 mm EDTA. Ten fractions (1.0 ml each) were collected and analyzed for protein content by the micro-BCA protein assay (14Wiechelman K. Braun R. Fitzpatrick J. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 175: 231-237Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar) (Pierce kit with bovine serum albumin as standard). Over 90% of the HisP retained was eluted within one or two fractions. If necessary, fractions were concentrated using an Amicon Centricon 10 centrifugal concentrator. Pure protein was aliquoted and stored in liquid nitrogen. A typical experiment yields 8–10 mg of pure HisP(his6). Whenever it was necessary to change the buffer, gel filtration through a PD-10 column (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) equilibrated with the desired buffer was used. Pure HisP(his6) (2.1 mg/ml; 200 μl) was injected onto an HPLC column (TOSOHAAS G3000SW, 7.8 mm × 30 cm) equilibrated with 50 mm MOPS, pH 7, 4% glycerol, 100 mm NaCl, with a flow rate of 1 ml/min; fractions (∼0.5 ml each) were collected and the protein content analyzed by the BCA assay and by SDS-PAGE. Carbonic anhydrase and bovine serum albumin (molecular masses, 29 and 66 kDa, Sigma) were used as molecular weight standards. ATPase activity was assayed essentially as described (7Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q.

Sixty μl of a HisP(his6) solution (final concentration: 0.7 mg/ml, 24 μm HisP(his6)) in assay buffer (60 mm MOPS, pH 7.0, 4% glycerol, 2 mm ATP, 0.1 mm EDTA) was equilibrated at 37 °C for 3 min, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 μl of 30 mmMgCl2 (final concentration: 1 mm). Samples (10 μl) were taken at appropriate times (every 20 s at high enzyme concentrations) and placed into microtiter plate wells containing 40 μl of 7.5% SDS. The amount of Pi liberated was determined by a colorimetric assay (15Chifflet S. Torriglia A. Chiesa R. Tolosa S. Anal. Biochem. 1988; 168: 1-4Crossref PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), using Na2HPO4 as a standard. HisP(his6) (150 μl, 6.8 mg/ml) was first applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (0.5 × 3.2 cm) equilibrated with 10 mm NaPi, pH 7.9, 10% glycerol, 30 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm ATP and eluted with the same buffer; 0.2-ml fractions were collected, and all of HisP(his6) appeared in two fractions, the first of which was used for the CD measurements, after dilution in the same buffer to a final concentration of 0.8 mg/ml. HisP(his6) prepared under these conditions stays in solution for several hours. The CD spectrum was determined at 25 °C using an AVIV 62DS spectropolarimeter, using a 0.01-cm path length cuvette. The final spectrum, representing an average of six scans, was corrected for the corresponding buffer and smoothed. Estimation of percentage of secondary structure was performed by unrestricted least squares fitting of the experimental spectrum to the sum of pure-component CD spectra characteristic of α-helical, β-sheet, turn, and non-regular structural elements (the LINCOMB algorithm (16Parczel A.

Phospholipids, various nucleotides, and ATPase inhibitors were obtained and prepared as described (7Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). To study the properties of HisP it is most convenient to have it in a soluble form. It had been established previously that a sizable portion of HisP overproduced in the absence of HisQ and HisM is located in the cytoplasmic fraction (9Kerppola R.E. Shyamala V. Klebba P. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 9857-9865Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Among several possible promoter systems, those producing large amounts of protein (such as the combined lambda PL/PR promoter) were discarded to avoid the risk of creating insoluble forms of HisP. Although inclusion bodies protein can be solubilized, e.g. by dissolving them in urea, and renatured (22Walter C. Honer zu Bentrup K. Schneider E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8863-8869Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), a more gentle purification process was deemed more appropriate for future crystallization attempts. Reliably moderate amounts of soluble protein can be produced using the chosen T7 promoter system (23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar) by controlling the induction time. A peptide extension containing leucine, glutamate, and six histidines ((His6) tail) was engineered into the carboxyl terminus of HisP. Plasmid pFA351 was constructed by introducing ahisP (His6)-containing DNA fragment obtained by polymerase chain reaction from pFA284 2Plasmid pFA284 carries the hisQ, hisM, and hisP (his6) genes under the temperature-sensitive control of the lambda PL promoter (strain GA500; laboratory strain collection). into theEcoRI/BamHI site of the PT7-5 vector (23Tabor S. Richardson C.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 1074-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (2459) Google Scholar), followed by transformation into E. coli strain BL21(DE3) which carries an IPTG-inducible T7 polymerase gene on the chromosome (13Studier F.W. Moffatt B.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 189: 113-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (4842) Google Scholar), resulting in final strain GA596. Fig. 1 (left) shows that strain GA596 produces large amounts of a protein upon induction with IPTG for 1 h (lanes 1 and 2); the amount increases with time of induction (lanes 2–4). This protein was identified as HisP(his6) by its cross-reaction with antibodies raised against HisP and by its size (slightly larger than that of HisP). HisP(his6) was shown to be physiologically indistinguishable from the wild type by its ability to transport d-histidine (a property completely dependent on a functional histidine permease (24Ames G.F.-L. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1964; 104: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar)), as shown in a strain producing HisP(his6), which transports as well as a strain that is identical except for carrying a wild type hisP gene (Fig. 1,right). Furthermore, when HisP(his6) is present in a complex with HisQ and HisM, and it displays the same in vitro ATPase activity as wild type HisQMP2 (7Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Thus, HisP(his6) is indistinguishable from HisP when associated with HisQ and HisM, both in vivo and in vitro, and is an appropriate candidate for further studies. The purification of HisP(his6) takes advantage of the metal-chelating properties of the (His6) tail. The procedure described under “Experimental Procedures” generally yields a final preparation that is over 95% pure, with a yield of about 50%. Fig.2 shows the results of a purification sequence. A crude extract (lane 2) contains high levels of HisP(his6), of which about 80% is in the cytoplasmic fraction (lanes 3 and 4), as judged by eye after SDS-PAGE and Coomassie Blue staining and by quantitation with antibodies against HisP in immunoblots of a similar SDS-PAGE resolution (data not shown). Upon application of the cytoplasmic fraction to a TALON column, most of the protein is not retained, together with a portion of HisP(his6) varying between 15 and 20% of the total cytoplasmic HisP(his6) (flow-through, lane 5). 3To exclude the possibility that this material did not stick to the column because of an overloading effect, it was reapplied to a new TALON column. None of it was retained. Therefore, it is assumed that this material has undergone some form of denaturation. With extensive washing, additional cytoplasmic protein is released together with a very small amount (about 4%) of HisP(his6) (lane 6). The elution buffer releases the bulk of HisP(his6)(lanes 7). 4A small amount of HisP(his6) (11%) is retained by the column after elution. TableI summarizes the quantitation of protein and HisP(his6) in the purification experiment shown in Fig.2. It can be seen that the yield is 48% after a 32-fold purification and HisP(his6) is estimated to be 96% pure.Table IPurification of HisP(His6)FractionTotal protein1-aDetermined using the BCA assay.HisP(His6)1-bQuantitated from an immunoblot using antibody raised against HisP and normalized against a standard curve of pure HisP(his6), the concentration of which had been determined by the BCA assay.

Open table in a new tab The purified HisP(his6) was found to be particularly inclined to precipitating, forming an insoluble white fluffy material that could not be redissolved by a variety of treatments, including numerous detergents. An eluate (2.2 mg/ml) from a TALON column in 2% glycerol, 0.5 mm ATP, 50 mm Tris/Cl, pH 8.1 buffer, 0.1 mm EDTA, 100 mm NaCl, and 100 mmimidazole starts precipitating within 2 h at 0 °C. Such a preparation was divided into aliquots, and one of the following detergents (1% final concentration) was added to each of them: Lubrol, Brij 35, Triton X-100, Tween 20, and sodium deoxycholate. After 5 days at 0 °C the samples were centrifuged, and the amount of HisP(his6) in the supernatant fraction was found to be 28, 40, 27, 29, and 54% of the total present, respectively, with 25% being present in the sample containing no detergent. Thus, none of these detergents is able to maintain HisP(his6) in solution at such a concentration. The precipitated HisP(his6) could be redissolved in 4 m urea (and found to be inactive, following a 10-fold dilution) or 2 m guanidine HCl. An SDS-PAGE analysis in the absence of β-mercaptoethanol showed that the insoluble form of HisP(his6), in contrast to the soluble form, has a mobility corresponding to that of dimeric HisP(his6), indicating the formation of a disulfide bond involving the single cysteine residue present in HisP (25Higgins C.F. Haag P.D. Nikaido K. Ardeshir F. Garcia G. Ames G.F.-L. Nature. 1982; 298: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). Several parameters were tested for improving the solubility of a crude extract in which about half of the HisP(his6) would precipitate upon storage at 0 °C for 5 days. Individually added ATP, ADP, and glycerol help somewhat to maintain solubility. Some detergents (0.5% n-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside or 0.4% CHAPS) improve the solubility if added in combination with ATP. A more thorough analysis performed on HisP(his6) after purification on the TALON column indicated that both 20% glycerol and 5 mm ATP are essential if the purified protein is present at concentrations higher than 2 mg/ml. In the procedure finally adopted, 5 mm ATP is added to the crude extract prior to ultracentrifugation and 5 mm ATP, 20% glycerol, and 0.1 mm EDTA are present in the elution buffer. Final storage conditions also include 5 mm ATP and 20% glycerol, which allow HisP(his6) to remain in solution up to at least 8.5 mg/ml and for at least 1 week at 4 °C. If ATP hydrolysis is allowed to proceed by the addition of Mg2+, HisP(his6)starts precipitating as the ATP becomes depleted. Thus, it appears that an ATP-liganded conformation of HisP(his6) is necessary to maintain solubility. Therefore, EDTA (0.1 mm) is also added to eliminate a slow, continuous hydrolysis of ATP during storage. 5However, exhaustive removal of Mg2+by the addition of EDTA in several column washing steps before elution with 100 mm imidazole results in the disappearance of HisP(his6) from all column fractions (presumably it precipitates within the column matrix). The activity and solubility of HisP(his6) at 5–10 mg/ml in storage buffer and in liquid nitrogen do not change for at least several months and can withstand repeated freezing and thawing. HisP is known to bind ATP (and other nucleotides), and it has been shown that the intact complex, HisQMP2, hydrolyzes ATP under a variety of conditions (7Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and it has an intrinsic, low level ATPase activity that is stimulated somewhat by unliganded HisJ and to a high level by liganded HisJ. It was proposed that HisQ and/or HisM normally constrain the ability of HisP to hydrolyze ATP and that signaling by liganded HisJ allows hydrolysis to proceed by relieving such a constraint (7Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). If this were true, isolated HisP should be able to hydrolyze ATP at a level considerably higher that the intrinsic activity of HisQMP2 in the absence of external stimuli. Fig.3 A (solid dots) shows that purified HisP(his6) indeed hydrolyzes ATP 6That this activity is due to HisP(his6) rather than to a contaminating ATPase is demonstrated by the fact that preparations obtained by an identical purification scheme from several hisP mutant strains defective in transport do not display any ATPase activity. at a high linear rate in the presence of Mg2+. The activity is dependent on the presence of a cation, and the efficiency of stimulation by various cations varies with their concentration (Fig. 3 B); Mn2+ is the best stimulator at higher concentrations (above 1.5 mm) and Co2+ is the best at lower concentrations (optimum at 1 mm, followed by an inhibition). 7Co2+ may stimulate the activity by interacting with the (His6) tail and inducing a conformational change. Ca2+ has a very poor stimulatory ability and Zn2+ has none (data not shown). Fig. 3 C shows that the pH optimum for activity is around 7, with a slow decline at higher pH values. Although HisP(his6) is dependent on the presence of 20% glycerol to stay in solution, the presence of glycerol above 7.5% during the assay inhibits the activity (Fig. 3 D), possibly by disruption of hydrophobic interactions. This inhibition is reversible, as shown by the fact that even though the protein is eluted from the TALON column in the presence of 20% glycerol, it is fully active upon dilution to glycerol concentrations lower than 7.5%. The activity of a preparation diluted to 0.7 mg/ml protein and 4% glycerol is stable at 0 °C for at least 1 h. The ATPase activity was observed to be non-linearly dependent on protein concentration (Fig. 4,circles), suggesting that the active form of the enzyme is a multimer. The specific activity, as calculated along the concentration curve in Fig. 4, indicates that the activity of the monomer, if any, would be extremely low. Because HisP is present in two copies in HisQMP2 and its ATPase activity displays positive cooperativity for ATP with a Hill coefficient of 2 (7Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), the most likely form of the active enzyme would be expected to be a dimer. 8The membrane-bound complex of the maltose permease, which contains two copies of the ATP-binding subunit, MalK, also displays positive cooperativity for ATP (26Davidson A.L. Laghaeian S.S. Mannering D.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4858-4863Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 provides support for this hypothesis because the experimental data match well the curve of activity versus protein concentration, as calculated for the active form being a dimer (solid line). The dimeric state of HisP(his6) could also be demonstrated by physical methods. A preparation of HisP(his6) (1 ml, 1 mg/ml) was applied to a molecular sieve column (0.5 × 75 cm; ACA54, LKB). A large peak of HisP was eluted at the position corresponding approximately to a molecular mass of 29.8 kDa (which is the calculated molecular mass of a single copy of HisP (25Higgins C.F. Haag P.D. Nikaido K. Ardeshir F. Garcia G. Ames G.F.-L. Nature. 1982; 298: 723-727Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar) containing the 8-residue extension), and a small peak appeared in the position corresponding to about 55 kDa, indicating that both monomer and dimer forms might be present. The small amount of the presumed dimer form suggested that the two forms are in rapid equilibrium with each other. Therefore, a more rapid separation was performed using HPLC (Fig.5 A). HisP(his6)was present both in the large peak corresponding to the monomer position and in small amount (about 3% total protein) in the position corresponding to about 60 kDa. An additional small peak appeared in the void volume; considering the propensity of HisP(his6) to precipitate, it was assumed that this latter peak contains higher aggregates and was not investigated further. A fraction from the presumed dimer peak was rechromatographed on the same column, yielding a peak at the position of the monomer, which is consistent with its being a dimer in equilibrium with the monomer. Evidence that the equilibrium between the monomer and the dimer is rapid was obtained by diluting a solution of 5.6 mg/ml HisP(his6) (which is estimated to contain 60% of the protein as a dimer; see inset in Fig. 4) 8-fold in assay buffer to a final concentration of 0.7 mg/ml (which contains 26% of the protein as dimer); one aliquot was assayed immediately and another aliquot was kept at 0 °C, and the ATPase activity was assayed at several time intervals (up to 1 h). The specific activity did not change in time, indicating that the protein reaches final equilibrium within the earliest time interval tested (5 min at 0 °C). A more rapid procedure was utilized by diluting 30- and 80-fold the same HisP(his6) solution into prewarmed assay buffer containing Mg2+ and immediately (within 5 s) assaying for activity. Fig. 5 B shows that the rates do not change significantly in time after dilution and that they correspond to what is expected for the amount of HisP(his6) dimer that is present at those final concentrations (10 and 4%, respectively). This indicates that the protein reaches equilibrium within seconds after dilution. The affinity for ATP, measured following dilution of a concentrated preparation to final concentrations of HisP(his6) and ATP of 167 μg/ml and 100 μm, respectively, gave a K d value for ATP of 205 μm (Fig. 6). In contrast to the results obtained with the intact complex, HisQMP2 (7Liu C.E. Liu P.-Q. Ames G.F.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 21883-21891Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), there is no evidence of cooperativity. Although Fig. 4 showed that the measurable activity is ascribable to the dimeric form and that the monomeric form, if active at all, has a very low specific activity, it is possible that the low level, non-cooperative, (hypothetical) activity of monomeric HisP(his6) contributed slightly to the measurements. Therefore, the K d value was also measured at high HisP(his6)concentration. 9This measurement requires the elimination of the ATP obligatorily present in solutions of HisP(his6) at high concentrations. The ATP analog, TNP-ATP, which has a high affinity for the enzyme and is hydrolyzed very slowly, maintains high concentrations of HisP(his6) in solution when present at 10 μm, for 14 days at 4 °C. HisP(his6) was purified as usual and the ATP was replaced with TNP-ATP by passage through a gel filtration column containing 10 μm TNP-ATP. This concentration of TNP-ATP does not significantly interfere with the assay for ATPase activity (Table II). The ATPase activity of such a preparation (containing 0.8 mg/ml HisP(his6), which is calculated to contain about 29% d"

Invasion of host cells by Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease, is dependent upon an elevation in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium in the invading trypomastigote (1Moreno S.N.J. Silva J. Vercesi A.E. Docampo R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian cells, T. cruzipossesses most of its intracellular Ca2+ in an acidic compartment named the acidocalcisome (2Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The biochemical characterization of this organelle has provided evidence that it is acidified by a vacuolar-type proton-translocating (V-H+)-ATPase and that it has a Ca2+/H+ countertransporting ATPase for Ca2+ uptake (2Docampo R.

Vacuoles observed inTrypanosoma cyclops were tentatively termed polyphosphate bodies on the basis of a high phosphorus content, an appearance similar to algal polyphosphate bodies and the prior report of polyphosphates in other trypanosomatids. They had an appreciable calcium content and, possibly, some zinc, although their composition was not quantified (9Vickerman K. Tetley L. Ann. Soc. Belge Med.

Incubation of promastigotes in the presence or absence of glucose did not cause significant changes in the vacuolar content of phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, or zinc, but changes in potassium and chloride were observed in both electron-dense vacuoles and in the cytoplasm (11LeFurgey A. Ingram P. Blum J.J. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1990; 40: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar).In this work we used quick freezing, ultracryomicrotomy, and electron probe x-ray microanalysis (12Shuman H. Somlyo A.V.

Our results suggest that the electron-dense organelles previously identified in T. cruziepimastigotes (10Dvorak J.A. Engel J.C. Leapman R.D. Swyt C.R. Pella P.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) correspond to acidocalcisomes (2Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, subcellular fractionation and gold-labeled transferrin studies ofT. cruzi epimastigotes provide evidence that these organelles are different from lysosomes or the prelysosomal vacuoles previously described as reservosomes (16Soares M.J. Souto-Padron T. de Souza W. J. Cell Sci. 1992; 102: 157-167PubMed Google Scholar). Invasion of host cells by Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease, is dependent upon an elevation in the concentration of cytosolic free calcium in the invading trypomastigote (1Moreno S.N.J. Silva J. Vercesi A.E. Docampo R. J. Exp. Med. 1994; 180: 1535-1540Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Unlike mammalian cells, T. cruzipossesses most of its intracellular Ca2+ in an acidic compartment named the acidocalcisome (2Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). The biochemical characterization of this organelle has provided evidence that it is acidified by a vacuolar-type proton-translocating (V-H+)-ATPase and that it has a Ca2+/H+ countertransporting ATPase for Ca2+ uptake (2Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Acidocalcisomes have also been found in other trypanosomatids such as Trypanosoma brucei (3Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Biochem.

J. 1996; 313: 655-659Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar). This organelle is in various aspects similar to the vacuole present in fungi and plant cells (8Wada Y. Anraku Y. J. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1994; 26: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) but apparently has no counterpart in animal cells. Using fluorescence microscopy it was possible to detect bafilomycin A1-, nigericin-, and NH4Cl-sensitive acridine orange accumulation in round vacuoles of varying size located mainly to the posterior and anterior of T. cruzi epimastigotes (2Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1005-1012Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) andT. brucei procyclic trypomastigotes (3Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J. Docampo R. Biochem. J. 1994; 304: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar), and these vacuoles were suggested to correspond to the acidocalcisomes (2Docampo R. Scott D.A. Vercesi A.E. Moreno S.N.J.

Parasitol. 1990; 40: 77-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) have reported the presence of calcium-rich inclusion vacuoles in different trypanosomatids following energy-dispersive x-ray microanalysis. Vacuoles observed inTrypanosoma cyclops were tentatively termed polyphosphate bodies on the basis of a high phosphorus content, an appearance similar to algal polyphosphate bodies and the prior report of polyphosphates in other trypanosomatids. They had an appreciable calcium content and, possibly, some zinc, although their composition was not quantified (9Vickerman K. Tetley L. Ann. Soc. Belge Med. Trop. 1977; 57: 441-455PubMed Google Scholar).T. cruzi epimastigotes were shown to possess electron-dense organelles identified by scanning transmission electron microscopy of whole cells. These contained large amounts of magnesium, potassium, calcium, phosphorus, and zinc (10Dvorak J.A. Engel J.C. Leapman R.D. Swyt C.R. Pella P.A. Mol. Biochem. Parasitol. 1988; 31: 19-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Iron was also found in these studies although its co-localization with the other elements detected was not so evident. Electron probe x-ray microanalysis ofLeishmania major promastigotes demonstrated that their electron-dense vacuoles are also rich in phosphorus, magnesium, calcium, sodium, and zinc, with concentrations of chloride and potassium below that of the cytoplasm (11LeFurgey A.

https://openalex.org/W2042438158,"Dynamin is a 100-kDa GTPase that is believed to be involved in the constriction of clathrin-coated pits and the fission of clathrin-coated vesicles during receptor-mediated endocytosis and during membrane retrieval in nerve termini. It has been shown that purified dynamin incubated under low salt conditions forms rings and spirals that, in dimension and appearance, resemble the dense material occasionally observed at the necks of coated pits. In this report we show that purified dynamin forms spirals under physiological salt conditions when incubated with GDP and γ-phosphate analogues (beryllium and aluminum fluoride) or when dialyzed into guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Moreover, spirals still form when dynamin is proteolyzed to either a predominant ∼90-kDa species, lacking the C terminus, or to two smaller fragments, a ∼55-kDa species originating from the N-terminal half of the protein and a ∼30-kDa species lacking both the N and C termini. This work indicates that the addition of GDP and γ-phosphate analogues arrests dynamin in a GTP or transition state that markedly stabilizes the spiral conformation under physiological ionic strength conditions and thereby suggests that dynamin in the absence of a receptor is capable of assembly into spirals at the necks of coated pits prior to vesicle fission.

Dynamin, a 100-kDa GTPase, is involved in the final steps of vesicle fission during receptor-mediated endocytosis and membrane retrieval in synapses. The discovery that dynamin is the mammalian homologue of the shibire gene product inDrosophila was the first evidence that dynamin plays a role in endocytosis (1van der Bliek A.M. Meyerowitz E.M. Nature. 1991; 351: 411-414Crossref PubMed Scopus (596) Google Scholar, 2Chen M.S. Obar R.A. Schroeder C.C. Austin T.W. Poodry C.A. Wadsworth S.C. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1991; 351: 583-586Crossref PubMed Scopus (441) Google Scholar). Drosophila expressing the mutantshibire ts gene product exhibit a rapid and reversible paralysis at the nonpermissive temperature (3Grigliatti T.A. Hall L. Rosenbluth R. Suzuki D.T. Mol. Gen. Genet. 1973; 120: 107-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Thin section electron micrographs of the mutant nerve termini revealed an absence of synaptic vesicles and an accumulation of coated pits with necks that were surrounded by a dense material referred to as a “collar” (4Kosaka T. Ikeda K. J. Neurobiol. 1983; 14: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar, 5Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. J. Neurosci. 1989; 9: 3844-3860Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 6Tsuruhara T. Koenig J.H. Ikeda K. Cell Tissue Res. 1983; 259: 199-207Crossref Scopus (36) Google Scholar). This suggested that the shibire gene product was crucial for membrane retrieval because the mutant blocked vesicle fission. Dynamin was originally identified as a microtubule-binding protein from bovine brain extracts (7Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Cell. 1989; 59: 421-432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (342) Google Scholar) and was subsequently determined to be a member of the GTPase superfamily (8Obar R.A. Collins C.A. Hammarback J.A. Shpetner H.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1990; 347: 256-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (286) Google Scholar). In addition to the originally identified neuronal dynamin (dynamin-1), two isoforms have been discovered: ubiquitously expressed dynamin-2 (9Sontag J.-M. Fykse E.M. Ushkaryov Y. Liu J.-P. Robinson P.J. Südhof T.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4547-4554Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Cook T.A. Urrutia R. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 644-648Crossref PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and testes-specific dynamin-3 (11Nakata T. Takemura R. Hirokawa N. J. Cell Sci. 1993; 105: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Within the highly conserved isoforms there are several domains that have been implicated in mediating protein-protein interactions. These include a “self-assembly” motif near the N terminus that was initially characterized for Mx, a member of the dynamin family of GTPases (12Nakayama M. Yazaki K. Kusano A. Nagata K. Hanai N. Ishihama A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 15033-15038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Dynamin also contains a pleckstrin homology domain, a coiled-coil domain, and a proline-rich C terminus, all of which may be of particular functional importance (for review see Refs. 13Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar and 14Urrutia R. Henley J.R. Cook T. McNiven M.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 377-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). Effector molecules that stimulate the GTPase activity of dynamin have been shown to bind to the C terminus of dynamin. These include a subset of SH3-containing proteins that bind to the SH3-binding domains of dynamin located within the proline-rich C terminus (15Gout I. Dhand R. Hiles I.D. Fry M.J. Panayotou G. Das P. Truong O. Totty N.F. Hsuan J. Booker G.W. Campbell I.D. Waterfield M.D. Cell. 1993; 75: 25-36Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar). In addition, microtubules and anionic lipids have been shown to stimulate the GTPase activity of dynamin through its C terminus by positive cooperativity (16Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, evidence indicates that the specific site of interaction between dynamin and the effector molecules, or the mechanism of the stimulation of dynamin, differs between microtubules (or GRB2, an SH3-containing protein) and anionic lipids (17Lin H.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27979-27982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). In either case the multivalent effector molecules may simply provide a backbone for dynamin-dynamin interactions (18Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Self-assembly of dynamin in the absence of any effector molecule has been shown to stimulate its GTPase activity (17Lin H.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 27979-27982Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 19Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar) and thus may be the physiologically relevant activation of dynamin (19Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). Mutant forms of dynamin overexpressed in mammalian cells implicated a direct role for dynamin in receptor-mediated endocytosis (20van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J.

Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). Cells overexpressing a mutant form of dynamin deficient in GTP binding (K44A) or a temperature-sensitive mutation (G273D) homologous toshibire accumulated coated pits that failed to constrict or pinch off (22Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 23Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). These results correlated well with known GTP requirements for vesicle formation; GTP binding is required for the constriction of coated pits, whereas GTP hydrolysis is required for vesicle fission (Ref. 24Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar; for review see Ref. 13Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Further elucidation of the role of dynamin in vesicle fission came from examining purified dynamin by electron microscopy. This work revealed that the basic assembly unit of dynamin, a tetramer, can polymerize into rings or spirals that resemble the collar structures seen at the necks of coated pits in the shibire mutant nerve termini (4Kosaka T. Ikeda K. J. Neurobiol. 1983; 14: 207-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar,25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). Dynamin spirals also resemble the striation pattern seen on long tubules, which originate from the plasma membrane and end in a coated pit. These tubules are observed in synaptosomes treated with GTPγS 1The abbreviations used are: GTPγS, guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate; TLCK, 1-chloro-3-tosylamido-7-amino-2-heptanone; GMP-PNP, 5′-guanyl-imidodiphosphate; Hudy-1, human dynamin 1 antibody; α-dyn, anti-dynamin (D25520). (26Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Dynamin was immunolocalized to these long tubules but not to the terminal coated pits (26Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). These results, in light of previous work, have led to a working model of the role of dynamin in endocytosis (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar) (for review see Ref. 27Baba T. Damke H. Hinshaw J.E. Ikeda K. Schmid S.L. Warnock D.E. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1995; 60: 235-242Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In this model, dynamin is first recruited to clathrin lattices on the plasma membrane; however, it remains unknown if GDP is bound or if dynamin is an apoprotein at this step. GTP binding then redistributes dynamin to the necks of invaginating coated pits where it assembles into spirals and constricts the necks. Finally, GTP hydrolysis may cause a conformational change in dynamin spirals that would lead to coated vesicle fission. We have shown previously that wild type dynamin forms spirals under low salt conditions (<50 mm) and that under these conditions GTP binding appears not to be required because K44A was also capable of polymerizing (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). It was also found that the addition of any guanine nucleotide (GTP, GDP, or GTPγS) caused wild type dynamin to disassemble, and significantly higher concentrations of GTP were required for K44A disassembly (19Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). In addition, it was shown that the removal of the C terminus of dynamin (resulting in a ∼90-kDa species) prior to incubation in low salt prevented dynamin assembly (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). In this report, we show that the addition of GDP and beryllium fluoride or aluminum fluoride causes dynamin to form spirals under physiological salt conditions (150 mm NaCl). Furthermore, in contrast to previous results, dynamin treated with GTPγS also assembled into rings and spirals. This suggests that the addition of GDP and metallofluorides to purified dynamin mimics a GTP or transition state. This is consistent with the fact that spiral structures are seen when synaptosomes are incubated with GTPγS (26Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). In addition, the collar or small spirals seen at the necks of coated pits in theshibire nerve termini have been postulated to be the result of the failure of dynamin to hydrolyze GTP (23Damke H. Baba T. van der Bliek A.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 131: 69-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (346) Google Scholar). When we proteolyzed dynamin to a predominant ∼90-kDa species or further proteolyzed it to two smaller fragments, a ∼55-kDa and a ∼30-kDa species, prior to beryllium fluoride and GDP treatment, dynamin maintained the ability to form rings and spirals. This is in contrast to earlier findings in which the ∼90-kDa species was unable to form spirals upon incubation in low salt. These results suggest that a GTP or transition state highly favors and stabilizes dynamin in the ring or spiral conformation and that this state may represent a crucial step in the GTPase cycle of dynamin, which is responsible for coated pit constriction and subsequent vesicle fission.

McNiven (28Henley J.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). All other chemicals were reagent grade. Dynamin-1 was expressed in baculovirus-infectedTN5-JE cells and harvested 48 h post-infection by centrifugation at 500 × g for 10 min at 4 °C and purified as described previously (19Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). All steps were performed at 4 °C. In brief, the cell pellet from a ∼300-ml cell suspension (106 cells/ml) was washed with phosphate-buffered saline and repelleted. The cell pellet was resuspended in 25 ml of Hepes column buffer (HCB, 20 mm Hepes, pH 7.2, 2 mmEGTA, 1 mm MgCl2, 1 mmdithiothreitol) containing 100 mm NaCl (HCB100), a protease inhibitor tablet, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.85 μg of calpain inhibitor I. Cells were homogenized by nitrogen cavitation at 500 psi for 20 min and then slowly released. The homogenate was centrifuged at 52,000 rpm for 60 min in a Beckman 70.1 Ti rotor. The supernatant was collected and slowly brought to 30% ammonium sulfate by dropwise addition of 60% ammonium sulfate (0 °C) in HCB0 (no NaCl) while stirring and then allowed to remain at 4 °C for 30 min. The solution was centrifuged in a Beckman JA-20 rotor at 10,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 3 ml of HCB100, diluted 1:1 with HCB0, and then recentrifuged at 10,000 × g for 10 min to remove protein aggregates. The supernatant was applied to a High-Q anion exchange column pre-equilibrated with HCB50. The column was washed with 20 ml of HCB 50 and then with 30 ml of HCB100 before eluting dynamin with 10 ml of HCB250. Peak fractions were pooled, and 0.1 mm Pefabloc protease inhibitor was added before loading onto a Hydroxyapatite column pre-equilibrated with HCB250, 5 mmCaCl2. The column was washed with 20 ml of 200 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, and dynamin was eluted with 20 ml of 400 mm KH2PO4. Aliquots were stored at −80 °C in 400 mmKH2PO4 containing 0.1 mm Pefabloc protease inhibitor, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and 5% ethylene glycol. Dynamin was incubated with 1 mm GDP, 500 μm AlCl3, and 5 mm NaF in HCB150 (150 mm NaCl) for 15 min at room temperature or was dialyzed overnight at 4 °C into HCB150 containing 1 mm dithiothreitol, 5% ethylene glycol, GDP (10 μm to 1 mm), 5 mm NaF, and 500 μm BeCl2. Dialysis with 10 or 100 μm GTPγS was also done in HCB150 overnight at 4 °C. Control conditions were 150 mm NaCl alone, GDP alone, or AlFx (BeFx) alone. 2The exact composition of the beryllium fluoride and aluminum fluoride species is unknown and therefore will be referred to as BeFx and AlFx, respectively. Spectra/Por 1 membrane tubing with a molecular mass cut-off of 6,000–8,000 Da (Spectrum Medical Industries, Houston, TX) was used for dialysis. Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C in a Beckman TLA 100 rotor (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The resultant supernatant and pellet fractions were then analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, and quantitated by using NIH Image software. For GMP-PNP experiments, dynamin was dialyzed overnight with 100 μm GMP-PNP in HCB150 and assayed as described above. Dynamin, in 400 mm KH2PO4, pH 7.2, was proteolyzed by subtilisin for 1 h either on ice or at room temperature at a concentration of 1:400 w/w (subtilisin:dynamin). The reaction was stopped by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Dynamin was proteolyzed by papain for 30 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 1.4 mm TLCK. The proteolytic fragments were then dialyzed overnight, as described above, into HCB150 with GDP/BeFx, and with either 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride or 1.4 mm TLCK. The dialyzed samples were examined by the sedimentation assay, Western blotting, and by negative stain electron microscopy. Western blot analysis was performed by standard methods; samples were incubated with Hudy-1 at 0.1 μg/ml (18Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), α-dyn (D25520) at 0.25 μg/ml, MC13 at 1:1000, and MC63 at 1:1000. Dynamin incubated or dialyzed under the various conditions described above was examined by transmission electron microscopy prior to sedimentation. Samples were diluted to ∼0.1 mg/ml, adsorbed to 400 mesh carbon-coated EM grids, and negatively stained with 2% uranyl acetate before air drying. Electron micrographs were obtained using a Philips 400 or CM120 electron microscope at 100 kV and recorded at 35,000× at a defocus of 1.15 μm. In this paper we show that dynamin polymerizes into spirals under physiological salt conditions upon the addition of GDP and beryllium fluoride or aluminum fluoride. It has been established that dynamin assembly can be quantified by a sedimentation assay in which polymerized assembled dynamin appears in the pellet after high speed centrifugation (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig.1 A, the addition of aluminum fluoride and GDP caused dynamin to shift from the supernatant to the pellet, which indicated that the majority of dynamin was polymerized (compare control to GDP/AlFx). Under these conditions ∼80% of the total dynamin was found in the pellet, whereas only ∼30% was in the pellet under control conditions (control, GDP alone, or AlFx alone) (Fig. 1 B). Electron micrographs of dynamin incubated with aluminum fluoride and GDP revealed that dynamin had assembled into rings (arrowheads) and small spirals (arrows), as predicted by the sedimentation assay (Fig.2 A). These structures were indistinguishable from those seen under low salt conditions, with an outer ring diameter of ∼50 nm and an inner ring diameter of ∼30 nm (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). The rings and spirals also formed when dynamin was incubated in low salt with aluminum fluoride and GDP (data not shown). In comparison, dynamin incubated under control conditions (no additions, AlFx alone, or GDP alone) did not polymerize into spirals but remained disassembled as slightly curved, elongated structures (Fig. 2 B). Upon investigation of the effects of γ-phosphate analogues on dynamin by overnight dialysis with varying concentrations of GDP (1 μm to 1 mm) and beryllium fluoride, we found that 10 μm GDP was most effective in shifting dynamin to the pellet (Fig. 3). This is consistent with the affinity of dynamin for GTP (10–100 μm) (13Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. Bioessays. 1996; 18: 885-893Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), although the affinity of dynamin for GDP may be different, as it has yet to be determined. Negative stain images of dynamin dialyzed with beryllium fluoride and 10 μm GDP showed a noticeable difference in the spiral length (Fig. 4) when compared with diluting dynamin into GDP and aluminum fluoride (Fig. 2 A). This may be the result of a higher protein concentration (1 mg/ml) or slower addition of metallofluoride and GDP to dynamin by dialysis. No assembled structures were seen when dynamin was treated with GDP alone, although an occasional ring was seen in the presence of beryllium fluoride alone (data not shown). This suggested that there may have been a residual amount of GDP still bound to dynamin after purification. When dynamin was dialyzed for several hours to remove any bound GDP and then treated with beryllium fluoride, no rings or spirals were observed.Figure 4Dynamin assembles into rings and long extended spirals in the presence of beryllium fluoride and GDP or GTPγS. Dynamin was dialyzed overnight (∼1 mg/ml) at 4 °C in HCB150 containing 10 μm GDP, 500 μmBeCl2, and 5 mm NaF (A) or 10 μm GTPγS (B). These conditions resulted in the assembly of dynamin into rings and spirals. Control conditions did not yield assembled structures (data not shown). Scale bar, 100 nm.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Upon dialysis into 10 μm GTPγS, ∼75% of dynamin appeared in the pellet after centrifugation (data not shown). Electron micrographs of dynamin treated with GTPγS revealed that rings and spirals formed, although these structures were not as refined or extensive as those seen with beryllium fluoride and GDP (Fig.4 B). When dynamin was dialyzed into 100 μmGTPγS, only ∼45% of it was found in the pellet compared with ∼30% for the control (HCB150 alone), and just an occasional ring or small spiral was observed by electron microscopy. Dynamin dialyzed with GMP-PNP, however, did not form spirals (data not shown). In addition, we found that dynamin dialyzed overnight with GDP and vanadate remained predominantly in the supernatant, and spirals did not form (data not shown). We also examined a dynamin mutant (K44A) that is defective in GTP binding (20van der Bliek A.M. Redelmeier T.E. Damke H. Tisdale E.J. Meyerowitz E.M. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 122: 553-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (591) Google Scholar, 22Damke H. Baba T. Warnock D.E. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 915-934Crossref PubMed Scopus (1046) Google Scholar) and found it required at least 10-fold more GDP than wild type to have the equivalent amount of dynamin in the pellet or assembled into spirals (data not shown). This is consistent with the mutant having a lower affinity for guanine nucleotides. The removal of the C-terminal domain of dynamin that yielded a ∼90-kDa fragment did not prevent its assembly into spirals upon dialysis into beryllium fluoride and GDP (see Fig. 6 A). Furthermore, these spirals appeared more tightly ordered and compact than those observed with intact dynamin (compare Fig. 6, Cand D). In the sedimentation assay, the ∼90-kDa species and some smaller fragments appeared in the pellet (Fig.5, lane 4). As expected, an antibody (α-dyn) made against the N-terminal half of dynamin (amino acids 45–358) containing the GTP-binding domain (Fig. 5, lane 8) and a peptide antibody, MC13, against element I (amino acids 34–48) (28Henley J.R. McNiven M.A. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 761-775Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar) recognized the ∼90-kDa fragment (TableI). To determine whether the C-terminal ∼10-kDa fragment remained associated with the assembled structures after digestion, we blotted with Hudy-1, a monoclonal antibody specific to this region (18Warnock D.E. Terlecky L.J. Schmid S.L. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). As seen in Fig. 5, fragments containing the epitope for Hudy-1 antibody appeared in the supernatant (lane 11). Dynamin further digested with subtilisin (1 h at room temperature) resulted in a predominant ∼40-kDa species that appeared in the supernatant after centrifugation (Fig. 5, lane 5). Electron micrographs corresponding to these conditions revealed no rings or spirals (data not shown). The ∼40-kDa species was also recognized by both MC13 (Table I) and α-dyn antibodies (Fig. 5,lane 9). It should be noted that the ∼40-kDa species was found in the pellet when present with higher molecular mass species (Fig. 5, lane 4 and 8) and C-terminal fragments were found in the supernatant (Fig. 5, lane 13).Figure 5The C terminus is not required for dynamin assembly upon the addition of beryllium fluoride and GDP.

Proteolysis of dynamin with papain for 30 min at room temperature resulted in a major ∼55-kDa and a minor ∼30-kDa species that were subsequently found in the pellet upon dialysis with beryllium fluoride and GDP (Fig. 5, lane 16). As with the ∼90- and ∼40-kDa fragments, the ∼55-kDa fragment was also recognized by α-dyn and MC13 but not by Hudy-1 (Table I). The ∼30-kDa species was not recognized by the N-terminal antibodies, including MC63, which was generated against the peptide sequence 216–241 (Table I), or by the C-terminal antibody Hudy-1. Examination of papain-digested dynamin by electron microscopy revealed assembled spirals (Fig. 6 B); however, they were more unraveled and disordered than spirals formed with either intact dynamin or with the ∼90-kDa species. We have shown that dynamin self-assembles into spirals under physiological salt conditions upon the addition of GDP and γ-phosphate analogues or when dialyzed into a buffer containing GTPγS. This is in contrast to previous findings in which dynamin assembled into spirals only under low ionic strength conditions (<50 mm), and once assembled the presence of guanine nucleotides (GTP, GTPγS, and GDP) caused dynamin to disassemble (19Warnock D.E. Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 22310-22314Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). We suggest that the addition of GDP and the γ-phosphate analogues beryllium fluoride or aluminum fluoride is mimicking a GTP or transition state. These results provide evidence that either the GTP or transition state of dynamin is the specific conformation necessary for its assembly at the necks of coated pits. Beryllium fluoride and aluminum fluoride have been used in a variety of systems as γ-phosphate analogues that may mimic GTP (ATP), GDP.Pi (ADP.Pi), or GTP + bound Pi(ATP + bound Pi) (29Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Addition of metallofluorides to structural proteins such as myosin (30Fisher A.J. Smith C.A. Thoden J.B. Smith R. Sutoh K. Holden H.M. Rayment I. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 8960-8972Crossref PubMed Scopus (637) Google Scholar), tubulin (31Carlier M.F. Didry D. Melki R. Chabre M. Pantaloni D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3555-3559Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), or heterotrimeric G-proteins (32Coleman D.E. Berghuis A.M. Lee E. Linder M.E. Gilman A.G. Sprang S.R.

Cell. 1997; 89: 251-261Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (691) Google Scholar) have shown that different states are mimicked depending on the analogue used and the protein in question. The addition of beryllium fluoride (or aluminum fluoride) and GDP to dynamin may mimic the GTP state because GTPγS had similar effects on dynamin assembly. However, it is also possible that a transition state is being mimicked and that the polymerization of dynamin into spirals when treated with GTPγS is the result of slow GTPγS hydrolysis. Interestingly, neither vanadate in conjunction with GDP, which has been shown to mimic a slightly different nucleotide state in other proteins (29Chabre M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 6-10Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar), nor GMP-PNP had an effect on dynamin assembly. Vanadate may mimic a different guanine nucleotide state that does not favor spiral formation, or, as suggested by previous evidence, dynamin may have a lower affinity for vanadate than for the metallofluorides (41Shpetner M.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). Dynamin has been shown to have similar affinities for GMP-PNP, GTPγS, and GTP (39Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 41Shpetner M.S. Vallee R.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 733-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). This suggests that the spirals formed with GTPγS treatment are due to slow hydrolysis, and therefore it may be a transition state that stabilizes dynamin assembly. Previously it has been shown that the removal of the C terminus, which reduces the basic assembly unit of dynamin from a tetramer to a dimer, prevented spiral formation under low ionic strength conditions (25Hinshaw J.E. Schmid S.L. Nature. 1995; 374: 190-192Crossref PubMed Scopus (665) Google Scholar). However, we found that the ∼90-kDa fragment was still capable of assembly into spirals when dialyzed overnight with beryllium fluoride and GDP. In addition, the removal of the C terminus resulted in more condensed and tightly packed spirals than those observed with intact dynamin, which indicates, not surprisingly, that the basic proline-rich domain in intact dynamin interferes with compact packing. The assembly of the ∼90-kDa fragment also suggests that the binding of any effector molecules to the C terminus, which stimulates dynamin GTPase activity, is not necessary for spiral formation in vivo. In an attempt to determine the smallest fragment necessary for spiral formation, we further proteolyzed dynamin with subtilisin to a predominant ∼40-kDa species and found that it failed to form any assembled structures. However, when dynamin was proteolyzed with papain to a major ∼55-kDa species and a minor ∼30-kDa species, it formed spirals, although they were more disordered than those observed with intact dynamin. The ∼55-kDa fragment originated from the N-terminal half of the protein as indicated by antibody recognition to element I (amino acids 34–48). This suggests that the ∼55-kDa species lacks the proline-rich C terminus, the coiled-coil domain, and pleckstrin homology domain, all of which have been suggested to play a role in dynamin assembly. However, the minor ∼30-kDa species, which does not contain the GTP-binding domain, may contain the pleckstrin homology domain as well as the coiled-coil domain. Therefore, the ∼30-kDa fragment, which also does not contain the C terminus, may provide the necessary domain for dynamin assembly when combined with the ∼55-kDa species, because it is found in the pellet after centrifugation. Given that spatially distinct domains of dynamin are involved in GTPase stimulation, it is not surprising that dynamin fragments are capable of interacting with each other after proteolysis. In addition to finding the ∼55- and ∼30-kDa fragments in the pellet, we also found that the ∼40-kDa species is shifted to the pellet when present with higher molecular weight species. The binding of dynamin fragments to each other may represent interactions that occur in vivo within a single dynamin molecule or, more likely, between two different dynamin molecules because the GTPase activity of dynamin is concentration-dependent (16Tuma P.L. Collins C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 30842-30847Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 17Lin H.C. Gilman A.G. J. Biol.

EMBO J. 1995; 14: 1322-1328Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Further analysis of the dynamin fragments should lead to the determination of the precise role of each of the domains of dynamin in assembly. The requirements for dynamin assembly, as indicated by our proteolysis results, differ from the requirements shown previously for membrane localization. It has been suggested that the SH3-binding domains within the C terminus are necessary for dynamin localization to clathrin-coated pits (35Shupliakov O. Löw P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 36Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13-16Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Although the C terminus of dynamin may be necessary for dynamin plasma membrane localization, we have shown here that it is not essential for dynamin assembly. The stabilization of dynamin spirals correlates well with previousin vitro results. It has been shown that aluminum fluoride does not prevent coated pit invagination but inhibits coated vesicle fission (24Carter L.L. Redelmeier T.E. Woollenweber L.A. Schmid S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 37-45Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Considering our findings that the addition of aluminum fluoride and GDP stabilizes dynamin into tight spirals, it is not surprising that aluminum fluoride treatment results in an accumulation of constricted coated pits. Similarly, the fact that dynamin forms spirals when incubated with GTPγS correlates well with the finding that synaptosomes treated with GTPγS accumulate long tubular structures believed to be coated with dynamin spirals (26Takei K. McPherson P.S. Schmid S.L. De Camilli P. Nature. 1995; 374: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (657) Google Scholar). Previously it was proposed that dynamin partners were essential for assembly of dynamin at the necks of coated pits under physiological conditions. Although it is likely that partners are necessary for dynamin localization to coated pits, partners may not be necessary for dynamin assembly because we show here that dynamin alone assembles into spirals under physiological salt conditions. Amphiphysin and other unidentified neuronal specific proteins may be responsible for dynamin membrane localization in neuronal tissue (35Shupliakov O. Löw P. Grabs D. Gad H. Chen H. David C. Takei K. De Camilli P. Brodin L. Science. 1997; 276: 259-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar, 36Shpetner H.S. Herskovits J.S. Vallee R.B. J. Biol.

A. 1996; 93: 331-335Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar), whereas the ubiquitous partner for dynamin localization to coated pits may be the appendage domain of α-adaptin (38Wang L.-H. Südhof T.C. Anderson R.G.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 10079-10083Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar). However, the specific factor responsible for dynamin localization to the necks of constricted coated pits has not been identified. It is feasible that dynamin spontaneously forms spirals around the necks of invaginating coated pits once the necks reach a certain diameter. In this case, the necks may provide a similar backbone for dynamin assembly as microtubules and anionic lipid tubes do for dynamin assembly in vitro (39Maeda K. Nakata T. Noda Y. Sato-Yoshitake R. Hirokawa N. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1992; 3: 1181-1194Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 40Hinshaw J.E. Sweiter S.M Mol. Biol. Cell. 1996; 7 (abstr.): 83Google Scholar). Whether dynamin plays a direct role in vesicle fission by providing a physical force to pinch off coated vesicles or an indirect role by creating a constricted neck that may allow spontaneous membrane fusion has yet to be shown. We are currently examining the structure of dynamin under a variety of conditions to determine if any conformational change occurs that may correlate with vesicle fission. We thank Drs. Gilbert Ashwell, Julie Donaldson, and Sharon Sweitzer for careful reading and discussions and Drs. Sandra Schmid and Dale Warnock for generosity in providing dynamin I high titer stock and K44A protein. We also thank Dr. Mark McNiven for the peptide-specific antibodies, MC13 and MC63."

The preference of metastasizing tumor cells for certain organs may be explained if such cells fortuitously recognize and adhere to organ-specific, endothelial cell-surface molecules.

In our laboratory, a different approach was chosen to testing the contribution of specific endothelial cell adhesion molecules to organ preference of metastasis. It relied on an endothelial cell culture system that could be modulated by growing unspecific, large vessel-derived endothelial cells (e.g.bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) 1The abbreviations used are: BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; DST, disuccinimidyl tartarate; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ORF, open reading frame; mAb, monoclonal antibody; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); kb, kilobase(s); wtLu-ECAM-1, wild-type Lu-ECAM-1; rLu-ECAM-1, recombinant Lu-ECAM-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline. 1The abbreviations used are: BAEC, bovine aortic endothelial cells; KLH, keyhole limpet hemocyanin; DST, disuccinimidyl tartarate; RT-PCR, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction; RACE, rapid amplification of cDNA ends; HEK293, human embryonic kidney 293; CMV, cytomegalovirus; ORF, open reading frame; mAb, monoclonal antibody; bp, base pair(s); nt, nucleotide(s); kb, kilobase(s); wtLu-ECAM-1, wild-type Lu-ECAM-1; rLu-ECAM-1, recombinant Lu-ECAM-1; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline.) on organ-specific matrix to express phenotypic traits of the microvasculature of that organ (8Augustin-Voss H.G. Johnson R.C. Pauli B.U. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 192: 346-351Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 9Pauli B.U. Lee C.L. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 379-387PubMed Google Scholar). Tumor cells with distinct metastatic dissemination patterns were then evaluated for adhesion to these endothelial cells, observing that tumor cells only bound in large numbers to those endothelial cells that were modulated with matrix from the preferred organ site of metastasis (9Pauli B.U. Lee C.L. Lab. Invest. 1988; 58: 379-387PubMed Google Scholar). To identify the adhesion-receptor/ligand pair that mediated binding of lung-metastatic melanoma cells to lung matrix-modulated BAEC, monoclonal antibodies directed against endothelial lumenal membrane vesicles were produced that inhibited the specific adhesion of melanoma cells to endothelium (10Zhu D. Pauli B.U. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1991; 39: 1137-1142Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 11Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Such a mAb was 6D3. The antibody selectively recognized endothelia of pleural and subpleural venules and, to a lesser extent, endothelia of peribronchiolar and parenchymal venules of mouse lung (11Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 12Zhu D. Pauli B.U. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). This vascular distribution was highly correlated with the position of emerging tumor colonies three weeks after intravenous inoculation of B16-F10 melanoma cells; i.e. most metastases were observed in pleural and subpleural tissues (12Zhu D. Pauli B.U. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). The purified antibody effectively increased the clearance of B16-F10 cells from murine lungs, exerting its most dramatic effect during the first 30 min after intravenous inoculation of tumor cells (13Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Accordingly this antibody was efficient in preventing metastatic colonization of the lungs by B16-F10 melanoma cells (11Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Purification of the endothelial cell adhesion molecule was performed by immunoprecipitation from extracts of lung matrix-modulated BAEC using mAb 6D3 (11Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). A major component at 90 kDa was identified and termedlung-endothelial celladhesion molecule-1 (Lu-ECAM-1; Ref. 11Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The purified molecule promotes strong adhesion of B16-F10 cells under static and hydrodynamic conditions (14Goetz D.J. El-Sabban M.E. Hammer D.A. Pauli B.U. Int. J. Cancer. 1995; 65: 192-199Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and, in soluble form, competitively inhibits adhesion of these tumor cells to immobilized Lu-ECAM-1 (11Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar, 13Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Here, we identify other components of the Lu-ECAM-1 complex and define their interrelationships. The sequences of cDNAs that encode these proteins are reported, and it is shown that the Lu-ECAM-1 gene is conserved in humans as well as other mammals. Lu-ECAM-1 is not a member of any of the classic families of cell-cell adhesion molecules introduced above but is a homolog of the recently described calcium-activated chloride channel, Ca-CC (15Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31016-31026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar). In light of this homology, our previous characterization of sites of expression of the Lu-ECAM-1 complex is extended and compared with the localization of Ca-CC. The dual adhesion/chloride channel function of Lu-ECAM-1 is novel and intriguing and is discussed here in the context of channel regulation and importance to metastasis. Lu-ECAM-1 was immunopurified from BAEC and lung with mAb 6D3 as described by Zhuet al. (11Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9568-9572Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Proteins were fractionated by SDS-PAGE (10%) and stained with silver (see Fig. 1) or transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) and sequenced at the Northwestern or Harvard University protein sequencing facilities. Molecular weights were determined relative to unstained size markers (Life Technologies, Inc. and Molecular Probes). For deglycosylation, immunopurified proteins were treated with recombinant N-glycosidase F according to the manufacturer (N-Glycanase; Genzyme, Cambridge, MA). The general strategy for assembly of Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA Clone 1 from fragments obtained by PCR is schematized in Fig. 2. First, the amino-terminal and internal protein sequences of the 38-kDa component (see Table I) were used to design degenerate primers for primary and nested PCR using reverse transcribed BAEC total RNA as template. Upstream primers corresponded to amino acids 685–693 and 698–705. Downstream antisense primers corresponded to amino acids 839–832 and 852–846. A product of ∼450 bp was obtained and sequenced (see Fig. 2, P1). From this sequence, nondegenerate primers for 3′-RACE were designed (nt 2562–2588 and 2590–2611 of Clone 1, GenBankTM Data Bank accession number AF001261; 3′ Amplifinder RACE kit,CLONTECH). An ∼750-bp product was obtained and sequenced (see Fig. 2, P2). Nondegenerate primers were designed for the first round of 5′-RACE (nt 2643–2619 and 2523–2505; 5′ RACE System, Life Technologies, Inc.). An ∼1000-bp product was obtained and sequenced (Fig. 2, P3). Its 5′ end (nt 1572) lacked a Kozak-context ATG (17Kozak M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1981; 9: 5233-5253Crossref PubMed Scopus (826) Google Scholar) and signal sequence and so appeared to be an abortive reverse transcription product. A further 5′-RACE reaction using an internal primer (nt 1599–1572) was performed to obtain the entire 5′ end (see Fig. 2, P4), containing a Kozak-context ATG, a signal sequence, and the amino-terminal sequence of the 90-kDa protein (see Fig. 3). To reconstitute the cDNA, these overlapping PCR products were assembled into one ORF by an overlap-extension strategy using a high fidelityTaq/Pfu polymerase combination (Stratagene) (18Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2633) Google Scholar). The order of assembly was ((P1 + P2) + P3) + P4. Products were cloned into a T-vector (Invitrogen) and sequenced. To obtain other clones, total RNA was isolated from BAEC by the guanidinium chloride procedure (19Chirgwin J.J. Przbyla A.E. MacDonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16621) Google Scholar) and used to prepare a cDNA library in Lambda Zap II (Stratagene). Internal peptide sequences of the 90-kDa component were used to design degenerate primers for RT-PCR with BAEC RNA as template. Primers corresponding to amino acids 143–148 and 310–305 (Fig. 3) yielded an ∼520-bp product. This product was used to screen the library by filter hybridization. Oligonucleotide primers were prepared by Life Technologies, Inc., and DNA sequencing was by the Sanger method. Sequences were analyzed with GCG software (University of Wisconsin).Table IPeptide sequences derived from immunopurified proteinsPeptideDerivation (kDa protein)Location in Clone 1 ORFSMVNLINNGYDGIVIAIN901–18QESYDQADVIVANPYL9074–89HEWAHLRWGIFDEYNV90134–149DQPFYISR90150–157STWDVIMNSSDFQNTSPMTEMNPP90251–274LFQMNQAAELYLIQVIEKG90306–324VLYVPGYVENGKIILNPPRPEVKDDLAK32 and 38683–710KEDYIQLSWTAPGNV38752–766FYISVQAINEANLISEVSHIVQAIK38828–851 Open table in a new tab Figure 3Sequence comparison of Lu-ECAM-1 cDNAs and Ca-CC.

Antibodies CU11 and CU8 were generated against synthetic peptides. Peptides were synthesized at the Dept. of Genetic Engineering (University of Illinois, Urbana), partially purified by HPLC, and conjugated to KLH using the Activated Immunogen Conjugation kit (Pierce). Antibody CU19 was prepared after cloning theBsaBI-StyI fragment containing the 3′ end of Clone 3 (amino acids 624–799) into the PvuII site of pRSET A (Invitrogen) to produce a fusion protein bearing a six-histidine metal affinity tag. The protein was purified over nickel-resin (Invitrogen) and conjugated to KLH. Rabbit polyclonal antisera were prepared by Cocalico Biologicals (Reamstown, PA). Polyclonal antibodies R4 and R41 were prepared by immunizing rats with the 90- and 38-kDa bands, respectively, excised from polyacrylamide gels, pulverized, and mixed with complete Freund's adjuvant. Immunoblots were performed according to standard methods (20Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) using horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Life Technologies, Inc. or Pierce) and chemiluminescence (ECL, Amersham Corp., or Super Signal, Pierce). For biotinylation, BAEC were treated with NHS (long arm)-biotin (Vector Laboratories, Inc., Burlingame, CA) as recommended by the manufacturer. Disuccinimidyl tartarate (DST, Pierce) cross-linking was as described (21Kunz S. Ziegler U. Kunz B. Sonderegger P. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 135: 253-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and detected using avidin-horseradish peroxidase and chemiluminescence.Table IIDerivation of antibodies used in this workAntibodyAntigenProteins detectedkDa6D3Lu-ECAM-12-aWhole protein.90, 120, 130CU11Amino acids 23–402-bSynthetic peptide: amino acid positions in Clone 1 ORF.90, 120, 130CU8Amino acids 514–5302-bSynthetic peptide: amino acid positions in Clone 1 ORF.90, 120, 130CU19Amino acids 618–7672-cBacterially expressed fusion protein.32, 38, 90,2-dWeak. 120, 130R490-kDa protein90, 120, 130R4138-kDa protein32, 38, 120, 1302-a Whole protein.2-b Synthetic peptide: amino acid positions in Clone 1 ORF.2-c Bacterially expressed fusion protein.2-d Weak. Open table in a new tab For expression in HEK293 cells, Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA was placed under control of a tetracycline-regulated promoter in pTet-Splice (Life Technologies, Inc.). The construction was accomplished in two steps. A PCR product was first generated that corresponded to the 3′ end of Clone 1 cDNA (nt 2391 to 2780). The 5′ primer was 5′-ACTGAATTCAGCAGACTAACCTCTGGAGGGTC-3′ and contained anEcoRI restriction site. The 3′ primer was 5′-TCTACTAGTAGCTTTAGCTACTGAAGAACAAG-3′ and contained aSpeI site. The product was cleaved with SpeI andEcoRI and then cloned into corresponding sites in pTet-Splice. A plasmid clone was selected and sequenced to confirm the absence of mutations. This plasmid was then cleaved withEcoRI and BglII. To reconstitute the Lu-ECAM-1 ORF, the 2.3-kb EcoRI-BglII fragment was excised from Clone 3 and inserted into the plasmid. The resulting plasmid, pTet-Splice-Lu-ECAM-1, was then transfected into HEK293 cells along with pTet-tTAK, which encodes a transcriptional activator specific for the pTet-Splice vector. Transfection was by the LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) method according to the manufacturer instructions. Cells were harvested 24 h after the start of transfection. Control cells were transfected in parallel with a plasmid expressing rat dipeptidyl peptidase IV under control of the CMV promoter (RcCMV, Invitrogen) (22Hong W. Doyle D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 7962-7966Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). For in vitro expression, Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA Clone 1 was placed under control of the phage T7 promoter in pGEM3. The EcoRI-SpeI fragment containing Lu-ECAM-1 was excised from pTet-Splice and inserted into theEcoRI and XbaI sites of pGEM3. Plasmid DNA was translated using the TNT-coupled transcription-translation system (Promega) and [35S]methionine (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). Glycosylation was accomplished with canine pancreatic microsomes (Amersham Life Science, Inc.). The genomic DNA blot was hybridized for 14 h at 37 °C in 5 × SSC, 50% formamide, 4 × Denhardt's solution, 10% polyethylene glycol (M r = 8000) and 100 μg/ml denatured salmon testis DNA. The blot was stripped after exposure by boiling in 0.1 × SSC. For RNA blots, lung and spleen mRNA preparations were purchased from CLONTECH. Alternatively, mRNA was prepared from confluent BAEC and freshly scraped epithelium from bovine trachea using the Fast Track system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). mRNA was electrophoresed on a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel, blotted onto Nytran (Schleicher & Schuell), and hybridized overnight at 65 °C in QuickHyb solution (Stratagene). 32P-labeled probes were prepared by random priming (RadPrime kit, Life Technologies, Inc.). Radioisotopes were purchased from Amersham Life Science, Inc. Formalin-fixed sections of bovine trachea were first boiled for ten min in 4 m urea in a microwave oven and then probed with polyclonal antibody R4. The sections were incubated with biotinylated donkey anti-rat IgG and Neutravidin-peroxidase conjugate (Molecular Probes). The peroxidase conjugate was detected using diamino-benzidine as substrate and the slides were counterstained with hematoxylin. Lung sections were prepared and probed with mAb 6D3 according to Zhu et al.(12Zhu D. Pauli B.U. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 53: 628-633Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar) except that a biotinylated secondary antibody was used followed by Neutravidin-peroxidase conjugate. For RT-PCR analysis of bovine lung, spleen, tracheal epithelium, and cultured BAEC, 500 ng of each mRNA was reverse transcribed with random oligonucleotide primers and Superscript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Inc.) in a 20-μl reaction volume. Primers specific for Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA (LU primers) or Ca-CC cDNA (TC primers) were selected such that the last one, two, or three 3′ nucleotides were complementary only to the Lu-ECAM-1 or the Ca-CC cDNA sequence, respectively. The selectivity of the primers was confirmed in control experiments with a Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA clone. The primer sequences and their locations in the respective cDNA sequence are given in Table III. The cycling protocol was as follows: 94 °C, 20 s; 55 °C, 10 s; and 72 °C, 10 s, for 35 cycles with a time increment of 2 s/cycle for annealing and extension times and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min.Table IIISequences, specificity, and location of primers used for RT-PCR analysisPrimer namePolaritySpecificityNucleotide sequence3-aNucleotide sequence is given in 5′ → 3′ orientation.Location3-bLocation is given as nucleotide number of Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA sequence or Ca-CC cDNA sequence (15).LU-1UpstreamLu-ECAM-1ATGTTCAACTCATATTACTGGTAT741–764TC-1UpstreamCa-CCATGTTCAACTCATATTACTGGTAC576–599LU-2UpstreamLu-ECAM-1CACAGACAGGGCTGTATGAA827–846TC-2UpstreamCa-CCCACAGACAGGGCTGTATGAG659–678LU-3DownstreamLu-ECAM-1TGTAGGTTTGGAGCTTCTGT974–955TC-3DownstreamCa-CCTGTAGGTTTGGAGCTTCCAC806–787LU-4DownstreamLu-ECAM-1GGAGATGTATTCTGAAAGTCAAC1044–1024TC-4DownstreamCa-CCGGAGATGTATTTTGAAAGTCAGT876–8563-a Nucleotide sequence is given in 5′ → 3′ orientation.3-b Location is given as nucleotide number of Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA sequence or Ca-CC cDNA sequence (15Cunningham S.A.

Open table in a new tab Adhesion of lung-metastatic B16-F10 melanoma cells to wild-type (wtLu-ECAM-1) and recombinant Lu-ECAM-1 (rLu-ECAM-1) was tested in a static adhesion assay as described in detail elsewhere (13Zhu D. Cheng C.-F. Pauli B.U. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 1718-1724Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). wtLu-ECAM-1 and rLu-ECAM-1 were purified by immunoaffinity chromatography from extracts of BAEC and Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA (Clone 1)-transfected HEK293 cells, respectively. Proteins were used at a coating concentration of 100 μg/ml in PBS (overnight, 4 °C). The Lu-ECAM-1 complex was immunopurified from BAEC and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and silver-staining (Fig. 1). Major bands corresponded to sizes of 90, 55, 38, and 32 kDa. The amino-terminal sequence of each of the polypeptides was determined after resolution on SDS-PAGE and transfer to Immobilon. The sequences of the 38- and 32-kDa components were identical but differed from that of the 90-kDa component (Fig. 1). The 55-kDa protein was found to be an IgG contaminant. Internal peptide sequences of the 90- and 38-kDa proteins were obtained after tryptic cleavage of the respective proteins and HPLC purification of the cleavage products. The amino acid sequences of these peptides were all found in the ORF of the longest Lu-ECAM-1 cDNA as shown below (Table I). Lu-ECAM-1 cDNAs were obtained using degenerate PCR primers based on peptide sequences from the 90-, 38-, and 32-kDa polypeptides (see “Experimental Procedures”). PCR products were then extended by RACE or used as probes to isolate cDNAs from a BAEC library (schematized in Fig. 2 and detailed under “Experimental Procedures”). Four clones were obtained (Figs. 2 and 3). The first, Clone 1, was generated entirely by PCR using primers based on sequences of the 38- and 32-kDa components. Its length was 3.3 kb, and it encodes a 905-amino acid protein. Clones 2, 3, and 4 were isolated from a BAEC library using a probe based on sequences of the 90-kDa component. Clone 2 was identical to Clone 1 from nucleotide 252–2438 but diverged at the 3′ end and was incomplete at the 5′ end, lacking an initiation codon. A complete 5′-end sequence was obtained using 5′-RACE with primers corresponding to nucleotides 1599–1572 and 524–502. The ORFs of Clones 2 and 3 are identical to that of Clone 1 until amino acid 772 then diverge to yield proteins of 794 and 820 amino acids, respectively (Fig. 3). Clone 4 encodes a truncated, 321-amino acid version of Lu-ECAM-1 that may be secreted. Its derived amino acid sequence is identical to that of the other ORFs up to amino acid 303 (Fig. 3). The ORFs of all four cDNA clones contain the amino-terminal sequence of the 90-kDa component of Lu-ECAM-1 following a presumptive signal sequence of 21 amino acids. The amino-terminal sequence of the 38- and 32-kDa components lies near the carboxyl termini of the ORFs of Clones 1, 2, and 3 (Table I and Fig. 3, arrowhead). However, only the ORF of Clone 1 contains the sequence of the internal peptide (TableI and Fig. 3, residues 828–851) derived from the 38-kDa component. Hybridization of a genomic DNA blot with a Lu-ECAM-1 probe (EcoRI-BglII fragment) detected signals in all mammals tested (Fig. 4). However, searches of genetic data banks for similarity to Lu-ECAM-1 revealed only one extensive match, the chloride channel Ca-CC (GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession number U36455). Within their ORFs, the Lu-ECAM-1 Clone 1 and Ca-CC cDNAs share 92% identity at the DNA level and 88% identity at the amino acid level (aligned in Fig. 3). The differences appear randomly distributed, suggesting that Lu-ECAM-1 and Ca-CC represent products of different genes. Only one other significant match was detected in the data banks, a swine intestine partial cDNA (55% identity over 58 amino acid residues; GenBankTM/EBI Data Bank accession numberF15082). All of the ORFs predict hydrophobic amino termini (residues −21 to −1) with the features of a cleavable signal sequence (24von Heijne G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1986; 14: 4683-4690Crossref PubMed Scopus (3686) Google Scholar) preceding the mature amino terminus determined by protein sequencing (Fig. 3, double overline). Four other generally hydrophobic regions (Fig. 3, underline) were proposed by Cunningham et al. (15Cunningham S.A. Awayda M.S. Bubien J.K. Ismailov I.I. Arrate M.P. Berdiev B.K. Benos D.J. Fuller C.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31016-31026Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar) to comprise transmembrane segments in the cognate Ca-CC molecule. In particular, the hydrophobic segment starting at residue 595 conforms well to the established criteria for α-helical transmembrane segments, containing 23 amino acid residues with a total transfer free energy of 36.3 kcal/mol (25Engelman D.M. Steitz T.A. Goldman A. Ann. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1986; 15: 328-330Crossref Scopus (1195) Google Scholar). Nine potential sites exist for asparagine-linked glycosylation (Fig. 3, asterisks). The relationship between the high and low molecular weight Lu-ECAM-1 components was explored using antibodies that recognize distinct epitopes. To determine which components share the epitope for the mAb used for immunoprecipitation, affinity purified Lu-ECAM-1 was probed on an immunoblot with mAb 6D3. This antibody detected the 90-kDa component but not the 38- or 32-kDa components, indicating that the smaller components lack the epitope and are instead tightly complexed with the larger components (Fig.5 A). In addition, 6D3 detected two larger bands migrating at approximately 120- and 130-kDa, respectively, that were not clearly visible by silver staining. To determine which parts of the cDNAs correspond to which proteins, polyclonal antibodies were generated against synthetic peptides based on the cDNA sequences or against chimeric proteins obtained by expression of cDNAs in bacteria (TableII).

The effects of these individual agents paralleled their effects on mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activity, but not c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activity, in the cells. Overexpression of wild-type MAPK and, to a lesser extent, JNK increased strain-dependent BNP promoter activity, whereas dominant-negative mutants of MAPK kinase, JNK kinase, or Ras completely blocked strain-dependent reporter activity. These findings provide the first demonstration that mechanical strain can increase myocardial gene expression through a transcriptional mechanism and suggest important roles for MAPK and JNK in mediating this effect.

Overexpression of wild-type MAPK and, to a lesser extent, JNK increased strain-dependent BNP promoter activity, whereas dominant-negative mutants of MAPK kinase, JNK kinase, or Ras completely blocked strain-dependent reporter activity. These findings provide the first demonstration that mechanical strain can increase myocardial gene expression through a transcriptional mechanism and suggest important roles for MAPK and JNK in mediating this effect. The natriuretic peptides comprise a family of vasoactive hormones that play an important role in the regulation of cardiovascular and renal homeostasis (1Brenner B.M. Ballermann B.J. Gunning M.E. Zeidel M.L. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 665-699Crossref PubMed Scopus (843) Google Scholar). Their natriuretic and vasodepressor properties suggest that they represent endogenous antagonists of the various systems (e.g. renin-angiotensin system and sympathetic nervous system) that support arterial blood pressure under basal conditions and, at times, contribute to the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease.

ANP is expressed in the cardiac ventricle during development and early neonatal life (2Wei Y. Rodi C.P. Day M.L Wiegand R.C. Needleman L.D. Cole B.R. Needleman P. J. Clin.

Expression decays as the animal ages and remains quiescent in the adult unless the ventricle is subjected to hemodynamic overload (i.e. mechanical strain that leads to increased wall stress and subsequently to hypertrophy of the myocardium), as occurs with systemic arterial hypertension or congestive heart failure (4Lee R.T.

Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is also produced in the heart. Despite the nomenclature, relatively little BNP is expressed in the mammalian brain (the exception being the porcine brain, where the peptide was identified originally). Expression of BNP in the heart is lower than that of ANP under basal conditions, and the atrial/ventricular ratio of expression is considerably less than that seen with ANP (8Dagnino L. Drouin J. Nemer M. Mol. Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1292-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Ventricular expression of BNP is activated in a fashion similar to ANP in pathophysiological states associated with hemodynamic overload (9Dagnino L. Lavigne J.P. Nemer M. Hypertension (Dallas). 1992; 20: 690-700Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar,10Hasegawa K. Fujiwara H. Doyama K. Miyamae M. Fujiwara T. Suga S. Mukoyama M. Nakao K. Imura H. Sasayama S. Circulation. 1993; 88: 372-380Crossref PubMed Scopus (204) Google Scholar). At some stages of advanced congestive heart failure, circulating BNP levels may actually surpass those of ANP, implying that BNP contributes a significant fraction of circulating natriuretic peptide activity under these conditions (11Mukoyama M.

Thus, both ANP and BNP gene expression are linked to pathophysiological stimuli associated with hypertrophy in the whole animal. In vitro, the neonatal rat cardiac myocyte model responds to the activation of a number of extracellular (e.g. phenylephrine, angiotensin II, and endothelin) (14Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E.

Similarly, passive mechanical strain of cardiac ventricular myocytes in vitro, simulating that observed in the hemodynamically overloaded myocardiumin vivo, has been shown to trigger the appearance of many of the same phenotypic markers of hypertrophy, including activation of c-fos, c-jun, and the ANP gene (21Komuro I.

Moreover, antisense oligonucleotides directed against MAPK have been shown to reduce phenylephrine-dependent increments in ANP mRNA levels and ANP promoter activity while, at the same time, suppressing sarcomerogenesis and increments in cell size that typically accompany hypertrophy induced by this agent (33Glennon P.E.

This study documents activation of BNP gene expression by passive mechanical strain in the neonatal cardiac myocyte model. This increased expression is due to enhanced transcription of the BNP gene, with little contribution from changes in transcript stability. This provides the first demonstration that mechanical strain can increase expression of a myocardial specific gene through a transcriptional mechanism.

H-89 was from Seikagaku Co. (Tokyo, Japan), and the luciferase assay system was from Promega (Madison, WI). Other reagents were obtained through standard commercial suppliers. Ventricular myocytes were prepared from 1-day-old neonatal rat hearts by alternate cycles of 0.05% trypsin digestion and mechanical disruption as described previously (18Kovacic-Milivojevic B. Gardner D.G. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 292-301Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Cells (1 × 106) were cultured on collagen-coated Flex plates (Flexcell International Corp., McKeesport, PA) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H21 medium containing 10% enriched calf serum (Gemini Bioproducts, Calabasas, CA), 2 mm glutamine, 10 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The medium was changed 24 h prior to initiation of the experiment. Cells were stretched by cyclical strain (60 cycles/min) on the Flexcell Strain apparatus at a level of distension sufficient to promote an ∼20–25% increment in surface area at the point of maximal distension on the culture surface (36Banes A.J. Gilbert J. Taylor D. Monbureau O. J. Cell Sci. 1985; 75: 35-42Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The culture medium of each well was collected and centrifuged to remove cellular debris; the supernatant was taken for assay. Radioimmunoassays were performed according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer using rabbit antiserum specific for rat BNP-32 and 125I-labeled rat BNP-32. Goat anti-rabbit IgG and normal rabbit serum were used to separate bound and free ligand. Total RNA was isolated from the cultured ventricular cells by the guanidinium thiocyanate/CsCl method (37Chirgwin J.M. Przybyla A.E. Macdonald R.J. Rutter W.J. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 5294-5299Crossref PubMed Scopus (16610) Google Scholar). Fifteen μg of RNA was size-fractionated on a gel containing 2.2% formaldehyde, transferred to a nitrocellulose filter, and hybridized with a 32P-labeled 640-base pair fragment of rat BNP cDNA. Blots were subsequently washed and rehybridized with a 32P-labeled 1.3-kilobase pair glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase cDNA to normalize the blots for differences in RNA loading and/or transfer to the filter. Autoradiography was performed with an intensifying screen at −70 °C for 6–24 h. Autoradiographic signals were quantified by laser densitometry. Normalized data are presented as the ratio of BNP to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase signal. The construction of −1595 hBNP-luciferase (38LaPointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.P. Gardner D.G.

Endocrinol. 1991; 5: 1311-1322Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) has been described previously. Dominant-negative Ras (N17) was provided by W. Fantl, and glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun by J. Hambleton. HA-MAPK and HA-SAPK expression vectors and dominant-negative MEK and SEK were provided by M. Karin. Freshly prepared ventricular myocytes were transiently transfected with the indicated reporters and expression vectors (Gene-Pulser, Bio-Rad) at 280 mV and 250 microfarads. Individual cultures were normalized for DNA content with pUC18. After transfection, cells were plated in 6-well collagen-coated Flex plates at a density of 1 × 106cells/well in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's/H21 medium containing 10% enriched calf serum. The medium was changed 24 h after plating, and cyclical strain was applied. Cells were harvested and lysed in 60 μl of 250 mm Tris and 0.1% Triton X-100. The protein concentration of each cell extract was measured using Coomassie protein reagent (Pierce). Cell lysates were processed for either luciferase (30 μg of protein/sample) or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (60 μg of protein/sample) measured as described previously (19Kovacic-Milivojevic B. Wang V.S.H. Gardner D.G. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 1108-1117Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 38LaPointe M.C. Wu G. Garami M. Yang X.P. Gardner D.G. Hypertension (Dallas). 1996; 27: 715-722Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To ensure reproducibility, experiments were repeated three to five times, using at least three different plasmid DNA preparations. Transfection efficiency, assessed from measurements of pRSVCAT activity, varied by <15% within a given experiment. The cells were harvested in 1 ml of lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.9, 137 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1 mm β-glycerophosphate, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.5 μg/ml aprotinin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 30 min. Two-hundred μg of supernatant protein was incubated with 1 μg of anti-ERK2, anti-JNK1, or anti-HA antibody and 10 μl of protein G-Sepharose for 2 h at 4 °C. The immunoprecipitates were recovered by centrifugation and washed three times with cell lysis buffer and once with kinase reaction buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mmMnCl2, and 1 mm dithiothreitol) without ATP. Activities of MAPK and JNK were measured by adding 20 μg of myelin basic protein or 5 μg of glutathione S-transferase-c-Jun, respectively, to the immunoprecipitates in 30 μl of kinase reaction buffer containing 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP. Reactions were incubated for 15 min at 30 °C. The samples were electrophoresed on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, which were then dried and subjected to autoradiography. Signals were identified and quantified by densitometric scanning of the autoradiographs. Data were evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with Newman-Keuls test for significance. Mechanical strain, applied in cyclical fashion (1 Hz with 30 s of strain followed by 30 s of membrane relaxation), increased BNP release into the culture media (Fig.1 A). This effect was first seen after 6 h of incubation and was maximal (∼160% of that in the static cultures) after 48 h of incubation. This was accompanied by an increase in BNP gene expression (Fig.1 B). Steady-state levels of the BNP transcript were differentially increased in the stretched versus static cultures after 6 h of treatment, and this difference persisted throughout the remainder of the experiment (48 h). BNP mRNA levels were not significantly changed in the static cultures during the course of the experiment. To probe the mechanism underlying the elevation in BNP transcript levels, we transfected a chimeric reporter (−1595 hBNP-luciferase) containing 1595 base pairs of hBNP 5′-flanking sequence into freshly isolated neonatal ventricular myocytes. The transfectants were cultured for 24 h and then subjected to cyclical strain or the static environment for 12–72 h. As shown in Fig.2 A, strain increased expression of the reporter construct by ∼2-fold relative to the static cultures. The increase was first discernible after 24 h and peaked 48 h following application of strain. This suggests that the increase in BNP gene expression derives, at least in part, from enhanced transcription of the gene and that the regulatory elements responsible for promoting this increase are present with the ∼1600 base pairs of DNA lying immediately upstream from the transcription start site. Of note, a transfected −1150 hANP-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase reporter was not activated by mechanical strain applied over a similar 48-h period (static: 1860 ± 282 cpm; strain: 2088 ± 513 cpm; n = 4), confirming the previous findings of Sadoshima et al. (22Sadoshima J. Jahn L. Takahashi T. Kulik T.J. Izumo S. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10551-10560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). BNP mRNA is known to harbor a number of putative destabilizing regulatory elements within its 3′-untranslated region (40Sudoh T. Maekawa B. Kojima M. Minamino N. Kangawa K. Matsuo H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 159: 1427-1434Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). It has been hypothesized, although not proven, that these elements are responsible for the short half-life (<1 h) that this transcript exhibits in the intact cardiac myocyte (16Hanford D.S. Thuerauf D.J. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26227-26233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The abbreviated lifespan of this transcript, which clearly distinguishes it from ANP (half-life of ∼12–24 h) (16Hanford D.S. Thuerauf D.J. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26227-26233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Gardner D.G. Gertz B.J. Deschepper C.F. Kim D.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1988; 823: 1275-1281Crossref Scopus (77) Google Scholar), may represent a potentially important locus for regulating steady-state levels of BNP mRNA. Hanford et al. (16Hanford D.S. Thuerauf D.J. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26227-26233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) demonstrated that the α-adrenergic agonist phenylephrine, a well described effector of hypertrophy in thisin vitro model (14Iwaki K. Sukhatme V.P. Shubeita H.E. Chien K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 13809-13817Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), not only increased BNP gene transcription, but stabilized the mature transcript as well. To assess the possibility of an independent effect of strain on transcript stability, we used actinomycin D to arrest transcription in these ventricular cardiocyte cultures and followed the decay of the BNP transcript in the presence or absence of mechanical strain. As shown in Fig. 2 B, subjecting cells to cyclical strain in the absence of actinomycin D led to the expected increase in BNP mRNA levels. When actinomycin D was introduced concomitantly with the strain stimulus, the induction was lost; however, transcript levels fell steadily and equivalently in the static versus strained cultures. Thus, in contrast to observations made in the setting of phenylephrine-induced hypertrophy (16Hanford D.S. Thuerauf D.J. Murray S.F. Glembotski C.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26227-26233Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the half-life of the BNP transcript (∼12 h in this study) was unaffected by strain.

As shown in Fig. 3, transcription was inhibited by antagonists of protein kinase C (chelerythrine), MAPK (2-aminopurine), MEK (PD98059), tyrosine kinase (genistein), and calmodulin (W-7). KN-62, a calcium/calmodulin kinase inhibitor, partially reversed the strain effect. Neither wortmannin, an inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, nor H-89, a protein kinase A antagonist, affected reporter activity. Measurement of MAPK (Fig.4 A) using an immune complex kinase assay (42Sugimoto T. Haneda M. Togawa M. Isono M. Shikano T. Araki S. Nakagawa T. Kashiwagi A. Guan K. Kikkawa R. J. Biol.

Measurement of JNK/SAPK activity (Fig. 4 B) using the same approach showed that several inhibitors that nearly completely suppressed strain-dependent BNP promoter activity had little or no effect on strain-dependent SAPK activity (e.g.chelerythrine, 2-aminopurine, and PD98059), whereas KN-62, which was only marginally effective in suppressing the hBNP promoter, almost completely blocked strain-dependent JNK/SAPK activity.Figure 4Effect of mechanical strain on MAPK (A) and JNK (B) activities in cultured ventricular myocytes.

The translation product contains a 24-residue signal peptide preceding the mature α4 chain of 1,792 residues. Northern analysis on whole mouse embryos revealed that the expression was weak at day 7, but it later increased and peaked at day 15. In adult tissues the strongest expression was observed in lung and cardiac and skeletal muscles. Weak expression was also seen in other adult tissues such as brain, spleen, liver, kidney, and testis. By in situ hybridization of fetal and newborn tissues, expression of the laminin α4 chain was mainly localized to mesenchymal cells. Strong expression was seen in the villi and submucosa of the developing intestine, the mesenchymal stroma surrounding the branching lung epithelia, and the external root sheath of vibrissae follicles, as well as in cardiac and skeletal muscle fibers. In the developing kidney, intense but transient expression was associated with the differentiation of epithelial kidney tubules from the nephrogenic mesenchyme. Immunohistologic staining with affinity-purified IgG localized the laminin α4 chain primarily to lung septa, heart, and skeletal muscle, capillaries, and perineurium.

The different laminin chains are composed of specific modules that include domains with globular structures, rod-like domains containing cysteine-rich repeats, and domains participating in the coiled coil of the long arm. Additionally, the α chains contain a large carboxyl-terminal globular domain with five internal repeat motifs that share homology with corresponding motifs in perlecan (29Noonan D.M. Horigan E.A.

FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2477-2481Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).Numerous functions have been proposed for laminins (for review, see Refs. 1Engel J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10643-10651Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 4Timpl R. Brown J. Matrix Biol. 1994; 14: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar, and 34Kleinman H.K.

Biochem. 1985; 27: 317-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (359) Google Scholar), but the physiological roles of the different isoforms are still largely unknown. However, the laminin subunit chains differ extensively with respect to their distribution suggesting tissue-specific functions. Insight into the functions of individual chains and isoforms has come particularly from studies on genetic diseases and by targeted gene disruption in mice. First, in epidermolysis bullosa junctionalis, a skin blistering disease, mutations have been described in all three human genes encoding the subunit chains of the laminin-5 isoform (α3β3γ2) (35Pulkkinen L.

Burgeson R.E. Pittelkow M.R. Uitto J. Genomics. 1994; 24: 357-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). This demonstrates the requirement of this hemidesmosomal protein for the attachment of epithelial cells to the underlying matrix. Secondly, defects involving the gene for the α2 chain (LAMA2) have been described in dy mice (39Xu H. Wu X.-R. Wewer U.M. Engvall E. Nat. Genet. 1994; 8: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (321) Google Scholar) and in patients with congenital muscular dystrophy (40Helbling-Leclerc A. Zhang X. Topaoglu H. Cruaud C. Jesson F. Weissenbach J. Tomé F.M.S. Schwartz K. Fardeau M. Tryggvason K. Guicheney P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 11: 216-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). This suggests that this chain, a component of the laminin-2 isoform (α2β1γ1), is important for the differentiation or function of muscle fibers. Thirdly, the requirement of the laminin β2 chain for a functional glomerular filtration barrier has been demonstrated by the development of proteinuria-associated nephropathy in mice with inactivated gene (LAMB2−/−) (41Noakes P. Miner J.H. Gautam M. Cunningham J.M. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). However, the actual chain composition of the GBM laminin isoform containing the β2 chain is not known.The development of nephrons, the filtration units of the kidney, involves a specific interplay of signaling between the epithelial cells of the ureter bud and the surrounding mesenchymal cells (42Gilbert S.F. Developmental Biology. 3rd Ed. Sinauer Associates, Sunderland, MA1991: 582-590Google Scholar, 43Ekblom P. FASEB J. 1989; 3: 2141-2150Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). During this process, the epithelial cells induce condensation and polarization of the mesenchyme at the tip of the ureter bud. This group of mesenchymal cells undergoes transepithelialization to form an S-shaped mass referred to as the S body. Later, the S body fuses to the ureter bud. Eventually, the S body gives rise to the proximal and distal parts of the tubular system, as well as to the epithelial component of the glomeruli, i.e. cells covering the inside of the Bowman's capsule and the podocytes that cover the outside of the glomerular capillaries. It has been shown earlier that the expression of laminin genes is subject to characteristic changes in the developing kidney. Specifically, α1 chain expression is absent in the undifferentiated mesenchyme, but it is turned on concomitantly with the start of differentiation and polarization of the mesenchyme (44Ekblom M. Klein G. Mugrauer G. Fecker L. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Cell. 1990; 60: 337-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Furthermore, the α1 chain is expressed in the epithelial cells of the ureter bud and the tubules that form the loops of Henle (44Ekblom M. Klein G. Mugrauer G. Fecker L. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Cell. 1990; 60: 337-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar).The function and expression of the laminin α4 chain is still poorly known. We have previously reported the sequence of the human laminin α4 chain, but thorough studies on developmental expression of this protein are difficult in human tissues. In the present study we have cloned the murine α4 chain, determined its primary structure, and examined its developmental expression in mouse tissues. Furthermore, polyclonal antibodies were made against the α4 chain and used for immunolocalization of the protein in murine tissues. The results showed the α4 chain to be located mainly in lung, around heart muscle fibers, and in capillary basement membranes as well as in perineurium.DISCUSSIONThe present work describes the full sequence of the mouse laminin α4 subunit chain. Importantly, the clones isolated in this study facilitated thorough studies on the temporal and spatial expression of this chain, which was shown to have a highly restricted expression pattern during mouse development.Comparison of the mouse α4 chain sequence with that of human one revealed a sequence identity of 88.1%. Of the 44 cysteines and 19 potential N-linked glycosylation sites in the mature polypeptide, 43 and 18 are conserved, respectively. It is of interest that although the total length of the mouse and human chains is identical, in the alignment there are two balancing 2-residue gaps located in the G-domain. The significance of these gaps is not clear, but it is possible that the structural constraints posed by the folded polypeptide chain allow some variation at these sites. The first gap is close to the boundary between domains I/II and G, and the second gap is located between the third and fourth subdomains of the G domain. In thedrosophila α-chain, a spacer sequence of threonines and serines lies between these subdomains (52Garrison K. Mackrell A.J. Fessler J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 22899-22904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 53Kusche-Gullberg M. Garrison K. MacKrell A.J. Fessler L.I. Fessler J.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4519-4527Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar).In general, tissue distribution of the laminin α4 chain was shown to extensively differ from that of the other laminin α chains. The α4 chain is predominantly located in lung alveolar septa, around heart muscle fibers, in the perineurium, as well as in subendothelial basement membranes of capillaries. In contrast, the α1 chain is expressed mainly in the central nervous system, and in the developing kidney (44Ekblom M. Klein G. Mugrauer G. Fecker L. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Cell. 1990; 60: 337-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 54Klein G. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Development. 1990; 110: 823-837PubMed Google Scholar). Expression of the α1 chain is also seen in developing lung and gut epithelium (54Klein G. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Development. 1990; 110: 823-837PubMed Google Scholar), but the expression is never mesenchymal as was shown to be the case for the α4 chain in the present study. The α2 chain is expressed predominantly by skeletal and heart muscle cells (11Bernier S.M. Utani A. Sugiyama S. Doi T. Polistina C. Yamada Y. Matrix Biol. 1995; 14: 447-455Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar, 55Engvall E. Earwicker D. Haaparanta T. Ruoslahti E. Sanes J.R. Cell Regul. 1990; 1: 731-740Crossref PubMed Scopus (297) Google Scholar, 56Sanes J. Engvall E. Butkowski R. Hunter D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1685-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Although the α2 chain is expressed in mesenchymal cells in several tissues during human embryonic development, the expression pattern is different from that of the α4 chain (10Vuolteenaho R. Nissinen M. Sainio K. Byers M. Eddy R. Hirvonen H. Shows T.B. Sariola H. Engvall E. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). Here, the α4 chain was shown to differ from a2 as α4 is present around adult cardiac but not skeletal muscle fibers. However, the α4 chain is expressed in fetal skeletal muscle fibers as determined by in situ hybridization and is present around these fibers in embryos and newborn mice as shown by immunohistochemical staining. Therefore, the developmentally regulated α4 chain may be of importance for the development of skeletal muscle and for function during early development. The α2 and α4 chains also differ from each other in that the α2 chain is expressed in the developing human kidney in the mesenchyme adjacent to the condensing pretubular epithelia, while α4 is absent in this region (10Vuolteenaho R. Nissinen M. Sainio K. Byers M. Eddy R. Hirvonen H. Shows T.B. Sariola H. Engvall E. Tryggvason K. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 381-394Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar).Although the α4 chain is structurally most closely related to the α3 chain, their tissue distribution is very different. The α3 chain is epithelial. It is seen in the epithelium of skin, lung, and digestive tract, but never in the mesenchyme (57Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Baudoin C. Galliano M.-F. Ortonne J.-P. Meneguzzi G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). In contrast, the α4 chain is mainly mesenchymal and endothelial. In addition, the enamel organ shows strong signals for the α3 chain (57Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Baudoin C. Galliano M.-F. Ortonne J.-P. Meneguzzi G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar), but we did not see any signals above background for the α4 chain in the developing teeth (not shown). The newly discovered α5 chain is strongly expressed in the adult kidney (16Miner J.H. Lewis R.M. Sanes J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28523-28526Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) where the level of α4 chain expression is very low. There is little evidence for the presence of the other α chains in several mesenchymal tissues, i.e.in lung and intestine, where we see the α4 chain expressed (10Vuolteenaho R. Nissinen M. Sainio K.

Genomics. 1996; 32: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). These tissues do express β1 and γ1 chains (54Klein G. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Development. 1990; 110: 823-837PubMed Google Scholar, 56Sanes J. Engvall E. Butkowski R. Hunter D.D. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 1685-1699Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar), but not β3 or γ2 (57Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Baudoin C. Galliano M.-F. Ortonne J.-P. Meneguzzi G. Cell Adhes. Commun. 1994; 2: 115-129Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in the embryonic kidney the mesenchyme adjacent to the ureter bud lacks β2, β3, and γ2 chain expression (41Noakes P. Miner J.H. Gautam M. Cunningham J.M. Sanes J.R. Merlie J.P. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 400-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar, 57Aberdam D. Aguzzi A. Baudoin C. Galliano M.-F. Ortonne J.-P.

Genomics. 1996; 32: 54-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), while it gives strong signals for the β1 and γ1 chains (44Ekblom M. Klein G. Mugrauer G. Fecker L. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Cell. 1990; 60: 337-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 54Klein G. Ekblom M. Fecker L. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Development. 1990; 110: 823-837PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that the α4 chain associates in these tissues with the β1 and γ1 chains to form the eighth laminin isoform. However, this and the other possible chain combinations involving the α4 chain remain to be determined.The subendothelial location of the α4 chain suggests that the laminin isoform containing it may serve as an adhesion protein for endothelial cells in a similar manner as the α3 chain containing laminin-5 (59Rousselle P. Lundstrum G.P. Keene D.R. Burgeson R.E. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (658) Google Scholar). However, it is apparent that α4 chain containing laminin isoforms have broader physiological functions, as this polypeptide chain is also so prominent in striatic muscle fibers and peripheral nerves. The unique expression pattern of the laminin α4 chain during a special period of nephrogenesis, i.e. the formation of the proximal nephron, implies specific temporal requirements for a laminin isoform containing the α4 chain. The α1 chain may also be important for the formation of the proximal nephron, but it is apparently also important for the formation and maturation of the entire nephron as it has a unique expression pattern in the distal parts of the tubuli (44Ekblom M. Klein G. Mugrauer G. Fecker L. Deutzmann R. Timpl R. Ekblom P. Cell. 1990; 60: 337-346Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Expression of both chains decreases in the kidney with age.Thus far, no diseases have been linked to the genes for the α1, α4, or α5 chains, as is the case for the α2 and α3 chain genes that are affected in congenital muscular dystrophy and epidermolysis bullosa, respectively (35Pulkkinen L.

However, based on the wide distribution of the laminin α4 chain, it can be anticipated that mutations in its gene can lead to severe complications and diseases. The generation of transgenic mice containing an interrupted LAMA4 gene may shed light on the role of this interesting laminin component. The laminins are a complex family of trimeric extracellular matrix proteins (1Engel J. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10643-10651Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar, 2Tryggvason K. Curr. Opin.

The different laminin chains are composed of specific modules that include domains with globular structures, rod-like domains containing cysteine-rich repeats, and domains participating in the coiled coil of the long arm. Additionally, the α chains contain a large carboxyl-terminal globular domain with five internal repeat motifs that share homology with corresponding motifs in perlecan (29Noonan D.M. Horigan E.A.

It could be shown that phage particles displaying the natural ligand α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone bind selectively to cells expressing this receptor and that these phages exhibit biological activity on mouse B16F1 melanoma cells. Insect cells were superior to other cell lines tested and have been used to select binders from a small library, in which critical determinants (Phe7-Arg8-Trp9) were kept, whereas the flanking regions where allowed to variate freely. One peptide displaying little similarity with native hormone was found that binds to the receptor also in its free form with an affinity of 7 nm. It showed a remarkable selectivity for this receptor, because it binds to the other melanocortin receptor subtypes with a maximum affinity of 21 μm. This is the first time phage display has been used successfully with G-protein-coupled receptors lacking an extracellular binding domain.

Phage display techniques, i.e. the display of libraries of peptides, enzymes, antibodies, and other proteins on the surface of bacteriophages and selection of functional sequences thereof, have undergone a rapid development (1Kay B. Winter J. McCafferty J. Phage Display of Peptides and Proteins: A Laboratory Manual. Academic Press, San Diego1996Google Scholar, 2Cortese R. Monaci P. Nicosia A. Luzzago A. Felici F. Galfre G.

Biol. 1989; 251: 215-218PubMed Google Scholar), phage display is today in use for almost any kind of problem that involves the interaction of peptides and proteins with other materials. Most of the published literature deals with the development of antibodies (6Clackson T. Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Winter G. Nature. 1991; 352: 624-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (977) Google Scholar, 7Hoogenboom H.R. Griffiths A.D. Johnson K.S. Chiswell D.J. Hudson P. Winter G.

Biol. 1991; 222: 581-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1420) Google Scholar). With the use of this technique one comes close to the power of the human immune system. Other milestones were the display of enzymes (9McCafferty J. Jackson R.H. Chiswell D.J. Protein Eng. 1991; 4: 955-961Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar), enzyme inhibitors (10Roberts B.L. Markland W. Siranosian K. Saxena M.J. Guterman S.K. Ladner R.C. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 121: 9-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), hormones (11Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholar), and cloning of active protein domains (12Jacobsson K. Frykberg L. BioTechniques. 1995; 18: 878-885PubMed Google Scholar), to list only a few applications. Among the numerous publications about the display of hormones there are only a few dealing with the bioactivity of the phage (for examples see Refs. 13Saggio I. Gloaguen I. Laufer R. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 152: 35-39Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar and 14Gram H. Strittmatter U. Lorenz M. Gluck D. Zenke G. J. Immunol. Methods. 1993; 161: 169-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), because in almost all cases purified domains of cell surface receptors are used for the selection of binders from libraries (for examples see Refs. 11Lowman H.B. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 564-578Crossref PubMed Scopus (219) Google Scholarand 15Saggio I. Gloaguen I. Poiana G. Laufer R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 3045-3054Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Only a very few successful experiments are published with receptors displayed on living cells and in all such cases the receptors bind the ligands with extracellular domains (16Doorbar J. Winter G. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 244: 361-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 17Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kaufman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Combinatorial Libraries: Synthesis, Screening and Application Potential. deGruyter, Berlin1995: 159-174Google Scholar). The selection of random libraries of small peptides is naturally rendered more difficult when working with impure target proteins. Libraries of larger protein ligands usually contain common structural features directing and restricting binding of phages to the intended target. Especially G-protein-coupled receptors for small ligands that bind the ligands within their transmembrane helices have been the exclusive target for chemical peptide and other compound libraries (19Dooley C.T. Houghten R.A. Life Sci. 1993; 52: 1509-1517Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar, 20Dooley C.T. Chung N.N. Wilkes B.C. Schiller P.W. Bidlack J.M. Pasternak G.W. Houghten R.A.

These can be analyzed and deconvoluted by other means than just the affinity of the compounds, as has been shown for example for the MC1 receptor (24Quillan J.M. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2894-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), but they lack the complexity of bacteriophage displayed libraries. Because these receptors have not yet been purified in quantities and in a quality sufficient for the standard panning of phages, the selection on isolated membranes or whole cells remains the only possibility. Good candidates for studying whether phage panning on such receptors is possible in principle against these odds are the recently cloned melanocortin receptors. Some of their ligands, the family of melanocortin peptides, have been known already for a long time for their effects on pigmentation in melanocytes (α-MSH) 1The abbreviations used are: α-MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; gpIII, product of bacteriophage fd geneIII; MC, melanocortin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. 1The abbreviations used are: α-MSH, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone; gpIII, product of bacteriophage fd geneIII; MC, melanocortin; PCR, polymerase chain reaction. and for regulation of steroid production in the adrenal gland (adrenocorticotropic hormone). Already in early studies it was recognized that they display numerous other effects (25O'Donahue T.L. Dorsa D.M. Peptides. 1982; 3: 353-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 26Eberle A.N. The Melanotropins; Chemistry, Physiology and Mechanisms of Action. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1988: 210-319Google Scholar), which is now confirmed and explained by molecular cloning of different receptor subtypes. The first receptor to be cloned was the melanocortin receptor (MC1) of the melanocytes, soon followed by the identification of the adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor of the adrenal gland (MC2) and three other receptor subtypes (MC3, MC4, and MC5) with initially unknown functions (27Chhajlani V.

Intense studies have been carried out on the characterization and identification of residues involved in binding of the receptors, and the synthesis of numerous natural and unnatural peptides have been tried to achieve peptides with selectivity for a single receptor (24Quillan J.M. Jayawickreme C.K. Lerner M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2894-2898Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar, 41Hruby V.J. Lu D. Sharma S.D. Castrucci A.L. Kesterson R.A.

Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1994; 269: 331-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). A common and essential motif of natural MSH peptides is a stretch of four amino acids (His6-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9) believed to be essential for binding, an usually short N terminus preceding this sequence, and a less size-restricted C-terminal sequence (26Eberle A.N. The Melanotropins; Chemistry, Physiology and Mechanisms of Action. Karger, Basel, Switzerland1988: 210-319Google Scholar). These are features that should allow the design of phage libraries, where the C terminus is linked to the phage protein. It should also be possible to improve the selection procedure by using only partially randomized sequences with the motif His6-Phe7-Arg8-Trp9 or parts thereof. This should restrict specific phage binding to the receptor protein. This report shows that phages displaying an α-MSH-gpIII fusion protein bind specifically to cells expressing the MC1 receptor and even retain a biological activity. A selection system based on heterologously expressed receptors on the cell surface was established and was exploited to select novel peptides specific for the MC1 receptor from a phage display library.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 4133-4137Crossref PubMed Scopus (888) Google Scholar), were used in this study. The plasmids were cut with EcoRI/SmaI and PstI/XhoI, respectively. PCR reactions were carried out in 100-μl volumes with 5 μm dNTPs and 2 units of Vent or exo −-Vent-polymerase (Biolabs) in the buffer supplied with the enzymes. In a typical PCR reaction about 500 ng of template DNA and 20 pmol of each primer were used. The PCR reactions were carried out in a Biometra Trio PCR cycler using the following cycling: three cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 48 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 6 min; seventeen cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 6 min); and then one cycle of 72 °C for 10 min. The primers were kinased with T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim) prior to PCR. The oligonucleotides used in this study were MS-4pcr (5′AACAGGTTTACCCCAACGGAAGTGCTCCATAGAGTAAGAGGCCATGGCTGGTTGGGCAGC-3′) and MS-5pcr (5′-VNNVNNVNNVNNCCAACGGAAVNNVNNVNNVNNVNNAGAGGCCATGGCTGGTTGGGCAGCGAGTA-3′) (N = A, C, G, or T; V = A, C, or G) with a 3′ sequence complementary to the pelB leader sequence gene in both vectors and cp3–1 (5′-CCCGGGGCCGCATAGACTGTT-3′) and cp3–198 (5′-CCCGGGGGCGGTGGCTCTCCA-3′) partially complementary to the 5′ region of geneIII in the vectors pG3H6 and pComb3d, respectively. PCR products were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis (46Boyle J.S. Lew A.M. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Ligation reactions were carried out with T4 ligase at a DNA concentration of 4–6 μg/ml in 500-μl volumes at 15 °C overnight. For standard transformation a simple one-step procedure was used (47Chung C.T. Miller R.H. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 218: 621-627Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). For library construction the ligation products (3 μg) were purified on a silica support (JetPure, Genomed) and used for 12 individual electroporations of XL1-Blue using Electroporator II (InVitrogen) according to the manufacturer's descriptions. All media used were ISO approved and obtained from Difco or Oxoid. To avoid counterselection due to overexpression of the gpIII fusion protein only freshly transformed bacteria were used. Precultures of XL1-Blue harboring the phagemid were grown in Antibiotic-Medium-3 with 30 μg/ml tetracycline and 250 μg/ml ampicillin at 37 °C. dYT medium (10 g/liter yeast extract, 16 g/liter BactoTryptone, 5 g/liter NaCl) with ampicillin was inoculated 1:100 with this culture, and library transformed cells were directly added to about 200 ml in a 1-liter erlenmeyer flask. At anA 555 of 0.5–0.7 the culture was superinfected at a multiplicity of infection of 5 with low titer M13KO7 (48Vieira J. Messing J. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 153: 3-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (1998) Google Scholar) prepared as in Ref. 49Szardenings M. Collins J. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 94: 1-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar. After 1 h, kanamycin (30 μg/ml) and optionally isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside (0.5 mm) were added. The culture was shaken an additional 8–12 h, the bacteria were removed carefully in 1–2 centrifugation steps, and phages were precipitated in the cold by addition of ¼ volume filtered 20% PEG6000, 2.5 m NaCl and centrifugation at 20,000 ×g. The resulting phage pellet was resuspended in 110of the original volume 100 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), centrifuged to remove insoluble debris, precipitated a second time, and finally resuspended in 1100 of the original volume HEPES buffer. These phage preparations did not disturb the growth of HEK293 or COS-1 cells if diluted 1:500 in cell culture medium. Aliquots of purified libraries were stored at −70 °C with 50% glycerol. The melanocortin receptors were cloned into pZeoSV (InVitrogen). The resulting vectors were used for transformation of the mammalian cell lines HEK293 (50Graham F.L. Smiley J. Russell W.C. Nairn R. J. Gen. Virol. 1977; 36: 59-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (3446) Google Scholar) and COS-1 (51Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1449) Google Scholar) using liposomes (52Campbell M.J.

Pharmacol. 1996; 314: 381-384Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Cells were cultivated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 10% fetal calf serum at 7% CO2. Transfected cell lines were kept under selection of 180 μg/ml, respectively, 250 μg/ml zeocin for at least 2–3 days. COS-1 cells could even be distributed two or three times under selection pressure without loss of receptors. Sf9 (54Smith G.E. Ju G. Ericson B.L. Moschera J. Lahm H.W. Chizzonite R.

Peptides were synthesized on a Pioneer Peptide Synthesis System (PerSeptive Biosystems) and purified by high pressure liquid chromatography. The molecular weight of the peptides was confirmed by mass spectrometry. B16F1 cells expressing the mMC1 receptor (56Lunec J. Pieron C. Thody A.J. Melanoma Res. 1992; 2: 5-12Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) were grown as above. Cells were detached from almost confluent adherent cultures and incubated for 30–60 min at 37 °C in ordinary growth medium containing 0.5 mm of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor 3-iso-butyl-1-methyl-xanthine. 50-μl aliquots of the hormone dilutions in growth medium were prepared in 1.5-ml tubes and placed in a water bath at 37 °C. For the stimulation about 3 × 105 cells in 450 μl were quickly added to each tube to obtain immediate mixing. After 20 min, 50 μl of 4.4m perchloric acid were added, mixed, neutralized after a few minutes by the addition of 50 μl of base (5 m KOH, 1m Tris), and centrifuged. The determination of cAMP in the resulting supernatant was carried out as described (57Nordstedt C. Fredholm B.B. Anal. Biochem. 1990; 189: 231-234Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar). All binding and selection experiments with phages as well as radio ligand competition experiments were carried out in buffers and under conditions as described previously for COS-1 (37Schiöth H.B.

Phage binding experiments were usually carried out with total phagemid titers of 1 × 109 colony-forming units/ml. For competition experiments with pGEM7 (Promega) phagemid solution usually contained about 2% pMS4-23 or pMS4-26. 2.5 × 106 insect cells or 1 × 106 COS-1 were incubated at 37 °C gently shaken in a water bath in 4 ml of phage suspension in binding buffer (Ref. 37Schiöth H.B. Muceniece R. Wikberg J.E.S. Chhajlani V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. Mol. Pharm. Sect. 1995; 288: 311-317Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, minimal essential medium with proteinase inhibitors) for 30 min. The cells were washed four times with 4 ml of binding buffer after centrifugation at a maximum of 1000 × g for 10 min. Finally only 1 ml of binding buffer was added, and the incubation was extended to 30 min. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5000 × g, and aliquots of the cell pellet and this final supernatant were used to infect logarithmic cultures of XL1-blue at different dilutions. After 30 min of incubation at 37 °C, the bacteria were plated on agar plates containing 250 μg/ml ampicillin, 0.5 mm isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, and 40 μg/ml X-Gal. Blue/white colonies were counted after 20 h of incubation in the dark at 37 °C. In library panning the entire cell pellet was used to infect 100 ml of XL1-blue atA 555 = 0.4–0.6 and grown as described above. For library analysis an aliquot was plated on agar plates containing 250 μg/ml ampicillin 1–2 h after the infection. To display α-MSH in an active form on bacteriophages constructs were made by long inverse PCR amplification of the entire plasmids. Although we are still not satisfied with the quality of the DNA obtained, other groups recently applied a similar approach for codon mutagenesis (58Eisinger D.P. Trumpower B.L. BioTechniques. 1996; 22: 250-254Crossref Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and deletions (59Hidajat R. McNicol P. BioTechniques. 1997; 22: 32-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), indicating that this still could be a useful approach for the generation of peptide libraries in smaller vectors. Two constructs were made originally, based on the vectors pG3H6 (45Jacobsson K. Jonsson H. Lindmark H. Guss B. Lindberg M. Frykberg L. Microbiol. Res. 1997; 152: 1-8Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and a pComb3 derivative (43Barbas C. Kang A.S. Lerner R.A. Benkovic S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 7978-7982Crossref PubMed Scopus (1021) Google Scholar, 44Widersten M. Mannervik B. J. Mol. Biol. 1995; 250: 115-122Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) fusing the sequence of human α-MSH to the N terminus (pMS4-23 from pG3H6) and amino acid 198 (pMS4-26 from pComb3d) of bacteriophage fd geneIII as outlined in Fig.1. Cyclizing the PCR product with DNA ligase resulted in vectors containing no additional sequences above those needed for the phage display. pMS4-23 behaved similarly to pMS4-26, but we did not study this construct in great detail, because it turned out to be difficult to obtain clean phage preparations due to lysis of the bacterial host. Both constructs required induction by isopropyl β-d-thiogalactoside, otherwise no enrichment on cells expressing the MC1 receptor was found (data not shown). The phagemids obtained were tested for specific binding to the hMC1 receptor heterologously expressed in the mammalian cell lines HEK293 and COS-1, as well as baculovirus-infected insect cells. We tried to improve the amounts of receptor generally obtained in our laboratory in mammalian cell culture using the vector pZEO-SV (InVitrogen). COS-1 cells expressing the large SV40 antigen maintained this plasmid due to its SV40 origin and could be replated at least three times under selection without loss of receptor expression, reducing the experimental effort involved in the transfection of cells, but these procedures did not improve the number of binding sites significantly above levels published earlier (40Schiöth H.B. Kuusinen A. Muceniece R. Szardenings M. Keinänen K. Wikberg J.E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Insect cells infected with baculovirus v508-6 (40Schiöth H.B. Kuusinen A. Muceniece R. Szardenings M. Keinänen K. Wikberg J.E.S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1996; 221: 807-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) turned out to express at least the same number of receptors per cell, although they are substantially smaller in size. 2M. Szardenings, unpublished results. Because panning with adherently growing cells failed, gentle centrifugation of detached cells had to be used instead. HEK293 cells lysed during these procedures. COS-1 cells were more stable and used for more intensive studies together with different insect cell lines. The binding experiments were carried out with pMS4-26 in direct competition with a 50-fold excess of phagemids derived from pGEM7, which allowed easy evaluation of the binding experiments after infecting Escherichia coli XL1-blue and counting blue (pGEM7) and white colonies on X-Gal plates (TableI). Because incubation in the final washing step for more than 1 h was not sufficient to remove the majority of bound phage, we used also the resuspended cell pellet to infect XL1-blue. The addition of the MC1 ligand [Nle4,d-Phe7]α-MSH (2 μm) had no effect on phage elution in the final step, but the same concentration did abolish all enrichment when applied in the first incubation step (data not shown). This is not unusual for this receptor, because the complexes of the MC1 receptor with natural and synthetic ligands also exhibit high stability and low dissociation constants (60Haskell-Luevano C. Miwa H. Dickinson C. Hadley M.E. Hruby V.J. Yamada T. Gantz I. J. Med. Chem. 1996; 39: 432-435Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In general only a very weak enrichment of pMS4-26 phage particles over pGEM7 on COS-1 expressing the receptor could be seen. This may be caused by a high unspecific binding of phage particles to the membranes under the conditions used for selection, and a similar tendency had been found earlier (17Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kaufman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). Recently published data about peptides selected on insect cells revealed a strong preference for sequences containing tryptophan and arginine as present in all displayed peptides (18Doyle M.V. Doyle L.V. Fong S. Goodson R.J. Panganiban L. Drummond R. Winter J. Rosenberg S. Cortese R. Combinatorial Libraries: Synthesis, Screening and Application Potential. deGruyter, Berlin1995: 159-174Google Scholar). There seemed to be a slight enrichment of pMS4-26 on insect cells without the MC1 receptor, but the statistics of these data were weak and seemed not to rectify alternating library selection on insect cells and mammalian cells as had been necessary to obtain ligands for the urokinase receptor (17Goodson R.J. Doyle M.V. Kaufman S.E. Rosenberg S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7129-7133Crossref PubMed Scopus (197) Google Scholar). The difference of binding on Sf9 and High Five cells may simply be due to a slightly higher expressional level found with the latter. These expression levels vary even within our lab, and the conclusion that those cells are in general better should not be drawn from these data.Table IEnrichment of pMS4–26 phagemids over pGEM7 phagemidsCOS mc1SF9 gluSF9 mc1Hi-5Hi-5 mc1WashPelletWashPelletWashPelletWashPelletWashPelletAverage enrichment×1.72 ± 0.21×1.75 ± 0.75×1.6 ± 1.65×1.71 ± 1.07×2.5 ± 0.55×7.05 ± 3.22×1.69 ± 0.41×2.76 ± 1.3×2.32 ± 0.94×15.9 ± 1.94No. exp.n = 5n = 5n = 4n = 4n = 6n = 6n = 2n = 2n = 4n = 4Experiments presented here were carried out using COS-1, baculovirus-infected SF9 and High Five cells expressing the MC1 receptor, infected SF9 cells expressing a subunit of the"

Ceramide generated by sphingomyelinases (SMases) is known to function as an important second messenger molecule in the signaling pathway of IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor. To investigate the activation of SMases by IL-1, we used an IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1RI)-positive EL4 thymoma cell line, which is defective in IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) expression. In this cell line (EL4D6/76), tumor necrosis factor induced ligand/receptor internalization, NFκB nuclear translocation, IL-2 production, and the activation of neutral (N)-SMase and acid (A)-SMase. In contrast, stimulation with IL-1 resulted only in the activation of N-SMase whereas ligand/receptor internalization, NFκB translocation, IL-2 production, and activation of A-SMase were not detected. Transfection of this functionally defective EL4D6/76 with IL-1RAcP cDNA restored these functions. These data suggest that A-SMase activity is strongly linked with the internalization of IL-1RI mediated by IL-1RAcP and that A-SMase and N-SMase are activated by different pathways.

The activity of ceramide-activated protein kinase is directed to c-Raf-1 and appears to be activated by TNF and IL-1. Other targets of downstream signaling processes of ceramides are ceramide-activated protein phosphatase (21Dobrowsky R.T. Kamibayashi C. Mumby M.C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol.

Additional events in the signaling cascade of ceramides are the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinase and activation of the c-Raf-1 kinase (24Belka C. Wiegmann K. Adam D. Holland R.

Binding of TNF to the 55-kDa TNF receptor activated two different types of SMases, a membrane-associated neutral (N)-SMase and an endosomally located acid (A)-SMase (9Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). Structure-function analyses of the p55 TNF receptor revealed that the SMases are activated independently through different cytoplasmatic domains of the receptor (26Adam D. Wiegmann K. Adam-Klages S. Ruff A. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 14617-14622Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Diacylglycerol (DAG) generated by a phosphatidylcholine-specific phospholipase C (PC-PLC) has been reported to serve as important factor of activation of A-SMase, which, through the generation of ceramide, is a co-factor for the activation of NFκB (27Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). A key event in NFκB activation is the rapid degradation of the inhibitory protein IκB. In a cell-free system, SMase and synthetic ceramide could directly induce IκB degradation, strongly indicating the involvement of SMase in NFκB activation (28Machleidt T. Wiegmann K. Henkel T. Schutze S. Baeuerle P. Kronke M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13760-13765Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). On the other hand, N-SMase seems to exert its signaling capacity via proline-directed protein kinases, like ceramide-activated protein kinase and mitogen-activated protein kinase, which acts in turn on phospholipase A2 (6Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). IL-1 activity is represented by three structurally related molecules (3Dinarello C.A. Blood. 1996; 87: 2095-2147Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dinarello C.A. Eur. Cytokine. Netw. 1994; 5: 517-531PubMed Google Scholar, 30Dinarello C.A. FASEB J. 1994; 8: 1314-1325Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). IL-1α and IL-1β act in an agonistic manner and are internalized after binding to the receptor. The IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) blocks the binding of the agonists and inhibits the internalization of the receptor (31Dripps D.J. Brandhuber B.J. Thompson R.C. Eisenberg S.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10331-10336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two types of receptors have been described with molecular masses of 85 kDa for the type I receptor (IL-1RI) and 65 kDa for the IL-1 type II receptor (IL-1 RII) (32Sims J.E. Dower S.K. Eur. Cytokine. Netw. 1994; 5: 539-546PubMed Google Scholar), but binding to only IL-1RI has been shown to induce cell activation. IL-1RII does not trigger a signaling cascade and presumably inhibits IL-1 activity by acting as a decoy target for IL-1 (33Colotta F. Dower S.K. Sims J.E. Mantovani A. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 562-566Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar, 34Sims J.E. Gayle M.A. Slack J.L. Alderson M.R. Bird T.A. Giri J.G. Colotta F. Re F. Mantovani A. Shanebeck K.

Binding of IL-1 to the IL-1RI leads to the association of serine/threonine kinases (35Croston G.E. Cao Z. Goeddel D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16514-16517Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 36Martin M. Bol G.F. Eriksson A. Resch K. Brigelius Flohe R. Eur. J. Immunol. 1994; 24: 1566-1571Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Recently an IL-1RI accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) was described which does not bind IL-1 but associates with and increases the affinity of IL-1RI (37Greenfeder S.A. Nunes P. Kwee L. Labow M. Chizzonite R.A. Ju G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13757-13765Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (564) Google Scholar). We have previously described an IL-1RI-positive subclone of EL4 cells, EL4D6/76, which binds IL-1 with high affinity but does not respond with IL-1RI internalization or IL-2 production (38Falk W. Von Hogen I. Krammer P.H. Lymphokine Res. 1989; 8: 263-268PubMed Google Scholar,39Von Hoegen I. Falk W. Kojouharoff G. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). This defect can be overcome by intracellular delivery of IL-1 (40Hofmeister R. Mannel D.N. Falk W. J. Inflammation. 1996; 47: 151-163Google Scholar) or by transfection with IL-1RAcP, which reconstituted the IL-1RI internalization and functional defects (41Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Wesche H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar, 42Wesche H. Korherr C. Kracht M. Falk W. Resch K. Martin M.U. J. Biol.

In the present study, therefore, we investigated the activation of SMase by different components of the IL-1R complex. Evidence is provided that IL-1RI internalization is required for the activation of the endosomal A-SMase. Ceramide produced by A-SMase provides an important signal for further downstream events like NFκB activation or IL-2 production. The lack of A-SMase activation may thus explain the unresponsiveness of the IL-1RI internalization-defective cells. EL4 cells and corresponding transfectants were cultured in RPMI 1640 containing 10% fetal calf serum, 100 IU/ml penicillin, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin at 37 °C in air with 5% CO2. For stimulation, 2.5 × 106 cells were seeded in 48-well plates at a density of 1 × 106 cells/ml. Human (h) recombinant (r) IL-1α (rhIL-1α) was kindly provided by Drs. A. Stern and P. Lomedico (Hoffmann-La Roche, Nutley, NJ). The specific activity was 5 × 106 units/mg as determined by the lymphocyte activating factor assay and used at a concentration of 10 units/ml, representing a concentration of 150 pg/ml. Recombinant mouse (m) and human (h) TNF was a kind gift of Knoll AG (Ludwigshafen, Germany). IL-2 activity of the culture supernatants was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the IL-2 Mini Kit (Biozol, Eching, Germany). The assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The IL-2 detection limit was ≥50 pg/ml. To measure the internalization of125I-IL-1α, 2 × 106 cells were incubated for 4 h at 37 °C or 4 °C in 200 μl of medium, pH 7.4, containing 500 pm125I-IL-1α (Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany). Nonspecific binding was determined by adding a 100-fold excess of unlabeled rhIL-1α. Cell surface-bound radioactivity was removed by washing the cells in medium, pH 3.0, for 2 min. Subsequently, the cells were centrifuged through a mixture of dibutyl phthalate and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (3:2) (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). To determine the total cell-associated125I-IL-1α, the cells were passed through the mixture of dibutyl phthalate and bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate without washing. Radioactivity in the cell pellets was measured using a γ-counter. For detection of internalized 125I-TNF, 2 × 106 cells were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 1 ng/ml 125I-TNF (recombinant TNF, NEN Life Science Products, specific activity 2160 kBq/μg) to saturate cell surface receptors. Nonspecific binding was determined by adding an 200-fold excess of unlabeled TNF together with 125I-TNF. After washing the cells three times in cold phosphate-buffered saline, temperature was shifted to 37 °C to allow receptor internalization or kept at 4 °C. To determine the amount of internalized 125I-TNF receptor complexes, noninternalized ligand was removed by centrifuging (50 × g) the cells through serial pH 3.0 gradients consisting of (a) 0.5 ml of culture medium supplemented with 20% Ficoll; (b) a second layer of 0.5 ml of 50 mm glycine-HCl, pH 3.0, 100 mm NaCl supplemented with 10% Ficoll; and (c) a third layer of 0.5 ml of culture medium containing 5% Ficoll. To determine the total amount of cell-associated 125I-TNF, a second aliquot of cells was passed through a gradient, in which the second layer was replaced by phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.3, containing 10% Ficoll. Radioactivity of the cell pellets was determined by counting in a γ-counter. Specific binding was calculated by subtracting nonspecific from total binding, and the amount of internalized 125I-ligands was calculated as percent of specific binding determined at neutral pH. Following stimulation of cells (5 × 106 at 106 cells/ml density) for the times indicated in the figures, nuclear extracts were prepared according to Schreiber et al. (43Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3918) Google Scholar). The protein concentration of the nuclear extracts was measured using a BCA assay (Pierce, Hamburg, Germany) with bovine serum albumin (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) as standard protein. The double-stranded NFκB specific oligonucleotide, containing two tandemly arranged NFκB binding sites of HIV long terminal repeat enhancer (5′-ATCAGGGACTTTCCGCTGGGGACTTTCCG-3′) was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham-Buchler, Braunschweig, Germany) using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) and purified with Nick columns (Pharmacia, Freiburg, Germany). Nuclear extracts (10 μg) were incubated for 15 min at room temperature in binding buffer (5 mm HEPES, pH 7.8, 5 mmMgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, 50 mm poly(dI-dC), final volume 20 μl). The 32P-labeled double-stranded oligonucleotide was then added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for another 15 min. In competition experiments, an 200-fold excess of the unlabeled κB oligonucleotide and Oct2A site (5′-GTACGGAGTATCCAGCTCCGTAGCATGCAAATCCTCTGG-3′) was added. For supershift experiments, the binding reaction mix was incubated with the indicated amounts of antibodies for an additional 1 h. The samples were fractionated on a low ionic strength (0.25 × TBE), 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel, and the bands were detected by autoradiography. EL4 cells (3 × 106) in 1 ml of RPMI 1640 were stimulated in triplicate culture with 100 units/ml rhIL-1α or 100 ng/ml rmTNF-α or medium to determine basal activity for the times indicated in the figures. SMase activities were expressed as percent of basal SMase activities determined for each time point separately. At indicated times, treatment was stopped by immersion of the culture vials in a methanol-dry ice bath. Cells were centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. To measure neutral SMase, pellets were resuspended in a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 2 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm Na3VO4, 0.1 mmNa2MoO4, 30 mm p-nitrophenyl phosphate, 10 mmβ-glycerophosphate, 750 μm ATP, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μm leupeptin, 10 μm pepstatin, 0.2% Triton X-100. After an incubation time of 5 min at 4 °C, the cells were homogenized by repeated squeezing of the cell suspension through an 18-gauge needle. Nuclei and cell debris were removed by centrifugation (800 × g), and the protein content of the supernatant containing cytosolic and membrane fractions was quantified by a BCA assay. Protein (30–50 μg) was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a buffer (50 μl final volume) containing 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1 mmMgCl2, and 2.25 μl of [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (final concentration 20 μm, K m of N-SMase: 15.5 μm) (25 μCi/ml, specific activity 56.6 mCi/mmol, Amersham-Buchler). Phosphorylcholine was extracted with 800 μl chloroform:methanol (2:1, v/v) and 250 μl of H2O. Radioactive phosphorylcholine generated from [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin was determined in the aqueous phase by scintillation counting. To measure acid SMase, the cells were washed and the pellet was resuspended in 200 μl of 0.2% Triton X-100 and incubated for 15 min at 4 °C. To prepare cellular lysates, cells were homogenized and centrifuged in a microcentrifuge at 14,000 rpm. Protein (30–50 μg) from the supernatant was incubated for 2 h at 37 °C in a buffer containing 250 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 1 mmEDTA, and 2.25 μl of [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (final concentration 20 μm, K m of A-SMase: 14.5 μm). The produced radioactive phosphorylcholine was measured as described for neutral SMase assay. To investigate the role of the different SMases in IL-1 signal transduction and their activation via the IL-1RI complex, we used two sublines of the murine thymoma cells EL4, EL4 5D3 and EL4D6/76, which differ in their response to IL-1 (38Falk W. Von Hogen I. Krammer P.H. Lymphokine Res. 1989; 8: 263-268PubMed Google Scholar, 39Von Hoegen I. Falk W. Kojouharoff G. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 40Hofmeister R. Mannel D.N. Falk W. J. Inflammation. 1996; 47: 151-163Google Scholar). On the cell surfaces, both lines express normal numbers of IL-1RI, which show comparable affinity to IL-1 (39Von Hoegen I. Falk W. Kojouharoff G. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Cloning of the IL-1RI cDNA from both cell lines and subsequent sequencing revealed that the nucleotide sequences of the IL-1RI of both cell lines are identical and correspond to the published sequence (data not shown). As shown in Fig.1 A, after binding of IL-1 only EL4 5D3 but not EL4D6/76 reacted with increased IL-2 production in presence of the tumor promoter PMA (39Von Hoegen I. Falk W. Kojouharoff G. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). To investigate whether this defect of EL4D6/76 was restricted to IL-1 cells were stimulated with TNF and/or PMA. In contrast to IL-1, co-stimulation with TNF and PMA led to increased IL-2 production in both cell lines (Fig.1 A), indicating the specificity of the functional defect in EL4D6/76 cells. The higher TNF responsiveness of EL6D6/76 cells compared with EL4 5D3 cells may be explained by the fact that EL4D6/76 cells bind more TNF under our assay conditions (data not shown). No differences in IL-2 production were observed when the cells were stimulated with saturating concentrations of rmTNF or rhTNF, suggesting that activation of the IL-2 production occurred via the 55-kDa TNF receptor (data not shown). This defect in IL-1 responsiveness was shown to correlate with a defect in internalization of receptor-bound IL-1. Only EL4 5D3 cells were able to internalize IL-1, whereas EL4D6/76 cells were deficient (Fig. 1 B). To investigate whether this defect of EL4D6/76 cells is also specific for IL-1, we tested both cell lines for their capability to internalize TNF. Fig. 1 C shows that TNF was internalized in both cell lines to the same extent. Activation of the IL-1RI by IL-1 leads to the rapid activation of the transcription factor NFκB. To examine whether the functional defects in IL-1 responsiveness correlated with defective NFκB activation, cells were stimulated with saturating concentrations of IL-1 and TNF. As shown in Fig. 2, TNF but not IL-1 was able to trigger the rapid activation of NFκB in EL4D6/76 cells, whereas the IL-1-responder EL4 5D3 responded to both stimuli equally well. Taken together, these data show the defect of internalization and function is specific for IL-1RI. Furthermore, the binding of IL-1 to the IL-1RI is not sufficient for triggering the nuclear translocation of NFκB. Induction of SMase activity was shown to be a very early event after TNF receptor or IL-1R triggering. To address the question whether the activity of the N- and A-SMase is coupled to a functional receptor, cells were stimulated with TNF or IL-1 and the activities of the N- and A-SMase were measured. In IL-1-stimulated IL-1-responsive EL4 5D3 cells, the activity of the N-SMase peaked after 90 s (Fig.3 A), whereas the maximum of A-SMase activity was detected after 3 min (Fig. 3 B). Interestingly, IL-1 stimulated N-SMase activity in IL-1-nonresponsive EL4D6/76 cells (Fig. 3 C), whereas no increase of A-SMase activity was detected (Fig. 3 D). Again, stimulation with TNF led to activation of both N-SMase and A-SMase in both sublines (Fig. 3,A–D). As we have shown before, both EL4 5D3 and EL4D6/76 cells were able to internalize and respond to TNF. These data suggested that IL-1R internalization and activation of A-SMase but not N-SMase are functionally coupled. The enzymatic activities of the crude preparations of A- and N-SMase were analyzed. The enzymes showed classical Michaelis-Menten kinetics with IL-1 not significantly affecting K m, but increasingV max of both SMases (Fig.4).Figure 4IL-1α stimulates the increase of activities of N- and A-SMase in EL4 5D3 cells. A, cells were left untreated or stimulated with IL-1α for 1.5 min. Membrane fractions were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Protein (15 μg) was incubated in triplicate for 1 h at 37 °C with varying concentrations of [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (0.15–90 μm). Lipids were extracted, and radioactive phosphorylcholine was quantified in the aqueous phase by lipid scintillation counting. The rate of sphingomyelin breakdown was calculated and the results were plotted double reciprocally. Shown are values of a representative experiment (n = 3).B, cells were left untreated or stimulated with IL-1α for 3 min. Cell lysates were prepared for A-SMase assays. Protein (10 μg) was incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with varying concentrations of [N-methyl-14C]sphingomyelin (0.15–90 μm). Enzymatic activities were determined and plotted double reciprocally. Shown are values of representative experiments (n = 3).C, K m and V maxwere calculated from A and B according to Lineweaver and Burk (52Lineweaver H. Burk D. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1934; 56: 658-666Crossref Scopus (8067) Google Scholar).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Recently, we found that expression of IL-1RAcP in EL4D6/76 reconstituted IL-1 responsiveness with respect to internalization of IL-1 and IL-2 secretion (41Korherr C. Hofmeister R. Wesche H. Falk W. Eur. J. Immunol. 1997; 27: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). To investigate whether activation of A-SMase is linked to a functionally competent IL-1 receptor that is capable of receptor internalization, we used transfectants of the IL-1-nonresponding line EL4 D6/76, which stably expressed the IL-1RAcP. The ability to activate A-SMase in EL4D6/76 cells was also reconstituted in IL-1RAcP-transfectants. As shown in Fig.5, IL-1 did not stimulate A-SMase in EL4D6/76 cells. The corresponding IL-1RAcP transfectants, however, showed the typical A-SMase activation pattern with maximum activity at 3 min after IL-1 stimulation. A-SMase through production of ceramide provides an important cofactor for NFκB activation. When the IL-1-responsive EL4 5D3 and IL-1-nonresponsive EL4D6/76 were stimulated with IL-1, NFκB was activated in EL4 5D3 but not in the nontransfected EL4D6/76 (Fig.6 A). Four corresponding IL-1RAcP transfectants, however, clearly showed activated NFκB after stimulation with IL-1 (Fig. 6 A). The identity of NFκB was confirmed in competition experiments with a 200-fold excess of unlabeled κB oligonucleotides in two representative IL-1RAcP transfectants (Fig. 6 B). In contrast, a 200-fold excess of cold Oct2A oligonucleotide had no inhibitory effect on the formation of the NFκB complex. In supershift experiments, an anti-RelA antibody specifically inhibited the formation of the NFκB complex. An anti-RelB antibody was not able to replace the complex, indicating the involvement of the p65 rather than p68 subunit in the formation of the NFκB complex (Fig. 6 B).Figure 6Reconstitution of IL-1-mediated NFκB activation in EL4D6/76 when transfected with IL-1RAcP. The NFκB complex was confirmed in competition experiments and supershift analyses. A, EL4 5D3, EL4 D6/76, and stably IL-1RAcP transfected EL4D6/76 cells (EL4 1F4, EL4 1G6, EL4 10B5, and EL4 10G12) were either left untreated or stimulated for 1 h with 150 pg/ml IL-1. After the indicated periods of time, nuclear extracts were prepared and NFκB binding activity was detected by EMSA using the32P-labeled NFκB binding site from HIV long terminal repeat. B, two transfectants (EL4 10B5 and EL4 10G12) were left untreated or stimulated with 150 pg/ml IL-1 for 1 h before nuclear extracts were prepared. Again, NFκB binding activity was detected by EMSA. Additionally, competition experiments with unlabeled κB and Oct2A oligonucleotides, respectively, were performed. The nuclear extracts were incubated with the radiolabeled NFκB binding oligonucleotide, and either a 200-fold excess of unlabeled κB or Oct2A site before the reaction mix was separated by gel electrophoresis. In supershift experiments, 1 μg of anti-RelA or anti-RelB antibody was added to the reaction mix for an additional 1 h before separation by gel electrophoresis.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) During the last few years, the importance of ceramides as second messenger molecules generated by the breakdown of sphingomyelin has become evident (5Heller R.A. Kronke M. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 5-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (402) Google Scholar, 6Kolesnick R. Golde D.W. Cell. 1994; 77: 325-328Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (916) Google Scholar). Previous studies indicated that the TNF signal activates two forms of sphingomyelinases, a membrane-bound N-SMase and DAG-dependent endo/lysosomal A-SMase (27Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). These two forms are triggered independently from each other and lead into different signaling pathways (9Wiegmann K. Schutze S. Machleidt T. Witte D. Kronke M. Cell. 1994; 78: 1005-1015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (678) Google Scholar). A-SMase has been identified as a candidate for NFκB activation. Raising the pH of the endo-/lysosomal compartments with monensin or ammonium chloride resulted in a loss of A-SMase activity and NFκB activation selectively; neither N-SMase activity nor PC-PLC was affected (27Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). As IL-1 is another potent activator of SMases and NFκB, we, therefore, investigated the activation of A- and N-SMase by IL-1 and the relation to different components of the IL-1RI in two sublines of the EL4 thymoma cell line. The subline EL4 5D3 can be activated by IL-1, whereas EL4D6/76 cannot be activated although high affinity IL-1 binding sites are present (39Von Hoegen I. Falk W. Kojouharoff G. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). The defects in internalization of the IL-1R complex, in activation of A-SMase, and in nuclear translocation of NFκB were all shown to be specific for IL-1R-mediated stimulation, since the IL-1-nonresponsive EL4D6/76 cells readily responded to TNF stimulation. IL-1, however, activated N-SMase and A-SMase differentially. N-SMase was activated in both the IL-1-responder and IL-1-nonresponder lines by IL-1 and thus did not correlate with activation of NFκB and IL-2 production. In contrast, A-SMase was not activated in IL-1-nonresponsive EL4D6/76 cells by IL-1, although TNF was readily able to activate A-SMase. Therefore, in the IL-1-signaling cascade, N-SMase activation is not sufficient for NFκB activation. Thus, ceramide per se might not be an activator of NFκB but only ceramide generated by A-SMase in a distinct cellular compartment. The importance of compartmentalization is underlined by investigations of Liu et al. (44Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). They have shown that IL-1β stimulated DAG and ceramide production only in caveolae fractions of fibroblasts. DAG induced by IL-1 in other cellular fractions was not coupled to ceramide production. In our experiments which are not shown in this paper, incubation with C2- and C8-ceramides did not activate NFκB in both cell lines. Therefore, since A-SMase appears to be required for IL-1-induced NFκB activation and ceramide analogs do not induce this event, ceramide might be a necessary but not sufficient co-signal for NFκB activation. We also found previously that exogenous sphingomyelinases or sphingosine were not able to co-stimulate IL-2 production in EL4 cells (45Falk W. Stricker K. Praast G. Tsukitani Y. Krammer P.H. Stoeck M. Lymphokine Cytokine Res. 1994; 13: 167-174PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, it might be possible that small amounts of A-SMase-derived ceramide in specialized compartments contribute to activation of NFκB or IL-2 production. In A-SMase-deficient Niemann-Pick fibroblasts, however, NFκB activation is induced by IL-1, indicating that A-SMase activity is not essential for NFκB activation (46Kuno K. Sukegawa K. Ishikawa Y. Orii T. Matsushima K. Int. Immunol. 1994; 6: 1269-1272Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In addition to internalization of IL-1 and IL-2 production, we found that IL-1-stimulated A-SMase activity was also reconstituted by transfection in four independent stable transfectants of EL4D6/76 cells (Fig. 5). Simultaneously, the activation of NFκB was restored, strongly supporting the existence of a link between A-SMase activity and NFκB activation. Thus, A-SMase activity, in contrast to N-SMase activity, correlated with internalization of a functional IL-1RI complex. The data suggest that A-SMase activation requires a functional receptor complex that is capable of receptor internalization. The need of internalization for cytokine action is controversially discussed in the literature. Endocytosis is reported to play a critical role in TNF-induced gene expression and induction of cytolysis (47Bradley J.R. Johnson D.R. Pober J.S. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 5544-5555PubMed Google Scholar, 48Kull Jr., F.C. Cuatrecasas P. Cancer Res. 1981; 41: 4885-4890PubMed Google Scholar, 49Suffys P. Beyaert R. Van Roy F. Fiers W. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 149: 735-743Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar). In EL4 cells, IL-1 signaling and internalization correlate (38Falk W. Von Hogen I. Krammer P.H. Lymphokine Res. 1989; 8: 263-268PubMed Google Scholar, 39Von Hoegen I. Falk W. Kojouharoff G. Krammer P.H. Eur. J. Immunol. 1989; 19: 329-334Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) and an intracellular activation loop of IL-1 seems to be operative in EL4 (40Hofmeister R. Mannel D.N. Falk W. J. Inflammation. 1996; 47: 151-163Google Scholar). On the other hand, in Jurkat cells, internalization and nuclear localization of IL-1 was not sufficient for activation of the IL-2 promoter (50Heguy A. Baldari C. Bush K. Nagele R. Newton R.C. Robb R.J. Horuk R. Telford J.L. Melli M. Cell Growth Differ. 1991; 2: 311-315PubMed Google Scholar). Andrieu et al. (51Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Jaffrezou J.P. Levade T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 24518-24524Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggest that cytokine-receptor internalization is not required for activation of the sphingomyelin pathway because they found similar degradation of sphingomyelin and generation of ceramide in cells when endocytosis was blocked by low temperature and hypertonicity. These data, however, do not exclude the requirement for the internalization of the receptor complex to activate A-SMase, as there was no distinction made between ceramide produced by A- or N-SMase. It is therefore possible that the increased ceramide level results from N-SMase activity, which in our experiments did not require IL-1R internalization. A possible mechanism for the activation of A-SMase is indicated by data obtained from studies with caveolae fractions. The caveola is a membrane domain that can undergo an internalization cycle. Invagination of the membrane is followed by the formation of plasmalemmal vesicles, which provide an optimal microenvironment for activation of A-SMase. IL-1β stimulated the production of DAG in a caveola-rich membrane fraction of whole fibroblasts. This was followed by a degradation of sphingomyelin and a concomitant increase of ceramide. Additionally, A-SMase activity could be detected in the caveolae fractions (44Liu P. Anderson R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27179-27185Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (302) Google Scholar). In TNF signaling, the activation of A-SMase by 1,2-DAG generated by membrane-located PC-PLC has been reported (27Schutze S. Potthoff K. Machleidt T. Berkovic D. Wiegmann K. Kronke M. Cell. 1992; 71: 765-776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (973) Google Scholar). Thus, activation of A-SMase by IL-1 may occur via co-internalization of 1,2-DAG with the caveolae-associated IL-1/IL-1RI complex, if PC-PLC activation occurs in close vicinity to the membrane receptors. In conclusion, the present study shows that the IL-1-induced increase in A-SMase activity and concomitant activation of NFκB are dependent on the presence of IL-1RAcP. Ceramide produced by A-SMase, therefore, might represent the functional link between IL-1RI internalization and activation of NFκB and IL-2 production.

During the transcription process, multisubunit RNA polymerases contact the DNA template and the RNA product at multiple sites to ensure the processivity of the polymerization reaction (Refs. 1Landick R.

The functional importance of RNA-enzyme interactions prompted us to screen for RNA aptamers that bind to and inhibit yeast RNA polymerases at different steps of the transcription reaction. In the present work, we isolated high affinity RNA ligands against yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) 1The abbreviations used are: Pol, polymerase; bp, base pair; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; RPR, RNase P RNA. 1The abbreviations used are: Pol, polymerase; bp, base pair; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; RPR, RNase P RNA. using the Selex procedure (19Ellington A.D.

One selected RNA ligand described here specifically bound to Saccharomyces cerevisiae Pol II with high affinity and was a strong inhibitor of transcription. S. cerevisiaeRNA polymerases I, II, and III were prepared as described previously (28Buhler J.-M. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 5963-5970Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 29Dezélée S. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. FEBS lett. 1972; 21: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 30Huet J. Riva M. Sentenac A. Fromageot P. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 15304-15310Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Schizosaccharomyces pombe Pol II was prepared analogously. Wheat germ Pol II was a generous gift from Dr. Dominique Job (Lyon). The initial random pool of RNAs was prepared as described (31Geiger A. Burgstaller P. von der Heltz H. Roeder A. Famulok M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar). DNA molecules of the library contained 40 randomized nucleotides flanked by 5′ and 3′ constant sequences recognized by primers. 5′ Primer, 5′-TCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGCGCTAAGTCCTCGCTCA-3′; 3′ primer, 5′-GTCGGATCCGAGTCGCGCGT-3′. For the first round of selection, RNAs were produced by in vitro transcription of a DNA library fraction (10 μg of DNA, complexity of 1015 molecules (31Geiger A. Burgstaller P. von der Heltz H. Roeder A. Famulok M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 1029-1036Crossref PubMed Scopus (290) Google Scholar)) with T7 RNA polymerase (32Famulok M. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 1698-1706Crossref Scopus (246) Google Scholar). RNAs were separated by electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide, 7 m urea gel, and RNA molecules of appropriate length (approximately 80 nucleotides) were eluted from the gel as described by Johnson and Chamberlin (17Johnson T.L. Chamberlin M.J. Cell. 1994; 77: 217-224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar) and ethanol-precipitated. RNAs (40 pmol) were incubated with S. cerevisiae Pol II (5 pmol) for 30 min at 30 °C in 25 μl of binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 100 mm ammonium sulfate). The RNA·RNA polymerase complexes were filtered under a slight vacuum through a HA filter (2.5 cm; 0.45 μm, Millipore) pre-wetted in binding buffer. The filter was rinsed with 6 ml of binding buffer, and the retained RNAs were extracted by phenol/urea treatment as described by Kubik et al. (33Kubik M.F. Stephens A.W. Schneider D. Marlar R.A. Tasset D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 2619-2626Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Selected RNAs were reverse-transcribed with the murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase in the presence of the 3′ primer, and the cDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction after the addition of the 5′ primer (Perkin-Elmer, Gene AmpR). cDNAs were used as templates for a next round of transcription/selection/amplification. Before the incubation with Pol II, RNAs were filtered on a HA filter to eliminate molecules nonspecifically retained on the filter. Every three rounds, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction products were purified by electrophoresis on a 7.5% polyacrylamide gel in denaturing conditions (see above). At the ninth round, cDNA (F9) were cloned and sequenced. Subsequently, six additional rounds of in vitroselection were performed under similar conditions, except that Pol II was preincubated with 250 ng of heparin (Sigma; H-2149 type) for 5 min at 30 °C in binding buffer before the addition of the RNAs. After the 15th round, cDNAs from the pool (F15) were cloned and sequenced. Standard incubation mixture (10 μl) contained 70 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 75 mm ammonium sulfate, 2.5 mmMnCl2, 0.1 mm each ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP, 0.5 μCi of [α-32P]UTP (400 Ci/mmol), 2 pmol of dC-tailed template (37-bp double strand oligonucleotide containing a (dC)8 single strand extension at the 3′ extremity of the transcribed strand) or 1 μg of poly[d(A-T)]), 2.5 pmol of RNA polymerase, 1 unit of RNasin (Promega). For S. cerevisiaePol I, MnCl2 was replaced by MgCl2 (5 mm), whereas for Pol III both divalent cations were present. After a 30 min incubation at 30 °C, the amount of transcribed RNAs was quantified by precipitation in 5% (w/v) cold trichloroacetic acid and scintillation counting of precipitated radioactivity. The radiolabeled transcripts from the dC-tailed template were also analyzed by electrophoresis on a 20% (w/v) polyacrylamide, 7m urea gel and quantified with a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). The evaluation of apparentK d was performed by filter binding assays where 2 pmol of Pol II were incubated with varying amounts of FC- or FO-labeled RNAs (2 × 103 cpm/pmol). The binding reactions were filtered through a HA filter (2.5 cm, 0.45 μm; Millipore). After extensive washes with binding buffer, only bound RNAs were retained on filter. The radioactivity was then quantitated by scintillation counting. Apparent K d values were calculated using the Eadie-Hofstee plot: [RNA·Pol II] = [pol II] −K d [RNA·Pol II]/[RNA]. Pol II (0.8 pmol) was preincubated for 15 min at 30 °C with varying amounts of Pol II-specific aptamers in 15 μl of binding buffer. 5′-End-radiolabeled double-stranded dC-tailed template (see “RNA Polymerase Activity” above) (0.05 pmol, 105 cpm/pmol) was added, and incubation was continued for 15 min. After the addition of 2 μl of loading buffer (1 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.02% xylene cyanol, 0.02% bromphenol blue, 60% (w/v) sucrose), complexes were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5% polyacrylamide gel and subjected to autoradiography. Pol II lacking CTD was prepared by digesting purified Pol II with proteinase K (enzyme/substrate = 1/10,000 (w/w)) during 30 min at 37 °C. After evaluation of the specific proteolysis of the CTD by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, the proteolyzed Pol II was chromatographed on a Mono Q column (Smart system, Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) to remove proteinase K. Nonspecific transcriptional activity of this enzyme was determined on calf thymus DNA and was found not to be affected by proteolysis. For characterizing the Pol II-DNA interactions, the transcribed or the nontranscribed strand of dC-tailed DNA template (see “RNA Polymerase Activity”) were independently 5′-end-labeled using [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham) and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Pharmacia). After hybridization of each labeled strand with its nonlabeled complementary strand, free [γ-32P]ATP was eliminated by permeation chromatography on a Superdex 75 column in a 50 mm NaCl, 70 mmTris-HCl, pH 8, buffer on a Smart system (Pharmacia). For cross-linking experiments, 30 pmol of DNA template labeled on the coding or on the noncoding strand (5 × 104 cpm/pmol) were incubated with 6 pmol of proteolyzed or nonproteolyzed Pol II in a transcription buffer (4 mm dithiothreitol, 2.5 mmMnCl2, 30 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 130 mmammonium sulfate, and 0.1 mm each of ATP, CTP, GTP, UTP) for 60 min at 30 °C. Irradiation was performed on ice for 8 min at a distance of 0.5 cm using a 254-nm transilluminator (model VL-6LC, Bioblock). For characterizing the Pol II-FC interactions, FC RNA was body-labeled by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase and was purified by electrophoresis as described above. Pol II (2 pmol) was preincubated in the presence or the absence (see Fig. 6) of FO RNA (40 pmol) in binding buffer for 5 min at 30 °C in a final volume of 10 μl. Labeled FC RNA (4 pmol, 106 cpm) was added, and the incubation was pursued for 10 min. After irradiation, samples were supplemented with 20 μl of loading buffer and subjected to electrophoresis under denaturing conditions on a 7% polyacrylamide gel as described previously (34Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205523) Google Scholar). Proteins bands were visualized by silver staining (35Blum H. Beier H. Gross H.J. Electrophoresis. 1987; 8: 93-99Crossref Scopus (3722) Google Scholar). The gel was dried and subjected to autoradiography on a Kodak Biomax film. Expression vector pIIIex426 RPR was a gift from Dr. Engelke (University of Michigan). This high multi-copy plasmid carried the URA3 auxotrophy marker, allowing selection of yeast cells growing on plates lacking uracil (36Good P.D. Engelke D.R. Gene. 1994; 151: 209-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). FO1, FO2, and FC cDNA were prepared by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction using 5′ and 3′ oligonucleotide primers that carried EcoRI recognition sites and cloned at the EcoRI site of pIIIex426 RPR, yielding recombinant plasmids pIIIexFO1, pIIIexFO2, and PIIIexFC. FO1 and FO2 cDNAs were derived from the unselected pool, whereas FC cDNA corresponded to the selected FC ligand after round 15. Nucleotidic sequences and insertion sense were determined by sequencing (Pharmacia). Strain YF1971 (W303-1b with pLEU2-RPO21 LEU2) (37Archambault J. Jansma D.B. Friesen J.D. Genetics. 1996; 142: 737-747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was obtained by Dr. Friesen (University of Toronto). In this strain, the RPO21 gene that encodes the largest subunit of Pol II is placed under the control of a leucine-repressed promoter. Yeast transformation was done using the lithium acetate procedure. Yeast strains were grown at 30 °C on synthetic dextrose medium (38Sherman F. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 3-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (2526) Google Scholar) supplemented or not with 0.2 mm leucine and isoleucine. RNA aptamers that bind to S. cerevisiae Pol II were selected by the Selex strategy. The starting RNA library (FO) consisted of a randomized region of 40 nucleotides flanked by defined sequences at the 5′- and 3′- ends (Fig. 1). An excess of RNAs (40 pmol) was incubated with a highly purified preparation of Pol II (5 pmol). The RNA·protein complexes were retained on a nitrocellulose filter by filtration, whereas free RNAs passed through the membrane. After extensive washing of the membrane, the protein·RNA complexes were dissociated by phenol extraction, and the RNA was amplified. This selection/amplification procedure was repeated nine times and resulted in the RNA pool (F9). Gel shift assays of increasing amounts of Pol II incubated with an identical amount of radiolabeled FO or F9 RNAs demonstrated that F9 RNAs exhibited a higher affinity for the enzyme compared with FO RNAs (data not shown). A fraction of F9 RNA molecules was reverse-transcribed, cloned, and sequenced. The sequence analysis of F9 molecules showed a nonrandom sequence distribution, but selected molecules were still heterogenous (data not shown). Therefore, additional selection/amplification cycles were performed using a more stringent screen. At each cycle, Pol II was preincubated with heparin before addition of the RNAs ligands. In this way, a competition was imposed between heparin and RNA for interaction with the nucleic acid binding sites of Pol II. By saturating Pol II with heparin, one would expect to select RNA ligands with a high affinity for nucleic acid binding sites or that were directed to alternative sites of the enzyme. After six rounds of high stringency selection, 34 clones of the final evolved population F15 were sequenced (Fig. 1). Based on sequence analysis, selected ligands were grouped into two classes: ligands of class 1 contained a conserved motif CGGN x GAGG ( x = 1 or 2, where N is any nucleotide), whereas no consensus motif was found in ligands of class 2 (Fig. 1). Among 27 ligands of class 1, three of them named FA, FB, and FC were found 13, 9, and 3 times, respectively. Within class 2, all of the RNA sequences were unique, except for FD, which was found twice (Fig. 1). F15 population bound Pol II with higher affinity and showed a greater capacity to inhibit transcription compared with the F9 and FO populations (data not shown). Therefore, we decided to investigate the properties of the F15 population by studying the monoclonal ligands FA, FB, FC, and FD, which were not unique in the final F15-evolved population. Individual clones of RNA ligands FA, FB, FC, and FD were assayed for their ability to inhibit Pol II activity in vitro using a 37-bp dC-tailed DNA template that could be used for transcription and DNA binding studies as well as for cross-linking experiments. Transcription of this short double-stranded DNA can be easily monitored by gel electrophoresis of the 37-mer RNA transcript. Before the transcription reaction, Pol II was preincubated with varying amounts of the initial RNAs pool (FO) or of the monoclonal FA, FB, FC, or FD ligands. As shown in Fig. 2, the preincubation of Pol II with the selected FA, FB, FC, or FD ligands inhibited transcription in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas at the same concentrations FO RNA pool had only a weak effect (Fig. 2). Note that the FD RNA, which does not contain the consensus motif previously defined, had the lower inhibitory effect. During the selection, the apparent K d of ligands for Pol II evolved from approximately 180 nm for FO to 20 nm for FC (data not shown). Compared with the other selected ligands, the FC RNA displayed the highest inhibitory potential. For this reason, FC was chosen for further investigations. Since the three forms of yeast RNA polymerase are highly homologous, in particular the two largest subunits, which represent two thirds of the mass of the enzymes, we analyzed the effect of the FC RNA on thein vitro transcriptional activity of Pol I, II, or III. Each enzyme was incubated with increasing amounts of FC RNA or FO pool and then assayed for their activity on a poly[d(A-T)] template. As previously observed with the dC-tailed template, Pol II activity was strongly inhibited by FC ligand at an equimolar ratio (Fig.3 A), whereas the FO pool had only a weak effect (10–20% inhibition; see Figs. 2 and3 B). Even when increasing the molar ratio FO/Pol II up to 6, FO RNA did not inhibit Pol II activity much (30% inhibition, data not shown). In the case of Pol I, a moderate inhibition of transcription was observed with a large amount of FC RNA (Fig. 3 A). A similar result was obtained in the presence of nonselected FO pool RNAs (Fig. 3 B), indicating that Pol I transcription shows a general, nonspecific sensitivity to RNA molecules. FC RNA or FO pool did not inhibit the Pol III activity but rather slightly activated the enzyme at sub-stoichiometric levels. These results indicated that the FC RNA was a specific inhibitor of the yeast Pol II. FC RNA was further examined for its ability to inhibit the activity of Pol II from various species. Before the transcription assay, each RNA polymerase was incubated with increasing amounts of FC RNA (Fig.4). In contrast to Pol II from S. cerevisiae, Pol II from S. pombe and wheat germ were not inhibited by the FC ligand. Thus, the FC ligand appeared to be a species-specific inhibitor of S. cerevisiae Pol II.Figure 4Species-specific FC inhibition. Pol II (2 pmol) from S. cerevisiae, S.pombe, or wheat germ was preincubated with FC RNA at different molar ratio as indicated. The enzyme activity was then assayed in standard conditions using a 37-bp dC-tailed DNA template. Acid-insoluble RNAs were quantified by counting in a scintillation counter. The enzyme activity is expressed in percent of activity of the enzyme without preincubation with FC RNA.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We noted that the inhibition of Pol II transcription by FC RNA was independent of template concentration (from 0.5 to 3 μg per assay), suggesting that FC binding was noncompetitive with DNA (data not shown). To test whether FC RNA interfered with the binding of Pol II to a DNA template, we performed gel shift competition assays using the labeled dC-tailed template. Binding of purified Pol II to this probe led to the formation of two protein·DNA complexes of different electrophoretic mobility (Fig. 5, lane 2). The low mobility band resulted from the interaction of nonproteolyzed Pol II (retaining the carboxy-terminal domain or CTD) with DNA, whereas the higher mobility band contained the proteolyzed form of Pol II missing the CTD. Indeed, only the upper band could be shifted by an anti-CTD monoclonal antibody (data not shown). Preincubation of Pol II with FC ligand (Fig. 5, lanes 6–8) dramatically affected the binding of the labeled DNA probe to the enzyme. In the presence of an equimolar amount of FC RNA and Pol II, DNA binding of the probe to both enzyme forms was completely abolished. FC ligand not only prevented the binding of DNA but also displaced prebound template (data not shown). When exploring the effect of each selected RNA (FA, FB, FC, and FD) on the binding of Pol II on the DNA template using competition gel shift assays, we observed that in all cases the amount of DNA·Pol II complexes could be correlated to the inhibitory potency of the selected RNAs (data not shown). The differential effect of FC on Pol II activity as compared with Pol I and III (Fig. 3 A) was also confirmed by gel shift experiments, since a 2-fold molar excess of FC RNA was unable to inhibit the formation of Pol I·DNA or Pol III·DNA complexes (data not shown). In contrast, the FO RNA pool only partially decreased enzyme-DNA binding when added in a 2-fold 2-fold molar excess relative to the Pol II (Fig. 5, lane 5). Surprisingly, FO RNA appears to diminish binding of the DNA template (Fig. 5, comparelanes 3, 4, and 5 with lane 2) at FO RNA/Pol II ratios that have almost no effect on Pol II transcriptional activity (see Fig. 2). The apparent discrepancy between binding assay and Pol II activity assay could be due to the presence of a nonactive subpopulation of Pol II in the enzyme preparation. Although experimental data supporting this hypothesis are lacking, FO RNA could possibly inhibit DNA binding by the transcriptionally incompetent enzyme population. Using competition binding assays, we observed that the affinity of FC for Pol II did not depend on temperature (from 0 to 30 °C) or ammonium sulfate concentration (from 0 to 100 mm) (data not shown). To test whether the single-stranded DNA version of FC (FC DNA) displayed inhibitory properties as FC RNA, gel shift experiments as well as transcription assays were performed in the presence of FC DNA produced by asymetric polymerase chain reaction. In contrast to FC RNA, a 4-fold molar excess of FC DNA relative to the Pol II only partially impaired the dC-tailed DNA·pol II complex formation and did not inhibit the pol II-dependent transcription (data not shown). To identify the polymerase subunit(s) contacted by FC RNA ligand, Pol II was cross-linked to 32P-labeled FC RNA by UV irradiation, and the labeled subunits were identified after SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig.6 A). In a first experiment, under electrophoretic conditions at which all Pol II subunits could be visualized, we found that only the largest subunits were detectably labeled (data not shown). Fig. 6 A, lane 1 shows the two largest subunits (B220 and B150) of Pol II resolved on a 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We determined by immunoblot analysis that the major intermediary B185 component derived from B220 by proteolysis of the CTD and the minor products ranging from 160 to 185 kDa (indicated by a vertical line) corresponded to further proteolysis of B220 (data not shown). Most of the FC RNA covalently bound to Pol II reflected a preferential cross-linking to the B220 and B185 subunits and suggested that the CTD is not involved in this interaction (Fig. 6 A, lane 2). The weakly labeled bands that migrated faster than B185 were derived from the cross-linkage of B220 derivatives (vertical line) or B150. In a control experiment, no radioactive band was detected upon UV-irradiation of the FC RNA in the absence of RNA polymerase (Fig.6 A, lane 4). Furthermore, the preincubation of Pol II with a large excess of nonradioactive FO RNA pool did not reduce the labeling of the subunits targeted by FC RNA (Fig. 6 A,lane 3), hence confirming the specificity of the binding and cross-linking reactions. We next compared the Pol II-binding sites of the FC RNA ligand with those of a DNA template, since the FC RNA competed for DNA binding. This was achieved by cross-linking of Pol II to a32P-labeled dC-tailed DNA template. Analysis of cross-linked subunits was performed as before (Fig. 6 B). As previously mentioned, CTD is not involved in the interaction of FC RNA with Pol II. Nevertheless, Suzuki (39Suzuki M. Nature. 1990; 344: 562-565Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) demonstrated that a synthetic peptide corresponding to the CTD could bind in vitro to DNA. To check the involvement of the CTD in the binding of Pol II to DNA, two Pol II preparations were used for the characterization of the Pol II-DNA template interactions: one essentially containing the intact B220 subunit, the other containing the proteolyzed B185 form. Enzyme-DNA UV photocross-linking was performed using a DNA template selectively labeled either in the transcribed or the nontranscribed strand. We first determined that among all subunits of Pol II, only the two largest, B220 and B150, were cross-linked to the template (data not shown) as well as B185, the form of B220 lacking the CTD. Comparison of the relative amount of the B220·DNA and B185·DNA complexes (Fig.6 B, compare lanes 5 with 7 or6 with 8) revealed that the CTD was not involved in the interaction of B220 subunit with the DNA strands. Note that the largest subunit was cross-linked to the same extent to the transcribed and the nontranscribed strands, whereas the B150 subunit was predominantly cross-linked to the non-trans"
https://openalex.org/W1529384308,"PA28 is a 180,000-dalton protein that activates hydrolysis of small nonubiquitinated peptides by the 20 S proteasome. PA28 is composed of two homologous subunits, α and β, arranged in alternating positions in a ring-shaped oligomer with a likely stoichiometry of (αβ)3. Our previous work demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit was necessary for PA28 to bind to and activate the proteasome. The goals of this work were to define the exact structural basis for this effect and to determine the relative roles of the α and β subunits in proteasome activation. Each subunit and various mutants of the α subunit were expressed in Escherichia coli and purified. PA28α stimulated the proteasome, but had a much greaterK act than native heteromeric PA28. In contrast, PA28β was unable to stimulate the proteasome. Mutants of the α subunit in which the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue was deleted or substituted with charged amino acids could neither bind to nor activate the proteasome. However, substitution of the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine with other amino acids resulted in proteins which could stimulate the proteasome to various extents. Tryptophan mutants stimulated the proteasome as well as did native PA28, whereas serine or phenylalanine mutants stimulated the proteasome much poorer than did wild type PA28α. Deletion of the “KEKE” motif, a 28-amino acid domain near the amino terminus of PA28α, had no effect on proteasome stimulatory activity. Hetero-oligomeric PA28 proteins were reconstituted from isolated wild type and mutant subunits. PA28 reconstituted from wild type subunits had structural and functional properties that were indistinguishable from those of the native hetero-oligomeric protein. PA28 molecules reconstituted from inactive α subunits and wild type β subunits remained inactive. However, PA28 molecules reconstituted from suboptimally active α mutants and wild type β subunits had the same activity as native heteromeric PA28. These results indicate that the β subunit modulates PA28 activity, perhaps by influencing the affinity of PA28 for the proteasome.

The proteasome is a 700,000-dalton protease composed of 28 similarly sized subunits (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

These subunits, which in eukaryotes represent the products of 14 distinct genes, are arranged as a stack of four heptameric rings that form a cylindrical particle (6Tanaka K. Tamura T. Yoshimura T. Ichihara A. New Biol. 1992; 4: 173-187PubMed Google Scholar, 7Pühler G. Weinkauf S. Bachmann L. Müller S. Engel A. Hegerl R. Baumeister W.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 12229-12237Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar). Although all 14 gene products have similar amino acid sequences, they can be divided into two subgroups of seven, termed α and β, whose respective members' sequences are more closely related to one another (9Zwickl P. Grziwa A. Pühler G. Dahlmann B. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Each of the two outer or terminal rings of the proteasome are composed of all seven α-type subunits, whereas each of the two inner rings are composed of all seven β-type subunits (7Pühler G. Weinkauf S. Bachmann L. Müller S. Engel A. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1607-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Certain archaebacteria contain a simpler form of the proteasome, which consists of only two gene products, one representing the ancestor of the eukaryotic α-type subunits and the other representing the ancestor of the eukaryotic β-type subunits (9Zwickl P. Grziwa A. Pühler G. Dahlmann B. Lottspeich F. Baumeister W. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 964-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar). Nevertheless, the archaebacterial proteasome has the same overall morphology as eukaryotic proteasomes, and the α and β subunits occupy the same relative positions within the particle as do those of eukaryotic proteasomes (10Grziwa A. Baumeister W. Dahlmann B. Kopp F. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 186-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 11Kopp F. Dahlmann B. Hendil K.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Thus, regardless of source, the proteasome is a multisubunit dimer that exhibits a C2 symmetry about an axis through the two inner rings (7Pühler G. Weinkauf S. Bachmann L. Müller S. Engel A. Hegerl R. Baumeister W. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1607-1616Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar,11Kopp F. Dahlmann B. Hendil K.B. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 229: 14-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Recently, crystal structures for both archaebacterial and yeast proteasomes were solved (12Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 13Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). The structures have clarified several issues left unresolved by previous biochemical and molecular studies. For example, it is now clear that the proteasome's catalytic activities are located on β subunits and that at least three of the seven eukaryotic β subunits are catalysts. Furthermore, the catalytic nucleophile for each of these distinct subunits is an amino-terminal threonine oriented toward a chamber present in the interior of the cylindrical particle (12Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar, 13Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R.

Science. 1995; 268: 579-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (586) Google Scholar). Access to this chamber by protein substrates appears to be highly restricted. In archaebacteria, substrates must traverse a narrow 13-Å portal formed by the center of the terminal ring subunits (12Löwe J. Stock D. Jap B. Zwickl P. Baumeister W. Huber R. Science. 1995; 268: 533-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (1380) Google Scholar). In yeast proteasomes, this portal is blocked by the amino-terminal portions of the α subunits, and there is no obvious path by which substrates can reach the active sites (13Groll M. Ditzel L. Lowe J. Stock D. Bochtler M. Bartunik H.D. Huber R. Nature. 1997; 386: 463-471Crossref PubMed Scopus (1949) Google Scholar). These findings imply that there must be mechanisms that regulate the influx of substrates through the terminal rings for delivery to the sequestered active sites. In eukaryotes, mechanisms that regulate entry of substrates to active sites may be mediated by specific regulatory proteins that bind to the terminal rings of the proteasome. In fact, two proteins, PA700 and PA28, stimulate proteasome activity after binding with such topologies (1Coux O. Tanaka K. Goldberg A.L. Annu. Rev.

Although the exact role of ATP in either process is unknown, it is reasonable to speculate that ATP may be used to translocate the polypeptide chain from binding sites on PA700 to the catalytic sites within the interior of the protein (17Rubin D.M.

It is a ring-shaped molecule composed of two gene products, termed α and β (30Ma C. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol.

Previously, work by us and others indicated that the α and β subunits occupy alternating positions in the ring, suggesting that PA28 has a hexameric structure of (αβ)3(36Song X.

PA28 activates the proteasome by binding to one or both terminal rings, but unlike PA700 does not require ATP for either binding or activation (32Gray C.W. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 236: 7-15Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). PA28 regulates the proteasome's hydrolysis of small nonubiquitinated peptides by increasingV max and decreasing apparentK m, and therefore functions as a positive allosteric effector (30Ma C. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 22369-22377Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated an important role for the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit in proteasome activation. Specifically, treatment of PA28 with carboxypeptidases resulted in complete loss of activity due to the loss of only one or two amino acids from the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit (36Song X.

Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 22514-22519Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, a limited structural domain of one of the two subunits appeared to be required for binding of PA28 to the proteasome and resultant proteasome activation. Further support for a key role of the α subunit in PA28 function was obtained in studies showing that the isolated α subunit, prepared as a recombinant protein or electrophoretically separated from denatured native PA28, could activate the proteasome although not as efficiently as the native protein containing both α and β subunits (34Realini C.

Thus, we hypothesized that the β subunit might act to mediate function of the α subunit, perhaps by increasing the affinity of PA28 for the proteasome. The purpose of the present work was to further define the structural requirements of the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit in proteasome activation and to examine the functional role of the β subunit in PA28 function. Therefore, we performed mutational analysis of the α subunit to study structure/function relationships for this protein. We have also established the role of the β subunit by reconstituting heteromeric PA28 from it and wild type or mutant α subunits. Mutations of rat PA28α were generated by PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Suc, succinyl; AMC, 7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. using the previously described PA28α plasmid as a template (35Ahn J.

Mutations were introduced in the 3′-PCR primer, changing the last codon for tyrosine to codons for tryptophan, phenylalanine, serine, lysine, glutamic acid, or to a stop codon. The 5′-PCR primer has a NcoI restriction site at its end and the 3′-PCR primer has a BamHI site. The PCR products as well as the pET16b vector (Novagen) were digested with both NcoI and BamHI (Life Technologies, Inc.). Digested PCR product and vector were ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was transformed into Escherichia colistrain DH5α. For construction of the mutant lacking the KEKE domain, PCR was used to generate two fragments of PA28α cDNA, one encoding amino acid residues 1–69 and a second encoding amino acid residues 96–249. The former has a NcoI site at its 5′ end and a SalI site at its 3′ end. The latter has aSalI site at its 5′ end and a BamHI site at its 3′ end. The restriction enzyme-digested PCR products and the pET16b vector DNA digested with NcoI and BamHI were ligated with T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixture was transformed intoE. coli strain DH5α. The PA28α-KEKE/-Y249 mutant was generated using the same strategy as that for the other carboxyl-terminal mutants, but used the PA28α-KEKE DNA as the template.

The identities of all mutant constructs were verified by sequencing using an ABI PRISMTM377 automated DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer Corp). PA28α mutants were expressed in E. coli strain BL21 (DE3) and purified as described previously for the wild type PA28α (36Song X. Mott J.D. von Kampen J. Pramanik B. Tanaka K. Slaughter C.A.

This fragment was cloned into pET16b digested with NcoI and NdeI and blunt ended with Klenow fragment; the resulting plasmid was designated pJVK39. The identity of the PA28β-encoding sequence was verified by sequencing. For expression of PA28β, pJVK39 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3). Expression was induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (1 mm final concentration). After 3.5 h of induction, the cells were harvested, washed with buffer H (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, at 4 °C, 20 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol), collected by centrifugation, and frozen at −70 °C. The cells were thawed on ice and resuspended in 15 ml of buffer H containing 0.3 mg/ml lysozyme and incubated on ice for 20 min. After sonication, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (40,000 × g for 15 min). PA28β was present in both the soluble and insoluble fraction as determined by Western blot analysis with anti-PA28β antibodies. PA28β was purified from the soluble fraction by column chromatography. The insoluble pellet was resuspended in 8 m urea and dialyzed extensively against buffer H. The small amount of precipitate that formed during dialysis was removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was purified by ion exchange chromatography. The sample was applied to a 5 × 2.5-cm column of DEAE-Fractogel equilibrated with buffer H containing 150 mm NaCl and eluted with a 100-ml linear gradient of 150–400 mm NaCl in buffer H. The data presented in this study use PA28β purified from the pellet fraction, although similar results were obtained for the originally soluble protein. Heterodimeric PA28 was reconstituted from purified recombinant proteins including native PA28α or various PA28α mutants, and PA28β. Equal volumes of proteins at 0.2 mg/ml (i.e. final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml for each protein) were preincubated in buffer H containing 5% glycerol for 16 h at 4 °C. Immunoprecipitation of PA28 reconstituted from recombinant subunits was conducted as described previously for native PA28 with minor modifications, using antisera specific for either PA28α or PA28β (36Song X.

Seven μl of serum (except for the precipitation of protein containing the PA28α-Y249 and PA28α-KEKE/-Y249 constructs, where 14 μl of serum were used) was preincubated with 300 μl of a 1/6 suspension of protein A-Sepharose CL-4B in TTBS (TBS containing 0.05% Tween 20) for 1.5 h at 4 °C. 15 μl of reconstituted PA28, prepared as described above (0.2 mg/ml in buffer H containing 5% glycerol) and 250 μl of bovine serum albumin (0.2 mg/ml in TTBS) were added to the washed beads. The suspension was shaken gently for 1.5 h at 4 °C, after which the pellet was collected by centrifugation. The equivalent of 8 μl of supernatant was subjected to SDS-PAGE. The pellet was washed three times with TTBS and heated to 100 °C with 100 μl of 2 × SDS sample buffer lacking β-mercaptoethanol. Ten μl of this sample were subjected to SDS-PAGE. PA28 was assayed for its ability to stimulate the hydrolysis of Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC by the purified 20 S proteasome, as described previously (30Ma C. Slaughter C.A. DeMartino G.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10515-10523Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One unit of PA28 activity is defined as the increase of 1 unit of proteasome activity, and is expressed as the difference between proteasome activity in the presence and absence of PA28. Additional details are found in appropriate figure legends. Glycerol density gradient centrifugation was carried out in 1.98-ml gradients (10–40% glycerol) containing 50 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.6, and 5 mm β-mercaptoethanol. Protein samples (2 μg in 10 μl) were centrifuged for 4.5 h at 55,000 rpm in a Beckman TL100 ultracentrifuge using a TLS55 rotor at 4 °C. Tubes were fractionated into 22 90-μl fractions, and the distribution of proteins was determined by Western blotting. Our previous work demonstrated that the carboxyl terminus of the α subunit of PA28 is essential for activation of peptide hydrolysis by the 20 S proteasome (36Song X. Mott J.D. von Kampen J.

Treatment of either native PA28, which contains both α and β subunits, or recombinant PA28α with carboxypeptidase Y resulted in the loss of each protein's ability to activate the proteasome (36Song X.

To define the precise modification of PA28α responsible for loss of proteasome stimulating activity, a mutant of this subunit lacking only the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine residue was expressed in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Fig.1). This protein, designated α-Y249, had no detectable proteasome stimulatory activity (Fig.2). Therefore, deletion of tyrosine from the carboxyl terminus of PA28α results in complete loss of function for this protein. Furthermore, the lack of stimulatory activity of this mutant results from its inability to bind to the proteasome (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of recombinant PA28α and PA28α mutants on the activity of the proteasome. Purified recombinant PA28α proteins from Fig. 1 and purified native bovine PA28 were tested for their ability to activate purified latent 20 S proteasome using the fluorogenic substrate Suc-Leu-Leu-Val-Tyr-AMC, as described under “Materials and Methods.” Each assay contained 0.24 μg of proteasome (1.9 units/assay) and the indicated amounts of PA28 proteins.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To further examine the structural requirements of the carboxyl terminus of PA28α for proteasome activation, additional mutants were constructed, expressed in E. coli, and purified as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig. 1). These altered proteins included those in which the carboxyl-terminal tyrosine was changed to: tryptophan (Y249ΔW), phenylalanine (Y249ΔF), serine (Y249ΔS), lysine (Y249ΔK), or glutamic acid (Y249ΔE). As reported previously, PA28α stimulates the proteasome to the same extent as does native PA28 (containing both α and β subunits), but requires about 5–10 times more protein to achieve half-maximal activation (K act) (36Song X.

The Y249ΔW mutant, however, had the same K act as native heteromeric PA28. The Y249ΔF and Y249ΔS mutants were much poorer proteasome stimulators than wild type PA28α and had 3 and 10 times higherK act values, respectively. In contrast, the Y249ΔK and Y249ΔE mutants failed to activate the proteasome. These results demonstrate that activation of the proteasome by PA28α is dependent on the identity of a single amino acid at its carboxyl terminus. PA28α contains a segment of 28 amino acids (residues 70–97) with an unusually high content of lysine and glutamic acid residues (34Realini C. Dubiel W. Pratt G. Ferrell K. Rechsteiner M. J. Biol.

This feature, known as a KEKE motif, has been postulated to participate in protein-protein interactions (41Realini C. Rogers S.W. Rechsteiner M. FEBS Lett. 1994; 348: 109-113Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). KEKE motifs are present in numerous proteins including some subunits of the proteasome. Interestingly, however, a KEKE motif is not present in PA28β (35Ahn J. Tanahashi N. Akiyama K. Hisamatsu H. Noda C. Tanaka K. Chung C.H. Shimbara N. Willly P.J. Mott J.D. Slaughter C.A.

To investigate the role of the KEKE domain for PA28α function, a mutant in which this domain was deleted was expressed inE. coli, purified, and assayed for proteasome stimulatory activity.

An important issue involves the identities of the upstream signals and regulators that might control the biological functions of mammalian Ste20-related protein kinases. HPK1 is a protein-serine/threonine kinase that possesses a Ste20-like kinase domain, and in transfected cells activates a protein kinase pathway leading to the stress-activated protein kinase SAPK/JNK. Here we have investigated candidate upstream regulators that might interact with HPK1. HPK1 possesses an N-terminal catalytic domain and an extended C-terminal tail with four proline-rich motifs. The SH3 domains of Grb2 bound in vitro to specific proline-rich motifs in the HPK1 tail and functioned synergistically to direct the stable binding of Grb2 to HPK1 in transfected Cos1 cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation did not affect the binding of Grb2 to HPK1 but induced recruitment of the Grb2·HPK1 complex to the autophosphorylated EGF receptor and to the Shc docking protein. Several activated receptor and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases, including the EGF receptor, stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of the HPK1 serine/threonine kinase. These results suggest that HPK1, a mammalian Ste20-related protein-serine/threonine kinase, can potentially associate with protein-tyrosine kinases through interactions mediated by SH2/SH3 adaptors such as Grb2. Such interaction may provide a possible mechanism for cross-talk between distinct biochemical pathways following the activation of tyrosine kinases.

In the budding yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the Ste20 serine/threonine protein kinase regulates a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1The abbreviations used are: MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; GST, glutathioneS-transferase; HA, hemagglutinin; HPK1, hematopoietic progenitor kinase 1; Tyr(P), phosphotyrosine; SAPK/JNK, stress-activated protein kinase/Jun N-terminal kinase; SH3 domain, Src homology 3 domain; R, receptor; SPR, surface plasmon resonance; DTT, dithiothreitol; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; EGF, epidermal growth factor. pathway, composed of the Ste11 (MEK kinase), Ste7 (MEK), and Fus3/Kss1 (MAPK) protein kinases (1Herskowitz I. Cell. 1995; 80: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar). Ste20 controls the mating response of haploid cells and is positioned by genetic epistasis analysis between heterotrimeric G proteins activated by the α factor mating pheromone and the MAPK cassette (2Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). In addition to its role in the mating pathway, yeast Ste20 participates in the development of nitrogen-deprived diploid cells into a filamentous pseudohyphal form and in the ability of haploid cells to invade an agar substrate (3Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.-O. van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar, 4Roberts R.L. Fink G.R. Gene Dev. 1994; 8: 2974-2985Crossref PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Ste20 specifically associates through an N-terminal regulatory sequence with the small GTPase Cdc42 (2Zhao Z.S. Leung T. Manser E. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5246-5257Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar), an interaction that results in the localization of cytosolic Ste20 to specific membrane sites. Of interest, the interaction of Ste20 with Cdc42 is essential for cell invasion and pseudohyphal formation, as well as for an effect of Ste20 in stabilizing septin-containing microfilaments during cytokinesis, but is dispensable for the mating response (3Peter M. Neiman A.M. Park H.-O. van Lohuizen M. Herskowitz I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7046-7059Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar). Thus Ste20 appears to have pleiotropic functions in the yeast cell and to have both multiple upstream activators and downstream biological outputs. Recent work has identified a number of mammalian kinases whose catalytic domains are closely related in sequence to that of yeast Ste20 (5Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar). Among these, members of the PAK family share the same overall structure as Ste20, consisting of a C-terminal kinase domain, and an N-terminal regulatory region that contains binding motifs for the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 (6Sells M.A. Chernoff J. Trends Cell Biol. 1997; 7: 162-167Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), as well as for the second of the three SH3 domains of the adaptor protein Nck. Interactions with these signaling proteins may both relocalize PAK1 and PAK3 to the membrane and stimulate their kinase activity (7Lu W. Katz S. Gupta R. Mayer B.J. Curr.

The SAPKs, as well as the related kinases of the p38/CSBP/RK family are of considerable interest, as they are activated in response to numerous stimuli, including inflammatory cytokines, ischemia, ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic drugs, and heat shock (5Kyriakis J.M. Avruch J. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 567-577Crossref PubMed Scopus (661) Google Scholar).

HPK1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is widely expressed during embryonic development and becomes restricted to hematopoietic organs in the adult (13Hu M.C.-T. Qiu W.R. Wang X. Meyer C.F.

MLK3, in turn, can stimulate SEK (MKK4), thereby leading to activation of SAPK (14Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7026-7035Crossref PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar). Here we have investigated potential mechanisms through which cell surface receptors might be linked to HPK1. HPK1 contains four proline-rich motifs in its C-terminal tail, suggesting that it might associate with cytoplasmic signaling proteins that possess SH3 domains. Here we show that HPK1 binds SH2/SH3 adaptor proteins, notably Grb2,in vivo. In a transfection model, Grb2 bound constitutively through its SH3 domains to HPK1. Upon EGF stimulation the Grb2·HPK1 complex was recruited to the autophosphorylated EGF receptor and to the Shc docking protein, and HPK1 was detectably phosphorylated on tyrosine. These and related data suggest that SH2/SH3 adaptors such as Grb2 can link tyrosine kinases to HPK1, a Ste20-related serine/threonine protein kinase. Grb2, which couples tyrosine kinase to the Ras GTPase, may thereby provide a molecular bridge between different biochemical pathways and consequently a mechanism for interpathway cross-talk. Varying cDNA fragments encoding the proline-rich region of HPK1 as indicated in Fig. 2,top, were cloned into pACTII (53Durfee T. Becherer K. Chen P.-L. Yeh S.-H. Yang Y. Kilburn A.E. Lee W.-H.

Yeast transformation was performed by the lithium acetate method (55Ausubel F. Brent M.R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1990Google Scholar) except that 10% dimethyl sulfoxide (Me2SO) was included during 42 °C heat shock. Co-expression of pASI and pACTII vectors was achieved by mating Y153 and Y187 yeast strains, each containing the appropriate vector. β-Galactosidase activity was detected on 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside plates after permeabilizing the yeast by liquid nitrogen treatment. Peptides were synthesized on an Applied Biosystems Inc. ABI 431A synthesizer using standard 9-fluorenyl methoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) chemistry with 2-(1H-benzotriazol-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate activation on p-alkoxybenzyl alcohol (HMP) resin as outlined by the manufacturer. Cleavage of the peptide from the resin and deprotection was achieved through a 90-min incubation at room temperature in trifluoroacetic acid (10 ml) and a scavenger mixture composed of water/thioanisole/1,2-ethanedithiol (5.0:0.2:0.1% by volume) and solid phenol (75 mg). The product was precipitated with cold t-butyl ethyl ether, collected by centrifugation, and purified using reverse phase high pressure liquid chromatography. The authenticity of the phosphopeptides was confirmed by amino acid analysis and mass spectrometry. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis carried out to quantitate peptide binding to Grb2 in a competition assay was performed using a BIAcore apparatus (Pharmacia Biosensor). A GST fusion protein containing residues 291–518 of HPK1 resuspended in 50 mmsodium acetate, 150 mm NaCl, pH 4.0, was immobilized onto the surface of a CM5 sensor chip surface following conditions described previously for immobilization of mSos1 (56Chook Y.-M.

The amount of Grb2 bound was estimated from the steady-state surface plasmon resonance signal at a fixed time during the injection and the percentage bound relative to injection of Grb2 alone calculated. After each injection the GST-HPK1 surface was regenerated using 0.1 m NaOH and 1 m NaCl. Anti-HPK1 N-terminal antibodies-(1–18) were raised against the peptide MALYDPDIFNKDPREHYD, corresponding to the first 18 amino acids of HPK1. 1–18 antibodies did not interfere with HPK1-Grb2 complex formation and were used for co-immunoprecipitation experiments described in Figs. 4, 5, 6.Figure 5HPK1 associates with the activated EGF receptor.

Whole cell lysates were blotted with anti-HA to detect HA-Grb2 expression (middle panel) or blotted with anti-Tyr(P) (anti pTyr) antibodies to detect autophosphorylated EGF receptor (bottom panel). Thetwo right-hand lanes represent untransfected controls. EGF stimulation did not affect formation of the HA-Grb2·HPK1 complex.B, Cos1 cells were co-transfected with HA-Grb2 and HPK1 and either serum-deprived (−) or stimulated with EGF (+). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to the EGF receptor (αEGFR), HA (αHA), or HPK1 (αHPK1), and the immunoprecipitates were blotted with antibodies to the EGF receptor. EGF stimulation induced the association of both HA-Grb2 and HPK1 with the EGF receptor. C, Cos1 cells were co-transfected with HA-Grb2 and either wild type (wt) or kinase-deficient (kd, K46E) HPK1 and either serum-deprived (−) or stimulated with EGF (+). Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-EGF receptor antibodies and blotted with antibodies to HPK1.

Cos1 cells were transiently transfected with HA-Grb2 alone or in combination with HPK1. The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of sodium vanadate for 90 min, followed by EGF stimulation as indicated. HPK1 was precipitated with antibodies directed to the HPK1 proline-rich region. Tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1 was analyzed by blotting the immunoprecipitations (IP) with affinity purified rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine (anti pTyr) antibodies.

The cell pellets were homogenized by sonication in bacterial lysis buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100, 1% Tween 20, 2 mm DTT, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 2 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The lysates were subjected to centrifugation at 28,000 × g for 30 min. The supernatants were then mixed with glutathione-agarose (Sigma), and the beads were washed 4 times with the bacterial lysis buffer, stored at 4 °C in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.05% sodium azide and used for in vitro binding assays. Cell lysates from HPK1-transfected cells were incubated with approximately 1 μg of GST fusion protein coupled to glutathione-agarose (Sigma) in lysis buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl2, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 100 mm sodium fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 15 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). The beads were washed three times and treated at 95 °C for 5 min with SDS sample buffer. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose filter. Associated HPK1 was detected by Western blot analysis with anti-HPK1 antisera. Cos1 cells were transiently transfected with wild type or mutated forms of the HA-Grb2 pCDNA3 expression vector alone or in combination with an HPK1 expression vector. After 48 h of growth in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (high glucose) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, the cells were placed in serum-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium contain 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, for 18 h prior to EGF stimulation. After treatment, the cells were rinsed three times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed with lysis buffer A (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 120 mm NaCl2, 1% Nonidet P-40, 5 mmDTT, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 25 mm sodium fluoride, 200 μm sodium orthovanadate, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). HPK1 was immunoprecipitated by rabbit anti-HPK1 1–18 antibodies, and the complexes were subjected to Western blot analysis as indicated under “Results.” Cos1 cells were transiently transfected with HPK1 expression vector alone or in combination with expression vectors for tyrosine kinases, as indicated. The cells were starved in serum-free medium prior to EGF and PDGF stimulation. HPK1 was immunoprecipitated using specific anti-HPK1 antibodies directed to the proline-rich region of HPK1. Tyrosine phosphorylation of HPK1 was analyzed by blotting the immunoprecipitated protein with affinity purified rabbit anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies or with monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies (4G10 from UBI Inc.). A cluster of four proline-rich sequences (P1–P4) are located in the C-terminal tail of HPK1, in the region following the kinase domain (Fig. 1 A). Three of these proline-rich elements (P1, P2, and P4) display high sequence homology with motifs located in the tail of mSos1 that bind Grb2 SH3 domains (Fig. 1 B) (26Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernlet R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar, 27Li N. Batzer A. Daly R. Yajnik V. Skolnik E. Chardin P. Bar-Sagi D. Margolis B. Schlessinger J.

These HPK1 motifs conform to the sequence consensus for SH3 binding sites in the class II orientation (Fig. 1 B) (29Feng S. Chen J.K. Yu H. Simon J.A. Schreiber S.L. Science. 1994; 266: 1241-1247Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar, 30Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar). Structural analysis has shown that such elements adopt a left-handed polyproline type II helix, in which two pairs of aliphatic-proline residues occupy relatively conserved hydrophobic pockets on the SH3 domain, while the P−3residue binds a more variable specificity pocket. The SH3 domains of adaptors such as Grb2 preferentially recognize a basic residue at the P−3 position, as found in the HPK1 proline-rich motifs. We initially used the yeast two-hybrid system to analyze the ability of the proline-rich regions of HPK1 to bind specific SH3 domains. A fragment of HPK1 encompassing all four proline-rich sites (construct 1234, Fig. 2) bound to both N-terminal and C-terminal SH3 domains of Grb2, to a polypeptide containing the three Nck SH3 domains, to the SH3 domain of the MLK3/SPRK1 serine kinase, and more weakly to the Abl SH3 domain. A more detailed analysis of these interactions using shorter HPK1 polypeptides with one, two, or three of the proline-rich motifs showed some differences in binding specificity. For example, the Grb2 SH3-C domain associated with a polypeptide containing only the P2 site, whereas the Grb2 SH3-N domain did not. The Grb2 SH3-N domain showed an interaction with P1, whereas both Grb2 SH3 domains bound a polypeptide containing sites P3 and P4. The ability of the individual Grb2 SH3 domains to bind HPK1 with distinct specificities suggests that both SH3 domains of Grb2 might simultaneously recognize HPK1. Furthermore, in the yeast two-hybrid assay, the three Nck SH3 domains interacted with all of the HPK1 proline-rich polypeptides, indicating that Nck might also recognize multiple HPK1 proline motifs. We have shown previously (14Kiefer F. Tibbles L.A. Anafi M. Janssen A. Zanke B.W. Lassam N. Pawson T. Woodgett J.R. Iscove N.N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 7013-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar) that HPK1 binds MLK3, which in turn can activate SEK and thereby stimulate SAPK. The MLK3 SH3 domain only interacted with HPK1 polypeptides containing the P3 and P4 sites. To test these interactions directly, immobilized GST fusion proteins containing specific SH3 domains were incubated with cell lysates from HPK1-transfected cells. The GST fusion proteins and any associated polypeptides were then harvested using glutathione-agarose beads and probed for the presence of HPK1 using Western blot analysis (Fig.3 A). The individual Grb2 SH3 domains each formed a complex with HPK1, although in this assay the N-terminal SH3 domain interacted more strongly. A GST fusion protein containing full-length Grb2 bound HPK1 more tightly than either SH3 domain alone, indicating that the two SH3 domains of Grb2 may bind HPK1 in a bidentate fashion, as suggested by the two-hybrid analysis. A GST fusion containing the three Nck SH3 domains also bound HPK1, although more weakly than GST-Grb2. Neither GST alone, nor fusion proteins containing the Abl or phospholipase C-γ1 SH3 domains, bound detectable amounts of HPK1 in vitro, suggesting that thein vitro interactions of HPK1 with the Grb2 and Nck SH3 domains are relatively specific. To probe further the regions of HPK1 that might interact with Grb2, we prepared a series of peptides corresponding to the proline-rich regions of HPK1 and tested their ability to inhibit Grb2 binding to the tail of HPK1 as monitored using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology. In this SPR assay a purified GST-HPK1 fusion protein containing amino acids 291–518 was immobilized to a Biosensor chip surface (BIAcore"

The roles of the intermolecular bond at Cys6 and the collagen-like domain (Gly8-Pro80) in the interactions of SP-A with phospholipids and alveolar type II cells were investigated using mutant forms of the protein. Wild type SP-A (SP-Ahyp), SP-A with the substitution Cys6 → Ser to prevent disulfide formation (SP-Ahyp,C6S), and SP-A with the collagen-domain deleted (SP-AΔG8-P80) were synthesized in insect cells using recombinant baculoviruses. The SP-As were glycosylated and secreted from the invertebrate cells and the binding affinities of the wild type and mutant proteins for the mannose-Sepharose matrix used for purification were nearly identical. The SP-Ahyp and SP-AΔG8-P80 were at least nonameric in solution based on gel exclusion chromatography, and demonstrated extensive sulfhydryl-dependent oligomerization under nonreducing conditions. The SP-Ahyp,C6S was also oligomeric in solution and formed disulfide-dependent dimers, indicating the presence of at least one additional interchain disulfide bond. The SPAΔG8-P80 but not the SP-Ahyp,C6S aggregated lipid vesicles at 20 °C and augmented the surface tension lowering effect of extracts of natural surfactant. The SP-AΔG8-P80 competed poorly with native SP-A for receptor occupancy on isolated alveolar type II cells and was a potent but nonspecific (concanavalin A-like) inhibitor of surfactant secretion. In contrast, the SP-Ahyp,C6S partially competed for receptor occupancy and weakly inhibited surfactant secretion in a specific manner. Neither the SP-AΔG8-P80 nor the SP-Ahyp,C6S supported the association of phospholipid liposomes with type II cells. We conclude that: 1) the Cys6interchain disulfide bond of SP-A is required for aggregation of liposomes and for potent inhibition of surfactant secretion. 2) The collagen-like region is required for competition with125I-SP-A for receptor occupancy and specific inhibition of surfactant secretion in the presence of competing sugars. 3) Both the NH2-terminal disulfide and the collagen-like region are required to enhance the association of phospholipid vesicles with type II cells.

(1997) Biochemistry, in press. forms of SP-A have demonstrated the involvement of the COOH-terminal domains of the protein in ligand and receptor binding, the regulation of surfactant secretion and lipid uptake by type II cells. Several laboratories have explored the functional role of the collagen-like domain of SP-A. Treatment of SP-A with collagenase produces a peptide composed of the neck and CRD of the protein, termed the collagenase-resistant fragment (CRF), which has been used to assess functional properties of the collagen-like region. The CRF binds dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) (21Kuroki Y. Akino T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3068-3073Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), mixed phospholipid liposomes (22Ross G.F. Notter R.H. Meuth J. Whitsett J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14283-14291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and carbohydrate (23Haagsman H.P. Hawgood S. Sargeant T. Buckley D. White R.T. Drickamer K. Benson B.J. J. Biol.

Akino T. Biochem. Int. 1991; 24: 225-233PubMed Google Scholar). The CRF also binds to the SP-A receptor on alveolar type II cells with reduced affinity (25Wright J.R. Borchelt J.D. Hawgood S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5410-5414Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) and is only 0.5% as potent as native SP-A as an inhibitor of the secretion of phospholipid from alveolar type II cells (26Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). One limitation of the protease-based analysis of SP-A is that the NH2-terminal disulfide cross-linking of subunits is also lost upon collagenase digestion, producing a weakly-associated trimer (15Haagsman H.P. White R.T. Schilling J. Lau K. Benson B.J. Golden J. Hawgood S. Clements J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L429-L442Google Scholar). The loss of functional activities may therefore be due either to the elimination of the collagen-like region or of intermolecular cross-linking. Selective disruption of the interchain disulfide bridge at the NH2terminus of dog SP-A by partial reduction and alkylation reduced the affinity of the protein for phospholipid and blocked the aggregation of liposomes, but nonspecific modifications of the protein could not be completely excluded (27Ross G.F. Sawyer J. O'Connor T. Whitsett J.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 858-865Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Thus, the collagen-like region and the disulfide bridges at the NH2 terminus of SP-A play important roles in biological function, but dissection of their individual contributions using biochemical means has been problematic. Recent studies have elucidated the intersubunit disulfide bridge structure of rat SP-A. The appearance of disulfide-dependent tetramers and hexamers of rat SP-A on nonreducing SDS-PAGE analysis provides direct evidence for at least two intermolecular disulfide bonds. Protease mapping data indicates that all intermolecular cross-links are localized to the NH2terminus (26Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Yet, the deduced primary structure of rat SP-A as reported by Sano et al. (28Sano K. Fisher J. Mason R.J. Kuroki Y. Schilling J. Benson B. Voelker D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 144: 367-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) predicts that only Cys6 within this region is available for interchain disulfide formation. Recently, Elhalwagi et al. (29Elhalwagi B.M. Damodarasamy M. McCormack F.X. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 7018-7025Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) reported a second interchain disulfide bridge in rat SP-A, within an NH2-terminal extension of a minor isoform that arises by alternate site signal peptidase cleavage. Thus, the rat SP-A is a heterooligomer of two isoforms which form multimers through two interchain disulfide bonds at the NH2 terminus. In this study we used mutant recombinant forms of SP-A to evaluate the role of the Cys6 disulfide bond and the collagen-like region in the interaction of the protein with type II cells and phospholipids. Our results demonstrate that the Cys6disulfide bond and the collagen-like region make important and distinct contributions to the functions of SP-A. Common salts and buffers were obtained from Sigma.

The nucleotides encoding Gly8-Pro80 of the mature protein were deleted to produce the collagen-deletion mutant form of SP-A. The intermolecular disulfide bond at Cys6 of SP-A was disrupted by alteration of the codon for Cys6 to encode serine. The mutant proteins were ligated into the EcoRI site of the PVL 1392 recombination vector (InVitrogen) adjacent to the polyhedrin promoter and proper orientation was confirmed by restriction mapping with KpnI. Recombinant baculoviruses were produced by cotransfection of Spodoptera frugiperda cells with the PVL1392/SP-A constructs and modified linear viral DNA (Baculogold, Pharmingen).

The SP-A content of tissue culture media containing recombinant proteins was determined using a rabbit polyclonal IgG against rat SP-A and a sandwich ELISA technique (36McCormack F.X. Fisher J.H. Suwabe A. Smith D.L. Shannon J.M. Voelker D.R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1990; 1087: 190-198Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Recombinant SP-As were harvested from culture media by adsorption to mannose-Sepharose 6B in the presence of 1 mm calcium and elution with 2 mm EDTA (15Haagsman H.P. White R.T. Schilling J. Lau K. Benson B.J. Golden J. Hawgood S. Clements J.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1989; 257: L429-L442Google Scholar). The recovered recombinant SP-As were dialyzed against 5 mmTris (pH 7.4) and stored at −20 °C. Protein samples were separated on 8–16% SDS-PAGE gels (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207200) Google Scholar) and either stained with Coomassie Blue or transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. For immunoblotting, membranes with adsorbed protein species were incubated with 5 μg/ml polyclonal anti-SP-A IgG antibody covalently linked to horseradish peroxidase and developed with 1 mg/ml 3,3′-diaminobenzidine tetrachloride as the substrate (38Burnette W.N. Anal. Biochem. 1981; 112: 195-201Crossref PubMed Scopus (5915) Google Scholar). The apparent molecular mass of the SP-A was determined by gel exclusion chromatography on Bio-Gel A-5m (90 × 1.6 cm column) in 5 mm Tris (pH 7.4) at room temperature. Alveolar type II cells were isolated from male Sprague-Dawley rats by tissue dissociation with elastase and purification on metrizamide gradients (39Dobbs L.G. Mason R.J. Am. Rev. Respir. Dis. 1978; 118: 705-733Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The cells were seeded at a density of 2 × 106/35-mm dish and cultured for 21 h with [3H]choline (0.5 μCi/ml) supplemented growth media. Secretion of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine was determined as described previously (33Kuroki Y. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3388-3394Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (10−7m) was used as a stimulant of surfactant secretion and SP-A variants were tested for the ability to act as antagonists. After a 3-h incubation, radiolabeled lipid was extracted from the cells and media. Percent secretion was defined as [3H]phospholipid in the media/([3H]phospholipid in the cells + media). In some experiments, 0.25 m α-methylmannoside was included in the incubation to compete for SP-A binding nonspecifically to cell surface carbohydrate. The binding of variant forms of SP-A to the receptor on alveolar type II cells was determined using a competitive assay, as previously reported (18McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). 125I-Rat SP-A was prepared using radiolabeled Bolton and Hunter reagent as described (40Bolton A.E. Hunter W.M. Biochem. J. 1973; 133: 529Crossref PubMed Scopus (2398) Google Scholar). The specific activity ranged from 100 to 300 cpm/ng and trichloroactetic acid routinely precipitated more than 95% of the label. Primary cultures of day 1 alveolar type II cells were incubated with 1.0 μg/ml 125I-rat SP-A and varying concentrations of unlabeled rat or recombinant SP-As (0–50 μg/ml) at 37 °C for 3 h in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and a 10% CO2 atmosphere. The monolayers were then placed on ice, washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline, solubilized with 0.1n NaOH, and radioactivity measured in a scintillation counter. Lipids were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Unilamellar liposomes were prepared from a mixture of DPPC:egg phosphatidylcholine (PC):egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG), 9:3:2, as described previously (19McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). For aggregation experiments, 200 μg of unilamellar liposomes and 10 μg of SP-A were mixed in a cuvette in 1 ml of 100 mm NaCl, 50 mm Tris at 20 or 37 °C. After a 3-min equilibration, Ca2+ was added to a final concentration of 5 mmand light scattering was measured at 400 nm in a spectrophotometer for 5–7 min. Multilamellar liposomes were prepared from a mixture of DPPC:DPPG, 9:1. After removal of organic solvents under a stream of nitrogen gas, the lipids were hydrated in 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm Tris (pH 7.4) at 48 °C for 1 h. Liposomes were formed by vortexing vigorously for 5 min. For lipid binding, 100 μg of multilamellar liposomes were equilibrated with 0.2 μg of SP-A in 50 μl of 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, 20 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. Following incubation for 1 h at 25 °C, the binding of recombinant SP-A or rat SP-A to multilamellar liposomes was determined by centrifugation at 14,000 × g av for 10 min at 20 °C and ELISA measurement of SP-A content of the pellet and supernatant fractions. Percent binding was defined as (SP-Apellet)/(SP-Apellet+supernatant × 100). Control experiments where liposomes or calcium were deleted were also performed. The effect of variant SP-As on the surface tension of bovine lipid extract surfactant (BLES) during dynamic compression was monitored using the bubble surfactometer as described previously (8Cockshutt A.M. Weitz J. Possmayer F. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 8424-8429Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar, 41Enhorning G. J. Appl. Physiol. 1977; 43: 198-203Crossref PubMed Scopus (481) Google Scholar). Briefly, a bubble of ambient air was formed in a chamber containing a BLES suspension and pulsated at 30 °C at a rate of 20 cycles/min between fixed radii (0.4–0.55 mm). The pressure across the bubble was measured by a pressure transducer and surface tension was calculated by the Laplace equation,p = 2γ/r. All surfactant samples were assayed at 1 ng/ml BLES in buffer containing 1.5 mmCaCl2 and 0.9% NaCl. SPAs were added at 5% wt/wt lipid. The carbohydrate binding affinity of the recombinant proteins was examined by monosaccharide competition for SP-A binding to mannose-Sepharose beads. Nonspecific binding sites in the microcentrifuge tubes were blocked by a preincubation with binding buffer containing 50 mm Tris, 2 mm Ca2+, 100 mm NaCl, and 1% albumin. Variant SP-As (200 ng) were incubated with 100 μl of mannose-Sepharose beads (50-μl bed volume) in the presence of 0–2m mannose at 4 °C for 1 h in binding buffer. The mixture was centrifuged at 1,000 × g, the supernatant was harvested, and the pellet was washed twice with ice-cold binding buffer. The pellet was transferred to a new tube and eluted with 5 mm EDTA. SP-A in the supernatant plus wash fractions and the pellet were separately quantified by ELISA. For determination of nonspecific binding, EDTA was substituted for Ca2+ in the binding buffer. Uptake of liposomes by freshly isolated type II cells was performed according to the method of Wright (3Wright J.R. Wager R.E. Hawgood S. Dobbs L. Clements J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2888-2894Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Freshly isolated alveolar type II cells (1 × 106/tube) were washed 3 times and incubated with liposomes (100 μg/ml) composed of [3H]DPPC (1600 cpm/nmol):egg PC:PG, 7:2:1. The cells were resuspended in 0.5 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) and incubated with the SP-A variants at the indicated concentrations for 1 h at 37 °C. The media and cells were separated by centrifugation at 160 × g for 5 min at 4 °C and the cells were washed 3 times in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. An additional volume of 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline was added to each tube and the cells and media were transferred to separate liquid scintillation vials and counted. Percent uptake was calculated according to the equation: [3H]DPPCcells/([3H]DPPCcells+ [3H]DPPCmedia) × 100. Recombinant proteins used in this study were synthesized in insect cells using baculovirus vectors. The wild type recombinant SP-A produced in this manner is relatively deficient in hydroxyproline (denoted SP-Ahyp) compared with rat SP-A, but is functionally comparable to the protein isolated from lung lavage (18McCormack F.X. Kuroki Y. Stewart J.J. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29801-29807Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 19McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant recombinant SP-As containing a deletion of the collagen-like domain (SP-AΔG8-P80) or a serine substitution for Cys6 that participates in intermolecular disulfide bond formation (SP-Ahyp,C6S) were expressed using mutant cDNAs for SP-A, generated by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction (Fig. 1). The SP-AΔG8-P80 was secreted at levels of approximately 30–50 μg/107 T. ni cells/ml culture media/72 h and the SP-Ahyp,C6S at levels of 5–15 μg/107 T. ni cells/ml of culture media/72 h. Both proteins bound quantitatively to a mannose-Sepharose affinity column in the presence of 2.5 mm calcium, with less than 5% of the protein appearing in the void volume (data not shown). These results demonstrate that neither the Cys6 disulfide bond nor the collagen-like domain of SP-A is required for secretion from eucaryotic cells or for binding to the mannose-derivatized Sepharose beads. The electrophoretic analysis of the SP-Ahyp,C6S and SP-AΔG8-P80 on 8–16% SDS-PAGE gels is depicted in Fig.2. Under reducing conditions, the rat SP-A migrates as a triplet at 26, 32, and 38 kDa and both the SP-Ahyp and the SP-Ahyp,C6S migrate as a series of bands from 25 to 32 kDa. Differences in migration of the rat SP-A and SP-Ahyp are related to the invertebrate pattern of glycosylation and the absence of hydroxyproline in the collagen-like region of the protein (19McCormack F.X. Calvert H.M. Watson P. Smith D.L. Mason R.J. Voelker D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5833-5841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The 73-amino acid deletion of SP-AΔG8-P80 resulted in faster migration under reducing conditions, producing a band with an apparent mass of 19–21 kDa, similar to the CRF (20–22 kDa) (not shown) described by others (26Murata Y. Kuroki Y. Akino T. Biochem. J. 1993; 291: 71-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Under nonreducing conditions, rat SP-A appeared as multiple bands of higher order disulfide-dependent oligomers that are resolved as far as hexamers, while the SP-Ahyp and SP-AΔG8-P80 formed oligomers through at least trimer. SP-Ahyp,C6S appeared as both a monomer and dimer under these conditions, which indicated the existence of a second intermolecular disulfide bond. Following electrophoresis, the protein species were transferred to nitrocellulose (Fig.3) and reacted with polyclonal antibody to rat SP-A to enhance the detection of less abundant or poorly staining protein species. Higher oligomeric forms of SP-Ahyp and SP-AΔG8-P80 resolved through hexamers were apparent on the blot, indicating that neither hydroxyproline nor the presence of the collagen-like region is required for disulfide-dependent assembly. The immunoblot did not reveal oligomeric species greater than dimer for the SP-Ahyp,C6S.Figure 2Electrophoretic analysis of SP-AΔG8-P80 and SP-Ahyp,C6S.

https://openalex.org/W2002617014,"The peripheral type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) binds benzodiazepines such as RO5-4864 and isoquinoline carboxamide derivatives such as PK11195. This receptor includes anM r 18,000 isoquinoline-binding subunit predominantly located in mitochondrial mem- branes. This protein has been found to copurify with two other mitochondrial proteins, namely the outer membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), also known as mitochondrial porin, and the inner membrane adenine nucleotide carrier. In vitro reconstitution experiments suggested that the PBR was a multimeric complex in which the isoquinoline binding site was on the M r18,000 subunit, denoted pk18, whereas the benzodiazepine binding site required the association of this subunit with VDAC to be expressed. Untransformed cells of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeare devoid of specific binding sites for isoquinolines and benzodiazepines, whereas yeast cells transformed with a pk18-expressing vector exhibit RO5-4864 and PK11195 binding sites that are pharmacologically identical to those of the PBR. To clarify the role of VDAC and of the adenine nucleotide carrier, if any, in the constitution of the benzodiazepine binding site, yeast host strains were constructed in which the corresponding genes had been knocked out. Mitochondria prepared from pk18-producing cells devoid of either VDAC or adenine nucleotide carrier exhibit both benzodiazepine and isoquinoline carboxamide binding sites with little or no change in theK d values as compared with the wild-type background. These results rule out the contention that VDAC is indispensable for establishing the benzodiazepine binding site and are in agreement with the hypothesis that the M r18,000 subunit carries both the isoquinoline carboxamide and benzodiazepine binding domains.

The first is found on the γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor, the location of which is restricted to the central nervous system. The second is found in peripheral and in central tissues and is widely known as the peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) (1Costa E. Guidotti A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1979; 19: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 2Woods M.J. Williams D.C. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1996; 52: 1805-1814Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). The PBR, predominantly located in mitochondrial membranes, displays pharmacological characteristics distinct from the central type. Isoquinoline carboxamide (IQ) derivatives like PK11195 that are high affinity ligands of PBR are ineffective in binding to the central type receptor. The subset of Bz molecules that binds to each type of receptor is also markedly different. For instance, RO5-4864 is a Bz that binds to PBR, at least in human and rat (3Awad M. Gavish M. Biochem Pharmacol. 1989; 38: 3843-3849Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and also to the central receptor, but with a much lower affinity. Purification of rat kidney mitochondrial PBR in a form that retained reversible binding properties yielded a protein fraction composed of three polypeptides ofM r 18,000, 30,000, and 32,000. The two latter subunits were identified as the adenine nucleotide carrier (ADC) and the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC), respectively (4Mc Enery M.W. Snowman A.M. Trifiletti R.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3170-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar). Bzs like [3H]flunitrazepam and [3H]AHN-086 were shown to photolabel theM r 30,000 and M r 32,000 polypeptides nonspecifically (5Riond J. Vita N. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 6Lueddens H.W.M. Newman A.H. Rice K.C. Skolnick P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1986; 29: 540-545PubMed Google Scholar), whereas [3H]PK14104, a fluorinated IQ derivative, specifically photolabeled theM r 18,000 subunit, denoted pk18 (7Doble A. Ferris O. Burgevin M.C. Menager J. Uzan A. Dubroeucq M.C. Renault C. Gueremy C. Le Fur G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1987; 31: 42-49PubMed Google Scholar). It was postulated that the benzodiazepine binding site resided on ADC and/or VDAC, while pk18 carried the IQ binding site (8Mc Enery M.W. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Recently, Garnieret al. (9Garnier M. Dimchev A.B. Boujrad N. Price J.M. Musto N.A. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 201-211PubMed Google Scholar) showed that a purified recombinant construct consisting of pk18 fused to the Escherichia colimaltose-binding protein (MBP) bound the IQ molecule PK11195 but not RO5-4864, a ligand of the Bz family, in an in vitroreconstruction system. RO5-4864 binding sites were restored by adding purified VDAC to the hybrid MBP-pk18 construct, whereas VDAC by itself did not show any Bz or IQ binding. The authors concluded that a functional interaction of pk18 with VDAC was necessary to form the Bz binding site. They suggested that the Bz recognition site was constituted by an association of pk18 and VDAC components or, alternatively, that the site might be situated on either pk18 or VDAC and conformational changes induced by the partner was required to make it accessible for Bz binding. Complementary DNA encoding pk18 has been isolated from various species (9Garnier M. Dimchev A.B. Boujrad N. Price J.M. Musto N.A. Papadopoulos V. Mol.

The deduced amino acid sequence of the human clone corresponds to a polypeptide of 169 residues that displays five putative transmembrane regions. Wild-type bakers' yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is devoid of pk18, presents no specific binding sites for IQ and Bz. Recombinant human pk18 was produced in yeast (13Riond J. Leplatois P.

[3H]PK14105 photolabeling of mitochondrial proteins extracted from these recombinant cells revealed a band corresponding to an M r 30,000 polypeptide which was identified as the yeast VDAC1 gene-encoded mitochondrial porin. By means of a series of deletion and site-directed mutagenesis experiments it was demonstrated that a particular residue of the pk18 sequence, namely Val154, was crucial for the expression of the Bz ligand RO5-4864 binding site (16Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar). A single change M154V mutation was sufficient to confer RO5-4864 binding capability to the bovine version of pk18 which was otherwise unable to bind this ligand (16Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 1160-1167PubMed Google Scholar). These results indicated that recombinant pk18 was not only involved in, but also absolutely required for, Bz binding. In this report, we address the corollary question of whether VDAC, ADC, or both, are necessary for forming the Bz binding site with pk18. This issue can be addressed in S. cerevisiae since, in this microorganism, mutants devoid of functional VDAC or ADC remain able to proliferate under certain conditions. It is therefore possible to knock out the VDAC- and ADC-encoding genes in a pk18-producing strain, and examine the effects, if any, of these genetic alterations on Bz and IQ binding. Two VDAC isoforms exist in yeast. They are synthesized from two distinct genes, namely VDAC1 (17Blachly-Dyson E. Peng S. Colombini M. Forte M. Science. 1990; 247: 1233-1236Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) and VDAC2(GenBankTM accession no.P40478). 2M. Forte, manuscript in preparation. 2M. Forte, manuscript in preparation. ADC isoforms are encoded by the genes AAC1, AAC2, andAAC3. The AAC2 gene product appears to be the more abundant ADC isoform in cells grown under aerobic conditions (18Kolarov J. Kolarova N.

The disruption ofVDAC1 was achieved by replacing a 180-nucleotide internal fragment (BclI-EcoRV) of VDAC1 withURA3. VDAC2 was disrupted by introducing the HIS3gene within the MunI and StuI sites. This disruption resulted in the deletion of the entire VDAC2sequence, except for 280 nucleotides at the 3′ end. Gene disruptions were confirmed by Southern blotting or polymerase chain reaction amplification analyses (data not shown). Strain DNY1 (MAT a, aac1::LEU2, aac2::HIS3, his3-11, his3-15, trp1-1, ura3-1, can1-100, ade2-1, leu2-3, leu2-112) was a gift from Dr. D. Nelson (23Nelson D.R. Lawson J.E. Klingenberg M. Douglas M.G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 1159-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Strain EL105 derives from DNY1 by disrupting the AAC3 gene. In EL105, the internal BglII-PvuII fragment ofAAC3 was replaced by the URA3-encompassing fragment. Aac3 gene disruptants were identified by their poor growth phenotype when placed under anaerobic conditions (18Kolarov J. Kolarova N. Nelson N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 12711-12716Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).aac gene disruption was ascertained by genomic DNA analyses using polymerase chain reaction techniques (data not shown). Yeast strains were grown in complex YP (1% Bacto-yeast extract (DIFCO), 2% Bacto-peptone (DIFCO), or minimal YNB (0.67% Bacto-yeast nitrogen base, DIFCO) media. Carbon and energy sources were generally either 2% glucose or 2% glycerol plus 2% galactose for growth and pk18 biosynthesis induction, respectively. To grow strains impaired in both vdac1 and vdac2 genes, glucose and glycerol were replaced by 2% raffinose. Mutants devoid of ADC were grown in 2% glucose then in 2% galactose for pk18 biosynthesis induction. Plasmids pEMR1043 and pEMR1130 are yeast vectors that express human PBR. Both plasmids derive from pEMR971 whose construction and structure were described by Joseph-Liauzun et al. (15Joseph-Liauzun E. Farges R. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Loison G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 155: 195-199Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar). pEMR1043, like pEMR971, is a 2-μm-based replicating vector that contains different elements as follows: an oriT sequence required for the in vivo DNA transfer by trans-kingdom conjugation between yeast and E. coli cells, a PBR expression cassette including the galactose-regulated GRAP1 promoter and the PGKterminator (24Leplatois P. Le Douarin B. Loison G. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) and finally URA3 as the selectable marker. pEMR1043 differs from pEMR971 only by the length of the oriT-encompassing fragment which was about 200 bp shorter in the former plasmid. pEMR1130 differs from pEMR1043 only by replacingTRP1 by URA3 as the selectable marker. Plasmid pEMR1179 is a low copy centromeric vector which derives from pFL39 (25Bonneaud N. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Li G. Labouesse M. Minvielle-Sebastia L. Lacroute F Yeast. 1991; 7: 609-616Crossref PubMed Scopus (500) Google Scholar). Plasmid pEMR1179 contains the neomycin gene of Tn903 which confers G418 resistance (250–500 μg/ml), and the AAC2gene expressed under the control of the PGK promoter. Two methods were used to transform yeast strains. One was by electroporation essentially as described by Becker and Guarente (26Becker D. Guarente L. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 194: 182-187Crossref PubMed Scopus (671) Google Scholar). The other method was by trans-kingdom conjugation experiments (27Heinemann J. Sprague G. Nature. 1989; 340: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar) as follows. S17-1 cells were transformed to ampicillin resistance using DNA of an oriT-containing yeast/E. coli shuttle plasmid. A transformed colony was used as a source of donor cells, cells were grown in ampicillin-containing LB and harvested in mid-exponential phase of growth. Cells were then resuspended in 10 mm MgSO4 at a density of 109/ml. Yeast recipient cells were grown overnight in YPG, pelleted, and resuspended in 10 mm MgSO4 at a density of 108/ml. Donor and recipient cells were mixed in equivalent amounts, the mixture was then poured onto a filter placed on non-selective YPG-agar medium and left to incubate at 30 °C for 4–16 h. The cells were then resuspended in 10 mmMgSO4 and an aliquot was spread onto selective YNBG medium at 30 °C. Ura+ or Trp+ exconjugant colonies appeared 3 days later at a frequency of approximately 10−5per recipient cell. Precultures and cultures for PBR expression experiments were done as follows. Precultures were performed in minimal YNBG medium supplemented so as to fulfill the auxotrophic requirements of the strain. Cells were then harvested and resuspended in complex YP medium containing 2% glycerol, 2% galactose, and 1% ethanol. In the cases where mutants did not grow on glycerol and ethanol, these were replaced by 2% raffinose. Mitochondria were isolated as already described by Fargeset al. (14Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Loison G. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). Yeast mitochondrial fractions (100–250 μg of protein) were preincubated with 100 nm[3H]PK14105 (75 Ci/mmol, Dositek, France) or [3H]flunitrazepam (80 Ci/mmol, NEN France) in the absence (total binding) or in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 μm cold PK11195 or flunitrazepam, respectively. The reaction was performed in the dark in 50 mm Tris/HCl buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mm sucrose in a total volume of 300 ml at 4 °C for 1 h. The mixtures were placed in 1.7-cm2 cell culture dishes, and samples were exposed to UV light (365 nm) for 15 or 60 min, depending on the photolabeling ligand (IQ or Bz, respectively) and analyzed by autoradiographically revealed SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Equilibrium binding studies were carried out at 0 °C in 50 mm Tris/HCl (pH 7.4). Saturation experiments were done as follows. Each incubation mixture (0.3 ml) in triplicate contained a 0.1-ml suspension of yeast mitochondria and the appropriate amounts of [3H]PK11195 (85 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) or [3H]Ro5-4865 (84 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) in the absence (total binding) and in the presence (nonspecific binding) of 10 mm PK11195 or RO5-4864. For competition experiments each incubation mixture (0.3 ml) in triplicate contained a 0.1-ml suspension of yeast mitochondria, 20 nm [3H]PK11195 or [3H]RO5-4864, no other addition (total binding) or the unlabeled ligand at the desired concentration or at 10 mm (nonspecific binding). Each sample was incubated for 1 h at 0 °C, and then rapidly filtered through Whatman GF/C filters pretreated with 0.3% polyethylenimine and washed 3 times with 5 ml of ice-cold Tris/HCl buffer. The filters were then dried and suspended in 5 ml of Beckerman Ready Solv. E.P. mixtures for determination of filter bound radioactivity. A photoactivable Bz ligand, namely [3H]flunitrazepam, was used to label mitochondrial proteins extracted from wild-type S. cerevisiae cells. Several bands of variable intensities were revealed (Fig.1). The two major bands apparently corresponded to M r 30,000 andM r 32,000 proteins. The photolabeledM r 30,000 protein was absent from preparations from vdac mutant strains and probably corresponded to VDAC. Similarly, the M r 32,000 protein was absent from extracts from the adenine nucleotide carrier-defective strains and probably corresponded to the AAC2 gene product. Labeling of both proteins was not inhibited by the addition of excess cold flunitrazepam and could consequently be regarded as nonspecific. Extracts of pEMR1043-transformed cells exhibited an additional band faintly labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam in a reversible manner that apparently corresponded to a M r18,000 polypeptide. This band, likely that of pk18, was also found in pk18-producing vdac cells devoid of the major VDAC, but was hardly detectable in extracts from pk18-producing cells that were devoid of all three AAC gene products. This result confirmed that pk18 was specifically labeled by [3H]flunitrazepam, albeit poorly. [3H]PK14105 nonspecifically labeled aM r 30,000 polypeptide (Fig.2). This photolabeled protein was not detected in vdac mutant extracts, suggesting that it was yeast VDAC. Gel digestion and sequence analyses of this photolabeled protein confirmed its identity as the VDAC1 gene product (not shown). pk18-Producing cells exhibited a strongly labeledM r 18,000 polypeptide. Labeling was inhibited by cold PK14105, as expected. This result confirmed that pk18 was specifically labeled by [3H]PK14105, as already described (5Riond J. Vita N. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar, 13Riond J. Leplatois P. Laurent P. Le Fur G. Caput D. Loison G. Ferrara P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 208: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). RO5-4864 and PK11-195 binding analyses were performed on mitochondrial extracts from various pk18-expressing yeast strains, some of which were defective in ADC and VDAC (Fig. 3,A andB, and Table I). The fact that no VDAC isoform was present had no influence on theK D values estimated for both ligands. An approximately two-fold decrease in the maximal binding capacity for both ligands could be observed in the pk18-expressing cells that were devoid of any VDAC gene product, namely EL302 pEMR1130 (Table I), as compared with W303 cells transformed by the same plasmid (Table I). Such a decrease in pk18 expression was confirmed by Western blot experiments (not shown). This might simply reflect a difference in plasmid copy number between the strains, since this parameter can vary from clone to clone in a host cell genotype-independent manner (24Leplatois P. Le Douarin B. Loison G. Gene (Amst.). 1992; 122: 139-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar,28Loison G. Vidal H. Findeli A. Roitsch Balloul M. Lemoine Y.

Open table in a new tab K D and B max values are expressed in nm and pmol/mg, respectively. Strain EL105 pEMR1130 was impaired in the three AAC genes. Scatchard analyses on mitochondria-enriched fractions of extracts from pEMR1130-transformed EL105 cells revealed no dramatic changes in the dissociation constant (K D ) values for [3H]PK11195 and [3H]RO5-4864 (Fig. 3, A and B, and Table I) as compared with an ADC-producing strain. A slight decrease in RO5-4864 affinity could be suspected in cells devoid of the three isoforms, this decrease could, at least partially, be corrected by expressing the AAC2 gene. Thus, even though yeast ADC was clearly not required to form the binding sites of PK11195 and RO5-4864, it might indirectly enhance the affinity of pk18 for the Bz ligand. Similar experiments were performed using a strain that was devoid of any cytochrome oxidase subunit IV, a mitochondrial polypeptide supposedly not linked to PBR. We checked whether the disruption of the COX4 gene that encoded this cytochrome oxidase subunit could affect the affinity of PBR for both types of ligand. As shown on Table I, mitochondria extracted from a pk18-producing cox4 gene disruptant exhibited PK11195 and RO5-4864 binding with normal K D values, as expected. We checked whether PK11195 binding to PBR could be inhibited by RO5-4864, and reciprocally, in the absence as in the presence of VDAC or AAC. No influence of VDAC or AAC on the binding inhibition could be detected (TablesII andIII).Table IICompetition analysis of [3H]PK14105 binding to yeast-produced recombinant PBR by RO5-4864 and PK11195Strain/genotypeK iRO5-4864PK11195nmWild type43 ± 108 ± 2vdac155 ± 108 ± 2aac1, aac2, aac363 ± 106.5 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Table IIICompetition analysis of [3H]RO5-4864 binding to yeast-produced recombinant PBR by RO5-4864 and PK11195Strain/genotypeK iRO5-4864PK11195nmWild type10 ± 37 ± 2vdac112 ± 14 ± 2aac1, aac2, aac313 ± 116 ± 3 Open table in a new tab Photolabeling of PBR using [3H]PK14105 has revealed a polypeptide of M r 18,000 in a variety of mammalian cells, as well as in recombinant pk18-expressing yeast cells. Transfection experiments with pk18-encoding cDNA in mammalian cell lines result in increased numbers of both IQ and Bz binding sites. Similarly, pk18-expressing vectors confer both IQ and Bz binding capability to yeast transformants (13Riond J. Leplatois P. Laurent P. Le Fur G. Caput D. Loison G. Ferrara P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 208: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). These expression experiments strongly suggest that pk18 by itself contains both the IQ and Bz binding domains. However, there have been several lines of evidence that suggest the association of pk18 with other proteins, including VDAC and ADC. First, mammalian proteins of M rsimilar to VDAC and ADC could be photolabeled with [3H]PK14105 and various photoactivable Bz ligands (1Costa E. Guidotti A. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 1979; 19: 531-543Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar, 5Riond J. Vita N. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1989; 245: 238-244Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). However, photolabeling appears to be nonspecific. Second, VDAC and ADC were observed to copurify with pk18 (4Mc Enery M.W. Snowman A.M. Trifiletti R.R. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 3170-3174Crossref PubMed Scopus (670) Google Scholar) and a VDAC-like protein was shown to be associated to the γ-aminobutyric acid A receptor when copurified on a benzodiazepine affinity column (29Bureau M.H. Khrestchatisky M. Heeren M.A. Zambrowicz E.B. Kim H. Grisar T.M. Colombini A. Tobin A.J. Olsen R.W. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 8679-8684Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). These last results suggested a relationship between VDAC and Bz receptors. The fact that VDAC could be labeled by flunitrazepam and that specific reagents that inhibit VDAC function were able to inhibit PBR ligand binding suggested that the Bz binding domain of PBR was on VDAC (8Mc Enery M.W. Bioenerg. Biomembr. 1992; 24: 63-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Further evidence suggesting a role of VDAC in the formation of the benzodiazepine binding site of PBR came from studies using a recombinant chimeric protein consisting of the maltose-binding protein fused to pk18 (MBP-pk18). Purified MBP-pk18 failed to exhibit any R05-4864 binding sites in a liposome-based reconstitution system, whereas the addition of VDAC restored binding. It is worth noting that purified VDAC by itself did not exhibit any IQ or Bz binding sites, which suggested that Bz binding required the interaction of MBP-pk18 with VDAC in this reconstitution system. In yeast, as already found in mammals, both VDAC and ADC are nonspecifically labeled by irreversible Bzs. However, these proteins are labeled even in wild-type cells which lack pk18 and which do not express any specific IQ and Bz binding sites. It is therefore probable that photolabeling of VDAC and AAC by Bz ligands is irrelevant to PBR. Recombinant bakers' yeast constitutes an attractive model for elucidating whether VDAC, ADC, or other proteins are indeed required to form the Bz binding site of PBR in addition to pk18. Yeast wild-type cells contain various mitochondrial isoforms of VDAC and ADC but are devoid of pk18 and do not present any specific IQ and Bz binding sites. pk18 can be efficiently produced in yeast cells (13Riond J. Leplatois P. Laurent P. Le Fur G. Caput D. Loison G. Ferrara P. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1991; 208: 307-312Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 15Joseph-Liauzun E. Farges R. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Loison G. Gene (Amst.). 1994; 155: 195-199Crossref Scopus (5) Google Scholar), where it is targeted to mitochondrial membranes (30Dussossoy D. Carayon P. Feraut D. Belugou S. Combes T. Canat X. Vidal H. Casellas P. Cytometry. 1996; 24: 39-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). pk18 production in yeast results in the formation of IQ and Bz sites that are pharmacologically similar to authentic PBR. In yeast, mitochondrial functions are dispensable for proliferation, which enables the isolation of mutant strains completely devoid of VDAC or ADC. The fact that such pk18-expressing cells lacking VDAC exhibit RO5-4864 binding sites clearly demonstrates that VDAC and ADC are dispensable for the formation of the Bz-specific binding site. Furthermore, a genetic variation affecting a single amino acid residue in the pk18 sequence has been previously shown to be sufficient for restoring or abolishing Bz binding expression in recombinant yeast cells. It is therefore highly probable that both the Bz and IQ binding sites are on the same protein, i.e. pk18. These two binding sites are nevertheless not fully overlapping, as revealed by various chemical, genetic and physiological studies (14Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Loison G. Ferrara P. FEBS Lett. 1993; 335: 305-308Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 16Farges R. Joseph-Liauzun E. Shire D. Caput D. Le Fur G. Ferrara P. Mol.

Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5707-5718Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Our results with VDAC-lacking cells do not support one of the hypotheses proposed by Garnier et al. (9Garnier M. Dimchev A.B. Boujrad N. Price J.M. Musto N.A. Papadopoulos V. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 201-211PubMed Google Scholar), namely that the Bz recognition site might be partly on pk18 and partly on VDAC. Garnier et al. based their hypothesis on the observation that in in vitroreconstruction experiments the purified VDAC and the purified chimeric construct MBP-pk18 did not exhibit any Bz binding site unless mixed together. That result, in the light of the work we present here, might be interpreted in a different manner. The pk18 domain of the chimeric construct might have adopted a conformation incompatible with Bz-binding, either as a consequence of the fusion with the bacterial protein, or as a result of a partial denaturation event occurring at some step during the purification procedure. The addition of VDAC may have corrected the conformational defect by interacting with the pk18 domain; VDAC would then play a chaperone-like role in this reconstituted system. Quite similarly, a pk18-conformation-modulating role could possibly be proposed for yeast ADC in our system, since in the absence of the major ADC isoform, the K D andK i values estimated for the Bz ligand tend to slightly increase and the flunitrazepam-photolabeledM r 18,000 polypeptide is hardly detectable. Thus, our results do not rule out the alternative hypothesis of Garnieret al. postulating that proteins distinct from pk18 might indirectly modulate the Bz binding site on PBR (i.e. pk18, according to our results) by interacting with this latter polypeptide. The Bz binding domain might correspond to a more restrictive conformational state of the pk18 homopolymer, as compared with the IQ binding domain, this Bz-binding-competent conformation might be stabilized or modulated by other proteins interacting with this complex. Recent results have shown that modifications to the PBR topography are induced upon addition of choriogonadotropin to MA10-Leydig cells, resulting in an increase in both the pk18 cluster size and PBR ligand binding (34Boujrad N. Vidic B. Papadopoulos V. Endocrinology. 1996; 137: 5727-5730Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). This observation confirms that PBR receptors can exist under distinct morphological states. However, since VDAC, whether from yeast or mammals, is dispensable for the Bz binding site of pk18 produced in yeast cells, the conclusion that the Bz binding site of PBR resides, even partly, on VDAC cannot stand. On the contrary, our results support the assumption that both the IQ and Bz binding sites are fully contained within the pk18 sequence. We thank S. Fougou and C. Pecker for their excellent technical assistance. We are also grateful to M. Forte, D. Nelson, and B. Guiard for providing us with various yeast strains.

The interaction of cells with extracellular matrix proteins plays a critical role in a variety of biological processes. Recent studies show that cell-matrix interactions mediated by integrins can transduce biochemical signals to the cell interior and regulate cell behavior. In this paper we demonstrate that interactions of human glomerular epithelial cells with a nonenzymatically glycated matrix are altered with defective cell spreading, reduced phosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase and reduced activity of mitogen-activated protein kinase.

The glomerular epithelial cells together with the glomerular basement membrane participate in the formation of the permselective barrier in the kidney. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and expansion of the mesangium are among the characteristic changes seen in diabetic nephropathy, and they correlate with declining renal function in diabetic patients (1Mauer S.M.

One of the mechanisms by which elevated sugar levels compromise normal structure and function is by the phenomenon of nonenzymatic glycosylation with the formation of primary Amadori, intermediate and advanced glycosylation end products (3Brownlee M. Vlassara H. Cerami A. Ann. Intern.

Barcellos-Hoff M. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1987; 8: 327-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions of cells with matrix molecules are mediated largely by cell receptors of the integrin family (9Rouslahti E. J. Clin.

The integrins form clusters at sites of close cell-substrate contact termed focal contacts, and these serve to link the integrins to the cytoskeleton. However, focal contacts play more than a structural role; they serve as centers for the activation of several signal transduction pathways (12Kornberg L.J. Earp H.S. Turner C.E. Prockop C.

Tyrosine phosphorylation of important components of the focal adhesion complex such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK) 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; tIV, type IV collagen; tIV-C, control tIV; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HGEC, human glomerular epithelial cell; ANOVA, analysis of variance. 1The abbreviations used are: FAK, focal adhesion kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase; tIV, type IV collagen; tIV-C, control tIV; BSA, bovine serum albumin; HGEC, human glomerular epithelial cell; ANOVA, analysis of variance. and paxillin, occurs following integrin activation (15Schaller M.D. Parsons J.T.

Integrin engagement has also been linked to activation of MAPK (17Chen Q. Kinch M.S. Ling T.H. Burridge K. Juliano R.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26602-26605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 18Schlaepfer D.D. Hanks S.K. Hunter T. Geer P.V. Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1438) Google Scholar). AP-1 is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator, and its activity is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinases (19Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). Thus, one can see how integrin-mediated cell interactions with the extracellular matrix influence cell behavior and gene expression.In this work, we examine the possibility that interactions of cells with a diabetically modified matrix interfere with normal cell-matrix interactions and consequently result in changes in cell behavior. We have investigated the alterations seen when human glomerular epithelial cells interact with glycated matrix. This provides an insight into the role played by the human glomerular epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.DISCUSSIONThe mechanisms by which hyperglycemia results in altered cell behavior in vitro or in situ are multiple and complex. One of the mechanisms is nonenzymatic glycosylation, which is known to alter the structural and functional integrity of extracellular matrix. In the present report we provide evidence that these matrix modifications additionally affect cell-matrix interactions and behavior of human glomerular epithelial cells.As cells adhere and spread they form focal adhesions. Focal adhesions are sites of integrin clustering and activation of several signal transduction pathways (16Richardson A. Parsons J.T. Bioessays. 1995; 17: 229-235Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar). It has been proposed that they may integrate mechanical signals associated with changes in cell shape with chemical signals elicited directly by integrin binding and thereby modulate downstream signaling (35Ingber D.E. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 575-597Crossref PubMed Scopus (1311) Google Scholar). With increased cell spreading the total area of cell-extracellular matrix contact increases, hence focal adhesion formation, integrin binding, and therefore subsequent signaling events may vary in parallel. In addition it has been recently demonstrated that cell shape by itself is an important determinant of cell functions like survival and growth (36Chen C.S. Mrksich M. Huang S. Whitesides G.M. Ingber D.E. Science. 1997; 276: 1425-1428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4145) Google Scholar). Therefore alterations in cell spreading could both directly and indirectly affect normal cell responses.Defects in cell spreading have been noted on interaction of mesangial cells and endothelial cells with a glycated matrix (29Anderson S.S. Kim Y. Tsilibary E.C. Kidney Int. 1994; 46: 1359-1367Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 30Hasegawa G. Hunter A. Charonis A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3278-3283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) and changes in intracellular signaling have been observed under diabetic conditions in mesangial cells and endothelial cells (30Hasegawa G. Hunter A. Charonis A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3278-3283Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 37Cosio F.G. Wilmer W.A. Kidney Int. 1995; 48 ($$): 12-17Google Scholar). However, to the best of our knowledge there is no report of such studies in human glomerular epithelial cells in diabetic conditions, and changes in MAPK activation have not been investigated in these earlier reports.In diabetic nephropathy some of the changes occurring in the glomerulus are a thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and expansion of the mesangial matrix. The thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and the expansion of the mesangial matrix are due to an increased deposition of extracellular matrix macromolecules such as collagen, fibronectin, laminin, and proteoglycans (38Osterby R. Gunderson H.J.G. Diabetologia. 1980; 18: 493-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar, 39Abrass C.K. Peterson C.V. Raugi G.J.

Ishida M. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1996; 7 (Abstr. 3169): 1880Google Scholar). It has been seen that this could be due to an imbalance between matrix deposition and degradation. In streptozotocin-induced diabetes in rats, there is an up-regulation of expression of collagens, a down-regulation of the expression of collagenases, and an up-regulation of the expression of tissue inhibitors of collagenases (43Border W. Okuda S. Nakamura T. Semin. Nephrol. 1989; 9: 307-317PubMed Google Scholar).AP-1 is a sequence-specific transcriptional activator composed of members of the Jun and Fos families, and its activity is regulated by Mitogen activated protein kinases (19Karin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16483-16486Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2245) Google Scholar). In addition, it has been demonstrated that the AP-1 binding site regulates the transcription of the collagenase gene in response to integrin-mediated signals (44Tremble P. Damsky C.H. Werb Z. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 29: 1707-1720Crossref Scopus (115) Google Scholar). Therefore reduced MAPK activity could potentially cause alterations in the expression and secretion of matrix-degrading enzymes that we are currently investigating.Altered cell-matrix interactions followed by alterations in intracellular signaling could translate downstream into differential expression of matrix components, matrix degrading enzymes, and/or their inhibitors, growth factors, and cytokines that could lead to the changes occurring in a long-term diabetic patient. The glomerular epithelial cells together with the glomerular basement membrane participate in the formation of the permselective barrier in the kidney. Thickening of the glomerular basement membrane and expansion of the mesangium are among the characteristic changes seen in diabetic nephropathy, and they correlate with declining renal function in diabetic patients (1Mauer S.M. Steffes M.W. Ellis E.N. Sutherland D.E.R. Brown D.M. Goetz F.C. J. Clin. Invest. 1984; 74: 1143-1155Crossref PubMed Scopus (1058) Google Scholar). In diabetes, hyperglycemia affects many metabolic pathways and each of these changes has important consequences in the development of various pathologic manifestations. There is much documented evidence, including that from The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (2The Diabetes Control and Complications Trial Research Group N. Engl. J Med. 1993; 329: 977-979Crossref PubMed Scopus (22513) Google Scholar), that hyperglycemia and subsequent biochemical events correlate with the development of diabetic complications. One of the mechanisms by which elevated sugar levels compromise normal structure and function is by the phenomenon of nonenzymatic glycosylation with the formation of primary Amadori, intermediate and advanced glycosylation end products (3Brownlee M. Vlassara H. Cerami A. Ann. Intern. Med. 1984; 101: 527-550Crossref PubMed Scopus (906) Google Scholar) that alter the structure and function of basement membrane macromolecules in vitro and in vivo (4Tsilibary E.C. Charonis A.S.

The accumulation of these products correlates with the development of long-term complications in diabetes (7Monnier V.M. Vishwanath V. Frank K.E. Elmets C.A. Douchat P. Kohn R.R. N. Engl. J. Med. 1986; 314: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (533) Google Scholar). It is well accepted that extracellular matrices, especially basement membranes, are involved in a dynamic and reciprocal relationship with cells and to a large extent determine cellular phenotype, function, and gene expression (8Bisell M.J. Barcellos-Hoff M. J. Cell Sci. (Suppl.). 1987; 8: 327-335Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These interactions of cells with matrix molecules are mediated largely by cell receptors of the integrin family (9Rouslahti E. J. Clin. Invest. 1991; 87: 1-5Crossref PubMed Scopus (1478) Google Scholar, 10Hynes R. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (8966) Google Scholar, 11Humphries M.J. Mould A.P. Tuckwell D.S. Bioessays. 1993; 15: 391-397Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The integrins form clusters at sites of close cell-substrate contact termed focal contacts, and these serve to link the integrins to the cytoskeleton. However, focal contacts play more than a structural role; they serve as centers for the activation of several signal transduction pathways (12Kornberg L.J. Earp H.S. Turner C.E. Prockop C.

Solid-phase binding assays using 96-well microtiter plates were designed to quantitate the relative binding affinities. It was found that not only the IGFBP-3 derivatives with the amino-terminal, cysteine-rich domain (N domain) but also the synthetic peptide maintained affinity for IGF-II. Ternary complex formation was observed with full-length IGFBP-3 and chimera IGFBP, the carboxyl-terminal cysteine-rich domain (C domain) of which was derived from IGFBP-3, unlike the mutants lacking the C domain and the chimera IGFBPs, the C domain of which was derived from IGFBP-2. These results were confirmed by affinity cross-linking experiments. Furthermore, the IGFBP-3 derivatives that possessed the C domain of IGFBP-3 bound to the acid-labile subunit, even in the absence of IGFs. Finally, we observed sites in IGF-II important for the ternary complex formation using various IGF-II mutants. These IGF-II mutants, which contained a substitution of Tyr27 for Leu, had extremely reduced activity. These results strongly suggest that: 1) the N domain, containing at least Glu52-Ala92, of rat IGFBP-3 is important for binding to IGF-II; 2) the C domain of IGFBP-3 is essential for binding to the acid-labile subunit both in the presence and absence of IGF-II; and 3) Tyr27 of IGF-II is important for the ternary complex formation.

A. 1995; 92: 4472-4476Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and IGFBP-7 binds IGFs with specificity (9Oh Y. Nagalla S.R. Yamanaka Y. Kim H.-S. Wilson E. Rosenfeld R.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 30322-30325Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Although IGFBP-7 contains a total of 18 cysteines, consistent with the IGFBP-1 to IGFBP-5 molecules, the carboxyl-terminal domain contains only one homologous cysteine position. When IGFs are bound to IGFBP-3, an acid-labile subunit (ALS) can bind to the IGF/IGFBP-3 complex to form an IGF/IGFBP-3/ALS 150-kDa ternary complex (10Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6898-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar, 11Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A recent study also identified a binary complex of IGFBP-3/ALS in rat serum (12Lee C.Y. Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 668-678Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 13Lee C.Y. Rechler M.M. Endocrinology. 1995; 136: 4982-4989Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Through binding analyses using various IGFs mutants, it was reported that Glu6, Phe26, Phe48, Arg49, and Ser50 of human IGF-II were important for binding to IGFBPs (14Lüthi C. Roth B.V. Humbel R.E. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 483-490Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 15Francis G.L. Aplin S.E. Milner S.J. McNeil K.A. Ballard F.J. Wallace J.C. Biochem.

Chem. 1993; 268: 9246-9254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). There is also information about binding regions of IGFBPs to IGFs derived from fragments of IGFBPs that exist in human and rat serum (6Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). For example, amino-terminal 30-kDa fragments of IGFBP-3 obtained from human (17Zapf J. Kiefer M. Merryweather J. Musiarz F. Bauer D. Born W. Fischer J.A. Froesch E.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 14892-14898Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and rat (18Zapf J. Born W. Chang J.-Y. James P. Froesch E.R. Fischer J.A. Biochem.

Commun. 1989; 165: 189-195Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) serum were able to bind IGFs. Furthermore, an amino-terminal 15-kDa fragment derived from human plasma IGFBP-3 was detected by ligand blotting using125I-labeled IGF-I (20Sommer A. Maack C.A. Spratt S.K. Mascarenhas D. Tressel T.J. Rhodes E.T. Lee R. Roumas M. Tatsuno G.P. Flynn J.A. Gerber N. Taylor J. Cudny H. Nanney L. Hunt T.K. Spencer E.M. Spencer E.M. Modern Concepts of Insulin-like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., NY1991: 715-728Google Scholar). These natural fragments corresponding to the amino-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 were isolated without disulfide reduction, suggesting that these domains are not linked by disulfide bonds (6Rechler M.M. Vitam. Horm. 1993; 47: 1-114Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). In the case of the IGFs/IGFBP-3/ALS ternary complex formation, Tyr24 and the D-domain (residues 63–70) of human IGF-I are thought to be important (21Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the properties of IGFBP-3 and ALS for ternary complex formation are not understood well. We previously characterized IGFs binding to their receptors and biological activities of IGFs using various recombinant IGF-II mutants (22Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y.

Nagata K. Higashihashi N. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, we describe new solid-phase binding assays that can be performed easily using 96-well microtiter plates. Using these assays, we evaluated the binding properties of various mutants, chimeras, and a synthetic peptide derived from rat IGFBP-3 to analyze IGFs/IGFBP-3 and IGFs/IGFBP-3/ALS structure-function relationships. A rat pancreas cDNA (λgt 11) library of adult Sprague-Dawley females was purchased fromCLONTECH Laboratories, Inc. (Palo Alto, CA). The prokaryotic expression vector pTrc99A, pGEX-2T, DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B resin, SP-Sepharose F.F. resin, and NHS-activated HiTrap affinity column were from Pharmacia Biotech, Inc. (Uppsala, Sweden). Protein A affinity resin (PROSEP-A) was from Bioprocessing, Ltd. (Durham, United Kingdom) and DEAE-5PW 75 × 7.5 mm inside diameter was from Tosoh (Tokyo, Japan). A YMC-Pack Protein-RP column (250 × 4.6 mm inside diameter) was from YMC Co., Ltd. (Kyoto, Japan). A maleimide-activated horseradish peroxidase kit and disuccinimidyl suberate were purchased from Pierce. 2,2′-Azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) peroxidase substrate and microtiter plates (96-well) were obtained from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories (Gaithersburg, MD) and Costar (Cambridge, MA), respectively. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG (anti-rabbit IgG-HRP), a biotinylation kit, and125I-labeled human recombinant IGF-II (2000 Ci/mmol) were obtained from Amersham Corp. All other chemicals were of the highest quality commercially available. Recombinant human IGF-II and IGF-II mutants of [Leu27]rIGF-II, [Leu43]rIGF-II, and [Arg54, Arg55]rIGF-II were expressed inEscherichia coli MC1061 using constructs and purification procedures as described previously (22Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A double mutant of [Leu27, Leu43]rIGF-II was constructed by identical procedures using synthetic oligonucleotides. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by an Applied Biosystems model 380A synthesizer, purified as described previously (24Marumoto Y. Sato Y. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Saeki Y. Agata M. Furusawa M. Maeda S. J. Gen. Virol. 1987; 68: 2599-2606Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar), and sequences were confirmed by the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (25Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52653) Google Scholar) using a 7-DEAZA sequencing kit (Takara Shuzo, Kyoto, Japan). Cloning of IGFBP-3 and IGFBP-2 cDNA was performed by polymerase chain reaction with reference to known cDNA sequences (26Shimasaki S. Koba A. Mercado M. Shimonaka M. Ling N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1989; 165: 907-912Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar, 27Brown A.L. Chiariotti L. Orlowski C.C. Mehlman T. Burgess W.H. Ackerman E.J. Bruni C.B. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 5148-5154Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using rat pancreas cDNA library (λgt 11) as a template. Considering the significant homology among all rat IGFBPs, IGFBP-3 contained the three major domains: an amino-terminal (Gly1-Cys89) and carboxyl-terminal domain (Cys187-Gln265), rich in cysteine residues; and an linkage-domain (Ala90-Pro186) with no significant homology. IGFBP-3 mutants designated N+L domain (Gly1-Pro186) and N domain (Gly1-Ser93) were constructed by polymerase chain reaction methods using the rat IGFBP-3 cDNA as a template. A chimera protein whose N, L, and C domain were derived from IGFBP-3, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-2, respectively, was named as chimera-322. In this way, chimera proteins designated chimera-322, chimera-323, and chimera-332 were constructed by mixing polymerase chain reaction-derived fragments from the N, L, and C domains using appropriate rat IGFBP-3 and rat IGFBP-2 cDNA clones as templates. All IGFBP-3 derivatives are illustrated in Fig.1. For the expression of IGFBP-3, N+L domain, chimera-322, chimera-323, and chimera-332 in E. coli, the phosphatase A (PhoA) signal sequence was chemically synthesized and introduced into theNcoI-HindIII site of pTrc99A, upstream of these clones, which were devoid of their own signal sequences. These expression vectors were transformed into E. coli UT5600. The cells were grown at 37 °C in an LB medium supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. After isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside induction (final concentration, 0.3 mm), the cells were cultured an additional 1 h and then collected by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 20 min. The periplasm prepared by osmotic shock (28Nossal N.G. Heppel L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1966; 241: 3055-3062Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) from the cells was adjusted to pH 7.2 with phosphate-buffered saline and applied to an IGF-II coupled affinity resin column prepared from an NHS-activated HiTrap affinity column according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Each IGFBP-3 derivative was eluted with 0.5m acetic acid and lyophilized, dissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid, and then further purified by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (YMC-Pack Protein-RP 250 × 10 mm inside dimater) with a linear gradient from 25 to 55% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. The mutant constructed of only the IGFBP-3 N domain was expressed inE. coli BL-21 as a fusion protein with glutathioneS-transferase. The fusion protein, into which a cyanogen bromide-cleavable methionine was introduced, was constructed using expression vector pGEX-2T. The fusion protein was purified from cell lysate on a glutathione Sepharose-4B affinity resin using a batchwise method according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pharmacia Biotech). The fraction, eluted with 25 mm reduced glutathione, was dialyzed against water and lyophilized. The N domain was released from the glutathione S-transferase fusion protein by treatment with cyanogen bromide in 70% (v/v) formic acid and lyophilized. The obtained N domain was refolded as described previously (29Marumoto Y. Teruuchi T. Enjoh T. Numata F. Sakano K. Biosci. Biotech. Biochem. 1992; 56: 13-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (3) Google Scholar) and further purified using the IGF-II coupled affinity column and reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography as described above. Two of the six disulfide bond pairs included in the N domain of IGFBP-3 were determined by peptide mapping procedures that involved trypsin digestion, reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography, and amino-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of isolated peptide fragments (data not shown). By referring to the identified disulfide bonds of Cys56-Cys69 and Cys63-Cys89, a 41-residue peptide derived from positions Glu52-Ala92 was synthesized by an Applied Biosystems model 431A peptide synthesizer using the selective S-S formation procedures (30Nakagawa S.H. Tager H.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 11502-11509Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Eighty ml of rat serum were dialyzed against 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.2, and chromatographed on a DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column and an IGF-II/IGFBP-3 complex affinity column essentially as described previously with some modifications (11Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Beniac V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 11843-11848Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 31Baxter R.C. Dai J. Endocrinology. 1994; 134: 848-852Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For this study, IGF-II was conjugated to an NHS-activated HiTrap affinity column, and recombinant IGFBP-3 was used instead of serum-derived IGFBP-3. Finally, the ALS was purified on a DEAE-5PW column (75 × 7.5 mm inside dimater) using a linear gradient from 0.1 to 0.5 m NaCl in 10 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0. Fractions containing ALS were collected and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, by ultrafiltration. The purity of each purified IGFBP-3, N+L domain, N domain, chimera-322, chimera-323, chimera-332, the 41-residue peptide, and ALS was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the Laemmli buffer system (32Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207165) Google Scholar) under reducing conditions followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. All of the protein concentrations were determined using an AccQ-Tag amino acid composition analysis column according to the manufacturer's instructions (Waters, Milford, MA). Amino acid sequences of all purified proteins were also confirmed by sequencing using an Applied Biosystems 476A gas phase sequencer. HRP-IGF-II was prepared using a maleimide-activated HRP kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Pierce). Briefly, IGF-II was reacted withN-succinimidyl-S-acetylthioacetate to introduce a free sulfhydryl into the primary amines and was then conjugated with maleimide-activated HRP. ALS was biotinylated on primary amines using a biotinylation kit according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Amersham Co.). Five injections (0.4 mg each) of IGFBP-3 or the 41-residue peptide were administered s.c. to five male rabbits at 2-week intervals. Each polyclonal antibody (anti-BP-3 pAb and anti-Pep pAb, respectively) was purified from the antisera using a PROSEP-A affinity column according to the manufacturer's recommendations and dialyzed against 50 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. All solid-phase binding assays described were carried out with 96-well microtiter plates using binding components as illustrated in Fig. 2. For all assays, the plates were coated with proteins in 50 mmsodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and blocked with the same buffer containing 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin. All washes were done with the same phosphate buffer containing 0.03% (v/v) Tween 20. Binding proteins were diluted in the phosphate buffer containing 0.25% bovine serum albumin and 0.03% (v/v) Tween 20. After coating, all steps were performed at room temperature. For the HRP-IGF-II/IGFBP-3 competitive binding assay (Fig.2 A), 50 μl of 150 ng/ml IGFBP-3 were immobilized at 4 °C overnight. The wells were washed and blocked for 2 h at room temperature. The wells were washed, and 25 μl of a 1:6000 dilution of HRP-IGF-II and 25 μl of each competitor were added simultaneously to each well. The plates were incubated for 2 h and washed, and 100 μl of 2,2′-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) substrate (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories) were added. After 20 min, the absorbance of the reaction product at 405 nm was read using aV max microplate reader (Molecular Devices, Menlo Park, CA). To study complex formation with ALS, indirect immobilization procedures using biotinylated ALS were performed. Wells were precoated with 50 μl of 1 μg/ml streptavidin, and unbound sites were blocked. After washing, 50 μl of 200 or 50 ng/ml biotinylated ALS were added and incubated for 2 h to immobilize ALS indirectly. To observe the relative affinities of the IGFBP-3 derivatives to form ternary complexes (Fig. 2 B; the HRP-IGF-II/IGFBP-3/ALS solid-phase binding assay), 50 μl of 200 ng/ml biotinylated ALS were used. After indirect immobilization of ALS, 25 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of HRP-IGF-II and 25 μl of various concentrations of IGFBP-3 derivatives were incubated for 2 h to form the ternary complex. The quantity of the formed complex in the well was measured as described above. To detect the binding of IGFBP-3 derivatives to ALS in the absence of IGFs (Fig. 2 C; the IGFBP-3/ALS solid-phase binding assay), various concentrations of IGFBP-3 derivatives were incubated with the immobilized biotinylated ALS. After washing the wells, the quantity of the formed complex was detected by incubation with 50 μl of 3 μg/ml anti-BP-3 pAb for 2 h, followed by washing and 50 μl of a 1:1000 dilution of anti-rabbit IgG-HRP for 2 h. To observe the ability of the IGF-II mutants to form the ternary complexes (Fig. 2 D; the IGFs/IGFBP-3/ALS solid-phase binding assay), 50 μl of 50 ng/ml biotinylated ALS were immobilized indirectly to avoid detection of the IGFBP-3/ALS complex in the absence of IGFs. After indirect immobilization of ALS, 25 μl of various concentrations of IGF-II mutants and 25 μl of 50 ng/ml IGFBP-3 were incubated for 2 h. The formed ternary complexes were detected using the anti-BP-3 pAb and anti-rabbit IgG-HRP system as described above. Each IGFBP-3 mutant or the 41-residue peptide was incubated at 4 °C overnight in 270 μl of 25 mm sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, containing 0.05% Tween 20, 0.1% sodium azide, and 60,000 cpm of125I-labeled IGF-II in the absence (for the binary complex) or in the presence (for the ternary complex) of 0.6 μg of ALS. Following an overnight incubation, 30 μl of 1.5 mmdisuccinimidyl suberate were added, and the reaction mixture was further incubated on ice for 15 min. The cross-linking reaction was terminated by adding 60 μl of 1 m Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.5. Proteins were precipitated by trichloroacetic acid at a final concentration of 20% and applied to a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gel under reducing conditions, followed by autoradiography. IGFBP-3, two kinds of deletion mutants, three kinds of chimera IGFBPs, the 41-residue peptide, and rat serum ALS were prepared as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and their purity was confirmed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (data not shown) and by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 3). The chimera IGFBPs were expressed using the same expression vector as the IGFBP-3, but all chimera IGFBPs showed doublet bands. The doublet bands were also detected by Western blotting using anti-BP-3 pAb and by far Western ligand blotting using HRP-IGF-II (data not shown). From the results of amino-terminal amino acid sequence analyses, it was found that all chimera IGFBPs contained the expected amino-terminal sequence of Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Val-Gly-Ala as the primary sequence and an unexpected minor Gly-Ala-Val-Gly-Ala sequence. The minor sequence is probably due to different processing of the PhoA signal sequence, resulting in the doublet bands. Recombinant rat IGFBP-3 expressed inE. coli did not show such doublet bands nor the minor sequence, however, it is possible that IGFBP-3 may have contained the minor sequence at undetectable levels. Using the HRP-IGF-II/IGFBP-3 solid-phase competitive binding assay, the relative affinities of five IGFBP-3 mutants and the 41-residue peptide to IGF-II were calculated from their displacement curves (Fig.4) and compared with that of IGFBP-3, which was set to 100% (Table I). The chimera IGFBPs retained over 40% of the relative affinity, but the isolated N+L domain or N domain showed much lower affinity. A three-fold difference in affinity was observed between N+L domain and N domain. In the case of the 41-residue peptide, although it showed only 0.008% affinity relative to IGFBP-3, an anti-Pep pAb inhibited HRP-IGF-II binding to immobilized IGFBP-3. To verify the IGFBP-3 mutants and the 41-residue peptide binding to IGF-II, affinity cross-linking procedure was performed using 125I-labeled IGF-II. The IGFBP-3, N+L domain, N domain, and the 41-residue peptide all showed bands consistent with cross-linking specifically to125I-labeled IGF-II (Fig. 5). The negative control using only ALS did not form a complex band. These results are consistent with the conclusion that the N domain of IGFBP-3, and at least a portion of the 41-residue peptide (position Glu52-Ala92), is important for binding to IGF-II.Table IRelative binding affinities of IGFBP-3 derivatives and 41-residue peptide for IGF-IIIGFBP-3 derivativesRelative affinity1-aRelative affinities were determined from the competitive binding inhibition data shown in Fig. 4.

In this assay, indirect immobilization of ALS was adopted because direct immobilization of ALS or biotinylated ALS did not give a measurable absorbance using 25 ng/ml of IGFBP-3 (data not shown). IGFBP-3 showed concentration-dependent ternary complex formation between 0.1 and 10 nm, the same range as the competitive binding assay shown in Fig. 4. However, neither the N+L domain, N domain, nor the 41-residue peptide, which all had low affinity for IGF-II, were observed to form ternary complexes (Fig.6 A). Of the chimeras, only chimera-323 showed ternary complex formation (Fig. 6 B). The activities of the chimera IGFBPs for the ternary complex formation were also examined by affinity cross-linking experiments using125I-labeled IGF-II and ALS (Fig.7). The bands derived from the binary complex with 125I-labeled IGF-II were detected with IGFBP-3 and all chimera IGFBPs, whereas bands derived from the ternary complex were detected only with IGFBP-3 and chimera-323. Because chimera-332, which contains only the C domain from IGFBP-2, did not show activity, this suggests that the L domain is not involved for ternary complex formation.Figure 7Characterization of chimera IGFBPs activities in ternary complex formation by affinity cross-linking.Radioactive complexes formed by cross-linking 60,000 cpm of125I-labeled IGF-II and lanes 1 and2, IGFBP-3 (1.5 ng); lanes 3 and 4,chimera-322 (1.5 ng); lanes 5 and 6, chimera-323 (1.5 ng); lanes 7 and 8, chimera-332 (1.5 ng) with (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8) or without (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) ALS (0.6 μg).

Various concentrations of IGFBP-3 were added to the wells, and the IGFBP-3/ALS binary complex formed was detected by anti-BP-3 pAb followed by anti-rabbit IgG-HRP. Preliminary experiments confirmed that the anti-BP-3 pAb could bind to all chimera IGFBPs equally by Western blot analysis (data not shown). As shown in Fig.8, IGFBP-3 and chimera-323 bound to ALS in a concentration-dependent manner. The other chimera IGFBPs (chimera-322 and chimera-332) had essentially no binding to ALS. These results strongly suggested that the C domain of IGFBP-3 plays an important role for the binding of IGFBP-3 to ALS in the presence and absence of IGFs. The relative affinities of four IGF-II mutants to IGFBP-3 were determined by the HRP-IGF-II/IGFBP-3 solid-phase competitive binding assay from their displacement curves shown in Fig.9 A and compared with that of IGF-II, which was set to 100%. The affinities of [Leu27]rIGF-II, [Leu43]rIGF-II, [Arg54, Arg55]rIGF-II, and [Leu27, Leu43]rIGF-II for IGFBP-3 were 100, 108, 25, and 100%, respectively, relative to IGF-II. The values from the first three mutants are similar to those reported previously,i.e., 70, 100, and 37%, respectively (16Bach L.A. Hsieh S. Sakano K. Fujiwara H. Perdue J.F. Rechler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9246-9254Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The ability to form ternary complexes with these IGF-II mutants were examined with the IGFs/IGFBP-3/ALS solid-phase binding assay (Fig. 9 B). The [Leu43]rIGF-II and [Arg54, Arg55]rIGF-II showed almost the same activities relative to IGF-II. However, the two mutants with substitution of Tyr27 to Leu showed markedly less ternary complex formation, suggesting that Tyr27 of IGF-II contributes to the binding energy in the ternary complex. To ensure optimal folding of the recombinant IGFBP-3 and the mutant, the expression system with PhoA signal sequence was used with the exception of the N domain molecule. All of the expressed proteins were purified by IGF-II coupled affinity column chromatography, a binding property that requires correct folding and permitted comparison of relative affinities. The IGFBP-3 derivatives used in this study were highly purified except for chimera IGFBPs. Each chimera IGFBP contained a mature form and a minor percentage with two amino acids deleted from the amino terminus. Although the reason is unclear, it is possible that the Ala2 of each chimera IGFBP was recognized as an alternative processing site because the PhoA signal sequence is processed after Ala. On the other hand, IGFBP-3 and the N+L domain were also expressed with the same PhoA signal sequence, and they showed only Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Val-Gly-Ala sequence. We cannot rule out the possibility that IGFBP-3 and the N+L domain may also be processed at the secondary site, albeit at undetectable levels. From the HRP-IGF-II/IGFBP-3 solid-phase binding assay and affinity cross-linking experiments, the deletion mutants of IGFBP-3, the N+L domain, and the N domain showed 12.5 and 4.2% affinities for IGF-II, respectively, relative to full-length IGFBP-3. Previous studies showed that a 30-kDa IGFBP-3 in pregnancy plasma has 20-fold lower affinity for IGF-I than normal plasma IGFBP-3 (33Binoux M. Hossenlopp P. Lassarre C. Segovia B. Spencer E.M. Modern Concepts of Insulin-like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., NY1991: 329-336Google Scholar), and a carboxyl-terminal truncated 31-kDa IGFBP-3 from rat serum also has lower affinity for IGF-I (34Schmid C. Rutishauser J. Schläpfer I. Froesch E.R. Zapf J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 179: 579-585Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The truncated IGFBP-3 resulted from proteolysis by IGFBP-3 proteases and reduced its affinity for IGFs, thereby facilitating dissociation of the complexes and hence increasing the bioavailability of the IGFs (33Binoux M. Hossenlopp P. Lassarre C. Segovia B. Spencer E.M. Modern Concepts of Insulin-like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., NY1991: 329-336Google Scholar). Results obtained from the binding of IGFBP-3 deletion mutants to IGF-II are in good agreement with that of proteolyzed and truncated form of IGFBP-3. Furthermore, we found that the 41-residue peptide (position Glu52-Ala92) could bind to IGF-II. In a previous study, the amino-terminal 88 amino acids of human IGFBP-3 showed low affinity for IGF-I (20Sommer A. Maack C.A. Spratt S.K. Mascarenhas D. Tressel T.J. Rhodes E.T. Lee R. Roumas M. Tatsuno G.P. Flynn J.A. Gerber N. Taylor J. Cudny H. Nanney L. Hunt T.K. Spencer E.M. Spencer E.M. Modern Concepts of Insulin-like Growth Factors. Elsevier Science Publishing Co., NY1991: 715-728Google Scholar). The 41-residue peptide is the smallest fragment of the IGFBP-3 derivatives found to bind to IGFs. This peptide was designed to obtain two S-S bonds, which were identified by peptide mapping procedures. The remaining four S-S bonds in the N domain could not be determined because of the cysteine-rich region at positions Cys42-Gly-Cys44-Cys45-Leu-Thr-Cys48. Therefore, we prepared one peptide that contained the S-S bonds. Although the 41-residue peptide showed 1/500th of the affinity for IGF-II relative to the N domain, the 41-residue peptide whose disulfide bonds were reduced and alkylated did not show any binding affinity (data not shown). Thus, the structure maintained by the S-S bonds are thought to be important for the binding affinity. However, compared to the relative affinities of chimera-332 (100%) and the N+L domain (12.5%) for IGF-II, the presence of only the N domain is important but not sufficient for full binding. For example, the L and C domains possibly play important roles for conformational stabilization of the N domain. For ternary complex formation, it was found that only the chimera IGFBP, which possessed the C domain derived from IGFBP-3 (chimera-323), showed ternary complex formation activity in the HRP-IGF-II/IGFBP-3/ALS solid-phase binding assay. Thus, the mutants lacking the C domains, such as the N+L domain, the N domain, and the 41-residue peptide, were not active in the affinity cross-linking experiment, and it was found that the bands derived from the ternary complex were observed using only IGFBP-3 and chimera-323. Although complexes between125I-labeled IGF-II and ALS were not observed (Fig. 5,lane 5), bands derived from the binary complex of125I-labeled IGF-II and ALS were detected in the presence of IGFBP-3 or chimera-323 as shown in Fig. 7. A previous study also showed that such a complex was detected by affinity cross-linking in the presence of IGFBP-3 (10Baxter R.C. Martin J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 6898-6902Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). It is speculated that IGF-II does not have a significant binding affinity for ALS but may be positioned near ALS in the ternary complex such that the cross-linker can link IGF-II and ALS in the presence of IGFBP-3. From the observation that IGFBP-3 and chimera-323 can form the ternary complex but that the N+L domain and chimera-332 cannot, it is likely that the C domain of IGFBP-3 is necessary for binding to ALS. The results of the IGFBP-3/ALS solid-phase binding assay also suggest that the C domain of IGFBP-3 is important for binding to ALS, even in the absence of IGF-II. In this study, we did not perform an affinity cross-linking experiment to observe chimera IGFBPs binding to ALS. To clarify the binding of IGFBP-3 to ALS, only the C domain expressed in E. colishould be used in the solid-phase binding assay and affinity cross-linking experiments. Previously, we confirmed the three-dimensional structure of recombinant IGF-II (4Terasawa H. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Nagata K. Higashihashi N. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) and identified the binding sites of IGF-II for their receptors (22Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y.

We also observed IGF-II sites important for the ternary complex formation using IGF-II mutants. Previous studies revealed that Tyr27of IGF-II is important for binding to insulin and IGF-I receptors (22Sakano K. Enjoh T. Numata F. Fujiwara H. Marumoto Y. Higashihashi N. Sato Y. Perdue J.F. Fujita-Yamaguchi Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20626-20635Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and not for binding to the IGF-II/cation-independent mannose 6-phosphate receptor, and that the Tyr27 residue is structurally positioned at the opposite side from a binding region for IGFBPs, which include Glu6, Phe48, Arg49, and Ser50 (4Terasawa H. Kohda D. Hatanaka H. Nagata K. Higashihashi N. Fujiwara H. Sakano K. Inagaki F. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 5590-5597Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). In this study, the results of the IGFs/IGFBP-3/ALS solid-phase binding assay suggest that mutation of Tyr27 to Leu does not support ternary complex formation. Similar results have been obtained by other groups using IGF-I mutants in which Tyr24 substituted with Leu ([Leu24]rIGF-I) reduced the ternary complex formation activity (21Baxter R.C. Bayne M.L. Cascieri M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 60-65Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tyr24 of IGF-I is also important for binding to insulin and IGF-I receptors (35Cascieri M.A. Bayne M.L. LeRoith D. Raizada M.K. Molecular and Cellular Biology of Insulin-like Growth Factors and Their Receptors. Plenum Publishing Corp., NY1989: 285-297Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, the Tyr27 residue of IGF-II, which is important for binding to insulin and IGF-I receptors, interacts only weakly with ALS and is on a side opposite to the Glu6, Phe48, Arg49, and Ser50 residues, which bind the amino-terminal domain of IGFBP-3, within positions Glu52-Ala92. Additionally, the carboxyl-terminal domain of IGFBP-3 binds to ALS, even in the absence of IGF-II. We thank Drs. M. Furusawa, J. F. Perdue, and Y. Fujita-Yamaguchi for valuable advice, discussions, and continuous encouragement. We also thank Y. Nagano, M. Nishimura, and K. Sato for excellent technical assistance."
https://openalex.org/W1988470572,"Species-specific cell recognition in sponges, the oldest living metazoans, is based on a proteoglycan-like aggregation factor. We have screened individual sponge cDNA libraries, identifying multiple related forms for the aggregation factor core protein (MAFp3). Northern blots show the presence in several human tissues of transcripts strongly binding a MAFp3-specific probe. The open reading frame for MAFp3 is not interrupted in the 5′ direction, revealing variable protein sequences that contain numerous introns equally spaced. We have studied tissue histocompatibility within a sponge population, finding 100% correlation between rejection behavior and the individual-specific restriction fragment length polymorphism pattern using aggregation factor-related probes. PCR amplifications with specific primers showed that at least some of the MAFp3 forms are allelic and distribute in the population used. A pronounced polymorphism is also observed when analyzing purified aggregation factor in polyacrylamide gels. Protease digestion of the polymorphic glycosaminoglycan-containing bands indicates that glycans are also responsible for the variability. The data presented reveal a high polymorphism of aggregation factor components, which matches the elevated sponge alloincompatibility, suggesting an involvement of the cell adhesion system in sponge allogeneic reactions."
https://openalex.org/W1985897977,"Colon carcinomas commonly contain mutations in Ki-ras4B, but very rarely in Ha-ras, suggesting that different Ras isoforms may have distinct functions in colon epithelial cell biology. In an earlier study we had demonstrated that oncogenic Ki-ras4BVal-12, but not oncogenic Ha-ras Val-12, blocks the apicobasal polarization of colon epithelial cells by preventing normal glycosylation of the integrin β1 chain of the collagen receptor. As a result, only the Ki-ras mutated cells exhibited altered cell to substratum attachment, whereas mutation of either Ras isoform activated mitogen-activated protein kinases. We have now asked whether intercellular adhesion proteins implicated in establishing basolateral polarity in colon epithelial cells are modulated by oncogenic Ki-Ras4BVal-12 proteins but not oncogenic Ha-RasVal-12 proteins. The embryonic adhesion protein carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was up-regulated on the mRNA and protein levels in each of three stable Ki-ras Val-12 transfectant lines but in none of three stable Ha-ras Val-12 transfectant lines. The elevated protein levels of CEA in Ki-ras4BVal-12 transfectant cells were decreased by blocking expression of Ki-ras4BVal-12 with antisense oligonucleotides. N-cadherin levels were decreased in only the Ki-rastransfectants, whereas E-cadherin levels were unchanged. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated that Ki-ras4BVal-12 transfectant cells did not polarize into cells with discrete apical and basal regions and so could not restrict expression of CEA to the apical region. These unpolarized cells displayed elevated levels of CEA all along their surface membrane where CEA mediated random, multilayered associations of tumor cells. This aggregation was both calcium-independent and blocked by Fab′ fragments of anti-CEA monoclonal antibody col-1. Trafficking of the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B may also be altered when cell polarity cannot be established. Ki-ras4BVal-12transfectant cells expressed 2-fold elevated protein levels of the lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B but did not up-regulate cathepsin B mRNA expression. One function of oncogenic c-Ki-Ras proteins in colon cancer progression may be to up-regulate CEA and thus to prevent the lateral adhesion of adjacent colon epithelial cells that normally form a monolayer in vivo.

Studies in tissue culture have shown that cellular polarization may require both E-cadherin-mediated cell-to-cell contact and integrin-mediated cell-substratum interactions (1Eaton S. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 82: 5-8Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). E-cadherin is critical to the formation of the basolateral domain, whereas the orientation of the apicobasal axis depends on integrin-mediated associations with the substratum. Orientation of the apical-basal axis in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells is known to depend on integrin-mediated interactions with the growth surface. When grown in suspension, Madin-Darby canine kidney cells aggregate to form cysts with the apical domain facing outward. These cysts reverse their polarity when collagen is added to the culture medium causing apical markers to disappear from the external domain and reappear on the luminal face (2Wang A. Ojakian G. Nelson W. J. Cell Sci. 1990; 95: 153-156PubMed Google Scholar). Collagen interaction with integrins on the basal surface of cells is believed to orient the apical-basal axis, since addition of blocking antibody to β1 integrin prevents this polarity reversal (3Ojakian G. Schwimmer R. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 561-576PubMed Google Scholar). HD6-4 colon carcinoma cells provide a unique model to study the effects of oncogenes on cellular polarization. HD6-4 cells polarize apicobasally by up-regulating their α2β1 integrin collagen receptors (4Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar) and basolaterally by up-regulating membrane levels of E-cadherin 35-fold and membrane levels of the desmosomal protein desmoglein I 16-fold (5Yan Z. Robinson-Saddler A. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). HD6-4 cells then differentiate into a specialized epithelial cell, the mucin granule producing colon goblet (5Yan Z. Robinson-Saddler A. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). This cell polarization can occur although HD6-4 cells contain inactivating mutations in the tumor suppressor genes p53 and APC. HD6-4 cells, however, have wild-type ras genes (6Huang F. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 3701-3706PubMed Google Scholar). Most colon cancer cells are rounded and unpolarized. As roughly 50% of colon cancers cases exhibit activating mutations in ras genes, mutations in ras may be one mechanism for loss of cell polarization. The vast majority of ras mutations in colon cancers are in Ki-ras, with only a few percent in N-ras and very uncommonly in Ha-ras (7Bos J. Fearon E. Hamilton S. Verlann-de Vries M. van Boom J. van der Eb A. Vogelstein B. Nature. 1987; 327: 293-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (1602) Google Scholar, 8Forrester K. Almoguera C. Han K. Grizzle W.E. Perucho M. Nature. 1987; 327: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The selection of Ki-ras mutations in the genesis of colon cancers suggested that mutations in this ras isoform might block colon epithelial cell apicobasal or basolateral polarization. We have presented evidence in a recent study1that only mutations in the Ki-ras gene, not the Ha-ras gene, disrupt colon epithelial cell apicobasal polarity through a specific effect on β1 integrin maturation. We made stable transfectants of HD6-4 cells using minigene constructs of the huge cellular Ki-ras gene, both wild-type and constructs activated by mutation at valine 12. We compared these transfectants with those made using Ha-ras mutated at valine 12. The mutated Ha-ras and Ki-ras genes were expressed on the protein level and each activated the mitogen-activated protein kinases erk1 and erk2, which were correlated with increased cell proliferation. However, only the mutated Ki-ras gene blocked normal glycosylation of β1 integrin, leading to accumulation of an aberrant β1 integrin. The aberrant β1 integrin was transported to the cell surface where it mediated a looser attachment to collagen I. Antisense oligonucleotides to Ki-ras restored normal glycosyltransferase activity to the Ki-ras transfectants that regained the capacity to make mature β1 integrin.1These studies demonstrated that the blocked glycosylation of β1 integrin was the direct result of the functioning of the oncogenic Ki-ras gene not some nonspecific effect of transfection. HD6-4 colon epithelial cells bind to collagen I as a first step in polarization, followed by differentiation to mucin-producing goblet cells (4Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). Imperfect binding to this substratum could prevent normal apicobasal polarization. Selection of colon adenoma cells with oncogenic Ki-rasmutations is seen during the growth of benign tumors (10Shibata D. Schaeffer J. Li Z.-H. Capella G. Perucho M. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1993; 85: 1058-1063Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), and this selection is maintained in the transition to malignancy and during further progression of the cancer cells to highly invasive and metastatic states (11Finkelstein S. Sayegh R. Bakker A. Swalsky P. Arch Surg. 1993; 128: 526-532Crossref PubMed Scopus (103) Google Scholar, 12Suchy B. Zietz C. Rabes H. Int. J. Cancer. 1992; 52: 30-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Tumor cells freed from tight cell-to-cell and cell-to-substratum adherence because of the synthesis of aberrant β1 integrin could have a selective advantage in both growth and invasion and become the dominant cell type within a tumor. In the current study, we have asked whether the oncogenic Ki-ras4BVal-12 gene can disrupt colon epithelial cell polarity in a second way by targeting intercellular adhesion proteins and whether any such effect is restricted to the Ki-ras gene and is not mediated by oncogenic Ha-ras Val-12.

The HD6 human colon carcinoma cell line was subcloned from the HT29 cell line and recloned as the HD6-4 line immediately before transfection. The parental and transfectant lines were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 7% fetal bovine serum or ITS-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, as described (4Hafez M. Infante D. Winawer S. Friedman E. Yan Z. Hsu S. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1990; 1: 617-626PubMed Google Scholar). Treatment of Ki-ras and Ha-ras transfectants was essentially as described (15Chen G. Oh S. Monia B. Stacey D. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 28259-28265Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded per well at 2 × 105 in 6-well plates. 24 h later the cells were washed with pre-warmed serum-free ITS-Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and then incubated in this medium with a fixed ratio of oligonucleotide to Lipofectin (2.4 μl of Lipofectin per 100 μmoligonucleotide) for 4 h. The oligonucleotide-containing medium was then replaced with normal growth medium, and growth continued for 48 h to allow Ras turnover plus reduced Ras mRNA levels to result in reduced Ras protein level. 50 μg of cell lysate proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes after separation on 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The blots were blocked in PBS containing 4% bovine serum albumin and 0.05% Tween 20 (blocking buffer) for 1 h at room temperature, incubated for 1 h with a 1:500 dilution of col-1 (anti-CEA), 1 μg/ml anti-cathepsin B, 1:2000 dilution of E-cadherin antibody, a 1:100 dilution of N-cadherin antibody, or 5 μg/ml pan-ras antibody, washed once in blocking buffer, then incubated for 1 h with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (H and L chains, Cappel/Cooper Biomedical) at 1:500 in blocking buffer. The blots were then washed once in blocking buffer and either detected by incubation for 30 min at 25 ° with 1 uCi/ml 125I-protein A followed by washing and autoradiography or by using enhanced chemiluminescence. The method is essentially the same as that used previously (16Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 13231-13237Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were cultured in 100-mm dishes until subconfluent, and cells were prelabeled overnight with [35S]methionine (625 uCi/ml, 1220 Ci/mmol) and lysed in 0.5 ml of buffer consisting of 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 50 mmTris-HCl, pH 7.5, 20 mm MgCl2, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm Na2P04, pH 7.4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 mmbenzamidine, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 50 μg of monoclonal antibody Y13–259 was added and incubation proceeded for 1 h. p21ras·Y13–259 complexes were precipitated by addition of 10 μl of rabbit anti-rat IgG (Cappel) (about 20 μg) per mg of total protein, which had been prebound for 1 h with 60 μl of protein A-Sepharose, and then cleared of unbound antibody by centrifugation, followed by incubation for 10 min with 10 μl of 2% bovine serum albumin. The p21ras·Y13–259 complexes and rabbit anti-rat IgG prebound to protein A and saturated with bovine serum albumin were incubated for an additional hour and washed two times with lysis buffer and three times with TBST (25 mmTris, pH 8, 125 mm NaCl, 0.025% Tween 20) before analysis. 20 μg of total RNA from each cell line was electrophoresed in a 0.8% agarose-formaldehyde gel, transferred to nylon membranes by downward capillary transfer, and UV cross-linked. The membranes were hybridized to either a full-length human cathepsin B cDNA or a polymerase chain reaction-generated cDNA corresponding to base pairs 55–638 from the translation start of human CEA. Probes were labeled with 32P by random priming. The blot was hybridized overnight at 42 °C with at least 107cpm of the labeled probe, washed at room temperature three times for 7 min with 1 × SSC, 1% SDS, then washed for 20 min at 52 °C in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS, and autoradiographed. The CEA blot was stripped and rehybridized to GAPDH, whereas the cathepsin B blot was rehybridized to human 18 S rRNA cDNA. Sections were deparaffinized with xylene and hydrated in graded alcohols, and endogenous peroxidase was quenched with 1% H202. Sections were blocked in a 1:67 dilution of normal horse serum (Life Technologies, Inc.) in PBS containing 2% bovine serum albumin (PBS diluent) and then incubated in antibody col-1 at a 1:50 dilution in PBS overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes in PBS diluent, 1:67 dilution of biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG in PBS diluent was added for 30 min, followed by ABC reagent and detection using the ABC kit manufacturer's instructions. Slides were counterstained with Harris' hematoxylin. Cells were cultured on Costar transwells with 2 ml of medium under the layer and 1.5 ml above the layer for 2 weeks postconfluence with media changes 3 times a week, fixed and analyzed for CEA production by immunocytochemistry as above. Cells were harvested by gentle trypsinization for 3 min with 0.025% trypsin, 0.01% EDTA in 0.15m NaCl. Cells were washed once with 10 mm EDTA in 1 × PBS, pelleted, and resuspended at 2–3 × 106/ml in 5 mm EDTA, 1 × PBS followed by disaggregation by repeated forceful passages through a transfer pipette. 1-ml aliquots in a 15 × 100-mm test tube were shaken gently for the indicated times at a 45 ° angle in an orbital shaker at room temperature. A sample was taken gently with a pasteur pipette and counted visually using a hemacytometer. For each determination, duplicate aggregation experiments were performed. 5 mmCaCl2 was added to the aggregation experiments performed in the presence of calcium. Anti-CEA monoclonal antibody col-1 and control isotype monoclonal antibody MOPC-21 at 1 mg/ml were digested with papain as described (5Yan Z. Robinson-Saddler A. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). 100 μg/ml Fab′ fragments were added to each aggregation assay. Transfections of HD6-4 colon epithelial cells had been performed with a mini-gene construct of the cellular Ki-ras4B gene mutated at codon 12 to valine (Ki-ras G12V), an expression plasmid encoding a mini-gene construct of the wild-type cellular Ki-ras4B gene, and a cellular Ha-ras G12V expression plasmid. We isolated three independent transfectant clones expressing the Ki-ras4BG12V oncogene: 4V, 4V1, and 4V2; three independent transfectant clones expressing the Ha-ras G12V oncogene: H15, H18, and H25; and transfectant clone 4G1, expressing the transfected wild-type Ki-ras4B gene. The transfected oncogenes were expressed as active proteins, which had been identified by Western blotting with pan-ras Val-12 antibody, and these oncogenic proteins bound elevated levels of GTP.1 Whereas the Ki-ras transfectants displayed elevated levels of Ki-Ras proteins and the Ha-ras transfectants displayed elevated levels of Ha-Ras proteins, as expected,1 all the transfectants expressed equal amounts of total Ras proteins as shown by Western blotting of cell lysates with a pan-Ras antibody (Fig.1 A) or by immunoprecipitation from 35S-prelabeled cells (Fig. 1 B). Possibly expression of the transfected oncogenic Ras proteins down-regulated levels of endogenous Ras proteins. In an earlier study, we observed that the culture of HD6-4 cells in low calcium medium prevented both apicobasal and basolateral polarization (5Yan Z. Robinson-Saddler A. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). When HD6-4 cells polarized, levels of E-cadherin increased 35-fold and mediated lateral adherence between adjacent cells to form the HD6-4 monolayer. When cells were prevented from polarization by low calcium, E-cadherin levels were not increased, but levels of CEA increased 3-fold and mediated multicellular aggregation (5Yan Z. Robinson-Saddler A. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Thus we expected that oncogenic Ki-ras, which blocked apicobasal polarization, 1Yan, Z., Chen, M., Perucho, M., and Friedman, E. (1997) J. Biol. Chem, in press. would also decrease expression of E-cadherin. However, Ki-ras and Ha-ras transfectant cells expressed levels of E-cadherin equal to those expressed by parental or wild-type Ki-ras4B transfectant clone 4G1 (Fig. 2). However, low calcium medium and oncogenic Ki-ras similarly induced CEA expression. Each of the three transfectant clones expressing the Ki-ras4BG12V oncogene: 4V, 4V1, and 4V2, expressed elevated levels of the embryonic adhesion protein CEA compared with each of the three independent transfectant clones expressing the Ha-ras G12V oncogene: H15, H18, and H25, and the parental line (Fig. 3). Instead of decreasing expression of E-cadherin, expression of oncogenic Ki-ras unexpectedly led to decreased levels of the adult adhesion protein N-cadherin in each of the three transfectant lines (Fig. 3).Figure 3Upper panel, Western blots showing increased CEA protein abundance in each of three Ki-ras val12 but not in any of three Ha-ras val12 colon epithelial cell transfectants compared with parental HD6-4 cells. Middle panel, Western blot showing decreased N-cadherin protein abundance in Ki-ras val12 but not Ha-ras val12 colon epithelial cell transfectants.Lower panel, Western blot showing increased cathepsin B protein in Ki-ras val12 but not Ha-ras val12 colon epithelial cell transfectants. Abundance of mature single chain of cathepsin B at 31 kDa is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We then examined CEA expression by Northern analysis. Transcripts representing CEA (3.0 kb) and a CEA family member called NCA at 2.6 kb were detected in each cell line (Fig. 4). Each of the three transfectant clones expressing the Ki-ras4BG12V oncogene: 4V, 4V1, and 4V2, expressed elevated levels of CEA mRNA and decreased levels of NCA mRNA compared with each of the three independent transfectant clones expressing the Ha-ras G12V oncogene: H15, H18, and H25, and the parental line (Fig. 3). Thus, expression of oncogenic Ki-ras elevated CEA expression at the transcriptional level. Oncogenic Ha-Ras proteins in the Ha-transfectant cells were expressed at roughly equivalent protein levels to the oncogenic Ki-Ras proteins in the Ki-transfectant cells as assayed by Western blotting1 (Fig. 1). Thus, the inability of oncogenic Ha-Ras proteins to increase CEA transcription in these colon epithelial cells was not due to low levels of expression of Ha-Ras proteins. Blocking transcription of the transfected oncogenic Ki-ras gene in 4V2 cells blocked expression of CEA. A 4-h treatment with oligonucleotides (see “Experimental Procedures”) was followed by a 48-h chase to allow turnover of the endogenous Ki-Ras mRNA and protein. In each of three experiments a decrease in CEA protein abundance was seen in 4V2 cells treated with antisense oligonucleotides directed to the Ki-ras gene (A) compared with 4V2 cells treated with random sequence oligonucleotides (R) or untreated cells (C) (Fig. 5). Two concentrations of oligonucleotides were used. 100 nm of the antisense oligonucleotide decreased CEA expression marginally, whereas 200 nm almost completely blocked CEA expression although CEA expression was unaltered by either concentration of the random sequence oligonucleotide. Thus, the increase in CEA expression seen in each of three independently cloned transfectant lines is not due to some extraneous event in the establishment of these lines but is directly due to the functioning of the oncogenic c-Ki-rasgene. The HD6-4 parental line and the HD6-4G1 line grow as monolayers when grown in vitro on a transwell that allows feeding through the basal surface as occurs in vivo (Fig.6, panels 1–3). Cells form lateral attachments and polarize so that their nuclei are found at the basal end of the cell, and CEA expression as identified by immunocytochemistry is restricted to the apical portion (Fig. 6,panels 2 and 3; panel 1 is immunohistochemistry control). In contrast, HD6-4V cells expressing oncogenic Ki-Ras proteins do not polarize and form a monolayer but instead multilayer (Fig. 6, panel 4). Nuclei are not found polarized to the basal region of the cell nearest the transwell membrane but at various locations in the cytoplasm. CEA is abundantly expressed at all cell surfaces and can be clearly seen between the cells where it could mediate adhesion. Rounded, unpolarized HD6-4V cells express CEA all along their cell membrane (Fig. 6) and thus can use CEA to aggregate (Fig. 7). Cultures of the parental HD6-4 line, the wild-type Ki-ras control HD6-4G1 line, and the oncogenic Ki-ras HD6-4V line were dissociated to single cells. The capacity of each cell preparation to aggregate was tested by performing the aggregation under permissive conditions in calcium-containing medium, which would allow adherence through cadherins and would not block adherence through CEA (Fig.7 C). In these preparations about 70% of the parental and wild-type Ki-ras transfectants and 50% of the HD6-4V line aggregated. A parallel aggregation experiment was carried out in medium without calcium. Under these conditions only calcium-independent adhesion could occur such as that mediated by CEA, whereas cadherin-mediated adhesion that requires calcium would be blocked. Cells were gently agitated in calcium-free medium in the presence of Fab′ fragments of an isotype control antibody, MOPC-21. Neither the parental HD6-4 cells nor the wild-type ras transfectant HD6-4G1 cells were able to aggregate in the absence of calcium (<10%) showing that they did not use their apical cell surface CEA (Fig. 6) to aggregate (Fig. 7 A). However, half of the unpolarized HD6-4V cells capable of aggregation in vitro (Fig. 7 C) used their cell surface CEA molecules to aggregate (Fig.7 A). CEA was shown to be the adherence molecule as HD6-4V cells were able to form aggregrates in the presence of the isotype control antibody (Fig. 7 A) but not in the presence of Fab′ fragments of a monoclonal antibody to CEA, col-1 (Fig.7 B). When assayed for in vitro invasion through a collagen I coated modified Boyden chamber (17Hsu S. Huang F. Hafez M. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1994; 5: 267-275PubMed Google Scholar), HD6-4V cells exhibited over double the invasion capability as the HD6-4G1 control transfectant line (28 ± 9 versus 11 ± 3 invasive cells per field, n = 8, mean ± S.E.). We wondered whether the oncogenic Ki-ras gene had increased expression of a protease associated with colon cancer invasion. We investigated expression of the lysosomal protease cathepsin B as transfection of the c-Ha-ras oncogene into MCF-10 human breast epithelial cells increased the protein level and the membrane association of cathepsin B (18Sloane B. Moin K. Sameni M. Tait L. Rozhin J. Ziegler G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 373-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Analysis by Western blotting (Fig. 3) demonstrated an increase in expression of mature single chain cathepsin B protein of 31 kDa in each of the three transfectant clones expressing the Ki-ras4BG12V oncogene: 4V, 4V1, and 4V2, compared with each of the three independent transfectant clones expressing the Ha-ras G12V oncogene: H15, H18, and H25, and the parental line, as well as the wild-type Ki-ras transfectant (data not shown). However, the increase in cathepsin B expression was post-transcriptional as HD6-4V cells exhibited no increase in cathepsin B mRNA expression level compared with control cells (Fig. 8), which is similar to the post-transcriptional regulation observed in Ha-ras transformed MCF-10 human breast epithelial cells (18Sloane B. Moin K. Sameni M. Tait L. Rozhin J. Ziegler G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 373-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Two cathepsin B transcripts were seen in colon epithelial cells, one of 4 kb and one of 2 kb. Duplicate experiments showed no increase in either 4-kb or 2-kb cathepsin B transcripts in HD6-4V cells compared with wild-type Ki-ras transfectant 4G1 cells or parental cells, normalized to 18 S rRNA levels by densitometry analysis. Thus, cathepsin B expression is controlled by post-transcriptional mechanisms in both breast cancer cells transfected with oncogenic Ha-ras (18Sloane B. Moin K. Sameni M. Tait L. Rozhin J. Ziegler G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 373-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in colon cancer cells transfected with oncogenic Ki-ras (this study). Cathepsin B is present in vesicles in the apical region of normal colon epithelial cells and some benign tumor cells, but with progression to carcinoma, vesicles staining for cathepsin B are redistributed to the basal pole of the cell just inside the basal membrane adjacent to the underlying basement membrane (19Campo E. Munoz J. Miquel R. Palacin A. Cardesa A. Sloane B.F. Emmert-Buck M.R. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 301-309PubMed Google Scholar). Altered intracellular trafficking of cathepsin B and its membrane association may be caused by ras-induced morphological changes in both Ha-ras-transfected breast cancer cells (18Sloane B. Moin K. Sameni M. Tait L. Rozhin J. Ziegler G. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 373-384Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and in Ki-ras-transfected colon cancer cells (this study). The mammalian ras gene family comprises a highly conserved gene family of 21 kDa GDP/GTP-regulated switches, which relay signals from receptor tyrosine kinases to multiple effectors including the mitogen-activated protein kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, and GAP, among others. Three mammalian ras isoforms, Ki-, Ha- and N-ras, share many biochemical, structural, and functional characteristics including localization to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Transforming ras mutations lockras molecules in the active GTP-bound state and are found in about 40% of all human cancers. However, Ki-, Ha-, and N-ras must play different roles in transformation in different cell types. A comparison of the three human rasgenes, each carrying a G12D mutation, demonstrated that oncogenic Ha-ras was more transforming in rat-2 and NIH3T3 fibroblasts, whereas oncogenic N-ras was more transforming in hematopoietic TF-1 cells (20Maher J. Baker D. Manning M. Dibb N. Roberts I. Oncogene. 1995; 11: 1639-1647PubMed Google Scholar). The vast majority of rasmutations in colon cancers are in Ki-ras with only a few percent in N-ras and none reported in Ha-ras (8Forrester K. Almoguera C. Han K. Grizzle W.E. Perucho M. Nature. 1987; 327: 298-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). The selection of Ki-ras mutations in the genesis of colon cancers suggested that mutations in this ras isoform might have different effects on colon epithelial cells than mutations in Ha-ras. In an earlier study we demonstrated that oncogenic Ki-ras4BVal-12, but not oncogenic Ha-ras Val-12, blocks the apicobasal polarization of colon epithelial cells by preventing normal glycosylation of the β chain of the collagen receptor α2β1 integrin. We now show that that oncogenic Ki-ras4BVal-12, but not oncogenic Ha-ras val12, up-regulates expression of CEA on the mRNA and protein levels in colon epithelial cells and coincidentally down-regulates expression of the homophilic cell adhesion molecule N-cadherin. Ectopic expression of CEA in melanoma cells was shown to decrease transcription of another homophilic cell adhesion molecule, NCAM (21Grimm T. Johnson J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3254-3257PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, CEA may function to selectively alter expression of other cell adhesion molecules. In an earlier study we found that preventing the expression of E-cadherin by culture in low calcium medium led to the up-regulation of CEA in colon epithelial cells (5Yan Z. Robinson-Saddler A. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1993; 4: 1-8PubMed Google Scholar). Possibly the cell can express either embryonic adhesion molecules like CEA or the cadherin class of calcium-dependent adhesion molecules. Up-regulation of CEA by either transfection (21Grimm T. Johnson J. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 3254-3257PubMed Google Scholar) or in this study, expression of oncogenic Ki-ras4BVal-12 may inhibit transcription of one or more cadherins typically expressed by the cell. In the current study, N-cadherin, but not E-cadherin, was down-regulated by expression of CEA. Up-regulation of CEA by oncogenic Ki-ras was paralleled by down-regulation of a closely related homotypic adhesion molecule, NCA. NCA is also up-regulated in various cancer cells but apparently not by oncogenic Ki-ras. CEA is a cell surface glycoprotein and intercellular adhesion protein that is often increased in abundance and unrestricted in spatial expression in cancer cells (22Eidelman F. Fuks A. DeMarte L. Tahery M. Stanners C. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 123: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). CEA was originally described as an oncofetal protein in colon carcinoma cells. During the early weeks of gestation, the human embryonic intestine is multilayered and exhibits CEA expression in adjacent cell membranes when cells develop in multilayered arrays. At later times in gestation and in the adult, the colonocytes form a palisaded monolayer and CEA is localized to the apical luminal membrane (23Benchimol S. Fuks A. Jothy S. Beauchemin N. Shirota K. Stanners C.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar). In the current studies, HD6-4V cells could not polarize and expressed CEA molecules all over the cell surface. When HD6-4V cells aggregated in multilayered cell arrays, they expressed CEA at points of contact where CEA mediated intercellular adhesion, reproducing the embryonic phenotype. CEA is known to enhance experimental metastasis (24Tibbetts L. Doremus C. Tzanakakis G. Vezeridis M. Cancer (Phila.). 1993; 71: 315-321Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), probably through its capacity to mediate cell adhesion. CEA injected intravenously into nude mice before injection of tumor cells with low metastatic potential enhanced metastasis by increasing the retention of such tumor cells within the liver and lungs 4 h after intrasplenic injection (25Jessup J.M. Petrick A.T. Toth C.A. Ford R. Meterissian S. O'Hara C.J. Steele Jr., G. Thomas P. Br. J. Cancer. 1993; 67: 464-470Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). A strong correlation was found between formation of metastases and early retention of tumor cells after injection. Cell aggregates formed by cell surface CEA molecules may more readily implant in sites of metastasis than single cells. CEA mediated homotypic aggregation of LS-180 colon carcinoma cells (23Benchimol S. Fuks A. Jothy S. Beauchemin N. Shirota K. Stanners C.P. Cell. 1989; 57: 327-334Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (834) Google Scholar) and indirectly mediated colon carcinoma attachment to collagen (9Hafez M. Hsu S. Yan Z. Winawer S. Friedman E. Cell Growth Differ. 1992; 3: 753-762PubMed Google Scholar) probably because of its adhesive cell to cell properties. The familiar pattern of colon carcinoma cell multilayered growth may result, at least in part, from the adhesive properties of overexpressed and inappropriately localized CEA."
https://openalex.org/W2077064550,"Soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein (α-SNAP) is a soluble protein that enables the NSF ATPase to associate with membranes and facilitate membrane trafficking events. Although NSF and α-SNAP have been shown to be required for many membrane transport processes, their role in the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors from endosomes to the trans Golgi network was not established. We present here a novel in vitro assay that monitors the transport of cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptors between endosomes and the trans Golgi network. The assay relies on the trans Golgi network localization of tyrosine sulfotransferase and monitors transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors engineered to contain a consensus sequence for modification by this enzyme. Using this new assay we show that α-SNAP strongly stimulates transport in reactions containing limiting amounts of cytosol. Together with α-SNAP, NSF can increase the extent of transport.

NSF requires the so-called SNAP proteins to bind to membranes. Three SNAP isoforms have been identified: α, β, and γ (4Clary D.O. Griff I.C. Rothman J.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 709-721Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). SNAPs are soluble proteins that bind saturably to Golgi membranes (5Weidman P.J. Melançon P. Block M.R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1589-1596Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 6Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Wilson D.W. Wiedmann M. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12239-12243Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When NSF is mixed together with α-SNAP and a detergent extract of salt-washed Golgi membranes, NSF and α-SNAP become incorporated into a 20 S complex (7Wilson D.W. Whiteheart S.W. Wiedmann M. Brunner M. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 531-538Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Characterization of the proteins contained within this complex led to the identification of the SNAP receptors or SNAREs (8Söllner T. Whiteheart S.W. Brunner M. Erdjument-Bromage H. Geromanos S. Tempst P. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 318-323Crossref PubMed Scopus (2628) Google Scholar). Pairing of v-SNAREs on transport vesicles and t-SNAREs on their cognate membrane targets is thought to provide specificity for vesicle docking and fusion events (3Rothman J.E. Nature. 1994; 372: 55-63Crossref PubMed Scopus (2007) Google Scholar). ATP hydrolysis by NSF induces a conformational change in the SNARE proteins (9Hanson P.I. Otto H. Barton N. Jahn R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 16955-16961Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) that triggers SNARE complex disassembly, prior to membrane fusion. α-SNAP and NSF have been implicated in most heterotypic and homotypic docking and fusion reactions (3Rothman J.E.

However in MDCK cells, transport from the trans Golgi network (TGN) to the apical plasma membrane was independent of NSF and could not be stimulated by α-SNAP (15Ikonen E. Tagaya M. Ullrich O. Montecucco C. Simons K. Cell. 1995; 81: 571-580Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). In yeast, a late step in the delivery of internalized α-factor to the vacuole requires an NSF homolog, the END13 gene product (16Munn A.L. Riezman H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Furthermore, delivery of carboxypeptidase Y from the TGN to the vacuole was shown to be independent of NSF (17Graham T.R. Emr S.D. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 114: 207-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Carboxypeptidase Y is sorted by a receptor in the TGN for delivery to the endosomal/vacuolar system. The sorting receptor, Vps10p, has to return to the TGN for additional rounds of transport (18Cooper A.A. Stevens T.H. J. Cell Biol. 1996; 133: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (240) Google Scholar). Thus, it was possible that recycling from endosomes to the TGN might also be independent of NSF. We study the transport of mannose 6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) between endosomes and the TGN, both in cultured cells (cf. Ref. 19Riederer M.A. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Lin J. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar) and in an in vitro assay that reconstitutes this transport process (20Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 309-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). In mammalian cells, MPRs carry lysosomal hydrolases from the TGN to endosomes, where they release the hydrolases and then return to the TGN for another round of transport (21Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). In previous work, we were unable to determine if NSF was required for endosome-to-TGN transport because this step requires a factor that is more sensitive toN-ethylmaleimide than NSF (22Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Although NSF-depleted cytosol was active in in vitro transport, it was possible that the abundant, membrane-associated NSF present in those reactions was sufficient for the transport observed. Using a novel in vitro transport assay, we show here that α-SNAP stimulates the recycling of MPRs from endosomes to the TGN. Furthermore, NSF can stimulate transport in the presence of α-SNAP. GDI and Rab9·GDI complexes were prepared as described (23Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15427-15430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor (MPR46) cDNA was a gift of Dr. Bernhard Hoflack (EMBL, Heidelberg, Germany). The bacterial expression plasmid pMW183 containing His6::NodQ2 was a gift of Dr. Sharon Long (Stanford University). Dr. James Rothman (Sloan-Kettering, New York), Dr. Sidney Whiteheart (Kentucky College of Medicine, Lexington), and Dr. Thomas Mayer (University of Muenster, Germany) kindly provided expression plasmids for His-tagged versions of NSF, α-SNAP, and Rab1b N121I, respectively. The following chemicals (Sigma) were kept as stocks: 100 × protease inhibitor mix: 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 4 mg/ml aprotinin, 100 μm pepstatin A, stored at −80 °C; 20 mg/ml cycloheximide in ethanol and 20 mm primaquine in H2O, stored at −20 °C. MPR46 cDNA (24Ludwig T. Rüther U. Metzger R. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Lobel P. Hoflack B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12211-12219Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was inserted as an EcoRI fragment in Bluescript SK (Stratagene). First a tyrosine sulfation site (25Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was introduced at cDNA position 241 of mouse MPR46 by polymerase chain reaction and cloned via a primer-based 5′-NcoI site to the 3′-end of an influenza virus hemagglutinin leader sequence fused to a FLAG epitope tag that was derived from pSP65SFβ2 (26Guan X.-M. Kobilka T.-S. Kobilka B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 21995-21998Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Next, the sequence encoding the FLAG epitope tag was replaced by polymerase chain reaction with a cassette coding for a (His)6/myc-epitope tag (see Fig. 1 B). The modified 5′-region was cloned back to the MPR46 cDNA via a ScaI site at position 346, replacing its 5′-region. This construct was designated MPR46HMY and confirmed by DNA sequencing. MPR46HMY was cloned as anXhoI/XbaI fragment into pME18S (K. Maruyama, University of Tokyo). This construct and pSV2neo (ratio 10:1) were cotransfected by electroporation into CHO cells. Stable transformants were selected with geneticin (1 mg/ml, Life Technologies, Inc.) in α-MEM supplemented with 7.5% fetal calf serum. Of 23 isolated clones, 11 were positive by Western blot and indirect immunofluorescence (27Warren G. Davoust J. Cockcroft A. EMBO J. 1984; 3: 2217-2225Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) using monoclonal antibody 9E10 against the c-myc epitope (28Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar). Clones were maintained in the above medium. All studies were carried out with clone 3. The synthesis of 35S-labeled 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) was modified from Ehrhardt et al.(29Ehrhardt D.W. Atkinson E.M. Faull K.F. Freedberg D.I. Sutherlin D.P. Armstrong R. Long S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6237-6245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction is outlined in Fig. 1 C. A typical synthesis reaction, total volume of 200 μl, consisted of 1 mCi of sodium [35S]sulfate (ICN) in reaction buffer (10 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 30 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 10% glycerol) containing 20 mm ATP, 10 mm GTP, 10 units/ml ATP-sulfurylase fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae (Sigma), 100 units/ml inorganic pyrophosphatase (Sigma), and 10 μg/ml recombinant His-tagged NodQ2 gene product from Rhizobium meliloti (NodQ2 has both ATP-sulfurylase and APS kinase activity (49Schwedoch J.S. Liu C. Leyh T.S. Long S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1994; 176: 7055-7064Crossref PubMed Google Scholar)). The reaction was incubated for 2 h at 30 °C, and enzymes were inactivated by boiling for 1 min and aggregates pelleted for 2 min in a microcentrifuge. The reaction mix was diluted to 2 ml with distilled H2O yielding a specific activity of 0.5 μCi/μl (corresponding to ∼ 0.3 mm PAPS). The extent of conversion of [35S]sulfate into [35S]PAPS was monitored by spotting 2 μl of the reaction product onto a polyethyleneimine-cellulose F (Merck) TLC plate, previously washed for 5 min with H2O and dried. The reaction products were resolved by 0.9 m LiCl. Cells were grown to subconfluency, washed with TD (25 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 5.4 mm KCl, 137 mm NaCl, 0.3 mmNa2HPO4), and preincubated in labeling medium for 15 min (α-MEM lacking methionine and cysteine but containing 7.5% dialyzed fetal calf serum). Cells were pulsed for 15 min with 1 mCi/ml [35S]methionine and -cysteine (Tran35S-label, ICN), transferred to ice, washed twice with chase medium (α-MEM, 7.5% fetal calf serum, 10 mmmethionine, 10 mm cysteine), and chased for the indicated times. Cells were transferred to ice, washed with TD, harvested in RIPA (50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 7.8, 150 mm NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 1.5% Triton X-100) in the presence of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and solubilized for 1 h. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was transferred to a new tube; 5 μl of mAb 9E10 ascites fluid was added and incubated for 1 h on ice. Rabbit anti-mouse IgG (2.5 μl, Calbiochem) was added for 30 min, and the immune complexes were harvested at 4 °C overnight with 25 μl of Staphylococcus aureus cells (Pansorbin, Calbiochem), preincubated for 1 h with RIPA containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. Complexes were pelleted and washed 4 × with RIPA and 1 × with TD. Immune complexes were released by boiling for 5 min in 50 μl of sample buffer. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE (30Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207233) Google Scholar); the gel was treated with Entensify (ICN), dried, and exposed to film. For the cycloheximide chase experiments, preincubation and labeling were as described above. The chase was initiated by adding 20 μg/ml cycloheximide (Sigma) to the labeling medium; [35S]methionine and -cysteine were also present throughout the chase. Cells were transferred to ice, washed 2 × with TD, and solubilized for 2 h with RIPA, 25 mmimidazole. After centrifugation at 100,000 × g at 4 °C, the supernatant was added to 10 μl of Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen), prewashed with RIPA, 25 mm imidazole. For endo H reactions, MPR46HMY was allowed to bind to the beads at 4 °C for 1 h, washed 4 × with RIPA, 25 mm imidazole, 1 × with TD, boiled for 3 min in 50 μl of 200 mmsodium citrate, pH 5.5, 2% SDS, frozen at −20 °C for 30 min, and boiled again for 3 min. Then the samples were diluted with an equal volume of distilled water containing 2 × protease inhibitors and incubated with 4 milliunits of endo H (Boehringer Mannheim) for 22 h at 37 °C. Proteins were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE, and the gel was treated with Entensify (ICN), dried, and exposed to film. Cells were grown to subconfluency, washed 2 × with TD, and labeled for 2 h with 1 mCi/ml [35S]sulfate (ICN) in sulfate-free medium CRCM-30 (Sigma). Cells from 20 × 10-cm dishes were processed in parallel providing membranes for 500 assays. Cells were split 1:25 and cultured for 3 days in 10-cm cell culture dishes in a modified sulfate-free α-MEM medium (salt mix (final concentration): 1.8 mm CaCl2, 5.36 mm KCl, 0.39 mm MgCl2, 116.36 mm NaCl, 1.01 mmNaH2PO4, 5.56 mmd-Glc, 1 mm sodium pyruvate, 0.28 mml-ascorbic acid, 26.19 mm NaHCO3, 0.03 mm phenol red; 1 × MEM amino acids; 1 ×l-Gln: 1 × non-essential amino acids; 1 × MEM vitamin solution (Life Technologies, Inc.)) containing 7.5% fetal calf serum and 10 mm sodium chlorate. The medium was changed every day. Before breaking the cells, cycloheximide was added to a final concentration of 20 μg/ml and cells were incubated for 4 h. Cell breakage was modified from Acharyaet al. (31Acharya U. McCaffery J.M. Jacobs R. Malhotra V. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 577-589Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Cells were washed once with KHM buffer (25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4, 125 mm potassium acetate, 2.5 mm magnesium acetate, 1 mm dithiothreitol), drained well, and snap-frozen on a metal plate cooled on dry ice. After thawing the cells for 4 min at room temperature, they were transferred on ice and washed 2 × with KHM to remove cytosol. The plates were drained extensively; 250 μl of SEAT buffer (10 mmtriethanolamine, 10 mm acetic acid, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.25 m sucrose) was added, and the cells were scraped with a rubber policeman and pooled. Broken cells were preincubated with unlabeled PAPS in the absence of added cytosol to reduce Golgi-derived background. 250 μl of broken cells in SEAT were mixed with 80 μl of RB buffer (250 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.2, 15 mm magnesium acetate, 250 mm KCl), 120 μl of ATP mix (10 mm ATP, pH 7, 150 mm creatine phosphate, 20 mmMgCl2, 210 units/ml creatine phosphokinase, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.4 mg/ml aprotinin, 10 μm pepstatin A), 260 μl of 0.75 m sucrose, 5 μl of 5 mm PAPS (Sigma, ∼25 μm final), and H20 to a final volume of 1 ml. After 15 min at 37 °C the mix was overlaid on a snap-frozen sucrose cushion (20 μl of 1 m, 40 μl of 0.5m sucrose). The sucrose was thawed for 5 min on ice, and the membranes were pelleted for 5 min at 4 °C in a microcentrifuge at top speed. 850 μl of the supernatant was removed, and the membranes were resuspended in the remaining volume. Resuspended membranes were pooled, aliquoted, and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C. Routinely, transport reactions were carried out in a final volume of 150 μl. A standard transport reaction consisted of 8 μl of RB, 12 μl of ATP mix, 1.4 μl of 2m sodium chlorate, H2O, 10 μl of 0.5 μCi/μl [35S]PAPS (∼20 μm final), 6 μl of membranes, rapidly thawed at 37 °C, and 14 μl of SEAT, and 0 to 1 mg/ml desalted cytosol in 25 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.6, 50 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mm ATP and protease inhibitors (22Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). Reactions were generally carried out at 37 °C and stopped on ice. The membranes were solubilized with 500 μl of RIPA, 25 mm imidazole for 2 h on ice; insoluble material was pelleted in a microcentrifuge for 5 min, and the supernatant was transferred onto 10 μl of prewashed Ni-NTA agarose beads. MPR46HMY were allowed to bind for 1 h at 4 °C, followed by 4 washes with RIPA, 25 mm imidazole and eluted with 100 μl of 25 mm EDTA in RIPA, 25 mm imidazole. Histidine-tagged bacterially expressed α-SNAP and NSF were purified essentially as described by Whiteheart et al. (2Whiteheart S.W. Rossnagel K. Buhrow S.A. Brunner M. Janicke R. Rothman J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 126: 945-954Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar,32Whiteheart S.W. Griff I.C. Brunner M. Clary D.O. Mayer T. Buhrow S.A. Rothman J.E. Nature. 1993; 362: 353-355Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). For NSF the only change is that the final step is an S-300 column instead of a Superose 6 Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). ATPase assays were carried out as described in Tagaya et al. (33Tagaya M. Wilson D.W. Brunner M. Arango N. Rothman J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2662-2666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, data not shown). His6::NodQ2, the ATP-sulfurylase/APS kinase from R. meliloti, was expressed in XL-1 blue cells grown to an A 660 of 0.8 at 37 °C, induced for 4 h at 30 °C with 20 μm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. The cells were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 8, 300 mm NaCl, 20 mm imidazole, 10% glycerol, and disrupted by French press. Homogenates were cleared by centrifugation, and the supernatant was incubated with 1 ml of Ni-NTA agarose for 30 min at 4 °C. The column was packed, washed with 100 volumes of buffer, and eluted with 500 mm imidazole in buffer. Essentially pure fractions were pooled and dialyzed against 20 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8, 30 mm KCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, aliquoted, and stored at −80 °C. Activity of His6::NodQ2 was verified measuring the conversion of radiolabeled sulfate to radiolabeled PAPS and separation of the reaction products by TLC as described above (see Fig.3 B). In previous work, we were unable to determine if NSF was required for endosome-to-TGN transport because this step requires a factor that is more sensitive to N-ethylmaleimide than NSF (22Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 112: 823-831Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). In these experiments, it was possible that the abundant, membrane-associated NSF was sufficient for the transport observed. Thus, we sought to establish a facile assay that reconstituted the same transport process but might show greater dependence upon added cytosolic factors. Our previously established in vitro transport reaction makes use of the TGN localization of sialyltransferase and a CHO mutant cell line in which N-linked oligosaccharide sialylation does not occur (20Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 309-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Transport requires the presence of purified, “wild type” rat liver Golgi membranes, as well as ATP and cytosolic proteins. Although this assay has enabled us to show a role for the Rab9 GTPase and Rab9·GDI complexes in MPR trafficking (23Dirac-Svejstrup A.B. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Pfeffer S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15427-15430Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 34Lombardi D. Soldati T. Riederer M.A. Goda Y. Zerial M. Pfeffer S.R. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 677-682Crossref PubMed Scopus (440) Google Scholar), it requires time-consuming metabolic labeling, tedious chromatography steps, SDS-PAGE, and fluorography. Our new assay (Fig. 1) takes advantage of another TGN-specific enzyme, tyrosine sulfotransferase (35Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 141: 870-877Crossref Scopus (293) Google Scholar, 36Rosa P. Mantovani S. Rosboch R. Huttner W.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 12227-12232Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The N terminus of the cation-dependent, murine MPR (MPR46, 24) was engineered to contain a tyrosine sulfotransferase recognition sequence derived from the C terminus of the cholecystokinin precursor (37Rosenquist G.L. Nicholas H.B. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 215-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Leitinger et al. (25Leitinger B. Brown J.L. Spiess M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 8115-8121Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have shown that this nonapeptide can serve as a substrate for tyrosine sulfation when transplanted to the C termini of the asialoglycoprotein receptor H1 subunit or α1-proteinase inhibitor. In addition, we added an N-terminal histidine tag for purification (38Hochuli E. Bannwarth W. Doebeli H. Gentz R. Stueber D. Biotechnology. 1988; 6: 1321-1325Crossref Scopus (964) Google Scholar), followed by a myc-tag for detection (Ref. 28Evan G.I. Lewis G.K. Ramsay G. Bishop J.M. Mol. Cell Biol. 1985; 5: 3610-3616Crossref PubMed Scopus (2167) Google Scholar; Fig. 1 B). The modified receptor will be referred to as MPR46HMY. At steady state in cultured cells, endogenous MPRs are found predominantly in late endosomes; a smaller number are present in the TGN and early endosomes, and less than 5–10% are located at the cell surface (21Kornfeld S. Mellman I. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 483-525Crossref PubMed Scopus (1235) Google Scholar). We first analyzed the biochemical properties of MPR46HMYin vivo. CHO cells stably expressing MPR46HMY were pulse-labeled for 15 min and chased for up to 29 h. MPR46HMY was immunoprecipitated with anti-myc tag antibodies and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. Fig.2 A shows that MPR46HMY is stable for more than 29 h. The protein was first detected as a 46-kDa glycoprotein which then increased to ∼50 kDa due to oligosaccharide maturation; it was converted to its mature form, as judged by endo H cleavage, after ∼1 h (Fig. 2 B). As shown previously, mature MPR46 contains both endo H-resistant and endo H-sensitive oligosaccharide chains (cf. Ref. 50Hille A. Waheed A. von Figura K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 963-972Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). These experiments indicate that transport of tagged MPRs through the endoplasmic reticulum and up to the medial Golgi is not delayed due to inefficient folding. To test the functionality of the tyrosine sulfation tag, untransfected CHO cells (Fig. 2 C, lane 1) or cells expressing MPR46HMY (Fig. 2 C, lane 2) were labeled with [35S]sulfate for 2 h, and MPR46HMY was purified by detergent solubilization and nickel agarose binding. Only the transfected cells expressed a sulfate-labeled polypeptide that bound to the nickel resin; only a single prominent polypeptide was detected that had the mobility expected for MPR46HMY. This confirmed that the tyrosine sulfation tag was utilized by tyrosine sulfotransferasein vivo and also that [35S]sulfate-labeled MPR46HMY can be purified in one step by virtue of its histidine tag. The presence of the TGN-specific, tyrosine sulfate modification showed that MPR46HMY was localized at or beyond the TGN. Moreover, the stability of MPR46HMY is a strong indication that it was not mis-sorted to lysosomes, as trafficking mutants of MPR46 are delivered to lysosomes and rapidly degraded there (39Rohrer J. Schweizer A. Johnson K.F. Kornfeld S. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 130: 1297-1306Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Correct localization was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig.3). Upon transient transfection in COS cells, MPR46HMY showed excellent co-localization with the 300-kDa, cation-independent MPR (Fig. 3, A and B). Unfortunately, the anti-300-kDa MPR antibodies do not recognize the CHO cell form of this protein. Nevertheless, in stably expressing CHO cells, MPR46HMY showed predominantly endosomal staining consistent with its normal localization (Fig. 3 C). Resialylation experiments were carried out to test recycling of MPR46HMY from the plasma membrane to the TGN in cultured cells. Cells were pulse-labeled with [35S]sulfate, and glycoproteins reaching the plasma membrane were desialylated with neuraminidase. The cells were then recultured for several hours in the absence of neuraminidase to permit glycoproteins recycling to the TGN to re-acquire sialic acid. The rate of resialylation, determined by slug lectin binding (20Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 309-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar), was identical to that reported for the cation-independent MPR in CHO wild type cells (data not shown; Ref.19Riederer M.A. Soldati T. Shapiro A.D. Lin J. Pfeffer S.R. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 125: 573-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). We therefore conclude that MPR46HMY is functional in terms of its ability to recycle to the TGN in living cells. The new in vitro reaction utilizes [35S]3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) as the precursor for tyrosine sulfation. PAPS is normally synthesized in the cytosol from sulfate and ATP in a two-step process (Fig. 4 A). Sulfate and ATP are first converted to phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (APS) by ATP-sulfurylase; APS is then converted to PAPS by APS kinase. ATP-sulfurylase is reversibly inhibited by chlorate at millimolar concentrations, both in vivo and in vitro (40Baeuerle P.A. Huttner W.B. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 129: 577-589Google Scholar). [35S]PAPS can be synthesized in vitro from [35S]sulfate and ATP with an efficiency of more than 95% (Fig. 4 B), using commercially available ATP-sulfurylase and inorganic pyrophosphatase together with recombinant APS kinase fromR. meliloti (29Ehrhardt D.W. Atkinson E.M. Faull K.F. Freedberg D.I. Sutherlin D.P. Armstrong R. Long S.R. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 6237-6245Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). [35S]PAPS synthesis was monitored by thin layer chromatography (Fig. 4 B) and could be used in in vitro transport reactions without further purification. [35S]PAPS was unstable at 37 °C in the presence of cytosolic proteins. However, inclusion of 10 mmchlorate in reaction mixtures provided significant stabilization of the PAPS substrate (Fig. 4 B). To use tyrosine sulfation as a measure of endosome-to-TGN transport, the rate of tyrosine sulfation must be significantly faster than the rate of the overall transport process. We therefore examined the kinetics of [35S]PAPS translocation and its subsequent incorporation into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material using purified rat liver Golgi membranes. In the presence of 20 μm [35S]PAPS, the half-time for the incorporation of the label into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable counts was reached after 5 min (not shown), which is equivalent to the transport reaction lag phase time period (Ref. 20Goda Y. Pfeffer S.R. Cell. 1988; 55: 309-320Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar; this study, Fig.5 C). This concentration of PAPS exceeds that reported for saturation of the PAPS translocation machinery (5 μm, Ref. 41Schwarz J.K. Capasso J.M. Hirschberg C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 3554-3559Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together, these data suggest that at a concentration of 20 μm [35S]PAPS and in the presence of chlorate (to stabilize PAPS), the kinetics of sulfation should be fast enough to use as an indicator of TGN arrivalin vitro. The new assay utilizes donor membranes containing unsulfated MPR46HMY receptors. To accumulate unsulfated receptors, cultured cells are grown for 3 days in sulfate-free medium containing 10 mmchlorate. Four hours prior to cell harvest, cycloheximide is added to chase newly synthesized MPR46HMY to their steady state localization. After as little as 1 h"
https://openalex.org/W2032250517,"In this work, we provide a rationale for the finding that the estrogen receptor (ER) binds to its DNA response element as a homodimer in vivo. Binding of the monomer estrogen receptor DNA binding domain (ER DBD) to a palindromic, consensus estrogen response element (ERE) is increased 5–6-fold when the ER DBD is dimerized either by a monoclonal antibody that recognizes an attached epitope tag or by expressing the ER DBD as a single molecule in which the two monomers are joined by a peptide linker. Most of the increase in binding is due to stabilization of the ER DBD·ERE complex. We observed only an approximately 2.5-fold reduction in binding when a consensus ERE was replaced with widely spaced ERE half-sites, suggesting that the interaction between ER DBDs on the ERE is relatively weak, and that in full-length ER the DBDs can move independently of each other. To test binding to an imperfect palindrome, typical of the imperfect EREs found in almost all natural estrogen receptor responsive genes, we used the pS2 ERE. Even at high concentrations of ER DBD, specific binding of the ER DBD to the imperfect pS2 ERE was undetectable. Both of the dimerized ER DBDs exhibited efficient binding to the imperfect pS2 ERE, with an affinity at least 25-fold greater than monomer ER DBD. These data support the view that steroid receptor dimerization provides an important mechanism facilitating the recognition of naturally occurring, imperfect hormone response elements.

The intracellular actions of estrogens are mediated by the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ER DBD, estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; AbD-DBD, antibody-dimerized estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; LD-DBD, linker-dimerized estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; PAL3, palindrome with 3 nucleotides between ERE half-sites; EV15, everted ERE with 15 nucleotides between half-sites; DR15, direct repeat of ERE half-sites separated by 15 nucleotides; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; ERE, estrogen response element. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ER DBD, estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; AbD-DBD, antibody-dimerized estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; LD-DBD, linker-dimerized estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; PAL3, palindrome with 3 nucleotides between ERE half-sites; EV15, everted ERE with 15 nucleotides between half-sites; DR15, direct repeat of ERE half-sites separated by 15 nucleotides; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; ERE, estrogen response element. and other members of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors share a common domain structure with discrete regions of the receptors responsible for ligand binding, DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear localization, and transcription activation. Two estrogen receptor domains play a role in dimerization. A strong dimerization interface is located in the ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors (1White R. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A weak dimerization interface is located in the DNA binding domain of steroid receptors (2Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). However, this interface is insufficient to induce solution dimerization, inasmuch as even at high protein concentrations the isolated recombinant ER DNA binding domain is a monomer in solution (4Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schwabe J.W.R. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Nature. 1990; 348: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). When two ER DBD monomers bind to the half-sites of an estrogen response element (ERE), a dimerization interface stabilizes binding of the DBD monomers to the response element (2Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). We refer to this as ERE-dependent DBD dimerization. Although the ER DBD is a monomer in solution, in this work, we did not observe stable occupancy of only one of the two ERE half-sites by a single ER DBD. The ER DBD monomers on the ERE occupy both half-sites and are in the form of ERE-dimerized DBD. The DNA-dependent dimerization interface in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-DBD is sufficiently stable that it can alter binding of GR-DBD monomers to a glucocorticoid response element with an incorrect 4-base spacing (6Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar).It is widely, but not universally (7Murdoch F.E. Byrne L.M. Ariazi E.A. Furlow J.D. Meier D.A. Gorski J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9144-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), accepted that steroid receptors bind to their DNA recognition sequences as dimers. However, ligand binding domain-mediated dimerization is not always required for binding of steroid receptors to their hormone response elements. For example, the ER DBD monomer expressed in Escherichia coli binds to the ERE with a reduced but still significant affinity (3Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). It has been widely assumed, but never actually demonstrated, that dimerization of steroid receptors increases their affinity for their DNA response elements.In this work, we address the effect of dimerization on the interaction of a steroid receptor with a hormone response element, and provide a biological rationale for receptor dimerization. Although ER mutants that are impaired in ligand binding domain dimerization have been reported (1White R. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it appears that these mutants still exhibit some ability to dimerize (8Schodin D.J. Zhuang Y. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore elected to use the ER DBD, which has been shown clearly to be a monomer in solution (4Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schwabe J.W.R. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Nature. 1990; 348: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). We used two very different techniques to artificially dimerize the ER DBD in solution and compared binding to EREs by the dimerized DBD and by the ER DBD monomer. By measuring both equilibrium binding and the association and dissociation of the ER DBDs from a consensus ERE, we show that most of the increase in binding seen with the dimerized ER DBDs is to due to stabilization of the dimerized ER DBD complexes on the ERE. Virtually all EREs identified in ER-regulated genes contain imperfect ERE palindromes. The ER DBD was unable to recognize and bind to an imperfect, non-consensus ERE (from the human PS2 gene), whereas the artificially dimerized ER DBDs bound with high affinity. The striking dimerization-dependent enhancement of binding to an imperfect ERE provides a rationale for dimerization of the estrogen receptor and the other steroid receptors.DISCUSSIONThe DNA recognition sequences of the estrogen receptor and the other steroid hormone receptors are usually palindromic half-sites. In principle, the steroid receptors could interact with their half-sites by binding to them independently as monomers, by binding as monomers and forming interacting dimers on the DNA, or by forming dimers in solution and binding to their recognition sequences as dimeric units. Although several studies have demonstrated that the isolated ER and GR DNA binding domains are monomers in solution and undergo DNA dependent-dimerization after binding to their recognition sequences (4Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,18Dahlman-Wright K. Wright A. Gustafsson J. Carlstedt-Duke J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 3107-3112Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), most evidence supports the view that the full-length liganded ER, GR, and progesterone receptor dimerize in solution and bind to their response elements as dimers (reviewed in Ref. 19Glass C. Endocr. Rev. 1994; 15: 391-407PubMed Google Scholar). The recent observation that widely separated ERE half-sites can bind the ER and play a role in transcription activation (14Kato S. Tora L.

In the absence of any quantitative determination of the extent to which receptor dimerization results in enhanced binding to the hormone response element, there was no explanation of the advantage conferred on the receptor by dimerizing.One approach to evaluating the effect of dimerization on interaction of the ER with the ERE would be to compare ERE binding by wild-type ER and by an ER mutant unable to dimerize. Although several ER mutants that show impaired dimerization on translation in a rabbit reticulocyte lysate have been reported (20Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar), these mutants likely still retain some ability to dimerize in vivo. For example, one well characterized mutant in this group, L507R, retains significant ability to activate transcription from EREs (8Schodin D.J. Zhuang Y. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), and is therefore likely to exhibit significant dimerization in vivo. We therefore elected to investigate binding of the ER DNA binding domain to the ERE. The ER DBD has been shown unambiguously to be a monomer in solution (4Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,5Schwabe J.W.R. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Nature. 1990; 348: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), its interaction with the ERE has been described at high resolution (2Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar), and it is available in pure form.To artificially dimerize the ER DBD, we used a peptide linker related to those used in the production of single chain antibodies. Similar linkers have recently been used in a few studies of DNA-binding proteins (21Liang H. Sandberg W.S. Terwilliger T.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7010-7014Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar, 22Percipalle P. Simoncsits A. Zakhariev S. Guarnaccia C. Sanchez R. Pongor S.

Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In one such study, the possibility that a peptide linker very similar to the one we used enhanced DNA binding by altering the structure of the protein was explicitly examined (24Robinson C.R. Sauer R.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 109-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Fluorescence emission, circular dichroism, and DNase I and copper phenanthroline footprinting all indicated that the free arc repressor, and the arc repressor dimerized with a peptide linker had similar structures and interactions with DNA. Because none of these techniques could prove definitively that enhanced binding of the LD-DBD to the ERE was caused by dimerization and not by a linker-mediated structural change in the ER DBD, we also used a second entirely different antibody-based method to dimerize the ER DBD.Although it has been reported previously that antibodies to ER can enhance dimerization (20Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (483) Google Scholar, 25Nardulli A.M. Greene G.L. Shapiro D.J. Mol. Endocrinol. 1993; 7: 331-340Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), quantitative studies of the interaction of an antibody-dimerized protein with its recognition sequence have not been reported. To dimerize the ER DBD, we used a monoclonal antibody to a short epitope added to the N terminus of the DBD. The short N-terminal flag epitope did not alter DNA binding by the ER DBD as the flag-ER DBD and DBD from which the flag epitope was removed by thrombin digestion showed similar binding to the ERE in gel-shift assays. The position of the epitope recognized by the antibody does not appear to be critical for antibody-mediated dimerization to enhance binding to the ERE. In qualitative studies, we also observed a substantial enhancement of ERE binding using the Xenopus ER DBD and the monoclonal antibody p1A3, which appears to recognize an epitope in the hinge region of the Xenopus ER DBD (data not shown). Inasmuch as this region is poorly conserved, this antibody does not bind to the human ER DBD, necessitating use of the XenopusER DBD for these studies.In contrast to the LD-DBD, which will be a dimer independent of concentration, the antibody will only dimerize the DBD at the appropriate ratio of antibody and flag-DBD antigen. In practice, we found that the DBD bound to the ERE as an antibody-induced dimer across a wide range of antibody:DBD ratios (Fig. 3). One possible explanation for this is that when the antibody has dimerized the DBD, antibody-DBD complex binds rapidly to the consensus ERE (Fig. 5 B), and once bound the ERE may be stabilizing the antibody complex with two bound DBDs. Support for this idea comes from the data for the AbD-DBD bound to the non-consensus pS2 ERE. Qualitative assessment of the amount of probe up-shifted at the three antibody concentrations indicates more variation than was seen for the consensus ERE.Most available data indicate that the liganded full-length ER is a dimer in solution. However, the state of the DBDs in the solution dimer of ER is unknown. It is not clear whether the DBDs in the solution dimer of ER are linked to the rest of the protein through a conformationally flexible region (as has been proposed for nuclear receptors; Ref. 26Luisi B. Freedman L. Nature. 1995; 375: 359-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) and are therefore free to move independently, or are associated through the dimerization interface seen in the x-ray structure of two ER DBDs bound to the ERE. The observation that an ERE with a direct repeat of the ERE half-sites with 15 nucleotides between the half-sites bound the ER and activated transcription approximately one-third as well as the consensus ERE palindrome (15Kato S. Sasaki H. Suzawa M. Masushige S. Tora L. Chambon P. Gronemeyer H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 5858-5867Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) raised the possibility that the DBDs in the intact protein are not in a dimer interface but are free to rotate. To evaluate this question, we determined the effect of dimerization on binding of ER DBD to the consensus ERE palindrome with its 3 nucleotide spacer (PAL3) and to direct repeats (DR15) and everted repeats (EV15) with a 15-nucleotide spacer. Binding of LD-DBD to DR15 was inefficient, presumably because the short length of the linker required the introduction of an energetically unfavorable bend or kink in the DNA. In contrast, LD-DBD bound to EV15 with only about a 2.5-fold lower affinity than to PAL3 (Table I). Because the two DBD monomers are separated by an extra turn of the DNA helix and are in opposite orientation when bound to EV15, they are unlikely to form the DNA-dependent dimerization interface. The 2.5-fold difference in binding of LD-DBD to PAL3 and EV15 corresponds to a DBD dimerization energy of about 0.5 kcal/mol, which is approximately 4% of the 12 kcal/mol total energy of interaction of the full-length ER with the consensus ERE (which has been determined to have a dissociation constant of 2.0 ± 0.3 nm; Ref. 27Carlsson B. Haggblad J. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 232: 172-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). This relatively small contribution of DBD dimerization to the total binding energy implies that the DBDs in dimerized ER may be free to rotate and bind to functional EREs, which are not palindromes and do not have the familiar three-base pair spacing. Furthermore, our observation raises the possibility that widely spaced everted ERE half-sites may similarly function in vivo, although none have yet been reported.Table IDissociation constants for DBD construct and ERE probe combinationsERE probeDBD constructDissociation constant1-aThe K D values were calculated from the data presented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7.nmConsensus EREDBD160LD-DBD38AbD-DBD29EV15LD-DBD∼100pS2 nonconsensus EREDBDUndetectableLD-DBD110AbD-DBD∼2001-a The K D values were calculated from the data presented in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Open table in a new tab Our kinetics studies examine two possible mechanisms by which the ER may bind to the ERE. Binding of the ER to the ERE may occur by a sequential mechanism in which one DBD binds followed by binding of the second DBD. Because binding of a single DBD to an ERE half-site is strongly disfavored (28Green S. Chambon P. Parker M.G. Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Academic Press, New York1991: 15-38Google Scholar), the second DBD must bind to one ERE half-site before the first DBD has dissociated from the other half-site. Alternatively, the two DBDs may transiently dimerize in solution and then rapidly bind to the ERE as a unit. For either of these mechanisms, we would expect an increase in the on-rate in response to externally induced dimerization of the DBD, such as that brought about by sequences in the ligand binding domain. In the case of the sequential mechanism, this would be due to the dimerization-induced high local concentration of the second DBD once the first DBD was bound. In the transient dimerization model, only a small proportion of the DBD is a dimer at any one time and dimerizing all of the DBD via sequences in the ligand binding domain would increase the proportion of DBD in the ER-binding dimer form.We find that for the AbD-DBD binding is extremely rapid, even at 4 °C. However, the LD-DBD actually has a slower on-rate than the monomer DBD. This may be due to the linker interfering with binding or to the presence of the linker (which is attached near the outsides of the protein complex when bound to a consensus ERE) favoring a solution form of the linked DBD monomers in which the two DBDs are as far apart as possible and therefore have an orientation opposite to the orientation needed for binding.It is the rate of dissociation from the ERE (the off-rate) that is most strongly affected by dimerizing the DBD. If the ER DBD monomers bind and dissociate sequentially from the DBD, the DBD·ERE complex is stabilized by the relatively weak dimerization interface between the two monomers on the ERE, and the interaction of each monomer with a half-site. Because binding of the ER or the ER DBD to a single half-site is not favored (28Green S. Chambon P. Parker M.G. Nuclear Hormone Receptors. Academic Press, New York1991: 15-38Google Scholar), dissociation of one DBD monomer results in an unstable complex of one DBD and an ERE-half-site. In contrast, when the DBDs are dimerized, one DBD would maintain transient contact with an ERE half-site after the other monomer had dissociated. Dimerizing the DBD would greatly increase the local ER DBD concentration and the probability that the monomer that had dissociated would rebind to the free ERE half-site. This view is consistent with the data showing that dimerization produces a dramatic increase in binding to an imperfect ERE. When one half-site contains an imperfect ERE, as is found in the pS2 ERE, the energetic contribution due to binding of the single ERE monomer is insufficient for forming a stable complex and no binding is observed. The inability of a single ER DBD monomer to bind to a half-site under these conditions is illustrated by the smear (presumably due to a rapid dissociation of half-site complexes) observed when the pS2 ERE is incubated with extremely high levels of ER DBD. The absence of a complex of ER DBD on both half-sites of the pS2 ERE is consistent with our view that the dimerization interface between the ER DBDs bound to the ERE is relatively weak and cannot stabilize binding of the DBD to the imperfect half-site.Dimerizing the DBD produced a dramatic increase in binding to the non-consensus pS2 ERE, which differs from the ERE consensus sequence by only one nucleotide in one half-site. It was not possible to accurately quantitate the effect of dimerization on binding to the pS2 ERE, inasmuch as even at a concentration of 10,000 nm, the DBD monomer did not produce a discrete upshifted band in the gel mobility shift assay with the pS2 probe. At the highest concentrations used, there was some smearing near the probe alone band. Even if this smearing is considered to represent binding of the ER DBD to the ERE, the affinity of the dimerized DBDs is at least 25-fold higher than the affinity of the DBD monomer. This is a substantially larger effect than the 5–6-fold difference in binding seen with the consensus ERE palindrome. This suggests that dimerization stabilizes the interaction of the DBD with the imperfect ERE half-site. The imperfect pS2 ERE binds ER with only a 2–5-fold lower affinity than the consensus ERE (3Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar, 29Nardulli A.M. Romine L.E. Carpo C. Greene G.L. Rainish B. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 694-704PubMed Google Scholar). The striking effect of dimerization on binding to the pS2 ERE suggests that for both the pS2 ERE and for the many other EREs that exhibit larger deviations from the consensus sequence, ER dimerization is a prerequisite for efficient ER binding.In this work, we used two independent methods to quantitate the effect of dimerization on binding of the ER DBD to the ERE. Surprisingly, the major effect of dimerization was to stabilize the ER DBD·ERE complex rather than to increase the association rate. Our data support the view that, in the intact ER dimer, the DBDs can behave independently of each other. Most important, dimerization was required for binding to an imperfect naturally occurring ERE. These data support a model in which the ER must be dimerized to occupy both ERE half-sites in the imperfect EREs found in almost all ER-regulated genes. The intracellular actions of estrogens are mediated by the estrogen receptor. The estrogen receptor (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ER DBD, estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; AbD-DBD, antibody-dimerized estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; LD-DBD, linker-dimerized estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; PAL3, palindrome with 3 nucleotides between ERE half-sites; EV15, everted ERE with 15 nucleotides between half-sites; DR15, direct repeat of ERE half-sites separated by 15 nucleotides; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; ERE, estrogen response element. 1The abbreviations used are: ER, estrogen receptor; ER DBD, estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; AbD-DBD, antibody-dimerized estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; LD-DBD, linker-dimerized estrogen receptor DNA binding domain; PAL3, palindrome with 3 nucleotides between ERE half-sites; EV15, everted ERE with 15 nucleotides between half-sites; DR15, direct repeat of ERE half-sites separated by 15 nucleotides; PCR, polymerase chain reaction; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; ERE, estrogen response element. and other members of the steroid/nuclear receptor superfamily of transcription factors share a common domain structure with discrete regions of the receptors responsible for ligand binding, DNA binding, dimerization, nuclear localization, and transcription activation. Two estrogen receptor domains play a role in dimerization. A strong dimerization interface is located in the ligand binding domain of nuclear receptors (1White R. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). A weak dimerization interface is located in the DNA binding domain of steroid receptors (2Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar, 3Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). However, this interface is insufficient to induce solution dimerization, inasmuch as even at high protein concentrations the isolated recombinant ER DNA binding domain is a monomer in solution (4Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 24070-24076Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 5Schwabe J.W.R. Neuhaus D. Rhodes D. Nature. 1990; 348: 458-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). When two ER DBD monomers bind to the half-sites of an estrogen response element (ERE), a dimerization interface stabilizes binding of the DBD monomers to the response element (2Schwabe J.W.R. Chapman L. Finch J.T. Rhodes D. Cell. 1993; 75: 567-578Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (588) Google Scholar). We refer to this as ERE-dependent DBD dimerization. Although the ER DBD is a monomer in solution, in this work, we did not observe stable occupancy of only one of the two ERE half-sites by a single ER DBD. The ER DBD monomers on the ERE occupy both half-sites and are in the form of ERE-dimerized DBD. The DNA-dependent dimerization interface in the glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-DBD is sufficiently stable that it can alter binding of GR-DBD monomers to a glucocorticoid response element with an incorrect 4-base spacing (6Luisi B.F. Xu W.X. Otwinowski Z. Freedman L.P. Yamamoto K.R. Sigler P.B. Nature. 1991; 352: 497-505Crossref PubMed Scopus (1217) Google Scholar). It is widely, but not universally (7Murdoch F.E. Byrne L.M. Ariazi E.A. Furlow J.D. Meier D.A. Gorski J. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 9144-9150Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar), accepted that steroid receptors bind to their DNA recognition sequences as dimers. However, ligand binding domain-mediated dimerization is not always required for binding of steroid receptors to their hormone response elements. For example, the ER DBD monomer expressed in Escherichia coli binds to the ERE with a reduced but still significant affinity (3Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (956) Google Scholar). It has been widely assumed, but never actually demonstrated, that dimerization of steroid receptors increases their affinity for their DNA response elements. In this work, we address the effect of dimerization on the interaction of a steroid receptor with a hormone response element, and provide a biological rationale for receptor dimerization. Although ER mutants that are impaired in ligand binding domain dimerization have been reported (1White R. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), it appears that these mutants still exhibit some ability to dimerize (8Schodin D.J. Zhuang Y. Shapiro D.J. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 31163-31171Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). We therefore elected to use the ER DBD, which has been shown clearly to be a monomer in solution (4Nardulli A.M. Lew D. Erijman L. Shapiro D.J. J. Biol.

During B lymphocyte development in the bone marrow, a large number of B cells that are specific to a broad array of antigens are generated. This repertoire of B cells also includes a considerable proportion of B cells that recognize self-antigens. Elimination of such self-reactive B cells appears to occur at the immature B cell stage of development and is believed to be initiated as a result of interaction between B cell receptor (BCR) 1The abbreviations used are: BCR, B cell receptor; Ab, antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. 1The abbreviations used are: BCR, B cell receptor; Ab, antibody; GAPDH, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. and self-antigens (1Namazee D.A.

Apoptosis represents one of the major mechanisms by which self-reactive B cells are eliminated during B cell development (4Krammer P.H. Behrmann I. Daniel P. Dhein J. Debatin K.M. Curr. Opin.

In contrast to immature B cells, engagement of the BCR induces mature B cells to proliferate and differentiate into memory cells and antibody-producing cells (5Gold M.R. DeFranco A.L. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 221-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). The diverse responses initiated by the BCR in the B cells of different maturation stages do not appear to be due to differences in the architecture of the BCR itself (1Namazee D.A. Burki K. Nature. 1989; 337: 562-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (855) Google Scholar, 2Hartley S.B. Crosbie J. Brink R. Kantor A.A. Basten A. Goddnow C.C.

Consistent with this, signaling through the BCR induces a number of early biochemical events, such as the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases and protein kinase C isoenzymes, which have been found to be nearly identical in immature and mature B cells (5Gold M.R. DeFranco A.L. Adv. Immunol. 1994; 55: 221-295Crossref PubMed Scopus (117) Google Scholar). Recent studies found that the later downstream events that affect G1/S transition, such as the activities of cyclin E and cdk2 were increased in mature but not immature B cells (6Carman J.A. Wechsler-Reya R.J. Monroe J.G. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 4562-4569PubMed Google Scholar). Unlike these late events, thus far, very few early biochemical changes that are unique to growth versus apoptosis response of B cells have been identified. Expression of Egr-1, an immediate early gene, has been reported to be increased in mature B cells triggered via BCR to proliferate (7Monroe J.G. Yellen-Shaw A.G. Seyfert V.L. Adv. Mol. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 1B: 1-32Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated the importance of this gene for growth and apoptosis response of immature B cells using a lymphoma model. The immediate early gene, Egr-1 encodes a nuclear protein that is a prototypic member of a family of transcription factors (8Cao X.M. Koski R.A. Gashler A. McKiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R.

Recently, EGR-1 has been shown to regulate transcription of ICAM-I and CD44 molecules in B lymphocytes (25Maltzman J.S. Carman J.A. Monroe J.G. J. Exp.

Signaling through BCR induced a rapid Egr-1 expression in mature splenic B cells, which was found to be a protein kinase C-dependent event (7Monroe J.G. Yellen-Shaw A.G. Seyfert V.L. Adv. Mol. Cell. Immunol. 1993; 1B: 1-32Google Scholar, 19Gashler A.L. Sukhatme V.P. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 1995; 50: 191-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (555) Google Scholar, 27Seyfert V.L. McMahon W.

Studies withEgr-1-specific antisense oligonucleotides have demonstrated that induction of Egr-1 is necessary for antigen receptor-mediated activation of B and T lymphocytes (7Monroe J.G.

However, in contrast to mature B cells, anti-IgM stimulation failed to induceEgr-1 expression in immature B cells (7Monroe J.G. Yellen-Shaw A.G. Seyfert V.L. Adv. Mol. Cell.

Thus, the major difference observed between mature and immature B cells in response to antigen receptor-mediated signaling appears to be the variation in expression of Egr-1.

Therefore, studies were undertaken to examine the role of Egr-1expression in anti-IgM-induced negative growth response in BKS-2, an immature B lymphoma cell line (31Muthukkumar S. Udhayakumar V. Bondada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Muthukkumar S. Bondada S. Int.

Immunopathol. 1989; 51: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). We have shown previously that BKS-2 cells undergo growth inhibition and apoptosis in response to signals transduced by BCR cross-linking as well as by ionomycin (31Muthukkumar S. Udhayakumar V. Bondada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar,32Muthukkumar S. Bondada S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 7: 305-315Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). This growth inhibition in BKS-2 cells was abrogated by T helper cell contact-mediated signals (32Muthukkumar S. Bondada S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 7: 305-315Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar). Rapamycin, a potent immunosuppressive drug, has also been shown to cause apoptosis in BKS-2 cells (33Muthukkumar S. Ramesh T.M. Bondada S. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar). In the present study, we report that BKS-2 cells constitutively express high levels of Egr-1 mRNA, which are down-regulated upon signaling through BCR. BlockingEgr-1 expression by antisense oligonucleotides caused apoptosis in BKS-2 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate thatEgr-1 mRNA expression is up-regulated in 1.B5, a mutant BKS-2 cell line that is refractory to BCR-mediated growth inhibitory signals. Isolation and characterization of BKS-2 lymphoma has been described elsewhere (35Udhayakumar V. Brodeur P.H. Rajagopalan M.S. Zimmer S. Pollack K. Subbarao B. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1989; 51: 240-251Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). This lymphoma originated in a CBA/N mouse transferred with spleen cells from aged CBA/Ca mice. The characteristics of BKS-2 cells are similar to immature B cells in that they express high levels of IgM but have very little or no IgD. BKS-2 cells are monoclonal in origin and are grown in CBA/N mice or SCID mice as splenic tumor by serial intravenous injections. These cells attain maximal growth (4–6 × 108) in about 7–10 days and are collected for experimental use at this stage. BKS-2 cells from CBA/N or SCID hosts behave similarly (31Muthukkumar S. Udhayakumar V. Bondada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 32Muthukkumar S. Bondada S. Int. Immunol. 1994; 7: 305-315Crossref Scopus (12) Google Scholar, 33Muthukkumar S. Ramesh T.M. Bondada S. Transplantation. 1995; 60: 264-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar), and cells from the former were used in most experiments. Depletion of host residual T cells was performed as described previously (31Muthukkumar S. Udhayakumar V. Bondada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). 1.B5 is one of the several clones of ethylmethanesulfonic acid-mutagenized BKS-2 cells selected by their resistance to anti-IgM-induced growth inhibition. Briefly, 40 × 106BKS-2 lymphoma cells were treated with 300 μg/ml ethylmethanesulfonate for 24 h. Then, the lymphoma cells were washed and recultured for 2–3 days in IF-12 medium until there were visible signs of growth and were subjected to selective conditions by requiring them to grow in the presence of PMA or anti-μ. The anti-μ-resistant cells were cloned by limiting dilution in 96-well plates using T cell-derived supernatants to augment growth under low cell density conditions. The expression of surface IgM and several other B cell surface molecules such as class I, class II, FcR, CD19, CD22, CD45RB, CD5, and CD72 were similar in the mutant 1.B5 and the wild type BKS-2 cells. 2Muthukkumar, S., Venkataraman, C., Woods, T., and Bondada, S., Mol. Immunol., in press. Like the wild type BKS-2, the mutant 1.B5 cells were also susceptible to growth inhibition by rapamycin as well as ionomycin. Spleen cells were obtained from 8–10-week-old DBA/2 mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME). T cells were depleted by treatment with a mixture of anti-T cell antibodies and complement as described above. Depletion of T cells was verified by flow cytometry and by 99% depletion of response to the T cell mitogen, concanavalin A. The characteristics of the monoclonal rat anti-mouse μ chain Ab, AK11, have been described previously (34Udhayakumar V. Kumar L. Subbarao B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 4120-4129PubMed Google Scholar, 36Leptin M. Eur. J. Immunol. 1985; 15: 131-137Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This hybridoma cell line obtained from Dr. R. Noelle (Dartmouth Medical School, Hanover, NH), was grown in vitro, and the culture supernatant was affinity-purified by passing through a column containing mouse IgM protein (HPCM2, a hybridoma from BALB/c origin) coupled to agarose beads (Bio-Rad) (34Udhayakumar V. Kumar L. Subbarao B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 4120-4129PubMed Google Scholar). AK11 monoclonal Ab was coupled to CNBr-Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) and was resuspended at a concentration of 10% in 0.85% saline (34Udhayakumar V. Kumar L. Subbarao B. J. Immunol. 1991; 146: 4120-4129PubMed Google Scholar). This suspension was used in cultures at a final concentration of 0.5% or 1.0%. S4B6, a rat monoclonal Ab (IgG2a) specific for IL-2, was used as a control Ab. In experiments aimed at blocking Egr-1 expression, we used a phosphorothioate-capped antisense Egr-1 oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-GsCsGGGGTGCAGGGGCACAsCsT-3′) and a control phosphorothioate-capped nonsense oligodeoxynucleotide (5′-CsGsCCGCACCACCGCGAGTsCsA-3′) purchased from the Regional DNA Synthesis Laboratory, Calgary, Alberta, Canada. The phosphorothioate oligomers 1d and 3Db containing CpG motifs described by Krieg et al. (37Krieg A.M. Yi A.-K. Matson S. Waldschmidt T.J. Bishop G.A. Teasdale R. Koretzky G.A. Klinman D.M. Nature. 1996; 374: 546-549Crossref Scopus (3078) Google Scholar) were also obtained from the Regional DNA Synthesis Laboratory. The CD72 and the Gsα-specific oligomers were obtained from Genosys Biotechnologies (The Woodlands, TX). Isolation of total RNA by the guanidium isothiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method and Northern analysis were performed as described previously (38Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (63088) Google Scholar, 39Rangnekar V.V. Waheed S. Davies T.J. Toback F.J. Rangnekar V.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2415-2422Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The probe forEgr-1 was prepared with a 3.1-kilobase cDNA fragment from pCMV-EGR-1 (40Maden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A.G. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (407) Google Scholar). Prehybridization and hybridization were done overnight at 62 °C, and the blots were washed to a final stringency of 0.1 × SSC (15 mm NaCl, 1.5 mmsodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 62 °C before autoradiography as described previously (41Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Equal loading of RNA was verified by probing blots with cDNA for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). EGR-1-positive BKS-2 cells were detected by immunocytochemistry as described (41Sells S.F. Muthukkumar S. Sukhatme V.P. Crist S.A. Rangnekar V.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 682-692Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were exposed to control or anti-IgM Ab for 24 or 48 h as indicated and subjected to immunocytochemistry with anti-EGR-1 Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, Santa Cruz, CA). Reactions with biotinylated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin Ab and avidin-biotin-peroxidase complexes and staining with diaminobenzidine-H2O2 were sequentially performed as described in the Vectastain Elite ABC kit instruction manual (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). To enable black and white photography of images, counterstaining with methyl green was omitted. BKS-2 cells (1 × 107/ml) were cultured with anti-IgM Ab, AK11 (10 μg/ml) or control Ab (S4B6) for 24 h. After stimulation, cells were pelleted, washed, and solubilized in 100 μl of lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.6, 150 mmNaCl, 10 mm NaF, 1 mmNa3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 2 μg/ml aprotinin) on ice for 30 min. The detergent-insoluble materials were removed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C. Protein extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose beads for 1 h at 4 °C, following which anti-EGR-1 Ab (Santa Cruz) was added and further incubated for 6 h at 4 °C. The immune complexes were collected on protein A-Sepharose beads by an additional 4 h incubation. The beads were separated by centrifugation and washed extensively with 1.5 m NaCl and followed by 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, before resuspending in SDS-PAGE sample buffer. Proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The resolved proteins were transferred onto Immobilon-P nitrocellulose membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA) in a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 20% methanol, pH 9.0, at 90 V for 1 h. Prestained protein standards (Bio-Rad) were included to indicate the molecular weight range and to verify transfer of proteins. After blocking in 5% milk powder in TBST (50 mm Tris, 200 mm NaCl, pH 7.4, 0.05% Tween 20) for 2 h, the nitrocellulose membranes were incubated with anti-EGR-1 Ab for overnight followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit Ab (Santa Cruz, CA) for additional 2 h. The blots were then developed with an enhanced chemiluminescence kit (NEN Life Science Products) according to manufacturer's instructions. Proliferation of cells was assessed by tritiated thymidine uptake. Lymphoma cells (2 × 104/well) or splenic B cells (2 × 105) were cultured in 96-well flat bottom microtiter plates (Costar, Cambridge, MA) in 0.2 ml of 1:1 mixture of Iscove's and Ham's F12 (IF-12) medium containing supplements and 5% heat-inactivated FCS as described previously (31Muthukkumar S. Udhayakumar V. Bondada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Cultures were incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO2 for a total of 48 h and were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine (specific activity 2 Ci/mmol; NEN Life Science Products) during the last 4-h culture period. The cultures were harvested onto glass fiber filters using a Packard 96-well harvester, and [3H]thymidine incorporation was determined by a Matrix-96 β counter (Packard, Downers Grove, IL). BKS-2 cells were stained for apoptosis as described previously (42Bikah G. Carey J. Ciallella J.R. Tarakhovsky A. Bondada S. Science. 1996; 274: 1906-1909Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar, 43Reid S. Cross R. Snow E.C. J. Immunol. Methods. 1996; 192: 43-54Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, cells treated with and without anti-IgM (5 μg/ml) for 24 or 48 h were resuspended at 1 × 106/ml in PBS. Hoechst 33342 was added at 5 μg/ml, and the cells were incubated in dark for 30 min at 37 °C. Excess of dye was removed by centrifugation, and cells were incubated with Merocyanine 540 (MC 540) (2 μg/ml) for 20 min at room temperature in dark. After washing the excess of dye in PBS, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACSTAR flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, CA). Gates were set to analyze cell cycle and apoptosis stages. Hoechst 33342 is a DNA-specific dye that measures the amount of DNA, while MC540 binds to the inner membrane phospholipids that become exposed during early stages of apoptosis. This method of staining distinguishes five different stages of cells. They are R1: viable resting cells, 2n DNA and MC540 dull; R2: viable cycling cells, >2n and MC540 dull; R3: resting cells undergoing apoptosis, 2n and MC540 bright; R4: cycling cells undergoing apoptosis, >2n and MC540 bright; and R5: cells that moved into later stages of apoptosis as they become Hoechst 33342 dull. We have shown previously that signaling through BCR using anti-IgM Ab causes apoptosis in BKS-2 lymphoma cells (31Muthukkumar S. Udhayakumar V. Bondada S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1993; 23: 2419-2426Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). To examine whether this signal alters the expression of Egr-1, Northern analysis was performed using total RNA isolated from BKS-2 cells stimulated with anti-IgM Ab for various periods of time. As shown in Fig. 1, a high level of constitutive expression of Egr-1 was observed in BKS-2 cells (lane 1). A strong reduction in the level of Egr-1 mRNA was noticed as early as 30 min after exposure to anti-IgM Ab (lane 2). A continued reduction in the level ofEgr-1 message was evident in cells treated with anti-IgM Ab for 1 and 3 h. At 24 h after anti-IgM treatment,Egr-1 expression was barely detectable in BKS-2 cells (lane 5). Probing for GAPDH message demonstrated equal loading of RNA in all five lanes. These results suggest a correlation between down-regulation of Egr-1 gene expression and the pathway leading to apoptosis in response to signaling via BCR in BKS-2 cells. To elucidate whether expression of EGR-1 protein is correlated with the reduction of its mRNA in anti-IgM-treated cells, we performed immunocytochemical analysis as a method to test the level of EGR-1 protein expression. Additionally, we initiated studies with Egr-1-specific antisense oligonucleotides to directly evaluate the relation between the reduction in Egr-1 levels and anti-μ-induced growth inhibition. Immunocytochemical analysis was performed to determine the effectiveness of the oligonucleotide treatment on the protein expression. The BKS-2 cells were treated with control Ig, anti-IgM Ab, nonsense, or antisense oligomers toEgr-1 for 24 h. Then the cells were stained with anti-EGR-1 Ab as described under “Materials and Methods.” As shown in Fig. 2 (A andC), most of the BKS-2 cells were EGR-1-positive after nonsense oligomer or control antibody treatment. On the other hand, a large number of BKS-2 cells that were stimulated with anti-IgM Ab failed to express EGR-1 (Fig. 2 D), demonstrating that the reduction in Egr-1 message seen in Fig. 1 is accompanied by a decrease in the protein. The treatment with antisense oligomers for 24 h was also effective in reducing the number of BKS-2 cells expressing the EGR-1 protein (Fig. 2 B). To further confirm the down-regulation of EGR-1 protein in response to signaling through BCR, we also performed Western blot analysis on protein extracts from BKS-2 cells treated with anti-IgM or control Ig. As shown in Fig. 3, control Ig-treated BKS-2 cells expressed a high level of EGR-1 protein, which corresponds to the approximate molecular weight of 82 kDa (lane 1). In contrast, a strong reduction in the levels of EGR-1 protein was observed in the cells that were stimulated with anti-IgM (lane 2). Densitometry analysis showed a more than 3-fold reduction in the level of EGR-1 protein in the cells that are stimulated with anti-IgM. The integrated optical density values for EGR-1 protein in control Ig and anti-IgM-treated BKS-2 cells were 7.83 and 2.07, respectively. The molecular weight of EGR-1 protein is consistent with that reported in other cell types (8Cao X.M. Koski R.A. Gashler A. McKiernan M. Morris C.F. Gaffney R. Hay R.V. Sukhatme V.P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1990; 10: 1931-1939Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). The band seen below the EGR-1 protein is Ig heavy chain, and its intensity was not altered by either control Ig or anti-IgM treatment. Similar intensities of heavy chain band in both lanes also point to"
https://openalex.org/W2041126130,"We previously identified ZNF74 as a developmentally expressed gene commonly deleted in DiGeorge syndrome.ZNF74 encodes an RNA-binding protein tightly associated with the nuclear matrix and belongs to a large subfamily of Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins containing a KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) repressor motif. We now report on the multifunctionality of the zinc finger domain of ZNF74. This nucleic acid binding domain is shown here to function as a nuclear matrix targeting sequence and to be involved in protein-protein interaction. By far-Western analysis and coimmunoprecipitation studies, we demonstrate that ZNF74 interacts, via its zinc finger domain, with the hyperphosphorylated largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol IIo) but not with the hypophosphorylated form. The importance of the phosphorylation in this interaction is supported by the observation that phosphatase treatment inhibits ZNF74 binding. Double immunofluorescence experiments indicate that ZNF74 colocalizes with the pol IIo and the SC35 splicing factor in irregularly shaped subnuclear domains. Thus, ZNF74 sublocalization in nuclear domains enriched in pre-mRNA maturating factors, its RNA binding activity, and its direct phosphodependent interaction with the pol IIo, a form of the RNA polymerase functionally associated with pre- mRNA processing, suggest a role for this member of the KRAB multifinger protein family in RNA processing.

Zinc finger proteins of the TFIIIA/Kruppel type belong to the largest known family of transcription factors (1Pieler T. Bellefroid E. Mol. Biol.

These proteins are characterized by Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs often repeated in tandem that fold around zinc ions and function as nucleic acid binding domains (3Pavletich N.P. Pabo C.O.

About one-third of mammalian Cys2-His2 zinc finger proteins contain a conserved domain of approximately 75 amino acids called KRAB (Kruppel-associated box) (7Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (345) Google Scholar). The KRAB domain, located at the N terminus of Cys2-His2 multifinger proteins, can confer strong distance-independent transcriptional repression of both activated and basal RNA polymerase II promoter activity (8Margolin J.F.

Since they encode a repression motif and a potential DNA binding domain, members from the large KRAB/Cys2-His2 protein family are presently thought to function as transcriptional regulators of gene expression. We previously cloned ZNF74, a gene that encodes a KRAB/Cys2-His2 protein (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). ZNF74lies a few kilobases proximal to a polymorphic CA repeat (D22S264) (16Marineau C. Aubry M. Julien J.P. Rouleau G.A. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1430Google Scholar) that was shown to be a distal marker for 22q11.2 deletions associated with increased susceptibility to schizophrenia (17Karayiorgou M.

Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 7612-7616Crossref PubMed Scopus (545) Google Scholar). ZNF74is also one of the few genes found hemizygously deleted in the majority of patients with the DiGeorge syndrome, a microdeletion disorder associated with a wide variety of congenital malformations including cardiac defects, thymic hypoplasia, and hypocalcemia (18Aubry M.

Aikem M. Aurias A. Julien J.P. Rouleau G.A. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1993; 2: 1583-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar) and its biochemical and cellular functions remain unclear. Although the presence of a KRAB motif and of 12 Cys2-His2 zinc finger motifs suggest that ZNF74 may function as a transcription factor, we recently demonstrated that its zinc finger domain harbors an RNA binding activity in vitro (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). This result suggests that, in addition to its potential function in transcriptional regulation, ZNF74 may also be involved in RNA metabolism. We also previously reported that ZNF74 is tightly associated with the nuclear matrix, since detergent, DNase, RNase, and high salt treatments could not release it from this nuclear scaffold structure (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In this study, we report that the ZNF74 zinc finger domain acts as a nuclear matrix targeting sequence. Furthermore, to further define ZNF74 function, we searched for proteins from the nuclear matrix that directly interact with ZNF74. We now show that ZNF74 interacts, via its multifinger domain, with a hyperphosphorylated form of the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (pol IIo) and colocalizes with this protein in irregularly shaped subnuclear domains. Because the hyperphosphorylated form of this RNA pol II 1The abbreviations used are: pol, polymerase; HA, hemagglutinin; MBP, maltose-binding protein; aa, amino acids; mAb, monoclonal antibody; CTD, carboxyl-terminal domain; snRNP, small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; PMSF, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; Pipes, 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid; PAGE, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PBS, phosphate-buffered saline; LS, largest subunit; SR protein family, family of proteins rich in serines and arginines. subunit has been shown to colocalize (21Bregman D.B.

The following constructs were previously described in Grondin et al. (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar): HA-ZNF74-(1–572), HA-ZNF74ΔKrab-(68–572), HA-NΔKrab-Zn-(68–509), HA-Zn-C-(175–572), HA-Zn-(175–509), MBP-ZNF74-(1–572), MBP-ZNF74-(106–572), MBP-Zn-(175–509), and MBP-β-gal-α (also called MBP herein). GAL4 DNA binding domain (GAL4-(1–147)) fusion proteins were obtained by introducing either the zinc finger domain (aa 175–509) or the N-terminal domain (aa 1–174) of ZNF74 in a Rous sarcoma virus enhancer-driven eukaryotic expression vector pRSVGAL4 (kindly provided by Dr. Robert Rehfuss). The zinc finger domain (aa 175–509) or the N-terminal domain (aa 1–174) of ZNF74 were PCR-amplified with oligonucleotide primers containing XbaI cloning sites. In each case, the 3′-primer included an in frame stop codon. The PCR-amplified products were subcloned in frame at the 3′-end of the GAL4 DNA binding domain in a unique XbaI site of the pRSVGAL4 vector. The mAb CC3 (IgG2a) was previously obtained by immunizing Balb/C mice with chick embryo proteins (29Thibodeau A. Vincent M. Exp. Cell Res. 1991; 195: 145-153Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar) and shown to recognize a phosphoepitope located on the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of the hyperphosphorylated RNA polymerase II largest subunit (pol IIo) (23Vincent M.

The mouse hybridoma cell line CRL 2031, secreting the mAb SC35 (IgG1), was purchased from the American Type Culture Collection. The mAb SC35 recognizes a phosphorylated form of SC35 (32Fu X.D. Maniatis T. Nature. 1990; 343: 437-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (571) Google Scholar), a non-snRNP splicing protein, and possibly another structural protein that colocalizes to the same nuclear domains (33Xing Y.

The GAL4 (DBD) mouse monoclonal IgG antibody (RK5C1) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect the DNA binding domain (aa 1–147) of GAL4 protein. A rabbit anti-MBP polyclonal antiserum (New England Biolabs) was used to detect the maltose-binding protein. The mAb 131C1 (kindly provided by Dr. Yves Raymond) was used to detect lamin A and C. Monkey fibroblast-like COS-7 cells, mouse skin fibroblast L cells, mouse embryonal carcinoma P19 cells, human embryonal kidney HEK 293 cells, or 293T cells (35Pear W.S. Nolan G.P. Scott M.L. Baltimore D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8392-8396Crossref PubMed Scopus (2305) Google Scholar) were used to prepare the various cellular fractions. For experiments requiring transfection, cells were plated at a cell density of 4–8 × 105/100-mm plate, transfected 24 h later with various plasmid constructs (25 μg of DNA) (36Colbere-Garapin F. Garapin A.C. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1983; 55: 267-271PubMed Google Scholar), and harvested 30–36 h after transfection (3–6 × 106cells obtained from a 100-mm plate). For cellular fractionation and nuclear matrix isolation, transfected or untransfected cells (3–6 × 106 cells) were first submitted to a hypotonic lysis in 40 μl of RSB buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 10 mm NaCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm PMSF), and nuclei were recovered following essentially the method of Cockerill and Garrard (37Cockerill P.N. Garrard W.T. Cell. 1986; 44: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (744) Google Scholar) as described previously (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Washed nuclei were subjected to subnuclear fractionation and nuclear matrix isolation using the method of He et al. (38He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar) as previously detailed (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). In brief, the nuclei derived from a 100-mm plate were freed of the chromatin by a 50-min digestion at 30 °C with RNase-free DNase I (about 20 units/106 cell nuclei) (Life Technologies, Inc.) in 40 μl of digestion buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 50 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 1.2 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 μg/ml pepstatin A), and then extracted by the addition of 1 m ammonium sulfate to a final concentration of 0.25 m. The 750 ×g supernatant containing digested chromatin corresponds to the soluble DNase I-treated nuclear fraction also called soluble nuclear fraction herein. The pellet was then submitted to an additional extraction with 50 μl of digestion buffer containing 2 mNaCl. The subsequent 750 × g pellet corresponding to insoluble nuclear matrix and associated ribonucleoproteins was subjected to RNase A (Quiagen) and RNase T (Boehringer Mannheim) (5 μg and 2 units, respectively) in 50 μl of digestion buffer. The resulting 750 × g pellet corresponds to the RNase-treated insoluble nuclear matrix fraction. To prepare the various nuclear fractions used in far-Western analysis, 2 mmorthovanadate was also included in the RSB buffer, and both 2 mm orthovanadate and 50 mm NaF were added to the digestion buffer. Furthermore, in some cases as indicated in the figure legends, a faster cell fractionation scheme was used to limit protein dephosphorylation by endogenous phosphatases; the centrifugation steps were reduced to 15 s at 15,000 ×g, the chromatin was digested for only 25 min with twice the amount of DNase I, and the RNase A and T digestion step was omitted. Before immunoprecipitations, the soluble DNase I-treated fractions (equivalent to 20–40 × 106cells/350 μl of digestion buffer) obtained as described under “Cellular Fractionation and Nuclear Matrix Isolation” were diluted with 2 volumes of lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm orthovanadate, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). To prepare nuclear matrix extracts for immunoprecipitations, the DNase/RNase-digested nuclear matrix pellets (from about 10–20 × 106 cells) obtained as described under “Cellular Fractionation and Nuclear Matrix Isolation” were extracted with 500 μl of SDS solubilizing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.8% SDS, 2 mm orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF) for 4 min at 95 °C (39Brancolini C. Schneider C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6936-6940Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar). The extracts were cooled at 4 °C for 4 min before adding 500 μl of Triton buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 4% Triton X-100, 2 mm orthovanadate, 50 mm NaF) and then centrifuged at 15,000 × g for 2 min at 4 °C. To prepare total cell extracts (5–10 × 106 cells/ml) for immunoprecipitations, cells were either extracted in SDS solubilizing buffer and diluted in Triton buffer as described above or extracted in lysis buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 250 mm NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm orthovanadate, 50 mmNaF, 1 mm PMSF, 2 μg/ml aprotinin, 2 μg/ml leupeptin). The extracts were passed through a 26G1/2 needle to reduce viscosity before centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Total cell, nuclear matrix, and diluted soluble DNase I-treated extracts were precleared with protein A-Sepharose (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. Precleared extracts were then recovered after removal of the beads by centrifugation (1 ml/20 μl stacked protein A beads). Immunoprecipitations were then carried out for 2 h at 4 °C (or 16 h for coimmunoprecipitation experiments) using 1 ml of precleared extracts, 10–50 μl of the appropriate antibody, and 30 μl of protein A-Sepharose. For the coimmunoprecipitation experiments, 10 mm EDTA and 10 mm EGTA were added during the preclearing and the immunoprecipitation steps to stabilize the pol IIo (40Kim W.-Y. Dahmus M.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 14219-14225Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The protein A-Sepharose beads were then washed 3 times either with 1 ml of lysis buffer for immunoprecipitations or with a buffer containing 25 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 0.2% SDS, and 1% Triton for coimmunoprecipitations. Washed immunoprecipitates were resuspended in Laemmli buffer, and the recovered proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. In some cases, the supernatants of immunoprecipitation were first concentrated using Microcon 100 filter devices (Amicon) before dilution in Laemmli buffer. E. coli DH5α strain transformed with pMal-c-ZNF74 fusion constructs were grown to anA 600 of 0.3–0.5 (500 ml) and induced with 0.3 mm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h. Crude soluble extracts containing the soluble MBP fusion proteins were prepared from bacterial cells resuspended in column buffer (200 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 10 mm β-mercaptoethanol) (50 ml). MBP fusion proteins from these extracts were immobilized on amylose resin (0.5 ml) (New England Biolabs). The resin was washed with 20 volumes of column buffer and with 40 volumes of elution buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl). Then, the immobilized MBP fusion proteins were eluted with 1.5 ml of elution buffer containing 10 mmmaltose. Depending on the preparation and on the fusion proteins, 100–1000 μg of eluted affinity-purified proteins were recovered as estimated by a Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) and as confirmed by Coomassie gel staining. The purified proteins were aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. Proteins were biotinylated according to Cicchetti and Baltimore (41Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 256: 140-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In brief, the MBP-ZNF74-(106–572) fusion protein eluted from the amylose resin was dialyzed against a borate buffer (100 mm, pH 8.0). The protein was incubated for 4 h at room temperature with biotinamidocaproateN-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Sigma) at a concentration of 50 μg of the biotin derivative for 1 mg of MBP-ZNF74-(106–572) fusion protein. The reaction was stopped by adding 1 mNH4Cl at a ratio of 4 μl for 50 μg of biotin derivative for 10 min at room temperature. The biotinylated protein was then dialyzed against a 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, buffer containing 100 mm NaCl. Glycerol (final concentration 15%) was added to the dialyzed biotinylated protein before its storage at −20 °C. Thawed biotinylated proteins (1.5 μg/μl) were never kept longer than 2 weeks at 4 °C before use. Nuclear protein fractions or proteins immunoprecipitated from cell or nuclear extracts were resolved by SDS-PAGE on a 6% separating gel and electrophoretically transferred to 0.2-μm nitrocellulose membrane at 22 V for 12–16 h using a Mini Trans-Blot® electrophoretic transfer cell (Bio-Rad). After transfer, the blots were rinsed in TBST buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and used immediately or kept at 4 °C in the same buffer for a few days. The blots were incubated for 4–16 h in blocking buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl, 2% bovine serum albumin). For far-Western analysis, the blots (9-cm2 strips) were probed for 12–16 h with affinity-purified MBP fusion proteins (0.5 μg/ml) or with biotinylated MBP-ZNF74-(106–572) fusion proteins (30 ng/ml) in overlay buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 mmNaCl, 1 mm EGTA, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% bovine serum albumin, 0.25% gelatin) (2 ml). For competition experiments, the blots were incubated in the presence of the biotinylated MBP fusion protein and a 100-fold excess of unbiotinylated MBP fusion protein. All the above steps were performed at 4 °C. The blots were then washed in washing buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 150 mmNaCl, 0.05% Tween 20, 0.2% gelatin) three times for 5 min at room temperature and then incubated for 1 h in TBST buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin. Bound MBP fusion proteins were revealed by sequential incubation with a rabbit primary anti-MBP polyclonal antiserum (New England Biolabs), a secondary goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), and a chemiluminescence reagent as described by the manufacturer (Renaissance® kit, NEN Life Science Products). Bound biotinylated MBP-ZNF74 fusion proteins were also revealed by chemiluminescence after an incubation step with avidin-horseradish peroxidase (Sigma). This protocol was modified from Bregman et al. (22Bregman D.B. Du L. Van der Zee S. Warren S.L. J. Cell Biol. 1995; 129: 287-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Proteins were immunoprecipitated as above with mAb CC3 coupled to protein A-Sepharose. For alkaline phosphatase treatment, the beads were washed with phosphatase buffer (10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 10 mm magnesium acetate, 50 mmpotassium acetate) and treated with or without 5 units of calf intestinal phosphatase (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) in 25 μl (excluding bed volume) of phosphatase buffer for 10–60 min at 37 °C. The beads were resuspended in Laemmli buffer for analysis of the eluted proteins by SDS-PAGE. Subconfluent monkey COS-7 cells plated in 1 × 2-cm four-well Lab-Tek™ (Nunc) were transfected with appropriate plasmid constructs (2 μg) (36Colbere-Garapin F. Garapin A.C. Dev. Biol. Stand. 1983; 55: 267-271PubMed Google Scholar). About 40 h after transfection, the cells were either fixed and processed directly for immunofluorescence when indicated or first extracted in situas described by Bisotto et al. (42Bisotto S. Lauriault P. Duval M. Vincent M. J. Cell Sci. 1995; 108: 1873-1882PubMed Google Scholar) using the method of Heet al. (38He D.C. Nickerson J.A. Penman S. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 569-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (369) Google Scholar). Briefly, for in situ sequential extraction, the cells were first washed in isotonic phosphate saline buffer (PBS buffer) and then extracted in cytoskeleton buffer (10 mm Pipes, pH 6.8, 100 mm NaCl, 300 mm sucrose, 3 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 0.5% Triton X-100, 1 mm PMSF), digested with DNase I (Life Technologies), and washed with 0.25m ammonium sulfate for chromatin removal. When indicated, the transfected cells were also subjected to a high salt extraction with 2 m NaCl and an RNase A and T digestion. For immunofluorescence microscopy, untreated or in situextracted cells were treated sequentially at room temperature with 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 1 h, with 0.2% Tween-20, 4% formaldehyde/PBS for 1 h, with 50 mmNH4Cl/PBS for 30 min and with 0.2% cold fish gelatin (Sigma)/PBS for 30 min (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Primary and secondary antibody incubations were then performed essentially as described (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol.

For single immunolabeling, the mouse mAb 12CA5 (hybridoma supernatant diluted 1:500) was used as a primary antibody to detect HA epitope-tagged ZNF74 proteins, and a mouse anti-Gal 4 antibody (1:50) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to detect GAL4 proteins. A rabbit anti-mouse IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) was used as a secondary antibody. For double immunolabeling of HA-ZNF74-(1–572) and pol IIo/CC3 antigen, a rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (diluted 1:200) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and the mouse mAb CC3 antibody (ascitic fluid diluted 1:500) were sequentially added. For immunolabeling of both HA-ZNF74-(1–572) and SC35 antigen, the rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody and the mouse mAb SC35 (ascitic fluid diluted 1:200) were used as primary antibodies. A goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to fluorescein isothiocyanate (Sigma) and a goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Rhodamine (Pierce) were then used as secondary antibodies. The specificity of each of the secondary antibodies was tested either by omitting one of the primary antibodies or by incubating the primary antibody individually with each of the secondary antibodies. No cross-reaction was observed between the two sets of antibodies. DNA was stained by a 5-min treatment with 2.5 μg/ml Hoechst 33258 fluorochrome (Sigma). Preparations were examined under a Leika photomicroscope equipped for epifluorescence and photographed using NEOPAN 1600 (Fuji) or EPL 400 (Kodak) films. We previously reported that the protein encoded by ZNF74–2 cDNA (EMBL accession number X92715), called ZNF74 here, is an RNA-binding protein tightly associated with the nuclear matrix (15Grondin B.

To delimit the region required for ZNF74 association with the nuclear matrix, we assessed the subnuclear localization of various HA-tagged deletion mutants in transfected cells. Following subcellular fractionation of transfected L cells, all truncated ZNF74 proteins that included at least the zinc finger domain were found associated with the insoluble nuclear matrix fraction as assessed by immunoblot (Fig.1 A). As previously observed for the full-length protein (15Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the attachment of all of these truncated ZNF74 proteins to the nuclear matrix was very tight, since none were detectable in the soluble nuclear fractions recovered after sequential DNase, high salt, and RNase treatments (not shown). Immunofluorescence studies using monolayers of transfected COS-7 cells confirmed that the multifinger region (aa 175–509) alone was targeted to the nuclear matrix, where it remained tightly bound followingin situ sequential DNase/RNase extractions (Fig.2 A).Figure 2Targeting of ZNF74 zinc finger region and a fused heterologous nucleoplasmic protein to the nuclear matrix as detected by immunolocalization.

https://openalex.org/W2162490082,"To mimic the effect of ischemia on the integrity of airway epithelium and expression of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), we induced an ATP depletion of the respiratory epithelium from upper airway cells (nasal tissue) and human bronchial epithelial 16HBE14o- cell line. Histological analysis showed that 2 h of ATP depletion led to a loss of the epithelium integrity at the interface between basal cells and columnar cells. The expression of connexin 43 (Cx43, subunit of the gap junctions) and desmoplakins 1 and 2 (DPs 1 and 2, major components of the desmosomes) proteins was inhibited. After 90 min of ATP depletion, a significant decrease of the transepithelial resistance (25%) was observed but was reversible. Similar results were obtained with the 16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelial cell line. ATP depletion led to actin filaments depolymerization. The expression of the mature CFTR (170 kDa) and fodrin proteins at the apical domain of the ciliated cells was down-regulated. The steady-state levels of CFTR, Cx43, DPs 1 and 2 mRNAs, semiquantified by RT-polymerase chain reaction kinetics, remained constant throughout ATP depletion in nasal tissue as in the homogeneous cell population of 16HBE14o- human bronchial epithelial cell line. This suggests that the down-regulation of these proteins might be posttranscriptional. The intercellular diffusion through gap junctions of Lucifer dye was completely inhibited after 90 min of ATP depletion but was reversible. The volume-dependent and the cAMP-dependent chloride secretion were inhibited in a nonreversible way. Taken together, these results suggest that an ATP depletion in human airway epithelium, mimicking ischemia, may induce a marked alteration in the junctional complexes and cytoskeleton structure concomitantly with a loss of apical CFTR expression and chloride secretion function."

In this report, we have identified a key cis-acting element within this region and the transcription factor that binds this element. These studies show that this factor interacts functionally with T3 receptors to control hepatic S14 gene transcription. Construction of S14CAT fusion genes containing the full-length S14 promoter (−4315/+19) or the S14TRR (−2.8/−2.5 kb) fused upstream from proximal promoter deletions (−290/+19; −220/+19; −120/+19; −80/+19; −40/+19) were described previously (31Jump D.B.

Block mutations within the S14 proximal promoter were constructed by using a modification of a two-step PCR-based approach (37Ho S.H. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). All oligonucleotides for PCR were synthesized by the MSU Biochemistry Department Macrostructure Facility. A block mutation was installed within the S14 proximal promoter by PCR to give a reporter plasmid containing the S14 promoter (−2900/+19) with a deletion from −69/−130 bp. The template plasmid contains +19 to −2900 bp within pCATAN with an NsiI restriction site at −129 bp (Nat or S171). The NsiI site was installed during the course of preparing linker-scanning mutants and does not inhibit S14CAT activity (see below and Fig. 2). The template was digested withNsiI and amplified (Perkin-Elmer, Gene Amp-XL-PCR Kit) using primers containing an NsiI site to generate the block mutation. The primers used to synthesize S14CAT-BL1 were as follows: DJ 64, AAAATGCATAT−130TATCAGGCGATCCATCTACCCAGGG; and DJ107, TTTATTATATGCATTA−69TGGGTTTTGGCGTCCTGTCA. The amplified products were digested with NsiI, ligated, and used to transform Escherichia coli DH5α. Purified plasmids were characterized by restriction digestion, and mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis (38Sanger F. Nickles S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). Linker-scanning mutations within the S14 promoter were constructed using a modification of the two-step PCR-based method (37Ho S.H. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene (Amst.). 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar). Briefly, two PCR primers were synthesized to contain S14 sequences located at the 5′ and 3′ ends of the S14 gene along with the cloning sites, BamHI andXhoI, respectively. The S14CAT124 plasmid was used as template, and Vent polymerase was used for DNA synthesis via PCR. The 5′ primer (DJ29(sense), 5′ TATTATT Bam HIGGAT−2900CCTGACGTAGCGGAGGATAGAAGAT) contains an artificial BamHI site, and the authentic sequence begins at −2900 bp. The 3′ primer DJ44(antisense), 5′ ATATAT Xho ICTCGAGG+19TGCTTCCTTCTCAGAG) contains an artificial XhoI downstream from +19 bp. This 2930-bp fragment resulting from PCR was digested with BamHI and HindIII (cuts at −2111 bp) to generate a 819-bp fragment that was cloned into S14CAT126 containing sequences from −2111 to +19 bp. The result of this construction was a S14 promoter extending from −2930 to +19 bp cloned upstream from CAT. This construct contains the native S14 sequence. Linker-scanning mutations were created using two oligonucleotides containing an artificial NsiI (ATGCAT) site. There are noNsiI sites within the S14 promoter (between −2930 and +19 bp). To construct a linker-scanning mutation between −119 to −130 bp, the 5′ sense primer (primers DJ63, AAA Nsi IATGCATAT−119CGACCAAACGCTGGGATTGGCTCAA) in conjunction with DJ44 primer (see above) was used to synthesize a DNA fragment that was cloned into the NsiI/XhoI site of BL-CATAN(BH-NsiI) (multicloning site: 5′BamHI-HindIII-SphI-PstI-SalI-NsiI-XhoI 3′). A second fragment was synthesized using the 5′ sense primer DJ29 (see above) and the 3′ antisense primer (DJ64, AAA Nsi IATGCATAT−130TATCAGGCGATCCATCTACCCAGGG). The product of this second synthesis containingBamHI/NsiI ends was cloned into the plasmid containing the −119/+19-bp element. The result of this construction was the introduction of a 10-−bp block mutation from −130 to −119 bp upstream from the 5′ end of the S14 gene, designated Mut1. Additional ∼10-bp mutations were made as follows: Mut 2, mutation from −111 and −102 bp using primers DJ87, ATATATGCATAA−101GGCTCAAAACAAGGCCGTGT; and DJ88, TTATATGCATAA−111TTTGGTCGCCAGTGTCCGTAT; Mut 3, mutation from −103 and −94 bp using primers DJ97, AATAATTTATGCATTT−95ACAAGGCCGTGTTGATCC; and DJ104, ATTATTATATGCATTT−104TCCCAGCGTTTGGTCGCC; Mut 4, mutation from −95 and −86 bp using primers DJ113, TTTATTTTATGCATAA−85GTGTTGATCCAGTGACTG; and DJ105, TAATTTAAATGCATAA−96TGAGCCAATCCCAGCGTT; and Mut 5, mutation from −79 and −70 bp using primers DJ107, TTTATTATATGCATTA−69TGGGTTTTGGCGTCCTGTCA; and DJ106, AATAATACATGCATTC−80CAACACGGCCTTGTTTTGAG. The presence of the NsiI site along with the mutation was verified by regenerating the NsiI site and by DNA sequence analysis (38Sanger F. Nickles S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar). An RSVCAT fusion gene containing only the promoter (without enhancer) from −60 to +20 bp was synthesized using primers DJ50(sense) 5′ ATATA Pst ICTGCAGACCACTGAATTCCGCATTGCAGAGAT and DJ49(antisense) 5′ ATATA Xho ICTCGAGTGGTGAATGGTCAAATGGCGTTTATT and RSVCAT containing both enhancer and promoter regions as template (39Yamamoto T. Jay G. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The 5′ and 3′ primers contained artificial restriction sites (PstI and XhoI) for directional cloning in BL-CATAN to generate RSVCAT103. Insertion of a single S14TRR (−2.9/−2.5 kb) at an upstream BamHI site generated RSVCAT127. S14 promoter elements from −220/−80 and −220/−120 were generated using PCR amplification and the primer pairs DJ51(sense) 5′ ATATA Hin dIIIAAGCTTAGCAGTTGGCCGCCCACTGA and DJ52(antisense) 5′ ATATA Pst ICTGCAGCAACACGGCCTTGTTTTGAGCCAAT) or DJ51 and DJ53(antisense) 5′ ATAT Pst ICTGCAGTGTCCGTATCAGGCGATCCATC) to give R134 and R116, respectively. Oligo 54(upper) 5′ AGCTTCAAACGCTGGGATTGGCTCAAAACAAGGCCTGCA and oligo 55(lower) 5′ GGCCTTGTTTTGAGCCAATCCCAGCGTTTGA were annealed and ligated directionally into the R127 plasmid to give R117, i.e. a plasmid containing the S14 −120/−80-bp region. RSVCAT126 (R126) was constructed by replacing the S14 TRR in R117 with a canonical TRE,i.e. a tetramer of a DR + 4, gatcctcAGGTCACAGGAGGTCAgag. Oligonucleotides containing 3-bp mutations between −113 and −88 bp, or the albumin C-region (5′ AGCTTGGGTAGGAACCAATGAAATCTGCA) and albumin D-region (5′ AGCTTTGGTATGATTTTGTAATGGGGTACTGCA) were synthesized with HindIII/PstI ends. Complementary pairs of oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated to R127. All the mutations were verified by DNA sequence analysis. Rat primary hepatocytes were prepared and plated into 60-mm dishes Primaria culture plates at 3 × 106 cells/plate (31Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O.A. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8454-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). After a 2–4-h attachment period in Williams E media (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 10 nm dexamethasone, 1 μminsulin, and 25 mm glucose, cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, switched to a serum-free Williams E media, and co-transfected with cesium chloride-purified reporter genes and the MLV-thyroid hormone receptor β1 expression vector (MLV-TRβ1). Cells were transfected using Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) at a ratio of 6.6 μg of Lipofectin to 1 μg of DNA. Two μg of CAT reporter gene and 1 μg of MLV-TRβ1were added per plate. Some studies involved assessment of transfection efficiency using a luciferase expression vector (MamNeoLuc, Clontec, Inc.). MamNeoLuc was co-transfected with S14CAT/MLV-TRβ1 at 0.1 μg/well. Cells were treated without and with T3 (1 μm) for 48 h with 1 media change after 24 h. Harvested cells were assayed for CAT and protein. Results are expressed as CAT activity in units (1 unit of CAT activity = 1 cpm 14C-acetylated chloramphenicol/h/100 μg protein) mean ± S.E. where the number of samples will be indicated in the figure. Expression of luciferase activity was measured using a Luciferase Assay System (Promega, Inc) and a Turner luminometer. Levels of luciferase activity ranged from 0.02 to 0.1 lumin units/100 μg of protein/min. Nuclear extracts used for gel shift analysis were prepared from rat liver (35MacDougald O.A. Jump D.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 280: 761-767Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36MacDougald O.A. Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Gel shift analysis using rat liver nuclear extracts was carried out using the following conditions: DNAs were 32P-labeled at the 5′ end using T4 polynucleotide kinase. Rat liver nuclear extract was mixed with ∼5000 cpm of 32P-DNA in 25 mmTris-Cl, pH 7.5, 40 mm KCl, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, 1 μg of poly(dI·dC), 10% glycerol, incubated for 20 min at room temperature, and electrophoresed in 8% acrylamide:bisacrylamide (75:1) with 25 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.1% Nonidet P-40, and 25 mm Tris borate, pH 8.3, 0.5 mm EDTA as buffer (35MacDougald O.A. Jump D.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 280: 761-767Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Supershift studies using NF-Y (Rockland Immunochemicals, Gilbertsville, PA), c/EBP (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or ARP-1 (S. Karathanasis, Cyanamid, Pearl River, NY) antibodies used ∼3 μl of antibody (∼100 μg/ml)/reaction. Antibodies were preincubated with rat liver nuclear protein for 2 h on ice prior to addition of label DNA. Twenty min after addition of 32P-DNA, samples were electrophoretically separated (200 V for 2 h, 4 °C), and the gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. Fig.1 illustrates the organization of functional elements known to control S14 gene transcription in rat liver. Previous studies have shown that elements between −220 and −80 bp of the transcription start site are important for overall promoter activity (31Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O.A. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8454-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar, 35MacDougald O.A. Jump D.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 280: 761-767Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). DNase I footprints of this region revealed a major site of DNA-protein interaction at −113/−88 bp (B-region) (35MacDougald O.A. Jump D.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 280: 761-767Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and minor sites of interaction at −145 and −165 bp.2 To localize the cis-acting elements that function in both basal and T3-stimulated gene transcription, the S14 proximal promoter was sequentially deleted, and the S14TRR (−2.9/−2.5 kb) was placed immediately upstream from each truncated promoter construct. Primary rat hepatocytes were co-transfected with S14CAT fusion genes and a T3-receptor expression vector (MLVTRβ1) to examine T3 control of the S14CAT gene (31Jump D.B. Clarke S.D. MacDougald O.A. Thelen A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8454-8458Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). In the absence of T3, basal S14CAT activity is very low in most constructs. Deletion of elements between −290 and −2500 bp leads to a ∼70% decline in basal CAT expression and deletion to −80 or −40 bp leads to >95% decline in CAT activity. Analysis of luciferase activity in hepatocytes co-transfected with MamNeoLuc indicated that changes in CAT activity cannot be explained by differential transfection efficiency (not shown). The location of these deletions correlate with the presence of key cis-regulatory elements. Deletion of the −290/−2500-bp regions excises the CHO-RR, and deletion of the −80 to −120-bp region excises the B-region of the S14 proximal promoter. The B-region was previously reported to represent a key cis-regulatory element involved in the hepatic-specific initiation of S14 gene transcription (35MacDougald O.A. Jump D.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 280: 761-767Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 36MacDougald O.A. Clarke S.D. Jump D.B. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 182: 631-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). In the presence of T3, the full-length S124 plasmid (−4315/+19 bp) is induced 50-fold (from 127 ± 27 to 6396 ± 740 units). Moving the TRR closer to the proximal promoter increases the level of T3-mediated transactivation to 140-fold (S156). However, the constructs containing the NF-1 and the PIC sites (S158 or S159) show the same response to T3 as the full-length plasmid. Because the basal activity is reduced by >95% in the S158 and S159 constructs when compared with the full-length construct, the overall CAT activity is similarly reduced,i.e. from ∼6400 CAT units in S124 to ≤250 units in S158 and S159. These findings indicate that proximal promoter elements affecting basal activity significantly impact the overall level of T3-stimulated S14CAT activity. The cis-acting elements within the proximal promoter region mediating the greatest change in both basal and T3-stimulated expression are located between −120 and −80 bp. The promoter deletion studies described in Fig. 1 placed the S14TRR immediately adjacent to the proximal promoter region. Because the S14 TRR is normally at −2.5 to −2.8 kb such a change in position may not accurately reflect the role proximal promoter elements play in hormonal control of the S14 gene. Consequently, a block mutation of the B-region was installed to assess its effect on transcription of this gene (Fig. 2). The full-length native S14CAT construct extends from −2897 bp to +19 bp (Nat1) and is induced 54-fold by T3. However, deletion of the −130/−69-bp region (Bl1) results in low basal CAT activity (31 ± 13 units) and a marginal (45%) augmentation following T3 treatment. Because the Bl1 mutation spanned nearly 60 bp and the footprinted region (35MacDougald O.A. Jump D.B. Biochem. J. 1990; 280: 761-767Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar) spanned ∼25 bp, a linker scanning approach was used to localize better the key cis-regulatory elements. Accordingly, five linker-scanning mutations of ∼10 bp in length were made extending from −129 to −70 bp (Fig. 2). Although mutations flanking the footprinted region (−113/−88 bp), i.e. Mut1 (−129/−120 bp) and Mut5 (−79/−70 bp) induced marginal changes in S14 CAT activity, mutations within the footprinted region had a significant effect on S14CAT activity. Mut2 (−111/−102 bp) and Mut3 (−103/−94 bp) showed very low CAT activity in the presence of T3(10 ± 3 and 70 ± 14 CAT units, respectively), whereas Mut 4 (−95/−86) displayed an 8-fold response to T3. These studies suggest that the region between −111 and −94 bp is critical for both basal and T3-mediated activation of S14CAT activity. Co-transfection with MamNeoLuc indicated that these differences were not attributed to changes in transfection efficiency (not shown). During the course of our studies, we discovered that placing the S14TRR immediately upstream from the RSV basal promoter (−60/+20 bp; R127), which contains only a TATA box (39Yamamoto T. Jay G. Pastan I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 176-180Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), led to a marginal 3-fold increase in CAT activity following T3 treatment (Fig.3). Inserting the S14 proximal promoter elements −220/−80 bp (R134) or the −120/−80-bp region (R117) between the RSV TATA box and the S14 TRR increased both basal CAT activity and T3-mediated transactivation (12–14-fold). In contrast, inserting the −220/−120-bp region (R116) augmented basal activity but had no effect on T3-mediated transactivation when compared with R127. Replacing the S14 TRR in R117 with a canonical TRE (a tetramer of a DR + 4; R126) confers the same level of T3-mediated transactivation (12-fold) as seen with R117. However, if the −120/-"

However, with physiological doses of cholinergic agonists, the [Ca2+] i increase is localized to the apical (secretory) pole of the cell, leading to suggestions that zymogen (secretory) granules themselves may constitute an InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ store responsible for localized Ca2+ release. We have therefore re-investigated whether the ER in pancreatic acinar cells is capable of acting as a functional Ca2+ store in all, or only some, cellular regions. In streptolysin O-permeabilized cells, the ER accumulated up to 25 mmol of 45Ca2+ per liter ER volume by an ATP-dependent, thapsigargin-sensitive, process. This tracer Ca2+ uptake was dependent on ambient (loading) [Ca2+], as was the intra-ER free [Ca2+], assessed by imaging the fluorescence of Magfura-2 within the Ca2+ stores. Comparison of free and total intra-ER [Ca2+] indicated that 200–300 Ca2+ions are bound within the ER lumen for every Ca2+ ion remaining free. Subcellular analysis showed that ER stores in all regions of the permeabilized cell took up Ca2+ at loading [Ca2+] between 60 nm and 1 μm. Thapsigargin released Ca2+ from stores in all cellular regions, as did InsP3. Immunofluorescence with antibodies against sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum-2b type Ca2+,Mg2+-ATPase or calreticulin confirmed that ER Ca2+ stores were present throughout the cytoplasm.

Intracellular Ca2+ stores play a dominant role in Ca2+ signaling in pancreatic acinar cells.

Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). This initial work also identified the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as the intracellular Ca2+ store responsible for agonist-induced increases in [Ca2+] i (1Streb H. Irvine R.F. Berridge M.J. Schulz I. Nature. 1983; 306: 67-69Crossref PubMed Scopus (1797) Google Scholar). Recently, however, zymogen granules have been proposed to act as a Ca2+ store in pancreatic acinar cells. (2Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). This hypothesis stemmed initially from the observation that stimulation of pancreatic (and other) acinar cells with acetylcholine results in a polarized rise in cytosolic free [Ca2+], with the [Ca2+] i increase being initiated at the apical pole of the cell where zymogen granules are clustered (3Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H.

Subsequently the rise in [Ca2+] i spreads to the basal pole of the acinar cell (3Kasai H. Augustine G.J. Nature. 1990; 348: 735-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar, 4Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar, 5Tan Y.P. Marty A. Trautmann A.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

The role of the proposed zymogen granule Ca2+ store would be to act as the releasable Ca2+ store responsible for the initiation of the intracellular Ca2+ signal at the apical pole (2Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 7Kasai Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). Propagation of the increase in [Ca2+] i toward other regions of the cell could then be mediated by the ER Ca2+ stores, since the rough endoplasmic reticulum is found throughout the acinar cell (see e.g. Ref. 8Bolender R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). This zymogen granule Ca2+ store model is attractive since it can explain the restriction of the [Ca2+] i signal to only the luminal (apical) region when low physiological doses of cholinergic agonists are applied (7Kasai Li Y.X. Miyashita Y. Cell. 1993; 74: 669-677Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar, 9Thorn P. Lawrie A.M. Smith P.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1993; 74: 661-668Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (430) Google Scholar). However, there is as yet no conclusive evidence on whether zymogen granules are equipped with intracellular messenger-triggered Ca2+ release. Indeed, recent evidence suggests that the report of InsP3-sensitive Ca2+ release from granules (2Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) may be an artifact produced by the impurity of the zymogen granule preparation employed (10Yule D.I. Ernst S.A. Ohnishi H. Wojcikiewicz R.J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9093-9098Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). A further problem with the report of zymogen granule Ca2+stores (2Gerasimenko O.V. Gerasimenko J.V. Belan P.V. Petersen O.H. Cell. 1996; 84: 473-480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar) is that no evidence was found for a Ca2+ uptake mechanism in the proposed zymogen granule Ca2+ store. However, an active Ca2+-sequestering mechanism is essential to explain the refilling of Ca2+ stores and hence the repetitive nature of the agonist-induced [Ca2+] i transients. These conflicting results have prompted us to re-evaluate the suggestion that the endoplasmic reticulum can act as a functional Ca2+ store in all subcellular regions of the pancreatic acinar cell. Our results demonstrate that the endoplasmic reticulum can indeed act as a Ca2+ store in all subcellular regions, including the apical pole. Small clusters of acinar cells were prepared from the pancreas of one 200-g male Sprague-Dawley rat by the same enzymatic digestion procedure described in Ref. 11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar. After isolation, cells were resuspended in a HEPES/Tris-buffered physiological saline containing 133 mm NaCl, 4.2 mm KCl, 1.0 mm CaCl2, 1.0 MgCl2, 5.8 mm glucose, 0.2 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, amino acids as in Eagle's minimal essential medium, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 10 mm HEPES. The pH of this medium was set at 7.4 with Tris. Cells were either used immediately or stored in 1-ml portions on ice until use. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Magfura-2-AM for 30 min at 37 °C, as described previously (11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), and allowed to settle on a poly-l-lysine-coated glass coverslip which formed the bottom of a perfusion chamber. Fluorescence was imaged using a system based on an inverted epifluorescence Nikon Diaphot microscope and a slow scan CCD camera (Digital Pixel Ltd, Brighton, UK). Details of the imaging system were described previously (11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The microscope objective was a Nikon 40 × oil immersion lens (Numerical Aperture 1.3), which allowed images of a field 90 × 135 μm to be captured. For imaging Magfura-2 fluorescence in permeabilized cells, a 3 × 3 binning was applied to the individual pixels on the image sensor to give a theoretical spatial resolution of 0.67 × 0.67 μm/pixel. Background-subtracted 340:380 images were calculated off-line. Before initiating permeabilization acinar cells were perifused with Ca2+ uptake medium containing 135 mm KCl, 1.2 mm KH2PO4, 0.5 mm EGTA, 0.5 mm HEDTA, 0.5 mmnitrilotriacetic acid, and 20 mm HEPES/KOH, pH 7.1. The free Mg2+ concentration was 0.9 mm and was adjusted as described by Schoenmakers et al. (12Schoenmakers T.J.M. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P.R. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar). SLO (0.4 IU/ml final concentration) was added directly to the perifusion chamber to permeabilize acinar cells as described previously (11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). When permeabilization was achieved (as judged by a drop in fluorescence at the dye isosbestic wavelength) cells were re-perifused with the Ca2+ uptake medium as described above but devoid of SLO. Perifusion continued for the duration of the experiment. All experiments were performed at room temperature. Calcium uptake by intracellular Ca2+ stores was initiated by superfusing cells with Ca2+ uptake medium containing 1 mm ATP, free Ca2+ concentration as indicated in the text and figures, and free Mg2+ concentration of 0.9 mm (free divalent cation concentrations calculated according to Ref. 12Schoenmakers T.J.M. Visser G.J. Flik G. Theuvenet A.P.R. BioTechniques. 1992; 12: 870-879PubMed Google Scholar). When free Ca2+ concentration was set to 60, 100, or 200 nm, no mitochondrial inhibitors were included in the medium since mitochondrial Ca2+ uptake has previously been shown not to occur at this ambient free Ca2+ concentration (13Van de Put F.H.M.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Willems P.H.G.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). The mitochondrial Ca2+uptake inhibitors oligomycin (5 μm) and antimycin (5 μm) were included when a free Ca2+concentration of 1.0 μm was applied. Calcium uptake was monitored for a period of 20 min with ratio images acquired at 15-s intervals. Isolated pancreatic acinar cells in suspension were permeabilized by treatment with SLO (0.4 IU/ml) for 10 min as described previously (14Van de Put F.H.M.M. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Willems P.H.G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12438-12443Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), washed twice, resuspended in (Ca2+-free) Ca2+ uptake medium (see above), and kept at 0 °C until use. Cell density was adjusted to give a protein concentration of around 4 mg of protein/ml. At the beginning of the radiotracer uptake experiment 10 μl of permeabilized cell suspension was added to 87 μl of Ca2+ uptake medium which contained 10 mm phosphocreatine, 10 units of creatine kinase/ml, 1 μm thapsigargin or 1% (w/v) Me2SO, and 5 μCi of 45Ca2+/ml. The free Mg2+(0.9 mm) and Ca2+ (as indicated) concentrations were adjusted as described above. After 3 min, the incubation was started by adding 3 μl of MgATP stock solution to give a final MgATP concentration of 1 mm. The incubation was terminated after 15 min by adding 1.0 ml of ice-cold stop solution containing 150 mm KCl, 5.0 mm MgCl2, 1.0 mm EGTA, and 20 mm Hepes/KOH, pH 7.1, and the suspension was rapidly filtered (GF/C glass microfiber filters, Whatman, Kent, UK). The filters were washed with 2 × 1.0 ml of ice-cold stop solution, dissolved in scintillation fluid, and counted for radioactivity. Total Ca2+ was calculated and expressed as either nmol/mg protein or as mol per liter of endoplasmic reticulum. For the former, cellular protein was determined (after treatment of the cells with 0.1% Triton X-100) with a commercial Coomassie Blue kit (Bio-Rad), using gamma globulin (Bio-Rad) as a standard. For the latter, cell density was determined using a hemocytometer (Weber Scientific International Ltd., Teddington, UK), and the volume of endoplasmic reticulum per incubation was calculated using the number of cells combined with morphological data on pancreatic acinar cells given by Bolender (8Bolender R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Calcium actively stored by the endoplasmic reticulum was defined as the difference in total Ca2+ retained on the filter after incubation in the absence and presence of the endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ uptake inhibitor thapsigargin. A small drop of cell suspension in physiological saline (see above) was placed on a silane-coated slide, and the cells were allowed to adhere for 10 min in a moist environment. The cells were then fixed for 15 min in a freshly prepared paraformaldehyde solution (2% w/v in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)). Cells were washed twice in PBS and were permeabilized using 1% (v/v) Triton dissolved in PBS. The slides were subsequently incubated with primary antibody or preimmune serum in the presence of 0.1% Triton and 1% normal goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Rabbit polyclonal antiserum against calreticulin (15Roderick H.L. Campbell A.K. Llewellyn D.H. FEBS Lett. 1997; 405: 181-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) was diluted 1:100 and rabbit polyclonal antisera to SERCA-2b Ca2+-ATPase (16Wuytack F. Eggermont J. Raeymaekers L. Plessers L.

Slides were washed three times with PBS and were then incubated for 1 h at room temperature with FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit polyclonal antiserum diluted 1:200 in PBS containing 0.1% (v/v) Triton and 1% (v/v) normal goat serum. Cells were washed three times and mounted in glycerol, which contained SlowFade-Light to prevent photobleaching. Slides were analyzed using the same imaging system employed for Magfura-2 imaging (see above and Ref. 11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), except that a FITC dichroic filter set (Chroma Technologies) was used to observe FITC fluorescence. In addition, the resolution of the cooled CCD camera was increased to its maximum by applying a binning of 1 × 1 (i.e. no summation of pixels) to give a theoretical spatial resolution of 0.22 × 0.22 μm per pixel. Polyclonal antiserum against calreticulin was generously supplied by Drs. D. H. Llewellyn and L. Roderick (UWMC, Cardiff, UK). Two different polyclonal antisera against SERCA-2b Ca2+-ATPase were used, kindly supplied by Dr. F. Wuytack (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium), and by Dr. R. L. Dormer (UWCM, Cardiff, UK). Normal goat serum and FITC-conjugated swine anti-rabbit immunoglobulins were from DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark. Other chemicals were obtained from the following suppliers: SLO from Difco; thapsigargin from Calbiochem; Ins(1, 4, 5)P3 from Sigma; Magfura-2-AM and SlowFade Light from Molecular Probes;45Ca2+ (20 mCi/ml) from NEN Life Science Products. All other chemicals were of analytical grade. The total exchangeable Ca2+ uptake capacity of the thapsigargin-sensitive intracellular Ca2+ stores in permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells was determined using the radioactive45Ca2+ technique. The effect of the ambient (loading) [Ca2+] i on the total exchangeable uptake capacity of intracellular Ca2+ stores was examined over the range 60 nm to 1.0 μm. Total thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ uptake rose from 1.71 nmol per mg of protein to 6.11 nmol per mg of protein. Fig.1 shows the uptake data expressed as total thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ uptake per volume of endoplasmic reticulum (see “Experimental Procedures”). This gives a total exchangeable Ca2+ accumulation of 7–25 mmol per liter of endoplasmic reticulum. As in our previous paper (11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), we used the low affinity Ca2+indicator Magfura-2 to monitor the free Ca2+ concentration inside Ca2+ storage compartments in real time in individual cells. Calcium uptake was ATP-dependent and reached steady-state levels within 15 min. The Magfura-2 ratio at steady state was dependent on the ambient (loading) [Ca2+] and rose from 0.79 to 2.08 as [Ca2+] i was increased from 60 nm to 1 μm (Fig.2 A). The initial rate of Ca2+ uptake into the stores was very steeply dependent on ambient [Ca2+], increasing more than 6-fold with the change in [Ca2+] i (Fig. 2 A). Because of the greatly enhanced initial Ca2+ uptake rate, the time taken to reach steady state [Ca2+]lumen was reduced at higher [Ca2+] i . Fig. 2 B shows the relationship between steady-state free [Ca2+]lumen (as indicated by the steady-state Magfura-2 ratio from Fig. 2 A) and total thapsigargin-sensitive exchangeable stored Ca2+ (taken from Fig. 1) in pancreatic acinar cells. The two parameters change in parallel over the entire range of loading [Ca2+] studied, showing that increased Ca2+ uptake at the higher loading [Ca2+] i values does not saturate the intra-store Ca2+ buffering system. In addition, the parallelism of total and free [Ca2+] within the stores implies that the free [Ca2+]lumen in any given part of the cell can be used to infer the total exchangeable Ca2+ in the same compartment. We proceeded to study Ca2+ uptake in more detail by comparing uptake in apical and basal areas of acinar cells. This was achieved by applying the same method of subcellular regional analysis used in our previous study (11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar), i.e. selecting regions of interest in the apical area and in the basal area of the same cell(s). At 60 and 100 nm [Ca2+] i, both initial uptake rates and steady-state ratio values were almost identical between apical and basal regions (Fig.3, A and B). At higher values of [Ca2+] i, namely 200 nm and 1 μm, initial uptake rates were also similar for the two regions. Interestingly, however, the [Ca2+]lumen reached at steady state at these higher values of [Ca2+] i was noticeably greater in the basal area of the cell (Fig. 3, C andD). Thapsigargin has been widely used in intact acinar cells to induce “global” [Ca2+] i release (see e.g.Ref. 4Toescu E.C. Lawrie A.M. Gallacher D.V. Petersen O.H. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1623-1629Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). In contrast to the apical pole [Ca2+] i signals observed with acetylcholine and thapsigargin (and other organellar Ca2+-ATPase inhibitors) evoke a homogeneous elevation in cytosolic [Ca2+]i (4) or, in some cases, a [Ca2+] i rise which is largest in the basolateral pole (6Elliott A.C. Cairns S.P. Allen D.G. Eur. J. Physiol. 1992; 422: 245-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In permeabilized cells, thapsigargin completely prevents ATP-driven 45Ca2+accumulation (13Van de Put F.H.M.M. Hoenderop J.G.J. De Pont J.J.H.H.M. Willems P.H.G.M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 153-163Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). We tested whether thapsigargin could deplete previously loaded Ca2+ stores in permeabilized pancreatic acinar cells. Fig. 4 A shows that, as expected, thapsigargin caused a slow depletion of Ca2+ stores which was similar in both the apical and basolateral poles. Prevention of Ca2+-ATPase activity by removal of ATP had essentially similar results (data not shown). The kinetics of thapsigargin-induced depletion were examined by normalizing the data shown in Fig. 4 A to the total size of the ATP-sensitive Ca2+ pool (i.e. taking the ratio before loading the stores in each experiment as 0% and the steady-state ratio following loading as 100%). This gave depletion curves for apical and basolateral stores which were not significantly different (data not shown), again indicating that thapsigargin has equal actions on Ca2+ stores in the two cellular regions. We have previously shown that thapsigargin enhances the rate of InsP3-evoked Ca2+ release from loaded intracellular Ca2+ stores and also converts apparent “quantal” release of Ca2+ from stores into an essentially monophasic release process (11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Fig. 4 Bpresents subcellular regional analysis of the effects of sequential addition of thapsigargin and InsP3. To facilitate comparison between the apical and basolateral poles, data were normalized as described above. It is again clear that the kinetics of Ca2+ store depletion by thapsigargin and InsP3are identical for Ca2+ stores in the apical and basolateral poles. We used immunohistochemistry to study the distribution of SERCA-2b Ca2+-ATPase and of calreticulin in pancreatic acinar cells. Both SERCA-2b Ca2+-ATPase (Fig.5 A) and calreticulin (Fig.5 B) appeared to be present in all regions of the cell. Immunostaining for the SERCA-2b Ca2+-ATPase was slightly weaker in the apical area than in other regions of the cell (Fig.5 A). Weak decoration with the Ca2+-ATPase antibody in the central portion of the basal areas of the cells indicated the presence of the nucleus, which was verified by staining DNA with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (results not shown). The polyclonal antibody against calreticulin decorated acinar cells in essentially the same pattern as observed with Ca2+-ATPase antiserum. The only major difference was that the anti-calreticulin staining was slightly more punctate. As with the SERCA-2b antibody, both the apical region and the nucleus appeared less decorated than the basolateral cytoplasm. Since SERCA-2B Ca2+-ATPase and calreticulin are both markers of the endoplasmic reticulum in pancreatic acinar cells, the less intense decoration of the apical cytoplasm probably reflects the fact that the apical region contains relatively less endoplasmic reticulum compared with other areas of the cell. This is well known from numerous morphological studies (seee.g. Ref. 8Bolender R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar) and arises from the fact that a large part of the apical cytoplasm is occupied by zymogen granules. This study describes the Ca2+ sequestering properties of intracellular Ca2+ stores in pancreatic acinar cells at the subcellular level. In situ imaging of intracellular Ca2+ stores revealed that Ca2+ can be accumulated in all regions of this polarized cell type. The [Ca2+]lumen levels reached at steady state were dependent on the ambient [Ca2+] i used to load the stores. The total Ca2+ taken up by the Ca2+ stores also rose with increasing [Ca2+] i . These observations show that increased Ca2+ uptake does not result in saturation of the intravesicular Ca2+-buffering system, since both total Ca2+ and [Ca2+]lumen increased upon elevation of [Ca2+] i . In addition, these data tend to suggest that a single type of intra-store Ca2+buffer with a single class of binding site is highly unlikely to account for all intra-luminal Ca2+ buffering. Detailed subcellular analysis of the Ca2+ uptake process showed that ATP-driven Ca2+ sequestration occurred in both apical and basal regions of the cell. The two subcellular regions did not differ in their capacity to accumulate Ca2+ at lower values of [Ca2+] i . At 0.2 and 1.0 μm [Ca2+] i, however, stores in the basal area were able to accumulate significantly more Ca2+than stores in the apical region, as judged by a higher steady-state Magfura ratio. Immunohistochemistry revealed a higher density of SERCA-2b Ca2+-ATPases in the basal area. However, this most probably reflects the simple fact that the basal area contains relatively more endoplasmic reticulum (8Bolender R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). We conclude that intracellular endoplasmic reticulum stores in the apical and basal area are able to accumulate Ca2+ but that stores in the basal area have an increased capacity for storing Ca2+. In our previous study we showed that, at an ambient [Ca2+] i of 0.2 μm, the steady-state intravesicular [Ca2+] was 70 μm (11Van de Put F.H.M.M. Elliott A.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 4999-5006Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). This figure can be compared with the measured total thapsigargin-sensitive Ca2+ uptake under identical conditions, which was 19 mmol of Ca2+ per liter of endoplasmic reticulum (Fig.1 B). From this comparison we conclude that around 270 Ca2+ ions are bound for every free Ca2+ ion. This calculation confirms that most stored Ca2+ is buffered within intracellular Ca2+ stores. Despite this heavy Ca2+ buffering, large amounts of Ca2+ are immediately accessible for rapid mobilization from these stores in both intact and permeabilized cell systems. This indicates that stored Ca2+ is not tightly bound or trapped once accumulated. Calreticulin is proposed to act as a major Ca2+ buffer within Ca2+ stores, as well as having an important role as an intra-ER molecular chaperone (19Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar). The calreticulin molecule has the ability to bind up to 25 mol of Ca2+ per mol with a low millimolar affinity. Pancreatic tissue is the richest known source of calreticulin (calreticulin content of the pancreas is 540 μg/g of tissue (20Khanna N.C. Waisman D.M. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 1078-1082Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar)), presumably because the high protein synthesis rate of acinar cells imposes a requirements for molecular chaperones. Simple calculation reveals that the calreticulin concentration within the pancreatic endoplasmic reticulum is about 52 μmol/liter ER. 2Eighty-two percent of pancreatic volume consists of acinar cells (8Bolender R.P. J. Cell Biol. 1974; 61: 269-287Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). To simplify the calculation we have assumed that all calreticulin in the pancreas is contained in acinar cells. Our estimate of [Ca2+]lumen indicates that calreticulin will not be saturated under these conditions. Even if one assumes a [Ca2+]lumen of 1 mm (instead of our 70 μm estimate), as has been suggested for other cell types on the basis of work with ER-targeted aequorin (21Monteru M. Brini M. Marsault R. Sitia R. Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 5467-5475Crossref PubMed Scopus (265) Google Scholar), calreticulin can only account for the binding of 3–4% of the total amount of stored Ca2+. This calculation shows that calreticulin may not be as important in organellar Ca2+ buffering as originally proposed. This is in agreement with recent work on fibroblasts from calreticulin null mice, which showed no differences in ER Ca2+ storage from wild-type cells (22Coppolino M.G. Woodside M.J. Demaurex N. Grinstein S. St-Arnaud R. Dedhar S. Nature. 1997; 386: 843-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar). In fact, recent studies have provided evidence that calreticulin may have other functions in Ca2+ signaling than organellar Ca2+ buffering. For instance, although calreticulin overexpression inhibited Ca2+ waves in Xenopusoocytes, this action was found to be associated with the high affinity, low capacity, Ca2+-binding site, rather than with the low affinity, high capacity b"
https://openalex.org/W2001476675,"Zinc finger proteins of the Cys2His2 class represent a large group of DNA-binding proteins. A major subfamily of those proteins, the Krüppel-associated box (KRAB) domain-containing Cys2His2-zinc finger proteins, have been described as potent transcriptional repressors. So far, however, no DNA-binding sites for KRAB domain-containing zinc finger proteins have been isolated. Using a polymerase chain reaction-based selection strategy with double- and single-stranded DNA, we failed to reveal a binding site for Kid-1, one member of KRAB-zinc finger proteins. Binding of Kid-1 both to single- and homoduplex double-stranded DNA was negligible. We now present evidence that Kid-1 binds to heteroduplex DNA. Similar to Kid-1, the non-KRAB-zinc finger protein WT1 also bound avidly to heteroduplex DNA (both the −KTS and +KTS splice variant of WT1), whereas the POU domain protein Oct-6, the ets domain protein Ets-1 and the RING finger of BRCA-1 did not bind to heteroduplex DNA. Binding of WT1 to heteroduplex DNA was markedly reduced in naturally occurring mutants. The recognition of certain DNA structures by transcriptional repressor proteins may therefore represent a more common phenomenon than previously thought.

The recognition of certain DNA structures by transcriptional repressor proteins may therefore represent a more common phenomenon than previously thought. DNA-binding proteins are essential for the utilization of genetic information. They take part in the replication of the genome, in transcription of DNA into mRNA and in the repair of the genome. In these processes the interaction with DNA takes place in a variety of ways. Interaction with sequence-specific DNA is a common and well established phenomenon. There are many examples of proteins binding to a specific sequence of double-stranded DNA. In contrast, sequence-specific interaction with single-stranded DNA seems to occur more rarely. An example for such an interaction would be YB-1, a member of the Y box family of transcription factors, which binds to a region of single-stranded DNA spanning the X box of the major histocompatibility class II DRA promotor (1MacDonald G.H. Itoh-Lindstrom Y. Ting J.P.-Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3527-3533Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Interaction independent of a specific sequence is another possibility, but so far only a few sequence-independent, structural motifs have been described as binding sites. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA-dependent protein kinase are essential elements of the cellular response to DNA damage (for reviews see, Refs. 2de Murcia G. de Murcia J.M. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 172-176Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (753) Google Scholar and 3Weaver D.T. Trends Genet. 1995; 11: 388-392Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Whereas poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase binds to DNA containing single-strand breaks, DNP-PK binds to double-strand DNA breaks, and both do so independently of the DNA sequence. In the case of single-strand DNA breaks, the DNA molecule assumes a V-shaped conformation, which is recognized by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. Other examples of protein/DNA interaction based on structural characteristics of the DNA molecule can be found in the recognition of cruciform DNA by the high-mobility group protein HMG-1 (4Bianchi M.E. Beltrame M. Paonessa G. Science. 1989; 243: 1056-1059Crossref PubMed Scopus (542) Google Scholar), the tumor suppressor protein p53 (5Lee S. Cavallo L. Griffith J. J. Biol.

Peterson C.L. Nature. 1996; 379: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Transcription factors as a subclass of DNA-binding proteins play an important role during growth and differentiation of cells and organs. Several families of transcription factors have been described, one of which is the family of zinc finger proteins (for recent reviews, see Refs. 7Berg J.M. Shi Y. Science. 1996; 271: 1081-1085Crossref PubMed Scopus (1646) Google Scholar and 8Klug A. Schwabe J.W.R. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 597-604Crossref PubMed Scopus (531) Google Scholar). So far, however, binding sites have been characterized for only a subset of zinc finger proteins. “Classical” zinc finger proteins like Sp1, Egr-1, and WT1 have been shown to recognize sequence-specific double-stranded DNA (e.g. Ref. 9Berg J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 11109-11110Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). One large subfamily of zinc finger proteins is characterized by the presence of a highly conserved motif, the so-called KRAB-A domain or FBP (10Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1991; 19: 5661-5667Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), which has been identified as a potent transcriptional repressor domain (12Margolin J.F. Friedman J.R. Meyer W.K.-H.

Because the KRAB-A domain is present in approximately one-third of the large number of Cis2His2-zinc finger proteins (10Bellefroid E.J. Poncelet D.A. Lecocq P.J. Revelant O. Martial J.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 3608-3612Crossref PubMed Scopus (343) Google Scholar) (there are several hundred genes coding for those proteins in the mammalian genome (16Bellefroid E.J. Lecocq P.J. Benhida A. Poncelet D.A. Belayew A. Martial J.A. DNA (N. Y.). 1989; 8: 377-387Crossref PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar)), it represents a very important paradigm of transcriptional repression. The identification of the KRAB-A domain as a transcriptional repressor motif was soon followed by the cloning of proteins that interact with the KRAB-A domain (17Friedman J.R. Fredericks W.J.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1996; 24: 4859-4867Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), but up to this point no DNA-binding site for a KRAB-zinc finger protein could be identified. Only in the case of the human KRAB-zinc finger protein ZNF74 has an affinity for RNA homopolymers been described (20Grondin B. Bazinet M. Aubry M. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15458-15467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Kid-1 is a 66-kDa protein with 13 Cis2His2-zinc fingers at its COOH terminus. The zinc fingers are clustered in two groups of four and nine zinc fingers and are separated by a 32-amino acid spacer (21Witzgall R. O'Leary E. Gessner R. Ouellette A.J. Bonventre J.V. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 1933-1942Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The Kid-1 protein also contains a KRAB-A domain at its NH2 terminus. Here we demonstrate binding of the zinc finger region of Kid-1 to heteroduplex DNA. Another transcriptional repressor protein, the Wilms' tumor protein WT1, also binds to heteroduplex DNA. This function is impaired in naturally occurring mutants of WT1. In the case of Kid-1 and WT1, recombinant plasmids encoding fusion proteins with glutathione S-transferase were constructed using the plasmid pGEX-KG (22Guan K. Dixon J.E. Anal. Biochem. 1991; 192: 262-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (1635) Google Scholar). Details are available from the authors upon request. The recombinant proteins were purified from bacterial extracts according to standard protocols (23$$Google Scholar). The binding site selections were carried out using the random oligonucleotide 5′-CTT GAT CCT AAG ATT CCC TG-N15-AGG CTC AAA GCT GAA TTA CT-3′ and the PCR 1The abbreviations used are: PCR, polymerase chain reaction; bp, base pair(s); GST, glutathioneS-transferase; KRAB, Krüppel-associated box; WT1, Wilms' tumor protein 1. primers 5′-CTT GAT CCT AAG ATT CCC TG-3′ and 5′-AGT AAT TCA GCT TTG AGC CT -3′, the random oligonucleotide 5′-CTT GAT CCT AAG ATT CCC TG-N35-AGG CTC AAA GCT GAA TTA CT-3′ and the same PCR primers mentioned before, and the random oligonucleotide 5′-GAT CCT AAG ATT CCC TGT CGA C-N75-GTC GAC TCC CTT TAG TGA GGG TT-3′ and the PCR primers 5′-CTT GAT CCT AAG ATT CCC TG-3′ and 5′-ATT AAC CCT CAC TAA AGG GA-3′.

When a homoduplex of the same length was used, oligonucleotide ss1 was substituted with an oligonucleotide fully complementary to oligonucleotide ss2. The structure of heteroduplex ss1/ss2 was corroborated by digests with restriction enzymes cutting either in the double-stranded region or in the bubble. AvaII recognizes a site in the bubble region of ss2 and in the homoduplex (5′-GGACC-3′), this site is cut only in the homoduplex. SalI (5′-GTCGAC-3′) and BamHI (5′-GGATCC-3′) recognize sites in the double-stranded region of the heteroduplex immediately adjacent to the bubble, these enzymes are able to cut the heteroduplex DNA, although less efficiently than the homoduplex (the lower efficiency probably results from the close location to the bubble). The heteroduplex with a bubble of 7 nucleotides consisted of the oligonucleotides ss5 5′-CCT CAC TAA AGG GAG TCG AC T ACC TTT GGA TCC AGG GAA TCT TAG GA-3′ and ss6 5′-TCC TAA GAT TCC CTG GAT CC C CCT TGC GTC GAC TCC CTT TAG TGA GG-3′ (noncomplementary nucleotides are bold and italic). The oligonucleotide with the oct-binding site had the sequence 5′-CTG AGC AAA ACA CCA CCT GGG TA A TTT GCA T TT CTA AAA TAA G-3′ (the octamer motif is bold and italic), the oligonucleotide with the ets-binding site had the sequence 5′-TGA ATA TTT TGT AA T TTC CT A GTC TTG-3′ (the ets-binding site is bold and italic), and the oligonucleotide with the Egr-1/WT1-binding site had the sequence 5′-CGC CCT CGC CCC CGC GCC GGG-3′ (the Egr-1/WT1-binding site is bold and italic); the oligonucleotides containing the octamer motif, the ets-binding site and the Egr-1/WT1-binding site were regular homoduplex DNA. Homoduplex and heteroduplex DNA were prepared by mixing equimolar amounts of both strands, heating to 80–85 °C in a water bath, and subsequent slow cooling to room temperature. The selection was carried out according to already published protocols with minor modifications (24Pierrou S. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Approximately 1 μg of purified protein and 100–200 ng of selected and PCR-amplified oligonucleotide were used for each round of selection. To produce single-stranded oligonucleotide, a second PCR reaction was run with the reverse primer only after having precipitated the double-stranded PCR product with ethanol and ammonium acetate. Gel shifts were performed essentially as described previously (24Pierrou S. Enerbäck S. Carlsson P. Anal. Biochem. 1995; 229: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). When competition experiments were performed, a 5-, 25-, and 125-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide was added to the protein together with the labeled binding site. When the zinc finger structure was to be disrupted, a combination of 10 mm EDTA, pH 8.0, and 0.1 mm 1,10-phenanthroline (final concentrations) was added to the binding buffer. The 1,10-phenanthroline was added from a 20 mm stock in ethanol; as a negative control, an equal amount of ethanol was added to the binding buffer. To define a binding site for the KRAB-zinc finger protein Kid-1, we performed a PCR-based selection strategy with double-stranded DNA and various portions of the Kid-1 zinc finger domain. Binding site selections with the four-zinc finger cluster and a 15-bp random oligonucleotide, with the nine-zinc finger cluster and a 35-bp random oligonucleotide, and finally with all 13 zinc fingers of Kid-1 and a 75-bp random oligonucleotide did not result in the isolation of a binding site for any of the zinc finger constructs. We therefore also initiated a binding site selection with single-stranded DNA and the 13-zinc finger construct of Kid-1. Although we noticed a weak but consistent shift throughout the selection process, we were unable to define a consensus sequence. The observation of a weak shift even with nonselected single-stranded DNA prompted us to try a gel shift with heteroduplex DNA. Heteroduplex DNA occurs as a result of “bubble formation” during transcription of DNA into RNA, when the double-stranded DNA is melted so that RNA polymerase II can read the template strand, and may therefore serve as a natural substrate for transcriptional repressor proteins. A heteroduplex DNA with 20 paired nucleotides at the 5′- and 3′-end and a bubble of 25 nucleotides in the middle was designed randomly, consisting of single-stranded oligonucleotides ss1 and ss2. Care was taken that the nucleotides facing each other in the bubble consisted of pyrimidine·pyrimidine and purine·purine base pairs, to avoid non-Watson/Crick base pairs. Such a heteroduplex DNA was shifted efficiently by a fusion protein between the 13 zinc fingers of Kid-1 and glutathioneS-transferase (GST), whereas either single-stranded oligonucleotide was only barely shifted (Fig.1 A). When the 13-zinc finger construct was incubated with homoduplex DNA consisting of the single-stranded oligonucleotide ss2 used in the heteroduplex DNA, and another fully complementary single-stranded oligonucleotide, no shift could be detected (Fig. 1 B). A heteroduplex DNA with the same paired sequences at either end but only a bubble of 7 nucleotides in the middle could not be shifted as efficiently as the heteroduplex DNA with a bubble of 25 nucleotides (Fig. 1 B). GlutathioneS-transferase could not shift any of the DNA molecules just described (Fig. 1, A and B). To further demonstrate the specificity of the interaction between Kid-1 and heteroduplex DNA, competition experiments were performed with the 13 zinc fingers of Kid-1 and a radiolabeled heteroduplex oligonucleotide containing the 25 nucleotide bubble. The shift was competed out by a 125-fold molar excess of the heteroduplex oligonucleotide with the 25 nucleotide bubble, whereas a homoduplex oligonucleotide and a single-stranded oligonucleotide of the same length had no effect on the shift (Fig.2 A). We then tested Kid-1 with a second heteroduplex DNA containing a 25-nucleotide bubble. This second heteroduplex consisted of single-stranded oligonucleotides ss3 and ss4, which were obtained by scrambling oligonucleotides ss1 and ss2, respectively. Incubation of the 13 zinc fingers of Kid-1 with this second large heteroduplex again resulted in an efficient shift (data not shown). To control for the role of the zinc fingers, we incubated the fusion protein between GST and the 13 zinc fingers of Kid-1 with a combination of EDTA, a divalent cation chelator, and 1,10-phenanthroline, a Zn2+-chelating agent, before performing a gel shift with heteroduplex DNA. This resulted in the complete abrogation of the shift. Prior incubation of the protein with an equal volume of ethanol, the solvent for 1,10-phenanthroline, did not influence binding of Kid-1 to heteroduplex DNA, thus again attesting to the specificity of the shift (Fig. 2 B). Another set of experiments was carried out to determine which portion of the Kid-1 zinc finger domain contributed to the shift. Fusion proteins between GST and the four-zinc finger cluster of Kid-1, between GST and the nine-zinc finger cluster, and between GST and the complete zinc finger domain of Kid-1 were used in gel shift assays with heteroduplex DNA containing a 25-nucleotide bubble. All three fusion proteins shifted the heteroduplex DNA (Fig.3), whereas no shift could be detected when the corresponding single-stranded oligonucleotides were used (data not shown). Kid-1 belongs to the zinc finger class of transcription factors, and we therefore wanted to know whether other zinc finger proteins and members of other classes of transcription factors also bound to heteroduplex DNA. The POU domain protein Oct-6 (25Suzuki N. Rohdewohld H. Neuman T. Gruss P. Schöler H.R. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3723-3732Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar) and the ets domain protein Ets-1 (26Sieweke M.H. Tekotte H. Frampton J. Graf T. Cell. 1996; 85: 49-60Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) bind to homoduplex DNA sequences of 8 nucleotides and 6 nucleotides in length, respectively. Neither protein, however, bound to heteroduplex DNA when examined in a gel shift assay (Fig. 4). The specificity of the shift by the Kid-1 zinc fingers was further demonstrated by the inability of another zinc finger structure, the RING finger domain of BRCA-1, to bind to heteroduplex DNA (data not shown). The Wilms' tumor protein WT1 also belongs to the family of Cys2His2-zinc finger proteins, it contains four zinc fingers at its COOH terminus. Several naturally occurring splice variants of WT1 have been described with different DNA binding specificities (for a recent review, see Reddy and Licht (27Reddy J.C. Licht J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1287: 1-28PubMed Google Scholar)). A binding site selection with the splice variant lacking the tripeptide KTS between the third and fourth zinc finger of WT1 resulted in the isolation of a binding site that closely resembles that of the immediate-early zinc finger protein Egr-1 (28Rauscher III, F.J. Morris J.F. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (465) Google Scholar). WT1, which does not belong to the subfamily of KRAB-zinc finger proteins, has been found to act as a transcriptional repressor in transient transfection experiments (e.g. Refs. 29Gashler A.L. Bonthron D.T. Madden S.L. Rauscher F.J. Collins T. Sukhatme V.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 10984-10988Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 30Madden S.L. Cook D.M. Morris J.F. Gashler A. Sukhatme V.P. Rauscher III, F.J. Science. 1991; 253: 1550-1553Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 31Wang Z.-Y. Qiu Q.-Q. Deuel T.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9172-9175Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When a fusion protein between GST and all four zinc fingers of WT1 was incubated with the Egr-1-binding site, a strong gel shift could be detected only with the splice variant lacking the tripeptide KTS between the third and fourth zinc finger, but not with the WT1+KTS form (Fig. 4). Surprisingly, both WT1−KTS and WT1+KTS bound strongly to heteroduplex DNA consisting of single-stranded oligonucleotides ss1 and ss2 (Fig. 4). Similar to Kid-1, WT1−KTS and WT1+KTS also bound strongly to the second large heteroduplex consisting of oligonucleotides ss3 and ss4 (data not shown). The specificity of those gel shifts was demonstrated by competition experiments. In the case of the WT1−KTS splice variant, successful competition was carried out with an excess of both unlabeled heteroduplex DNA and Egr-1-binding site (Fig.5, A and B). The gel shift of the heteroduplex DNA by WT1+KTS could only be competed by an excess of unlabeled heteroduplex DNA, but not Egr-1- binding site (Fig. 5 C). Binding of WT1−KTS and WT1+KTS to homoduplex DNA consisting of one of the oligonucleotides used in the heteroduplex DNA and a fully complementary oligonucleotide was very weak (data not shown). To define the structural requirements for the binding of WT1 to heteroduplex DNA, we made use of naturally occurring WT1 mutant proteins. Both a WT1+KTS mutant harboring a deletion of zinc finger 3 (32Haber D.A. Buckler A.J. Glaser T. Call K.M. Pelletier J. Sohn R.L. Douglass E.C. Housman D.E. Cell. 1990; 61: 1257-1269Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (494) Google Scholar) as well as a mutant protein with a missense mutation in zinc finger 3 found in a patient with Denys-Drash syndrome (R394W) showed decreased binding to heteroduplex DNA (Fig. 5 D). This suggests that zinc finger 3 is involved in this interaction. The results described above demonstrate for the first time the binding of a KRAB-zinc finger protein to DNA. Surprisingly, it is DNA structure that is recognized by Kid-1, because two unrelated heteroduplex DNAs with bubbles of 25 nucleotides are shifted with the same efficiency. Together with the finding that another transcriptional repressor protein, WT1, also binds to heteroduplex DNA without obvious sequence specificity, this represents an important new paradigm. Although this particular DNA structure, heteroduplex DNA, resembles the “transcription bubble,” which can be found when RNA polymerase II is transcribing a gene, it appears unlikely that the transcription bubble serves as the natural recognition site. Kid-1 bound only inefficiently to heteroduplex DNA with a 7-nucleotide bubble, a size that approximates the region of the transcription bubble not covered by RNA polymerase II. Further experiments are needed to clarify where those recognition sites are located in the nucleus and how they are recognized in addition to their structure.

We here report the identification of an enhancer in a functional human LIFR gene promoter and alternative promoter usage by this gene. A single transcription start site was identified in placental JEG-3 cells and a genomic clone containing 4876-nucleotide upstream sequences was found to have promoter activity in JEG-3 cells. However, in osteogenic sarcoma U-2 OS cell, Northern blot using a probe of the first exon detected in JEG-3 cells failed to detect LIFR transcripts. 5′-Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) revealed an alternative first exon and a 0.6-kilobase pair (kb) 5′-flanking region possessed promoter activity in U-2 OS cells. For the 4.8-kb promoter active in placental cells, a minimal promoter was localized within −162 nucleotides. Three regions increased and one inhibited promoter activity. Subcloning of an activation region (−4876 to −3453 nucleotides) into SV40 promoter either upstream or downstream in either orientation to the luciferase reporter resulted in 10–35-fold luciferase induction, demonstrating the characteristics of an enhancer. Transfections into nine cell lines of different tissue origin indicated that the cloned promoter and enhancer in the 4.8-kb fragment was placental tissue-specific. A 226-base pair fragment (−4625 to −4400 nucleotides) was further localized as the minimal enhancer region, in which deletion of either element A (−4625 to −4581 nucleotides) or element B (−4418 to −4400 nucleotides) resulted in the loss of enhancer activity. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed that these two elements bind to specific nuclear proteins individually. In the middle region between element A and B, disruption of enhancer integrity also led to a loss of enhancer activity, although two SP1 and three NF-κB/c-Rel binding sites did not contribute to enhancer function.

These findings underlie the critical biological function of the LIFR gene. However, the molecular mechanism of the expression and regulation of this gene is unknown because no LIFR gene promoter has been identified in any species. As a major step to understand LIFR transcriptional regulation, we isolated a human LIFR promoter functional in placental tissue, identified a placenta-specific upstream enhancer, and demonstrated alternative promoter usage by the human LIFR gene.DISCUSSIONLIFR is a widely expressed transcript, supporting the observed diverse functions of LIF in different tissues. However, in the human cell lines that we used for transfection studies, RT-PCR using LIFRS and LIFRAS were all able to generate the expected PCR product, while RT-PCR using primer LIFRR1S found in the first exon in JEG-3 cell and a primer downstream ATG initiation codon LIFR1AS (5′-CTTTTATTGTCCACCATCCAG-3′, 234–214 nt in reported sequence) could generate only the expected PCR products in two placental cells, JEG-3 and JAR cells, and in normal placental tissue. 2Z. Wang and S. Melmed, unpublished data. These RT-PCR results, together with transfection studies on different cells, indicate that the cloned functional LIFR promoter and enhancer is probably placental-specific. Furthermore, detection of an alternative promoter and the utilization of this alternative promoter by the LIFR gene also supports the placenta specificity of the characterized promoter and enhancer, whereas the alternative promoter appears to possess broader tissue activity.Transcription factor Sp1 and NF-κB have broad tissue distribution and have been found to be involved in many enhancer elements. For example, Sp1 contributes to the enhancer activity in fibroblast growth factor-4 gene (30Owczarek C.M. Layton M.J. Robb L.G. Nicola N.A. Begley C.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5495-5504Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), human adenosine deaminase gene (31Dailey L Yuan H. Basilico C. Mol. Cell.

Endocrinol. 1995; 9: 1477-1487PubMed Google Scholar), while members of the NF-κB family transcription factor are necessary for the enhancer activity of 3-′ IgH enhancer (33Michaelson J.S. Singh M. Snapper C.M. Sha W.C. Baltimore D. Birshtein B.K. J. Immunol. 1996; 156: 2828-2839PubMed Google Scholar), HIV-1 enhancer (34Pazin M.J. Sheridan P.L. Cannon K. Cao Z. Keck J.G. Kadonaga J.T. Jones K.A. Genes Dev. 1996; 10: 37-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar), and CD28RE enhancer in the IL-2 gene (35Lai J.H. Horvath G. Subleski J. Bruder I Ghosh P. Tan T.H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4260-4271Crossref PubMed Scopus (113) Google Scholar). In some cases, both Sp1 and NF-κB participate in activating enhancers; constitutively bound Sp1 and induced heterodimeric NF-κB give rise to maximal activity of the cytokine-inducible enhancer of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 gene (36Neish A.S. Khachigian L.M. Park A. Baichwal V.R. Collins T. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 28903-28909Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar), and Sp1 and NF-κB interact with HIV-1 enhancer activator (37Perkins N.D. Edwards N.L. Duckett C.S. Agranoff A.B. Schmid R.M. Nabel G.J. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3551-3558Crossref PubMed Scopus (399) Google Scholar). Specifically for placental tissue, a Sp1-like element was found to participate in the regulation of several pregnancy-specific glycoprotein (PSG) genes including PSG-3,PSG-5, PSG-6, and PSG-11 (38Chamberlin M.E. Lei K.J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17152-17159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).However, in the LIFR enhancer described here, although the enhancer does contain two Sp1 and three NF-κB/c-Rel binding sites (EMSA was also performed with JEG-3 crude extract and specific binding were observed for both Sp1 and NF-κB binding sequences, data not shown), these transcription factors do not play major roles in enhancer activity.Regulatory elements mediating enhanced expression of some placental genes have been reported. For the human chorionic gonadotropin α subunit gene, a composite enhancer was found located within the first 435 bp of the promoter for placenta-specific expression. This enhancer contains upstream regulatory element (URE), two tandem CREs, and CCAAT box (39Jameson J.L. Albanese C. Habener J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 16190-16196Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which URE is actually a composite of α ACT, trophoblast-specific element (TSE), and URE1 (40Pittman R.H. Clay C.M. Farmerie T.A. Nilson J.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 19360-19368Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), among which α ACT can bind to hGATA-2 and hGATA-3 (41Steger D.J. Hecht J.H. Mellon P.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 5592-5602Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), TSE/URE1 can bind to TSEB and UREB. For the human chorionic somatomammotropin gene, a placental-specific enhancer chorionic somatomammotropin, located about 3 kb downstream of the hCS-2 gene, contains multiple DNA elements observed in footprinting with corresponding proteins including TEF-1 interacting cooperatively (42Jacquemin P. Oury C. Peers Bl Morin A. Belayew A. Martial J.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 93-103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and more recently, human transcription factor TEF-5 has been shown to be important to regulate the hCS-B gene enhancer (43Jacquemin P. Martial J.A. Davidson I. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 12928-12937Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). Also, CRE, GATA, basic helix loop helix, and TSE have been found indispensable for the function of a 770-bp enhancer located −5.4 kb upstream of the murine adenosine deaminase gene in trophoblast cells of chorioallantoic placenta (44Shi D. Winston J.H. Blackburn M.R. Datta S.K. Hanten G. Kellems R.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2334-2341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 7, potential transcription factor binding sites in this LIFR enhancer region include CRE, GATA, HNF-3, Nkx25, Sp1, NF-κB, Oct-1, NF-1, E47, and Delta EF-1. Of these transcription factors, CRE and GATA have been implicated in placental-specific regulation mentioned above. No TSE motif was found. We have not yet made a more detailed analysis targeting these potential binding sites. Nevertheless, two novel elements A (−4625 to −4583 nt) and B (−4418 to −4400 nt) are found to be indispensable to LIFR enhancer activity. Data base searching could not correlate these two elements to known transcription factor binding sites, but these two elements demonstrated specific binding with nuclear proteins derived from JEG-3 cells, with element A showing two major specific bands and two minor bands in EMSA and element B showing one specific band in EMSA. Competition assay using four known consensus binding sequences for Sp1, AP1, NF-κB, and cAMP response element-binding protein confirmed their binding specificity. Furthermore, elements A and B could not compete with each other, showing that they are binding to different proteins. Those two major shifted complexes for element A and one shifted complex for element B have also been found to be detectable in U-2 and HeLa nuclear extracts (data not shown), implying that those corresponding proteins may not be unique to placenta. Considering that deletion of either element A or element B resulted in the total loss of enhancer activity, and disruption of the enhancer integrity by internal deletion also rendered the enhancer inactive, it is reasonable to conclude that binding proteins in this enhancer region do not contribute to enhancer activity separately. Rather, they probably cooperate with each other or with co-factors and allow the protein-protein interaction to permit enhancer activity.On the other hand, in this 226-bp enhancer region there is another 162 bp between element A and element B, in which two Sp1 and three NF-κB/c-Rel binding sites mentioned above were located. Although those Sp1 or NF-κB/c-Rel binding sites do not contribute to enhancer activity, internal deletion in this region disrupted the enhancer activity, possibly other transcription factor binding sites in this 162-bp region are necessary for enhancer activity.Interestingly, transfections have shown that this enhancer could also be placental specific because when placed upstream of an SV40 promoter, this enhancer was not active in several nonplacental cell lines tested including breast cancer, pituitary tumor, osteogenic sarcoma, cervix carcinoma, liver carcinoma, lung cancer, and thyroid carcinoma. The presence of functional placental-specific transcription factor(s) binding to this enhancer region will be a good hypothesis to explain the placental enhancer specificity.LIFR knockout mice have severe defects in placental organization (22Ware C.B. Horowitz M.C. Renshaw B.R. Hunt J.S. Liggitt D. Koblar S.A. Gliniak B.C. Mckenna H.J. Papayannopoulou T. Thoma B. Cheng L. Donovan P.J. Peschon J.J. Bartlett P.F. Willis C.R. Wright B.D. Carpenter M.K. Davison B.L. Gearing D.P. Development. 1995; 121: 1283-1299Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), showing the importance of LIFR in normal placental development. In mice, mLIFR mRNA expression level was shown to increase in placenta during pregnancy (45Kojima K. Kanazaki H. Iwai M. Hatayama H. Fujimoto M. Narukawa S. Higuchi T. Kaneko Y. Mori T. Fujita J. Hum. Reprod. 1995; 10: 1907-1911Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). In humans, LIFR mRNA also increases during the first trimester in placenta (46Tomida M. Yamaoto-Yamajuchi Y. Hozumi M. FEBS Lett. 1993; 334: 193-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). No explanation has yet been provided for these LIFR mRNA increases being restricted to placenta and or during pregnancy. With the discovery of functional placenta-specific LIFR enhancer described here, we hypothesize that in placenta and/or during pregnancy, placenta-specific transcription factor(s) are active and able to bind to the placenta-specific LIFR promoter and enhancer, leading to increased transcription of LIFR mRNA restricted to the placenta. An alternative LIFR gene promoter is active in a wide variety of nonplacental tissues, allowing nonplacental expression of LIFR and also supports the notion that LIFR possesses specific regulatory signals to regulate its expression and special functions in placenta. Cloning of this functional human LIFR promoter and enhancer has provided the basis to study the regulation of LIFR expression, and detailed analysis in the enhancer and promoter region will reveal further mechanisms for their demonstrated tissue specificity.

On the other hand, these cytokines also exhibit respective specific actions. For example, adult female LIF knockout mice are unable to implant embryos, resulting in infertility (6Escary J. Perreau J.

Oc-casionally, however, polymerase fidelity is too high or processiv-ity is too low to detect misincorporation under standard SCHconditions (defined by Poisson statistics as ,20% of p/t DNAextended). Greater quantities of p/t DNA can be exposed to SCHconditions by using trap DNA, which sequesters a polymeraseafter it dissociates from a p/t. Alternatively, the reaction can berun into MCH conditions. In this case, more p/t DNA is processedand the incorporation signal (gel bands at or beyond the targetsite) may even be enhanced at the expense of the unincorporatedsignal (gel band before the target site), but the interpretation ofthe band intensity ratios must be re-evaluated.This appendix is concerned with extending the SCH kineticanalysis to MCH conditions. Consequences of MCH are verydifferent for polymerases with and without exonuclease activ-ity and for incorporation of right and wrong nucleotides. Po-lymerases that lack exonuclease activity eventually incorpo-rate a nucleotide (right or wrong) opposite a target site on everyavailable p/t DNA. When incorporation is rare, as for the wrongnucleotide, the ratio of gel band intensities increases in propor-tion to the number of hits. When incorporation is frequent, asfor the right nucleotide, the ratio of band intensities increasesexponentially with the number of hits. Polymerases with exo-nuclease activity establish a steady state distribution betweenincorporation and nonincorporation after a second hit. Atsteady state the gel band intensity ratio is always greater thanfor SCH, but only to the extent that the polymerase refuses toexcise the nucleotide incorporated at the target site. For thewrong nucleotide the enhancement is generally less than afactor of two; for the right one it can be an order of magnitude.The conclusion is that MCH conditions can tractably and use-fully enhance the incorporation of wrong nucleotides, but arebest avoided (and generally unnecessary) for measuring incor-poration of a right nucleotide.The presentation follows. The first section reviews the orig-inal kinetic model and SCH analysis. The second section de-rives expressions for interpreting gel band intensity ratioscaused by multiple completed hits. This section has three parts:one on the case without exonuclease activity, one on the casewith exonuclease activity, and one on the effect of suppressingexonuclease activity with increased concentrations of next cor-rect (rescue) nucleotide. To apply the various MCH expressionsin the interpretation of experimental results, it is essential toaccount for the distribution in the number of hits across thepopulation of p/t DNA in a reaction. This is the topic of the thirdsection. The net result is a set of guidelines and correctionfactors for the practical application and interpretation of MCHconditions in the measurement of polymerase fidelity. Thefourth, and final, section summarizes the conclusions and em-phasizes the underlying assumptions."

We have recently reported that functional eukaryotic ribosomal particles can be reconstituted in vitro from free rRNA and ribosomal proteins (20Mangiarotti G. Chiaberge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 272: 19682-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar), as was shown almost 30 years ago for bacterial ribosomal subunits (21Traub P. Nomura N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1968; 59: 777-782Crossref PubMed Scopus (296) Google Scholar, 22Nomura N. Erdmann V. Nature. 1970; 228: 744-746Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). In the eukaryotic system that we have explored (Dictyostelium discoideum), as in Escherichia coli (23Mangiarotti G. Turco E. Perlo C. Altruda F. Nature. 1975; 253: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar), immature rRNA is a much better substrate for in vitro ribosome assembly. This is in agreement with the finding that in D. discoideum, as well as in E. coli (24Mangiarotti G. Turco E. Ponzetto A. Altruda F. Nature. 1974; 247: 147-149Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and yeast (25Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1412-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), ribosomal particles newly assembled in vivoapparently have a full complement of ribosomal proteins, but still contain immature rRNA. Furthermore, as shown for E. coli(26Turco E. Altruda F. Ponzetto A. Mangiarotti G. Biochemistry. 1974; 13: 4752-4757Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar), ribosomal particles of D. discoideum containing immature rRNA either reconstituted in vitro or newly assembled in vivo are fully functional in protein synthesis. These data indicate that although rRNA processing may be initiated before transcription is completed (27Greinger R.M. Maizels N. Cell. 1980; 20: 619-623Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), rRNA maturation occurs after (and not during) ribosomal subunit assembly. We have now analyzed some structural, functional, and metabolic properties of immature ribosomal subunits, and on the basis of the data reported here, we suggest that rRNA maturation is part of a mechanism by which cells control the functionality of newly assembled ribosomal particles before locking them in an irreversible configuration. Ribosomal particles that cannot function in protein synthesis because they are not assembled correctly do not undergo maturation of the RNA and are subsequently disassembled into their components.

Chem. 1977; 272: 19682-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar), we have shown that D. discoideum ribosomal 40 S and 60 S particles reconstituted in vitro from free rRNA and ribosomal proteins (or isolated from nuclei) and containing pre-17 S and pre-26 S rRNAs enter polyribosomes and synthesize polypeptides in an in vitro protein synthesis system as efficiently as cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits containing mature 17 S and 26 S rRNAs. The experiment shown in Table I (line 1) indicates that ribosomal particles newly assembled in vivoand still containing immature RNA join polyribosomes as soon as they enter the cytoplasm. Cells were removed from the growth medium, resuspended in Sorensen buffer, and labeled with [14C]uracil for 8 h (to label mature ribosomal particles) and then pulsed for 30 min with [3H]uracil (to label newly formed ribosomal particles) before being lysed. The3H/14C ratio in ribosomal subunits found free in the cytoplasm or bound to polyribosomes was the same. All of the14C label was in mature 17 S and 26 S rRNAs (besides 5 S and 5.8 S RNAs), whereas the 3H label was partially in immature pre-17 S and pre-26 S rRNAs and partially in mature 17 S and 26 S rRNAs. The ratio of 3H label in immature and mature rRNAs was the same in free ribosomal subunits and in polyribosomes and decreased in parallel during a period of chase with unlabeled uracil following the pulse with [3H]uracil (data not shown).Table IDistribution of [ 3 H] uracil and [ 14 C] uracil between immature and mature rRNAs[3H] Uracil[14C] UracilFree RNAIn free subunitsIn 80 S or polyribosomesIn free subunitsIn 80 S or polyribosomesIn free subunitsIn 80 S or polyribosomesPre-17 SPre-26 SPre-17 S17 SPre-17 S17 SPre-26 S26 SPre-26 S26 S17 S26 S17 S16 Scpm × 10 −3cpm × 10 −31.0031526282.54.597132.005.92.51.84.210.64.53.37.759.13.17.53.007.500013.500048.5004.0070.31.22.613.20.72.35.73.87.97.114.25.00105.202.3010.101.11.9510.16.000.22.40.17.10.14.40.114.124.312.421.37.005.501010.302.108.715.31.22.58.006.400013.1000714.20.10.19.006.60201203.506.512.71.8410.005.20.10010.50005.211.10.30.611.004.80.12.70.280.32.40.12.75.4310.812.000.14.902.95.90.32.50.22.45.23.19.913.000.15.10.13.25.10.23.10.12.14.75.412.214.000.25.20.23.44.70.33.30.11.945.71215.000.25.20.23.70.14.70.23.41.74.23.59.116.0021.13.51.83.92.16.93.81.22.12.94.417.3.374.31.90.11.83.92.203.91.12.12.34.418.004.10.10.1080.10.10.119.47.90.10000.10.10020.080.51.80.1300.10.1021.000.32.10.23.80.10.20.18.222.003.30.100800023.3.98.1100.50.41.10.30.2024.000.30.80.12.30.81.80.34.71.22.34.28.525.0.20.50.30.80.120.91.90.34.21.22.34.28.726.001.103.302.106.7027.3.46.810001.100.1028.0002.404.50408.129.0002.404.504.108.1 Open table in a new tab When D. discoideum cells are removed from the growth medium and shaken in Sorensen buffer, polyribosomes suddenly disappear (32Firtel R.A. Jacobson A. Tichman J. Lodish H.F. Genetics. 1974; 78: 355-372Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). All pre-existing ribosomal particles are found as 80 S monosomes or free ribosomal subunits depending on the Mg2+ concentration used in the sucrose gradient analysis. Protein synthesis resumes, and polyribosomes reappear after ∼30 min. In this interval of time, rRNA synthesis and ribosome formation continue, presumably utilizing a pool of pre-existing ribosomal proteins (30Mangiarotti G. Altruda F. Lodish H.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1980; 1: 35-42Crossref Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 33Mangiarotti G. Hames B.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1979; 119: 428-432Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar). This allows a pool of newly formed ribosomal subunits to accumulate in the cytoplasm without entering polyribosomes. In the experiment shown in Table I (line 2), cells were labeled with [14C]uracil for 16 h during growth, pulsed for 10 min with [3H]uracil at the time of starvation, and chased for 20 min with unlabeled uracil to prevent further entry of labeled ribosomal subunits into the cytoplasm. Cells were collected and lysed as soon as protein synthesis resumed (as monitored by the incorporation of [35S]methionine/cysteine into hot trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material). The 3H/14C ratio in ribosomal subunits found free in the cytoplasm and in polyribosomes was the same, confirming that newly formed subunits enter polyribosomes with the same efficiency as pre-existing particles; in contrast, 70% of the 3H label in free subunits was in pre-17 S and pre-26 S rRNAs, and 30% was in mature 17 S and 26 S RNAs, whereas the opposite was true in ribosomal subunits found in polyribosomes. An even more striking difference in the distribution of the3H label between mature and immature RNA molecules in free and polyribosome-bound ribosomal subunits was observed when the same experiment was repeated in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors to permit precise determination of the time at which polyribosome formation resumed. When pactamycin, a drug that blocks the movement of 40 S subunits from the 5′-end of an mRNA molecule to the first AUG codon, was added to the starved cell suspension, no polyribosomes re-formed. Under these conditions, all of the 3H label added to the cell suspension at the time of starvation and found in cytoplasmic 40 S and 60 S ribosomal particles 30 min later was in pre-17 S and pre-26 S rRNAs (Table I, line 3); but if pactamycin was removed 5 min before cell lysis, polyribosomes re-formed. Under these conditions (Table I, line 4), 95% of the 3H label present in free cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits was in pre-17 S and pre-26 S rRNAs, whereas ∼30% of the 3H label present in ribosomal subunits derived from polyribosomes was in immature rRNAs, and 70% was in mature rRNAs. The same results were obtained when cycloheximide, a drug that blocks peptide bond formation, was added to the cell suspension instead of pactamycin. In the presence of cycloheximide, only 80 S ribosomes and no polyribosomes re-formed after 30 min of incubation, and no rRNA maturation occurred (the data are not shown since the electrophoretic pattern obtained was identical to the one summarized in Table I, line 4). These findings indicate that rRNA maturation occurs neither in free native ribosomal subunits nor even in 80 S ribosomes newly bound to mRNA (34Mangiarotti G. Schlessinger D. J. Mol. Biol. 1967; 29: 395-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 35Kaempfer R. Nature. 1970; 228: 534-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), but in polyribosomes. As we have previously shown (20Mangiarotti G. Chiaberge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 272: 19682-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar), 40 S and 60 S ribosomal subunits isolated from nuclei and containing immature rRNA synthesize polypeptides and form polyribosomes in anin vitro protein synthesis system with the same efficiency as cytoplasmic ribosomal subunits containing mature rRNA. Table I(lines 5 and 6) shows that after immature particles had functioned in protein synthesis, immature rRNA was converted into mature rRNA. If poly(A)+ RNA was omitted from the in vitrosystem (Table I, line 7) or if pactamycin (line 8) or cycloheximide (line 9) was added to the in vitro system, no rRNA maturation occurred. To determine whether rRNA maturation occurs randomly during functioning of immature particles in protein synthesis or whether it requires the productive movement of ribosomes over a certain length of the mRNA molecule, poly(A)+ RNA was replaced in the in vitro protein synthesis system by the mRNA encoded by a singleD. discoideum gene (AC914), the sequence of which has been determined. 2A. Ceccarelli, personal communication. Immature ribosomal particles were incubated in the in vitro protein synthesis system in the presence of 19 amino acids, with the exclusion of a different single amino acid in different trials. Puromycin, a drug that causes dissociation of polyribosomes into free ribosomal subunits (36Schlessinger D. Mangiarotti G. Apirion D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1967; 58: 1782-1786Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), was also added; at a low concentration (30 μg/ml), puromycin allows the formation of small polyribosomes and the synthesis of short polypeptides and causes recycling of the ribosomal particles between polyribosomes and the pool of free subunits even in the absence of a stop codon in the mRNA used to program the protein synthesis system. 3G. Mangiarotti, unpublished observation. When methionine or leucine (the first 2 amino acids incorporated into the polypeptide encoded by AC914 mRNA) was omitted, rRNA maturation did not occur (Table I, lines 10 and 11); but when phenylalanine, the third amino acid to be incorporated, was omitted, pre-17 S RNA was converted into 17 S RNA, whereas pre-26 S RNA did not mature (line 12). The same result was observed when lysine or asparagine, the fifth and sixth amino acids to be incorporated, was omitted (Table I, lines 13 and 14) (the fourth amino acid is again leucine). Finally, if arginine, the seventh amino acid, was omitted, the conversion of pre-26 S RNA into 26 S RNA also occurred (Table I, line 15). If cells are washed from the growth medium and resuspended in Sorensen buffer in the presence of pactamycin (to avoid the entry of newly formed immature3H-labeled ribosomal subunits into 80 S ribosomes) and, 30 min later, pactamycin is removed and replaced by cycloheximide, the fate of 3H-labeled ribosomal particles that form 80 S ribosomes can be followed and compared with the fate of mature ribosomal particles that have been previously labeled with ]14C]uracil during growth and that have already functioned in protein synthesis. Table I (lines 16 and 17) shows that whereas the 14C-labeled particles were stable for at least 30 min, the 3H label progressively disappeared from 80 S ribosomes. All of the 3H label lost from 80 S ribosomes appeared as free pre-17 S and pre-26 S RNAs in the cytosol. Since, in the presence of pactamycin, immature ribosomal particles are stable, two conditions appear to be required for their disassembly: they must form 80 S ribosomes, but be prevented from functioning in protein synthesis. A similar result has been obtained in the in vitro protein synthesis system programmed with AC914 mRNA. When immature3H-labeled ribosomal particles were incubated in the presence of 19 amino acids, but in the absence of methionine, they were stable (Table I, line 18). If methionine was present, but leucine was omitted, both 40 S and 60 S particles progressively disappeared, and the label was transferred to free pre-17 S and pre-26 S RNA molecules (Table I, line 19). If the omitted amino acid was phenylalanine, 40 S particles remained stable, but 60 S particles were disassembled (TableI, line 20). Finally, if the omitted amino acid was arginine, both 40 S and 60 S particles remained stable (Table I, line 21). Thus, the signals that induce rRNA maturation and that prevent ribosomal particles engaged in protein synthesis from being disassembled appear to coincide. Some ribosomal proteins could easily be separated from the others by washing ribosomal subunits in 1.5 m NH4Cl (proteins S2 to S6 and L1 to L5, according to the nomenclature used in Ref. 37Ramagopal S. Ennis H. Eur. J. Biochem. 1980; 105: 245-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If the remaining proteins were extracted and used to reconstitute ribosomal particles with pre-17 S and pre-26 S RNAs (besides 5 S and 5.8 S RNAs), the reconstituted particles sedimented as 40 S and 60 S in a sucrose gradient, but could not form 80 S ribosomes when incubated in thein vitro protein synthesis system. The particles were stable over the 30-min period of incubation (Table I, line 22). If the NH4Cl wash was added to these particles in the reconstitution buffer, the missing proteins were incorporated into the particles, as determined by gel electrophoretic analysis (data not shown). The resulting 40 S and 60 S subunits could form 80 S ribosomes, but not polyribosomes, when incubated in the in vitroprotein synthesis system. No incorporation of [35S]cysteine was observed during the incubation. Since these subunits contained a full complement of ribosomal proteins and these proteins had been derived from ribosomes that had functionedin vivo in protein synthesis and therefore were normal, their inability to function in protein synthesis must be due to some degree of misassembly induced by the order of addition of the proteins during the reconstitution process. Interestingly, the misassembled particles were lost from 80 S ribosomes during the 30-min period of incubation and were disassembled into free pre-17 S and pre-26 S RNAs and free ribosomal proteins (Table I, line 23). To determine whether disassembly of newly formed ribosomal particles occurs spontaneously in vivo, cells labeled with [14C]uracil during growth were removed from the growth medium and labeled by a 10-min pulse of [3H]uracil, followed by a 20-min period of chase with unlabeled uracil. At this time, most of the labeled ribosomal particles were found in polyribosomes, but ∼10% of the 3H-labeled rRNA progressively disappeared from polyribosomes (Table I, lines 24 and 25). It was not converted into mature 17 S and 26 S rRNAs, but appeared as free pre-17 S and pre-26 S RNAs in the cytosol. Thus, ∼10% of the newly formed ribosomal particles were disassembled after their entry into polyribosomes. The results reported above suggest that ribosomal subunits can be disassembled after they have formed 80 S ribosomes if they contain immature RNA, but cannot if they contain mature RNA. This suggests that mature ribosomal particles possess a more stable structure than immature particles. In line with this hypothesis is the finding (not shown) that 40 S and 60 S ribosomal particles reconstituted in vitro with immature rRNA or isolated from nuclei are unfolded into slowly sedimenting particles (25 S and 35 S, respectively) when centrifuged through sucrose gradients in salt conditions (for example, 0.5 mm MgCl2 and 0.2 m NaCl) in which the same particles sediment as 40 S and 60 S after they have been incubated in an in vitroprotein synthesis system and their RNAs have matured. rRNA maturation and conversion of immature ribosomal subunits into irreversibly stable organelles appear to occur simultaneously and to be triggered by the same signals, the formation of the first peptide bond or the first translocation event for the 40 S particles and the formation of a peptidyl-tRNA chain containing at least 6 amino acids for the 60 S particles. Are these events interdependent or only concomitant? To try to answer this question, we made use of two oligonucleotides complementary to sequences present in the 5′-ends of pre-17 S and pre-26 S RNAs, but absent in mature 17 S and 26 S RNAs (38Ozaki T. Hosikawa Y. Ida Y. Iwabuchi M. Nucleic Acids Res. 1984; 12: 4171-4184Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The two oligonucleotides bind to 40 S and 60 S particles isolated from nuclei, but not to particles isolated from polyribosomes. When immature particles with the bound oligonucleotide were incubated in an in vitro protein synthesis system, they synthesized polypeptides and formed polyribosomes, but their rRNAs did not mature. The particles were progressively lost from polyribosomes and converted into free rRNA and protein molecules (Table I, lines 26 and 27). Thus, if rRNA maturation is prevented, ribosomal particles are disassembled after their entry into polyribosomes, although they are capable of synthesizing proteins. In a complementary experiment, immature ribosomal particles with the bound oligonucleotides were incubated briefly with RNase H to digest the DNA-RNA hybrid sequences. Following this treatment, pre-17 S and pre-26 S RNAs were converted into molecules that comigrated with mature 17 S and 26 S rRNAs during electrophoresis on nondenaturing gels, although the 5′-ends of the in vitro trimmed RNA species and of those matured in vivo did not coincide, as determined by primer extension analysis (data not shown). The particles containingin vitro shortened pre-RNA molecules could form 80 S ribosomes when incubated in an in vitro protein synthesis system, but were incapable of forming large polyribosomes and of synthesizing polypeptides, due probably to the abnormal 5′ termini of the rRNA molecules. However, 80 S ribosomes were stable and were not disassembled over the 30-min incubation time (Table I, lines 28 and 29). Thus, rRNA maturation mimicked in vitro was sufficient to render ribosomal particles resistant to disassembly, although they had not functioned in protein synthesis. rRNA maturation is therefore probably the event triggered by functioning of ribosomal particles in protein synthesis, and in turn, it determines the stabilization of ribosomal particles. The results reported in this paper indicate that in D. discoideum, rRNA maturation occurs after the newly formed ribosomal subunits have entered the cytoplasm and joined polyribosomes. This finding is consistent with previous indications that in E. coli, immature rRNA can be found in 30 S and 50 S subunits present in polyribosomes (24Mangiarotti G. Turco E. Ponzetto A. Altruda F.

FEBS Lett. 1978; 93: 348-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar); that in yeast, 40 S particles containing immature rRNA can be found in the cytoplasm (25Udem S.A. Warner J.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 1412-1416Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar); and that in D. discoideum, immature ribosomal subunits can form polyribosomes in an in vitro protein synthesis system (20Mangiarotti G. Chiaberge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 272: 19682-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The fact that in yeast and in other eukaryotes, immature rRNA has not been detected in polyribosomes does not exclude the possibility that in these organisms, immature ribosomal subunits enter polyribosomes since if rRNA maturation occurs immediately after this event, immature rRNA would not accumulate at a detectable level. The entry of immature ribosomal subunits into polyribosomes is not a casual, but an obligatory step in their metabolism. Experiments carried out both in vivo and in vitro indicate that if newly formed ribosomal particles do not function in protein synthesis, their rRNAs do not mature. The use of a protein synthesis system programmed by a single species of cellular mRNA has shown that rRNA maturation is subordinated to the ability of the ribosomal particles to perform specific steps in the process of polypeptide synthesis. 40 S particles must become part of an 80 S ribosome capable of catalyzing the synthesis of a first peptide bond or of undergoing a first translocation step, and 60 S particles must participate in the synthesis of a peptidyl chain at least 6 amino acids long. Since these results have been obtained by testing only one mRNA, they cannot be generalized, but they indicate that rRNA maturation is not triggered generically by the involvement of ribosomal particles in the process of protein synthesis, but by specific signals, which arise when the interaction of ribosomal particles with the other components of the protein synthesis machinery has reached certain stages, for the precise definition of which further experiments will be needed. Immature ribosomal particles have a less stable conformation than mature particles, as shown by the fact that they are more easily unfolded in unfavorable salt conditions. However, as long as immature particles remain as free subunits either in the cell cytoplasm or in anin vitro protein synthesis system, they survive as such. When they enter polyribosomes, they must perform some steps in protein synthesis, otherwise they are disassembled into free immature rRNA and ribosomal proteins. The use of oligonucleotides complementary to the 5′-ends of pre-17 S and pre-26 S RNAs to block or to mimic their maturation in vitro has shown that the initial event triggered by functioning of ribosomal subunits is the maturation of their RNAs and that it is this event that leads to the stabilization of their structure. The disassembly of newly formed ribosomal particles appears to be a relatively frequent event in vivo. The possibility of causing misassembly of the particles in the in vitroreconstitution process has allowed us to show that ribosome misassembly may be a cause of their lack of ability to function in protein synthesis and of the consequent persistence of immature rRNA. This in turn leads to the disassembly of the particles. If the frequency ofin vivo disassembly of newly formed particles is taken as an indication of the frequency of incorrect ribosome assembly, the phenomenon appears to occur relatively often in D. discoideum. It is thus reasonable to presume that cells have evolved a mechanism to prevent the consequences of these mistakes. Entry of a non-functional or poorly functional particle into a polyribosome will lead to its sequestration as a nonfunctional structure. If this event were frequent, cells would be severely depleted of mRNA molecules and functional ribosomes and might accumulate significant amounts of uncompleted polypeptide chains. Disassembly can eliminate misassembled ribosomal particles and lead to recycling of their components for the assembly of other ribosomes. On the other hand, if ribosomal particles were subjected to disassembly before entering polyribosomes, they could not be tested for their ability to function in protein synthesis. Thus, it is not surprising that their disassembly can occur only in polyribosomes. If our hypothesis is correct, there are at least two roles that rRNA processing in several steps, rather than in a single step, might have in ribosome formation. First, the extra sequences present in immature rRNA facilitate the assembly of ribosomal proteins on the RNA molecules (20Mangiarotti G. Chiaberge S. J. Biol. Chem. 1977; 272: 19682-19687Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 23Mangiarotti G. Turco E. Perlo C. Altruda F. Nature. 1975; 253: 569-571Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). However, this process leads to the formation of a relatively unstable reversible structure. rRNA maturation then occurs, leading to the conversion of the particle into an irreversible complex only if the initial immature rRNA-protein complex proves to be structurally correct and functional in protein synthesis. Since rRNA maturation and ribosomal particle stabilization can be reproduced in vitroin a protein synthesis-dependent process, dissection of thein vitro system should allow the determination of the factors involved in the quality control mechanism of ribosome assembly.

This result is consistent with the lack of sequence differences in this segment located at contact sites implicated in the HbS polymer. In contrast, the α-(31–141) segment of mouse α-chain with three sequence differences at the implicated contact sites (α48, α78, and α116; see Ref. 9Watowich S. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) inhibited the βS-dependent polymerization significantly (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, the inhibition was considerably lower than that of mouse α-chain. Hence, the inhibitory potential of the two segments of mouse α-chain, taken individually, did not account for the inhibitory potential of intact mouse α-chain. Therefore, thecomplementarity of the sequence differences of the two segments of mouse α-chain is indispensable to inhibit maximally the βS-dependent polymerization reaction. In addition, conformational complementarity of the sequence differences of the two segments seems to facilitate the preservation of a human-like oxygen affinity in the mouse α2βS2 chimeric Hb (8Roy R.P. Nacharaju P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Such complementarity is apparently lost in the human-mouse chimeric α-chain, in which the α-(1–30) segment of the mouse is replaced by that of human α-chain (8Roy R.P. Nacharaju P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Protein Chem. 1995; 14: 81-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). One approach to dissect the molecular basis of the inhibition of polymerization by mouse α-chain is to introduce the individual sequence differences of the mouse α-chain into human α-chain by site directed mutagenesis. However, this approach might not provide information on the synergistic influence of the sequence differences of the mouse α-chain. An alternative approach is to establish the synergy of the sequence differences in terms of their inhibitory potential, in a structural linkage map. The location of the mouse α-chain sequence differences in the three dimensional structure of HbS is such that 7 of the 19 sequence differences are located in the area of AB/GH corner (Table I). Inasmuch as solution studies have identified Wishner-Love double strand as the assembly unit of the HbS polymer (3Nagel R.L. Johnson J. Bookchin R.L. Garel M.C. Rosa J. Scilioro G. Wajcman H. Labie D. Moo-Penn W. Castro O. Nature. 1980; 283: 832-834Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), it is legitimate to use the crystal structure of deoxyHbS to locate intra-double strand contact sites. Sites α16, α20, α23, and α116 comply with this characteristic and, in addition, are in spatial proximity despite the fact they are widely separated in the primary sequence (10Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). One of the sequence differences (α78), involved in an inter-double strand contact site (supported by high resolution electron microscopy and image reconstruction is located in the EF corner and is in close proximity to the other contact sites. Thus, 12 out of the 19 sequence differences of the mouse α-chain are concentrated in two domains of α-chain that are involved in the intermolecular interactions of deoxyHbS fiber.Table ISequence differences of mouse and horse α-chains as compared to human α-chainSequence (helix)HumanMouseHorseImplicated contact siteSolution studiesModel studies4 (A2)ProGlyAla5 (A3)AlaGlu8 (A6)ThrSer10 (A8)Val15 (A13)GlySer*17 (A15)ValIle19 (AB1)AlaGlyGly21 (B2)AlaGly22 (B3)GlyAla34 (B15)LeuAla*35 (B16)SerGly48 (CD6)LeuVal**57 (E6)GlyAla*63 (E12)AlaGly67 (E16)ThrAla68 (E17)AsnLeu**70 (E19)ValAla71 (E20)AlaGlyGly73 (EF2)ValLeuLeu76 (EF5)MetLeuLeu78 (EF7)AsnGlyGly**82 (F3)AlaAsp*85 (F6)AspAsn107 (G14)ValSer111 (G18)AlaSerVal113 (GH1)LeuHis115 (GH3)AlaAsn*116 (GH4)GluAspAsp**130 (H13)AlaSerAsterisk (*) indicates the sites in human α-chain implicated as contact sites of HbS fiber either by solution studies or by molecular modelling studies. Open table in a new tab Asterisk (*) indicates the sites in human α-chain implicated as contact sites of HbS fiber either by solution studies or by molecular modelling studies. To dissect the inhibitory potential of the partial murinization of human α-chain and construct a structural linkage map, we propose to screen the amino acid sequence of available vertebrate α-chains and select those that contain identical or nearly identical sequence as in mouse α-chain. Such α-chains could be hybridized with βS to generate a chimeric HbS having a set of overlapping sequence differences. Moreover, in an added step, by preparing chimeric α-chains, the sequence differences between the parent α-chain and the test α-chain could be further reduced. We have chosen horse α-chain for such a study. Horse α-chain has 18 sequence differences as compared with human α-chain (11Ladner R.C. Air G.M. Fogg J.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1976; 103: 675-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Most of the sequence differences (15 out of 18) of horse α-chain are located in the α-(31–141) region of the chain (Table I). Of these 18 sequence differences, 8 are located at the same sites of the chain as in mouse α-chain. Therefore, a comparison of the inhibitory potential of horse α-chain with that of mouse α-chain will provide information about the contribution of these common sequence differences in the inhibition. Of the eight common site-sequence differences between mouse and horse α-chains, six are located in the α-(31–141) segment of the chain (Table I). Four of these are located in the EF corner, an area implicated in the inter-double strand interactions of the deoxyHbS fiber. Therefore, by segregating the sequence differences of horse α-chain into α-(1–30) and α-(31–141) segments, the inhibitory potential of sequence differences of these two segments and possibly the contribution of the sequence differences common between the mouse and horse α-chains could be evaluated. Accordingly, the α-(1–30) and α-(31–141) segments of horse α-chain have been exchanged with that of human α-chain by the V8 protease-catalyzed semisynthetic approach to generate horse-human chimeric α-chains (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 12Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Horse and mouse (C57BL/10) α-globins were separated from their respective purified hemoglobins by CM 52-urea chromatography (13Clegg J.B. Naughton M.A. Weatherall D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1966; 19: 91Crossref PubMed Scopus (1142) Google Scholar) and were hybridized with βS by alloplex intermediate pathway into the respective interspecies hybrids (12Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar, 14Yip Y.K. Waks M. Beychok S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci., U. S. A. 1977; 74: 64Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Briefly, α-globin was mixed with βS after generating -SH groups on the chain, to form half-filled tetramers. Then hemin cyanide was added to generate the met form of the tetramer. The Met form is reduced with dithionite to generate oxyHbA. The chimeric α-chains of horse (α-(1–30)) and human (α-(31–141)), human (α-(1–30)) and horse (α-(31–141)), horse (α-(1–30)) and mouse (α-(31–141)), and mouse (α-(1–30)) and horse (α-(31–141)) were generated by the V8protease-mediated semisynthesis of α-globin at pH 6.0 in 30%n-propanol (12Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). These chimeric α-chains were reconstituted with βS by the same Alloplex intermediate pathway to generate the tetramer. All the hybrids were purified on CM-cellulose columns as described by Roy and Acharya (12Roy R.P. Acharya A.S. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 231: 194Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). The oxygen affinity of all hemoglobin hybrids was determined at a protein concentration of 0.5 mm, in 50 mmBis-Tris acetate, pH 7.4 at 37 °C, using a Hem-O-Scan (Aminco). The polymerization of the hemoglobin hybrids was studied in 2.0m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 at 30 °C. The kinetics of polymerization has been followed using the method described by Adachi and Asakura (15Adachi K. Asakura T. J. Biol. Chem. 1979; 254: 7765-7771Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, an aliquot of hemoglobin hybrid was added to the deoxygenated 2.0 m phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing dithionite at 0 °C and the concentration of deoxyhemoglobin was determined spectrophotometrically at 555 nm. The polymerization was initiated by a temperature jump from 0 °C to 30 °C. The kinetics of the formation of turbidity was monitored at 700 nm. At the end of the polymerization, the sample was spun at 9000 rpm for 20 min at 30 °C. The solubility of the deoxyhemoglobin hybrid was determined from the concentration of the hybrid in the supernatant at the same temperature. The molecular modeling was carried out on an Indigo II workstation from Silicon Graphics using the software package Insight II from Molecular Simulations, Inc. The amino acid replacements were done using the Biopolymer Module in Insight II. Side-chain torsions were adjusted to explore the possibilities of hydrogen bonds or ionic interactions as well as to enhance the presentation of the figure. The homogeneity of the hybrid species of Hb containing βS and either horse α-chain or its chimeric form has been established by their chromatographic behavior on CM-cellulose columns (Fig.1), isoelectric focusing (Fig. 1,inset), and the reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography analysis of their globin chains. The isoelectric focusing patterns of the tetramers are consistent with the results of CM-cellulose chromatography. The oxygen affinity of the hybrids has been investigated to ascertain the intactness of basic Hb fold in the βS hybrids containing either horse α-chain or the chimeric chains derived from human and horse α-chain. The P 50 values of βS hybrids of horse α-chain are comparable to that of HbS (Table II). The cooperativity of the tetramers with the chimeric α-chains is also comparable to that of HbS. Horse α-chain has 18 sequence differences as compared with human α-chain (TableI). Despite these many sequence differences, horse α-chain hybridizes with βS to generate a tetramer that has ligand binding properties equivalent to that of HbS (Table II). Therefore, the horse α-chain appears to be functionally equivalent to human α-chain.Table IIOxygen affinity of chimeric hemoglobins with nonhuman or chimeric α-chainsChimeric hemoglobinsP 50Hill coefficientα2Hβ2S4.52.5α2Hrβ2S4.52.3α2HrHβ2S4.72.3α2HHrβ2S4.32.3α2HrMβ2S3.42.3α2MHrβ2S3.72.3α2Mβ2S4.52.4The oxygen affinity of the hybrids has been determined in triplicates at a hemoglobin concentration of 0.5 mm in 50 mm Bis-Tris acetate, pH 7.4, 37 °C, using Hem-O-Scan. The P 50 values were within 0.2 units and the Hill coefficient did not vary by more than 0.1 unit. All values were determined during the oxygenation of the deoxy sample.

The hybrid containing horse α-chain and βS(α2Hrβ2S) polymerized with a delay time greater than HbS (Fig.2), demonstrating the propensity of the horse α-chain to inhibit the βS-dependent polymerization. The solubility of the hybrid (an equilibrium measurement) was about 5-fold higher than HbS (Fig.3).Figure 3Solubility of the deoxy form of hemoglobin hybrids as a function of initial Hb concentration.

The solubility assays were carried out in duplicates or at times in triplicates. The bars indicate the type of α-chain present in the Hb hybrid. Open bar, filled bar,filled-open bar, and open-filled bar represent the human α-chain, horse α-chain, horse (α-(1–30)) plus human (α-(31–141)), and human (α-(1–30)) plus horse (α-(31–141)) chimeric α-chains, respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The hybrid containing horse α-(1–30)-human α-(31–141) chimeric α-chain (α2HrHβ2S) exhibited a delay time of polymerization very close to that of HbS. Therefore, the intrinsic inhibitory potential of horse α-(1–30) is very low. The inhibitory potential of this segment could be seen only when the kinetics of polymerization was carried out at a very low protein concentration (Fig. 2, inset). The solubility of α2HrHβ2S was only slightly higher than HbS (Fig. 3). The three sequence differences present in α-(1–30) segment of horse α-chain (as compared with the human α-chain) contributed very little to the inhibitory effect. In contrast, the solubility of α2HHrβ2S was considerably higher than α2HrHβS2, demonstrating that the sequence differences of α(31–141) segment of horse α-chain represent the major contribution to the inhibitory potential of horse α-chain. However, the solubility of α2HHrβS2 was only about 60% of α2Hrβ2S. Thus, although the horse α-(1–30) segment by itself exhibited very little inhibitory potential, the complementarity of the sequence differences of this region with those of the horse α-(31–141) segment, imparted additional polymerization potential to the tetramer. The logarithmic plot of reciprocal delay time of polymerizationversus Hb concentration was linear for all these hybrids (Fig. 4). The slopes (n) of these plots were 2.1, 2.2, 3.2, and 3.2 for α2Hβ2S, α2HrHβ2S, α2HHrβ2S, and α2Hrβ2S, respectively. The difference in nucleation number (n) for these hybrids may reflect the difference in the mechanism of polymerization (16Bihoreau M.T. Baudin V. Marden M. Lacaze N. Bohn B. Kister J. Schaad O. Dumoulin A. Edelstein S.J. Poyart C. Pagnier J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 145-150Google Scholar). Thus, the sequence differences present in the α-(31–141) segment of horse α-chain contribute toward an increase in the nucleation number. This result is similar to that obtained with mouse α-chain, with the exception that the sequence differences present in mouse α-(1–30) segment also resulted in a noticeable increase in the nucleation number. Such changes in the nucleation number can be considered as a reflection of the flexibility in the pathway of the assembly of the polymer from the tetramers containing the βS. What is the molecular basis of the inhibitory potential of the horse α-chain ? Out of 18 sequence differences of horse α-chain, 3 are located in the 1–30 region: α4, α15, and α19. Sites α4 and α15 are implicated as contact sites, respectively, in the Edelstein model (17Cretegny I. Edelstein S.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 230: 733Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and by solution studies (reviewed in Ref. 10Eaton W.A. Hofrichter J. Adv. Protein Chem. 1990; 40: 63-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar). The substitution of Ala for Pro at α4 could alter the flexibility of A-helix, but the substitutions at α15 and α19 are conservative (Table I). Therefore, the horse α-(1–30) should exhibit very little inhibitory potential and our results are consistent with this analysis. Horse α-(31–141) has 15 sequence differences compared with human; six of these are located at α57, α68, α78, α82, α115, and α116, the sites that have been implicated as contact residues by solution or molecular modeling studies (Table I). The Ala → Asp at α82 clearly could alter the contact site, but all other sites have conservative substitutions in terms of charge. Nonetheless, the bulkiness of the side chains of these substitutions could perturb the interactions involved in the polymerization. Thus, the horse α-(31–141) segment is likely to make a major contribution to the inhibitory potential of horse α-chain. The inhibitory potential of horse α-(31–141) accounts only for about 60% of that of the full-length horse α-chain. Intriguingly, the remaining 40% of the inhibitory potential is not associated with the α-(1–30) segment of the horse α-chain. Hence, the complementation of the sequence differences of the two segments of the horse α-chain endows a higher polymerization inhibitory potential to the full-length α-chain. This represents a synergy of the sequence differences of the complementary segments of horse α-chain to generate additional polymerization inhibitory potential to the full-length chain, and this phenomenon is reminiscent of the results obtained previously on the generation of chimeric α-chains from mouse α-chain (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The inhibitory potential of the horse α-chain is considerably lower than that of mouse α-chain. The hybrids of mouse α-chain and βS exhibit a solubility that is 8 times higher than HbS (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mouse α-chain has 19 sequence differences as compared with human α-chain (Table I). Eight of these sequence differences are located at the same sites as in horse α-chain (α4, α19, α71, α73, α76, α78, α111, and α116). Six of these sites have the same amino acid substitutions in both the chains (α19, α71, α73, α76, α78, and α116). Eight common sequence differences (between the horse and the mouse α-chains) are, apparently, not solely responsible for the high inhibitory potential of mouse α-chain. Alternately, the horse α-chain has sequence differences that favor the polymerization reaction and thus neutralize in part the polymerization inhibitory potential of the eight common sequence differences between the mouse and the horse α-chains. That the sequence differences of α-(31–141) segments common to mouse and horse α-chain contribute to the inhibitory potential of the two segments is supported by the following points. (i) Most of the contact site-sequence differences of horse α-chain are also located in the α-(31–141) region consistent with the high inhibitory potential of this region. Out of eight common sequence differences between mouse and horse α-chains, six are located in the α-(31–141) (9, 18, 19,). (ii) The polymerization inhibitory potential of horse α-(31–141) is comparable to that of mouse α-(31–141). (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mouse α-(1–30) segment does not have any sequence differences at the inter molecular contact sites of HbS. However, this segment exhibits a significant amount of polymerization inhibitory potential (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the inhibitory potential of mouse α-(1–30) is higher than that of horse α-(1–30), as reflected by the solubility of the chimeric HbS containing the respective chimeric α-chains. Mouse α-(1–30) has eight sequence differences as compared with human α-chain. Of these, two sequence differences are located at the same sites (α4 and α19) as in horse α-(1–30). The higher inhibitory potential of mouse α-(1–30) must come from one or more of the sequence differences that are not common between the mouse and horse α-(1–30). (iii) Two of the eight common sequence differences are located at implicated contact sites of the fiber (α78 and α116). In addition, mouse α-chain has two more sequence differences at the implicated contact sites (α34 and α48) according to one of the fiber models (9Watowich S. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 20Watowich S. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 161Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). (iv) The consequences of segregating the horse α-chain into α-(1–30) and α-(31–141) segments, to generate chimeras of human and horse α-chain, are reminiscent of the results obtained with mouse α-chain (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, although horse α-chain exhibited a high degree of inhibitory potential, the solubility and delay time of the chimeric HbS, α2Mβ2S, is much higher (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Inasmuch as horse α-(31–141) is the major contributor of the inhibitory potential of horse α-chain, and this segment inhibits similarly to mouse α-(31–141) (5Roy R.P. Nagel R.L. Acharya A.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16406-16412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), it follows that the six common sequence differences between the horse α-(31–141) and mouse α-(31–141) may be the primary determinant of the polymerization inhibitory potential of these two fragments. The observations that mouse α-(1–30) exhibits an inhibitory potential higher than that of horse α-(1–30) and that, when stitched to mouse α-(31–141), additional inhibitory potential is observed suggest that a chimeric α-chain that can be generated by stitching together mouse α-(1–30) and horse α-(31–141) could exhibit polymerization properties similar to that of mouse α-chain. To test this hypothesis, we have generated the appropriate chimeric α-chains. The chromatographic behavior of βS hybrids containing mouse-horse or horse-mouse chimeric α-chain is shown in Fig.5. The isoelectric focusing pattern of the species is shown in the inset (Fig. 5,inset). The studies establish the homogeneity of the chimeric HbS containing the animal-animal chimeric α-chain. The βS hybrids containing horse-mouse chimeric α-chains exhibited cooperative oxygen binding as reflected by their Hill coefficient (Table II). However, the oxygen affinity of both of the hybrids is higher than that of HbS. These results demonstrate that chimeric HbS containing nonhuman-nonhuman chimeric α-chains also conserve the basic Hb fold and reflects the high flexibility that exists in the assembly of basic Hb fold from diverse α and β-globin chains. The hybrid containing horse α-(1–30)-mouse α-(31–141) chimeric α-chain (α2HrMβ2S) polymerized with a delay time much longer than that of HbS (Fig.6), and the solubility is close to that of the βS hybrid containing human mouse chimeric α-chain (segment 1–30 from human and segment 31–141 from mouse α-chain; Fig. 7). This is consistent with the observation that very little polymerization inhibitory activity is attributed to the α-(1–30) segment of horse α-chain. The α-(1–30) segments of horse and human are indistinguishable from one another in terms of their inhibitory potential when they are stitched to the mouse α-(31–141). However, this hybrid (α2HrMβ2S) exhibited a solubility lower than that of α2Hrβ2S (Fig. 7). Therefore, the interaction of the sequence differences of horse α-(1–30) with those of mouse α-(31–141) does not elicit additional inhibitory potential to bring its value to a level comparable to that of horse α-chain. Therefore, the two common sequence differences between the mouse α-(1–30) and horse α-(1–30) are not responsible for the synergy seen between the sequence differences of the two segments of the mouse α-chains, α-(1–30) and α-(31–141) (loss of polymerization inhibitory potential on generation of human-mouse and mouse-human chimeric α-chains).Figure 7Comparison of the solubility of deoxy form of horse-human and horse-mouse chimeric α-chain Hb hybrids. The solubility of these hybrids has been determined as described for Fig.3.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, the hybrid with the chimeric α-chain generated from mouse α-(1–30) and horse α-(31–141) (α2MHrβ2S)did not polymerize under all the experimental conditions attempted. The inhibitory potential of this chimeric α-chain is even higher than that of the most inhibiting parent α-chain, mouse α-chain. This suggests that the sequence differences of mouse α-(1–30) could activate one or more sequence differences of horse α-(31–141) better than that seen with the sequence differences of mouse α-(31–141), which results in an enhanced inhibitory potential. The unique complementation of the 8 sequence differences of the mouse α-(1–30) with 15 sequence differences of the horse α-(31–141) is achieved in the mouse-horse chimeric α-chain, and this results in the generation of a superinhibitory α-chain. The delineation of the molecular basis of the superinhibitory activity of mouse-horse chimeric α-chain should facilitate the design of novel antisickling hemoglobin for gene therapy of sickle cell disease. Mouse α-chain and the chimeric α-chain generated from mouse α-(1–30) and horse α-(31–141) have one common factor; the AB and GH corners of the two α-chains have a significant number of the sequence differences, and some residues of the AB region are involved in the intra-double strand axial contacts (α16 and α20) of the fiber (9Watowich S. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Mol. Biol. 1989; 209: 821-826Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In mouse and mouse-horse chimeric (both have the same α-(1–30) segment) α-chains, four sequence differences are located in the AB region (α17, α19, α21, and α22) (Fig.8). The three-dimensional structure of Hb brings the AB and GH corners of the α-chain close to each other. Accordingly, the interaction of sequence differences at the AB corner with the sequence differences of horse α-(31–141) located in GH corner represents the main structural difference between horse and mouse-horse chimeric α-chain. This difference could perturb the intrachain interactions of the AB/GH corner of the chimeric α-chain in a fashion distinct compared with that in horse α-chain. The α-(31–141) segment of both mouse and horse α-chains have many sequence differences that are common, including the two contact site sequence differences (α78 and α116). Mouse α-(31–141) has sequence differences at α111, α113, and α116 (as compared with human), and horse α-(31–141) has sequence differences at α107, α111, α115, and α116 in the GH region. The site α115 has been implicated as an axial contact site of Wishner-Love double strand (18Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8272-8279Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar,19Padlan E.A. Love W.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 8280-8291Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) in Josephs' model (20Watowich S. Gross L.J. Josephs R. J. Struct. Biol. 1993; 111: 161Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The consequences of the replacements of the amino acid side chains, found in the mouse-horse chimeric α-chain in the AB/GH corner of the HbS molecule, have been examined by molecular modeling (Fig.9) to test the above hypothesis. The findings are as follows. (a) The sequence differences of the segment from α107 to α118 of horse α-chain and those in the segment from α15 to α24 of mouse α-chain have been introduced at the respective sites in the structure of human HbA (Fig. 9, A and B). The introduction of side chains of the four sequence differences of the mouse α-chain (those located at α17, α19, α21, and α22) into HbA by themselves does not appear to result in any serious perturbations at the AB/GH corner, i.e. intrachain interactions (data not shown). This result is consistent with the experimental observation that the mouse human chimeric α-chains exhibits very little inhibition. In contrast, the sequence differences of the GH corner of the horse α-chain at α107 and α111 perturb the α1β1 interface interactions. (Fig.10, A and B). These two residues are at the COOH-terminal end of the G helix and interact along with the side chains of residues of G helix of the β-chains (intradimeric interactions). In HbS, Val-107(α) interacts with Gln-127(β), Ala-115(β), and Cys-112(β) (Fig.10 B). (b) In the chimeric HbS containing either horse α-chain or mouse-horse chimeric α-chain, Cys-112(β), absent in the α1β1 interface of horse hemoglobin, has been introduced into the α1β1 interface of chimeric HbS, without the other sequence differences of the horse β-chain in this region. Thus, the interactions at the α1β1 interface of the chimeric HbS containing the mouse-horse chimeric α-chain are expected to contain elements of the interactions of both HbS and horse Hb. (c) The presence of Ser-107(α) in the horse α-(31–141) (in place of Val in the human α-chain) in the chimeric HbS containing the mouse-horse chimeric α-chain, new intradimeric hydrogen bond is favored between the side chain of α107 and Gln127 (Fig.10 A). (d) Although the overall Hb fold is expected to be conserved, a considerable degree of dynamic changes are anticipated in the α1β1 interface in tetramers containing either horse α-chain or horse-mouse chimeric α-chain as result of the following. (i) Increased intradimeric interaction between the COOH terminus of the G-helix of the chimeric α-chain and the NH2 terminus of the G-helix of the βS is suggested to be present in the horse Hb. (ii) The presence of Cys at β112 in the chimeric HbS could facilitate normal interaction present between the carboxyl-terminal region of G helix of the βSand the amino-terminal region of the H-helix of the chimeric α-chain at the α1β1 interface, which is different from that in horse Hb. (iii) The presence of Val at α111 in the chimeric α-chain is also expected to perturb the interactions involving the residues Ala-115(β) and Cys-112(β). Although Val-111(α) could increase the interaction with Ala-115(β), the presence of Cys-112(β) in the chimeric HbS attempts to restore the interaction with the side chain at α111 close to that seen in HbS. In contrast, the sequence differences at α115 and α116 are expected to influence the α1β1 interface interactions, between the AB and GH corners of the chimeric α-chain. In horse Hb, the presence of Asn at α115 generates an additional interactions between α115 and β123, facilitating the anchoring of the amino terminus of the H-helix of the β-chain close to the GH corner or vice versa based on the energetics involved in other perturbed interactions. The replacement of Glu-116(α) with Asp facilitates a better interaction between the amino group of Lys-16(α) with the β-carboxyl group of Asp-116(α). As seen in Fig.9 B, the net effect is that the ε-amino group Lys-16(α) becomes relatively more buried inside the crevice of the AB/GH corner compared with human α-chain or mouse-human chimeric α-chain. We have noted above, the perturbations of the α1β1 interface in the HbS containing either horse α-chain or human-horse chimeric α-chain are not directly responsible for the superinhibitory activity of the chimeric α-chain. Nonetheless, it is still conceivable that the altered interactions of the α1β1 interface of the chimeric HbS may facilitate interaction of Lys-16(α) with Asp-116(α) in a way that decreases the accessibility of Lys-16(α) for intertetrameric interactions during the polymerization of deoxy chimeric HbS containing mouse-horse chimeric α-chain. Further studies of superinhibitory α-chains using x-ray crystallography or molecular fingerprinting by NMR spectroscopy, should confirm, expand, or correct the molecular basis of the antipolymerization capacity exhibited by these chimeric molecules. The results presented here support the mechanism of synergy between the sequence differences present in the α-(1–30) and α-(31–141) of the nonhuman α-chains and the potential use of this phenomena in the construction of α-chains with superinhibitory potential that could serve as a blueprint for the design of therapeutic agents for the gene therapy of sickle cell disease.

https://openalex.org/W1985437321,"Complementation group G of xeroderma pigmentosum (XPG) is one of the most rare and pathophysiologically heterogeneous forms of this inherited disease. XPG patients exhibit varying phenotypes, from having a very mild defect in DNA repair to being severely affected, and a few cases are also associated with the neurological degeneracy and growth retardation of Cockayne's syndrome. The XPG gene encodes a 134-kDa nuclear protein that is essential for the incision steps of nucleotide excision repair. XPG protein contains a putative helix-loop-helix (HLH) motif in the region that is most conserved among the members of structure-specific endonuclease family. To establish the functional significance of the HLH motif, we used several approaches, including theoretical modeling, functional complementation assay, structure-specific endonuclease assay, and DNA binding assay. A secondary structure of the motif was predicted by energy minimization and the Monte Carlo simulation and empirically proven using the circular dichroism to contain a high content of α-helix. When an XPG mutant lacking the HLH was overexpressed in UV135 cells, which have defects in the hamster homolog of XPG, the mutant gene failed to confer to the hamster cells the resistance to UV light. A recombinant XPG protein lacking the HLH motif was purified from insect cells and tested for a structure-specific endonuclease activity. The mutant protein failed to cleave the flap strand. A recombinant peptide containing the HLH (amino acids 758–871) was expressed in and purified from bacteria, tested for DNA binding activity, and found to bind to a DNA substrate with the flap structure. These results suggest that the HLH motif is required for the catalytic and DNA binding activities of XPG.

The genome of living organisms is constantly exposed to both external and internal sources of physically and chemically damaging agents. The inherent stability of the DNA molecule provides the first level of protection from such attacks. Moreover, organisms have developed intricate machineries of DNA repair to correct various types of damages in the genome (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). These DNA repair machineries are well conserved among bacteria, yeasts, and human (2Aboussekhra A. Wood R.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 1994; 4: 212-220Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). During the last 2 decades, investigators have been identifying and characterizing different DNA repair pathways, including base excision, nucleotide excision repair (NER), 1The abbreviations used are: NER, nucleotide excision repair; XP, xeroderma pigmentosum; XPG, complementation group G of xeroderma pigmentosum; CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; HLH, helix-loop-helix; bHLH, basic helix-loop-helix; aa, amino acids; HPLC, high performance liquid chromatography; TFE, trifluoroethanol; DMS, dimethyl suberimidate; Tricine,N-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycine. and double-strand break repair (1Friedberg E.C. Walker G.C. Siede W. DNA Repair and Mutagenesis. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, D. C.1995Google Scholar). The study of mammalian DNA repair mechanisms has matured greatly in the last few years. Genes have been cloned, proteins have been isolated, and mechanisms are being defined (Refs. 3Mu D. Park C.-H.

Most recently, the excitement and significance of DNA repair have culminated in the recently defined connection between types of colorectal cancer and defects in mismatch repair (5Fishel R.

Nature. 1994; 368: 258-260Crossref PubMed Scopus (1935) Google Scholar). NER is performed by protein complexes composed of separate recognition proteins, helicases, and nucleases that excise nucleotide segments of DNA around almost any damaged site (reviewed in Ref. 7Wood R.D. Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B. Biol. Sci. 1995; 347: 69-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). A primary function of NER is to eliminate and repair a variety of premutagenic DNA lesions such as nucleotide photodamage, chemical adducts, and cross-links (8Sancar A. Tang M.S. Photochem. Photobiol. 1993; 57: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar). Consequently NER may reduce the cumulative risk of cancer and premature aging in carcinogen-exposed tissues. The incidence of all types of skin carcinoma and melanoma are increasing epidemically due to sun-seeking life style changes of recent generations. The efficacy of NER for reducing incidence of skin neoplasia is indicated clinically from patients with sun sensitivity syndromes, such as xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) (9Cleaver J.E. Kraemer K.H.

At least 10 distinct genetic disorders of NER are associated with XP, Cockayne's syndromes, and related Trichothiodystrophy (10Bootsma D. Philos. Trans R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1995; 347: 75-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Severely affected children have greatly increased incidence of all types of skin cancer and a variety of growth and mental retardation. Xeroderma pigmentosum group G (XPG) is one of the eight genetic complementation groups (labeled A through G, and variant) of congenital defects that cause individuals to exhibit a variety of pathophysiological symptoms, including a deficiency in nucleotide excision repair, sun sensitivity, growth and mental retardation, and neurodegeneracy (11Vermeulen W.

By introducing human DNA into a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mutant (UV135) (14Busch D. Grenier C. Lewis K. Ford R. Adair G. Thomson L.H. Mutagenesis. 1989; 4: 349-354Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar), the human gene (ERCC5) that corrected UV sensitivity of UV135 was cloned (15Mudgett J.S.

Recent genetic and biochemical complementation studies have assigned the ERCC5 gene to the human XPG genotype (17Scherly D. Nouspikel T. Corlet Ucla C. Bairoch C.A.S.G. Clarkson S.G.

More recently, it was found that the XPG protein possesses single-stranded DNA endonuclease activity and that it is required for incision of the damaged DNA strand 3′ to the lesion during nucleotide excision repair (23O'Donovan A. Scherly D. Clarkson S.G. Wood R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15965-15968Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24O'Donovan A. Davies A.A. Moggs J.G. West S.C. Wood R.D.

XPG protein exhibits exonuclease activity and a structure-specific endonuclease activity (26Habraken Y. Sung P. Prakash L. Prakash S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1994; 22: 3312-3316Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar, 27Cloud K.G. Shen B. Strniste G.F. Park M.S. Mutat. Res. Lett. 1995; 347: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These results indicate that XPG protein is an essential catalytic component of the excision step of NER. The predicted primary structure of XPG presents three regions that are evolutionarily conserved among members of a newly emerging family, the structure-specific endonuclease (Fig. 1). One of the regions contains a motif that exhibits homology with the second amphipathic helix of a family of regulatory proteins known as helix-loop-helix (HLH) proteins, including MyoD (Fig. 1). The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) family of DNA-binding proteins regulate cell type-specific transcription (reviewed in Ref. 28Jones N. Cell. 1990; 61: 9-11Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar). This family of proteins is distinguished by a conserved dimerization motif (the HLH domain) and an adjacent cluster of basic amino acid residues shown to be responsible for site-specific DNA binding (Refs. 29Lassar A.B. Buskin J.N. Lockshon D. Davis R.L. Apone S. Hauschka S.D. Weintraub H. Cell. 1989; 58: 823-831Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (570) Google Scholar and 30Murre C. McCraw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar and references therein). The HLH domain is composed of two amphipathic α-helices separated by a loop region of variable length, and this motif also facilitates homodimerization and heterodimerization between members of the HLH protein family (31Murre C. McCraw P.S. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L.Y. Jan Y.N. Cabrera C.V. Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Lassar A. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1303) Google Scholar,32Sun X.-H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1991; 64: 459-470Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (317) Google Scholar). To determine potential functional domains such as catalytic and DNA binding domains of XPG protein, we performed a motif search, made a secondary structure prediction, and reconstructed biochemical and genetic experiments to assimilate the information obtained by theoretical studies. As a first step for this approach, we analyzed the evolutionary conserved domain of XPG and found that this region contains a putative HLH motif. Biophysical characterization was performed to validate the theoretical prediction of the motif, and biochemical and genetic experiments were carried out to establish the functional significance of the HLH motif of XPG both in vivoand in vitro. In this report we present evidences that support the potential role of the HLH domain as a part of catalytic and/or DNA binding domain of XPG. The implication of these observations is discussed in terms of catalytic and DNA binding activities of XPG in specific and structure-specific endonuclease in general. The UV-sensitive CHO mutant UV135 cells were used and cultured as described previously (16MacInnes M.A. Dickson J.A. Hernandez R.H. Learmonth D. Lin G. Mudgett J.S. Park M.S. Schauer S. Reynolds R.J. Strniste G.F. Yu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6393-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cells were seeded at a density of 106 cells/10-cm dish and transfected with 10 μg of wild-type or mutant DNAs by calcium phosphate method (33Gram F.L. van der Eb A.J. Virology. 1973; 52: 456-467Crossref PubMed Scopus (6499) Google Scholar). Stable transformants were selected with G418 (250 μg/m) and expanded for UV survival test. UV survival test was performed as described previously (16MacInnes M.A. Dickson J.A. Hernandez R.H. Learmonth D. Lin G. Mudgett J.S. Park M.S. Schauer S. Reynolds R.J. Strniste G.F. Yu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6393-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The pBSK-XPGC was made by removing 5′-untranslated regions and adding an adenine residue at −3 position to introduce the Kozak's consensus sequence (34Kozak M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19867-19870Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The original cDNA of XPG has a cytosine at this position (16MacInnes M.A. Dickson J.A. Hernandez R.H. Learmonth D. Lin G. Mudgett J.S. Park M.S. Schauer S. Reynolds R.J. Strniste G.F. Yu J.Y. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 6393-6402Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The modified cDNA was transferred to pBKCMV digested with SpeI/XhoI for expression in UV135 cells. The mutant XPG (XPG-dHLH) was created from the pBSK-XPG by removing the region (aa 771–799) containing the amphipathic helix by using ExSite mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, CA). The mutagenic primers were: P1, 5′ CAG GAA CAT CTG TCC GGT GAC AGT 3′ and P2, 5′ CTG ACT GAT CAG ACT TCC GGA ACC 3′. Once the presence of deletion was confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, the insert was transferred to either pBKCMV or pVL1392 for the expression in UV135 cells or Sf9 insect cells, respectively. These new expression constructs were designated as pCMV-XPG-ΔHLH and pVL-XPG-ΔHLH. To test DNA binding activity of the XPG regions that contain the HLH motif, a bacterial expression construct was made in pET-28 vector (Novagene). The inserts coding for the peptides (aa 747–804 and 758–871) were cloned into pET28 digested withNcoI and XhoI. These constructs were designated as pET-XPG(747–804) and pET-XPG(758–871). Expression and purification of wild-type XPG have been described previously (27Cloud K.G. Shen B. Strniste G.F. Park M.S. Mutat. Res. Lett. 1995; 347: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The mutant transfer construct pVL-XPG(d771–799) was transfected into Sf9 cells, and the recombinant virus was obtained using the procedures used for wild-type XPG recombinant virus. Protein was expressed and purified from insect cells as described (27Cloud K.G. Shen B. Strniste G.F. Park M.S. Mutat. Res. Lett. 1995; 347: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) (35Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar) was transformed with pET-XPG(747–804) or pET-XPG(758–871) and cultured in 1 liter of LB medium. Isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to 0.1 mm final concentration to a culture ofA 600 = 0.6. Cultures were further incubated for another 3 h. Cells were harvested and washed twice with a wash buffer (100 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), resuspended in 100 ml of a column binding buffer, and sonicated. The sample was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 1 h, and the supernantant was filtered through 0.45-μm filter before loading onto a metal chelate column and purified as suggested by the manufacturer (Novagene). The purified recombinant peptide (aa 747–804) from the metal chelate column was injected onto a reverse phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) column (Semi-Prep CN, 7.8 × 300 mm, Waters) and run at the flow rate of 4.0 ml/min. Solvent compositions were: A, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, 100% acetonitrile; B, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, 50% acetonitrile; and C, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid, H2O. After equilibrating the column with a 100% solvent C isocratic run-in for 5 min, the sample was pumped onto the column, and the gradient was started immediately. A linear gradient was applied from 20 to 50% acetonitrile at a rate of 10%/h. Fractions containing either the HLH monomer or dimer peak were collected separately, lyophilized, and stored at −20 °C under argon gas. Two peptides (17-mer, FGIPYIQAPMEAEAQCA and 36-mer, ATVTGQMFLESQELLRLFGIPYIQAPMEAEAQCAIL) that contain the putative HLH motif were chemically synthesized on a Milligene system by a solid phase chemistry. The synthetic peptides were further purified by a reverse phase HPLC, and the purity was confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis. The amount of helical content was determined by circular dichroism spectroscopy (36Johnson W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The purified HLH peptide was dissolved in varying concentrations of trifluoroethanol (TFE) and subjected to CD anlysis in a JASCO model J-710. Molecular weights of monomer and dimer fraction was determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry on a VESTEC Laser Research Tec. model equipped with the VESTEC 201 electrospray unit. The amino acid composition of the monomer and dimer peak of a recombinant peptide (aa 747–804) containing the HLH motif was determined by using the Pico-Tag amino acid analysis system (Waters) following the manufacturer's suggestion. The bifunctional cross-linking reagent DMS (dimethyl suberimidate, Pierce) was used for protein cross-linking studies. DMS was always prepared immediately before use by dissolving 30 mg of DMS in 100 μl of ice-cold triethanolamine-HCl (0.15 m, pH 8.2). The pH of the DMS solution was readjusted to 8.2 with 1m NaOH. Cross-linking was initiated by adding DMS (10 mg/ml) to the XPG 36-mer peptide (10 μm) that was preincubated in 50 mm triethanolamine buffer, pH 8.2, that contained 10 mm MgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, and 1 mm dithiothreitol at 22 °C. The cross-linking reactions were stopped after intervals ranging from 2 to 20 min by adding an equal volume of 1 m glycine to aliquots of the reactions. The quenched samples were mixed with SDS sample buffer (125 mm Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 10% mercaptoethanol, 20% glycerol, and 0.002% bromphenol blue), heated at 90 °C for 2 min, and subjected to Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using 10–20% gradient gels. Proteins were visualized by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 staining. Flap-endonuclease assays were performed as described previously (27Cloud K.G. Shen B. Strniste G.F. Park M.S. Mutat. Res. Lett. 1995; 347: 55-60Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 37Harrington J.J. Lieber M. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1235-1246Crossref PubMed Scopus (373) Google Scholar). Protein or peptide samples were analyzed by Tricine-SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (38Schagger H. Jagow G.V. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10505) Google Scholar). DNA binding assay was performed as described previously (39Harrington J.J. Lieber M.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 4503-4508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The secondary structural elements and energy-minimized structures of the HLH motif of XPG protein were predicted by the following procedures. The secondary structural elements are predicted by computing the probability S of a given residue iin this sequence to adopt a k type of conformation (k = helix (h), β-sheet (b), coil (c), or turn (t)), where S(k,i)=∑l=−γγP(k,i+1)∣l∣+1Equation 1 (where γ = size of the window chosen to account for the effect of the neighboring amino acid residues: γ = 5 for h; γ = 3 for b; and γ = 4 for c or t). P(k, i) = potential for the k type of conformation of individual residuei derived from the analysis of the single crystal structures of about 65 proteins. The highest S(k, i) determines the conformation k for the i residue. This methodology is adopted from Deleage and Roux (40Deleage G. Roux B. Prediction of Protein Structure and Principles of Protein Conformation. Plenum Press, New York1989: 587-635Google Scholar). Use of any existing algorithm for secondary structure prediction is only 60% accurate. To improve accuracy, we performed step 2. This step involves obtaining an energetically stable helix-loop-helix motif given the secondary structural states of the constituent amino acids residues as obtained after step 1. Appropriate ranges of (ϕ, ψ) values are assigned to all amino acids. For example, ϕ = −55° ± 25°, ψ = −55° ± 25° for residues in a helix; ϕ = −140° ± 30°, ψ = 140° ± 30° for residues in a β-strand; ϕi + 1 = −65° ± 20°, ψi + 1 = −50° ± 20°, ϕi + 2 = −90° ± 20°, ψi + 2 = 0° ± 20° for residues in a type I turn; ϕi + 1 = −65° ± 20°, ψi + 1 = 120° ± 20°, ϕi + 2 = 90° ± 20°, ψi + 1 = 0° ± 20° for residues in a type II turn; (ϕ, ψ) of residues in the coil state are set free to choose any point in the allowed space (for definitions of different secondary structures and corresponding (ϕ, ψ) values; see Ref. 41Ramachandran G.N. Sasisekharan V. Adv. Protein Chem. 1968; 23: 283-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (2770) Google Scholar). We simplified the sequence by assuming Ala for residues with side chains extending beyond the Cβ atom, except for the Pro residues and the Gly residues. Our rationale for doing this is that the allowed (ϕ, ψ) space of residues with a side chain longer than Ala is only a subspace of that allowed for A. Finally, appropriate side chains are attached to generate an actual helix-loop-helix sequence, and the potential energy of the system is minimized in the (ϕ, ψ, ω, χ) space using the force field of Scheraga and co-workers (42Sippl M.J. Nemathy G. Scheraga H.A. J. Phys. Chem. 1984; 88: 6231-6239Crossref Scopus (342) Google Scholar). Several energy-minimized structures of the helix-loop-helix sequence are obtained by choosing a number starting structures within the specified ranges of (ϕ, ψ) values predicted in step 1. If the secondary structural states of one or more residues, as predicted in step 1, are energetically unfavorable for the HLH motif, those states are altered in step 2. Wrongly predicted secondary structural states of a residue by step 1 are corrected in this step using the energy criteria. The simulated annealing is performed in the following manner (43Gupta G.

First, a starting energy-minimized structure is chosen and Monte Carlo simulations are performed for 50,000 steps at 1000 K in the (ϕ, ψ, ω, χ) space; the last accepted configuration is stored to be subsequently used as a starting configuration in the next lower temperature cycle. Second, 50,000 Monte Carlo steps are repeated in several cycles of gradually decreasing temperature until a temperature of 100 K is reached. Third, the lowest energy configuration at 100 K is further energy-minimized to a low energy gradient (46Fletcher R. Practical Methods of Optimization. 1. John Wiley & Sons, New York1984Google Scholar). This is the “temperature quenching” step in which thermally excited single bond rotations around the equilibrium positions are quenched. Finally, the first through third steps are repeated for 20 different starting configurations. Using the BLAST search and alignment algorithms, we identified a block of XPG sequence that shares high homology with other members of the structure-specific endonuclease family (Fig. 1). Energy minimization approaches predicted a strong propensity for this region to form a HLH structure (Fig. 2 A and see below). When we compared this particular peptide with known HLH proteins, the first helix of XPG was similar with the second amphipathic helix II of HLH proteins, including MyoD (30Murre C. McCraw P.S. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 56: 777-783Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1863) Google Scholar). The positions of hydrophobic residues were identical, and the amino acid residues were highly conserved in terms of hydrophobicity (Fig. 1). The sampled low energy structures of the helix-loop motif show the following conformational features, i.e. residues 1–4 in β-strand conformation, residues 9–16 in helix conformation, residues 17–24 in loop conformation, and residues 25–36 in helix conformation.

Since the theoretical prediction of the secondary structure of the putative HLH motif highly suggested a strong propensity to form α-helical structures, we decided to measure the helical content of the motif by using CD spectrometry to empirically validate the theoretical prediction. As shown in Fig. 2 B, the helical content of the peptide increased in a solvent concentration-dependent manner. TFE induces formation of α-helices for the peptides or proteins that have a tendency to form α-helical structures (36Johnson W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1988; 17: 145-166Crossref PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). The helical content of the HLH peptide changed from approximately 10 to 50% in TFE concentration of 0 to 50%, respectively. Most of the β-strand structure appeared to become α-helices in the presence of increasing amount of TFE (Fig. 3). Once a theoretical modeling predicted a putative HLH motif in the evolutionarily conserved region, we hypothesized that this region is important for either catalysis or DNA binding. Before we extended our study along this line, we first established the functional significance of this region both in vivo and in vitro. To test the significance of the HLH motif in vivo, a mutant cDNA construct lacking the"
