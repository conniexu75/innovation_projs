https://openalex.org/W2151898297,"An estimated 170 million persons worldwide are infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a major cause of chronic liver disease. Despite increasing knowledge of genome structure and individual viral proteins, studies on virus replication and pathogenesis have been hampered by the lack of reliable and efficient cell culture systems. A full-length consensus genome was cloned from viral RNA isolated from an infected human liver and used to construct subgenomic selectable replicons. Upon transfection into a human hepatoma cell line, these RNAs were found to replicate to high levels, permitting metabolic radiolabeling of viral RNA and proteins. This work defines the structure of HCV replicons functional in cell culture and provides the basis for a long-sought cellular system that should allow detailed molecular studies of HCV and the development of antiviral drugs."

https://openalex.org/W2011448647,"Lithium- or potassium-doped carbon nanotubes can absorb approximately 20 or approximately 14 weight percent of hydrogen at moderate (200 degrees to 400 degrees C) or room temperatures, respectively, under ambient pressure. These values are greater than those of metal hydride and cryoadsorption systems. The hydrogen stored in the lithium- or potassium-doped carbon nanotubes can be released at higher temperatures, and the sorption-desorption cycle can be repeated with little decrease in the sorption capacity. The high hydrogen-uptake capacity of these systems may be derived from the special open-edged, layered structure of the carbon nanotubes made from methane, as well as the catalytic effect of alkali metals."
https://openalex.org/W1852077611,"The opioid system modulates several physiological processes, including analgesia, the stress response, the immune response and neuroendocrine function. Pharmacological and molecular cloning studies have identified three opioid-receptor types, delta, kappa and mu, that mediate these diverse effects. Little is known about the ability of the receptors to interact to form new functional structures, the simplest of which would be a dimer. Structural and biochemical studies show that other G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) interact to form homodimers. Moreover, two non-functional receptors heterodimerize to form a functional receptor, suggesting that dimerization is crucial for receptor function. However, heterodimerization between two fully functional receptors has not been documented. Here we provide biochemical and pharmacological evidence for the heterodimerization of two fully functional opioid receptors, kappa and delta. This results in a new receptor that exhibits ligand binding and functional properties that are distinct from those of either receptor. Furthermore, the kappa-delta heterodimer synergistically binds highly selective agonists and potentiates signal transduction. Thus, heterodimerization of these GPCRs represents a novel mechanism that modulates their function."
https://openalex.org/W2101937063,"Epithelia permit selective and regulated flux from apical to basolateral surfaces by transcellular passage through cells or paracellular flux between cells. Tight junctions constitute the barrier to paracellular conductance; however, little is known about the specific molecules that mediate paracellular permeabilities. Renal magnesium ion (Mg 2+ ) resorption occurs predominantly through a paracellular conductance in the thick ascending limb of Henle (TAL). Here, positional cloning has identified a human gene, paracellin-1 ( PCLN-1 ), mutations in which cause renal Mg 2+ wasting. PCLN-1 is located in tight junctions of the TAL and is related to the claudin family of tight junction proteins. These findings provide insight into Mg 2+ homeostasis, demonstrate the role of a tight junction protein in human disease, and identify an essential component of a selective paracellular conductance."
https://openalex.org/W2059457521,"Most isolates of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are resistant to interferon, the only available therapy, but the mechanism underlying this resistance has not been defined. Here it is shown that the HCV envelope protein E2 contains a sequence identical with phosphorylation sites of the interferon-inducible protein kinase PKR and the translation initiation factor eIF2α, a target of PKR. E2 inhibited the kinase activity of PKR and blocked its inhibitory effect on protein synthesis and cell growth. This interaction of E2 and PKR may be one mechanism by which HCV circumvents the antiviral effect of interferon."

https://openalex.org/W1898391394,"Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) express functional receptors to leptin, the product of the ob gene. As human obesity is associated with atherosclerosis and hyperleptinemia, we investigated whether leptin, in addition to its angiogenic properties, exerts atherogenic effects through the generation of oxidative stress in endothelial cells. In HUVEC leptin increased the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as assessed by the oxidation of 2', 7'- dichlorodihydrofluorescein, in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, leptin activated the NH2-terminal c-Jun kinase/stress-activated protein kinase pathway as demonstrated by enhanced JNK activity and AP-1 DNA binding. Both effects were sensitive to antioxidant treatment with N-acetylcysteine. NF-kappaB, another redox-sensitive transcription factor, was also activated by leptin stimulation in an oxidant-dependent manner. Finally, activation of both AP-1 and NF-kappaB was associated with an enhanced expression of the monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 in HUVEC. These findings demonstrate that ROS are second messengers involved in leptin-induced signaling in endothelial cells. Thus, chronic oxidative stress in endothelial cells under hyperleptinemia may activate atherogenic processes and contribute to the development of vascular pathology."
https://openalex.org/W2017581879,"The reaction of species in solutions flowing laminarly (without turbulent mixing) inside capillaries was used as the basis for a broadly applicable method of microfabrication. In this method, patterning occurs as a result of transport of reactive species to interfaces within the capillary by laminar flow. A wide range of chemistries can be used to generate structures with feature sizes of less than 5 micrometers and with spatial localization to within 5 micrometers. The method is applicable to the patterning of metals, organic polymers, inorganic crystals, and ceramics on the inner walls of preformed capillaries, using both additive and subtractive processes."
https://openalex.org/W2027343672,"The intramembrane molecular events underlying activation gating in the Streptomyces K + channel were investigated by site-directed spin-labeling methods and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. A comparison of the closed and open conformations of the channel revealed periodic changes in spin-label mobility and intersubunit spin-spin interaction consistent with rigid-body movements of the two transmembrane helices TM1 and TM2. These changes involve translations and counterclockwise rotations of both helices relative to the center of symmetry of the channel. The movement of TM2 increases the diameter of the permeation pathway along the point of convergence of the four subunits, thus opening the pore. Although the extracellular residues flanking the selectivity filter remained immobile during gating, small movements were detected at the C-terminal end of the pore helix, with possible implications to the gating mechanism."
https://openalex.org/W2043186109,"Lymphocyte development is critically influenced by self-antigens. T cells are subject to both positive and negative selection, depending on their degree of self-reactivity. Although B cells are subject to negative selection, it has been difficult to test whether self-antigen plays any positive role in B cell development. A murine model system of naturally generated autoreactive B cells with a germ line gene–encoded specificity for the Thy-1 (CD90) glycoprotein was developed, in which the presence of self-antigen promotes B cell accumulation and serum autoantibody secretion. Thus, B cells can be subject to positive selection, generated, and maintained on the basis of their autoreactivity."

https://openalex.org/W2076832064,"The electrostatic influence of the central cavity and pore alpha helices in the potassium ion channel from Streptomyces lividans (KcsA K + channel) was analyzed by solving the finite difference Poisson equation. The cavity and helices overcome the destabilizing influence of the membrane and stabilize a cation at the membrane center. The electrostatic effect of the pore helices is large compared to that described for water-soluble proteins because of the low dielectric membrane environment. The combined contributions of the ion self-energy and the helix electrostatic field give rise to selectivity for monovalent cations in the water-filled cavity. Thus, the K + channel uses simple electrostatic principles to solve the fundamental problem of ion destabilization by the cell membrane lipid bilayer."

https://openalex.org/W2089361638,"Low-temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy of the high transition temperature (high-Tc) cuprate Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta reveals the existence of large numbers of identical regions with diameters of about 3 nanometers that have a relatively high density of low-energy quasi-particle states. Their spatial and spectroscopic characteristics are consistent with theories of strong quasi-particle scattering from atomic-scale impurities in a d-wave superconductor. These characteristics include breaking of local particle-hole symmetry, a diameter near twice the superconducting coherence length, and an inverse square dependence of their local density-of-states on distance from the scattering center. In addition to the validation of d-wave quasi-particle scattering theories, these observations identify a source for the anomalously high levels of low-energy quasi-particles in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+delta at low temperatures."

https://openalex.org/W1903249652,"Data in the literature suggest that site-specific differences exist in the skeleton with respect to digestion of bone by osteoclasts. Therefore, we investigated whether bone resorption by calvarial osteoclasts (intramembranous bone) differs from resorption by long bone osteoclasts (endochondral bone). The involvement of two major classes of proteolytic enzymes, the cysteine proteinases (CPs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), was studied by analyzing the effects of selective low molecular weight inhibitors of these enzymes on bone resorption. Mouse tissue explants (calvariae and long bones) as well as rabbit osteoclasts, which had been isolated from both skeletal sites and subsequently seeded on bone slices, were cultured in the presence of inhibitors and resorption was analyzed. The activity of the CP cathepsins B and K and of MMPs was determined biochemically (CPs and MMPs) and enzyme histochemically (CPs) in explants and isolated osteoclasts. We show that osteoclastic resorption of calvarial bone depends on activity of both CPs and MMPs, whereas long bone resorption depends on CPs, but not on the activity of MMPs. Furthermore, significantly higher levels of cathepsin B and cathepsin K activities were expressed by long bone osteoclasts than by calvarial osteoclasts. Resorption of slices of bovine skull or cortical bone by osteoclasts isolated from long bones was not affected by MMP inhibitors, whereas resorption by calvarial osteoclasts was inhibited. Inhibition of CP activity affected the resorption by the two populations of osteoclasts in a similar way. We conclude that this is the first report to show that significant differences exist between osteoclasts of calvariae and long bones with respect to their bone resorbing activities. Resorption by calvarial osteoclasts depends on the activity of CPs and MMPs, whereas resorption by long bone osteoclasts depends primarily on the activity of CPs. We hypothesize that functionally different subpopulations of osteoclasts, such as those described here, originate from different sets of progenitors.—Everts, V., Korper, W., Jansen, D. C., Steinfort, J., Lammerse, I., Heera, S., Docherty, A. J. P., Beertsen, W.

https://openalex.org/W1498554079,"The central nervous system (CNS), unlike the peripheral nervous system (PNS), is an immune-privileged site in which local immune responses are restricted. Whereas immune privilege in the intact CNS has been studied intensively, little is known about its effects after trauma. In this study, we examined the influence of CNS immune privilege on T cell response to central nerve injury. Immunocytochemistry revealed a significantly greater accumulation of endogenous T cells in the injured rat sciatic nerve than in the injured rat optic nerve (representing PNS and CNS white matter trauma, respectively). Use of the in situ terminal deoxytransferase-catalyzed DNA nick end labeling (TUNEL) procedure revealed extensive death of accumulating T cells in injured CNS nerves as well as in CNS nerves of rats with acute experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, but not in injured PNS nerves. Although Fas ligand (FasL) protein was expressed in white matter tissue of both systems, it was more pronounced in the CNS. Expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II antigens was found to be constitutive in the PNS, but in the CNS was induced only after injury. Our findings suggest that the T cell response to central nerve injury is restricted by the reduced expression of MHC class II antigens, the pronounced FasL expression, and the elimination of infiltrating lymphocytes through cell death."

https://openalex.org/W1865758164,"We have investigated in adult rats made mildly diabetic by a low dose of streptozotocin (35 mg/kg; STZ rats) and in nondiabetic rats (ND rats) the mechanisms leading to adaptive changes in the β cell mass, during glucose infusion and several days after stopping infusion. As early as 24 h of glucose infusion, the β cell mass was maximally increased in ND and STZ rats. In both groups, this increase was due mainly to a rapid activation of neogenesis of new endocrine cells rather than to an increase in β cell proliferation. Seven days after stopping glucose infusion, the β cell mass returned to basal values in both groups as a result of stimulation of β cell apoptosis and a decrease in β cell replication rate. In glucose-infused ND rats, changes in the β cell mass were correlated to insulin secretion, whereas in STZ rats, insulin secretion in response to glucose was still impaired whatever the β cell mass. In conclusion, the data stress the impressive plasticity of the endocrine pancreas of adult rats. They also show that changes in β cell mass in ND and STZ rats resulted from a disruption in the balance between neogenesis and apoptosis.—Bernard, C., Berthault, M.-F., Saulnier, C., Ktorza, A.

https://openalex.org/W1979195593,"Hydrogen trioxide (HO 3 ) has long been postulated as a key intermediate in important atmospheric processes but has proved difficult to detect. The molecule was unequivocally detected in experiments based on neutralization-reionization and neutralization-reionization/collisionally activated dissociation mass spectrometry, using protonated ozone (HO 3 + ) as the charged precursor. Hydrogen trioxide is a relatively stable species and has a H-O-O-O connectivity and a lifetime exceeding 10 –6 seconds at ambient temperature."
https://openalex.org/W2054002933,"Diagenetic xenotime is common in siliciclastic sedimentary rocks, where it starts to form on detrital zircon shortly after sediment deposition. It is possible to estimate the age of sedimentary rocks by in situ uranium-lead analysis of that xenotime. Two Proterozoic sandstone units from northwestern Australia, previously constrained to the age interval of 1790 to 750 million years ago, have diagenetic xenotime ages of 1704 ± 7 and 1704 ± 14 million years ago. This method has potential for dating sedimentary sequences of all ages but should be especially valuable for refining the Precambrian time scale."

https://openalex.org/W2071290149,"Two main types of material survive from the Canyon Diablo impactor, which produced Meteor Crater in Arizona: iron meteorites, which did not melt during the impact; and spheroids, which did. Ultrasensitive measurements using accelerator mass spectrometry show that the meteorites contain about seven times as much nickel-59 as the spheroids. Lower average nickel-59 contents in the spheroids indicate that they typically came from 0.5 to 1 meter deeper in the impactor than did the meteorites. Numerical modeling for an impact velocity of 20 kilometers per second shows that a shell 1.5 to 2 meters thick, corresponding to 16 percent of the projectile volume, remained solid on the rear surface; that most of the projectile melted; and that little, if any, vaporized."
https://openalex.org/W1800460386,"Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase (21-OH), one of the most common genetic defects in humans, causes low glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid production by the adrenal cortex, but the effect of this disorder on the adrenomedullary system is unknown. Therefore, we analyzed the development, structure, and function of the adrenal medulla in 21-OH-deficient mice, an animal model resembling human congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Chromaffin cells of 21-OH-deficient mice exhibited ultrastructural features of neuronal transdifferentiation with reduced granules, increased rough endoplasmic reticulum and small neurite outgrowth. Migration of chromaffin cells in the adrenal to form a central medulla was impaired. Expression of phenylethanolamine-N-methyltransferase (PNMT) was reduced to 27 ± 9% (P<0.05), as determined by quantitative TaqMan polymerase chain reaction, and there was a significant reduction of cells staining positive for PNMT in the adrenal medulla of the 21-OH-deficient mice. Adrenal contents of epinephrine were decreased to 30 ± 2% (P<0.01) whereas norepinephrine and dopamine levels were reduced to 57 ± 4% (P<0.01) and 50 ± 9% (P<0.05), respectively. 21-OH-deficient mice demonstrate severe adrenomedullary dysfunction, with alterations in chromaffin cell migration, development, structure, and catecholamine synthesis. This hitherto unrecognized mechanism may contribute to the frequent clinical, mental, and therapeutic problems encountered in humans with this genetic disease.—Bornstein, S. R., Tajima, T., Eisenhofer, G., Haidan, A., Aguilera, G. Adrenomedullary function is severely impaired in 21-hydroxylase-deficient mice. FASEB J. 13, 1185–1194 (1999)"
https://openalex.org/W2171015815,"Using a murine model, we studied the effect of agonistic anti-CD95 antibodies (aCD95) on sinusoidal lining cells and a potential protection by caspase inhibition. C3H/HeN mice were intravenously administered aCD95 (10 microgram/mouse) or unspecific IgG (control) in the presence or absence of the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. Analysis of hepatic microcirculation using intravital fluorescence microscopy revealed severe (P<0.01) sinusoidal perfusion failure and reduced (P<0.05) phagocytic activity of Kupffer cells (KC) within 2 h. Transmission electron micrographs demonstrated loss of integrity of sinusoidal endothelial cells as early as 1 h after aCD95 application, whereas histological manifestation of hepatocellular apoptosis and hemorrhagic necrosis was most pronounced at 6 h. Blocking of caspase activity attenuated (P<0.01) both hepatic microvascular perfusion failure and KC dysfunction. Accordingly, full protection of the liver from apoptotic damage and intact microarchitecture was observed in histological sections after z-VAD-fmk treatment. Mortality rate was 40% 6 h after aCD95 administration, whereas all animals survived in the z-VAD-fmk group (P<0.05). The activation of caspases through CD95 may primarily lead to damage of sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatic microvascular perfusion failure. Moreover, reduced phagocytic capacity of KC may contribute to accumulation of toxic metabolites released by dying cells at the local site of inflammation, further aggravating liver injury."

https://openalex.org/W2164439599,"Accumulating evidence suggests that plasma levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6), a major cytokine stimulating the synthesis of acute-phase proteins, are intimately regulated by the central nervous system. Nicotine, one of the major drugs abused by humans, has been shown to affect immunological functions. In the present study, effects of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of nicotine on plasma IL-6 levels were investigated in mice. Nicotine administered i.c.v. dose-dependently increased plasma IL-6 levels; the lowest effective dose was 0.3 ng/mouse and the maximal effect was attained with the dose of 105 ng/mouse. The nicotine (105 ng/mouse, i.c.v.)-induced plasma IL-6 levels peaked at 3 h and approached basal levels 6 h after injection. Mecamylamine, a nicotinic receptor antagonist, blocked nicotine-induced plasma IL-6 levels. Depletion of peripheral norepinephrine with 6-hydroxydopamine [100 mg/kg, intraperitoneal (i. p.)] inhibited the nicotine-induced plasma IL-6 levels by 57%, whereas central norepinephrine depletion with 6-hydroxydopamine (50 microgram/mouse, i.c.v.) had no effect. Pretreatment with prazosin (alpha1-adrenergic antagonist; 1 mg/kg, i.p.), yohimbine (alpha2-adrenergic antagonist; 1 mg/kg, i.p.), and ICI-118,551 (beta2-adrenergic antagonist; 2 mg/kg, i.p.), but not with betaxolol (beta1-adrenergic antagonist; 2 mg/kg, i.p.), inhibited nicotine-induced plasma IL-6 levels. Among the peripheral organs, including the pituitary, adrenals, heart, lung, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes, nicotine (105 ng/mouse, i.c.v.) increased IL-6 mRNA expression only in the liver and spleen, which was inhibited by peripheral norepinephrine depletion. These results suggest that stimulation of central nicotinic receptors induces plasma IL-6 levels and IL-6 mRNA expression in the liver and spleen via the peripheral sympathetic nervous system, alpha1-, alpha2-, and beta2-adrenoreceptors being involved."
https://openalex.org/W1672164896,"Humans and cats can localize a sound source accurately if its spectrum is fairly broad and flat1,2,3, as is typical of most natural sounds. However, if sounds are filtered to reduce the width of the spectrum, they result in illusions of sources that are very different from the actual locations, particularly in the up/down and front/back dimensions4,5,6. Such illusions reveal that the auditory system relies on specific characteristics of sound spectra to obtain cues for localization7. In the auditory cortex of cats, temporal firing patterns of neurons can signal the locations of broad-band sounds8,9. Here we show that such spike patterns systematically mislocalize sounds that have been passed through a narrow-band filter. Both correct and incorrect locations signalled by neurons can be predicted quantitatively by a model of spectral processing that also predicts correct and incorrect localization judgements by human listeners6. Similar cortical mechanisms, if present in humans, could underlie human auditory spatial perception."
https://openalex.org/W2141519796,"The fossil record of tunicates reaches back to the upper Cambrian period. Ascidians have mobile, tadpole-like juvenile forms with a notochord, which inspired the classification of tunicates as Urochordata, i.e., predecessors of vertebrates. The genome of the tunicate Ciona intestinalis contains a relaxin coding region that is organized like a mammalian gene, i.e., signal peptide, B-chain domain, connecting peptide domain, followed by the A-chain domain with a stop codon after cysteine A-22. RNA-derived cDNA encodes a relaxin that is identical to the circulating form of the porcine hormone. In contrast to the porcine gene, the ascidian gene has no intron in the C-peptide domain, and in that respect is similar to the bombyxin gene of the silkworm. During the spawning period, only enough relaxin could be extracted and isolated from gonads of C. intestinalis for a partial sequence analysis. Remarkable as it may be, these findings suggest that relaxin is identical in pigs, whales, and the tunicate C. intestinalis."
https://openalex.org/W1492764691,"We have cloned and sequenced a SEC7-related gene in Paramecium tetraurelia that contains an open reading frame for 1135 amino acids encoding a 133 kDa protein, PSec7. Sec7, first identified in vesicular trafficking mutants in yeast, and its phylogenetic homologues function as guanine-nucleotide exchange factors for small G-proteins such as ARF (ADP-ribosylation factor). The deduced amino acid sequence in PSec7 for the motifs that form the ARF binding site are more than 70% identical to yeast Sec7 and similarly identical to ARNO, the human ARF exchange factor, with correct positioning of the critical glutamic acid residue within the motif region. Overall, the identity of PSec7 to yeast Sec7 is 32%. The deduced amino acid sequence also has five sequences that resemble IQ motifs, EF hand binding domains found in all myosins, and two pleckstrin homology domains. Similar sequences are present in yeast Sec7 and other Sec7-related molecules. A protein kinase A phosphorylation site may also be present. Southern blots suggest that a single gene encodes PSec7. Northern blots show that the message encoding PSec7 is induced on deciliation, followed by ciliogenesis, which suggests a role for PSec7 in cilia such as transport or targeting of ciliary membrane components."
