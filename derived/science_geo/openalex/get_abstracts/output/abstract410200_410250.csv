https://openalex.org/W1983692618,"Three major modes of cancer therapy (surgery, radiation and chemotherapy) are the mainstay of modern oncologic therapy. To minimize the side effects of these therapies, molecular-targeted cancer therapies, including armed antibody therapy, have been developed with limited success. In this study, we have developed a new type of molecular-targeted cancer therapy, photoimmunotherapy (PIT), that uses a target-specific photosensitizer based on a near-infrared (NIR) phthalocyanine dye, IR700, conjugated to monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptors. Cell death was induced immediately after irradiating mAb-IR700-bound target cells with NIR light. We observed in vivo tumor shrinkage after irradiation with NIR light in target cells expressing the epidermal growth factor receptor. The mAb-IR700 conjugates were most effective when bound to the cell membrane and produced no phototoxicity when not bound, suggesting a different mechanism for PIT as compared to conventional photodynamic therapies. Target-selective PIT enables treatment of cancer based on mAb binding to the cell membrane."

Here, we show that much of the tau secreted by M1C cells occurs via exosomal release, a widely characterized mechanism that mediates unconventional secretion of other aggregation-prone proteins (α-synuclein, prion protein, and β-amyloid) in neurodegenerative disease. Exosome-associated tau is also present in human CSF samples and is phosphorylated at Thr-181 (AT270), an established phosphotau biomarker for Alzheimer disease (AD), in both M1C cells and in CSF samples from patients with mild (Braak stage 3) AD. A preliminary analysis of proteins co-purified with tau in secreted exosomes identified several that are known to be involved in disease-associated tau misprocessing. Our results suggest that exosome-mediated secretion of phosphorylated tau may play a significant role in the abnormal processing of tau and in the genesis of elevated CSF tau in early AD.

Here, we report that tau can be exported via an exosome-mediated mechanism in the M1C neuroblastoma tauopathy model (15Ko L.W. Rush T. Sahara N. Kersh J.S. Easson C. Deture M. Lin W.L. Connor Y.D. Yen S.H. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2004; 6: 605-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), where it is enriched in a phosphotau biomarker for early AD (AT270) (16Vanderstichele H. De Vreese K. Blennow K.

We also report that the elevated CSF levels of AT270+ phosphotau seen in mild/moderate cases of sporadic AD relative to non-AD controls (17Arai H. Satoh-Nakagawa T. Higuchi M. Morikawa Y. Miura M.

Sci. 2001; 22: 77-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) can be accounted for by a significant and selective enrichment of AT270+ tau in exosomal fractions of CSF relative to total CSF tau and that this is most marked in mild (Braak stage 3) (19Braak H.

Alzheimer disease cerebrospinal fluid exosome pellet low speed pellet membrane pellet microtubule binding repeat neurofibrillary tangle exon 2,3 tau isoform with four MTBRs. We used M1C cells derived from human neuroblastoma (BE(2)-M17D) cells (kindly provided by Dr. Li Wen Ko of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine, FL) to inducibly express wild-type human tau, with 4R0N (four MTBRs and zero N-terminal inserts) tau expression being induced by the TetOff expression system (TetOff). M1C cells were seeded in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS, G418 (400 μg/ml), hygromycin (100 μg/ml), zeocin (100 μg/ml), and tetracycline (2,000 ng/ml). Tau expression was induced by reduction of tetracycline to 1 ng/ml for 6 days after which time M1C cells (comprising the cell lysate; Fig. 1) were lysed in Tris-NaCl (TN) buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, 2 mm EDTA, Complete EDTA-Ca2+-Free mixture tablet (Roche Applied Science)). Cell lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 10,000 × g for 20 min. A slightly modified version of the basic exosomal purification protocol of Théry et al. (20Théry C. Clayton A. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Curr. Protocols Cell Biol. 2006; : 3.22.1-3.22.29Google Scholar) was used to prepare exosomal fractions from M1C conditioned medium and lysate samples. Conditioned medium from the last 24 h of induction was collected from M1C cells expressing 4R0N tau and sequentially centrifuged at 2,000 × g for 10 min, and 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. To purify exosomes, the supernatant was then centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C to obtain a membrane pellet (MP; Fig. 1B). This pellet was washed in cold PBS and centrifuged again at 100,000 × g for 90 min at 4 °C to remove any contaminating nonexosomal proteins. The supernatant (ES), with non–exosome-associated tau, was collected, and the pellet (EP), containing exosomes, was resuspended in 50 μl of PBS. Whole cell lysate/media samples and exosome fractions of these samples were analyzed by Western blotting. Electrophoresed samples were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and incubated with the following primary antibodies: tau12 (1:10,000), K9JA (1:1,000; DAKO), anti-PDCD61P/Alix (1:500; Invitrogen), anti-flotillin 1 (1:1,000; Abcam), and anti-EEA1 (1:1,000; Abcam). Goat anti-mouse (1:10,000) or anti-rabbit (1:10,000) IgG, with or without alkaline phosphatase-conjugated second antibodies, were applied as second antibodies. Western blot images were obtained using a chemiluminescence (Pierce) or 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitroblue tetrazolium substrate. The additional sucrose fractionation step given by Théry et al. for “viscous bodily fluids” (supporting protocol 7) for preparing exosomes (20Théry C. Clayton A. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Curr. Protocols Cell Biol. 2006; : 3.22.1-3.22.29Google Scholar) was added to the basic protocol described above (20Théry C. Clayton A. Amigorena S. Raposo G. Curr. Protocols Cell Biol. 2006; : 3.22.1-3.22.29Google Scholar) for the isolation of CSF exosomal fractions. Membrane pellets isolated by ultracentifugation from CSF samples as described above were resuspended with 2 ml of isolation buffer and a linear sucrose gradient (2.0–0.25 msucrose in 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.2) was layered on top of the exosome suspension. The sample was then centrifuged at 70,000 × g for 16 h at 4 °C and immunoblotted as described above or subjected to ELISA as described below. This approach was also used in some cases to identify and isolate specific populations of membranous vesicles (i.e. nuclei, mitochondria, Golgi, exosomes) from the MP (Fig. 1B and results not shown). A simpler version of this method directed at exosomes only was used to prepare exosomal fractions from membrane pellets of MC1 lysate and media fractions to be analyzed by EM and mass spectrometry. Direct ELISAs were done using the anti-phosphorylated tau mAb against phosphorylated Thr-181 (AT270) and an mAb capable of recognizing all tau isoforms (tau12) (see Figs. 1A and 3A). ELISA readings were converted to protein estimates using standard curves generated against optimized dilutions of each mAb. We used the ratios of tau phosphorylated at Thr-181 (AT270) to total tau (tau12) protein levels to characterize the phosphorylation state of CSF tau samples with a kit (KHO0631; Invitrogen) designed for ELISA quantitation of Thr-181 with modifications as described for use with mouse mAbs. All samples were diluted to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml protein in carbonate buffer. Wells of a PVC microtiter plate were coated with the diluted sample using the protocol provided with the kit. This was followed by addition of monoclonal antibodies AT270 and tau12 at dilutions of 1:1,500, 1:2,000, and 1:3,000, respectively. Optimal dilutions for each mAb were selected based on standard curves generated as described below. Goat anti-mouse IgG HRP secondary (ScC2005; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used as recommended at a concentration of 1:2,000. Revealing was done with a tetramethylbenzidine-based stabilized peroxidase substrate kit (KPL) on a Spectra Max M2 plate reader spectrophotometer (Molecular Devices). Standard curves were generated using purified antigen samples as follows. For AT270, standard dilutions of purified phosphotau Thr-181 supplied with the kit were used as directed. For tau12, purified recombinant tau381(4R0N) obtained from rPeptide were diluted serially and used to prepare three standard curves, with the curve yielding the greatest linearity in the picomole range being used for the calculation of sample protein concentration. For the correlation of AT270 distribution with Braak stage (see Fig. 3), we used the Innotest phosphotau assay kit (Innogenetics, Atlanta, GA), which employs the H7 mAb to capture CSF tau, which is then revealed using AT270. Assays were performed exactly as directed by the manufacturers' instructions. CSF and brain samples used in this study were collected as part of the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease Center Brain Bank located at the Edith Nourse Rogers Memorial Veterans Hospital (Bedford, MA) following institutional IRB approval. The brains of all patients included were neuropathologically analyzed for limbic and isocortical neurofibrillary pathology and Braak-staged (19Braak H. Braak E. Acta Neuropathol. 1991; 82: 239-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (11766) Google Scholar). Control (Braak stage 0–2, n = 9), mild AD (Braak stage 3–4, n = 10), and moderate AD (Braak stage 5, n = 7) groups had similar age profiles (77.6 ± 3.9, 81.6 ± 1.2, respectively) and postmortem intervals (11.3 ± 2.5, 14 ± 8, 14.2 ± 1.8 h, respectively). Because the goal of the study was to distinguish the exosomal contribution of total and AT270+ phosphotau specifically in AD, we included, as controls, brains with vascular lesions and/or Lewy bodies, as long as there was no neuropathological evidence of a tauopathy. We rejected samples from patients diagnosed with conditions associated with AD-like CSF tau levels or featuring ongoing pathogenesis involving the limbic and isocortices (e.g. multi-infarct, vascular (17Arai H. Satoh-Nakagawa T. Higuchi M. Morikawa Y. Miura M. Kawakami H. Seki H. Takase S. Sasaki H. Neurosci. Lett. 1998; 256: 174-176Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and Lewy body (18Parnetti L. Lanari A. Amici S. Gallai V. Vanmechelen E. Hulstaert F. Neurol. Sci. 2001; 22: 77-78Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) dementias were included; corticobasal degeneration, Pick disease, and prion diseases were excluded). Samples containing blood or other visible impurities were rejected. All CSF samples (1–4 ml/subject) were kept frozen at −80 ºC without freeze/thaw cycles after collection postmortem and were provided in polystyrene tubes. For all ELISA analyses, we subjected raw CSF samples to a standard low speed spin (2,000 × g, 30 min) and kept the supernatants for further processing and analysis. Low speed pellets from control (Braak stage 0), very mild (Braak stage 3), and severe (Braak stage 6) AD cases were photographed immediately after centrifugation and were assayed for tau content by direct ELISA (see Fig. 3C). Phosphatase inhibitor (20 μl/liter sample of Halt Phosphatase Inhibitor mixture, which was 2× the effective concentration given by the manufacturer) was added to all samples upon initial thawing. Pellets collected after the second 100,000 × g centrifugation step were fixed 20 min in 2% paraformaldehyde, loaded on Formvar/carbon-coated EM grids, and contrasted in 2% uranyl acetate, pH 7, and 2% methylcellulose/0.4% uranyl acetate, pH 4. Grids were postfixed 15 min in 1% glutaraldehyde for 5 min, washed 8 times with distilled water, contrasted, and embedded before examination using a CM 10 Twin Phillips electron microscope at 80 kV (Phillips Electronic Instruments, Rahway, NJ). Immunogold labeling of exosome preparations was accomplished by treating the Formvar grids with exosome sample prepared as described above, blocking with 1% BSA/5% normal goat serum followed by incubation with anti-ALIX/PDCD61P primary diluted 1:25 in blocking solution, followed by PBS rinse and incubation with 10 mm gold-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG secondary (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Samples from all fractions were diluted 1:1 with Laemmli sample buffer (Bio-Rad) containing 5% v/v 2-mercaptoethanol. Tris-HCl gels and Tris/glycine/SDS buffer were used for electrophoresis. Electrophoresis was performed first at a constant 90 V for 10 min and then at a constant 150 V until the dye front reached the end of the gel. A Bio-Rad Trans-Blot transfer cell and 40% Tris/glycine, 40% Tris/glycine/SDS, 20% methanol were used to transfer proteins to Bio-Rad Immun-Blot PVDF membranes at a constant 20 V overnight. Tryptic digests of peptides for mass spectrometry were performed using the In-Gel tryptic digest kit (Thermo Scientific). Samples of digested peptides from raw and exosomal fractions of M1C lysates and media were desalted and analyzed by MALDI mass spectroscopy in the positive mode at the Boston University, Chemical Instrumentation Center using standard reverse phase LC/MS (injection volume, 10 μl) Electrospray ionization on a Waters Qtof API US instrument from 100 to 8,000 m/z. The optimized conditions were found as follows: capillary, 3,000 kV; cone, 35; source temperature, 120 °C; and desolvation temperature, 350 °C. The gradient was 100% A (water + 0.1% formic Acid) to 100% B (acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) at 0.5 ml/min in 30 min. The column (Inertsil ODS-4, GL Sciences) used was a 250 × 4.6 mm with a particle size of 5 μm. Deconvolution was carried out by MaxEnt 1. Identification of proteins containing specific peptide sequences was accomplished by searching online data bases maintained on the ExPASy proteomics server using the peptide mass fingerprinting tool MASCOT (Matrix Science Ltd., London, UK). Only proteins with match ratios (based on Mascot data base searches) indicating a 95% or greater confidence in the identity of the specific protein listed were included. A subset of 65 of these proteins (supplemental Table 1) that was identified in 60% or more of the samples tested and enriched in secreted versus lysate exosome fractions was analyzed further (Fig. 2A). Semiquantitative analysis of protein enrichment (for both associated proteins and phosphotau peptides (Fig. 3B) was based on a comparison of peak heights between cell lysate and media-derived exosome fractions. A one-tailed Student's t test for unpaired samples was used to determine the significance of the 2-fold mean difference in AT270+ between control and AD samples, whereas a two-tailed t test for pairwise comparisons between linked data sets was used to determine whether AT270+ tau was significantly enriched in exosomal fractions compared with whole CSF samples in both control and AD patients. Fisher's exact test was used to test the significance of Braak staging on the distribution of AT270 tau between total CSF and exosomal fractions (see Fig. 3). Image processing of Western blots (Figs. 1C and 2, B and E) and EM micrographs (Fig. 2C) was minimal and performed as needed only for lettering and sizing using Adobe Photoshop according to JBC guidelines. We extended earlier studies of 4R0N tau secretion from M1C neuroblastoma cells (2Kim W. Lee S. Hall G.F. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3085-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar) by investigating the possibility that the tau found in M1C conditioned media after TetOff induction (15Ko L.W. Rush T. Sahara N. Kersh J.S. Easson C. Deture M. Lin W.L. Connor Y.D. Yen S.H. J. Alzheimers Dis. 2004; 6: 605-622Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) is membrane-associated, because nonconstitutive unconventional protein secretion pathways typically involve the release of proteins associated with vesicles (21Nickel W. Traffic. 2005; 6: 607-614Crossref PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar). M1C media samples were collected from cultures after 24 h of 4R0N tau induction and subjected to sequential high speed centrifugations to isolate exosomal, nonexosomal membrane and nonmembrane fractions (Fig. 1B) from M1C supernatants and cell lysates, which were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting for the presence of tau. The identity of each fraction was verified by immunoblotting of crude MPs, nonexosomal supernatants (ES, MS), and exosome pellet (EP) fractions with antibodies against endosome (EEA1), lipid raft (flotillin 1), and exosome (PDCD61P/Alix) markers (Fig. 2B). Secreted tau was present in all three fractions as a strong 45-kDa band that was immunopositive for N terminus (tau12) and MTBR-specific (K9JA) antibodies, suggesting that it had been C-terminal-truncated but was otherwise intact (2Kim W. Lee S. Hall G.F. FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3085-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Immunoelectron microscopic analysis of tau-containing exosome fractions showed vesicular elements of uniform appearance with the expected size (∼40–100 nm) and morphology of exosomes (21Nickel W.

Mass spectrometric analysis of tau-containing exosome fractions secreted from M1C cells identified a large number of associated proteins (24Pan S. Aebersold R. Chen R. Rush J. Goodlett D.R.

Although a detailed analysis of these proteins and their relationship to tau secretion is beyond the scope of this report, we performed a preliminary categorization of 65 proteins that were enriched in media exosome fractions relative to lysate fractions (Fig. 2A). The majority of these (82%) were membrane proteins or membrane-associated proteins involved in signal transduction and vesicle trafficking, including the widely cited markers of exosomes flotillin 1 and Alix (Fig. 2B). A large minority (34%) were proteins that have been reported to interact specifically with tau in ways that could favor its oligomerization, inclusion in exosomes, and ultimately its secretion (26Fang Y. Wu N. Gan X. Yan W. Morrell J.C. Gould S.J. PLoS Biol. 2007; 5: e158Crossref PubMed Scopus (288) Google Scholar), primarily via the phosphorylation of sites associated with tau oligomerization and toxicity (27Lee G. Newman S.T. Gard D.L.

We used mass spectrometry to identify specific tau peptides (N-terminal, proline-rich, and MTBR regions) in both cell lysate and media exosomal fractions, confirming earlier work in this system based on Western blot analysis (1Kim W.

FEBS Lett. 2010; 584: 3085-3088Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). In particular, we found prominent peaks in exosome-associated secreted tau samples that were specific for tau phosphoepitopes (AT180, AT100, AT270, AT8, and PHF1) associated with AD. (Fig. 2D). Quantitative comparisons between peaks representing specific phosphotau epitopes in exosome fractions from media and cell lysate samples showed that phosphorylated sites in the proline-rich domain of tau (AT270, AT8, AT100, and AT180) were most strongly enriched in secreted tau (Fig. 2D). Interestingly, AT270 (Thr(P)-181), the site most enriched in secreted (exosomal) tau, is also an established biomarker for the elevated tau seen in early AD and is used in CSF-based diagnostics for AD (16Vanderstichele H. De Vreese K. Blennow K. Andreasen N. Sindic C. Ivanoiu A. Hampel H. Bürger K. Parnetti L. Lanari A. Padovani A. DiLuca M. Bläser M. Olsson A.O. Pottel H. Hulstaert F. Vanmechelen E. Clin. Chem. Lab. Med. 2006; 44: 1472-1480Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To test directly the possible link between exosome-associated tau secretion and AD, we used Western blotting to determine whether the enrichment of AT270 tau seen in exosomally secreted tau fractions from M1C cultures was also present in similarly isolated fractions of CSF from mild (Braak stage 3) and established AD (Braak stage 5) cases (note that a sucrose fractionation step was added to the fractionation protocol for isolating CSF exosomes; see “Experimental Procedures”). We found that such fractions were enriched in Alix (Fig. 2E) and strongly positive for AT270+ tau (Fig. 2F). AT270+ tau was localized to a few major bands (35, 52, and 68 kDa), one of which (68 kDa) is characteristic of NFT tau in AD (32Lee V.M. Balin B.J. Otvos Jr., L. Trojanowski J.Q.

Prominent higher molecular mass (80–150 kDa) bands in both unfractionated and exosomal fractions of CSF samples were 100% sensitive to high stringency denaturation (20-min heating in 2× SDS at 90 ºC). Because tau is resistant to heat-induced precipitation (35Weingarten M.D. Lockwood A.H. Hwo S.Y. Kirschner M.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 1975; 72: 1858-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar), this indicates that the high molecular mass bands were due to noncovalent association with other proteins, most likely tau itself, because tau readily forms low level oligomers when associated with microtubules (36Makrides V.

Chem. 2003; 278: 25644-25650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). In exosomal fractions, most AT270+ high molecular mass tau was concentrated in a strong, well defined band at around 105 kDa instead of the broad band between 80 and 150 kDa, which reduced to a very strong band at 35 kDa plus a widening of the 52-kDa band with stringent denaturation (Fig. 2F). This result thus strongly suggests that a large part of the exosomal AT270+ tau is in fact the 35-kDa tau species that has dimerized (70 kDa) and especially trimerized (105 kDa). The range of sizes associated with the total CSF sample between 80- and 150-kDa apparent molecular mass might contain variously cleaved tau oligomers associated with NFTs (38Guillozet-Bongaarts A.L.

Although low-grade inflammation is detected in osteoarthritis, its role is unclear. Here we identify a central role for the inflammatory complement system in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Through proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of synovial fluids and membranes from individuals with osteoarthritis, we find that expression and activation of complement is abnormally high in human osteoarthritic joints. Using mice genetically deficient in complement component 5 (C5), C6 or the complement regulatory protein CD59a, we show that complement, specifically, the membrane attack complex (MAC)-mediated arm of complement, is crucial to the development of arthritis in three different mouse models of osteoarthritis. Pharmacological modulation of complement in wild-type mice confirmed the results obtained with genetically deficient mice. Expression of inflammatory and degradative molecules was lower in chondrocytes from destabilized joints from C5-deficient mice than C5-sufficient mice, and MAC induced production of these molecules in cultured chondrocytes. Further, MAC colocalized with matrix metalloprotease 13 (MMP13) and with activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) around chondrocytes in human osteoarthritic cartilage. Our findings indicate that dysregulation of complement in synovial joints has a key role in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis."
https://openalex.org/W2051458654,"b-AP15 is a novel inhibitor of proteasome activity, with a different mechanism of action than the available and widely used proteasome inhibitors such as bortezomib. b-AP15 inhibits the deubiquitinating activity of the regulatory subunit of the proteasome, necessary for protein degradation, and induces cytotoxicity impairing tumor growth in mouse models. The compound may represent an alternative therapeutic approach with a broader spectrum of applicability than current proteasome inhibitors. Ubiquitin-tagged substrates are degraded by the 26S proteasome, which is a multisubunit complex comprising a proteolytic 20S core particle capped by 19S regulatory particles1,2. The approval of bortezomib for the treatment of multiple myeloma validated the 20S core particle as an anticancer drug target3. Here we describe the small molecule b-AP15 as a previously unidentified class of proteasome inhibitor that abrogates the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle. b-AP15 inhibited the activity of two 19S regulatory-particle–associated deubiquitinases, ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 5 (UCHL5) and ubiquitin-specific peptidase 14 (USP14), resulting in accumulation of polyubiquitin. b-AP15 induced tumor cell apoptosis that was insensitive to TP53 status and overexpression of the apoptosis inhibitor BCL2. We show that treatment with b-AP15 inhibited tumor progression in four different in vivo solid tumor models and inhibited organ infiltration in an acute myeloid leukemia model. Our results show that the deubiquitinating activity of the 19S regulatory particle is a new anticancer drug target."

Hongki Yoo et al. have successfully done just that by combining two existing intravascular imaging techniques into a single catheter-based system. Their dual-modality intra-arterial catheter uses a combination of optical frequency domain imaging and near-infrared fluorescence imaging to simultaneously provide molecular information in the context of the surrounding three-dimensional microanatomy of the artery wall. Advancing understanding of human coronary artery disease requires new methods that can be used in patients for studying atherosclerotic plaque microstructure in relation to the molecular mechanisms that underlie its initiation, progression and clinical complications, including myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Here we report a dual-modality intra-arterial catheter for simultaneous microstructural and molecular imaging in vivo using a combination of optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) and near-infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging. By providing simultaneous molecular information in the context of the surrounding tissue microstructure, this new catheter could provide new opportunities for investigating coronary atherosclerosis and stent healing and for identifying high-risk biological and structural coronary arterial plaques in vivo."

Lymphoid-tissue resident CD8α+ conventional DCs (cDCs) and CD11blow/−CD103+ non-lymphoid DCs are developmentally related, each being dependent on FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt3L), and requiring the transcription factors Batf3, Irf8, and Id2 for development. It was recently suggested that granulocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was required for the development of dermal CD11blow/−Langerin+CD103+ DCs, and that this dermal DC subset was required for priming autoreactive T cells in experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE). Here, we compared development of peripheral tissue DCs and susceptibility to EAE in GM-CSF receptor deficient (Csf2rb−/−) and Batf3−/− mice. We find that Batf3-dependent dermal CD11blow/−Langerin+ DCs do develop in Csf2rb−/− mice, but that they express reduced, but not absent, levels of CD103. Further, Batf3−/− mice lacking all peripheral CD11blow/− DCs show robust Th cell priming after subcutaneous immunization and are susceptible to EAE. Our results suggest that defective T effector priming and resistance to EAE exhibited by Csf2rb−/− mice does not result from the absence of dermal CD11blow/−Langerin+CD103+ DCs."
https://openalex.org/W2066914964,"The Symbiodinium community associated with scleractinian corals is widely considered to be shaped by seawater temperature, as the coral's upper temperature tolerance is largely contingent on the Symbiodinium types harboured. Few studies have challenged this paradigm as knowledge of other environmental drivers on the distribution of Symbiodinium is limited. Here, we examine the influence of a range of environmental variables on the distribution of Symbiodinium associated with Acropora millepora collected from 47 coral reefs spanning 1,400 km on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia.The environmental data included Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data at 1 km spatial resolution from which a number of sea surface temperature (SST) and water quality metrics were derived. In addition, the carbonate and mud composition of sediments were incorporated into the analysis along with in situ water quality samples for a subset of locations. Analyses were conducted at three spatio-temporal scales [GBR (regional-scale), Whitsunday Islands (local-scale) and Keppel Islands/Trunk Reef (temporal)] to examine the effects of scale on the distribution patterns. While SST metrics were important drivers of the distribution of Symbiodinium types at regional and temporal scales, our results demonstrate that spatial variability in water quality correlates significantly with Symbiodinium distribution at local scales. Background levels of Symbiodinium types were greatest at turbid inshore locations of the Whitsunday Islands where SST predictors were not as important. This was not the case at regional scales where combinations of mud and carbonate sediment content coupled with SST anomalies and mean summer SST explained 51.3% of the variation in dominant Symbiodinium communities.Reef corals may respond to global-scale stressors such as climate change through changes in their resident symbiont communities, however, management of local-scale stressors such as altered water quality is also necessary for maintenance of coral-Symbiodinium associations."
https://openalex.org/W1971352608,"Uracil accumulates in DNA as a result of impaired folate-dependent de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, a pathway composed of the enzymes serine hydroxymethyltransferase (SHMT), thymidylate synthase (TYMS), and dihydrofolate reductase. In G1, this pathway is present in the cytoplasm and at S phase undergoes small ubiquitin-like modifier-dependent translocation to the nucleus. It is not known whether this pathway functions in the cytoplasm, nucleus, or both in vivo. SHMT1 generates 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate for de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, a limiting step in the pathway, but also tightly binds 5-methyltetrahydrofolate in the cytoplasm, a required cofactor for homocysteine remethylation. Overexpression of SHMT1 in cell cultures inhibits folate-dependent homocysteine remethylation and enhances thymidylate biosynthesis. In this study, the impact of increased Shmt1 expression on folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism was determined in mice that overexpress the Shmt1 cDNA (Shmt1tg+ mice). Compared with wild type mice, Shmt1tg+ mice exhibited elevated SHMT1 and TYMS protein levels in tissues and evidence for impaired homocysteine remethylation but surprisingly exhibited depressed levels of nuclear SHMT1 and TYMS, lower rates of nuclear de novo thymidylate biosynthesis, and a nearly 10-fold increase in uracil content in hepatic nuclear DNA when fed a folate- and choline-deficient diet. These results demonstrate that SHMT1 and TYMS localization to the nucleus is essential to prevent uracil accumulation in nuclear DNA and indicate that SHMT1-mediated nuclear de novo thymidylate synthesis is critical for maintaining DNA integrity."
https://openalex.org/W2088710419,"Anti-amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein APP by α-secretase prevents formation of the amyloid-β peptide, which accumulates in senile plaques of Alzheimer disease patients. α-Secretase belongs to the family of a disintegrin and metalloproteases (ADAMs), and ADAM10 is the primary candidate for this anti-amyloidogenic activity. We recently demonstrated that ADAM10 translation is repressed by its 5'-UTR and that in particular the first half of ADAM10 5'-UTR is responsible for translational repression. Here, we asked whether specific sequence motifs exist in the ADAM10 5'-UTR that are able to form complex secondary structures and thus potentially inhibit ADAM10 translation. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, we demonstrate that a G-rich region between nucleotides 66 and 94 of the ADAM10 5'-UTR forms a highly stable, intramolecular, parallel G-quadruplex secondary structure under physiological conditions. Mutation of guanines in this sequence abrogates the formation of the G-quadruplex structure. Although the G-quadruplex structure efficiently inhibits translation of a luciferase reporter in in vitro translation assays and in living cells, inhibition of G-quadruplex formation fails to do so. Moreover, expression of ADAM10 was similarly repressed by the G-quadruplex. Mutation of the G-quadruplex motif results in a significant increase of ADAM10 levels and consequently APPsα secretion. Thus, we identified a critical RNA secondary structure within the 5'-UTR, which contributes to the translational repression of ADAM10."
https://openalex.org/W2083772202,"Humans express nine paralogs of the bacterial DNA repair enzyme AlkB, an iron/2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase that reverses alkylation damage to nucleobases. The biochemical and physiological roles of these paralogs remain largely uncharacterized, hampering insight into the evolutionary expansion of the AlkB family. However, AlkB homolog 8 (ABH8), which contains RNA recognition motif (RRM) and methyltransferase domains flanking its AlkB domain, recently was demonstrated to hypermodify the anticodon loops in some tRNAs. To deepen understanding of this activity, we performed physiological and biophysical studies of ABH8. Using GFP fusions, we demonstrate that expression of the Caenorhabditis elegans ABH8 ortholog is widespread in larvae but restricted to a small number of neurons in adults, suggesting that its function becomes more specialized during development. In vitro RNA binding studies on several human ABH8 constructs indicate that binding affinity is enhanced by a basic α-helix at the N terminus of the RRM domain. The 3.0-Å-resolution crystal structure of a construct comprising the RRM and AlkB domains shows disordered loops flanking the active site in the AlkB domain and a unique structural Zn(II)-binding site at its C terminus. Although the catalytic iron center is exposed to solvent, the 2-oxoglutarate co-substrate likely adopts an inactive conformation in the absence of tRNA substrate, which probably inhibits uncoupled free radical generation. A conformational change in the active site coupled to a disorder-to-order transition in the flanking protein segments likely controls ABH8 catalytic activity and tRNA binding specificity. These results provide insight into the functional and structural adaptations underlying evolutionary diversification of AlkB domains."
https://openalex.org/W1999965800,"Cyclin D1 (CCND1) has been associated with chemotherapy resistance and poor prognosis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that CCND1 expression determines response and clinical outcomes in locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy.224 patients with HNSCC were treated with either cisplatin-based chemotherapy followed by surgery and radiotherapy (neoadjuvant group, n = 100) or surgery and radiotherapy (non-neoadjuvant group, n = 124). CCND1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry. CCND1 levels were analyzed with chemotherapy response, disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). There was no significant difference between the neoadjuvant group and non-neoadjuvant group in DFS and OS (p = 0.929 and p = 0.760) when patients treated with the indiscriminate administration of cisplatin-based chemotherapy. However, in the neoadjuvant group, patients whose tumors showed a low CCND1 expression more likely respond to chemotherapy (p<0.001) and had a significantly better OS and DFS than those whose tumors showed a high CCND1 expression (73% vs 8%, p<0.001; 63% vs 6%, p<0.001). Importantly, patients with a low CCND1 expression in neoadjuvant group received more survival benefits than those in non-neoadjuvant group (p = 0.016), however patients with a high CCND1 expression and treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy had a significantly poor OS compared to those treated with surgery and radiotherapy (p = 0.032). A multivariate survival analysis also showed CCND1 expression was an independent predictive factor (p<0.001).This study suggests that some but not all patients with HNSCC may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimen and CCND1 expression may serve as a predictive biomarker in selecting patients undergo less than two cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
https://openalex.org/W2020259260,"West Nile virus is an emerging virus whose virulence is dependent upon viral evasion of IFN and innate immune defenses. The actions of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) impart control of virus infection, but the specific ISGs and regulatory pathways that restrict West Nile virus (WNV) are not defined. Here we show that inhibitor of κB kinase ε (IKKε) phosphorylation of STAT1 at serine 708 (Ser-708) drives IFIT2 expression to mediate anti-WNV effector function of IFN. WNV infection was enhanced in cells from IKKε(-/-) or IFIT2(-/-) mice. In IKKε(-/-) cells, the loss of IFN-induced IFIT2 expression was linked to lack of STAT1 phosphorylation on Ser-708 but not Tyr-701 nor Ser-727. STAT1 Ser-708 phosphorylation occurs independently of IRF-3 but requires signaling through the IFN-α/β receptor as a late event in the IFN-induced innate immune response that coincides with IKKε-responsive ISGs expression. Biochemical analyses show that STAT1 tyrosine dephosphorylation and CRM1-mediated STAT1 nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling are required for STAT1 Ser-708 phosphorylation. When compared with WT mice, WNV-infected IKKε(-/-) mice exhibit enhanced kinetics of virus dissemination and increased pathogenesis concomitant with loss of STAT1 Ser-708 phosphorylation and IFIT2 expression. Our results define an IFN-induced IKKε signaling pathway of specific STAT1 phosphorylation and IFIT2 expression that imparts innate antiviral immunity to restrict WNV infection and control viral pathogenesis."
https://openalex.org/W1984871200,"Neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells in response to NGF is a prototypical model in which signal duration determines a biological response. Sustained ERK activity induced by NGF, as compared with transient activity induced by EGF, is critical to the differentiation of these cells. To characterize the transcriptional program activated preferentially by NGF, we compared global gene expression profiles between cells treated with NGF and EGF for 2-4 h, when sustained ERK signaling in response to NGF is most distinct from the transient signal elicited by EGF. This analysis identified 69 genes that were preferentially up-regulated in response to NGF. As expected, up-regulation of these genes was mediated by sustained ERK signaling. In addition, they were up-regulated in response to other neuritogenic treatments (pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide and 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate plus dbcAMP) and were enriched for genes related to neuronal differentiation/function. Computational analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation identified binding of CREB and AP-1 family members (Fos, FosB, Fra1, JunB, JunD) upstream of >30 and 50%, respectively, of the preferentially NGF-induced genes. Expression of several AP-1 family members was induced by both EGF and NGF, but their induction was more robust and sustained in response to NGF. The binding of Fos family members to their target genes was similarly sustained in response to NGF and was reduced upon MEK inhibition, suggesting that AP-1 contributes significantly to the NGF transcriptional program. Interestingly, Fra1 as well as two other NGF-induced AP-1 targets (HB-EGF and miR-21) function in positive feedback loops that may contribute to sustained AP-1 activity."

However, in contrast to the situation in other animals, e.g., frogs and insects, little is known about the molecular basis of coral metamorphosis. We have begun to redress this situation with previous microarray studies, but there is still a great deal to learn. In the present paper we have utilized a different technology, subtractive hybridization, to characterize genes differentially expressed across this developmental transition and to compare the success of this method to microarray.Suppressive subtractive hybridization (SSH) was used to identify two pools of transcripts from the coral, Acropora millepora. One is enriched for transcripts expressed at higher levels at the pre-settlement stage, and the other for transcripts expressed at higher levels at the post-settlement stage. Virtual northern blots were used to demonstrate the efficacy of the subtractive hybridization technique. Both pools contain transcripts coding for proteins in various functional classes but transcriptional regulatory proteins were represented more frequently in the post-settlement pool. Approximately 18% of the transcripts showed no significant similarity to any other sequence on the public databases. Transcripts of particular interest were further characterized by in situ hybridization, which showed that many are regulated spatially as well as temporally. Notably, many transcripts exhibit axially restricted expression patterns that correlate with the pool from which they were isolated. Several transcripts are expressed in patterns consistent with a role in calcification.We have characterized over 200 transcripts that are differentially expressed between the planula larva and post-settlement polyp of the coral, Acropora millepora. Sequence, putative function, and in some cases temporal and spatial expression are reported."

Moreover, we identified a conserved cAMP-response element (CRE) in the murine RGS2 promoter that is critical for cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) binding and RGS2 promoter activation.

https://openalex.org/W2062880614,"Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is a component of the innate immune system that recognizes a diverse group of molecular structures, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from Gram-negative bacteria. TLR4 signaling ultimately leads to activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), and the production of cytokines. Ceramide is a bioactive sphingolipid that has been suggested to regulate TLR4-induced NF-κB signaling, although reports on the role of ceramide in TLR4 activation conflict. We investigated the possibility that ceramide metabolites, such as ceramide-1-phosphate (C-1-P), may explain these discrepancies. We now report that exogenous C-1-P, but not ceramide, reduces NF-κB-mediated gene transcription in HEK 293 cells stably transfected with human TLR4, CD14, and MD-2. We demonstrate that inhibition of NF-κB by exogenous C-1-P is dose-dependent and specific to TLR4 in a reporter assay. We further demonstrate a requirement for both the phosphate moiety and the sphingoid backbone to inhibit LPS-activated NF-κB transcription. Specifically, C-1-P prevents the degradation of IκB, the phosphorylation of the p65 subunit of NF-κB, and LPS-stimulated MAPK activation. The functional consequence of C-1-P inhibition of NF-κB is a reduction in LPS-mediated cytokine release from HEK 293 TLR4-expressing cells and human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that C-1-P may function as an anti-inflammatory lipid mediator of immune response."
https://openalex.org/W2009505899,The import of a subset of peroxisomal matrix proteins is mediated by the peroxisomal targeting signal 2 (PTS2). The results of our sequence and physical property analysis of known PTS2 signals and of a mutational study of the least characterized amino acids of a canonical PTS2 motif indicate that PTS2 forms an amphipathic helix accumulating all conserved residues on one side. Three-dimensional structural modeling of the PTS2 receptor PEX7 reveals a groove with an evolutionarily conserved charge distribution complementary to PTS2 signals. Mammalian two-hybrid assays and cross-complementation of a mutation in PTS2 by a compensatory mutation in PEX7 confirm the interaction site. An unstructured linker region separates the PTS2 signal from the core protein. This additional information on PTS2 signals was used to generate a PTS2 prediction algorithm that enabled us to identify novel PTS2 signals within human proteins and to describe KChIP4 as a novel peroxisomal protein.
https://openalex.org/W2056281941,"We investigated whether lateral masking in the near-periphery, due to inhibitory lateral interactions at an early level of central visual processing, could be weakened by perceptual learning and whether learning transferred to an untrained, higher-level lateral masking known as crowding. The trained task was contrast detection of a Gabor target presented in the near periphery (4°) in the presence of co-oriented and co-aligned high contrast Gabor flankers, which featured different target-to-flankers separations along the vertical axis that varied from 2λ to 8λ. We found both suppressive and facilitatory lateral interactions at target-to-flankers distances (2λ - 4λ and 8λ, respectively) that were larger than those found in the fovea. Training reduces suppression but does not increase facilitation. Most importantly, we found that learning reduces crowding and improves contrast sensitivity, but has no effect on visual acuity (VA). These results suggest a different pattern of connectivity in the periphery with respect to the fovea as well as a different modulation of this connectivity via perceptual learning that not only reduces low-level lateral masking but also reduces crowding. These results have important implications for the rehabilitation of low-vision patients who must use peripheral vision to perform tasks, such as reading and refined figure-ground segmentation, which normal sighted subjects perform in the fovea."

The peptide's cytotoxic activity was found to be markedly dependent upon the position of the Trp residues within the hydrophobic sector of an idealized α-helix. The peptides with Trp residues located opposite the cationic sector displayed no antitumor activity, whereas those peptides with two or three Trp residues located adjacent to the cationic sector exhibited high cytotoxic activity when tested against three different cancer cell lines. Dye release experiments revealed that in contrast to the peptides with Trp residues located opposite the cationic sector, the peptides with Trp residues located adjacent to the cationic sector induced a strong permeabilizing activity from liposomes composed of a mixture of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine and negatively charged phosphatidylserine (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC)/1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-l-serine (POPS)) (2:1) but not from liposomes composed of zwitterionic phosphatidylcholine, POPC. Fluorescence blue shift and quenching experiments revealed that Trp residues inserted deeper into the hydrophobic environment of POPC/POPS liposomes for peptides with high cytotoxic activity. Through circular dichroism studies, a correlation between the cytotoxic activity and the α-helical propensity was established. Structural studies of one inactive and two active peptides in the presence of micelles using NMR spectroscopy showed that only the active peptides adopted highly coiled to helical structures when bound to a membrane surface. The cytotoxic activity of 10 analogs of the idealized amphipathic helical 21-mer peptide (KAAKKAA)3, where three of the Ala residues at different positions have been replaced with Trp residues, has been investigated. The peptide's cytotoxic activity was found to be markedly dependent upon the position of the Trp residues within the hydrophobic sector of an idealized α-helix. The peptides with Trp residues located opposite the cationic sector displayed no antitumor activity, whereas those peptides with two or three Trp residues located adjacent to the cationic sector exhibited high cytotoxic activity when tested against three different cancer cell lines.

First, ATP itself is thought to be a chemotactic “find me” signal released by dying cells, and second, autocrine ATP signaling is implicated as an amplifier mechanism for chemotactic navigation to end-target chemoattractants, such as complement C5a. Here we show using real-time chemotaxis assays that mouse peritoneal macrophages do not directionally migrate to stable analogs of ATP (adenosine-5′-(γ-thio)-triphosphate (ATPγS)) or its hydrolysis product ADP (adenosine-5′-(β-thio)-diphosphate (ADPβS)). HPLC revealed that these synthetic P2Y2 (ATPγS) and P2Y12 (ADPβS) receptor ligands were in fact slowly degraded. We also found that ATPγS, but not ADPβS, promoted chemokinesis (increased random migration). Furthermore, we found that photorelease of ATP or ADP induced lamellipodial membrane extensions. At the cell signaling level, C5a, but not ATPγS, activated Akt, whereas both ligands induced p38 MAPK activation. p38 MAPK and Akt activation are strongly implicated in neutrophil chemotaxis. However, we found that inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K; upstream of Akt) and p38 MAPK (or conditional deletion of p38α MAPK) did not impair macrophage chemotactic efficiency or migration velocity. Our results suggest that PI3K and p38 MAPK are redundant for macrophage chemotaxis and that purinergic P2Y2 and P2Y12 receptor ligands are not chemotactic.

Prevention of this cardiotoxicity remains a critical issue in clinical oncology. We hypothesized that flavaglines, a family of natural compounds that display potent neuroprotective effects, may also alleviate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.Our in vitro data established that a pretreatment with flavaglines significantly increased viability of doxorubicin-injured H9c2 cardiomyocytes as demonstrated by annexin V, TUNEL and active caspase-3 assays. We demonstrated also that phosphorylation of the small heat shock protein Hsp27 is involved in the mechanism by which flavaglines display their cardioprotective effect. Furthermore, knocking-down Hsp27 in H9c2 cardiomyocytes completely reversed this cardioprotection. Administration of our lead compound (FL3) to mice attenuated cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis, as reflected by a 50% decrease of mortality.These results suggest a prophylactic potential of flavaglines to prevent doxorubicin-induced cardiac toxicity."

This splicing event establishes a selectivity filter to restrict the ligand binding specificity of FGFRb and FGFRc isoforms to mesenchymally and epithelially derived fibroblast growth factors (FGFs), respectively. FGF1 is termed the “universal FGFR ligand” because it overrides this specificity barrier. To elucidate the molecular basis for FGF1 cross-reactivity with the “b” and “c” splice isoforms of FGFRs, we determined the first crystal structure of FGF1 in complex with an FGFRb isoform, FGFR2b, at 2.1 Å resolution. Comparison of the FGF1-FGFR2b structure with the three previously published FGF1-FGFRc structures reveals that plasticity in the interactions of the N-terminal region of FGF1 with FGFR D3 is the main determinant of FGF1 cross-reactivity with both isoforms of FGFRs. In support of our structural data, we demonstrate that substitution of three N-terminal residues (Gly-19, His-25, and Phe-26) of FGF2 (a ligand that does not bind FGFR2b) for the corresponding residues of FGF1 (Phe-16, Asn-22, and Tyr-23) enables the FGF2 triple mutant to bind and activate FGFR2b. These findings taken together with our previous structural data on receptor binding specificity of FGF2, FGF8, and FGF10 conclusively show that sequence divergence at the N termini of FGFs is the primary regulator of the receptor binding specificity and promiscuity of FGFs.

We demonstrate that the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) substrate recognition domains of different IpaH enzymes autoinhibit the enzymatic activity of the adjacent catalytic novel E3 ligase domain by two distinct but conserved structural mechanisms. Autoinhibition is required for the in vivo biological activity of two IpaH enzymes in a eukaryotic model system. Autoinhibition was retro-engineered into a constitutively active IpaH enzyme from Yersinia pestis by introduction of single site substitutions, thereby demonstrating the conservation of autoregulatory infrastructure across the IpaH enzyme family."
https://openalex.org/W2055854781,"Background Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) play a key role in host defences against invading microorganisms but can also potentiate detrimental inflammatory reactions in case of excessive or misdirected responses. Intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg) are used to treat patients with immune deficiencies and, at higher doses, in autoimmune, allergic and systemic inflammatory disorders. Methodology/Principal Findings We used flow cytometry to examine the effects of IVIg on PMN functions and survival, using whole-blood conditions in order to avoid artifacts due to isolation procedures. IVIg at low concentrations induced PMN activation, as reflected by decreased L-selectin and increased CD11b expression at the PMN surface, oxidative burst enhancement, and prolonged cell survival. In contrast, IVIg at higher concentrations inhibited LPS-induced CD11b degranulation and oxidative burst priming, and counteracted LPS-induced PMN lifespan prolongation. Conclusions/Significance IVIg appears to have differential, concentration-dependent effects on PMN, possibly supporting the use of IVIg as either an anti-microbial or an anti-inflammatory agent."
https://openalex.org/W2059349902,"[FeFe]-hydrogenases catalyze the reversible production of H2 in some bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes. These enzymes require ancillary proteins to assemble the unique active site H-cluster, a complex structure composed of a 2Fe center bridged to a [4Fe-4S] cubane. The first crystal structure of a key factor in the maturation process, HydF, has been determined at 3 Å resolution. The protein monomer present in the asymmetric unit of the crystal comprises three domains: a GTP-binding domain, a dimerization domain, and a metal cluster-binding domain, all characterized by similar folding motifs. Two monomers dimerize, giving rise to a stable dimer, held together mainly by the formation of a continuous β-sheet comprising eight β-strands from two monomers. Moreover, in the structure presented, two dimers aggregate to form a supramolecular organization that represents an inactivated form of the HydF maturase. The crystal structure of the latter furnishes several clues about the events necessary for cluster generation/transfer and provides an excellent model to begin elucidating the structure/function of HydF in [FeFe]-hydrogenase maturation."
https://openalex.org/W2033029725,"The induction of β-interferon (IFN-β) is a key anti-viral response to infection by RNA viruses. Virus-induced expression of IFN-β requires the co-operative action of the transcription factors IRF-3/7, NF-κB, and ATF-2/c-Jun on the IFN-β promoter leading to the orderly recruitment of chromatin remodeling complexes. Although viruses strongly activate NF-κB and promote its binding to the IFN-β promoter, recent studies have indicated that NF-κB is not essential for virus-induced expression of IFN-β. Herein, we examined the role of NF-κB in regulating IFN-β expression in response to the viral-sensing Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3). Intriguingly pharmacological inhibition of the NF-κB pathway augments late phase expression of IFN-β expression in response to TLR3 stimulation. We show that the negative effect of NF-κB on IFN-β expression is dependent on the induction of the transcriptional repressor protein YinYang1. We demonstrate that the TLR3 ligand polyriboinosinic:polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) induces expression and nuclear translocation of YinYang1 where it interacts with the IFN-β promoter and inhibits the binding of IRF7 to the latter. Evidence is also presented showing that the NF-κB subunits c-Rel and RelB are the likely key drivers of these negative effects on IFN-β expression. These findings thus highlight for the first time a novel self-regulatory mechanism that is employed by TLR3 to limit the level and duration of IFN-β expression."
https://openalex.org/W1987289975,"The SMRT and NCoR corepressors partner with, and help mediate repression by, a wide variety of nuclear receptors and non-receptor transcription factors. Both SMRT and NCoR are expressed by alternative mRNA splicing, resulting in the production of a series of interrelated corepressor variants that differ in their tissue distribution and in their biochemical properties. We report here that different corepressor splice variants can exert opposing transcriptional and biological effects during adipocyte differentiation. Most notably, the NCoRω splice variant inhibits, whereas the NCoRδ splice variant promotes, adipogenesis. Furthermore, the ratio of NCoRω to NCoRδ decreases during adipogenic differentiation. We propose that this alteration in corepressor splicing helps convert the cellular transcriptional program from one that maintains the pre-adipocyte in an undifferentiated state to a new transcriptional context that promotes differentiation and helps establish the proper physiology of the mature adipocyte."
https://openalex.org/W2018496442,"Oncogenic mutations of ras and B-raf frequently occur in many cancer types and are critical for cell transformation and tumorigenesis. Death receptor 5 (DR5) is a cell surface pro-apoptotic death receptor for tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand and has been targeted in cancer therapy. The current study has demonstrated induction of DR5 expression by the oncogenic proteins Ras and B-Raf and revealed the underlying mechanisms. We demonstrated that both Ras and B-Raf induce DR5 expression by enforced expression of oncogenic Ras (e.g. H-Ras12V or K-Ras12V) or B-Raf (i.e. V600E) in cells and by analyzing gene expression array data generated from cancer cell lines and from human cancer tissues. This finding is further supported by our results that knockdown of endogenous K-Ras or B-Raf (V600E) reduced the expression of DR5. Importantly, we have elucidated that Ras induces DR5 expression through co-activation of ERK/RSK and JNK signaling pathways and subsequent cooperative effects among the transcriptional factors CHOP, Elk1, and c-Jun to enhance DR5 gene transcription. Moreover, we found that the majority of cancer cell lines highly sensitive to the DR5 agonistic antibody AMG655 have either Ras or B-Raf mutations. Our findings warrant further study on the biology of DR5 regulation by Ras and B-Raf, which may provide new insight into the biology of Ras and B-Raf, and on the potential impact of Ras or B-Raf mutations on the outcome of DR5-targeted cancer therapy."
https://openalex.org/W2015251727,"Growth factors, insulin, oxidative stress, and cytokines activate ERK1/2 by PKCδ and MEK1/2. Human biliverdin reductase (hBVR), a Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase and intracellular scaffold/bridge/anchor, is a nuclear transporter of MEK1/2-stimulated ERK1/2 (Lerner-Marmarosh, N., Miralem, T., Gibbs, P. E., and Maines, M. D. (2008) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 105, 6870-6875). hBVR, PKCδ, and MEK1/2 overlap in their tissue expression profile and type of activators. Presently, we report on formation of an hBVR-PKCδ-ERK2 ternary complex that is essential for ERK2 signal transduction and activation of genes linked to cell proliferation and cancer. MEK1/2 and the protein phosphatase PP2A were also present in the complex. When cells were stimulated with insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), an increased interaction between hBVR and PKCδ was detected by FRET-fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. hBVR and ERK2 were phosphorylated by PKCδ; however, the PKC was not a substrate for either ERK2 or hBVR. IGF-1 and phorbol ester increased hBVR/PKCδ binding; hBVR was required for the activation of PKCδ and its interaction with ERK2. The C-terminal phenylalanine residues of PKCδ (Phe(660), Phe(663), and Phe(665)) were necessary for binding to ERK2 but not for hBVR binding. Formation of the hBVR-PKCδ-ERK2 complex required the hBVR docking site for ERK, FXFP (DEF, C-box) and D(δ)-box (ILXXLXL) motifs. The hBVR-based peptide KKRILHCLGLA inhibited PKC activation and PKCδ/ERK2 interaction. Phorbol ester- and TNF-α-dependent activation of the ERK-regulated transcription factors Elk1 and NF-κB and expression of the iNOS gene were suppressed by hBVR siRNA; those activities were rescued by hBVR. The findings reveal the direct input of hBVR in PKCδ/ERK signaling and identify hBVR-based peptide regulators of ERK-mediated gene activation."
https://openalex.org/W2038572774,"Members of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) family are activated by phosphorylation at a conserved threonine residue in the activation loop of the kinase domain. Mammalian AMPK adopts a phosphatase-resistant conformation that is stabilized by binding low energy adenylate molecules. Similarly, binding of ADP to the Snf1 complex, yeast AMPK, protects the kinase from dephosphorylation. Here, we determined the nucleotide specificity of the ligand-mediated protection from dephosphorylation and demonstrate the subunit and domain requirements for this reaction. Protection from dephosphorylation was highly specific for adenine nucleotides, with ADP being the most effective ligand for mediating protection. The full-length α subunit (Snf1) was not competent for ADP-mediated protection, confirming the requirement for the regulatory β and γ subunits. However, Snf1 heterotrimeric complexes that lacked either the glycogen-binding domain of Gal83 or the linker region of the α subunit were competent for ADP-mediated protection. In contrast, adenylate-mediated protection of recombinant human AMPK was abolished when a portion of the linker region containing the α-hook domain was deleted. Therefore, the exact means by which the different adenylate nucleotides are distinguished by the Snf1 enzyme may differ compared with its mammalian ortholog."

Here we report the crystal structures at 1.65-1.82 Å resolution of the catalytic domain of laminarinase from the thermophile Thermotoga maritima with various space groups in the ligand-free form or in the presence of inhibitors gluconolactone and cetyltrimethylammonium. Ligands were bound at the cleft of the active site near an enclosure formed by Trp-232 and a flexible GASIG loop. A closed configuration at the active site cleft was observed in some molecules. The loop flexibility in the enzyme may contribute to the regulation of endo- or exo-activity of the enzyme and a preference to release laminaritrioses in long chain carbohydrate hydrolysis. Glu-137 and Glu-132 are proposed to serve as the proton donor and nucleophile, respectively, in the retaining catalysis of hydrolyzation. Calcium ions in the crystallization media are found to accelerate crystal growth. Comparison of laminarinase and endoglucanase structures revealed the subtle difference of key residues in the active site for the selection of β-1,3-glucan and β-1,4-glucan substrates, respectively. Arg-85 may be pivotal to β-1,3-glucan substrate selection.

Similarly, BH3-only proteins interact with Bcl-2/Bcl-xL and induce conformational alterations (21Billen L.P. Kokoski C.L. Lovell J.F. Leber B. Andrews D.W.

Indeed, we have shown that Bcl-2 permeabilizes a model MOM after conformational alterations induced by truncated Bid (tBid) (23Peng J. Tan C. Roberts G.J. Nikolaeva O. Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Primorac S. Andrews D.W. Lin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35802-35811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). However, the Bcl-2 pore is too small to release cytochrome c because the tBid-activated Bcl-2 only forms small oligomers in the membrane unlike the tBid-activated Bax, which forms large oligomers (24Dlugosz P.J.

The small oligomeric Bcl-2 pore may function to maintain the normal permeability of the MOM as suggested previously (26Schlesinger P.H. Gross A. Yin X.M. Yamamoto K. Saito M. Waksman G.

In fact, we found that the conformation-altered Bcl-2 was able to inhibit the extensive oligomerization and large pore formation of Bax in both model and native mitochondrial membranes, thereby preventing apoptosis (23Peng J. Tan C. Roberts G.J. Nikolaeva O. Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Primorac S. Andrews D.W. Lin J. J. Biol.

Therefore, although interaction with tBid changes Bcl-2 to an active Bax-like conformation, it fails to convert Bcl-2 to a proapoptotic protein. On the other hand, conversion of Bcl-2 to a proapoptotic protein has been observed in other circumstances. Upon binding to Nur77 protein or peptide, Bcl-2 undergoes conformational changes that convert it to a proapoptotic molecule with an exposed BH3 motif that neutralizes Bcl-xL and initiates apoptosis in a Bax- or Bak-dependent manner (28Kolluri S.K. Zhu X. Zhou X. Lin B. Chen Y. Sun K. Tian X. Town J. Cao X. Lin F. Zhai D. Kitada S. Luciano F. O'Donnell E. Cao Y. He F. Lin J. Reed J.C. Satterthwait A.C. Zhang X.K.

We observed that treatment with gossypol triggered similar conformational changes in Bcl-2 that induced apoptosis in cells lacking both Bax and Bak, but the mechanism was unclear (30Lei X. Chen Y.

Bim is required for apoptosis of autoreactive thymocytes and neurons (31Bouillet P. Metcalf D. Huang D.C. Tarlinton D.M. Kay T.W. Köntgen F. Adams J.M. Strasser A. Science. 1999; 286: 1735-1738Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar). There are several isoforms of Bim, including BimEL, BimL, and BimS (32O'Connor L. Strasser A. O'Reilly L.A. Hausmann G. Adams J.M. Cory S. Huang D.C. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 384-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). BimS is more toxic than other Bim isoforms, may become active immediately after translation, and is subject to rapid protein turnover (33Weber A. Paschen S.A. Heger K. Wilfling F. Frankenberg T.

It has been established that Bim can induce apoptosis by engaging both anti- and proapoptotic family members at mitochondria; however, the consequence of these interactions is debatable (12Willis S.N.

Here we identified a diterpenoid derivative that dramatically up-regulated Bim expression and effectively induced cytochrome c release and caspase-dependent apoptosis in bax/bak double knock-out cells. Bim interacted with and embedded Bcl-2 in membranes. Unexpectedly, the Bcl-2 and Bim formed oligomers that permeabilized the membranes to release cytochrome c or molecules of equivalent size. Therefore, antiapoptotic Bcl-2 could be converted to a proapoptotic Bax-like molecule via interaction with Bim. E1A/K-Ras-transformed bax−/−/bak−/− mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and bim−/− and the wild type (WT) MEF cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS and antibiotics. Antibodies against the following proteins were used (catalog numbers and company names are listed in parentheses): β-actin (A5441) and Bim (B7929) (Sigma); Bcl-2 (610539), cytochrome c (556433), and Bcl-xL (556361) (BD Transduction Laboratories); Bid (2003), Mcl-1 (5453), cspase-9 (9504), cytochrome c oxidase subunit IV (COX IV) (4844), and VDAC (4661) (Cell Signaling Technology); BH3 motif of Bcl-2 (AP1303a) (Abgent); and Bad (sc942) and Bok (sc19302) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-labeled goat anti-mouse and anti-rabbit IgG antibodies from Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents and disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS) were from Thermo Scientific, MitoTracker Red CMXRos and bismaleimidohexane (BMH) were from Invitrogen, and Z-VAD-fmk was from BioMol. Other chemicals were purchased from Sigma unless otherwise specified. Externalization of phosphatidylserine or caspase activity in cells treated with 20 μm z-VAD-fmk and/or 10 μm S-3 (supplemental experimental procedures) was quantified by using an Annexin V apoptosis detection kit (Pharmingen) or the CaspACETM FITC-VAD-fmk kit (Promega), respectively, and flow cytometry according to the manufacturers' instructions. Flow cytometry data were obtained with FACScan and analyzed with CellQuest software (BD Biosciences). Cells grown on glass coverslips were treated with 10 μm S-3 and stained with 50 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos for 15 min at 37 °C. After fixation in 3.7% formaldehyde, the cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100. Cytochrome c- or Bim-specific antibody was added to the cells followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h. FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibody was then added to the cells followed by incubation at room temperature for 1 h. Fluorescence from MitoTracker Red and FITC in the cells was then measured by confocal microscopy using a Zeiss LSM 510 META microscope. Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (37Chen Q. Gong B. Almasan A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were treated with 20 μm z-VAD-fmk and/or 10 μm S-3 and lysed in buffer A (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.25% sodium deoxycholate, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, 50 μg/ml trypsin inhibitor, 1 mm PMSF, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, and 10 μg/ml pepstatin). Proteins from the cell lysate were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked with milk and then probed with the indicated antibodies overnight at 4 °C. The resulting immunocomplexes were detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody and ECL. To determine subcellular localization of the proteins, cells were fractionated as described previously (30Lei X. Chen Y. Du G. Yu W. Wang X. Qu H. Xia B. He H. Mao J. Zong W. Liao X. Mehrpour M. Hao X. Chen Q. FASEB J. 2006; 20: 2147-2149Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 37Chen Q. Gong B. Almasan A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). The cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were subjected to immunoblotting as described above. To detect the Bim/Bcl-2 interaction, cells were lysed in buffer A. 500 μl of lysate containing 500 μg of total protein were incubated with 2 μg of Bcl-2- or Bim-specific antibody overnight at 4 °C. Immunocomplexes in the resulting sample were collected after incubation with 20 μl of protein A-coupled agarose for 2 h at 4 °C, washed with buffer A, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with Bim- or Bcl-2-specific antibody, respectively. The DNA sequence for mouse Bim shRNA (TGATGTAAGTTCTGAGTGTG), Bcl-2 shRNA (GATCGTGATGAAGTACATA), Bad shRNA (TGGGATCGAAACTTGGGCAAA), or a scrambled shRNA was inserted between BamHI and HindIII sites of the pSilencer 2.1-CMV Hygro vector. The resulting plasmids (1.5 μg) were individually transfected into the bax−/−/bak−/− MEF cells using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Transfectants were selected in a culture medium containing 100 μg/ml hygromycin. The cDNA sequence for mouse BimEL, BimL, or BimS was inserted into the pcDNA4TO vector. The resulting plasmids or the vector (1.5 μg) was transfected into the bax−/−/bak−/−/Bim knockdown MEF cells using Lipofectamine 2000. The bax−/−/bak−/− MEF cells (5 × 105) were injected into the backs of 4–5-week-old nude BALB/c mice. The mice were separated into two groups (10 mice/group). Seven days after injection, one group was treated with one dose of S-3 (30 mg/kg), and the other group was treated with vehicle control (50% (v/v) propylene glycol in 1.8% NaCl) every 3 days for 3 weeks. Both groups of mice were sacrificed at the end of treatment, and tumors were excised. Tumor length (a) and width (b) were measured by using a slide gauge to determine the tumor volumes (V) according to the following formula: V = a × b2/2. Apoptotic cells in the tumors were visualized under fluorescence microscopy after terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL) using the In Situ Cell Death Detection kit (Roche Applied Science) according to the manufacturer's instructions. More than 2,000 cells in each of the four sections from three separate tumors were analyzed to determine the mean percentage of TUNEL-positive cells. Mice were maintained in specific pathogen-free conditions, and all studies were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The bax−/−/bak−/− MEF cells were treated with 10 μm S-3 and stained with antibody against the BH3 motif of Bcl-2 and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody followed by flow cytometry analysis as described above. Preparation of liposomes with the MOM characteristic lipids and a Ni2+-chelating lipid analog in the membrane and 10-kDa fluorescent dextran in the lumen and detection of the dextran release from the liposomes by purified Bcl-2 family proteins using fluorescence quenching were as described before (23Peng J. Tan C. Roberts G.J. Nikolaeva O. Zhang Z. Lapolla S.M. Primorac S. Andrews D.W. Lin J. J. Biol. Chem. 2006; 281: 35802-35811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar). Purified 500 nm BimS and 500 nm Bcl-2 or Bcl-2-G145A proteins (supplemental experimental procedures) were incubated with 125 μm liposomes at 37 °C for 3 h followed by gel filtration through a Sepharose CL-2B column to separate the resulting membrane-bound proteins from the soluble proteins. The membrane-bound proteins were cross-linked by 0.1 mm BMH or 0.5 mm DSS for 30 or 60 min, respectively, at room temperature, and then the reaction was quenched by 40 mm β-mercaptoethanol or 30 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), respectively, at room temperature for 15 min. For the “−BMH, −DSS” control, both quenchers were added prior to the cross-linking agents. The proteins in the reactions were precipitated with Cl3CCOOH and analyzed by reducing SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting with Bcl-2-specific antibody to detect Bcl-2. BimS was then detected by immunoblotting with Bim-specific antibody after stripping the Bcl-2 immunoblot. To detect the interaction between Bcl-2 and Bim proteins in the S-3-treated bax−/−/bak−/− MEF cells, the cells were washed and then suspended in a buffer containing 150 mm NaCl, 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.2), 1.5 mm MgCl2, and 10 mm glucose. DSS dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was added to one aliquot of the cell suspension to bring the final concentration to 2 mm. The same volume of DMSO was added to other aliquot. After incubating at room temperature for 30 min, the cross-linking reaction was quenched by 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) at room temperature for 15 min. The cells were then solubilized in 1% Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (150 mm NaCl, 25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Applied Science), and 1 mm PMSF) and centrifuged at 12,000 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant samples were processed and analyzed by immunoblotting with Bcl-2- or Bim-specific antibody as described above. Purified 50 nm Bcl-2 or Bcl-2-G145A proteins were incubated with 12.5 μm liposomes in the absence or presence of 50 nm BimS or BimSΔΔ or 100 nm Bid as described above followed by an additional incubation at room temperature for 10 min with or without 10 mm EDTA. The membrane-bound proteins were separated from the soluble and aggregated proteins by a sucrose gradient float-up centrifugation as described before (23Peng J. Tan C. Roberts G.J. Nikolaeva O.

Chem. 2006; 281: 35802-35811Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (42) Google Scholar) except that the top 0.3 ml of the gradient was used as the membrane fraction. The Bcl-2 proteins in this fraction were processed and analyzed as described above. Purified 150 nm BimS proteins were incubated with 37.5 μm liposomes in the absence or presence of 150 nm purified Bcl-2 proteins as described above. The membrane-bound proteins were isolated by the CL-2B gel filtration chromatography described above and then solubilized by 2% 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (CHAPS), a detergent that does not dissociate complexes formed by Bcl-2 family proteins in membranes (38Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (445) Google Scholar). The resulting solution was subjected to Superdex 200 gel filtration chromatography as described (39Zhang Z. Zhu W. Lapolla S.M. Miao Y. Shao Y. Falcone M. Boreham D. McFarlane N. Ding J. Johnson A.E.

The Bcl-2 and/or BimS proteins in the eluted fractions were processed and analyzed as described above for the cross-linking experiments. To explore Bax/Bak-independent cell death mechanisms, we screened over 300 natural compounds and derivatives for the capacity to kill E1A/K-Ras-transformed embryonic fibroblasts from bax/bak double knock-out mice (bax−/−/bak−/− cells) (40Zong W.X. Lindsten T. Ross A.J. MacGregor G.R. Thompson C.B. Genes Dev. 2001; 15: 1481-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (715) Google Scholar). Results from a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that several compounds significantly reduced the cell viability (supplemental Fig. S1A). One of these compounds, a Spiraea diterpenoid derivative, 15-oxospiramilactone (named S-3 hereafter, prepared as described in supplemental experimental procedures), was of particular interest because it induced nuclear condensation and fragmentation in bax−/−/bak−/− cells in a time-dependent manner (supplemental Fig. S1B). To further characterize the death process induced by S-3 in bax−/−/bak−/− cells, we used Annexin V (AV) staining to measure the exposure of phosphatidylserine on the cell surface, a hallmark of apoptosis. S-3 treatment time-dependently increased the AV-positive population of bax−/−/bak−/− cells (Fig. 1A) to an extent comparable with E1A/K-Ras-transformed WT mouse embryonic fibroblasts treated with S-3 (supplemental Fig. S1C). We also used a FITC-conjugated caspase marker to detect caspase activity, another defining characteristic for apoptosis, in individual cells. S-3-induced caspase activation occurred in a time course parallel to phosphatidylserine exposure (Fig. 1B). Moreover, z-VAD-fmk, a pan-caspase inhibitor, potently blocked the phosphatidylserine exposure and caspase activation (Fig. 1, A and B). To understand how S-3 activates caspases and induces apoptosis in the absence of Bax and Bak, we analyzed cytochrome c release from mitochondria in bax−/−/bak−/− cells treated with S-3. Cytochrome c appeared in the cytosolic fraction after 12-h exposure of the cells to S-3 (Fig. 1C). The amount of cytochrome c increased in the cytosolic fraction as the treatment time lengthened and was accompanied by a decrease of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial fraction. Immunostaining of the cells with a cytochrome c-specific antibody revealed a diffuse staining in S-3-treated cells compared with a punctate staining in untreated cells (Fig. 1D), which together with the fractionation data indicate the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the cytosol. Twelve hours after cytochrome c release was detected, procaspase-9 was cleaved as indicated by reduction of procaspase-9 in the cells; this could be blocked by z-VAD-fmk (supplemental Fig. S1D). Because z-VAD-fmk also blocked S-3-induced cytochrome c release at late time points (supplemental Fig. S1E), caspase-9 (supplemental Fig. S1D) and possibly other caspases that were activated by the initial cytochrome c release likely promoted more cytochrome c release through a feedback loop as observed previously (37Chen Q. Gong B. Almasan A. Cell Death Differ. 2000; 7: 227-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar, 41Harvey N.L. Butt A.J. Kumar S. J. Biol.

These data clearly demonstrate that S-3-treated bax−/−/bak−/− cells can undergo apoptosis with typical morphological and biochemical hallmarks. S-3 thus offers a new tool for investigating mechanisms of Bax/Bak-independent apoptosis. Despite the absence of Bax and Bak, other Bcl-2 family members may still play a key role in regulating apoptosis. We thus used immunoblotting to analyze the level of other Bcl-2 family proteins in S-3-treated bax−/−/bak−/− cells. Expression of antiapoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL was not significantly changed up to 48 h after S-3 treatment, and Mcl-1 was increased initially and then decreased to a level similar to that in the untreated cells (Fig. 2A). Proapoptotic multi-BH protein Bok was not detectable until 36 h after S-3 treatment (supplemental Fig. S2A). Expression of BH3-only proteins Bid and Bad was elevated initially and then dropped to a level comparable with or lower than that in t"

However, how can one separate between the increase in putative second messengers, change in pH, and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) depletion when exploring the TRPL gating mechanism? To answer this question we co-expressed the TRPL channels together with the muscarinic (M1) receptor, enabling the openings of TRPL channels via G-protein activation of PLC. To dissect PLC activation of TRPL into its molecular components, we used a powerful method that reduced plasma membrane-associated PI(4,5)P2 in HEK cells within seconds without activating PLC. Upon the addition of a dimerizing drug, PI(4,5)P2 was selectively hydrolyzed in the cell membrane without producing DAG, inositol trisphosphate, or calcium signals. We show that PI(4,5)P2 is not an inhibitor of TRPL channel activation. PI(4,5)P2 hydrolysis combined with either acidification or application of DAG analogs failed to activate the channels, whereas PUFA did activate the channels. Moreover, a reduction in PI(4,5)P2 levels or inhibition of DAG lipase during PLC activity suppressed the PLC-activated TRPL current. This suggests that PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial substrate for PLC-mediated activation of the channels, whereas PUFA may function as the channel activator.

On the other hand, the expression of the channels in HEK cells results in channels that are in their closed state (14Hambrecht J. Zimmer S. Flockerzi V. Cavalié A.

This is a point that might be important for understanding channel activation. Activation of PLC is crucial for the opening of the TRP and TRPL channels under physiological conditions (7Devary O.

Because PLC activation results in both reduction of PI(4,5)P2 levels and the production of DAG and inositol trisphosphate (IP3), it is not yet clear which of these events is key to TRPL channel gating. The gating can be explained by several possible mechanisms: 1) a reduction of PI(4,5)P2 level in a process of disinhibition with or without the synergistic effect of second messenger production (i.e. IP3 or DAG); 2) an action of a PLC-hydrolyzing product as a second messenger (i.e. IP3 or DAG); 3) an action of a DAG hydrolyzing product as a second messenger (i.e. PUFA (12Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar); 4) a reduction of PI(4,5)P2 levels combined with a pH diminution (19Huang J. Liu C.H. Hughes S.A. Postma M. Schwiening C.J. Hardie R.C. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 189-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar); 5) a change in lipid packing at the plasma membrane (PM) due to conversion of PI(4,5)P2, with a large hydrophilic head group, into DAG, with a small hydrophilic head group (18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2371-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar, 20Katz B. Minke B. Front. Cell Neurosci. 2009; 3: 2Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar). The possible gating mechanisms that involve PI(4,5)P2 have been extensively investigated both in the native and heterologous expression systems. An early study performed in Drosophila photoreceptors has shown that PI(4,5)P2 serves as a substrate for the activation process (21Wu L. Niemeyer B. Colley N. Socolich M. Zuker C.S. Nature. 1995; 373: 216-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Two studies have suggested that PI(4,5)P2 functions as an inhibitor of the TRPL channel in heterologous expression systems. These studies showed that PI(4,5)P2 sequestration by exogenous polylysine or PI(4,5)P2 addition enhanced or suppressed the activity of constitutively active TRPL channels, respectively (10Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2371-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results contradict recent data showing that PI(4,5)P2 addition to excised patches of S2 cells expressing TRPL facilitated channel activity. This same study further showed that PI(4,5)P2 reduction together with intracellular acidification led to robust opening of the channels in the native system (19Huang J. Liu C.H. Hughes S.A. Postma M. Schwiening C.J. Hardie R.C. Curr. Biol. 2010; 20: 189-197Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Collectively, these results indicate a crucial role for PI(4,5)P2 in TRPL gating, although the underlying mechanism is not clear (i.e. activation or inhibition). Previous studies have indicated that IP3 or the IP3 receptor and thus Ca2+ mobilization are not involved in the gating mechanism of TRPL (22Acharya J.K. Jalink K. Hardy R.W. Hartenstein V. Zuker C.S. Neuron. 1997; 18: 881-887Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar, 23Hardie R.C. Raghu P.

Neurosci. 2000; 15: 429-445Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). This conclusion was supported by intracellular photo-release of caged Ca2+ (25Hardie R.C. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 889-902Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Manipulation of cellular Ca2+ in S2 cells expressing TRPL showed that Ca2+ inhibits rather than activates TRPL by a divalent open channel block mechanism (13Parnas M. Katz B. Minke B. J. Gen. Physiol. 2007; 129: 17-28Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Several studies have shown that DAG analogues can activate the TRPL channel (10Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J.

Others have shown that DAG derivatives (i.e. PUFA) open (in photoreceptor cells) or enhance activity of constitutively active TRPL channels (in expression systems) (12Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2371-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). It is still unclear what exact role these agents have in the gating mechanism of the TRPL channel. Furthermore, some of the proposed gating mechanisms highlight different downstream effects of PLC activation. However, the physiological relevance of these results remains elusive. Because TRPL shares many common features with other members of the TRP channel superfamily, advancing the understanding of TRPL gating has an important impact on understanding the gating mechanism and functional properties of other TRP channels as well. In this study we explored the gating mechanism of the TRPL channel using a recently established technique that has not been previously used to investigate this specific issue. To this end we set up a TRPL expression system in which we could readily induce channel opening via PLC activation together with accurate monitoring of its hydrolyzing activity. PLC hydrolyzing activity was monitored via the reduction of PI(4,5)P2 and the resulting increase in DAG levels using translocation of GFP-tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain (see “Experimental Procedures”). Furthermore, we used enzymatic and pharmacological tools that enabled changing the content of specific phospholipids with or without PLC activation in a spatial and temporal-controlled manner. These powerful techniques enabled dissecting the process resulting from PLC activation into its separate components without PLC activation. Using these techniques, we reconstituted a TRPL activation system in mammalian HEK cells whereby activation of PLC by co-expressed Muscarinic 1 (M1) receptor led to the opening of the TRPL channel. We showed that PI(4,5)P2 is not an inhibitor of channel activation regardless of whether its hydrolysis was combined with the addition of DAG analogues or whether PI(4,5)P2 reduction was induced under extra or intracellular acidic conditions. In addition, we demonstrated that PI(4,5)P2 is a crucial substrate for PLC-induced activation of the TRPL channel and showed that DAG analogues do not activate the channel directly, whereas linoleic acid (LA, a specific PUFA), a derivative of DAG, does. Together, the data define a narrow range of possible mechanisms for TRPL gating. The results exclude several proposed gating mechanisms and reinforce others, especially those involving PI(4,5)P2. The Drosophila TRPL construct used for experiments in HEK cells was kindly provided by Neil S. Millar (Dept. of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College, London). The prmha3-TRPL plasmid provided was utilized for subcloning into Clontech C1 mammalian expression vector and used thereafter for all experiments. The mouse muscarinic receptor fused to cyan fluorescent protein at its C terminus was the kind gift of Neil M. Nathanson (Dept. of Pharmacology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA). The green fluorescent protein (GFP) pleckstrin homology fusion protein expression vector and TRPM8 mammalian expression vector were kindly provided by Sharona E. Gordon (Dept. of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington). All vectors used in the rapamycin system (Lyn11-FRB and cyan fluorescent protein-FKBP (FK506-binding protein)-Inp54p) were kindly provided by Tobias Meyer (Dept. of Molecular Pharmacology, Stanford University). HEK cells were grown at 37 °C with 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% pen-strep (Biological Industries). Transfections were performed with the TransIt (Mirus) transfections reagent, with equal amounts of cDNA, according to the manufacturer's instructions and protocol. HEK cells were seeded on polylysine coated coverslips at a confluence of 25%. 24–48 h before the experiment, cells were transfected to induce expression of the appropriate proteins. Single channel and whole-cell currents were recorded at room temperature using borosilicate patch pipettes of 3–5 megaohms and an Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices) voltage-clamp amplifier. Voltage-clamp pulses were generated, and data were captured using a Digidata 1440A interfaced to a computer running the pClamp 10 software (Molecular Devices). Currents were filtered using 8-pole low pass Bessel filter at 5 kHz and sampled at 50 kHz. Series resistance compensation was performed <80% for currents above 1000 pA. The extracellular Tyrode solution was prepared as a Ca2+ nominal-based solution to which either 0.5 mm EGTA or 1.5 mm CaCl2 were added. In several experiments GdCl3 was added to nominal-based extracellular solution. The extracellular solution contained 145 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 15 mm HEPES, 10 mm glucose and titrated to pH 7.4. The intracellular pipette solution contained 130 mm CsCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 10 mm EGTA, 10 mm HEPES, 2 mm Na2ATP, 4.1 mm CaCl2 and titrated to pH 7.2. The experiments performed in Fig. 5 used extracellular acidic solution as indicated whereby the acidic pH was buffered using MES instead of HEPES, and all other ingredients were as mentioned above. All cells were perfused via BPS-4 valve control system (Scientific Instruments) at a rate of ∼30 chamber volumes/min. Menthol and capsaicin were purchased from Sigma. 1,2-Oleoylacetylglycerol (OAG), 1-stearoyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycerol (SAG), rapamycin, LA, and carbachol (CCH) were purchased from Calbiochem. Images of HEK cells expressing fluorescent proteins were acquired in a confocal microscope (Olympus Fluoview 300 IX70) using an Olympus UplanF1 60×/0.9 water objective. The cells were excited with an argon/krypton laser at 488 nm. Data were analyzed and plotted using pClamp 10 (Molecular Devices) and Sigma Plot 8.02 (Systat software) software. Confocal images were imported as tiff single images into Photoshop (Adobe Systems Inc.), where they were subsequently cropped and resized. The K-4500 competitive ELISA kit (Echelon) was used according to the manufacturer's protocol. Absolute PI(4,5)P2 concentrations were calculated using the standard curve for which the change in PI(4,5)P2 levels was displayed. Student's paired t test was used for statistical analysis. All error bars are S.E. The HEK expression system was used to study TRPL gating because the channels are in their closed state and can be opened upon application of external signals. This property is reminiscence of TRPL channels in photoreceptor cells, which are closed in the dark (15Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 27Hardie R.C. Mojet M.H. J. Neurophysiol. 1995; 74: 2590-2599Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar, 28Lev S. Minke B. Methods Enzymol. 2010; 484: 591-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). The closed state of the channels made it possible to recapitulate the enzymatic cascade leading to Drosophila TRPL channel activation in a similar manner to the native system. HEK cells have been shown to allow for robust activation of mammalian TRP channels downstream of expressed M1 receptor, which utilizes endogenous Gq and PLC (29Runnels L.W. Yue L. Clapham D.E. Nat. Cell Biol. 2002; 4: 329-336Crossref PubMed Scopus (456) Google Scholar). An additional advantage of this system is the negligible endogenous currents (15Xu X.Z. Li H.S. Guggino W.B. Montell C. Cell. 1997; 89: 1155-1164Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (280) Google Scholar, 28Lev S. Minke B. Methods Enzymol. 2010; 484: 591-612Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). Importantly, using this system allowed careful monitoring of the relative amount and dynamic changes in phospholipid content. This was performed in an array of pharmacological and enzymatic assays designed to dissect the PLC-TRPL cascade into incremental steps. Fig. 1 shows that application of CCH (the M1 agonist) resulted in activation of the TRPL channel via endogenous Gq-activated PLC in a relatively fast and robust manner. PLC activity was monitored using translocation of a GFP-tagged PH domain (30Balla T. Varnai P. Sci. STKE 2002. 2002; : l3Google Scholar, 31Suh B.C. Inoue T. Meyer T. Hille B. Science. 2006; 314: 1454-1457Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). This technique is based on the specific binding of the GFP-PH probe to PI(4,5)P2 at the plasma membrane. Hydrolysis of PI(4,5)P2 resulted in the translocation of the GFP-PH probe to the cytosol. Fig. 1, A and B, shows the reversible enhanced translocation of GFP-PH to the cytosol in the presence of physiological Ca2+ concentrations upon CCH application. This demonstrates that the expressed M1 can activate endogenous PLC in the HEK cell expression system. Importantly, we showed that co-expression of M1 and TRPL resulted in TRPL channel opening from a closed state upon CCH application (Fig. 1C, n = 9). The channel could be further blocked by application of Gd3+ (Fig. 1C, right I-V curve in red). The activity of the TRPL channel observed, in terms of waveform and reversal potential, is comparable with that seen for the channel in the native photoreceptor cells (18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2371-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) as well as other expression systems (14Hambrecht J. Zimmer S. Flockerzi V. Cavalié A. Pflugers Arch. 2000; 440: 418-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This is the first demonstration of a mammalian expression system that reconstitutes the phosphoinositide cascade which activates TRPL via a G-protein-coupled receptor, a Gq protein, and PLC. To further substantiate the competence of the HEK cell expression system to recapitulate results obtained for TRPL in other expression systems, including the native system, we explored the effect of PUFA on the channel. Several reports have implicated PUFA as a possible activator of the channel both in the native system (12Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2371-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in several expression systems (10Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2371-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). Fig. 2 demonstrates that LA (i.e. a PUFA) activated the TRPL channel both in the whole cell configuration (Fig. 2A, n = 10) and in the cell-attached mode (Fig. 2, C and D, n = 6), showing single channel activity. In both configurations, a Ca2+ open channel block results in outward rectification. However, a significant inward current can be observed at physiologically relevant potentials when LA is applied (Fig. 2B, see also Figs. 4C and 5, A and B) as observed also by others (12Chyb S. Raghu P. Hardie R.C. Nature. 1999; 397: 255-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (361) Google Scholar, 18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2371-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar). These results demonstrate that the HEK expression system effectively reproduces PUFA-based activation of the TRPL channel.FIGURE 4PI(4,5)P2 depletion and its effect on TRPL and TRPM8 channel activity.

Our results (see Fig. 6, see below) showed that direct application of OAG, a DAG analog, did not lead to channel opening (Fig. 6A). This result is consistent with studies in the native photoreceptor cell (3Hardie R.C. J. Physiol. 2007; 578: 9-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), but not with other reports, for reasons which we do not fully comprehend. To further investigate this issue, we applied SAG, a more typical DAG analog. Application of SAG to either inside-out patches or in the whole cell configuration did not lead to opening of the TRPL channel. As a positive control we used LA, which readily activated the TRPL channel (Fig. 3, A and B, n = 4). To demonstrate that SAG application was effective, we applied SAG to expressed and constitutively open TRPV1 channels. We observed a robust and reversible facilitation under the same conditions (Fig. 3C, n = 4) as previously reported (33Woo D.H. Jung S.J. Zhu M.H. Park C.K. Kim Y.H. Oh S.B. Lee C.J. Mol. Pain. 2008; 4: 42Crossref PubMed Scopus (91) Google Scholar). Based on these results and on results obtained for TRPL in S2 (18Parnas M. Katz B. Lev S. Tzarfaty V. Dadon D. Gordon-Shaag A. Metzner H. Yaka R. Minke B. J. Neurosci. 2009; 29: 2371-2383Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) and in the Sf9 cell expression systems (10Estacion M. Sinkins W.G. Schilling W.P. J. Physiol. 2001; 530: 1-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar), we explored the possibility that the SAG effect on the TRPV1 channel represents enhanced activity of various TRP channels, which are already in their open state. To this end, we applied SAG to constitutively open TRPM8 channels, expressed in HEK cells, and found no effect (Fig. 3D, n = 4). However, menthol did facilitate further channel opening in a robust and reversible manner, as previously described (34Peier A.M. Moqrich A. Hergarden A.C. Reeve A.J. Andersson D.A. Story G.M. Ea"
https://openalex.org/W2094414190,"The Gβγ subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins transmit signals to control many cellular processes, including leukocyte migration. Gβγ signaling may regulate and be regulated by numerous signaling partners. Here, we reveal that WDR26, a member of the WD40 repeat protein family, directly bound free Gβγ in vitro, and formed a complex with endogenous Gβγ in Jurkat T cells stimulated by the chemokine SDF1α. Suppression of WDR26 by siRNAs selectively inhibited Gβγ-dependent phospholipase Cβ and PI3K activation, and attenuated chemotaxis in Jurkat T cells and differentiated HL60 cells in vitro and Jurkat T cell homing to lymphoid tissues in scid mice. Similarly, disruption of the WDR26/Gβγ interaction via expression of a WDR26 deletion mutant impaired Gβγ signaling and Jurkat T cell migration, indicating that the function of WDR26 depends on its binding to Gβγ. Additional data show that WDR26 also controlled RACK1, a negative regulator, in binding Gβγ and inhibiting leukocyte migration. Collectively, these experiments identify WDR26 as a novel Gβγ-binding protein that is required for the efficacy of Gβγ signaling and leukocyte migration."
https://openalex.org/W2071292762,"In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, mRNA transcripts with premature termination codons are targeted for deadenylation independent decapping and 5′ to 3′ decay in a quality control pathway termed nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Critical factors in NMD include Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3, as well as the decapping enzyme, Dcp2/Dcp1. Loss of Upf2 or Upf3 leads to the accumulation of not only Upf1 and Dcp2 in P-bodies, but also of the decapping-activators Pat1, Dhh1, and Lsm1. An interaction between Upf1 and Dcp2 has been identified, which might recruit Dcp2 to the NMD decapping complex. To determine the nature and significance of the Dcp2-Upf1 interaction, we utilized the yeast two-hybrid assay to assess Upf1 interactions with various mRNA decapping factors. We find that although Dcp2 can interact with Upf1, this interaction is indirect and is largely dependent on the Edc3 protein, which interacts with the N-terminal domain of Upf1 at an overlapping, but not identical, site as Upf2. We also found that Pat1 has an independent two-hybrid interaction with the N-terminus of Upf1. Assessment of both reporter and endogenous NMD transcripts suggest that the decapping stimulators, including Edc3 and Pat1, as well as Edc1 and Edc2, are not essential for NMD under normal conditions. This work defines a larger decapping complex involved in NMD, but indicates that components of that complex are not required for general NMD and might either regulate a subset of NMD transcripts or be essential for proper NMD under different environmental conditions."
https://openalex.org/W2002366558,"PAS kinase (PASK) is a glucose-regulated protein kinase involved in the control of pancreatic islet hormone release and insulin sensitivity. We aimed here to identify mutations in the PASK gene that may be associated with young-onset diabetes in humans. We screened 18 diabetic probands with unelucidated maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). We identified two rare nonsynonymous mutations in the PASK gene (p.L1051V and p.G1117E), each of which was found in a single MODY family. Wild type or mutant PASKs were expressed in HEK 293 cells. Kinase activity of the affinity-purified proteins was assayed as autophosphorylation at amino acid Thr307 or against an Ugp1p-derived peptide. Whereas the PASK p.G1117E mutant displayed a ∼25% increase with respect to wild type PASK in the extent of autophosphorylation, and a ∼2-fold increase in kinase activity toward exogenous substrates, the activity of the p.L1051V mutant was unchanged. Amino acid Gly1117 is located in an α helical region opposing the active site of PASK and may elicit either: (a) a conformational change that increases catalytic efficiency or (b) a diminished inhibitory interaction with the PAS domain. Mouse islets were therefore infected with adenoviruses expressing wild type or mutant PASK and the regulation of insulin secretion was examined. PASK p.G1117E-infected islets displayed a 4-fold decrease in glucose-stimulated (16.7 versus 3 mM) insulin secretion, chiefly reflecting a 4.5-fold increase in insulin release at low glucose. In summary, we have characterized a rare mutation (p.G1117E) in the PASK gene from a young-onset diabetes family, which modulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion."
https://openalex.org/W2012531712,"In perfused rat liver, hyperosmolarity induces Mrp2- (Kubitz, R., D'urso, D., Keppler, D., and Häussinger, D. (1997) Gastroenterology 113, 1438-1442) and Bsep retrieval (Schmitt, M., Kubitz, R., Lizun, S., Wettstein, M., and Häussinger, D. (2001) Hepatology 33, 509-518) from the canalicular membrane leading to cholestasis. The aim of this study was to elucidate the underlying signaling events. Hyperosmolarity-induced retrieval of Mrp2 and Bsep from the canalicular membrane in perfused rat liver was accompanied by an activating phosphorylation of the Src kinases Fyn and Yes but not of c-Src. Both hyperosmotic transporter retrieval and Src kinase activation were sensitive to apocynin (300 μmol/liter), N-acetylcysteine (NAC; 10 mmol/liter), and SU6656 (1 μmol/liter). Also PP-2 (250 nmol/liter), which inhibited hyperosmotic Fyn but not Yes activation, prevented hyperosmotic transporter retrieval from the canalicular membrane, suggesting that Fyn but not Yes mediates hyperosmotic Bsep and Mrp2 retrieval. Neither hyperosmotic Fyn activation nor Bsep/Mrp2 retrieval was observed in livers from p47(phox) knock-out mice. Hyperosmotic activation of JNKs was sensitive to apocynin and NAC but insensitive to SU6656 and PP-2, indicating that JNKs are not involved in transporter retrieval, as also evidenced by experiments using the JNK inhibitors L-JNKI-1 and SP6001255, respectively. Hyperosmotic transporter retrieval was accompanied by a NAC and Fyn knockdown-sensitive inhibition of biliary excretion of the glutathione conjugate of 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene in perfused rat liver and of cholyl-L-lysyl-fluorescein secretion into the pseudocanaliculi formed by hepatocyte couplets. Hyperosmolarity triggered an association between Fyn and cortactin and increased the amount of phosphorylated cortactin underneath the canalicular membrane. It is concluded that the hyperosmotic cholestasis is triggered by a NADPH oxidase-driven reactive oxygen species formation that mediates Fyn-dependent retrieval of the Mrp2 and Bsep from the canalicular membrane, which may involve an increased cortactin phosphorylation."
https://openalex.org/W2028915734,"The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is considered the major virulent factor in Brucella spp. Several genes have been identified involved in the synthesis of the three LPS components: lipid A, core and O-PS. Usually, Brucella strains devoid of O-PS (rough mutants) are less virulent than the wild type and do not induce undesirable interfering antibodies. Such of them proved to be protective against brucellosis in mice. Because of these favorable features, rough strains have been considered potential brucellosis vaccines. In this study, we evaluated the antigenic, immunologic and genetic characteristics of rough strains B. abortus RB51, B. melitensis B115 and B. melitensis B18. RB51 derived from B. abortus 2308 virulent strain and B115 is a natural rough strain in which the O-PS is present in the cytoplasm. B18 is a rough rifampin-resistan mutant isolated in our laboratory. The surface antigenicity of RB51, B115 and B18 was evaluated by testing their ability to bind antibodies induced by rough or smooth Brucella strains. The antibody response induced by each strain was evaluated in rabbits. Twenty-one genes, involved in the LPS-synthesis, were sequenced and compared with the B. melitensis 16M strain. The results indicated that RB51, B115 and B18 have differences in antigenicity, immunologic and genetic properties. Particularly, in B115 a nonsense mutation was detected in wzm gene, which could explain the intracellular localization of O-PS in this strain. Complementation studies to evaluate the precise role of each mutation in affecting Brucella morphology and its virulence, could provide useful information for the assessment of new, attenuated vaccines for brucellosis."
https://openalex.org/W2071592357,"In recent decades, evidence has confirmed the crucial role of albumin in the progression of renal disease. However, the possible role of signaling pathways triggered by physiologic concentrations of albumin in the modulation of proximal tubule (PT) sodium reabsorption has not been considered. In the present work, we have shown that a physiologic concentration of albumin increases the expression of the α1 subunit of (Na(+) + K(+))-ATPase in LLC-PK1 cells leading to an increase in enzyme activity. This process involves the sequential activation of PI3K/protein kinase B and protein kinase C pathways promoting inhibition of protein kinase A. This integrative network is inhibited when albumin concentration is increased, similar to renal disease, leading to a decrease in the α1 subunit of (Na(+) + K(+))-ATPase expression. Together, the results indicate that variation in albumin concentration in PT cells has an important effect on PT sodium reabsorption and, consequently, on renal sodium excretion."
https://openalex.org/W2025426180,"The plotopterids (Aves, Plotopteridae) were a group of extinct wing-propelled marine birds that are known from Paleogene-aged sediments (Eocene to Miocene), mostly around the Pacific Rim (especially Japan and the northwest coast of North America). While these birds exhibit a strikingly similar wing morphology to penguins (Spheniscidae), they also share derived characters with pelecaniform birds that are absent in penguins and exhibit apparently superficial similarities with auks (Alcidae: Charadriiformes). Despite quite an abundant fossil record, these birds have been little studied, and in particular their functional morphology remains little understood. Here we present osteological overviews of specimens from the northwest coast of Washington state (USA). We give an amended diagnosis for the well-represented North American genus, Tonsala Olson, 1980, describe a new large species, and examine the functional morphology of plotopterids showing that the ratio of humeral strength to femoral strength is quite low in one well-represented species Tonsala buchanani sp.nov., relative to both extant penguins and alcids. While the femoral strength of Tonsala buchanani is ‘penguin-grade’, its humeral strength is more ‘alcid-grade’. These results have implications for understanding the mode-of-locomotion of these extinct marine birds. Although not related to Spheniscidae, our descriptions and functional results suggest that Tonsala buchanani sustained similar loads in walking, but slightly lower humeral loads during swimming, than a modern penguin. This suggests a swimming mode that is more similar to living alcids, than to the highly-specialised locomotor strategy of living and fossil penguins."
https://openalex.org/W2041108258,"The caspase recruitment domain (CARD) is present in a large number of proteins. Initially, the CARD was recognized as part of the caspase activation machinery. CARD-CARD interactions play a role in apoptosis and are responsible for the Apaf-1-mediated activation of procaspase-9 in the apoptosome. CARD-containing proteins mediate the inflammasome-dependent activation of proinflammatory caspase-1. More recently, new roles for CARD-containing proteins have been reported in signaling pathways associated with immune responses. The functional role of CARD-containing proteins and CARDs in coordinating apoptosis and inflammatory and immune responses is not completely understood. We have explored the putative cross-talk between apoptosis and inflammation by analyzing the modulatory activity on both the Apaf-1/procaspase-9 interaction and the inflammasome-mediated procaspase-1 activation of CARD-derived polypeptides. To this end, we analyzed the activity of individual recombinant CARDs, rationally designed CARD-derived peptides, and peptides derived from phage display."
https://openalex.org/W2134638093,"Members of the subfamily Galleriinae have adapted to different selective environmental pressures by devising a unique mating process. Galleriinae males initiate mating by attracting females with either chemical or acoustic signals (or a combination of both modalities). Six compounds considered candidates for the sex pheromone have recently been identified in the wing gland extracts of Aphomia sociella males. Prior to the present study, acoustic communication had not been investigated. Signals mediating female attraction were likewise unknown.Observations of A. sociella mating behaviour and recordings of male acoustic signals confirmed that males initiate the mating process. During calling behaviour (stationary wing fanning and pheromone release), males disperse pheromone from their wing glands. When a female approaches, males cease calling and begin to produce ultrasonic songs as part of the courtship behaviour. Replaying of recorded courting songs to virgin females and a comparison of the mating efficiency of intact males with males lacking tegullae proved that male ultrasonic signals stimulate females to accept mating. Greenhouse experiments with isolated pheromone glands confirmed that the male sex pheromone mediates long-range female attraction.Female attraction in A. sociella is chemically mediated, but ultrasonic communication is also employed during courtship. Male ultrasonic songs stimulate female sexual display and significantly affect mating efficiency. Considerable inter-individual differences in song structure exist. These could play a role in female mate selection provided that the female's ear is able to discern them. The A. sociella mating strategy described above is unique within the subfamily Galleriinae."
https://openalex.org/W1994357890,"A major reduction of genetic diversity in mtDNA occurred during the domestication of East Asian pigs. However, the extent to which genetic diversity has been lost in the nuclear genome is uncertain. To reveal levels and patterns of nucleotide diversity and to elucidate the genetic relationships and demographic history of domestic pigs and their ancestors, wild boars, we investigated 14 nuclear markers (including 8 functional genes, 2 pseudogenes and 4 intergenic regions) from 11 different chromosomes in East Asia-wide samples and pooled them with previously obtained mtDNA data for a combined analysis.The results indicated that domestic pigs and wild boars possess comparable levels of nucleotide diversity across the nuclear genome, which is inconsistent with patterns that have been found in mitochondrial genome.This incongruence between the mtDNA and nuclear genomes is suggestive of a large-scale backcross between male wild boars and female domestic pigs in East Asia. Our data reveal the impacts of founder effects and backcross on the pig genome and help us better understand the complex demographic histories of East Asian pigs, which will be useful for future work on artificial selection."

https://openalex.org/W2084868531,"Coxiella burnetii, the etiologic agent of human Q fever, is a gram-negative and naturally obligate intracellular bacterium. The O-specific polysaccharide chain (O-PS) of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of C. burnetii is considered a heteropolymer of the two unusual sugars β-D-virenose and dihydrohydroxystreptose and mannose. We hypothesize that GDP-D-mannose is a metabolic intermediate to GDP-β-D-virenose. GDP-D-mannose is synthesized from fructose-6-phosphate in 3 successive reactions; Isomerization to mannose-6-phosphate catalyzed by a phosphomannose isomerase (PMI), followed by conversion to mannose-1-phosphate mediated by a phosphomannomutase (PMM) and addition of GDP by a GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase (GMP). GDP-D-mannose is then likely converted to GDP-6-deoxy-D-lyxo-hex-4-ulopyranose (GDP-Sug), a virenose intermediate, by a GDP-mannose-4,6-dehydratase (GMD). To test the validity of this pathway in C. burnetii, three open reading frames (CBU0671, CBU0294 and CBU0689) annotated as bifunctional type II PMI, as PMM or GMD were functionally characterized by complementation of corresponding E. coli mutant strains and in enzymatic assays. CBU0671, failed to complement an Escherichia coli manA (PMM) mutant strain. However, complementation of an E. coli manC (GMP) mutant strain restored capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis. CBU0294 complemented a Pseudomonas aeruginosa algC (GMP) mutant strain and showed phosphoglucomutase activity (PGM) in a pgm E. coli mutant strain. Despite the inability to complement a manA mutant, recombinant C. burnetii PMI protein showed PMM enzymatic activity in biochemical assays. CBU0689 showed dehydratase activity and determined kinetic parameters were consistent with previously reported data from other organisms. These results show the biological function of three C. burnetii LPS biosynthesis enzymes required for the formation of GDP-D-mannose and GDP-Sug. A fundamental understanding of C. burnetii genes that encode PMI, PMM and GMP is critical to fully understand the biosynthesic pathway of GDP-β-D-virenose and LPS structure in C. burnetii."
https://openalex.org/W2018668042,"An investigation of long timescale (5 minutes) fMRI neuronal adaptation effects, based on retinotopic mapping and spatial frequency stimuli, is presented in this paper. A hierarchical linear model was developed to quantify the adaptation effects in the visual cortex. The analysis of data involved studying the retinotopic mapping and spatial frequency adaptation effects in the amblyopic cortex. Our results suggest that, firstly, there are many cortical regions, including V1, where neuronal adaptation effects are reduced in the cortex in response to amblyopic eye stimulation. Secondly, our results show the regional contribution is different, and it seems to start from V1 and spread to the extracortex regions. Thirdly, our results show that there is greater adaptation to broadband retinotopic mapping as opposed to narrowband spatial frequency stimulation of the amblyopic eye, and we find significant correlation between fMRI response and the magnitude of the adaptation effect, suggesting that the reduced adaptation may be a consequence of the reduced response to different stimuli reported for amblyopic eyes."

Assuming that the auxiliary variables capture the dependence between recurrence and censoring times, we propose to fit two working models with the auxiliary variables as covariates to define risk groups and then extend an existing weighted logistic regression method for independent censoring to each risk group to accommodate potential dependent censoring. In a simulation study, we show that the proposed method results in both a gain in efficiency and reduction in bias for estimating the recurrence rate. We illustrate the methodology by analyzing a recurrent adenoma dataset from a colorectal polyp prevention trial."
