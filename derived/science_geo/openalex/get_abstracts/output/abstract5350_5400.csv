https://openalex.org/W1522098040,"Membranes prepared from A-431 human epidermoid carcinoma cells retained the ability to bind 125I-labeled epidermal growth factor (EGF) in a specific manner. In the presence of [gamma-32P]ATP and Mn2+ or Mg2+, this membrane preparation was capable of phosphorylating endogenous membrane components, including membrane-associated proteins; the major phosphorylated amino acid residue detected in partial acid hydrolysates was phosphothreonine. The binding of EGF to these membranes in vitro resulted in a severalfold stimulation of the phosphorylation reaction; again, the major phosphorylated amino acid residue detected in partial acid hydrolysates was phosphothreonine. Membrane-associated dephosphorylation reactions did not appear to be affected by EGF. The phosphorylation reaction was not stimulated by cyclic AMP or cyclic GMP in the absence or presence of EGF. The phosphorylation system of the membrane was able to utilize [gamma-32P]GTP in both the basal and EGF-stimulated reactions. The enhanced membrane phosphorylation was specific for EGF and its derivatives; a wide variety of other peptide hormones were ineffective. The A-431 membrane preparation also was capable of phosphorylating exogenous proteins, such as histone, phosvitin, and ribonuclease, by a process which was stimulated by EGF. These findings suggest that one of the biochemical consequences of the binding of EGF to membranes is a rapid activation of a cyclic AMP-independent phosphorylating system."

Junctional conductance and permeability to the dye Lucifer Yellow are markeldy and reversibly decreased by moderate transjunctional polarization in either direction. The relationship between junctional conductance and transjunctional voltage is sufficiently steep that a physiological role in regulation of intercellular communication is plausible."

https://openalex.org/W1496544781,"Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was partially purified from post-endotoxin serum and conditioned media produced by organs from both normal and endotoxin-injected C57BL mice. The organs used to condition medium were heart, thigh muscle, salivary gland, thymus, spleen, kidney, brain, and femur shaft. The charge properties, molecular weights, and concanavalin A binding profiles of these GM-CSFs were analyzed and compared to purified mouse lung GM-CSF. All the GM-CSFs examined were shown to be gycoproteins since a proportion of the activity (80 to 100%) bound to concanavalin A-Sepharose. The organ-conditioned medium GM-CSFs were purified (3- to 13-fold) by absorption to calcium phosphate gel and chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose (further 2- to 10-fold). Analysis of the DEAE-Sepharose elution profiles indicated that there were two major charge species of GM-CSF eluting at conductivities of 10 and 14 mmho. These partially purified GM-CSFs showed considerable differences in their apparent molecular weights on Sephacryl S-200 (37,000 to 200,000). However, these differences could be eliminated by treating the GM-CSFs with neuraminidase and performing molecular sizing experiments under dissociating conditions (Sepharose CL-6B, 6 M guanidine hydrochloride). Although some of the GM-CSFs showed anomalously high molecular weights (40,000) on gel filtration columns, even under dissociating conditions, this appeared to be due to properties of the sialic acid residues. After neuraminidase treatment all of the conditioned medium GM-CSFs eluted from DEAE-Sepharose as a single peak of biological activity at a conductivity of 10 mmho and from gel filtration columns in the presence of 6 M guanidine hydrochloride as a single molecular weight species of approximately 23,000. GM-CSF from post-endotoxin serum (produced in vivo) eluted from the gel filtration column with an apparent molecular weight of 39,000, but analysis using polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate indicated that this GM-CSF also had an apparent molecular weight of 23,000."

https://openalex.org/W1532748746,"Serum-free conditioned medium prepared from an established line of human pancreatic carcinoma (MIA PaCa-2) provides a rich source of colony-stimulating factor (CSF). Two activities distinctly separable by isoelectrofocusing have been identified: a high molecular weight CSF exhibiting greater activity in mouse bone marrow and a low molecular weight CSF more active in human bone marrow. The high molecular weight CSF has been purified 1000-fold to apparent homogeneity by a two-step procedure including isoelectrofocusing and gel filtration chromatography. The purified CSF has a molecular weight of 50,000 and an isoelectric point of 3.7 to 4.6. It is a glycoprotein as shown by periodic acid-Schiff stain and exhibits greater activity in mouse marrow than in human marrow."

https://openalex.org/W183010435,"Quiescent T (thymus-derived) lymphocytes have no insulin receptors. Lymphocyte activation by alloantigen or mitogens stimulates receptor appearance. There are two theories that may explain the mechanism by which cellular activation leads to newly measurable receptors: 1) activation uncovers nascent receptors by alteration of membrane configuration or 2) activation initiates synthesis of the receptor or substances crucial to the integrity of the receptor. This study was designed to test the latter theory directly. T cells were activated with the mitogen phytohemagglutinin (PM) and treated with either mitomycin C (100 pg/ml), cycloheximide (0.5 mu), or actinomycin D (1 PM). Controls consisted of cells cultured with mitogen alone or with medium alone. Inhibitors reduced DNA synthesis 83% (r3H]thymidine), RNA synthesis 90% (r3H]uridine), and protein synthesis 88% (13H]leucine) in separate series of studies. Insulin binding after PHA interaction was 4.0 f 0.6 pg/106 in control and 3.93 + 0.1 in mitomycintreated cultures. In contrast, binding after PHA activation (75 gg/ml) fell from 6.3 + 1.3 to 0.4 + 0.2 pg/106 cells after RNA synthesis inhibition. Inhibition of DNAdependent, RNA synthesis by 96%, as measured by assay of RNA polymerase II, by cx-amanitin (1"

Light-reared animals were able to mediate guided behaviors with an immobilized eye, but animals with the eye immobilized before initial exposure to a lighted environment were not. Eye movement is implied to play an essential role in visual-motor development."

https://openalex.org/W1607161155,"The transfer of phospholipids between two membrane substrates catalyzed by a soluble protein fraction from Rhodopseudomonas sphaeroides has been demonstrated. The assay employs purified intracytoplasmic membrane (ICM) vesicles derived from cells of R. sphaeroides grown on [3H]acetate as the phospholipid donor substrate and phosphatidylcholine (70%)/phosphatidylethanolamine (30%) unilamellar liposomes containing [14C]triolein, a nontransferable marker, as the acceptor substrate for transferred phospholipids. Incubation of these two membrane substrates with a 40 to 80% (NH4)2SO4 protein fraction from R. sphaeroides results in the transfer of tritium-labeled ICM phospholipids to the acceptor membrane substrate. Upon completion of the incubation period, the donor ICM vesicles are quantitatively separated from the acceptor liposomes by precipitation with antibody prepared against whole, purified ICM vesicles. Phospholipid transfer is linear with respect to time and protein concentration, is inhibited by trypsin and heat, and shows an absolute dependence upon the presence of acceptor liposomes and the 40 to 80% (NH4)2SO4 protein fraction. Control experiments indicate that no fusion of the donor and acceptor membrane occurs during the incubation period and that, following prolonged incubation there is no detectable degradation of the labeled lipid components. Preliminary data on the phospholipid specificity of the transfer reaction is also presented."

https://openalex.org/W1527180528,"Poly(A)-containing RNA from rat parotid gland directs the cell-free synthesis of several products in the reticulocyte lysate translation system including a very prominent 58,000-dalton polypeptide which is immunoreactive with anti-alpha-amylase. Purified alpha-amylase has a molecular weight estimated as 56,000 daltons. The 58,000-dalton, cell-free product and alpha-amylase share common peptides as determined by analysis of their limited proteolysis digests. The cross-reactivity and peptide homology suggest that the cell-free product may be a precursor of mature alpha-amylase. While the NH2 terminus of alpha-amylase is blocked, that of the 58,000-dalton product evidently is not, and automated sequence analysis has yielded its partial sequence as: Met-X-Phe-Phe-Leu-Leu-Leu-X-Leu-Ile-X-Leu-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-X-Phe-X-X-X-X-X-Ile-X-X-Leu-Phe. The highly hydrophobic nature of the NH2 terminus of the 58,000-dalton, cell-free product suggests that, like other secreted polypeptides, the extra piece may play a role in the transport and secretion of the mature alpha-amylase."

Edge spectra of potassium in various chemical environments were measured, and each environment gives a unique edge spectrum. Hydrated potassium has a unique spectrum that is insensitive to counterions. Comparison of the spectra shows that the chemical state of potassium in cells differs appreciably from that in aqueous solutions."

https://openalex.org/W1568435232,"At low microsome concentrations, the addition of cytosol from bovine adrenal cortex markedly accelerates the rate of hydroxylation of 17-hydroxyprogesterone at C-21. The detection of this effect was made possible by the development of a new, rapid, and sensitive procedure for the measurement of the initial rate kinetics of steroid 21-hydroxylase. This procedure is based on the fact that the reactant, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, possesses solvent partition properties which are different from those of the product, cortexolone. The specificity of the assay was confirmed by the isolation of only one product which was identified as cortexolone by radiochemical techniques. This assay procedure has great sensitivity and makes possible the accurate determination of the Michaelis constant at low enzyme concentrations. The Km for 17-hydroxyprogesterone with saturating amounts of TPNH was found to be 0.3 micronM. At the low microsome concentrations permitted by this assay, the addition of cytosol has a profound effect upon the rate of hydroxylation. The rate is markedly accelerated although the Km for the substrate is not altered. Neither the substrate nor the carbon monoxide-induced difference spectra are changed by the addition of cytosol, suggesting that activation by cytosol dose not affect the catalytic unit of the 21-hydroxylase complex."
https://openalex.org/W1981149354,"The transmission of the Z deficient allele of alpha 1-antitrypsin was studied in 23 families, each with a single parent heterozygous for this allele. When the mother carried the Z allele, the distribution of phenotypes in the children did not differ significantly from the expected frequency. In contrast, when the father was the carrier, a significant increase of heterozygous phenotypes was observed in the children. This observation suggests that a selective advantage is associated with the expression of the Z allele in male gametes."
