The primary product should be a soluble substance, less stable than fibrinogen, which he called profibrin. By suitable choice of the composition of the electrolytes of the medium, we succeeded in studying the two phases of the reaction separately; thus we obtained a substance which has a better-founded claim to the name profibrin."

https://openalex.org/W1969842261,"THE extraction of the carcinogenic hydrocarbon 3:4-benzpyrene from coal tar, whether by the original method of Cook, Hewett and Hieger1 (using repeated fractional distillation, extraction with solvents, formation of picrates, and crystallizations) or by Winterstein's modification2 (involving chromatography), is generally considered too laborious, and the yields obtained too low, to serve as a practical measure for routine supplies. Hence the use of synthetic 3:4-benzpyrene for most experimental needs. When it was found3, however, by a spectrographic method of estimation, that tar might contain as much as 1·5 per cent of benzpyrene, a re-investigation of the methods of isolating the hydrocarbon from tar seemed desirable."

https://openalex.org/W2400401612,"FITCH1 has revealed the discovery by German workers of prophylactic activity in 4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-3-n-heptylquinaldme (I) against avian malaria. We have examined a number of tetrahydro-acridones (II; n = 2), hydroxydihydro-β-quinindenes (II; n = 1) and 4-hydroxyquinolines for prophylactic activity in P. gallinaceum infections in chicks and have found noteworthy activity in certain compounds which, so far as the work has proceeded, conform to type (III), of which (I) and (II) are representative, R' and R"" being saturated hydrocarbon residues."

Previously, the only guide in this direction was the list, probably not altogether comprehensive, published from time to time in Mikrochemie before the War. As a consequence, discussion of the teaching of microchemistry must of necessity have been based largely on estimates derived solely from personal contacts and hearsay, and any statement about it was justly open to doubt."

https://openalex.org/W2057626186,"IN his letter, Mr. J. Phelps1 refers to an interesting point in the manufacture of threepences, namely, their expansion in the coining press into dodecagonal steel collars. The fact that the corners of coins subsequent to 1940 are more rounded than are those of earlier ones seems to point to a change in the collars at about that date. If this is the case, it will also explain the change in the size of the coins which occurred at about the same time referred to in my letter2."

https://openalex.org/W2029876437,"IT has long been a matter for surprise that the eye appears to be so perfectly achromatized. It was this which led Euler to conclude that the construction of achromatic lenses must be possible, and in consequence the optician Dollond sought for a method, and thus invented the use of negative flint lenses in association with positive crown glass ones. The celebrated cobalt-blue glass experiment and many others amply demonstrate the fact that the lens system of the eye is uncorrected for colour. It was this fact that presumably led to the remark, which is often ascribed to Helmholtz, that if a lens maker turned out so inferior a lens as that of the eye he would soon be out of business."

The chair was taken by Sir Robert Watson-Watt, and the chief speakers were Prof. J. D. Bernal, Mrs. J. Robinson and Mr. Dennis Chapman. In his opening remarks, the chairman explained that the meeting had been convened to examine the implications of the increasingly closer relations which were growing between workers in the natural and social fields of science. He therefore stressed the indivisibility of science in furthering what he called the ""engineering efficiency"" of the community. He announced that the Lord President of the Council, the President of the Board of Trade, and the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production had been invited to attend the meeting, and all three Ministers had expressed their keen interest in the matter under consideration. The Lord President had replied that he would consider sympathetically any proposals formulated at the meeting which would be conveyed to him; the Minister of Supply and Aircraft Production was represented at the meeting by one of his directors of scientific research."
https://openalex.org/W4252903845,"IN the accounts of scientific effort during the War on which the veil of secrecy has now been lifted, one common feature stands out on even the most casual reading. Whether we look at the efforts which went to the development of the atomic bomb, of radar, of 'Pluto', 'Fido', and British flame weapons, or in a vastly different field, of penicillin, the extent to which the achievements depend on team work is unmistakable. Sir Cecil Weir was at pains recently to emphasize the way in which in 1942 the Ministry of Supply brought together potential manufacturers of penicillin and interested men of science, and the fact that production was under way or about to commence in twelve factories run by eight firms was the direct outcome of the team work thus engendered. As a particular instance is the help given by experts of the Medical Research Council, and especially Dr. R. I. N. Greaves, of the Serum Drying Unit, Cambridge, in the design of the freeze-drying plant of the Glaxo penicillin plant at Greenford."
