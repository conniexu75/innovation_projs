https://openalex.org/W1584235297,"Highly purified cytochromes P-450, designated P450,, P-450b, and P-450,, have been isolated from hepatic microsomes of rats treated with the polychlorinated biphenyl mixture Aroclor 1254. Each form shows a single protein-staining band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels with minimum molecular weights of 48,000 (P-450,), 52,000 (P-450& and 56,000 (P-450,). Cytochromes P-450, and P-450,, have been obtained from phenobarbital-treated rats, and cytochromes P-450, and P-450, were isolated from 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats. Cytochrome P-450,, is the major hemeprotein inducible by phenobarbital, and cytochrome P-450, is the predominant hemeprotein induced by 3-methylcholanthrene. The CO-reduced difference spectral peak of cytochrome P-450, is at 452 nm, P-45Ob is at 450 nm, and P-450, is at 447 nm. Cytochrome P-450, preferentially hydroxylates testosterone at the 7a: position but has low catalytic activity for the metabolism of benzphetamine, benzo[a]pyrene, 7-ethoxycoumarin, and zoxazolamine. Cytochrome P-450,, catalyzes the hydroxylation of testosterone at the 16a: position and the demethylation of benzphetamine most efficiently. Cytochrome P-450, has very high catalytic activity for benzo[a]pyrene and zoxazolamine hydroxylation and 7-ethoxycoumarin O-dealkylation. Aniline is hydroxylated by the three forms of cytochrome P-450 at comparable rates. Antisera prepared against cytochrome P-450,, P-450,,, or P-450, do not cross-react with the heterologous antigens in Ouchterlony double diffusion plates. When cytochromes P-450,, P-450b, and P-450,, were subjected to limited proteolysis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate, the resulting peptide maps provided additional evidence that these hemeproteins are structurally distinct. The forms of cytochrome P-450 obtained from phenobarbitaland 3-methylcholanthrene-treated rats are indistinguishable from the corresponding forms from Aroclor 1254~treated rats by all criteria examined."
https://openalex.org/W1977833662,"We have determined the nucleotide sequences of the germ line gene as well as a corresponding somatically mutated and rearranged gene coding for a mouse immunoglobulin λ1 type light chain. These sequencing studies were carried out on three Eco RI-DNA fragments which had been cloned from BALB/c mouse embryos or a λ1 chainsecreting myeloma, H2020. The embryonic DNA clone Ig 99λ contains two protein-encoding segments, one for the majority of the hydrophobic leader (L) and the other for the rest of the leader and the variable (V) region of the λ0 chain (Cohn et al., 1974); these segments are separated by a 93 base pair (bp) intervening sequence (I-small). The coding of the V region ends with His at residue 97. The second embryonic DNA clone Ig 25λ includes a 39 bp DNA segment (J) coding for the rest of the conventionally defined V region (that is, up to residue 110), and also contains the sequence coding for the constant (C) region approximately 1250 untranslated bp (l-large) away from the J sequence. The J sequence is directly linked with the V-coding sequence in the myeloma DNA clone, lg 303λ, which has the various DNA segments arranged in the following order: 5′ untranslated region, L, I-small, V linked with J, l-large, C, 3′ untranslated sequence. The Ig 303λ V DNA sequence codes for the V region synthesized by the H2020 myeloma and is different from the Ig 99λ V DNA sequence by only two bases. No silent base change was observed between the two DNA clones for the entire sequence spanning the 5′ untranslated regions and the V-coding segments. These results confirm the previously drawn conclusion that an active complete λ1 gene arises by somatic recombination that takes place at the ends of the V-coding DNA segment and the J sequence. No sequence homology was observed at or near the sites of the recombination."

Indications are that one of the most important constants in this microcosmos is the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) of the species. A test of any interpretation of the MHC's role in immunity is how well it explains this system's polymorphism. One of the most crucial questions an MHC hypothesis must answer is: Why are there so many alleles at this complex?"
https://openalex.org/W2004225662,"Mild staphylococcal nuclease digestions under isotonic conditions release fragments of a 200 Å diameter fiber from nuclei of Drosophila melanogaster tissue culture cells. These soluble fragments have high sedimentation coefficients (30–100S) and show tightly packed nucleosomes in the electron microscope. Under the same conditions, newly replicated chromatin is released as more slowly sedimenting fragments (14S). Within 20 min after DNA replication, the nascent chromatin gradually matures into compact supranucleosomal structures which are indistinguishable from bulk chromatin on the isokinetic sucrose gradients. We have used this fractionation technique to examine the question of the fate and assembly of the new histones. After short pulses with either 35S-methionine or 3H-lysine, the radioactive histones do not co-sediment with the bulk chromatin but appear instead in the fractions where the newly replicated DNA is found. Furthermore, the various nascent histones appear in different fractions on the gradient: histones H3 and H4 in 10–15S structures, histones H2A and H2B in 15–50S structures and histone H1 in 30–100S structures. These results, together with the analysis of pulse and pulse-chase experiments of both nascent DNA and histones, strongly suggest that histones H3 and H4 are deposited first on the nascent DNA (during or slightly after the DNA is replicated), histones H2A and H2B are deposited next (2–10 min later) and histone H1 is deposited last (10–20 min after DNA replication). A high turnover 20,000 dalton protein is also associated with the newly replicated chromatin."
https://openalex.org/W1536157072,"The highly purified prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase from bovine vesicular gland microsomes had two still unresolved enzyme activities; the oxygenative cyclization of 8,11,14-eicosatrienoic acid to produce prostaglandin G1 and the conversion of the 15-hydro-peroxide of prostaglandin G1 to a 15-hydroxyl group, producing prostaglandin H1. The latter enzymatic reaction required heme and was stimulated by a variety of compounds, including tryptophan, epinephrine, and guaiacol, but not by glutathione. A peroxidatic dehydrogenation was demonstrated with epinephrine or guaiacol in the presence of various hydroperoxides, including hydrogen peroxide and prostaglandin G1. Higher activity and affinity were observed with the 15-hydroperoxide of eicosapolyenoic acid, especially those with the prostaglandin structure. Both the dehydrogenation of epinephrine or guaiacol and the 15-hydroperoxide reduction of prostaglandin G1 were demonstrated in nearly stoichiometric quantities. With tryptophan, however, such a stoichiometric transformation was not observed. The peroxidase activity as followed with guaiacol and hydrogen peroxide and the tryptophan-stimulated conversion of prostaglandin G1 to H1 were not dissociable as examined by isoelectric focusing, heat treatment, pH profile, and heme specificity. The results suggest that the peroxidase with a broad substrate specificity is an integral part of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthetase which is responsible for the conversion of prostaglandin G1 to H1."

https://openalex.org/W2000971934,"The nuclear precursors of the immunoglobulin messenger RNAs of MPC-11 cells were characterized with respect to size, amount per cell and extent of polyadenylation. These cells produce three Ig mRNAs: a 1.8 kb component coding for a γ2b heavy chain (H mRNA), a 1.2 kb mRNA coding for a κ light chain (L mRNA) and a 0.8 kb mRNA coding for the constant region portion of the κ light chain (L1 mRNA). To identify the pre-mRNAs without ambiguity, we constructed recombinant DNA plasmids containing H and L cDNA sequences, and used the cloned cDNAs as hybridization probes for analysis of steady state nuclear RNA and in DNA excess hybridization experiments with pulse-labeled nuclear RNA. The nuclear molecules containing Ig sequences consist of an 11 kb component (H1), which we believe to be the primary transcript of the H gene, 5.3 kb (L1), and 3.3 kb (L2) components, which seem to be primary transcripts of the L and L1 genes, components corresponding to mature size H, L and L1 mRNAs, and several intermediatesized components which include the processing derivatives. The precursor role of these nuclear molecules was established by studies of their labeling kinetics and by appropriate pulse-chase experiments. All the pre-mRNA species including H1, L1 and L2 contain poly(A), thus suggesting that polyadenylation is an early event in the processing of these mRNAs. The MPC-11 cell contains about 30,000 and 40,000 cytoplasmic H and L mRNA molecules, respectively, which must be produced within one cell generation (∼24 hr). In comparison, the nucleus contains about 100–150 molecules of total pre-mRNA and only about 10–15 molecules of presumptive primary transcripts for each of these Ig species. These values indicate very rapid transcription rates (>20 transcripts per min) and exceptionally fast processing rates (∼0.5 min for the primary transcripts and ∼5 min for overall nuclear processing) for the Ig mRNAs. Thus rapid transcription and processing, together with high cytoplasmic stability, account for the high abundance of Ig mRNAs in the myeloma cell."

https://openalex.org/W1518304924,"An equilibrium mixture of highly enriched [18(O)]Pi (represents the mixture of [[18(O)4]Pi, [[18(O)3]Pi, [18(O)2]Pi as represented in the figures, unless otherwise specified), alpha-D-ribose 1-[16(O)]phosphate, and hypoxanthine plus inosine was equilibrated with calf spleen purine-nucleoside phosphorylase (EC 2.4.2.1). The 31P NMR spectrum clearly indicated the formation of alpha-D-ribose 1-[18(O)4]-phosphate and of [16(O)]Pi. Incubation for the same time span in the absence of alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate left the [18(O)4]Pi isotopic distribution unchanged. The results clearly demonstrated that the C--O bond of alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate is cleaved in the enzymatic reaction. It is unlikely that the enzyme catalyzes the exchange of oxygen between Pi and H2O. Several possible mechanistic pathways are ruled out by the results, which demand attack by a phosphate oxygen at the anomeric C-1' atom."
https://openalex.org/W2131074060,Differentiation of the single cells that yield bristles and hairs in Drosophila has been examined by studies of phenocopies induced by heat shock. Phenocopies that resemble the mutants hook and javelin are produced by application of the stress within narrow and specific time ranges during metamorphosis. Double phenocopies can be induced by successive heat shocks at appropriate time intervals. Phenocopy production may be related to heat shock effects on RNA synthesis through a feedback inhibition of transcription by heat shock proteins.

https://openalex.org/W1566231425,"The polysaccharides from the envelopes of heterocysts and spores of Anabaena cylindrica consist of repeating units containing 1 mannosyl and 3 glucosyl residues, all linked by beta(1 yields 3) glycosidic bonds, with glycosidic bonds, with glucose, xylose, galactose, and mannose present in side branches. Degradation of the polysaccharides with specific glycosidases has permitted identification of the linkages to almost all of the branches. When the polysaccharides, from which all but two types of side branches had been cleaved, were digested with a beta(1 yields 3) endoglucanase, glucose, a tri-, and a pentasaccharide were produced. The oligosaccharide products were identified as (see article of journal). The backbones of the polysaccharides were sequenced from the reducing terminus by a modified Smith degradation. Analysis with NaB3H4 at each stage of the degradation showed that the backbones terminate in the sequence Man-Glc-Glc-Glc and are therefore presumed to have the structure (Man-Glc-Glc-Glc)n, and that they contain an average of from 128 to 150 sugar residues. From the information obtained, the repeating sequences of the original polysaccharides from the two types of differentiated cells of A. cylindrica could be largely deduced and appeared to be identical."

https://openalex.org/W1603251328,"Phosphorylation of skeletal muscle glycogen synthase catalyzed by a protein kinase is stimulated up to 10-fold by the calcium-dependent regulator (CDR) protein. Half-maximal stimulation requires about 1 microgram of CDR/ml. Phosphorylation by the CDR-dependent synthase kinase is more rapid at pH 8.6 than at pH 6.8 and is blocked by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl-ether)N,N'-tetraacetic acid and trifuloperazine. Approximately 60 to 70% of the phosphate is incorporated into the trypsin-insensitive region of glycogen synthase resulting in conversion of the a form to the b form of the enzyme. The CDR-dependent synthase kinase is not myosin light chain kinase, as this enzyme does not phosphorylate glycogen synthase. Furthermore, synthase phosphorylation by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic subunit is not affected by CDR. The possibility that CDR-dependent synthase kinase may be phosphorylase kinase is being investigated."
https://openalex.org/W1519480480,"NADPH-cytochrome c (P-450) reductase (EC 1.6.2.4) was purified to apparent homogeneity from microsomes of house flies, Musca domestica L. The purification procedure involves column chromatography on three different resins. The key step in the purification scheme is the chromatography of the enzyme mixture on an affinity column of agarose-hexane-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate. The enzyme has an estimated molecular weight of 83,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and contains 1 mol each of FAD and FMN per mol of enzyme. The enzyme exhibited a Bi Bi ping-pong kinetic mechanism with NADPH and cytochrome c. The Vmax and Km for cytochrome c were 42.3 mumol min-1 mg-1 and 12.7 muM, respectively. Turnover numbers based on micromoles of enzyme were 2,600 min-1. NADP+ and 2'-AMP both inhibited the reductases with apparent Ki values of 6.9 and 187 muM, respectively. These preparations of NADPH-cytochrome c reductase were found to reduce purified house fly cytochrome P-450 in the presence of NADPH."

Fractionation of the brain extract by DEAE-cellulose chromatography produces three protein fractions which metabolize TRH. The activity of these fractions was characterized using TRH with a 3H-label on the histidine or proline as well as [His-3H]His-ProNH2. Fraction I contains pyroglutamate aminopeptidase and Fraction II contains TRH deamidase. Fraction III was found to contain a previously unrecognized enzyme which cleaves His-ProNH2 to histidine and proline. The histidylprolineamide imidopeptidase has been characterized. A competition study using a variety of compounds containing histidine or proline suggests that the best substrates for the imidopeptidase contain a free alpha-amino group on histidine and a blocked carboxyl group on proline, as is found in His-ProNH2. A survey of a variety of polypeptide hormones indicates that many of them inhibit the imidopeptidase activity. A kinetic study of the inhibition of the enzyme by adrenocorticotropic hormone (1-24) shows that the inhibition by polypeptide hormones is noncompetitive. We hypothesize that pituitary hormones may stimulate the production of (cyclo)-His-Pro by inhibiting alternate routes of TRH metabolism."

https://openalex.org/W65508499,"Bacillus subtilis CMK33 is a mutant that is more osmotically fragile than the wild type when it is converted to the protoplast form. The protoplasts of this mutant contain a membrane-bound lipase, which is not found in protoplasts of the wild type. Hydrolysis of the membrane lipid of mutant protoplasts by the lipase is the cause of their fragility. A protein found in the wild type organism specifically inhibits the lipase (Kent, C., and Lennarz, W. J. (1972) Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 69, 2793-2797). This paper reports that cultures of both mutant and wild type cells contain an extracellular lipase which accumulates during the logarithmic phase of growth. The extracellular activity appears to be induced by a component of the growth medium. The membrane-bound lipase of the mutant has been partially purified and its properties have been compared to those of the extracellular lipase of the wild type. Their properties and sensitivity to the wild type inhibitor are similar, which suggests that the two molecules are closely related. The subcellular location of the lipase in the mutant has been investigated and compared to the location of the membrane-bound portion of the lipase inhibitor in the wild type. The lipase is located almost exclusively in the cytoplasmic membrane and not in mesosomal vesicles. In contrast, the lipase inhibitor is located in both types of membranes and is more concentrated in mesosomal vesicles. Under appropriate conditions, the appearance of new extracellular lipase activity in mutant cultures is paralleled by the loss of an equivalent amount of lipase activity from protoplasts prepared from the cells. This suggests that the membrane-bound lipase may be an intermediate in the secretion of the extracellular lipase. Because of the mutation in B. subtilis CMK33, which results in the absence of the lipase inhibitor, this intermediate can be found in protoplasts of the mutant, although it is not detectable in the wild type. Consequently, the mutant may be useful in studies of the mechanism of secretion of exoenzymes by Bacilli."
https://openalex.org/W61938030,"Thymidylate synthetase from Lactobacillus casei was S-carboxymethylated and degraded by treatment with cyanogen bromide. Although the protein contains 6 methionine residues, only 5 cyanogen bromide peptides were obtained due to the presence of 1 methionine on the NH2 terminus and another adjacent to a threonine residue which was resistant to cleavage. The peptides were isolated by differential extraction, first with ammonium acetate, then pyridine acetate, and finally the residue was solubilized with 50% acetic acid. Each peptide was further purified to homogeneity by Bio-Gel chromatography. The size of the peptides from the amino to carboxyl end of the enzyme subunit was CNBr 1, 4,100; CNBr 2, 10,300; CNBr 3, 8,100; CNBr 4, 11,800; CNBr 5, 2,200. The sum of the amino acid residues of the peptides is equal to the sum of the residues in an enzyme subunit, indicating that all of the CNBr peptides have been isolated. The CNBr-resistant methionine was located in CNBr 2 and the 5-fluoro-2‘-deoxyuridine 5‘-monophosphate binding site in CNBr 4. The holoenzyme molecular weight, based on the residue weights of the amino acids in the two equivalent subunits, is equal to 73,176. The complete sequence of each of the CNBr peptides, except for CNBr 4, which is presented in the following paper, is described."

Purity was critically ascertained by anion exchange chromatography, ultracentrifugal analysis, isoelectric focusing, sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide electrophoresis, and crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Use of crossed immunoelectrophoresis to examine mucin preparations has not been previously reported. This technique was useful for assessing purity and displaying charge and size microheterogeneity in the purified S-carboxymethylated mucin. Threonine and serine comprised 37.8% of the total amino acids while the oligosaccharide moiety contained N-acetyl-glucosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine, fucose, galactose, N-acetylneuraminic acid, and sulfate.

https://openalex.org/W1503924509,"During embryonic development of the chick, the onset of calcium transport by the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) is concomitant with the appearance of a calcium-binding protein (CaBP). The development-specific expression of the CaBP in the CAM is inhibited by vitamin K antagonism in ovo with the anticoagulant, warfarin. However, the CaBP remains immunologically detectable in the CAM of warfarin-treated embryos, suggesting the presence of a precursor form of the CaBP. Previously, we have demonstrated that CaBP expression in CAM organ cultures is inducible by vitamin K. Furthermore, the CaBP contains several residues of the modified amino acid, gamma-carboxyglutamic acid (gamma-CGlu), which has been shown to be formed by vitamin K-dependent carboxylation of glutamic acid in several plasma clotting proteins. This study reports the presence of a post-translational, vitamin K-dependent gamma-glutamyl carboxylase activity in the CAM. Our results show that explants of CAM incorporate H14CO3 in an age-specific and vitamin K-dependent manner. Incorporation of H14CO3 by the CAM is further potentiated by warfarin treatment of the embryos, presumably owing to an elevation of the amount of endogenous uncarboxylated protein precursor(s). Among the subcellular (nuclear, mitochondrial, microsomal, and soluble) fractions of the CAM, only microsomes exhibit specific incorporation of of H14CO3 into gamma-CGlu. The CAM microsomal carboxylation activity is post-translational, vitamin K-dependent, specific for prenylated homologs of vitamin K, sensitive to warfarin, and appears to be unrelated to the activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase. Optimal carboxylation activity occurs after incubation of the microsomes with H14CO3 for 60 min at 37 degrees C in the presence of over 100 microgram of vitamin K1/ml."

This result provides an explanation for the very efficient proton transfer between hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase, a transfer which enhances the catalytic activity of carbonic anhydrase as measured by 18O exchange between bicarbonate and water at chemical equilibrium (Silverman, D. N., Tu, C. K., and Wynns, G. C. (1978) J. Biol. Chem, 253, 2563-2567). Two rate constants describing 18O exchange activity of carbonic anhydrase at pH 7.5 show saturation behavior when plotted against hemoglobin concentration consistent with a dissociation constant of 2.5 X 10(-6) M between bovine hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase. Interpretation of these rate constants in terms of a two-step model for 18O exchange indicates that hemoglobin enhances the rate of exchange from carbonic anhydrase of water containing the oxygen abstracted from bicarbonate, but does not affect the catalytic interconversion of CO2 and HCO3- at chemical equilibrium."

Colchicine, Colcemid, and vinblastine (1.0 muM) caused a marked reduction in HMG-CoA reductase activity and, as a consequence, the rate of cholesterol synthesis in these cells. No effect was observed with lumicolchicine, a mixture of colchicine isomers with no effect on microtubules. The effect of colchicine was apparent within 1 h after addition to the culture medium, and, after 6 h, HMG-CoA reductase activity in treated cells was only approximately 15 to 30% of that in untreated cells. Reductase activity was very sensitive to the concentration of drug added, i.e. cells treated with just 0.1 muM colchicine for 6 h exhibited a 50% lower enzymatic activity than did untreated cells. The lack of a generalized, nonspecific toxic effect on the cells was indicated by the finding of no change in the activities of fatty acid synthetase and NADPH-cytochrome c reductase and the rate of total protein synthesis in cells treated with colchicine (1 muM) for 6 h. A close temporal and quantitative correlation was observed between the effects of colchicine on HMG-CoA reductase and on a parameter of microtubular function, i.e. maintenance of glial cell shape. The data suggest that microtubules are involved in the regulation of HMG-CoA reductase and cholesterol synthesis in C-6 glial cells."

When the strain is shifted from a nonpermissive to a permissive temperature, radioactive label is lost from the 9 S RNA and appears in 5 S rRNA. The identification of this 5 S rRNA-containing molecule indicates the participation of a new processing ribonuclease (RNase E) in the maturation of rRNA in E. coli.

This suggests that factors other than membrane changes might be involved in the apparent increase in receptor binding affinity with increasing site occupancy. The elution pattern of 125I-con A chromatographed on Bio-Gel P-150 with decreasing concentration showed a drop in average molecular weight compatible with con A dissociation to dimers, protomers, and protomer fragments. Similarly, the per cent of 125I-con A specifically binding to Sephadex G-75 fell with decreasing concentration of con A applied. The inclusion of unlabeled carrier con A suppressed the dissociation of labeled con A in Bio-Gel P-150 and increased the per cent binding to Sephadex G-75. Both labeled and unlabeled con A were multibanded in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. As previously reported, the three major bands are consistent with intact protomer (approximately 25,000 daltons) and two fragments (approximately 13,000 and 10,000 daltons) with minor bands representing undissociated species. These observations indicate that there is a concentration-dependent association of Con A subunits which contribute to the observed positive cooperativity of con A binding to erythrocytes."

A normal erythrocyte has approximately 8 times 10(5) receptor sites for each isolectin; however, the association constants (Ka) of binding increased from 1.1 times 10(7) M-1 to 3.8 times 10(8) M-1, with increasing number of E subunits per tetrameric isolectin molecule. Isolectin to erythrocyte binding reached equilibrium rapidly and was reversed by fetuin. All isolectins competed with 125I-E4 for erythrocyte binding sites, with a constant (KI) similar to the Ka calculated for each respective radiolabeled isolectin. When isolectin binding at 0 degrees C, 4 degrees C, or 8 degrees C was compared to that at 25 degrees C, there was no reduction in the number of binding sites per cell, but the Ka of E4 was reduced to 3 times 10(7) M-1.
