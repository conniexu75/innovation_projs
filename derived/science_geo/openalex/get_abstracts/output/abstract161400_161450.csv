All of the mechanism(s) by which nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exert their protective effects are not completely understood, but they are known to inhibit cyclooxygenase activity. The cyclooxygenase enzymes catalyze a key reaction in the conversion of arachidonic acid to prostaglandins, such as prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Here we demonstrate that PGE2 treatment of LS-174 human colorectal carcinoma cells leads to increased motility and changes in cell shape. The prostaglandin EP4 receptor signaling pathway appears to play a role in transducing signals which regulate these effects. PGE2 treatment results in an activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathway that is required for the PGE2-induced changes in carcinoma cell motility and colony morphology. Our results suggest that PGE2 might enhance the invasive potential of colorectal carcinoma cells via activation of major intracellular signal transduction pathways not previously reported to be regulated by prostaglandins.

Inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity is thought to represent one of the mechanisms by which NSAIDs exert their anti-neoplastic effects (Refs. 4Sheng H. Shao J. Kirkland S.C. Isakson P.

In support of this hypothesis, lack of the COX-2 (prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase-2) gene results in a reduction of the number of tumors which develop in mice heterozygous for an APCΔ716 mutation by more than 7-fold (7Oshima M.

Additionally, COX-2 expression in colorectal carcinoma cells provides a growth and survival advantage (5Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N.

Lubet R. Steele V. Kelloff G. Paulson S. Seibert K. Rao C.V. Cancer Res. 2000; 60: 293-297PubMed Google Scholar). There are two isoforms of prostaglandin endoperoxide synthase, which are commonly referred to as COX-1 and COX-2. COX-1 is produced constitutively in many different cell types and tissues (12O'Neill G. Hutchinson A.F. FEBS Lett. 1993; 330: 156-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (732) Google Scholar), but its expression can be regulated under some circumstances (13Smith C.J. Morrow J.D. Roberts L.J., II Marnett L.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 192: 787-793Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). COX-2 is induced by cytokines, growth factors, and tumor promoters (reviewed in Ref. 14Williams C.S. DuBois R.N. Am. J. Physiol. 1996; 270: G393-G400PubMed Google Scholar). In studies of human colorectal cancer, COX-2 levels are increased in about 90% of cancers and ∼50% of pre-malignant colorectal adenomas, but the enzyme is not usually detected in adult intestinal tissues (15Eberhart C.E.

PGH2 is subsequently converted to a variety of prostaglandins, which include PGE2, PGD2, PGF2α, PGI2, and thromboxane A2 by each respective prostaglandin synthase. Prostaglandins are synthesized by a wide variety of human tissues and serve as autocrine or paracrine lipid mediators to signal changes within their immediate environment. PGs are involved in diverse biological processes, which include inflammation, blood clotting, ovulation, implantation, initiation of labor, bone metabolism, nerve growth, wound healing, kidney function, blood vessel tone, and immune responses (reviewed in Ref. 17DuBois R.N. Abramson S.B. Crofford L. Gupta R.A. Simon L.S. Van De Putte L.B.A. Lipsky P.E. FASEB J. 1998; 12: 1063-1073Crossref PubMed Scopus (2198) Google Scholar). The precise contribution of increased biosynthesis of prostaglandins by COX-2 to the progression of neoplasia is currently under evaluation. For example, PGE2 generated in colorectal carcinomas may enhance cell survival and/or may affect other aspects of epithelial cell behavior such as cell-cell or cell-substrate adhesion (5Sheng H. Shao J. Morrow J.D. Beauchamp R.D. DuBois R.N. Cancer Res. 1998; 58: 362-366PubMed Google Scholar). A link between the neoplastic effect of carcinogen treatment and prostaglandin signaling was recently made by the observation that genetic disruption of the E-prostanoid receptor subtype 1 (EP1) results in a reduction in the number of aberrant crypt foci that develop in mice following carcinogen treatment (18Watanabe K. Kawamori T. Nakatsugi S. Ohta T. Ohuchida S. Yamamoto H. Maruyama T. Kondo K. Ushikubi F. Narumiya S. Sugimura T. Wakabayashi K. Cancer Res. 1999; 59: 5093-5096PubMed Google Scholar). Based on these findings, we sought to determine the effects of PGE2 on the biology of colorectal carcinoma cells. We found that PGE2 stimulated an increase in the proliferation and motility of colorectal carcinoma cells. LS-174 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA). The cells were maintained in McCoy's 5A medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. LY 294002 and wortmannin were purchased from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). PGE2, butaprost, sulprostone, and PGE1 alcohol were purchased from Cayman Chemical (Ann Arbor, MI). Immunoblot analysis was performed as described previously (19Sheng G.G. Shao J. Sheng H. Hooton E.B. Isakson P.C. Morrow J.D. Coffey R.J. DuBois R.N. Beauchamp R.D. Gastroenterology. 1997; 113: 1883-1891Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed for 30 min in radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (1× PBS, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 10 mg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate) and then clarified cell lysates were denatured and fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and the filters were incubated with the antibodies indicated and developed by the enhanced chemiluminescence system (ECL, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The anti-phosphorylated Akt antibody was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA), and the anti-active ERK1/2 antibody was fromPromega (Madison, WI). 1 × 104 cells were suspended in 0.5 ml of 1:2 diluted Matrigel® (Collaborative Biomedical Products, Bedford, MA), and the mixture was plated into 24-well plates. PGE2in fresh medium was added to the cell culture every 2 days. After the plates were incubated for 10–15 days, they were photographed using a camera attached to an inverted microscope. Relative colony size was determined by measuring 10 random colonies in each slide (50 measurements/well). The mean for each treatment set was calculated and compared with controls. p42/p44 MAP kinase activity was measured by determining the transfer of the phosphate group of adenosine 5′-triphosphate to a peptide that is a highly specific substrate for p42/44 MAP kinase (Biotrak system, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For determination of Akt kinase activity we used the Akt kinase assay kit made by New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Serum-starved cells were treated with PGE2 and then lysed at the indicated times. Akt was immunoprecipitated using a monospecific Akt antibody. The immunoprecipitate was then incubated with a GSK-3 fusion protein in the presence of ATP. Phosphorylation of GSK-3 was measured by Western blotting using an anti-phospho-GSK-3α/β (Ser21/9) antibody. PI3K assays were performed as described by Jianget al. (20Jiang K. Coppola D. Crespo N.C. Nicosia S.V. Hamilton A.D. Sebti S.M. Cheng J.Q. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 139-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with anti-Tyr(P) antibody (4G10, Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY). The activity of PI3K in immunoprecipitates was determined by incubating the beads with reaction buffer (10 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 50 μm ATP, 20 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP, and 10 μg ofl-α-phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate) for 20 min at 25 °C. Phosphorylated products were separated by thin layer chromatography and visualized by autoradiography. LS-174 cells were grown in 35-mm tissue culture plates and fixed in methanol/acetone at −20 °C for 10 min. Fixed cells were incubated with 10% normal donkey serum for 1 h and then with anti-FAK or anti-paxillin antibody (Transduction Laboratories, Lexington, KY) for 2 h at room temperature. After washing the cells three times with PBS, they were incubated with Cy3-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, PA) for an additional 1 h. The cells were then washed with PBS, mounted, and observed under fluorescent microscopy with appropriate filters. For direct immunofluorescence, cells were fixed with formaldehyde-Triton solution and then incubated with 10 nm fluorescent phalloidin for 30 min. Cell migration and invasion assays were carried out using Transwell chambers (8 μm, Corning Costar Co., Cambridge, MA). 5 × 104 cells suspended in 400 μl of serum-free McCoy's 5A medium were placed in the uncoated (migration assay) or 1:10 diluted Matrigel®-coated (invasion assay) upper chamber. The lower chamber was filled with 1 ml of McCoy's 5A medium containing vehicle or 0.1 μm PGE2. After an incubation period of 20 h at 37 °C, the cells on the upper surface of the filter were removed with a cotton swab. The filters were fixed and stained with 0.5% crystal violet solution. Cells adhering to the undersurface of the filter were counted. Three independent experiments were carried out, and the data are expressed as the mean ± S.E. of assays performed in triplicate. RT-PCR was carried out using the RNA PCR kit from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. A set of specific PCR primers for EP receptor subtypes (GenBank™ accession numbers NM000955, NM0000956, NM000957, and NM000958 for EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4, respectively) have been designed as follows: EP1 fragment, forward (5′-ACCGACCTGGCGGGCCACGTGA-3′; 321–342) and reverse (5′-CGCTGAGCGTGTTGCACACCAG-3′; 750–729); EP2 fragment, forward (5′-TCCAATGACTCCCAGTCTGAGG-3′; 169–190) and reverse (5′-TGCATAGATGACAGGCAGCACG-3′; 642–621); EP3 fragment, forward (5′-GATCACCATGCTGCTCACTG-3′; 396–415) and reverse (5′-AGTTATGCGAAGAGCTAGTCC-3′; 904–884); EP4 fragment, forward (5′-GGGCTGGCTGTCACCGACCTG-3′; 565–585) and reverse (5′-GGTGCGGCGCATGAACTGGCG-3′; 1050–1030). One μg of total RNA was reverse-transcribed and amplified with 35 PCR cycles. The amplified products were visualized on 1.5% agarose gels. Constitutive expression of COX-2 has been reported in 85–90% of colorectal carcinomas (15Eberhart C.E. Coffey R.J. Radhika A. Giardiello F.M. Ferrenbach S. DuBois R.N. Gastroenterology. 1994; 107: 1183-1188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kargman S.L. O'Neill G.P. Vickers P.J. Evans J.F. Mancini J.A. Jothy S. Cancer Res. 1995; 55: 2556-2559PubMed Google Scholar). COX-2 is expressed in both carcinoma and stromal cells (21Chapple K.S. Cartwright E.J. Hawcroft G. Tisbury A. Bonifer C. Scott N. Windsor A.C.J. Guillou P.J. Markham A.F. Coletta P.L. Hull M.A. Am. J. Pathol. 2000; 156: 545-553Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar). Therefore, it is possible that carcinoma cells that do not express COX-2 could receive paracrine signals from PGE2 produced by neighboring stromal cells. In order to elucidate whether PGE2 might exert any effect on the phenotype of colon cancer cells, LS-174 human colon cancer cells were treated with PGE2. LS-174 cells do not generate detectable prostaglandins, although COX-2 protein is detected in this cell line (22Shao J. Sheng H. Inoue H. Morrow J.D. DuBois R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 33951-33956Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). LS-174 cells are able to form “crypt-like” aggregates when they are cultured in Matrigel®. We found that exogenously added PGE2 exerted a growth-stimulatory effect on LS-174 cells (Fig.1 A). The size of LS-174 colonies in Matrigel® increased following PGE2treatment in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1 B). Treatment with 10 nm PGE2 resulted in optimal stimulation of LS-174 cell growth, causing a 2-fold increase in colony diameter. To our surprise, treatment with PGE2 caused a dramatic change in the morphology of the LS-174 colonies. When grown in extracellular matrix components (Matrigel®), LS-174 cells formed well organized structures consisting of an outside layer of cells with an acellular center (Fig.2 A, panel a). Positive Alcian Blue staining indicated that the LS-174 colonies were filled with colonic type mucin (data not shown). In contrast, the LS-174 cells exposed to PGE2 formed irregular solid clumps of cells with a poorly organized structure (Fig.2 A, panel b). When grown on plastic culture dishes, LS-174 cells formed in “non-spreading” round clumps (Fig. 2 A, panel c). Addition of 10 nm PGE2 led to a rapid change in phenotype, which included increased spreading of cells within 2–4 h (Fig.2 A, panel d). Fluorescent staining with rhodamine-phalloidin demonstrated that PGE2 treatment for 24 h resulted in protruding actin filaments from the cell periphery in the form of microspikes (Fig. 2 B,panel b, white arrows) and an increase in the number of stress fibers (Fig. 2 B,panel b, black arrows). PGE2 treatment also increased focal adhesion complexes as determined by immunostaining for focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin. Normally, FAK and paxillin are localized to the cytoplasm in LS-174 cells (Fig. 2 B, panels c ande), but following PGE2 treatment the proteins accumulated into focal adhesions at the ends of actin stress fibers (Fig. 2 B, panels d and f,arrows). To further examine the spreading behavior induced by PGE2, we carried out experiments using a modified Boyden chamber. Treatment of cells with PGE2 resulted in a significant increase (2–3-fold) in cell motility (Fig.3 A). Addition of 0.1 μm PGE2 also promoted the movement of LS-174 cells through a Matrigel®-coated polycarbonate membrane by 2–3-fold (Fig. 3 B). Therefore, PGE2 altered the behavior of LS-174 cells by stimulating an increase in their motility, which could explain, in part, their change in cellular organization when grown as multicellular colonies. We next determined if LS-174 cells express EP receptors, which are known to bind PGE2 with a high affinity (reviewed in Ref. 23Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The expression of EP receptors in LS-174 cells was determined by RT-PCR using specific oligonucleotide primers. EP2, EP3, and EP4 were clearly expressed in LS-174 cells (Fig. 4 A), but mRNA for the EP1 receptor was barely detectable. To elucidate the functional role of EP receptor subtypes in LS-174 cells, we treated the cells with butaprost (1 μm, a selective EP2 receptor agonist), sulprostone (5 μm, a selective EP3 receptor agonist), and PGE1alcohol (10 nm, a selective EP4 receptor agonist). Treatment with butaprost or sulprostone did not cause significant changes in cell morphology (data not shown). However, treatment with the PGE1 alcohol (10 nm) resulted in more rapid and significant cell spreading when compared with the effect of PGE2 alone. Alterations in LS-174 cell spreading were seen within 1 h following addition of the PGE1 alcohol (Fig. 4 B). Thus, LS-174 cell spreading and migration, stimulated by PGE2, may be predominantly mediated through the EP4 signaling pathway. A number of signaling pathways is known to regulate cell growth and motility. The MAP kinase/ERK kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathways were evaluated following PGE2 treatment. Treatment of LS-174 cells with PGE2 (100 nm) only had a modest effect on the activity of ERK1/2. PGE2 treatment slightly increased the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 as determined by Western blotting analysis (Fig.5 A, upper panel). The results of an ERK kinase assay confirmed this finding (Fig. 5 A, lower panel). On the other hand, treatment with PGE2 led to a marked activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. The levels of phosphorylated (Ser-473) Akt/PKB were elevated following treatment with PGE2 in LS-174 cells (Fig. 5 B, upper panel). Kinase assays, which measure the capacity to phosphorylate GSK-3 kinase, demonstrated that Akt kinase activity was greatly increased following PGE2 treatment of LS-174 cells (Fig. 5 B, lower panel). It is known that Akt/PKB can be activated by G protein-coupled signaling in both a PI3K-dependent and -independent manner. Kinase assays failed to detect any PI3K activity in serum-starved LS-174 cells, and treatment with PGE2 resulted in rapid induction of PI3K activity, as determined by the conversion of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate to phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate (Fig. 5 C). To confirm the involvement of PI3K in PGE2 activation of Akt/PKB, we evaluated two inhibitors of this pathway (wortmannin (0.1 μm) and LY 294002 (10 μm)) and found that they both completely blocked PGE2-induced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB (Fig.5 D). To determine whether the activation of Akt/PKB by PGE2 altered the phenotype of LS-174 cells, the cells were treated with PGE2 in the presence of specific PI3K inhibitors, LY 294002 (5 μm) and wortmannin (0.1 μm). Both LY-294002 and wortmannin, at low concentrations, have been demonstrated to specifically target PI3K activity (24Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). LS-174 cells were grown on plastic dishes and subjected to serum deprivation for 48 h. The cells were then treated with PGE2 (0.1 μm) in the presence or absence of LY 294002 or wortmannin for 24 h. DNA synthesis was evaluated by [3H]thymidine incorporation assays. PGE2treatment resulted in a 70% increase in [3H]thymidine incorporation in LS-174 cells, and addition of 5 μm LY 294002 completely blocked the PGE2-induced increase in DNA synthesis. The presence of 0.1 μm wortmannin also abolished the PGE2 effect on DNA synthesis (Fig.6 A). Although inhibition of PI3K/Akt activity blocked PGE2-induced growth effects, LY 294002 and wortmannin (0.1 μm) also prevented the PGE2-induced cell spreading in LS-174 cells (Fig.6 B and data not shown). Next, we evaluated the role of PI3K/Akt activity on cell motility. Modified Boyden chamber assays demonstrated that PGE2 treatment resulted in a 2–2.5-fold increase in cell motility, and 5 μm LY 294002 or 0.1 μm wortmannin completely abolished this effect (Fig. 6,C and D). Since PGE2 treatment dramatically altered the growth and morphology of LS-174 colonies in Matrigel®, it was of interest to determine the effects of PI3K/Akt activity on LS-174 cells grown in Matrigel®. As demonstrated in Fig.7 A, LY 294002 impaired the ability of LS-174 cells to grow in Matrigel® whereas PGE2 significantly increased the size and altered the morphology of LS-174 colonies. Interestingly, addition of LY 294002 completely blocked the PGE2 effects on cells grown in Matrigel® by inhibiting colony growth and the invasive morphology. Wortmannin exerted similar effects but to a lesser degree on LS-174 cells grown in Matrigel® (Fig. 7 B and data not shown). It is now clear that COX-2 plays a role in the promotion of colorectal cancer (6Williams C.S. Mann M. DuBois R.N. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 7908-7916Crossref PubMed Scopus (1236) Google Scholar). However, the effects of prostaglandins generated by COX-2 have largely been unexplored. Here we provide evidence that prostaglandin-mediated signaling affects cell proliferation, motility, and morphogenesis and that activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is essential for the PGE2-induced changes in neoplastic potential. To evaluate the effect of prostaglandins on the behavior of colorectal carcinoma cells, we employed several approaches. Treatment with PGE2 stimulated DNA synthesis and cell spreading in LS-174 cells grown on plastic cultures. LS-174 cells form well differentiated multicellular colonies in Matrigel®, mimicking tumor growth in animals. Treatment of LS-174 colonies with PGE2led to a significant disruption of their cellular organization with increased motility. The stimulation of cell migration by PGE2 has been observed previously in mesangial, endothelial, and T cells (25Jaffer S. Mattana J. Singhal P.C. Am. J. Nephrol. 1995; 15: 300-305Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar, 26Leppert D. Hauser S.L. Kishiyama J.L. An S. Zeng L. Goetzl E.J.

Forced expression of COX-2 in colon carcinoma cells results in increased invasiveness compared with the parental cells (9Tsujii M. Sunao K. DuBois R.N. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 94: 3336-3340Crossref PubMed Scopus (1324) Google Scholar). These findings suggest that a prostaglandin product, such as PGE2, might stimulate cell motility and invasiveness under certain circumstances. In the present study, we show that addition of PGE2 to serum-deprived LS-174 cells results in increased cell spreading accompanied by polymerization of actin and assembly of stress fibers, indicating that PGE2induced cytoskeletal reorganization. A role for the actin cytoskeleton has been implicated in many cellular functions, including motility, chemotaxis, cell division, endocytosis, and secretion (28Devreotes P.N. Zigmond S.H. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1988; 4: 649-686Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar, 29Salmon E.D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1989; 1: 541-547Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 30Bretscher A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1991; 7: 337-374Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). Our data also demonstrate that PGE2 treatment caused aggregation of FAK and paxillin, promoting the formation of focal adhesion complexes, which are known to be essential for cell migration (31Chen P. Xie H. Sekar M.C. Gupta K. Wells A. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 127: 847-857Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar, 32Kundra V. Escobedo J.A. Kazlauskas A. Kim H.K. Rhee S.G. Williams L.T. Zetter B.R. Nature. 1994; 367: 474-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar). PGE2 acts via specific transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (EP receptors) (23Breyer M.D. Breyer R.M. Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. 2000; 9: 23-29Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Four EP receptor subtypes have been identified and are designated EP1, EP2, EP3, and EP4. EP1 signals via increased Ca2+, which leads to vasoconstriction. EP3 can also serve to stimulate vasoconstriction and inhibits the generation of cAMP, whereas EP2 and EP4 are known to mediate vasorelaxation by stimulating an increase in cAMP levels. Our results show that both sulprostone (EP3 agonist) and butaprost (EP2 agonist) (33Boie Y. Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M. Ungrin M.D. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G.P. Metters K.M. Abramovitz M.

However, both the PGE1 alcohol and misoprostol (relatively selective EP4 agonist, data not shown) (33Boie Y. Stocco R. Sawyer N. Slipetz D.M. Ungrin M.D. Neuschafer-Rube F. Puschel G.P. Metters K.M.

These findings suggest that signaling via the EP4 receptor is, at least in part, responsible for the PGE2-induced changes in LS-174 cell behavior. Evidence suggests that the PI3K/Akt pathway promotes growth factor-mediated cell survival and inhibits apoptosis (36Yao R. Cooper G.M. Science. 1995; 267: 2003-2006Crossref PubMed Scopus (1284) Google Scholar). PI3K/Akt also plays a key role in the regulation of cell adhesion and actin rearrangement (37Rodriguez-Viciana P.

These observations suggest that the PI3K/Akt pathway is oncogenic and involved in the neoplastic transformation of mammalian cells. PI3K can be activated by growth factors, oncogenes, and is involved in the transmission of signals from certain G protein-coupled receptors (39Franke T.F. Yang S.I. Chan T.O. Datta K. Kazlauskas A.

Akt/PKB may also be activated by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase in a wortmannin-insensitive manner (42Sable C.L. Filippa N. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. FEBS Lett. 1997; 409: 253-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar, 45Filippa N. Sable C.L. Filloux C. Hemmings B. Van Obberghen E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 4989-5000Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). Here, we found that treatment with PGE2 rapidly increased the kinase activity of Akt/PKB and that wortmannin and LY 294002 blocked PGE2-induced phosphorylation of Akt/PKB, suggesting the involvement of PI3K. Thus far, the mechanism by which prostaglandin activates Akt/PKB is not clear, and, to our knowledge, this represents the first report of Akt/PKB modulation by PGE2. However, we have not established a direct link between the EP receptor and PI3K activation in the present study. Our data further demonstrate the involvement of Akt/PKB activity in the PGE2-induced increase in cell proliferation and motility. LY 294002, at low concentrations (5–20 μm), specifically targets PI3K activity (24Vlahos C.J. Matter W.F. Hui K.Y. Brown R.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5241-5248Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The observation that both LY-294002 and wortmannin (structurally unrelated PI3K inhibitors) exerted similar effects on LS-174 cells indicates that PI3K is the likely target of these compounds (reviewed in Refs. 46Ward S.G. June C.H. Olive D. Immunol. Today. 1996; 17: 187-197Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar and 47Vanhaesebroeck B. Waterfield M.D. Exp. Cell Res. 1999; 253: 239-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (751) Google Scholar). We found that the growth of LS-174 cells (either on plasic or in Matrigel®) was significantly impaired by LY294002 (5 μm), suggesting that basal levels of PI3K/Akt activity are required for continuous growth of LS-174 cells. Specific inhibitors of PI3K that blocked the activation of Akt/PKB did inhibit PGE2-induced changes in cell behavior, suggesting that both PGE2-induced growth stimulation and cytoskeletal reorganization involve the activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Several studies demonstrated that Akt/PKB pathway plays an extremely important role in cell cycle progression via modifying the expression of cell cycle proteins, such as cyclin D1 and p27kip (48Gille H.

Activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway is thought to be essential for cytoskeletal reorganization under certain circumstances (37Rodriguez-Viciana P. Warne P.H. Khwaja A. Marte B.M. Pappin D. Das P. Waterfield M.D. Ridley A. Downward J. Cell. 1997; 89: 457-467Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (954) Google Scholar). These previous studies strongly support our findings that the PI3K/Akt activity is required for PGE2-induced increases in the growth and invasiveness of LS-174 cells. Although COX enzyme activity is proposed to play a pro-neoplastic role in colorectal carcinogenesis, the downstream signaling that mediates these effects is poorly understood. Our results demonstrate that PGE2 can induce significant phenotypic alterations in colorectal carcinoma cells. These changes include increased motility, changes in cell shape, and stimulation of cell growth. We found the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to be involved in the regulation of morphogenic and proliferative changes. This work establishes a role for PGE2 in the stimulation of tumor cell motility and reveals an additional cellular target, the EP4 receptor, which appears to be involved in this process."

The gene mutated in BS, BLM, encodes a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases. The precise role played by these enzymes in the cell remains to be determined. However, genome-wide hyper-recombination is a feature of many RecQ helicase-deficient cells. In eukaryotes, a central step in homologous recombination is catalyzed by the RAD51 protein. In response to agents that induce DNA double-strand breaks, RAD51 accumulates in nuclear foci that are thought to correspond to sites of recombinational repair. Here, we report that purified BLM and human RAD51 interact in vitroand in vivo, and that residues in the N- and C-terminal domains of BLM can independently mediate this interaction. Consistent with these observations, BLM localizes to a subset of RAD51 nuclear foci in normal human cells. Moreover, the number of BLM foci and the extent to which BLM and RAD51 foci co-localize increase in response to ionizing radiation. Nevertheless, the formation of RAD51 foci does not require functional BLM. Indeed, in untreated BS cells, an abnormally high proportion of the cells contain RAD51 nuclear foci. Exogenous expression of BLM markedly reduces the fraction of cells containing RAD51 foci. The interaction between BLM and RAD51 appears to have been evolutionarily conserved since the C-terminal domain of Sgs1, theSaccharomyces cerevisiae homologue of BLM, interacts with yeast Rad51. Furthermore, genetic analysis reveals that theSGS1 and RAD51 genes are epistatic indicating that they operate in a common pathway.

Bloom's syndrome glutathione S-transferase hydroxyurea homologous recombination methyl methanesulfonate sister chromatid exchange double-strand break polymerase chain reaction bromodeoxyuridine Germline mutations in the BLM gene give rise to Bloom's syndrome (BS),1 a rare disorder associated with stunted growth, facial sun sensitivity, immunodeficiency, fertility defects, and a greatly elevated increase in the occurrence of a wide range of cancers (1German J. Medicine. 1993; 72: 393-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). BLM encodes a 159-kDa protein that is a member of the RecQ family of DNA helicases (2Ellis N.A. Groden J. Ye T.Z. Straughen J. Lennon D.J. Ciocci S. Proytcheva M. German J. Cell. 1995; 83: 655-666Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1221) Google Scholar). This highly conserved family of proteins is required for the maintenance of genomic stability in all organisms (3Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). In humans, five RecQ helicases have been identified. In addition to BLM, mutations in two other genes encoding RecQ helicases in humans have been associated with disease conditions: WRN andRECQ4, being defective in Werner's syndrome and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, respectively (4Yu C. Oshima J. Fu Y. Wijsman E.M. Hisama F. Alisch R. Matthews S. Najura J. Miki T. Ouais S. Martin G.M. Mulligan J. Schellenberg G.D.

Genet. 1999; 22: 82-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar). Werner's syndrome is primarily associated with premature aging, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome with skin and skeletal abnormalities, but both disorders also give rise to an elevated incidence of cancers (6Shen J.C. Loeb L.A. Trends Genet. 2000; 16: 213-220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 7Vennos E.M. James W.D. Dermatol. Clin. 1995; 13: 143-150Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). All RecQ family members contain a catalytic helicase domain that comprises seven highly conserved motifs found in many DNA and RNA helicases (3Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Outside of this helicase domain, the RecQ family proteins show little sequence conservation. In BLM, these non-conserved domains are located both N- and C-terminal to the helicase domain and comprise ∼650 and 450 amino acids, respectively. It is likely that these non-conserved domains are important in functionally differentiating the roles of the different RecQ helicases within the cell by either providing additional enzymatic functions, such as the exonuclease activity dependent upon the N-terminal domain of WRN (8Huang S. Li B. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Mian I.S. Campisi J. Nat. Genet. 1998; 20: 114-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar, 9Shen J.C. Gray M.D. Oshima J. Kamath-Loeb A.S. Fry M. Loeb L.A. J. Biol.

Cells from BS patients display genomic instability, the diagnostic feature being an increase in the frequency of sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) (11German J. Crippa L.P. Bloom D. Chromosoma. 1974; 48: 361-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). Sonoda et al. (12Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Morrison C. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takata M. Takeda S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1999; 19: 5166-5169Crossref PubMed Scopus (368) Google Scholar) recently demonstrated that SCE formation requires homologous recombination (HR). Moreover, chicken BLM −/−cells display elevated SCE levels that are partially dependent onRAD54 (13Wang W. Seki M. Narita Y. Sonoda E. Takeda S. Yamada K. Masuko T. Katada T. Enomoto T. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 3428-3435Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). BLM therefore seems to function in the regulation of HR events during replication. Consistent with this notion, mutations in SGS1 orrqh1 + , the budding and fission yeast RecQ homologues, respectively, also give rise to excessive recombination events (14Gangloff S. McDonald J.P. Bendixen C. Arthur L. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 8391-8398Crossref PubMed Scopus (617) Google Scholar, 15Watt P.M. Hickson I.D. Borts R.H. Louis E.J.

In rqh1 mutants, inhibition of DNA replication, in particular, stimulates this excessive recombination (16Stewart E. Chapman C.R. Al-Khodairy F. Carr A.M. Enoch T. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 2682-2692Crossref PubMed Scopus (329) Google Scholar). Further evidence of a role for RecQ helicases in HR comes from the finding that RecQ, Sgs1, BLM, and WRN can all disrupt four-way junctions, a structural mimic for the Holliday junction intermediate formed during HR (17Harmon F.G. Kowalczykowski S.C. Genes Dev. 1998; 12: 1134-1144Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar, 18Bennett R.J. Keck J.L. Wang J.C. J. Mol.

EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). Moreover, both BLM and WRN can promote branch migration of Holliday junctions (19Karow J.K. Constantinou A. Li J.-L. West S.C. Hickson I.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 6504-6508Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar, 20Constantinou A. Tarsounas M. Karow J.K. Brosh R.M. Bohr V.A. Hickson I.D. West S.C. EMBO Rep. 2000; 1: 80-84Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar). The general mechanism for repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) by HR has been conserved in evolution. The central step involves the pairing of the DSB with homologous sequences to facilitate the exchange of DNA strands. In bacteria, this process is mediated by RecA, which forms a nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA formed as a result of exonucleolytic processing of the DSB to generate single-stranded DNA tails. This nucleoprotein filament facilitates the search for homologous sequences and provides a structure within which DNA strand exchange occurs. In eukaryotes, essentially the same reaction is performed by RAD51, which is structurally related to RecA (21Ogawa T., Yu, X. Shinohara A. Egelman E.H. Science. 1993; 259: 1896-1899Crossref PubMed Scopus (561) Google Scholar, 22Sung P. Science. 1994; 265: 1241-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (756) Google Scholar, 23Benson F.E. Stasiak A. West S.C.

In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the RAD51gene is a member of the RAD52 epistasis group, andrad51 mutants display defects in mitotic and meiotic recombination and sensitivity to ionizing radiation, highlighting the key role that RAD51 plays in both HR and recombinational repair of DNA strand breaks (25Paques F. Haber J.E. Microbiol. Mol. Biol. Rev. 1999; 63: 349-404Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Studies on RAD51 in higher eukaryotes have been hampered by the fact that mice with a targeted disruption of theRAD51 gene die early during embryogenesis (26Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar, 27Tsuzuki T. Fujii Y. Sakumi K. Tominaga Y. Nakao K. Sekiguchi M. Matsushiro A. Yoshimura Y. Morita T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 6236-62340Crossref PubMed Scopus (672) Google Scholar). However, studies with early mouse embryos suggest that loss of RAD51renders cells sensitive to ionizing radiation (26Lim D.S. Hasty P. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 7133-7143Crossref PubMed Scopus (628) Google Scholar). Additionally,RAD51 mutant chicken cells, maintained by expression of human RAD51 (hRAD51) under the control of a regulable promoter, accumulate chromosomal breaks following repression of hRAD51 synthesis (28Sonoda E. Sasaki M.S. Buerstedde J.M. Bezzubova O. Shinohara A. Ogawa H. Takata M. Yamaguchi-Iwai Y. Takeda S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 598-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (705) Google Scholar). This suggests a role for hRAD51 in the repair of DNA breaks in undamaged cycling cells, most likely those arising during DNA replication. Treatment of mammalian cells with agents that induce DSBs, such as ionizing radiation, induces localization of Rad51 to nuclear foci that are believed to correspond to multiprotein complexes engaged in recombinational repair (29Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). However, the precise composition of these recombinational repair centers is unknown. In this study, we have examined the possibility that the Bloom's syndrome gene product functions in the RAD51 recombinational repair pathway given the defects in recombination displayed by BS cells. BLM and hRAD51 were found to directly interact in vitro and co-immunoprecipitate from nuclear extracts. Consistent with these data, BLM forms nuclear foci, a subset of which, co-localize with hRAD51. Furthermore, the degree to which these two proteins co-localize to nuclear foci increases in response to ionizing radiation. The interaction between BLM and hRAD51 appears to have been evolutionarily conserved since Sgs1 physically associates with yeast RAD51, and genetic analysis reveals that the genes encoding these two proteins are epistatic. The SV40-transformed normal human fibroblast cell line, WI-38 (obtained from ATCC), was used as a representative normal human cell line. The GM08505 cell line is an SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line from a BS patient (obtained from NIGMS, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD) and contains a BLMhomozygous frameshift mutation at residue 739 resulting in premature truncation of the protein (2Ellis N.A.

The HeLa cDNA activation library in pJG45 was transformed into EGY48, which already contained pEG202/BLM (residues 966–1417) and pSH1834 using a modified method of Gietz et al. (32Gietz D. St. Jean A. Woods R.A. Schiestl R.H. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 1425Crossref PubMed Scopus (2899) Google Scholar). Transformants were selected for uracil, histidine, and tryptophan prototrophy on 2% glucose, before being replica-plated to 2% galactose, 1% raffinose plates containing 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal). Plasmids from β-galactosidase positive colonies were isolated and sequenced. Intracellular localization of BLM and hRAD51 was visualized using the methodologies described previously (10Wu L.

Quantitation of nuclear foci was determined from 100–200 cells for each treatment. For the detection of sites of DNA synthesis and hRAD51, cells grown on coverslips were incubated for 10 min at 37 °C in 150 μm BrdUrd, fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in 250 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) at 4 °C for 20 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 at 4 °C for 20 min, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline. Cells were blocked in phosphate-buffered saline containing 10% fetal calf serum for 15 min and then incubated for 1 h with anti-RAD51 antibodies and for 30 min with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (Dako). Incorporated BrdUrd was detected by a second fixation step of 20 min at 4 °C in 4% paraformaldehyde in 250 mm HEPES (pH 7.4) followed by a 15-min incubation in 8% paraformaldehyde in 250 mm HEPES (pH 7.4). Cells were then incubated in 4m HCl for 15 min at 37 °C followed by five washes in phosphate-buffered saline. Incorporated BrdUrd was immunolabeled using mouse monoclonal antibodies against BrdUrd and anti-mouse IgG conjugated with Cy3 (Sigma). DNA was visualized by Hoechst staining. Typically, nuclear extracts prepared from 108 cells were used for each immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (10Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S. Goulaouic H.

IHIC33 anti-serum was used to detect the presence of BLM using conventional Western blotting techniques. This technique was performed as described previously (10Wu L. Davies S.L. North P.S.

Bound hRAD51 was detected using anti-RAD51 antiserum. Serial dilutions of exponentially growing yeast cultures were spotted onto either YPD plates or YPD plates containing drug and incubated for 2–3 days at 30 °C. Alternatively, exponentially growing yeast cultures were diluted into pre-warmed YPD medium or YPD medium containing drug, and the cell number monitored, using a Coulter counter (Sysmex F-820), over a period of 6 h. Growth inhibition was determined by calculating the percentage difference in cell number between the culture in drug-containing medium versus the control culture in drug-free YPD. Experiments were performed a minimum of three times on two independent segregants of each strain. The helicase domain in BLM, in common with the human WRN and RECQ4 proteins, is flanked by relatively large N- and C-terminal domains (3Karow J.K. Wu L. Hickson I.D. Curr. Opin. Genet. Dev. 2000; 10: 32-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar) that are likely important in functionally distinguishing these larger members of the RecQ helicase family. To analyze the role of these domains in BLM, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen of a HeLa cDNA library using the C-terminal domain (residues 966–1417) of BLM as bait. One positive clone, isolated independently three times, was found to encode hRAD51. The interaction appeared specific since hRAD51 did not interact with two nonspecific control bait proteins (Fig. 1 A). Further mapping revealed that the C-terminal 150 amino acids of BLM (residues 1267–1417) were sufficient to mediate an interaction with hRAD51. Since only a fragment of BLM had been used in the two-hybrid screen, and interactions using this system could in principle be mediated by adaptor proteins, we used Far Western analysis with purified recombinant BLM and hRAD51 to determine if the full-length proteins were able to interact directly with each other. Far Western analysis revealed that the full-length proteins could interact (Figs.1 B and 2 B) and that the interaction was specific since hRAD51 did not interact with either of two control proteins used in this assay, GST and MBP (Fig. 1 C and data not shown). Using affinity-purified GST fusion peptides containing various portions of the C-terminal domain of BLM, the final 100 residues, representing amino acids 1317–1417 of BLM, were identified as being sufficient to mediate an interaction with hRAD51 (Fig. 1 C), thus providing independent confirmation of the location of the hRAD51 interaction domain on BLM identified by the yeast two-hybrid system (Fig. 1 A).Figure 2A portion of the N-terminal domain of BLM binds to hRAD51. A, Far Western analysis of full-length purified hRAD51 and a GST fusion peptide containing residues 1–212 of BLM (GST-BLM). Left panel is a Coomassie Blue-stained gel showing the purified GST-BLM fusion peptide alongside GST alone, as indicated on the left. Middle andright panels are the same proteins as shown in the left panel transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and then probed with hRAD51 (+) or buffer alone (−), as indicated above. The membranes were then Western-blotted for the presence of bound hRAD51 using an anti-hRAD51 antibody. B, Full-length BLM but not a fragment of BLM representing residues 213–1266 binds to hRAD51. Far Western analysis of hRAD51 against full-length purified recombinant BLM and BLM-NC.

Left panel shows a Western blot of an identical membrane using anti-BLM antibodies and indicates the relative amounts of each protein used. The positions of BLM and BLM-NC on the membranes are indicated on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To investigate the possibility of additional hRAD51 interaction domains on BLM, Far Western analysis was performed between hRAD51 and a GST fusion protein containing the first 212 amino acids of BLM. hRAD51 was also able to specifically interact with this protein (Fig.2 A), indicating that BLM contains at least two domains with which hRAD51 can independently associate with (Figs. 1 C and 2 A). In contrast to full-length BLM, a purified recombinant mutant protein, BLM-NC, which consists of residues 213–1266 of BLM and therefore lacks both the N- and C-terminal hRAD51 interaction domains on BLM, was unable to bind hRAD51. This suggests that no additional portions of BLM interact with hRAD51 (Fig. 2 B). In response to DNA DSBs generated by ionizing radiation, hRAD51 localizes to nuclear foci that are thought to correspond to sites of ongoing repair (TableI, part A) (29Haaf T. Golub E.I. Reddy G. Radding C.M. Ward D.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 2298-2302Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar). BLM also forms nuclear foci in undamaged normal cells (Table I, part A) that have been shown previously to correspond to PML nuclear bodies (33Ishov A.M. Sotnikov A.G. Negorev D. Vladimirova O.V.

In an asynchronous population of WI-38 cells, a human fibroblast cell line derived from a normal individual, the proportion of cells containing BLM foci and the average number of BLM foci/cell was found to increase in response to ionizing radiation (Table I, part A) (Fig.3). We therefore examined the possibility that BLM might co-localize with hRAD51 foci in response to ionizing radiation. In a population of unirradiated WI-38 cells, 16% of the cells contained a mean of 2.1 co-localizing BLM and hRAD51 foci/nucleus (Fig. 3 and Table I). Three hours after 10 Gy of γ-irradiation, these figures increased significantly such that 24% of the population contained a mean of 4.7 co-localizing BLM and hRAD51 foci/nucleus (Fig.3 and Table I, part B). By 6 h following irradiation, the proportion of cells containing BLM and hRAD51 co-localizing nuclear foci had declined to almost the level seen in the untreated population (18%). However, the mean number of co-localizing nuclear foci (3.4) was still significantly higher than that in the untreated control population (Table I, part B).Table IQuantitation of the proportion of cells containing BLM and hRAD51 foci in untreated, irradiated, or aphidicolin-treated WI-38 cells (A) and quantitation of nuclear foci containing both BLM and hRAD51 in untreated, irradiated, or aphidicolin-treated WI-38 cells (B)A.Untreatedγ-IrradiationAphidicolin3 h6 hCells containing BLM foci45%78%65%83%Cells containing hRAD51 foci22%93%94%93%Mean no. of BLM foci/cell4.4 (0–29)17.2 (0–48)6.5 (0–26)9.3 (0–22)Mean no. of hRAD51 foci/cell10.1 (0–38)27.2 (0–70)19.0 (0–60)11.7 (0–80)B.Untreatedγ-IrradiationAphidicolin3 h6 hNo. of BLM and hRAD51 co-localizing foci/cell084%76%82%59%1–515%15%13%38%>51%9%5%3%Mean no. of BLM and"
https://openalex.org/W1966832058,"A cDNA was isolated from rat small intestine by expression cloning which encodes a novel Na+-independent transporter for aromatic amino acids. When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, the encoded protein designated as TAT1 (T-type amino acid transporter 1) exhibited Na+-independent and low-affinity transport of aromatic amino acids such as tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine (Km values: ∼5 mm), consistent with the properties of classical amino acid transport system T. TAT1 accepted some variations of aromatic side chains because it interacted with amino acid-related compounds such as l-DOPA and 3-O-methyl-DOPA. Because TAT1 acceptedN-methyl- and N-acetyl-derivatives of aromatic amino acids but did not accept their methylesters, it is proposed that TAT1 recognizes amino acid substrates as anions. Consistent with this, TAT1 exhibited sequence similarity (∼30% identity at the amino acid level) to H+/monocarboxylate transporters. Distinct from H+/monocarboxylate transporters, however, TAT1 was not coupled with the H+ transport but it mediated an electroneutral facilitated diffusion. TAT1 mRNA was strongly expressed in intestine, placenta, and liver. In rat small intestine TAT1 immunoreactivity was detected in the basolateral membrane of the epithelial cells suggesting its role in the transepithelial transport of aromatic amino acids. The identification of the amino acid transporter with distinct structural and functional characteristics will not only facilitate the expansion of amino acid transporter families but also provide new insights into the mechanisms of substrate recognition of organic solute transporters.AB047324 A cDNA was isolated from rat small intestine by expression cloning which encodes a novel Na+-independent transporter for aromatic amino acids.

Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that transporters subserving system T would belong to a different family with distinct mechanisms of substrate recognition. In order to identify the transporter for system T, we have performed expression cloning. We have revealed that the system T transporter, in fact, does not belong to any of the already identified amino acid transporter families, but exhibits structural similarity to monocarboxylate transporters, which could explain the unique characteristics of system T in its substrate recognition.

A positive pool was sequentially subdivided and analyzed until single clone (TAT1)1 was identified. The cDNA was sequenced in both directions by the dye terminator cycle sequencing method (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). Xenopus oocytes were injected with 25 ng of TAT1 cRNA synthesized in vitro from the TAT1 cDNA in plasmid pZL1 (Life Technologies, Inc.) linearized with NotI. Three days after injection the uptake of14C-labeled amino acids was measured as described above in the regular uptake solution or Na+-free uptake solution in which NaCl in the regular uptake solution was replaced by choline chloride, containing 0.5–2.0 μCi/ml radiolabeled compounds. For Cl−-free uptake solution, Cl− in the Na+ uptake solution was replaced by gluconate anion. To prepare uptake solution with varied pH for pH dependence experiments, MES-NaOH (pH 5.5 and 6.0), PIPES-NaOH (pH 6.5 and 7.0), HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.5 and 8.0), and Tris-HCl (pH 8.5) were used for buffer systems (22Segawa H.

Preliminary experiments to determine the time course of [14C]l-tryptophan (1 mm) uptake into oocytes expressing TAT1 indicated that the uptake was linearly dependent on incubation time up to 10 min (data not shown), so for all the following experiments uptakes were measured for 10 min and the values were expressed as picomole/oocyte/min. Km and Vmax of amino acid substrates were determined using Eadie-Hofstee equation based on the TAT1-mediated amino acid uptakes measured at 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 6, and 10 mm. To measure the Ki values, TAT1-mediated transport of [14C]l-tryptophan was measured in the Na+-free uptake solution with varied concentration of [14C]l-tryptophan (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 6, and 10 mm) with or without addition of inhibitors. The Ki values were determined by double reciprocal plot analysis (23Apiwattanakul N. Sekine T. Chairoungdua A. Kanai Y. Nakajima N. Sophasan S. Endou H. Mol.

For the uptake and efflux measurements in the present study, six to nine oocytes were used for each data point. Each data point in the figures represents the mean ± S.E. of uptake (n = 6–9). To confirm the reproducibility of the results, three separate experiments using different batches of oocytes and in vitrotranscribed cRNA were performed for each measurement. Results from the representative experiments are shown in figures. For electrophysiological measurements, Xenopus oocytes were clamped at −60 mV by two electrode voltage camping using GeneClamp 500 (Axon Instruments) (15Kanai Y. Nussberger S. Romero M.F. Boron W.F.

The electric current induced by the bath-applied 1 mm l-tryptophan was monitored. Poly(A)+ RNA (3 μg/lane) isolated from rat tissues was separated on 1% agarose gel in the presence of 2.2 m formaldehyde and blotted onto a nitrocellulose filter (Schleicher & Schuell) (16Utsunomiya-Tate N.

The PstI fragment of TAT1 cDNA corresponding to 1274–2030 base pairs was labeled with 32P using T7 QuickPrime kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Hybridization was for 20 h at 42 °C in 50% formamide. The final stringent wash of the filter was in 0.1 × SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65 °C for 3 × 20 min (16Utsunomiya-Tate N. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol.

The C-terminal cysteine residue was introduced for conjugation with keyhole limpet hemocyanine. The anti-peptide antibodies were generated and affinity purified as described elsewhere (26Hisano S.

Small intestine epithelium membranes of male Harlan Sprague-Dawley rats were prepared as described elsewhere (24Fukasawa Y. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H.

Briefly, rat small intestine scrape was homogenized in 9 volumes of 0.3 m sucrose, 0.26 units/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mm tosyl-l-lysine chloromethyl ketone, and 0.1 mm tosyl-arginine chloromethyl ketone, with 10 strokes of a motor-driven Teflon-potter homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged for 10 min at 8,000 rpm, and the supernatant was centrifuged further for 20 min at 8,000 rpm. After filtration, the cytosol was centrifuged for 60 min at 45,000 rpm, and the membrane pellet was resuspended in 0.25 m sucrose, 100 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, and 50 mm Tris (pH 7.4). The protein samples were heated at 100 °C for 5 min in sample buffer in the presence of 5% 2-mercaptoethanol and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a Hybond-P polyvinylidene difluoride transfer membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and the membrane was treated with non-fat dried milk and diluted affinity purified anti-TAT1 antidody (1:500). The membrane was then treated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc). The signals were detected with an ECL plus system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) (24Fukasawa Y. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Matsuo H. Cha S.H. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol.

To verify the specificity of immunoreactions by absorption experiments, the membranes were treated with primary antibodies in the presence of antigen peptides (200 μg/ml) (27Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 28845-28848Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Three-micrometer paraffin sections of rat small intestine were processed for light microscopic immunohistochemical analysis as described previously (28Matsuo H. Tsukada S. Nakata T. Chairoungdua A.

For immunostaining, sections were incubated with affinity-purified anti-TAT1 antibody (1:1000) overnight at 4 °C. Thereafter, they were treated with Envision + rabbit peroxidase (DAKO) for 30 min. To detect immunoreactivity, the sections were treated with diaminobenzidine (0.8 mm) (27Chairoungdua A. Segawa H. Kim J.Y. Miyamoto K. Haga H. Fukui Y. Mizoguchi K. Ito H. Takeda E. Endou H. Kanai Y.

For absorption experiments, the tissue sections were treated with the primary antibodies in the presence of antigen peptides (200 μg/ml) (28Matsuo H. Tsukada S. Nakata T. Chairoungdua A. Kim D.K. Cha S.H. Inatomi J. Yorifuji H. Fukuda J. Endou H. Kanai Y. Neuroreport. 2000; 11: 3507-3511Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). The sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. When poly(A)+ RNA from rat small intestine was expressed in X. laevis oocytes, small but significant augmentation of [14C]l-tryptophan uptake was detected in the presence of excess of l-lysine.l-Lysine (5 mm) was added to the uptake solution to inhibit the transport activity of oocyte-endogenous transporters activated by rBAT and 4F2hc derived from small intestine poly(A)+ RNA (Fig. 1). The size fractionation of the small intestine poly(A)+ RNA revealed that the fraction of 2.2–2.6 kilobases exhibited the peak activity of [14C]l-tryptophan uptake (Fig.1). From this fraction, a cDNA library was constructed and screened for [14C]l-tryptophan uptake by expression inXenopus oocytes. A 2.5-kilobase cDNA was isolated which encodes a protein designated as TAT1 (T-type amino acid transporter 1). When expressed in Xenopus oocytes, TAT1 induced [14C]l-tryptophan transport which was not dependent on Na+ or Cl− in the medium (Fig.2, a and b). The uptake of [14C]l-tryptophan was saturable and followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics (Fig. 2 c) with aKm values of 3.72 ± 0.62 mm(mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments) for the [14C]l-tryptophan uptake. The substrate selectivity of TAT1 was investigated by inhibition experiments in which 10 μm[14C]l-tryptophan uptake was measured in the presence of 10 mm amino acids. The l-tryptophan uptake was highly inhibited by l-isomers of tyrosine and phenylalanine, whereas other l-amino acids did not inhibit TAT1-mediated [14C]l-tryptophan uptake (Fig.3 a). α-Aminoisobutyric acid, β-alanine, taurine, and γ-aminobutyric acid had no inhibitory effect on the TAT1-mediated uptake (data not shown).d-Isomers of tryptophan and phenylalanine exhibited small but significant inhibition on the TAT1-mediated uptake, whereasd-tyrosine did not inhibit TAT1-mediated uptake at 10 mm (Fig. 3 a). Classical inhibitors for amino acid transport systems, 2-aminobicyclo-(2,2,1)-heptane-2-carboxylic acid (for system L) and α-(aminomethyl)isobutyric acid (for system A), and substrates for H+/monocarboxylate transporters, lactate and pyruvate, did not inhibit TAT1-mediated uptake (Fig.3 b). Among amino acid-related compounds tested,l-DOPA (l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine) and 3-O-methyl-DOPA inhibited [14C]l-tryptophan uptake as strongly asl-phenylalanine (Fig. 3 c). Droxydopa exhibited a weaker inhibitory effect (Fig. 3 c). α-Methyl-DOPA, α-methyltyrosine, tyramine, and thyroid hormones, 3,3′,5-l-triiodothyronine and thyroxine, did not exhibit significant effects on TAT1-mediated [14C]l-tryptophan uptake (Fig.3 c). Consistent with the results from the inhibition experiments,14C-labeled l-tryptophan,l-tyrosine, and l-phenylalanine were transported by TAT1 (Fig. 4 a). Among d-amino acids, d-phenylalanine, for which a 14C-labeled compound was available, was confirmed to be transported by TAT1 (Fig. 4 a). [14C]Lactate and [14C]pyruvate were not transported by TAT1 (Fig.4 a). [14C]l-DOPA was shown to be transported by TAT1 whereas thyroid hormones, 3,3′,5-l-triiodothyronine and thyroxine, were not substrates of TAT1 (Fig. 4 b). Kinetic parameters of the amino acid substrates are listed in TableI.Table IKinetic parameters of amino acid substratesAmino acidKm 1-aKm andVmax values were determined as described under “EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES”.

Open table in a new tab As shown in Fig. 5 a,N-methyl- and N-acetyl-derivatives of aromatic amino acid substrates exhibited inhibitory effects on the TAT1-mediated uptake, whereas the methylesters did not inhibit TAT1-mediated [14C]l-tryptophan uptake. The inhibition of [14C]l-tryptophan uptake byN-methyl-l-tryptophan was shown to be competitive in a double reciprocal plot analysis with aKi value of 3.1 mm while that forl-tryptophan measured in the same procedure was 1.9 mm (Fig. 5 b).N-Acetyl-l-tryptophan also competitively inhibited l-tryptophan uptake with a Kivalue of 1.5 mm (data not shown). The effect of pH on TAT1-mediated [14C]l-tryptophan transport was examined by varying the pH of the uptake solution. As shown in Fig.6, the [14C]l-tryptophan uptake did not show any remarkable pH dependence within the pH range of 5.5 to 8.5. In order to determine whether TAT1 is an exchanger or a facilitated transporter, the efflux of radioactivity from the oocytes preloaded with [14C]l-tryptophan was measured in the absence or presence of extracellular l-tryptophan. As shown in Fig. 7, time-dependent efflux of radioactivity was detected from the oocytes expressing TAT1, which was not affected by the presence or absence ofl-tryptophan (1 mm) in the extracellular medium. In contrast, only a low level of efflux of preloaded [14C]l-tryptophan was detected from the control oocytes injected with water instead of TAT1 cRNA (Fig. 7). The transport mediated by TAT1 was electroneutral. The application of 1 mm l-tryptophan to the Xenopusoocytes clamped at −60 mV did not induce significant current, whereas 13.7 ± 0.9 pmol/min (mean ± S.E., n = 8) of [14C]l-tryptophan uptake was detected by 1 mm l-tryptophan in the same batch of oocytes expressing TAT1. The TAT1 cDNA (2,540 base pairs) contains a single open reading frame encoding a putative 514-amino acid protein (Fig.8). The start of the coding sequence was defined by the first ATG downstream of the in-frame stop codon and the surrounding sequences (CGGGCTATGG) corresponding to the Kozak consensus translation initiation sequence (29Kozak M. J. Cell Biol. 1991; 115: 887-903Crossref PubMed Scopus (1451) Google Scholar). The cDNA includes a poly(A) tail (59 As) which starts 20 nucleotides downstream from a typical polyadenylation signal AATAAA at nucleotide 2,462. As shown in Fig. 8, 12 transmembrane regions were predicted on the TAT1 amino acid sequence. A leucine-zipper motif was found at residues 363–384 on the predicted 9th transmembrane domain (Fig. 8). The search of protein data bases (August 2000) revealed that TAT1 sequence is novel and exhibits relatively low but significant similarity to those of mammalian H+/monocarboxylate transporters MCT1–4 (31–33% identity) (30Halestrap A.P. Price N.T. Biochem. J. 1999; 343: 281-299Crossref PubMed Scopus (1100) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). It was further revealed that TAT1 is homologous to the XPCT (X-linked PEST-containing transporter) protein whose function is not identified (49% identity) (31Lafreniere R.G. Carrel L. Willard H.F. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1994; 3: 1133-1139Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 32Debrand E. Heard E. Avner P. Genomics. 1998; 48: 296-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8). The Northern blot indicated that the 2.6-kilobase TAT1 message was expressed at high level in jejunum, ileum, colon, and placenta, and at lower level in liver (Fig. 9). On longer exposure, faint messages were also detected in lung, heart, and spleen. In jejunum, ileum, colon, and liver, an additional 7.8-kilobase message was also detected (Fig. 9). In Western blot analysis, the antibody raised against TAT1 recognized a single band of 70 kDa in the membrane fraction prepared from rat small intestine epithelium scrape, consistent with the predicted molecular mass of TAT1 protein (56 kDa) (Fig.10). The band disappeared in the presence of antigen peptides in the absorption experiment, confirming the specificity of immunoreactions (Fig. 10). Immunohistochemical analysis on rat small intestine revealed that the TAT1 protein is present in the epithelial cells (Fig.11 a). The transporter protein was abundant at the tip of the villus and the amount decreased from the tip of the villus to its base (Fig. 11 a). In the epithelial c"

Based on an extensive screening of diverse chemical agents on induction of intracellular production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), we found that the cyclopentenone PGs, such as PGA2, PGJ2, Δ12-PGJ2, and 15-deoxy-Δ12,14-PGJ2, showed the most potent pro-oxidant effect on SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. As the intracellular events that mediate the PG cytotoxicity, we observed (i) the cellular redox alteration represented by depletion of antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione and glutathione peroxidase; (ii) a transient decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψ); (iii) the production of protein-bound lipid peroxidation products, such as acrolein and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal; and (iv) the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins. These events correlated well with the reduction in cell viability. In addition, the thiol compound,N-acetylcysteine, could significantly inhibit the PG-induced ROS production, thereby preventing cytotoxicity, suggesting that the redox alteration is closely related to the pro-oxidant effect of cyclopentenone PGs. More strikingly, the lipid peroxidation end products, acrolein and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, detected in the PG-treated cells potently induced the ROS production, which was accompanied by the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and cell death, suggesting that the membrane lipid peroxidation products may represent one of the causative factors that potentiate the cytotoxic effect of cyclopentenone PGs by accelerating intracellular oxidative stress. These data suggest that the intracellular oxidative stress, represented by ROS production/lipid peroxidation and redox alteration, may underlie the well documented biological effects, such as antiproliferative and antitumor activities, of cyclopentenone PGs."

The zot product seems to be involved in the CTXΦ morphogenesis because Zot mutagenesis studies demonstrated the inability of CTX elements to be self-transmissible under appropriate conditions (5Waldor M.K. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar). The high concurrence among V. cholerae strains of the zot gene and the ctxgenes (11Johnson J.A. Morris J.G.

Lett. 1993; 106: 143-145Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) also suggests a possible synergistic role of Zot in the causation of acute dehydrating diarrhea typical of cholera. The recently completed genomic sequence of V. choleare El Tor N16961 revealed that the CTXΦ filamentous phage is integrated in one of the two circular chromosomes of the bacterium (13Heidelberg J.F.

Beside its role in phage morphogenesis, Zot also increases the permeability of the small intestine by affecting the structure of the intercellular tight junctions (tj) (1Fasano A. Baudry B. Pumplin D.W. Wasserman S.S. Tall B.D. Ketley J. Kaper J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5242-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). This effect was initially described on rabbit ileal tissues mounted in Ussing chambers by using filtered supernatants from V. cholerae O1 strains, suggesting that Zot is secreted (1Fasano A.

Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 428-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zot also possesses a cell specificity related to the toxin interaction with a specific receptor whose surface expression differs on various cells (15Fasano A. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Uzzau S. Kaper J.B. Margaretten K. Ding X. Guandalini S. Comstock L. Goldblum S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 16Fasano A. Uzzau S. Fiore C. Margaretten K.

Lett. 2001; 194: 1-5Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Zot induces modifications of cytoskeletal organization that lead to the opening of tj secondary to the transmembrane phospholipase C and subsequent protein kinase Cα-dependent polymerization of actin filaments strategically localized to regulate the paracellular pathway (15Fasano A. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Uzzau S. Kaper J.B. Margaretten K. Ding X. Guandalini S. Comstock L. Goldblum S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). Furthermore, in vivo experiments suggested that the effect of Zot on tj might lead to intestinal secretion after the permeation of the intercellular space (16Fasano A. Uzzau S. Fiore C. Margaretten K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 839-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). This modulation is reversible, time- and dose-dependent, and confined to the small intestine because Zot does not affect colon permeability (1Fasano A. Baudry B. Pumplin D.W. Wasserman S.S. Tall B.D.

Furthermore, the number of Zot receptors seems to decrease along the intestinal villous axis (16Fasano A. Uzzau S. Fiore C. Margaretten K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 839-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). To clarify the Zot bifunctional activity, we analyzed the structure-function properties of the toxin by constructing a series of deletion mutants that were tested for their ability to both modulate tj and bind to the Zot/zonulin receptor (18Lu R. Wang W. Uzzau S. Vigorito R. Zielke H.R. Fasano A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). The results provide evidence that the active domain responsible for Zot enterotoxic activity resides toward the carboxyl-terminal region of the toxin. In-frame deletion derivatives of the zot gene were obtained by using polymerase chain reaction techniques (TableI). To develop deletions of the Zot carboxyl or amino terminus, several oligonucleotides were designed to amplify various portions of the 5′ and 3′ ends of the zotgene (Table II). The zot gene was cloned in plasmid vector pQE30 (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA), which provides high-level expression in Escherichia coli of proteins containing a 6-histidine (6xHis) affinity tag at their amino terminus. The His tag allows a one-step method for protein purification using the Nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin capture column. To obtain Zot internal in-frame deletions (ΔE and ΔC clones), pSU113 (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) was subjected to enzymatic digestion (StuI andHindIII). The right end of Zot was replaced with polymerase chain reaction products obtained by using F7/F2 and F11/F2 primers pairs, respectively, that were subsequently re-ligated. Oligonucleotides were designed to introduce restriction sites needed for cloning procedures (Table II). Amplification products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and purified from salts and free nucleotides (Qiaquick polymerase chain reaction purification kit; Qiagen, Inc.). The fidelity of polymerase chain reaction amplifications was confirmed by DNA sequencing of the plasmid inserts (ABI PRISM 373; Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).Table IBacterial strains and plasmid vectors (top) and schematic description of Zot deletion mutants (bottom) Open table in a new tab Table IIPrimer sequences* Sequences with restriction sites (underlined) of F2, F8 (HindIII), S2, F71, F28, F205, F141 (BamHI), F46, F92 (KpnI).

Sequences corresponding to zot sequences are initalics. The QuickChangeTMSite-directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene, Kingsport, TN) was used to develop point mutations in pSU129 hosted in the DH5α/His-ΔG strain. These mutations resulted in the substitution of either the glycine (G) in position 291 with a valine (V) (DH5α/His-ΔG291) or the glycine in position 298 with a valine (DH5α/His-ΔG298). The oligonucleotides used to obtain the two site-directed derivatives are listed in Table II. Thezot gene, its seven deletion mutants, and its point mutated constructs were each inserted into the pQE30 vector to add a 6xHis tag on the amino terminus of each protein. E. coliDH5α was then transformed with the plasmids listed in Table I. The clones obtained were grown in Luria Bertani LB medium with 20 g/liter glucose, 25 mg/liter kanamycin, and 200 mg/liter ampicillin at 37 °C with vigorous mixing until A 600 reached 0.7–0.9. Cultures were then induced with 2 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (Fisher), followed by an additional 2-h culture incubation at 37 °C with vigorous shaking. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4,000 × g for 20 min and resuspended in buffer A (6m guanidine-HCl, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 8.0; 5 ml/g wet weight). After stirring for 1 h at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. A 50% slurry of Superflow (Qiagen, Inc.; 1 ml/g wet weight) was added to the supernatant and stirred for 1 h at room temperature. The mixture was loaded onto a 5 × 1.5-cm nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid resin column and washed sequentially with buffer A and buffer B (8m urea, 0.1 m sodium phosphate, and 0.01m Tris-HCl, pH 8). Each wash step was continued until theA 280 of the flow-through was less than 0.01. The proteins that bound to the column were eluted by the addition of 250 mm imidazole in buffer C (8 m urea, 0.1m sodium phosphate, and 0.01 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.3), stirred with a 50% slurry of Superflow (1 ml/g wet weight) for 2 h at room temperature, loaded onto another 5 × 1.5-cm nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and eluted with 250 mm imidazole in PBS. Purity of the His-proteins was established by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis followed by Coomassie Blue staining and Western immunoblotting using polyclonal anti-Zot antibodies (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Adult male New Zealand White rabbits (2–3 kg) were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Segments of rabbit small intestine were removed, rinsed free of the intestinal content, opened along the mesenteric border, and stripped of muscular and serosal layers. Eight sheets of mucosa thus prepared were then mounted in Lucite Ussing Chambers (1.12 cm2 opening) connected to a voltage clamp apparatus (EVC 4000; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) and bathed with freshly prepared buffer containing 53 mm NaCl, 5 mm KCl, 30.5 mm Na2SO4, 30.5 mmmannitol, 1.69 mm Na2HPO4, 0.3 mm NaH2PO4, 1.25 mmCaCl2, 1.1 mm MgCl2, and 25 mm NaHCO3. The bathing solution was maintained at 37 °C with water jacketed reservoirs connected to a constant temperature circulating pump and gassed with 95% O2/5% CO2. Potential difference (PD) was measured, and short-circuit current (ISC) and tissue resistance (Rt) were calculated as described previously (1Fasano A. Baudry B. Pumplin D.W. Wasserman S.S. Tall B.D. Ketley J. Kaper J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5242-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Purified Zot (1 × 10−10m) and the seven purified Zot deletion mutant proteins (1 × 10−10m) were added to the mucosal side of each chamber. Intestinal tissues exposed to PBS were used as a negative control. Only tissues that, at the end of the experiment, showed an increase in ISC in response to the mucosal addition of glucose (confirming tissue viability) were included in the analysis. In selected experiments, tissues were exposed to the point mutation proteins (1 × 10−10m) derived from the ΔG clone (Table I), and the assay was conducted as described above. IEC6 cells derived from crypt cells of germ-free rat small intestine (20Quaroni A. May R.J. Meth. Cell Biol. 1980; 21: 403-427Crossref Scopus (140) Google Scholar) were grown in cell culture flasks (Corning Costar Co., Cambridge, MA) at 37 °C in an atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO2. The complete medium consisted of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium with 4.5 g/liter glucose, containing 5% irradiated fetal bovine serum, 10 μg/ml insulin, 4 mml-glutamine, 50 units/ml penicillin, and 50 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells passage number varied between 15 and 20. IEC6 cells were grown in 8-chamber slides (1 × 105 cells/chamber). The monolayers were exposed to either 1 × 10−10m Zot or an equimolar amount of each of its deletion mutants and incubated for 30 min at 4 °C. IEC6 cells exposed to PBS were used as a negative control. After washing with PBS (pH 7.4), the cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min at room temperature and then permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma) in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) for 10 min at room temperature. The cells were then washed with PBS and blocked with 0.1% bovine serum albumin for 45 min at room temperature. Primary rabbit polyclonal anti-Zot antibodies (1:500) (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) were then added, and the monolayers were incubated overnight at 4 °C. After washing with PBS, the cells were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with anti-rabbit IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated antibodies (Sigma) (1:100). Finally, the cells were washed with PBS and stained in red using Evans Blue Counterstain (Sigma) in phosphate buffer (1:1000) for 10 min at room temperature. The staining procedure was used to better visualize the binding particles (stained in green by the IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate secondary antibodies) that appeared on a red background as fine yellow granules. The wells were washed with PBS, the coverslips were mounted with glycerol-PBS (1:1), pH 8, and then the cells were blindly analyzed by two independent observers with a fluorescence microscope (Optiplot; Nikon Inc., Melville, NY). In selected experiments, the IEC6 cells were incubated with the point mutation proteins (1 × 10−10m) derived from the ΔG clone listed in Table I, and the binding assay was conducted as described above. All values are the means ± S.E. The analysis of differences was performed by t test for either paired or unpaired varieties. p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. To identify the Zot region(s) involved in both the toxin's permeating effect and its engagement to the target receptor, seven deletion mutants were generated. Each mutant showed the predicted M ras established by both SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis (Fig. 1 A) and Western immunoblotting (Fig. 1 B). Gene sequencing of these constructs confirmed their correct design (data not shown). To identify the Zot domain(s) responsible for the enterotoxic activity, equimolar amounts of bacterial-expressed, purified His-Zot and its deletion mutants were each tested on rabbit small intestine mounted in Ussing chambers. The ability of the seven Zot mutants to affect the tj competency was analyzed by measuring the changes in Rt induced by a 90-min incubation with each deleted construct as compared with the effect obtained with wild-type His-Zot (positive control) and PBS (negative control). As shown in Fig.2 A, Rt reduction induced by His-ΔB and His-ΔC proteins was almost indistinguishable from that induced by His-Zot and was significantly different compared with the negative control. A significant Rt drop was also observed when tissues were exposed to His-ΔG, whereas no significant changes were detected after tissue incubation with His-ΔD, His-ΔE, His-ΔF, and His-ΔH (Fig. 2 A). These results suggest that the domain responsible for the Zot permeating effect on tj is located toward the protein's carboxyl-terminal section (Fig. 2 B). To identify the Zot domain(s) that specifically binds to the Zot/zonulin surface cell receptor, IEC6 cell monolayers were exposed to the same purified proteins tested in Ussing chambers. The ability of each deleted Zot derivative to bind to IEC6 cells (Fig.3, B–H) was evaluated using fluorescence microscopy and compared with the binding observed with both wild-type His-Zot (Fig. 3 A) and the PBS negative control (Fig. 3 I). Cells incubated with His-ΔG (Fig.3 G) showed an amount of binding particles similar to that seen in cells incubated with His-Zot (Fig. 3 A). The number of fluorescent particles was only minimally decreased in cells incubated with His-ΔB (Fig. 3 B), His-ΔC (Fig.3 C), or His-ΔD (Fig. 3 D). In contrast, binding capability was completely lost by His-ΔE (Fig. 3 E), His-ΔF (Fig. 3 F), and His-ΔH (Fig. 3 H) mutants. Analysis of these results revealed that the Zot region corresponding to AA residues 265–301 was partially (His-ΔE and His-ΔH) or completely (His-ΔF) deleted in the binding-negative mutants, whereas it was spared in the binding-positive constructs (Fig.3 J), suggesting that this region may represent the putative Zot domain involved in receptor binding function. We have recently demonstrated that Zot localizes in the V. cholerae outer membrane, to which it is anchored through its single spanning domain (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The molecule then undergoes to a cleavage that leads to the formation of a ∼33-kDa amino-terminal fragment that remains associated to the microorganism and a ≥12-kDa carboxyl-terminal peptide that supposedly is secreted in the host intestinal lumen milieu (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Based on the Ussing chamber assay results and the binding experiments of the Zot deletion mutants reported above, it is conceivable to hypothesize that this secreted fragment engages to the zonulin receptor and, consequently, causes tj disassembly. Comparison of the amino termini of the secreted Zot fragment (AA residues 288–399) and its eukaryotic analogue zonulin (21Wang W. Uzzau S. Goldblum S.E. Fasano A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4435-4440PubMed Google Scholar) revealed an 8- amino acid shared motif (Table III, shaded area) that encompasses the 265–301-AA region identified by the binding experiments described above as the putative binding domain.Table IIIComparison of the amino-terminal sequences of human intestinal zonulin and ZotThe shaded amino acids (Zot AA residues 291–298, zonulin AA residues 8–15) represent the putative Zot/zonulins receptor-binding site characterized by the following shared motif: non-polar (G), variable, non-polar, variable, non-polar (V), polar (Q), variable, non-polar (G). Open table in a new tab The shaded amino acids (Zot AA residues 291–298, zonulin AA residues 8–15) represent the putative Zot/zonulins receptor-binding site characterized by the following shared motif: non-polar (G), variable, non-polar, variable, non-polar (V), polar (Q), variable, non-polar (G). Both zonulin and Zot domains revealed a motif in which 4 of the 8 amino acid residues were identical (GXXXVQXG). To confirm that this motif is involved in target receptor engagement, a synthetic octapeptide (GGVLVQPG containing the shared motif) named FZI/0 (see Table III) was engineered and tested on ileal tissue mounted in Ussing chambers either alone or in combination with Zot or zonulin. No changes in Rt in tissues exposed to either FZI/0 or to a scrambled peptide were observed (Fig. 4). Treatment of the ileal tissue preparations with FZI/0 before and throughout the study period prevented Rt changes in response to both Zot and zonulin, whereas the permeating effect of the two proteins was unaffected by pretreatment with the scrambled peptide (Fig. 4). These data suggest that Zot and zonulin bind to the same receptor through a common binding motif (shaded in Table III) localized at the amino termini of both molecules. To establish the structure requirements to engage the target zonulin receptor, two His-ΔG site-directed mutants within the putative binding motif were engineered and tested for both their binding capability on IEC6 cells and their biological activity in Ussing chambers. IEC6 cells incubated with His-ΔG 291 (in which the G in position 291 was substituted with V) showed a reduced number of binding particles (Fig.5 A, 3) as compared with cells incubated with His-ΔG (Fig. 5 A, 2), whereas no binding was observed on cells incubated with His-ΔG 298 (G298V) mutant (Fig.5 A, 4). Biological assays in Ussing chambers showed that His-ΔG291 had a residual but not significant effect on tj disassembly (Fig. 5 B). The permeating effect was completely ablated when the intestinal tissues were incubated with His-ΔG 298 (Fig.5 B). These results paralleled the effects obtained with these two mutants in the binding assay and confirmed that the G in position 298 plays a crucial role in the capability of His-ΔG to bind to its target receptor, and, consequently, its substitution ameliorated the ligand biological effect on tj.Figure 5Effect of the two His-ΔG site-directed mutants (His-ΔG291 and His-ΔG298) on receptor binding and tj disassembly. A, binding assay. Experiments were performed as described in the Fig. 3 legend. IEC6 cell monolayers incubated with His-ΔG291 showed binding particles (3) similar to those detected in His-ΔG-exposed monolayers (2), whereas no binding was detected in monolayers exposed to His-ΔG298 (4). Negative PBS control (1) is shown for comparison. B, Ussing chamber assay. The tissue was treated with 1 × 10−10m of each protein, and Rt change was compared with that in PBS-exposed tissues. His-ΔG291 induced a partial but not a significant reduction in Rt when compared with the changes induced by His-ΔG. The permeating effect was completely ablated when the rabbit ileum was exposed to His-ΔG298.

This cluster of genes has been recently described as part of a filamentous phage (CTXΦ) that lives in symbiosis with its bacterial host. It has been reported previously that Zot is involved in both CTXΦ morphogenesis (5Waldor M.K. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar) and disassembly of the host intestinal intercellular tj (1Fasano A. Baudry B. Pumplin D.W. Wasserman S.S. Tall B.D.

The study of the subcellular localization of Zot by affinity-purified anti-Zot antibodies (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) revealed that Zot localizes in the V. cholerae outer membrane with a molecular mass of ∼45 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted primary translation product from the first methionine of Zot (44.8 kDa) (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). A second immunoreactive molecule, corresponding to the 33-kDa amino-terminal region of Zot, was also detected at the outer membrane site (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Both molecules are exposed at the bacterial cell surface (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). The 33-kDa Zot processing product is generated by a cleavage site at AA residue 287 (19Uzzau S. Cappuccinelli P. Fasano A. Microb. Pathog. 1999; 27: 377-385Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). This 33-kDa fragment remains associated to the bacterial membrane, whereas the carboxyl-terminal fragment of 12 kDa is excreted in the intestinal host milieu and is probably responsible for the biological effect of the toxin on intestinal tj. This toxin processing would explain the apparently contrasting results obtained when Zot was originally described (1Fasano A. Baudry B. Pumplin D.W. Wasserman S.S. Tall B.D. Ketley J. Kaper J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5242-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Indeed, despite the predicted toxin molecular mass (44.8 kDa) (14Baudry B. Fasano A. Ketley J. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 428-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), its biological effect on tj was found confined to the <30-kDa V. cholerae culture supernatant fraction (1Fasano A. Baudry B. Pumplin D.W. Wasserman S.S. Tall B.D. Ketley J. Kaper J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5242-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). The importance of the carboxyl-terminal fragment of Zot for its action on tj is further supported by the observation that TnphoA insertions located at the Zot carboxyl-terminal region abolished the enterotoxic activity (14Baudry B. Fasano A. Ketley J. Kaper J.B. Infect. Immun. 1992; 60: 428-434Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, these data suggest that Zot has a dual function: whereas its ∼33-kDa amino-terminal portion is possibly involved in CTXΦ phage assembly (5Waldor M.K. Mekalanos J.J. Science. 1996; 272: 1910-1914Crossref PubMed Scopus (1351) Google Scholar, 9Koonin E.V. FEBS Lett. 1992; 321: 3-6Crossref Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 10Horabin J.I. Webster R.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1986; 188: 403-413Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), the ∼12-kDa carboxyl-terminal fragment of the toxin seems to be responsible for the permeating action on intestinal tj. Several microorganisms have been shown to exert a cytophatic, pathological effect on epithelial cells that involves the cytoskeletal structure and the tj function in an irreversible manner. These bacteria alter the intestinal permeability either directly (i.e.enteropathogenic E. coli) or through the elaboration of toxins (i.e. Clostridium difficile andBacteroides fragilis) (24Sears C.L. Guerrant R.L. Kaper J.B. Blaser M.J. Smith P.D. Ravdin J.I. Greenberg H.B. Guerrant R.L. Infection of the Gastrointestinal Tract. Raven Press, New York1995: 617-634Google Scholar). A more physiological mechanism of regulation of tj permeability has been proposed for Zot (1Fasano A. Baudry B. Pumplin D.W. Wasserman S.S. Tall B.D. Ketley J. Kaper J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5242-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). Zot activates a complex intracellular cascade of events that involve a dose- and time-dependent protein kinase Cα-related polymerization of actin filaments strategically localized to regulate the paracellular pathway (15Fasano A. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Uzzau S. Kaper J.B. Margaretten K. Ding X. Guandalini S. Comstock L. Goldblum S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar). These changes are a prerequisite to the opening of tj and are evident at a toxin concentration as low as 1.1 × 10−13m (16Fasano A. Uzzau S. Fiore C. Margaretten K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 839-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The toxin exerts its effect by interacting with a specific surface receptor that is present on mature cells of small intestinal villi, but not in the colon (1Fasano A. Baudry B. Pumplin D.W. Wasserman S.S. Tall B.D. Ketley J. Kaper J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5242-5246Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar, 16Fasano A. Uzzau S. Fiore C. Margaretten K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 839-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). The regional distribution of Zot receptor(s) coincides with the different permeating effect of the toxin on the various tracts of intestine tested (16Fasano A. Uzzau S. Fiore C. Margaretten K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 839-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Our previous results showed that Zot regulates tj in a rapid, reversible, and reproducible fashion and probably activates intracellular signals operative during the physiologic modulation of the paracellular pathway (15Fasano A. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Uzzau S. Kaper J.B. Margaretten K. Ding X. Guandalini S. Comstock L. Goldblum S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar, 16Fasano A. Uzzau S. Fiore C. Margaretten K. Gastroenterology. 1997; 112: 839-846Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Based on the complexity of the intracellular signaling activated by Zot leading to the tj disassembly (15Fasano A. Fiorentini C. Donelli G. Uzzau S. Kaper J.B. Margaretten K. Ding X. Guandalini S. Comstock L. Goldblum S.E. J. Clin. Invest. 1995; 96: 710-720Crossref PubMed Scopus (300) Google Scholar), we postulated that Zot may mimic the effect of a functionally and immunologically related endogenous modulator of epithelial tj. The combination of affinity-purified anti-Zot antibodies and the Ussing chamber assay allowed us to identify an intestinal Zot analogue that we named zonulin (21Wang W. Uzzau S. Goldblum S.E. Fasano A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4435-4440PubMed Google Scholar). When zonulin was studied in a nonhuman primate model, it reversibly opened intestinal tj after engagement to the same receptor activated by Zot and therefore acts with the same effector mechanism described for the toxin (21Wang W. Uzzau S. Goldblum S.E. Fasano A. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4435-4440PubMed Google Scholar). Structure analysis of the zonulin amino terminus and the Zot active fragment identified in this study revealed a shared motif between these two molecules (Table III). Our binding experiments with Zot deletion mutants demonstrated that this motif is crucial for the engagement of the toxin to its target receptor. The importance of this region was confirmed by the ablation of both Zot and zonulin binding and the biological effects on tj competency when intestinal tissues were pretreated with the synthetic octapeptide GGVLVQPG corresponding to the shared motif (Fig. 4). Site-directed mutagenesis revealed the key role of the glycine residue in position 298 (as referred to the Zot entire molecule) for Zot engagement to the target zonulin receptor and thus for the activation of intracellular signaling leading to the opening of intercellular tj. The paracellular route is the dominant pathway through which passive solutes flux across both the endothelial and epithelial barriers, and its functional status is regulated, in part, at the level of intercellular tj (25Pappo J. Ermak T.H. Clin. Exp. Immunol. 1996; 189: 487-490Google Scholar). A century ago, the tj was conceptualized as secreted extracellular cement forming an absolute and inert barrier within the paracellular space (26Coreijido M. Coreijado G. Tight Junctions. CRC Press, Boca Raton, FL1992: 1-13Google Scholar). It is now understood that tj are complex and dynamic structures whose physiological regulation appears to be tightly orchestrated through mechanisms that remain largely undefined (27Anderson J.M. Bolda M.S. Fanning A.S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 5: 772-778Google Scholar). Furthermore, tj readily adapt to a variety of developmental, physiological, and pathological circumstances (28Milks L.C. Conyers G.P. Cramen E.B. J. Cell Biol. 1986; 103: 2729-2738Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 29Shasby D.M. Winter M. Shasby S.S. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: C781-C788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Data exist that support the linkage between the actin cytoskeleton and the tj complex (30Furuse M. Hirase T. Itoh M. Nagafuchi A.

The discovery of Zot shed some light on the intricate mechanisms that govern the permeability of tj and led to the discovery of zonulin, the natural ligand of the Zot target receptor. The partial characterization of this zonulin receptor revealed that it is a 45-kDa glycoprotein containing multiple sialic acid residues with structural similarities to myeloid-related protein, a member of the calcium-binding protein family possibly linked to cytoskeletal rearrangements (18Lu R. Wang W. Uzzau S. Vigorito R. Zielke H.R. Fasano A. J. Neurochem. 2000; 74: 320-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). With the studies presented here, we have untangled at the molecular level the interplay between the V. cholerae Zot toxin and the eukaryotic zonulin pathway used by the microorganism to induce tj disassembly. Our findings on the structural requirements to engage to the zonulin receptor binding pocket and, consequently, to activate the zonulin pathway open new research opportunities to gain more insight on a system possibly involved in developmental, physiological, and pathological processes, including tissue morphogenesis, movement of fluid, macromolecules, and leukocytes between body compartments, and malignant transformation and metastasis."
https://openalex.org/W2157980298,"Several lines of evidence have suggested that copper ions play a role in the biology of both PrP(C) and PrP(Sc), the normal and pathologic forms of the prion protein. To further investigate this intriguing connection, we have analyzed how copper ions affect the biochemical properties of PrP(C) extracted from the brains of transgenic mice and from transfected cells. We report that the metal rapidly and reversibly induces PrP(C) to become protease-resistant and detergent-insoluble. Although these two properties are commonly associated with PrP(Sc), we demonstrate using a conformation-dependent immunoassay that copper-treated PrP is structurally distinct from PrP(Sc). The effect of copper requires the presence of at least one of the five octapeptide repeats normally present in the N-terminal half of the protein, consistent with the idea that the metal alters the biochemical properties of PrP by directly binding to this region. These results suggest potential roles for copper in prion diseases, as well as in the physiological function of PrP(C)."
https://openalex.org/W2129041175,"B-cells, triggered via their surface B-cell receptor (BcR), start an apoptotic program known as activation-induced cell death (AICD), and it is widely believed that this phenomenon plays a role in the restriction and focusing of the immune response. Although both ceramide and caspases have been proposed to be involved in AICD, the contribution of either and the exact molecular events through which AICD commences are still unknown. Here we show that in Ramos B-cells, BcR-triggered cell death is associated with an early rise of C16 ceramide that derives from activation of the de novopathway, as demonstrated using a specific inhibitor of ceramide synthase, fumonisin B1 (FB1), and using pulse labeling with the metabolic sphingolipid precursor, palmitate. There was no evidence for activation of sphingomyelinases or hydrolysis of sphingomyelin. Importantly, FB1 inhibited several specific apoptotic hallmarks such as poly(A)DP-ribose polymerase cleavage and DNA fragmentation. Electron microscopy revealed morphological evidence of mitochondrial damage, suggesting the involvement of mitochondria in BcR-triggered apoptosis, and this was inhibited by FB1. Moreover, a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential was observed in Ramos cells after BcR cross-linking, which was inhibited by the addition of FB1. Interestingly, benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-dl-Asp, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor did not inhibit BcR-induced mitochondrial membrane permeability transition but did block DNA fragmentation. These results suggest a crucial role for de novo generated C16 ceramide in the execution of AICD, and they further suggest an ordered and more specific sequence of biochemical events in which de novo generated C16 ceramide is involved in mitochondrial damage resulting in a downstream activation of caspases and apoptosis.

Apoptosis has been shown to be an important means by which organisms maintain homeostasis in proliferating tissues and systems such as the immune system (1Frasca L. Piazza C. Piccolella E. Crit. Rev. Immunol. 1998; 18: 569-594Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 2Hollowood K. Goodlad J.R. J. Pathol. 1998; 185: 229-233Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 3Nunez G. Merino R. Grillot D. Gonzalez G.M. Immunol. Today. 1994; 15: 582-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). The term apoptosis is commonly used to denote the appearance of one, or a combination of, cellular events characterized by nuclear condensation, membrane blebbing, chromatin fragmentation, and loss of membrane integrity resulting in phosphatidylserine exposure and trypan blue uptake (4Wyllie A.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar, 5Darzynkiewicz Z. Traganos F. Adv. Biochem. Eng Biotechnol. 1998; 62: 33-73PubMed Google Scholar). Biochemical mechanisms by which each of these cellular characteristics are regulated remain largely unknown. However, it has become evident that the activation of a family of cysteine proteases known as caspases plays an important role in the progression of the apoptotic process (6Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar,7Cohen G.M. Biochem. J. 1997; 326: 1-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (4132) Google Scholar). Within this caspase family, initiator caspases are activated through an apoptotic stimulus and subsequently activate downstream effector caspases. These effector caspases in turn have a multitude of intracellular substrates, among which are components that are critically needed for cellular homeostasis. Cleavage of one or more of these substrates disregulates cell function and promotes specific morphological characteristics of the apoptotic program (4Wyllie A.H. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 189-197PubMed Google Scholar, 6Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6159) Google Scholar, 7Cohen G.M. Biochem.

Ceramide accumulation has been widely described to be associated with a number of apoptotic hallmarks such as PARP1 cleavage, DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine exposure, and trypan blue uptake (8Dawson G. Goswami R. Kilkus J. Wiesner D. Dawson S. Acta Biochim. Pol. 1998; 45: 287-297Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar, 9Haimovitz F.A. Kolesnick R.N. Fuks Z. Br. Med.

Rev. Physiol. 1998; 60: 643-665Crossref PubMed Scopus (730) Google Scholar). Exogenously added ceramides are generally able to mimic stress-induced apoptosis in a stereospecific manner, and inhibition of the formation of ceramide has been shown, at least in some cases, to inhibit progression of apoptosis (12Wiesner D.A.

Lipids. 1999; 34 (suppl.): 5-11Crossref Google Scholar). The stress-induced metabolic conversion of sphingomyelin (SM) into ceramide by the enzyme SMase has been described extensively in response to various treatments of cells such as tumor necrosis factor-α, anti-Fas, serum withdrawal, and other agents. However, ceramide can also be generated through thede novo synthesis pathway, in which activation of serine palmitoyl transferase and/or ceramide synthase may play a pivotal role (15Garzotto M.

Cell. 1995; 82: 405-414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). However, how ceramide generated from each pathway is involved in the apoptotic program is as yet largely unknown. In previous studies, using model systems in which apoptosis was induced with tumor necrosis factor or Fas activation via the caspase 8-dependent pathway, it was shown that ceramide formation occurs in between initiator caspases and effector caspases (18Tepper A.D. Cock J.G. de Vries E. Borst J. van Blitterswijk W.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 24308-24312Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar,19Tepper A.D. de Vries E. van Blitterswijk W.J. Borst J. J. Clin. Invest. 1999; 103: 971-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). AICD of B-cells triggered via their BcR provides a physiologically relevant model to study molecular and biochemical events leading to induction of apoptosis. Cross-linking of surface-expressed Ig in B-cells sets off an apoptotic program leading to cell death that is characterized by a number of the above-mentioned apoptotic features including PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation (13Chen L. Kim T.J. Pillai S. Mol. Immunol. 1998; 35: 195-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, BcR-induced cell death has been sown to commence via an initial caspase-independent step (20Berard M. Mondiere P. Casamayor-Palleja M. Hennino A. Bella C. Defrance T. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 4655-4662PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to activation of caspases, ceramide formation has been shown to occur in response to BcR triggering (12Wiesner D.A. Kilkus J.P. Gottschalk A.R. Quintans J. Dawson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9868-9876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 21Quintans J. Kilkus J. McShan C.L. Gottschalk A.R.

However, the exact metabolic pathway underlying this elevated ceramide, as well as the role of ceramide in the progression of apoptosis, has not been determined. In this study we have investigated how BcR-induced generation of ceramide is involved in the induction of apoptosis. We first provide evidence that this ceramide appears to arise exclusively from de novo synthesis. We also show that early changes in de novo derived C16 ceramide are linked to a loss of function of mitochondria and subsequent activation of the apoptotic program. We postulate a role for de novo generated C16 ceramide in alterations in the mitochondrial membrane leading to cytochromec release and subsequent activation of a cascade of downstream effectors involved in the further execution of apoptosis. The Epstein-Barr virus negative Burkitt's lymphoma Ramos cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA) and grown in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 25 mm Hepes, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mml-glutamine (Life Technologies, Inc.), 1 mnsodium pyruvate (Life Technologies, Inc.), 100 units/ml penicillin (Life Technologies, Inc.), and 100 g/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.) under standard incubator conditions (humidified atmosphere: 95% air, 5% CO2; 37 °C). Polyclonal rabbit anti-PARP antibody and peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA). Fumonisin B1 and ribonuclease A were purchased from Sigma. C6-ceramide was obtained from Matreya Inc. (Pleasant Gap, PA). Propidium Iodide and DiOC6 were purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). [3H]Palmitate, [methyl-3H]choline, and [γ-32P]ATP were obtained from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. z-VAD (Z-Val-Ala-dl-Asp)-fluoromethylketone was from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA). Cell pellets (2.0 × 106) were lysed in chloroform:methanol (1:2), and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer. Aliquots were dried down and used for ceramide and phosphate measurements. Ceramide levels were measured using theEscherichia coli diacylglycerol kinase assay (22Preiss J. Loomis C.R. Bishop W.R. Stein R. Niedel J.E. Bell R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1986; 261: 8597-8600Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 23Van Veldhoven P.P. Bishop W.R. Bell R.M. Anal. Biochem. 1989; 183: 177-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Briefly, lipids were incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the presence of β-octylglucoside/dioleoyl-phosphatidyl glycerol micelles, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 5 μg of proteins of diacylglycerol kinase membranes, and 2 mm ATP (mixed with [γ-32P]ATP) in a final volume of 100 μl. Lipids were again extracted according to Bligh and Dyer. 32P-Ceramide was determined by TLC analysis in chloroform:acetone:methanol:acetic acid:water (50:20:15:10:5), followed by scraping the ceramide doublet and counting the radioactivity by liquid scintillation. Ceramide levels were normalized to total lipid phosphate. Cell pellets (2.0 × 106) were lysed in chloroform:methanol (1:2), and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer. Aliquots were dried down and used for ceramide and phosphate measurements. For mass spectrometric analysis we utilized normal phase high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to atmospheric pressure chemical ionization. Briefly, separations were conducted using Iatrobead (Iatron Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) beaded silica columns utilized in a normal phase of operation. Elutions were completed on an Agilent (Palo Alto, CA) model 1100 HPLC system equipped with a binary pumping system of iso-octane and ethyl acetate. All mass spectrometry analyses were conducted on a Finnigan (Foster City, CA) LCQ ion trap mass spectrometer. For atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry, the entire flow from the HPLC column was directed to the atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source. For all experiments, source ion optics were adjusted to accomplish desolvation of ions while minimizing fragmentation of analyte ions in the inlet region of the mass spectrometer. Ceramide and dihydroceramide subspecies were identified by a combination of mass (m/z), intensity ratios in the mass spectrometry fragmentation pattern, and column retention. Analysis was then standardized by programming the LC-Quant software followed by manual confirmation (the full details of this method are in preparation). 2B. Pettus, M. Bussmann, and Y. Hannun, manuscript in preparation. Ramos cells (2.0 × 106/4 ml of RPMI, 10% fetal calf serum) were labeled with 4 μCi of [3H]palmitate. Anti-IgM and inhibitors (fumonisin B1) were added together with the radionucleotides. After 6 h, cells were washed once with PBS, and subsequently the lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer. Lipids were separated using TLC analysis in ethyl acetate:iso-octane:acetic acid (9:5:2). A ceramide standard, visualized by iodine vapor, was used as a reference. TLC plates were sprayed by En3Hance spray, and radioactivity was visualized by autoradiography for 48 h in −80 °C. The ceramide spot was scraped, and radioactivity was quantitated by liquid scintillation counting. Ceramide levels were normalized to total lipid phosphate. The activities of both neutral and acid SMase were determined using radiolabeled substrate in a mixed micelle assay as described (24Liu B. Hassler D.F. Smith G.K. Weaver K. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34472-34479Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). For analysis of neutral SMase activity, cells were lysed in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin. A cell lysate (50 μl) containing 50 μg of protein was added to a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 10 mm MgCl2, 0.05% Triton X-100, 5 mm dithiothreitol, 5 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (100,000 dpm), and 10 nmol of cold SM per reaction. For analysis of acid SMase activity, 50 μl of cell lysate containing 50 μg of protein was added to a 50-μl reaction mixture containing 100 mm sodium acetate, pH 5.0, 5 nmol of [14C]sphingomyelin (100,000 dpm), and 10 nmol of cold SM per reaction. Exogenously added SM was solubilized in the reaction mixture by sonication prior to the addition of enzyme. Reactions were allowed to proceed for 45 min at 37 °C and stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of cloroform: methanol (2:1) and 0.2 ml of H2O. Separate phases were clarified by centrifugation for 5 min at 3000 rpm, and 0.4 ml of the aqueous upper phase was counted by liquid scintillation counting. Total hydrolyzed SM never exceeded 5% of the total amount of radiolabeled SM added to the assay. Cells were labeled for 48 h with [methyl-3H]choline chloride (final specific activity, 0.5 μCi/ml). After cell treatment as described, cells were washed with PBS, and lipids were extracted from the cell pellets by the method of Bligh and Dyer. Part of the extracted lipids were used for phosphate measurement. Remaining lipids were subjected to mild base hydrolysis (25Andrieu N. Salvayre R. Levade T. Biochem. J. 1994; 303: 341-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), and [3H]sphingomyelin was determined by TLC analysis in chloroform: methanol: acetic acid: H2O (50:30:8:5), followed by scraping and counting radioactivity by liquid scintilation. To evaluate changes in Δψ, cells (5 × 105/ml) were treated as described. After washing and resuspension in medium without fetal calf serum, cells were labeled with DiOC6 (40 nm) for 15 min at 37 °C. After incubation, cells were washed and analyzed directly on a flow cytometer using extinction and emission wavelengths of 495 and 525 nm, respectively. Cells (0.5 × 106/2 ml) were treated as described. After treatment, cells were pelleted and resuspended in 2 ml of ice-cold 70% ethanol and incubated for 1 h at 4 °C. After incubation, cells were washed twice with PBS and finally resuspended in PBS containing RNase (final concentration, 0.5 mg/ml) and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C. Finally, propidium iodide was added at a final concentration of 50 μg/ml and incubated overnight in the dark at 4 °C. The cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. Cells were lysed for 15 min on ice in lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaCl, 0.05% SDS, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and mixed with reducing SDS sample buffer. Proteins (10 μg, as determined by Bio-Rad protein assay) were separated on 7.5% SDS-polyacrylamide minigels. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, which were subsequently blocked by 5% nonfat dry milk in PBS, Tween 20 (0.1%, v/v). Blots were incubated with anti-PARP at a 1:1000 dilution with 5% nonfat dry milk. After subsequent incubation with a 1:2000 dilution of horseradish peroxidase anti-rabbit IgG, proteins were visualized by ECL (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). BcR cross-linking using anti-IgM antiserum has been shown to induce apoptosis over a time period of ∼48 h. As shown in Fig. 1A, PARP cleavage was observed starting at 12 h after BcR cross-linking and gradually increased over the next 36 h. In accordance with this, a gradual increase in DNA fragmentation up to 31% after 48 h was observed in similarly treated cells (Fig. 1B). Similar to BcR cross-linking, direct addition of exogenous ceramide to cells has been shown to induce apoptosis in various cell lines. As shown in Fig.2, addition of up to 10 μmC6-ceramide to Ramos cells for 24 h induced PARP cleavage in a dose-dependent manner. We next determined ceramide levels in Ramos cells upon BcR cross-linking. As shown in Fig.3A, ceramide levels increased gradually, reaching a 2.5-fold increase at 48 h after the start of the treatment. These changes are consistent with a previous study in WEHI B-cells (12Wiesner D.A. Kilkus J.P. Gottschalk A.R. Quintans J. Dawson G. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 9868-9876Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). The changes in ceramide were further analyzed by TLC. It is important to note that our TLC system resolves ceramide (after derivatization into ceramide phosphate) into two spots (see Fig.3D). Interestingly, ceramide in the lower spot started to increase as soon as 6 h after BcR cross-linking, whereas an increase in the upper ceramide spot could not be detected until 24 h after treatment (Fig. 3, B and C). We find that the derivatized ceramide phosphate comigrates with the lower spot, whereas dihydroceramide phosphate migrates with the upper spot (26Bielawska A. Greenberg M.S. Perry D. Jayadev S. Shayman J.A. McKay C. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 12646-12654Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (195) Google Scholar). In addition, longer chain ceramides migrate with the upper spot as compared with C16-ceramides, which migrate in the lower spot. 3A. Bielawska and Y. Hannun, unpublished observations. No changes in ceramide were detected at earlier time points (5 min to 3 h) after BcR cross-linking (data not shown).Figure 2Treatment of Ramos cells with cell permeable C6-ceramide mimics anti-IgM-induced PARP cleavage. Ramos cells (5 × 105/ml) were treated with anti-IgM (10 μg/ml) or C6-ceramide in the concentrations shown. After 24 h of treatment, cells were lysed, followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and Western blotting was performed as described. Both treatments, with either anti-IgM or ceramide, induced PARP cleavage. Representative results from three independently performed experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Figure 3B-cell receptor cross-linking is associated with elevation of endogenous ceramide levels. Ramos cells (5 × 105/ml) were treated with anti-IgM (10 μg/ml) for the indicated time periods and prepared for measurement of cellular ceramide (cer.) as described. Ceramide mass (closed bars), normalized to lipid phosphate, is plotted as the total ceramide measured (A), the upper ceramide phosphate spot (B), and the lower ceramide phosphate spot (C), as visible on TLC (D). Time-matched controls (open bars) obtained from untreated Ramos cells are included. Representative results from five independently performed experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To clarify the molecular nature of these two spots, tandem mass spectrometric analysis was employed. Such analysis has been able to routinely detect 14 ceramide and dihydroceramide subspecies in Ramos cells ranging from C14 to C26 in fatty acid length. Of note was the presence of a double bond on the fatty acid of ceramides longer than C24. C24:0 and C26:0 were also present, but absolute levels of C24:1 to C24:0 were difficult to resolve because, in contrast to the dihydroceramides, there is no difference in column retention with this double bond (ceramides have a double bond in resonance association with a hydroxyl group), and isotope ratios make a m/z of 2 units difficult to quantitate. We speculate that the ratio is nearly 1:1, with this ratio remaining constant during ceramide changes studied thus far. Analysis by this method under anti-IgM-induced cross-linking of BcR revealed that early ceramide changes were specific to long chain ceramides (C14, C16, and C18 fatty acid lengths) and their respective dihydroceramide counterparts. The composition of the lower spot was overwhelmingly a C16 ceramide, with a 1.5-fold change at 6 h corresponding well to the increase in ceramide seen in the lower spot by diacylglycerol kinase at 6 h (Fig.4A). Similarly, the composition at 24 h of treatment revealed a nearly 3-fold increase in C16 ceramide, with similar, approximately 2-fold changes in C14, C18, and the dihydroceramides matching the 2.5-fold increase in the lower spot at this time. However, at 24 h the upper spot began to change significantly, as could be seen by a 1.5-fold increase by diacylglycerol kinase. Mass spectrometry revealed a nearly 2-fold increase in the very long chain C24-ceramide, with possible slight increases in C22 and C26 ceramides and the corresponding dihydroceramides (Fig. 4B). Therefore, mass spectrometry was able to resolve distinct temporal changes in ceramide species; the C16-ceramide was the early detected species and corresponded to the lower spot seen by diacylglycerol kinase, and C24-ceramides came up late and corresponded to the upper spot by diacylglycerol kinase. Ceramide can be generated from diverse metabolic routes, e.g. from SM through activation of SMase or from activation of the de novo pathway. Thus, the activity of divergent enzymes involved in the generation of ceramide may be regulated differently. Moreover, ceramide derived from different pathways may be involved differently in various cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. To determine the nature of the BcR-induced ceramide formation, we measured SMase activity and determined SM levels in Ramos cells after BcR cross-linking. As shown in Fig.5, A and B, induction of neither neutral- nor acid-type SMase activity was observed after BcR cross-linking over the time period where ceramide levels increased. In addition, no decrease in SM levels was detected after IgM cross-linking, which would have been indicative of any type of SMase activity. Because SMase activity did not seem to be involved in the formation of ceramide after BcR cross-linking, we next investigated the possibility that the observed ceramide was formed de novo.To this end we made use of fumonisin B1 (FB1), a selective inhibitor of ceramide synthase that catalyzes the acylation step in the de novo pathway of ceramide formation. As shown in Fig.6 for the lower ceramide spot, treatment of Ramos cells with 50 μm FB1 completely prevented ceramide accumulation in response to anti-IgM-induced BcR cross-linking. This strongly suggested the involvement of ceramide synthase in the formation of ceramide upon BcR ligation. In addition, the increase in ceramide migrating with the upper ceramide phosphate spot was completely inhibited, whereas SM levels remained unchanged (data not shown).Figure 6FB1 inhibits anti-IgM-induced accumulation of ceramide. Ramos cells (5 × 105/ml) were treated with anti-IgM (10 μg/ml) for the indicated time periods in the presence or absence of FB1 and prepared for measurement of cellular ceramide (cer.) as described. Anti-IgM-induced ceramide accumulation (closed bars) was prevented in the presence of FB1 (50 μm) (hatched bars). Time-matched controls obtained from untreated (open bars) and FB1-treated (cross hatched bars) Ramos cells are included. Representative results from three independently performed experiments are shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To further substantiate that BcR-induced ceramide accumulation was generated de novo, we performed pulse-labeling experiments using radioactive palmitate, which serves as a substrate for both serine palmitoyl transferase and ceramide synthase in the de novo pathway. As shown in Fig.7, palmitate added as a pulse label after BcR ligation was incorporated into ceramide, resulting in a 175% increase over control-treated cells 6 h after the start of the treatment. The increase in ceramide from palmitate was nearly totally blocked by adding FB1. Because ceramide has been proposed to be involved directly in multiple aspects of apoptosis, we determined whether FB1 could inhibit Ramos cells from entering the apoptotic program. As shown in Fig. 8, incubation of Ramos cells with FB1 during BcR cross-linking inhibited both induction of PARP cleavage (Fig. 8A) and DNA fragmentation (Fig. 8B). FB1 by itself did not significantly affect PARP cleavage (Fig. 8A) or DNA fragmentation (data not shown). These results suggest a necessary role for the de novo generated ceramide in activating these downstream effector functions of apoptosis that are mediated by caspases (see below). It is now generally accepted that mitochondria play key roles in the regulation of apoptosis. To investigate the involvement of mitochondria in BcR cross-linking-induced ceramide formation and apoptosis, we examined the mitochondrial morphology and function of Ramos cells by electron microscopy and flow cytometry, respectively, after anti-IgM treatment in the presence or absence of fumonisin or z-VAD, a broad spectrum caspase inhibitor. BcR cross-linking resulted in distinct morphological changes of mitochondria. Control cells showed a multitude of mostly small intact mitochondria. In contrast, anti-IgM treatment resulted in significant mitochondrial swelling along with extensive disruption of the mitochondrial membranes (Fig.9). A protective effect on mitochondrial morphology was observed when Ramos cells were treated with anti-IgM in the presence of FB1 (Fig. 9), suggesting the involvement of de novo derived ceramide in the observed mitochondrial damage. Interestingly, no such protective effect on anti-IgM-induced mitochondrial damage was observed using z-VAD, suggesting that mitochondrial effects of BcR cross-linking are independent of activation of caspases 3, 4, 7, and possibly 9. Mitochondrial damage can be assessed biochemically by measuring the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (ΔΨ), which has been shown to correlate with the release of cytochrome c, giving rise to caspase 9 activation that can then activate caspase 3 (27Slee E.A.

To elucidate the relationship between μ-opioid receptor (MOR) phosphorylation and the regulation of receptor activity, a series of receptor mutants was constructed in which the 12 Ser/Thr residues of the COOH-terminal portion of the receptor were substituted to Ala, either individually or in combination. All these mutant constructs were stably expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and exhibited similar expression levels and ligand binding properties. Among those 12 Ser/Thr residues, Ser363, Thr370, and Ser375 have been identified as phosphorylation sites. In the absence of the agonist, a basal phosphorylation of Ser363 and Thr370 was observed, whereas [d-Ala2,Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalin (DAMGO)-induced receptor phosphorylation occurs at Thr370 and Ser375 residues. Furthermore, the role of these phosphorylation sites in regulating the internalization of MOR was investigated. The mutation of Ser375 to Ala reduced the rate and extent of receptor internalization, whereas mutation of Ser363 and Thr370 to Ala accelerated MOR internalization kinetics. The present data show that the basal phosphorylation of MOR could play a role in modulating agonist-induced receptor internalization kinetics. Furthermore, even though μ-receptors and δ-opioid receptors have the same motif encompassing agonist-induced phosphorylation sites, the different agonist-induced internalization properties controlled by these sites suggest differential cellular regulation of these two receptor subtypes.

Opioid alkaloids, as well as endogenous opioid peptides, exert their multiple biological effects on target tissues by interacting with specific cell surface receptors including the δ-, μ-, and κ-opioid receptors (1Law P.Y. Wong Y.H. Loh H.H. Annu. Rev. Pharmacol. Toxicol. 2000; 40: 389-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (538) Google Scholar). These opioid receptors belong to the superfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 1The abbreviations used are: GPCRG protein-coupled receptorMORμ-opioid receptorDORδ-opioid receptorHEKhuman embryonic kidneyDAMGO[d-Ala2,Me-Phe4,Gly5-ol]enkephalinPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisTricineN-[2-hydroxy-1,1-bis(hydroxymethyl)ethyl]glycineGRKG protein-coupled receptor kinaseC-tailcarboxyl tail The μ-opioid receptor (MOR) serves as the principle physiological target for most clinically important opioid analgesics, such as morphine and fentanyl (2Mestek A.

Although many opioid alkaloids exert their pharmacological effects via MOR, their binding affinity for the receptor and potency to activate the receptor do not always correspond to their abilities to induce tolerance (4Nestler E.J.

This suggests that other cellular processes that modulate MOR responsiveness, such as receptor desensitization and internalization, may contribute to opioid tolerance and dependence. Like many other GPCRs, opioid receptors are regulated by agonist-dependent processes and undergo receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, internalization, and down-regulation (1Law P.Y. Wong Y.H.

However, the detailed molecular events underlying this differential regulation of MOR by distinct agonists remain unclear.Using chimeric, truncated, or mutated opioid receptors, several studies reported the crucial role of the C-tail of opioid receptors in regulating their activities and trafficking (11Chu P.

FEBS Lett. 1995; 359: 142-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). Whereas several potential phosphorylation sites were suggested to be involved in regulating the activity and trafficking of opioid receptors, the actual phosphorylation of these residues was not demonstrated. Only recently, Maestri-El Kouhen et al. (21Maestri-El Kouhen O. Wang G. Solberg J. Erickson L.J. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) have reported the identification of phosphorylation sites of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) in human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells. These results show the implication of precise phosphorylation sites (Thr358 and Ser363) in regulating the internalization and desensitization of DOR (21Maestri-El Kouhen O. Wang G. Solberg J. Erickson L.J. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 36659-36664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). Additionally, agonist-induced internalization of opioid receptors seems to be cell type-dependent (22Murray S.R. Evans C.J. von Zastrow M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 24987-24991Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar), indicating a recruitment of specific cellular factors in regulating opioid receptor trafficking.From our own studies and other reports, agonist-induced opioid receptor phosphorylation has been shown to be time- and dose-dependent and could be blocked by antagonist naloxone (23El Kouhen R. Maestri-El, Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar, 24Zhang L., Yu, Y. Mackin S. Weight F.F. Uhl G.R.

Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously reported that rapid phosphorylation of MOR does not directly correlate with the relatively slow rate of receptor desensitization as measured by the loss of inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity (23El Kouhen R. Maestri-El, Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). We recently reconciled that such a difference could be attributed to the expression level of the receptor as well as the rapid recycling and resensitization of MOR after etorphine treatment (26Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). By limiting the recycling of the receptor and receptor density on the cell surface, rapid desensitization of MOR was observed (26Law P.Y. Erickson L.J. El-Kouhen R. Dicker L. Solberg J. Wang W. Miller E. Burd A.L. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 2000; 58: 388-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar). Whether MOR phosphorylation plays a role in these cellular events needs to be established unequivocally. Therefore, it is imperative to understand the phosphorylation mechanisms and identify specific phosphorylation sites and their involvement in the cellular regulation of MOR.In the present work, we examine the role of phosphorylation of individual Ser/Thr residues in agonist-induced MOR internalization. Our mutational analysis indicates that Ser363, Thr370, and Ser375 residues are phosphorylation sites, and we clearly show that these sites are differentially phosphorylated in basal and agonist-induced conditions. Subsequently, we provided evidence that phosphorylation of these specific Ser/Thr residues differentially regulates agonist-induced MOR internalization. This study reveals that agonist-induced internalization of MOR is modulated by site-specific phosphorylation.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterialsOligonucleotides were synthesized by an automated DNA synthesizer (Millipore model 8905). Taq polymerase and restriction enzymes were obtained from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Expression vector pcDNA3 and cloning vector pCRII were from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA). Cell culture reagents, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, minimal essential medium, phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, fetal calf serum, and Geneticin (G-418) were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]Diprenorphine (39.0 Ci/mmol) was supplied by Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. [32P]Orthophosphate (400–800 mCi/ml) was supplied by ICN (Costa Mesa, CA). DAMGO and other opioid ligands were supplied by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. All other chemicals were purchased from Sigma.Construction of Mutants of the μ-Opioid ReceptorThe human influenza virus hemagglutinin epitope-tagged rat μ-opioid receptor (MOR1TAG) (27Arvidsson U. Riedl M. Chakrabarti S. Lee J.H. Nakano A.H. Dado R.J. Loh H.H. Law P.Y. Wessendorf M.W. Elde R. J. Neurosci. 1995; 15: 3328-3341Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) subcloned into the expression vector pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was used to generate most point mutations. Additional point mutations, alone or in combination, were constructed in multiple steps using the QuickChangeTMsite-directed mutagenesis method as outlined by Stratagene (La Jolla, CA). Forward and reverse oligonucleotides with the desired mutation and a designed endonuclease site were synthesized. The nucleotide sequences of all mutants were confirmed by dideoxynucleotide termination reactions using Sequenase II.Stable Transfection of HEK293 Cells with Wild Type and Mutant μ-Opioid ReceptorsHEK293 cells were cultured in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 100 IU/ml penicillin under humidified atmosphere at 5% CO2. Cells were stably transfected by the Ser/Thr mutants or the wild type rat μ-opioid receptor-1 cDNAs using the calcium phosphate precipitation method (28Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). To avoid any position effect because of random integration of cDNAs into the chromosomes, colonies of transfected HEK293 cells surviving 1 mg/ml Geneticin (G-418) selection were pooled. Confirmation of μ-opioid receptor expression was determined by whole cell binding assay using [3H]diprenorphine in 25 mm HEPES buffer, 5 mm MgCl2, pH 7.6. Specific binding is defined as the difference between the radioactivity bound to the cells in the presence and absence of naloxone (100 μm).Receptor PhosphorylationPhosphorylation of HEK293 cells stably expressing the Ser/Thr mutant or wild type μ-opioid receptors was determined as described previously (23El Kouhen R. Maestri-El, Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). Cultured cells in 6-well plates were washed with phosphate-free Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and incubated with 100 μCi/ml [32P]orthophosphate for 2 h at 37 °C in 10% CO2. 5 μm DAMGO was added as indicated. The reactions were terminated on ice at which point the cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and subsequently lysed in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1%,v/v, Triton X-100, 5 mm EDTA with 100 μg/ml bacitracin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 100 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 μg/ml pepstatin A, and 20 μg/ml benzamidine as protease inhibitors and with 50 mm sodium fluoride, 10 mm sodium pyrophosphate, and 0.1 mm sodium vanadate as phosphatase inhibitors). After solubilization, insoluble debris was removed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C. Supernatants were eluted to twice the volume with lysis buffer (without Triton X-100) before loading onto 1-ml wheat germ lectin affinity columns pre-equilibrated with buffer A (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm NaCl, and 0.1 Triton X-100). The columns were then washed with 10 ml of buffer A to remove nonbound radioactive proteins, and the MOR-containing fraction was eluted with 3 ml of buffer A containing 0.5 m N-acetylglucosamine and the protease/phosphatase inhibitors as indicated above. These purified samples were incubated in the presence of 3 μg of rat hemagglutinin-monoclonal antibody 3F10 (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and prewashed immunopure protein G-agarose beads (Pierce) overnight at 4 °C. The final samples were eluted from the agarose beads and separated on a 10% SDS-PAGE (23El Kouhen R. Maestri-El, Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the gels were dried, and phosphorylated bands were visualized and quantified using the PhosphorImager Storm 840 system (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Phosphorylation levels obtained for mutant and wild type receptors were normalized according to protein amount as well as receptor expression level within the starting cell materials.Opioid Receptor BindingCharacterization of the μ-opioid receptor binding sites in HEK293 cells expressing wild type and mutated receptors was carried out with membranes (100,000 ×g × 60-min membrane preparations minus nuclei) in 25 mm HEPES buffer, pH 7.6, containing 5 mmMgCl2 at 24 °C for 90 min as described previously (29Law P.Y. Hom D.S. Loh H.H. Mol. Pharmacol. 1983; 24: 413-423PubMed Google Scholar). The Kd and Bmax values for [3H]diprenorphine were determined for each mutant by saturation binding. IC50 and Ki values for DAMGO were determined by competition binding studies using increasing concentrations of DAMGO to compete for the binding of 1 nm [3H]diprenorphine. Data from saturation and competition binding were fitted by nonlinear curve fitting using the data analysis program GraphPad Prism.Cyanogen Bromide Cleavage of μ-Opioid ReceptorRadiolabeled μ-opioid receptor bands were excised from the gel, and receptor protein was eluted in Tris-glycine buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, and 0.1% w/v SDS) at 4 °C. Receptor fractions were first dialyzed and lyophilized and then reduced and alkylated before treatment in the presence of CNBr (160 mg/ml in 70% formic acid) (30Ozcelebi F. Miller L.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3435-3441Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). CNBr cleavage products were separated on a Tricine-SDS-PAGE (16.5% acrylamide, 6% bis-acrylamide) (31Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10442) Google Scholar), and phosphopeptide bands were visualized by PhosphorImager.Quantitative Analysis of μ-Opioid Receptor Internalization by Fluorescence Flow CytometryA pool of stably transfected HEK293 cells expressing wild type or mutant hemagglutinin epitope-tagged receptors was incubated in the presence of 5 μm DAMGO for the indicated time intervals. Cells were then chilled on ice to stop membrane trafficking, and all subsequent incubations were performed at 4 °C. Residual cell surface receptors were monitored by incubating cells in the presence of monoclonal anti-hemagglutinin antibody (clone 16B12) (Babco, Richmond, CA) for 2 h followed by an incubation with the Alexa 488-conjugated anti-IgG antibodies (Molecular Probes, Inc., Eugene, OR) for 1 h. Surface receptor staining intensity of antibody-labeled cells was analyzed using fluorescence flow cytometry (FACScan, Becton Dickinson, Palo Alto, CA). Each data point represents the average of mean fluorescence values ± S.E. of receptor internalization determined in an analysis of 10,000 cells performed in triplicate.RESULTSPreviously, we reported that DAMGO-induced MOR phosphorylation occurs rapidly with maximum phosphorylation obtained after 20 min of agonist treatment (23El Kouhen R. Maestri-El, Kouhen O. Law P.Y. Loh H.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9207-9215Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). To localize the intracellular domains containing the phosphorylation sites, phosphorylated MOR was purified and chemically cleaved in the presence of cyanogen bromide as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The theoretical CNBr cleavage after Met residues generates several fragments with different sizes including the C-tail domain of the receptor (Fig.1 A). To perform total protein digestion, phosphorylated receptors were incubated with CNBr for up to 24 h. After CNBr cleavage, samples containing generated peptides were resolved on 16.5% Tricine-SDS-PAGE, and phosphorylated bands were visualized using a PhosphorImager (Fig. 1 B). Only one phosphorylated band migrating at ∼13 kDa, a size corresponding to the C-tail domain of MOR, could be detected (Fig. 1 B). This result strongly indicated that DAMGO-induced phosphorylation occurs only within the cytoplasmic tail of MOR. A direct sequencing of the purified C-tail of MOR to determine the exact phosphorylation sites was not feasible because of the insufficient amount of purified peptide. Therefore, we used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to identify phosphorylated Ser/Thr residues within the C-tail of MOR.There are 12 Ser/Thr residues within the C-tail of rat MOR that are potential phosphorylation sites. To identify which Ser/Thr residues are phosphorylated, we constructed a number of mutated receptors in which these residues were substituted to Ala, either individually or in combination. Each of these mutated receptors as well as wild type MOR were stably expressed in HEK293 cells. To avoid any phenotype effect as a result of random integration of the plasmid into the chromosomes, a mixture of cell clones stably expressing either receptor was used in the present study as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Receptor expression levels (Bmax) obtained were high for all mutated and wild type receptors ranging from 0.9 to 6.9 pmol/mg protein (Table I).Kd values of [3H]diprenorphine were similar among all these receptors, whereas small variations in the affinities of certain mutated receptors for DAMGO were observed (TableI).Table ICharacterization of the hemagglutin epitope-tagged μ-opioid receptor and mutant receptors lacking putative phosphorylation sitesReceptor mutantProtein (Bmax)DiprenorphineDAMGOpmol/mgKd (nm)Ki(nm)WT MOR6.9 ± 0.60.9 ± 0.18.8 ± 1.0354–3572.0 ± 0.61.2 ± 0.28.9 ± 0.2354–3641.6 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.38.5 ± 0.5354–3762.8 ± 0.41.0 ± 0.28.0 ± 2.5354–3943.0 ± 0.61.3 ± 0.27.7 ± 0.3363–3761.5 ± 0.61.2 ± 0.29.5 ± 0.4363/3640.9 ± 0.21.4 ± 0.17.3 ± 1.5375/3762.2 ± 0.31.5 ± 0.37.3 ± 0.53631.9 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.311.1 ± 7.33641.4 ± 0.41.1 ± 0.12.4 ± 1.03702.5 ± 0.31.2 ± 0.18.5 ± 2.63754.8 ± 0.41.3 ± 0.214.5 ± 3.53762.6 ± 0.71.2 ± 0.218.6 ± 5.1363/370/3751.8 ± 0.11.5 ± 0.411.6 ± 1.1370/3751.6 ± 0.11.8 ± 0.614.4 ± 6.2363/3754.6 ± 0.61.0 ± 0.21.6 ± 0.6363/3701.3 ± 0.21.7 ± 0.129.7 ± 5.4A pool of HEK293 clones stably expressing wild type or mutated receptors was used for this study.

Data shown are the mean ± S.E. of at least two independent experiments. WT, wild type. Open table in a new tab To define the region within the C-tail domain of MOR containing the phosphorylation sites, we first used a group of mutated receptors in which we progressively substituted clusters of Ser/Thr residues to Ala (Fig. 2 C). After 20 min of treatment in the presence of a saturating concentration of DAMGO (5 μm), phosphorylated receptors were purified and resolved on 10% SDS-PAGE as described under “Experimental Procedures” (Fig.2 A). Phosphorylated bands were quantified and normalized according to total protein amount as well as receptor expression levels measured in the presence of [3H]diprenorphine. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, the substitution of the first four Ser/Thr residues (Thr354–Thr357) to Ala (mutant 354–357) did not affect agonist-induced MOR phosphorylation when compared with that of wild type receptor. Substitution of the six residues Thr354–Thr357, Ser363, and Thr364 to Ala (mutant 354–364) reduced the level of phosphorylation to approximately 60% of wild type receptor. Phosphorylation of mutant 354–376, in which the nine residues Thr354–Thr357, Ser363, Thr364, Thr370, Ser375, and Thr376 were replaced by Ala, was completely abolished. As expected, no phosphorylation signal could be detected with mutant 354–394 in which all 12 Ser/Thr residues of the C-tail were changed to Ala (Fig. 2). These results clearly support our finding from CNBr experiments and show that phosphorylation occurs only at the C-tail of MOR. In addition, these results indicate that the phosphorylation sites are localized within the region Ser363–Thr376.Figure 2Analysis of DAMGO-induced phosphorylation of Ser/Thr cluster mutants of MOR.

The phosphorylation level of mutant 363–376, in which all of the five potential sites were replaced by Ala, was nearly abolished (Fig. 3, A andB). However, when compared with mutant 354–376 that completely abolishes receptor phosphorylation (Fig. 2), mutant 363–376 still presents a weak phosphorylation signal (<5% of maximal phosphorylation). This slight difference in phosphorylation signals between these two mutants could be because of a minor phosphorylation site present outside of the Ser363–Thr376 region. Nevertheless, this result indicates that major phosphorylation sites are located within the Ser363–Thr376 region.Figure 3Analysis of DAMGO-induced phosphorylation within the Ser363-Thr376 region of MOR.A, HEK293 cells stably expressing mutated or wild type receptors were labeled with 32Pi and incubated in the presence of 5 μm DAMGO for 20 min.

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER)1 is the port of entry and the main folding compartment for proteins destined to the exocytic pathway. A stringent quality control system is coupled to the folding machinery, ensuring that only structurally mature proteins reach the Golgi (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar). Proteins that fail to attain their correct three-dimensional structure are retained in the ER and eventually degraded after a lag that varies among individual substrates (2Klausner R.D. Sitia R.

Med. 1998; 187: 835-846Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar), implying that proteins targeted for degradation must be delivered to the cytosol (15Rivett A.J. Palmer A. Knecht E. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1992; 40: 1165-1172Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar). Sec61, a component of the translocon complex that mediates the entry of proteins into the ER (16Rapoport T.A. Jungnickel B. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1996; 65: 271-303Crossref PubMed Scopus (496) Google Scholar), seems to be involved also in the retrograde translocation, or dislocation, to the cytosol (17Wiertz E.J.

EMBO J. 1997; 16: 4540-4548Crossref PubMed Scopus (347) Google Scholar). This observation raises intriguing questions on the mechanisms that gate Sec61 for dislocation and determine the directionality of transport across the ER membrane (19Mayer T.U. Braun T. Jentsch S. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 3251-3257Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 20Chillaron J. Haas I.G. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2000; 11: 217-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 21Mancini R. Fagioli C.

Immunol. 2000; 164: 4713-4719Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). ER quality control prevents the deployment of potentially harmful molecules to their final destinations and maintains homeostasis within the ER. Somehow, the system must be capable of discriminating terminally unfolded and/or unassembled molecules from newly translocated polypeptides, which have not had the time to complete folding. Therefore, the processes of retention and degradation must not only be specific but also be precisely timed. The oligosaccharide moieties present on many ER-synthesized proteins have been shown to play a crucial role in the quality control (see Ref.1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar for a comprehensive review). A branched oligosaccharide consisting of three glucoses, nine mannoses, and two N-acetylglucosamines (Glc3Man9GlcNAc2) is added to the nascent polypeptide when an appropriate sequence is recognized by oligosaccharyl-transferase (Fig. 1). Immediately after synthesis, the terminal glucoses are removed by two glucosidases (I and II) localized in the ER. Another ER-resident enzyme, UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, is capable of adding a glucose residue to the A branch of the glycans present on unfolded molecules, favoring their binding to calnexin or calreticulin. These two ER chaperones bind monoglucosylated proteins and retain them in the folding-promoting ER environment. ER mannosidases I and II remove the terminal mannoses from the B and C branches, respectively. It is thought that glycans lacking the terminal mannoses are poorer substrates of glucosidase II and UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, thereby bringing the calnexin cycle to an end (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar, 23Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). Hence, it is possible that the different kinetics of the ER sugar-processing enzymes provide a molecular mechanism to time retention and dislocation/degradation. Evidence for a role of mannose trimming in diverting misfolded glycoproteins to proteasomal degradation has been produced in yeast (24Jakob C.A. Burda P. Roth J. Aebi M. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 142: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (303) Google Scholar) and in mammalian cells (25Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

To investigate how ER-synthesized proteins are diverted from retention into the degradative pathway, we compared the fate of Ig μ, J, and λ chains in assembly-deficient myeloma transfectants. These Ig subunits fold primarily under the assistance of BiP (30Haas I.G. Wabl M. Nature. 1983; 306: 387-389Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar, 31Bole D.G. Hendershot L.M. Kearney J.F. J.

Evidence is presented indicating that the trimming of the B branch terminal mannose by ER mannosidase I times the dislocation of μ and J chains from the ER lumen to the cytosol for proteasomal degradation, without the involvement of calnexin and/or calreticulin. NSO, a myeloma cell line that produces endogenous J chains but no heavy or light chains, and the transfectants expressing wild type secretory (μs) or membrane (μm) μ chains (N[μ1] and N[μm], respectively) or a mutant λ chain (N[λGly-214]), were described previously (34Sitia R.

Nature. 1974; 249: 45-47Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) was kindly provided by Dr. R. M. E. Parkhouse (Pirbright Laboratory, Surrey, UK). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse μ, goat anti-mouse Ig, and goat anti-rabbit Ig were from Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc. (Birmingham, AL). Purified rabbit anti-μ and anti-λ antibodies were obtained fromZymed Laboratories Inc. (San Francisco, CA). Dithiothreitol, leupeptin, N-ethylmaleimide, thapsigargin, and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma; the protease inhibitors Complete and endoglycosidase H were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals.

Phenylarsine oxide (Sigma) was used at 20–50 μm(26Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y. Sifers R.N. J. Biol.

Castanospermine and deoxynojirimycin (dN) were purchased from Sigma and used at the final concentration of 1 mm to inhibit glucosidases I and II. Kifunensine and swainsonine were purchased from Toronto Research Chemicals (Toronto, Canada), dissolved in water, and used at a final concentration of 2 μg/ml and 100 μm, respectively, to selectively block mannosidase I and mannosidase II, respectively (41Elbein A.D.

Biophys. 1996; 325: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). 1-deoxymannojirimicin (dM, Sigma) was used at 1 mm as an inhibitor of ER mannosidases I and II. The effects of kifunensine and swainsonine on the degradation and electrophoretic mobility of μ and J chains were similar when the drugs were added either before or immediately after the pulse. 2C. Fagioli and R. Sitia, unpublished observations. Therefore, to simplify the experimental procedures and to reduce variability in incorporation, cells were pulse-labeled in bulk and then aliquoted and chased with the different drugs. Pulse-chase assays were performed as previously described (21Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). In the experiment shown in Fig. 7, cells were chased in Krebs-Ringer Hepes medium (125 mm NaCl, 5 mmKCl, 1 mm Na2HPO4, 5.5 mm glucose, 25 mm Hepes, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 2% fetal calf serum, pH 7) supplemented with different concentrations of CaCl2 (3 μm–1 mm). Ionomycin was added at the final concentration of 1 μm. Films were scanned, and relevant bands were quantitated by ImageQuant software (Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA). Following extensive washings, immunoprecipitates on protein A beads were incubated overnight at 37 °C with jack bean α-mannosidase (Sigma) in 20 μl of 50 μm sodium citrate, pH 4.4 before boiling in sample buffer and electrophoresis. In the absence of λ chains, μs and J chains cannot assemble into transport-competent IgM polymers and are degraded by cytosolic proteasomes (21Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). When cells were pulse-labeled for a short period (5 min), a lag was evident before degradation ensued (Fig. 2, Aand C). During this period, both subunits undergo some folding, as determined by the formation of intrachain disulfide bonds 3A. Mezghrani, C. Fagioli, and R. Sitia, unpublished results. and, in the case of μ, by acquisition of partial protease resistance (21Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Changes in the electrophoretic mobility of μ chains were evident during the lag period (Fig. 2 A). These mobility shifts probably corresponded to glycan processing, because they were no longer detectable after treatment with endoglycosidase H (data not shown). In contrast, if N[μ1] cells were pulse-labeled for a long period (20 h) so as to label the whole intracellular pool, μ and J chain degradation could be observed immediately (Fig. 2, B andC), consistent with the fact that a fraction of the molecules had reached a degradation-competent state. Because some newly synthesized μ chains can be coprecipitated with calnexin and calreticulin (21Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), the effects described above could reflect a role of the two chaperones in μ chain quality control, as described for certain α1-antitrypsin mutants (23Liu Y. Choudhury P. Cabral C.M. Sifers R.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5861-5867Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). To verify this, the glucosidase inhibitor castanospermine was added before the pulse, so as to inhibit the rapid removal of glucose residues from newly made proteins. Consistent with the presence of additional glucoses, μ and J chains synthesized in the presence of castanospermine migrated more slowly (Fig.3 A). Under these conditions, μ chains were not coimmunoprecipitated by anti-calnexin antibodies (data not shown). Preventing the binding to calnexin and calreticulin, however, did not affect the kinetics of μ chain degradation; after the characteristic lag, clearance was efficient (Fig.3 B, lanes 1–4). Castanospermine also had little, if any, effect on the degradation of J chains (Fig. 3 C,lanes 2–5). Pre-treatment with castanospermine did not affect the dislocation of J chains, which can be monitored by the appearance of the two faster migrating bands (Fig. 3 C,>→ and ≫→) when cells are chased in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (21Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Similar amounts of cytosolic J chains accumulated in the presence or absence of castanospermine (Fig.3 C, compare lanes 1 and 9 and thehistograms below). These results indicated that calnexin and calreticulin do not play a major role in timing the degradation of the two Ig subunits. We therefore investigated other glycan processing steps known to occur in the ER lumen, in particular mannose trimming, which has been implicated in the quality control of mutated α1-antitrypsin (23Liu Y.

Inhibiting the activity of ER mannosidase I with kifunensine prevented the degradation of μ chains synthesized in the presence of castanospermine as efficiently as did proteasome inhibitors (Fig. 3 B, compare lanes 6 and 9). The simultaneous presence of kifunensine and castanospermine did not have synergistic effects (Fig. 3 B, lane 8). As shown in Fig. 3 C, kifunensine partially inhibited J chain degradation as well (see below). These results suggested that the trimming of the B branch mannose is important in timing the degradation of unassembled Ig subunits. To further confirm this, specific inhibitors of the main ER glycosidases were added after a 5-min pulse without castanospermine preincubation (Fig. 4). As observed above in castanospermine pre-treated cells, kifunensine was as effective as ZL3H in preventing the degradation of μ chains (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 2, 3, 6, and9). dM, an inhibitor of both ER mannosidase I and ER mannosidase II, also inhibited μ chain degradation (Fig.4 A, lane 17). In contrast, the ER mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine was not effective (Fig. 4 A, lane 12). Consistent with the presence of additional mannoses, μ chains accumulating in the presence of dM, kifunensine, or swainsonine migrated more slowly than those present in untreated cells (Fig.4 A, lane 2) or in cells incubated with proteasome inhibitors (lane 3). When both swainsonine and kifunensine were present during the chase, the effects of the ER mannosidase I inhibitor prevailed, and abundant μ chains accumulated intracellularly (Fig. 4 A, lane 22). The mobility shift was more pronounced than that induced by kifunensine or swainsonine alone. Densitometric quantitations (Fig. 4 A, seebars below each lane) confirmed that the removal of the terminal mannose from the central branch is crucial for the degradation of μ chains. Because the removal of mannoses may alter the substrate recognition by glucosidases and UDP-glucose: glycoprotein glucosyltransferase, it was possible that the drugs influenced the binding of μ chains to calnexin. To exclude this possibility, castanospermine or dN was added after the pulse so as to block glycans in a monoglucosylated state. The effects of castanospermine and dN were confirmed by the mobility shift of μ chains accumulating in treated cells (Fig. 4 A, compare lanes 18–20) and by mannosidase sensitivity assays (see Fig. 6 below). Under these experimental conditions, which should favor the binding of unfolded glycoproteins to calnexin and/or calreticulin (1Ellgaard L. Molinari M. Helenius A. Science. 1999; 286: 1882-1888Crossref PubMed Scopus (1064) Google Scholar), castanospermine and dN had minor effects on μ chain degradation. Analysis of the anti-J immunoprecipitates confirmed the role of mannose trimming in targeting unassembled Ig subunits to degradation. Castanospermine and dN had minor effects (Fig. 4 A,lanes 10, 18, 19). Kifunensine and dM inhibited the degradation of J chains, although to a lesser extent than μ chains. A single J chain band was precipitated from treated cells, with mobility slightly slower than the upper band accumulating in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (Fig.4 B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Inhibitors of ER mannosidase I prevented only in part the dislocation of J chains, as indicated by the appearance of the two bands with faster mobility, corresponding to deglycosylated, cytosolic J chains (21Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar), when proteasome inhibitors were added during the chase (Fig. 4 B, compare lanes 4–9). Therefore, glycan trimming is not essential for the dislocation of J chains. The differences between μ and J chains may reflect the number of N-glycans present on the two substrates and may correlate with our previous observation that some J but no μ chains can dislocate to the cytosol when proteasomal degradation is inhibited (21Mancini R. Fagioli C. Fra A.M. Maggioni C. Sitia R. FASEB J. 2000; 14: 769-778Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). To exclude the possibility that the different drugs acted on general cellular functions, we investigated their effects on λ, a nonglycosylated Ig subunit. Neither kifunensine nor castanospermine had any effect on the degradation of λG213, a mutant that is also degraded by proteasomes (Fig.5), albeit with slower kinetics than μ or J chains (36Reddy P. Sparvoli A. Fagioli C. Fassina G. Sitia R. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2077-2085Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar, 45O'Hare T. Wiens G.D. Whitcomb E.A. Enns C.A. Rittenberg M.B. J. Immunol. 1999; 163: 11-14PubMed Google Scholar). 4A. Sparvoli and R. Sitia, unpublished results. The presence of a terminal glucose on the A branch of an N-glycan can be monitored by a mannosidase sensitivity assay (46Cannon K.S. Helenius A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7537-7544Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). When the glucose is present (Fig. 1, G1), the mannosidase cannot remove the underlying mannoses, yielding a small mobility shift. In contrast, glycans lacking the glucose (see Fig. 1,G0) are digested to a greater extent. As expected, μ chains present in castanospermine-treated cells were only marginally affected by mannosidase (Fig.6 A, compare lanes 9 and 10). In contrast, ZL3H (Fig. 6 A, lanes 5 and 6) and kifunensine (lanes 7 and8) caused the accumulation of μ chains that were sensitive to the enzyme. Similarly, J chains appeared to be sensitive to mannosidase except after chase in the presence of castanospermine (Fig.6 B). μ and J chains accumulating in the presence of swainsonine (Fig. 6, A, lanes 11 and12 and B, lane 6) were largely resistant to mannosidase, suggesting that the presence of a terminal mannose on the C branch inhibits glucosidase activity on the two Ig subunits. The recent solution of the structure of yeast class I α1,2-mannosidase I revealed a crucial role for calcium ions in enzymatic activity (28Vallee F. Lipari F. Yip P. Sleno B. Herscovics A. Howell P.L. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 581-588Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Therefore, we investigated whether perturbing calcium homeostasis in the ER lumen affected μ chain degradation. As shown in Fig. 7, the ER Ca2+-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin caused the intracellular accumulation of μ chains, which migrated with a mobility slower than that of those present in untreated cells (Fig. 7, compare lanes 2 and 3). Similar to that reported above for kifunensine, thapsigargin also partially inhibited J chain degradation (data not shown). The requirements for calcium were further confirmed by chasing pulse-labeled N[μ1] cells with ionomycin and different Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 7, lanes 4–8). In the presence of the ionophore, the Ca2+ levels in the ER are expected to be similar to those in the extracellular medium. Based on this assumption, it would seem that 100 μmCa2+ is required to sustain the processes underlying μ chain degradation. The reduced degradation of μs in this experiment (Fig. 7, lane 2) could be due to the low extracellular Ca2+ concentration. Both substrates analyzed so far, μs and J chains, are soluble proteins retained in the ER lumen. It was of interest to analyze the role of glycan processing on an integral membrane protein. Alternate RNA processing generates two forms of μ chains, μs and μm, which differ only in their C-terminal ends (47Kehry M. Ewald S. Douglas R. Sibley C. Raschke W. Fambrough D. Hood L. Cell. 1980; 21: 393-406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar) and are degraded with similar kinetics (35Sitia R. Neuberger M.S. Milstein C. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 3969-3977Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Clearly, kifunensine prevented the degradation of membrane bound μ chains (Fig.8). Cytosolic proteasomes are responsible for the degradation of μm, because ZL3H caused their accumulation (Fig. 8, lane 11). Castanospermine had little, if any, effect on the clearance of membrane-bound μm chains (Fig. 8,lane 10). In the presence of λ chains, most μ chains synthesized by plasma cells are assembled into IgM polymers and secreted (34Sitia R. Neuberger M. Alberini C. Bet P. Fra A. Valetti C. Williams G. Milstein C. Cell. 1990; 60: 781-790Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). Only part of them, corresponding to molecules that fail to assemble with λ or to polymerize, are degraded (37Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). We therefore tested the effects of kifunensine and ZL3H on J[μ1] cells, which express μ, λ, and J chains. As shown in Fig. 9, kifunensine did not inhibit IgM secretion (compare lanes 5 and 6). The proteasome inhibitor ZL3H had only a marginal effect (Fig. 9, lane 7). Both kifunensine and ZL3H caused a small accumulation of intracellular μ chains (Fig. 9, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting that secretory μ chains that failed to polymerize were degraded by proteasomes. These results imply that the molecular mechanisms that recognize μ chains lacking the central mannose(s) and that divert them to proteasomal degradation are specific for structurally immature molecules (either unassembled or unpolymerized). We have previously shown that appending the transmembrane region of the TCR α chain to the C terminus of Ig μ and γ2b chains induces brefeldin A-insensitive degradation of chimeric immunoglobulins (37Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). When expressed in the absence of light chains in NSO, degradation of μ-TCR αTM was rapid. Unlike in the case of μs and μm chains, however, kifunensine did not alter the kinetics of μ-TCR αTM degradation (Fig.10 A). Thapsigargin failed to inhibit the proteasomal disposal of μ-TCR αTM as well (Fig.10 B), in agreement with the notion that Ca2+ is not required for the degradation of T cell receptor subunits (48Wileman T. Kane L.P. Carson G.R. Terhorst C. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 4500-4507Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, the proteasomal degradation of γ2b-TCR αTM chains, which occurs with kinetics slower than μ-TCR αTM (37Fra A.M. Fagioli C. Finazzi D. Sitia R. Alberini C.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4755-4761Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar), was insensitive to glycosidase inhibitors and thapsigargin (Fig. 10 C), suggesting that the extraction of these chimeric molecules follows a different pathway, independent from the activity of ER mannosidase I. It has been recently reported that inhibitors of tyrosine phosphatases, such as phenylarsine oxide prevent the degradation of certain α1-antitrypsin mutants (26Cabral C.M. Choudhury P. Liu Y.

NET1 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA whose activity has been implicated in stress fiber formation. In the Swiss 3T3 cell line, TGF-β induces NET1expression, and this correlated with an increase in stress fiber formation.

By using a stable cell line expressing dominant negative Smad3, we found that the Smad signaling pathway is essential for the induction of NET1, which in turn leads to the increase of Rho activity. Taken together, those data suggest that induction of NET1 is important for the increase of Rho activity upon TGF-β treatment, which may represent the critical trigger for a variety of downstream events in different cells.

One important but relatively unexplored pathway is the ability of TGF-β to modulate cell morphology and motility. Cell morphologic change and elevated migration in response to TGF-β have been observed in a number of cell types (5Oft M. Heider K.H. Beug H. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 1243-1252Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Oft M. Peli J. Rudaz C. Schwarz H. Beug H. Reichmann E.

Int. 1999; 23: 507-517Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar), but the mechanism underlying this TGF-β induced process remains largely unknown. Cell morphologic change and migration are processes that involve dynamic cytoskeleton reorganization. In addition to providing a structural framework around which cell shape and polarity are defined, actin cytoskeleton provides a driving force for the cells to move and to divide (10Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5167) Google Scholar). Recent works demonstrate that the Rho family of small GTPases are key regulatory molecules linking surface receptors to the organization of actin cytoskeleton (10Hall A.

The Rho family consists of Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 subfamilies. Among them, Rho is the molecular switch for stress fiber formation, and Rac and Cdc42 regulate lamellipodia and filopodia formation, respectively (10Hall A.

Rho GTPase can bind and hydrolyze guanosine nucleotides. The exchange of GDP for GTP results in a conformational change that unmasks structural domains involved in the binding of Rho to its downstream target proteins. This mechanism allows Rho GTPase to exchange between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound forms, a cycling process that is regulated by three main classes of proteins as follows: 1) guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), which stimulate the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, leading to activation of GTPase; 2) GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which promote the inactivation of GTPase by increasing the rate of GTP hydrolysis; and 3) GDP dissociation inhibitors (GDIs), which can inhibit the dissociation of GDP from the GTPase, thus keeping GTPase in an inactive state (10Hall A. Science. 1998; 279: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (5167) Google Scholar, 11Aspenstrom P. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1999; 11: 95-102Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar,17Van Aelst L. D'Souza-Schorey C. Genes Dev. 1997; 11: 2295-2322Crossref PubMed Scopus (2082) Google Scholar). Although TGF-β can induce cell morphologic change and stress fiber formation, it is still unclear how the TGF-β signal regulates these pathways. To understand better the mechanism by which TGF-β modulates the change in cell morphology, in this study we used a microarray system to search for candidate genes associated with this TGF-β-dependent activity. We found one gene in particular, NET1, whose mRNA and protein levels increase upon treatment with TGF-β. NET1 is a specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for RhoA (18Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). By increasing RNA and protein levels of NET1, more RhoA may be in its GTP-bound active state to induce stress fiber formation. Furthermore, the expression of NET1 appears to be controlled by Smads, as the presence of a dominant negative form of Smad3 blocks the TGF-β-mediated induction of NET1. Our results suggest that NET1 may be a critical link between the activation of RhoA and the TGF-β and Smad-dependent induction of stress fiber formation.

In the spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, TGF-β treatment leads to a dramatic morphologic change after 24 h (Fig. 1,A and B). Contrary to the normal compact appearance for keratinocytes, TGF-β treatment leads to a bigger and less compact cell shape in HaCaT cells. In addition, TGF-β-treated cells have significantly more membrane ruffling compared with untreated cells (data not shown). When cells were treated with cycloheximide, a protein synthesis inhibitor, the dramatic morphologic change of HaCaT cells induced by TGF-β was no longer observed (Fig. 1 C). Since cycloheximide blocks protein synthesis, the result suggests that TGF-β may cause morphologic change of these cells through inducing the expression of certain TGF-β downstream target genes. To better understand how TGF-β modulates cell morphology and to identify downstream genes critical for this process, we performed experiments using a microarray system containing about 600 genes. mRNA extracted from treated and untreated HaCaT cells were reverse-transcribed and hybridized with the microarray system. In the samples treated with TGF-β for 1 h, several genes were found to be significantly up-regulated (data not shown). Among these genes, several of them (e.g.c-jun and junB) have been previously reported (20Pertovaara L. Sistonen L. Bos T.J. Vogt P.K. Keski-Oja J. Alitalo K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 1255-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar, 21Li L. Hu J.-S. Olson E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1556-1562Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One novel gene that fit our search criteria wasNET1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that was previously shown to increase specifically the activity of the small GTPase RhoA (18Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In other studies, NET1 was isolated in a yeast two-hybrid screen using RhoA as bait, and overexpressed NET1 was shown to transform NIH 3T3 cells, cause stress fiber formation, and lead to JNK activation (22Chan A.M. Takai S. Yamada K. Miki T. Oncogene. 1996; 12: 1259-1266PubMed Google Scholar). We next performed RPA to confirm the up-regulation of NET1messenger RNA levels by TGF-β. HaCaT cells, grown in both serum-starved and normal serum conditions, were treated with TGF-β for different times, and total RNA samples were extracted. As shown in Fig. 2, A and B, TGF-β induced the expression of NET1 mRNA in both serum-free and normal serum conditions. The induction started at 30 min following TGF-β treatment and peaked at 2 h. As a positive control, the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDKI) p15 was also induced by TGF-β treatment (23Li J.-M. Nichols M.A. Chandrasekharan S. Xiong Y. Wang X.-F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 26750-26753Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar) but with slower kinetics. Consistent with an increase in mRNA level, NET1 protein levels were also increased in TGF-β-treated cells (Fig. 2 C). To test if NET1 expression is subject to TGF-β-mediated regulation in a broader range of cell types, we examined several other TGF-β-responsive cell lines for an increase in NET1mRNA expression. As shown in Fig.3 A, human lung carcinoma A549 and human diploid fibroblast BJ cell lines were found to increaseNET1 expression after 2 h of TGF-β treatment. A more moderate level of induction of NET1 expression was also observed in a mouse fibroblast cell line, Swiss 3T3, after 2 h of TGF-β treatment (Fig. 3 B). The human pancreatic carcinoma cell line, PANC-1, was found to express NET1 at a very low basal level, and it is not further induced by TGF-β (Fig.3 A). Taken together, we conclude that the up-regulation ofNET1 expression by TGF-β is not restricted to the human keratinocyte HaCaT cells, but instead is a general response shared by other TGF-β-responsive cell lines. As a guanine exchange factor, NET1 is known for its specific activity toward RhoA (18Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Since RhoA activity is critical in modulating the process of stress fiber formation and up-regulation of NET1 expression is likely to increase RhoA activity, we decided to investigate the role of NET1 in TGF-β-mediated stress fiber formation in a suitable system. We examined the cell lines in which NET1 is induced by TGF-β to see if TGF-β could also enhance stress fiber formation in these cells. In HaCaT, A549, and PANC-1 cells, stress fibers were difficult to visualize both before and after TGF-β treatment. A significant amount of stress fiber was seen in BJ fibroblast cells, but the basal level of stress fiber was too high to allow an assessment of the TGF-β effect on the process in these fibroblasts even with 2 days of growing the cells under serum-starved conditions. Finally, we found the Swiss 3T3 cell line to be an ideal model system for this study. As shown in Fig. 4 A, upon TGF-β treatment for 30 min, a significant nuclear accumulation of two effector proteins of the TGF-β signaling pathway, Smad2 and Smad3, was observed, suggesting that those cells are responsive to TGF-β treatment and the TGF-β-Smad signaling pathway is intact. In normal serum-containing media, the presence of high levels of stress fibers in Swiss 3T3 cells was probably due to the activation of RhoA pathway by various growth factors in the serum. In contrast, a much lower level of stress fibers was seen when the cells were cultured in medium without serum for 48 h and stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin (Fig.4 B). After TGF-β was added into the medium and incubated for 4 h prior to staining, a dramatic increase in stress fiber formation was observed with phalloidin staining (Fig. 4 B). The formation of stress fibers could be observed as early as 2 h post-TGF-β treatment. Since overexpression of NET1 was previously shown to be sufficient to cause stress fiber formation, it is possible that NET1 serves as a link between the activation of TGF-β signaling pathway and the activation of RhoA and consequently stress fiber formation. To test this, we first determined if overproduction of NET1 could also lead to stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 cells. We constructed expression plasmids containing either a FLAG-tagged wild typeNET1 or a mutant NET1 with a point mutation on the conserved Dbl domain (L392E) which abolishes its guanine exchange activity toward RhoA. The two constructs express equal amounts of NET1 protein in transfected COS cells, as shown by Western blot analysis on Fig. 5 A. We then introduced the NET1 constructs by transient transfection into Swiss 3T3 cells and subsequently stained cells with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the NET1 wild type construct-transfected cells, indicated by the co-transfected GFP marker, have significantly more stress fibers when compared with the surrounding non-transfected cells or GFP alone-transfected cells, suggesting that increased expression of NET1 is sufficient to cause enhancement of stress fiber formation in Swiss 3T3 cells. TGF-β treatment did not lead to further increase in stress fiber formation (data not shown). Most important, transfection of the cells with the mutant NET1 construct led to significantly less stress fibers upon TGF-β treatment (Fig. 5 C), suggesting that the function of NET1 is critical in the TGF-β-mediated stress fiber formation.Figure 5NET1 is critical in TGF-β-mediated stress fiber formation. A, FLAG-tagged NET1 constructs, both the wild type and the mutant, were transfected into COS cells using a DEAE-dextran method. Two days after transfection, total cell lysates were made and analyzed by Western blot using a α-FLAG antibody lane 1, no transfection; lane 2, wild type-NET1; and lane 3, mutant NET1). B, wild type NET1 construct was transfected into Swiss 3T3 cells using the LipofectAMINE Plus kit (Life Technologies, Inc.). 12 h after transfection, cells were switched to serum-free medium for 48 h. Cells were stained with rhodamine-labeled phalloidin after the treatment as in Fig.4 B. Pictures were taken in both green channel (for GFP) and red channel (for rhodamine). Arrowsindicate transfected cells (shown by GFP staining). Pictures from thegreen channel are shown on the left side, and the same views from red channel are on the right side. C, NET1 mutant construct was transfected into Swiss 3T3 cells as in B. Cells were treated with TGF-β for 4 h following the 48-h serum starvation. Pictures were taken in both green channel and red channel as inB. Left row of photos were taken ingreen channel and identical views from redchannel were shown on the right. White arrowsindicate transfected cell (shown by GFP staining). D, as in Fig. 4 B, serum-starved Swiss 3T3 cells were treated with TGF-β in the presence of a Rho kinase inhibitor, Y27632. Staining was performed as in Fig. 4 B.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To confirm the involvement of RhoA in TGF-β-mediated stress fiber formation, we used a specific inhibitor Y27632 for Rho kinase (ROCK), a Rho downstream kinase that is required for RhoA-mediated stress fiber formation. We found that Y-27632 potently inhibited TGF-β-dependent stress fiber formation (Fig.5 D). Taken together, our results suggest that in Swiss 3T3 cells NET1 induction is both necessary and sufficient for stress fiber formation to occur, probably through increasing RhoA activity. As transcription factors, Smad proteins have been shown to mediate the transcriptional activation of a number of TGF-β target genes. To determine if Smads are also involved in the induction of NET1 by TGF-β, we took advantage of a HaCaT stable cell line that overexpresses a Smad3 dominant negative mutant (D407E). Earlier studies indicated that the phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 and Smad3, as well as the inhibition of cell proliferation, in response to TGF-β treatment was significantly blocked in this cell line (19Goto D. Yagi K. Inoue H. Iwamoto I. Kawabata M. Miyazono K. Kato M. FEBS Lett. 1998; 430: 201-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). To test if TGF-β is capable of inducing the expression ofNET1 in this cell line, we performed RPA analysis. As shown in Fig. 6 A, the induction ofNET1 in the Smad3D407E cell line was significantly lower than that of the control HaCaT cell line after TGF-β treatment for 2 h. As a demonstration for the inhibition of Smad activity, the phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 in response to TGF-β was shown to be blocked significantly in Smad3D407E by using a phospho-specific antibody against Smad2 (Fig. 6 B). To test if the inhibition of Smad signaling and induction ofNET1 by TGF-β lead to changes in downstream signaling, we next studied whether the activation of Rho is altered in Smad3D407E stable line. To do this, we used a serum-responsive element luciferase reporter (SRE-luc) that has been used previously for assaying Rho activity. As shown in Fig. 6 C, TGF-β treatment for 24 h leads to a 10-fold induction of the SRE reporter gene in the control HaCaT cell line, indicating that a significant increase in Rho activity was induced by TGF-β. Similar activation of Rho also occurred in control stable line HaCaT-pCDNA3. However, in the Smad3D407E cell line, it was unchanged upon TGF-β treatment, suggesting that Rho activity may not be affected by TGF-β treatment in the absence of functional Smads and the induction of NET1. As a multifunctional growth factor, TGF-β regulates a wide range of biological processes, including cell morphologic change and migration, likely through the modulation of expression of downstream target genes. To explore the signaling pathway that may mediate the specific effect of TGF-β on changes in stress fiber formation, we have identified the NET1 gene as a candidate target gene whose function may be important for this TGF-β-induced process. We have demonstrated that NET1, a specific GEF for RhoA, is rapidly induced by TGF-β in several TGF-β-responsive cell lines. In Swiss 3T3 cells, TGF-β induces the formation of stress fibers in a RhoA-dependent manner, a process correlated with the induction of NET1 expression. To test if this increased expression of NET1 is functionally important for TGF-β-regulated stress fiber formation, we overexpressed a dominant negative NET1 mutant in Swiss 3T3 cells and found that it could block stress fiber formation induced by TGF-β. These results, together with previous findings that implicate NET1 as an activator of RhoA, support a model that TGF-β-dependentNET1 induction could lead to the activation of RhoA, which in turn causes increased stress fiber formation. Although NET1 is the first gene so far identified in TGF-β signaling pathway whose function may be directly associated with the process of cytoskeletal reorganization, we suspect that there may be other related genes that can mediate the TGF-β effect involved in the regulation of cell motility and morphologic changes. For example, we have found that NET1 expression is not induced in primary mouse fibroblasts (data not shown), even though TGF-β has an effect on the migration of those cells, a process that involves dynamic cytoskeletal change. This observation suggests that TGF-β may use alternative pathways to activate RhoA, as small GTP-binding proteins could be regulated by GEFs, GAPs, and GDIs. It is likely that in different cell types, different GEFs, or GAPs and GDIs serve as targets that can be regulated by the TGF-β signaling pathway. On the other hand, activation of stress fiber formation may not be the only function of NET1 induction. Consistent with this notion, we failed to observe significant increases in stress fiber formation in certain types of cells, such as HaCaT cells that showed a dramatic NET1 induction in response to TGF-β treatment. One possible consequence of NET1 induction is the activation of the JNK pathway, as a previous report demonstrated that overexpression of NET1 could lead to JNK activation (18Alberts A.S. Treisman R. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 4075-4085Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). JNK activation by TGF-β has been reported to occur in various cell types (24Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar, 25Hocevar B.A. Brown T.L. Howe P.H. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 1345-1356Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In one recent study, TGF-β was found to induce JNK activation in a two-wave kinetic manner as JNK kinase activity peaked at an early time point (10 min) and a late time point (12 h) following TGF-β treatment (24Engel M.E. McDonnell M.A. Law B.K. Moses H.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37413-37420Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (429) Google Scholar). Although the pathway by which JNK is activated by TGF-β remains unknown, it was speculated that the immediate-early phase of JNK activation is probably a process independent of Smad proteins, known effectors of the TGF-β signaling pathway involved in transcription regulation of target genes, whereas the later phase of induction is Smad-dependent. Thus, the ability of NET1 to activate JNK pathway may provide a possible link between TGF-β and the later phase of JNK activation. From the rapid time course of NET1 mRNA accumulation (Fig. 2 A), we noticed a close correlation between the induction of NET1 expression and the known kinetics of phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of Smad2 and Smad3 (26Yingling J.M.

Frederick J.P. Wang X.-F. Mol. Bio. Cell. 1998; 9: 3309-3319Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). To examine if NET1 serves as one of the direct target genes for these two Smads, we used recombinant adenoviruses to determine if Smad3 and Smad4 overexpression would be able to stimulate the expression of the endogenous NET1 gene. The result was negative (data not shown), suggesting that Smad overexpression may not be sufficient to activate the expression of NET1, and other signaling events may have to be initiated by the TGF-β receptor complex simultaneously. Alternatively, the overexpression of Smad proteins clearly may not accurately reflect the signaling process of Smad activation and action. To explore this possible link further, we have used a HaCaT stable line overexpressing Smad3D407E, a mutant that can block the phosphorylation of endogenous Smad2 and Smad3 upon TGF-β treatment. The induction of NET1 in Smad3D407E cells was dramatically decreased in comparison to that of normal HaCaT cells, suggesting that Smads are essential for NET1 induction. The detailed mechanism for the Smad-mediated transcriptional regulation of NET1 expression will have to be revealed with the cloning and characterization of the NET1 promoter in the future.

Pelliniemi L.J. Lendahl U. Virtanen I. Eriksson J.E. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 243-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Upon differentiation, nestin expression is down-regulated and replaced by other tissue-specific IF proteins, such as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in astrocytes, neurofilaments in neurons, and desmin in muscle tissue, respectively. Interestingly, nestin expression is reinduced during various regenerative and degenerative conditions in the fully differentiated organism (6Frisen J. Johansson C.B. Török C. Risling M. Lendahl U.

Cell Res. 1994; 214: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Based on these observations, a possible copolymerization of nestin and the class III IF proteins, has been postulated. Recent data showed that nestin fails to assemble into filaments in the absence of a coexpressed IF network in astrocytes (9Eliasson C. Sahlgren C., M. Berthold C.-L. Stakeberg J. Celis J.E.

In addition, it was recently shown that nestin cannot polymerize on its own but is integrated into type III IFs, most likely as a heterodimer (10Steinert P.M. Chou Y.H. Prahlad V.

In light of the fact that nestin is expressed particularly in dynamic cells, it is of interest to study posttranslational modifications of nestin and the involvement of such modifications in regulating nestin organization. Intermediate filament proteins form dynamic structures that change their intracellular organization during various conditions, such as mitosis, differentiation, and different pathological situations (reviewed in Refs. 11Geisler N.

BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar). The role of phosphorylation in regulating IF organization is supported by studies showing that several kinases, including protein kinase C, cAMP-dependent kinase, Ca2+-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase, and cdc2 kinase, induce disassembly of IFs in vitro (18Inagaki M. Matsuoka Y. Tsujimura K. Ando S. Tokui T. Takahashi T. Inagaki N. BioEssays. 1996; 18: 481-487Crossref Scopus (160) Google Scholar, 19Ando S. Tokui T. Yano T. Inagaki M. Biochem. Biophys. Res.

Phosphorylation may also be involved in regulating the specific cellular distribution of IFs, as demonstrated by the preferential localization of phosphorylated neurofilaments in axons (32Sternberger L.A.

In addition to changes in IF protein phosphorylation during mitosis, there appears to be a continuous phosphate turnover on IFs in interphase, which could be involved in regulating the dynamic properties of IFs in interphase cells (13Ku N.-O.

In view of the previous observations on mitotic vimentin phosphorylation by cdc2, we have characterized the role of cdc2 kinase in regulating nestin organization during mitosis in an immortalized central nervous system precursor rat cell line, ST15A. In addition, we have identified Thr316 as an in vitro cdc2-specific nestin phosphorylation site. We have generated a phospho-specific nestin antibody against the phosphorylated Thr316 peptide to characterize phosphorylation of nestin at this site in vivo. The phosphorylation of this site is elevated during mitosis but also shows a certain degree of constitutive phosphorylation in interphase cells.RESULTSThe mitotic process involves reorganization of cytoskeletal structures including the cytoplasmic and nuclear IFs. Because nestin is expressed predominantly in cells that undergo mitosis or rapidly change morphology, we examined the regulation of nestin morphology and organization in comparison with the well characterized class III IF protein vimentin in a rat immortalized central nervous system precursor cell line, ST15A, during different stages of the cell cycle.Morphological Changes of Nestin Organization during Interphase-Mitosis TransitionDuring interphase, ST15A cells contained IF networks that extended from the perinuclear region to the cell surface. Nestin and vimentin formed indistinguishable networks in these cells, as demonstrated by double label confocal microscopy (Fig.2, A, B,K, L, and M). During the transition from late prophase to metaphase, the IF network was reorganized into cage-like structures surrounding the nucleus (Fig. 2, D andE). Nestin and vimentin networks underwent identical changes during mitosis. The colocalization of nestin and vimentin persisted throughout the cell cycle. During telophase, nestin and vimentin showed a more diffuse and much less intense fluorescence in the cleavage furrow, indicating a possible disassembly of the IF networks at this site (Fig. 2, G and H).IF networks show variable behavior in different cell types during mitosis. In some cell types a cage of IF is maintained around the nucleus, whereas in other cell types IFs break down or disassemble with a simultaneous increase in the solubility of the IF proteins. It was, therefore, of interest to determine the solubility state of the IF proteins in mitotic ST15A cells. Detergent extractions of control and nocodazole-treated ST15A cells were centrifuged at different speeds to obtain three different fractions: an insoluble fraction after 10,000 × g and soluble and insoluble fractions after 200,000 × g. Immunoblotting of the fractions demonstrated that most of the protein stays as filaments (insoluble fraction after 10,000 × g) in nocodazole-treated cells. However, there was an increase in the soluble fraction after centrifugation at 200,000 × g (Fig.3), indicating the presence of disassembled soluble subunits. Note the presence of the lower molecular mass protein bands, representing cleaved forms of nestin. The intensity of these bands increases in the soluble fractions of nocodazole-treated cells, indicating a possible processing of nestin during mitosis.Figure 3The effect of the mitotic arrest on the assembly state of nestin. Blocking ST15A cells in mitosis with nocodazole increases the solubility of nestin. The figure shows immunoblotting of Triton-X- insoluble fraction after 10,000 ×g, insoluble and soluble fractions after 200,000 ×g of control, and nocodazole-treated ST15A cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Mitotic Phosphorylation of Nestin Is Mediated by cdc2 KinaseThe mitotic reorganization of the cytoplasmic IF networks in many cell types is known to be regulated by phosphorylation of the IF proteins. Therefore, the phosphorylation state of nestin in ST15A cells during interphase-mitosis transition was examined. The mitotic reorganization of the cytoplasmic IF networks in ST15A cells was accompanied by an increase in the phosphorylation levels of the IF proteins, nestin and vimentin (Fig.4 A). In accordance with previous studies (24Chou Y.-H. Rosevear E. Goldman R.D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1885-1889Crossref PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 25Chou Y.-H. Bischoff J.R. Beach D. Goldman R.D. Cell. 1990; 62: 1063-1071Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar), vimentin showed a low level of constitutive phosphorylation, which was elevated 6-fold in mitotic cells (Fig.4 A, left panel). In comparison with vimentin, nestin had a higher level of constitutive phosphorylation in interphase cells and showed a 3-fold increase in the phosphorylation level during mitosis (Fig. 4 A, right panel). In addition to the ∼220-kDa nestin band, immunoprecipitation with the nestin antibody also yielded lower molecular mass bands. These bands were weakly phosphorylated in control cells and showed increased phosphorylation in nocodazole-treated cells. They most likely represent cleaved forms of nestin, because immunoblotting of IF preparations from ST15A cells (Fig. 1) and whole cell extracts of ST15A cells (data not shown) using antibodies against nestin shows the presence of corresponding bands. Phosphoamino acid analysis of nestin immunoprecipitated from in vivo 32P-labeled mitotic ST15A cells showed phosphorylation of nestin at serine and threonine residues (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4In vivo phosphorylation of nestin and vimentin during interphase and mitosis. A, autoradiograph of a SDS 7.5% polyacrylamide gel of nestin and vimentin immunoprecipitated from in vivo 32P-labeled interphase (lanes C) and nocodazole-treated (lanes noc) ST15A cells shows increased phosphorylation of nestin and vimentin during mitosis. Nestin is constitutively phosphorylated during interphase but shows in average a 2.8-fold increase in phosphorylation in mitotic cells (mean value ± S.D.; experimental data from a minimum of three experiments). The increase in the phosphorylation of mitotic vimentin is 6.2-fold (mean value ± S.D.). Equal loading of proteins was controlled by silver staining (data not shown).B, nestin is phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2. IF preparations from ST15A cells were phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2 and separated by SDS-PAGE. The autoradiograph shows phosphorylation of nestin as well as vimentin and the lamins (double band at 60 kDa). C, nestin is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues in mitotic cells as shown by phosphoamino acid analysis of nestin immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled nocodazole-arrested ST15A cells (Nestin (noc)). Phosphoamino acid analysis of nestin phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2 phosphorylated nestin shows that cdc2-specific phosphorylation of nestin occurs on serine and threonine (Nestin (cdc2)).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)cdc2 kinase is involved in the mitotic phosphorylation and consequent reorganization of various IF networks in different cell lines (13Ku N.-O.

When IF preparations from ST15A cells were treated with cdc2 kinase, nestin, vimentin, and the nuclear lamins were phosphorylated (Fig. 4 B) (also see 25, 30). The in vitrophosphorylation of nestin occurred on serine and threonine residues (Fig. 4 C).Comparative phosphopeptide mapping of nestin immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled interphase and mitotic ST15A cells (Fig.5) showed five mitosis-specific phosphopeptides (phosphopeptides 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6). There were also interphase-specific phosphopeptides (phosphopeptides 7, 8, and 9), and one phosphopeptide that was present in both interphase and mitotic preparations (5Fröjdman K. Pelliniemi L.J. Lendahl U. Virtanen I. Eriksson J.E. Differentiation. 1997; 61: 243-249Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although not obvious from Fig. 5, which does not give a quantititative presentation of the relative labeling intensity on interphase versus mitotic peptides, peptide 5 showed consistently elevated phosphorylation in mitotic preparations as compared with interphase samples. According to quantification by phosphoimager image analysis, the relative increase (mitosis/interphase) was 1.9-fold ± 0.3 (mean ± range of values; measurements made on peptide maps obtained from five different experiments). The mitosis-specific phosphopeptides 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 corresponded to cdc2-specific tryptic phosphopeptides (Fig. 5). The identity of the individual peptides was confirmed by parallel chromatography of mixed samples (data not shown). The relative dominance of the mitotic peptides that correlated to peptides phosphorylated by cdc2 in vitro, indicated that cdc2-mediated phosphorylation sites are likely to regulate nestin organization during mitosis. These results identify nestin as a physiological substrate for cdc2 kinase and suggest that this kinase is involved in the mitotic reorganization of nestin.Figure 5Comparative phosphopeptide mapping ofin vitro and on vivo phosphorylated nestin. Two-dimensional tryptic peptide maps of nestin immunoprecipitated from metabolically labeled interphase cells (I (in vivo)) or nocodazole-arrested mitotic cells (M (in vitro)). Tryptic phosphopeptide maps of mitotic nestin show five (phosphopeptides 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) mitosis-specific peptides. In addition phosphorylation of peptide 5 is increased during mitosis. Comparative tryptic phosphopeptide mapping of nestin phosphorylatedin vivo during mitosis (M (in vivo)) and in vitro with cdc2 (cdc2(in vitro)) indicates that nestin is phopshorylated by cdc2 during mitosis. Numbers indicate corresponding peptides.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Identification of cdc2-specific Phosphorylation Sites on NestinTo determine cdc2-specific phosphoamino acid residues on nestin, ST15A IF preparations phosphorylated by cdc2 in vitro were run on SDS gels, from which the phosphorylated nestin was cut out and further digested with trypsin. The resulting32P-labeled tryptic peptides were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC. Radioactive fractions (radioactive peaks 1–7) were sequenced and subjected to manual Edman degradation to determine the cycle at which the radiolabel is released. The nestin-peptide sequence316LQTPGR was obtained by successful sequencing of radioactive peak 1. Manual Edman degradation of the fraction confirmed phosphorylation of the peptide on the third amino acid, corresponding to the threonine residue (Thr316) of the sequence obtained (Fig. 6). Sequencing of the other32P peaks observed in the graph were not successful, because of the impurity of the fractions. Nestin is a very large protein (>1800 amino acids), and cleaving nestin with trypsin generated too many peptides to allow for sufficient purification of all phosphopeptides by the techniques we used.Figure 6Identification of nestin Thr316as an in vitro cdc2-specific phosphorylation site. Nestin phosphorylated in vitro by cdc2 was trypsinized, and phosphopeptides were fractionated by reverse phase HPLC. 32P-containing fractions were collected separately and further purified by a second run. Radioactive fractions were collected, and the amino acid sequence of the tryptic peptide was determined. Peak 1 yielded the peptide sequence LQTPGR. This sequence correspond to the nestin sequence starting at amino acid 314 at the end of the rod domain. The fraction was further subjected to manual Edman degradation to confirm phosphorylation of the threonine residue.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Because in vitro phosphorylated sites may not reflect the real phosphorylation sites in vivo, a polyclonal phosphospecific nestin antibody, anti-phospho-Thr316nestin, was generated to characterize phosphorylation of nestin at this site in vivo. The antibody showed high specificity against the phosphopeptide used for immunization, as compared with unphosphorylated peptide (Fig.7 A). The affinity purified antibody recognized the full-length nestin protein (∼220 kDa) (Fig.7 B, first panel). In addition, the antibody showed strong immunoreactivity against a ∼175-kDa band and weak reactivity against several bands of lower molecular mass (Fig.7 B, first panel). This ladder pattern can be seen on Western blots using several different nestin antibodies at high concentration, Most likely the pattern of fragmented protein represents processing products of nestin. This kind of fragmentation is seen in nestin in vivo preparations from many different cell types. 2C. M. Sahlgren and J. E. Eriksson, unpublished observations. Western blot of whole cell extracts of nocodazole-treated and control cells using a polyclonal nestin antibody raised against the carboxyl terminus of nestin (rabbit anti-nestin 6) showed a similar pattern (Fig.7 B, third panel). The polyclonal antibody recognized the ∼175-kDa band in addition to prominent immunoreactivity against the ∼220-kDa band (Fig. 7 B,third panel). Immunoblotting of whole cell extract of ST15A cells with a monoclonal nestin antibody also gives immunoreactivity at ∼175 kDa (Fig. 7 B, fourth panel).Figure 7Characterization of nestin phosphorylation at Thr316 in vivo. A phosphopeptide-specific antibody against phosphorylated Thr316 was generated. A, immunoblotting of 0.5 μg of the Thr316 phosphorylated and unphosphorylated peptide spotted on nitrocellulose membrane revealed specificity of the generated antibody. The antibody recognizes the phophorylated peptide but shows no immunoreactivity against the unphosphorylated peptide.B, based on immunoblotting of control and nocodazole-treated cells, nestin is constitutively phosphorylated at this site during interphase, but the phosphorylation level is increased during mitosis. The phospho-specific peptide antibody shows strong immunoreactivity against a ∼175-kDa nestin peptide, in addition to reactivity against the full-length ∼220-kDa nestin (P-thr-316 nestin). The same samples were immunoblotted with a polyclonal nestin antibody (anti-nestin 6) to confirm the identity of the ∼175-kDa band (polyclonal anti-nestin). Immunoblotting of whole cell extracts of ST15A cells with a monoclonal nestin antibody also showed the presence of the ∼175-kDa peptide (monoclonal anti-nestin). Preincubating the antibody with the phosphorylated peptide abolished immunoreactivity against the ∼220-kDa band and the lower molecular mass band of ∼ 175 kDa (P-thr-316 nestin + p-peptide). The additional low molecular bands seen on the blot were still visible when the antibody was preincubated with excess of the phosphorylated peptide. Equal numbers of control and nocodazole-treated cells were harvested, and equal loading of proteins was further controlled by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (data not shown). C, immunoblotting of in vitrocdc2-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated IF preparations shows that cdc2 kinase increases phosphorylation at Thr316.D, double immunofluorescence labeling of ST15A cells with the Thr316-nestin phosphopeptide-specific antibody and monoclonal nestin antibody. Immunofluorescence labeling of interphase ST15A cells with the nestin phosphopeptide specific antibody (panel a) shows a fragmented pattern along the filaments. The intensity of the staining is increased in mitotic cells. As comparison, panel b shows labeling with the monoclonal nestin antibody, where the labeling in interphase versusmitotic cells is of similar intensity. Panel c shows labeling of ST15A cells with a phosphopeptide antibody which recognizes vimentin when phosphorylated on the major cdc2-specific site, Ser55. Panel d shows the whole vimentin IF network as revealed by a monoclonal vimentin antibody. Immunoreactivity of the vimentin phosphopeptide-specific antibody is absent in interphase cells.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res"

The oxygen sensing and signaling mechanisms in eukaryotic cells are not fully understood. To further define these processes, we have studied the Δ9 fatty acid desaturase gene OLE1 inSaccharomyces cerevisiae. We have confirmed previous data showing that the expression of OLE1 mRNA is increased in hypoxia and in the presence of certain transition metals.OLE1 expression was also increased in the presence of the iron chelator 1,10-phenanthroline. A 142-base pair (bp) region 3′ to the previously identified fatty acid response element was identified as critical for the induction of OLE1 in response to these stimuli using OLE1 promoter-lacZ reporter constructs. Electromobility shift assays confirmed the presence of an inducible band shift in response to hypoxia and cobalt. Mutational analysis defined the nonameric sequence ACTCAACAA as necessary for transactivation. A 20-base pair oligonucleotide containing this nonamer confers up-regulation by hypoxia and inhibition by unsaturated fatty acids when placed upstream of a heterologous promoter in alacZ reporter construct. Additional yeast genes were identified which respond to hypoxia and cobalt in a manner similar toOLE1. A number of mammalian genes are also up-regulated by hypoxia, cobalt, nickel, and iron chelators.

A number of mammalian genes are also up-regulated by hypoxia, cobalt, nickel, and iron chelators. Hence, the identification of a family of yeast genes regulated in a similar manner has implications for understanding oxygen sensing and signaling in eukaryotes. Regardless of an organism's complexity, its ability to adapt to changes in environmental oxygen tension is critical to its survival. In many circumstances, the adaptive response to low oxygen tension requires alterations in the expression of specific genes. In mammals, genes encoding proteins such as erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor, critical molecules in system-wide functions such as erythropoiesis and blood vessel formation, respectively, were among the first shown to be regulated by hypoxia (reviewed in Refs. 1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar and 2Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The regulation of these genes by hypoxia has served as a paradigm for the subsequent identification of hypoxia-regulated genes involved in basic intracellular metabolic and biochemical pathways. For example, the hypoxia responsiveness of genes involved in sugar transport (e.g. GLUT1 and GLUT3) and energy production (e.g. genes encoding certain glycolytic enzymes) is mediated by hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1),1 the same transcription factor that plays a critical role in erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor activation in response to low oxygen tension (3Levy A.P. Levy N.S. Wegner S. Goldberg M.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 13333-13340Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar, 4Semenza G.L. Wang G.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 5447-5454Crossref PubMed Scopus (2209) Google Scholar). HIF-1 is a heterodimeric protein comprised of an α and β subunit, both of which are basic helix-loop-helix proteins in the PAS family of transcription factors. The previously identified β subunit is ARNT, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator. ARNT mRNA and protein levels are not significantly affected by ambient oxygen tension. In contrast, although HIF-1α mRNA levels are not appreciably affected by oxygen tension, HIF-1α protein is only minimally present in normoxia, being rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway in this condition. However, HIF-1α accumulates in response to hypoxia, certain transition metals (e.g. cobalt and nickel), and iron chelators such as desferrioxamine. Once the heterodimer is formed under these conditions, it can interact with other DNA-binding proteins (such as HNF4) which function in part to provide tissue and developmental specificity (reviewed in Refs. 1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar and 2Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIF-1 has also been shown to associate with scaffold proteins such as p300/CBP (5Arany Z. Huang L.E. Eckner R. Bhattacharya S. Jiang C. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. Livingston D.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 12969-12973Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar), which have been shown to interact with the basal transcription machinery (6Yuan W. Condorelli G. Caruso M. Felsani A. Giordano A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 9009-9013Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (277) Google Scholar, 7Kwok R.P. Lundblad J.R. Chrivia J.C. Richards J.P. Bachinger H.P. Brennan R.G. Roberts S.G. Green M.R. Goodman R.H. Nature. 1994; 370: 223-226Crossref PubMed Scopus (1282) Google Scholar). The interactions between the proteins in this complex have been the focus of several investigators, and have been reviewed previously (reviewed in Ref. 2Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Although a substantial understanding of the structure and function of HIF-1α exists, the mechanism by which mammalian cells sense hypoxia remains poorly defined. In certain prokaryotes, a heme protein has been shown to serve as an oxygen sensor (reviewed in Refs. 1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar and 8Gilles-Gonzalez M.A. Ditta G.S. Helinski D.R. Nature. 1991; 350: 170-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar). Evidence supports the role for a heme protein in mammalian oxygen sensing as well (9Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Certain transition metals such as cobalt and nickel appear to mimic hypoxia and induce several hypoxia-regulated genes. It has been proposed that these metals may replace iron in the heme moiety of such a protein, thereby altering its conformation to a “deoxy” state (9Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). Alternatively, these transition metals may disrupt the production of reactive oxygen species which may serve as important signaling molecules in the oxygen response pathway (reviewed in Refs. 1Bunn H.F. Poyton R.O. Physiol. Rev. 1996; 76: 839-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (1045) Google Scholar and 10Huang L.E. Arany Z. Livingston D.M. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 32253-32259Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1024) Google Scholar). A recent study provided evidence against metal substitution in heme (11Horiguchi H. Bunn H.F. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1495: 231-236Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Iron chelation also mimics hypoxia. Just as certain metals may interfere with intracellular Fenton chemistry in some manner, decreased intracellular iron might also decrease reactive oxygen species within the cell, leading to altered gene expression (reviewed in Ref. 2Ebert B.L. Bunn H.F. Blood. 1999; 94: 1864-1877Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). HIF-1α has been shown to be sensitive to these perturbations in intracellular oxygen-free radicals (12Huang L.E. Willmore W.G. Gu J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). Finally, carbon monoxide inhibits the expression of hypoxia-induced genes and HIF-1α activation. Carbon monoxide can bind reversibly to heme proteins, and may lead to a change in conformation to the “oxy” state (12Huang L.E. Willmore W.G. Gu J. Goldberg M.A. Bunn H.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9038-9044Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (275) Google Scholar). A novel human cytosolic flavohemoprotein with cytochromeb5 and b5 reductase domains and functional NAD(P)H oxidoreductase activity has recently been cloned (13Zhu H. Qiu H. Yoon H.W. Huang S. Bunn H.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 14742-14747Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). This protein fulfills all of the criteria for an oxygen sensor, although definitive data in this regard remains lacking. The yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a single-celled eukaryote, is a facultative anaerobe which respires in the presence of oxygen but ferments under anaerobic conditions. Therefore, it is not surprising that yeast have evolved sophisticated molecular mechanisms involving oxygen-dependent gene regulation. Several yeast genes, exemplified by ANB1, have been shown to be up-regulated by complete anaerobiosis, mediated in large part through the ROX1p protein, a DNA-binding protein which functions as a repressor (reviewed in Ref. 14Zitomer R.S. Lowry C.V. Microbiol. Rev. 1992; 5: 1-11Crossref Google Scholar). There is no evidence that any factor that mimics hypoxia in mammalian cell lines induces ANB1expression in yeast. 2M. Vasconcelles, unpublished data. However, recently it has been shown that other genes in S. cerevisiae exhibit increased expression above baseline at low oxygen tensions, before complete anaerobic conditions are reached (15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). One gene in particular, OLE1, encodes the Δ9 fatty acid desaturase and is critical for unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis. Incubation in the presence of cobalt or nickel leads to increased expression of OLE1, mimicking mammalian hypoxia-regulated genes (15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). In this study, we have further defined the regulation ofOLE1 by hypoxia, certain transition metals, and iron chelation. The cis element responsible for hypoxia induction of OLE1 expression was identified and characterized using reporter gene studies and electromobility shift assays. This low oxygen response element, or LORE, was used to search the S. cerevisiae genome. This search led to the identification of a family of yeast genes regulated in a similar manner. Taken together, the evidence presented supports the hypothesis that critical aspects of the oxygen sensing mechanism are highly conserved among all eukaryotes. Yeast strains were grown in YPD medium (Bio 101, Inc., Carlsload, CA) or SC dropout medium, depending on the plasmid selectable markers. LB was used for bacteria growth purposes.

Vershon. pAM16 contains one LORE copy in the −347 to −328 forward or (+) orientation 5′ to the basal CYC1promoter-lacZ fusion. pAM7 has one LORE copy in the −328 to −347 reverse or (−)-orientation. pAM6 contains a tandem repeat of the LORE in the (+)-orientation. pAM10 was generated by inserting the synthetic paired oligonucleotides (yd-19 and yd-20) into theXhoI restriction site of pTBA30. The LORE in this plasmid has three mutations. Plasmid pAM4 is the p62::934 derivative with three nucleotide substitutions in the LORE region (-C342T, -T341A, and -A339G) prepared utilizing three-step PCR with oligonucleotides containing site-directed mutations. Two PCR reactions with appropriate pairs of mutant primers (PCR1: yd-8 and yd-20 and PCR2: yd-19 and lacZ-3′) and Taq DNA polymerase were carried out as recommended by Roche Molecular Biochemicals in 100-μl reactions, using 1 ng of p62::934 as a template in a PTC-100 thermal cycler (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA) for 30 cycles (1 min at 94 °C, 1 min at 55 °C, and 1 min at 72 °C), followed by 7 min at 72 °C. The PCR products were purified from a 1.0% agarose gel by using a Qiaex DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). Then, PCR products 1 and 2 were annealed, and amplified as above with primer yd-8 and lacZ-3′. The resulting PCR products were purified as above and digested with restriction enzyme HindIII andSalI. Finally this PCR product was cloned intoHindIII and SalI pretreated p62::934 plasmid to generate pAM4. All the constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The promoter deletion constructs were transformed into wild-type strain RZ53-6 for subsequent β-galactosidase assays.Table IIYeast (S. cerevisiae) strains and plasmidsStrains and plasmidsGenotypePlasmid descriptionSourceRZ53–6α trp1–289, leu2–3, 112, ura3–52, ade1–100R.

Table II contains the yeast strains used in these studies. Yeast cells containing lacZfusion plasmids were grown at 30 °C on uracil dropout medium containing dextrose (17Treco D.A. Winston F. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 13.2.1-13.2.12Google Scholar). For unsaturated fatty acid repression analysis, yeast were grown in medium supplemented with 1% Tergitol as described previously (16Choi J.Y. Stukey J. Hwang S.Y. Martin C.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 3581-3589Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Cells were grown in the presence of UFAs for 6 h prior to the β-galactosidase assays. Plasmid amplifications and bacterial transformations were performed using Escherichia coli strain DH5 (Invitrogene Corp.). Yeast transformations were performed by the method of Elble (18Elble R. BioTechniques. 1992; 13: 18-20PubMed Google Scholar). Preparative cultures were grown aerobically in a shaker at 200 rpm (Innova 4000 incubator shaker, New Brunswick Scientific) at 30 °C to mid-logarithmic phase. For experiments assessing yeast under hypoxic conditions, mid-logarithmic phase preparative cultures were used to inoculate special air-tight flasks with inlet and outlet ports to allow for equilibration with the appropriate gas mixtures. Cultures were exposed to a continuous flow of hydrated medical grade nitrogen (BOC Gases, Murray Hill, NJ), unless otherwise specified, for 6 h after inoculating the medium via the inlet port. Of note, medical grade nitrogen is contaminated with trace amounts of O2(less than 1%). The percentage of saturated O2 in each flask was confirmed by using an oxygen monitor (G. C. Industries, Inc.) attached to the outlet port of each culture. For experiments assessing yeast exposed to cobalt, cobalt chloride was added to the cultures at a concentration of 400 μm unless otherwise noted. Cells were exposed to cobalt for a period of 6 h prior to harvesting. The flasks contained a volume of medium that was ∼1/5 the flask volume. All experiments were performed with yeast in logarithmic growth phase in a shaker (200 rpm) at 30 °C. Growth was monitored by measuring the yeast A600 at the completion of each experiment. Assays of cells containing plasmids derived from the OLE1 promoter-lacZfusion p62 constructs were performed as described previously (19Reynolds A. Lundblad V. Dorris D. Keaveney M. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 13.6.2-13.6.3Google Scholar). Cell densities for these assays were determined by measurement atA600. Transformants were assayed for each of the plasmid constructs listed in Table II. β-Galactosidase activities reported here are the results of at least two independent experiments. Each experimental assay was performed in quadruplicate. Plasmid templates for sequencing were isolated using a QIAprep spin purification kit (Qiagen). Thefmol DNA sequencing system (Promega Corp.) was used for sequencing according to its technical manual. Reactions were run on 6% sequencing gels, which were dried and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak) to visualize the sequence. Haploid yeast (S. cerevisiae, strain RZ53–6) were cultured in 1-liter flasks containing 200 ml of YPD (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose) either under normoxic or hypoxic conditions, harvested at midlog phase (A600 = 0.8), and lysed by vortexing with glass beads according to published protocols (20Pfeifer K. Arcangioli B. Guarente L. Cell. 1987; 49: 9-18Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). Following addition of ammonium sulfate to 40% and incubation on a rocker table at 4 °C for 30 min, the precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm in a microcentrifuge at 4 °C for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in storage buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.0, 5 mm EDTA, 20% (v/v) glycerol, mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 7 mm β-mercaptoethanol) and stored frozen at −80 °C. The soluble protein concentration was determined using a Bradford dye binding assay (Bio-Rad). EMSA were performed essentially as described by Carey (21Carey J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 208: 103-117Crossref PubMed Scopus (319) Google Scholar) utilizing synthetic paired oligonucleotides (e.g. 10-5′ and 10-3′) as a probe or a probe containing the LORE sequence made by PCR using p62::934 as the template with32P-labeled oligonucleotides 1-5′ and yd-10 (−397 to −234) as the primers. Synthetic paired oligonucleotides were end labeled using polynucleotide kinase and purified using a Sephadex G-25 spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to remove unincorporated nucleotide. Probes made by PCR were purified away from labeled primers, [γ-32P]ATP and Taq polymerase using a QIAquick spin PCR purification kit (Qiagen). The concentration of each probe was determined on an ethidium bromide-stained agarose-mini gel (22Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Sping Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982Google Scholar). In each reaction 10–20 ng of probe was used. Binding reactions were 40 μl of buffer H (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, at room temperature, 0.5 mm EDTA, 0.5 mmdithiothreitol, 0.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mmCaCl2, 50 mm NaCl, 7% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 15 ng/μl poly(dA-dT)) for 20 min at room temperature. Proteins were diluted into binding buffer on ice immediately before use. Reactions were loaded on 5% acrylamide gels (29:1), 0.5 × TBE, and run for 3 h at 4 °C at 15 V/cm. Gels were dried and exposed to X-Omat AR film (Kodak) to visualize the shifted bands. Total yeast RNA was isolated as described previously (23Collart M.A. Oliviero S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 13.12.1-13.12.5Google Scholar). Equal amounts (15 μg) of total RNA were analyzed by Northern blots according to standard procedures for separation of RNA using 1% formaldehyde gels (15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). RNA from the gels was transferred to Nytran Plus membranes (Schleicher & Schuell Inc.) in 10 × SSC overnight. Prehybridization, hybridization, and washing of membranes were performed as described (24Brown T. Mackey K. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 4.9.1-4.9.14Google Scholar). Northern blots were quantified using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics) and autoradiographs were also prepared on X-Omat AR film (Kodak). To make radiolabeled cDNA probes for other genes of interest (including ACT1 as a control), yeast genomic DNA prepared by the rapid isolation of yeast chromosomal DNA protocol (25Hoffman C.S. Ausubel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Seidman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. John Wiley & Sons, New York1997: 13.11.2-13.11.4Google Scholar) was subjected to PCR with appropriate pairs of primers for the particular genes of interest. The PCR products were first purified using a QIAquick spin PCR purification kit (Qiagen), separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE, then purified by the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. For the detection of OLE1 mRNA, a radiolabeled DNA probe was made using a 0.5-kilobase EcoRI fragment from theOLE1 protein coding sequence. For an internal control of cellular mRNA levels, a 1-kilobaseHindIII-KpnI fragment of the S. cerevisiae phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK1) was isolated from plasmid pRIP1PGK obtained from Dr. S. Peltz (Robert Wood Johnson Medical School). All DNA fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis in 1 × TAE and purified using the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. The purified DNA fragments were labeled to high specific activity with [32P]dCTP (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) by the random primer extension method using Ready to Go DNA labeling beads (Amersham Pharmaceutical Biotech) reaction kit. Unincorporated nucleotides were removed from the sample using a Sephadex G-50 spin column (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Specific activity of labeled probes was determined by liquid scintillation counting. Previous studies have shown that OLE1 mRNA transcript levels are increased at low oxygen (O2) tensions, below 0.5 μmol. Maximal expression, approaching a 4-fold increase over baseline normoxia, was observed following 8–10 h of anoxia (15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar, 26Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Poyton R.O. J. Exp. Biol. 1998; 201: 1177-1195Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). First, we confirmed that OLE1 mRNA is maximally expressed in the presence of trace O2 (<1%) concentrations (data not shown). Subsequently, we extended this finding utilizing a plasmid (p62::934) in which 934 bp of the OLE1 promoter is fused in-frame with the lacZ gene. Less than a 2-fold induction over baseline levels in normoxia was observed in 1% O2 although a 6-fold induction occurred at an extremely low O2 tension (data not shown). In a similar fashion, we have verified previous studies demonstrating increased levels ofOLE1 mRNA following incubation of S. cerevisiae with increasing concentrations of cobalt chloride (CoCl2) and nickel chloride (NiCl2) in normoxia (15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar) (data not shown). The concentrations were similar to those used in the study of hypoxia-regulated mammalian genes such as erythropoietin (9Goldberg M.A. Dunning S.P. Bunn H.F. Science. 1988; 242: 1412-1415Crossref PubMed Scopus (875) Google Scholar). These data were confirmed with experiments utilizing theOLE1 promoter-lacZ reporter assay. The degree of induction approached that which has been previously reported (15Kwast K.E. Burke P.V. Staahl B.T. Poyton R.O. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5446-5451Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), even though the metal concentrations were almost 10-fold lower. At 800 μm CoCl2 and 450 μmNiCl2, significant differences in the growth rate of the yeast compared with control cultures were observed in our experiments, presumably due to direct toxicity of the culture by the metal onS. cerevisiae. It is not immediately apparent why the significantly lower metal concentrations used i"

Benzylsuccinate synthase initiates anaerobic toluene mineralization in denitrifying bacteria by catalyzing the addition of toluene to fumarate, forming benzylsuccinate (Fig.1; Refs. 1Beller H.R.

Furthermore, this type of fumarate addition reaction may be a general strategy for activating methylbenzenes in the absence of molecular oxygen as it has been shown to be the initial step in anaerobic m-xylene mineralization (6Krieger C.J. Beller H.R. Reinhard M. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1999; 181: 6403-6410Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and has been implicated as the initial step in anaerobicm-cresol mineralization (7Müller J.A. Galushko A.S. Kappler A. Schink B. Arch. Microbiol. 1999; 172: 287-294Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). Unlike the initial activation steps in aerobic methylbenzene metabolism whereby the methylbenzene is oxidized directly by molecular oxygen as a cosubstrate (8Gibson D.T. Subramanian V. Gibson D.T.

A gene located immediately upstream of the benzylsuccinate synthase structural genes shares strong predicted amino acid sequence similarity to the PFL- and ARNR-activating enzymes, suggesting that benzylsuccinate synthase may be activated in a similar fashion (11Leuthner B.

Genetic complementation studies in Thauera aromatica sp. T1 showed that the conserved glycine and cysteine residues of benzylsuccinate synthase are important for toluene utilization (12Coschigano P.W. Wehrman T.S. Young L.Y. Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 1998; 64: 1650-1656Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Based on the molecular similarity of benzylsuccinate synthase to PFL and ARNR, we examined active benzylsuccinate synthase for the presence of an organic free radical. Using EPR spectroscopy we report here the first experimental evidence that active benzylsuccinate synthase carries a stable organic free radical. Based on the strong spectral similarities between the EPR signal of the benzylsuccinate synthase radical and that of the glycyl radicals of PFL and ARNR, the free radical of benzylsuccinate synthase appears to be located on a glycine residue. Furthermore we found a direct correlation between the appearance of the free radical and enzyme activity, suggesting that the radical is essential for catalysis. All the chemicals used in this study, including2H2O (D2O; 99.9 atom %) and [ring-U-14C]toluene (≥98 atom %; 2.8 mCi/mmol specific activity), were purchased from either Aldrich or Sigma. The [ring-U-14C]toluene was diluted to a specific activity of ∼42 μCi/mmol for the experiments. Azoarcus sp. strain T, a denitrifying bacterium capable of anaerobically mineralizing toluene andm-xylene (24Dolfing J. Zeyer J. Binder-Eicher P. Schwarzenbach R.P. Arch.

Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 670-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Batch cultures totaling 10–12 liters were grown in glass reactors sealed with polytetrafluoroethylene Mininert valves (Alltech Associates, Inc., Deerfield, IL). These cultures were incubated at room temperature (25 °C) in an anaerobic glove box (Coy Laboratory Products, Inc., Grass Lake, MI) with an atmosphere of 80% N2, 10% H2, and 10% CO2.Azoarcus sp. strain T was grown exponentially with benzoate (initial concentration 3 mm) and nitrate (initial concentration 2.5 mm) to anA600 of 0.25–0.5. Benzoate and nitrate were amended repeatedly to the cultures prior to reaching the desiredA600. Approximately 20 h prior to harvesting the cells, toluene (initial concentration 350 μm) was added to the cultures to induce synthesis of benzylsuccinate synthase. During the remaining growth period residual benzoate was consumed completely, and the cells switched to toluene metabolism as indicated by the induction of benzylsuccinate synthase activity (data not shown). Cells were harvested anaerobically by centrifugation (1Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 670-676Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), washed once in anoxic 120 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, amended with 2 mm dithiothreitol (designated as buffer A), and resuspended in 7–12 ml of buffer A (amended with 12 mg of DNase I and ∼6 mmMgCl2). Cells were broken anaerobically by four passages through a French pressure cell at 138 megapascal. Unbroken cells and cell debris were removed by anaerobic centrifugation (27,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant, defined as the cell extract, was divided into 0.5- and 1-ml fractions that were frozen under anaerobic conditions at −20 °C until further use. Benzylsuccinate synthase was partially purified from cell extracts of anaerobically grown toluene-inducedAzoarcus sp. strain T using a modification of the method described previously (10Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 147-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Purification steps were conducted anaerobically at ∼15 °C in an anaerobic glove box with an atmosphere of 90% N2 and 10% H2. Crude cell extract was passed through a 0.45-μm filter and then applied in batches (35–80 mg of protein) to an Econo-Pac CHT-II hydroxyapatite column (5-ml bed volume, Bio-Rad) attached to an Amersham Pharmacia Biotech FPLC System. The binary eluents used to enrich for benzylsuccinate synthase activity consisted of a 10 mmpotassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and a 500 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.6. Both degassed eluents were amended with 5 mm dithiothreitol. The chromatographic conditions, as described previously (10Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 147-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), consisted of a 1 ml min−1 flow rate starting at an initial phosphate concentration of 120 mm for 1.2 column volumes and then a linear gradient from 120 to 400 mm phosphate at a rate of 25 mmmin−1. One-ml fractions were collected and assayed for benzylsuccinate synthase activity as described below. Results from the hydroxyapatite chromatography were similar to those described earlier (10Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 147-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) with the following exception: the specific activity of the cell extract was 25 nmol min−1 (mg of protein)−1and that of enriched benzylsuccinate synthase ranged from 150 to 400 nmol min−1 (mg of protein)−1, depending on the particular fraction. Benzylsuccinate synthase activity typically eluted between 160 and 235 mm phosphate. Attempts to purify benzylsuccinate synthase further by gel filtration resulted in a greater than 95% loss of specific activity relative to the hydroxyapatite fraction (10Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 147-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to retain activity of benzylsuccinate synthase, hydroxyapatite-enriched fractions were used for this study. The hydroxyapatite fractions used in this study contained a greater than 7-fold enrichment of benzylsuccinate synthase and less than 3% of the protein of the cell extract placed on the column. Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (25Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (217544) Google Scholar) using a commercially available protein-binding dye from Bio-Rad. Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. The activity of benzylsuccinate synthase was measured using a modified version of the radiological assay developed previously (10Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 147-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assays were performed in 2.8-ml glass vials sealed with Mininert valves. The anoxic assay mixtures (final volume 1 ml) contained 100 mm Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, 300 nmol of [ring-U-14C]toluene (specific activity, ∼42 μCi/mmol), 10 mm fumarate, and 5 mmdithiothreitol as a reductant. The assay buffer was changed to a Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.8, because the pH optimum of benzylsuccinate synthase activity was found to be between 7.5 and 8, consistent with the findings of Leuthner et al. (11Leuthner B. Leutwein C. Schulz H. Horth P. Haehnel W. Schiltz E. Schagger H. Heider J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). Assays were conducted at room temperature (25 °C) in an anaerobic glove box with an atmosphere of 80% N2, 10% H2, and 10% CO2. To prevent a decrease in the pH of the reaction mixture due to the presence of CO2 in the glove box atmosphere, the reaction mixtures were prepared in a glove box with an atmosphere of 90% N2 and 10% H2 and then transferred to the former glove box in a stoppered anoxic glass bottle. Assay components were added by syringe through Mininert valves. Reactions were started by the addition of crude cell extract or hydroxyapatite-enriched benzylsuccinate synthase. After incubation for 0, 10, or 12 min on an orbital shaker, the reactions were stopped by the addition of 0.1 ml of 2 mNaOH. The assay vials were removed from the glove box and amended with an antifoaming agent (Antifoam A, Sigma; ∼100 ppm final concentration). Assay mixtures were purged with N2 for 20 min to remove any residual [14C]toluene. Ultima Gold XR scintillation liquid (10 ml; Packard Instrument Co.) then was added to the mixtures, and the remaining nonvolatile radioactivity (primarily [14C]benzylsuccinate) was measured with a Tri-Carb model 2500 TR/AB liquid scintillation analyzer (Packard Instrument Co.). Benzylsuccinate has been shown to be the only significant product formed from toluene under the experimental conditions of these assays (10Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 147-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Hydroxyapatite fractions of catalytically active benzylsuccinate synthase were analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. Although a portion of the hydroxyapatite-enriched benzylsuccinate synthase was tested for activity to ensure the enzyme was catalytically active (see above), the remaining portion of benzylsuccinate synthase analyzed by EPR spectroscopy was not amended with the substrates, toluene and fumarate, and therefore did not catalyze the benzylsuccinate synthase reaction. In an anaerobic glove box (atmosphere of 90% N2 and 10% H2), samples (300 μl) of benzylsuccinate synthase were transferred to EPR tubes. Anaerobic tubing was placed over the end of each EPR tube and clamped closed. The EPR tubes were removed from the glove box and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen. The samples were sent in liquid nitrogen in a shipping Dewar (CryoPak Shipper, CP-100, Taylor-Wharton, Theodore, AL) to Amsterdam where they were analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. Three sample sets of benzylsuccinate synthase were prepared and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy: 1) benzylsuccinate synthase, 2) benzylsuccinate synthase exchanged into phosphate-buffered2H2O, and 3) benzylsuccinate synthase amended with toluene but not fumarate. A sample (300 μl) of hydroxyapatite-enriched benzylsuccinate synthase (1.8 mg of protein ml−1) was transferred to an EPR tube and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. A 200 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, was prepared anoxically in 99.9% D2O (referred to as phosphate-buffered D2O). A hydroxyapatite fraction of enriched benzylsuccinate synthase (800 μl of 1.4 mg of protein ml−1) was exchanged into the anoxic phosphate-buffered D2O by applying the fraction onto a HiTrap desalting column (5-ml bed volume; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and then eluting it with 2.6 ml of the phosphate-buffered D2O. Only the last 1.9 ml of eluted liquid were collected, and a portion of this (300 μl of 0.5 mg of protein ml−1) was transferred to an EPR tube and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. Portions (300 μl) of the same hydroxyapatite fraction of benzylsuccinate synthase (1.9 mg of protein ml−1) were added to three EPR tubes. One EPR tube had no amendment, another was amended with the nonmetabolizable substrate, benzene (180 nmol), and the third EPR tube was amended with the substrate, toluene (190 nmol). Both benzene and toluene were amended from a methanolic stock solution (final methanol concentration less than 0.7% (v/v)). Fumarate, a cosubstrate of the benzylsuccinate synthase reaction, was not added to any of the three samples. The three EPR tubes then were analyzed by EPR spectroscopy. EPR spectra at X-band (9 GHz) were obtained with a Bruker ECS 106 EPR spectrometer equipped with an Oxford Instruments ESR 900 helium-flow cryostat with an ITC4 temperature controller. A field modulation frequency of 100 kHz was used. The magnetic field was calibrated with an AEG magnetic field meter. The microwave frequency was measured with an HP 5350B microwave frequency counter. The microwave power incident to the cavity was measured with an HP 432 B power meter. Simulations were carried out as described earlier (26Beinert H. Albracht S.P.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1982; 683: 245-277Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). Quantification of EPR signals was carried out by direct double integration of the experimental spectra (27Aasa R. Vänngård T. J. Magn. Reson. 1975; 19: 308-315Google Scholar, 28Albracht S.P.J. Lee C.P. Current Topics in Bioenergetics. Academic Press, New York1984: 79-106Google Scholar) or by comparison with a good fitting simulation (29Albracht S.P.J. Leeuwerik F.J. van Swol B. FEBS Lett. 1979; 104: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Benzylsuccinate synthase, as partially purified from extracts of anaerobically grown toluene-induced cells of Azoarcus sp. strain T, was active and catalyzed the addition of toluene to fumarate to form benzylsuccinate at high specific activities (150 to 400 nmol min−1 (mg of protein)−1). Using EPR spectroscopy, we analyzed a hydroxyapatite fraction of benzylsuccinate synthase (1.8 mg of protein ml−1; ∼8 μmholoenzyme) for the presence of a free radical and observed an EPR signal as shown in Fig. 2 A. The EPR signal was centered at g = 2.0021 and was characterized by a 2-fold splitting of about 1.5 mT. The g value of the signal is very close to that of a free radical. Most importantly, the line shape of the EPR signal closely resembles that of the glycyl radicals of PFL (15Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schaefer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 16Unkrig V. Neugebauer F.A. Knappe J. Eur. J.

The EPR signals of all three enzymes are characterized by a g value between 2.002 and 2.004, as well as a resolved 2-fold splitting of about 1.5 mT (15Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A.

The simulation in Fig. 2 B shows that the hyperfine interactions and linewidth proposed for PFL by Wagner et al. (15Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schaefer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) results in an EPR spectrum that is indistinguishable from that of benzylsuccinate synthase (Fig. 2 A). The EPR spectral similarities between benzylsuccinate synthase and the glycyl radical enzymes, PFL and ARNR, strongly suggest that the radical observed in benzylsuccinate synthase is located on a glycine residue. When an EPR sample was thawed under a flow of argon for 15 min and refrozen in liquid nitrogen, the EPR signal did not change (data not shown). However, when the sample was thawed in the presence of air and refrozen in liquid nitrogen, no EPR signal was detected. The absence of an EPR signal is consistent with benzylsuccinate synthase activity being extremely oxygen sensitive (10Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 147-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Leuthner B. Leutwein C. Schulz H. Horth P. Haehnel W. Schiltz E. Schagger H. Heider J. Mol. Microbiol. 1998; 28: 615-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (228) Google Scholar). The correlation between benzylsuccinate synthase activity and the presence of an EPR signal suggests that the radical is essential for catalysis. The chemical nature of the radical moiety was investigated further by exchanging hydroxyapatite-enriched benzylsuccinate synthase into phosphate-buffered D2O (see “Experimental Procedures”) and analyzing the sample by EPR spectroscopy. The resulting EPR spectrum revealed no resolved hyperfine splitting (Fig. 2 C), as opposed to the spectrum of the enzyme as determined in H2O (Fig. 2 A). This implies that the 2-fold splitting observed in the EPR spectrum of the normal protonated enzyme is caused by a hydrogen atom and that this hydrogen is exchangeable with deuterium atoms originating from the solvent. Notably, this hydrogen/deuterium exchange occurs in the absence of catalysis because the catalytically competent enzyme was not amended with any substrates prior to analysis by EPR spectroscopy. When PFL was exchanged into D2O and analyzed by EPR spectroscopy, the resulting EPR spectrum (15Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schaefer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 16Unkrig V. Neugebauer F.A. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar) indicated an analogous behavior. A rapidly exchangeable hydrogen was found in PFL and was assigned to the α position of the glycyl radical (15Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schaefer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar). Analogous with this assignment, the 2-fold splitting in the EPR spectrum of benzylsuccinate synthase is also assigned to an exchangeable hydrogen, most likely the α hydrogen of the glycyl radical. The simulation in Fig. 2 D shows that the hyperfine interactions and linewidth proposed for PFL in D2O (15Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schaefer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar) results in an EPR spectrum indistinguishable from that of benzylsuccinate synthase in D2O (Fig.2 C). Contrary to benzylsuccinate synthase and PFL, no such rapidly exchangeable hydrogen was observed for ARNR (17Mulliez E. Fontecave M. Gaillard J. Reichard P. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2296-2299Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mutant studies conducted with PFL from E. coli showed that the hydrogen exchange of the glycyl radical of PFL is not spontaneous but involves the active site cysteine 419 (14Parast C.V. Wong K.K. Lewisch S.A. Kozarich J.W. Peisach J. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Based on this finding, Parast et al. (14Parast C.V. Wong K.K. Lewisch S.A. Kozarich J.W. Peisach J. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) proposed that the α hydrogen of the glycyl radical does not exchange directly with the solvent. Instead, the hydrogen of the thiol group of cysteine 419 is proposed to exchange with the solvent, in this case solvent deuterons, forming a deuterated thiol group. The glycyl radical is then proposed to abstract the deuterium from the thiol group, generating a transient thiyl radical and a chirally deuterated glycine residue. To form a glycyl radical with a deuterium in the α position, as observed in the EPR spectra of PFL (15Wagner A.F.V. Frey M. Neugebauer F.A. Schaefer W. Knappe J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 996-1000Crossref PubMed Scopus (306) Google Scholar, 16Unkrig V. Neugebauer F.A. Knappe J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1989; 184: 723-728Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar), the thiyl radical of cysteine 419 must nonstereospecifically abstract the hydrogen from the chirally deuterated glycine residue (14Parast C.V. Wong K.K. Lewisch S.A. Kozarich J.W. Peisach J. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). As an analogy to the findings for PFL, one may postulate that the hydrogen exchange of the glycyl radical of benzylsuccinate synthase may not be spontaneous but may involve the conserved cysteine residue. This would suggest that the glycyl radical and the conserved cysteine residue in benzylsuccinate synthase are in close proximity to each other in the active site and interact during catalysis. We also examined whether amending samples of enriched benzylsuccinate synthase with toluene as the sole substrate alters the EPR signal of the benzylsuccinate synthase radical. Control samples included benzylsuccinate synthase alone and benzylsuccinate synthase amended with benzene, a nonmetabolizable surrogate. The intensity and line shapes of the EPR spectra of all three samples were similar to those of the untreated enzyme (data not shown). This suggests that the presence of toluene alone does not quench the radical to any significant degree, or if it does, the quenching is too transient to be observed. The spectroscopic characteristics of benzylsuccinate synthase reported here and the molecular properties discussed previously (10Beller H.R. Spormann A.M. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1999; 178: 147-153Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 11Leuthner B. Leutwein C. Schulz H. Horth P. Haehnel W. Schiltz E. Schagger H. Heider J. Mol.

Bacteriol. 1998; 180: 5454-5457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) suggest the following reaction mechanism for benzylsuccinate synthase. At the beginning of the enzymatic reaction, active benzylsuccinate synthase harbors an oxygen-sensitive, stable glycyl free radical (presumably at glycine 828 in Azoarcus sp. strain T benzylsuccinate synthase). The glycyl radical abstracts a hydrogen atom from the conserved cysteine residue forming a transient thiyl radical (presumably at cysteine 492 inAzoarcus sp. strain T benzylsuccinate synthase). The thiyl radical then abstracts a hydrogen atom from the toluene methyl group to form a benzylic radical as an intermediate, which then attacks the double bond of fumarate forming a benzylsuccinyl radical. The benzylsuccinyl radical then reabstracts the same hydrogen atom from the conserved cysteine residue, forming benzylsuccinate and regenerating the thiyl radical. Based on proposed reaction mechanisms of PFL (14Parast C.V. Wong K.K. Lewisch S.A. Kozarich J.W. Peisach J. Magliozzo R.S. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 2393-2399Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar,20Knappe J. Elbert S. Frey M. Wagner A.F.V. Biochem. Soc.

FEBS Lett. 2000; 469: 45-48Crossref Scopus (25) Google Scholar), we presume that the thiyl radical then abstracts a hydrogen atom from the conserved glycine residue regenerating the glycyl radical. At this point the glycyl radical enzyme is competent to undergo another catalytic cycle. Consequently benzylsuccinate synthase can undergo multiple turnovers without reintroduction of its glycyl radical by an activating enzyme, as also indicated by in vitro assays of benzylsuccinate synthase activity conducted in this study: 150 pmol of enriched benzylsuccinate synthase produced 160 nmol of benzylsuccinate in 12 min. pyruvate formate-lyase anaerobic ribonucleotide reductase millitesla"

This isoform thus represents the second example of a glycopeptide transferase and is distinct from the previously identified form in enzymatic activity as well as expression in embryonic and adult tissues.

However, the exact biological functions of O-linked glycosylation remain largely unknown, as studies involving chemical/enzymatic cleavage of sugars and/or mutagenesis of acceptor residues on proteins can result in secondary effects unrelated to sugar removal or absence. Since carbohydrates can only be “mutated” indirectly by modifying the enzymatic activities of the glycosyltansferases responsible for their synthesis, our efforts have focused on the characterization of the enzyme family responsible for the initiation of O-glycan addition. Thus far, seven distinct mammalian isoforms from this gene family have been identified and functionally characterized: ppGaNTase-T1 (6Hagen F.K. VanWuyckhuyse B. Tabak L.A. J. Biol.

Glycobiology. 1996; 6: 701-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar); however, the enzymatic activity and the gene encoding this isoform remain uncharacterized. Whereas some isoforms display a broad range of expression in adult tissues and act on a robust set of substrates (ppGaNTase-T1, -T2, and -T3), others are more restricted in both expression and substrate preference (ppGaNTase-T4, -T5, and -T7). ppGaNTase-T7 (14Ten Hagen K.G. Tetaert D. Hagen F.K. Richet C. Beres T.M. Gagnon J. Balys M.M. VanWuyckhuyse B. Bedi G.S. Degand P. Tabak L.A. J. Biol.

This result indicates that not all O-linked glycosylation occurs simultaneously and suggests that a hierarchy of action within this family may be responsible for the complex patterns of multisite substrate glycosylation seen in vivo. Here, we report the cloning of another member of this transferase family, termed ppGaNTase-T9. In common with ppGaNTase-T7, ppGaNTase-T9 demonstrated no transferase activity against a panel of unmodified peptide substrates in vitro. However, when the MUC5AC peptide substrate was first glycosylated by ppGaNTase-T1, the resultant glycopeptides were readily glycosylated further by ppGaNTase-T9 in a manner distinct from that of ppGaNTase-T7. ppGaNTase-T9 and ppGaNTase-T7 transcript expression patterns differed as well; ppGaNTase-T9 was expressed more widely across adult tissues and exhibited distinct expression patterns within developing mouse embryos. These results suggest that glycosylation of multisite substrates occurs through the specific and hierarchical action of multiple members of this enzyme family, whose expression is uniquely regulated both during development and in adult tissues. Previously, the conserved amino acid regions EIWGGEN and VWMDEYK were used to design sense and antisense PCR primers to amplify products from rat sublingual gland (rat SLG) cDNA. These products were cloned, sequenced and used to screen a rat SLG cDNA library as described (12Ten Hagen K.G. Hagen F.K. Balys M.M. Beres T.M. VanWuyckhuyse B.C. Tabak L.A. J. Biol.

Briefly, Pichia-derived ppGaNTase-T1 (0.028 μg) was incubated for 72 h at 37 °C with 1 mg of peptide in a 500-μl total volume under the following conditions: 125 mmcacodylate buffer (pH 7.0) containing 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100, 12.5 mm MnCl2, 1 mm aprotinin, 1 mm leupeptin, 1 mm E64, 1 mmphenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 1.25 mm AMP, 6 mm cold UDP-GalNAc. Additional enzyme (0.028 μg) and UDP-GalNAc (3 μmol) were added at the first 24-h interval. The di- and tri-glycosylated MUC5AC reaction products and the mono-glycosylated EA2 reaction product were passed through AG1-X8 resin and purified on a Waters 265 HPLC using a Vydac C-18 reverse phase column (0.46 × 25 cm) with a flow rate of 1 ml/min using a linear gradient of 5% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid to 20% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in 20 min at 22 °C. Capillary electrophoresis was performed on a model 270-HT Capillary Electrophoreses System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) under conditions previously described (14Ten Hagen K.G. Tetaert D.

The putative AtLPP1 gene product showed homology to the yeast and mammalian lipid phosphate phosphatase enzymes and possessed a phosphatase signature sequence motif. Heterologous expression and biochemical characterization of theAtLPP1 gene in yeast showed that it encoded an enzyme (AtLpp1p) that exhibited both diacylglycerol pyrophosphate phosphatase and phosphatidate phosphatase activities. Kinetic analysis indicated that diacylglycerol pyrophosphate was the preferred substrate for AtLpp1p in vitro. A second Arabidopsis gene (AtLPP2) was identified based on sequence homology toAtLPP1 that was also heterologously expressed in yeast. The AtLpp2p enzyme also utilized diacylglycerol pyrophosphate and phosphatidate but with no preference for either substrate. The AtLpp1p and AtLpp2p enzymes showed differences in their apparent affinities for diacylglycerol pyrophosphate and phosphatidate as well as other enzymological properties. Northern blot analyses showed that theAtLPP1 gene was preferentially expressed in leaves and roots, whereas the AtLPP2 gene was expressed in all tissues examined. AtLPP1, but not AtLPP2, was regulated in response to various stress conditions. The AtLPP1 gene was transiently induced by genotoxic stress (gamma ray or UV-B) and elicitor treatments with mastoparan and harpin. The regulation of theAtLPP1 gene in response to stress was consistent with the hypothesis that its encoded lipid phosphate phosphatase enzyme may attenuate the signaling functions of phosphatidate and/or diacylglycerol pyrophosphate that form in response to stress in plants.

These molecules also serve as a reservoir for several lipid-signaling molecules. PA1 and DG are intermediates in the biosynthesis of phospholipids and triacylglycerols (1Kent C. Annu. Rev.

PA is an intermediate for the synthesis of the major phospholipids, which include phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidylglycerol. The dephosphorylation of PA to DG allows for the subsequent production of phosphatidylcholine and triacylglycerol, the major components of eukaryotic membranes and storage lipid, respectively (1Kent C.

In addition, PA, DG, and DGPP are products of lipid metabolism that serve roles as second messengers in several cellular signal transduction pathways (3Divecha N. Irvine R.F.

The regulation of these cell-signaling pathways may be achieved, at least in part, by lipid phosphate phosphatase enzymes that catalyze the sequential conversion of DGPP to PA and of PA to DG (5Munnik T.

Recent studies with a variety of plant systems have shown that PA and DGPP transiently accumulate after elicitor treatment or in response to stress (5Munnik T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. Biochim.

These observations have suggested that these phospholipid molecules play a role in plant signal transduction (10Van der Luit A.H. Piatti T. van Doorn A. Musgrave A. Felix G. Boller T. Munnik T.

Lipid second messengers in plant cell signaling are produced through the activation of phospholipase C and phospholipase D (5Munnik T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. Biochim. Biophys.

Enhanced levels of PA, necessary for maintaining housekeeping functions in lipid metabolism and transient induction of PA-related signaling events, are produced by phospholipase D-mediated hydrolysis of structural phospholipids and the combined actions of phospholipase C and DG kinase (5Munnik T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1389: 222-272Crossref PubMed Scopus (376) Google Scholar). Stimulation of phospholipase D activity is associated with plant stress responses, particularly in response to pathogens (13Chapman K.D.

A. 1999; 96: 12192-12197Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar). Some of these effects may be mediated by G-protein-coupled stress receptors, because G-protein activators such as mastoparan activate PLD in the absence of stress (19Munnik T. Arisz S.A. de Vrije T. Musgrave A. Plant Cell. 1995; 7: 2197-2210Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar, 20Munnik T. van Himbergen J.A.J. ter Riet B. Braun F.J. Irvine R.F. van der Ende H. Musgrave A. Planta. 1998; 207: 133-145Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Plants appear to have established a mechanism to attenuate PA action through its phosphorylation by PA kinase (21Wissing J.B. Behrbohm H. Plant Physiol. 1993; 102: 1243-1249Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) to yield DGPP (22Munnik T. de Vrije T. Irvine R.F. Musgrave A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 15708-15715Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar). DGPP is rapidly produced together with PA during G-protein activation, and high levels of DGPP are rapidly eliminated (20Munnik T. van Himbergen J.A.J. ter Riet B. Braun F.J. Irvine R.F. van der Ende H. Musgrave A. Planta. 1998; 207: 133-145Crossref Scopus (99) Google Scholar), which raised the question whether signaling functions should also be attributed to DGPP. The plant DGPP phosphatase activity described by Riedel et al. (23Riedel B. Morr M. Wu W.I. Carman G.M. Wissing J.B. Plant Sci. 1997; 128: 1-10Crossref Scopus (14) Google Scholar) preferentially dephosphorylates DGPP to PA but also dephosphorylates PA to DG, which makes possible the sequential conversion of DGPP to PA and DG. The function of DG remains unclear because a protein kinase C, the downstream effector target of DG in mammalian cells, has not been isolated from plants. So far, plant lipid phosphate phosphatase enzymes able to remove elevated levels of PA and DGPP during the early phase of stress response have not yet been described. During the course of studies to examine global responses of genes to radiation stress in Arabidopsis thaliana, we identified a gene, which we called AtLPP1, whose deduced protein structure resembled lipid phosphate phosphatase enzymes from yeast and mammalian cells. Heterologous expression of the Arabidopsis AtLPP1 cDNA in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiaeshowed that the encoded protein was indeed a lipid phosphate phosphatase that exhibited DGPP phosphatase and PA phosphatase activities. A second gene (AtLPP2) was identified in theArabidopsis data base that was also shown to encode a lipid phosphate phosphatase enzyme. AtLPP1, but not AtLPP2, was transiently induced by ionizing radiation, UV-B radiation, and elicitor treatments with mastoparan and harpin. The regulation of the AtLPP1 gene in response to stress was consistent with the hypothesis that its encoded lipid phosphate phosphatase activities may attenuate the signaling functions of PA and/or DGPP that form in response to stress in plants. A. thaliana cell suspensions were grown with constant shaking at 25 °C and continuous white light as described previously (24Axelos M. Curie C. Mazzolini L. Bardet C. Lescure B. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 1992; 30: 123-128Google Scholar).A. thaliana (L) Heynh (Columbia ecotype) plants were cultivated in a growth chamber on a 14-h light/10-h dark cycle. Chemical or physical treatments of cell suspensions were applied at the beginning of the exponential phase of growth, which corresponded to 8–12% packed cell volume. Cells in culture medium were treated directly with mastoparan (10 μm) and then collected at the indicated time intervals. Harpin (Erwinia amylovora) elicitation was carried out by mechanic infiltration of the elicitin solution (60 mg/ml) into leaves followed by collection of samples at the indicated time intervals. Gamma irradiation was performed with a60Co gamma irradiator (2200 Tbq; CIS Bio International, France). Cell suspensions were filtered to avoid side effects due to radiolysis of the culture medium. After gamma irradiation (25–100 Gy, dose delivery 35 Gy/min), cells were suspended in the culture medium and harvested at the indicated time intervals. Whole plants were irradiated individually followed by the isolation of the indicated tissues. UV-B (312 nm) irradiation was carried out on mature rosettes before bolting with a dose delivery of 1.25 J/cm2/h. After treatments, samples were collected and stored at −80 °C. Poly(A)+ RNA from plant tissues or cell cultures were prepared as described by Montané et al.(25Montané M.H. Dreyer S. Triantaphylides C. Kloppstech K. Planta. 1997; 202: 293-302Crossref Scopus (73) Google Scholar). DD-RTPCRs were carried out with purified mRNA preparations from untreated and gamma-irradiated cells as described by Liang and Pardee (26Liang P. Pardee A. Science. 1992; 257: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar). For Northern blot analyses, samples (5 μg) of poly(A)+ RNA were transferred to Hybond-N nylon membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and hybridized with specific cDNA probes according to standard procedures (27Ausuebel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, Inc., Wiley, New York1994Google Scholar). Unless otherwise stated, hybridizations were carried out with the cDNA probe of interest andA. thaliana 25 S cDNA (internal control). Blots were scanned and quantified using Storm 840 PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics, S.A. Paris, France). Quantitative RT-PCR (28Godon C. Lagniel G. Lee J. Buhler J.M. Kieffer S. Perrot M.

Gen. Genet. 1991; 225: 468-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar) using primers specific for AtLPP1 (CGCAATTCTCAGGACCAGGAGGCGC and GGACCAGGAAGTGTGTCCGCTCGG) and for AtLPP2(CCACACATCTTGGTCGTTTGCTGGTC and CGGGTGGTGTCCCGCGTGTTGCTTC). Specific primers (GCTGAGAGATTCAGGTGCCC and GAGATCCACATCTGCTGG) for the constitutively expressed actin 8 gene (30An Y.Q. McDowell J.M. Huang S. McKinney E.C. Chambliss S. Meagher R.B. Plant J. 1996; 10: 107-121Crossref PubMed Scopus (408) Google Scholar) were used as an internal control. PCRs were in the linear range. An Arabidopsis cDNA library (31Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) and a λ phage genomic DNA library were screened with the DD-RTPCR AtLPP1fragment as a probe using standard protocols (27Ausuebel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, Inc., Wiley, New York1994Google Scholar). Purified clones that gave strong positive hybridization signals with the plant DNA inserts were chosen for physical mapping and sequencing. The AtLPP1 and AtLPP2 open reading frames comprising the ATG initiator codon and the translation stop codon were amplified by PCR using AtLPP1-specific (CGGGATCCATGGACAATAGGGTCGGTTTTTC and ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCACAAT CTCACGACGACGGCC) and AtLPP2-specific (CGGGATCCATGCCTGAAATTCATTTGGG and ATAAGAATGCGGCCGCTCAACGTACGCTCTCTAGCTCTG) primers, respectively, using Pfu turbo polymerase (Stratagene). The PCR fragments were digested with NotI/BamHI and cloned into the NotI/BamHI sites of the multicopy shuttle vector pCM185 (32Gari E. Piedrafita L. Aldea M. Herrero E. Yeast. 1997; 13: 837-848Crossref PubMed Scopus (506) Google Scholar) for expression of the plant cDNAs in yeast under the control of the tetR promoter. Methods for yeast growth, sporulation, and tetrad analysis were performed as described previously (27Ausuebel F.M. Brent R. Kingston R.E. Moore D.D. Siedman J.G. Smith J.A. Struhl K. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Greene Publishing, Inc., Wiley, New York1994Google Scholar). Yeast cultures were grown at 28 °C in YPD medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose) or in complete synthetic SD medium supplemented with 2% glucose. The appropriate amino acid of complete synthetic SD medium was omitted for selection purposes.Escherichia coli strain DH5α was grown at 37 °C in LB medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl (pH 7.4). Ampicillin (100 mg/ml) was added to the culture medium of DH5α cells that carried plasmids. Media were supplemented with 2 (yeast) or 1.5% (bacteria) agar for growth on plates. Cell numbers were determined spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 600 nm. The diploid S. cerevisiae strain YPH500xYPH499 (33Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used as a genetic background for the disruption of the DPP1 andLPP1 genes and the heterologous expression of theArabidopsis AtLPP1 and AtLPP2 cDNAs. To obtain the dpp1Δ lpp1Δ double mutant, the resident genes were successively disrupted by the insertion of selection marker genes allowing growth on appropriate selective media. Gene disruption was carried out according to the method of Baudinet al. (34Baudin A. Ozier-Kalogeropoulos O. Denouel A. Lacroute F. Cullin C. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 3329-3330Crossref PubMed Scopus (1127) Google Scholar). The DPP1 gene was disrupted by insertion of the S. cerevisiae HIS3 gene, and theLPP1 gene was disrupted by insertion of theKluyveromyces lactis URA3 gene. Haploid dpp1Δ and lpp1Δ mutant strains were selected by tetrad analysis. A dpp1Δ mutant was crossed with an lpp1Δ to form a diploid strain that was heterozygous for the DPP1 andLPP1 alleles. Putative dpp1Δ lpp1Δ double mutants were selected for their ability to grow on complete synthetic SD media lacking both histidine and uracil. The disruption of the chromosomal copies of the DPP1 and LPP1 genes was confirmed by PCR and Northern blot analysis. Strain 239 was one of the haploid dpp1Δ lpp1Δ mutants that was isolated and used for the expression of the ArabidopsiscDNAs. The total membrane fraction was isolated from exponential phase yeast cells as described by Tokeet al. (35Toke D.A. Bennett W.L. Oshiro J. Wu W.I. Voelker D.R. Carman G.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 14331-14338Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined with the BCA microassay reagent (Pierce) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. Mg2+-independent PA phosphatase activity was measured by following the release of water-soluble32Pi from chloroform-soluble 32P-PA (10,000 cpm/nmol). The reaction mixture contained 50 mmTris maleate buffer (pH 6.5), 0.1 mm PA, 1 mmTriton X-100, 2 mm Na2EDTA, 10 mm2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. DGPP phosphatase activity was measured by the release of water-soluble [32P] from chloroform-soluble [β-32P]DGPP (5000–10,000 cpm/nmol) as described by Wuet al. (36Wu W.I. Liu Y. Riedel B.

The reaction mixture contained 50 mm citrate buffer (pH 5.0), 0.1 mm DGPP, 2 mm Triton X-100, 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol, and enzyme protein in a total volume of 0.1 ml. [32P]PA was synthesized from DG using E. coli DG kinase (37Waggoner D.W. Gomez-Munoz A. Dewald J. Brindley D.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 16506-16509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), and DGPP was synthesized from PA using purified Catharanthus roseusPA kinase as described previously (36Wu W.I.

All enzyme assays were conducted at 30 °C in triplicate. The enzyme reactions were linear with time and protein concentration. Activities were expressed as pkatal (pmol of product/s) per mg of protein. Kinetic data were analyzed according to the Michaelis-Menten equation using SigmaPlot software with nonlinear regression algorithms. By using differential display methodology (26Liang P. Pardee A. Science. 1992; 257: 967-970Crossref PubMed Scopus (4707) Google Scholar), we identified an mRNA species that rapidly increased in response to severe radiation stress. The display gel shown in Fig.1 A revealed a 400-bp RT-PCR DNA fragment that accumulated in mRNA preparations from irradiated cells with respect to RNA preparations from unstressed control cells. In Northern blot hybridization experiments, the purified DNA fragment hybridized to a single RNA species of about 1.3 kilobase pairs that rapidly and transiently accumulated in mRNA populations extracted from irradiated cell suspensions (Fig. 1 B). The 8-fold elevation of hybridizing mRNA levels in response to radiation stress was restricted in time to 30 min immediately following the radiation injury. After this initial induction, the mRNA levels rapidly returned to near basal levels. We isolated a 1350-bp cDNA from an Arabidopsis cDNA library (31Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar), which shared complete sequence identity with the DD-RTPCR fragment at its 3′ end. We also isolated the genomic DNA for this gene from an A. thaliana genomic DNA library. Comparison of the genomic DNA and cDNA revealed the existence of two putative initiator ATG codons, separated by the insertion of an intron (Fig.2 A). This gene is located on chromosome II (Arabidopsis Genome Sequencing Program). The open reading frame of 984 nucleotides on the cDNA codes for a putative 35-kDa integral membrane protein, containing six highly hydrophobic regions of sufficient length to be membrane spanning that are designated TM1–6 (Fig. 2 D). The putative protein contains a 3-domain phosphatase sequence motif (38Stukey J. Carman G.M. Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar) that is conserved in several lipid phosphate phosphatase enzymes in S. cerevisiae and in mammalian cells (7Waggoner D.W.

The size of AtLPP2 cDNA (Arabidopsis EST clone 158J20-XP3′) is 1131 bp with an open reading frame of 873 nucleotides coding for a putative protein of 291 amino acids (Fig. 2 B). The corresponding gene was identified by systematic sequencing of chromosome I (GenBankTMaccession number AC007591). The gene encoding the putative AtLpp3p protein of 35 kDa (Fig. 2 C) was found by sequencing of chromosome III BAC F16B3 genomic DNA (GenBankTMaccession number AC021640). In striking difference toAtLPP1, the AtLPP2 and AtLPP3 genes are organized in similar exon/intron structures (Fig. 2, Band C). The AtLPP2 gene, deduced from sequence comparison of its cDNA with the genomic DNA, is interrupted by seven introns in the genome. The start of the open reading frame is near the 5′ end of the second intron. The genomic AtLPP3 DNA downstream of the putative ATG initiator codon is organized into seven exons of similar size and separated by six introns of similar size, which may indicate that the two genes have evolved by a recent duplication from a common ancestor gene. This assumption is further strengthened by the extent of sequence conservation at the level of nucleic acids (AtLPP2/AtLPP3 47.8%,AtLPP1/AtLPP2 30.2%, and AtLPP1/AtLPP3 18.3%). The data shown in Fig. 3 indicate that the deduced amino acid sequence of the three putative lipid phosphate phosphatase proteins are highly conserved (AtLpp1p/AtLpp2p 54.1%, AtLpp1p/AtLpp3p 54.9%, and AtLpp2p/AtLpp3p 59.7%). This sequence conservation does not take into account the hypervariable C-terminal extensions and the AtLpp1p-specific extension at the N terminus, which brings about the question whether two AtLpp1p splice variants exist, and whether this extension has the function of a leader peptide triggering subcellular localization. However, we have not found a short version of the AtLPP1 mRNA. The lipid phosphatase motif (denoted by asterisks) is located in virtually invariant domains of the three Arabidopsis lipid phosphate phosphatase proteins. These domains are juxtaposed to the proposed membrane-spanning regions in a way that the conserved domains probably form an important three-dimensional component for the proteins (7Waggoner D.W.

Protein Sci. 1997; 6: 469-472Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). This model has been confirmed by the mutational analysis of theS. cerevisiae DPP1 and mouse LPP1 genes, demonstrating that single amino acid changes in each phosphatase consensus domain (large asterisks in Fig. 3) are sufficient to produce severe losses of lipid phosphate phosphatase activity (39Toke D.A.

J. 2000; 345: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). These amino acid residues are conserved in theArabidopsis proteins. We constructed a phylogenetic tree of members of the lipid phosphate phosphatase protein family including the ArabidopsisAtLpp1p, AtLpp2p, and AtLpp3p proteins (Fig.4). Although it was not possible to determine the exact location of the tree root, nevertheless the phylogenetic tree was clearly split into two major branches whose separation is a remote event. The Arabidopsis proteins were grouped with the S. cerevisiae Dpp1p and Lpp1p proteins in one main branch, whereas all animal lipid phosphate phosphatase proteins were grouped in the other main branch, with the exception of the putative Drosophila melanogaster Lpp-like protein Q9VND6 (Fig. 4). The recent multiplication of the A. thalianaLpp-like proteins leads to the formation of two distinct subgroups, one specified by the AtLpp1p protein and the other composed of the AtLpp2p and AtLpp3p proteins. Collectively, these analyses indicated that theArabidopsis proteins were lipid phosphate phosphatase enzymes. The analysis of one member of each subgroup, namely theAtLPP1 and AtLPP2 genes and their encoded proteins, is described below. The analysis of AtLPP3 gene and its product will be described elsewhere.

Based on our previous studies (31Kim C.-G. Kirschning A. Bergon P. Ahn Y. Wang J.J. Shibuya M. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4941-4943Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar, 32Kim C.-G.

Nitrogen is introduced at the earliest biosynthetic step to form an amino analog of 3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (DAHP). Proposed intermediates such as 3,4-dideoxy-4-amino-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate (aDAHP), 5-deoxy-5-amino-3-dehydroquinate (aDHQ), and 5-deoxy-5-amino-3-dehydroshikimate (aDHS) were synthesized and shown to be efficiently converted into AHBA in crude cell-free extracts of the rifamycin B producer, A. mediterranei S699, and the ansatrienin A producer, Streptomyces collinus Tü1892. However, the normal shikimate biosynthesis pathway intermediate, DAHP, did not seem to give rise to AHBA under the same conditions, although phosphoenolpyruvate plus erythrose 4-phosphate were indeed converted into aDAHP and AHBA, albeit in very low yield. The enzyme which aromatizes aDHS to form AHBA has been purified fromA. mediterranei S699 (33Kim C.-G., Yu, T.-W. Fryhle C.B. Handa S. Floss H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 6030-6040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (113) Google Scholar). The encoding gene,rifK, has been cloned, sequenced, and verified through gene inactivation to be essential for the biosynthesis of the mC7N unit of rifamycin (33Kim C.-G., Yu, T.-W. Fryhle C.B. Handa S. Floss H.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 272: 6030-6040Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (113) Google Scholar). Along with the rifKgene, a region of 95 kb of DNA (Fig. 2) has been isolated and sequenced (34August P.R. Tang L. Yoon Y.J. Ning S. Müller R., Yu, T.-W. Taylor M. Hoffmann D. Kim C.-G. Zhang X. Hutchinson C.R. Floss H.G. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). This revealed five large open reading frames (ORFs) coding for a modular type I polyketide synthase, various putative modifying and regulatory genes, and a subcluster of ORFs, the rifG--N genes, some of which are homologous to genes involved in the shikimate biosynthetic and quinate utilization pathways of plants, bacteria and fungi (34August P.R. Tang L. Yoon Y.J. Ning S. Müller R., Yu, T.-W. Taylor M. Hoffmann D. Kim C.-G. Zhang X. Hutchinson C.R. Floss H.G. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). TherifG, -H, and -I genes, encoding homologues of a DHQ synthase, a plant-type DAHP synthase, and a shikimate or quinate dehydrogenase, respectively, are located upstream of the rifK gene. Surprisingly, the rifJ gene, which appears to encode a type II DHQ dehydratase homologue, is located outside this subcluster about 26 kb downstream from the rifKgene. Presumably, the rifH product has a similar enzymatic activity as DAHP synthase to condense phosphoenolpyruvate and erythrose 4-phosphate in the formation of aDAHP. The formation of aDHQ and aDHS would be expected to involve the rifG and -Jproducts to catalyze the cyclization and dehydration, respectively. TherifK product, AHBA synthase, then aromatizes aDHS to AHBA. The presence of the rifI gene is curious, as it suggests that the interconversion of aDHQ and 3-deoxy-3-aminoquinic acid or aDHS and 5-deoxy-5-aminoshikimic acid might play a role in AHBA formation. The nitrogen of AHBA was originally proposed to originate from the amide nitrogen of glutamine by action of an amidohydrolase (31Kim C.-G. Kirschning A. Bergon P. Ahn Y. Wang J.J. Shibuya M. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1992; 114: 4941-4943Crossref Scopus (46) Google Scholar). However, a subsequent 15N experiment did not support this notion (32Kim C.-G. Kirschning A. Bergon P. Zhou P. Su E. Sauerbrei B. Ning S. Ahn Y. Breuer M. Leistner E. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996; 118: 7486-7491Crossref Scopus (88) Google Scholar), and no homology to known amidohydrolases was seen in the entire rif cluster. The only gene obviously related to nitrogen metabolism is orf9, located 11 kb downstream of the rifK gene, which encodes an aminotransferase predicted to catalyze amination of a keto group to an aminosugar (34August P.R. Tang L. Yoon Y.J. Ning S. Müller R., Yu, T.-W. Taylor M. Hoffmann D. Kim C.-G. Zhang X. Hutchinson C.R. Floss H.G. Chem. Biol. 1998; 5: 69-79Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). Curiously, there are four genes, rifL, -M,-N, and -O, located immediately downstream ofrifK, which are not obviously shikimate pathway-related.RifO is homologous to certain regulatory genes but its inactivation did not decrease rifamycin B formation. 2R. Müller and M. Taylor, unpublished results. 2R. Müller and M. Taylor, unpublished results. The gene product of rifL is similar to a class of oxidoreductases that have been implicated in interconversions between hydroxyl and carbonyl groups, such as glucose-fructose oxidoreductase which oxidizes glucose to gluconolactone and reduces fructose to sorbitol in Zymomonas mobilis (37Loos H. Sahm H. Sprenger G.A. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1993; 107: 293-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The deduced peptide sequence of the rifMgene has considerable similarity with the CBBY family of phosphoglycolate phosphatases involved in glycolate oxidation (38Schaferjohann J. Yoo J.G. Kusian B. Bowien B. J. Bacteriol. 1993; 175: 7329-7340Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). TherifN gene product shows a significant similarity with the glucose kinase from Streptomyces coelicolor andBacillus megaterium involved in glucose repression (39Angell S. Schwartz E. Bibb M.J. Mol. Microbiol. 1992; 6: 2833-2844Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 40Spath C. Kraus A. Hillen W. J. Bacteriol. 1997; 179: 7603-7605Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the context of the current model of rifamycin biosynthesis, the observed homologies of the gene products of rifL,-M, and -N do not clearly reveal their functions. However, the juxtaposition of the rifK andrifL–N genes suggests that there is an organized subcluster or a potential operon that may be responsible for AHBA biosynthesis. In the present study we have examined the involvement of therifG–N, orf9, and rifJ genes in AHBA formation. We describe inactivation experiments for each of these genes and the biochemical characterization of the mutants generated. The rifG–N and -J genes were further subcloned and coexpressed in S. coelicolor YU105. All strains and plasmids used in this work are listed in TableI. A. mediterranei S699 was a gift from Dr. G. C. Lancini (Lepetit S.A., Varese, Italy) and was grown as described previously (33Kim C.-G., Yu, T.-W. Fryhle C.B. Handa S. Floss H.G. J. Biol.

The E. coli strain XL-1 Blue (Stratagene) was routinely used as the host strain for DNA manipulations and for constructing the gene-inactivated suicide vectors. The strain was grown in LB medium supplemented with carbenicillin (100 μg/ml) or hygromycin (100 μg/ml). S. coelicolor YU105 served as the host for the coexpression of the rifG–N and rifJ genes and was cultured in modified R5 medium (without sucrose) (35Hopwood D.A. Bibb M.J. Chater K.F. Kieser T.

Such regulation allows a control of cellular excitability in conditions when pH is low but ATP concentration is normal. However, whether the KATP changes its activity with pH alterations remains uncertain. In this study we showed that the reconstituted KATP was strongly activated during hypercapnia and intracellular acidosis using whole-cell recordings. Further characterizations in excised patches indicated that channel activity increased with a moderate drop in intracellular pH and decreased with strong acidification. The channel activation was produced by a direct action of protons on the Kir6 subunit and relied on a histidine residue that is conserved in all KATP. The inhibition appeared to be a result of channel rundown and was not seen in whole-cell recordings. The biphasic response may explain the contradictory pH sensitivity observed in cell-endogenous KATP in excised patches. Site-specific mutations of two residues showed that pH and ATP sensitivities were independent of each other. Thus, these results demonstrate that the proton is a potent activator of the KATP. The pH-dependent activation may enable the KATP to control vascular tones, insulin secretion, and neuronal excitability in several pathophysiologic conditions.

The pH-dependent activation may enable the KATP to control vascular tones, insulin secretion, and neuronal excitability in several pathophysiologic conditions. Hypercapnia and acidosis affect vascular tone, skeletal muscle contractility, insulin secretion, epithelial transport, and neuronal excitability, which may be mediated by KATP1 (1Aspinwall C.A.

However, previous studies on the pH sensitivity of these K+channels were controversial and even contradictory. In the absence of ATP, acidic pH was shown to stimulate cell-endogenous KATP(6Koyano T. Kakei M. Nakashima H. Yoshinaga M. Matsuoka T. Tanaka H. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 463: 747-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Vivaudou M. Forestier C. J. Physiol.

This inconsistency is further complicated by the indirect effect of ATP or Mg2+ and tissue-specific KATP species (8Allard B. Lazdunski M. Rougier O. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1995; 485: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Proks P. Takano M. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C1036-C1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Consequently, it is unclear whether KATP is modulated during hypercapnia and acidosis and what molecular mechanisms are underlying the modulations. The cloned KATP channels are ideal for addressing these questions because they allow for fine dissection of the modulatory mechanisms and elaborate manipulation of PCO2 and pH in an expression system (13Baukrowitz T. Tucker S.J. Schulte U. Benndorf K. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 14Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Liu C. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Therefore, we studied the modulation of the cloned KATP(Kir6 with SUR, Ref. 15Ashcroft F.M. Gribble F.M. Trends Neurosci. 1998; 21: 288-294Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar) by CO2 and acidic pH. To locate the pH sensors, we also studied Kir6.2 with a truncation of 36 amino acids at the C terminus (Kir6.2ΔC36) because it expresses functional channel without the SUR subunit and retains fair ATP sensitivity (16Tucker S.J. Gribble F.M. Zhao C. Trapp S. Ashcroft F.M. Nature. 1997; 387: 179-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar). Oocytes from Xenopus laevis were used in the present studies. Frogs were anesthetized by bathing them in 0.3% 3-aminobenzoic acid ethyl ester. A few lobes of ovaries were removed after a small abdominal incision (∼5 mm). Then, the surgical incision was closed and the frogs were allowed to recover from the anesthesia.Xenopus oocytes were treated with 2 mg/ml collagenase (Type I, Sigma) in an OR2 solution consisting of (in mm) NaCl 82, KCl 2, MgCl2 1, and HEPES 5 (pH 7.4) for 90 min at room temperature. After three washes (10 min each) of the oocytes with the OR2 solution, cDNAs (25–50 ng in 50 nl of water) were injected into the oocytes. For coexpression, Kir6.x and SUR1 were injected in a 1:2 ratio. The oocytes were then incubated at 18 °C in the ND-96 solution containing (in mm) NaCl 96, KCl 2, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 1.8, HEPES 5, and sodium pyruvate 2.5 with 100 mg/liter geneticin added (pH 7.4). Rat Kir6.1 (uKATP, GenBank™/EBI accession number D42145) and mouse Kir6.2 (mBIR, GenBank™/EBI accession number D50581) cDNAs were generously provided by Dr. S. Seino. Hamster SUR1 (GenBankTM accession number L40623) was a gift from Dr. L. Bryan. The cDNAs were subcloned to a eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA3.1, Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) and used forXenopus oocyte expression without cRNA synthesis. Site-specific mutations were produced using a site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). The orientation of the constructs and correct mutations were confirmed with DNA sequencing. Whole-cell currents were studied on the oocytes 2–4 days after injection using a two-electrode voltage clamp with an amplifier (Geneclamp 500, Axon Instruments Inc., Foster City, CA) at room temperature (∼24 °C). The extracellular solution contained (in mm) KCl 90, MgCl2 3, and HEPES 5 (pH 7.4). Extracellular acidification was done by titrating the extracellular solution to desired pH levels. The HEPES buffer was chosen because of its buffering range and membrane impermeability, as shown in our previous studies (17Qu Z. Zhu G.Y. Yang Z. Cui N. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H. Jiang C. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 13783-13789Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 18Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Qu Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 2000; 524: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). In intracellular acidification experiments, 90 mm KCl was replaced with the same concentration of KHCO3 (pH titrated to 7.4), so that the K+concentration remained the same in these experiments (19Fakler B. Schultz J.H. Yang J. Schulte U. Brandle U. Zenner H.P. Jan L.Y. Ruppersberg J.P. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). When oocytes were exposed to these perfusates, intracellular pH (pHi) and extracellular pH (pHo) were measured using ion-selective microelectrodes as described previously (14Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Liu C. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Whole-cell currents were also studied with nigericin (10 μm) at various bath pH levels. This protonophore forms cation channels permeable primarily to protons (20Grinstein S. Cohen S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 341-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 21Wilding T.J. Cheng B. Roos A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Using 90 mm K+ in the bath solution as permeable cation, pHi becomes the same as pHo in the presence of nigericin (20Grinstein S. Cohen S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 341-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar). Exposure to nigericin increased oocyte-endogenous currents at each pH point. The current changes in these pH points were measured in oocytes without any injection, averaged (n = 4), and subtracted from current records of the Kir6-expressing cells because the alterations were due to nigericin rather than changes of pHi in these cells. Experiments were performed in a semiclosed recording chamber (BSC-HT, Medical Systems Corp., Greenvale, NY) in which oocytes were placed on a supporting nylon mesh; the perfusion solution bathed both the top and bottom surface of the oocytes. The perfusate and the superfusion gas entered the chamber from two inlets at one end and flowed out at the other end. There was a 3 × 15-mm gap on the top cover of the chamber, which served as the gas outlet and an access to the oocytes for recording microelectrodes. At baseline the chamber was ventilated with atmospheric air. Exposure of the oocytes to CO2 was carried out by switching a perfusate that had been bubbled for at least 30 min with a gas mixture containing CO2 at various concentrations balanced with 21% O2 and N2 and superfused with the same gas (14Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Liu C. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 17Qu Z. Zhu G.Y. Yang Z. Cui N. Li Y. Chanchevalap S. Sulaiman S. Haynie H.

( Lond .). 2000; 524: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). The high dissolvability of CO2 resulted in a detectable change in intra- or extracellular acidification as fast as 10 s in these oocytes. Macroscopic and single-channel currents were recorded in excised patches at room temperature (∼24 °C) as described previously (22Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar,23Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). In brief, the oocyte vitelline membranes were mechanically removed after being exposed to hypertonic solution (400 mosmol) for 5 min. Recordings were performed on the stripped oocytes using the same solution applied to bath and recording pipettes. The solution contained (in mm) KCl 10, potassium gluconate 130, potassium fluoride 5, EGTA 1, and HEPES 10 (pH 7.4). A parallel perfusion system was used to deliver low pH perfusates at a rate of ∼1 ml/min with no dead space (22Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Macroscopic and single-channel currents were analyzed using the pClamp 6 software as detailed previously (22Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Data are presented as means ± S.E. analysis of variance or Student's t test was used. Differences of CO2and pH effects before versus during exposures were considered to be statistically significant if p ≤ 0.05. Expressions of Kir6.2 together with SUR1 (Kir6.2+SUR1) inXenopus oocytes produced K+ currents with clear inward rectification in whole-cell recordings and ATP-dependent inhibition in inside-out patches. When oocytes expressing Kir6.2+SUR1 were exposed to 15% CO2(14Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Liu C. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 18Xu H. Cui N. Yang Z. Qu Z. Jiang C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 2000; 524: 725-735Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), massive activation of the whole-cell inward rectifying currents occurred (129 ± 31%, n = 5). Similar channel activation was observed in Kir6.2ΔC36 (143 ± 15%,n = 11), whose CO2 sensitivity did not show any significant difference from the Kir6.2+SUR1 and Kir6.2ΔC36+SUR1 (p > 0.05), indicating that the CO2-sensing mechanism is located on the Kir6.2 subunit (Fig. 1, A and B). The effect was reversible and dependent on CO2concentrations. An apparent increase in the current amplitude was seen with PCO2 as low as 7.6 torr (1%), and higherPCO2 resulted in stronger activation (Fig.1 C). Interestingly, the Kir6.1+SUR1 showed a similar CO2 sensitivity (141 ± 28%, n = 6; Fig. 1 B), suggesting that various KATP channels consisting of Kir6.1 or Kir6.2 are likely to be activated by CO2. In contrast, Kir2.1 had no response to 15% CO2, whereas Kir1.1, Kir2.3, and Kir4.1 were inhibited (Fig. 1 B). To understand whether the channel activation was produced by pH changes, currents were studied with a selective decrease in intracellular pH (pHi) to 6.6 or extracellular pH (pHo) to 6.2 as we have previously measured during CO2 (15%) exposure (14Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Liu C. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Selective intracellular acidification using bicarbonate (14Zhu G.Y.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 4093-4099Crossref PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar) without changing pHo activated the Kir6.2ΔC36 currents by 162 ± 31% (n = 4), which showed no significant difference from the hypercapnic effect (p> 0.05, Fig. 1, D and E). Lowering pHoto 6.2 without changing pHi, however, increased the currents only modestly (8 ± 2%, n = 4; Fig.1 E), suggesting that the channels are stimulated predominantly by intracellular protons. The pH sensitivity of whole-cell Kir6.2ΔC36 currents was examined by permeabilization of the plasma membranes using protonophore nigericin (10 μm) at various pHo levels (20Grinstein S. Cohen S. Rothstein A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1984; 83: 341-369Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 21Wilding T.J. Cheng B. Roos A. J. Gen. Physiol. 1992; 100: 593-608Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Graded activation of Kir6.2ΔC36 currents was seen with graded acidification (Fig.2 B). When the maximal activation was reached at pH ∼6.6, the current amplitude increased by 150 ± 11% (n = 6), which should mainly be produced by a drop in pH because acidic pHo had little effect on the currents. Thus, a consistent enhancement of the channel activity was demonstrated at pHi 6.6 in the presence or absence of CO2. To determine whether the channel activation is carried out by the inherent mechanism of Kir6.2 or mediated by cytosolic factors, Kir6.2ΔC36 and Kir6.2+SUR1 currents were studied in excised inside-out patches in the absence of ATP, ADP, and other cytosolic soluble factors (22Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Cui N. Jiang C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1999; 516: 699-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 23Yang Z. Xu H. Cui N. Qu Z. Chanchevalap S. Shen W. Jiang C. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 116: 33-46Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). Exposure of the internal surface of patch membranes to acidic pH augmented the macroscopic inward rectifying currents (Fig. 2 A). The peak activation occurred at pHi 6.6–6.8 (Fig. 2 B). A further decrease in pHi caused rapid inhibition of the Kir currents (Fig. 2,A and B). The inhibition appeared to be channel rundown because it was not seen in whole-cell recordings and channel activity showed little or no recovery during washout at pH 7.4, particularly after a long period of exposure in patches (>30 s). Thus, extremely acidic pH may accelerate KATP rundown as described previously (7Vivaudou M. Forestier C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1995; 486: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Davies N.W. Standen N.B. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol.

Tucker S.J. Schulte U. Benndorf K. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). A similar bell-shaped current-pHi relationship was observed in Kir6.2+SUR1 (Fig.2 B), further supporting the observation that pHi sensitivity is independent of the SUR subunit. Single-channel recordings showed that the current stimulation was mainly caused by augmentation of the open state probability (NPo) with concurrent moderate suppression (by 10.7 ± 0.2% measured at pH 6.2, n = 4) of the single-channel conductance. When the NPo was plotted as a function of pHi a bell-shapedNPo-pH relationship was also obtained, which was almost identical to the response of macroscopic currents to acidic pHi (Figs. 2 B and 3). The relationship of channel activity (i.e. macroscopic currents and NPo) versus pHican be described using a sum of two Hill equations with one for channel activation (pKa 7.15, h 2.0) and the other for channel rundown (pKa 6.48, h6.0) (Fig. 2 B). The pHi-dependent channel activation was virtually superimposed with that of whole-cell currents, consistent with the idea that the pH sensing mechanism exists inherently in the channel protein. If the pHi sensing is indeed an intrinsic property of the channel protein, there should be specific protein domains or amino acid residues responsible for the proton detection. To test this hypothesis, we performed site-directed mutagenesis on potentially titratable residues of histidine, an amino acid with its side chain pK (6.04) closest to the channel activation pKa (7.15). Among nine histidine residues studied in the intracellular N- and C-terminal domains, we found that His-175 was critical for the pHi sensitivity of Kir6.2ΔC36. Mutation of this residue to lysine (residue found in other Kir channels, H175K) or alanine (H175A) completely eliminated the proton-induced channel activation (Fig. 4). These mutants were even inhibited during hypercapnia in whole-cell recordings (Fig. 4,A and C) and by acidic pHi in excised patches (Fig. 4 B), which were also observed in mutants expressed with SUR1. Single-channel conductance of the H175K was significantly smaller than its wild-type counterpart (64.4 ± 0.9 picosiemens, n = 4; p < 0.05). Interestingly, a relief of channel rundown was seen in some of the His-175 mutations. In the H175K, NPo remained above 0.1 after 200 s of perfusion with a solution of pH 6.2 (n = 3). In contrast, NPodropped to below 0.01 within 40 s in the wild-type channel (n = 12) and H175A mutant under the same condition (n = 3). Mutations of other histidine residues had no significant effect on the CO2 sensitivity (p > 0.05, Fig. 4 C). Figure 4Dependence of the pH sensitivity on histidine residues. A, whole-cell currents were recorded from an oocyte expressing the H175A mutant Kir6.2ΔC36 under the same conditions as described in Fig. 1 A. The currents were no longer stimulated by hypercapnia, although current inhibition was seen.

WS, washout.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Finally, we examined if ATP and pH sensitivities depended on each other. It is known that the K185E mutation greatly reduces the ATP sensitivity of Kir6.2ΔC36 (24Reimann F. Ryder T.J. Tucker S.J. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1999; 520: 661-669Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). We found that the K185E had identical pH sensitivity to the wild-type Kir6.2ΔC36, whereas the H175K mutation did not affect the ATP sensitivity (Fig.5). KATP channels are regulated by ATP, ADP, and phospholipids (11Davies N.W. Standen N.B. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1992; 445: 549-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 24Reimann F.

Such modulations allow them to control cellular activity during energy insufficiency. In the present studies, we have demonstrated the proton as another KATPregulator. We have found that hypercapnia and acidic pH at near physiological levels augment KATP activity in striking contrast to other members of the Kir family that are either inhibited by acidic pH or lack response (Fig. 1 B) (29Nichols C.G. Lopatin A.N. Annu. Rev. Physiol. 1997; 59: 171-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar). The effect of hypercapnia is likely to be mediated by a decrease in intracellular pH, inasmuch as similar channel activation occurs with a drop in pHi but not pHo. In cell-free excised patches we have found a moderate decrease in pHi augments KATP activity consistent with our whole-cell recordings in which pHi drops to 6.6 with 15% CO2 (14Zhu G.Y. Chanchevalap S. Liu C. Xu H. Jiang C. J. Cell. Physiol. 2000; 183: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). A further decrease in pHi causes channel rundown in excised patches consistent with previous observations (7Vivaudou M. Forestier C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1995; 486: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 11Davies N.W. Standen N.B. Stanfield P.R. J. Physiol.

Tucker S.J. Schulte U. Benndorf K. Ruppersberg J.P. Fakler B. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 847-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Such channel stimulation followed by inhibition may explain by and large the contradictory results of the pH sensitivity obtained previously in the cell-endogenous KATP using excised patches,i.e. when the KATP is studied with moderate acidification in a short period of exposure, channel activity increases. On the other hand, lower pH levels with a longer period of exposure produces channel inhibition with poor reversibility (8Allard B. Lazdunski M. Rougier O. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1995; 485: 283-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 9Proks P. Takano M. Ashcroft F.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1994; 475: 33-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). In the presence of ATP, however, channel rundown is largely diminished so that only activation remains (6Koyano T. Kakei M. Nakashima H. Yoshinaga M. Matsuoka T. Tanaka H. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1993; 463: 747-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar, 7Vivaudou M. Forestier C. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1995; 486: 629-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 8Allard B.

Physiol. 1994; 267: C1036-C1044Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Because the biphasic response to acidic pH is not seen in our whole-cell recordings with severe hypercapnia (15% CO2) and acidification (pH 5.8), the channel inhibition or rundown may not occur in intact cells. Our current studies have also begun to shed insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying KATP activation during acidosis. We have shown that the pH-sensing mechanisms are located on the Kir6 subunit rather than in the SUR. Indeed, we have demonstrated that mutation of a single histidine residue (H175A or H175K) is sufficient to eliminate completely the acid-induced channel activation. Instead of stimulation, the His-175 mutants show a significant inhibition by hypercapnic acidosis. The inhibition appears to suggest that the pH-dependent channel rundown may include a proportion of channel inhibition that is not seen in the wild-type channels under whole-cell recordings when the channel activation is dominant. The channel inhibition manifests itself when the channel stimulation is eliminated, as for His-175 mutations. When this inhibition is considered, the activation phase of the pH-current relationship curve shown in Figs. 2 B and 5A can be even steeper. The inhibition, however, cannot totally account for the pH-dependent rundown, because rundown, though relieved in the H175K, is still seen in the H175A mutation. The histidine-dependent pH sensitivity thus is consistent with the proton-mediated regulation of a large number of proteins. Because the histidine is conserved in both Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 in all known species (Fig. 4 D), it is very likely that the pH-sensing mechanism exists in KATP channels in various tissues. This unique site may offer an approach to control the KATPselectively without interference of other Kir channels. Our data indicate that pH sensitivity is independent of ATP for the following reasons: 1) acid-induced channel activation is seen in the absence of ATP; 2) channel pH sensitivity in excised patches resembles that in whole-cell recordings; 3) the K185E mutation greatly reduces ATP sensitivity without affecting the pH sensitivity; and 4) the H175K mutation does not compromise the ATP sensitivity. Therefore, proton sensing in the KATP is very unlikely to be mediated by ATP, although it may be modulated by ATP. Because a drop in pH often accompanies metabolic stresses and is more frequently seen than sole energy depletion, pH sensitivity enables the KATP channels to play a role in a wide variety of pathophysiological conditions. Pharmacological manipulation of the KATP in coronary arteries and cerebral vasculature has been shown to affect vascular tones during hypercapnia and acidosis (5Wei E.P. Kontos H.A. Stroke. 1999; 30: 851-853Crossref PubMed Scopus (23) Google Scholar, 30Ishizaka H. Gudi S.R. Frangos J.A. Kuo L. Circulation. 1999; 99: 558-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). KATP may be activated by lactoacidosis during skeletal muscle fatigue (31Light P.E. Comtois A.S. Renaud J.M. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1994; 475: 495-507Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), contributing to the decrease in tetanic force and the protection against injury (3Gramolini A. Renaud J.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 272: C1936-C1946Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Excessive neuronal activity also reduces pHi (32Trapp S. Luckermann M. Brooks P.A. Ballanyi K. J. Physiol. ( Lond .). 1996; 496: 695-710Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), which may activate the KATP, leading to a suppression of hyperexcitability and a cessation of seizure activity (2Dost R. Rundfeldt C. Epilepsy Res. 2000; 38: 53-66Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Therefore, the demonstration of KATPmodulation by pHi has a profound impact on understanding cellular functions during metabolic stress and offers a potential intervention to control the cellular activity by manipulating the inherent pH sensing mechanism of the KATP channels in the treatment and prevention of stroke, epilepsy, diabetes mellitus, and coronary heart diseases.

However, unlike classically apoptotic cells, which are disintegrated by membrane blebbing and vesiculation, aging lens fiber cells are compressed into the center of the lens, where they undergo cell-cell fusion and the formation of specialized membrane interdigitations. In classically apoptotic cells, caspase cleavage of the cytoskeletal protein α-spectrin to ∼150-kDa fragments is believed to be important for membrane blebbing.

These fragments continue to accumulate with age so that in the oldest fiber cells of the adult lens, most, if not all, of the spectrin is cleaved to discrete fragments. Thus, unlike classical apoptosis, where caspase-cleaved spectrin is short lived, lens fiber cells contain spectrin fragments that appear to be stable for the lifetime of the organism. Moreover, fragmentation of spectrin results in reduced membrane association and thus may lead to permanent remodeling of the membrane skeleton.

Rimm D. Kennedy S. Cianci C. Sinard J. Weed S. Hoffman J. Jamieson J. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, London1997: 485-540Google Scholar). The major component of the membrane skeleton, spectrin, is composed of an α/β heterodimer that self-associates head-to-head to form a 200-nm extended tetramer filament. Spectrin cross-links actin filaments into an isotropic meshwork. This spectrin-actin meshwork is attached to the membrane by direct interactions of β-spectrin with membrane proteins and indirect interactions of β-spectrin with membrane attachment proteins such as ankyrin (2Lambert S. Bennett V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar).Proteolysis of α-spectrin (αII-spectrin, non-erythroid spectrin, or fodrin) to discrete fragments is implicated in changes in cell shape and membrane morphology which occur in many cell types. During platelet activation, which includes a cell shape transformation from discs into irregular spheres, spectrin is cleaved to ∼150-kDa fragments by the calcium-dependent protease, calpain (3Fox J.E.B. Reynolds C.C. Morrow J.S. Phillips D.R. Blood. 1987; 69: 537-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Spectrin cleavage by calpain has also been implicated in cellular hypoxia (4Glantz S. Morrow J. Haddad G. Lister G. Tissue Oxygen Deprivation: Developmental, Molecular, and Integrated Function. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 153-191Google Scholar), neuronal injury and degeneration (5Roberts-Lewis J.M. Siman R. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

However, in apoptotic cells, α-spectrin proteolysis to ∼150-kDa fragments is mediated by caspases; in these cells, spectrin proteolysis is thought to be important for the disintegration of the plasma membranes via formation of vesicular “apoptotic bodies” (7Wang K.K.

Although calpain cleavage of spectrin is known to affect its ability to bind membranes or actin filaments (13Hu R.-J. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18200-18205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Harris A.S. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar), the detailed consequences of caspase cleavage of spectrin have not been studied.The terminal differentiation and aging of lens fiber cells are marked by dramatic membrane morphological changes. As new cells arise on the outside of the lens, older cells are pushed inward, where organelles are lost, and cells fuse to form a syncytium (15Rafferty N. Maisel H. The Ocular Lens: Structure, Function, and Pathology. Marcel Dekker, New York1985: 1-60Google Scholar, 16Shestopalov V. Bassnett S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1913-1921PubMed Google Scholar). Because these cells are never lost from the lens, the most central cells are as old as the organism. In addition, as lens fiber cells mature, specialized membrane interdigitations develop, which are distributed regularly on the lateral membranes (17Kuszak J.R. Peterson K.L. Brown H.G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 441-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). These age-related changes in membrane morphology have been compared with the formation of apoptotic bodies (18Dahm R. Ophthalmic Res. 1999; 31: 163-183Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In addition, they are believed to be important for lens transparency by reducing light scattering at cell boundaries and by allowing for protein turnover and ion homeostasis (16Shestopalov V. Bassnett S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1913-1921PubMed Google Scholar).We have shown previously that spectrin and other components of the membrane skeleton are associated with the plasma membranes of young and old lens fiber cells (19Lee A. Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Here, we report that α-spectrin is cleaved to ∼150-kDa fragments during terminal differentiation and aging of lens fiber cells. In addition, β-spectrin, which dimerizes with α-spectrin, is also proteolyzed to ∼120- and ∼80-kDa fragments. Fragmentation of spectrin progresses with lens and fiber cell age so that in the oldest fiber cells of the adult lens, most, if not all, of the spectrin is fragmented. The spectrin-binding and membrane-binding protein, ankyrin, is also partially proteolyzed with lens fiber cell age. N-terminal amino acid sequencing of the spectrin fragments reveals that caspase cleavage is responsible for lens spectrin proteolysis. Moreover, subcellular fractionation of lens fiber cells indicates that caspase-cleaved spectrin fragments display reduced association with lens membranes. The specific proteolysis of membrane skeleton components by caspases may be important for age-related membrane changes in the lens.DISCUSSIONThis is the first report of caspase cleavage of membrane skeleton proteins to discrete and stable fragments during cellular maturation and aging. We have shown that α-spectrin is cleaved to ∼150-kDa fragments and β-spectrin to ∼120- and ∼80-kDa fragments during lens fiber cell maturation and aging. The spectrin-binding protein, ankyrin, is also cleaved to ∼190-kDa fragments. These fragments appear to be extremely stable and indeed, accumulate with age. In contrast, in other cell types, caspase cleavage of spectrin precedes cell death, thus ensuring a short half-life for the spectrin fragments (7Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nath R. McGinnis K. Whitton M.

Chem. 1995; 270: 6425-6428Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (477) Google Scholar). Moreover, when cleavage of spectrin does not lead to cell death, (i.e. neuronal remodeling), a brief period of accumulation of fragments is followed by a decrease in the proportion of fragments to full-length spectrin polypeptides, suggesting replacement of spectrin fragments with newly synthesized full-length spectrin (36Di Stasi A.M. Gallo V. Ceccarini M. Petrucci T.C. Neuron. 1991; 6: 445-454Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). Our results indicate that in lens fiber cells, which do not undergo cell death, the accumulation of caspase cleavage products of spectrin and ankyrin may lead to a permanent remodeling of the membrane skeleton.The cleavage of membrane skeleton components in the lens is specific. In contrast to spectrin and ankyrin, other components of the membrane skeleton, tropomodulin, tropomyosin, and actin, do not appear to be proteolyzed during lens fiber cell aging (19Lee A. Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). However, there are reports of other membrane-associated lens proteins being proteolyzed to discrete and stable fragments. Partial proteolysis of the major lens membrane protein, MP-26 from a ∼26- kDa to a ∼20-kDa protein, has been reported to occur during fiber cell maturation (37Hoenders H.J. Bloemendal H. Bloemendal H. The Molecular and Cellular Biology of the Eye Lens. John Wiley and Sons, New York1981: 279-326Google Scholar). The gap junction protein connexin 50 (α8) has been shown to be cleaved by calpain, leading to removal of the C-terminal tail of the protein from the plasma membranes (38Lin J.S. Fitzgerald S. Dong Y. Knight C. Donaldson P. Kistler J. Eur. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 73: 141-149PubMed Google Scholar). Connexin 46 (α3) may also be cleaved in mature fiber cells (39Berthoud V.M. Cook A.J. Beyer E.C. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 1994; 35: 4109-4117PubMed Google Scholar). The lens-specific intermediate filament protein filensin is also proteolyzed to a discrete ∼53-kDa band in maturing fiber cells in the bovine lens (40Sandilands A. Prescott A. Hutcheson A. Quinlan R. Casselman J. FitzGerald P. Eur J. Cell Biol. 1995; 67: 238-253PubMed Google Scholar) and multiple bands in the chicken lens (19Lee A. Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Finally, ∼150-kDa α-spectrin fragments have been observed in the rabbit and guinea pig lens (41Fukiage C. Azuma M. Nakamura Y. Tamada Y. Shearer T.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 623-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) in addition to our observations in the chicken, rat, and cow lens. Partial proteolysis of particular membrane-associated proteins (and not others) to discrete and stable fragments may be important for membrane remodeling during lens fiber cell aging.The timing of spectrin fragmentation also implies roles in mediating membrane morphological changes during lens fiber cell aging. Spectrin fragments are first detected late during embryonic development, coincident with formation of the organelle-free zone (28Bassnett S. Beebe D.C. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 194: 85-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar), but continue to accumulate during development and after hatching. In the adult lens, spectrin fragmentation appears to be restricted to older fiber cells, and the amount of spectrin fragmentation increases with the age of the lens fiber cell. Unfortunately, it is difficult to compare the timing of spectrin fragmentation with that of other membrane-associated proteins because a similar developmental analysis has not been performed with other proteins. However, a functional syncytium of cells within the organelle-free zone is first detected at day 12 of embryonic development and expands with age (16Shestopalov V. Bassnett S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1913-1921PubMed Google Scholar). In addition, membrane protrusions are not present in the day 7 embryonic lens but are first observed later in the day 10 embryonic lens; these membrane protrusions become more elaborate with age (42Shestopalov V. Bassnett S. Invest. Ophthalmol. Visual Sci. 2000; 41: 859-863PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, in the adult chicken lens, newly differentiated cortical fiber cells exhibit smooth profiles, whereas older fiber cells display numerous membrane protrusions (43Kuszak J. Alcala J. Maisel H. Am. J. Anat. 1980; 159: 395-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). In support of a role for spectrin fragmentation in the development of membrane protrusions, antibodies, which recognize both full-length and fragments of α-spectrin stain protrusions of nuclear fiber cells (19Lee A. Fischer R.S. Fowler V.M. Dev. Dyn. 2000; 217: 257-270Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) as well as blebs decorating differentiated lens cells in culture. 2B. Fischer and V. M. Fowler, unpublished observations.This is the first report of caspase-mediated cleavage of membrane-associated components in the lens. Our data suggests that caspase-3 may be involved in proteolysis of spectrin during lens fiber cell maturation and aging. The sequence of the cleavage site for chicken lens α-spectrin is identical to that obtained by in vitro cleavage of bovine brain αII-spectrin by caspase-3. In addition, the sequences of cleavage for both chicken lens α- and β-spectrins (DETD*S, DEVD*S) match well with the consensus DXXD*S cleavage site identified for other caspase-3 substrates (44Earnshaw W. Martins L. Kaufmann S. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1999; 68: 383-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (2429) Google Scholar). In rat and cow lenses, the presence of the ∼110–120-kDa α-spectrin fragment generated by caspase-3 cleavagein vitro also suggests cleavage of endogenous lens α-spectrin by caspase-3 (7Wang K.K. Posmantur R. Nath R. McGinnis K. Whitton M. Talanian R.V. Glantz S.B. Morrow J.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 22490-22497Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (278) Google Scholar, 45Wang K. Trends Neurosci. 2000; 23: 20-26Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (805) Google Scholar). The lack of a ∼120-kDa fragment of α-spectrin in the chicken lens may be due to conformational differences between chicken and mammalian spectrins.Caspase activity has previously been shown to be necessary for loss of nuclei during lens fiber cell differentiation (46Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar, 47Ishizaki Y. Jacobson M.D. Raff M.C. J.

Nature. 1996; 384: 368-372Crossref PubMed Scopus (1700) Google Scholar). In addition, members of the caspase family (1Morrow J. Rimm D. Kennedy S. Cianci C. Sinard J. Weed S. Hoffman J. Jamieson J.

Tissue Oxygen Deprivation: Developmental, Molecular, and Integrated Function. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 153-191Google Scholar, 6Gitler D. Spira M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1123-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar) and the caspase substrates, DNA fragmentation factor and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase, have been identified in the lens (46Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar). Like spectrin, poly(ADP-ribose polymerase has also been reported to be cleaved late in lens development, after organelle loss (46Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar).Although our data suggest that caspase cleavage of the membrane skeleton occurs after organelle loss, others have reported that caspase activation is required for organelle loss. This apparent discrepancy may be explained by the idea that different caspases may be active at different times during lens fiber cell maturation. According to Wrideet al. (46Wride M.A. Parker E. Sanders E.J. Dev. Biol. 1999; 213: 142-156Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar), particular caspases (i.e. caspase-3) are present early during lens fiber cell differentiation, whereas others (i.e. caspase-1) are predominant in older lens fiber cells. Moreover, although inhibitors of caspases-1, -2, -6, and -9 appeared to inhibit nuclear loss in lens cell cultures, inhibitors of caspase-3 and -8 were ineffective. Both of these observations suggest that although the caspase pathway has not been delineated precisely for lens cells, particular caspases are important at different times during lens fiber cell differentiation. Thus, it is possible that specific caspases (particularly caspase-3) are important for selective proteolysis of the membrane skeleton after organelle loss, whereas other caspases are important for initiating organelle loss.What are the molecular consequences of caspase cleavage of spectrin and ankyrin? We have shown that spectrin fragments are partially dissociated from lens membranes. This may be due to cleavage of ankyrin, which binds to both β-spectrin and integral membrane proteins. Calpain-cleaved ankyrin, which, like lens ankyrin, is also a ∼190-kDa fragment derived from cleavage near the C terminus, exhibits an 8-fold weaker affinity for erythrocyte membranes (49Hall T. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10537-10545Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Alternatively, cleavage of β-spectrin could lead to reduced membrane association. However, the initial site of cleavage near the middle of the protein is not within its ankyrin binding site, actin binding site, or within any of the ankyrin-independent MADs (1Morrow J. Rimm D. Kennedy S. Cianci C. Sinard J. Weed S. Hoffman J. Jamieson J. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, London1997: 485-540Google Scholar). Thus, β-spectrin cleavage is unlikely to interfere with membrane association by direct interference with its membrane binding sites, but perhaps indirectly by affecting the conformation of these sites.Cleavage of lens spectrin by caspase may lead to lowered membrane affinity as well as calmodulin down-regulation of spectrin activities. The caspase cleavage site on α-spectrin is within 9 amino acids of the calpain cleavage site and is proximal to the calmodulin binding site (Fig. 4 B). When calmodulin is bound to α-spectrin during the action of calpain, both α- and β-spectrin subunits are cleaved, and the heterotetramer dissociates irreversibly into its component fragments (14Harris A.S. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). This results in complete loss of tetramer formation, F-actin binding, or membrane binding. Such a dissociation of spectrin fragments is reminiscent of the dissociation reported here which results from caspase-mediated cleavage of both subunits in the intact heterodimer.Interestingly, α- and β-spectrin are both cleaved at repeat 11, at sites that interact in the α-β-spectrin heterodimer (50Viel A. Branton D. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1996; 8: 49-55Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggesting that spectrin may be fully assembled before cleavage. In contrast, in other types of cells (1Morrow J. Rimm D. Kennedy S. Cianci C. Sinard J. Weed S. Hoffman J. Jamieson J. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, London1997: 485-540Google Scholar), calpain may either cleave the α- or β-spectrin subunits separately or together in the intact heterotetramer, thus leading to targeted loss of tetramer assembly, F-actin binding, or membrane binding (13Hu R.-J. Bennett V. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 18200-18205Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 14Harris A.S. Morrow J.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3009-3013Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). Thus, although other cell types may use a multistep process involving calpain and calmodulin to accomplish an incrementally regulated disassembly of the spectrin cortical skeleton, lens cells may use predominately caspase and calmodulin to disassemble their membrane skeleton in a single step process.We have developed a speculative model (Fig.6) to describe how specific and partial proteolysis of membrane skeleton proteins could lead to membrane morphological changes in the lens. In young (cortical) fiber cells (Fig. 6 A), as in other non-erythroid cells, α-β-spectrin tetramers are likely cross-linked to short actin filaments. This two-dimensional meshwork is then anchored to the membranes via spectrin interactions with ankyrin and other membrane proteins (1Morrow J. Rimm D. Kennedy S. Cianci C. Sinard J. Weed S. Hoffman J. Jamieson J. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, London1997: 485-540Google Scholar, 51Bennett V. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1029-1065Crossref PubMed Scopus (356) Google Scholar). In older fiber cells (Fig. 6 B), localized caspase activity could result in proteolytic cleavage of specific regions of the membrane skeleton, loosening constraints on the membranes and thus allowing for membrane blebbing in specific sites. The extent and placement of membrane blebbing could be regulated by whether ankyrin, α-spectrin, and/or β-spectrin are cleaved, or by calmodulin binding. With age, more caspase activity, and thus, more proteolytic processing, would occur. This could result in the increased density of membrane protrusions with fiber cell age (17Kuszak J.R. Peterson K.L. Brown H.G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 441-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Membrane blebbing could lead to repositioning of integral membrane proteins, such as ion channels, which might be necessary for age-related changes in ion and water flow (52Mathias R.T. Rae J.L. Baldo G.J. Physiol. Rev. 1997; 77: 21-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (339) Google Scholar). Moreover, membrane blebbing might lead to cell-cell fusion events that have been observed in maturing lenses (16Shestopalov V. Bassnett S. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 1913-1921PubMed Google Scholar, 17Kuszak J.R. Peterson K.L. Brown H.G. Microsc. Res. Tech. 1996; 33: 441-479Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar).Interestingly, cleavage of α-spectrin by calpain, not by caspase, has been associated with a number of cataract models (41Fukiage C. Azuma M. Nakamura Y. Tamada Y. Shearer T.R. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 623-635Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 53Kilic F. Trevithick J.R. Biochem. Mol. Biol. Int. 1998; 45: 963-978PubMed Google Scholar). Inhibition of calpain inhibits cataract formation and spectrin cleavage (54Wang K.K. Yuen P.W. Adv. Pharmacol. 1997; 37: 117-152Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), and human lenses with age-related nuclear cataracts display a higher density of finger-like membrane projections than transparent lenses of the same age (55Boyle D.L. Takemoto L.J. Curr. Eye Res. 1998; 17: 1118-1123Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Thus, it is possible that aberrant cleavage of spectrin by calpain may lead to uncontrolled or incomplete membrane furrowing and opacification of the lens, whereas specific cleavage of spectrin by caspase may be important for normal physiological functioning of the lens.In conclusion, partial and specific proteolysis of spectrin and ankyrin by caspases appear to effect an apoptosis-like program of membrane changes during lens aging. Further characterization of lens membrane morphology and membrane skeleton proteolysis in caspase knockouts, as well as additional biochemical analysis of the lens membrane skeleton, will lead to greater insight in the importance of caspase cleavage of membrane skeleton components during lens development and function. It is likely that the transparency of the aging lens nucleus may depend not only on organelle loss but also on membrane skeleton remodeling. We anticipate that these changes in the membrane skeleton, induced by caspase-mediated but limited proteolysis, will modulate ion homeostasis, the positioning of ion channels, the frequency of intercellular fusion events, and lens deformability. The spectrin-actin membrane skeleton underlies the plasma membranes of all cells and is important for cellular shape, membrane stability and deformability, as well as the formation of membrane subdomains (1Morrow J. Rimm D. Kennedy S. Cianci C. Sinard J. Weed S. Hoffman J. Jamieson J. Handbook of Physiology. Oxford University Press, London1997: 485-540Google Scholar). The major component of the membrane skeleton, spectrin, is composed of an α/β heterodimer that self-associates head-to-head to form a 200-nm extended tetramer filament. Spectrin cross-links actin filaments into an isotropic meshwork. This spectrin-actin meshwork is attached to the membrane by direct interactions of β-spectrin with membrane proteins and indirect interactions of β-spectrin with membrane attachment proteins such as ankyrin (2Lambert S. Bennett V. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 211: 1-6Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of α-spectrin (αII-spectrin, non-erythroid spectrin, or fodrin) to discrete fragments is implicated in changes in cell shape and membrane morphology which occur in many cell types. During platelet activation, which includes a cell shape transformation from discs into irregular spheres, spectrin is cleaved to ∼150-kDa fragments by the calcium-dependent protease, calpain (3Fox J.E.B. Reynolds C.C. Morrow J.S. Phillips D.R. Blood. 1987; 69: 537-545Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). α-Spectrin cleavage by calpain has also been implicated in cellular hypoxia (4Glantz S. Morrow J. Haddad G. Lister G. Tissue Oxygen Deprivation: Developmental, Molecular, and Integrated Function. Marcel Dekker, New York1995: 153-191Google Scholar), neuronal injury and degeneration (5Roberts-Lewis J.M. Siman R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1993; 679: 78-86Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar), and neuronal growth cone formation (6Gitler D. Spira M.E. Neuron. 1998; 20: 1123-1135Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar). However, in apoptotic cells, α-spectrin proteolysis to ∼150-kDa fragments is mediated by caspases; in these cells, spectrin proteolysis is thought to be important for the disintegration of the plasma membranes via formation of vesicular “apoptotic bodies” (7Wang K.K.

Signal. 2000; 12: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); it is activated by ATP and positively coupled to the cAMP and the phosphoinositide pathways. It has been cloned from a human cDNA placenta library, but it is specifically expressed in the immune system (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol.

In particular, P2Y11 messengers are present in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and strongly up-regulated following exposure to various agents inducing their differentiation into neutrophil-like cells (4Communi D.

Furthermore the induction of the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells by ATP is mediated through the activation of P2Y11 receptors (5Conigrave A.D. Lee J.Y. Van Der Weyden L. Jiang L. Ward P.

Edgar B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cloning of the human orthologue of yeastSsf1 was reported recently and the ubiquitous expression of human Ssf1 mRNA is consistent with a general role in cell growth (1Suarez-Huerta N. Boeynaems J.-M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Ssf1(a suppressor of swi four) should not be confused with the homonymousSsf-1 (a second step splicing factor 1), an activity involved in the second step of pre-mRNA splicing in S. cerevisiae (11Ansari A. Schwer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4001-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar).The presence of chimeric messengers resulting from intergenic splicing is not commonly observed in normal mammalian cells. It has been reported that cotranscription and intergenic splicing of human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase and interleukin-11 receptor α-chain genes generates a fusion transcript in normal cells (12Magrangeas F. Pitiot G. Dubois S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Chérel M. Jobert S. Lebeau B. Boisteau O. Lethé B. Mallet J. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. J. Biol.

EVI1 is a protooncogene encoding a nuclear protein with several zinc finger domains, whereasMDS1 has been cloned as one of the partner genes ofAML1 in the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation associated with myeloid leukemia. A third case reported in the literature is the intergenic splicing involving the murine Prnd andPrnp genes encoding the prion protein PrP and the PrP-like protein Doppel, respectively (14Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. Mastrangelo P. Wang K. Smit A.F. Katamine S. Carlson G.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B.

It has been speculated that intergenic splicing would be a mechanism for generating new multidomain proteins and could therefore have major evolutionary implications.During the screening of placenta cDNA libraries to isolate new P2Y receptors, we have isolated a cDNA clone encoding a SSF1-P2Y11 chimeric transcript. We have then investigated the tissue expression of this fusion mRNA and the biological activity of the corresponding fusion protein.RESULTSA human placenta cDNA library was screened at moderate stringency with a P2Y4 probe (spanning transmembrane domains 3–7) to isolate novel P2Y receptors. Some clones encoded a novel P2Y receptor that has been characterized and named P2Y11 receptor (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). One of the positive clones was clearly longer than the others (2500 base pairs (bp)). A 2385-bp open reading frame was identified in this clone (GenBankTM/EBI accession number: AJ300588). The first half of the corresponding protein displayed 40% amino acid identity with a S. cerevisiaeprotein involved in mating called Ssf1 (1Suarez-Huerta N. Boeynaems J.-M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar), whereas the second half exactly matched the P2Y11 sequence (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar).We have then obtained the complete cDNA and genomic sequences of human SSF1, which is split into 12 exons, and have shown that its mRNA is expressed in all human tissues tested (1Suarez-Huerta N. Boeynaems J.-M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). We have also shown that the P2Y11 and SSF1 genes are contiguous on chromosome 19p31 (Fig.1). The genomic organization of theSSF1 gene has been previously discussed (1Suarez-Huerta N. Boeynaems J.-M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Existence of the fusion cDNA is due to a transgenic splicing removing the genomic sequence included between the first third of the last exon of the SSF1 gene and the second exon of theP2Y11 gene (Fig. 1 A). This splicing occurs in the absence of a consensus splicing donor site (residue 426 of the SSF1 protein) (Fig. 1 B). The last 47 amino acids of the SSF1 protein (residues 427 to 473) are truncated in the fusion SSF1-P2Y11 protein. From these observations, it was clear that in fact the first three amino acids, MDR, of the P2Y11sequence, which we have previously published (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), were coming from the SSF1 sequence. In the placenta cDNA library, we had first obtained a partial clone of the SSF1-P2Y11 fusion protein in which these three amino acids appeared to be the beginning of the P2Y11 cDNA sequence (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). After we obtained the complete SSF1-P2Y11 fusion protein sequence and the genomic organization of the SSF1 gene, we performed PCR experiments to identify the true first exon of the P2Y11 gene to clarify its genomic organization. We have identified the first exon of the P2Y11 receptor by reverse-transcription PCR experiments using primers located upstream of potential ATG starting codons in the genomic sequence included between the last exon of theSSF1 gene and the second exon of theP2Y11 gene. The reverse primer was a specific primer located in the third transmembrane domain of the human P2Y11 receptor and contained a BamHI restriction site (in italic) (5′-TCGCGGATCCATGCCCAGGTAGCGGTTGAG-3′). These experiments were performed with RNA extracted from HL-60 cells in which it is known that the P2Y11 receptor is expressed (4Communi D. Janssens R. Robaye B. Zeelis N. Boeynaems J.-M. FEBS Letters. 2000; 475: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One of the PCR products sequenced has allowed us to identify the first exon of the P2Y11 gene, which is located 1.9 kb upstream of the second one. This 445-bp product was obtained using the reverse primer and the following 5′-primer containing an EcoRI restriction site (in italic) 5′-TCCGGAATTC TAGCAGACACAGGCTGAGGA-3′. The exon encodes the six first amino acids of the P2Y11receptor, MAANVS (Fig. 1 B). An in-phase stop codon (in bold and underlined in the 5′-primer) is located 33 bp upstream of the starting codon, which is in a Kozak consensus. In conclusion, the sequence MAANVSGAK is the true beginning of the non-chimeric P2Y11 receptor, whereas MDRGAK represents the junction between the SSF1 and P2Y11 gene products (Fig. 1 B). The correct non-chimeric P2Y11 sequence has been submitted to GenBankTM/EMBL (accession number: AJ298334).We have then investigated whether the fusion transcript could be translated into a functionally active chimeric receptor. Because there are 14 potential starting codons in the first half of the clone corresponding to the SSF1 part and potential extracellular region of this chimeric receptor, we have amplified 14 specific PCR products encoding chimeric proteins starting at each of these ATG codons. The sequences of these products have been checked after insertion in the pEFIN3 expression vector and transfected into CHO-K1 cell lines.In the transfected cells, the construction inducing the greatest functional response corresponded to the P2Y11 receptor alone, previously characterized following stable expression in CHO-K1 cells (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar, 6Communi D. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However each transfected chimeric construction led to a significant but much lower cAMP response to ATP (100 μm), even the construction corresponding to the full-length SSF1-P2Y11 fusion protein (Fig.2). The basal level was considerably lower in the cell lines transfected with the chimeric transcript as compared with the P2Y11-transfected cells, suggesting a constitutive activity of the P2Y11 receptor. No ATP response was observed with CHO-K1 cells transfected with the pEFIN3 empty vector, whereas the forskolin-induced cAMP accumulation was comparable in all the transfected cell lines (Fig. 2). The cAMP data obtained for the intermediate constructions were similar to those obtained for the full chimeric receptor (data not shown). Northern blotting revealed comparable amounts of messengers for the different constructions in the various transfected CHO-K1 cell lines (data not shown).Figure 2Effect of adenine nucleotides on cAMP accumulation in SSF1-P2Y11 and P2Y11-transfected CHO-K1 cells. The transfected CHO-K1 cells were incubated with or without ATP, benzoyl ATP (BzATP), and ATPγS (100 μm), and forskolin (FK) (1 μm) for 15 min.CONT, control (water). The data represent the mean ± S.D. of triplicate experimental points obtained in one experiment representative of three.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Other adenine nucleotides, known to produce a strong activation of the P2Y11 receptor, were tested on cells transfected with the chimeric SSF1-P2Y11 construction. ATPγS and benzoyl ATP behaved as full agonists of the chimeric receptor and were apparently more potent than ATP (Fig. 2) as observed previously for the recombinant P2Y11 receptor (6Communi D. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). No effect of ADP, UTP, or UDP was observed (data not shown).We have used a polyclonal antibody generated in the rabbit against a peptide located at the extremity of the C terminus of the P2Y11 receptor (AAPKPSEPQSRELSQ). This antibody was used on CHO-K1 cells transfected with P2Y11, full-length-SSF1-P2Y11, and with the empty vector (Fig.3). In P2Y11-transfected cells, three strong bands were clearly detected around 45 kDa. A weak single band was detected in SSF1-P2Y11-transfected cells around 90 kDa (Fig. 3). These bands were not detected in the presence of 2 μg/ml of the corresponding peptide (data not shown). No band was detected in CHO-K1 cells transfected with pEFIN3 vector alone in the absence (Fig. 3) or the presence of the corresponding peptide (data not shown).Figure 3Western blot analysis of P2Y11and SSF1-P2Y11 expression. Each lane was loaded with 130 μg of total proteins extracted from CHO-K1 cells transfected with either SSF1-P2Y11 or P2Y11 or was loaded with the empty vector. Immunodetection was achieved using the enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection system (ECL, Amersham). The anti-P2Y11 antibody was used at 1/200 dilution. The detected proteins are indicated by black arrows.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Northern blotting experiments were performed with specific probes of the SSF1 and P2Y11 genes (Fig.4, A and B) on a blot containing mRNA from 11 human tissues and blood leukocytes. With an SSF1 probe, two prominent messengers (1.7 and 5.6 kb) were revealed in each tissue. Additional weaker bands were also detected (2.6 and 3.5 kb) (Fig. 4 A). As shown previously, a P2Y11 probe hybridized to a 2-kb mRNA in human spleen (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) and liver (Fig. 4 B). However, a second band was present in each tissue (Fig. 4 B) and had a size indistinguishable from that revealed by the SSF1 probe at 5.6 kb. It seems that 1.7-, 2.6-, and 3.5-kb messengers were only detected with a SSF1 probe and correspond to SSF1 messengers (Fig. 4 A), whereas 2-kb messengers shown in panel B correspond to P2Y11messengers. The 5.6-kb band detected with the two probes corresponds apparently to a chimeric SSF1-P2Y11 messenger. This 5.6-kb unique band was also detected with a probe corresponding to the chimeric transcript and not with other unrelated probes (data not shown). A 5.6-kb messenger detected with a P2Y11 probe in the HL-60 cells (4Communi D. Janssens R. Robaye B. Zeelis N. Boeynaems J.-M. FEBS Letters. 2000; 475: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar) was also revealed with an SSF1 probe with a similar pattern (Fig. 4 C) and corresponded apparently to the chimeric SSF1-P2Y11 messenger. This messenger was up-regulated during granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells by retinoic acid (Fig. 4 C).Figure 4Northern blot analysis of SSF1 and P2Y11 messenger expression. Eachlane of the MTN blot (A and B) and the HL-60 blot (C) contains, respectively, 2 μg of poly(A)+ RNA and 15 μg of total RNA. Hybridization with the SSF1 (A and C) or P2Y11(B) probes was performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The HL-60 cells were differentiated during various times (h, hour(s); d, day(s)) with 1 μmretinoic acid (RA).

A. 1996; 93: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar), galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase and interleukin-11 receptor α-chain (12Magrangeas F. Pitiot G. Dubois S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Chérel M. Jobert S. Lebeau B. Boisteau O. Lethé B. Mallet J. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16005-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and Prnd andPrnp (14Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. Mastrangelo P. Wang K. Smit A.F. Katamine S. Carlson G.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B. Melton D.W. Tremblay P. Hood L.E. Westaway D. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 292: 797-817Crossref PubMed Scopus (473) Google Scholar). In this paper we have reported a new case of fusion mRNA resulting from in-frame intergenic splicing between the human SSF1 and P2Y11 genes; this is the first case involving a G-protein-coupled receptor. It is interesting to note that the transgenic splicing between these two unrelated genes leads to the addition of a potential ATP binding site present in SSF1 (GVGEGK, residues 289 to 294) to the sequence of a purinergic receptor. However, apparently this has no major effect on the responsiveness to nucleotides.We have clarified the genomic organization of theP2Y11 gene. An exon encoding the first six residues of the non-chimeric P2Y11 receptor has been identified 1.9 kb upstream of the second exon which encodes the seven transmembrane regions of the receptor. This first exon contains the starting codon and encodes a potential N-glycosylation site (MAANVS). This first exon is not present in the chimeric messenger. The first three residues of the previously published P2Y11 sequence, MDR, (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar) were thus a consequence of the intergenic splicing and belong in fact to the SSF1 sequence.Theoretically the fusion transcript encodes a receptor with a very large extracellular domain displaying no peptide signal sequence. Because binding assays using radiolabeled nucleotides are not a valid method to quantitate P2Y receptors (17Filtz T.M. Li Q. Boyer J.L. Nicholas R.A. Harden T.K. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 8-14PubMed Google Scholar, 18Motte S. Swillens S. Boeynaems J.-M. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 307: 201-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar, 19Schachter J.B. Harden T.K. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1997; 121: 338-344Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar), we have performed functional assays to determine whether the transfection of the chimeric cDNA could lead to a biochemical response to ATP in the transfected cells. Indeed cAMP assays showed that CHO-K1 cells transfected with a SSF1-P2Y11 construction exhibited a cAMP response to nucleotides qualitatively similar to that observed in cells expressing the P2Y11 receptor alone (6Communi D. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). However, both the basal cAMP level (reflecting possible constitutive activity) and the maximum accumulation of cAMP in response to ATP were much lower in cells expressing the fusion protein than in P2Y11-expressing cells. The pharmacological data could be correlated with the level of expression of the fusion protein, which seems clearly lower than that of the P2Y11 receptor. Whereas three strong bands, probably corresponding to different degrees of glycosylation, were observed in cells expressing the P2Y11 receptor, a weak 90-kDa band corresponding to the expected molecular mass of the fusion protein was detected in cells transfected with the SSF1-P2Y11 construction. Although the level of mRNA detected was comparable between cells transfected with the chimeric receptor and the P2Y11 receptor, we can speculate that the fusion protein is less translated or less stable than the P2Y11 receptor. It appears that the ATP response observed in cells expressing the fusion protein is not due to its cleavage at the fusion site because no lower band corresponding to the P2Y11 receptor was detected.Both P2Y11 and SSF1 probes detected the same 5.6-kb messenger with a similar pattern of intensity in each tissue. The detection of the chimeric transcript in all the tested tissues was surprising as was its up-regulation in HL-60 cells in response to an agent inducing granulocytic differentiation. It indicates that the cotranscription and transgenic splicing between theP2Y11 and the SSF1 genes is a frequent, ubiquitous, and regulated phenomenon. However its functional significance remains unclear. It is important to emphasize that we have obtained cAMP data for the chimeric receptor in a system of overexpression of the recombinant fusion protein, but it is unclear whether the chimeric transcript observed in all the tested tissues is translated into fusion protein in vivo. Indeed in most cells ATP is unable to increase cAMP. Alternatively, the production of SSF1-P2Y11 fusion mRNAs could be a way to down-regulate the expression of active P2Y11 receptors by misleading transcription, or the fusion protein might have another function which remains to be determined. P2Y11 and SSF1 are adjacent genes located on chromosome 19 (1). The P2Y11 receptor belongs to the P2Y family of G-protein-coupled nucleotide receptors (2Communi D. Janssens R. Suarez-Huerta N. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.-M. Cell. Signal. 2000; 12: 351-360Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar); it is activated by ATP and positively coupled to the cAMP and the phosphoinositide pathways. It has been cloned from a human cDNA placenta library, but it is specifically expressed in the immune system (3Communi D. Govaerts C. Parmentier M. Boeynaems J.-M. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 31969-31973Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). In particular, P2Y11 messengers are present in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and strongly up-regulated following exposure to various agents inducing their differentiation into neutrophil-like cells (4Communi D. Janssens R. Robaye B. Zeelis N. Boeynaems J.-M. FEBS Letters. 2000; 475: 39-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). Furthermore the induction of the granulocytic differentiation of HL-60 cells by ATP is mediated through the activation of P2Y11 receptors (5Conigrave A.D. Lee J.Y. Van Der Weyden L. Jiang L. Ward P. Tasevski V. Luttrell B.M. Morris M.B. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1998; 124: 1580-1585Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar, 6Communi D. Robaye B. Boeynaems J.-M. Br. J. Pharmacol. 1999; 128: 1199-1206Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar). On the other side, Ssf1 is a Saccharomyces cerevisiae nuclear protein, which plays an important role in mating (7Lycan D. Mikesell G. Bunger M. Breeden L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7455-7465Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar, 8Yu Y. Hirsch J.P.

Genetics. 1998; 149: 795-805Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).Ssf1 and its close homologue Ssf2 have been related to ppan, a gene involved in Drosophilalarval growth (10Migeon J.C. Garfinkel M.S. Edgar B.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1999; 10: 1733-1744Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The cloning of the human orthologue of yeastSsf1 was reported recently and the ubiquitous expression of human Ssf1 mRNA is consistent with a general role in cell growth (1Suarez-Huerta N. Boeynaems J.-M. Communi D. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2000; 275: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar). Ssf1(a suppressor of swi four) should not be confused with the homonymousSsf-1 (a second step splicing factor 1), an activity involved in the second step of pre-mRNA splicing in S. cerevisiae (11Ansari A. Schwer B. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4001-4009Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). The presence of chimeric messengers resulting from intergenic splicing is not commonly observed in normal mammalian cells. It has been reported that cotranscription and intergenic splicing of human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase and interleukin-11 receptor α-chain genes generates a fusion transcript in normal cells (12Magrangeas F. Pitiot G. Dubois S. Bragado-Nilsson E. Chérel M. Jobert S. Lebeau B. Boisteau O. Lethé B. Mallet J. Jacques Y. Minvielle S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 16005-16010Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The intergenic splicing between the MDS1 and EVI1genes has also been described (13Fears S. Mathieu C. Zeleznik-Le N. Huang S. Rowley J.D. Nucifora G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 1642-1647Crossref PubMed Scopus (187) Google Scholar). EVI1 is a protooncogene encoding a nuclear protein with several zinc finger domains, whereasMDS1 has been cloned as one of the partner genes ofAML1 in the t(3;21)(q26;q22) translocation associated with myeloid leukemia. A third case reported in the literature is the intergenic splicing involving the murine Prnd andPrnp genes encoding the prion protein PrP and the PrP-like protein Doppel, respectively (14Moore R.C. Lee I.Y. Silverman G.L. Harrison P.M. Strome R. Heinrich C. Karunaratne A. Pasternak S.H. Chishti M.A. Liang Y. Mastrangelo P. Wang K. Smit A.F. Katamine S. Carlson G.A. Cohen F.E. Prusiner S.B.

Mn-SOD has tumor suppressor activity in a wide variety of tumors and transformed cell systems. Our initial observations revealed that Mn-SOD expression was inversely correlated with expression of AP-2 transcription factors in normal human fibroblasts and their SV-40 transformed counterparts. Thus we hypothesized that AP-2 may down-regulate Mn-SOD expression. To examine the functional role of AP-2 on Mn-SOD promoter transactivation we cotransfected AP-2-deficient HepG2 cells with a human Mn-SOD promoter-reporter construct and expression vectors encoding each of the three known AP-2 family members. Our results indicated that AP-2 could significantly repress Mn-SOD promoter activity, and that this repression was both Mn-SOD promoter and AP-2-specific. The three AP-2 proteins appeared to play distinct roles in Mn-SOD gene regulation. Moreover, although all three AP-2 proteins could repress the Mn-SOD promoter, AP-2α and AP-2γ were more active in this regard than AP-2β. Transcriptional repression by AP-2 was not a general effect in this system, because another AP-2-responsive gene, c-erbB-3, was transactivated by AP-2. Repression of Mn-SOD by AP-2 was dependent on DNA binding, and expression of AP-2B, a dominant negative incapable of DNA binding, relieved the repression on Mn-SOD promoter and reactivated Mn-SOD expression in the AP-2 abundant SV40-transformed fibroblast cell line MRC-5VA. These results indicate that AP-2-mediated transcriptional repression contributes to the constitutively low expression of Mn-SOD in SV40-transfromed fibroblasts and suggest a mechanism for Mn-SOD down-regulation in cancer.

Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD)1 is a nuclear-encoded mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the first step in detoxification of O⨪2 radical anion (1Weisiger R.A. Fridovich I.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1973; 248: 4793-4796Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Mn-SOD is a primary antioxidant enzyme that is critical for maintaining normal cell function and survival. For example, Mn-SOD knockout mice develop cardiomyopathy and exhibit neonatal lethality (2Li Y. Huang T.T. Carlson E.J. Melav S. Ursell P.C. Olson J.L. Noble L.T. Yoshimura M.P. Berg C. Chan P.H.

Cancers from a variety of cell types and etiologies have been reported to exhibit decreased Mn-SOD activity (3Safford S.E. Oberley T.D. Urano M. St. Clair D.K.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 3113-3117Crossref PubMed Scopus (457) Google Scholar). Elevated Mn-SOD activity was also correlated with a loss of metastatic capabilities of tumor cells (3Safford S.E. Oberley T.D. Urano M. St. Clair D.K. Cancer Res. 1994; 54: 4261-4265PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, although it is clear that Mn-SOD has tumor-suppressing activity, the mechanism(s) underlying it decreased expression in cancer cells remains unknown. Activator protein-2 (AP-2) is a family of cell type-specific developmentally regulated transcription factors that have been implicated as critical regulators of gene expression during vertebrate development, embryogenesis, and carcinogenesis (10Schorle H. Meier P. Buchert M. Jaenisch R. Mitchell P.J. Nature. 1996; 381: 235-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (518) Google Scholar, 11Zhang J. Hagopian-Donaldson S. Serbedzija G. Elsemore J. Plehn-Dujowich D.

Tainsky M.A. Genes Dev. 1994; 8: 1258-1269Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). There are three known members of the AP-2 gene family, AP-2α, AP-2β, and AP-2γ (13Williamson J.A. Bosher J.M. Skinner A. Sheer D. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The three AP-2 genes are located at different loci in human genome. Somatic cell hybrids and in situ hybridization to chromosomes revealed that AP-2α gene is located at human chromosome 6p22.3–24 (14Gaynor R.B. Muchardt C. Xia Y. Klisak I. Mohandas T. Sparkes R.S. Lusis A.J. Genomics. 1991; 10: 1100-1102Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). AP-2β and AP-2γ genes mapped to human chromosomes 6p12 and 20q13.2, the latter being a region that is frequently amplified in breast carcinoma (13Williamson J.A. Bosher J.M. Skinner A. Sheer D. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Genomics. 1996; 35: 262-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar). The three proteins differ in their N-terminal transcription activation domains but show high conservation (75–85%) within their DNA binding and dimerization domains. All three proteins are capable of DNA binding and transcriptional transactivation (15Bosher J.M. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1701-1707PubMed Google Scholar). Gel mobility shift assays have shown that in vitro synthesized AP-2α, AP-2β, and AP-2γ can bind indistinguishably as homo- or heterodimers to probes corresponding to the AP-2 binding sites within the c-erbB-2 and human metallothionein IIA promoters (15Bosher J.M. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1701-1707PubMed Google Scholar, 16Moser M. Imhof A. Bauer R. Amselgruber W. Sinowartz F. Hofstadter F. Schule R. Buettner R. Development. 1995; 121: 2779-2788Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The consensus sequence for DNA binding by AP-2 is 5′-GCCN3GGC-3′ (17Mitchell P.J. Wang C. Tjian R. Cell. 1987; 50: 847-861Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (630) Google Scholar), although a number of sites that are specifically footprinted by AP-2α have been shown to differ from this consensus sequence (18Imagawa M. Chiu R. Karin M. Cell. 1987; 51: 251-260Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1030) Google Scholar). A role for AP-2 transcription factors in the development of cancer has become increasingly clear. AP-2 is involved in the development and progression of human melanoma by altering the regulation of the c-kit and MCAM/MUC18 genes (19Jean D. Gershenwald J.E. Huang S. Luca M. Hudson M.J.

In addition, AP-2 factors are involved in development or progression of the malignant phenotype of human breast cancer cells. AP-2 has been shown to participate in the regulation of the important oncogeneserbB-2 and erbB-3 (15Bosher J.M. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1701-1707PubMed Google Scholar, 22Bosher J.M. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 23Skinner A. Hurst H.C. Oncogene. 1993; 8: 3393-3401PubMed Google Scholar), as well as the cell cycle regulatory gene p21WAF1 (24Gee J.M. Robertson J.F. Ellis I.O. Nicholson R.I. Hurst H.C. J. Pathol. 1999; 189: 514-520Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 25Zeng Y.X. Somasundaram K. el-Deiry W.S. Nat. Genet. 1997; 15: 78-82Crossref PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar) and the extracellular matrix degrading enzyme MMP-2 (26Qin H. Sun Y. Benveniste E.N. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29130-29137Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Thus, the involvement of AP-2 factors in establishing and/or maintaining the cancer phenotype is well established. However, no study to date has focused on the effects of AP-2 in modulating the important and novel tumor suppressing function of Mn-SOD. We previously described a model system that differentially expressed AP-2 protein and DNA binding activity, the MRC-5 human lung fibroblast cell strain and its SV40-transformed counterpart MRC-5VA (27Huang Y. Domann F.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Interestingly, Mn-SOD expression was inversely correlated with AP-2α expression in this model system. In MRC-5VA cells that express low Mn-SOD levels, aberrant cytosine methylation in intron 2 was associated with decreased Mn-SOD expression; however, the Mn-SOD promoter displayed no genetic abnormalities (deletions, rearrangements, mutations) that could account for the decreased Mn-SOD expression (28Huang Y. He T. Domann F.E. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 643-652Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). These observations suggested that Mn-SOD expression might be regulated, at least in part, at the level of transcriptional initiation. The presence of multiple AP-2 motifs within Mn-SOD promoter region preceding the transcription initiation site (29Yeh C. Wan S.X. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) suggests that AP-2 proteins play an important role in the function of human Mn-SOD promoter. Thus, based on our previous findings, we hypothesized that AP-2 proteins participate in down-regulation of Mn-SOD gene expression. The human SOD2promoter reporter construct −555 Mn-SOD-pGL3, provided by Dr. Daret St. Clair (30Xu Y. Kiningham K.K. Devalaraja M.N. Yeh C. Majima H. Kasarskis E.J. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1999; 18: 709-722Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar), consisted of nucleotides −555 to +24 relative to the transcription start site cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter gene in pGL3-Basic vector (Promega, Madison, WI). The humanerbB-3 promoter reporter construct (erbB-3-pGL3) was made by fusing the human erbB-3 promoter fragment to a pGL3-Basic vector. The human erbB-3 promoter fragment consisting of 1118 nucleotides just upstream of the ATG start codon was generated by polymerase chain reaction. Dr. Trevor Williams provided the AP-2α cDNA (31Williams T. Admon A. Luscher B. Tjian R. Genes Dev. 1988; 2: 1557-1569Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar), which we subcloned into the pcDNA3 mammalian expression vector (Invitrogen). The AP-2β expression plasmid RSVNcoβ was provided by Dr. Helen Hurst (15Bosher J.M. Totty N.F. Hsuan J.J. Williams T. Hurst H.C. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1701-1707PubMed Google Scholar). The AP-2γ expression vector AP-2γ-pcDNA3 was provided by Dr. Ronald J. Weigel (32McPherson L.A. Weigel R.J. Nucleic Acids Res. 1999; 27: 4040-4049Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The human AP-2B expression plasmid pSG5-AP-2B was provided by Dr. Michael A. Tainsky (33Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Sun Y.O. Glockshuber R. Van Dyke M.W. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4174-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). The AP-2Δ cDNA (a mutant form of AP-2α with a deletion of the transactivation domain encompassing amino acids 31–117) was provided by Dr. Lubomir Turek and was subcloned into pcDNA3. The pCMV-β-gal reporter construct (CLONTECH) was used to determine transfection efficiencies. A purely AP-2-responsive reporter construct, 12× AP-2-tk CAT, was used to characterize AP-2 transactivating activity and its inhibition by the dominant negative AP-2 isoforms. This construct was made by fusing 12 AP-2-responsive elements of human MtIIA gene (5′-ACCGCCCGCGGCCCGTCTG-3′) to the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase promoter in the vector Basic-CAT (Promega, Madison, WI) that expresses bacterial chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) as a reporter gene. The normal human fetal lung fibroblast strain MRC-5 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC). The SV40-transfromed cell counterpart cells, MRC-5VA, were a kind gift from Dr. Peter Karran. These two cell cultures were routinely maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (Life Technologies Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. HepG2 human hepatoma cells were obtained from ATCC and were maintained in Eagle's minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin. Cell cultures were grown in 6-well Falcon tissue culture plates. The day before transfection, MRC-5VA cells were plated at 2–4 × 105cells/well and HepG2 cells were plated at 4–5 × 105cells/well. Transient transfections were performed with Superfect transfection reagent for 6 h according to the specifications of the manufacturer (Qiagen). The transfected cells were harvested 2 days later. CMV-β-galactosidase control vector DNA (0.5 μg/plate) was cotransfected to control for transfection efficiency. β-Galactosidase activity in cell extracts was measured using 2-nitrophenyl-β-d-galactopyranoside (ONPG, Aldrich Chemical Co., Milwaukee, WI) as a colorimetric substrate. Twenty-microliter samples of cell extracts were added to 1.5-ml microtubes containing 66 μl of ONPG solution (4 mg/ml, dissolved in 100 mm sodium phosphate, pH 7.5) and incubated at 37 °C for half an hour. Conversion of ONPG to galactose ando-nitrophenyl was then determined spectrophotometrically atA420 nm. Luciferase activities were determined using the Luciferase assay system (Promega) and were normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity. Reproducibility was ensured by transfection in triplicate. Chloramphenicol acetyltransferase activities were measured by the conversion of [14C]chloramphenicol into acetyl- and diacetylchloramphenicol. Twenty microliters of cell extract was incubated with 1 μg/μl butyryl-CoA (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) and 200,000 cpm [1,2-14C]chloramphenicol (ICN, Costa Mesa, CA) at 37 °C for 2–20 h. CAT activities were normalized relative to β-galactosidase activity. Reproducibility was ensured by transfection in triplicate. Total cellular RNA was isolated from cell cultures by TRIzol reagent following the manufacturers' instructions (Life Technologies, Inc.) and was quantified by spectrophotometry. Ten micrograms of total RNA were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred, and fixed onto a nylon membrane (DuPont, Boston, MA). The membranes were then incubated in prehybridization solution (50% formamide, 10 × Denhardt's solution, 10% dextran sulfate, and salmon sperm DNA 200 μg/ml) for 6 h at 42 °C. Radiolabeled human Mn-SOD orerbB-3 probes were prepared by random-primed labeling (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) in the presence of [α-32P]dCTP. The probes were subsequently added to the membrane in the prehybridization solution, and then the blots were hybridized for 16–24 h at 42 °C. Following hybridization, the membranes were washed in 2× SSC (1× SCC is composed of 0.15 m sodium chloride, 0.15 m sodium citrate, pH 7.0), 0.5% SDS twice for 15 min each at room temperature and then washed in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS solution twice for 15 min each at 68 °C. The membranes were wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) at −80 °C for 2–48 h. The membranes were then stripped and reprobed with a [32P]dCTP-labeled cDNA fragment specific for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as a control for RNA loading and transfer. Twenty-five micrograms of nuclear extract (described below) or total cellular proteins isolated from cells were loaded per well and subsequently separated on 12.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose. The membranes were then immunoblotted with antibodies specific for AP-2α, AP-2β, or AP-2γ (Santa Cruz) or Mn-SOD at final dilutions of 1:1000, followed by horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies at 1:10,000 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Detection was performed with ECL reagent (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A double-stranded oligonucleotide (upper strand, 5′-AGCTCAAGCCCGCGGGCTC-3′; lower strand, 5′-TCGAAGAGCCCGCGGGCTTG-3′) was end-labeled with [32P]dCTP by a Klenow fill-in reaction and was used as probe in gel mobility shift assays. This probe contained a consensus AP-2 binding site in the context of the human superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2) promoter from nucleotides −26 to −14 relative to the major transcription start site. The core binding site is identical to the human MtIIa AP-2 site. Nuclear proteins were extracted from the cells as follows. Cells were scraped into 0.5 ml of cold buffer A (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 10 mm KCl; and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol), lysed with 20 strokes of a Dounce homogenizer (Kontes Scientific Glassware, Vineland, NJ), and centrifuged for 30 s. After centrifugation, the supernatants were removed, and the pellets were resuspended in buffer C (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 25% glycerol; 0.42 mNaCl; 1.5 mm MgCl2; 0.2 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). These mixtures were placed on ice for 15 min and microcentrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C. Then the supernatants were harvested and diluted 1:6 with buffer D (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9; 20% glycerol; 0.1 m KCl; 0.2 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; and 0.5 mm dithiothreitol). The protein concentrations of the extracts were determined with BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce Biochemical). Gel mobility shift assays were performed by incubating 5 μg of nuclear protein or 10 μg of total cellular protein together with the32P-radiolabeled oligonucleotide probe in the presence of 1 μg of poly(dI·dC) (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) and 1× gel shift buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.5; 50 mm NaCl; 1 mm MgCl2; 0.5 mm EDTA; 0.5 mm dithiothreitol; and 4% glycerol) at room temperature for 15 min. The binding reactions were loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide gel and run at 35 mA for about 40 min in 1× TBE (90 mm Tris, 90 mm boric acid, 2 mm EDTA, pH 8.0). The gels were wrapped in plastic wrap and exposed to x-ray film (Kodak) overnight at −80 °C. To assess the specificity of the binding reaction, antibodies specific to AP-2 were used in gel supershift assays to verify that the DNA binding activity measured was due specifically to AP-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). For gel supershifts, 1 μl of anti-AP-2 antibody was incubated with each binding reaction for 30 min before loading onto the gel. Data were evaluated using Systat 9.0 for windows. All means were calculated from three separate experiments, and error bars represent standard derivations (S.D.). Analysis of variance-Tukey was used to determine the significance of differences atp < 0.05. The levels of constitutive Mn-SOD mRNA and protein expression in normal human lung fibroblast MRC-5 and its SV-40-transformed counterpart MRC-5VA were compared by northern and Western blot analyses (Fig. 1). Both the 4- and 1-kb Mn-SOD mRNA transcripts were abundant in MRC-5 cells. In contrast, the steady-state levels of both the 4- and 1-kb Mn-SOD mRNA transcripts were significantly decreased in MRC-5VA cells. We also performed a Mn-SOD Western blot in MRC-5 and MRC-5VA cells. The steady-state levels of Mn-SOD protein in MRC-5VA cells were also lower than in MRC-5 cells, consistent with the results of the Northern blot. To determine whether AP-2 proteins were differentially expressed in the normal and SV40-transformed cell counterparts, we performed Western blots using specific antibodies to each AP-2 family member. The results from this experiment, shown in Fig.2, demonstrated that AP-2 family members AP-2α and AP-2γ were constitutively expressed in MRC-5VA cells but not in MRC-5 cells. AP-2β was not detectable in either cell line (data not shown). These results indicated that Mn-SOD gene expression was inversely correlated with AP-2 expression in MRC-5 and MRC-5VA cells. To elucidate the cause for the reduced expression of human Mn-SOD in MRC-5VA cells, we studied the 5′-flanking region of the human SOD2 gene, which expresses Mn-SOD. TheSOD2 promoter is composed of a GC-rich region that contains multiple AP-2 binding sites previously identified by DNA footprinting (29Yeh C. Wan S.X. St. Clair D.K. DNA Cell Biol. 1998; 17: 921-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). To examine whether the AP-2 proteins in MRC-5VA cells could bind to at least one of these putative regulatory sites, gel mobility shift assays were performed using 32P-labeled oligonucleotides 5′-AGCTCAAGCCCGCGGGCTC-3′, derived from SOD2promoter at position −26 to −14 relative to the major transcription start site. AP-2 DNA binding activity was abundant in the nuclear extract from MRC-5VA cells (Fig. 3,lane 2). Furthermore, AP-2 binding activity was positively identified by gel supershift analysis with antibodies specific to each AP-2 family member (Fig. 3, lanes 3–5). Although antibodies against AP-2α and AP-2γ gave robust supershifts, antibody against AP-2β did not provide convincing evidence that AP-2β is part of the DNA binding complex. This result is consistent with the absence of AP-2β protein in the MRC-5VA cells as determined by Western blotting described above. Finally, whereas AP-2 DNA binding activity was constitutively high in MRC-5VA cells, AP-2 DNA binding activity was absent in normal human lung fibroblasts MRC-5 cells that express abundant levels of Mn-SOD (27Huang Y. Domann F.E. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1999; 364: 241-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Because AP-2 and Mn-SOD expression were inversely associated in MRC-5 and MRC-5VA cells, we hypothesized that AP-2 was acting as a transcriptional repressor on the Mn-SOD promoter. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether expression of AP-2 proteins could suppress Mn-SOD promoter activity in the AP-2-deficient HepG2 cell line. We first performed Western blots to determine whether the human AP-2α, AP-2β, and AP-2γ expression plasmids could express their respective AP-2 proteins in HepG2 cells. 2 μg of each expression vector or their empty parent vectors were transfected into cells seeded on a 6-well plate. Western blot analyses were performed, and abundant AP-2 protein was detected in AP-2 expression vector-transfected cells but not in untransfected or empty vector-transfected cells (Fig. 4). The human AP-2 expression plasmids were each then cotransfected with humanSOD2 promoter-reporter construct −555 Mn-SOD-pGL3 (Fig.5 A). The −555 Mn-SOD-pGL3 had a high basal promoter activity in HepG2 cells that was diminished in a dose-dependent manner by cotransfection with each of the AP-2 expression plasmids (Fig. 5, B–D), although AP-2β was slightly less effective in repressing the Mn-SOD promoter compared with AP-2α and AP-2γ. In contrast, AP-2 family members had no effect on the luciferase activity in cells transfected with control vector pGL3-Basic (data not shown). These results are unlikely to be attributable to differences in transfection efficiency, because the luciferase activity was normalized by cotransfection of a β-galactosidase control vector. We conclude therefore that, although all three AP-2 family members can act as transcriptional repressors, AP-2α and AP-2γ appear to play the more functionally important role at the Mn-SOD promoter.Figure 5Repression of Mn-SOD promoter activity by a family of AP-2 proteins in HepG2 cells. A, schematic diagram of the −555 Mn-SOD-pGL3 construct. The putative AP-2 binding sites are indicated by the shaded ovals. B–D, human hepatoma HepG2 cells were transiently transfected with the −555 Mn-SOD-pGL3 construct (1 μg) and varying amounts of AP-2α (B), AP-2β (C), and AP-2γ (D) expression plasmid as indicated on each x axis. The differences in AP-2 DNA amounts were compensated with empty vector for each expression construct so that the total amount of transfected DNA was equal in each case. Results shown are the means and standard deviations from three independent transfection experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine whether the observed repression was specific to the Mn-SOD promoter or a general effect of AP-2 in this system, we studied the effect of AP-2 on erbB-3 gene expression and promoter activity. In contrast to the results obtained for Mn-SOD,erbB-3 mRNA expression was positively associated with AP-2 proteins in MRC-5 and MRC-5VA cells (Fig.6 A). Thus we hypothesized that AP-2 was acting as a transcriptional activator on the erbB-3 promoter. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether expression of AP-2 proteins could transactivate the erbB-3 promoter in the AP-2-deficient HepG2 cell line. We cotransfected the humanerbB-3 promoter reporter construct, erbB-3-pGL3, with each of the AP-2 expression plasmids into HepG2 cells. The results from this experiment, shown in Fig. 6 B, indicated that AP-2α, AP-2β, or AP-2γ alone could transactivateerbB-3 promoter. However, AP-2α and AP-2γ were more active in this regard than AP-2β. These results indicated that AP-2 was capable of transactivating a different AP-2-responsive gene in this model system and suggested that AP-2-mediated repression was specific to the Mn-SOD promoter. Taken together, these results further suggest that the transactivating and transrepressing functions of AP-2 are distinct, and may be related to the specific promoter context in which the AP-2·DNA interaction occurs. To determine which functional domains of the AP-2 protein were responsible for repression of Mn-SOD promoter activity, we used two AP-2α variants. One is AP-2B, which is a naturally occurring alternatively spliced product from the AP-2α gene (33Buettner R. Kannan P. Imhof A. Bauer R. Sun Y.O. Glockshuber R. Van Dyke M.W. Tainsky M.A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 4174-4185Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). AP-2B contains the activation domain of AP-2α and part of the DNA binding domain but lacks the dimerization domain that is necessary for DNA binding. The other is an engineered AP-2α mutant, AP-2Δ (residues 31–117), resulting from excision of a PvuII fragment including most of exon 2 and the entire transactivation domain of AP-2α. AP-2Δ lacks the activation domain of AP-2α but retains the dimerization and DNA binding domains. To characterize the dominant negative nature of these AP-2 isoforms, we transiently transfected a synthetic chimeric AP-2-responsive promoter reporter construct, 12X AP-2-tk-CAT, which contains 12 AP-2 consensus sequences and is purely AP-2-responsive (Fig. 7 A), together with 0.5 μg of AP-2 expression plasmid and an equal amount of either AP-2B or AP-2Δ expression vector into HepG2 cells. These two AP-2α variants, despite their own inability to transactivate the 12X AP-2-responsive reporter, both could specifically interfere with the transactivating activities of each AP-2 family member in a dominant-negative manner (Fig. 7 B). To determine the effects of these AP-2 dominant negative mutants on transactivation of the Mn-SOD promoter, we cotransfected AP-2B or AP-2Δ expression vector with −555 Mn-SOD-pGL3 into HepG2 cells. The results of this experiment, shown in Fig.8 A, indicated that expression of AP-2Δ alone significantly repressed Mn-SOD promoter activity, but AP-2B alone had little effect. To determine the DNA binding ability of the different AP-2 proteins transfected in the HepG2 cells, gel shift assays were performed after transfection of"

The emergence of resistance to the treatment is often related to the increased levels of TS in cancer cells, which have been linked to the elimination of TS binding to its own mRNA upon drug binding, a feedback regulatory mechanism, and/or to the increased stability to intracellular degradation of TS·drug complexes (versus unliganded TS). The active site loop of human TS (hTS) has a unique conformation resulted from a rotation by 180° relative to its orientation in bacterial TSs. In this conformation, the enzyme must be inactive, because the catalytic cysteine is no longer positioned in the ligand-binding pocket. The ordered solvent structure obtained from high resolution crystallographic data (2.0 Å) suggests that the inactive loop conformation promotes mRNA binding and intracellular degradation of the enzyme. This hypothesis is supported by fluorescence studies, which indicate that in solution both active and inactive forms of hTS are present. The binding of phosphate ion shifts the equilibrium toward the inactive conformation; subsequent dUMP binding reverses the equilibrium toward the active form. Thus, TS inhibition via stabilization of the inactive conformation should lead to less resistance than is observed with presently used drugs, which are analogs of its substrates, dUMP and CH2H4folate, and bind in the active site, promoting the active conformation. The presence of an extension at the N terminus of native hTS has no significant effect on kinetic properties or crystal structure.

Thymidylate synthase (TS)1 catalyzes the reductive methylation of 2′-deoxyuridine 5′-monophosphate (dUMP) to thymidine 5′-monophosphate (dTMP), using the co-substrate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (CH2H4folate) as a 1-carbon donor and reductant. The physical structures of bacterial TSs have been relatively well defined, and crystallographic data, in concert with data derived from kinetic, spectroscopic, and site-directed mutagenesis studies, have led to a detailed understanding of the catalytic mechanism of these enzymes (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). In contrast, relatively few investigations of mammalian TS structure and catalysis have been conducted. The three-dimensional structure of the native human TS (hTS) has been reported previously (2Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The data showed a surprising feature not observed in TSs from other sources: loop 181–197 containing the catalytic cysteine, Cys-195, was in an inactive conformation, rotated ∼180° with respect to its orientation in bacterial TSs, with the sulfhydryl of Cys-195 over 10 Å from the location of sulfhydryls of corresponding cysteine residues in bacterial enzymes. Subsequent determination of the structure of a ternary inhibitory complex between closely related ratTS (rTS) and dUMP and Tomudex (3Sotelo-Mundo R.R. Ciesla J. Dzik J.M. Rode W. Maley F. Maley G.F. Hardy L.W. Montfort W.R. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 1087-1094Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) has shown that the ligands bind to the enzyme in the active conformation. Recently, it was found that also in the hTS·dUMP·Tomudex complex hTS is in the active conformation (4Phan J. Koli S. Minor W. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Lebioda L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). The inactive conformation has not been observed in TSs other than human. TS has been a primary target for chemotherapy aimed at cancers of the gastrointestinal tract and head and neck (5Rustum Y.M. Harstrick A. Cao S. Vanhoefer U. Yin M.B. Wilke H. Seeber S. J. Clin. Oncol. 1997; 15: 389-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (193) Google Scholar) despite moderate response in 30–40% of patients. A major problem affecting TS-directed treatments is that tumor cells often react to an exposure to TS inhibitors by raising levels of intracellular TS activity about 2- to 4-fold, which may lead to resistance. The levels of TS mRNA do not change significantly; the increase is predominantly at the protein level. Two effects have been found that can explain the observed increased TS levels. TS was observed to bind to its own mRNA, which is proposed to act as a feedback inhibition mechanism regulating TS levels (6Chu E. Koeller D.M. Casey J.L. Drake J.C. Chabner B.A. Elwood P.C. Zinn S. Allegra C.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 8977-8981Crossref PubMed Scopus (332) Google Scholar). When TS is bound by its physiological substrates, dUMP and/or CH2H4folate, or inhibitors, FdUMP or antifolates, it is unable to interact with its own mRNA. The end-result of this disruption in RNA binding is relief of translational repression with resultant synthesis of new TS. Other researchers (7Kitchens M.E. Forsthoefel A.M. Rafique Z. Spencer H.T. Berger F.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 12544-12547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), using different cell lines, did not observe changes in the extent of ribosome binding to TS mRNA in the presence of TS inhibitors but have shown in an elegant way that ligand-mediated induction of TS occurs by lowering protein turnover. The primary structure of hTS differs from that of bacterial TSs in three regions: the N terminus of hTS is extended (by 29 residues with respect to the most studied Escherichia coli TS, ecTS) and two insertions of 12 and 8 residues are present at positions 117 and 146, respectively, in the human protein (1Carreras C.W. Santi D.V. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1995; 64: 721-762Crossref PubMed Scopus (666) Google Scholar). Recent studies of hTS isolated from bacteria as a recombinant protein and TS isolated from human cells suggested that catalytic and some RNA binding activities of these enzymes are dependent upon the N terminus (8Pedersen-Lane J. Maley G.F. Chu E. Maley F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 10: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The sole difference between the proteins was the presence of a blocked N terminus, probably acetylation, in the enzyme isolated from human cells. In addition, a recombinant hTS in which the N terminus was blocked with a polyhistidine peptide exhibited catalytic and RNA binding activity similar to that of the native, blocked protein (8Pedersen-Lane J. Maley G.F. Chu E. Maley F. Protein Expr. Purif. 1997; 10: 256-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). These data suggested that the N terminus influences enzyme function. Interestingly, the recombinant human enzyme that was utilized as the source for the originally studied crystals was heterogeneous; ∼80% of the protein was a fusion protein containing an additional 13 amino acids at the N terminus (see Fig. 1) that are not present in human TSs (2Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). The original structure determination of the native hTS was at medium (3.0 Å) resolution, and the solvent structure could not have been analyzed. We report here the first determination of high resolution, 2.0 Å, structures of recombinant unblocked hTS and NTE-hTS, both with well-defined solvent structures, and kinetic and ligand binding studies for NTE-hTS. Analysis of the solvent structure suggested that phosphate ions stabilize the inactive conformation. We have conducted fluorescence studies that support this hypothesis. Nucleotides, salts, isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside, 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, ethanediol, polyethylene glycols (PEGs), and folic acid were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Ultra-pure ammonium sulfate was from ICN Biomedicals, Inc. (Aurora, OH). Restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were from New England BioLabs (Beverly, MA). (6S)-5,6,7,8-Tetrahydrofolic acid (H4folate) was prepared from folic acid and converted to (6R)-CH2H4folate as described previously (9Dunlap R.B. Harding N.G.L. Huennekens F.M. Biochemistry. 1971; 10: 88-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Recombinant hTS was expressed and purified as described previously (10Steadman D.J. Zhao P.-S. Spencer H.T. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The plasmid pCD1 used to express N-terminally extended hTS (NTE-hTS) with an additional 42 amino acids at the N terminus (Fig.1) was created by subcloning the humanthyA gene from the plasmid pDHTS-1 (11Davisson V.J. Sirawaraporn W. Santi D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 9145-9148Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) into the expression vector pProEX-1 (Life Technologies, Inc., Gaithersburg, MD). The bacterial strain X2913, which has a deletion of the Escherichia coli thyA gene, was transformed with plasmid pCD1 using the CaCl2/heat shock method (12Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Transformants were grown in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. AtA600 of 1.0, isopropyl β-d-thiogalactopyranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.6 mm. The culture was incubated for 4 h, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1000 ×g at 4 °C, and frozen at −70 °C. Cell pellets (2–3 g) were thawed on ice and suspended in buffer X (20 mmTris, 100 mm KCl, 20 mm imidazole, and 14 mm 2-ME at pH 8.5 and 4 °C) containing 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed at 4 °C by sonication using a Branson Sonifier 450 (Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 18,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min. NTE-hTS was purified from the cell-free extract at 4 °C using a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA). The cell extract was loaded onto the column and washed with buffer X. The column was then washed with buffer Y (20 mm Tris, 1 mKCl, and 14 mm 2-ME, pH 8.5) and NTE-hTS was eluted with buffer Z (20 mm Tris, 100 mm KCl, 100 mm imidazole, and 14 mm 2-ME, pH 8.5). Fractions containing NTE-hTS were pooled and dialyzed overnight against buffer A (10Steadman D.J. Zhao P.-S. Spencer H.T. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Purified NTE-hTS was analyzed by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis for purity and stored in buffer A containing 15% glycerol at −20 °C. Enzyme activity was measured spectrophotometrically by monitoring the absorbance change accompanying the conversion of CH2H4folate to H2folate (13Wahba A.J. Friedkin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: PC11-PC12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using either a Shimadzu UV 1601 spectrophotometer equipped with a TCC 240A temperature-controlled cell holder or a Shimadzu UV 2101 PC spectrophotometer (Shimadzu Corp., Columbia, MD). Measurements were carried out at 25 °C and pH 7.4 in Morrison buffer (14Ellis K.J. Morrison J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1982; 87: 405-426Crossref PubMed Scopus (652) Google Scholar). One unit of enzyme activity is defined as the amount of enzyme required to synthesize 1 μmol of dTMP per minute. Enzyme concentration was determined by measurement of absorbance at 280 nm, as described previously (15Zapf J.W. Weir M.S. Emerick V. Villafranca J.E. Dunlap R.B. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9274-9281Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Kinetic data describing the binding of ligands with hTS were obtained using a stopped-flow fluorimeter/spectrometer (Hi-Tech SX.18MV, Applied Photophysics, UK) as described previously (10Steadman D.J. Zhao P.-S. Spencer H.T. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 16Steadman D.J. Spencer H.T. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5582-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Kinetic and thermodynamic constants for nucleotide binding to NTE-hTS were determined by titrating the enzyme with various concentrations of dUMP, FdUMP, or dTMP. Data were collected over 20-ms or 50-ms time periods. Final concentrations of dUMP, FdUMP, and dTMP were 5–200, 10–250, and 5–250 μm, respectively. Transient-state kinetic constants for CH2H4folate binding to the binary complex of NTE-hTS and dUMP were measured by titration of the binary complex with various concentrations of CH2H4folate. Data were collected over a 1-s time period. The concentration range of CH2H4folate was 5–250 μm. The final concentration of dUMP was 0.50 mm. Crystals of unblocked hTS and NTE-hTS were grown by the vapor diffusion method in the hanging-drop setup at conditions similar to those reported previously (2Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar). Typically, 5 μl of enzyme solution (18 mg/ml) containing 1 mm EDTA, 10 mm 2-ME, 0.1–1m potassium chloride, 100 mm imidazole (NTE-hTS), 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5–8.5) was mixed with an equal volume of precipitant solution containing 38–50% saturated ammonium sulfate, 40 mm potassium phosphate, 20 mm 2-ME, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and allowed to equilibrate with 0.6 ml of precipitant solution present in the well. The culture plates were stored undisturbed at room temperature, and crystals appeared after 3 weeks and grew to the size of 0.1–0.7 mm within 1 week. Data were collected on a single crystal of wild type hTS and NTE-hTS with approximate dimensions of 0.45 × 0.50 × 0.50 and 0.15 × 0.15 × 0.15 mm, respectively. The crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant solution containing 45% saturated ammonium sulfate, 30% concentrated ethylene glycol, and 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), and flash-cooled in N2 vapors at −178 °C. Crystallographic diffraction experiments were carried out at the SBC insertion device beamline of the advanced photon source at Argonne National Laboratory using x-rays of 0.9793-Å wavelength. The data for unblocked hTS and NTE-hTS were collected at a crystal to detector distance of 225 and 180 mm, respectively, and processed with the HKL 2000 suit of programs (17Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 276: 307-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (38617) Google Scholar). At the initial stage of our analysis the coordinates of hTS were not available; therefore, a structure of ecTS (Protein Data Bank code 1qqq (18Phan J. Mahdavian E. Minor W. Berger S. Spencer H.T. Dunlap R.B. Lebioda L. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 6969-6978Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar)) with appropriate modifications was used as the search model in the molecular replacement method carried out with the CNS software (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar). The final structure of unblocked hTS replaced ecTS as the initial model for NTE-hTS. The data were refined and optimized with the CNS software (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. Delano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.-S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16979) Google Scholar) using simulated annealing with torsional dynamics and positional and temperature refinements. Electron density maps calculated with 2Fo −Fc, and Fo −Fc coefficients were utilized to introduce manual corrections to the model with the interactive graphics program CHAIN (20Sack J.S. Quiocho F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 158-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). Ribbon diagrams and wire-and-basket models were prepared with the programs MOLSCRIPT (21Kraulis P.J. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1991; 24: 946-950Crossref Google Scholar) and CHAIN (20Sack J.S. Quiocho F.A. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 277: 158-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar), respectively. Evidence for the existence of the inactive loop conformation in solution was obtained utilizing a spectrofluorometer (Model 8100, SLM-Aminco Inc., Urbana, IL). The excitation wavelength was set at 295 nm, and the emission was scanned from 305 to 450 nm at a rate of 5 nm/s. An Ultra-Vu polystyrene cuvette (Baxter Diagnostics Inc., Deerfield, IL) was used to hold a 3-ml sample containing 4 μm protein in 50 mm Tris-base (pH 7.4). The purity of the protein (recombinant wild type TS) was better than 95%. The titration was carried out by addition of potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) or dUMP in increments up to 10% of the sample volume. No fluorescence signal was observed from the buffer (Tris-HCl), phosphate, or dUMP in the experiments. All measurements were done in triplicate to eliminate errors introduced by non-homogeneity of the sample and instrumental drift. The specific activities, determined at 25 °C, for NTE-hTS and hTS were 1.1 and 1.2 units/mg, respectively, whereas catalytic rates (kcat) were 1.5 and 1.6 s−1. These values were very similar to previously published values of 1.2 units/mg for the specific activity and 1.5 s−1 forkcat of hTS at 25 °C (10Steadman D.J. Zhao P.-S. Spencer H.T. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 7089-7095Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 22Reilly R.T. Barbour K.W. Dunlap R.B. Berger F.G. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 72-79PubMed Google Scholar). The time courses of fluorescence quenching upon nucleotide binding were analyzed using single-exponential curve fits (23Spencer H.T. Villafranca J.E. Appleman J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Kinetic and thermodynamic constants for nucleotide binding were determined as previously described (16Steadman D.J. Spencer H.T. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 5582-5587Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 23Spencer H.T. Villafranca J.E. Appleman J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). A linear relationship was observed between kobs and nucleotide concentration. The kinetic and thermodynamic constants for nucleotide binding to NTE-hTS are listed in Table I. The kinetic and thermodynamic constants describing nucleotide binding to NTE-hTS are nearly identical to those determined for hTS by transient-state kinetic analysis (16Steadman D.J. Spencer H.T.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence quenching due to CH2H4folate binding to the binary complex of NTE-hTS·dUMP was analyzed using a single-exponential curve with a steady-state parameter to account for product formation as previously described (23Spencer H.T. Villafranca J.E. Appleman J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). Mixing NTE-hTS with substrates resulted in a fluorescence burst (kburst) at 340 nm. The dependence of kburst on CH2H4folate concentration was hyperbolic as previously observed for hTS (13Wahba A.J. Friedkin M. J. Biol. Chem. 1961; 236: PC11-PC12Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and the kinetic and thermodynamic constants for CH2H4folate binding to NTE-hTS·dUMP were determined using the expression:kburst =kiso[L]/(L +Kd) + kr, iso +kchem (23Spencer H.T. Villafranca J.E. Appleman J.R. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 4212-4222Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The kinetic and thermodynamic constants determined for NTE-hTS are shown in TableII and are similar to those determined for hTS by transient-state kinetic analysis (16Steadman D.J. Spencer H.T.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) and in the present report exclusively support the growth of hTS crystals in which the active-site loop adopts the inactive conformation. We have investigated other crystallization conditions, especially those with low ionic strength, and obtained several systems that were able to grow hTS crystals. A semi-factorial approach was employed to screen a wide variety of conditions arranged into matrices containing polyethylene glycols, different buffers, and a multitude of salts at varying concentrations (data not shown). At 38% (weight/volume) PEG 4000, 100 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 20 mm 2-ME, and 2% saturated ammonium sulfate, thin and irregularly shaped crystals were observed after 3 weeks measuring ∼0.1 × 0.2 × 0.2 mm. Despite their fair size, these crystals did not scatter x-rays at all. However, we succeeded in growing trigonal crystals, similar to those reported here and by Schiffer et al. (2Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J. Santi D.V. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) with the PEG/ammonium sulfate biphasic system (24Phan J. Ross J.A. Jakob C.G. Lebioda L. Curr. Top. Crystal Growth Res. 1997; 3: 223-228Google Scholar). The optimum conditions were at 15–30% (weight/volume) PEG 4000, 42–50% saturated ammonium sulfate, and 100 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.5). The results were similar for hTS and NTE-hTS. Despite the extra 42 residues at the N terminus, the crystals of hTS and NTE-hTS are isomorphous and isomorphous to those reported by Schiffer et al. (2Schiffer C.A. Clifton I.J. Davisson V.J.

Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 16279-16287Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar) was, in general, excellent; however, stretches of additional residues were fit and some side chains were rebuilt to fit to the more resolved density. The hTS data, which were refined first, having a mosaicity of 0.22 and an overallRmerge of 0.033, yielded excellent electron density maps. The structural differences between hTS and NTE-hTS in unliganded form appear to be insignificant and limited to occasional shifts in the solvent structure. The root-mean-square deviations of the positions of Ca between hTS and NTE-hTS, was 0.16 Å. A significantly smaller number of structured water molecules observed in the NTE-hTS structure is likely to be related to the smaller crystal used and resulting quality of the data. The discussion below refers to the wild type enzyme but is valid as well for the NTE-hTS. The N terminus is largely disordered; good density starts at Pro-26, and this region does not change between hTS, NTE-hTS, and an inhibitory ternary complex of hTS with dUMP and Tomudex (ZD1694 or raltitrexed) (4Phan J. Koli S. Minor W. Dunlap R.B. Berger S.H. Lebioda L. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 1897-1902Crossref PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar) or analogous rat TS complex (PDB entry 2tsr(3Sotelo-Mundo R.R.

A least-squares superposition of the Cα plots of hTS and the inhibitory complex is shown in Fig.2. Apparently, the extra N-terminal residues of NTE-hTS occupy intermolecular space in multiple positions without affecting crystal packing. The main chain follows closely the fold of ecTS starting from Glu-30, which is equivalent to Met-1 of ecTS. As previously observed in a Lactobacillus casei TS (lcTS) structure (25Fauman E.B.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 1502-1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar), the carboxylate moiety of theN-carbamoylated ecTS occupies the same position as the carboxylate of a glutamic acid (Glu-30 in hTS), apparently forming a structural lock that isolates the rest of the TS molecule from the presence and/or conformational state of the N terminus. Indeed, a glutamic acid at this relative position is conserved in all TSs that contain additional N-terminal sequences with one exception, which contains aspartic acid. In the region preceding the first insert, there is reasonable electron density for residues 99–106, which was not observed previously. Region 107–128, which includes the insert, is disordered in the crystals. This is in contrast to the structures of hTS·dUMP·Tomudex and rTS·dUMP·Tomudex complexes, in which this region has interpretable electron density (3Sotelo-Mundo R.R. Ciesla J. Dzik J.M. Rode W.

Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library for clones that encode proteins that interact with p130 has now led to the identification of the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1α (PP1cα) as a p130-binding protein. The association between p130 and PP1cα was also confirmedin vitro by an overlay assay, a “pull-down” assay, and surface plasmon resonance analysis. The interaction of p130 with PP1cα resulted in inhibition of the catalytic activity of the latter in a p130 concentration-dependent manner. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis of COS-1 cells that stably express p130 and of mouse brain extract with antibodies to p130 and to PP1cα also detected the presence of a complex of p130 and PP1cα. The activity of glycogen phosphorylase, which is negatively regulated by dephosphorylation by PP1cα, was higher in COS-1 cells that stably express p130 than in control COS-1 cells. These results suggest that, in addition to its role in inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and Ca2+ signaling, p130 might also contribute to regulation of protein dephosphorylation through its interaction with PP1cα.

Identification of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLC-δ1 as the site of Ins(1,4,5)P3 binding helped to define the PH domain as an inositol compound binding module (6Hirata M. Kanematsu T.

The Ins(1,4,5)P3-binding protein with a molecular mass of 130 kDa, termed p130, was a previously unidentified molecule (2Kanematsu T. Takeya H. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Yoshida M. Koga T. Iwanaga S.

( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The predicted amino acid sequence of rat p130 shares 38.2% identity with that of rat PLC-δ1; the five identified domains of PLC-δ1 (PH, EF-hand, putative catalytic (X and Y), and C2 domains) are all present in p130. The domain organization of p130 suggests that the protein is likely to possess a fold similar to that of PLC-δ1, a notion that is supported by the results of limited proteolysis with trypsin (8Kanematsu T. Yoshimura K. Hidaka K. Takeuchi H. Katan M. Hirata M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2731-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). However, p130 exhibits some distinct characteristics. It is larger than the PLC-δ isozymes, and it possesses unique regions both at the NH2 terminus, preceding the PH domain, and at the COOH terminus. Moreover, the residues within the catalytic domain of PLC-δ that are critical for enzyme activity (His356and Glu390) are not conserved in p130 (9Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Ikehara Y. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). The PH domain of p130, like that of PLC-δ1, is important for the binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 (10Takeuchi H. Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Yaakob H.B. Yagisawa H. Ikehara Y. Watanabe Y. Tan Z. Shears S.B. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 1996; 318: 561-568Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Other molecules that show sequence similarity to p130, including human PLC-L (11Kohno T. Otsuka T. Takano H. Yamamoto T. Hamaguchi M. Terada M. Yokota J. Hum. Mol. Genet. 1995; 4: 667-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) and the K10F12.3 gene product of Caenorhabditis elegans (12Koyanagi M. Ono K. Suga H. Iwabe N. Miyata T. FEBS Lett. 1998; 439: 66-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar), have also been described. Otsuki et al. (13Otsuki M. Fukami K. Kohno T. Yokota J. Takenawa T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 266: 97-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) recently isolated a cDNA from mouse brain that encodes a protein with 66% sequence identity to PLC-L; they therefore termed this protein PLC-L2 and renamed the original PLC-L as PLC-L1. Furthermore, the gene for human type2 p130 (PLC-L2) has also been cloned (14Kikuno R. Nagase T. Ishikawa K. Hirosawa M. Miyajima N. Tanaka A. Kotani H. Nomura N. Obara O. DNA Res. 1999; 6: 197-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (175) Google Scholar). All of these proteins exhibit characteristic NH2- and COOH-terminal extensions and replacement of critical catalytic residues. The identification of a p130-related molecule in such a simple organism as C. elegans suggests that this family of proteins diverged early from other PLC isozymes. We propose that this distinct family of PLC-related proteins be designated the PLC-related catalytically inactive protein (PRIP) family (comprising PRIP-1 and -2 subfamilies). To investigate the physiological functions of PRIP family proteins, we previously examined the possible role of the binding of inositol compounds to the PH domain of p130 (10Takeuchi H. Kanematsu T.

Our results suggested that p130, which is localized predominantly in the cytoplasm, contributes to Ins(1,4,5)P3-mediated Ca2+signaling. The high affinity binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to the PH domain of p130 might also serve to sequester Ins(1,4,5)P3 and therefore prevent its interaction with Ins(1,4,5)P3 receptors and metabolizing enzymes (18Takeuchi H.

We have now applied the yeast two-hybrid system to identify proteins that interact with p130. With the unique NH2-terminal region of p130 as the bait for screening a human brain cDNA library, we isolated two positive clones, one of which was shown to encode the catalytic subunit of protein phosphatase 1α (PP1cα). To characterize the interaction between p130 and PP1cα, we studied the association of these two proteins both in vitro and in living cells, we delineated further the region of p130 that is responsible for binding to PP1cα, and we examined the effect of such binding on the enzymatic activity of PP1cα. Cloning vectors pGBT9 and pACT2, a human brain cDNA library, and yeast strains HF7c and SFY526 were obtained fromCLONTECH (Palo Alto, CA). All restriction endonucleases and DNA-modifying enzymes were from Toyobo (Tokyo, Japan). Dropout yeast selection medium and dropout base medium were from BIO101 (Vista, CA). YPD medium for yeast and bacterial medium were obtained from Becton Dickinson (Sparks, MD). Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). [γ-32P]ATP (222 terabecquere/mmol) was obtained from DuPont-New England Nuclear. A large scale plasmid preparation kit, QIAfilter Plasmid Giga kit, and nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose beads for purification of His6-tagged proteins were from Qiagen (Chatsworth, CA). Protein G-Sepharose, glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads, and pGEX vectors were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Ins(1,4,5)P3 was synthesized as described (19Ozaki S. Watanabe Y. Ogasawara T. Kondo Y. Shiotani N. Nishii H. Matsuki T. Tetrahedron Lett. 1986; 27: 3157-3160Crossref Scopus (93) Google Scholar). The catalytic subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) was obtained fromPromega (Madison, WI), and wild-type rabbit PP1cα was from Calbiochem-Novabiochem (La Jolla, CA). A soluble form of PtdIns(4,5)P2, diC8-PtdIns(4,5)P2, was obtained from Echelon Research Laboratories (Salt Lake City, UT). GM peptide (GRRVSFADNFGFN) and its random sequence (GNFRGFRSADFVN) were synthesized using the Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methoxycarbonyl) cleavage method on an Advanced ChemTech 348MPS peptide synthesizer, and the purity was checked by applying the sample to a μBondashere 5-μ C18 column mounted on a high-performance liquid chromatography column (more than 90%). Other reagents used were of the highest grade available. For construction of p130 bait plasmids, pcMT3 (9Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Ikehara Y. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 1996; 313: 319-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) was digested with XhoI, and the released fragment (nucleotides (nt) 535 to 5233) was cloned into theSalI site of pGBT9. The resulting plasmid, pGBT9-p130Full (p130 plasmid 1; amino acid residues 24 to 1096) (see Fig.1 A), was digested with PstI, rendered blunt-ended with DNA polymerase, and then self-ligated at theSmaI site (nt 1359), thereby generating p130 plasmid 2 (amino acids 24 to 298). In the same manner, pGBT9-p130Full was self-ligated between the KpnI site (nt 1130) or theBamHI site (nt 710) and the PstI site (all sites were blunt-ended) to generate p130 plasmids 3 (amino acids 24 to 222) and 4 (amino acids 24 to 82), respectively. The p130 plasmid 5 (amino acids 222 to 298) was constructed by self-ligation between the blunt-ended XhoI (nt 535) and KpnI (nt 1130) sites of plasmid 2. For construction of pGBT9-p130D (amino acids 848 to 1096), aSpeI site (nt 3011) was introduced into pcMT3 by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting plasmid was digested withSpeI (nt 3011) and XhoI (nt 5233). The released 2.2-kilobase pair fragment was then ligated into theSpeI-SalI sites of pGBT9. For construction of pACT2-PP1cα(Δ29–163) a positive clone obtained from the yeast two-hybrid screening, pACT2-PP1cα, was digested with PvuII (nt 116 and 815) and self-ligated. For expression of recombinant PP1cα in Escherichia coli, the BamHI fragment of pACT2-PP1cα was ligated into the BamHI site of pGEX-3X; the resulting construct encodes a fusion protein of glutathioneS-transferase (GST) and PP1cα. Yeast two-hybrid screening of a human brain cDNA library cloned in the pACT2 vector was performed in yeast strain HF7c with the bait plasmids pGBT9-p130PH or pGBT9-p130D. Transformants (total of 2 × 106) were plated and selected with a combination of tryptophan, leucine, and histidine. The positive clones identified by two-hybrid screening were sequenced with an ABI 373A automated DNA sequencer. The domains required for the interaction between p130 and PP1cα were investigated by expression of various combinations of bait and target plasmids in yeast SFY526 cells and measurement of β-galactosidase activity. The recombinant GST-PP1cα fusion protein was purified from E. coli by affinity chromatography, and recombinant full-length p130 (amino acids 24 to 1096) and the PH domain of p130 (p130PH; amino acids 95 to 232) were prepared as described previously (8Kanematsu T. Yoshimura K. Hidaka K. Takeuchi H. Katan M. Hirata M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2731-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 10Takeuchi H. Kanematsu T. Misumi Y. Yaakob H.B. Yagisawa H.

For “pull-down” assays, GST-PP1cα was incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with glutathione-Sepharose 4B beads in binding buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mmMgCl2, 100 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), 5 mm 2-mercaptoethanol). The beads were washed with 50 volumes of binding buffer and then incubated (6 μg of GST-PP1cα) for 1 h at 4 °C, with gentle rotation, in a total volume of 150 μl with recombinant full-length p130 or p130PH. After washing of the beads five times with 500 μl of binding buffer, bound proteins were eluted with 50 μl of a solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 10 mmreduced glutathione and were then subjected to SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to p130 (2F9) or to p130PH (3Yoshida M.

Katan M. Hirata M. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2731-2737Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). For overlay analysis, samples were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically to a PVDF membrane. After the blocking of nonspecific sites with 5% dried skim milk, the membrane was incubated for 1 h at room temperature with a protein probe (10 μg/ml). The membrane was then washed and incubated with antibodies to the probe protein followed by alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, after which immune complexes were detected by enzymatic reaction. COS-1 cells, COS-1p130cells (COS-1 cells stably expressing p130) (18Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and mouse brain extract were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal antibody to p130 (2F9) or polyclonal antibodies to PP1cα (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA). Cells (5 × 106) or mouse brain (wet weight, 0.2 g) were homogenized in 0.5 ml of a solution containing 20 mmHEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 130 mm NaCl, 5 mm EDTA, and a mixture of protease inhibitors. The homogenate was centrifuged (14,000 × g, 20 min, 4 °C), and the resulting supernatant was incubated, with gentle rotation, for 1 h at 4 °C with 30 μg of antibodies to p130 or to PP1cα that had been premixed with 10 μl of a 50% slurry of protein G-Sepharose in phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA. The beads were then washed twice with a homogenizing solution (described above) containing 0.2% Triton X-100, boiled in SDS sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis with antibodies to PP1cα or to p130. Protein-protein interaction was examined in real time with a BIACORE 2000 surface plasmon resonance analyzer (Biacore International, Uppsala, Sweden). Recombinant GST-PP1cα was immobilized on the surface of a CM5 sensor chip that had been activated withN-hydroxysuccinimide andN-ethyl-N′-(3-diethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide. Recombinant full-length p130 (0.23, 2.3, 23, 230, or 2300 nm) was injected over the chip surface at a rate of 10 μl/min in a solution containing 10 mm HEPES-NaOH (pH 7.4), 0.15 m NaCl, 3.4 mm EDTA, and 0.005% Tween 20. COS-1 or COS-1p130 cells (2 × 106) were lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles in a solution containing 50 mmNaCl, 10 mm MES-NaOH (pH 6.0), 1 mm EDTA, and 10 mm 2-mercaptoethanol. The lysate was subjected to centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 30 min, and the resulting supernatant was assayed for glycogen phosphorylase activity as described (20Cori G.T. Illingworth B. Keller P.J. Methods Enzymol. 1955; 1: 200-205Crossref Scopus (121) Google Scholar). Phosphatase activity was determined in a reaction mixture (40 μl) containing 139.2 mm KCl, 20 mm4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid-KOH (pH 7.0), 0.1 mm MnCl2, 0.5 mm dithiothreitol, BSA (0.5 mg/ml), 2 μm phosphorylated myosin light chain (from bovine stomach), 3.4 nm recombinant rabbit skeletal muscle PP1cα, and various concentrations of recombinant full-length p130 or p130PH, in the absence or presence of 10 μmIns(1,4,5)P3. The mixture minus the substrate was incubated for 10 min at 25 °C, and the reaction was started by the addition of phosphorylated myosin light chain and stopped after 20 min by the addition of 0.2 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid. The unphosphorylated and phosphorylated myosin light chains were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis, and the density of each spot was determined as described (21Sato O. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). Screening of a human brain cDNA library with a bait plasmid (2Kanematsu T. Takeya H. Watanabe Y. Ozaki S. Yoshida M. Koga T. Iwanaga S. Hirata M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6518-6525Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) encoding the unique NH2-terminal region of rat p130 (amino acids 24 to 298), including the PH domain and a portion of the EF-hand motif (Fig. 1 A), yielded 51 positive clones of a total of 2 million clones examined; no positive clones were obtained with a bait plasmid encoding the COOH-terminal region (amino acids 848 to 1096) of p130. 10 of the 51 clones identified proved to be false positives, and the remaining 41 clones were divided into two groups on the basis of analysis of their inserts by polymerase chain reaction amplification and restriction enzyme digestion. Sequencing revealed that one of these 41 clones encoded full-length PP1cα, a 37,510-Da protein composed of 330 amino acids. To delineate more precisely the region of p130 required for binding to PP1cα, we used plasmids encoding smaller portions of p130 as baits in two-hybrid analysis with the plasmid encoding full-length PP1cα (Fig. 1 A). Positive signals were obtained with a bait plasmid (3Yoshida M. Kanematsu T. Watanabe Y. Koga T. Ozaki S. Iwanaga S. Hirata M. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1994; 115: 973-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar) encoding amino acids 24 to 222, as well as with that (1Berridge M.J. Nature. 1993; 361: 315-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (6188) Google Scholar) encoding full-length p130. Neither a bait plasmid (4Hirata M. Sasaguri T. Hamachi T. Hashimoto T. Kukita M. Koga T. Nature. 1985; 317: 723-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar) encoding amino acids 24 to 82 nor one (5Hirata M. Watanabe Y. Ishimatsu T. Yanaga F. Koga T. Ozaki S. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1990; 168: 379-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar) encoding residues 222 to 298 yielded a positive signal (Fig. 1 B). A plasmid encoding a PP1cα mutant lacking amino acids 30 to 162 did not yield a positive signal with any of the p130 bait plasmids examined. These results thus suggested that the region of p130 composed of residues 83 to 222 interacts with that of PP1cα comprising residues 30 to 162. We next examined the interaction of p130 and PP1cα in vitro by several methods. The association was first analyzed with an overlay assay (Fig.2 A). Extracts of nontransformed E. coli and of bacteria expressing a GST-PP1cα fusion protein, as well as recombinant GST-PP1cα purified from such a latter extract, were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, and the separated proteins were transferred to a PVDF membrane and probed with antibodies to PP1cα to confirm that the prominent band that migrated at a position corresponding to a molecular size of 37 kDa was indeed PP1cα. Duplicate membranes were incubated in the presence of a recombinant p130 fragment containing the PH domain (p130PH; amino acids 95 to 232), recombinant full-length p130 (residues 24 to 1096), or BSA (negative control). After washing, the membranes were exposed to the corresponding antibodies to p130PH or to p130. Both the recombinant GST-PP1cα present in the bacterial extract and the purified protein interacted with both full-length p130 and p130PH. Together with the results from the yeast two-hybrid analysis, these data indicate that residues 95 to 222 of p130 (which include the entire PH domain and the 20 residues preceding it) mediate the interaction of this protein with PP1cα. The GST-PP1cα fusion protein was also subjected to a pull-down assay with recombinant p130 or p130PH (Fig. 2 B). Incubation of a GST-PP1cα resin with p130PH and subsequent immunoblot analysis of bead-bound proteins with antibodies to p130PH revealed that p130PH was precipitated by GST-PP1cα and that this interaction was sensitive to the presence of low concentrations of full-length p130 but not to PLC-δ1 (Fig. 2 B, panel a). In contrast, although full-length p130 also bound to GST-PP1cα (but not to GST alone), this interaction was not sensitive to the presence of p130PH (Fig. 2 B, panel b). These results indicate that, although the PH domain of p130 is primarily responsible for the binding of this protein to PP1cα, other regions of p130 also contribute to the interaction between these two proteins. Analysis of the interaction of various regulatory subunits with PP1cα has led to the identification of a consensus sequence for binding, (K/R)(K/R)(V/I)XF (22Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). The sequence VSF (residues 95 to 97) is present in the region of p130 shown to bind to PP1cα. To determine whether this sequence participates in the interaction of p130 with PP1cα, we examined the effect of a peptide (GMpeptide, GRRVSFADNFGFN) that has been shown to inhibit the association between PP1cα and several regulatory subunits (22Egloff M.P. Johnson D.F. Moorhead G. Cohen P.T.W. Cohen P. Barford D. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1876-1887Crossref PubMed Scopus (537) Google Scholar). This peptide inhibited the interaction of PP1cα with either full-length p130 or p130PH, whereas a random peptide with the same amino acid composition had no such effect (Fig. 2 B, panel c). To confirm the role of the VSF sequence of p130 in the interaction of this protein with PP1cα, we expressed in and purified from E. coli p130 fragments comprising amino acids 82 to 232. Whereas the wild-type fragment bound to PP1cα, fragments containing either V95L or F97A mutations bound to the lesser extent (Fig. 2 B, panel d). Given that p130 contains four consensus motifs for phosphorylation by PKA (74Arg Arg Thr Ser77,90Arg Lys Lys Thr93,104Lys Ile Ser107, and567Arg Arg Val Ser570 [underlining refers to phosphorylatable residues] one of which (104Lys Lys Ile Ser 107) is present in p130PH, it was possible that p130 associates with PP1cα because it is a substrate for phosphatase activity of this enzyme. Indeed, p130 was phosphorylated by PKA (Fig. 2 C, lane 2), although the precise site (or sites) phosphorylated remains to be determined. However, this explanation for the interaction between p130 and PP1cα is unlikely, because phosphorylated p130 did not associate with PP1cα, whereas p130 treated with ATP alone (without PKA) bound to PP1cα (Fig. 2 C, lane 1). The association between p130 and PP1cα was further confirmed by surface plasmon resonance analysis. Full-length p130 was introduced into the analysis chamber after immobilization of GST-PP1cα onto the sensor chip. Positive signals indicative of protein-protein interaction were generated in a p130 concentration-dependent manner and were abolished by washing away of the applied p130 (Fig.2 D). The dissociation constant was calculated to be 1.2 ± 0.1 nm (mean ± S.E. of values from five independent determinations). Replacement of the full-length p130 molecule with p130PH yielded a dissociation constant in the micromolar range, consistent with the results obtained with pull-down assays (Fig.2 B, panels a and b). We next investigated whether the activity of PP1cα is affected by the association with p130. The dephosphorylation of phosphorylated smooth muscle myosin light chain (21Sato O. Ogawa Y. J. Biochem. ( Tokyo ). 1999; 126: 787-797Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar) by recombinant rabbit skeletal muscle PP1cα was inhibited by full-length p130 in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.3). Recombinant p130PH also inhibited the activity of PP1cα, although higher concentrations of p130PH than of full-length p130 were required for this effect. The effects of Ins(1,4,5)P3 and water-soluble (short-chain) PtdIns(4,5)P2 on the association of p130 with PP1cα, as well as on the inhibition of PP1cα activity by p130, were also examined, given that the site of p130 responsible for the association with PP1cα was shown to be located immediately upstream of the PH domain and that PH domains mediate binding to Ins(1,4,5)P3or PtdIns(4,5)P2. The presence of Ins(1,4,5)P3or short-chain PtdIns(4,5)P2 at a concentration of 10 μm in the reaction mixture for the pull-down assay had no effect on the interaction of p130 with PP1cα (data not shown), and 10 μm Ins(1,4,5)P3 had no effect on p130-induced inhibition of PP1cα activity (Fig. 3). To determine whether p130 and PP1cα interact in living cells, we first examined COS-1 cells that stably express recombinant p130 (COS-1p130 cells) (18Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Immunoblot analysis of extracts of both control COS-1 cells (which lack endogenous p130) and COS-1p130 cells with antibodies to PP1cα revealed that both cell lines express similar amounts of PP1cα (Fig.4 A, a). Cell extracts were then subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies to either p130 (Fig. 4 A, b) or PP1cα (Fig.4 A, c), and the resulting precipitates were subjected to immunoblot analysis with the same two types of antibodies. Stable association of p130 with PP1cα was apparent in COS-1p130 cells but not in control COS-1 cells (Fig.4 A). We also examined whether these two proteins interact in mouse brain, which contains both molecules (Fig. 4 B). PP1cα was detected in p130 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 B,b), and p130 was detected in PP1cα immunoprecipitates (Fig. 4 B, c) prepared from mouse brain. PP1cα is thought to catalyze protein dephosphorylation reactions that underlie many aspects of cell function (23Barford D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 24Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Glycogen phosphorylase, which catalyzes the conversion of glycogen to glucose 1-phosphate, is a substrate for PP1cα in a wide variety of cell types (25Stryer L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. Freeman, New York1995: 581-602Google Scholar); its dephosphorylation by this phosphatase results in inhibition of phosphorylase activity. Measurement of glycogen phosphorylase activity in extracts of COS-1 and COS-1p130 cells yielded values of 68 ± 6 and 130 ± 9 nmol per milligram of protein per 5 min (means ± S.E. of six independent determinations), respectively. These results thus indicate that glycogen phosphorylase is phosphorylated to a greater extent in COS-1p130 cells than in COS-1 cells. With the use of its specific NH2-terminal region as a bait, we applied the yeast two-hybrid screen to identify human brain proteins that bind to p130, designated henceforth as PRIP-1. This approach identified PP1cα as one such protein. PP1 is a widely expressed serine-threonine protein phosphatase that exists in several isoforms, including α, α2, γ1, γ2, and δ (23Barford D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1996; 21: 407-412Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar, 24Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar). Various regulatory subunits have been shown to associate with PP1cα and thereby to influence its catalytic activity (26Aggen J.B. Nairn A.C. Chamberlin R. Chem. Biol. 2000; 7: 13-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar). For example, GM and GL subunits function to target PP1cα to glycogen granules; phosphorylation of these subunits by PKA induces their dissociation from PP1cα, whereas that triggered by insulin promotes their association with and activation of PP1cα, resulting in inhibition of glycogen breakdown. The association of I-1 (inhibitor 1) or DARPP-32 (dopamine- and cAMP-regulatedphosphoprotein of 32 kDa) with PP1cα appears not to affect phosphatase activity, whereas phosphorylation of I-1 or DARPP-32 by PKA induces marked inhibition of such activity. Our results now suggest that PRIP-1 also functions as a regulatory subunit of PP1cα that inhibits phosphatase activity. The binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 or PtdIns(4,5)P2 to PRIP-1 had no effect on its association with or inhibition of PP1cα. Our previous observations suggested that Ins(1,4,5)P3 may be a physiological ligand for PRIP-1 and that this protein is localized predominantly to the cytosol (18Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). PRIP-1 may therefore serve not only to inhibit the activity of PP1cα but also to target this enzyme to the cytosol. Amino acid residues 95 to 97 of PRIP-1, located upstream of the PH domain, appear to contribute to the binding site for PP1cα. The fragment of PRIP-1 comprising residues 24 to 222 interacted with PP1cα in the yeast two-hybrid assay, and p130PH (PRIP-1PH) (residues 95 to 232) as well as the full-length molecule, associated with PP1cαin vitro, as demonstrated with a variety of binding assays. A GM peptide that disrupts the interaction of PP1cα with several regulatory subunits and that contains the VSF (residues 95 to 97) sequence of PRIP-1 also inhibited the association of PRIP-1 with PP1cα. Furthermore, mutation of residues 95 or 97 of PRIP-1 prevented the association of this protein with PP1cα. Other regions of the PRIP-1 molecule may also interact with PP1cα, as suggested by the observations that the full-length molecule bound to PP1cα was not displaced by an excess amount of PRIP-1PH and that the dissociation constant obtained by surface plasmon resonance analysis for the interaction with PP1cα was smaller for the full-length molecule than for PRIP-1PH. However, the observation that the GM peptide was similarly effective in inhibiting the association of PP1cα with full-length PRIP-1 and with PRIP-1PH suggests rather that other regions of PRIP-1 promote the interaction of the region containing residues 95 to 97 with PP1cα. Phosphorylation of PRIP-1 by PKA resulted in inhibition of the association between PRIP-1 and PP1cα. Although the phosphorylated residues of PRIP-1 that underlie this effect remain to be identified, T93, which is located immediately upstream of the putative binding site for PP1cα, is a likely candidate. PP1cα contributes to the regulation of many aspects of cellular metabolism, including glycogen metabolism (through dephosphorylation of phosphorylase kinase, glycogen phosphorylase, and glycogen synthase) and lipid metabolism (through dephosphorylation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase, hormone-dependent lipase, and hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase). Furthermore, it participates in the regulation of Ca2+ transport (through dephosphorylation of phospholamban and Ca2+ channel proteins), smooth muscle contraction (through dephosphorylation of myosin light chain), DNA replication (through dephosphorylation of histones H2B and H1), and protein synthesis (through dephosphorylation of initiation factor eIF-2, RNA-dependent protein kinase, heat shock protein, S6 protein, and S6 kinase) (24Cohen P.T.W. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1997; 22: 245-251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (462) Google Scholar, 25Stryer L. Stryer L. Biochemistry. 4th Ed. Freeman, New York1995: 581-602Google Scholar). It remains to be determined which of these cellular activities are physiologically regulated by PRIP-1 through its interaction with PP1cα. Our data do suggest, however, that the association between PRIP-1 and PP1cα occurs in living cells, and we have shown that the activity of glycogen phosphorylase, which is regulated exclusively by phosphorylation, was increased in COS-1 cells by the expression of PRIP-1, probably as a result of the interaction of PRIP-1 with, and the consequent inhibition of, PP1cα. Glycogen phosphorylase may therefore be a physiological target for regulation by the interaction of PRIP-1 with PP1cα. In summary, we have shown that (i) p130, which belongs to the PRIP family of proteins and is here renamed PRIP-1, associates with PP1cα through a GM peptide-like region located upstream of the PH domain; (ii) association with PRIP-1 results in inhibition of the catalytic activity of PP1cα as measured in vitro with phosphorylated myosin light chain as substrate; and (iii) glycogen phosphorylase activity was increased by expression of PRIP-1 in intact cells, likely as a result of inhibition of PP1cα and accumulation of the phosphorylated, active form of glycogen phosphorylase. In addition to its role in Ins(1,4,5)P3 and Ca2+ signaling (18Takeuchi H. Oike M. Paterson H.F. Allen V. Kanematsu T. Ito Y. Erneux C. Katan M. Hirata M. Biochem. J. 2000; 349: 357-368Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), PRIP-1 might therefore also contribute to the regulation of protein dephosphorylation. Given that the binding of Ins(1,4,5)P3 to the PH domain of PRIP-1 had no effect on the association of PRIP-1 with PP1cα or on its inhibition of PP1cα activity, PRIP-1 may contribute to both Ca2+ signaling and regulation of protein dephosphorylation simultaneously and, in some instances, cooperatively. We thank M. Katan for helpful comments."

The major receptor is Tom20, which is involved, together with Tom22, in the translocation of most precursors (5Ramage L. Junne T. Hahne K. Lithgow T. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4115-4123Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar, 6Harkness T.A. Nargang F.E. van der Klei I. Neupert W. Lill R. J.

Another receptor that forms a binding site for a more restricted set of preproteins, most notably the mitochondrial carrier family, is Tom70 (8Hines V. Brandt A. Griffiths G. Horstmann H. Brütsch H.

These receptors are loosely attached to the other components of the TOM machinery that form the core complex (10Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell.

The subunits of the core complex (Tom40, Tom22, Tom7, Tom6, and Tom5) are embedded in the outer membrane and form the translocation pore (10Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A.

The yeast Tom6 and Tom7 were suggested to modulate the stability of the association of the Tom components (16Alconada A. Kübrich M. Moczko M. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell.

Tom6 is a small protein that was first identified in yeast as a high copy number suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutant of Tom40 (18Kassenbrock C.K. Cao W. Douglas M.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3023-3034Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). Tom6 was proposed to support the cooperation between the receptors, in particular Tom22, and the general insertion pore (10Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 15van Wilpe S. Ryan M.T. Hill K. Maarse A.C. Meisinger C. Brix J. Dekker P.J. Moczko M. Wagner R. Meijer M. Guiard B.

Biol. 1995; 15: 6196-6205Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The protein contains one putative transmembrane domain close to its C terminus and is oriented with its N terminus in the cytosol. Thus, it belongs to the class of membrane proteins with a C-terminal anchor. It has been suggested that the insertion of the protein into the outer membrane is independent of surface receptors or the function of Tom40 (19Cao W. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5674-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Tom7 in yeast consists of 59 amino acid residues. It's topology in the mitochondrial outer membrane is unknown (17Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). A lack of Tom7 was reported to stabilize the interaction of the receptors Tom20 and Tom22 with the pore element, Tom40. These findings suggested that Tom7 plays a role opposite to that of Tom6 by exerting a destabilizing effect on the association of Tom components (17Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). At present, Tom6 and Tom7 have been investigated only in yeast, though homologues from other organisms have been identified (4Voos W. Martin H. Krimmer T. Pfanner N. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1999; 1422: 235-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar). Information on the molecular environment of Tom6 and Tom7 in the TOM complex would be of special interest for understanding the molecular function of the TOM machinery. As Tom6 is a tail-anchored protein, it can serve as a model protein for the study of membrane insertion and assembly into functional complexes for this group of membrane proteins. Currently, the information on how tail-anchored proteins are targeted to mitochondria and inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane is very limited. In this report we describe the cloning of TOM6 and TOM7 from the fungus Neurospora crassa and an analysis of the processes by which they are inserted into the mitochondrial outer membrane and assembled into the TOM core complex. We also investigated the molecular environment of the two proteins in their assembled state and found them to be in direct contact with Tom40, whereas Tom6 was also found to interact with Tom22 in a manner that depends on the presence of preproteins in transit. The TOM complex was isolated according to Künkele et al. (20Künkele K.-P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), and its protein components were separated by urea-SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (20Künkele K.-P.

The bands corresponding to Tom6 and Tom7 were isolated, and their N-terminal sequences were determined by Edman degradation. For Tom6, 25 amino acid residues were determined, and degenerate primers were synthesized for use in PCR reactions utilizing a cDNA library from N. crassa as the template. By this method a 70-base pair DNA fragment was amplified that encodes 23 of these 25 amino acid residues. A larger PCR product containing most of the coding sequence and the 3′end of the gene was produced from a pool of cloned cDNAs using primers derived from the sequence of the 70-base pair fragment and the T3 promotor region of the cDNA-containing vector. This PCR product was labeled with Digoxigenin (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used to probe both a cDNA library and a cosmid library. One cDNA was completely sequenced and found to encode a protein of 60 amino acid residues. For determination of the genomic sequence a cosmid containing the TOM6 gene was isolated, and the TOM6-containing part was sequenced. For Tom7, 28 residues were determined from the N terminus of the protein. A PCR-based strategy, similar to the one used for Tom6, revealed the entire sequence of both the cDNA and genomic versions of the gene. Isolation of mitochondria and outer membrane vesicles (OMV) from N. crassa was performed as described (21Mayer A. Lill R. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 121: 1233-1243Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar). The fusion protein, pSu9(1–69)-DHFR, was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography from cell extracts of Escherichia coli strain BL21 carrying the pQE60-pSu9(1–69)-DHFR-His6 overexpression vector. Antibodies against N. crassa Tom6 and Tom7 were raised in rabbits by injecting peptides coupled to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (Pierce), which corresponded to the 12 N-terminal amino acid residues. Blotting to polyvinylidene difluoride or nitrocellulose membranes and immunodecoration were according to standard procedures, and visualization was by the ECL method (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For cross-linking experiments, 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) was added to isolated OMV in either the absence or presence of various amounts of pSu9-DHFR. After incubation for 30 min at 25 °C, excess cross-linker was quenched by the addition of glycine, pH 8.0, to 80 mm, and the reactions were kept for 10 min at 25 °C. Aliquots were removed before and after addition of the cross-linking reagent. For co-immunoprecipitation experiments, OMV or mitochondria were dissolved in buffer containing 1% of digitonin, β-dodecylmaltoside, or Triton X-100 for 30 min at 4 °C. The lysed material was centrifuged (15 min at 20,000 × g), and the supernatant was incubated with antibodies coupled to protein A-Sepharose beads. At the end of the binding reaction the protein A-Sepharose beads were washed with detergent-containing buffer, and bound proteins were eluted with sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE. The gels were blotted and immunodecorated with antibodies against the various Tom components. Radiolabeled precursor proteins were synthesized in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of [35S]methionine (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) afterin vitro transcription using SP6 polymerase from pGEM4 vector containing the cDNA of interest. Import reactions were performed by incubation of radiolabeled preproteins with 30–50 μg of mitochondria in import buffer (0.25% (w/v) bovine serum albumin, 250 mm sucrose, 80 mm KCl, 5 mmMgCl2, 2 mm ATP, 10 mm MOPS-KOH, pH 7.2) at specified temperatures. Trypsin pretreatment (200 μg/ml) of mitochondria was performed on 250 μg of mitochondria in 500 μl of import buffer for 15 min on ice. Trypsin activity was blocked by soybean trypsin inhibitor. Proteinase K treatment of samples was performed by incubation with the protease for 15 min on ice followed by inhibition by addition of 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Import was analyzed by SDS-PAGE or blue native gel electrophoresis (BNGE), and the gels were viewed by autoradiography or quantified by phosphorimaging (Fuji BAS 1500). Mitochondria (50 to 100 μg) were lysed in 50 μl of buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, 0.1 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, pH 7.4) containing 1% of digitonin, Triton X-100, or β-dodecylmaltoside. After incubation on ice for 30 min and a clarifying spin (20 min, 22,000 × g, 1.5 cm), 5 μl of sample buffer (5% (w/v) Coomassie Brilliant Blue G-250, 100 mm BisTris, 500 mm 6-aminocaproic acid, pH 7.0) were added for another 5 min on ice, and the mixture was analyzed on a 6–13% gradient blue native gel (22Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). The cathode and anode buffers for performing the electrophoresis were as described (22Schägger H. Cramer W.A. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1994; 217: 220-230Crossref PubMed Scopus (1038) Google Scholar). Electrophoresis was started at 100 V until the samples were within the stacking gel and continued with voltage and current limited to 500 V and 15 mA. At the end of the electrophoresis excess dye was removed, the gel was blotted on a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a semi-dry apparatus, and immunodecoration was as described above. The N-terminal sequences of isolated Tom6 and Tom7 were determined. Degenerate primers were constructed according to the sequences obtained, and the genomic DNAs cloned by a PCR-based procedure (see details under “Experimental Procedures”). Comparison of the amino acid sequence obtained by N-terminal sequencing to that deduced from the cDNA revealed the initiator methionine residue to be removed in Tom6 but not in Tom7. The corresponding genes were sequenced from PCR-amplified genomic DNA and cosmids containing TOM6 and TOM7, respectively. The TOM6 gene contains two introns (GenBankTM accession number AF321882). N. crassa TOM6 encodes a protein of 60 residues and has one predicted transmembrane segment near the C terminus (Fig.1 A). There is little similarity between N. crassa Tom6 and yeast Tom6 in the N-terminal region of the protein. However, the C-terminal regions, including the predicted transmembrane segment, are 44% identical over the last 25 residues (Fig. 1 A). The TOM7 gene is interrupted by three introns (GenBankTM accession number AF321883). It encodes a protein of 53 amino acid residues with a single predicted transmembrane segment (Fig. 1 B). N. crassa Tom7 has 53% identity to yeast Tom7 (Fig. 1 B). Antisera raised against peptides corresponding to the first 12 amino acids of either Tom6 or Tom7 reacted selectively with the corresponding protein and were used to determine the enrichment of the proteins in purified TOM complex as related to mitochondria or OMV (Fig. 2 A). To analyze the association of Tom6 and Tom7 with the TOM complex inN. crassa, BNGE was conducted on OMV solubilized in the mild detergent digitonin. The conditions during BNGE cause the Tom20 and Tom70 receptors of both the yeast and N. crassa TOM complexes to dissociate from the remaining components that constitute the TOM core complex (10Dekker P.J.T.

Both Tom6 and Tom7 comigrate with Tom22 and Tom40 demonstrating their firm association with the core complex (Fig. 2 B). The stability of the interaction was further demonstrated by solubilizing OMV with 1% of either β-dodecylmaltoside or Triton X-100. Yeast Tom6 and Tom7 were reported to dissociate from the TOM core complex after solubilization with Triton X-100 (10Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). In contrast, with N. crassa most of Tom7 and Tom 22 and all of Tom6 and Tom40 migrated as a high molecular mass complex (Fig. 2 B). This latter complex migrates faster than the complex solubilized with digitonin. This difference can be explained by variations in the lipid contents of the various complexes. We have previously reported a much higher phospholipid content in the complex isolated with digitonin as compared with the complex isolated with DDM (24Stan T. Ahting U. Dembowski M. Künkele K.-P. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Rapaport D. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 4895-4902Crossref PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). The interactions between the various components of the N. crassa TOM complex were further investigated by co-immunoprecipitation. OMV were solubilized with either digitonin, a detergent that is known to keep the TOM holo complex intact (20Künkele K.-P. Heins S. Dembowski M. Nargang F.E. Benz R. Thieffry M. Walz J. Lill R. Nussberger S. Neupert W. Cell. 1998; 93: 1009-1019Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar), or DDM, which results in the formation of the TOM core complex (11Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Tom6 and Tom7 were precipitated with antibodies against Tom22 and Tom40 (Fig. 2, C and D). Hence, both Tom6 and Tom7 are in close association with the other components of the TOM core complex. In agreement with previous observations (10Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 11Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar), antibodies against Tom70 precipitated only minor amounts of the other Tom components (Fig.2, C and D), supporting the notion that Tom70 is loosely associated with the other components of the TOM machinery. In contrast to the observation in yeast (10Dekker P.J.T. Ryan M.T. Brix J. Müller H. Hönlinger A. Pfanner N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 6515-6524Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar) antibodies against Tom20 did precipitate with high efficiency the other components of the TOM complex from mitochondria dissolved in digitonin suggesting that each complex contains at least one molecule of Tom20. The observation that not all the Tom20 molecules residing in the outer membrane could be precipitated by antibodies against other components of the TOM complex suggests the existence of a subpopulation of Tom20 molecules that are not, or only loosely, attached to the complex. Antibodies against Tom20 could not, however, precipitate the other Tom components after solubilization of the OMV with β-dodecylmaltoside (Fig.2 D). These conditions are known to result in the formation of the TOM core complex that lacks both receptor proteins, Tom20 and Tom70 (11Ahting U. Thun C. Hegerl R. Typke D. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Nussberger S. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 147: 959-968Crossref PubMed Scopus (170) Google Scholar). Taken together, our data indicate that Tom6 and Tom7 are integral components of the N. crassa TOM core complex. Tom6 was previously found to be in the vicinity of Tom40, and their interaction was modified by the formation of specific translocation intermediates of a precursor protein (25Rapaport D. Künkele K.-P. Dembowski M. Ahting U. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5256-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). To determine whether both Tom6 and Tom7 are only in the vicinity of Tom40 or actually in direct contact with the protein, the cross-linking reagent EDC was added to outer membrane vesicles, and cross-linking products were analyzed by immunodecoration. Specific cross-linking adducts of Tom40 with both Tom6 and Tom7 could be identified (Fig.3 A). As EDC is a zero-spacer cross-linking reagent, it can be concluded that Tom40 is in direct contact with both proteins. In addition, a cross-linking adduct between Tom6 and Tom22 was identified (Fig. 3 B). The formation of this adduct was reduced gradually by adding increasing amounts of the precursor, pSu9(1–69)-DHFR, a chimeric preprotein consisting of the first 69 amino acids of subunit 9 of the mitochondrial F0-ATPase fused to mouse dihydrofolate reductase, before performing the cross-linking reaction. The Tom6-Tom22 adduct was also observed using other cross-linking reagents (not shown). Hence, Tom6 and Tom22 are in a direct contact, and their interaction is dynamically modulated by preproteins in transit. A similar interaction between Tom22 and Tom7 was not observed (not shown). To determine whether in vitro-synthesized precursors of Tom6 and Tom7 can be imported and assembled into authentic TOM complexes we took advantage of the characteristic migration of the endogenous Tom6 and Tom7 on BNGE. Isolated mitochondria were incubated with precursors of Tom components at various temperatures, solubilized with digitonin, and their proteins were analyzed by BNGE. A significant amount of the precursors of Tom6 and Tom7, like those of Tom22 and Tom40, were assembled in a temperature-dependent manner into the endogenous pre-existing TOM core complex (Fig.4 A). This assembly was specific. In a control experiment the imported precursor of porin, another outer membrane protein, did not migrate with the endogenous TOM complex (not shown). The lower molecular weight bands in Fig.4 A are probably insertion intermediates or unproductively bound precursors, as shown previously when these low molecular weight bands were analyzed in detail following import of Tom40 (23Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar). In this experiment typical precursor-product relationships were not observed for all Tom components. A significant portion of the precursor molecules that are absorbed to the surface of the mitochondria during the incubation at 0 °C dissociate from the mitochondria during the wash and centrifugation, which are performed before loading the material on BNGE. Hence, part of the molecules observed after incubation at 25 °C are products of early intermediates that cannot be observed with BNGE. Assembly of precursors of Tom components into the TOM core complex was also observed after solubilization of mitochondria with another detergent, DDM (Fig. 4 B). The assembly of newly synthesized Tom6 and Tom7 was further tested by co-immunoprecipitation. Radiolabeled precursors were incubated with mitochondria, and following the import reactions, mitochondria were solubilized with digitonin and subjected to immunoprecipitation with antibodies against various Tom components. Both precursors were precipitated with antibodies against Tom20, Tom22, and Tom40 (Fig.4 C). Thus, both precursor proteins are imported into the mitochondrial outer membrane and assembled into TOM complexes. The requirements for efficient insertion of Tom6 and Tom7 into the mitochondrial outer membrane were investigated. A previous report suggested that neither import receptors nor Tom40 were required for insertion of Tom6 and that other, unknown, proteins were involved (19Cao W. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5674-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). We studied assembly into the endogenous TOM complex as a criterion for correct insertion and addressed the question of whether Tom6 and Tom7 use the general insertion pore of the TOM complex for insertion. The protein conducting pore was blocked by accumulating chemical amounts of a translocation intermediate of the fusion protein pSu9(1–69)-DHFR in the presence of methotrexate (26Ungermann C. Neupert W. Cyr D.M. Science. 1994; 266: 1250-1253Crossref PubMed Scopus (225) Google Scholar, 27Dekker P.J.T. Martin F. Maarse A.C. Bömer U. Müller H. Guiard B. Meijer M. Rassow J. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 5408-5419Crossref PubMed Scopus (238) Google Scholar). When precursors of Tom6 and Tom7 where imported into these blocked mitochondria a strong reduction in the level of assembly of both was observed (Fig.5 A). Thus, precursors of a matrix-destined protein apparently compete with precursors of Tom6 and Tom7 for sites required for translocation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the reduction in assembly upon blocking the pore results from induction of a conformational change in the complex, which masks a distal Tom6 binding site. Does Tom6 require the receptor components for its proper assembly? Mitochondria were treated with trypsin resulting in the removal of the exposed parts of the surface receptors (Fig. 5 B,inset). The ability of Tom6 precursor to assemble into the TOM complex was reduced by this procedure (Fig. 5 B). This is in contrast to previous reports (17Hönlinger A. Bömer U. Alconada A. Eckerskorn C. Lottspeich F. Dietmeier K. Pfanner N. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2125-2137Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar, 19Cao W. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5674-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) and suggests that the receptor proteins significantly enhance the assembly of Tom6. In summary, our results support the hypothesis that Tom6 and Tom7 follow an import pathway involving the TOM complex. Tom6, like all outer membrane proteins, does not contain a cleavable targeting sequence. To determine which portions of the protein contain information for targeting, insertion, and integration we constructed fusion proteins containing Tom6 variants (Fig.6 A). To improve the detection of the newly synthesized Tom6, we used a fusion protein where a DHFR domain was present at the N terminus of Tom6. A similar fusion construct in yeast was shown to be capable of functionally replacing the native Tom6 protein in vivo (19Cao W. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5674-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Our constructs included a chimeric protein with the complete Tom6 protein (DHFR-Tom6) and two mutant variants lacking either residues 1–12 of Tom6 (DHFR-Tom6Δ12) or residues 1–36 (DHFR-Tom6Δ36). All constructs were targeted to mitochondria and inserted into the outer membrane as shown by their recovery in the membrane pellet following carbonate extraction (not shown). Co-immunoprecipitation and BNGE were employed to investigate the assembly of the variant Tom6 precursors into the endogenous TOM complex. Using BNGE we observed that only the wild type construct and the DHFR-Tom6Δ12 variant were assembled into TOM complexes whereas DHFR-Tom6Δ36 was found to be attached to mitochondria but not assembled (Fig. 6 B). Assembly of DHFR-Tom6Δ36 was further analyzed by coimmunoprecipitation with antibodies against Tom22 and Tom40. Imported native Tom6 was efficiently co-immunoprecipitated, but only minor amounts of DHFR-Tom6Δ36 were precipitated by these two antibodies (Fig.6 C). These minor amounts of precipitated DHFR-Tom6Δ36 may represent translocation intermediates of the precursors that are attached to, but not assembled into, the TOM complex. Only background levels were precipitated by antibodies against Tom22 in a control experiment where OMV were first solubilized with digitonin, and only then was precursor added (not shown). These results indicate that amino acid residues 13–36 in the cytosolic domain of Tom6 contain essential information for either the correct assembly of the protein or for the overall folding of the protein, which then affects assembly. The primary sequence of yeast Tom6 has high similarity to the N. crassa protein in the C-terminal 20 amino acid residues (Fig.1 A). To study further the requirements for specific assembly into the TOM complex, we constructed a hybrid precursor composed of the C-terminal domain of yeast Tom6 fused to the cytosolic domain ofN. crassa Tom6 (Fig.7 A). We then asked whetherin vitro-synthesized yeast Tom6 and the hybrid construct would be assembled into the N. crassa complex. Radiolabeled precursors were imported into mitochondria isolated from N. crassa, and specific assembly was investigated by BNGE. Both yeast Tom6-containing precursors migrated as low molecular weight bands indicating that the precursors were bound to mitochondria but not assembled (Fig. 7 B). When the integration of these precursors into the yeast TOM complex was examined, the opposite integration behavior was observed (Fig. 7 C). Yeast Tom6 was assembled into the yeast complex, but the N. crassa Tom6 and the hybrid precursor were only bound as non-assembled species. The results of importing the precursors into N. crassamitochondria were verified by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig.7 D). Although the precursor of N. crassa Tom6 was efficiently precipitated by antibodies against Tom22 and Tom40, only minor amounts of yeast Tom6 were brought down by these antibodies. Hence, the Tom6 precursor from each organism contains specific information that allows it to assemble only into the TOM complex from the corresponding organism. Furthermore, this information cannot be localized exclusively to the more variable N-terminal, cytosolic domain as the hybrid precursor containing the yeast C terminus also did not assemble into the N. crassa TOM complex. We have cloned Tom6 and Tom7 from N. crassa and investigated their insertion into the mitochondrial outer membrane, integration into the TOM core complex, and their interactions with other Tom components. These two small subunits, like the other components of the TOM complex, have significant sequence similarity to their yeast counterparts. Hence, their function can be predicted to be similar to the yeast homologues. The components of the TOM complex, Tom22, Tom70 and Tom40, use the pre-existing TOM complex for their own insertion (23Rapaport D. Neupert W. J. Cell Biol. 1999; 146: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar, 28Schlossmann J. Neupert W. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 27116-27121Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 29Court D.A. Nargang F.E. Steiner H. Hodges R.S. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1996; 16: 4035-4042Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). In contrast to previous observations (19Cao W. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5674-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), we report that Tom6 also utilizes the TOM complex for insertion. How can this discrepancy be explained? Although the temperature-sensitive tom40-3 allele used in the previous study (19Cao W. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5674-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) does not affect the import of Tom6, other tom40 temperature-sensitive alleles might do so. Indeed, the tom40–3 allele does not affect the import of porin, a major outer membrane protein, but two newly characterized alleles, tom40–2 and tom40–4, clearly do so (30Krimmer T. Rapaport D. Ryan M.T. Meisinger C. Kassenbrock C.K. Blachly-Dyson E. Forte M. Douglas M.G. Neupert N. Nargang F.E. Pfanner N. J. Cell Biol. 2000; 152: 289-300Crossref Scopus (137) Google Scholar). Moreover, we have used BNGE as a specific assay to directly monitor the assembly of in vitro imported Tom6 into pre-existing TOM complexes. The criterion of resistance to alkaline extraction used in the previous study (19Cao W. Douglas M.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 5674-5679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar) can be used to distinguish insertion into membranes but can be misleading when taken as a measure for correct assembly. The highest sequence similarity between Tom6 from N. crassaand yeast resides in the C-terminal domain, which includes the putative transmembrane segment. Therefore, this region is likely to be important for the function and/or assembly of Tom6, and this part of yeast Tom6 was reported to be essential for targeting to mitochondria and for proper assembly (31Cao W. Douglas M.G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 1996; 224: 457-461Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). Using N. crassa Tom6 our study has validated these findings. In addition, we have demonstrated that the C-terminal domain is necessary for initial targeting and membrane insertion, though is not sufficient for assembly into the TOM complex. The C-terminal domain apparently contains the information required for initial recognition of Tom6 precursor by the Tom components. This initial recognition is not specific with regard to the organism, as all constructs containing either the yeast or the N. crassaversion of this segment formed an early insertion intermediate withN. crassa mitochondria. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that this initial insertion is independent of the TOM complex, we favor a model where this intermediate is loosely attached to the TOM complex and dissociates from it under the conditions of BNGE. The second possibility is supported by the observation that this early intermediate can be precipitated, albeit inefficiently, by antibodies against Tom components. The C-terminal domain is also required for membrane insertion as it contains the segment required for anchoring the protein in the outer membrane. Following membrane insertion Tom6 is assembled into pre-existing TOM complexes. Membrane insertion of Tom6 and its assembly into functional complexes are not necessarily coupled events. Different conditions are required for each process, and it may be that in each step different segments of the Tom6 molecule are involved. The C-terminal tail-anchor domain is probably required for membrane insertion, whereas the process of assembly is more specific and requires additional non-conserved residues in the N-terminal cytosolic domain. Yeast Tom6 could not assemble into N. crassa TOM complex and vice versa. As Tom6 was found to be in dynamic contact with Tom22 and Tom40, these cytosolic residues may be involved in such interactions. This is highly reminiscent of the situation with Tom22, another tail-anchored protein, where import and assembly were also found to be dependent on a short segment of the cytosolic domain (32Rodriguez-Cousino N.

Isenmann S. Gratzer S. Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). The information for assembly of Tom6 into the complex is most likely located at the N-terminal flanking region of the putative transmembrane segment. A proteolytic fragment of Tom6 that lacked few N-terminal residues of its cytosolic domain maintained the ability to interact with Tom40 (25Rapaport D. Künkele K.-P. Dembowski M. Ahting U. Nargang F.E. Neupert W. Lill R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 5256-5262Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Furthermore, deletion of the N-terminal 12 amino acid residues did not affect assembly of the resulting construct, whereas deletion of 36 of 38 residues of the cytosolic domain resulted in an assembly-incompetent precursor. Like our findings on Tom6, a Tom22 variant that lacks part of the cytosolic domain was still delivered to the mitochondria in intact yeast cells but could not complement the phenotype of Δtom22 yeast mutants (33Egan B. Beilharz T. George R. Isenmann S. Gratzer S. Wattenberg B. Lithgow T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 451: 243-248Crossref PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). A hybrid precursor consisting of the cytosolic domain from N. crassa Tom6 and the C-terminal domain from yeast Tom6 were not able to assemble into either complex. Thus, a specific interaction between these two domains may facilitate assembly into the corresponding complex. Following their assembly, Tom6 and Tom7 were found to be part of the core structure of the TOM complex. Tom7 is in direct contact with Tom40, whereas the contact of Tom6 with Tom22 and Tom40 is dynamically modulated by preproteins in transit. Because chemical cross-linking did not reveal a direct contact between Tom40 and Tom22 (not shown), these results provide experimental support to the previously suggested role of Tom6 as a linking component between Tom40 and Tom22 (10Dekker P.J.T.

Studies in yeast and mammalian cells revealed that the telomere length is regulated by multiple factors including telomerase and telomeric repeat-binding proteins (TRPs) (9Lingner J. Cech T.R. Curr. Opin. Genet. & Dev. 1998; 8: 226-232Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Telomerase is a reverse transcriptase that uses an internal RNA moiety as a template for the extension of G-rich strand at the ends of DNA molecules (10Greider C.W. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 35-68Google Scholar) under the control of telomerase-associated proteins (11Bryan T.M. Sperger J.M. Chapman K.B. Cech T.R. Proc. Natl. Acad.

In human cells, telomerase activity and telomere length are tissue-specific and under developmental control (15Harley C.B. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 247-263Google Scholar). In plants, the telomerase activity is also correlated with the cellular proliferation capacity (16Fitzgerald M.S.

However, telomere length remains unchanged during development in some species but shortens dramatically in others (19Riha K. Fajkus J. Siroky J. Vyskot B. Plant Cell. 1998; 10: 1691-1698Crossref PubMed Scopus (134) Google Scholar, 20Zentgraf U. Hinderhofer K. Kolb D. Plant Mol.

This implies that telomerase may not be the sole factor in controlling telomere length in plants. Disruption of the gene for the telomerase catalytic subunit inArabidopsis only results in a slow loss of telomeric DNA (22Fitzgerald M.S. Riha K. Gao F. Ren S. Mcknight T.D. Shippen D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 96: 14813-14818Crossref Scopus (171) Google Scholar), indicating that the telomerase-deficient plant cells may have other, unknown, mechanism(s) to prevent telomeres from shortening rapidly. TRPs bind directly to either single-stranded or double-stranded telomeric DNA. The former interact with single-stranded 3′ extension of the extreme termini and are important for the maintenance of telomere length by restricting access of telomerase to chromosome termini (23Froelich-Ammon S.J.

The Rap1p, an abundant telomeric protein in budding yeast, inhibits telomere elongation (30Marcand S. Gilson E. Shore D. Science. 1997; 275: 986-990Crossref PubMed Scopus (428) Google Scholar) and controls the expression of numerous genes involved in cell growth (31Fang G. Cech T.R. Telomeres. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1995: 69-105Google Scholar). The Taz1p is not only a factor in the negative regulation of telomere length (26Cooper J.P. Nimmo E.R. Allshire R.C. Cech T.R. Nature. 1997; 385: 744-747Crossref PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar) but is also required for meiotic telomere clustering and genetic recombination in fission yeast (32Cooper J.P.

In human cells, telomere length is negatively regulated by hTRF1 (35van Steensel B. de Lange T.

Cell. 1998; 92: 401-413Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1456) Google Scholar). Lack of hTRF2 induces apoptosis in some cell lines (38Karlseder J. Broccoli D. Dai Y. Hardy S. de Lange T. Science. 1999; 283: 1321-1325Crossref PubMed Scopus (909) Google Scholar). These results suggest that TRPs play a crucial role in telomere and cellular metabolism. To explore the structure and function of TRPs in plants, efforts have been made to characterize the factors that can bind to plant telomeric sequence. These studies included the detection of double-stranded telomeric DNA-binding protein in maize and Arabidopsis crude extracts (39Regad F. Lebas M. Lescure B. J. Mol. Biol. 1994; 239: 163-169Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), the identification of factors that bind to single-stranded G-rich telomeric repeats in rice and mung bean nuclear extracts (40Kim J.H. Kim W.T. Chung I.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1998; 36: 661-672Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 41Lee J.H. Kim J.H. Kim W.T. Kang B.G. Chung I.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 547-557Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar), and the characterization of anArabidopsis protein (ATBP1) that binds to the G-rich as well as to the double-stranded telomeric sequence (20Zentgraf U. Hinderhofer K. Kolb D. Plant Mol. Biol. 2000; 42: 429-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 42Zentgraf U. Plant Mol. Biol. 1995; 27: 467-475Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). A recent paper described the cloning of a rice cDNA that encodes a protein (RTBP1) that contains a C-terminal telomeric DNA-binding domain (43Yu E.Y. Kim S.E. Kim J.H. Ko J.H. Cho M.H. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24208-24214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The isolated DNA-binding domain of RTBP1 bound specifically to the duplex oligonucleotide sequence (TTTAGGG)4; however, no evidence was shown that the full-length protein of RTBP1 can distinguish DNA fragments carrying long arrays of telomeric repeats from those with short ones. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the RTBP1 is bound to the long stretches of telomeric repeats at chromosome ends or to the short telomeric repeats in interstitial regions of plant chromosomes. Moreover, the exact core sequence in the plant telomeric repeat recognized by the isolated DNA-binding domain of RTBP1 has not yet been defined. The mode of interaction between TRP and telomeric DNA in plants therefore remains unclear. We report here the cloning of an Arabidopsis gene (AtTRP1) and the corresponding cDNA, which was expressed in bacteria to produce a protein that specifically binds to the double-stranded plant telomeric sequence. The DNA-binding domain of AtTRP1 was defined, and the core sequence of each telomeric repeat recognized by the isolated DNA-binding domain of AtTRP1 has been determined. The minimum length of a telomeric DNA fragment bound by an AtTRP1 protein has been defined. Our in vitro evidence indicates that the AtTRP1 protein may be located primarily at the ends of plant chromosomes. The oligonucleotide (TTTAGGG)4 was placed upstream of the minimal promoter in pHISi and pLacZi vectors (CLONTECH, CA). These vectors were linearized and sequentially integrated into the chromosomes of yeast strain YM4271 (MATa, ura3-52, his3-200, ade2-101, lys2-801, leu2-3, 112, trp1-903, tyr1-501, gal4-Δ512, gal80-Δ538, ade5::hisG) to generate a reporter strain YR14. Background LacZ activity in late logarithmic phase cells of YR14 was low enough to be distinguished from a positive interaction. Low plating density (108 cells per 150-mm plate) and 3-aminotriazole (45 mm) were used to suppress growth on histidine-deficient (−His) plates resulting from the low level of (TTTAGGG)4-HIS3 reporter gene expression. AnArabidopsis cDNA expression library cloned into the GAL4 activation domain (GAD) vector pGAD10 (CLONTECH, CA) was amplified in Escherichia coli. Purified library DNA (30 μg) was used to transform the YR14 strain. Positive clones were selected on plates containing SD/−Leu/−His medium plus 45 mm 3-aminotriazole followed by assay for β-galactosidase activity (CLONTECH, CA). Plasmids in positive clones were rescued by transformation into E. coli. The insert in cDNA clone 1-1 was used as a probe to isolate overlapping cDNA clones from an Arabidopsis cDNA library in λgt11 and genomic clones from an Arabidopsis genomic library in λEMBL3SP6/T7 (CLONTECH, CA). To obtain the 5′ end of full-length cDNA, rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) was performed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify the Arabidopsis cDNA library in pGAD10 with flanking primer GADP1 (5′CTATTCGATGATGAAGATACCCCACCAAACCC3′) and AtTRP1 primer TBP12 (5′GGGACTCAAAGATCCCCG3′). The 5′-RACE PCR product was digested with EcoRI and cloned into pUC18. All the cDNA and genomic clones were sequenced in both strands using an ABI377 automatic sequencer. Homology searches were made against sequences in the data base of both GenBankTM and that generated by theArabidopsis Genome Initiative using BLAST. A full-length cDNA was obtained by digestion of partial cDNA clones (Fig.1 A) with appropriate enzymes, followed by sequential ligation. To generate cDNA subfragments oligonucleotides containing modified sequences of AtTRP1 were used as primers for PCR to amplify the full-length cDNA: Bamp12 (GAATTTGGATCCGCAAGCTACC, derived from 1068–1089) and Bamp16 (GTACAACGGATCCTCTAAAAGCC, derived from 3685–3663) for Δ12, Bamp3 (TATCTGGATCCGTTACTGATGA, derived from 2007–2028) and Bamp16 for Δ1, Bamp4 (GGTGATGGATCCGTGAGCACTTTAC, derived from 2441–2466) and Bamp16 for Δ2, Bamp5 (CTTGTGAGGATCCCTACCTGTG, derived from 2731–2753) and Bamp16 for Δ3, Bamp6 (GCAGCAGGATCCCAACGCAGAA, derived from 2942–2964) and Bamp16 for Δ4. These PCR products were digested with BamHI and cloned into pET3a (44Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). To obtain DNA fragment Δ11, the 640-bp XbaI fragment was excised form the DNA fragment Δ12, and the flanking fragments were ligated and cloned into pET3a. To generate DNA fragment Δ31, Bamp3 was coupled with Sacp3 (GTTGTGGAGCTCCTTAGCCGTG, derived from 3328–3306) and Bamp16 was coupled with Sacp1 (GGTCTGTTAGAGCTCTAAATGAATC, derived from 3469–3493) to generate, respectively, DNA fragments Δ16 and Δ18 from the full-length cDNA by PCR amplification. Fragments Δ16 and Δ18 were digested with SacI and BamHI and then ligated withBamHI-cut pET3a. All the truncated cDNAs were sequenced to confirm that the sequences are correct. These truncated cDNAs in pET3a were placed under the control of a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. Each construct was transformed in E. coli BL21(DE3) cells that were then induced by 0.4 mmisopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) to synthesize the truncated AtTRP1 (44Studier F.W. Rosenberg A.H. Dunn J.J. Dubendorff J.W. Methods Enzymol. 1990; 185: 60-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (6006) Google Scholar). All the AtTRP1 derivatives produced in bacteria contain an N-terminal addition of 14 amino acids encoded by the DNA sequence of gene 10 of T7 phage fused to theBamHI site in pET3a. After induction of the cultures with IPTG for 2 h at 37 °C, the cells were spun down, washed twice with buffer containing 50 mm Tris, pH 7.5, 0.2m NaCl, and 5% glycerol, resuspended in 1× DNA-protein binding buffer (20 mm Hepes, pH 7.6, 1 mm EDTA, 5% glycerol, 10 mm(NH4)2SO4, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 0.2% Tween 20, and 30 mm KCl) plus 0.1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture (Roche Molecular Biochemicals), broken by sonication, and centrifuged at 18,000 rpm for 1 h at 4 °C. The supernatant was aliquoted and stored at −80 °C. The amount of truncated AtTRP1 in each extract was estimated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel; comparable amounts of truncated proteins were tested for DNA binding activity in gel retardation experiments. The crude extract containing the protein ΔN-463 (Fig. 3 A) was precipitated with 45% (NH4)2SO4, and the pellet was resuspended in 1× DNA-protein binding buffer plus 0.1 mm PMSF and 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture prior to the fractionation on the plant telomeric sequence-specific DNA affinity column. To purify the almost full-length protein of AtTRP1, the extract containing the protein ΔN-12 (Fig. 3 A) was fractionated through the DEAE column in the equilibration buffer (20 mmethanolamine, pH 9.5, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mmEDTA, 5% glycerol, 0.1 mm PMSF, and 1× proteinase inhibitor mixture) containing stepwise increases in NaCl concentration. Most of the degraded form of ΔN-12 appeared in both the flow-through and the 0.1 m NaCl eluent. The intact form of ΔN-12 was eluted from the DEAE column with 0.4 m NaCl and further purified on the specific DNA affinity column in 1× DNA-protein binding buffer containing stepwise increases in KCl concentration. Proteins ΔN-463 and ΔN-12 were eluted, respectively, at 0.6 and 1m KCl from the DNA affinity column. The eluents containing telomeric sequence binding activity were desalted, concentrated, and purified once more on the same DNA affinity column, which was set up by coupling the biotinylated duplex (TTTAGGG)8 DNA to the streptavidin-agarose beads in 1× DNA-protein binding buffer. The purified AtTRP1 derivatives were stored at −80 °C. The single-stranded or duplex oligonucleotides were end-labeled with digoxigenin-11-ddUTP (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) and used as the probe for gel retardation assay. Gel retardation assays were done in a volume of 20 μl containing 1× DNA-protein binding buffer, 1 μg of poly[d(I-C)], 0.1 μg of poly-l-lysine, 1 pmol of digoxigenin-labeled probe, and 5–10 μg of crude extracts or various amounts of the purified proteins. For competition experiments, the binding reaction was augmented with various amounts of competitor DNA. After 30 min at 25 °C, the free and bound DNA were separated by electrophoresis on 4 or 6% polyacrylamide gels in 0.5× TBE (44.5 mm Tris borate, 1 mm EDTA, pH 8.0) at 4 °C, transferred to nylon membranes, and detected by chemiluminescent reaction using CSPD (C18H20CIO7PNa2) as substrate (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The purified protein ΔN-12 was either analyzed directly on the 8% denatured SDS-polyacrylamide gel or subjected to gel retardation assay on the 4% native polyacrylamide gel, electrophoretically transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, and hybridized with a polyclonal rabbit antiserum against a synthetic peptide containing residues 34–45 of AtTRP1. The membranes were washed to remove the unbound rabbit antiserum, incubated with alkaline phosphatase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody, and detected by chemiluminescent reaction using CSPD as substrate (CLONTECH, CA). Southern hybridization, amplification, and screening of DNA libraries, bacterial transformation, plasmid isolation, gel electrophoresis, and PCR were performed as described (45Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Yeast transformation and recovery of plasmids from yeast were done as described by the manufacturer (CLONTECH, CA). The cDNA clones encoding TRPs inA. thaliana were isolated by a yeast one-hybrid system. Plasmids from all three positive transformants of yeast contained an identical cDNA insert, 1-1, of 1.1 kbp in size (Fig.1 A). Overlapping cDNAs 1–9 and 1–20 were subsequently obtained using 1-1 as a probe. The resulting sequence was extended further in the 5′ direction by RACE on the cDNA library from which the clone 1-1 was isolated. Alignment of the cDNA clones and the RACE product, 1–21, yielded a contiguous sequence spanning 2391 base pairs (bp). A genomic clone, G1, containing AtTRP1 (Fig. 1 A) was obtained from a phage library using cDNA 1-1 as a probe. Southern hybridization revealed that AtTRP1 is a single copy gene (data not shown). Comparison of the sequences of the genomic and cDNA clones ofAtTRP1 indicated that this gene contains nine introns and the first exon is untranslated (Fig. 1 A). Each intron contains the conserved dinucleotides GT and AG at 5′ and 3′ boundaries, respectively, suggesting that all the introns are of the U2-type (46Sharp P.A. Burge C.B. Cell. 1997; 91: 875-879Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (217) Google Scholar). A TATAAA sequence was located 63 bp upstream from the first exon and is assumed to be the TATA box. The entire sequence of AtTRP1matches exactly that of a genomic DNA fragment cloned from the chromosome 5 of Arabidopsis thaliana (GenBankTMAB025604). Conceptual translation of the 2.4 kbp cDNA sequence reveals an open reading frame of 578 amino acids that is predicted to encode a 65-kDa protein with a pI of 8.4 (Fig. 1 B). This protein, AtTRP1, contains four clusters of basic residues (Fig. 1, B andC). The amino acid sequences in the first two clusters (residues 22–36 and 213–219) are similar to those in the nuclear localization signals (NLS) of the maize R gene product (47Shieh M.W. Wessler S.R. Raikhel N.V. Plant Physiol. 1993; 101: 353-361Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The sequence in the third cluster (residues 250–256) is homologous to that in the NLS of SV40 T antigen, which facilitates the targeting of proteins into nuclei of plants (48van der Krol A.R. Chua N.H. Plant Cell. 1991; 3: 667-675Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar) and yeast (49Osborne M.A. Silver P.A. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 219-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The presence of multiple NLS suggests that AtTRP1 may be a nuclear protein. The last cluster (residues 450–454), located next to the Myb motif, may help the DNA-protein interaction since it is rich in positive charges and close to the DNA-binding domain of AtTRP1 (see below). The sequence of amino acids 466–520 is not only homologous to the Myb-related DNA-binding motifs present in yeast and mammalian TRPs (Fig.1 D) but is also highly similar to the DNA-binding domain of the rice protein RTBP1 (Fig. 2), suggesting that this region may be important for binding plant telomeric sequence. In addition to the Myb motif and NLS, AtTRP1 contains short clusters of acidic residues at its N-terminal end and glutamine-rich regions on both sides of the Myb motif (Fig.1 B). Most interesting, AtTRP1 also contains contiguous residues at several regions identical or similar to those of RTBP1 (43Yu E.Y. Kim S.E. Kim J.H. Ko J.H. Cho M.H. Chung I.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 24208-24214Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and of three initiator-binding proteins in plants, including HPPBF1 (GenBankTMAF072536) from A. thaliana, BPF1 from parsley (50de Costa e Silva O. Klein L. Schmeizer E. Trezzini G.F. Hahlbrock K. Plant J. 1993; 4: 125-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar), and IBP1 from maize (51Lugert T. Werr W. Plant Mol. Biol. 1994; 25: 493-506Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar) (Fig. 2). HPPBF1 and BPF1 bind, respectively, to the promoters of the genes encoding the H protein of glycine decarboxylase and phenylalanine ammonia lyase. IBP1 binds to the promoter of the shrunken (Sh) gene involved in carbohydrate metabolism. To map the DNA-binding domain of AtTRP1, cDNAs encoding various truncated proteins (Fig.3 A) were cloned into the vector pET3a and expressed in bacteria. Treatment of these cultures with IPTG resulted in the accumulation of a unique protein in each bacterial lysate (Fig. 3 B). Since the DNA sequence analysis has revealed that each cDNA construction only encodes a single polypeptide, the unique protein in each lysate probably represents the intact form of the corresponding truncated protein. The gel retardation assay of truncated proteins showed that the protein ΔN-463 retained the DNA binding activity (Fig. 3, A and C). This truncated protein consists of the Myb motif and a C-terminal polypeptide rich in glutamine (Fig. 1 B). Removal of this glutamine-rich polypeptide abolished the DNA binding activity of the truncated protein ΔN-262, suggesting that the protein ΔN-463 contains a domain essential for recognizing the telomeric sequence. Since the molecular weight of the protein ΔN-12 is greater than that of the protein ΔN-325 (Fig. 3, A and B), it is expected that the complex containing ΔN-12 will migrate more slowly on the native gel than the complex containing ΔN-325 in the reaction with an identical probe. However, incubation of the extract containing ΔN-12 with the probe (TTTAGGG)4 produced two weak complexes that migrated faster than the single strong complex produced by incubating the extract containing ΔN-325 with the identical probe (Fig. 3 C). The unexpected mobility of ΔN-12-containing complexes may be due to the proteolysis of ΔN-12 in the complexes but also could be due to some difference in the shapes between the complexes containing ΔN-12 and that containing ΔN-325. Failure to detect the strong slowly migrating complex(es) in either case indicates that the probe (TTTAGGG)4 may be too short to be bound efficiently by the protein ΔN-12, since the SDS-PAGE analysis revealed that the amount of intact ΔN-12 is similar to that of intact ΔN-325 in the extract (Fig. 3 B). A similar phenomenon was also observed in the gel retardation assay of the extracts containing the proteins 13–223 + 452–578 and ΔN-262 (Fig. 3 C). Based on the ability of binding the probe (TTTAGGG)4, these truncated proteins with the functional DNA-binding domain can be classified into two groups as follows: (a) group I, including ΔN-12, 13–223 + 452–578 and ΔN-262, binding the probe poorly, and (b) group II, including ΔN-325, ΔN-393, and ΔN-463, binding the probe efficiently (Fig. 3 A). The DNA binding activities among the truncated proteins within each group cannot be compared with one another until each one of them is purified. To identify the core sequence in the telomeric DNA recognized by the DNA-binding domain of AtTRP1, the protein ΔN-463 containing the DNA-binding domain of AtTRP1 was purified to near-homogeneity (Fig. 4 A). Seven duplex oligonucleotides, representing all possible combinations of four contiguous and identical plant telomeric repeats with one permutated nucleotide at a time, were used as probes for gel retardation assay of the purified protein ΔN-463 (Fig.4 B). By using as little as 1 pmol of protein, one or two types of complexes (I and II) were observed, and as the protein concentration is increased, complexes with slower mobilities (III and IV) were observed. In the reactions using the probe (GGTTTAG)4, four complexes were observed, of which the complex IV became predominant at high molar ratios of protein to DNA probe (Fig. 4 B, lanes 31–36), suggesting that this protein recognizes each of the four sites in the probe (GGTTTAG)4 with equal efficiency (Fig. 4 C). The probe (GGGTTTA)4 also formed four complexes with the same protein, but the intensity of complex III was always higher than that of complex IV, even when a high molar ratio of protein to the DNA probe was used (Fig. 4 B, lanes 25–30), suggesting that one of the sites in the probe (GGGTTTA)4 is bound less efficiently by this protein than the other three (Fig. 4 C). Similarly, one of the four sites in (TTTAGGG)4 is bound less efficiently than the other three by this protein (Fig.4 B, lanes 1–6 and 4C). It should be noticed that to form the complex IV, (TTTAGGG)4 requires greater amounts of the protein ΔN-463 than does (GGGTTTA)4 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 1–6 and25–30). In the reactions containing probes (TAGGGTT)4 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 13–18) and (AGGGTTT)4 (Fig. 4 B, lanes 19–24), complexes I–III were observed clearly but complex IV only weakly. These data suggest that, in each probe, one site is recognized poorly, and the other three sites are bound efficiently by the protein ΔN-463. Only three complexes were formed in the reacti"

Cleavage of HC at the A1-A2 and A2-B junctions generates the A1 and A2 subunits of factor VIIIa. Although the isolated A2 subunit stimulates factor IXa-catalyzed generation of factor Xa by ∼100-fold, the isolated HC, free from the LC, showed no effect in this assay. However, extended reaction of HC with factors IXa and X resulted in an increase in factor IXa activity because of conversion of the HC to A1 and A2 subunits by factor Xa. HC cleavage by thrombin or factor Xa yielded similar products, although factor Xa cleaved at a rate of ∼1% observed for thrombin. HC showed little inhibition of the A2 subunit-dependent stimulation of factor IXa activity, suggesting that factor IXa-interactive sites are masked in the A2 domain of HC. Furthermore, HC showed no effect on the fluorescence anisotropy of fluorescein-Phe-Phe-Arg-factor IXa in the presence of factor X, whereas thrombin-cleaved HC yielded a marked increase in this parameter. These results indicate that HC cleavage by either thrombin or factor Xa is essential to expose the factor IXa-interactive site(s) in the A2 subunit required to modulate protease activity. Factor VIII circulates as a noncovalent heterodimer consisting of a heavy chain (HC, contiguous A1-A2-B domains) and light chain (LC). Cleavage of HC at the A1-A2 and A2-B junctions generates the A1 and A2 subunits of factor VIIIa. Although the isolated A2 subunit stimulates factor IXa-catalyzed generation of factor Xa by ∼100-fold, the isolated HC, free from the LC, showed no effect in this assay. However, extended reaction of HC with factors IXa and X resulted in an increase in factor IXa activity because of conversion of the HC to A1 and A2 subunits by factor Xa.

These results indicate that HC cleavage by either thrombin or factor Xa is essential to expose the factor IXa-interactive site(s) in the A2 subunit required to modulate protease activity. Factor VIII, the plasma protein deficient or defective in individuals with hemophilia A, is synthesized as a 300-kDa precursor (1Wood W.I. Capon D.J. Simonsen C.C. Eaton D.L. Gitschier J. Keyt B.

It is processed to a series of divalent metal ion-dependent heterodimers after cleavage at the B-A3 junction, generating a HC1 (A1-A2-B domains) and a LC (A3-C1-C2 domains). Additional cleavage sites within the B domain result in variably sized HCs minimally represented by contiguous A1-A2 domains. The two chains can be separated by chelating reagents (4Fass D.N. Knutson G.J. Katzmann J.A. Blood. 1982; 59: 594-600Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 5Fay P.J. Anderson M.T. Chavin S.I. Marder V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar) and isolated after ion exchange and/or immunoaffinity chromatography. Factor VIII activity can be reconstituted from the separated chains by combining them in the presence of a divalent metal ion (6Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Factor VIII functions in the intrinsic factor Xase complex as a cofactor for the serine protease, factor IXa in the surface-dependent conversion of factor X to Xa. This activity is dependent upon conversion of factor VIII to the active cofactor form, factor VIIIa, by thrombin or factor Xa. These enzymes cleave factor VIII HC at Arg-740, removing the B domain (or fragments) and at Arg-372, bisecting the HC into the A1 and the A2 subunits (7Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar). The proteases also cleave factor VIII LC at Arg-1689 (7Eaton D. Rodriguez H. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1986; 25: 505-512Crossref PubMed Scopus (392) Google Scholar), liberating an acid-rich region and creating a new NH2 terminus. Thus, factor VIIIa is a heterotrimer of subunits designated as A1, A2, and A3-C1-C2 (8Lollar P. Parker C.G. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 666-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar, 9Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The A1 and A3-C1-C2 subunits retain the divalent metal ion-dependent linkage, whereas the A2 subunit is weakly associated with the A1–A3-C1-C2 dimer by primarily electrostatic interactions (9Fay P.J.

Chem. 1990; 265: 1688-1692Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two regions of factor VIII have been identified as interactive sites for factor IXa. A high affinity site (K d∼15 nm (11Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)) was localized to the A3 domain of the LC in and around residues 1811–1818 (12Lenting P.J. van de Loo J.W. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 1935-1940Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar). A second, lower affinity site (K d∼300 nm (13Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar)) was localized within the (isolated) A2 domain and comprises residues 558–565 (14Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, isolated A2 subunit was shown to stimulate thek cat for factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X by ∼100-fold (13Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). This property appeared unique to A2 and was not observed for either the isolated A1 or A3-C1-C2 subunit. However, the A1 subunit synergistically increased the cofactor activity of the isolated A2 subunit by ∼10-fold (15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Proteolysis of the LC during activation is responsible for the dissociation of factor VIIIa from its carrier protein, von Willebrand factor (16Hamer R.J. Koedam J.A. Beeser-Visser N.H. Sixma J.J. Eur. J. Biochem. 1987; 167: 253-259Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). This cleavage also appears to increase the cofactor activity of factor VIIIa (17Donath M.S.

Chem. 1995; 270: 8546-8552Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). The function of HC cleavage (at Arg-372) is not well understood. However, this step is essential for generating cofactor activity based upon mutations at this which result in severe hemophilia (19Kemball-Cook G. Tuddenham E.G.D. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 128-132Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The isolated A2 subunit of factor VIIIa shows a several hundredfold weaker affinity for factor IXa and ∼1% of the cofactor activity compared with intact factor VIIIa (13Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). It is unknown whether these low level activities are intrinsic to the HC or whether cleavage of the HC is necessary to manifest them. In this report we examine the capacity of isolated HC and derived subunits to modulate the catalytic activity of factor IXa in a purified system. Studies were performed in the absence of LC to preclude any interactions of this chain with factor IXa or factor X. Results show that intact HC possesses no detectable cofactor-like activity and fails to compete with isolated A2 subunit for interaction with factor IXa. However, its resultant cleavage by thrombin or (less efficiently) by factor Xa generates active subunits that show cofactor activity and modulation of factor IXa activity similar to that observed previously using the purified subunits. These results indicate that a primary role for HC cleavage during cofactor activation is the exposure of a functional factor IXa-interactive site. The reagents α-thrombin, factor IXaβ, factor X, factor Xa (Enzyme Research Laboratories), and Fl-FFR-factor IXaβ (Molecular Innovations) were purchased from the indicated vendors. Phospholipid vesicles composed of 20% PS, 40% PC, and 40% PE (Sigma) were prepared using octyl glucoside as described previously (20Mimms L.T. Zampighi G. Nozaki Y. Tanford C. Reynolds J.A.

Monoclonal antibody 413 binds an epitope defined by residues 484–508 (22Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Nakai H. Saenko E.L. Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Lollar P. J. Biol.

Recombinant factor VIII preparations were gifts from the Bayer Corporation and the Genetics Institute. Factor VIII HC was prepared as described previously (23Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14005-14010Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and is illustrated in Fig. 1. Potential trace levels of factor VIII LC present in the HC preparation were removed following chromatography using antibody 10104 coupled to Affi-Gel 10 as described previously (6Fay P.J. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1988; 262: 525-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). The A2 subunit was prepared following fractionation of factor VIIIa using Mono S as described previously (9Fay P.J. Haidaris P.J. Smudzin T.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8957-8962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The rate of conversion of factor X to factor Xa was monitored in a purified system (24Lollar P. Fay P.J. Fass D.N. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 222: 128-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). HC forms were reacted with factor IXa in 20 mm Hepes pH 7.2, 50 mm NaCl, 5 mm CaCl2, and 0.01% Tween 20 (buffer A) in the presence of 100 μg/ml bovine serum albumin and 10 μm phospholipid vesicles. Reactions were initiated with the addition of factor X (for reactant concentrations, see figure legends). Aliquots were removed at appropriate times to assess the initial rates of product formation and added to tubes containing EDTA (80 mm final concentration) to stop the reaction. Rates of factor Xa generation were determined by the addition of the chromogenic substrate, S-2765 (0.46 mm final concentration). Reactions were read at 405 nm using a V max microtiter plate reader (Molecular Devices). SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed using the method of Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (205531) Google Scholar) with a Bio-Rad minigel system. Electrophoresis was performed at 200V for 1 h. Proteins were stained using Gel-Code Blue (Pierce). Alternatively, the proteins were transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane using a Bio-Rad mini-transblot apparatus at 0.5 amps for 30 min in a buffer containing 10 mm CAPS, pH 11, and 10% (v/v) methanol. Western blotting used the R8B12 monoclonal followed by goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody. The secondary antibody signal was detected using the ECL system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) with luminol as substrate, and the blots were exposed to film for various times. Films were scanned, and band densities (obtained from a linear exposure range) were quantitated by using ImageQuant software (Molecular Devices). Rates of HC cleavage were calculated from the linear portion (initial time points) of the plotted data. Initial rates were estimated using best fit lines through points where ≤50% of the substrate had been converted to product. The concentration of HC remaining was calculated from band densities using the formula HC = (density of HC/(density of HC + density of A2 subunit)) × initial HC concentration. The concentration of A2 subunit formed following HC cleavage was calculated using the formula A2 subunit = (1− (density of HC/(density of HC + density of A2 subunit))) × initial HC concentration. Fluorescence anisotropy measurements were conducted using an Amico-Bowman series 2 spectrometer equipped with automatic polarizers arranged in an l-format. Reactions (0.2 ml) were run at room temperature in buffer A containing 90 nm Fl-FFR-IXa, 460 nm HC form, and 50 μm PSPCPE vesicles in the absence or presence of 500 nm factor X. Samples were excited at 495 nm, and the emission intensity was monitored at 520 nm (band pass = 4 nm) for 2 s at each polarizer position. Anisotropy values were calculated automatically after subtraction of blank readings. Data were averaged for at least five anisotropy measurements. Earlier we showed that the isolated A2 subunit of factor VIII stimulated the k cat for factor IXa-catalyzed conversion of factor X by ∼1% the level observed for factor VIIIa (13Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). The effect was enhanced further by 1 order of magnitude in the presence of saturating A1 subunit (15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Isolated factor VIII HC was assessed similarly for cofactor activity using a factor Xa generation assay and employing purified components. HC was obtained from EDTA-treated factor VIII as described under “Materials and Methods” and was essentially free from LC. Titration of intact HC in the factor Xa generation assay yielded virtually no activity increase under the reaction conditions described in Fig.2. However, prior cleavage of HC by thrombin to yield the HCIIa (free A1 and A2 subunits) resulted in a marked increase in the rate of factor Xa formed which was dose-dependent and saturable with respect to the cleaved HC. The concentration of substrate factor X used in these reactions (500 nm) represented near V maxlevels (data not shown). The extent of factor IXa stimulation observed at near saturating levels of HCIIa (1 μm;k cat ∼ 9 nm factor Xa generated/min/nmfactor IXa) was similar to that observed for factor IXa in the presence of an equivalent concentration of purified A2 plus A1 subunits (k cat ∼14 factor Xa generated/min/nm factor IXa) (15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). These results indicate that intact HC possesses no detectable factor IXa-stimulating activity and that this property is expressed only after cleavage of the HC to component subunits. To help exclude any contribution of trace factor VIII to these results, a series of experiments was performed in which HC was reacted first with one of three anti-factor VIII monoclonal antibodies prior to treatment with thrombin (Table I). Antibody 10104, a potent inhibitor that binds factor VIII LC (5Fay P.J. Anderson M.T. Chavin S.I. Marder V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar), showed no effect in inhibiting HCIIa activity, consistent with the absence of functional factor VIII in the assay. R8B12, an anti-A2 domainal monoclonal with little inhibitory activity, also showed no effect. However, antibody 413, which binds an epitope defined by A2 domain residues 484–508 (22Healey J.F. Lubin I.M. Nakai H. Saenko E.L. Hoyer L.W. Scandella D. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14505-14509Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and blocks the interaction between isolated A2 subunit and factor IXa (26Fay P.J. Scandella D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 29826-29830Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), completely eliminated the cofactor activity of HCIIa. These results support the conclusion that the activity observed was attributed to HCIIa and was not the result of trace contamination of the HC preparation with functional factor VIII.Table IEffects of anti-factor VIII antibodies on the stimulation of factor IXa activity by thrombin-cleaved HCAntibody1-aPurified IgG (1 μm) was reacted with HC (300 nm) for 1 h prior to cleavage by thrombin and addition to the factor Xa generation assay containing 5 nm factor IXa, 10 μmPSPCPE vesicles, and 500 nm factor X in buffer A.Residual activity1-bFactor Xa generation was determined as described under “Materials and Methods” and is represented as percent of control (no antibody).

Open table in a new tab Interestingly, although no activity of HC was detected using the early time points after its addition to the factor Xa generation assay, prolonged incubation of these reaction components yielded the appearance of factor Xa-generating activity (Fig.3). In this experiment, HC was reacted in the presence of factor IXa, factor X, and PSPCPE vesicles. At the indicated times, an aliquot of this mixture was removed and assessed for the rate of factor Xa generation by a chromogenic assay and for HC cleavage by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting using the anti-A2 domain monoclonal antibody R8B12. Progress curves for factor Xa formation and HC cleavage began with an apparent lag phase followed by progressive increases in reaction rate and product appearance. The extent of factor Xa-generating activity paralleled cleavage of HC to form the A2 subunit. These results were reminiscent of earlier data illustrating factor Xa generation and cleavage of intact cofactor in a purified system lacking any factor X activator (27Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8056-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). Because no thrombin was present in the reaction, we attributed HC cleavage to factor Xa formed by factor IXa, the activity of which was accelerated after generation of the A1 and A2 subunits. Control experiments indicated the absence of HC cleavage when factor X was omitted from the reaction mixture (results not shown), thus precluding factor Xa formation as well as indicating that factor IXa did not utilize HC as a substrate. Furthermore, a marked reduction of HC cleavage was observed when the reaction was supplemented with the factor Xa-specific inhibitor, tick anticoagulant peptide (results not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that cleavage of HC resulted from factor Xa generated in the reaction mixture. The above results demonstrated that the isolated HC was a substrate for factor Xa which, similar to thrombin, can convert the inactive precursor to an active A2 subunit. To compare isolated HC as a substrate for thrombin and factor Xa, cleavage rates were determined from time course reactions. 300 nm hc in the presence of buffer A containing 10 μm phospholipid was reacted with either 5 nm thrombin or 50 nm factor Xa. This substrate concentration was chosen to parallel HC levels used in the factor Xa generation assays. Desitometry analyses of the Western blots reacted with R8B12 were used to calculate the concentration of epitope present as either HC or the A2 subunit. As observed in the inset in Fig. 4, intact HC is represented by a series of bands (∼210–130 kDa) that are first cleaved to an intermediate of ∼90 kDa (contiguous A1-A2 domains). This intermediate is then cleaved to yield the ∼40-kDa A2 subunit plus A1. We originally observed this processing step for the HC of factor VIII by thrombin (5Fay P.J. Anderson M.T. Chavin S.I. Marder V.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1986; 871: 268-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (123) Google Scholar). Interestingly, factor Xa follows a similar reaction pathway. Because the factor VIII heterodimer comprising a 90-kDa HC is activable by thrombin to the same extent as heterodimers with higherM r HC, the density attributed to the 90-kDa band was combined with these HC forms. Thus, the rates of cleavage reflect conversion to the final product, A2 subunit. The rate of A2 formation catalyzed by thrombin was significantly greater than that observed for factor Xa. Examination of initial time points (≤50% substrate utilized) using a linear curve fit indicated rates of ∼33.3 min−1 and 0.4 min−1 for thrombin and factor Xa, respectively. Although these values obtained at a single HC concentration allow for a limited comparison of rate for substrate cleavage by the two enzymes under these reaction conditions, cleavage by factor Xa appeared to occur at ∼1–2% the rate observed for thrombin. One likely reason for this markedly slower rate by factor Xa is the absence of LC, which is required for association of factor VIII with the phospholipid surface, a requisite step for efficient cleavage of factor VIII by this protease (27Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8056-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). The above results using a functional assay demonstrate essentially no effect of isolated HC on the catalytic activity of factor IXa. To determine whether this chain influences the active site of the protease, fluorescence anisotropy using a Fl-FFR-labeled factor IXa was performed. Earlier results demonstrated that this parameter was affected little if any by isolated A2 subunit, whereas a significant increase in anisotropy was observed in the presence of substrate factor X (13Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Inclusion of isolated HC showed no effect on the anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXa, either in the absence or presence of factor X (Table II). However, prior cleavage of HC with thrombin resulted in a marked increase in anisotropy observed in the presence of factor X, consistent with the generated A2 subunit altering the factor IXa active site. These results indicate the uncleaved HC does not affect the active site of factor IXa, consistent with its lack of affect in enhancing catalytic activity.Table IIEffects of HC cleavage and substrate on the fluorescence anisotropy of Fl-FFR-factor IXaCondition2-aReactions contained 90 nm Fl-FFR-factor IXa and 50 μm PSPCPE vesicles in the absence and presence of 460 nm each intact HC or thrombin-cleaved HC (HCIIa).

Open table in a new tab The isolated A2 subunit binds factor IXa with aK d ∼ 300 nm, whereas the A1 subunit does not appear to bind the protease directly (13Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) nor affect the affinity of A2 subunit for factor IXa (15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus any potential factor IXa-interactive site in the HC is likely contained within the A2 domain. To assess the relative affinity of HC and the derived A2 subunit for factor IXa, a competition assay was performed using stimulation of factor IXa activity by A2 subunit as an indicator of the interaction. The effect of increasing amounts of HC on this stimulation was subsequently determined. Results in Fig.5 show stimulation of factor IXa-catalyzed generation of factor Xa in the presence of 100 nm A2 subunit. Addition of HC resulted in little change in the A2-dependent stimulation of activity. At 1 μm HC, a 10-fold excess relative to A2 subunit, the A2-dependent activity was reduced by ∼20%. This result suggests that the affinity of factor IXa for HC is at least 1 order of magnitude weaker than that for the A2 subunit. To gain insights into the contribution made by HC cleavage to cofactor activation, a series of experiments was performed using purified HC in the absence of LC to preclude any interaction of the latter with components of the assay. In this report we show that cleavage of isolated factor VIII HC is essential for subsequent interaction with factor IXa and stimulation of its catalytic activity. The isolated A2 subunit of factor VIIIa is capable of binding factor IXa and stimulating the activation of factor X (13Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar); however, the isolated HC (i) showed no stimulation of factor IXa in the generation of factor Xa, (ii) did not affect the conformation in and around the active site of the enzyme in the absence or presence of substrate, and (iii) failed to compete effectively with the A2 subunit for binding factor IXa as judged by a functional assay. Thus, these results indicate that (isolated) HC is devoid of the basal cofactor-like activities associated with its component subunits. These results are consistent with the observed lack of cofactor activity in the unactivated factor VIII heterodimer (27Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8056-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). It is of interest to note that both thrombin and factor Xa cleave the isolated HC, although with markedly disparate efficiency. The slow cleavage of HC by low levels of factor Xa in the Xa generation assay resulted in the time-dependent stimulation of the reaction rate. This can be attributed to production of A2 subunit, which could then serve as cofactor to factor IXa. In a more controlled experiment, we show that HC cleavage by factor Xa occurred at ∼1–2% the rate observed for thrombin. These reactions contained a phospholipid surface, which is requisite for optimal factor Xa activity. However, the absence of factor VIII LC precluded association of HC with surface and this condition severely retarded cleavage by the protease. Consistent with this observation was the recent identification of a factor Xa-interactive site within the C2 domain of factor VIII (28Nogami K. Shima M. Hosokawa K. Suzuki T. Koide T. Saenko E.L. Scandella D. Shibata M. Kamisue S. Tanaka I. Yoshioka A. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31000-31007Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar). In the absence of LC, we speculate that the factor X site localized to HC residues 337–372 (29Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 2082-2088Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) may serve as an interactive site for (solution phase) factor Xa binding and cleavage of the subunit. Support for this speculation comes from studies employing a zero-length cross-linker that indicated that this site was bound by a region of the protease-forming domain of factor X distinct from the activation peptide sequence (30Lapan K.A. Fay P.J. Thromb. Haemostasis. 1998; 80: 418-422Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Using intact porcine factor VIII as substrate, Lollar et al.(27Lollar P. Knutson G.J. Fass D.N. Biochemistry. 1985; 24: 8056-8064Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar) showed that the catalytic efficiency (k cat/K m) for cofactor cleavage was ∼5-fold greater for thrombin compared with factor Xa. Results of that study also indicated that factor VIIIa activity generated by thrombin was ∼3-fold greater than that generated by factor Xa. Our data do not suggest that the isolated (human) HC cleaved by factor Xa possesses significantly less activity than thrombin-cleaved HC. Results obtained in Fig. 2 showed that the complete conversion of 300 nm HC by factor Xa yielded activity similar to that observed earlier with an equivalent concentration of isolated A2 plus A1 subunits prepared following cleavage of factor VIII by thrombin (15Fay P.J. Koshibu K. Mastri M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15401-15406Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Thus, the activator-dependent disparity in cofactor activity may reflect a differential effect and/or contribution of the factor VIII LC cleavage, or it may indicate a species difference. Recently, Lollar and co-workers (31Parker E.T. Pohl J. Blackburn M.N. Lollar P. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 9365-9373Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) characterized more fully factor Xa-activated (porcine) factor VIIIa and noted cleavage sites in the HC at Arg-219 (A1 domain) and Arg-490 (A2 domain) in addition to those HC sites cleaved by thrombin (Arg-372 and Arg-740). Although the Arg-490 site is present in the human protein, residue 219 is Gln and thus would not be attacked efficiently by the protease. However, Arg-490 in the isolated human HC did not appear to be cleaved at any appreciable level because the fragment generated (residues 491–740) would retain reactivity with the R8B12 antibody, and this fragment was not detected in our blots. We did note, however, that the spacing between the A2 doublet bands was somewhat greater for the Xa-cleaved material, reflecting a slightly smaller, lower M r band in the doublet. The reason for this is unclear at the present time. The results presented in this study are compatible with, at best, a weak affinity interaction between HC and factor IXa. In an earlier report, Lenting et al. (11Lenting P.J. Donath M.J. van Mourik J.A. Mertens K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 7150-7155Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) used a solid phase binding assay in the absence of phospholipid to show that isolated factor VIII LC bound factor IXa with high affinity (K d ∼15 nm). However, no detectable factor IXa binding was observed using HC up to ∼300 nm. A factor IXa site has been localized to residues 558–565 in the A2 subunit (14Fay P.J. Beattie T. Huggins C.F. Regan L.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 20522-20527Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, we showed that isolated A2 subunit bound factor IXa in a phospholipid-containing system with a functional K d∼300 nm (13Fay P.J. Koshibu K. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 19049-19054Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). In the absence of a surface, saturation of factor IXa with A2 subunit is not readily achieved reflecting aK d >5 μm. 2P. J. Fay, M. Mastri, and M. E. Koszelak, unpublished observation. Thus the phospholipid surface likely orients factor IXa such that collisions with A2 subunit are more productive. In this report, we show that a 10-fold molar excess of HC relative to A2 subunit marginally inhibited the A2-dependent stimulation of factor IXa activity, suggesting that the affinity of isolated HC for the enzyme is at least 10-fold weaker (>3 μm) than that of the derived A2 subunit. One model consistent with these observations is that cleavage of HC is required to expose the factor IXa-interactive site(s). Several lines of evidence demonstrate a conformational change in factor VIII HC following the conversion of factor VIII to factor VIIIa. For example, reaction of factor VIIIa with the zero-length cross-linker, EDC, resulted in formation of a covalent linkage between A1 and A2 subunits (32O'Brien L.M. Huggins C.F. Fay P.J. Blood. 1997; 90: 3943-3950Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), indicating the presence of a salt bridge at the site of cross-linking. However, treatment of factor VIII with EDC prior to cleavage by thrombin showed no linkage between the subunits, suggesting that the interdomain salt bridge was not present in the unactivated form. In addition, examination of binding of the apolar probe bisanilinonapthalsulfonic acid to isolated factor VIII and factor VIIIa subunits revealed two exposed hydrophobic sites on the isolated HC (33Sudhakar K. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 23015-23021Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) possessing affinities (K d values) of 0.21 and 1.4 μm. However, these sites contrast the single sites localized to the isolated A1 subunit (0.77 μm) and A2 subunit (0.11 μm), suggesting a change in conformation in and around these regions following thrombin cleavage. Finally, CD studies suggest an increase in β-sheet structure in factor VIIIa formed from factor VIII (34Curtis J.E. Helgerson S.L. Parker E.T. Lollar P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6246-6251Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Little evidence exists for a specific conformational change in and around the factor IXa-interactive site in A2 after cofactor activation. Suggestive evidence comes from observations of the inactivation of factor VIII and factor VIIIa by activated protein C. In collaboration with Walker, we showed that the bovine protease binds the cofactor near the COOH-terminal region of the A3 domain in the light chain (35Walker F.J. Scandella D. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 1484-1489Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and preferentially attacks Arg-562 (21Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) within the factor IXa-interactive site. Interestingly, the rate of cleavage at this site in factor VIIIa is ∼5-fold faster than its cleavage in factor VIII (21Fay P.J. Smudzin T.M. Walker F.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 20139-20145Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In factor VIIIa, this site is protected from cleavage by factor IXa (36Regan L.M. Lamphear B.J. Huggins C.F. Walker F.J. Fay P.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 9445-9452Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). However, no factor IXa-dependent protection was observed using factor VIII (37O'Brien D.P. Johnson D. Byfield P. Tuddenham E.G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2805-2812Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar). These results are compatible with differential exposure of the scissile bond at Arg-562 in the two substrates, with this region partially masked in the unactivated form. Taken together with the results of this study, these observations suggest that the factor IXa site localized to residues 558–565 in the A2 subunit is not fully formed in the contiguous A1-A2 domains of uncleaved HC. This lack of a functional factor IXa site in HC likely represents a primary requirement for cofactor activation at this domain junction and provides an explanation for the molecular basis of severe hemophilia attributed to cleavage-resistant mutations at Arg-372.

FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar). Molecular cloning has revealed a family of closely related proteins that can be subdivided on the basis of certain structural and biochemical similarities: the Ca2+-dependent or conventional isoforms (PKCα, -βI, -βII, and -γ), the Ca2+-independent or novel isoforms (PKCδ, -ε, -η, and -θ), the atypical isoforms (PKCλ and PKCζ,), and finally PKCμ, which seems to take an intermediate position between the novel and atypical PKC isoforms (2Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). These isozymes show subtle differences in their regional distribution, subcellular localization, and enzymological characteristics and, therefore, may underlie diverse physiological functions (2Way K.J.

A role of PKCγ in spinal nociceptive processing has been proposed on the basis of the observation that persistent inflammation induces an up-regulation of PKCγ in the rat spinal cord associated with enhanced nociceptive responses (6Martin W.J. Liu H. Wang H. Malmberg A.B. Basbaum A.I. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar). Recently knockout mice with PKCγ gene deletion have been developed successfully by homologous recombination (7Abeliovich A. Chen C. Goda Y. Sliva A.J. Stevens C.F. Tonegawa S. Cell. 1993; 75: 1253-1262Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar). These knockout mice allow a direct assessment of PKCγ-dependent physiological and pharmacological responses. Malmberg et al. (8Malmberg A.B. Chen C. Tonegawa S. Basbaum A.I.

Khachaturian H. Lewis M.E. Akil H. Watson S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). At the spinal level, μ-opioid receptors are concentrated in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn and mediate analgesia/antinociception (14Aicher S.A. Sharma S. Cheng P.Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. Pickel V.M. Synapse. 2000; 36: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We reported previously that PKC in the spinal cord is implicated in the development of spinal antinociceptive tolerance to μ-opioid receptor agonists in mice (15Narita M. Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 280: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Narita M. Ohsawa M. Mizoguchi H. Kamei J. Tseng L.F. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of PKC inhibits the opioid-induced G-protein activation in the mouse spinal cord (17Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 310: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Chronic treatment with the μ-opioid receptor agonist morphine causes an increase in PKCγ immunoreactivity in the spinal cord of rats associated with the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine (18Mao J. Price D.D. Phillips L.L. Lu J. Mayer D.J. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), indicating that PKCγ may modulate the functionality of μ-opioid receptors. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mice with a deletion of the gene that encodes the neuronal-specific PKCγ isoform exhibit any changes in two spinal μ-opioid receptor-mediated functions, namely antinociception and activation of G-proteins.DISCUSSIONPKC is an integral part of the cell signaling machinery (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 2Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Biochemical and molecular cloning analysis has revealed that similar to most other signaling proteins, the enzyme comprises a large family with multiple isoforms exhibiting individual characteristics and distinct patterns of tissue distribution (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 2Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol.

Neurol. 1990; 299: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Malmberg et al. (8Malmberg A.B. Chen C. Tonegawa S. Basbaum A.I. Science. 1997; 278: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) using both wild-type and PKCγ knockout mice that PKCγ-IR is localized predominantly in laminae II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. A few PKCγ-positive somata and cell processes were detected in the lamina III, which is consistent with the findings reported by Martin et al. (6Martin W.J. Liu H. Wang H. Malmberg A.B. Basbaum A.I. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and Polgaret al. (5Polgar E. Fowler J.H. McGill M.M. Todd A.J. Brain Res. 1999; 833: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast, μ-opioid receptor-IR was found to be dense in the laminae I and II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. It should be noted that the pattern of spinal distribution of μ-opioid receptor-IR in PKCγ knockout mice was qualitatively similar to that observed in the wild-type mice. Furthermore, PKCγ-IR in the μ-opioid receptor knockout mice was detected clearly in the same areas that contain PKCγ-IR of the wild-type mice. 2M. Narita, H. Mizoguchi, M. Narita, N. J. Dun, I. Sora, F. S. Hall, G. R. Uhl, H. Nagase, T. Suzuki, and L. F. Tseng, unpublished data. These data suggest that there is no genetic cross-talk to produce individual mRNA and protein between μ-opioid receptor and PKCγ isoform in the spinal cord. This contention is supported by the present RT-PCR study in which mRNA production of μ-opioid receptors was not changed significantly in PKCγ knockout mice compared with the wild-type mice.We have reported previously that i.t. pretreatment with the selective, potent, and membrane-permeable PKC inhibitor calphostin C enhances the antinociception induced by i.t. administration of opioid receptor agonists (15Narita M. Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 280: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of PKC by phorbol esters attenuates either the antinociceptive effect (16Narita M. Ohsawa M. Mizoguchi H. Kamei J. Tseng L.F. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or the G-protein activation induced by opioids (17Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 310: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). More recently, disruption of the phospholipase Cβ3 gene in mice has been shown to enhance sensitivity to behavioral and cellular responses to μ-opioids (27Xie W. Samoriski G.M. McLaughlin J.P. Romoser V.A. Smrcka A. Hinkle P.M. Bidlack J.M. Gross R.A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10385-10390Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that activation of phospholipase Cβ3 by μ-opioids may lead to a concomitant activation of PKC, subsequent phosphorylation, and internalization of μ-opioid receptors.Here we report for the first time that μ-opioid receptor-mediated activation of G-proteins in the spinal cord is enhanced in PKCγ knockout mice. The greater efficacy of μ-opioid receptor-mediated signal transduction in PKCγ knockout mice implies that this isoform may suppress the μ-opioid receptor-dependent actions in the spinal cord. In conjunction with enhanced G-protein activation, functional deletion of the PKCγ gene resulted in a marked potentiation of the spinal antinociceptive effect of μ opioids. Although the enhanced antinociception induced by i.t.-administered μ agonist may involve a complex signaling pathway, our biochemical evidence supports the interpretation that the enhanced μ agonist-induced antinociception in PKCγ knockout mice results, at least in part, from an up-regulation of the μ-opioid receptors.The present observation of increased maximal binding sites for μ-opioid receptor ligands in PKCγ knockout mice is of considerable interest in light of little or no change in mRNA levels of μ-opioid receptors in PKCγ knockout mice relative to the wild-type mice. Viewed in this context, the increase in μ-ligand binding sites in spinal membranes from PKCγ knockout mice may reflect an increase in functional membrane-bound μ-opioid receptors, which are effectively coupled to G-proteins.The μ-opioid receptor contains several potential phosphorylation sites (9Chen Y. Mestek A. Liu J. Hurley J.A. Yu L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 8-12PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kaufman D.L. Keith Jr., D.E. Anton B. Tian J. Magendzo K. Newman D. Tran T.H. Lee D.S. Wen C. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Evans C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15877-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activated PKC has been shown to phosphorylate the opioid receptor directly and subsequently induce its internalization (28Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our result raises the possibility that the protection of functional μ-opioid receptors from phosphorylation and/or internalization by the deletion of PKCγ may contribute to an increase in membrane-bound functional μ-opioid receptors.In view of the cloning studies of those receptors possessing the phosphorylation sites for PKC (29Yasuda H.

Moisand C. Chalon P. Caput D. Vassart G. Meunier J.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), the apparent lack of effects in the deletion of PKCγ gene with respect to the δ- and κ-opioidergic and ORL-1 systems was unexpected. These observations suggest that various G-protein-coupled receptors are affected differentially by the loss of the PKCγ and that the remaining PKC isoforms provide sufficient kinase activity to regulate δ, κ, and ORL-1 receptors.In summary, our analysis of PKCγ knockout mice supports the notion that the loss of the PKCγ gene may protect the functional μ-opioid receptors from degradation in the spinal cord, leading to an enhancement of the spinal μ-opioidergic system to activate G-protein and produce antinociception. The present data provide direct evidence for the critical role of PKCγ in the negative modulatory pathway for spinal μ-opioidergic systems.

Khachaturian H. Lewis M.E. Akil H. Watson S.J. Trends Neurosci. 1988; 11: 308-314Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1074) Google Scholar). At the spinal level, μ-opioid receptors are concentrated in the superficial layers of the dorsal horn and mediate analgesia/antinociception (14Aicher S.A. Sharma S. Cheng P.Y. Liu-Chen L.Y. Pickel V.M. Synapse. 2000; 36: 12-20Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). We reported previously that PKC in the spinal cord is implicated in the development of spinal antinociceptive tolerance to μ-opioid receptor agonists in mice (15Narita M. Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 280: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 16Narita M. Ohsawa M. Mizoguchi H. Kamei J. Tseng L.F. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activation of PKC inhibits the opioid-induced G-protein activation in the mouse spinal cord (17Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 310: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Chronic treatment with the μ-opioid receptor agonist morphine causes an increase in PKCγ immunoreactivity in the spinal cord of rats associated with the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine (18Mao J. Price D.D. Phillips L.L. Lu J. Mayer D.J. Brain Res. 1995; 677: 257-267Crossref PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar), indicating that PKCγ may modulate the functionality of μ-opioid receptors. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether mice with a deletion of the gene that encodes the neuronal-specific PKCγ isoform exhibit any changes in two spinal μ-opioid receptor-mediated functions, namely antinociception and activation of G-proteins. DISCUSSIONPKC is an integral part of the cell signaling machinery (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 2Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 2000; 21: 181-187Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar). Biochemical and molecular cloning analysis has revealed that similar to most other signaling proteins, the enzyme comprises a large family with multiple isoforms exhibiting individual characteristics and distinct patterns of tissue distribution (1Nishizuka Y. FASEB J. 1995; 9: 484-496Crossref PubMed Scopus (2352) Google Scholar, 2Way K.J. Chou E. King G.L. Trends Pharmacol.

Neurol. 1990; 299: 167-177Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar) and Malmberg et al. (8Malmberg A.B. Chen C. Tonegawa S. Basbaum A.I. Science. 1997; 278: 279-283Crossref PubMed Scopus (582) Google Scholar) using both wild-type and PKCγ knockout mice that PKCγ-IR is localized predominantly in laminae II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. A few PKCγ-positive somata and cell processes were detected in the lamina III, which is consistent with the findings reported by Martin et al. (6Martin W.J. Liu H. Wang H. Malmberg A.B. Basbaum A.I. Neuroscience. 1999; 88: 1267-1274Crossref PubMed Scopus (116) Google Scholar) and Polgaret al. (5Polgar E. Fowler J.H. McGill M.M. Todd A.J. Brain Res. 1999; 833: 71-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (154) Google Scholar). In contrast, μ-opioid receptor-IR was found to be dense in the laminae I and II of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. It should be noted that the pattern of spinal distribution of μ-opioid receptor-IR in PKCγ knockout mice was qualitatively similar to that observed in the wild-type mice. Furthermore, PKCγ-IR in the μ-opioid receptor knockout mice was detected clearly in the same areas that contain PKCγ-IR of the wild-type mice. 2M. Narita, H. Mizoguchi, M. Narita, N. J. Dun, I. Sora, F. S. Hall, G. R. Uhl, H. Nagase, T. Suzuki, and L. F. Tseng, unpublished data. These data suggest that there is no genetic cross-talk to produce individual mRNA and protein between μ-opioid receptor and PKCγ isoform in the spinal cord. This contention is supported by the present RT-PCR study in which mRNA production of μ-opioid receptors was not changed significantly in PKCγ knockout mice compared with the wild-type mice.We have reported previously that i.t. pretreatment with the selective, potent, and membrane-permeable PKC inhibitor calphostin C enhances the antinociception induced by i.t. administration of opioid receptor agonists (15Narita M. Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1995; 280: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). In contrast, activation of PKC by phorbol esters attenuates either the antinociceptive effect (16Narita M. Ohsawa M. Mizoguchi H. Kamei J. Tseng L.F. Neuroscience. 1997; 76: 291-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar) or the G-protein activation induced by opioids (17Narita M. Mizoguchi H. Tseng L.F. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 310: R1-R3Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). More recently, disruption of the phospholipase Cβ3 gene in mice has been shown to enhance sensitivity to behavioral and cellular responses to μ-opioids (27Xie W. Samoriski G.M. McLaughlin J.P. Romoser V.A. Smrcka A. Hinkle P.M. Bidlack J.M. Gross R.A. Jiang H. Wu D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10385-10390Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that activation of phospholipase Cβ3 by μ-opioids may lead to a concomitant activation of PKC, subsequent phosphorylation, and internalization of μ-opioid receptors.Here we report for the first time that μ-opioid receptor-mediated activation of G-proteins in the spinal cord is enhanced in PKCγ knockout mice. The greater efficacy of μ-opioid receptor-mediated signal transduction in PKCγ knockout mice implies that this isoform may suppress the μ-opioid receptor-dependent actions in the spinal cord. In conjunction with enhanced G-protein activation, functional deletion of the PKCγ gene resulted in a marked potentiation of the spinal antinociceptive effect of μ opioids. Although the enhanced antinociception induced by i.t.-administered μ agonist may involve a complex signaling pathway, our biochemical evidence supports the interpretation that the enhanced μ agonist-induced antinociception in PKCγ knockout mice results, at least in part, from an up-regulation of the μ-opioid receptors.The present observation of increased maximal binding sites for μ-opioid receptor ligands in PKCγ knockout mice is of considerable interest in light of little or no change in mRNA levels of μ-opioid receptors in PKCγ knockout mice relative to the wild-type mice. Viewed in this context, the increase in μ-ligand binding sites in spinal membranes from PKCγ knockout mice may reflect an increase in functional membrane-bound μ-opioid receptors, which are effectively coupled to G-proteins.The μ-opioid receptor contains several potential phosphorylation sites (9Chen Y. Mestek A. Liu J. Hurley J.A. Yu L. Mol. Pharmacol. 1993; 44: 8-12PubMed Google Scholar, 12Kaufman D.L. Keith Jr., D.E. Anton B. Tian J. Magendzo K. Newman D. Tran T.H. Lee D.S. Wen C. Xia Y.R. Lusis A.J. Evans C.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 15877-15883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). Furthermore, activated PKC has been shown to phosphorylate the opioid receptor directly and subsequently induce its internalization (28Pei G. Kieffer B.L. Lefkowitz R.J. Freedman N.J. Mol. Pharmacol. 1995; 48: 173-177PubMed Google Scholar). Taken together, our result raises the possibility that the protection of functional μ-opioid receptors from phosphorylation and/or internalization by the deletion of PKCγ may contribute to an increase in membrane-bound functional μ-opioid receptors.In view of the cloning studies of those receptors possessing the phosphorylation sites for PKC (29Yasuda H.

Moisand C. Chalon P. Caput D. Vassart G. Meunier J.C. FEBS Lett. 1994; 341: 33-38Crossref PubMed Scopus (1009) Google Scholar), the apparent lack of effects in the deletion of PKCγ gene with respect to the δ- and κ-opioidergic and ORL-1 systems was unexpected. These observations suggest that various G-protein-coupled receptors are affected differentially by the loss of the PKCγ and that the remaining PKC isoforms provide sufficient kinase activity to regulate δ, κ, and ORL-1 receptors.In summary, our analysis of PKCγ knockout mice supports the notion that the loss of the PKCγ gene may protect the functional μ-opioid receptors from degradation in the spinal cord, leading to an enhancement of the spinal μ-opioidergic system to activate G-protein and produce antinociception. The present data provide direct evidence for the critical role of PKCγ in the negative modulatory pathway for spinal μ-opioidergic systems.

https://openalex.org/W1969371473,"The current view of DNA replication in eukaryotes predicts that DNA polymerase α (pol α)-primase synthesizes the first 10-ribonucleotide-long RNA primer on the leading strand and at the beginning of each Okazaki fragment on the lagging strand. Subsequently, pol α elongates such an RNA primer by incorporating about 20 deoxynucleotides. pol α displays a low processivity and, because of the lack of an intrinsic or associated 3′→ 5′ exonuclease activity, it is more error-prone than other replicative pols. Synthesis of the RNA/DNA primer catalyzed by pol α-primase is a critical step in the initiation of DNA synthesis, but little is known about the role of the DNA replication accessory proteins in its regulation. In this paper we provide evidences that the single-stranded DNA-binding protein, replication protein A (RP-A), acts as an auxiliary factor for pol α playing a dual role: (i) it stabilizes the pol α/primer complex, thus acting as a pol clamp; and (ii) it significantly reduces the misincorporation efficiency by pol α. Based on these results, we propose a hypothetical model in which RP-A is involved in the regulation of the early events of DNA synthesis by acting as a “fidelity clamp” for pol α.

DNA polymerases α/δ/ε proliferating cell nuclear antigen replication protein A single-stranded The highly conserved DNA polymerase (pol)1 α-primase complex is the only eukaryotic polymerase able to initiate DNA synthesisde novo, making it of central importance in DNA replication. In fact, it is required both for the initiation of DNA replication at chromosomal origins and for the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand of the replication fork (1Bambara R.A. Murante R.S. Henricksen L.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 4647-4650Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar, 2Henricksen L.A. Bambara R.A. Leuk.

The current view of DNA replication in eukaryotes predicts that pol α-primase synthesizes the first RNA/DNA primer on the leading strand. Then, at a critical length of 30 nucleotides, replication factor C binds to the 3′-OH end of the nascent DNA strand and displaces pol α, thereby loading PCNA and pol δ. pol α-primase switches activity to initiate the synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand (4Waga S. Stillman B. Nature. 1994; 369: 207-212Crossref PubMed Scopus (497) Google Scholar, 5Maga G. Stucki M. Spadari S. Hubscher U. J. Mol.

Biol. 2000; 295: 803-814Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). pol α-primase has to synthesize short RNA/DNA primers. Thus, its intrinsic low processivity is compatible with its function. However, the switch between primase and polymerase activity, leading to the RNA-to-DNA synthesis transition, occurs through an intramolecular mechanism that does not require dissociation of pol α from the primer (7Copeland W. Wang T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 26179-26189Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, it would be important to ensure stable binding of pol α to the template until completion of the RNA/DNA primer synthesis. In addition, the lack of any intrinsic proofreading function for pol α could lead to misincorporation events during RNA/DNA primer synthesis. The critical roles of the pol α-primase make it a likely target for mechanisms that control DNA synthesis initiation and progression (8Nasheuer H. Moore A. Wahl A. Wang T. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7893-7903Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). In particular, a mechanism ensuring a transient but stable binding of pol α to the primer and increasing its fidelity could represent an advantage for the cell. The eukaryotic ssDNA-binding protein RP-A is a heterotrimer consisting of three subunits of 70, 32, and 14 kDa (p70, p32, and p14, respectively) (9Hübscher U. Maga G. Podust V.N. DePamphelis M.L.

In particular, mutagenesis studies have begun to reveal different functions of p70, p32, and p14 in DNA replication. All three subunits are required to support DNA replicationin vitro. The p70 subunit contains three functionally distinct domains: an N-terminal domain, a central ssDNA-binding domain, and a C-terminal subunit interaction domain (31Jacobs D.M. Lipton A.S. Isern N.G. Daughdrill G.W. Lowry D.F. Gomes X. Wold M.S. J. Biomol. NMR. 1999; 14: 321-331Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). The N-terminal domain contains the interaction domain for pol α-primase, which consists of two distinct regions: one (amino acids 1–170) that stimulates pol α synthetic activity and another (amino acids 170–327) that increases pol α processivity. This latter region overlaps with the ssDNA-binding domain (amino acids 168–450); such an activity was shown to be required for pol α processivity stimulation by RP-A (19Braun K.A. Lao Y. He Z. Ingles C.J. Wold M.S. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 8443-8454Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). The p32 subunit interacts with XPA and large T-antigen and is phosphorylated in a cell cycle-dependent manner (32Treuner K. Findeisen M. Strausfeld U. Knippers R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 15556-15561Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar). UV-cross-linking studies with photoreactive primer-templates mapped both p70 and p32 close to the 3′-OH primer end (33Lavrik O.I. Kolpashchikov D.M. Nasheuer H.P. Weisshart K. Favre A.

The pattern of p70 and p32 labeling was also found to be dependent on the template length and the ratio of RP-A to template concentration. These studies suggested that a series of conformational changes occurs after RP-A binding to ssDNA. Indeed, at least two different modes of RP-A binding to DNA have been detected: one covering 8–10 nucleotides and another with a more extended configuration of 30 nucleotides (37Blackwell L.J.

These structurally distinct complexes have been proposed to have different subunits rearrangements. Very recently, it has further been demonstrated that RP-A, along with the DNA replication protein Cdc45p, is involved in the recruitment of pol α-primase at the chromosomal DNA replication origins (41Walter J. Newport J. Mol Cell. 2000; 5: 617-627Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar, 42Zou L. Stillman B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2000; 20: 3086-3096Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar). Thus, both pol α-primase and RP-A are simultaneously present and likely to interact physically during initiation of DNA replication. This makes RP-A a likely candidate for the regulation of the catalytic activity of pol α-primase. In the present work, we have investigated the in vitro role of RP-A on the DNA synthetic activity of pol α using different DNA templates. The results obtained indicated that RP-A could assist pol α in two ways: (i) by increasing the stability of the pol/primer complex and (ii) by reducing the overall misincorporation rate of pol α. [3H]dTTP (40 Ci/mmol) and [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech; unlabeled dNTPs, poly(dA), and oligo(dT)12–18, d24-mer, and d66-mer oligodeoxynucleotides were from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. Activated calf thymus DNA was prepared as described (54Weiser T. Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Ferrari E. Hafkemeyer P. Hübscher U. J. Biol.

All other reagents were of analytical grade and were purchased from Merck or Fluka. The singly primed d24:d66-mer was prepared by labeling the 5′-end of the d24-mer primer with [γ-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase (Ambion) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The d66-mer template oligonucleotide was then mixed with the complementary labeled d24-mer primer oligonucleotide in a 1:1 molar ratio in 20 mmTris-HCl (pH 8.0) containing 20 mm KCl and 1 mmEDTA, heated at 90 °C for 5 min, and then incubated at 65 °C for 2 h and slowly cooled at room temperature. The sequence of the d66-mer oligonucleotide was: 5′-AGGATGTATGTTTAGTAGGTACATAACTATCTATTGATACAGACCTAAAACAAAAAATTTTCCGAG-3′. The sequence of the d24-mer oligonucleotide was: 5′-CTCGGAAAATTTTTTGTTTTAGGT-3′. Calf thymus pol α was purified as described (54Weiser T. Gassmann M. Thömmes P. Ferrari E. Hafkemeyer P. Hübscher U.

The pol α used in this study was 250 units/ml (0.2 mg/ml). 1 unit of pol activity corresponds to the incorporation of 1 nmol of total dTMP into acid-precipitable material for 60 min at 37 °C in a standard assay containing 0.5 μg (nucleotides) of poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10:1 and 20 μm dTTP. Recombinant human RP-A was isolated as described (55Henricksen L.A. Umbricht C.B. Wold M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11121-11132Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). pol α activity on poly(dA)/oligo(dT)10:1 was assayed in a final volume of 25 μl containing 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mmMgCl2, and 5 μm [3H]dTTP (5 Ci/mmol), unless otherwise indicated in the figure legends. All reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C unless otherwise stated, and the DNA was precipitated with 10% trichloroacetic acid. Insoluble radioactive material was determined as described (56Hübscher U. Kornberg A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6284-6288Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). When the singly primed d24:d66-mer oligodeoxynucleotide was used as template, a final volume of 25 μl contained 50 mmTris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, and 10 μm each [3H]dATP (5 Ci/mmol), dGTP, dCTP, and [3H]dTTP (5 Ci/mmol). Enzymes and proteins were added as indicated in the figure legends. All reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C unless otherwise stated and stopped by the addition of 0.1 m EDTA and 1 μg of calf thymus DNA as carrier. 20 μl of the reaction mixture were then spotted onto DE-81 cellulose filters. Filters were washed to remove unincorporated dNTPs as described (57Focher F. Verri A. Maga G. Spadari S. Hubscher U. FEBS Lett. 1990; 259: 349-352Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar), and incorporated radioactivity was monitored by scintillation counting. For incorporation studies with the singly primed d24:d66-mer oligodeoxynucleotide as template, a final volume of 10 μl contained 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 0.25 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 6 mm MgCl2, and 20 nm (3′-OH ends) of the 5′ 32P-labeled d24:d66-mer DNA template. Enzymes, proteins, and unlabeled dNTPs were added as indicated in the figure legends. All reactions were incubated for 15 min at 37 °C, samples were mixed with denaturing gel loading buffer (95% v/v formamide, 10 mm EDTA, 0.25 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 0.25 mg/ml xylene cyanol), heated at 95 °C for 5 min, and then subjected to electrophoresis on a 7 m urea, 20% polyacrylamide gel. Quantification of the reaction products on the gel was performed using a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager and ImageQuant software. Km, Vmax, and [RP-A]50 values were calculated according to the Michaelis-Menten equation in the form, ν=kcatE01+Km[S]Equation 1 where kcat E0 =Vmax. The Ki values for incorrect dNTPs were determined from inhibition assays with increasing concentrations of the selected dNTP in the presence of different fixed amounts of RP-A and were calculated according to a simple competitive mechanism of inhibition as described by the equation,ν=kcatE01+Km[S]1+[I]KiEquation 2 Computer fitting of the experimental data to the equations was performed with the program MacCurveFitTM 1.5 using the least squares curve-fitting quasi-Newton method, based on the Davidon-Fletcher-Powell algorithm (59Fletcher R. Practical Methods of Optimization. 1. Wiley, New York1980Google Scholar). When data points were derived from densitometric analysis of the intensities of the products bands, the values of integrated gel band intensities in dependence of the nucleotide substrate concentrations were fitted to the equation (58Creighton S. Bloom L.B. Goodman M.F. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 262: 232-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (226) Google Scholar),I*T/IT−1=Vmax[dNTP]/(Km+[dNTP])Equation 3 where, T = target site, the template position of interest; and I*T = the sum of the integrated intensities at positions T,T+1 … T+n. Before being inserted in the above equation, the intensities of the single bands of interest were first normalized by dividing for the total intensity of the lane. This was done to reduce the variability because of manual gel loading. An empty portion of the gel was scanned, and the resulting value was subtracted as background. The goodness of the interpolated curve was assessed by computer-aided calculation of the sum of squares of errors and the correlation coefficient R 2. Standard errors were provided by the computer program MacCurveFitTM 1.5. The standard errors are calculated from the variance-covariance matrix, and the values displayed are the square roots of the diagonal elements. The variance-covariance matrix is calculated from the Jacobian matrix (59Fletcher R. Practical Methods of Optimization. 1. Wiley, New York1980Google Scholar). Different concentrations of RP-A were tested for their effect on nucleotide incorporation catalyzed by pol α on different DNA templates (Fig. 1). RP-A was able to stimulate pol α activity on either homo- or heteropolymeric deoxyoligonucleotides, within a range of concentrations close to the 3′-OH primer concentration used in the assay (Fig.1 A). Variation of the 3′-OH primer concentration resulted in a shift of the RP-A concentration giving the maximal stimulation, which was observed at equimolar amounts of RP-A to 3′-OH primer (Fig.1 B, arrows). To investigate the effects of RP-A on the nucleotide incorporation reaction catalyzed by pol α, increasing concentrations of 3′-OH primer were tested in the presence of different fixed amounts of RP-A. As shown in Fig. 2 A, theKm value of pol α for the 3′-OH primer was decreased by increasing concentrations of RP-A. TheVmax/Km ratio, which is an estimate of the association rate for the pol α·3′-OH primer complex formation, was also increased by RP-A (Fig. 2 B). A comparison of the variation of the reaction velocity in dependence of the 3′-OH primer concentration (Fig. 2 C) with the observed decrease of Km values in dependence of RP-A concentration (Fig. 2 D) showed that [RP-A]50, the RP-A concentration giving half of the maximal decrease, was 41 nm, a value very close to the Km of pol α for the 3′-OH primer, which is 39 nm. Next, the effect of RP-A on the ability of pol α to incorporate a wrong nucleotide was tested. It is known that the misincorporation efficiency of a pol is influenced by the nature of the mismatch resulting from the misalignment of the template-encoded base and the incoming nucleotide (43Mendelman L.V. Boosalis M.S. Petruska J. Goodman M.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 14415-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus, to directly compare the effects of RP-A on the ability of pol α to incorporate a wrong nucleotide, the homopolymeric substrate poly(dA)/oligo(dT) was used, which contains only adenines as template. As shown in Fig. 3 A, the incorporation of radioactively labeled dTTP catalyzed by pol α on such a template can be inhibited by the addition of unlabeled dNTPs as competitors. Each individual dNTP inhibited the reaction with different potencies, as indicated by the different Ki values (Table I). The calculatedKi values and theKi/Km ratios, which are an estimate of the accuracy of nucleotide incorporation by pol α, are listed in Table I. pol α discriminates 330-fold against the C-A mismatch, but only 60-fold against the A-A and 30-fold against the G-A misincorporations, respectively. Thus, pol α showed different misincorporation efficiencies for the resulting mismatches, in the order G-A > (i.e. more efficiently generated) A-A > C-A. When similar experiments were performed in the presence of RP-A, the misincorporation efficiencies for the G-A and A-A mismatches were reduced to about the level observed for the C-A misincorporation (see below and Table I).Table IEffect of RP-A on the inhibition by different dNTPs of dTTP incorporation catalyzed by pol α on poly(dA)/oligo(dT)SubstrateCompetitor−RP-A+RP-AReduction of misincorporation 1-aCalculated as the ratio (Ki/Km)+RP-A/(Ki/Km)−RP-A.KmKiKi/KmKmKiKi/Kmμmμm-folddTTP10.411.5dCTP3440 1-bAll of the values for the kinetic constants were calculated by computer simulation as described under “Materials and Methods.” Standard deviations (±S.D.) were in all cases ≤±10%.

Open table in a new tab Fig. 3 Bshows the effect of different amounts of RP-A on the inhibition by dGTP of dTTP incorporation catalyzed by pol α on poly(dA)/oligo(dT). The plot of the increase in the Ki value of dGTPversus RP-A concentration showed a typical saturation kinetics (Fig. 3 C), with a half-maximal stimulatory RP-A concentration (or [RP-A]50) of 47 nm, very close to the value observed for the 3′-OH primer binding stimulation (Fig. 2 D). Maximal increase of the Kivalues for dGTP inhibition was observed at RP-A concentrations close to the concentration of 3′-OH. Similar results were obtained when dATP inhibition was tested (data not shown). Because the template sequence was known, it was possible to force pol α to make specific mismatches by adding the appropriate combinations of nucleotides in a reaction mixture. Fig. 4shows the products of a reaction containing the heteropolymeric deoxyoligonucleotide resolved by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The addition of different combinations of nucleotides generated strong pausing sites at the positions immediately preceding the mismatch, suggesting that incorporation of a wrong nucleotide was rate-limiting with respect to the elongation of a mismatched primer. For example, in the presence of the first encoded nucleotide, dCTP, a strong signal was detected at position +1 (lane 2), whereas the addition of the first two nucleotides, dCTP and dTTP, resulted in the generation of a strong band at position +2 (lane 3). Significant misincorporation products were detected with all of the combinations used (lanes 2-4), confirming the relatively low fidelity of pol α in DNA synthesis. The same reactions were performed in the presence of RP-A (Fig. 4, lanes 5-8). The first observation was that RP-A stimulated the correct incorporation of nucleotides by pol α as judged by the increasing intensities of the bands corresponding to complementary nucleotide incorporation (Fig. 4, compare positions 0, +1, and +2 in lanes 2–4 with the same positions inlanes 5–8). In particular, the band at position 0 decreased significantly; this was expected, because RP-A imposed a block to misincorporation, which forced pol α to elongate mainly the d24-mer primer to a d25-mer product but did not allow further elongation because of the lack of the complementary correct nucleotides required. The intensities of the bands were quantified by densitometric analysis, and the relative amounts of synthesized products at each position along the template were calculated as described in the figure legend, both in the absence and in the presence of RP-A. As shown in Fig.5, with the different combinations of nucleotides tested, RP-A significantly decreased the amount of products generated by elongation of a mismatched primer by pol α, thereby increasing the accumulation of products at the position immediately preceding the misincorporation site (compare panel A withB in Fig. 5). To investigate more closely the mechanism by which RP-A decreases the misincorporation efficiency of pol α, a detailed kinetic analysis of correct versus incorrect single nucleotide incorporation was performed. Reactions were carried out as shown in Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 6, respectively, but in the presence of different concentrations of dCTP. Quantification of the products at position +1 (C-G base pair) and +2 (C-A mismatch) at each nucleotide concentration allowed the calculation of theKm and Vmax values for the correct and incorrect incorporation reactions, as well as the specificity constant Vmax/Km. The computed values are listed in TableII. RP-A specifically decreased both the affinity and the reaction velocity for the misincorporation reactions, whereas it only slightly stimulated the correct nucleotide incorporation (∼2-fold increase in theVmax/Km value). A comparison of the ratio between the Vmax and theKm values for correct and incorrect nucleotide incorporation in the absence and the presence of RP-A showed that pol α alone discriminated ∼540-fold against the C-A mismatch, a value comparable with the one derived with poly(dA)/oligo(dT) (Table I). This value was increased to more than 3300-fold by the addition of RP-A, thus reducing the misincorporation more than 6-fold (Table II).Table IIEffect of RP-A on the kinetic parameters for correct (C-G) versus incorrect (C-A) single nucleotide incorporation by pol α−RP-A+RP-ACorrect (C-G)Incorrect (C-A)Correct (C-G)Incorrect (C-A)Km(μm)9.3 (±2)2-aAll of the values for the kinetic constants were calculated by computer simulation as described under “Materials and Methods.” Standard deviations (±S.D.) are indicated.

A major component of the angiogenic response are the changes that occur in endothelial cell interactions with the extracellular matrix as well as changes in cell-cell interactions. Endothelial cells are linked to each other by tight- and adherens-type junctions and are linked to the extracellular matrix by a variety of integrin and other adhesion molecules (22Mitic L.L.

Both receptors possess insert sequences within their catalytic domains and seven immunoglobulin-like domains in the extracellular regions and are related to the platelet-derived growth factor family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Although expression of both VEGF receptor types occurs in adult endothelial cells, including human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVE) cells, recent findings suggest that KDR, and not Flt-1, is able to mediate the mitogenic and chemotactic effects of VEGF in endothelial cells (36Keyt B.

The key targets that mediate the diverse biological functions of VEGF in endothelial cells remain incompletely understood for either VEGF receptor. Somewhat varying results as to the downstream effects for the VEGF receptors have been obtained. VEGF stimulates the tyrosine phosphorylation of phospholipase Cγ, MAPK, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, FAK, and paxillin in HUVE cells and of phospholipase Cγ, p120GAP, and NCK in bovine aortic endothelial cells (37Abedi H.

In porcine aortic endothelial cells transfected with KDR and Flt-1, VEGF has no effect on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity and only a weak effect on p120GAP tyrosine phosphorylation (39Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The goal of this study was to clarify the signaling mechanism by which VEGF stimulates endothelial cell migration. As there is compelling evidence that the assembly and disassembly of focal adhesions play a key role in the mechanism by which several extracellular stimuli regulate both cell morphology and movement (40Gilmore A.P.

Chem. 1997; 272: 15442-15451Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (418) Google Scholar), we took the strategy of exploring the cell signaling proteins that couple VEGF binding to its receptors with focal adhesion assembly. Our results demonstrate that the SH2 domain-containing signaling protein NCK and the p21 GTPase-activated serine/threonine kinase PAK play necessary roles in this signaling pathway. HUVE cells were isolated as previously reported (43Jaffe E.A. Nachman R.L. Becker C.G. Minidi C.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1973; 52: 2745-2756Crossref PubMed Scopus (6012) Google Scholar). Passage 2 cells were cultured on 0.2% gelatin-coated tissue culture plates in medium 199 containing 20% newborn calf serum, 5% human serum, and 7.5 μg/ml endothelial growth factor (Sigma). The rabbit anti-KDR antibody was isolated in our laboratory and targets a polypeptide domain within the KDR cytosolic domain (44Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). Anti-NCK, anti-CRK, anti-FAK, and anti-phosphotyrosine (PY20) monoclonal antibodies were from Transduction Laboratories. Anti-FAK and anti-PAK polyclonal antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. Peroxidase-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit and sheep anti-mouse immunoglobulins were from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. HUVE cells were grown on 10-cm dishes until subconfluent. The cells were incubated in serum-free DMEM with 1 mm Na3VO4 for 1 h at either 4 or 37 °C; VEGF (50 ng/ml) was then added for either 4 h at 4 °C or 0–30 min at 37 °C. Cells were lysed in lysis buffer (10 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 50 mm NaCl, 0.2 mm Na3VO4, 30 mmNa4P2O7, 30 mm NaF, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mg/ml leupeptin, 0.7 mg/ml pepstatin A, and 1% Triton X-100), and primary antibodies were added to the lysates. After a 1-h incubation at 4 °C, the antibodies were immobilized on protein A-Sepharose beads (Sigma), and the beads were washed three times with lysis buffer and boiled in 40 μl of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample loading buffer. Proteins were separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to nitrocellulose (Bio-Rad), and blotted with appropriate antibodies. The filters were then blocked in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.2% Tween plus 5% dry milk at 4 °C overnight and probed with specific antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the filter was incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG, and reactions were visualized through enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL,Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). For substitution of tyrosine residues with phenylalanine, site-directed mutagenesis was carried out on KDR cDNA using the U.S.E. mutagenesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The following oligonucleotides were used for mutagenesis: 5′-TTGCTCCAACGAAGTCTTTCCCT-3′ (Y951F), 5′-GGAAGTCCTTAAACAGATCTTCA-3′ (Y996F), 5′-TTACCCCGAGGAATGGAGAAGCA-3′ (Y1106F), 5′-CTGGTGTAGTTTTATCAGGGGCC-3′ (Y1130F), and 5′-GAAGAACAATGAAGTCTTTGCCA-3′ (Y1175F). All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing. The resulting vectors were transfected into HEK293 cells, and stable transfectants were selected and expanded as previously described (44Dougher M. Terman B.I. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 1619-1627Crossref PubMed Scopus (164) Google Scholar). HUVE cells were grown on 10-cm dishes until subconfluent. Cells were treated with VEGF (50 ng/ml) for 15 min at 37 °C. After one wash with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, cells were scraped from the dish and lysed in lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitation with anti-PAK antibodies was performed as described above. The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with lysis buffer and three times with kinase buffer (50 mm HEPES (pH 7.3), 50 mm KCl, 10 mm β-glycerophosphate, 10 mm MgCl2, 5 mm NaF, 2 mm MnCl2, and 0.05% Triton X-100). Kinase reactions were carried out for 20 min at 30 °C with 0.25 mg/ml myelin basic protein as a substrate, 10 μm ATP, and 1 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in 30 μl of kinase buffer. The reaction was stopped by addition of 0.5 volume of gel loading buffer and heating at 100 °C for 5 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and radioactively labeled proteins were identified by autoradiography of dried gels. Oligonucleotides were 19-mer 2′-O-methyl oligoribonucleoside phosphorothioates (Oligos Etc., Wilsonville, OR). The oligonucleotides were targeted against the NCK translation initiation site (codons 2–7). The sequences of the oligonucleotides were as follows: antisense NCK, 5′-CTACCACCACTTCTTCTGC; and sense NCK (control), 5′-GATGGTGGTGAAGAAGACG. HUVE cells were grown until 50% confluent. Oligonucleotides and LipofectAMINE reagent (Life Technologies, Inc.) (oligonucleotide/LipofectAMINE ratio of 1:5) were incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Cells were washed with serum-free medium 199, and oligonucleotide-LipofectAMINE complexes were added directly to the cells, with a final oligonucleotide concentration of 0.4 nm/ml. After a 4-h incubation at 37 °C, an equal volume of complete medium containing a 2-fold excess of oligonucleotides was added. Experiments were typically performed 3 days later. HUVE cells were plated on 4- or 8-well Permanox plastic chamber slides coated with 0.2% gelatin and grown until 50% confluent. Transfection by antisense oligonucleotides was performed as described above, and cells were incubated in the presence of oligonucleotides for 3 days. Cells were fixed in 3.5% formaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 min at room temperature, and nonspecific binding was blocked with Hanks' solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin and 10% goat serum for 1 h at room temperature. Anti-FAK (1 μg/ml) or anti-PAK (10 μg/ml) antibodies were added and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were washed three times with Hanks' solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, followed by a 1-h incubation with Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse or fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, Inc.). After washing three times with Hanks' solution containing 1% bovine serum albumin, cells were viewed under a Nikon fluorescent microscope. The migration assay utilized a modified Boyden chamber and was performed essentially as previously described (45McCarty J.H. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HUVE cells were grown to 50% confluency and then mock-transfected or transfected with sense or antisense oligonucleotides as described above. Three days later, the cells were lifted from the dish using nonenzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma), centrifuged for 2 min at 1000 rpm, and resuspended in medium 199 containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin. The cells were then plated on fibronectin-precoated Transwells (Costar Corp.) at a density of 105 cells/well. Medium 199 with VEGF (10 ng/ml) was used as a chemoattractant in the lower wells. Cell migration assays were performed for 8 h at 37 °C in a CO2 incubator. Cells that had migrated trough the Transwells were stained with CMFDA dye (Sigma) and counted under a fluorescent microscope. Four different fields were counted for each experiment, and all samples were performed in triplicate. It was previously shown that NCK tyrosine phosphorylation and the amount of NCK present in anti-KDR immunoprecipitates are increased in VEGF-treated bovine aortic endothelial cells and KDR-transfected porcine aortic endothelial cells (38Guo D. Jia Q. Song H.-Y. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 6729-6733Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (415) Google Scholar, 39Waltenberger J. Claesson-Welsh L. Siegbahn A. Shibuya M. Heldin C.-H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 26988-26995Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The experimental data shown in Fig. 1 (A and B) demonstrate that similar results were obtained using HUVE cells. NCK is a member of a family of cell proteins that lack enzymatic activity and that participate in cell signaling by acting as adaptor proteins (45McCarty J.H. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 913-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 C demonstrates that VEGF treatment of HUVE cells enhanced the tyrosine phosphorylation of another adaptor protein, CRK. The 42-kDa isoform (CRKII), but not 28-kDa CRKI, was detected in the anti-KDR immunoprecipitates after VEGF treatment, even though both isoforms are expressed in these cells. Experiments were performed to determine if the interaction of NCK and CRK with VEGF-activated KDR is direct or mediated through another protein. The strategy was to express receptor protein in which specific tyrosines had been mutated to phenylalanine in HEK293 cells (which do not express endogenous KDR) and test for VEGF-induced NCK and CRK tyrosine phosphorylation. As there is currently only a limited amount of information on the identity of the KDR autophosphorylation sites (46Dougher-Vermazen M. Hulmes J.D. Bohlen P. Terman B.I. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1994; 205: 728-738Crossref PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar, 47Wu L.W. Mayo L.D. Dunbar J.D. Kessler K.M. Ozes O.N. Warren R.S. Donner D.B. J. Biol.

J. 2000; 347: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), the tyrosines that were targeted for mutagenesis were chosen based upon whether their adjacent amino acid sequences conformed to a consensus-binding site (pYDE(P/D/V)) for the NCK SH2 domain (49Sonyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J.

Waterfield M.D. Protein Eng. 1995; 8: 527-533Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Seven separate cell lines were established. These are denoted KDR, KDR(Y938F), KDR(Y951F), KDR(Y1106F), KDR(Y1130F), KDR(Y1175F), and KDR(Y1305F). Fig. 2 A shows the KDR expression level for some of the generated cell lines; similar expression levels were observed for KDR(Y1130F) (data not shown). VEGF treatment led to both KDR autophosphorylation (Fig. 2 B) and an increased amount of NCK and CRK in anti-Tyr(P) immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2, C and D) in cells expressing native KDR as well as KDR(Y938F), KDR(Y951F), KDR(Y1130F), and KDR(Y1175F). A similar effect was seen for KDR(Y1106F) and KDR(Y1130F) (data not shown). VEGF also increased the amount of NCK in anti-KDR immunoprecipitates for KDR(Y951F), KDR(Y1130F), and KDR(Y1175F) (Fig. 3 A) and each of the other cell lines expressing a mutant KDR (data not shown).Figure 3VEGF-induced NCK and SHC activation in HEK293 cells expressing native and mutant KDRs. The experiments were done exactly as described for Fig. 2 (B–D), except that immunoprecipitation (IP) was with anti-KDR (A andB) or anti-Tyr(P) (PTyr) (C) antibodies, and immunoblotting (IB) was done with anti-NCK (A) or anti-SHC (C) antibodies. The blot shown inA was reprobed with the anti-KDR antibody (B) to ensure that equal amounts of the immunoprecipitates were loaded for the control and VEGF-treated samples. Results identical to those shown in each panel were observed in three separate experiments.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) To validate the experimental strategy, we also examined VEGF-induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation in the various cell lines because there is evidence that this signaling protein interacts directly with KDR at tyrosine 1175 (48Warner A.J. Lopez-Dee J. Knight E.L. Feramisco J.R. Prigent S.A. Biochem. J. 2000; 347: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar). SHC was immunoprecipitated by the anti-Tyr(P) antibody from VEGF-treated cell extracts expressing native KDR and each of the mutant KDR-expressing cell lines except KDR(Y1175F) (Fig.3 B shows the results for KDR, KDR(Y1130F), and KDR(Y1175F)). The experimental result examining VEGF-induced SHC tyrosine phosphorylation in the various cell lines strengthens confidence in the overall approach, and it was concluded that neither NCK nor CRK binds to KDR at the tyrosines targeted by mutagenesis. Since none of the KDR tyrosines that were not targeted by mutagenesis contain an NCK- or CRK-interacting consensus sequence, we conclude that NCK and CRK interact with the receptor through a protein intermediate or bind directly to KDR at a previously not recognized sequence. We then examined whether PAK participates in VEGF-induced signal transduction by acting downstream from NCK. Western blot analysis demonstrated the presence of PAK in anti-NCK immunoprecipitates (Fig.4 A), but not anti-CRK immunoprecipitates (data not shown), isolated from HUVE cell extracts. The anti-PAK antibody recognizes at least three PAK isoforms (α-PAK (PAK1), β-PAK (PAK3), and γ-PAK (PAK2)), and multiple isoforms were detected after immunoprecipitation with NCK antiserum. VEGF had no effect on the amount of PAK associated with NCK (Fig. 4 A); this conclusion was confirmed by a complementary experiment in which cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with the anti-PAK antibody, and Western blotting was performed with the anti-NCK antibody (Fig.4 B). These results indicate that PAK is bound to NCK, even in the absence of growth factor. Experiments were then done to determine the consequence of VEGF treatment on the enzymatic activity of PAK. HUVE cells were treated with or without VEGF, and anti-PAK immunoprecipitates were prepared from cell lysates. PAK activity was measured by monitoring the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein using [γ-32P]ATP, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and autoradiography. As shown in Fig.5 A, the phosphorylation of myelin basic protein was significantly increased in samples from VEGF-treated compared with untreated cells. 32P labeling of one other protein (60 kDa) was enhanced in anti-PAK immunoprecipitates prepared from the VEGF-treated samples (Fig. 5 A). Proteins of 60 and 90 kDa were observed upon blotting anti-PAK immunoprecipitates with the anti-Tyr(P) antibody (Fig. 5 B). The identities of the 90- and 60-kDa proteins are not known, and neither is the tyrosine kinase responsible for their phosphorylation. It was previously shown that the expression of a constitutively active PAK leads to recruitment of the recombinant protein to focal adhesions (51Sells M.A. Knaus U.G. Bagrodia S. Ambrose D.M. Bokoch G.M. Chernoff J. Curr. Biol. 1997; 7: 202-210Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (579) Google Scholar, 52Manser E. Huang H.-Y. Loo T.-H. Chen X.-Q. Dong J.-M. Leung T. Lim L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 1129-1143Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We therefore tested whether this is also the case for VEGF-activated PAK. In the absence of VEGF, immunofluorescent staining with the anti-PAK antibody (Fig.6 C) revealed no focal adhesion-like structures. Focal adhesions, as observed using anti-FAK (Fig. 6 A) or anti-Tyr(P) (data not shown) antibodies, were present in these cells, but they were ∼25% the size of those seen in the presence of VEGF (Fig. 6 B). Within 15 min of VEGF treatment, PAK staining (Fig. 6 D) was identical to the staining with the anti-FAK or anti-Tyr(P) antibody, demonstrating the recruitment of PAK to focal adhesions. Both the KDR and Flt-1 VEGF receptor subtypes are express by HUVE cells. Although it was previously demonstrated that VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration is mediated by KDR and not Flt-1 (36Keyt B. Nguyen H. Berleau L. Buarte C. Park J. Chen H. Ferrara N. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 5638-5646Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), it cannot be ruled out that Flt-1 does not participate in the effects of VEGF on PAK activation and focal adhesion assembly. To address this issue, we asked whether PlGF treatment of HUVE cells leads to focal adhesion assembly. The rationale for this experiment was that PlGF, which shares 50% amino acid homology with VEGF, binds to Flt-1, but not KDR. The results shown in Fig. 7demonstrate that immunofluorescent staining of PlGF-treated cells (Fig.7 B) using the anti-FAK antibody was identical to that observed for"

The three-dimensional structure of several S100 proteins revealed that the proteins form non-covalent dimers. However, the mechanism of the S100 dimerization is still obscure. In this study we characterized the dimerization of S100A4 (also named Mts1) in vitro andin vivo. Analytical ultracentrifugation revealed that apoS100A4 was present in solution as a mixture of monomers and dimers in a rapidly reversible equilibrium (Kd = 4 ± 2 μm). The binding of calcium promoted dimerization. Replacement of Tyr-75 by Phe resulted in the stabilization of the dimer. Helix IV is known to form the major part of the dimerization interface in homologous S100 proteins. By using the yeast two-hybrid system we showed that only a few residues of helix IV, namely Phe-72, Tyr-75, Phe-78, and Leu-79, are essential for dimerization in vivo. A homology model demonstrated that these residues form a hydrophobic cluster on helix IV. Their role is to stabilize the structure of individual subunits rather than provide specific interactions across the dimerization surface. Our mutation data showed that the specificity at the dimerization surface is not particularly stringent, which is consistent with recent data indicating that S100 proteins can form heterodimers.

They are involved in mediating a wide range of biological processes, including cell division and differentiation, cytoskeleton organization, and cell motility (1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A.

Upon binding of calcium these proteins undergo conformational changes resulting in exposure of hydrophobic regions on their surface, which allows interaction with target molecules (4Matsumura H.

Acta. 1999; 1450: 191-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (599) Google Scholar), whereas covalently linked dimers were shown to have extracellular functions (1Zimmer D.B. Cornwall E.H. Landar A. Song W.

These studies revealed a unique antiparallel homodimeric fold, which was not found in other calcium-binding proteins. The major part of the dimer interface is formed by helices IV and IV′ of the S100 subunits and is stabilized by contacts between helices I and I′. S100A4, 1According to the new nomenclature the Mts1 protein is named S100A4 (see Schäfer et al. (53Schäfer B.W. Wicki R. Engelkamp D. Mattei M.-G. Heizmann C.W. Genomics. 1995; 25: 638-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar)). a member of the S100 family, is believed to be directly involved in the control of tumor metastasis (16Ambartsumian N.

Barraclough R. Oncogene. 1996; 13: 1631-1637PubMed Google Scholar). However, the precise mechanism of its action is not known. It interacts with cytoskeletal proteins including tropomyosin (18Takenaga K. Nakamura Y. Sakiyama S. Hasegawa Y. Sato K. Endo H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 757-768Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar) and the heavy chain of non-muscle myosin (19Kriajevska M.V. Cardenas M.N. Grigorian M.S. Ambartsumian N.S. Georgiev G.P.

We have previously shown that S100A4 inhibits phosphorylation of myosin by protein kinase C (21Kriajevska M. Tarabykina S. Bronstein I. Maitland N. Lomonosov M. Hansen K. Georgiev G. Lukanidin E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 9852-9856Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) and by CK2 (22Kriajevska M. Bronstein I. Scott D.J. Tarabykina S. Fisher-Larsen M. Issinger O.G. Lukanidin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar) and causes depolymerization of myosin filaments in vitro (22Kriajevska M. Bronstein I. Scott D.J. Tarabykina S. Fisher-Larsen M. Issinger O.G. Lukanidin E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2000; 1498: 252-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar), thereby possibly modulating the motility of metastatic tumor cells. Recently, we have applied the yeast two-hybrid system as an in vivo approach to search for new S100A4 interacting partners. The screening of a mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cDNA library revealed homodimerization of S100A4 as well as its interaction with another member of the S100 family, S100A1 (23Tarabykina S. Kriajevska M. Scott D.J. Hill T.J. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Dodson G.G. Lukanidin E. Bronstein I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). Interestingly, mutational analysis revealed that Cys-76 and, perhaps, Cys-81 of S100A4 are important for its interaction with S100A1 but not for the S100A4 homodimerization, suggesting that the mechanisms of homo- and heterodimerization of the S100 proteins could be different. The present study addressed the issue of the S100A4 dimerization, both in vitro and in vivo. The obtained data showed that in solution the S100A4 protein exists in a monomer-dimer equilibrium that is influenced by the binding of calcium. It has been suggested that the S100 dimerization plays an essential role in specific target recognition. This hypothesis was supported by the three-dimensional structures of S100A10 (7Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H. Case D.A. Chazin W.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1995; 2: 790-796Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar) and S100A11 (8Kilby P.M. Van Eldik L.J. Roberts G.C. Structure. 1996; 4: 1041-1052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (119) Google Scholar), which revealed that these proteins bind their target peptides via both the hinge and C-terminal regions of one subunit and the N-terminal region of another subunit. The NMR structure of the complex of S100B with a p53 fragment showed that whereas the general location of the binding site is similar to the one of S100A10 and S100A11, the N-terminal residues do not take part in target binding (24Rustandi R.R. Baldisseri D.M. Weber D.J. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 570-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (292) Google Scholar). To date, very little is known about how the S100 dimers form in living cells. Here, we used the yeast two-hybrid approach to study the structural basis of the S100 dimerization in vivo. Since the three-dimensional structure of S100A4 is not yet established, we have applied molecular modeling based on the available structures of the S100 proteins (4Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar, 12Réty S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) to interpret the results of mutational analysis. We have identified the amino acid residues crucial for the S100 dimerization in vivo and in vitro. These residues are highly conserved among the S100 proteins, and therefore our results may have implications for other members of the S100 family in general. The Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain YRG2 (Matα ura3-52 his3-200 ade2-101 lys2-801 trp1-901 leu2-3 112 gal4-542 gal80-538LYS2::UASGAL1-TATAGAL1-HIS3 URA3::UASGAL4- TATACYC1-lacZ) (Stratagene) was used for all assays. Yeast cultures were grown at 30 °C in either YPD medium (2% peptone, 1% yeast extract, 2% glucose) or SD minimal medium (0.67% nitrogen base, 18.2%d-sorbitol, 2% glucose) supplemented with amino acids. The open reading frame of mouse mts1 was cloned in-frame with either the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD)2 or the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain (AD) in the yeast expression vectors pBD-GAL4 and pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene), respectively. The p271 plasmid containing the mts1 cDNA (25Ebralidze A. Tulchinsky E. Grigorian M. Afanasyeva A. Senin V. Lukanidin E. Genes Dev. 1989; 3: 1086-1092Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar) was digested withNcoI, flushed with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, and then digested with SalI. The pAD-GAL4 and pBD-GAL4 plasmids were cut with EcoRI, flushed with the Klenow polymerase, digested with SalI, and ligated with themts1 insert. The resulting constructs named pADMts1 and pBDMts1, respectively, were verified by dideoxy chain termination sequencing (26Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52770) Google Scholar). Expression of fusion proteins in yeast was confirmed by Western blotting with a polyclonal anti-S100A4 antibody. Transformation was performed using the YRG-2 Yeast Competent Cell kit (Stratagene) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Yeast transformed with both pBDMts1 and pADMts1 were plated onto SD agar plates lacking Trp and Leu and grown for 3–4 days at 30 °C. Single colonies were streaked onto either a selective SD agar plate lacking Trp, Leu, and His or on a nitrocellulose membrane (Hybond-C, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) placed on an SD agar plate without Leu and Trp and incubated for 3 or 1 day, respectively, at 30 °C. The filter β-galactosidase assay was performed according to the manual of Stratagene (HybriZAP Two-hybrid Vector Kit). The time required for color development ranged from 1 h to overnight. All mutations were introduced by PCR using either the pBDMts1 or the pADMts1 plasmid as a template. The sequences of the primers used for the S100A4 mutagenesis are given in the Supplemental Material. PCR amplification was performed using a 10:1 AmpliTaq (PerkinElmer Life Sciences)/PfuI (Stratagene) polymerase mixture. PCR products were eluted from an agarose gel, flushed with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I, phosphorylated with T4 polynucleotide kinase, and self-ligated. The open reading frames of the plasmids were verified by sequencing. For expression of the His6-tagged wild type and mutant S100A4 proteins inEscherichia coli M15, the T5 RNA polymerase promoter-based expression vector pQE30 (Qiagen) was used. Proteins were purified as described (23Tarabykina S. Kriajevska M. Scott D.J. Hill T.J. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Dodson G.G. Lukanidin E. Bronstein I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). The non-fusion S100A4 protein was expressed inSpodoptera frugiperda insect cells using a baculovirus expression system. The S100A4 cDNA was cloned into the pVL1393 vector. The plasmid was co-transfected into insect cells along with the BaculoGold-linearized viral DNA (PharMingen). The obtained recombinant virus was amplified and used for protein expression. The insect cells were lysed in the buffer containing 25 mm HEPES (pH 7.5), 130 mm NaCl, 1 mm EGTA, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40. The lysate was concentrated on an Amicon membrane (UM10) and subjected to gel filtration chromatography on a Superdex 75 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mm NaCl. Protein fractions containing the S100A4 protein were further purified on a 1-ml Resource Q column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The bound protein was eluted in Tris-HCl buffer with a NaCl gradient. Mass spectrometry measurements were made using an FTICR mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) equipped with a shielded 9.4T super-conducting magnet (Magnex Scientific Ltd., Abingdon, UK), a cylindrical “infinity” ICR cell with diameter d = 0.06 m, and an external ESI source (Analytica, Branford, CT), as has been described previously (27Heck A.J.R. Derrick P.J. Anal. Chem. 1997; 69: 3603-3607Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar, 28Lavanant H. Derrick P. Heck A. Mellon F. Anal. Biochem. 1998; 255: 74-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The ESI source was equipped with a capillary made of Pyrex and coated on both ends with nickel. The background pressure in the ICR analyzer cell was usually below 2 × 10−10 mbar. Solutions of S100A4 (15 μm) in 5 mm ammonium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) were sprayed at room temperature. Carbon dioxide was used as a drying gas in the electrospray source. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were carried out using a Beckman XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge (Beckman Instruments, Palo Alto, CA) with an AN60 Ti 4-hole rotor. Protein solutions in the presence or absence of 1 mm calcium were loaded into ultracentrifuge cells containing Epon six channel centerpieces with 12-mm path lengths and quartz windows. The loading concentrations of the wild type S100A4 or mutant proteins were 11, 7, and 5 μm. Samples were centrifuged to equilibrium at 10,000, 15,000, 22,000, 28,000, and 36,000 rpm at 20 °C, a process that typically took around 10–12 h. Absorbance traces at 280 nm taken 4 h apart were compared to ensure that equilibrium had been attained at each speed, and this was ascertained by the lack of systematic deviation across each cell for the difference scans. Data were excised from the traces using the software supplied with the ultracentrifuge. The data were then globally fit either to a single species fit as shown in Equation 1, ctotal=cmonomer,rfexpω22RTM(1−ν¯ρ)r2−rf2(Eq. 1) or to a self-associating dimerization model shown in Equation2, ctotal=cmonomer,rfexpω22RTM(1−ν¯ρ)r2−rf2+Kcmonomer,rf2expω2RTM(1−ν¯ρ)r2−rf2Equation 2 where K is the association constant; c is the concentration; r is the radial position;rf is the radial reference position; M is the molar mass of the smallest detectable species; ν is the partial specific volume; ρ is the solvent density; ω is the angular velocity; R is the universal gas constant, and Tis the thermodynamic temperature. Best fit parameters were obtained by non-linear least squares regression using the program NONLIN (29Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorsen H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were carried out using Epon 2-channel centerpieces. The set speed was 40,000 rpm, and scans were obtained at 230 nm every 5 min. Loading concentrations were 22, 11, and 5 μm, respectively. The extinction coefficient at 230 nm was calculated from a wavelength scan at a fixed radial position at 3000 rpm from the ratio of absorbance at 280 and 230 nm. The heterogeneity of the solution was analyzed using the method of van Holde and Weischet (30van Holde K.E. Weischet W.O. Biopolymers. 1978; 17: 1387-1403Crossref Scopus (318) Google Scholar, 31Demeler B.H. Saber J.C. Hansen J.C. Biophys. J. 1997; 72: 397-407Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). For single sedimenting species molar masses and sedimentation coefficients were obtained using a direct fit of the Lamm equation (Equation 3) using the program SedFit (32Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1503-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar), ∂c∂t=1∂r∂rrD∂c∂r−csω2r(Eq. 3) where c is the weight concentration; r is the radial position; t is the time from beginning of sedimentation; D is the diffusion coefficient, ands is the sedimentation coefficient. The molar mass can be obtained via the Svedberg equation (Equation 4), sD=M(1−ν¯ρ)RT(Eq. 4) This program was also used to fit the reaction boundary of a monomer/dimer-interacting system (32Schuck P. Biophys. J. 1998; 75: 1503-1512Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (311) Google Scholar). Sedimentation coefficient distributions were obtained using the maximum entropy method of Schuck (33Schuck P. Biophys. J. 2000; 78: 1606-1619Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (3089) Google Scholar). Frictional coefficients were obtained by setting f/f0 to an initial value of 1.0, to obtain the sedimentation distribution, and then letting it float in a subsequent fitting routine. Robustness of the distributions was ascertained by 1000 runs of a Monte Carlo distribution. From this, the 68 and 95% confidence limits were obtained. The solvent density and partial specific volume of S100A4 was determined by the method of Laue et al. (34Laue T.M. Shah B.D. Rideway T.M. Pelletier S.L. Harding S.E. Rowe A.J. Horton J.C. Analytical Ultracentrifugation in Biochemistry and Polymer Science.in: Royal Society of Chemistry, Cambridge, UK1992Google Scholar) using the program SEDNTERP and was found to be 1.01233 and 0.7248 ml g−1, respectively. Two crystal structures of bovine holoS100B at 2.0-Å resolution (4Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1MHO and Swiss-Prot code S10B_BOVIN) and human S100A10 at 2.3-Å resolution in a holo-mimicking conformation (12Réty S. Sopkova J. Renouard M. Osterloh D. Gerke V. Tabaries S. Russo-Marie F. Lewit-Bentley A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1999; 6: 89-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (261) Google Scholar) (Protein Data Bank code 1A4P and Swiss-Prot code S110_HUMAN) were selected as structural templates. The coordinates for the biologically active non-covalent dimers were generated from the appropriate Protein Data Bank files using crystallographic symmetry operators. Except for the link region both dimeric structures were remarkably similar. Although the sequence identity was only 40% upon structural overlap, 96% of the overlapped residues showed the main chain r.m.s.d. below 3 Å. Moreover, the r.m.s.d. between two homodimers was 1.4 Å on all Cα atoms, but only 0.7 Å on helices I, I′, IV, and IV′, which constitute the major part of the dimerization surface. The sequence identity between S100A4 (Swiss-Prot code S104_MOUSE) and the template sequences S10B_BOVIN and S110_HUMAN is 47 and 35%, respectively. The sequence alignment, based on the structural overlap of both templates and the target S100A4 sequence (Fig. 1) was constructed within the QUANTA molecular modeling software (MSI, San Diego, CA). The two excess residues in the N terminus and 10 residues in the C terminus were removed leaving only amino acids 3–92 of S100A4 for homology modeling. Due to major structural differences between the template structures in the link regions correlating with the lack of strong sequence homology between target and template sequences, each of the link regions of two S100A4 subunits was aligned to a different template. Homology modeling was performed using the MODELER module (35S̆ali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) within the QUANTA molecular modeling software (MSI, San Diego, CA). Ten independent models were generated. The models converged very well as measured by an average r.m.s.d. from the mean structure (calculated on all Cα atoms) of 0.3 Å. A model with the lowest objective energy function (35S̆ali A. Blundell T.L. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 779-815Crossref PubMed Scopus (10636) Google Scholar) was then energy minimized after placing four calcium ions into positions analogous to the 1MHO template. Unconstrained energy minimization was performed using the united atom and explicit polar hydrogen topology and the parameter sets TOPH19 and PARAM19 (36Brooks B.R. Bruccoleri R.E. Olafson B.D.

Phys. 1996; 105: 1902-1921Crossref Scopus (1112) Google Scholar) within the X-PLOR software (38Brünger A.T. A System for X-ray Crystallography and NMR , X-PLOR, Version 3.1. Yale University Press, New Haven1992Google Scholar). Multiple sequence alignment and sequence similarity analysis of 54 S100 proteins were performed using the PILEUP and PLOTSIMILARITY programs within Wisconsin Package version 9.1 (GCG, Madison, WI). We have recently shown by yeast two-hybrid screening of a mouse adenocarcinoma cDNA library that S100A4 forms homodimers and heterodimers with S100A1, and we confirmed this result by ESI-FTICR mass spectrometry and analytical ultracentrifugation (23Tarabykina S. Kriajevska M. Scott D.J. Hill T.J. Lafitte D. Derrick P.J. Dodson G.G. Lukanidin E. Bronstein I. FEBS Lett. 2000; 475: 187-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar). In the present study we aimed to characterize structural aspects of the S100A4 dimerization bothin vivo and in vitro. The S100A4 cDNA was cloned in-frame with either the GAL4 BD or AD. The fusion proteins were co-expressed in the YRG-2 yeast strain harboring integratedlacZ and HIS3 reporter genes under the control of the GAL4 upstream-activating sequence (UAS). Expression of the fusion proteins in yeast was confirmed by immunoblotting (not shown). Interaction between two hybrid proteins was scored by the ability of the transformed yeast to grow on a selective medium lacking histidine and by β-galactosidase activity. Since the structure of the S100A4 protein is not known, we used the structures of highly homologous S100 proteins to identify amino acid residues important for the S100A4 dimerization in vivo. Our study mainly addressed S100A4 helix IV, which is known to form a large portion of the dimer interface of other S100 proteins (7Potts B.C. Smith J. Akke M. Macke T.J. Okazaki K. Hidaka H.

In all available structures the helix IV begins at the residue corresponding to Phe-72 of S100A4 and can be up to 21 residues long, particularly for the holoproteins (4Matsumura H. Shiba T. Inoue T. Harada S. Kai Y. Structure. 1998; 6: 233-241Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (104) Google Scholar). Four groups of the S100A4 mutant proteins fused to GAL4 BD and in some cases also with GAL4 AD were expressed in yeast: (i) long C-terminal deletions; (ii) single and double amino acid deletions; (iii) simultaneous substitutions of several amino acid residues; and (iv) single amino acid substitutions. All the mutant proteins were tested for interaction with wild type S100A4 or with the identical mutant proteins. The region of the S100A4 protein essential for dimerization was identified by deleting portions of the C terminus (TableI). Analysis of theHIS3 and lacZ phenotype of the transfected yeast revealed that only ΔC1 and ΔC6 proteins, which span deletions between residues 81 and 90, can form dimers efficiently. Thus, residues 72–80 contain all the helix IV residues essential for dimerization.Table IMapping of the S100A4 region essential for dimerizationYeast transformed with the GAL4 DNA binding domain (BD) and transcriptional activation domain (AD) hybrid constructs were first grown on SD medium without Trp and Leu (selection for the plasmids) and then streaked onto a SD agar plate lacking histidine or on a nitrocellulose membrane.

Substitutions at several positions (Q73A, Y75F, C76S, V77G, F78L, S80K, and C81K) were found not to have any effect on the S100A4 dimerization (Table II). Since Y75F, C76S, and F78L can be regarded as conservative mutations, the contribution of positions 75, 76, and 78 to dimerization cannot be ruled out by this experiment, whereas positions 73, 77, 80, and 81 seem to be not important for dimerization.

https://openalex.org/W2011232618,"Trax (Translin-associated factor X) has been shown to interact with TB-RBP/Translin by its coimmunoprecipitation and in yeast two-hybrid assays. Here we demonstrate that Trax is widely expressed, does not bind to DNA or RNA, but forms heterodimers with TB-RBP under reducing conditions. The heterodimer of TB-RBP and Trax inhibits TB-RBP binding to RNA, but enhances TB-RBP binding to specific single stranded DNA sequences. The in vitro interactions between TB-RBP and Trax are confirmed by similar interactions in the yeast two-hybrid system. Cell fractionation and confocal microscope studies reveal that Trax is predominantly cytoplasmic. In contrast, TB-RBP is present in both the nuclei and cytoplasm of transfected cells and uses a highly conserved nuclear export signal to exit nuclei. In addition to a leucine zipper, two basic domains in TB-RBP are essential for RNA binding, but only one of these domains is needed for DNA binding. Trax restores DNA binding to TB-RBP containing an altered form of this domain. These data suggest that Trax-TB·RBP interactions modulate the DNA- and RNA-binding activity of TB-RBP.

The process of mammalian spermatogenesis is highly organized spatially and temporally. Highly controlled transcription and protein expression occur in each developmental stage. During the haploid interval, spermiogenesis, the spermatids become transcriptionally inactive, although there is a need for the synthesis of many proteins essential for the formation of spermatozoa (1Hecht N.B. Bioessays. 1998; 20: 555-561Crossref PubMed Scopus (387) Google Scholar). The sex chromosomes encode numerous genes essential for gametogenesis. Because the spermatids are haploid cells, they contain either the X or Y chromosome. Thus, intercellular transport of mRNA in the haploid cells is a critical process to ensure genetic equivalency.

TB-RBP is the mouse orthologue of human Translin, a single-stranded DNA-binding protein that binds consensus sequence breakpoint junctions of chromosomal translocations in lymphoid malignancies (3Aoki K.

The TB-RBP/Translin consensus binding sequences are also found in TLS-CHOP reciprocal translocations, in therapy-related translocations in acute myeloid leukemias, and in BCR-ABL translocations in chronic myeloid leukemia (4Kanoe H.

Sequence analysis in a meiotic recombination hot spot region of human chromosome 16 shows TB-RBP/Translin binding sequences near the breakpoint (7Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 20: 109-112Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TB-RBP/Translin has also been proposed to act as a single-stranded DNA-binding transcription factor, which activates early response gene expression in the brain (8Taira E. Finkenstadt P.M.

RNA binding of TB-RBP has been observed in brain and testis, and the binding is dependent upon Y and H sequence elements (2Wu X.Q. Gu W. Meng X. Hecht N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Many testis- and brain-specific mRNAs have Y and H consensus sequences, and specific RNA·TB-RBP interactions have been demonstrated for testis mRNAs encoding protamine 1 and 2 and AKAP 82 and in brain for myelin basic protein mRNA, α-calmodulin kinase II mRNA, Tau mRNA, and BC1 RNA (11Wu X.Q.

Translationally suppressed mRNAs are bound to microtubules by TB-RBP in cellular extracts (14Han J.R. Yiu G.K. Hecht N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 9550-9554Crossref PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) and recombinant TB-RBP binds specific mRNAs in vitro to reconstituted microtubules (11Wu X.Q. Hecht N.B. Biol. Reprod. 2000; 62: 720-725Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). The presence of TB-RBP in the cytoplasmic bridges that connect germ cells in a syncytium, together with the association of TB-RBP with transported mRNAs and the cytoskeleton (10Morales C.R. Wu X.Q. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar), suggest that TB-RBP acts as a transport molecule in the testis for mRNAs in intracellular (from nucleus to cytoplasm) and intercellular (between spermatids) mRNA transport. The shift of subcellular localization of TB-RBP in meiotic and post-meiotic mouse germ cells (10Morales C.R. Wu X.Q. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Gu W. Wu X.Q. Meng X.H. Morales C. el-Alfy M. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod.

Res. Commun. 1998; 253: 448-453Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), and the role of TB-RBP for mRNA sorting in dendrites (16Severt W.L. Biber T. Wu X.-Q. Hecht N.B. DeLorenzo R.J. Jakoi E.R. J. Cell Sci. 1999; 112: 3691-3702Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) support this hypothesis. Using Translin as bait in a yeast two-hybrid assay, a protein of unknown function, Translin-associated factor X (Trax), was identified (7Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 20: 109-112Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). TB-RBP/Translin and Trax are encoded by single-copy genes that are evolutionarily conserved. In addition to having highly conserved sequences in mammals, they are also found in frogs (Xenopus laevis), plants (Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa), insects (Drosophila), and yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) (17Devon R.S. Taylor M.S. Millar J.K. Porteous D.J. Mamm. Genome. 2000; 11: 395-398Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar). This extraordinary conservation from yeast to mammals suggests that these molecules play important biological functions. In the adult mouse, TB-RBP mRNA is widely expressed, with its highest levels in testis and brain (15Gu W. Wu X.Q. Meng X.H. Morales C. el-Alfy M. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization of TB-RBP protein is both developmentally and subcellularly regulated during spermatogenesis. During meiosis, the TB-RBP protein primarily localizes in the nuclei of pachytene spermatocytes, whereas in late meiotic prophase and in all subsequent stages of germ cell differentiation, it is in the cytoplasm (10Morales C.R. Wu X.Q. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). TB-RBP/Translin also is predominantly a nuclear protein in malignant lymphoid cell lines but not in nonlymphoid cell lines (3Aoki K. Suzuki K. Sugano T. Tasaka T. Nakahara K. Kuge O. Omori A. Kasai M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Treatment of nonlymphoid cells with DNA-damaging agents was reported to cause a shift of the TB-RBP/Translin from the cytoplasm into nuclei (18Kasai M. Matsuzaki T. Katayanagi K. Omori A. Maziarz R.T. Strominger J.L. Aoki K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11402-11407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). TB-RBP and Trax share a 28% identity at the protein level with a conservation of 38% in the C-terminal regions. Both have putative leucine zipper domains at the C terminus of TB-RBP and in the mid-region of Trax (3Aoki K. Suzuki K. Sugano T. Tasaka T. Nakahara K. Kuge O. Omori A. Kasai M. Nat. Genet. 1995; 10: 167-174Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 7Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 20: 109-112Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). Interaction between TB-RBP and Trax has been demonstrated by coimmunoprecipitation (19Wu X.Q. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Hecht N.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11261-11270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and in the yeast two-hybrid assay (7Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 20: 109-112Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar, 8Taira E. Finkenstadt P.M. Baraban J.M. J. Neurochem. 1998; 71: 471-477Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Yeast two-hybrid and in vitro binding studies indicate that TB-RBP dimers are the minimum unit needed for DNA or RNA binding (20Wu X.Q. Xu L. Hecht N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Unlike TB-RBP (20Wu X.Q. Xu L. Hecht N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar), when Trax is used as bait in the yeast two-hybrid system, it does not select itself, suggesting it does not homodimerize. TB-RBP/Translin contains two putative basic domains in the N-terminal region from amino acids 56 to 64 and from amino acids 86 to 97. Changes in the amino acid sequence in the 86–97 region abolish the DNA-binding activity of Translin (21Aoki K. Suzuki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Analysis of the Trax sequence has suggested it contains a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) (7Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 20: 109-112Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The subcellular localization changes in meiotic and post-meiotic cells (10Morales C.R. Wu X.Q. Hecht N.B. Dev. Biol. 1998; 201: 113-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar, 15Gu W. Wu X.Q. Meng X.H. Morales C. el-Alfy M. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar) and in nonlymphoid cells after DNA damage (18Kasai M. Matsuzaki T. Katayanagi K. Omori A. Maziarz R.T. Strominger J.L. Aoki K. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 11402-11407Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar) indicate a need to shuttle TB-RBP between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Comparison of TB-RBP sequences with known nuclear export signals (NES) suggests the presence of a putative leucine-rich Rev-like NES sequence in its C terminus. Although the Rev-like NES is one of the most commonly described NES (22Henderson B.R. Eleftheriou A. Exp. Cell Res. 2000; 256: 213-224Crossref PubMed Scopus (351) Google Scholar, 23Moroianu J. J. Cell. Biochem. Suppl. 1999; 32–33: 76-83Crossref Google Scholar), none of the Rev-like NES-containing proteins have been shown to interact with cellular mRNAs. To date, little is known of the biological function(s) of Trax. Because heterodimeric partners often modulate the activity of proteins that can homodimerize such as c-Fos/c-Jun (25Zhou X.F. Shen X.Q. Shemshedini L. Mol. Endocrinol. 1999; 13: 276-285Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), we set out to determine whether TB-RBP·Trax heterodimers could alter the nucleic acid recognition properties of TB-RBP. Here we show that Trax alone does not bind to either DNA or RNA, but Trax does form heterodimers with TB-RBP. The heterodimer of TB-RBP and Trax is unable to bind to RNA, but binds to DNA. Thus, the heterodimerization modulates the substrate specificity in a very unique manner. Cell fractionation and transfection studies reveal that most of Trax is in the cytoplasm. TB-RBP appears to use a Rev-like nuclear export signal to exit the nucleus and requires two basic regions in its N terminus in addition to its leucine zipper to bind RNA. A cDNA encoding the complete open reading frame of human Trax was subcloned in-frame with a thioredoxin-6X His-S-peptide N-terminal tag in a pET32a vector (Novagen) and transformed into BL21(DE3) cells. The expressed fusion protein was purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid-agarose column chromatography, and the thioredoxin-6X His tag was removed by thrombin digestion to obtain Trax with an N-terminal S-peptide tag. Total RNA preparations were hybridized with 32P-labeled Trax cDNA under conditions previously described (15Gu W. Wu X.Q. Meng X.H. Morales C. el-Alfy M. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). For Western blotting, tissue extracts were prepared from sexually mature CD-1 male mice using the protocol of Wuet al. (2Wu X.Q. Gu W. Meng X. Hecht N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 27: 5640-5645Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Aliquots (30 μg) of protein were electrophoresed in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and the proteins were transferred onto nylon membranes. The membranes were incubated overnight with TBS containing 5% nonfat dry milk at 4 °C and then incubated with a polyclonal antibody to Trax (1:2000) in TBS containing 0.25% nonfat dry milk for 1 h at RT. After washing, the membranes were incubated with protein A conjugated with horseradish peroxidase, and Trax was detected with the enhanced chemiluminescence protocol of Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. Recombinant mouse TB-RBP (200 ng) was incubated with recombinant human S-peptide-tagged Trax for 30 min at 4 °C in 200 μl of TBS-T (20 mm Tris, pH 7.6, 137 mm NaCl containing 1% Tween 20) or in 200 μl of 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, containing 1.5 mm MgCl2 with or without 5 mmDTT. S-protein-agarose beads (20 μl) were added to the mixture, and the incubation was continued for 30 min at 4 °C with gentle shaking. The mixture was centrifuged for 1 min at 1000 rpm at 4 °C, and the pellet was washed three times with TBS-T (1 ml) interspersed with centrifugation at 1000 rpm. The pellets were boiled in SDS loading buffer for 3 min, and proteins were resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with SYPRO Orange protein dye (Bio-Rad), and the proteins were visualized by fluorescence according to the manufacturer's protocol. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with a DNA probe, Bcl-CL1, or an RNA probe, transcript c, as described previously by Wu et al. (20Wu X.Q. Xu L. Hecht N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). For the RNA gel shifts, the RNA·protein complexes were routinely digested with T1 RNase (1 unit/assay) and incubated with heparin (5 mg/ml). Bcl-CL1 was labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase, whereas transcript c was transcribed from a pGEM 3Z plasmid using SP6 RNA polymerase and [α-32P]CTP. Recombinant proteins were incubated with 40,000 cpm of DNA or RNA probe for 10 min at RT in 20 μl of binding buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 7.6, 3 mm MgCl2, 40 mm KCl, 2 mm DTT, 5% glycerol), and DNA·protein and RNA·protein complexes were detected following electrophoresis in 4% polyacrylamide gels in TBE buffer. All electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed after incubation of TB-RBP and Trax at 10 times the final concentration of the proteins in 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.5) containing 5 mm DTT and 1.5 mmMgCl2 for 30 min followed by 10× dilution of the mixture to reduce the DTT concentration to 0.5 mm. Site-directed mutagenesis of the two basic domains and a putative nuclear export signal of TB-RBP was carried out using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. The wild-type TB-RBP, TB-Nb mutant, and TB-Cb mutant cDNAs were subcloned into a pET28a vector for protein expression in E. coli. Wild type TB-RBP and TB-RBPNES mutant cDNAs were subcloned in-frame to the C terminus of GFP in the pEGFP C2 vector (CLONTECH). We named the fusion proteins from these constructs EGFP-TB-RBP and EGFP-TB-RBPNES, respectively. The Trax cDNA was subcloned into the pEBFP C1 or pDsRed1-N1 vectors, which produce fusion proteins with the blue fluorescence protein at the N terminus of Trax (EBFP-TRAX) or the red fluorescence protein at the C terminus of Trax (TRAX-DsRed), respectively. The Trax cDNA was also cloned into the pEGFP C2 vector. The complete cDNAs of TB-RBP, its mutant alleles, and Trax were subcloned into theEcoRI/SalI sites of pBD-GAL4cam and pAD-GAL4 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Pairs of binding domain and activation domain plasmid constructs were cotransfected into the yeast strain YRG-2. Transformants were selected on SD medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Protein·protein interactions were detected by growth on SD medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine, and by the 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl β-d-galactopyranoside (X-gal) filter lift assay on SD medium lacking leucine and tryptophan. Strength of interaction was determined by the addition of 3-amino-1,2,4-Triazole (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) to the medium at concentrations of 5–100 mm. The transformation and filter lift assay procedures were performed following the manufacturer's instructions (Stratagene). NIH 3T3 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and streptomycin. Cells were transiently transfected with the plasmid constructs described above using FuGENE 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were grown on two-well chamber slides (Lab-Tek) and fixed 18 h post-transfection using 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, washed three times in PBS and mounted using Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Scientific). To determine the extent of Trax expression in various mouse tissues, a Northern blot hybridization was performed with the complete open reading frame of Trax as probe (Fig. 1 A). In the mouse, Trax is present as a single transcript of about 2.5 kb. As previously reported for TB-RBP (15Gu W. Wu X.Q. Meng X.H. Morales C. el-Alfy M. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), brain and testis contain the highest levels of Trax mRNA, whereas heart, kidney, liver, lung, and spleen contain lower amounts of Trax mRNA. These differences are not due to RNA degradation or unequal loading, because hybridization of the blot to a β-actin cDNA reveals similar amounts of undegraded mRNAs on the filter (Fig. 1 B). To determine the protein levels of Trax in mouse tissues, a Western blot was performed using a polyclonal rabbit anti-Trax antibody to detect a protein band of 34 kDa that comigrates with recombinant Trax (Fig. 1 C, lane 8). As seen for the mRNAs, the highest levels of Trax expression are seen in testis and brain. In general, Trax protein levels reflect the Trax mRNA levels, and the level of Trax protein in the mouse tissues examined was similar to the pattern reported for TB-RBP (2Wu X.Q. Gu W. Meng X. Hecht N.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1997; 27: 5640-5645Crossref Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 15Gu W. Wu X.Q. Meng X.H. Morales C. el-Alfy M. Hecht N.B. Mol. Reprod. Dev. 1998; 49: 219-228Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Quantitation of Western blots using recombinant Trax and recombinant TB-RBP as standards revealed TB-RBP to be present at about a 2- to 3-fold molar excess compared with Trax in these tissue extracts (data not shown). To define the subcellular distribution of Trax, Western blot analyses of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts from mouse testis and from NIH 3T3 fibroblasts were performed (Fig. 1 D). In extracts from testis and transfected cells, Trax is predominantly found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 1 D, lanes 1 and 3), although lower levels are seen in the nuclear fractions (Fig.1 D, lanes 2 and 4). Similar results are seen with confocal microscopy (see below). Because Trax coprecipitates with TB-RBP with an affinity-purified antibody to mouse recombinant TB-RBP (19Wu X.Q. Lefrancois S. Morales C.R. Hecht N.B. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 11261-11270Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) and the proteins interact in yeast two-hybrid assays (7Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1997; 20: 109-112Crossref Scopus (89) Google Scholar), we set out to determine the conditions needed for Trax-TB·RBP interactions. An S-peptide-tagged recombinant Trax protein was mixed with recombinant TB-RBP and incubated in a series of buffers. Proteins precipitated with S-protein-agarose beads were then separated on SDS-polyacrylamide gels and stained using a SYPRO-Orange dye (Fig.2). Trax and TB-RBP do not stably interact in buffers such as TBS or HEPES at neutral pH (Fig. 2,lanes 1 and 2). The presence of divalent cations such as Ca2+ or Mg2+ in PBS, TBS, or HEPES buffer also does not facilitate interaction. However, the addition of 5 mm DTT in HEPES buffer induces the proteins to interact at roughly a ratio of 1:1 suggesting a heterodimer, although a larger oligomer may also be formed (Fig. 2, lane 3). The heterodimer is maintained when the DTT level is diluted to 0.5 mm, but prolonged dialysis of the protein mixture against HEPES buffer in the absence of DTT dissociates the heterodimer (data not shown). To determine whether the TB-RBP·Trax interaction alters the nucleic acid binding of TB-RBP, gel shift assays were performed. RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed with transcript c and DNA electrophoretic mobility shifts assays with the single-stranded DNA, Bcl-CL1, two probes previously used to characterize Translin/TB-RBP binding to nucleic acids (20Wu X.Q. Xu L. Hecht N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Although Trax itself does not bind to RNA (Fig. 6, lane 2), the addition of increasing amounts of Trax under conditions where heterodimers are formed leads to about a 75% decrease in RNA binding at approximately a 1:1 ratio of Trax and TB-RBP (Fig.3 A, lane 5). The free RNA in these samples is degraded by the T1 RNase incubation routinely performed for the RNA gel shifts. (Fig. 3, lanes 2–5). In the absence of T1 RNase digestion, the RNA probe remains undegraded (Fig. 6).Figure 3Trax alters nucleic acid binding of TB-RBP.

Severalfold increases in DNA binding are seen at a Trax:TB-RBP ratio of 2:1 (Fig. 3 B, lane 4). A higher level of Trax (4:1) does not elicit any further increase in DNA binding (Fig. 3 B, lane 5). As seen for the RNA binding assay, Trax alone does not bind DNA (Fig. 7, lane 2). To demonstrate that it is the heterodimer of Trax and TB-RBP that is causing changes in TB-RBP binding to RNA and DNA, heterodimers were prepared using thioredoxin-tagged Trax and recombinant TB-RBP. This heterodimer migrates more slowly than either a TB-RBP homodimer or a Trax·TB-RBP heterodimer, because of the additional amino acids at its N terminus. Gel shift assays carried out using this protein nucleic acid complex reveal that it is the heterodimer of Trax and TB-RBP that binds poorly to RNA (Fig.4, lanes 4 and 5) and the heterodimer that binds well to specific single-stranded DNA probes such as Bcl-CL1 (Fig. 4, lanes 9 and10). The TB-RBP protein has been shown to contain a leucine zipper important for DNA and RNA binding (20Wu X.Q. Xu L. Hecht N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 21Aoki K. Suzuki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) and two putative basic domains, one of which has been reported to be essential for DNA binding (21Aoki K. Suzuki K. Ishida R. Kasai M. FEBS Lett. 1999; 443: 363-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar) (Fig. 5). Mutations in the basic domains of TB-RBP were made to analyze the TB-RBP-nucleic acid binding in greater detail and to determine their effect on RNA binding. Using radiolabeled transcript c, recombinant Trax, and recombinant TB-RBP as controls, electrophoretic mobility shift assays were performed to evaluate nucleic acid binding changes caused by altering these two basic domains of TB-RBP. As previously seen, the addition of Trax to TB-RBP reduces TB-RBP RNA binding (Fig.6, compare lane 3 tolane 4). A mutation of the N-basic domain of TB-RBP (TB-Nb) drastically reduces the RNA binding in the absence (Fig. 6, lane 5) or presence of Trax (Fig. 6, lane 6). The protein·RNA complex formed by the TB-Nb mutant also migrates more rapidly than the wild type TB-RBP·RNA complex. A mutation of the C-basic domain of TB-RBP (TB-Cb) leads to the complete abolition of RNA binding (Fig. 6, lane 7). The addition of Trax to the TB-Cb protein does not show any effect on the reduction in RNA binding of TB-Cb (Fig. 6, lane 8). We conclude that both the N-basic and C-basic domains of TB-RBP are essential for RNA binding and the addition of Trax does not substantially alter its RNA interactions with these mutated proteins. DNA gel shift assays were carried out using an α-32P-labeled Bcl-CL1 probe with control recombinant TB-RBP and Trax and with the two TB-RBP proteins with altered basic domains, TB-Nb and TB-Cb (Fig.7). As previously demonstrated, DNA binding of TB-RBP is enhanced by heterodimerization of TB-RBP with Trax (Fig. 7, compare lane 3 to lane 4). The mutation in the N-basic domain of TB-RBP does not appear to affect binding to Bcl-CL1, although a more rapidly migrating DNA·protein complex is seen (Fig. 7, lane 5). Interestingly, when Trax is added to TB-Nb under conditions in which heterodimers are formed, no enhanced DNA binding is seen (Fig. 7, lane 6). The mutation in the second basic domain of TB-RBP, TB-Cb, abolishes DNA binding completely (Fig. 7, lane 7). Surprisingly, the addition of Trax, forming a Trax·TB-Cb heterodimer, restores DNA binding of the TB-Cb mutant (Fig. 7, lane 8). These data suggest that Trax can induce changes in mutant TB-RBP conformation, which influence its binding to DNA. To verify that TB-RBP, TB-Nb, TB-Cb, TB-NES, and Trax interact in vivo, a yeast two-hybrid assay was employed (Fig.8). As previously reported, TB-RBP readily forms homodimers in yeast (20Wu X.Q. Xu L. Hecht N.B. Nucleic Acids Res. 1998; 26: 1675-1680Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) (Fig. 8 A) and heterodimers with Trax (Fig. 8 B) (7Aoki K. Ishida R. Kasai M.

We examined whether TFIIF interacts with RNA polymerase II subunit 5 (RPB5), the exposed domain of which binds transcriptional regulatory factors such as hepatitis B virus X protein and a novel regulatory protein, RPB5-mediating protein. The results demonstrated that RPB5 directly binds RAP30 in vitro using purified recombinant proteins and in vivo in COS1 cells transiently expressing recombinant RAP30 and RPB5. The RAP30-binding region was mapped to the central region (amino acids (aa) 47–120) of RPB5, which partly overlaps the hepatitis B virus X protein-binding region. Although the middle part (aa 101–170) and the N-terminus (aa 1–100) of RAP30 independently bound RPB5, the latter was not involved in the RPB5 binding when RAP30 was present in TFIIF complex. Scanning of the middle part of RAP30 by clustered alanine substitutions and then point alanine substitutions pinpointed two residues critical for the RPB5 binding in in vitro and in vivo assays. Wild type but not mutants Y124A and Q131A of RAP30 coexpressed with FLAG-RAP74 efficiently recovered endogenous RPB5 to the FLAG-RAP74-bound anti-FLAG M2 resin. The recovered endogenous RPB5 is assembled in pol II as demonstrated immunologically. Interestingly, coexpression of the central region of RPB5 and wild type RAP30 inhibited recovery of endogenous pol II to the FLAG-RAP74-bound M2 resin, strongly suggesting that the RAP30-binding region of RPB5 inhibited the association of TFIIF and pol II.

Promoter-specific transcription initiation requires the concerted action of a complex array of factors including the general transcriptional factors TFIID, TFIIA, TFIIB, TFIIE, TFIIF, and TFIIH. Transcriptional activators and repressors bind distal elements of the promoter and modulate transcription by interacting with the components of preinitiation complex (1Ge H. Roeder R.G.

All transcriptional factors and cofactors modulate positively or negatively initiation and/or elongation of mRNA synthesis. Therefore, RNA polymerase subunits may be additional targets for transcriptional regulators, because pol II is the core enzyme of the transcription machinery of gene expression. Several lines of evidence for communication between transcriptional regulators and pol II subunits have accumulated (5Cheong J.H. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S.

RPB1 and RPB2 of pol II are responsible for most of the catalytic activities for RNA synthesis, although the other subunits contribute to the integrity of the supramolecular complex in structure and function. We have previously found that HBx, a multifunctional viral regulator protein of hepatitis B virus, directly interacts with RPB5 (5Cheong J.H. Yi M. Lin Y. Murakami S. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 143-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (241) Google Scholar), and both RPB5 and HBx communicate with TFIIB. The trimeric interaction of these three factors may facilitate transcription and HBx acts as coactivator in activated transcription (7Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 8Lin Y. Tang H. Nomura T. Dorjsuren D. Hayashi N. Wei W. Ohta T. Roeder R. Murakami S. J. Biol.

Based on these observations, we proposed that RPB5 is a communicating subunit of pol II that interacts with transcriptional regulators. In support of the notion, we previously identified a novel protein, RPB5-mediating protein (RMP), which counteracts the coactivator function of HBx by competitively binding RPB5 (6Dorjsuren D. Lin Y. Wei W. Yamashita T. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1998; 18: 7546-7555Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). In yeast, RPB5 is an essential subunit and cannot be complemented by human RPB5. Miyao et al. (16Miyao T. Woychik N.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 15281-15286Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar) reported that yeast RPB5 is important for activated transcription of some genes in yeast. Recently, a backbone model of a 10-subunit yeast RNA polymerase II revealed the relative position of each subunit. RPB5 has two parts, the exposed domain (N-terminal two-thirds) and the embedded domain, the former being a component of the jaw in close proximity to duplex DNA downstream of the active site (17Todone F.

In this context, the exposed domain of RPB5 may be needed to interact with factors for transcription regulation. TFIIF is a unique general transcription factor that functions in initiation, elongation, and probably recycling of transcription (19Roeder R.G. Trends Biochem.

The C-terminus of RAP30 has been demonstrated to contain a cryptic DNA-binding domain, which is suggested to be homologous to the DNA template binding of prokaryotic ς factor (38Tan S. Garrett K.P.

RAP30 has been shown to be necessary for most, if not all, preinitiation complex formation and gene transcription (37Tan S. Conaway R.C. Conaway J.W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Greenblatt J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9463-9466Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). RAP30 has been shown to directly bind pol II (41Killeen M.T. Greenblatt J.F. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 30-37Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), but it remains unclear which subunit of pol II is responsible for the binding with RAP30. Therefore, we examined the possibility that TFIIF interacts with RPB5. Here we show that RPB5 directly binds to the middle part of RAP30 (aa 101–170) in the presence of RAP74. The residues Tyr124and Gln131 of RAP30 were identified as critical for the RPB5 binding, and furthermore, these mutants of RAP30 eliminated the efficient recruitment of pol II to RAP30, indicating that the direct binding of RAP30 and RPB5 is important for the recruitment of pol II to TFIIF. The plasmids pNKFLAG and pNKGST, derived from pSG5UTPL, are FLAG-tagged and GST-tagged mammalian expression vectors, respectively, as reported (7Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K.

The full-length and truncated GST-RPB5 expression plasmids have been described (7Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The plasmids pGST-RAP30 and His-ET-RAP74 were a gift from R. G. Roeder. The RAP30 cDNA of pGST-RAP30 was used as template to amplify PCR products of RAP30 with the primer set of CAGAATTCATGGCCGAGCGCGGGGAA and GCAGATCTGTCACTCTTTTCTTC, generating an artificial EcoRI site at the 5′-end and a BglII site at the 3′-end, respectively. The PCR product of RAP74 was amplified with the primer set of CAGAATTCATGGCGGCCCTAGGCCCT and GCGGATCCTCCTTGAGGGAGAAGTG, with His-ET-RAP74 as template, generating an artificial EcoRI site at the 5′-end and a BamHI site at the 3′-end, respectively. The PCR products were digested and inserted into theEcoRI and BamHI sites of pNKGST, pNKFLAG, pGENKS, and pYFLAG to construct various expression vectors. The resultant plasmids were used as template to construct a truncated version of RAP30 by a PCR-assisted method (43Murakami S. Cheong J.H. Kaneko S. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15118-15123Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The truncation mutants of RAP30 cDNA, RAP30/d1, d2, d3, d4, and d5, encode the initiation codon followed by amino acids 2–100, 2–176, 177–249, 101–249, and 101–176, respectively. An alanine scanning was applied to construct clustered or single alanine substitution mutants of the middle part of RAP30 by a splicing PCR method using mutated oligonucleotide primer sets (7Lin Y.

All of the constructs were sequenced by the dideoxy method using Taq sequencing kits and a DNA sequencer (370A; Applied Biosystems Inc. Co. Ltd.). GST-fused proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3 h. The cells were harvested and sonicated in PBST buffer (phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% Triton X-100) (6Dorjsuren D. Lin Y. Wei W. Yamashita T. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Cell.

For purification, the extracts were incubated with glutathione-Sepharose 4B (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) at room temperature for 1 h. The beads were precipitated, washed four times with an excess amount of PBST buffer, and then eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). The eluted proteins were divided into aliquots and stored at −80 °C. The His-tagged RAP74 protein was expressed in BL21 (DE3)/pLys using 0.4 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h at 30 °C. The cells were harvested and sonicated in native binding buffer (20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 7.8), and the His-tagged proteins were purified by incubating the sonication supernatant with nickel-resin (Invitrogen). After extensive washing, the bound proteins were eluted with imidazole elution buffer (300 mm imidazole, 20 mm sodium phosphate, 500 mm NaCl, pH 6.3). FLAG-tagged proteins were expressed in BL21 by induction with 0.4 mm isopropyl-d-thiogalactopyranoside at 30 °C for 3–6 h. The cells were harvested and sonicated in 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl, and 0.1% Triton X-100. After centrifugation, the supernatant was stored at −80 °C. FLAG-tagged proteins were purified by incubating the sonication supernatant with anti-FLAG M2 resin (Kodak Scientific Imaging Systems) followed by several washes. The bound proteins were eluted with buffer containing FLAG peptide (0.2 mg/ml FLAG peptide, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mm NaCl). The reconstitution of TFIIF was carried out basically according to the method of Maldonado (44Maldonado E. Drapkin R. Reinberg D. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 274: 72-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) but with one additional step for purification. Equimolar amounts of partially purified GST-RAP30 (1 mg) and His-RAP74 (2 mg) were mixed in 1.2 ml of buffer A (20 mm HEPES-KOH, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, 2 mm dithiothreitol, 0.5 mm EDTA) containing 4 m urea, 0.5 m KCl. The mixture was dialyzed against 100 volumes of buffer A with 0.5 mKCl for 3 h at 4 °C and then dialyzed against 100 volumes of buffer A with 0.1 m KCl for another 3 h. The dialyzed solution was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was collected and incubated with 60 μl of nickel resin for 20 min. After being washed with a solution containing 0.5 m NaCl, 50 mm imidazole, and 20 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) three times, the nickel resin-bound proteins were eluted with elution solution (0.5 m NaCl, 0.2m imidazole, 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0). The eluted proteins were then incubated with 40 μl of packed glutathione-Sepharose 4B in 1.0 ml of PBST buffer for 30 min. After extensive washings, the bound proteins were eluted with 10 mm of reduced glutathione in 50 mm Tris-HCl (pH 8.0). Ten μl of the eluate was fractionated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Anti-RPB5, anti-RPB3, and anti-GST polyclonal antibodies were reported previously (5Cheong J.H.

Roeder, and anti-CTD monoclonal antibody (7G5) was kindly provided by M. Vigneron. Anti-FLAG M2 antibody was purchased commercially (Kodak Science Imaging Systems). A GST resin pull-down assay was carried out as reported (6Dorjsuren D. Lin Y. Wei W. Yamashita T. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Cell.

Approximately 1 μg of GST or GST-fused protein immobilized on 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B preblocked in 0.5% nonfat milk and 0.05% bovine serum albumin was incubated with 0.1 μg of FLAG-tagged proteins in 0.5 ml of modified GBT buffer for 1–2 h on a rotator at 4 °C. After being washed four times with modified GBT buffer, the bound proteins were eluted, fractionated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and subjected to Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody (M2). Transient transfection of COS1 cells was carried out as reported previously (6Dorjsuren D. Lin Y. Wei W. Yamashita T. Nomura T. Hayashi N. Murakami S. Mol. Cell.

The cells were harvested, washed, and sonicated in LAC buffer (10% glycerol, 20 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 50 mm KCl, 0.4 m NaCl, 1 mmMgCl, 0.1 mm dithiothreitol, 0.1 mm EDTA, 9 mm CHAPS, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin and leupeptin) and then centrifuged. The total cell lysates were stored at −80 °C. Approximately 1.5 mg of protein of total cell lysates was diluted with 4 times the volume of TBST buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl, 0.05% Tween 20) and incubated with 50 μl of packed Sepharose 4B for 30 min. The supernatant was then obtained by centrifugation. Supernatants with FLAG-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated with 20 μl of 50% anti-FLAG M2 resin, rotated for 2 h at 4 °C, and washed four times with washing buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mm NaCl) (TBS). For in vivo GST pull-down assay, COS1 cell lysates with GST or GST-fused protein were incubated with 20 μl of glutathione-Sepharose 4B at 4 °C. After being rotated for 2 h and washed four times with washing buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1 mm EDTA), the bound proteins were eluted, fractionated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes, and subjected to Western blot analysis with the antibody. The proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL), according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Since RPB5 and TFIIF seem to play roles in the initiation of transcription and both have been reported to interact with TFIIB (7Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar, 33Fang S.M. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11703-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), we examined whether RPB5 interacts with TFIIF. The recombinant GST-RAP30 and His-RAP74 were independently expressed in E. coli, partially purified, mixed at an equimolar ratio in denaturating conditions, and dialyzed to renature the proteins (Fig.1 A, lane 1). Finally, the reconstituted TFIIF of the two factors was purified on two successive affinity columns, nickel resin and glutathione resin, as described under “Materials and Methods” (Fig.1 B, lanes 2 and 3). The two-step purification is better than the one-step purification of TFIIF (data not shown). The reconstituted TFIIF (rTFIIF) or each subunit of TFIIF (Fig. 1 B) was incubated with the purified bacterial recombinant FLAG-RPB5 and then subjected to GST resin pull-down assay using glutathione resin. The reconstituted TFIIF and GST-RAP30 bound FLAG-RPB5, while GST-RAP74 and GST alone did not recover FLAG-RPB5. The result indicates the direct binding of FLAG-RPB5 and reconstituted TFIIF and indicates that RAP30 might be the subunit responsible for the binding. Next we confirmed the binding of RPB5 and TFIIF in mammalian cells, COS1 cells. GST-RPB5 and both GST-RAP30 and FLAG-RAP74, or GST-RPB5 and either subunit of TFIIF in the FLAG-tagged form, were transiently overexpressed. All of the proteins were similarly expressed in the cells as detected by anti-FLAG M2 and anti-GST antibodies (Fig.2, B and C). The supernatants of lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG M2 resin, washed extensively, and subjected to Western detection using anti-GST antibody (Fig. 2 A). GST-RPB5 was efficiently recovered with FLAG-RAP74 together with GST-RAP30, although it was not copurified when GST-RAP30 was absent. Similar to the in vitro experiment, RPB5 directly interacted with RAP30 but not with RAP74. The result clearly indicates that RPB5 directly binds to RAP30 in the presence or absence of RAP74. The RAP30-binding region of RPB5 was delineated using various truncation mutants by which we previously demonstrated the HBx and TFIIB bindings of RPB5 (7Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A series of truncation mutants of RPB5 in GST form were tested for activity to bind FLAG-RAP30 (Fig. 3 A). Similar amounts of the bacterial GST fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione resin (1 μg) (Fig. 3 B) were incubated with FLAG-RAP30in vitro and subjected to GST resin pull-down assay (Fig.3 C). Mutant d13 (aa 47–120), the central region of RPB5, is the minimal binding region of RAP30, since neither R83 (aa 73–120), the minimal region for the HBx-binding, nor RAD2 (aa 45–93) retained the ability to bind FLAG-RAP30. Therefore, the RAP30-binding region was mapped within aa 47–120, which covers the HBx-binding region (7Lin Y. Nomura T. Cheong J. Dorjsuren D. Iida K. Murakami S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7132-7139Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). The RPB5-binding region of RAP30 was mapped using a series of truncation mutants of RAP30 in GST-fused form both in vitro and in vivo (Fig.4 A). Bacterially expressed proteins of wild type and truncation mutants of GST-RAP30 were purified (Fig. 4 B) and incubated with FLAG-RPB5 in vitro(Fig. 4 C). All proteins but mutant d3, the C-terminus of RAP30 (aa 177–249), pulled down FLAG-RPB5. RAP30 seems to have two separate regions to bind RPB5, since both d1 (aa 1–100) of N-terminus and d5 (aa 101–176) of the middle part bound to RPB5. To confirm the result of the in vitro pull-down assay, an in vivo pull-down assay was carried out with the lysates of the COS1 cells coexpressing FLAG-RPB5 and wild type or mutant GST-RAP30. Neither GST-RAP30/d3 nor GST alone could pull down FLAG-RPB5, confirming the pull-down experiment in vitro (data not shown). Since the N-terminus of RAP30 has been reported to be essential for the complex formation with RAP74 (33Fang S.M. Burton Z.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 11703-11709Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar, 34Yonaha M. Aso T. Kobayashi Y. Vasavada H. Yasukochi Y. Weissman S.M. Kitajima S. Nucleic Acids Res. 1993; 21: 273-279Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), we evaluated the RPB5 binding of RAP30 in the presence of RAP74 in vitro and in vivo. At first, the purified bacterial wild type and mutant RAP30 in GST-fused form were examined for binding to FLAG-RAP74. The N-terminal RAP30 (d1, aa 1–100) as well as the full-length RAP30 could pull-down FLAG-RAP74, but no binding was observed with d3 and d5 mutants of RAP30, confirming that the N-terminal region is critical for the RAP74-binding (Fig. 5 A,lanes 1 and 4). Next we examined the effect of RAP74 on the RPB5-binding of RAP30 in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5 B, the N-terminal RAP30 (d1) could not recruit FL"

In contrast to the wild type, however, the content of phycobilisomes and photosystem I as determined from 77 K fluorescence spectra is reduced in the petM− strain. Furthermore, whereas under anaerobic conditions the kinetics of cytochromef re-reduction are identical, under aerobic conditions these kinetics are slower in the petM− strain. Fluorescence induction measurements indicate that this is due to an increased plastoquinol oxidase activity in the mutant, causing the plastoquinone pool to be in a more oxidized state under aerobic dark conditions. The finding that the activity of the cytochromeb6 f complex itself is unchanged, whereas the stoichiometry of other protein complexes has altered, suggests an involvement of the PetM subunit in regulatory processes mediated by the cytochrome b6 fcomplex.

In green algae and higher plants it is located in the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts and mediates electron transport from PS1 II to PS I (for reviews see Refs. 1Cramer W.A. Soriano G.M. Zhang H. Ponamarev M.V. Smith J.L. Physiol. Plant. 1997; 100: 852-862Crossref Google Scholar and 2Wollman F.-A. Rochaix J.-D. Goldschmidt-Clermont M. Merchant S. The Molecular Biology of Chloroplasts and Mitochondria in Chlamydomonas. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 459-476Google Scholar). In cyanobacteria (3Kallas T. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 259-312Crossref Google Scholar), it is located both in thylakoid and cytoplasmic membranes (4Schmetterer G. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 409-435Crossref Google Scholar). Because of the absence of a cytochrome bc1 complex, the cytochromeb6 f complex fulfills additional functions in these organisms. It is involved in both photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport, acting as a plastoquinol-cytochrome c6-plastocyanin oxidoreductase and playing a role in electron transfer from PS II or NAD(P)H dehydrogenase to PS I or cytochrome oxidase, respectively (5Scherer S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1990; 15: 458-462Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). In all organisms capable of oxygenic photosynthesis the cytochromeb6 f complex consists of four major proteins and additional small subunits. The 25-kDa cytochromeb6 protein contains two b-type hemes and, together with the 17-kDa protein subunit IV, is homologous to cytochrome b of the cytochrome bc1complex (6Widger W.R. Cramer W.A. Herrmann R.G. Trebst A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1984; 81: 674-678Crossref PubMed Scopus (333) Google Scholar). Cytochrome b6 and subunit IV are integral membrane proteins with four and three predicted transmembrane α-helices, respectively. Cytochrome f is a 31-kDa c-type cytochrome with a covalently bound heme c in the large lumen-exposed domain; it is anchored by a single C-terminal α-helix in the membrane. Similarly, the Rieske iron-sulfur protein has a large hydrophilic lumenal domain attached to a single transmembrane α-helix at the N terminus. Whereas the three-dimensional structure of the whole cytochromeb6 f complex has not yet been resolved at high resolution, the structure of some fragments is known. The lumenal domain of cytochrome f of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (7Martinez S.E. Hang D. Szczepaniak A. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1994; 2: 95-105Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar) and Phormidium laminosum (8Carrell C.J. Schlarb B.G. Bendall D.S. Howe C.J. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L.

Zhang H. Cramer W.A. Smith J.L. Structure. 1997; 5: 1613-1625Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). Analysis of two-dimensional crystals of the whole complex has led to a projection map of only 8-Å resolution to date (10Mosser G. Breyton C. Olofsson A. Popot J.-L. Rigaud J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 20263-20268Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). However, the structure of the cytochrome bc1 complex from mitochondria has been determined to about 3-Å resolution (11Iwata S. Lee J.W. Okada K. Lee J.K. Iwata M. Rasmussen B. Link T.A. Ramaswamy S. Jap B.K. Science. 1998; 286: 64-71Crossref Scopus (1046) Google Scholar, 12Yu C.-A. Xia D. Kim H. Deisenhofer J. Zhang L. Kachurin A.M. Yu L. Biochim. Biophys.

Biol. 1998; 8: 501-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), and this structure is a useful guide for predicting the general structure of homologous subunits of the cytochromeb6 f complex (14Bron P. Lacapère J.-L. Breyton C. Mosser G. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 287: 117-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Because the core structures of bc1 andb6 f complexes consist of similar proteins and are functionally nearly identical, their three-dimensional structures are likely to be very similar. However, the additional subunits, PetG (15Haley J. Bogorad L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 1534-1538Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar), PetL (16Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), and PetM (17Ketcher S.L. Malkin R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) inb6 f complexes and up to eight additional subunits in eukaryotic bc1 complexes, have no obvious relation with each other and are likely therefore to be structurally quite different. The functions of the additional smallb6 f subunits is not yet known. Interestingly, a gene encoding the PetL protein cannot be found in the completely sequenced genome of the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis PCC 6803 (18Kaneko T. Sato S. Kotani H. Tanaka A. Asamizu E. Nakamura Y. Miyajima N. Hirosawa M. Sugiura M. Sasamoto S. Kimura T. Hosouchi T. Matsuno A. Muraki A. Nakazaki N. Naruo K. Okumura S. Shimpo S. Takeuchi C. Wada T. Watanabe A. Yamada M. Yasuda M. Tabata S. DNA Res. 1996; 3: 109-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (2100) Google Scholar). Recently the open reading frameycf6 of chloroplasts, for which a cyanobacterial homolog exists, was shown to encode an essential subunit of the cytochromeb6 f complex that is now calledpetN (19Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). Whereas inactivation of petG,petL, and petN indicate an essential role of these subunits for the cytochrome b6 fcomplex, such experiments have not yet been performed withpetM. This may be due to the fact that PetM is nuclear encoded in C. reinhardtii (20de Vitry C. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10667-10671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) and higher plants (21Kügler M. Kruft V. Schmitz U.K. Braun H.-P. J. Plant Physiol. 1998; 153: 581-586Crossref Scopus (6) Google Scholar), making its deletion more difficult. Little information is available on the function of PetM, and its orientation in the membrane remains controversial. Ketcher and Malkin (17Ketcher S.L. Malkin R. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1996; 1273: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) argue for a lumenal orientation of the C terminus because of its more positive character. However, de Vitry et al. (20de Vitry C. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 10667-10671Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar) concluded from trypsin treatment experiments with thylakoid membranes that the C terminus had a stromal orientation. In this report the petM gene of Synechocystis PCC 6803 was deleted. Analysis of the resulting mutant revealed characteristic differences from WT that suggest that PetM is not essential for b6 f complex activity but instead plays a regulatory role. Synechocystis PCC 6803 wild type and the petM− (petMinterruption) mutant strains were grown at 30 °C in BG11 medium (22Rippka R. Derueles J. Waterbury J.B. Herdmann M. Stanier R.T. J. Gen. Microbiol. 1979; 111: 1-61Crossref Google Scholar) aerated with air enriched in CO2 and at light intensities of 20 or 100 μmol photons m−2 sec−1. For selection of spectinomycin-resistant mutants, BG11 medium was supplemented with increasing concentrations of spectinomycin (5–100 μg/ml). Cloning was carried out using standard techniques as described in Ref. 23Sambrook J. Fritsch E. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar. Enzymes used for PCR and cloning were obtained from MBI Fermentas and New England Biolabs. PCR was done in a Bio-Rad Thermocycler for 30 cycles under the following conditions: 95 °C for 1 min, 60 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 2 min. The following primers were used for amplification of the petM gene alone and the petMgene with flanking regions: CT PetM, TTATTCTTCGCTACCTTGGAGTTT; NT PetM, ATGACCGCTGAAAGCATGTTGGCC; CT PetM+, AGCACCATTTGGGCTTGGGTGTCC; NT PetM+, TTTGAGCGGAATATGGGTGGTGGC. A 1.0-kilobase pair DNA fragment encoding the petM gene and flanking regions fromSynechocystis PCC6803 was amplified by PCR. TheNheI-restricted DNA fragment was cloned into theNheI side of the pDMI.1 (24Certa U. Bannwarth W. Stüber D. Gentz R. Lanzer M. Le Grice S. Guillot F. Wendler I. Hunsmann G. Bujard H. Mous J.

For Southern hybridization the amplified petM gene was labeled with digoxygenin using the instructions of the non-radioactive labeling kit (Roche Molecular Biochemicals).

For fluorescence measurements, cells were diluted in BG11 medium containing 20% glycerol to a final chlorophyll concentration of 5 μg/ml and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Fluorescence induction measurements were carried out as described previously. 2S. Berry, D. Schneider, W. F. J. Vermaas, and M. Rögner, submitted for publication. Single turnover kinetics of cytochrome f and P700 (the photosynthetic reaction center of photosystem I) were monitored at room temperature using an in-house-constructed single beam spectrophotometer as described in Ref.29Rich P.R. Madgwick A. Moss D.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1991; 1058: 312-328Crossref Scopus (75) Google Scholar. Synechocystis cells were suspended to a final chlorophyll concentration of 12 μg/ml in BG11 medium. Cytochromef and P700 kinetics were determined by analysis of flash-induced absorbance changes at 551, 556, 561, and 703 nm. Flashes of 6-ms half peak width were provided to both sides of the sample with a xenon flashlamp (20 millifarad capacitance) filtered with BG635 filters. Cytochrome f redox changes were calculated from the absorbance difference at 556 nm minus the average of 551 nm and 561 nm and with an assumed extinction coefficient of 18 mm−1cm−1. Redox changes of P700 were monitored at 703 nm with an assumed extinction coefficient of 64 mm−1cm−1. To obtain anaerobic conditions, 10 mm glucose, 400 units/ml catalase, and 24 units/ml glucose oxidase were added, and samples were incubated for 5 min prior to the measurement. Protein sequence information was analyzed using the public domain CuraTools protein analysis software (CuraGen). Similarity searches were performed using the BLAST program provided by the National Center for Biotechnology Information. For the generation of a petM− Synechocystis strain, the 5.7-kilobase pair plasmid pPMF was cleaved with BspHI, which has a unique site in the petM gene, and the resulting termini of the plasmid were filled in using T4 DNA polymerase. A spectinomycin/streptomycin resistance cassette containing theaadA + gene was obtained by restricting the plasmid pHP45Ω (30Prentki P. Krisch H.M. Gene ( Amst. ). 1984; 29: 303-313Crossref PubMed Scopus (1337) Google Scholar) with SmaI and ligated to the linearized plasmid pPMF. The resulting 7.8-kilobase pair plasmid pPMS was used for transformation of the Synechocystis wild-type cells. A completely segregated petM− mutant was confirmed by PCR after several subcultures in BG11 medium with increasing amounts of spectinomycin. Fig.1 A shows a fragment of about 100 base pairs carrying the petM gene, which was amplified from wild-type DNA, whereas a fragment of about 2.2 kilobase pairs was obtained with DNA from the petM− mutant corresponding to the size of the petM gene interrupted by the resistance cassette. No 100-base pair fragment was detectable in the mutant under various PCR conditions, indicating a complete segregation, which was confirmed by Southern blotting experiments (Fig.1 B). According to the Synechocystis genome sequence, an open reading frame of unknown function (smr0003) is located directly upstream of the interrupted gene. To check for polar effects on this possibly cotranscribed gene, an alternative inactivation strategy for the petM gene was also carried out. The pPMF plasmid was restricted with BspHI, and the 4-nucleotide overhang was filled in by T4 polymerase. Religation of the plasmid caused a frameshift in the petM gene. After insertion of a chloramphenicol resistance cassette at the BspE I site of the plasmid, the construct was used for transformation ofSynechocystis. The resulting mutant was checked for complete segregation by restricting the PCR-amplified petM gene withBspHI. Only the wild-type gene could be restricted with this enzyme, because the frameshift introduced into the mutated gene caused the loss of this restriction site. The completely segregated mutant showed the same phenotype as the mutant with the interrupted gene in all measurements carried out. This indicated that either the interruption of the petM gene did not affect the expression of this putative gene or that the additional inactivation of this open reading frame did not yield any phenotype. Fig. 2shows absorbance spectra of Synechocystis wild-type and mutant cells grown under low (20 μmol photons m−2 sec−1; LL) and medium high light intensity (100 μmol photons m−2 sec−1; HL). Under both conditions, particularly at higher light intensity, the level of phycobilisomes (absorption peak at 620 nm) is decreased in thepetM− strain. This is reflected in a yellow-green color of the mutant in comparison with the blue-green color of the wild type. To test for additional effects of the petM disruption on the photosynthetic pigment composition, fluorescence emission spectra of whole cells were recorded at 77 K upon excitation of chlorophyll at 435 nm or of phycobilisomes at 580 nm (Fig.3). Peaks at about 650 and 665 nm can be attributed to phycobilisome pigments, and the peak at 685 nm can be attributed to the phycobilisome terminal emitter allophycocyanin B and the small antenna of PS II. The peak at 695 nm is associated with CP47 of PS II, and the peak at 725 nm originates from PS I (31Bald D. Kruip J. Rögner M. Photosynth. Res. 1996; 49: 103-118Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). In the mutant, a decreased amount of phycobiliproteins relative to chlorophyll is obvious from Fig. 3. Fig. 3, Aand C, illustrates a decreased emission peak at 725 nm in the mutant, particularly under HL conditions. Because the chlorophyll content per cell is decreased by up to 20% in the mutant relative to the wild type (as assessed from the ratio of chlorophyll to OD730), the amount of PS I apparently is decreased in the mutant. In addition, because PS I binds about 90% of the total cellular chlorophyll, and the relative decrease of the emission peak at 725 nm is more than 20%, an increase in the amount of PS II per cell is also likely. To check the activity of the remaining PS I complexes, the primary donor P700 of PS I was oxidized by a single turnover flash, and the re-reduction by plastocyanin was monitored. As shown in Fig.4, the kinetics of the wild type (A) and petM− strain (B) are very similar, indicating that the intrinsic activity of the remaining PS I complexes is unaffected. For a more quantitative analysis, the amount of P700 was determined as outlined under “Materials and Methods.” The wild type yielded 3.27 mmol of P700/mol of chlorophyll, and the mutant yielded only 2.48 mmol of P700/mol of chlorophyll; this clearly confirms the increased PS II:PS I ratio in the petM− strain observed by 77 K fluorescence spectroscopy. In contrast to higher plants, the PQ pool of the cyanobacteriumSynechocystis PCC 6803 is mainly reduced in the dark,2 indicating that the intersystem components cytochrome f, the Rieske protein, plastocyanin, and P700 will also be reduced under these conditions. Photooxidation of P700 by a single saturating xenon flash is followed within a millisecond by oxidation of intersystem components as P700 is re-reduced. This in turn is followed by re-reduction of the intersystem components by plastoquinol, catalyzed by the cytochrome b6 fcomplex and occurring at a rate governed by the degree of reduction of the plastoquinone pool. The re-reduction kinetics of cytochromef, monitored as described above, is shown in Fig.5 under aerobic conditions for WT (A) and the petM− strain (B). Although both exhibit oxidation followed by re-reduction on this timescale, a considerable part of cytochromef in the petM− mutant remains oxidized in comparison with the wild type. This effect could be caused either by a malfunctioning fraction of the cytochromeb6 f complex or by a more oxidized redox state of the PQ pool in the mutant. Interestingly, under anaerobic conditions, the re-reduction kinetics of cytochromef in the petM− mutant are almost identical to those of the wild type (Fig. 5, C andD). This indicates that the aerobic difference arises because the plastoquinone pool is more oxidized in the mutant, rather than because of any difference in theb6 f function itself. Moreover, quantification of the extent of the cytochrome f transient shows that the content of the cytochromeb6 f complex in the mutant is similar to that of the wild type (Fig. 5). The redox state of the PQ pool in the mutant was monitored by fluorescence induction measurements. This is possible because the redox state of QA depends on the redox state of the PQ pool.2 Fig.6, A–D, shows fluorescence induction curves of wild-type and petM− cells grown under LL and HL conditions and in the presence of 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone, an inhibitor of cytochrome b6 foxidoreductase activity. For comparison, the maximum fluorescence yield of cells from different strains was measured by blocking the reoxidation of QA− with 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea at the QBsite of PS II. Interestingly, the variable fluorescence (FV) in the petM− strain (Fig. 6 D) did not reach the maximal level obtained by the addition of 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea, in contrast to the behavior of the wild-type strain (Fig. 6 B). This effect is even stronger under HL (Fig. 6, A and C), although under these conditions WT also does not reach the maximum level. Even an enhanced illumination of 4 s could not help the mutant strain to reach the maximum fluorescence yield (Fig.6 E), leaving the PQ pool partly oxidized. This suggests that another component besides the cytochromeb6 f complex is capable of oxidizing the PQ pool. Fig. 6 F shows that a combination of 2,5-dibromo-3-methyl-6-isopropyl-p-benzoquinone and pentachlorophenol, an inhibitor of quinol oxidases, yields similar kinetics of variable fluorescence in the mutant and the wild type, strongly indicating an increased activity of a quinol oxidase in the mutant that is capable of keeping the PQ pool in a more oxidized condition.

Bujard H. Mous J. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 3051-3056Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar) resulted in fully segregated mutants of Synechocystis PCC 6803 and indicate that these complexes are not essential for the survival of the cells. In contrast, inactivation of genes encoding the main cytochrome b6 f subunits have failed so far to produce a viable organism (36Osiewacz H.D. Arch. Microbiol. 1992; 157: 336-342Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar); this is due to the absence of a cytochrome bc1 complex inSynechocystis PCC 6803 and the essential function of the cytochrome b6 f complex in both respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport. For this reason, inactivation or site-directed mutagenesis leading to inactivation of this complex is not possible, in contrast to other organisms such as the green alga C. reinhardtii, where theb6 f complex is nonessential (37Hippler M. Redding K. Rochaix J.-D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1367: 1-62Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). In C. reinhardtii deletion of the gene encoding the small cytochrome b6 f subunit PetG (38Berthold D.A. Schmidt C.L. Malkin R. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 29293-29298Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar), as well as the inactivation of the petL gene (16Takahashi Y. Rahire M. Breyton C. Popot J.-L. Joliot P. Rochaix J.-D. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 3498-3506Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), resulted in no, or impaired, photoautotrophic growth; in addition, the amount of other cytochrome b6 f subunits is strongly reduced. Additionally, a new small subunit of the cytochromeb6 f complex, PetN, was recently identified, the inactivation of which also led to a photosynthetically incompetent phenotype (19Hager M. Biehler K. Illerhaus J. Ruf S. Bock R. EMBO J. 1999; 18: 5834-5842Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar). In contrast, petM can be fully deleted inSynechocystis, resulting in only minor effects on the cytochrome b6 f complex. This is the first time that a complete deletion of a cytochromeb6 f subunit inSynechocystis has been described. Inactivation ofpetM in Synechocystis did not affect the amount of assembled b6 f complex in the membranes as quantified from the extent of the cytochrome fkinetic transients. Under all tested conditions growth is normal (data not shown, but see Ref. 39Schneider D. Berry S. Seidler A. Rögner M. Garab G. Photosynthesis: Mechanisms and Effects. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1998: 1545-1548Google Scholar), and there is also not a very obvious phenotype under various light intensities. These results clearly show that the PetM subunit has no essential role inb6 f electron transfer function in the cyanobacterium Synechocystis PCC 6803; however, the absence of this subunit apparently affects the levels of other protein complexes involved in energy transduction. Our results clearly show an impact of PetM on some protein complexes of Synechocystisthat are involved in the electron transport chain. Whereas the amount of the cytochrome b6 f complex is similar in mutant and wild-type strains, both PS I and phycobilisome content are reduced in the mutant strain. Furthermore, the re-reduction kinetics of cytochrome f are different under aerobic conditions; this could result from an altered cytochromeb6 f complex activity or a more oxidized redox state of the PQ pool. Because the activity of the complex was the same in the mutant and WT under anaerobic conditions, the different aerobic re-reduction behavior probably arises from an increased oxidation state of the PQ pool in the aerobic state. Furthermore, the fluorescence induction measurements indicate that electrons can leave the PQ pool of the petM− mutant even when the cytochrome b6 fcomplex is inhibited. A strong candidate for this alternative route of plastoquinol oxidation under aerobic conditions is the cytochrome bd oxidase, especially because pentachlorophenol, a specific inhibitor of the cytochrome bd oxidase in Synechocystis (25Pils D. Gregor W. Schmetterer G. FEMS Microbiol. Lett. 1997; 152: 83-88Crossref Google Scholar), is able to restore the mutant fluorescence induction kinetics to resemble that of WT. The comparison with wild-type cells suggests an increased activity of this oxidase in the thylakoid membrane of thepetM− mutant. Whereas the spectroscopic data indicate that the subunit PetM is not required for the stability, assembly, or redox activity of the cytochromeb6 f complex, changes in the activity of other protein complexes in the membrane imply a specific regulatory role of the cytochrome b6 f complex in general and the PetM subunit in particular. A regulatory function of the redox state of the PQ pool has been postulated for a long time, and analysis of this phenomenon is an active field of research. In some cases the redox state of the PQ pool itself seems to be the signal for further regulatory steps (40Pfannschmidt T. Nilsson A. Allen J.F. Nature. 1999; 397: 625-628Crossref Scopus (476) Google Scholar), whereas in other cases the cytochromeb6 f complex seems to be directly involved in signaling. It has been shown that the cytochromeb6 f complex can regulate the PS I/PS II stoichiometry in cyanobacteria (41Murakami A. Fujita Y. Plant Cell Physiol. 1993; 34: 1175-1180Google Scholar). Changing light conditions or cytochrome b6 f complex inhibitor treatment affects the amount of PS I, whereas the content of PS II and the cytochrome b6 f complex remains constant. These observations are in good agreement with our results and support the conclusion that the PS I content has changed in thepetM− mutant without, however, having any effect on its re-reduction kinetics. In addition, the data presented in this work indicate an increased activity of a quinol oxidase. This could be due either to an activation of this complex or to accumulation of more quinol oxidase in the membrane. In the case of PS I it seems already clear that the cytochrome b6 f complex controls the assembly process of this complex (42Fujita Y. Murakami A. Aizawa K. Bryant D.A. The Molecular Biology of Cyanobacteria. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Dordrecht, The Netherlands1994: 677-692Crossref Google Scholar). A working model based on the data presented here is shown in Fig.7. The cytochromeb6 f complex seems to control the activity or assembly of the phycobilisomes, of PS I, and of the cytochrome bd oxidase. The relative stoichiometries of these complexes, as gained from the presented data, indicate that the regulatory function of the cytochromeb6 f complex is impaired;i.e. the inactivation of petM yields a cytochromeb6 f complex with altered regulatory properties. Because the redox activity of the complex seems unaffected, PetM itself must have a role in the accumulation of other protein complexes. PetM is extremely hydrophobic and of relatively small size. Both facts argue against a role of PetM in the expression or post-translational modification of other cytochrome b6 fsubunits. Hydropathy analysis of PetM suggests an intrinsic protein with one transmembrane helix. A new small intrinsic subunit (PetO) of the cytochromeb6 f complex of C. reinhardtii with a possible regulatory function has recently been identified (28Hamel P. Olive J. Pierre Y. Wollman F.-A. de Vitry C. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 17072-17079Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (73) Google Scholar). Because there exists no homologous protein inSynechocystis and because the function of PetM is completely unknown, it seems possible that this small subunit is involved in a signal transduction process involving the cytochromeb6 f complex in this cyanobacterium. The inactivation of the petM gene may effect a signal transduction cascade with concomitant influence on protein stoichiometries in the thylakoid membrane ofSynechocystis. In summary, the presented data indicate that the cytochromeb6 f subunit PetM is not essential for the redox activity of this complex. Although the mutant strain shows no apparent phenotype, PetM seems to be important for regulatory circuits including a quinol oxidase in which the cytochromeb6 f complex may be involved.

Ramsey is gratefully acknowledged."

D., Nguyen, H. T., Pessah, I. N., and Allen, P. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 7360–7367 and Fleig, A., Takeshima, H., and Penner, R. (1996) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 496, 339–345). To probe the role of RyR-1 in influencing L-type Ca2+ channel (L-channel) expression, we have monitored functional L-channel expression in the sarcolemma using the whole-cell patch clamp technique in normal, dyspedic, and RyR-1-expressing dyspedic myotubes. Our results indicate that dyspedic myotubes exhibit a 45% reduction in maximum immobilization-resistant charge movement (Qmax) and a 90% reduction in peak Ca2+ current density. Calcium current density was significantly increased in dyspedic myotubes 3 days after injection of cDNA encoding either wild-type RyR-1 or E4032A, a mutant RyR-1 that is unable to restore robust voltage-activated release of Ca2+ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) following expression in dyspedic myotubes (O'Brien, J. J., Allen, P. D., Beam, K., and Chen, S. R. W. (1999) Biophys. J. 76, A302 (abstr.)). The increase in L-current density 3 days after expression of either RyR-1 or E4032A occurred in the absence of a change in Qmax. However, Qmax was increased 85% 6 days after injection of dyspedic myotubes with cDNA encoding the wild-type RyR-1 but not E4032A. Because normal and dyspedic myotubes exhibited a similar density of T-type Ca2+ current (T-current), the presence of RyR-1 does not appear to cause a general overall increase in protein synthesis. Thus, long-term expression of L-channels in skeletal myotubes is promoted by Ca2+ released through RyRs occurring either spontaneously or during excitation-contraction coupling. Skeletal muscle obtained from mice that lack the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR-1), termed dyspedic mice, exhibit a 2-fold reduction in the number of dihydropyridine binding sites (DHPRs) compared with skeletal muscle obtained from wild-type mice (Buck, E. D., Nguyen, H. T., Pessah, I. N., and Allen, P. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 7360–7367 and Fleig, A., Takeshima, H., and Penner, R. (1996) J. Physiol. (Lond.) 496, 339–345).

Thus, long-term expression of L-channels in skeletal myotubes is promoted by Ca2+ released through RyRs occurring either spontaneously or during excitation-contraction coupling. dihydropyridine receptor L-channel excitation-contraction sarcoplasmic reticulum ryanodine receptors cAMP-response element-binding protein The skeletal muscle dihydropyridine receptor (DHPR)1 functions both as a slowly activating L-type Ca2+ channel (L-channel) and as a voltage sensor that controls the activity of the type 1 ryanodine receptor (RyR-1) present in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). During excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, sarcolemmal depolarization (e.g. an action potential) induces voltage-driven conformational changes in the DHPR, which can be measured electrophysiologically as nonlinear capacitative currents, termed intramembrane charge movements or gating currents. These charge movements are thought to mechanically activate RyR-1 proteins during EC coupling and thus lead to a massive release of SR calcium (orthograde signal of EC coupling; see Ref. 1Melzer W. Herrmann-Frank A. Luttgau H.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1995; 1241: 59-116Crossref PubMed Scopus (484) Google Scholar for review). Analysis of skeletal myotubes derived from RyR-1-knockout (dyspedic) mice has revealed that in addition to the orthograde signal of EC coupling (signal transmitted from the DHPR to the RyR-1), there is also a retrograde signal whereby RyR-1 promotes the calcium conducting activity of the skeletal L-channel (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This conclusion was inferred from the observation that despite a significant surface density of DHPRs, dyspedic myotubes exhibit a marked (∼90%) reduction in L-current. Moreover, short-term (2–4 days) expression of RyR-1 in dyspedic myotubes considerably enhances L-current density in the absence of a change in intramembrane charge movement (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These observations indicate that RyR-1 promotes the L-channel activity of the skeletal muscle DHPR in a manner that is independent of L-channel expression (retrograde signal of EC coupling). Dyspedic muscle exhibits a 25–50% reduction in total DHP binding (4Fleig A. Takeshima H. Penner R. J. Physiol. ( Lond. ). 1996; 496: 339-345Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar,5Buck E.D. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7360-7367Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Accordingly, we have reported that dyspedic myotubes possess a significant reduction in maximal intramembrane charge movement compared with normal myotubes (3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). This apparent reduction in the number of functional DHPRs in the sarcolemma cannot completely account for the ∼90% decrease in L-current density found in dyspedic myotubes. In fact, dyspedic myotubes exhibit a nearly 5-fold reduction in the current-to-charge and conductance-to-charge (Gmax/Qmax) ratios, compared with both normal and RyR-1-expressing dyspedic myotubes (3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). These observations support the conclusion of Nakai et al. (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar) that RyR-1 promotes the Ca2+ conducting activity of the skeletal muscle L-channel. However, the mechanism(s) underlying the different DHPR expression levels in normal and dyspedic muscle have yet to be investigated. Considering the functional effects of reintroduction of RyR-1 in dyspedic myotubes (i.e. restoration of both retrograde and orthograde signals of EC coupling), either Ca2+ influx (via L-channels) and/or SR Ca2+ release (via RyR-1) could play a critical role in the regulation of sarcolemmal DHPR expression. Despite the central role that the DHPR plays in skeletal EC coupling, controversy exists with regard to the mechanisms that control the expression of L-channels and voltage sensors. In frog skeletal muscle, long-term blockade of skeletal L-channels increases the number of sarcolemmal L-channels and voltage sensors, suggesting that Ca2+ influx (via L-channels) inhibits DHPR expression (6Garcia M.C. Farias J.M. Escamilla J. Sanchez-Armass S. Sanchez J.A. J. Membr. Biol. 1999; 168: 141-148Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). However, elevations in extracellular Ca2+ increase L-current density and intramembrane charge movement in cultured rat myoballs (7Renganathan M. Wang Z.M. Messi M.L. Delbono O. Pflugers Arch. 1999; 438: 649-655Crossref PubMed Scopus (12) Google Scholar). In the present study, we have investigated the roles of Ca2+ influx and release on the regulation of DHPR expression (L-channel activity and charge movement), following expression in dyspedic myotubes of either wild-type RyR-1 or a mutant RyR-1 (E4032A) that preferentially restores the retrograde (i.e. L-current) signal of skeletal muscle EC coupling (8O'Brien J.J. Allen P.D. Beam K. Chen S.R.W. Biophys. J. 1999; 76 (abstr.): A302Google Scholar). Using electrophysiological criteria (Ca2+ current and charge movement magnitudes) as a measure of functional DHPR activity in the sarcolemma, our results demonstrate that functional DHPR expression is promoted by Ca2+ released through RyR-1 proteins and not via Ca2+ influx through sarcolemmal L-channels. Myotubes were prepared from primary culture of normal and dyspedic muscle as described previously (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Expression of wild-type RyR-1 and the E4032A point mutation in RyR-1 in dyspedic myotubes was achieved by nuclear microinjection (9Tanabe T. Beam K.G. Powell J.A. Numa S. Nature. 1988; 336: 134-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar) of the appropriate expression plasmid (0.5 μg/μl) 6–8 days after initial plating of myoblasts. The E4032A mutation in RyR-1 was constructed using a standard two-step site-directed mutagenesis strategy (10Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). The entire polymerase chain reaction-modified cDNA portion was ultimately confirmed by sequence analysis. Expressing myotubes were examined electrophysiologically 2–6 days following nuclear microinjection. In some experiments (Figs. 1, 2, and 5), expressing myotubes were identified by the development of green fluorescence 2–6 days after coinjection with a mixture of either RyR-1 or E4032A cDNAs (0.5 μg/μl) and a cDNA expression plasmid encoding an enhanced green fluorescence protein (0.1 μg/μl). Coinjection of GFP cDNA was omitted when cells were to be used for measurements of intracellular Ca2+ transients (Fig. 4). For these experiments, expression was established by the presence of either electrically evoked (8.0 V, 10–30 ms) contractile activity (RyR-1) or large, slowly activating L-type Ca2+ currents (E4032A).Figure 2Long-term expression of RyR-1 increases peak L-type Ca2+ current density.

The following ΔF/Fmax, VF12(mV) and kF (mV) parameters were obtained: 1.6 ± 0.3, 6.0 ± 3.2, 6.3 ± 1.1 for normal (n = 7); 1.4 ± 0.2, 8.7 ± 2.1, 6.0 ± 0.8 for 3d-RyR-1 (n = 12); and 0.2 ± 0.1, 23.2 ± 4.2, 5.1 ± 1.5 for 3d-E4032A (n = 5) myotubes, respectively. C, calcium transient amplitudes (recorded as in B) were divided by their respective maximal fluorescence change (peak ΔF/Fmax) and plotted as a function of the membrane potential (Vm).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The whole-cell variant of the patch clamp technique (11Hamill O.P. Marty A. Neher E. Sakmann B. Sigworth F.J. Pflugers Arch. 1981; 391: 85-100Crossref PubMed Scopus (15175) Google Scholar) was used to measure ionic and gating currents in both normal and dyspedic myotubes, as described previously (3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Inward L-currents were elicited by 200 ms test pulses of variable amplitude from a holding potential (HP) of −80 mV, following a prepulse protocol (12Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar, 10Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) used to inactivate T-type Ca2+ channels (1 s to −20 mV followed by 50 ms to −50 mV). In some experiments, calcium currents were elicited in the absence of the prepulse protocol to investigate the T-channels activity (see Fig. 3). Peak L-currents were normalized to cell capacitance (pA/pF), plotted as a function of membrane potential (I-V curves), and fitted according to Equation 1, I=Gmax×(Vm−Vrev)/(1+exp[(VG1/2−Vm)/κG])Equation 1 where Vrev is the extrapolated reversal potential of the L-current, Vm is the membrane potential during the test pulse, Gmax is the maximal L-channel conductance, VG 12 is the voltage for half-activation of Gmax, and kG is a slope factor. Immobilization-resistant intramembrane charge movements were measured following the prepulse protocol and blockade of ionic Ca2+currents by the addition of 0.5 mm Cd2+ + 0.2 mm La3+ to the extracellular recording solution (12Adams B.A. Tanabe T. Mikami A. Numa S. Beam K.G. Nature. 1990; 346: 569-572Crossref PubMed Scopus (222) Google Scholar). The amount of immobilization-resistant charge movement was estimated by integrating the transient of charge that moved outward after the onset of the test pulse (Qon) and subsequently normalized to cell capacitance (nC/μF). The magnitude of the maximum immobilization-resistant charge movement (Qmax) was estimated by fitting the Qon data according to Equation2,Qon=Qmax/(1+exp[(VQ1/2−Vm)/κQ])Equation 2 where Vm, VQ12, andkQ have their usual meanings with regard to charge movement. Changes in intracellular Ca2+ were recorded with Fluo-3 as described previously (13Garcia J. Tanabe T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1994; 103: 125-147Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar, 10Dirksen R.T. Beam K.G. J. Gen. Physiol. 1999; 114: 393-403Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). Briefly, the salt form of the dye was added to the internal recording solution (see below). After rupture of the cell membrane and entry into the whole-cell mode, a waiting period of ∼5 min was used to allow the dye to diffuse into the cell interior. A 75 watt xenon bulb and high-speed DeltaRAM illuminator (Photon Technology Incorporated, Monmouth Junction, NJ) were used to excite the dye (480 ± 20 nm) present in a small rectangular region of the voltage-clamped myotube. A computer-controlled shutter was used to eliminate illumination during intervals between test pulses. Fluorescence emission was measured using a dichroic long-pass mirror centered at 505 nm, an emission filter centered at 535 ± 25 nm, and a photomultiplier detection system operating in analogue mode (analogue filter set at 0.5 ms) (Photon Technology Incorporated). The background fluorescence was measured and canceled by analogous subtraction. Fluorescence traces are expressed as ΔF/F, where F represents the baseline fluorescence immediately prior to depolarization, and ΔF represents the fluorescence change from baseline. Fluorescence amplitudes at the end of the test pulses were plotted as a function of the membrane potential and fitted according to Equation 3, ΔF/F=(ΔF/Fmax)/{1+exp[(VF1/2−Vm)/kF]}Equation 3 where ΔF/Fmax is the calculated maximal fluorescence change, VF12is the midpoint potential, and kF is the slope factor. Ionic and gating currents were recorded using a pipette solution containing (in mm): Cs-Aspartate (140), MgCl2 (5Buck E.D. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Allen P.D. J. Biol.

The external calcium current recording solution was supplemented with 0.5 mmCdCl2 + 0.2 mm LaCl3 for measurements of intramembrane charge movement. We have previously shown that compared with normal myotubes, the maximum immobilization-resistant intramembrane charge movement (Qmax) is ∼40% smaller in dyspedic myotubes (3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Moreover, Qmax remains unchanged even 2–4 days following reintroduction of RyR-1 into dyspedic myotubes (2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). We have tested whether long-term expression of RyR-1 in dyspedic myotubes restores Qmax to a value comparable with that of normal myotubes. Fig. 1 compares immobilization-resistant charge movements in dyspedic myotubes either 3 or 6 days after nuclear injection of RyR-1 cDNA (3d-RyR-1 and 6d-RyR-1, respectively). In agreement with previous reports, 3d-RyR-1 expressing dyspedic myotubes exhibited Qmax values similar to those of uninjected dyspedic myotubes (Fig. 1 C and TableI). However, charge movements recorded from 6d-RyR-1-expressing dyspedic myotubes were significantly larger than those recorded from either uninjected dyspedic myotubes or 3d-RyR-1-expressing myotubes. On average, Qmax increased 85% 6 days after nuclear microinjection of dyspedic myotubes with RyR-1 cDNA (Fig. 1 and Table I). Fig. 1 C shows the entire time course of the RyR-1-mediated increase in Qmax. A progressive increase in Qmax was found each day between 3 and 6 days following RyR-1 cDNA injection (gray bars). The protracted time course of this effect is consistent with the initiation of a slow process, such as activation of gene transcription and subsequent protein synthesis, rather than a simple redistribution of previously translated but sequestered voltage sensors. By contrast, Qmax values recorded from uninjected dyspedic myotubes during a parallel time did not exhibit a significant change in Qmax (white bars). Thus, the increase in DHPR expression (Qmax) requires long-term reintroduction of RyR-1 and therefore does not arise from a general increase in L-channel expression during prolonged culture. Interestingly, the 6d-RyR-1-expressing dyspedic myotubes exhibit Qmax values that were nearly identical to those obtained from normal myotubes (Table I; see also Ref. 3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Thus, the long-term presence of RyR-1 strongly influences the number of sarcolemmal DHPRs in skeletal myotubes.Table IParameters of fitted I-V and Q-V curvesnI-V dataQ-V dataGmax/QmaxI-VQ-VGmaxVG1/2kGQmaxVQ1/2kQnS/nFmVmVnC/μFmVmVnS/pCNormal1818237 ± 1612.7 ± 1.25.6 ± 0.27.4 ± 0.8−3.7 ± 1.311.7 ± 0.438.2 ± 4.3(18)Dyspedic82333.0 ± 9.121.5 ± 1.48.3 ± 0.63.9 ± 0.2−11.0 ± 1.011.1 ± 0.312.3 ± 3.7(8)3d-RyR-11420190 ± 9.113.2 ± 0.94.9 ± 0.24.5 ± 0.3−0.6 ± 1.513.2 ± 0.544.6 ± 6.6(9)6d-RyR-11418252 ± 18 1aCompared to RyR-1 (3d) p < 0.005.14.9 ± 1.04.9 ± 0.37.2 ± 0.6aCompared to RyR-1 (3d) p < 0.005.4.3 ± 1.4bCompared to RyR-1 (3d) p < 0.05.13.4 ± 0.543.2 ± 4.9(10)3d-E4032A710190 ± 1917.5 ± 0.65.4 ± 0.64.7 ± 0.6−4.1 ± 3.213.5 ± 1.238.4 ± 4.7(6)6d-E4032A1211197 ± 1018.0 ± 1.25.0 ± 0.25.0 ± 0.4−5.4 ± 2.613.6 ± 1.140.2 ± 1.6(9)3–6d-E4032A1921194 ± 9.217.8 ± 0.85.1 ± 0.24.8 ± 0.3−4.8 ± 2.013.6 ± 0.839.5 ± 2.0(15)Values represent mean ± S.E.

Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The ability of DHPRs to function efficiently as Ca2+permeable L-channels is significantly enhanced by the presence of RyR-1 (retrograde signal of EC coupling; Refs. 2Nakai J. Dirksen R.T. Nguyen H.T. Pessah I.N. Beam K.G. Allen P.D. Nature. 1996; 380: 72-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To investigate whether or not the additional sarcolemmal DHPRs observed upon prolonged reintroduction of RyR-1 in dyspedic myotubes are functionally coupled to RyR-1, we compared L-current magnitudes in 3d-RyR-1- and 6d-RyR-1-expressing dyspedic myotubes. Fig.2 A shows representative L-currents that were obtained from 3d-RyR-1 (left) and 6d-RyR-1 (right) expressing myotubes. As illustrated in Fig.2, L-current density was significantly greater for 6d-RyR-1-expressing myotubes compared with 3d-RyR-1-expressing myotubes. On average, (Fig.2 B) peak L-current density increased from −8.5 ± 0.4 pA/pF (3 days; empty squares) to −12.5 ± 1.2 pA/pF (6 days; filled squares). This increase in L-current density arose primarily from a ∼30% increase in the maximal conductance of L-channels (Gmax) and was not accompanied by significant alterations in the voltage-dependence of L-channel activation (VG12and kG, see also Table I). Normal myotubes and 6d-RyR-1-expressing dyspedic myotubes displayed nearly identical peak L-current densities (−12.5 ± 1.2 pA/pF Vs −12.9 ± 1.4 pA/pF) and both Gmaxand Qmax values (Table I; see also Ref. 3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). To estimate the absolute levels of retrograde EC coupling for 3d-RyR-1- and 6d-RyR-1-expressing dyspedic myotubes, we normalized the L-current amplitudes by their respective Qmax values, to obtain the current-to-charge ratio (3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Following this normalization procedure, current-to-charge ratios were found to be similar for 3d-RyR-1- and 6d-RyR-1-expressing myotubes at every membrane potential (Fig.2 C). In addition, both experimental conditions exhibited nearly identical maximal conductance-to-charge ratios (Gmax/Qmax), which were similar to the corresponding value obtained for normal myotubes (Table I; see also Ref. 3Avila G. Dirksen R.T. J. Gen. Physiol. 2000; 115: 467-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). Consequently, no significant differences were found in either the current-to-charge or conductance-to-charge (Gmax/Qmax) ratios for normal myotubes or either 3d-RyR-1- or 6d-RyR-1-expressing myotubes. These results strongly suggest that a similar proportion of DHPRs interact with ryanodine receptors (as judged by the absolute levels of retrograde coupling) under these three conditions. Thus, the additional sarcolemmal DHPRs observed following long-term RyR-1 reintroduction into dyspedic myotubes represent primarily functional or RyR-1-coupled DHPRs. Normal myotubes express two main types of voltage-dependent calcium channels in the sarcolemma: L-channels and T-type calcium channels (T-channels). L-channels and T-channels exhibit distinct biophysical and pharmacological properties including thresholds of activ"
https://openalex.org/W1983293917,"Prior stress ameliorates caerulein-induced pancreatitis in rats. NF-κB is a proinflammatory transcription factor activated during caerulein pancreatitis. However, the effects of prior stress on pancreatic NF-κB activation are unknown. In the current study, the effect of prior water immersion stress on caerulein and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-induced NF-κB activation in the pancreas was evaluated. Water immersion of rats for up to 6 h prevents supramaximal caerulein-induced pancreatic IκB-α degradation and NF-κB activation in vivo. NF-κB activity is also inhibited in vitro in pancreatic acini prepared from water-immersed animals. TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in pancreas or in pancreatic acini is unaffected by prior water immersion. Chelation of intracellular Ca2+ by 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetate/acetoxymethyl ester has similar effects to water immersion in preventing caerulein but not TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation in pancreas. Both the spike response and the sustained rise in [Ca2+]i in response to supramaximal caerulein stimulation are reduced markedly in acini prepared from water-immersed animals as compared with normal animals. Our findings indicate that, in addition to Ca2+-dependent mechanisms, Ca2+-independent signaling events also may lead to NF-κB activation in pancreatic acinar cells. Water immersion stress prevents supramaximal caerulein-induced NF-κB activation in pancreas in vivo and in vitro by affecting intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis.

This model of pancreatitis, referred to as secretagogue-induced pancreatitis, is associated with and possibly brought about by intra-acinar cell activation of digestive enzyme zymogens including trypsinogen (1Hofbauer B. Saluja A.K. Lerch M.M. Bhagat L. Bhatia M. Lee H.S. Frossard J.L. Adler G. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G352-G362Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supramaximal stimulation of freshly prepared but otherwise normal pancreatic acini with caerulein also results in intra-acinar cell activation of trypsinogen and, subsequently, evidence of acinar cell injury in vitro(2Saluja A.K. Bhagat L. Lee H.S. Bhatia M. Frossard J.L. Steer M.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 276: G835-G842Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown recently that prior water immersion stress, under conditions that result in expression of heat shock protein 60 (HSP60),1 prevents caerulein-induced in vivo activation of trypsinogen in acinar cells and protects against this form of secretagogue-induced pancreatitis (3Lee H.S. Bhagat L. Frossard J.-L. Hietaranta A. Singh V.P. Steer M.L. Saluja A.K. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 220-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). Pancreatic acini prepared from prior water-immersed rats, which contain increased amounts of HSP60, are also protected against caerulein-induced in vitro activation of trypsinogen as well as caerulein-induced in vitro injury. The mechanism(s) responsible for this stress-induced protection against caerulein-induced injury has not been established. Nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a family of widely expressed transcription factors that acts to modulate inflammatory processes. Activation of NF-κB involves an intracytoplasmic kinase cascade that culminates in the phosphorylation of IκB proteins leading to their dissociation from NF-κB (4Karin M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 27339-27342Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (618) Google Scholar). As a result, the now activated NF-κB, which is comprised of dimers made up of various combinations of Rel homology-sharing subunits, can translocate to the nucleus and act to regulate expression of genes coding for various proinflammatory factors (5Grisham M.B. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 489-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). The phosphorylated IκBs are, in parallel, degraded by proteasome. Pancreatic acinar cell NF-κB activation has been reported to occur during the very early stages of caerulein-induced pancreatitis (6Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1402-G1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 7Steinle A.U. Weidenbach H. Wagner M. Adler G. Schmid R.M. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 420-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar) and evidence has been presented that suggests that prevention of caerulein-induced NF-κB activation in the pancreas can ameliorate the severity of caerulein-induced pancreatitis (6Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1402-G1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Supramaximal stimulation of acini in vitro with caerulein also causes activation of NF-κB by a mechanism that has been shown to involve a rise in cytoplasmic free calcium levels ([Ca2+]i) and activation of protein kinase C (8Tando Y. Algül H. Wagner M. Weidenbach H. Adler G. Schmid R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G678-G686PubMed Google Scholar, 9Han B. Logsdon G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C344-C351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In the present communication, we report studies that have evaluated the effects of prior water immersion stress, under conditions associated with up-regulated HSP60 expression, on the activation of pancreatic NF-κB. We show that prior water immersion stress prevents caerulein-induced in vivo NF-κB activation in the rat pancreas. Similarly, NF-κB activation in vitro is not observed when acini prepared from prior water-immersed animals are exposed to a supramaximally stimulating dose of caerulein. In contrast, NF-κB activation, both in vivo and in vitro, in response to TNF-α is not altered by prior water immersion. Finally, we show that prior water immersion stress markedly attenuates the acinar cell [Ca2+]i changes that follow exposure to a supramaximally stimulating dose of caerulein, and in acini prepared from animals not stressed by prior water immersion, chelation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM can prevent caerulein-induced NF-κB activation in those acini. Taken together, these observations lead us to conclude that water immersion stress prevents caerulein-induced NF-κB activation by interfering with caerulein-induced changes in [Ca2+]i. This phenomenon may contribute to the protective effects of water immersion on secretagogue-induced pancreatitis. Male Wistar rats weighing 100–200 g (Charles River Laboratories, Wilmington, MA) were used in all experiments. The animals were housed in temperature-controlled (23 ± 2 °C) rooms with a 12-h light/dark cycle, fed standard laboratory chow, and allowed to drink ad libitum. Caerulein was purchased from Research Plus (Bayonne, NJ), rat recombinant TNF-α was fromBIOSOURCE, collagenase (CLS-4) was from Worthington, and both Fura-2/AM and BAPTA/AM were from Molecular Probes (Ridgefield, CT). All other reagents and chemicals were purchased from Sigma. All experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Use Committee of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (Boston, MA). Rats were exposed to water immersion stress as described previously (3Lee H.S. Bhagat L. Frossard J.-L. Hietaranta A. Singh V.P. Steer M.L. Saluja A.K.

In brief, the animals were placed in restriction cages and vertically immersed to the xiphoid process. The duration of water immersion was 6 h in all experiments unless otherwise specified. Caerulein (50 μg/kg) and rat TNF-α (10 μg/kg) were dissolved in saline and administered as a single intraperitoneal dose to normal and water-immersed animals. Control animals received no injection. Animals were sacrificed in a CO2 chamber at various times after the injections, and pancreatic tissue samples were collected immediately. Dispersed rat pancreatic acini were prepared by collagenase digestion from normal rats or rats after 6 h of water immersion and studied as described previously (10Powers R.E. Saluja A.K.

The acini were allowed to equilibrate for 5 min at 37 °C and then were stimulated with either caerulein (0.1 μm) or TNF-α (200 ng/ml). Other acini were preincubated with BAPTA/AM (50 μm) for 30 min at 37 °C before adding caerulein or TNF-α. After an additional 30 or 90 min of incubation, the acini were washed in ice-cold HEPES-Ringer buffer, and nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared. Viability of acini after washing, as assessed by trypan blue exclusion, was >95%. For evaluation of NF-κB activation and IκB-α degradation, nuclear and cytoplasmic protein extracts were prepared as described by Dyer and Herzog (13Dyer R.B. Herzog N.K. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 192-195PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the method of Bradford (14Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (214515) Google Scholar). For [Ca2+]i measurements, pancreatic acini from normal and water-immersed rats were loaded with 2 μmFura-2/AM for 30 min at 37 °C and then washed extensively. [Ca2+]i was quantitated using a Spex dual excitation spectrofluorometer as described previously (11Dawra R.K. Saluja A.K. Rünzi M. Steer M.L. J. Biol.

Reaction mixtures (25 μl, pH 7.5) contained 7.5–10.0 μg of nuclear protein, 5 mm Tris, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 4% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.08 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA. The oligonucleotide probe (5′-AGT TGA GGG GAC TTT CCC AGG C-3′, Promega, Madison, WI) containing the κB binding motif was end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase and purified over two successive 1-ml G-50 columns (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). 1 × 106 cpm of the probe was added to the reaction mixture, and the binding reaction was allowed to proceed for 20 min at room temperature. For supershift assays, 2 μl of specific antibody against NF-κB subunits p50, p52, p65, or c-Rel (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) was added to the reaction mixture and the resulting solution was allowed to incubate for 30 min at 4 °C before adding the oligonucleotide probe. DNA-protein complexes were resolved in a 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel in a TBE buffer (22.5 mm Tris, 22.5 mm boric acid, and 0.5 mm EDTA, pH 8.3) at 140 V for 2–3 h. Gels were dried and exposed to Kodak Bio Max MR films at −70 °C. NF-κB bands from films were quantitated by using an HP Scanjet 4100 scanner and a Scion image analysis program. Equal amounts of cytoplasmic protein extracts (5–10 μg) were diluted in Laemmli sample buffer with 5% mercaptoethanol. After boiling, the samples were resolved in 10% polyacrylamide gels in Tris-glycine-SDS buffer. The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 5% nonfat dry milk in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.5, containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween 20 (PBST-milk). Blots then were incubated with polyclonal rabbit anti-IκB-α antibody (sc-371, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) at 1:1000 (v/v) dilution in PBST-milk at 4 °C overnight. The membranes then were washed in PBST and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 1:5000 (v/v) dilution in PBST-milk for 1 h. After washing, IκB-α protein bands in the membranes were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The results reported in this communication represent means ± S.E. of the mean values obtained from three or more separate experiments. In all figures, vertical barsdenote S.E. values. Statistical evaluation of data was accomplished by analysis of variance, and p values of less than 0.05 were considered significant. All EMSA and Western blot gels shown are representative of at least three such gels prepared from independent experiments. In preliminary experiments, rats were exposed to a supramaximally stimulating dose of caerulein (50 μg/kg) and sacrificed at various times thereafter. Activation of pancreatic NF-κB and degradation of IκB-α were observed to occur in a biphasic manner with an initial peak of 30 min (11.1 ± 1.8-fold control) after caerulein administration, a subsequent decline, and then a second phase of increase that reached a maximal level between 90 min (9.4 ± 1.5-fold control) and 180 min (8.7 ± 1.7-fold control) after caerulein administration. These observations are in accord with those reported recently by Gukovsky et al. (6Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1402-G1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In our subsequent experiments, NF-κB activation and the effects of water immersion stress on this process were evaluated at the selected times of 30 and 90 min after caerulein administration. As shown in Fig. 1, prior water immersion profoundly inhibits the NF-κB activation and IκB-α degradation observed 30 as well as 90 min after caerulein administration. The time course of the water immersion-induced blockade of caerulein-induced NF-κB activation is shown in Fig. 2. Half-maximal inhibition is observed after ∼3 h of water immersion, and at that time water immersion-induced HSP60 expression is also approximately half-maximal (Fig. 2 B). In contrast to these effects on caerulein-induced NF-κB activation, TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation and IκB-α degradation are not altered by prior water immersion (Fig. 3).Figure 2Time-dependent effects of water immersion on caerulein-induced NF-κB activation.

To evaluate this possibility, supershift assays were performed using antibodies to the p50, p52, p65, and c-Rel subunits of the NF-κB. As shown in Fig.4 and in accord with results reported by others (6Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1402-G1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Han B. Logsdon C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C74-C82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), the caerulein- or cholecystokinin-induced activation of NF-κB involves p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers. p50/p50 and p50/p65 dimers are involved also in the TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. These observations indicate that caerulein and TNF-α activate the same species of NF-κB in rat pancreas. Acini were prepared from control rats and from rats immediately after 6 h of water immersion stress. Those acini then were exposed to a supramaximally stimulating concentration of caerulein or to TNF-α in vitro, and NF-κB activation was evaluated 30 or 90 min later. As shown in Fig. 5, caerulein-induced NF-κB activation and IκB-α degradation are not observed in acini prepared from prior water-immersed animals, but water immersion does not interfere with either TNF-α-induced degradation of IκB-α or activation of NF-κB. Freshly prepared acini obtained from control (i.e. not water-immersed) animals were incubated with the Ca2+chelator BAPTA/AM and then exposed to either caerulein or TNF-α. As shown in Fig. 6, chelation of intracellular Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM, which prevents the caerulein-induced rise in [Ca2+]i (11Dawra R.K. Saluja A.K. Rünzi M. Steer M.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20237-20242Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), prevents caerulein- but not TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation. Freshly prepared acini were loaded with Fura-2/AM, washed, and then incubated with a supramaximally stimulating concentration of caerulein. As shown in Fig.7, when those acini were prepared from control animals, caerulein causes a large but transient rise in [Ca2+]i, which is followed by a sustained but lesser elevation of [Ca2+]i that persists throughout the period of observation. The resting [Ca2+]i in acini prepared from water-immersed animals is lower than that observed in acini prepared from the control group, and both the peak and the sustained increases in [Ca2+]i noted after caerulein addition are attenuated profoundly. Otaka et al. (17Otaka M. Itoh H. Kuwabara T. Zeniya A. Fujimori S. Otani S. Tashima Y. Masamune O. Int. J. Biochem. 1994; 26: 805-811Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), in 1994, reported the results of studies that indicated that HSP60 expression in the rat pancreas was up-regulated by prior water immersion stress and that water immersion stress protected those animals from subsequent caerulein-induced pancreatitis. Recently, in studies designed to explore the mechanism(s) responsible for the protective effect of water immersion on pancreatitis, we found that caerulein-induced intrapancreatic trypsinogen activation, an early event in secretagogue-induced pancreatitis, was prevented by prior water immersion (3Lee H.S. Bhagat L. Frossard J.-L. Hietaranta A. Singh V.P. Steer M.L. Saluja A.K. Gastroenterology. 2000; 119: 220-229Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We noted that this prevention of trypsinogen activation was correlated temporally with the up-regulation of HSP60 expression. Furthermore, we found that the effects of prior water immersion could be detected in acini studiedin vitro. That is, intra-acinar cell activation of trypsinogen and cell injury were observed when acini from non-water-immersed animals were exposed to a supramaximally stimulating concentration of caerulein in vitro, but neither trypsinogen activation nor cell injury was observed when acini prepared from water-immersed animals were exposed in vitro to a supramaximally stimulating concentration of caerulein (3Lee H.S.

The currently reported studies were designed to examine further the mechanisms responsible for the protective effect of water immersion on secretagogue-induced pancreatitis. NF-κB is a widely expressed transcription factor that in many systems has been shown to play a critical role in regulating inflammatory processes by modulating the expression of genes coding for inflammatory mediators including cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules (5Grisham M.B. Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 489-492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar,18Pahl H.L. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 6853-6866Crossref PubMed Scopus (3427) Google Scholar). Studies from several groups have indicated that activation of pancreatic acinar cell NF-κB is an early event in secretagogue-induced pancreatitis. In a recent study we showed that although caerulein-induced trypsinogen activation and NF-κB activation are closely related temporally, they are independent events in pancreatic acinar cells (19Hietaranta A.J. Saluja A.K. Bhagat L. Singh V.P. Song A.M. Steer M.L. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 2001; 280: 388-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although still somewhat controversial (6Gukovsky I.

Gastroenterology. 1999; 116: 420-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), the preponderance of evidence suggests that NF-κB activation is a proinflammatory event in this model of pancreatitis and that interventions that interfere with acinar cell NF-κB activation reduce the severity of secretagogue-induced pancreatitis (6Gukovsky I.

Pancreatic acinar cell NF-κB activation by supramaximally stimulating doses of caerulein or cholecystokinin has been examined recently by several groups, and the results of their studies have shown that (a) activation depends on a rise in acinar cell [Ca2+]i and activation of protein kinase C (8Tando Y. Algül H. Wagner M. Weidenbach H. Adler G. Schmid R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G678-G686PubMed Google Scholar,9Han B. Logsdon G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C344-C351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), (b) activation is accompanied by degradation of IκB-α (8Tando Y. Algül H. Wagner M. Weidenbach H. Adler G. Schmid R.M. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: G678-G686PubMed Google Scholar, 9Han B. Logsdon G.D. Am. J. Physiol. 2000; 278: C344-C351Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), and (c) the NF-κB dimers activated in this process are composed of p50 and p65 subunits (6Gukovsky I. Gukovskaya A.S. Blinman T.A. Zaninovic V. Pandol S.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: G1402-G1414Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Han B. Logsdon C.D. Am. J. Physiol. 1999; 277: C74-C82Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Pancreatic acinar cell NF-κB also can be activated by TNF-α (21Gukovskaya A.S. Gukovsky I. Zaninovic V. Song M. Sandoval D. Gukovsky S. Pandol S.J. J. Clin. Invest. 1997; 100: 1853-1862Crossref PubMed Scopus (340) Google Scholar), but this process has not been studied as extensively. Our own results (Figs.Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5) indicate that TNF-α also promotes IκB-α degradation and translocation of p50/p50 and p50/p65 NF-κB dimers into the nucleus. These observations suggest that caerulein and TNF-α activate the same species of NF-κB and that the final steps in activation (i.e. activation of IκB kinase and phosphorylation of IκB-α leading to dissociation of IκB-α from NF-κB and degradation of IκB-α) are similar for caerulein- and TNF-α-induced activation of NF-κB. The currently reported studies indicate that the activation of pancreatic acinar cell NF-κB by supramaximally stimulating doses of caerulein both in vivo (Figs. Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3) and in vitro(Fig. 5) is inhibited by prior water immersion. Under these conditions, HSP60 expression is up-regulated and the time course of HSP60 expression after water immersion stress roughly correlates with that of prevention of NF-κB activation (Fig. 2). It is tempting, therefore, to speculate and simplify these observations by concluding that HSP60 mediates the process by which NF-κB activation is inhibited, but this conclusion can only be tentative because water immersion stress also might set in motion other as yet unidentified events that prevent NF-κB activation beside HSP60 expression. Further studies will be needed before the relationship between HSP60 expression and prevention of caerulein-induced NF-κB activation can be defined more clearly and unambiguously. Although the role of HSP60 in the events triggered by water immersion stress remains uncertain, the studies reported in this communication still provide some insights into the mechanisms by which water immersion stress affects NF-κB activation. Our studies indicate that water immersion stress interferes with caerulein-induced NF-κB activation, but it does not alter TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation either in vivo (Figs. 1 and 3) or in vitro (Fig.5). This finding suggests that water immersion stress affects the activation process at a step that occurs before IκB kinase activation and IκB-α phosphorylation because, as noted above, these steps seem to be shared by both the TNF-α- and caerulein-induced NF-κB activation process. The finding that caerulein-induced NF-κB activation but not TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation can be blocked by chelation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM (Fig. 6) indicates that the two pathways for NF-κB activation differ in their requirement for a rise in [Ca2+]i, and this observation suggested to us that prior water immersion stress might interfere with caerulein-induced NF-κB activation by interfering with caerulein-induced [Ca2+]i changes in pancreatic acinar cells. To examine this possibility, [Ca2+]i changes in acini prepared from control and water-immersed animals were evaluated (Fig. 7). Prior water immersion was found to reduce the resting [Ca2+]ilevel in acini and to attenuate markedly the caerulein-induced rise in [Ca2+]i. This observation leads us to conclude that prior water immersion prevents caerulein-induced NF-κB activation by interfering with caerulein-induced [Ca2+]i changes and to suggest that this may at least in part explain the protection against caerulein-induced pancreatitis that is afforded by prior water immersion. In summary, our studies indicate that supramaximally stimulating doses of caerulein and TNF-α activate the same species of NF-κB in pancreatic acinar cells but that they do so by different mechanisms. Caerulein-induced activation is a Ca2+-dependent process, whereas TNF-α-induced activation is independent of a rise in [Ca2+]i. Prior water immersion stress induces HSP60 expression and also prevents caerulein-induced NF-κB activation. We suggest that prior water immersion stress prevents caerulein-induced NF-κB activation by interfering with the caerulein-induced rise in [Ca2+]i, which is critical to that event. Chelation of cytoplasmic Ca2+ with BAPTA/AM can bring about the same effect. The reduction in caerulein-induced [Ca2+]i rise and the activation of NF-κB that follows water immersion stress is correlated with the rise in HSP60 expression that also follows water immersion stress, but whether HSP60 actually mediates the effects of water immersion stress on Ca2+ dynamics and NF-κB activation will require further studies."
https://openalex.org/W2010275946,"We have identified a novel isoform of rat caspase-9 in which the C terminus of full-length caspase-9 is replaced with an alternative peptide sequence. Casp-9-CTD (where CTD is carboxyl-terminal divergent) is expressed in multiple tissues, with the relative highest expression observed in ovary and heart. Casp-9-CTD was found primarily in the cytoplasm and was not detected in the nucleus. Structural predictions suggest that in contrast to full-length caspase-9, casp-9-CTD will not be processed. Our model is supported by reduced protease activity of casp-9-CTD preparations in vitro and by the lack of detectable processing of casp-9-CTD proenzyme or the induction of cell death following transfection into cells. Both neuronal and non-neuronal cell types transfected with casp-9-CTD were resistant to death evoked by trophic factor deprivation or DNA damage. In addition, cytosolic lysates prepared from cells permanently expressing exogenous casp-9-CTD were resistant to caspase induction by cytochrome c in reconstitution assays. Taken together, our observations indicate that casp-9-CTD acts as a dominant-negative variant. Its expression in various tissues indicates a physiological role in regulating cell death.

Apoptosis is a physiological form of cell death that serves a number of functions, including tissue development and remodeling, cellular homeostasis, and removal of damaged cells. In regular animal development, cell death is involved not only in morphogenesis, but also in optimizing function of the nervous and immune systems (for review, see Refs. 1Green D.R. Reed J.C. Science. 1998; 281: 1309-1312Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Apoptosis requires regulated activation of members of a family of cysteine proteases (caspases) that cleave cellular substrates at the carboxyl side of Asp residues, thereby initiating and executing an apoptotic death program. Caspases are produced in cells as full-length zymogens in a poorly active or inactive form, but autocleavage and processing by other proteases yield active enzyme. The processing normally involves the removal of an N-terminal prodomain and cleavage of the remaining protein sequence to yield large and small subunits (for review, see Refs. 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar and 3Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 10964-10967Crossref PubMed Scopus (773) Google Scholar). Proteolytic cleavage between these protein domains results in caspase activation by formation of heterotetramers composed of small and large subunits, but it has been shown for caspase-9 activation that caspase activity in vitro is observed also in the absence of caspase processing (4Stennicke H.R.

There are presently 14 known caspase family members, and each has distinguishable enzymatic properties and substrate specificities (for review, see Ref. 2Thornberry N.A. Lazebnik Y. Science. 1998; 281: 1312-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (6182) Google Scholar). Depending on the mode of activation or downstream effectors, caspase cascades have been identified that involve the orchestrated activation of downstream caspases by upstream initiator proteases. Of these, caspase-9 appears to be one of the major initiators of cell death cascades in diverse apoptotic paradigms, and transgenic as well as null animal models exhibit significant phenotypes that underscore its importance (for review, see Ref. 5Zheng T.S. Hunot S. Kuida K. Flavell R.A. Cell Death Differ. 1999; 6: 1043-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). A wide array of apoptotic stimuli lead to release of cytochrome c (and in certain cell types, even caspase-9) from mitochondria, and its presence in the cytosol induces the formation of a multimeric complex that consists of caspase-9, the caspase-9/cytochrome c-binding protein Apaf-1 (apoptotic protease-activatingfactor-1), and accessory proteins. Caspase-9 is activated during the formation of the complex and subsequently cleaves and activates downstream death-promoting executioner caspases such as caspase-3, -6, and -7 (6Slee E.A. Harte M.T.

Considering the importance of self-association and complex formation with downstream substrates for the regulation and consequences of caspase-9 activity, it is not surprising that catalytically inactive forms inhibit the activation of downstream executioner caspases and inhibit cell death.

Tischler A.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1976; 73: 2424-2428Crossref PubMed Scopus (4873) Google Scholar) in collagen-coated dishes with RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal bovine serum. Neuronal differentiation was induced with 100 ng/ml human recombinant NGF (a kind gift of Genentech). Rat-1a cells, Rat-1a cells overexpressing c-myc (a gift from Dr. R. Dalla-Favera, Columbia University), and 293 cells were grown in DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum. To clone rat full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD, primers 5′-TCTATGGCACAGATGGATGCTC-3′ and 5′-ATGGATGCTCCGTGTCCATCGA-3′ were used for 3′-RACE and nested 3′-RACE amplification. For 5′-RACE, primer sets 5′-CTCCCAGGCTGGGGCAGCCGG-3′ and 5′CAGCCGGTCCCATTGAAGAT-3′, 5′-CATGTCTCTCGATCTTCCTGG-3′ and 5′-AGTACAGACATCATGAGCTCC-3′, and 5′-CTCTAAGCAGGAGATGAAGC-3′ and 5′-CTCGAGTCTCAAGATCTATGAC-3′ were used in serial PCRs. The open reading frames of full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD were cloned from rat brain mRNA or from total RNA isolated from rat tissues. PCR was conducted with primers 5′-GAATTCCAGCAATCCGCTAGCCATGGAGG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCAACTCATGAAGTTTAAAGAACAG-3′ for full-length caspase-9 and with 5′-GAATTCGCAGCCAACTCAGATCTTGCTA-3′ as the reverse primer for casp-9-CTD. All PCR products were sequenced. The cysteine residue in the QACGG active-site motif of full-length caspase-9 was mutated to alanine by overlapping PCR using primers 5′-CATCCAGGCCGCTGGTGGTGAGCAGAAA-3′ and 5′-TTTCTGCTCACCACCAGCGGCCTGGATG-3′. Primers 5′-GAATTCCAGCAATCCGCTAGCCATGGAGG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTCATTTGTCATCATCTCCTTGTAGTCCATTCCTGAAGTTTTA-3′ were used to generate the FLAG epitope tag. Casp-9-CTD was FLAG-tagged using the primer pair 5′-GAATTCCAGCAATCCGCTAGCCATGGAGG-3′ and 5′-GAATTCTCATTTGTCATCATCGTCCTTGTAGTCCATCCCGGCCTTTGGTGG-3′. The open reading frames of full-length caspase-9, caspase-9(C327A)-FLAG, casp-9-CTD, and casp-9-CTD-FLAG were subcloned into theEcoRI sites of the pCMS-EGFP vector or into pcDNA3.0 for eukaryotic expression. Human full-length caspase-3 (16Tewari M. Quan L.T. O'Rourke K. Desnoyers S. Zeng Z. Beidler D.R. Poirier G.G. Salvesen G.S. Dixit V.M. Cell. 1995; 81: 801-809Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2279) Google Scholar), rat caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD, and active-site mutants of caspase-9 enzymes (C327A) were fused with a C-terminal His6 epitope into pET23b for expression in E. coli BL21(DE3) pLys (8Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 25719-25723Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). For caspase-3, primers 5′-ATGAATTCGGGTGATAAAAATAGA-3′ and 5′-ATGAATTCGGGTGATAAAAATAGA-3′ were used; for caspase-9, primers 5′-ATCGAATTCGGAGGAGGCTGACCGG-3′ and 5′-CTTGTCGACTGAAGTTTTAAAGAA-3′ were used; and for casp-9-CTD, primers 5′-ATCGAATTCGGAGGAGGCTGACCGG-3′ and 5′-CTTGTCGACGGCCTTTGGTGGGGA-3′ were used. Active-site mutants were generated in pET23B using the above primers for caspase-9 or primers 5′-TTCTTCATCCAGGCCGCAGGTGGTGGTGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCACCACCACCTGCGGCCTGGATGAAGAA-3′ for casp-9-CTD. pCMS-EGFP-full-length caspase-9 and pCMS-EGFP-casp-9-CTD vectors were mixed with single-step T7 promoter-driven TNT-coupled reagents (Promega) and with [35S]methionine (1000 Ci/mmol). The protocol was carried out as recommended by the supplier. 25% of the radiolabeled mixture of full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD was resolved on 4–20% Novex gradient gels. The gel was then dried and exposed to x-ray film. Following IPTG induction (caspase-3 at 0.2 mm IPTG for 45 min and caspase-9 isoforms at 0.4 mm IPTG for 1.5 h at 30 °C), caspases were purified from bacterial cell lysates using standard metal-chelating affinity chromatography and an imidazole gradient as the eluent as described (17Stennicke H.R. Salvesen G.S. Methods. 1999; 17: 313-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). Following imidazole elution, purified caspases were dialyzed against caspase buffer (20 mm Hepes, 100 mm KCl, 10 mmdithiothreitol, 1 mm EDTA, 0.1% Chaps, and 10% sucrose, pH 7.2) and stored as concentrated aliquots in caspase buffer. Enzyme concentrations were determined by active-site titration using benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD-fluoromethyl ketone or by comparison with known amounts of caspase enzymes using Western blotting. Caspase activity assays were performed at 37 °C in 50-μl reaction volume using 0.2 mm synthetic peptide or caspase-3 as a substrate. For comparison of different AMC-coupled substrate peptides, an end point analysis was performed in a Turner TD-700 fluorometer using an excitation wavelength of 365 nm and an emission wavelength filter of 455–500 nm after a 30-min incubation at 37 °C. The reaction rates of hydrolysis of Ac-DEVD-pNA or Ac-DEVD-AFC substrate peptides were determined using a Beckman DU530 spectrophotometer equipped with a Peltier temperature module in kinetic rate mode. Liberated pNA or AFC was recorded at A 405 nm orA 380 nm in 5-s intervals, respectively, and the concentrations of pNA and AFC were calculated using a standard concentration curve. The activity of caspase-3-like enzymes in reconstituted cell lysates was determined as described previously (18Stennicke H.R. Jurgensmeier J.M. Shin H. Deveraux Q. Wolf B.B. Yang X. Zhou Q. Ellerby H.M. Ellerby L.M. Bredesen D. Green D.R. Reed J.C. Froelich C.J. Salvesen G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 27084-27090Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (647) Google Scholar). In brief, concentrated cytoplasmic protein lysates were obtained by resuspending PC12 control cells and polyclonal PC12 cell cultures expressing casp-9-CTD-FLAG at 4 °C in hypotonic cell lysis buffer (20 mm Pipes, 10 mm KCl, 5 mm EDTA, 2 mm MgCl2, and 1 mmdithiothreitol, pH 7.4), followed by cell lysis and centrifugation at 13,000 × g. 293 cells were transfected using calcium phosphate as described (19Angelastro J.M. Ho C.L. Frappier T. Liem R.K. Greene L.A. J. Neurochem. 1998; 70: 540-549Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). For PC12 cells, transfection with 10 μg of plasmid/well was performed after 2 days of NGF treatment for NGF-differentiated PC12 cells or immediately after plating for naive cells. PC12 and Rat-1a cells were transfected using LipofectAMINE 2000. After 9 h for PC12 cells and 5 h for Rat-1a cells, medium with LipofectAMINE 2000 was exchanged for fresh medium with NGF or insulin or with serum containing DMEM for NGF-treated naive PC12 cells and Rat-1a fibroblasts. On day 3 after transfection for PC12 cells or on day 2 for Rat-1a fibroblasts, cultures were washed 5–10 times with RPMI 1640 medium for PC12 cells or with DMEM for Rat-1a cells. The cells were scraped from their dishes and replated onto collagen-coated 15-mm wells at 2 × 105 cells/well. For PC12 cells, trophic factor-deprived cultures were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium, and the control nondeprived cells were grown with NGF or NGF/insulin for NGF-differentiated or naive cells. Rat-1a and Rat-1a c-myc-overexpressing fibroblasts remained in DMEM only. PC12 cells (100-mm plates) were transfected with 28 μg of rat casp-9-CTD-FLAG cloned into the pcDNA3.0 plasmid or with empty pcDNA3.0 plasmid. After 1 week, permanently transfected cells were selected for neomycin resistance using 500 μg/ml G418 (Cellgro). The surviving cells were expanded to establish clonal lined or polyclonal mass cultures. Cells were tested for expression of FLAG-tagged casp-9-CTD by Western blot analysis with anti-FLAG and anti-caspase-9 antibodies. Survival in the absence of serum was determined by counting intact nuclei after 2 days (20Greene L.A. Farinelli S.E. Cunningham M.E. Park D.S. Banker G.G.K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 161-187Google Scholar). 293 or PC12 cells were harvested in Laemmli sample buffer, and concentration of proteins was measured by the Bio-Rad method. The proteins were resolved by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis using a 4–20% gradient gel and transferred onto nitrocellulose according to standard procedures. The nitrocellulose membrane was stained with Ponceau S to locate proteins; cut into sections; and blocked with 5% milk in PBS, pH 7.4, at room temperature for 1 h. The blot was probed with anti-caspase-9 p20 antiserum (Bur73, a kind gift from Guy Salvesen, Burnham Institute, San Diego, CA) for 293 cells or with anti-FLAG antibody for PC12 cells, followed by ECL, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The numbers of healthy, non-apoptotic, EGFP-positive cells in a defined strip across the culture were assessed by phase and fluorescence microscopy. The same strip was scored each day during the time course, and the percentage of surviving cells was calculated relative to the number present in the same well at 1.5 h after plating (20Greene L.A. Farinelli S.E. Cunningham M.E. Park D.S. Banker G.G.K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 161-187Google Scholar, 21Troy C.M. Stefanis L. Greene L.A. Shelanski M.L. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 1911-1918Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). At various time points, PC12 or Rat-1a cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 10 min and then, after washing with PBS, exposed to 10% nonimmune goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 30 min at room temperature (20Greene L.A. Farinelli S.E. Cunningham M.E. Park D.S. Banker G.G.K. Culturing Nerve Cells. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA1998: 161-187Google Scholar). Staining for FLAG fusion protein was carried out for 1–2 h at room temperature with 20 μg/ml anti-Flag antibody in PBS containing 10% nonimmune goat serum and 0.2% Triton X-100, followed by a 1-h exposure to rhodamine-labeled secondary antibody (1:100 dilution). To visualize nuclear DNA, the fixed cells were incubated with Hoechst dye 33342 at 1 μg/ml in PBS and 0.08% Triton X-100 for 15 min at room temperature. Cells possessing condensed nuclei and fragmented chromatin were scored as apoptotic. Data are presented as the proportion of either EGFP- or FLAG-expressing cells with apoptotic nuclei. Efforts aimed at the cloning of a full-length cDNA of rat caspase-9 by 5′- and 3′-RACE/PCR led to the discovery of a rat caspase-9 variant cDNA that encodes an alternative C-terminal sequence immediately following the QACGG active site (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AY008275) (Fig.1 A, lower sequence). This alternative C terminus (amino acids 327–383) shows no homology to other reported sequences, including those previously reported for full-length caspase-9 or other short forms of caspase-9. From the N-terminal methionine through QACGG, the predicted protein sequence is identical to rat full-length caspase-9 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AF308469) (Fig.1 A, upper sequence). The variant was independently confirmed by 3′-RACE/PCR from rat PC12 cells and by PCR from rat brains, in each case using multiple alternative primer pairs (data not shown). RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing also detected the variant in several different rat tissues, including adult liver and ovary, and in whole rat embryos (see also Fig. 3). We have designated the novel variant as casp-9-CTD for caspase-9 carboxyl-terminal divergent. A portion of the casp-9-CDT 5′-UTR (16 base pairs) was sequenced, and this showed complete identity to the corresponding sequence of full-length caspase-9 (Fig. 1 A). In contrast, the 3′-UTR of casp-9-CTD contains no similarity to the 3′-UTR of the full-length form, thus suggesting that the variant C terminus of casp-9-CTD is derived from an alternative exon of the rat caspase-9 gene. Furthermore, Southern blots of rat genomic DNA showed a single distinct band when hybridized with a probe shared by sequences of both forms of caspase-9 (Fig. 1 A). The failure to detect any additional hybridizing bands using these enzymes and the fact that the 5′-UTR sequences of both cDNAs are identical suggest the presence of a single caspase-9 gene in the rat genome that gives rise to both full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD by alternative splicing.Figure 3Tissue expression and characterization of casp-9-CTD protein. A: expression of rat full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD was determined by RT-PCR using total RNA from the indicated rat tissues and PC12 cells, either without treatment (naive) or following 1 week of exposure to NGF. RT-PCR using β-actin-specific primers is shown as a standard. B:left panel, full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD were labeled with [35S]methionine following in vitro transcription and translation. Labeled proteins were resolved on a 4–20% gradient gel and detected by autoradiography.Right panel, control vector and casp-9-CTD were transiently transfected into 293 cells. After 24 h, cells were lysed, and cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-caspase-9 antiserum and ECL.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Alternative short isoforms of caspase-9 are catalytically inactive and act as endogenous inhibitors of caspase-9 activation. These isoforms include a human isoform (caspase-9S, caspase-9b, CASP9, or caspase-9β; GenBankTM/EBI accession numbers AF110376,AF093130, AB020979, and AB015653, respectively) that is most likely derived from human full-length caspase-9 by omission of exons 3–6 (Fig. 1 B). The ability of the human short isoform to act as an endogenous inhibitor is not surprising considering that the omission of these exons will result in the deletion of its active site. A short variant of mouse caspase-9 has been reported (Fig. 1 B) that appears to be generated by deletion of 107 nucleotides and a resulting frameshift within sequences encoding the small caspase subunit (GenBankTM/EBI accession number AB019601). This mutant form, however, differs from the variant that we have identified in that a transcript is not normally seen in mouse embryos or tissues (11Fujita E. Jinbo A. Matuzaki H. Konishi H. Kikkawa U. Momoi T. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1999; 264: 550-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). In contrast, the variant of rat caspase-9 that we have observed was present at varying expression levels in various rat tissues and cell lines, and it was also detected at different stages in rat embryos (see also Fig. 3 A). A closer examination of the predicted amino acid sequence of rat casp-9-CTD reveals that the alternative carboxyl terminus does not contain the two aspartic acid residues that are present in the full-length forms of caspase-9 (Fig. 1 A). These residues are required for the processing of the zymogen into large (p37) and small (p12) subunits that are necessary for the formation of a fully activated enzyme (4Stennicke H.R. Deveraux Q.L.

Using the Smith-Waterman algorithm for sequence alignment (22Smith T.F. Waterman M.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1981; 147: 195-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (7200) Google Scholar), we detected similarities of 51.7 and 53.7% between the predicted protein sequence of human caspase-3 (GenBankTM/EBI accession number U26493) and those of rat caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD, respectively. Using PrISM (protein informatics system formodeling) (23Yang A.-S. Honig B. Proteins Suppl. 1999; 3: 66-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar), we were able to unambiguously compute a model for the protease domain of both caspase-9 isoforms using the known structures of human caspase-3 (24Rotonda J. Nicholson D.W. Fazil K.M. Gallant M. Gareau Y. Labelle M. Peterson E.P. Rasper D.M. Ruel R. Vaillancourt J.P. Thornberry N.A. Becker J.W. Nat. Struct.

Chem. 1997; 272: 6539-6547Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (223) Google Scholar) as a template. A further analysis of casp-9-CTD using PrISM did not predict any alternative secondary structure for the divergent C-terminal domain in the context of the casp-9-CTD protein. Thus, it is unlikely that the alternative C terminus in casp-9-CTD protein will contribute to the formation of a small subunit or any other predictable secondary structure (Fig.2). To compare the tissue distributions of rat full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD, we conducted semiquantitative RT-PCR using primers that span the open reading frames of each form using total RNA from various tissues (Fig.3 A). Products corresponding to the predicted size were detected in all tissues examined. The identity of the 1188-base pair casp-9-CTD product was confirmed by sequence analysis. A fast migrating DNA product was also detected using these primer pairs, but it encoded an unrelated DNA product. Expression of casp-9-CTD was consistently highest in ovary, whereas the relative ratio of casp-9-CTD to full-length caspase-9 was highest in heart and ovary. The presence of casp-9-CTD transcripts in PC12 cells was confirmed, but we did not find regulation by NGF (Fig. 3 A). 5′- and 3′-RACE/PCR as well as Western blotting confirmed the presence of full-length caspase-9 in PC12 cells (data not shown). The molecular masses of full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD were predicted to be 50.4 and 42.3 kDa, respectively, using PeptideMass (26Wilkins M.R. Lindskog I. Gasteiger E. Bairoch A. Sanchez J.C. Hochstrasser D.F. Appel R.D. Electrophoresis. 1997; 18: 403-408Crossref PubMed Scopus (298) Google Scholar). In vitro transcription and translation followed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis revealed apparent molecular masses of ∼45 kDa for rat casp-9-CTD and ∼55 kDa for full-length caspase-9 (Fig. 3 B). Similar results were obtained with protein expressed in E. coli or after transient transfection of casp-9-CTD into 293 cells (Fig.3 B). In transient transfections, however, we detected only cleavage of full-length caspase-9, possibly because of autoprocessing (data not shown). To examine the subcellular distribution of casp-9-CTD, a C-terminal FLAG construct was transiently transfected into PC12 (Fig.4 A) and Rat-1a (data not shown) cells and visualized by staining with an anti-FLAG antibody. To facilitate comparison with full-length caspase-9, we used a full-length, FLAG-tagged form of rat caspase-9 that is rendered catalytically inactive by mutation of the cysteine residue within the QACGG active site (C327A) and that will not induce cell death (see also Figs. 6 and 7). Confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed that casp-9-CTD was localized to the cytoplasm and excluded from the nucleus, whereas full-length caspase-9(C327A) was detected in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. These observations indicate that full-length caspase-9 and casp-9-CTD differ in their subcellular distributions and underscore the potential contribution of the C terminus in regulating nuclear localization. Similar results were obtained following subcellular fractionation of lysates from transiently transfected cells, followed by Western blot analysis (data not shown).Figure 6Casp-9-CTD expression protects neuronal cells from apoptosis. A, replicate cultures of PC12 cells were transfected with the indicated FLAG-tagged constructs (caspase-9(C327A) and casp-9-CTD in the pCMS-EGFP vector) and maintained with insulin in serum-free medium. After 72 h, half the cultures were deprived of insulin, and half were treated with insulin/NGF. Cells were then evaluated for the expression of EGFP and the FLAG tag and the presence of apoptotic nuclei. Values represent percentages of EGFP-expressing or FLAG-tagged protease-expressing cells with apoptotic nuclei. Comparable results were achieved in an independent experiment. B, replicate PC12 cell cultures were exposed to NGF for 2 days in serum-free medium, transfected as described for A, and maintained for an additional 3 days in serum-free medium with NGF. The cells were extensively washed free of NGF and serum and replated with or without NGF. Cultures were evaluated as described for A for percentages of transfected cell"
https://openalex.org/W2040026682,"The Wilms tumor gene WT1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor that is required for normal kidney development. WT1 was identified as a transcriptional repressor, based on its suppression of promoter reporters, but analysis of native transcripts using high density microarrays has uncovered transcriptional activation, rather than repression, of potential target genes. We report here that WT1 binds to the transcriptional coactivator CBP, leading to synergistic activation of a physiologically relevant promoter. The physical interaction between WT1 and CBP is evident in vitro and in vivo, and the two proteins are co-immunoprecipitated from embryonic rat kidney cells. The WT1-CBP association requires the first two zinc fingers of WT1 and the adenovirus 5 E1A-binding domain of CBP. Overexpression of this domain of CBP is sufficient to inhibit WT1-mediated transcriptional activation of a promoter reporter, as is co-transfection of E1A. Retrovirally driven expression of either the CBP fragment or of E1A in human hematopoietic cells suppresses the induction by WT1 of its endogenous target gene, p21Cip1.

In the developing kidney, WT1 is present at low levels in blastemal stem cells, and very high levels of expression are observed as these cells differentiate to form glomerular podocytes.

Furthermore, analysis of cells with inducible expression ofWT1 demonstrated that few endogenous genes with putative WT1-repressible promoters are in fact regulated by WT1 in vivo (13Englert C. Hou X. Maheswaran S. Bennett P. Ngwu C. Re G. Garvin A. Rosner M. Haber D. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4662-4675Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar).As a strategy to identify physiologically regulated WT1target genes, we recently used high density oligonucleotide arrays representing 6,800 genes and expressed sequence tags to compare the expression profile of cells before and shortly after inducible expression of WT1 (27Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). Ectopic expression ofWT1(−KTS) did not result in reduced expression of any transcripts represented on the microarrays. However, a small number of genes were strongly induced following WT1(−KTS)expression, notably amphiregulin(AR),1 encoding a secreted growth factor of the epidermal growth factor family capable of stimulating cellular differentiation in organ culture systems, and the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21Cip1. A physiologically relevant interaction between WT1 and AR was suggested by their precise co-localization within differentiating glomeruli of the developing kidney, and by the ability of recombinant AR to induce epithelial differentiation in cultured kidney rudiments (27Lee S.B. Huang K. Palmer R. Truong V.B. Herzlinger D. Kolquist K.A. Wong J. Paulding C. Yoon S.K. Gerald W. Oliner J.D. Haber D.A. Cell. 1999; 98: 663-673Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (260) Google Scholar). WT1(−KTS) binds to a high affinity site (WRE) in the ARpromoter, adjacent to a CRE site. The synergistic transactivation mediated through the WRE and CRE sites raised the possibility that WT1 itself might interact with CBP/P300, a coactivator known to enhance CRE-dependent transcriptional activation by CRE-binding factors (28Montminy M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1997; 66: 807-822Crossref PubMed Scopus (853) Google Scholar). We show here that WT1 binds to CBP stoichiometrically both in vitro and in vivo, and that this protein interaction contributes to WT1-dependent transcriptional activation. These observations support the role of WT1 as a transcriptional activator, which may participate in the induction of target genes directly, as well as through potential interactions with other transcriptional regulators. The tumor suppressor gene WT1 provides a paradigm for the link between normal organ development and cancer. WT1was originally identified by its inactivation in a subset of Wilms tumors and in the germline of children with genetic predisposition to this pediatric kidney cancer (1Call K. Glaser T. Ito C.

Expression of WT1 is restricted to specific cell types in the fetal kidney, gonads, mesothelium, and hematopoietic lineages (5Armstrong J. Pritchard-Jones K. Bickmore W. Hastie N. Bard J. Mech.

In the developing kidney, WT1 is present at low levels in blastemal stem cells, and very high levels of expression are observed as these cells differentiate to form glomerular podocytes. The critical role of WT1 in normal renal development is demonstrated by the apoptosis of renal blastemal cells in WT1-null mice, leading to complete failure of kidney differentiation (9Kreidberg J. Sariola H. Loring J. Maeda M. Pelletier J. Housman D. Jaenisch R. Cell. 1993; 74: 679-691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1636) Google Scholar). The DNA-binding domain of WT1 is encoded by four C-terminal Cys-His zinc fingers, which mediate recognition of both GC- and TC-rich sequences (10Rauscher III, F. Morris J. Tournay O. Cook D. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 11Wang Z. Qiu Q. Enger K. Deuel T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 8896-8900Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). The affinity of WT1 for these motifs is greatly reduced by the product of an alternatively spliced transcript, in which the three amino acids KTS are inserted between zinc fingers three and four (10Rauscher III, F. Morris J. Tournay O. Cook D. Curran T. Science. 1990; 250: 1259-1262Crossref PubMed Scopus (466) Google Scholar, 12Haber D. Sohn R. Buckler A. Pelletier J. Call K. Housman D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Changeux J.P. Semin. Neurosci. 1995; 7: 75-90Crossref Scopus (94) Google Scholar). The subunits of these proteins are co-translationally inserted into the membrane, lumen, or both, of the endoplasmatic reticulum, after which the subunits fold and oligomerize (2Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 3Green W.N. Claudio T.

Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). During these folding and oligomerization events, ligand-binding sites of the receptors are formed. Proteins, once properly folded and oligomerized, are transported to their proper destination, whereas misfolded or improperly oligomerized subunits are retained in the endoplasmatic reticulum and degraded (2Hurtley S.M. Helenius A. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1989; 5: 277-307Crossref PubMed Scopus (779) Google Scholar, 3Green W.N. Claudio T.

Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6587-6596Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Little is known about the molecular events involved in subunit oligomerization and formation of ligand-binding sites. In the present study the first steps of these events are investigated for GABAA receptors. GABAA receptors are chloride channels that can be opened by GABA (6Macdonald R.L. Olsen R.W. Annu. Rev. Neurosci. 1994; 17: 569-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (1799) Google Scholar) and are the site of action of various pharmacologically and clinically important drugs, such as benzodiazepines, barbiturates, steroids, anesthetics, and convulsants. These drugs modulate GABA-induced chloride flux by interacting with separate and distinct allosteric binding sites (7Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). So far, at least 19 GABAAreceptor subunits belonging to several subunit classes (six α, three β, three γ, one δ, one ε, one π, one θ, and three ρ) have been identified in the mammalian brain (8Barnard E.A. Skolnick P. Olsen R.W. Möhler H. Sieghart W. Biggio G. Braestrup C. Bateson A.N. Langer S.Z. Pharmacol. Rev. 1998; 50: 291-313PubMed Google Scholar, 9Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. Farrar S.

A. 1999; 96: 9891-9896Crossref PubMed Scopus (281) Google Scholar). Expression studies indicated that α, β, and γ subunits have to combine to form GABAA receptors with a pharmacology resembling that of the majority of native receptors (7Sieghart W. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 181-234PubMed Google Scholar). Most reports agree that these receptors are composed of two α, two β, and one γ subunit (10Im W.B. Pregenzer J.F. Binder J.A. Dillon G.H. Alberts G.L. J.

Bonnert T.P. McKernan R.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 10100-10104Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (231) Google Scholar). Density gradient centrifugation studies indicated that recombinant GABAA receptors composed of α1β3γ2 subunits almost exclusively sediment as subunit pentamers. α1β3 subunit combinations sediment as tetramers and pentamers, whereas combinations of α1γ2 or β3γ2subunits predominantly form heterodimers (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These results suggested a subunit arrangement in GABAA receptors in which four alternating α and β subunits are connected by a γ subunit (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Presently, however, nothing is known about the processes that lead from single subunits to completely assembled and pharmacologically functional receptors. Because no assembly intermediates could be identified in HEK cells transfected with α1β3γ2 subunits under the conditions used and because not all of the subunit dimers that can be formed in HEK cells transfected with two different subunits might be formed when all three subunits are co-expressed, it is not clear whether αβ, αγ, or βγ subunit dimers or some or all of these dimers are the starting point for GABAA receptor synthesis. The pentameric receptor possesses binding sites for the endogenous neurotransmitter GABA, presumably located at the interface between α1 and β3 subunits (14Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), for benzodiazepines, located between the α1 and γ2 subunit (15Sigel E. Buhr A. Trends Pharmacol.

Presently, nothing is known about the events leading to the formation of the various binding sites on GABAAreceptors. By lowering the temperature during culture of HEK cells transfected with α1, β3, and γ2 subunits, in the present study we were able to detect assembly intermediates of GABAA receptors using sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Results indicated that different subunit dimers are formed during GABAA receptor assembly. Studies investigating the dimerization of complete and truncated subunits additionally suggested that the binding sites for [3H]muscimol or the benzodiazepine [3H]Ro 15-1788 can already be formed by the proper subunit dimers or trimers.

Shivers B.D. Lüddens H. Möhler H. Seeburg P.H. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 110: 2043-2048Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar), were purchased from Roche Molecular Biochemicals. For the generation of recombinant receptors, α1, β3, and γ2 subunits of GABAA receptors from rat brain were cloned and subcloned into pCDM8 expression vectors (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) as described previously (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 23Zezula J. Slany A. Sieghart W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Truncated subunits were constructed by polymerase chain reaction amplification using the full-length subunit as template. The polymerase chain reaction primers contained EcoRI andHindIII restriction sites, which were used to clone the fragments into pCDNAIAmp vectors (Invitrogen). The truncated subunits were confirmed by sequencing. Transformed HEK 293 cells (CRL 1573; American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (JRH Biosciences, Lenexa, KS), 2 mm glutamine, 50 μmβ-mercaptoethanol, 100 units/ml penicillin G, and 100 μg/ml streptomycin in 75-cm2 culture dishes using standard cell culture techniques. HEK 293 cells (3 × 106) were transfected with a total amount of 20 μg of subunit cDNAs via the calcium phosphate precipitation method (24Chen C.A. Okayama H. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 632-638Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Transfected HEK cells were incubated 44 h at 37 °C or 8 h at 37 °C followed by 16 h at 25 °C. Cells from eight culture dishes were harvested and extracted in 1.6 ml of Lubrol extraction buffer (1% Lubrol PX, 0.18% phosphatidylcholine, 150 mm NaCl, 5 mmEDTA, 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.3 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mm benzamidine, and 100 mg/liter bacitracin) for 8 h at 4 °C. This buffer was used rather than a Triton X-100 or a deoxycholate buffer. Because of its low solubilizing ability it did not dissociate assembly intermediates and, thus, allowed their identification (3Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Membranes from adult rat brains (preparation described in Ref. 25Mossier B. Tögel M. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25777-25782Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were extracted in 3.5 ml of Lubrol extraction buffer/brain. The extracts were centrifuged for 40 min at 150,000 × g at 4 °C, and 200 μl of the extracts was layered onto the top of a density gradient 5–20% sucrose in Lubrol extraction buffer). For the determination of sedimentation coefficients, 2 μg of digoxygenated catalase (sedimentation coefficient, 11 s), 1.2 μg of digoxygenated alkaline phosphatase (sedimentation coefficient, 6.1 s), and 1 μg of digoxygenated carbonic anhydrase (sedimentation coefficient 3.3 s) were included in the overlays. The gradients were centrifuged at 120,000 ×g at 4 °C for 23 h and were then fractionated by piercing at the tube bottom (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Protein in individual fractions was precipitated (26Wessel D. Flügge U.I. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 141-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (3191) Google Scholar) and dissolved in sample buffer (108 mmTris-sulfate, pH 8.2, 10 mm EDTA, 25% (w/v) glycerol, 2% SDS, and 3% dithiothreitol) for SDS-PAGE. Proteins were identified by Western blot analysis, and signal intensity per fraction was quantified as described below. In a previous study (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) it has been demonstrated that after co-transfection of HEK cells with α1, β3, and γ2 subunits all three subunits sedimented at a single peak of 8.7 s, representing the pentameric receptor. After co-transfection of HEK cells with α1 and β3 subunits, both subunits again sedimented at a peak of 8.7 s. The β3 subunit, however, additionally formed subunit complexes that sedimented at 3.3, 5.5, 6.7, and 7.4 s (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Assembly intermediates with similar sedimentation properties have been observed previously for the homologous nAChR using a similar procedure (3Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). Thus, the monomeric subunits of these receptors exhibited a sedimentation between 3 and 4 s, sedimentation of subunit dimers was observed at 6 s, trimers sedimented at 7 s, tetramers sedimented at 8 s, and pentamers sedimented at 9 s (3Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From this it was concluded that the 3.3-, 5.5-, 6.7-, and 7.4-s peaks of GABAA receptor assembly intermediates represent subunit mono-, di-, tri-, and tetramers (3Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar). SDS-PAGE was performed as described (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 27Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) using gels containing 12% acrylamide and 0.324% bisacrylamide. Proteins separated on the gels were tank-blotted onto prewetted polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. After blocking with 1.5% nonfat dry milk powder in PBS (2.7 mm KCl, 1.5 mmKH2PO4, 140 mm NaCl, and 4.3 mm Na2HPO4, pH 7.3) and 0.1% Tween 20 for 1 h at room temperature, the membranes were incubated overnight with α1(1–9), β3(345–408), γ2(319–366), or digoxigenized α1(1–9) antibodies (2 μg/ml) at 4 °C. The membranes were extensively washed (1.5% (w/v) dry milk powder and 0.1% Tween 20 in PBS) and were incubated with alkaline phophatase-coupled anti-digoxigenin F(ab)2 fragments (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) for 45 min at room temperature. Membranes were again washed extensively as described above, were equilibrated in assay buffer (0.1 mdiethanolamine and 1 mm MgCl2, pH 10.0) for 10 min and were then incubated with 1 ml of 0.24 mm CSPD or CPD-star reagent (Tropix, Bedford, MA) diluted in assay buffer. After 5 min the fluid was removed, and the membranes were sealed in a foil and exposed to x-ray films (X-Omat S, Eastman Kodak Co.) for various time periods. Signals were quantified by a gel documentation system (Docu Gel 2000i; software: RFLP-Scan; MWG Biotech, Ebersberg, Germany). Transfected HEK cells were incubated 44 h at 37 °C. Cells from four culture dishes were extracted with 800 μl of Lubrol extraction buffer for 8 h at 4 °C. The extract was centrifuged for 40 min at 150,000 × g at 4 °C, and the clear supernatant was incubated overnight at 4 °C under gentle shaking with 15 μg β3(345–408) or γ2(319–366) antibodies. After addition of Immunoprecipitin (preparation described in Ref. 12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar and 0.5% nonfat dry milk powder and shaking for additional 3 h at 4 °C, the precipitate was washed three times with IP low buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, 1 mmEDTA, pH 8.0) containing 1% Triton X-100. The precipitated proteins were dissolved in sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. For binding studies frozen membranes from untransfected or transfected HEK cells were thawed, and cells were homogenized in 50 mm Tris/citrate buffer, pH 7.4, by using an Ultraturax, followed by three centrifugation (200 000 × g for 20 min at 4 °C) resuspension cycles. Cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mm Tris/citrate buffer, pH 7.4, at a protein concentration in the range of 0.5–1 mg/ml as measured with the BCA protein assay kit (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as standard. Membranes were then incubated for 90 min at 4 °C in a total of 1 ml of a solution containing 50 mmTris/citrate buffer, pH 7.4, 150 mm NaCl, and various concentrations (range, 0.1–1000 nm) of [3H]Ro 15-1788 (87.0 Ci/mmol; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in the absence or presence of 100 μm diazepam (Hoffmann La Roche, Basle, Switzerland). For muscimol binding assays, the membranes were incubated for 60 min at 4 °C in a total of 1 ml of a solution containing 50 mm Tris/citrate buffer, pH 7.4, and various concentrations (range, 1–300 nm) of [3H]muscimol (20.0 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of 10 μm GABA. For TPBS binding, membranes were incubated in a total of 1 ml of a solution containing 50 mm Tris/citrate buffer, pH 7.4, 200 mm NaBr and 2 nm [35S]TPBS (104.0 Ci/mmol; PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in the absence or presence of 40 μm IPTBO (from J. S. Collins, City of London Polytechnic, London, UK) for 180 min at room temperature. Membranes were then filtered through Whatman GF/B filters, and the filters were rinsed twice with 3.5 ml of ice-cold 50 mmTris/citrate buffer and were then subjected to scintillation counting. Unspecific binding in the presence of 100 μm diazepam, 10 μm GABA, or 40 μm IPTBO was subtracted from total [3H]Ro 15-1788, [3H]muscimol, or [35S]TBPS binding, respectively, to result in specific binding (23Zezula J. Slany A. Sieghart W. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1996; 301: 207-214Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). HEK cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde in PBS 30–35 h after transfection, followed by a 10-min wash in 50 mm NH4Cl in PBS. Washes between incubation steps were performed in PBS. For detection of intracellular receptors, cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 5 min. Blocking was performed in 5% bovine serum albumin in PBS for 10 min, followed by an incubation with primary antibody in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Primary antibodies were detected with goat anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) Bodipy FL (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) or donkey anti-mouse IgG(H+L)Cy3 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) in 1% bovine serum albumin in PBS. Labeling was visualized using a Zeiss Axiovert 135 M microscope attached to a confocal laser system (Carl Zeiss LSM 410), equipped with an argon laser and a helium-neon laser and suitable filter sets. To verify that labeling of cells without permeabilization was restricted to the cell surface, parallel samples were stained with antibodies directed against the intracellular loop of GABAA receptor subunits (experiments not shown). These antibodies detected GABAA receptor subunits only after permeabilization of transfected cells. Results obtained from double labeling experiments were compared with single labeling experiments to demonstrate that the labeling pattern in double labeling experiments was not caused by cross-bleeding artifacts (experiments not shown). In an attempt to identify GABAA receptor assembly intermediates, extracts from adult rat brain or from HEK 293 cells transfected with α1, β3, and γ2 subunits were subjected to sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Under these conditions, depending on their molecular mass, monomeric and multimeric proteins migrate into the gradient with different sedimentation coefficients. Gradients were fractionated, and the proteins in individual fractions were precipitated and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis with subunit specific antibodies. s values of receptors and receptor intermediates were determined by analyzing the sedimentation of standard proteins with known s values added to each gradient. As shown in Fig. 1 A for brain extracts and Fig. 1 B for transfected HEK cells, the α1, β3, as well as the γ2subunit proteins sedimented at a single peak at 8.7 s. This sedimentation coefficient has been reported to represent the completely assembled pentameric GABAA receptor, and the protein shoulder above 8.7 s presumably is caused by an aggregation of pentameric receptors (3Green W.N. Claudio T. Cell. 1993; 74: 57-69Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar, 12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The absence of α1, β3, and γ2 protein peaks with lowers values (Fig. 1) indicated that most of the GABAA receptors formed in adult brain as well as in transfected cells are pentamers and that receptor synthesis in these tissues was low and/or assembly of receptors was too fast to allow an identification of assembly intermediates under these conditions. In other experiments, the culture temperature was first kept at 37 °C for the first 8 h after transfection of HEK cells with α1, β3, and γ2 subunits to normally initiate transcription and translation and was then reduced to 25 °C for the following 16 h to slow down the assembly of recombinant GABAA receptors. Receptors formed were extracted from the cells and were subjected to density gradient centrifugation. As shown in Fig. 2, under these conditions assembly intermediates could be identified. α1 and γ2 subunits sedimented at 3.3, 4.5, 5.5, 6.8, 7.4, and 8.7 s (Fig. 2). The sedimentation pattern of the β3 subunit was similar to that of the α1 and γ2 subunits, but the protein peak at 6.8 s could not be identified and presumably was present in the shoulder of the 7.4-s peak. It has been reported previously (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) that the peaks at 3.3, 5.5, 6.7, 7.4, and 8.7 s represent mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, and pentamers of GABAA receptor subunits, respectively. The additional peak at 4.5 s could represent a monomer bound to a chaperone, because recently it has been suggested that chaperones might stabilize subunit monomers (4Connolly C.N. Krishek B.J. McDonald B.J. Smart T.G. Moss S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 89-96Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). The identification of all these protein peaks by all three antibodies was not due to a cross-reactivity of the antibodies, because none of the antibodies used for these experiments exhibited any cross-reactivity with other subunits as demonstrated by Western blot analysis of various recombinant receptors (27Jechlinger M. Pelz R. Tretter V. Klausberger T. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1998; 18: 2449-2457Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 28Nusser Z. Ahmad Z. Tretter V. Fuchs K. Wisden W. Sieghart W. Somogyi P. Eur. J. Neurosci. 1999; 11: 1685-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). In other experiments, the sedimentation properties of GABAAreceptors extracted from the brain of 8–10-day-old rats were investigated. In this developing tissue, GABAA receptors are continuously synthesized in different neurons, and it was hoped that amounts of assembly intermediates sufficient to be detected would be present. As shown in Fig. 3, this actually was the case: α1, β3, and γ2 subunits extracted from 8–10-day-old rats, in contrast to those from adult rat brain, sedimented in multiple, overlapping peaks. Whereas the sedimentation pattern of α1 and γ2 subunits was again similar, showing overlapping peaks and shoulders at 5.5, 6.8, and 8.7 s, the sedimentation pattern of β3 subunits was slightly different, showing prominent peaks at 3.3 and 5.5 s and overlapping peaks and shoulders between 6.8 and 8.7 s (Fig.3). Because the [3H]muscimol-binding site on GABAA receptors is located at the interface of α and β subunits (14Smith G.B. Olsen R.W. Trends Pharmacol. Sci. 1995; 16: 162-168Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (453) Google Scholar), it was interesting to investigate whether this binding site could already be formed by GABAA receptor assembly intermediates containing α1 and β3subunits. Because co-transfection of HEK cells with α1and β3 subunits leads to the formation of α1β3 tetramers and pentamers (12Tretter V. Ehya N. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 2728-2737Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), truncated α1 (α1N) and β3(β3N) subunits containing the complete extracellular N-terminal domain but no transmembrane domains were cloned to investigate whether they can assemble with full-length β3and α1 subunits, respectively, forming smaller assembly intermediates. α1 and β3 subunits and α1N and β3N fragments were then co-transfected into HEK cells in various combinations, and expressed subunits were extracted from these cells and were immunoprecipitated with β3(1–13) antibodies. The precipitate was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using digoxigenized α1(1–9) antibodies. As shown in Fig.4 A, in extracts from HEK cells co-transfected with full-length α1 and β3subunits or full-length α1 and β3N subunits, a strongly labeled protein band with apparent molecular mass 51 kDa was detected in Western blots. A protein band with identical molecular mass could be precipitated by α1(1–9) antibodies from these cells as well as from HEK cells transfected with α1 subunits only, but not from untransfected HEK cells (experiments not shown), indicating that this protein band represents the α1 subunit of GABAA receptors. The weakly labeled lower molecular weight bands varied in labeling intensity in different experiments and could not be detected in untransfected HEK cells. They thus seemed to represent degradation products of the α1 subunit. The precipitation of α1subunits by β3(1–13) antibodies was not due to a cross-reactivity of these antibodies because it could not be observed in HEK cells transfected with α1 subunits only (experiment not shown). When extracts from HEK cells co-transfected with α1N and full-length β3 subunits or α1N and β3N constructs were precipitated with β3(1–13) antibodies, three protein bands with apparent molecular masses 30, 33, and 36 kDa could be detected in Western blots using digoxygenized α1(1–9) antibodies. The molecular mass of the smallest band (30 kDa) corresponds with that expected for the unglycosylated α1N fragment. Because two glycosylation sites are present in the α1 subunit (29Schofield P.R. Darlison M.G. Fujita N. Burt D.R. Stephenson F.A. Rodriguez H. Rhee L.M. Ramachandran J. Reale V. Glencorse T.A. Seeburg P.H. Barnard E.A. Nature. 1987; 328: 221-227Crossref PubMed Scopus (1275) Google Scholar), the 33- and 36-kDa bands presumably represent partially and fully glycosylated α1N fragments. The co-precipitation by β3(1–13) antibodies of α1N or α1 subunits indicates that not only full-lenth α1 and β3 subunits but also α1N and β3, α1 and β3N, and even α1N and β3N constructs are able to form hetero-oligomers. The subcellular distribution of these subunit combinations in HEK cells was investigated by immunofluorescence and confocal laser microscopy. Double staining with α1(1–9) and the β2/β3 subunit-specific bd17 antibodies of intact HEK cells transfected with full-length α1 and β3 subunits (Fig. 5,A and B) demonstrated that these subunits formed receptors expressed on the cell surface. Permeabilization of the cells indicated the additional presence of a large number of intracellular subunits with an identical subcellular distribution (Fig. 5,C and D). In HEK cells transfected with α1N constructs and β3 subunits, only β3 subunits could be detected on the cell surface (Fig.5, E and F). These results are in agreement with previous reports demonstrating that β3 subunits are able to form homo-oligomeric receptors that are expressed on the cell surface (21Ebert V. Scholze P. Fuchs K. Sieghart W. Neurochem. Int. 1999; 34: 453-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar, 30Connolly C.N. Wooltorton J.R"

Derivatization of peptides from bone collagen both stabilized the pyrroles and facilitated selective isolation of the pyrrole-containing peptides using a monomeric avidin column.

McCormick R.J. Rucker R.B. FASEB J. 1992; 6: 2439-2449Crossref PubMed Scopus (374) Google Scholar). In bone, cartilage, and tendon, extensive hydroxylation of telopeptide lysine residues leads to the formation of hydroxylysyl aldehydes. These aldehydes interact with the ε amino group of lysine or hydroxylysine residues from the adjacent helix to initially form Schiff bases that can chemically rearrange to form a more stable, keto-imine difunctional cross-link. In skin, the telopeptides are not hydroxylated, and no such rearrangement of the Schiff base cross-link occurs. These two different chemistries, dependent on telopeptide lysine hydroxylation, lead to the formation of different mature cross-links by further reaction of the difunctional cross-links in a tissue-specific manner: hydroxylation of the telopeptide lysine residues appears to be accomplished by tissue-specific enzymes, distinct from those that hydroxylate lysines in the helix (2Bank R.A. Robins S.P. Wijmenga C. Breslau-Siderius L.J. Bardoel A.F. van der Sluijs H.A. Pruijs H.E. TeKoppele J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 1054-1058Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). For the hydroxylysyl aldehyde pathway (bone, cartilage, and tendon), the difunctional cross-links can combine with another hydroxylysine aldehyde-derived component to form a pyridinium cross-link. These cross-links have been extensively characterized, and mechanisms of formation have been proposed (3Eyre D.R. Oguchi H. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 92: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (148) Google Scholar, 4Robins S.P. Duncan A. Biochem. J. 1983; 215: 175-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). However, many studies of cross-linked collagen peptides have implied the presence of other trifunctional cross-links because of a lack of stoichiometric amounts of the pyridinium compounds (5Eyre D.R. Dickson I.R. Van Ness K.P. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 495-500Crossref PubMed Scopus (354) Google Scholar, 6Robins S.P. Duncan A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 914: 233-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). The possible presence of pyrrolic components in collagen arose from the observation that reaction of bone with p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde gave a pink color characteristic of pyrroles (7Scott J.E. Hughes E.W. Shuttleworth A. Biosci. Rep. 1981; 1: 611-618Crossref Scopus (44) Google Scholar); these reactive species were named Ehrlich chromogens. Later experiments used diazo-affinity columns (also consistent with a pyrrolic structure) to covalently bind the Ehrlich chromogen-containing peptides from enzyme digests of bone (8Scott J.E. Hughes E.W. Shuttleworth A. J. Biochem. (Tokyo). 1983; 93: 921-925Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and skin (9Kemp P.D. Scott J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar) and show by amino acid analysis that they were derived from collagen. A similar affinity chromatography approach was used to demonstrate that Ehrlich chromogen cross-links were present at the same loci as the pyridinium cross-links in bovine tendon (10Kuypers R. Tyler M. Kurth L.B. Jenkins I.D. Horgan D.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). This work culminated in a proposed structure and mechanism of formation for pyrroles analogous to that for pyridinium cross-link formation: this mechanism involves reaction of a difunctional, keto-imine cross-link with a lysyl aldehyde-derived component rather than a hydroxylysyl aldehyde-derived component (10Kuypers R. Tyler M. Kurth L.B. Jenkins I.D. Horgan D.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), where the latter may be a second difunctional cross-link (11Hanson D.A. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). Taken together, these studies suggest that Ehrlich chromogens exist in many different tissues and probably have different chemistries based on their stability and the different spectra observed upon reaction withp-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde (9Kemp P.D. Scott J.E. Biochem. J. 1988; 252: 387-393Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar). The mechanism proposed for Ehrlich chromogen cross-link formation, based on work done in tendon, is only applicable to tissues that partially utilize the hydroxylysine aldehyde pathway: these cross-links would be expected to be absent from skin, which lacks hydroxylysine aldehyde, and from cartilage, in which telopeptide lysines are fully hydroxylated. Isolation and characterization of the pyrrolic cross-link(s) have been hampered by the instability of the pyrrole to acid or alkali hydrolysis. Enzyme digests of decalcified bone matrix have been used in attempts to isolate pyrrole-containing peptides, but because these peptides are reduced in size and enriched, the pyrrole tends to oxidize or polymerize. 1J. D. Brady and S. P. Robins, unpublished observations. In a recent study, Ehrlich chromogen-containing peptides were enriched and analyzed by mass spectrometry, revealing peaks that were interpreted to be derived from peptides containing oxidized pyrrolic cross-link (11Hanson D.A. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar). These experiments supported previous preliminary indications that the pyrroles were concentrated at the N-telopeptide site. Estimation of the pyrrole has been made using the color yield of digests with Ehrlich's reagent and correlated to the strength of tendon (12Horgan D.J. King N.L. Kurth L.B. Kuypers R. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1990; 281: 21-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). The content of pyrrole decreases with age in mature animals (13Bailey A.J. Sims T.J. Ebbesen E.N. Mansell J.P. Thomsen J.S. Mosekilde L. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1999; 65: 203-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 14Horgan D.J. Jones P.N. King N.L. Kurth L.B. Kuypers R. Meat Sci. 1991; 29: 251-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and is also lowered in mineralizing tissue (15Knott L. Tarlton J.F. Bailey A.J. Biochem. J. 1997; 322: 535-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (82) Google Scholar) and the osteoporotic femoral head compared with normal (16Knott L. Whitehead C.C. Fleming R.H. Bailey A.J. Biochem. J. 1995; 310: 1045-1051Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). The aim of the present study was to confirm the proposed pyrrole structures by isolating and fully characterizing small peptides containing pyrrolic cross-links. To minimize degradation of pyrroles, the collagen peptides were derivatized and stabilized by reaction with a synthetic, biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent designed to facilitate rapid isolation of cross-linked peptides using a monomeric avidin column. The resulting peptides were separated by HPLC2 and analyzed by mass spectrometry. The most appropriate starting material for the synthesis,N-methyl-N-cyanoethyl-4-aminobenzaldehyde (I; Fig. 1), was a gift from Dr. Huang XuGuang (Eternwin Chemicals Ltd, Beijing, China). After conversion of the nitrile to a carboxylic acid group, the latter was conjugated to biotin pentyl-amine via a carbodiimide reaction. Conversion of the cyano group (I; Fig. 1) to the corresponding acid (II; Fig. 1) was achieved by alkali hydrolysis. The nitrile (150 mg) was dissolved in 5 m NaOH and 6% H2O2 (5 ml) and refluxed for 2 h. The hydrolysate was then acidified by the addition of concentrated HCl, dried down under vacuum, and redissolved in ethanol (1.5 ml). An aliquot of this solution (1 ml) was added to 0.2 m NaOH (1 ml) and applied to an anion exchange column (Bio-Rad AG 1-X8; Na+-form; 2 ml). The column was washed with water (12 ml) before elution of the bound material with 2 m HCl. The eluent was dried under vacuum, and the residue was resuspended in water (1 ml). A small amount of residue (soluble in ethanol but containing no compound II) was removed, after which the aqueous fraction was dried under vacuum (yielding 7 mg of material) and redissolved in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (1 ml). Aliquots (100 μl) of this material were then chromatographed on a Waters RCM Prep-Pak® C18column (25 × 100 mm; 10 μm) pumped at 4 ml min−1. The buffers used were 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer A) and 70% acetonitrile, 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer B) with a gradient of 5 min at 5% buffer B followed by a linear increase to 70% buffer B over 35 min. Monitoring at 330 nm showed a single major peak that eluted at 28.3 min, and fractions corresponding to this peak were pooled and dried under vacuum (yield = 3 mg). Analysis of this material by electrospray mass spectrometry in negative-ion mode using a MAT 900 mass spectrometer (Finnigan MAT, Bremen, Germany) revealed the major ion as [M-H] = 206.2, which corresponds to the expected value forN-methyl-N-proprionic acid-4-amino benzaldehyde (M r = 207.2; II in Fig. 1). N-Methyl-N-proprionic acid-4-amino benzaldehyde (3 mg) was redissolved in water (3 ml), and biotin pentyl-amine (30 mg; Pierce) was added. A solution of 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)carbodiimide/N-hydroxysuccinimide (0.035 m/0.028 m, respectively; 3 ml) was added and heated to 50 °C for 4 h. The resulting solution was then dried down under vacuum and chromatographed using the preparative RCM Prep-Pak® column as described previously. The gradient applied was 20% buffer B for 5 min followed by a linear increase to 60% buffer B over 30 min. The chromatogram (Fig. 1) showed two major peaks, with the peak eluting at 15 min corresponding to the unreacted acid. The second major component eluting at 18 min was analyzed by positive-ion electrospray mass spectrometry and showed [M+H] of 518.7 and [M+Na] of 540.6, corresponding to the calculated M r of 517.7 De-fatted human bone (20 g) was powdered in a Spex freezer-mill in liquid nitrogen. The resultant powder was decalcified by three 2-day extractions in 0.5 m EDTA, pH 8, at 4 °C, washed with water, and lyophilized. The decalcified bone was then digested using the following enzymic procedures. The bone powder (1.0 g) suspended in 50 mm ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8, was denatured by heating at 70 °C for 30 min, and after cooling to 37 °C, trypsin (Sigma) was added to give an enzyme substrate ratio of 1:30. The mixture was incubated with gentle agitation for 18 h at 37 °C, followed by centrifugation of the mixture and lyophilization of the supernatant solution. The proportion of collagen solubilized was determined by hydroxyproline analysis. Portions (1.0 mg) of bone powder were suspended in 200 μl of 50 mm sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, containing 2 mm EDTA and 2 mm dithiothreitol. One sample was heat-denatured by heating at 70 °C for 30 min and then cooled to 37 °C. Ten μg of recombinant human cathepsin K (a gift from SmithKline Beecham Pharmaceuticals, King of Prussia, PA) in 12.5 μl of PBS was added to both samples. After a 24-h incubation at 37 °C with gentle agitation, the same amount of cathepsin K was added, and the digestion was continued for an additional 24 h. After centrifugation (13,000 × g) of any undigested tissue, an aliquot (20 μl) of the supernatant was taken for hydroxyproline determination, and the remainder was used directly for reaction with Ehrlich reagents. The decalcified bone powder (1.1 g) was suspended in 0.1 m citrate buffer, pH 5, heated to 70 °C for 1 h to denature the triple-helical structure, and allowed to cool to 45 °C. Papain (100 units) was added, and the digest was incubated for 4 h. The pH of the digest was then adjusted to pH 7.4 by the addition of 2 m Tris, and the temperature was lowered to 37 °C for an overnight digestion with protease type X (100 units). The completed digest (estimated as 110 μmcollagen by total pyridinium cross-link content) was frozen, lyophilized, and suspended in water (7 ml). For comparisons of the reactivity of trypsin and cathepsin K digests of bone, the peptide digest (140 μl) containing up to 25 mm hydroxyproline was mixed with 27 μl of 70 mm Ehrlich's reagent (10 mg ml−1) or 70 mm biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent (36 mg ml−1) dissolved in 2-methoxyethanol, followed immediately by 83 μl of 12 m HCl. After 30 min at room temperature, the color was determined spectrophotometrically. The papain/protease X bone digest (500 μl) was acidified by the addition of 12 m HCl (250 μl) before adding biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent (50 μg). After 30 min at room temperature, the acid was neutralized by the addition of 12 m NaOH (approximately 220 μl) followed by the addition of 40 mmphosphate buffer (20 ml). A monomeric avidin column (5 ml) was prepared according to the manufacturer's (Pierce) instructions. The reacted bone digest at neutral pH was added slowly to the column, which was then washed with 6 column volumes of PBS followed by 1 column volume of water. The biotinylated material was eluted at about 1 ml min−1 with 1 m acetic acid adjusted to pH 2.5 with ammonia, and 8 fractions (5 ml) were collected. To assess the efficiency of the monomeric avidin column, a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was developed. Immulon 4 immunnoassay plates were coated with streptavidin (25 nm) in PBS for 2 h at 37 °C. Samples or standards in PBS/0.1% Tween and 0.5% fat-free milk powder (110 μl) were added to biotinylated peroxidase (Sigma; 10 ng/ml; 110 μl) in PBS/Tween and 0.5% fat-free milk powder in a U-bottomed 96-well plate. The mixed samples were then transferred to the washed, streptavidin-coated plate and incubated for 90 min at 37 °C. After washing the plate three times with PBS/0.1% Tween, the peroxidase substrate (200 μl) tetramethyl-benzidine dihydrochloride was added (0.1 mg/ml) in 0.05m citrate/phosphate buffer, pH 5, 0.012% v/v hydrogen peroxide. The reaction was stopped after 15 min by the addition of 3m sulfuric acid (50 μl). Material eluted from the avidin column was reduced in volume (100 μl) and chromatographed on a reversed phase HPLC column (4.6 × 100 mm; C18; particle size, 3 μm). The column was equilibrated with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer A), and peptides were eluted over 35 min with linear gradients formed with 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (buffer B). The eluant was monitored at 214, 280, and 330 nm. Each fraction from the HPLC was dried down and redissolved in water (2 μl). An aliquot (1 μl) was mixed with α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid (1 μl of a 10 mg/ml solution in 70% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid), dried onto a sample plate, and analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Voyager-DE; Applied Biosystems) calibrated externally using bradykinin. Hydroxyproline analysis showed that ∼75% of the heat-denatured bone had been solubilized by trypsin digestion. For cathepsin K, the bone was completely digested after heat denaturation, whereas only 45% of the collagen was solubilized without heat treatment. Comparison of the reactivity of the tryptic peptides with Ehrlich reagent and biotinylated Ehrlich reagent showed an apparently enhanced color yield with the biotinylated derivative, with a slight shift in absorption maximum to 579 nm (Fig. 2). Under the conditions of reaction, Ehrlich's reagent showed a linear response in color development between 1 and 25 mg ml−1collagen peptides. For the cathepsin K-derived peptides, similar color development at 579 nm was observed despite the differences in peptide concentration. Thus, the heat-denatured sample (4.5 mg ml−1 collagen) had A 579= 0.024, whereas the sample solubilized without heat denaturation (1.9 mg ml−1) showed A 579 = 0.021: the two spectra were similar (Fig. 2). After reaction of bone-derived peptides with the biotinylated reagent and selection of derivatized pyrrole-containing components by adsorption to a monomeric avidin column, the total amino acid content of the material eluted from the column was determined (TableI). The composition was consistent with a preparation rich in telopeptide material, with relatively high proportions of Ser, Ala, Asp, Glu, Thr, and Ile and low amounts of Pro and hydroxyproline. The pattern of elution from the monomeric avidin column, as measured by the biotin inhibition assay (Fig.3), showed that the biotinylated material was not easily displaced from the column. Indeed, previous experiments had shown that a fast flow-rate and large volumes of acetic acid (or 2 mm biotin, as suggested by the manufacturer) were required to displace the biotin derivatives from the column. The reversed phase HPLC profile of the eluted material was dominated by peaks eluting at 21 min (representing free biotin) and at 34 min (comprising unreacted biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent); the former probably arises from continuous “leeching” from the column of biotin used in its preparation to block high affinity sites. Many of the pyrrole cross-link-containing peptides were not detectable monitoring the column at the lowest feasible wavelength (214 nm) because of their small size and the relatively small amounts present. Each fraction was therefore analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, yielding the spectra shown in Fig. 4. Because there were insufficient quantities of many of the smaller peptides to obtain amino acid composition data, some ambiguities in their structural assignments did arise. In particular, the mass difference between Glu and Ile/Leu is equivalent to an additional hydroxyl group, and for the isolated peptide with M r = 1086 (Fig. 4 a), the ambiguity is due to the possible presence of a hydroxylated cross-link. Thus, this peptide may contain Gly and Glu (from either the C- or N-telopeptides of the α1 chain) or, for a hydroxylated cross-link, a Gly residue linked with either Ile (from the α1 helix) or Leu (from the α2 helix). Even when the amino acid composition is known, the precise location of the residues may not be clear, as in the case of the peptide with M r = 957 (Fig. 4 a) containing the biotinylated pyrrole with a single Gly residue. This residue is shown in a helical position (which could be at the N- or C-terminal overlap sites) but could also be derived from the α2(I) N-telopeptide: this peak may contain a mixture of Gly-containing peptides from the different locations. The M r = 1029 peptide shown in Fig. 4 f could have the same alternatives of glutamate or hydroxylated pyrrole-leucine/isoleucine. The peaks corresponding to a loss of Gly (Fig. 4, b andc) are probably losses due to the energy of the laser desorption rather than discrete peptides, but these peaks provide additional evidence for the peptide structures proposed. The structures of the larger peptides shown in the other panels are unambiguous.Table ITotal amino acid content of pyrrole-containing peptidesAmino acidnmolAsp7.1Glu13.4Hyp1.0Ser11.4Gly22.0His2.0Arg2.7Thr5.0Pro2.0Ala9.1Val5.8Leu8.3Ile13.5Lys4.0Phe1.9Bone peptides were derivatized with biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent and selected by adsorption to a monomeric avidin column, the cross-link-containing peptides were eluted with 1 m acetic acid, and the amino acid composition of the mixture was determined after complete acid hydrolysis.

MALDI-TOF spectra of individual fractions from the HPLC separation are shown with assigned structures based on the structure of the pyrrole-biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent given in Fig. 6. The spectra shown in a–h are from fractions eluting from the HPLC at 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 20, 25, and 28 min, respectively. The parentheses in a–c andf indicate alternative structures comprising hydroxylated cross-link with I/L or nonhydroxylated cross-link with an E residue (see “Results” for further details). Peptides eluting at 13 and 16 min shown in b and c and having identical masses are likely to constitute the nonhydroxylated and hydroxylated alternatives, respectively. There is some ambiguity in the position of C-terminal Gly residues. Analyses of other fractions revealed no unique peptides but provided confirmatory evidence for several of the structures shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Bone peptides were derivatized with biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent and selected by adsorption to a monomeric avidin column, the cross-link-containing peptides were eluted with 1 m acetic acid, and the amino acid composition of the mixture was determined after complete acid hydrolysis. Hyp, hydroxyproline. Except for the large peptide in Fig. 4 h, the peptides described here could all originate from the N-telopeptide site, although the smaller peptides could originate from either the N- or C-terminal site. The peptides isolated and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry were broadly consistent with the amino acid composition of the total derivatized pyrrole cross-link fraction, although the spectra give little information on the relative quantities of the peptides. However, the presence of a relatively large proportion of alanine in the amino acid composition of the total cross-link fraction (Table I) indicates that not all of the pyrrole-containing peptides have yet been accounted for by the MALDI-TOF analysis. The results presented show that Ehrlich's reagent can be coupled to biotin via the tertiary amine group and maintain its ability to react with a model pyrrole giving the characteristic color development. A similar color reaction, as confirmed by the absorption spectrum, was observed after reaction with several different enzymic digests of bone peptides. The isolation and identification of a series of peptides from enzyme digests of human bone collagen provide direct confirmation of the structure of the pyrrolic cross-links. Previous studies in which pyrrole-containing peptides were identified after isolation from digests of bovine tendon using diazotization methods (10Kuypers R. Tyler M. Kurth L.B. Jenkins I.D. Horgan D.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar) did not identify the cross-linking compounds. Taking into account the differences in peptide concentration, the reactivity at 579 nm of the cathepsin K digest after heat denaturation (5.3 units mg−1) was similar to that for the tryptic digest of heat-denatured bone (5.6 units mg−1). However, reactivity of the bone digest solubilized by cathepsin K without heat treatment was about 2-fold higher (11.2 units mg−1), suggesting that around 50% of the pyrrole cross-links in bone collagen may be unstable to the thermal denaturation step: the similarity in spectra of the biotinylated Ehrlich reaction products indicates that similar cross-linking moieties are being detected. For future quantitative studies of the location of pyrroles within the collagen fibril, this susceptibility to degradation must be taken into account. The primary objective of the present study, however, was to characterize the structure of the pyrrolic cross-links, for which quantitative recovery was not essential. In isolating material from the papain/protease X digest of bone, a monomeric avidin column proved effective in binding biotinylated pyrrole peptides, although a large volume of acid was needed to elute the bound material. The results obtained from MALDI-TOF analyses of the isolated peptides after separation by reversed phase HPLC were interpreted in light of the known sequences in the region of the cross-linking sites involving the N- and C-terminal locations, as shown in Fig. 5. These calculations also took into account that the complexes formed by reaction of the pyrrolic cross-links with biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent, stabilized through delocalization of the charge as shown in Fig.6, would contribute relative masses of 899 and 915 for the lysine- and hydroxylysine-derived cross-links, respectively. Peptides from the N-terminal cross-linking site can comprise two α1(I) telopeptides or an α1(I) telopeptide cross-linked to an α2(I) telopeptide. Either of these combinations can cross-link with the helical region from either chain. At the C-terminal cross-linking site, only the α1(I) chain contains a cross-link site, which can cross-link with either chain in the helix. As indicated in Fig. 4, it is likely that the pyrrole cross-link will be present in both a lysine and hydroxylysine form, depending on the hydroxylation state of the helical lysine contributing to the cross-link.Figure 6Structure of the pyrrolic cross-link covalently derivatized by biotinylated Ehrlich's reagent. The structures shown are for the lysine-derived pyrrole cross-link, which is postulated to be stabilized by charge delocalization. Analogous structures for the hydroxylysine-derived cross-link haveM r = 915.2. See “Discussion.” for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The primary purpose of the present study was to generate small peptides that would, in conjunction with the novel derivatization method, allow accurate assessment of the proposed cross-link structure. This has been achieved as the observed masses of a relatively large number of isolated peptides were extremely close to the theoretic masses of derivatized complexes at the N- and C-telopeptide sites. These data, together with the limited peptide sequencing information through ladder fragmentation, provide strong confirmatory evidence for the proposed structure of the pyrrolic cross-link (10Kuypers R. Tyler M. Kurth L.B. Jenkins I.D. Horgan D.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). However, speculation on the distribution of the pyrrole within the molecule should be treated with caution because of ambiguities in the assigned structures of the smaller peptides and the nonspecific nature of the proteolysis. Consistent with previous studies that indicate that the pyrrolic cross-links are located mainly at the N-terminal sites (10Kuypers R. Tyler M. Kurth L.B. Jenkins I.D. Horgan D.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 11Hanson D.A. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), almost all of the isolated peptides could have originated from N-telopeptide-related sequences. However, one of the larger peptides (see Fig. 4 h) was clearly derived from the C-terminal telopeptide, and it is conceivable that the nonspecific proteolytic digestion conditions may have cleaved C-terminal components further to the peptides observed in Fig. 4, a, b, andf. The presence of relatively high proportions of Ala in the amino acid digest is also indicative of C-telopeptide-derived pyrrole not yet detected by MALDI-TOF analysis. Of those peptides analyzed in the present study, there appears to be a predominance of α1N to α1N-telopeptide cross-linked through the pyrroles: this finding is contrary to those of Hanson and Eyre (11Hanson D.A. Eyre D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 26508-26516Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (162) Google Scholar), who found mostly α1 to α2 telopeptide cross-links. These differences could be accounted for by the selectivity of both methodologies, and a more controlled proteolysis followed by analysis of all the pyrrole-containing peptides produced is required to definitively establish the distribution of pyrrole cross-links. As for the pyridinium cross-links, hydroxylation of the helical lysine will give rise to different forms of the pyrrole, and the analyses show that both hydroxylated and nonhydroxylated forms are present. Consistent with previous trivial names, the nomenclature pyrrololine (PYL) and deoxypyrrololine (DPL) has been proposed for these cross-links (17Adamczyk M. Johnson D.D. Reddy R.E. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1999; 38: 3537-3539Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). The presence of the homologues is most clearly evident in the peptides identified in Fig. 4, d ande, which appear to be hydroxylation isoforms of the same peptide. However, the unhydroxylated form appears to predominate, consistent with a relatively higher proportion of the lysyl form of pyridinium cross-link at the N-telopeptide site. No evidence was obtained for glycosylated derivatives of the hydroxylysyl form of pyrrole cross-link, although these might be expected to occur, particularly involving the C-telopeptide cross-link. In conclusion, this study provides strong evidence for the structures of pyrrolic cross-links in collagen proposed by Kuypers et al. (10Kuypers R. Tyler M. Kurth L.B. Jenkins I.D. Horgan D.J. Biochem. J. 1992; 283: 129-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar). The results suggest that a hydroxylated form of the pyrrole exists, analogous to the formation of pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline. The pyrrole appears to occur predominantly at the N-telopeptide site, although additional studies using a more consistent digestion system will be needed to determine the concentrations, intramolecular distribution, and tissue specificity of these potentially important cross-links.

Based on its amino acid sequence and predicted secondary structure, IL-18 was recognized as a member of the IL-1 family (6Bazan J.F. Timans J.C. Kastelein R.A. Nature. 1996; 379: 591Crossref PubMed Scopus (264) Google Scholar). The similarity to IL-1β extends to the processing of the IL-18 precursor by the IL-1β-converting enzyme (7Gu Y. Kuida K. Tsutsui H.

In addition, the ligand binding and signaling subunits of the heterodimeric IL-18 receptor are homologous to the corresponding subunits of the IL-1 receptor, and all but the signaling subunit of the IL-1 receptor map to a gene cluster in chromosome 2 (9Parnet P.

The IL-18-binding protein (IL-18BP), a naturally occurring antagonist of IL-18 which is found in both humans and mice, prevents IL-18 from binding to its receptor (15Novick D. Kim S.-H. Fantuzzi G.

The affinity between IL-18 and IL-18BP is extremely high with a subnanomolar Kd(17Xiang Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Functional homologs of IL-18BP have been found in poxviruses, namely molluscum contagiosum virus, vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, and ectromelia virus (17Xiang Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Virology. 2001; 279: 22-26Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), but so far not in other viruses. Approximately 60% of the mature human IL-18BP (hIL-18BP) resembles an immunoglobulin (Ig) domain that includes a highly conserved pair of cysteines and a tryptophan residue. The predicted Ig domain of hIL-18BP has about 25% amino acid sequence identity with the third Ig domain of the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), whose x-ray structure was solved in complex with IL-1β (23Vigers G.P. Anderson L.J. Caffes P. Brandhuber B.J. Nature. 1997; 386: 190-194Crossref PubMed Scopus (233) Google Scholar). A model of hIL-18BP complexed to IL-18, based on the IL-1R1·IL-1β structure, has been proposed (18Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). To examine the structure/function relationships of hIL-18BP, we performed site-directed mutagenesis. The binding affinity of each mutated hIL-18BP for IL-18 was measured, and the residues important for interactions with IL-18 were determined. For other purposes, we had appended a DNA segment encoding the biotinylation site and a six-histidine tag to the 3′-end of the molluscum contagiosum virus MC51L open reading frame. This was accomplished by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using DNA containing the MC51L open reading frame as a template (19Xiang Y. Moss B. Virology. 1999; 257: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) and the primers 5′-GCCACCATGAAGGAAAGTCTTTCTCGG-3′ and 5′-GCTAGTGATGATGGTGATGGTGTTCGTGCCATTCGATTTTCTGAGCTTCGAAGATGTCGTTCAGACCCCACAGGTTTCTCAACAT-3′. The PCR product was ligated to the pTarget TA cloning vector (Promega) to form pYX26. To recover the DNA containing the biotinylation site and six-histidine tag and to add a flexible linker GSGGGGS in front of the biotinylation site GLNDIFEAQKIEWHE, another PCR was made using pYX26 as the template with primers 5′-ATTAGGATCCGGTGGAGGAGGTTCTGGTCTGAACGACATCTTC-3′ and 5′-CGGGGTACCCTAGTGATGATGGTGATGG-3′. The PCR product 5′-ATTAGGATCCGGTGGAGGAGGTTCTGGTCTGAACGACATCTTCGAAGCTCAGAAAATCGAATGGCACGAACACCATCACCATCATCACTAGGGTACCCCG-3′, with the BamHI and KpnI sites in italics, was digested with BamHI and KpnI and inserted into the multiple cloning site of pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) to form pYX45 (see Fig. 2 A). The KpnI site in pYX45 was removed using the exonuclease activity of T4 DNA polymerase to generate pYX45-NK. The hIL-18BP open reading frame (19Xiang Y. Moss B. Virology. 1999; 257: 297-302Crossref PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar) was amplified by PCR with a 5′-primer (5′-CTATCAGCTAGCATGACCATGAGACACAACTG-3′) containing anNheI site and a 3′-primer (5′-TAATGGATCCACCACCTCCACCCTGCTGCTGTGGACTGC-3′) including an additional GGGGS coding sequence. The last two codons of GGGGS contained a BamHI site enabling the hIL-18BP and tag coding sequence to be fused in-frame in pYX45-NK by using the NheI and BamHI sites. As a result, the linker sequence between hIL-18BP and the biotinylation site and polyhistidine tag was GGGGSGGGGS. This plasmid was named pYX50-NK. A derivative of pYX50-NK was constructed by changing the serine at residue 103 to threonine, which created a KpnI site with the codons of residues 102 and 103 (GT) (see Fig. 2 B,top). This unique KpnI site, together with either the 5′-NheI site or 3′-BamHI site, allowed the cloning of PCR products containing substitutions at residues 93, 95, 97, 99, 104, 106, 107, 108, 112, and 114 (see Fig. 2 B,top). Another derivative of pYX50-NK was constructed by introducing a silent mutation at residue 126, which created aKpnI site (see Fig. 2 B, middle). This unique KpnI site, together with either the 5′-NheI site or the 3′-BamHI site, allowed the cloning of PCR products containing substitutions at residue 119, 121, 130, 151, and 153 (see Fig. 2 B, middle). An additional derivative of pYX50-NK was constructed by removing the coding sequence from residue 103 to residue 125 and creating aKpnI site with the codons of 125 and 126 (see Fig.2 B, bottom). Residue 130 of this construct was replaced by alanine by subcloning a fragment containing the K130A mutation into the construct. The unique KpnI site allowed the cloning of PCR products containing multiple additional substitutions at positions 106, 107, 114, 119, and 121 (see Fig.2 B, bottom). For each mutant, the entire hIL-18BP coding sequence of both strands was determined to confirm that the mutations were correct. 293T cells in one six-well plate were transfected with 2 μg of plasmid/well using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol. After overnight incubation, the medium of each well was replaced with 1.2 ml of serum-free Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.). After another 3 days of incubation, the medium was harvested, and any suspended cells were removed by centrifugation. The supernatant was adjusted to contain 0.1% Triton X-100 and 15 mm imidazole in a total volume of 6.12 ml and was incubated overnight at 4 °C with 0.5 ml of Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin (Qiagen). The resin was then washed once with 10 ml of 15 mm imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline and twice with 10 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. The resin was resuspended in 1 ml of 10 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 125 μl of 10 Biomix A (Avidity, Denver, Colorado), 125 μl of 10 × Biomix B (Avidity) and 3 μg of Escherichia coli biotin holoenzyme synthetase (Avidity) were added. The resin was incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 1–4 h, packed into a 0.8 × 4-cm disposable column (Bio-Rad), and washed with 30 ml of 15 mm imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline containing 150 mm NaCl. The recombinant protein was eluted with 2 ml of 300 mm imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline by gravity flow at room temperature. Six 250-μl fractions were collected manually in Eppendorf tubes. Fractions containing the biotinylated hIL-18BP were used for analysis on a BIAcore 2000 sensor (BIAcore, Piscataway, NJ). Biotinylated and control IL-18BPs were incubated with streptavidin-agarose (Pierce) or control protein A-agarose (Pierce) for ∼2 h in the presence of 0.1% SDS and 0.1% Triton X-100. Proteins that bound to the streptavidin- or protein A-agarose were removed by centrifugation. The amounts of hIL-18BP remaining in the supernatants were determined by binding to recombinant murine IL-18 (rmIL-18) (PeptroTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) that was immobilized on a BIAcore sensor CM5 chip. The initial binding rates, which are proportional to the IL-18BP concentrations in the supernatants, were calculated as the average binding rates for the first 3 min, during which time less than 2% of the IL-18BP binding sites on the chip were occupied. The percentage of IL-18BP that was biotinylated was determined from the initial binding rate of IL-18BP in the supernatant after incubation with protein A-agarose minus the initial binding rate of IL-18BP in the supernatant after incubation with streptavidin-agarose divided by the initial binding rate of IL-18BP in the supernatant after incubation with protein A-agarose. Biotinylated hIL-18BP was captured onto a BIAcore SA chip via the strong and virtually irreversible interaction of biotin with streptavidin. The chip was then washed several times with injections of 10 mm glycine, pH 1.5, to remove any loosely bound materials. Less than 300 response units (RU) of protein was captured to prevent any mass transport effect during the kinetic analysis. The maximal responses for IL-18 binding (Rmax) were usually around 100 RU, which is close to the theoretical Rmax calculated with the assumption that all captured hIL-18BP proteins are active. The binding kinetics of hIL-18BP with recombinant human IL-18 (rhIL-18; PeptroTech) and rmIL-18 were determined as described previously (17Xiang Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11537-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). The Homology and Builder modules in the Insight II sets of programs (Molecular Simulations Inc.) were used for model construction. The coordinates of a published hIL-18BP structure model (18Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) were obtained from the authors, and the entire structural model was optimized through energy minimization with the Builder module. The structure model of mutated hIL-18BP was constructed by replacing the mutated side chain with that of alanine in the Homology module, and then the entire structure was optimized through energy minimization with the Builder module. The root mean square deviations of mutated and wild type hIL-18BP structure models were determined by automatic structure alignment with the Homology module. A model based on the structure of IL-1R1 complexed to IL-1β predicted that the β-strands cand d, the loop between c and d, and the f-g loop of hIL-18BP interact with IL-18 (18Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). We selected amino acid residues 93, 95, 97, 114, 130, 151, and 153 of hIL-18BP for mutagenesis because they were the ones suggested by the model to interact with hIL-18 (Fig.1). We also compared the amino acid sequence of hIL-18BP with those of two poxvirus-encoded IL-18BPs, MC54L from molluscum contagiosum virus and evp16 from ectromelia virus. The three IL-18BPs share sequence similarities in their Ig domains, especially in the predicted β strands c, d, andf (Fig. 1). Most of the conserved residues were also selected for mutagenesis. Those not already chosen on the basis of the structure model included residue 99 in the predicted cstrand, residues 104, 106, 107, 108, and 112 in the predictedd strand, and residue 119 and 121 in predicted estrand or d-e loop. Some other conserved residues in the predicted f and g strands were not selected for mutagenesis because they are distant from the predicted interface between hIL-18BP and IL-18. Residue 121 of hIL18BP was selected, although there was no corresponding residue in evp16. Among these 15 residues chosen for mutagenesis (Fig. 1), 6 have charged side chains that could be involved in electrostatic interactions, and the others have side chains that could participate in hydrophobic interactions. To avoid global alterations in protein structure, in each case the selected amino acid was changed to alanine. Additional mutations were made at residues 114 and 130, the only two predicted by the structural model to participate in electrostatic interactions: one substitution maintained the same kind of charge, another changed it to the opposite charge, and the third changed it to a polar residue. Mutations at residue 93, 95, 97, 99, 104, 106, 107, 108, 112, and 114 also contained a conservative threonine to serine substitution at residue 103 which was introduced to facilitate PCR mutagenesis. Because of the high affinity between hIL-18BP and hIL-18 and the predicted minimal structural perturbation of alanine substitutions, the sensitive and quantitative method of surface plasmon resonance was used to determine binding constants. The hIL-18BPs were expressed by mammalian cells as secreted, glycosylated, C-terminal fusion proteins with a flexible linker, followed by a 15-amino acid biotin holoenzyme synthetase biotinylation recognition site and a six-histidine tag (Fig.2 A). The secreted hIL-18BPs were captured on Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resin via the six-histidine tag. While on the resin, the proteins were biotinylated at a specific lysine by biotin holoenzyme synthetase (24Beckett D. Kovaleva E. Schatz P.J. Protein Sci. 1999; 8: 921-929Crossref PubMed Scopus (562) Google Scholar) and then washed and eluted with imidazole. The only biotinylated protein detected after this purification step ran as a broad 50-kDa band on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 2 C), consistent with the size and glycosylation state of hIL-18BP. This procedure had a number of advantages over previous methods because no dialysis step was necessary before the biotinylation reaction, and excess biotin, which could interfere with binding to the streptavidin chip, was removed by washing prior to elution. Approximately 90% of the protein was biotinylated by this procedure. hIL-18BPs were captured individually on streptavidin chips, and the real time association and dissociation of rhIL-18 and rmIL-18 were monitored in a BIAcore 2000 sensor. Sensorgrams for all proteins with single amino acid substitutions were obtained by injecting 14 nm rhIL-18, and the responses were normalized to a maximum of 100 RU. As reported previously (17Xiang Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11537-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar), the binding of rhIL-18 to unmutated hIL-18BP was characterized by a rapid association phase (which is affected by both on- and off-rates) and an extremely small decrease in response during the dissociation phase (which is only affected by the off-rate) (Fig.3 A). The association phases of the sensorgrams of all of the mutated proteins with single substitutions were similar to each other (Fig. 3, A–E). By contrast, the dissociation phases of several of the mutated proteins differed from unmutated hIL-18BP. Alanine substitutions of some of the selected individual residues on the predicted β-strand cand d caused increased rates of dissociation (Fig. 3,A–D). Among these, substitution of the tyrosine at residue 97 or the phenylalanine at residue 104 caused the largest change. Alanine substitutions at residues 93, 99, 106, 108, or 114 caused smaller but significant increases in the off-rates (Fig. 3,A–D). Outside of the predicted c andd strands, no single mutation was found to affect the binding significantly (Fig. 3 E). Of the seven residues that were shown to affect binding, only two (106 and 114) had charged side chains, whereas the rest had hydrophobic side chains. The effects of mutations at residues 106 and 114 on IL-18 binding were relatively small compared with mutations at 97 and 104. When the charged residues 107, 119, 121, or 130 were mutated, there was little effect on binding even though residue 130 was predicted to interact with hIL-18 (18Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In an effort to assess whether the charged amino acids as a group might contribute to IL-18 binding, we constructed four sets of mutations that combined several single amino acid substitutions. Mutants c1, c2, c3, and c4 each had four residues substituted with alanine. They were residues 106, 114, 119, and 130 for mutant c1; residues 107, 114, 121, and 130 for mutant c2; residues 106, 114, 121, and 130 for c3; and residues 107, 114, 119, and 130 for c4. Sensorgrams for these multiply substituted proteins, with the exception of c1, were also obtained by injecting 14 nm rhIL-18. Because c1 bound to rhIL-18 very poorly, 111 nm rhIL-18 was injected. Except for c1, which cannot be compared with the others, the association phases were similar to the unmutated hIL-18BP. There were, however, differences in the dissociation phases. Residues at 107, 121, and 130, as a group, contributed very little to IL-18 binding because mutant c2 only had a small increase in the dissociation rate compared with that of the E114A mutant. For kinetic analysis, sensorgrams that were obtained with various concentrations of rhIL-18 and rmIL-18 were globally fitted with BIAEVALUATION software to a 1-to-1 binding model, in which one molecule of IL-18 binds with one molecule of hIL-18BP. Both the actual data and fitted curve are shown for the mutated proteins with alanine substitutions at amino acids 93 and 97 (Fig.4). Similar experiments were performed at least four times with each of the mutated proteins, and the kinetic and affinity constants that were obtained are listed in TableI. The relative changes of Gibbs free energy change (ΔΔG) caused by the mutations are also shown in the table. Alanine substitution of the tyrosine at residue 97 or the phenylalanine at residue 104 increased the Kdmore than 100-fold above that of the unmutated hIL-18BP and together contributed to ∼50% of the binding energy. Alanine substitution of residue 93 increased the Kd more than 50-fold and contributed about 15% of the binding energy. In addition, substitutions of residues 99, 106, 108, and 114 all increased theKd by more than 5-fold. The substitution of lysine or glutamine for aspartic acid 114 caused a greater change than alanine in the Kd.Table IKinetics and affinity constants of hIL-18BP proteinshIL-18mIL-18KonKoffKdΔΔG (mut­WT)0KonKoffKdΔΔG (mut­WT)0104/ms10−4/snmkcal/mol105/ms10−4/snmkcal/molWT1-aWT, wild type.9 ± 30.05 ± 0.010.06 ± 0.0307.96 ± 0.080.16 ± 0.010.019 ± 0.0010F93A3 ± 20.9 ± 0.055 ± 32.62 ± 12.7 ± 0.31.3 ± 0.52.5I95A7.7 ± 0.50.2 ± 0.10.3 ± 0.10.97 ± 10.5 ± 0.10.08 ± 0.030.8Y97A4 ± 119 ± 145 ± 113.92.3 ± 0.724 ± 111 ± 33.7L99A8 ± 20.59 ± 0.060.7 ± 0.21.57 ± 10.92 ± 0.080.14 ± 0.031.1F104A10 ± 59 ± 111 ± 53.16 ± 220 ± 34 ± 13.1E106A11 ± 10.91 ± 0.070.9 ± 0.21.612.0 ± 0.61.31 ± 0.010.11 ± 0.011.0H107A12 ± 20.19 ± 0.020.17 ± 0.040.6010.0 ± 0.80.19 ± 0.020.019 ± 0.002−0.03L108A7 ± 10.34 ± 0.050.5 ± 0.21.27 ± 20.46 ± 0.050.07 ± 0.020.76L112A6 ± 20.09 ± 0.040.14 ± 0.020.505 ± 10.19 ± 0.030.04 ± 0.010.4E114A5 ± 20.5 ± 0.11.2 ± 0.81.76 ± 20.8 ± 0.20.13 ± 0.021.1E114D4 ± 20.38 ± 0.061.2 ± 0.71.75 ± 10.7 ± 0.10.13 ± 0.011.1E114K5 ± 31.72 ± 0.076 ± 62.84 ± 22.7 ± 0.21 ± 12.4E114Q3 ± 22.0 ± 0.110 ± 73.04.2 ± 0.93.4 ± 0.10.8 ± 0.12.2R119A7 ± 40.10 ± 0.070.2 ± 0.10.629 ± 30.36 ± 0.090.04 ± 0.020.46R121A7 ± 30.04 ± 0.030.04 ± 0.02−0.2211 ± 10.15 ± 0.030.014 ± 0.002−0.21K130A5 ± 30.05 ± 0.030.10 ± 0.020.318 ± 20.17 ± 0.010.022 ± 0.0040.06K130T7 ± 30.05 ± 0.020.09 ± 0.080.238 ± 20.11 ± 0.020.016 ± 0.006−0.13K130R4.5 ± 0.30.04 ± 0.020.10 ± 0.050.268 ± 30.13 ± 0.030.02 ± 0.010.056K130END 1-bND indicates binding not detected.NDNDNDNDNDNDNDV151A6 ± 10.05 ± 0.020.08 ± 0.050.128 ± 20.06 ± 0.040.011 ± 0.007−0.37P153A5 ± 20.11 ± 0.040.25 ± 0.070.836.3 ± 0.90.22 ± 0.020.035 ± 0.0070.34c1(E106A,E114A,R119A,K130A)2 ± 1(6 ± 2) × 10(9 ± 16) × 1005.7 (4.2) 1-cFor c1, c2, c3 and c4, the ΔΔG values listed in the parentheses are the predicted ΔΔG values assuming each single substitution acts independently.3.1 ± 0.284 ± 227 ± 24.3 (2.0)c2(H107A,E114A,R121A,K130A)3.0 ± 0.91.5 ± 0.36 ± 32.7 (2.4)6 ± 10.6 ± 0.20.11 ± 0.011.0 (0.9)c3(E106A,E114A,R121A,K130A)1.2 ± 0.410 ± 1(9 ± 3) × 104.3 (3.4)5 ± 26.8 ± 0.21.5 ± 0.52.6 (2.0)c4(H107A,E114A,R119A,K130A)3.5 ± 0.67 ± 120 ± 73.4 (3.3)7 ± 13.8 ± 0.60.54 ± 0.012.0 (1.6)1-a WT, wild type.1-b ND indicates binding not detected.1-c For c1, c2, c3 and c4, the ΔΔG values listed in the parentheses are the predicted ΔΔG values assuming each single substitution acts independently. Open table in a new tab Crystal structures of protein-protein complexes usually reveal a large interface, suggesting the involvement of many side chains that are collectively called structural epitopes. However, the number of side chains actually shown to be important for binding by alanine mutagenesis is usually small. The latter amino acids are called the functional epitopes. We mutated 15 residues in the hIL-18BP which either had been predicted to be at the interface with IL-18 based on the crystal structure of the related IL-1β·IL-1R1 complex (18Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar) or were conserved in Ig domains of hIL-18BP and two viral IL-18BP homologs (Fig. 5). When replaced by alanine, four of the mutated hIL-18BPs exhibited more than a 5-fold decrease in binding affinity with IL-18, and three exhibited more than a 50-fold decrease. The effects on binding caused by the single alanine substitutions are unlikely to have been caused by global changes in IL-18BP structure for the following reasons. Alanine scanning mutagenesis has been used successfully to probe many protein-protein interfaces. Statistically, alanine is not a β-strand breaker and is found in the middle of β-strands a, c,f, and g of the IL-1R1 domain 3. In fact, most of the alanine substitutions in IL-18BP caused small changes in affinity, and those that produced large changes caused a small or no effect on the on-rate. Furthermore, with the c2 and c4 mutations, the binding free energy changes were almost exactly the sum of free energy changes caused by the four individual substitutions. This result suggested that the mutations did not cause major structural changes and that the residues 107, 114, 119, 121, and 130 interact independently with IL-18. With the c1 and c3 mutations, the binding free energy changes were somewhat greater than the sums of those caused by the individual substitutions. However, because c1 and c3 bound poorly to IL-18, the surface plasmon resonance data did not have as good a fit to the 1-to-1 binding model as for the other mutations. We constructed structural models for each mutated hIL-18BP based on the published wild type hIL-18BP structural model (18Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). After energy minimization of the mutated hIL-18BP structure models, the root mean square deviations of the entire structure from the wild type structure were calculated (data not shown). There was little difference in the deviations between those mutations that caused more than a 5-fold change in affinity and those that did not, consistent with the absence of large structural perturbations caused by alanine mutagenesis. The sequence alignment and the results of our binding data together suggest that the functional epitopes cluster in β-strandsc and d of the Ig domain and point their side chains outward. Residues 93–99 of hIL-18BP were confidently predicted by the PhD program (25Rost B. Methods Enzymol. 1996; 266: 525-539Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to form a β-strand, and identical or conservative amino acids are present in corresponding positions of the MC54L and evp16 IL-18BPs. In addition, these sequences align very well with the sequences that form the β-strand c of IL-1R1 domain 3. Like the c-strand of nearly all Ig domains, a tryptophan is found at position 98 of hIL-18BP and at the corresponding positions of MC54L, evp16, and IL-1R1. In all of the Ig domain structures examined, this conserved tryptophan points its side chain inward, which is thought to be crucial for folding (26Ioerger T.R. Du C. Linthicum D.S. Mol. Immunol. 1999; 36: 373-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). As a result, residues 93, 95, 97, and 99 would point their side chains outward in a β-strand. This is consistent with our finding that residues 93, 97, and 99 all contributed significantly to binding, with residue 97 contributing around 25% of the binding free energy. A model, based on the known structure of the complex of IL-1β and IL-1R1, predicted that amino acids 93–99 of IL-18BP are in the β-strand and that residues 93, 95, and 97 would be important for binding to IL-18 (Fig.5). Our results minimized the role of residue 95. Compared with the confidence in predicting the locations of residues 93, 97, and 99 in a three-dimensional structure, the locations of residues 104, 106, 108, and 114 are less certain. This is because different Ig domains vary considerably in the length and the sequences of amino acids between the c- and e-strands (27Williams A.F. Barclay A.N. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 381-405Crossref PubMed Scopus (1791) Google Scholar). In our multiple alignment of the Ig domains of IL-18BPs and IL-1R1 domain 3, there is a gap of seven amino acids between residue 103 and 104 of hIL-18BP. This gap was created because the sequences before and after the gap are similar among the three IL-18BPs and because the additional seven amino acids in evp16 and IL-1R1 share three identical residues. This gap suggests that the β-turn between the c- and d-strands of IL-1R1 domain 3 is maintained in evp16 but is shortened in hIL-18BP and MC54L. Residues 103–107 and 111–115 of hIL-18BP were also predicted by the PhD program to form β-strands. We suggest, therefore, that the d-strand of hIL-18BP includes residues 103–115. This strand may be broken in the middle by proline at 109 and glycine at 110. This is similar to the a-strand of IL-1R1 domain 3, which has a proline in the middle of the strand which breaks the strand into two smaller but parallel strands. Residues 104, 106, 108, and 114 of the hIL-18BP all contribute significantly to the binding, suggesting that they face outward, whereas residue 107 does not. Our assignment of residues 104, 106, and 108 to thed-strand is different from the previous prediction (18Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M. Dinarello C.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 1190-1195Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar). In that model, residues 102–110 form a β-turn that is similar in size to the β-turn between the c- and d-strands of IL-1R1 domain 3; consequently, residues 106 and 108 are located further away from the interface with IL-18 and would not seem capable of making contact with IL-18 (Fig. 5). Phenylalanine 93, tyrosine 97, and phenylalanine 104 together contributed ∼65% of the free energy for binding of hIL-18BP to IL-18. This is similar to the situation for human growth hormone binding to its receptor in which two tryptophans contribute three-quarters of the binding free energy (28Clackson T. Wells J.A. Science. 1995; 267: 383-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (1793) Google Scholar). Such “hot spots” in protein-protein interactions frequently involve tryptophan, tyrosine, and arginine (29Bogan A.A. Thorn K.S. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 280: 1-9Crossref PubMed Scopus (1639) Google Scholar). Phenylalanine is also involved, although with lower frequency. Tryptophan and tyrosine can participate in hydrogen bonding, π-interactions, and van der Waals interactions, accounting for their important role in protein-protein interactions. Phenylalanine can participate in π- and van der Waals interactions but not hydrogen bonds. The tendency of hot spot residues to be at the center of a protein-protein interface reinforces the predicted locations of residues 93 and 97 in the c-strand and residue 104 in thed-strand. Our finding that a small number of residues of hIL-18BP contributed the majority of the binding free energy suggests that a small molecule mimicking the relative small functional epitopes may be possible. One starting point for such an antagonist is a peptide comprising the c- and d-strands of hIL-18BP which have been constrained so as to bring them together side by side. Alternatively, a phage display library with a bias toward the known important residues may be used to find a peptide that binds tightly with IL-18. We developed a facile procedure for coupling hIL-18BP to sensor chips which should be applicable to other recombinant proteins. The coding sequence of hIL-18BP was modified to contain a C-terminal tail that included a flexible linker, a biotin holoenzyme synthetase biotinylation recognition sequence, and a six-histidine tag. After transfection of mammalian cells with an expression plasmid, the secreted hIL-18BP was captured on metal affinity resin via the polyhistidine tag. Biotinylation was achieved by incubating the resin with biotin holoenzyme synthetase and biotin, after which the hIL-18BP was eluted with imidazole and directly bound to a streptavidin-coated sensor chip. The coupling of the recombinant protein to the chip surface via a single biotin attached to a flexible tail should allow a uniform protein conformation and minimize steric hindrance to ligand binding. It is possible that this improvement was responsible for theKd of 0.06 nm obtained here compared with the higher value of 0.4 nm reported previously using protocols in which nonspecific amine coupling was used to attach hIL-18BP (17Xiang Y. Moss B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 11537-11542Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar) or rhIL-18 (18Kim S.H. Eisenstein M. Reznikov L. Fantuzzi G. Novick D. Rubinstein M.

Virol. 1992; 66: 5047-5058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), an increasingly important family of viruses due to the recent identification of the first human γ-2 herpesvirus, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (8Chang Y. Cesarman E. Pessin M.S. Lee F. Culpepper J. Knowles D.M. Moore P.S. Science. 1994; 265: 1865-1869Crossref Scopus (5015) Google Scholar). Gene expression during HVS lytic replication is sequentially regulated and occurs in three main temporal phases: immediate-early, delayed-early, and late. The two major HVS transcriptional regulating proteins are encoded by the open reading frames (ORFs) 50 and 57 (9–12). ORF 57 is a 52-kDa multifunctional trans-regulatory protein homologous to genes identified in all classes of herpesviruses. Transactivation of late viral genes by ORF 57 occurs independently of target gene promoter sequences and appears to be mediated at a post-transcriptional level (11Whitehouse A. Cooper M. Meredith D.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 857-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In addition to its transactivation properties, ORF 57 is responsible for repression of viral gene expression, which correlates with the presence of introns within the target gene (11Whitehouse A. Cooper M. Meredith D.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 857-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 12Whitehouse A. Cooper M. Hall K.T. Meredith D.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 1967-1973Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). ORF 57 also redistributes both U2 and SC-35 splicing factors during an HVS infection into intense distinct nuclear aggregations (13Cooper M. Goodwin D.J. Hall K.T. Stevenson A.J. Meredith D.M. Markham A.F. Whitehouse A. J. Gen. Virol. 1999; 80: 1311-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). Recent analysis has demonstrated that the ORF 57 protein has the ability to bind viral RNA and shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm, and is required for efficient cytoplasmic accumulation of virus mRNA. This suggests that ORF 57 plays a pivotal role in mediating the nuclear export of viral transcripts (6Goodwin D.J. Hall K.T. Stevenson A.J. Markham A.F. Whitehouse A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10519-10524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An intriguing question regarding the functioning of virus-encoded nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins is the mechanism they utilize to be transported through the nuclear pore complex. Macromolecule trafficking into and out of the nucleus is mediated by soluble transport receptors (reviewed in Ref. 14Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). These receptors bind specific proteins or RNA cargoes and interact with nuclear pore proteins, which subsequently allow the translocation of the receptor cargo through the nuclear pore complex. Recently, CRM-1 (for chromosomal region maintenance 1) or exportin 1, a protein that shares homology with members of the importin-karyopherin nuclear transport pathway, has been identified as a nuclear export receptor for proteins, including HIV-1 Rev, carrying a leucine-rich NES in a process that also requires the GTP-bound form of Ran (15Fornerod M. Ohno M. Yoshida M. Mattaj I.W. Cell. 1997; 90: 1051-1060Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1744) Google Scholar, 16Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 767-775Crossref Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Furthermore, CRM-1 has been shown to interact with nuclear pore complex proteins, namely the nucleoporins CAN/Nup214 and Nup88 (16Ossareh-Nazari B. Bachelerie F. Dargemont C. Science. 1997; 278: 767-775Crossref Scopus (623) Google Scholar), suggesting that CRM-1 is the bridging protein for the interactions of NES-containing proteins and the nuclear pore complex. However, it has recently been shown for the herpesviruses HSV-1 and Epstein-Barr virus that, although export of some viral RNAs require the CRM-1 pathway, a proportion of viral RNA export can be mediated by a CRM-1-independent pathway (17Soliman T.M. Silverstein S.J. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 2814-2825Crossref PubMed Scopus (56) Google Scholar, 18Farjot G. Buisson M. Dodon M.D. Gazzolo L. Sergeant A. Mikaelian I. J. Virol. 2000; 74: 6068-6076Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). This suggests that at least some herpesvirus nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins may function through a distinct, as yet unidentified, export mechanism. In addition, it is tempting to speculate that the virally encoded nucleocytoplasmic shuttle proteins must interact with cellular nuclear import pathways. The most widely characterized transport pathway mediates the nuclear import of proteins that contain a classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) (reviewed in Ref. 14Görlich D. Kutay U. Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol. 1999; 15: 607-660Crossref PubMed Scopus (1676) Google Scholar). These basic, generally lysine-rich NLS serve as recognition sites for an NLS receptor termed importin α or karyopherin α (19Weis K. Mattaj I.W. Lamond A.I. Science. 1995; 268: 1049-1053Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar), which forms a heterodimeric complex with importin β or karyopherin β. Importin β functions as a transport adapter molecule binding to the nuclear pore complex via a direct interaction with specific nucleoporins (20Görlich D. Henklien P. Laskey R.A. Hartmann E. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1810-1817Crossref PubMed Scopus (363) Google Scholar,21Weis K. Ryder U. Lamond A.I. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 1818-1825Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Once in the nucleus, binding of Ran-GTP to importin β causes dissociation of the import complex (22Rexach M. Blobel G.

EMBO J. 1996; 15: 5584-5594Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar). Once released from the cargo, importin subunits are then recycled to the cytoplasm. Importin β is recycled rapidly, whereas the export of importin α is mediated by the nuclear export factor, CAS, which binds importin α preferentially in the presence of Ran-GTP (24Kutay U.

In the cytoplasm the importin molecules are released by the action of RanBP1 and RanGAP1 (27Coutavas E. Ren M. Oppenheim J.D. D'Eustachio P. Rush M.G.

The yeast two-hybrid system was employed to identify interacting cellular proteins using ORF 57 as bait. Here we show that ORF 57 interacts with importin α isoforms 1 and 5. Confirmation of this interaction was provided by co-immunoprecipitation experiments from transfected and infected cells. In addition, the binding of ORF 57 to importin α is mediated via the hydrophobic, internal, importin α armadillo (arm) repeats. Moreover, an ORF 57 amino-terminal arginine-rich sequence, which functions as an NLS, is required for this interaction. Furthermore, the ORF 57 protein is responsible for the redistribution of importin α into the nucleoli. The GAL4-based yeast two-hybrid system screening technique (30Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglanz R. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1224) Google Scholar) was employed to identify ORF 57-interacting proteins. The “bait” plasmid was constructed by PCR amplication of the ORF 57 coding region using forward and reverse primers. These oligonucleotides incorporatedBamHI and PstI restriction sites for the convenient cloning of the PCR fragment into pGBT9 (CLONTECH), to derive the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fusion, pDBD57. A human kidney cDNA-GAL4 activation domain fusion library in the vector pACT2 (CLONTECH) was utilized to identify ORF 57-interacting proteins. The bait plasmid was transformed into the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain HF7c (CLONTECH). Clones were selected on minimal synthetic dropout medium in the absence of tryptophan. Yeast clones harboring the bait plasmids were then sequentially transformed with the “prey” library. Positive clones, potentially harboring ORF 57-interacting species, were identified both by their ability to grow on media without tryptophan, leucine, and histidine and by the detection of β-galactosidase activity. Plasmids were isolated from positive yeast clones, selecting for pACT2 cDNA library plasmids by transformation of the leucine auxotroph into Escherichia coli strain HB101. To confirm the specificity of the interactions, pACT-2 library plasmids were transformed into yeast strains harboring no plasmid, yeast containing pGBT9 vector only, yeast containing pLAM5 (a GAL4 human lamin C fusion), or pDBD57. Only those library plasmids demonstrating a requirement for the pDBD57 plasmid for induced expression of HIS3 or lacZ reporter genes were considered further and selected for DNA sequencing. The yeast two-hybrid importin α1 and α5 deletion series were produced by a PCR-based method using a series of forward and reverse primers. The oligonucleotides incorporatedBamHI and XhoI restriction sites for the convenient cloning of the PCR products. Each fragment was inserted into the yeast two-hybrid expression vector, pACT2, in frame with the GAL4-AD, to derive the deletion series pADα1Δ1–6 and pADα5Δ1–5. The bacterial expression importin α1 and α5 deletion series were produced by cloning the α1 and α5 deletion PCR fragments into pGEX5T, to derive the GST fusion constructs, pGSTα1Δ1–4 and pGSTα5Δ1–5. The yeast two-hybrid ORF 57 deletion series was produced by a PCR-based method using a series of forward and reverse primers. The oligonucleotides incorporated BamHI and PstI restriction sites for the convenient cloning of the PCR products. Each fragment was inserted into the yeast two-hybrid expression vector, pGBT9, in frame with the GAL4-DBD, to derive the deletion series pDBD57Δ1–5. The ORF57-GFP and ORF 57 amino-terminal deletion series were again generated by PCR amplication, again using a series of forward and reverse primers. These oligonucleotides incorporatedBamHI and PstI restriction sites to facilitate cloning of the PCR product into the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNAGFP (Invitrogen), to yield p57GFP and p57NΔ1–3GFP. To produce p57NLS-GFP, oligonucleotides encoding the putative ORF 57 NLS, nucleotides in bp 78580–78820 of the published sequence (7Albrecht J.C. Nicholas J. Biller D. Cameron K.R. Biesinger B. Newman C. Wittman S. Craxton M.A. Coleman H. Fleckenstein B. Honess R.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5047-5058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), were synthesized. These oligonucleotides incorporated BamHI andXhoI restriction sites, for convenient cloning. The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated with pEGFP-C1 (CLONTECH) to create an in-frame carboxyl-terminal fusion of the NLS sequence and GFP. To produce p57NLSM1–4, containing alterations within the putative ORF 57 NLS, oligonucleotides that incorporated the alteration of arginines and lysine to alanine residues were synthesized encompassing nucleotides in bp 78677–78774 of the published sequence. These oligonucleotides incorporatedBglII and PflMI restriction sites, for convenient cloning into pBKRSV57 (11Whitehouse A. Cooper M. Meredith D.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 857-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), previously digested with BglII and PflMI, thereby replacing the wild type coding region with the site-directed mutated sequence. The importin α1-GFP and α5-GFP constructs were generated by PCR amplication of the complete α1 and α5 cDNA sequences using forward and reverse primers. These oligonucleotides incorporatedBamHI and XhoI restriction sites to facilitate cloning of the PCR products. Each fragment was inserted into the eukaryotic expression vector, pcDNAGFP (Invitrogen) to yield pα1-GFP and pα5-GFP, respectively. These constructs contained a carboxyl-terminal GFP fusion tag, which allowed direct visualization of the importin α-GFP proteins using fluorescence microscopy. To produce pSV40NLS-RFP, oligonucleotides encoding the SV40 NLS, PKKKRKV, were synthesized. These oligonucleotides incorporated XhoI andBamHI restriction sites, for convenient cloning. The oligonucleotides were annealed and ligated with pDsRed1-N1 (CLONTECH) to create an in-frame carboxyl-terminal fusion of the SV40 NLS and RFP. The sequences of all primers used in this report can be obtained directly from the authors. HVS (strain A11) was propagated in owl monkey kidney cells, which were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10%fetal calf serum. COS-7 cells were also maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10%fetal calf serum. Plasmids used in the transfections were prepared using Qiagen plasmid kits according to the manufacturer's directions. Transfections were performed using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer, using 2 μg of the appropriate DNAs. COS-7 cells either remained untransfected, were transfected using 2 μg of the appropriate DNAs, or were infected with HVS at a multiplicity of infection of 1. After 48 h, cells were harvested and lysed with lysis buffer (0.3m NaCl, 1%Triton X-100, 50 mm HEPES buffer, pH 8.0) containing protease inhibitors (leupeptin and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). For each immunoprecipitation, 10 μl of the ORF 57 polyclonal (31Goodwin D.J. Hall K.T. Giles M.S. Calderwood M.A. Markham A.F. Whitehouse A. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2253-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or GFP monoclonal antiserum (CLONTECH) were incubated with protein A-Sepharose beads (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted, washed, and incubated with each respective cell lysate for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted and washed, and precipitated polypeptides were resolved on a 12%SDS-polyacrylamide gel and analyzed by immunoblot analysis. Polypeptides were resolved on a 12%SDS-polyacrylamide gel, then soaked for 10 min in transfer buffer (25 mm Tris, 192 mm glycine, 20%methanol (v/v)). The proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting for 3 h at 250 mA. After transfer, the membranes were soaked in PBS and blocked by preincubation with 2%(w/v) nonfat milk powder for 2 h at 37 °C. Membranes were incubated with a 1:400 dilution of the anti-importin α1,α5 polyclonal antisera or a 1:1000 dilution of anti-GFP (CLONTECH), washed with PBS, and then incubated for 1 h at 37 °C with a 1:1000 dilution of secondary immunoglobulin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Dako) in blocking buffer. After five washes with PBS, the nitrocellulose membranes were developed using ECL (Pierce). The importin α-deletion series were expressed as GST fusion proteins in E. coli DH5α. A fresh overnight culture of transformed E. coli was diluted 1 in 20 with LB medium. After growth at 37 °C for 2 h, the culture was induced with 1 mm IPTG and grown at 37 °C for an additional 4 h. The cells were harvested and resuspended in 0.1 volume of lysis buffer (100 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mm NaCl, 1%Triton X-100). Cells were sonicated and stored on ice for 30 min, and cellular debris pelleted. The recombinant protein was purified from crude lysates by incubation with glutathione-Sepharose 4B affinity beads. The protein-bound beads were then incubated with untransfected or appropriate transfected COS-7 cell lysates previously treated with lysis buffer for 16 h at 4 °C. The beads were then pelleted and washed, and precipitated polypeptides resolved on a 12%SDS-polyacrylamide gel. The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by electroblotting and probed as described previously. Cells were fixed with 100%ice-cold methanol for 10 min. The cells were rinsed in PBS and blocked by preincubation with 1%(w/v) nonfat milk powder for 1 h at 37 °C. A 1:100 dilution of anti-ORF 57 polyclonal antiserum (31Goodwin D.J. Hall K.T. Giles M.S. Calderwood M.A. Markham A.F. Whitehouse A. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2253-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) or 1:50 dilution of B23 monoclonal antibody was layered over the cells and incubated for 1 h at 37 °C. Texas Red-conjugated immunoglobulin (Dako; 1:200 dilution) was added for 1 h at 37 °C. After each incubation step, cells were washed extensively with PBS. The immune fluorescence slides were examined using a Zeiss Axiovert 135TV inverted microscope with a Neofluar 40× oil immersion lens. Northern blot analysis was performed as previously described (6Goodwin D.J. Hall K.T. Stevenson A.J. Markham A.F. Whitehouse A. J. Virol. 1999; 73: 10519-10524Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Total, nuclear, and cytoplasmic RNA was isolated from transfected cells and separated by electrophoresis on 1%denaturing formaldehyde-agarose gel. The RNA was transferred to Hybond-N membranes and hybridized with 32P-radiolabeled random-primed probes specific for gB and actin coding sequences. To identify ORF 57-interacting cellular proteins, 1.5 × 106independent cDNA clones of a human kidney cDNA library fused to the GAL4 activation domain were screened. 24 clones were identified that activated histidine and β-galactosidase reporter gene expression in the presence of the ORF 57-DBD fusion protein. The specificity of the interaction was confirmed by transforming the putative ORF 57-interacting cellular clones into yeast strains harboring no plasmid, yeast containing pGBT9 vector only, yeast containing pLAM5 (a GAL4 human lamin C fusion), or pDBD57. Only those library plasmids demonstrating a requirement of pDBD57 for induced expression of histidine and β-galactosidase reporter genes were considered further. Clones that fulfilled all these criteria were sequenced and BLAST searched against the EMBL/GenBank™ data base. Analysis revealed that seven ORF 57-interacting clones corresponded to importin α1/karyopherin α2/Rch1 and that four clones corresponded to importin α5/karyopherin α1/hSRP1. To confirm whether the observed interaction of ORF 57 with importin α1 or α5 could also be observed in vitro, co-immunoprecipitation studies were performed. Control untransfected COS-7 cells were compared with cells transfected with pRSVORF57, a eukaryotic expression vector encoding the complete coding region of ORF 57 (11), or HVS-infected cells (multiplicity of infection of 1). After 24 h, the cells were harvested and cell lysates utilized in co-immunoprecipitation analysis using an anti-ORF 57 polyclonal antiserum. Polypeptides precipitated from untransfected, transfected, and infected cellular extracts were then resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Immunoblot detection was performed using antiserum specific for importin α1 or α5. The results demonstrate that, in both ORF 57-transfected and HVS-infected cells, ORF 57 specifically interacts with both importin α1 and α5 (Fig. 1). To map the domains within importin α1 and α5 required for their specific interaction with ORF 57, a series of importin α1 and α5 truncations were expressed as fusions with GAL4-AD (Fig.2 a). Competent yeast strain HF7c was co-transformed with pDBD57 and each importin truncation AD plasmid, and assessed for their ability to grow on selective medium. The results indicated that the ORF 57 binding region maps to amino acids 291–450 of importin α1 and amino acids 253–459 of importin α5, encompassing the central 5–8 arm repeats in both cases. Smaller deletions within these regions of either importin α abolished the interaction, suggesting that all the 5–8 armadillo repeats are required for ORF 57 binding. To confirm these results in vitro, GST pull-down assays were performed. The importin α1 and α5 deletion series were expressed as GST fusion proteins. Protein extracts prepared from p57GFP-transfected cells were incubated with each GST-importin α fusion protein bound to glutathione beads. To confirm the expression of ORF57-GFP in each experiment, fluorescence microscopy was utilized (data not shown). Bound proteins were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and the presence of ORF57-GFP was detected by Western blotting using a GFP monoclonal antibody (Fig. 2 b). Results demonstrated that ORF 57 specifically bound to GST-importin α1Δ3 and GST-importin α5Δ5, corresponding to the respective arm 5–8 repeats. An ORF57-GFP tagged expression vector was utilized in this experiment due to the lack of reactivity of the ORF 57 polyclonal antiserum in Western blot analysis, as reported previously (31Goodwin D.J. Hall K.T. Giles M.S. Calderwood M.A. Markham A.F. Whitehouse A. J. Gen. Virol. 2000; 81: 2253-2265Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). A GFP alone control was also utilized in this experiment and was shown not to interact with any of the GST-importin α fusion proteins (data not shown). To delineate the domains within ORF 57 required for its specific interaction with importin α1 and α5, a series of ORF 57 deletions were expressed in yeast as fusions with GAL4-DBD (Fig. 3 a). Competent yeast strain HF7c was co-transformed with either importin α1-AD or importin α5-AD and each of pDBD57Δ1–6, and assessed for the ability to grow on selective medium. The results indicated that the amino terminus of ORF 57 is required for its interaction with importin α1 and α5. Further deletions identified a relatively arginine-rich region, encompassing bp 78580–78820 of the published sequence (7Albrecht J.C. Nicholas J. Biller D. Cameron K.R. Biesinger B. Newman C. Wittman S. Craxton M.A. Coleman H. Fleckenstein B. Honess R.W. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5047-5058Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), required for the interaction with importin α1 and α5. To confirm whether the ORF 57 amino-terminal arginine-rich sequence was required for the interaction with importin α1 and α5, co-immunoprecipitation analysis was performed using an ORF 57 amino-terminal deletion series (Fig. 4). Control untransfected COS-7 cells were compared with cells transfected with the pORF57-GFP or p57NΔ1–3. To confirm the expression of ORF 57-GFP and deletions in each experiment, fluorescence microscopy was utilized (data not shown). After 24 h, the cells were harvested and cell lysates utilized in co-immunoprecipitation analysis using the GFP antiserum. Polypeptides precipitated were resolved on SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membranes, and immunoblot detection was performed using antiserum specific for importin α1 or importin α5. The results demonstrate that the amino-terminal arginine-rich sequence of ORF 57 is required for its interaction with importin α1 and α5 (Fig. 4). To determine if the arginine-rich sequence functions as a NLS, the subcellular localization of the ORF 57 amino-terminal deletion series was analyzed. These constructs contained a carboxyl-terminal GFP fusion tag, allowing direct visualization. Transient p57NΔ1–3 transfections were performed, and the resulting fluorescence pattern was subsequently evaluated. pcDNAGFP was used as a control and displayed, as expected, a fluorescence signal throughout the cell nucleus and cytoplasm. In contrast, p57GFP and p57NΔ1 resulted in a distinct nuclear localization reminiscent of that observed previously with HVS-infected and ORF57-transfected cells (11Whitehouse A. Cooper M. Meredith D.M. J. Virol. 1998; 72: 857-861Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). However, p57NΔ2 and p57NΔ3 resulted in fluorescence restricted to the cytoplasm. This indicated that the arginine-rich sequence contained within the amino terminus is required to direct the ORF57 protein to the nucleus (Fig.5 a). To confirm that the arginine-rich sequence functions as a NLS, and enables nuclear import of a heterologous protein, the NLS was fused with GFP. COS-7 cell monolayers were transfected with either pEGFP-C1 or p57NLS-GFP, and the subcellular localization of GFP was observed. The results show that cells transfected with pEGFP-C1 displayed a fluorescence pattern throughout the cell, in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. However, the fluorescence pattern observed in p57NLS-GFP-transfected cells was confined to the nucleus and in particular the nucleolus (Fig. 5 b). Furthermore, to determine the importance of the arginine and lysine residues for ORF 57 nuclear localization, a range of site-directed mutations were constructed, p57NLSM1–4, incorporated the alteration of varying residues within the putative NLS to alanine (Fig.5 c). COS-7 cell monolayers were transfected with either p57GFP or p57NLSM1–4, and the subcellular localization of GFP was observed. The results show that cells transfected with p57GFP displayed a nuclear fluorescence pattern as observed previously. However, the fluorescence pattern observed in p57NLSM1–4-transfected cells was confined to the cytoplasm (Fig. 5 d). This suggested that the ORF 57 amino-terminal arginine-rich sequence functions both as a NLS and possibly a"

The human type I interferons, IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-ω, induce somewhat different cellular effects but act through a common receptor complex, IFNAR, composed of subunits IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2. Human IFNAR-2 binds all type I IFNs but with lower affinity and different specificity than the IFNAR complex. Human IFNAR-1 has low intrinsic binding of human IFNs but strongly affects the affinity and differential ligand specificity of the IFNAR complex. Understanding IFNAR-1 interactions with the interferons is critical to elucidating the differential ligand specificity and activation by type I IFNs. However, studies of ligand interactions with human IFNAR-1 are compromised by its low affinity. The homologous bovine IFNAR-1 serendipitously binds human IFN-αs with nanomolar affinity. Exploiting its strong binding of human IFN-α2, we have identified residues important for ligand binding. Mutagenesis of any of five aromatic residues of bovine IFNAR-1 caused strong decreases in ligand binding, whereas mutagenesis of proximal neutral or charged residues had smaller effects. These residues were mapped onto a homology model of IFNAR-1 to identify the ligand-binding face of IFNAR-1, which is consistent with previous structure/function studies of human IFNAR-1. The topology of IFNAR-1/IFN interactions appears novel when compared with previously studied cytokine receptors. Interferons have antiviral, antigrowth and immunomodulatory effects.

Therefore, much can be learned about IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 from the structurally well-defined related receptors, including the interferon-γ receptor (IFNGR-1) (30Walter M.R. Windsor W.T.

In the cases of IFNGR-1, IFNGR-2, growth hormone receptor, tissue factor, and IFNAR-2 there are two FNIII domains, each containing ∼100 amino acids with seven β-strands and connecting loops. The extracellular domain of IFNAR-1 is atypical, consisting of a tandem array of four FNIII domains, here denoted subdomains 1 through 4 (SD1–4; beginning from the N terminus). The four-domain structure of IFNAR-1 appears to represent a tandem duplication of the more common two-domain structure (27Bazan J.F. Immunol.

The low intrinsic affinity of HuIFNAR-1 for IFNs has hampered studies seeking to identify residues involved in ligand binding and specificity. Previously, the identity of elements of the ligand binding site of HuIFNAR-1 could only be deduced indirectly from studies involving antibody epitope mapping (40Lu J. Chuntharapai A. Beck J. Bass S.

Without large-scale mutagenesis and ligand binding analysis, key residues could not be identified in HuIFNAR-1. The bovine IFNAR-1 homologue is an attractive target for mutagenesis and analysis of the IFN binding site. Although the type I interferons are predominantly species-specific, human interferons display uniformly high binding and biological activity on bovine cells (3Pestka S. Langer J.A. Zoon K.C. Samuel C.E. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1987; 56: 727-777Crossref PubMed Scopus (1605) Google Scholar, 44Rehberg E. Kelder B. Hoal E.G. Pestka S. J. Biol.

This appears to reflect the ability of bovine IFNAR-1 (BoIFNAR-1) to bind human type I IFNs with moderately high affinity. Thus, human or murine cells expressing BoIFNAR-1 greatly increase their responsiveness to a variety of human type I IFNs (18Lim J.K. Xiong J. Carrasco N. Langer J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 47Mouchel-Vielh E. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.E. Uze G.

The nanomolar binding affinity of BoIFNAR-1 for HuIFN-αs provides an elegant way to circumvent difficulties in the studies of the human IFN type I receptor complex (47Mouchel-Vielh E. Lutfalla G.

The protein consists of a 24-amino acid signal sequence, a 414-amino acid extracellular domain, a 24-amino acid transmembrane sequence, and a 98-amino acid cytoplasmic domain. The human and murine IFNAR-1 proteins share 68 and 46% amino acid sequence identity, respectively, with BoIFNAR-1 (6Uzé G. Lutfalla G. Gresser I. Cell. 1990; 60: 225-234Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (513) Google Scholar, 48Lim J.K. Langer J.A. Biochim. Biophys.

A. 1992; 89: 4774-4778Crossref PubMed Scopus (85) Google Scholar). This high sequence identity, combined with an overall structural conservation, has allowed us to use BoIFNAR-1 in place of HuIFNAR-1 in studies directed at identifying structural features contributing to HuIFN ligand binding. The ability of BoIFNAR-1 to bind HuIFNs in the nanomolar range has been well characterized using a variety of systems (18Lim J.K. Xiong J. Carrasco N. Langer J.A. FEBS Lett. 1994; 350: 281-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar, 23Langer J.A. Yang J. Carmillo P. Ling L.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). COS-1 cells transfected with BoIFNAR-1 cDNA express very high levels (0.5–1.0 × 106/cell) of nanomolar affinity binding sites for HuIFN-α2a, -α8b, -α1b, -β, and -ω (11Cutrone E.C. Langer J.A. FEBS Lett. 1997; 404: 197-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar, 48Lim J.K. Langer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 49Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Dang A. Hao X.M. Lim J.K. Langer J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13003-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Consistent with these results, a soluble BoIFNAR-1/Fc fusion protein bound HuIFN-α2a with an affinity of at most 10 nm (the true affinity is expected to be closer to a Ki of 0.14 nm (23Langer J.A. Yang J. Carmillo P. Ling L.E. FEBS Lett. 1998; 421: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar)). All human type I IFNs tested were able to compete with HuIFN-α2a for binding to BoIFNAR-1/Fc, although they varied in affinity. Thus, the extracellular domain of BoIFNAR-1 by itself displays moderate affinity and differential binding of a broad range of human type I IFNs. Previously, we used BoIFNAR-1 to regionally localize the determinants that confer strong binding of IFN (49Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Dang A. Hao X.M. Lim J.K. Langer J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13003-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). A series of 14 HuIFNAR-1/BoIFNAR-1 chimeric receptors representing various human/bovine subdomain substitutions were assayed for their ligand binding properties. Only when the two central domains of BoIFNAR-1 (SD2 and SD3) were simultaneously substituted into the HuIFNAR-1 was a significant increase in the binding of HuIFN-α2a measured over the low affinity binding characteristic of HuIFNAR-1, indicating that ligand binding was focused in this region. The BoIFNAR-1 N-terminal (SD1) and membrane-proximal (SD4) domains each further enhanced binding when transferred with SD2 and SD3 into HuIFNAR-1 (49Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Dang A. Hao X.M. Lim J.K. Langer J.A. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13003-13010Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Thus, the IFN binding site is not localized on one FNIII subdomain or even on one tandem pair of FNIII subdomains, as previously predicted from other cytokine family members (43Seto M.H. Harkins R.N. Adler M. Whitlow M. Church W.B. Croze E. Protein Sci. 1995; 4: 655-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar); instead the ligand-binding determinants of IFNAR-1 appear to be distributed in a more complex array centered on SD2 and SD3. Kumaran et al. (52Kumaran J. Colamonici O.R. Fish E.N. J. Interferon Cytokine Res. 2000; 20: 479-485Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) used murine/human IFNAR-1 hybrids to confirm that SD1 plays at most a minor role in species-specific ligand binding. The current study of BoIFNAR-1 identifies amino acids that are critical for IFN binding, using a series of alanine substitutions throughout its extracellular domain. By presenting these results in the context of a new three-dimensional homology model of IFNAR-1, we shed light on the interaction of type I IFNs with IFNAR-1. IFN-α2a (1.56 × 108 IU/mg) was provided by Dr. Sidney Pestka. The M2 anti-FLAG antibody was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co.R-Phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Jackson ImmunoResearch. Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM, Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% cosmic calf serum (HyClone), 2 mm glutamine (Sigma), and 10 units/ml penicillin with 10 μg/ml streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.), was used to maintain all cell lines. The HuIFN-α2a analogue IFN-α2a-P1 (53Li B.-L. Langer J.A. Schwartz B. Pestka S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 558-562Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) was phosphorylated to a radiospecific activity of ∼1 × 103 Ci/mmol with [γ-32P]ATP (6000 Ci/mmol, PerkinElmer Life Sciences) and bovine heart cAMP-dependent protein kinase (Sigma). This corresponds to a fractional labeling of ∼0.15 mol of 32P/mol of protein. For simplicity, [32P]IFN-α2a-P1 is referred to as [32P]IFN-α2. Bovine and Human IFNAR-1 were transiently expressed from the EF-1α promoter in the vector pcDEF3 (54Goldman L.A. Cutrone E.C. Kotenko S.V. Krause C.D. Langer J.A. BioTechniques. 1996; 21: 1013-1015Crossref PubMed Scopus (152) Google Scholar). Unique restriction sites were engineered into the bovine IFNAR-1 cDNA by using oligonucleotides containing silent mutationsRsrII, BspEI, AgeI, andNheI. These restriction sites were placed between each respective subdomain and at the beginning of the transmembrane domain, resulting in a modified version of BoIFNAR-1. This version of BoIFNAR-1 was also tagged with the FLAG epitope (55Hopp T.P. Prickett K.S. Price V. Libby R.T. March C.J. Cerretti P. Urdal D.L. Conlon P.J. Bio/Technology. 1988; 6: 1205-1210Crossref Scopus (754) Google Scholar) between the signal peptide and the beginning of the first subdomain of the protein, allowing for its recognition on the cell surface. Mutations were engineered into the receptor using either a two-step splice overlap extension (SOE) polymerase chain reaction method (56Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 57Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) or the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All clones were screened by restriction digests and confirmed by sequencing. In most cases altered receptors were analyzed using two independent clones, to eliminate false decreases in binding due to reasons other than the engineered mutation. Mutants were made from the BoIFNAR-1 cDNA template in three different versions of pcDEF-3 at various stages in this project. The BoIFNAR-1 gene was the same for all three; however, the first had an HA tag at the N terminus (which was not effective for flow cytometric detection); in the second, the HA tag was replaced with a FLAG epitope to allow for cell surface confirmation by flow cytometry; the third version contained an internal ribosome entry site coupled to enhanced green fluorescent protein (IRES-EGFP) (CLONTECH) after the FLAG-bovine IFNAR-1, and a zeocin marker in place of the original neomycin marker. These plasmids, when transfected into COS cells, were indistinguishable in their transient BoIFNAR-1 expression and IFN binding. The two-step Splice Overlap Extension (SOE) polymerase chain reaction method (56Ho S.N. Hunt H.D. Horton R.M. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 51-59Crossref PubMed Scopus (6851) Google Scholar, 57Horton R.M. Hunt H.D. Ho S.N. Pullen J.K. Pease L.R. Gene. 1989; 77: 61-68Crossref PubMed Scopus (2648) Google Scholar) was carried out using ELongase (Life Technologies, Inc.). SOE fragments were restriction-digested and then ligated into the proper vector. All reactions were carried out in a 50-μl volume in 0.5-ml thin-wall tubes in a PerkinElmer Life Sciences DNA thermal cycler. The QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit was used according to the manufacturer's directions (Stratagene), except that template and primer concentrations were doubled; extension time was increased to 3.5 min per kilobase; and DH10B Electromax competent cells (Life Technologies, Inc.) were used for transformations. COS-1 cells (58Gluzman Y. Cell. 1981; 23: 175-182Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1460) Google Scholar), derived from a simian kidney CV-1 line, were transfected with 5–10 μg of plasmid using the DEAE-dextran/Me2SO shock protocol (48Lim J.K. Langer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 59Seed B. Aruffo A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Briefly, tissue culture dishes (10-cm dish, Falcon) containing 10 ml of 10% cosmic calf (Hyclone) serum-supplemented DMEM were seeded with 1.75–2.0 × 106 cells. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C before transfecting. Cells were harvested for assays after 48–72 h. Under our transfection conditions, we generally see about 0.25–1 × 106 receptors per cell, averaged over the entire cell population, as measured by ligand binding to BoIFNAR-1. This arises from high level expression on 20–50% of the cell population, as demonstrated by flow cytometry detection of the common FLAG epitope at the N terminus. Much of this expression variability is between experiments; within any experiment, the variation of expression between constructs has a much smaller range. Each clone was transfected at least two times, and for most mutations binding was measured with transfections of two independent DNA clones. Saturation binding assays were done as previously described (48Lim J.K. Langer J.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1993; 1173: 314-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Briefly, COS cells were trypsinized and resuspended to 1 × 106 cells/ml. Aliquots of cells, with and without excess cold IFN (1–3 μg/ml), were combined with [32P]IFN-α2 (maximum concentration of 1.5–4 × 10−9 m), serially diluted, and then incubated while rocking for 1 h at room temperature. Cell-bound [32P]IFN-α2 was separated from unbound by brief centrifugation of 100 μl of sample through a cushion of 10% (w/v) sucrose in PBS. Tubes were then frozen and cut, and the tips and tops were counted separately. Suppliers' determinations of IFN concentration (in mg/ml) were used for all calculations. Data were analyzed by non-linear regression to one-site binding using the program Prism v.2.01 (GraphPad Software, Inc., San Diego, CA). A mutant receptor that lost 75% of the binding seen for unaltered BoIFNAR-1 was defined as having a significant loss of binding activity. Among the mutants, there is a clear demarcation between those mutants that lost 75–100% and a secondary group of mutants, which lost 0–56% of binding. This criterion is consistent with thresholds used in studies of other receptors (61Cunningham B.C. Wells J.A. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 234: 554-563Crossref PubMed Scopus (487) Google Scholar, 62Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (312) Google Scholar, 63Wells J.A. Bio/Technology. 1995; 13: 647-651PubMed Google Scholar) and with the accuracy and precision of our data, thereby guarding against over-interpretation of marginal effects. Transfected cells were resuspended in DMEM supplemented with 5% cosmic calf serum (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells (7.5 × 105 to 1.25 × 106 in 25 μl) were incubated for 1 h at 4 °C with 25 μl (0.12–0.25 μg) of primary antibody (M2 anti-FLAG antibody, Sigma) or medium. The cells were washed with PBS and resuspended in 50 μl (0.125 μg) of secondary antibody (R-phycoerythrin-conjugated F(ab′)2 goat anti-mouse IgG, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and incubated for 1 h. Cells were again washed with PBS and then incubated in 100 μl of 3% paraformaldehyde at 4 °C for 1 h. The cells were washed once with 1 ml of PBS containing 50 mm Tris and then resuspended in 500 μl of PBS with 50 mm Tris and stored at 4 °C until analysis with a Coulter Epics Profile II cell sorter. Homology models were generated for the extracellular domains of bovine and human IFNAR-1, based on the coordinates of the extracellular domain of IFNGR-1 (30Walter M.R. Windsor W.T. Nagabhushan T.L.

Mark Walter (University of Alabama, Birmingham) and Steve Ealick (Cornell University). The homology model was created using GeneMine (LOOK v.3, Molecular Applications Group) and manipulated with GeneMine and Sybyl (Tripos, Inc.). The IFNAR-1 (4-domain receptor) was modeled against IFNGR-1 (2-domain receptor) in two steps. Because of the size disparity, it was necessary to separately model the N-terminal half (SD1 and SD2) and the C-terminal half (SD3 and SD4) of the receptor. This procedure is consistent with the finding that the four domains of IFNAR-1 likely evolved from a tandem duplication of a two-domain ancestor, which diverged to generate the cytokine receptor superfamily (27Bazan J.F. Immunol. Today. 1990; 11: 350-354Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar, 38Gaboriaud C. Uze G. Lutfalla G. Mogensen K.

The sequence alignment of the N- and C-terminal halves of bovine and human IFNAR-1 with HuIFNGR-1 is shown in Fig.1, with β-strands from the crystal structure of IFNGR-1 indicated (underlined in the sequence) and sequentially labeled as B1–B7 within a FNIII domain. The alignments are facilitated by the similar sequence lengths and conserved characteristic residues of IFNGR-1 and the N- and C-terminal halves of IFNAR-1. Sequence alignments were similar with GCG version 9.0 and with ClustalW. (Expected loops are designated by the flanking β-strands: e.g. the loop connecting β-strands 4 and 5 is denoted “L4–5.”) As commonly observed within families of homologous proteins, the “core” β-sheet structure is well conserved, and much of the variability arises in the interstrand loops, particularly the loops L2–3 and L4–5 in SD2 and SD4 of IFNAR-1.

The combined use of these denaturing agents allowed detection of two partially folded states of α3-1, as monitored by circular dichroism, intrinsic fluorescence emission, and fluorescence of the hydrophobic probe bis-ANS (4,4′-dianilino-1,1′-binaphthyl-5,5′-disulfonic acid). The overall free-energy change for complete unfolding of α3-1, determined from GdnHCl unfolding data, is +4.6 kcal/mol. The native state is stabilized by −1.4 kcal/mol relative to a partially folded pressure-denatured intermediate (I1). Cold denaturation at high pressure gives rise to a second partially (un)folded conformation (I2), suggesting a significant contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the stability of α3-1. The free energy of stabilization of the native-like state relative to I2 is evaluated to be −2.5 kcal/mol. Bis-ANS binding to the pressure- and cold-denatured states indicates the existence of significant residual hydrophobic structure in the partially (un)folded states of α3-1. The demonstration of folding intermediates of α3-1 lends experimental support to a number of recent protein folding simulation studies of other three-helix bundle proteins that predicted the existence of such intermediates.

However, recent simulation studies have suggested the existence of intermediate states during the folding of a small model three-helix bundle protein (9Boczko E.M. Brooks III C.L.

Karplus M. Nature. 1999; 401: 400-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Three-helix bundles represent a simple folding motif found in a variety of soluble and membrane proteins, including spectrin (13Yan Y. Winograd E. Viel A. Cronin T. Harrison S.C. Branton D. Science. 1993; 262: 2027-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (337) Google Scholar) and the extramembranous portion of Staphylococcus aureus protein A (14Pascual J. Pfuhl M. Rivas G. Pastore A. Saraste M. FEBS Lett. 1996; 383: 201-207Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Using sequence patterns discovered in coiled coils, the synthesis of amphiphilic α-helices that self-assemble into three- or four-helix bundles stabilized by a hydrophobic core has been successfully achieved (15Regan L. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1988; 241: 976-978Crossref PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar, 16Hill C.P. Anderson D.H. Wesson L. DeGrado W.F. Eisenberg D.

The de novo design of proteins represents a versatile tool to gain insight into the interplay of forces resulting in conformational stability. Artificial proteins are generally less complex than their native counterparts but at the same time retain the features responsible for the folding process. Recently, Johansson and co-workers (18Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Skalicky J.J. Wand A.S. Dutton P.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3881-3886Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) reported the synthesis and initial characterization of a native-like three-helix bundle protein, designated α3-1. The three different helices of this 65-amino acid polypeptide are joined by (glycine)4 linkers. NMR solution studies revealed a well structured conformation with α-helical secondary structure. GdnHCl1-induced unfolding of α3-1 followed by CD revealed a Gibbs free-energy of unfolding of +4.6 kcal/mol (18Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Skalicky J.J. Wand A.S. Dutton P.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3881-3886Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar), comparable to that observed for small monomeric natural proteins of similar size, such as myoglobin (7.6 kcal/mol) (19Makhatadze G.I. Privalov P.L. Adv. Protein Chem. 1995; 47: 307-425Crossref PubMed Scopus (1004) Google Scholar) or the 43-amino acid residue peripheral subunit-binding domain of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (3.1 kcal/mol) (20Spector S. Kuhlmann B. Fairman R. Wong E. Boice J.A. Raleigh D.P. J. Mol. Biol. 1998; 276: 479-489Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). In the last two decades, hydrostatic pressure has been extensively used as a reversible thermodynamic variable to characterize subunit association in oligomeric proteins (21Gross M. Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar, 22Mozhaev V.V. Heremans K. Frank J. Masson P. Balny C. Proteins. 1996; 24: 81-91Crossref PubMed Scopus (636) Google Scholar). In general, unfolding of monomeric proteins requires significantly higher pressures (i.e., 5–7 kilobars (kbar)) than those required for subunit dissociation of oligomers (typically up to 3.5 kbar) (21Gross M. Jaenicke R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1994; 221: 617-630Crossref PubMed Scopus (623) Google Scholar). Few examples to date demonstrate denaturation of monomeric proteins at pressures below 3 kbar. In the present study, we have used a combination of hydrostatic pressure (up to 3.5 kbar) and low temperatures to investigate the folding stability of α3-1. Interestingly, our results revealed the existence of partially (un)folded intermediate states of α3-1, giving support to the predictions from the above mentioned simulation studies. Bis-ANS binding studies revealed the existence of significant residual hydrophobic structure in the pressure-denatured and especially in the cold-denatured state of α3-1, suggesting molten globule-like conformations for these intermediates. All reagents were of the highest analytical grade available. Distilled water was filtered and deionized through a Millipore water purification system. Bis-ANS was from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). The design, synthesis, and purification of α3-1 have been previously described (18Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Skalicky J.J. Wand A.S. Dutton P.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3881-3886Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of α3-1 is given below in single-letter codes. The sequence is arranged in heptads, with the coiled-coil heptad positions labeled a through g (TableI). The N terminus of the peptide is acetylated, and the C terminus is amidated.Table IHeptad sequencesa b c d e f g a b c d e f g a b c dLoopHelixR V K A L E E K V K A L E E K V K A LGGGGIR I E E L K K K W E E L K K K I E E LGGGGIIE V K K C E E E V K K L E E E I K K LIII Open table in a new tab Unless otherwise indicated, fluorescence emission spectra were measured at 25 °C on a spectrofluorometer (PC 1, ISS Inc., Champaign, IL). For intrinsic fluorescence measurements, excitation was at 280 nm and emission spectra were recorded from 300 to 420 nm. Bis-ANS fluorescence was measured with excitation at 375 nm and emission from 420 to 600 nm. Fluorescence measurements under pressure were performed using a pressure cell similar to that originally described by Paladini and Weber (23Paladini Jr., A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar), equipped with sapphire optical windows. The temperature of the pressure cell was controlled by means of a jacket connected to a circulating bath and was monitored by a telethermometer. All experiments were carried out in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, containing 130 mm NaCl. Protein concentration in all experiments was 2 μm (determined with a UV-visible Ultraspec 2000 spectrometer (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using ε280 = 5700 m−1cm−1), and bis-ANS concentration, when used, was 1.0 μm. All samples were deoxygenated by bubbling with a stream of nitrogen for 5 min prior to the experiments. In low temperature experiments, the windows of the pressure bomb were flushed with nitrogen to prevent condensation. Fluorescence spectral centers of mass (intensity-weighted average emission wavelengths, λav) were calculated with software provided by ISS Inc. as follows,λav=ΣλI(λ)/ΣI(λ)Equation 1 where λ is the emission wavelength and I(λ) represents the fluorescence intensity at wavelength λ. Shifts in the spectral center of mass were converted into extent of denaturation (αp) at each pressure according to the following phenomenological relationship (24Weber G. van Eldyk R. Jonas J. High Pressure Chemistry and Biochemistry, NATO ASI Ser. 197. D. Reidel Publishing Company, Dordrecht/Boston/Lancaster/Tokyo1987: 401-420Google Scholar):αp=1/[1+Q(λp−λU/λN−λp)]Equation 2 where λN and λU are the spectral centers of mass of native-like and fully unfolded protein obtained in the absence of denaturant and in the presence of a high concentration of GdnHCl, respectively, λp is the spectral center of mass at pressure p, and Q is the ratio of fluorescence quantum yields of unfolded and native-like α3-1. The equilibrium unfolding of α3-1 by GdnHCl was initially investigated. Control measurements showed that unfolding was very rapid and was complete within a few minutes after addition of GdnHCl. Samples were incubated at increasing GdnHCl concentrations for 2 h at room temperature, and intrinsic fluorescence emission spectra were recorded. Unfolding was accompanied by a significant red shift of the fluorescence emission of α3-1 (Fig. 1), indicating increased exposure of the single tryptophan residue (Trp-32) to the aqueous medium. Fig. 1 (inset) shows the degree of denaturation (α) of α3-1 as a function of GdnHCl concentration. For comparison, data on the unfolding of α3-1 monitored by far-UV CD measurements (18Johansson J.S. Gibney B.R. Skalicky J.J. Wand A.S. Dutton P.L. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1998; 120: 3881-3886Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) have also been included. A single, cooperative transition from the native to the unfolded state was observed in both fluorescence and CD measurements. The almost exact superimposition of the unfolding profiles revealed by fluorescence and CD suggests that, in the presence of GdnHCl, the transition between native and unfolded α3-1, at atmospheric pressure and room temperature, is essentially a two-state transition with no evidence for the existence of populated folding intermediates. Fig. 1 also shows that unfolding of α3-1 takes place between 1 and 3 m GdnHCl, with a transition mid-point at 2.4 m GdnHCl. Fig. 2 shows the effect of pressure on the fluorescence spectral center of mass of α3-1 in the absence or in the presence of GdnHCl. In the absence of GdnHCl (triangles) the center of mass did not reach a plateau even at the highest pressure used (3.5 kbar), indicating that complete unfolding was not achieved by the pressurization of α3-1. From the equilibrium GdnHCl unfolding experiments (Fig. 1) it is apparent that GdnHCl concentrations up to 1 m are subdenaturing for α3-1. Pressure unfolding experiments were then repeated in the presence of different subdenaturing concentrations of GdnHCl (0.4 m and 1 m, Fig.2) to poise the system toward unfolding. Although addition of 0.4m GdnHCl had little effect on the pressure sensitivity of α3-1, pressure denaturation in the presence of 1m GdnHCl exhibited a clearly defined plateau of the spectral centers of mass at about 342 nm (Fig. 2). It is important to note that fully unfolded α3-1 (i.e. in the presence of 6 m GdnHCl) exhibited a very red-shifted fluorescence emission, with a spectral center of mass of 355 nm. Thus, the plateau observed for the spectral center of mass of the pressure-denatured state at 342 nm seems to correspond to a stable partially unfolded intermediate. Upon stepwise release of pressure, the fluorescence spectra underwent a blue shift and reached complete recovery of the spectral center of mass at atmospheric pressure (data not shown), indicating reversible refolding of α3-1 to a state qualitatively similar to the native-like protein. The fluorescence changes thus indicate that application of pressure in the presence of a subdenaturing concentration of GdnHCl (1 m) induced a transition to a stable conformation different from the fully denatured state induced by 6 m GdnHCl. The pressure unfolding data for α3-1 were analyzed using a two-state model for monomer unfolding. The dimensionless equilibrium denaturation constant at atmospheric pressure (K0) and the molar volume change of folding (ΔV) can be calculated from the following thermodynamic relation,Kp=K0exp(pΔV/RT)Equation 3 where Kp is the denaturation constant at pressure p, and R and T have their usual meanings. The equation can be rewritten by introducing the degree of unfolding, αp, at pressure p:ln[αp/(1−αp)]=lnK0+p(ΔV/RT)Equation 4 where ln[αp/(1 − αp)] equals lnKp for the denaturation of a monomer. Thus, a plot of ln[αp/(1 − αp)] versuspressure (Fig. 2, lower panel) yields the molar volume change of folding (ΔV) from the slope and lnK0 from the intercept on the ordinate. The parameters obtained for pressure unfolding of α3-1 are shown in Table II.Table IIThermodynamic parameters of different (partially) denatured states of α3-1GdnHCl denaturationPressure-denatured state (I1)Cold-denatured state (I2)ΔGunf= 4.6 ±0.3 kcal/mol2-aData from Ref.18.ΔV= 17 ml/mol=2.3 μl/gΔHunf=−7.1 kcal/mollnK = −2.3TΔSunf = −8.2 kcal/molΔGunf = 1.4 ± 0.1 kcal/mol2-bCalculated assuming a two-state transition from native to the pressure-denatured state, using the relation ΔG = −RTlnK0, T = 298 K.ΔGunf = 1.1 ± 0.2 kcal/mol, relative to I12-cCalculated assuming a two-state transition from pressure to cold-denatured states, as described in the text.ΔGunf=2.5 kcal/mol, relative to the native-like state2-a Data from Ref.18Johansson J.S.

Open table in a new tab To further characterize the existence of folding intermediates of α3-1, we carried out low temperature unfolding experiments under pressure. The freezing point of water is significantly decreased under pressure (25Bridgman P.W. The Physics of High Pressure. G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., London1931Google Scholar), allowing aqueous samples to be analyzed at sub-zero temperatures without the need for addition of cryosolvent additives. Fig. 3 shows the fluorescence spectral centers of mass of α3-1 as a function of decreasing temperature at 3.5 kbar in the absence and in the presence of 1.0 m GdnHCl. The starting points of the two curves (at 25 °C) are similar to the spectral centers of mass obtained in the pressure denaturation experiments at the corresponding GdnHCl concentrations. In the absence of GdnHCl (circles) the spectra became progressively red-shifted but did not reach a plateau at low temperatures (down to −12 °C), indicating that a stable partially (un)folded intermediate had not been reached. By contrast, in the presence of 1.0 m GdnHCl, a further red shift of the fluorescence emission occurred, with a low temperature plateau observed at about −10 °C. Interestingly, the fluorescence spectra of the cold-denatured state and the completely unfolded protein (i.e., in 6 m GdnHCl) differ by about 8 nm in spectral center of mass (Fig. 4). After return of the sample to room temperature the fluorescence spectral center of mass returned to the original value, reflecting the reversibility of the process (Fig. 3, open symbols).Figure 4Fluorescence emission spectra of native (1), pressure-denatured (2), cold-denatured (3), and fully unfolded α3-1 in the presence 7 m GdnHCl (4). Pressure unfolding was obtained by incubation with 1 m GdnHCl and increasing the pressure to 3.5 kbar and 25 °C (see Fig. 1). Cold denaturation was obtained by applying pressure up to 3.5 kbar in the presence of 1 mGdnHCl and decreasing the temperature to −10 °C (see Fig. 2). Spectra are normalized for maximal emission intensity.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) At constant pressure the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant for a two-state unfolding transition is described by the van't Hoff equation,ΔG/T=(1/T)ΔH−ΔS=−RlnKTEquation 5 where KT is the equilibrium constant for denaturation at temperature T and ΔGis the corresponding Gibbs free-energy change. From a plot ofΔG/T versus the inverse temperature, the changes in enthalpy (ΔH) and entropy (ΔS) of unfolding can be extracted (Fig. 3,lower panel). The thermodynamic parameters obtained from such analysis are summarized in Table II. The environment-sensitive fluorescent dye bis-ANS was used to characterize different partially folded conformations of α3-1. Bis-ANS tends to bind exposed hydrophobic surfaces in partially folded intermediates more tightly than both the native and random coil states of proteins (26York S.S. Lawson R.C. Worah D.M. Biochemistry. 1978; 21: 4480-4486Crossref Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Bis-ANS binding is accompanied by an increase in its fluorescence quantum yield, as well as by a blue shift of the fluorescence emission. On the basis of the increase in bis-ANS fluorescence, the pressure-denatured state of α3-1 bound more bis-ANS than the native-like state, and the cold-denatured state exhibited significantly stronger binding (Fig. 5). In addition, bis-ANS binding to the cold-denatured state was also accompanied by a 14-nm blue shift of the fluorescence emission. Structural transitions of a single-chain 65-amino acid three-helix bundle polypeptide, α3-1, induced by hydrostatic pressure and by a combination of low temperature and high pressure revealed the existence of partially folded intermediate states, which are not observable in GdnHCl unfolding experiments of this model protein. Bis-ANS binding studies support the idea that organized hydrophobic surfaces persist, or can form, at both high pressures and low temperatures. Taken into account the “new view” of protein (un)folding, which models the chain collapse of a polypeptide by a multiple pathways “funnel,” our results suggest that one possible unfolding transition of α3-1 can be summarized by the following scheme,N⇄I1⇄I2⇄USCHEME1where N is the native-like and U is the unfolded state, andI1 and I2 represent the two partially (un)folded intermediates revealed in high pressure and low temperature experiments, respectively (Fig.6). Pressure-induced changes in the intrinsic fluorescence emission spectrum of α3-1 took place between atmospheric pressure and 2.5 kbar in the presence of a subdenaturing concentration (1m) of GdnHCl. The shift in spectral center of mass from 335 to 342 nm indicates partial exposure of the previously solvent-shielded tryptophan at the central heptad a position of helix II to the aqueous environment. The single-chain polypeptide nature of α3-1 renders this native-like three-helix bundle of particular interest for pressure unfolding studies. It is generally assumed that pressures below 5 kbar do not significantly disturb the secondary or tertiary structures of proteins (27Weber G. Drickamer H.G. Q. Rev. Biophys. 1983; 1: 89-112Crossref Scopus (446) Google Scholar). Hydrogen bonds, the stabilizing elements of helices and β-sheets, are permanent dipoles and relatively insensitive to pressure changes. Moreover, the volume change attendant on replacement of protein-protein hydrogen bonds by protein-water hydrogen bonds is rather small. Therefore, pressure-induced unfolding of small monomeric proteins is generally only observed at high temperature (28Zipp A. Kauzmann W. Biochemistry. 1973; 21: 4217-4228Crossref Scopus (425) Google Scholar), at low pH (29Brandts J.F. Oliveira R.J. Westwort C. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1038-1047Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar, 30Royer C.A. Hinck P. Loh S.N. Prehoda K.E. Peng X. Jonas J. Markely J.L. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 5222-5232Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar), or with mutant proteins (31Eftink M.R. Ghiron C.A. Kautz R.B. Fox R.K. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1193-1199Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 32Prevelige P.E. King J. Silva J.L. Biophys. J. 1994; 66: 1631-1641Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The finding that α3-1 can be unfolded by pressure in the presence of a subdenaturing concentration of GdnHCl opens interesting possibilities for further studies of the stability of helical bundles and, in particular, of the structure of the pressure-stabilized partially folded state. It is interesting to compare the volume change measured for the unfolding of α3-1 with the volume changes reported for pressure denaturation of other proteins. The specific volume changes observed upon dissociation of dimeric proteins are dependent on the molecular weight. Arc repressor (Mr 13,000), for example, shows a specific volume change of −7.7 μl/g (33Silva J.L. Silveira C.F. C.orreia A. Pontes L. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 223: 545-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar), whereas Enolase (Mr 80,000) is reported to have a change in volume of −0.7 μl/g (23Paladini Jr., A. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1981; 20: 2587-2593Crossref PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar). This can be explained by a larger proportion of buried amino acid residues, which becomes exposed to the solvent upon dissociation in smaller dimers, because in these cases the subunit interfaces involve a larger fraction of the entire structure. Alternatively, volume changes can also be interpreted in terms of the balance of forces responsible for protein stability. Disruption of electrostatic interactions leads to a large decrease in volume caused by electrostriction of water around the unpaired charged residues (34Newman R.C. Kauzmann W. Zipp K. J. Phys. Chem. 1973; 77: 2687-2691Crossref Scopus (330) Google Scholar). By contrast, breaking of hydrophobic interactions is accompanied by much smaller volume changes. The denaturation of monomeric proteins is accompanied by similar effects, resulting in stronger hydration and the replacement of longer dispersion bonds by shorter dipolar interactions. Therefore, the relatively large specific volume change of 2.3 μl/g observed for the folding transition of the intermediateI1 to the native-like state N of α3-1 (Table II) occurs most likely with the burial of polar side-chain groups. Cold denaturation experiments at high pressures take advantage of the depression of the freezing point of water (25Bridgman P.W. The Physics of High Pressure. G. Bell and Sons, Ltd., London1931Google Scholar). Such an experimental setup and the presence of a subdenaturing concentration of GdnHCl allowed characterization of another folding intermediate, which showed strong bis-ANS binding. Destabilization of proteins at low temperatures indicates a significant contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the folding process. Studies of the small dimeric protein Arc repressor showed that folding and association are accompanied by the displacement of solvent molecules, suggesting the burial of previously solvent-exposed nonpolar side chains (35Foguel D. Silva J.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 8244-8247Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar). According to Privalov (36Privalov P.L. Makhatadze G. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 660-679Crossref PubMed Scopus (385) Google Scholar), hydration of polar residues decreases the entropy of the folding process. On the other hand, Weber (37Weber G. J. Phys. Chem. 1993; 97: 7108-7115Crossref Scopus (80) Google Scholar) described the entropy-driven condensation of proteins as a consequence of the conversion of stronger solvent-protein interactions into weaker (entropy-rich) protein-protein interactions (London dispersion forces). In several cases, protein-protein interactions involved in folding and subunit association have indeed been found to be predominantly entropy-driven. For example, the subunit association of hexokinase is characterized by a strong entropic contribution (TΔS = +38 kcal/mol), which outweighs the unfavorable enthalpy of +17 kcal/mol (38Ruan K. Weber G. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 3295-3301Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The folding of α3-1 reveals an entropy-driven transition from I2 to I1, with TΔS = +8.2 kcal/mol at 25 °C and a van't Hoff enthalpy of ΔH = +7.1 kcal/mol, resulting in −1.1 kcal/mol of conformational stability (ΔG). The entropy-driven nature of theI2 → I1 transition suggests that a hydrophobic collapse may be involved at this stage of folding of α3-1. The design of α3-1 contains six distinct hydrophobic core layers, each consisting of three amino acids of either two aand one d or one a and two d heptad positions of the corresponding helices I, II, and III. Very likely, these areas are involved in formation of the organized hydrophobic domains revealed by bis-ANS binding at low temperatures. Of note is that the changes in intrinsic fluorescence emission of α3-1 induced by pressure and low temperature were fully reversible, indicating that the protein refolds to a state that is qualitatively similar to the native-like state upon return to atmospheric conditions. The folding of small (<100 amino acid residues), single-domain proteins is assumed to occur in a concerted fashion well accounted for by a two-state transition without well populated intermediates (39Jackson S.E. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10428-10435Crossref PubMed Scopus (867) Google Scholar,40Scalley M.L. Yi Q. Gu H. McCormack A. Yates J.R. Baker D. Biochemistry. 1997; 36: 3373-3382Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). On the other hand, there is strong evidence, especially from hydrogen exchange experiments, that partially folded conformations can be present (41Clarke J. Fersht A.R. Fold. Des. 1996; 1: 243-254Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar, 42Kim K.S. Woodward C.K. Biochemistry. 1993; 32: 9600-9608Crossref PubMed Scopus (205) Google Scholar). For a number of proteins, residual structure has been detected and linked to partially folded states, which are believed to be important as nucleation sites for condensation (43Arcus V.L. Vulleumier S. Freund S.M. Bycroft M. Fersht A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9412-9416Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar, 44Kippen A.D. Sancho J. Fersht A.R. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3778-3786Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). For example, small patterns of stable residual structure were found in barnase during acid denaturation and were assumed to be formed during the early stage of folding (45Fersht A.R. FEBS Lett. 1993; 325: 5-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In addition, urea denaturation of the chaperonin GroEL also revealed persistent hydrophobic surfaces at high urea concentrations as probed by bis-ANS binding (46Gorovits B.M. Seale J.W. Horowitz P.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 13928-13933Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Low temperature unfolding studies of β-lactamase provided evidence for the existence of two equilibrium intermediates between native and unfolded states (47Uversky V.N. Ptitsyn O.B. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2782-2791Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar). Small synthetic helical proteins that undergo metal-directed transitions from molten globule-like to native-like states via folding intermediates have also been reported (48Handel T.M. Williams S.A. DeGrado W.F. Science. 1993; 261: 879-885Crossref PubMed Scopus (262) Google Scholar, 49Liebermann M. Tabet M. Sasaki T. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1994; 116: 5035-5038Crossref Scopus (61) Google Scholar). Thermodynamic calculations of a model three-helix bundle using either a simple off-lattice or an all-atom approach revealed the existence of a metastable minimum (9Boczko E.M. Brooks III C.L. Science. 1995; 269: 393-396Crossref PubMed Scopus (367) Google Scholar, 10Guo Z. Brooks III C.L. Boczko E.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

In addition, Zhou and Karplus (12Zhou Y. Karplus M.

Nature. 1999; 401: 400-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The phase diagram could be varied by changing a single parameter related to the relative stability of native and non-native contacts. The simulation revealed that the folding mechanism for helical proteins changes from a cooperative (diffusion-collision) transition to one that involves on-pathway intermediates depending on the difference between the strength of native and non-native interactions (12Zhou Y. Karplus M. Nature. 1999; 401: 400-403Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Our results on α3-1 give direct support to the idea that even small helical bundle proteins may indeed present metastable folding intermediates, which can be detected under appropriate experimental conditions designed to stabilize them. In conclusion, the present results, together with the small size of this three-helix bundle protein, make α3-1 an ideally suited system for detailed protein folding studies. In this regard, an interesting possibility could be the use of high pressure NMR studies to characterize the structure of the folding intermediates. A.

A 178-base pair promoter was sufficient to drive high level expression of the α7 gene in PC12 cells. The α7 promoter was also cell-specific, expressing in PC12 cells but not in L6 rat muscle cells. Within our minimal rat α7 nAChR promoter we identified two sequences important for basal level expression. Mutation of a GC-rich sequence at −172 relative to the translational start site led to an increase in activity of the promoter, indicating the presence of a negative regulatory element. Upstream stimulatory factor-1 acted to regulate α7 expression positively by binding to an E-box at −116. A site directly adjacent to the upstream stimulatory factor-1 binding site was shown to bind Egr-1. Sp1 and Sp3 binding also occurred downstream from or overlapping the Egr-1 binding site in the rat α7 promoter.

One specific subtype of neuronal nAChR is sensitive to α-bungarotoxin and composed of α7 subunits. α7 nAChRs possess several characteristics that set them apart from most nAChRs. α7 nAChRs have a high level of Ca2+ permeability, similar to that of the N-methyl-d-aspartate subtype of glutamate receptors (17Lindstrom J. Mol. Neurol. 1997; 15: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). α7 nAChRs also rapidly desensitize and are expressed both extrasynaptically (or perisynaptically) on neuronal soma and at presynaptic nerve terminals (17Lindstrom J. Mol. Neurol. 1997; 15: 193-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar, 18McGehee D.S. Role L.W. Annu. Rev.

Science. 1995; 269: 1692-1697Crossref PubMed Scopus (913) Google Scholar). Given all of the above functions of α7 nAChRs, it is clear that precise mechanisms function to control the time and place of α7 gene expression. Because α7 nAChRs are most likely homo-oligomeric receptors (at least some of them), regulation of α7 gene expression controls the location and timing of α7 nAChR functions. To examine the mechanisms that control expression of the α7 gene, we have isolated a rat nAChR α7 subunit promoter and identified DNA sequences and transcription factors important in regulation of the rat α7 gene. A rat genomic library in the vector EMBL SP6/T7 was purchased from CLONTECH. Approximately 106 clones were plated and lifted onto Hybond N+ filters (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). The filters were probed using a full-length rat α7 cDNA (15Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit (Stratagene) (28Feinberg A.P. Vogelstein B. Anal. Biochem. 1983; 132: 6-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (16653) Google Scholar). Each positive clone was reprobed twice before the DNA was isolated. Several bacteriophage clones were restriction mapped and partially sequenced. DNA sequencing completed in our laboratory was performed using the dideoxynucleotide chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) with Sequenase T7 polymerase (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Oligonucleotide primers (Operon; Alameda CA) were designed as needed to complete the sequence. Additional sequencing was done at the Ohio State University Sequencing facility with an Applied Biosystems model 373A. Nucleotide sequences were analyzed using GeneWorks (Intelligenetics) and MatInspector version 2.1. RNA was purified from PC12 cells using Trizol (Life Technologies, Inc.). Northern blot analysis was performed using 1% (w/v) agarose gels containing 7.4% (v/v) formaldehyde in 20 mm MOPS, 1 mm EDTA, and 5 mmsodium acetate at pH 7.0. 10 μg of RNA was run on each lane of the gel. After electrophoresis, the RNA was transferred to GeneScreen Plus (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) in 10 × SSC according to the manufacturer's instructions. Rat α3 or α7 cDNA was labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using the Prime-It RmT random primer labeling kit. The 32P-labeled probes (α3 and/or α7) were hybridized to the GeneScreen Plus membrane in 5 × SSPE, 50% deionized formamide, 5 × Denhardt's solution, 1% SDS, 10% dextran sulfate, and 100 μg/ml salmon sperm DNA at 42 °C. The filters were washed in 2 × SSPE at room temperature, 2 × SSPE, 2% SDS at 65 °C and in 0.1 × SSPE for 45 min, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 15 min. The blots were exposed to x-ray (Kodak XAR-5) film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. A Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager was also used to quantify the signal intensities in each lane. 32P-Labeled antisense RNAs were synthesized from the SstII-SstII* fragment and the BstYI-SstII fragment (see Fig. 1) using Ambion's MAXIscriptTM in vitro transcription kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. These RNA probes were hybridized to 300 pg of a synthetic sense RNA (as a positive control), 10 μg of total PC12 cell RNA, or 10 μg of total liver RNA at a molar excess using Ambion's HybSpeedTM RPA kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Single-stranded RNA was digested by incubating for 60 min at 37 °C with a 1:50 dilution of RNase A and Tl mix (RNase A 1.0 mg/ml, 500 units/ml; and RNase Tl, 20,000 units/ml). The RNA was precipitated with ethanol and RNase HybSpeed inactivation/precipitation mix and electrophoresed in a 5% or 8% polyacrylamide gel containing 8 m urea. The gels were dried onto a Whatman 3MM paper and exposed to x-ray (Kodak XAR-5) film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. A 2.3-kbKpnI fragment isolated from the α7 genomic clones was shown to contain exons 1 and 2 as well as 1.2 kb of 5′-flanking region. The 1-kb KpnI-BstYI fragment, the 178-bpBstYI-SstII fragment, and the 1.2-kbKpnI-SstII fragment from this 2.3-kbKpnI piece were subcloned into the vector pGL2-Basic (Promega) upstream from a luciferase reporter gene. Additional constructs containing a 319-bp BstYI-SstII* fragment and a 60-bp 5′-deletion of the 319-bpBstYI-SstII* fragment were made by synthesizing these fragments using the Advantage-GC cDNA polymerase chain reaction kit (CLONTECH) with appropriate oligonucleotide primers (Operon) and subcloning these products into pGL2-Basic. Point mutations were made in the 178-bpBstYI-SstII fragment using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). Briefly, complementary mutagenic oligonucleotide primers containing the desired mutation were annealed to the 178-bp BstYI-SstII luciferase construct plasmid and polymerase chain reaction withPfu Turbo DNA polymerase used to synthesize a new mutant plasmid. The complementary oligonucleotides used to create the GC mutant were 5′-GGATGCAGTTCCC TAAT CGGCCACGGAGCTGCACGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCGTGCAGCTCCGTGGCCG ATTA GGGAACTGCATCC-3′, whereas the complementary oligonucleotides used to create the E-box mutant were 5′-CGAGACGGGAGCGCGCTGTC TAT TGTGGGGGCG-3′ and 5′-CGCCCCCACA ATA GACAGCGCGCTCCCGTCTCG-3′. The complementary oligonucleotides used to make the Egr-1 mutant were 5′-CTGTCACGTGTG AAA GCGCGCCGCGGC-3′ and 5′-GCCGCGGCGCGC TTT CACACGTGACAG-3′. The sequence changes introduced are in bold and underlined. The E-box mutant plasmid was used with the mutant GC oligonucleotides to create the double mutant. The nonmutated parental plasmid DNAs were then digested with DpnI, and new mutant plasmid DNA transformed into XL-1 Blue supercompetent cells. All of the constructs used for transfection were CsCl purified and sequenced to confirm structure and sequence. PC12 cells were transfected with 3 μg of each α7 promoter-luciferase construct DNA and 0.5 μg of pSV-β-galactosidase vector DNA (Promega; internal control for transfection efficiency) using LipofectAMINE (Life Technologies, Inc.). A rat α3 promoter luciferase construct (30Boyd R.T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 960-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was also transfected into PC12 cells, and the activities of the α7 constructs were compared with the activity of the α3 promoter. The α3 luciferase activity was thus set at 100%. All transfections were done in duplicate dishes with several experiments for each group of hybrid constructs. 2 days after transfection, extracts were harvested and luciferase activity measured using the Promega luciferase assay reagent. β-Galactosidase assays were performed using the Galacto-Light Plus (Tropix) assay kit. Luciferase activities were normalized to the β-galactosidase activities present in the extracts. The α7 promoter plasmids were also transfected into L6 cells (rat muscle myoblasts) using the same technique as for PC12 cells. Rat pheochromocytoma cells (PC12) and L6 myoblasts were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated horse serum and 5% fetal calf serum (all from Life Technologies, Inc.). The medium also included 100 units/ml penicillin/streptomycin (Life Technologies, Inc.). Cells were maintained in a humidified incubator at 37 °C with a 5% C02 and 95% air atmosphere. The PC12 cells were a subclone designated N21 and were a gift from Dr. Richard Burry, Department of Neuroscience, The Ohio State University College of Medicine. The L6 myoblasts were a gift from Dr. Tony Young, Ohio State University Biotechnology Center, The Ohio State University. Drosophila melanogaster Schneider cells (SL2 cells) were a gift from Dr. Mark Seeger, Ohio State University Neurobiotechnology Center. The SL2 cells were maintained in Schneider medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (both from Life Technologies, Inc.) at 25 °C. The expression plasmids pPACSP1 and pPACuSP3 (kindly provided by Dr. Guntram Suske, Klinikum Der Philipps-Universitat At Marburg) were transfected into SL2 cells as follows. 1 day prior to transfection, the cells were plated onto 60-mm tissue culture dishes at a density of 4 × 106 cells/plate. Cells were transfected with 4 μg of plasmid DNA using LipofectAMINE in Schneider medium without serum. 12 h after the addition of DNA, the cells were placed in Schneider medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum at 25 °C. 24 h later the cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline, and nuclear extracts were isolated (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline, pelleted, and resuspended in 400 μl of cold buffer containing 10 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mm KCI, and 0. 1 mm EDTA, 0.1 mmEGTA, 1 mm DTT and 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. Cells were lysed by adding 25 μl of 10% Nonidet P-40, and the crude nuclei were pelleted. The nuclei were resuspended in 100 μl of buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 0.4m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, 1 mm DTT, and 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The tube was rocked vigorously at 4 °C for 15 min. The nuclear extracts were obtained by centrifugation and stored at −70 °C. PC12 nuclear extracts were prepared as described above (31Schreiber E. Matthias P. Muller M.M. Schaffner W. Nucleic Acids Res. 1989; 17: 6419Crossref PubMed Scopus (3917) Google Scholar). The protein concentrations of the nuclear extracts were determined using the Bio-Rad protein assay reagent. Double stranded oligonucleotides were end labeled with [32P]ATP using T4 kinase (U. S. Biochemical Corp.). For binding reactions 20,000–25,000 cpm of 32P end-labeled oligonucleotide was incubated with 5–10 μg of PC12 or SL2 nuclear extract in a 10-μl volume containing 10 mm Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 0.5 mm DTT, 0.5 mm EDTA, 1 mmMgCI2, 4% glycerol, and 0.5 μg of poly(dI-dC)·poly(dI-dC). For some experiments, the incubation buffer contained 10 mm Tris-HCI (pH 7.5), 50 mm NaCl, 1 mm DTT, 1 mm EDTA, 10% glycerol, 5 μg of bovine serum albumin, and 2 μg of poly(dA-dT)·poly(dA-dT). After incubation at 4 °C for 30 min, the complexes were separated on 4% polyacrylamide gels (80:1, acrylamide:bisacrylamide) at room temperature in 0.5 × Tris borate buffer. For some of the Sp1 and Sp3 antibody supershifting experiments a buffer containing 20 mm HEPES (pH 7.9), 100 mm KCl, 2 mmDTT, 1 mm EDTA, 20% glycerol, 0.01% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5 μg/μl bovine serum albumin was used. For competition, unlabeled oligonucleotides were added at 100-fold molar excess to each reaction for 10 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. The gels were dried onto a Whatman 3MM paper, and were exposed to x-ray (Kodak XAR-5) film at −70 °C with an intensifying screen. Gel supershift assays were performed in the same way except that before incubation of the probes with nuclear extracts, 2.0 μl of TransCruzTM gel supershift antibody (100 μg/ml) was added to the reaction mixture and incubated for 1 h on ice. The Sp1, USF1, and USF2 supershifting antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). Some of the EMSA using an anti-Egr-1 antibody were performed using the Nushift Kit (Geneka) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly the nuclear extract was incubated with the binding buffer and stabilizing solution on ice for 20 min. The rabbit Egr-1 polyclonal antibody was included in supershifting reactions. Radioactively end-labeled probe was added and incubated further for another 20 min on ice. The reactions were loaded onto a 5% acrylamide:bisacrylamide gel (19:1) and electrophoresed in TGE buffer at 15 V/cm at 4 °C. The gels were exposed to x-ray film (Hyperfilm MP- Amersham) for 16–24 h. The USF consensus (5′-CACCCGGTCACGTGGCCTACACC-3′) and Egr consensus (5′-GGATCCAGCGGGGGCGAGCGGGGGCGA-3′) oligonucleotides were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc (Santa Cruz, CA). The Sp1 consensus (5′-ATTCGATCGGGGCGGGGCGAGC3-′) oligonucleotide was purchased fromPromega (Madison, WI). Double stranded oligonucleotides (sense strand shown) A (5′-AGTTCCCGGGGCGGCCACGG-3′), B (5′-CTGTCACGTGTGGGGGCGCG-3′), C (5′-CTGTCACGTGTGGGGGCGCGCCGCGGC-3′), C-m (5′-CTGTCACGTGTGAAAGCGCGCCGCGGC-3′), and D (5′-TGTGGGGGCGCGCCGCGGCTGC-3′) were synthesized by Operon. A rat genomic library (CLONTECH) was screened using a full-length rat α7 cDNA (15Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Six genomic clones were initially isolated. Two clones, λ7 1-1 and λ7 7-1, contained a 2.3-kb KpnI fragment that hybridized with the 5′-end of the rat α7 cDNA and oligonucleotide probes from the same region. The 2.3-kb KpnI fragment from clone λ7 1-1 was completely sequenced using a combination of the chain termination method (29Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52674) Google Scholar) and automated sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Inc. 373A). Parts of λ7 7-1 were also sequenced in the same way and had the same sequence as the corresponding region of λ7 1-1. Comparison of the 2.3-kbKpnI sequence with the sequence of an α7 cDNA previously cloned from hippocampus (15Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) indicated that this fragment contained exons 1 and 2 of the rat gene and the short intervening intron as well as 1.3 kb of sequence upstream from the translational start site (Fig. 1). The sequence of the exons 1 and 2 matched the first 196 nucleotides of the rat α7 cDNA sequence (15Seguela P. Wadiche J. Dineley-Miller K. Dani J.A. Patrick J.W. J. Neurosci. 1993; 13: 596-604Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The 2.3-kb KpnI fragment also contained 600 bp of the intron between exons 2 and 3. The sequence was analyzed for consensus transcription factor binding sites using GeneWorks and MatInspector version 2.1 (32Quandt K. Frech K. Karas H. Wingender E. Werner T. Nucleic Acids Res. 1995; 23: 4878-4884Crossref PubMed Scopus (2424) Google Scholar). Consensus binding sites for Sp1, E-box (CANCTG), Ets-1, GATA factors, as well as several partial matches to the Egr-1 consensus binding site were present upstream from the first exon. The Sp1, E-box, and potential Egr-1 consensus binding sites are underlined (Fig. 1 A). No consensus TATA- or CCAAT-boxes were observed. The region upstream from the first exon had a high GC content. Although the whole 2.3-kbKpnI fragment had a GC content of 54%, the region 300 bp upstream from the ATG was 68% GC, 200 bp upstream was 78% GC, and 100 bp upstream was 82% GC. The rat α7 gene was similar to the bovine (33Criado M. Dominguez del Toro E. Carrasco-Serrano C. Smillie F.I. Juiz J.M. Viniegra S. Ballesta J.J. J. Neurosci. 1997; 17: 6554-6564Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), human (34Gault J. Robinson M. Berger R. Drebing C. Logel J. Hopkins J. Moore T. Jacobs S. Meriwether J. Choi M.J. Kim E.J. Walton K. Buiting K. Davis A. Breese C. Freedman R. Leonard S. Genomics. 1998; 52: 173-185Crossref PubMed Scopus (211) Google Scholar), and chick (35Matter-Sadzinski L. Hernandez M.-C. Roztocil T. Ballivet M. Matter J.-M. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4529-4538Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar) α7 genes in that all had a high GC content in the upstream region and lack CCAAT- or TATA-boxes. The GC content of the 400 nucleotides upstream from the rat α7 translational start site is 63%. This was less than that of the human (77%), bovine (74%), and chick (83%) genes over the same region but consistent with a promoter without CCAAT- or TATA-boxes. DNA fragments upstream from and including the ATG translational start were used as probes for ribonuclease protection assays to locate the 5′-end of α7 transcripts expressed in PC12 cells. A 139-bpSstII-SstII* fragment from within the 2.3-kbKpnI piece which contained most of the first exon was used in a ribonuclease protection assay with PC12 cell RNA (Fig.1 B). Two protected bands were observed. One was consistent with a fully protected probe, and the other was ∼20 bp shorter (Fig.2 A). A 178-bpBstYI-SstII fragment from within the 2.3-kbKpnI piece and located just upstream from the 139-bp piece was also used in a ribonuclease protection assay. One small protected fragment (10 bp) was observed (Fig. 2 B). This is consistent with a minor start site ∼10 bp upstream from the 139-bpSstIl-SstIl* fragment. The ribonuclease protection assay results were consistent with two start sites ∼30 nucleotides apart (Fig. 1 A). Primer extension and 5′-rapid amplification of cDNA ends also were used to map the transcriptional start site but produced inconsistent results, most likely because of the high GC content of the promoter region. To identify a region upstream from the α7 gene with promoter activity, we began our search within the 2.3-kbKpnI fragment from λ7 1-1. The 1-kbKpnI-BstYI fragment, the 178-bpBstYI-SstII fragment, and the 1.2-kbKpnI-SstII fragment upstream from the first exon were each cloned into the vector pGL2-Basic upstream from a luciferase reporter gene. Additional luciferase expression constructs containing a 319-bp BstYI-SstII* fragment and a 60-bp 5′-deletion of the 319-bp BstYI-SstII* fragment which contained most of the first exon were also made (Fig.3). All of these plasmids were transfected into PC12 cells. A rat α3 promoter-luciferase construct (30Boyd R.T. J. Neurobiol. 1994; 25: 960-973Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) was also transfected into PC12 cells in tandem, and the activities of the α7 constructs were compared with the activity of the α3 promoter. The luciferase activity produced by the α3 promoter was set at 100%. All of the fragments that contained the 178-bpBstYI-SstII region had significant promoter activity in PC12 cells (Fig. 3). The 1 kbKpnI-BstYI fragment directly upstream from this region did not have any activity. The addition of the downstream 139-bpSstII-SstII* fragment to the 178-bpBstYI-SstII fragment resulted in a 38% increase in luciferase expression. A 60-bp 5′-deletion of this fragment which removed consensus GATA and Ets-1 transcription factor binding sites did not affect the promoter activity of this fragment. The smallest piece with promoter activity was the 178-bpBstYI-SstII fragment (Fig. 3). This construct was transfected into L6 cells and was not expressed, although another plasmid with the luciferase gene under SV40 promoter control (pGL2 Control, Promega) produced high levels of luciferase activity after transfection into L6 cells. 2U. Nagavarapu and R. T. Boyd, unpublished observations. The lack of α7 promoter expression in L6 cells is consistent with our Northern blot analysis, which did not detect any α7 mRNA transcript in L6 cells. The lack of α7 promoter activity also indicates that the 178-bp minimal promoter contains elements that provide for cell-specific expression. To analyze of the role of specific sequences in the activity of the α7 promoter, point mutations were made in two potential transcription factor binding sites. Mutations were made in the GC-box and the E-box (CACGTG) present in the α7 promoter contained in the 178-bp BstYI-SstII fragment (Fig. 1). A double mutant for both the GC-box and E-box sequences was also made. These constructs were transfected into PC12 cells, and the activities of the promoters were compared with that of the wild-type α7 promoter (Fig. 3 B). Mutation of the E-box (CACGTG) sequence produced a decrease in activity to 61% of the wild-type α7 promoter level, whereas the GC mutation led to a greater than 2-fold increase in promoter activity. The double mutant displayed an activity similar to that of the E-box (CACGTG) mutant, a 40% decrease in promoter activity. We then determined the relative amounts of α3 and α7 RNAs present in PC12 cells to compare the relative amounts of α7 and α3 RNAs with the nAChR promoter activities detected in transient transfections. To estimate the numbers of α3 and α7 transcripts in PC12 cells, Northern blot analysis was performed with RNA purified from PC12 cells grown under control conditions (Fig.4). The blot was probed with32P-labeled α3 and α7 cDNAs, and the amount of radioactivity associated with each species was measured with a PhosphorImager. PC12 cells expressed 5 times more of the α3 3.9-kb RNA and 2 times more of the α3 2.4-kb RNA than of the 6-kb α7 RNA. The activity of our α7 promoter was about 85% that of the rat α3 promoter. The higher levels of α3 RNA are consistent with the higher promoter activity of the α3 promoter in PC12 cells. However, given that the α3 RNA levels were several times higher than the α7 RNA levels, the higher amount of α3 RNA (or lower amount of α7 RNA) is most likely determined by other post-transcriptional steps. To begin our characterization of transcription factors binding to the α7 promoter, we used EMSA to determine where PC12 nuclear extract proteins bound to the minimal α7 promoter. Because mutation of the upstream GC-rich sequence led to increased promoter activity, we first used an oligonucleotide containing this sequence from the promoter for EMSA using PC12 extracts. An oligonucleotide (A) containing the GC-rich sequence (Fig.5 A) was shown to produce three retarded complexes (Fig. 5 B) when combined with PC12 nuclear extract. The upper and lower species were competed by excess unlabeled oligonucleotide A and were determined to be specific. The middle band was poorly competed and thought to be nonspecific. Because this GC-rich sequence contains a potential Sp1 binding site, human recombinant Sp1 (Promega) was used for EMSA with oligonucleotide A. Recombinant Sp1 did not retard the mobility of the oligonucleotide A (Fig. 5 B,lane 3); however, recombinant Sp1 bound to an oligonucleotide containing a consensus Sp1 binding site that was used as a positive control (Fig. 5 B, lane 9). Antibody supershifting of oligonucleotide A and PC12 nuclear extract with an antibody against Sp1 (Santa Cruz) had no effect. The oligonucleotide containing a consensus Sp1 binding site (Promega) produced three retarded complexes with PC12 extract in addition to binding recombinant Sp1 (Fig. 5 B). Antibody supershifting with anti-Sp1 antibodies produced additional retardation of the slowest moving complex produced with the PC12 extract and the Sp1"

Rad53-like kinases, including the human tumor suppressor protein Chk2, play crucial roles in cell cycle arrest and activation of repair processes following DNA damage and replication blocks. Here we show that ectopic expression of the N-terminal FHA domain (FHA1) of the yeast Rad53 kinase causes a growth defect by arresting the cell cycle in G1. This phenotype was highly specific for the Rad53-FHA1 domain and not observed with the similar Rad53-FHA2, Dun1-FHA, and Chk2-FHA domains, and it was abrogated by mutations that abolished binding to a phosphothreonine-containing peptide in vitro. Furthermore, replacement of the RAD53 gene with alleles containing amino acid substitutions in the FHA1 domain resulted in an increased DNA damage sensitivity in vivo. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the FHA1 domain contributes to the checkpoint function of Rad53, possibly by associating with a phosphorylated target protein in response to DNA damage in G1.

Taken together, these data demonstrate that the FHA1 domain contributes to the checkpoint function of Rad53, possibly by associating with a phosphorylated target protein in response to DNA damage in G1. Checkpoint signaling pathways are crucial for maintaining genome integrity by delaying the cell cycle in response to DNA damage, replicational stress or mitotic spindle assembly defects, and are highly conserved throughout evolution (1Elledge S.J.

Chk2-like cell cycle checkpoint protein kinases are characterized by the presence of noncatalytic FHA1 domains and play crucial roles in the cellular response to DNA damage and replication blocks (3Matsuoka S.

Mutations within the Chk2-FHA domain or truncations that disrupt the kinase domain but leave the FHA domain intact are the cause of a subset of cases of the Li-Fraumeni syndrome (usually caused by loss of p53) where patients suffer from multiple independent primary tumors, typically at a young age (10Bell D.W.

Hollingsworth N.M. J. Biol. Chem... 1999; 274: 1783-1790Google Scholar). In contrast to other family members that contain a single FHA domain in the N terminus, Rad53 is the only checkpoint kinase with an additional FHA domain in the C terminus. RAD53 arrests the cell cycle in G1 and G2/M in response to DNA damage and in S phase in response to replication blocks (12Allen J.B. Zhou Z. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev... 1994; 8: 2401-2415Google Scholar, 15Gardner R. Putnam C.W. Weinert T. EMBO J... 1999; 18: 3173-3185Google Scholar). In addition, it regulates the transcriptional induction as well as the subcellular localization and activity of proteins involved in DNA damage repair (12Allen J.B. Zhou Z. Siede W. Friedberg E.C. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev... 1994; 8: 2401-2415Google Scholar, 16Mills K.D. Sinclair D.A. Guarente L. Cell.. 1999; 97: 609-620Google Scholar, 17Bashkirov V.I. King J.S. Bashkirova E.V. Schmuckli-Maurer J. Heyer W.D. Mol. Cell. Biol... 2000; 20: 4393-4404Google Scholar). RAD53 also has an essential, DNA damage-independent function by regulating the levels and activity of ribonucleotide reductase, and thereby the availability of dNTPs, during S phase (18Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 2: 329-340Google Scholar, 19Desany B.A. Alcasabas A.A. Bachant J.B. Elledge S.J. Genes Dev... 1998; 12: 2956-2970Google Scholar). Several RAD53-dependent checkpoint pathways, but few definitive kinase substrates, have been identified. Following DNA damage in G1, Rad53 phosphorylates the Swi6 transcription factor, thereby contributing to the repression of the CLN1 and CLN2 cyclin genes and delaying transition into S phase (20Sidorova J.M. Breeden L.L. Genes Dev... 1997; 11: 3032-3045Google Scholar). In response to replication blocks and DNA damage in S phase, Rad53 inhibits the “firing” of late replication origins (21Santocanale C. Diffley J.F. Nature.. 1998; 395: 615-618Google Scholar) by negatively regulating the Dbf4/Cdc7 kinase complex (22Dohrmann P.R. Oshiro G. Tecklenburg M. Sclafani R.A. Genetics.. 1999; 151: 965-977Google Scholar, 23Kihara M. Nakai W. Asano S. Suzuki A. Kitada K. Kawasaki Y. Johnston L.H. Sugino A. J. Biol.

As part of the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint, Rad53 prevents anaphase entry and mitotic exit by inhibition of the polo-like kinase Cdc5 (25Sanchez Y. Bachant J. Wang H. Hu F. Liu D. Tetzlaff M. Elledge S.J. Science.. 1999; 286: 1166-1171Google Scholar). FHA domains are highly diverse protein-protein interaction modules characterized by a 55–75-residue motif with only 7 residues that are >65% conserved among 120 family members (26Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1995; 20: 347-349Google Scholar). However, intact FHA domains are much larger than the core motif detected in computer comparisons and contain up to 180 amino acid residues (27Liao H. Byeon I.J. Tsai M.D. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 294: 1041-1049Google Scholar, 28Hammet A. Pike B.L. Mitchelhill K.I. Teh T. Kobe B. House C.M. Kemp B.E. Heierhorst J. FEBS Lett... 2000; 471: 141-146Google Scholar). FHA domains form an 11-stranded β-sandwich that is similar to the fold of the C-terminal domain of the smad tumor suppressor/transcription factor family (27Liao H. Byeon I.J. Tsai M.D. J. Mol. Biol... 1999; 294: 1041-1049Google Scholar). In addition to checkpoint kinases, FHA domains are also found in several other signaling molecules including Forkhead-like transcription factors, from which their name originated. Recent reports indicate that FHA domains bind directly to threonine-phosphorylated residues in target proteins (29Durocher D. Henckel J. Ferscht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 387-394Google Scholar). In the case of Rad53, it has been demonstrated that association of the C-terminal FHA2 domain with phosphorylated Rad9 is essential for Rad53 activation and G2/M arrest following DNA damage (30Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science.. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar). Interestingly, the Rad53-FHA2 domain can also bind directly to phosphotyrosine-containing peptides in vitro, indicating that FHA domains may be bifunctional phosphothreonine/phosphotyrosine-binding domains (31Wang P. Byeon I.J. Liao H. Beebe K.D. Yongkiettrakul S. Pei D. Tsai M.D. J. Mol. Biol... 2000; 302: 927-940Google Scholar).In vitro, the N-terminal FHA1 domain of Rad53 also binds to phosphorylated Rad9 as well as to phosphothreonine-containing synthetic peptides (29Durocher D. Henckel J. Ferscht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 387-394Google Scholar), but its physiological function is presently unclear. We have recently determined the Rad53 and Dun1 FHA domain boundaries and demonstrated that overexpression of the Dun1-FHA domain in yeast can compete the Dun1-dependent transcriptional induction of ribonucleotide reductase 2 (RNR2) following replication blocks (28Hammet A. Pike B.L. Mitchelhill K.I. Teh T. Kobe B. House C.M. Kemp B.E. Heierhorst J. FEBS Lett... 2000; 471: 141-146Google Scholar). To gain insight into the function of the Rad53-FHA1 domain, we have used a similar approach in the present study. We show that overexpression of the FHA1 domain can mimic the DNA damage-dependent G1 arrest function of the intact Rad53 kinase, and that this phenotype is abrogated by mutation of residues that are involved in phosphopeptide binding. Moreover, we show that introduction of amino acid changes, that disrupt this overexpression phenotype, into the RAD53 gene results in an increased sensitivity of yeast to DNA damage. These data indicate that FHA1 domain association with a threonine-phosphorylated target protein may be involved in the G1 checkpoint function of Rad53. FHA domain constructs were generated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using synthetic oligonucleotides (all oligonucleotide sequences are available as on-line supplemental materials) as described (28Hammet A. Pike B.L. Mitchelhill K.I. Teh T. Kobe B. House C.M. Kemp B.E. Heierhorst J. FEBS Lett... 2000; 471: 141-146Google Scholar). For bacterial expression, cDNAs were cloned into the NcoI andBglII sites of pQE60 (Qiagen). For yeast expression, constructs were ligated to the Gal4 DNA binding domain for nuclear targeting by cloning into the constitutive expression vector pAS2 (CLONTECH), followed by ligation of the resultingHindIII-SalI restriction fragments into the inducible vector p416GAL1 (32Mumberg D. Müller R. Funk M. Nucleic Acids Res... 1994; 22: 5767-5768Google Scholar). Sequences of all PCR generated fragments were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis (ABI). Site-directed FHA1 mutants were generated by PCR using synthetic oligonucleotides (see supplemental materials available in on-line version of this article) and mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. Random mutagenesis of the Rad53-FHA1 was performed by low fidelity PCR essentially as described (33Wang H. Elledge S.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A... 1999; 96: 3824-3829Google Scholar), except that 20 μmmanganese chloride was found to give the highest yield of viable yeast colonies with only single amino acid substitutions. The resulting library in pAS2 consisted of ∼1950 independent clones. Unless otherwise indicated, experiments were performed in the K699 genetic background (MATa, ade2–1, trp1–1, leu2–3,112, his3–11,15, ura3,can1–100). rad9Δ and rad17Δstrains (34Winzeler E.A.

Giaever G. Hegemann J.H. Jones T. Laub M. Liao H. et al.Science.. 1999; 285: 901-906Google Scholar) were in the BY4741 background (MATa, leu2Δ0, his3Δ1, met15Δ0, ura3Δ0) and obtained from Research Genetics. The sml1Δ andrad53Δsml1–1 strains were in the W303–1A genetic background (MATa, ade2–1, can1–100, his3–11,15, leu2–3, trp1–1, ura3–1) (18Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 2: 329-340Google Scholar). A K699dun1Δ strain was generated using a PCR fragment containing 50 base pairs of the DUN1 gene flanking the LEU2selectable marker, and the deletion was confirmed by PCR and immunoblotting. 2A. Hammet and J. Heierhorst, unpublished data. Some experiments were performed in K699 strains containing galactose-inducible cyclin genes (LEU2::GAL1-CLN1and LEU2::GAL1-CLN2 (35Tyers M. Tokiwa G. Futcher B. EMBO J... 1993; 12: 68-1955Google Scholar)) or vectors for Ptc2 overexpression (36Welihinda A.A. Tirasophon W. Green S.R. Kaufman R.J. Mol. Cell. Biol... 1998; 18: 1967-1977Google Scholar), respectively. Start cultures for galactose-inducible experiments were grown in selective medium containing 2% sucrose. For induction of protein expression, cultures were grown in selective medium containing 2% sucrose and 4% galactose. For growth rate studies, aliquots were removed from exponentially growing cultures and optical densities were measured at 600 nm. Cell viability at the same time points was assayed by plating aliquots on 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 2% (w/v) peptone, 2% (w/v) glucose (YPD) medium and counting colonies after 3 days of incubation at 30 °C. In synchronization experiments, cells were diluted to 0.2 optical density units and treated twice for 2 h with 20 μg/ml α-factor. Cells were released from α-factor arrest by three washes in selective medium containing 2% sucrose and 4% galactose and resuspended in fresh medium. For cell cycle analyses, 1-ml aliquots were removed from yeast cultures and fixed in 70% ethanol. 200 μl of cells were washed with 50 mm sodium citrate, pH 7, and incubated overnight with 0.1 mg/ml RNase A in 50 mm sodium citrate at 37 °C. Cells were sonicated, treated with 4 μg/ml propidium iodide, and analyzed using a Becton Dickinson FACScan and CellQuest software. RAD53 gene disruptions and allele replacements were generated in the sml1Δ strain that is viable without Rad53. RAD53 was disrupted using a PCR product containing the URA3 selectable marker flanked by a 45-base pair RAD53 genomic sequence (see supplemental information on-line). RAD53 allele replacements (R70A, N107K, and K227A) were performed using a PCR-based strategy similar to the one described by Erdeniz et al. (37Erdeniz N. Mortensen U.H. Rothstein R. Genome Res... 1997; 7: 1174-1183Google Scholar), except that theS. cerevisiae rather than the Kluyveromyces lactis URA3 gene was used as the tagged selectable marker and that fusion fragments corresponded only to the targeted domains rather than the entire coding sequence. Strains containing mutated rad53alleles were identified by colony PCR, using primers outside the PCR-generated targeting sequences, followed by hybridization with discriminatory oligonucleotides. The correct mutations and absence of secondary mutations were confirmed by automated DNA sequence analysis. For survival assays, aliquots were removed from log phase cultures immediately before and 3 h after addition of MMS, and spread onto YPD plates. Recombinant proteins were expressed and purified as described (28Hammet A. Pike B.L. Mitchelhill K.I. Teh T. Kobe B. House C.M. Kemp B.E. Heierhorst J. FEBS Lett... 2000; 471: 141-146Google Scholar), dialyzed against 20 mm Hepes, pH 7, 1 mm dithiothreitol, concentrated to 5 mg/ml using Centricon membranes (Amicon), and stored at 4 °C until use. For enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), microtiter plates were coated overnight with 20 μg/ml synthetic p53-derived phosphothreonine-containing peptide (p53(pT18): APPLSQEpTFSDLWKL) diluted in 0.2 msodium carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. Plates were blocked in 5% BSA in PBS, 0.1% Tween 20, incubated with purified FHA domains in 1% BSA in PBS, probed with 0.2 μg/ml anti-His4 antibody (Qiagen), followed by secondary antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. 200 μl of 10 mm2,2′-azino-bis[3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulfonic acid], 0.3% H2O2 in 5.35 mm trisodium citrate, 3.8 mm citric acid, pH 4.5, was used for color development, measured at 405 nm. Data from four experiments using three different protein preparations were normalized to the fitted maximum of binding by the wild-type FHA1 domain. Protein extracts were prepared by resuspending yeast pellets from 10 ml cultures in 200 μl of buffer (8 m urea, 5% SDS, 40 mmTris-HCl, pH 6.8, 0.1 mm EDTA, 0.4 mg/ml bromphenol blue, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, 10 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, 2 mm PMSF, 10 mm benzamidine, 1 mm sodium vanadate, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 1% β-mercaptoethanol) and vigorous vortexing in the presence of 100 μl of glass beads. Proteins were transferred onto Polyscreen polyvinyl difluoride membranes (PerkinElmer Life Sciences), and probed with 0.8 μg/ml polyclonal anti-Rad53 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 0.1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-Gal4 DNA binding domain antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), 0.1 μg/ml monoclonal anti-actin antibody (Roche), or 0.2 μg/ml anti-His4 monoclonal antibody (Qiagen), using secondary antibodies conjugated with horseradish peroxidase and ECL™ reagents (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for detection. We used a galactose-inducible overexpression system to identify phenotypes that might provide clues to the function of the N-terminal FHA domain (FHA1) of the yeast Rad53 kinase. Transformed yeast strains had normal growth properties when the expression of these constructs (fused to the Gal4-DNA binding domain for nuclear targeting) was repressed in media lacking galactose (Fig.1 A). However, strains overexpressing the entire Rad53 N terminus (residues 1–199 including the FHA1 domain) or expressing a construct containing only the biochemically defined FHA1 domain (residues 20–164) had a dramatic growth defect and failed to form visible colonies on solid media containing galactose (Fig. 1 A). This growth defect was highly specific for the Rad53-FHA1 domain as it was not observed with the related Rad53-FHA2, Dun1-FHA, and Chk2-FHA domains (Fig.1 A) that were expressed at similar protein levels (Fig.1 B). In addition, this phenotype was dependent on the integrity of the FHA1 domain as it was abrogated by double-alanine substitution of the highly conserved residues Ser-85 and His-88, as well as truncation of just 15 residues at either end of the proteolytically defined domain boundaries (Fig. 1 A). Although overexpression of the C-terminal Rad53-FHA2 domain did not affect normal cell growth, it caused a considerably increased DNA damage sensitivity and decreased viability on plates containing galactose and the radiomimetic compound MMS (Fig. 1 A,right panel). This phenotype is consistent with genetic evidence that the Rad53-FHA2 domain is involved in the DNA damage-dependent activation of Rad53 (30Sun Z. Hsiao J. Fay D.S. Stern D.F. Science.. 1998; 281: 272-274Google Scholar). Likewise, the Dun1-FHA domain construct used here can suppress the Dun1-dependent transcriptional induction of RNR2following replication blocks (28Hammet A. Pike B.L. Mitchelhill K.I. Teh T. Kobe B. House C.M. Kemp B.E. Heierhorst J. FEBS Lett... 2000; 471: 141-146Google Scholar) and can also compete the activation of Dun1 kinase by replication blocks or DNA damage.2Therefore, the Rad53-FHA2 and Dun1-FHA domains are fully functional in this system, and the fact that only the FHA1 domain causes a growth defect underscores the specificity of this phenotype. RAD53has an essential DNA damage-independent function by regulating the availability of dNTPs during S phase, that can be suppressed by deletion of the RNR inhibitor SML1(18Zhao X. Muller E.G. Rothstein R. Mol. Cell.. 1998; 2: 329-340Google Scholar). To test if the FHA1 domain causes the growth defect by competing with the RAD53 essential function, we analyzed its effect on the growth of a sml1Δ strain (Fig.2). In this experiment, expression of the FHA1 domain again inhibited colony formation in the sml1Δstrain to the same extent as in the wild-type strain. Similar results were also obtained in a rad53Δ strain (viable because of asml1–1 mutation; Fig. 2). This indicates that the FHA1 overexpression phenotype is unrelated to the essential function ofRAD53. Another possible reason for the growth defect could be that FHA1 overexpression generates a checkpoint signal that results in cell cycle arrest. The FHA1 domain can bind to phosphorylated Rad9 in vitro (29Durocher D. Henckel J. Ferscht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 387-394Google Scholar). To test if the growth defect is the result of an interaction of the FHA1 domain with Rad9, overexpression experiments were repeated in a rad9 deletion strain. Fig. 2 Ashows that overexpression of the Rad53-FHA1 domain, but not the vector and double-mutant controls, again caused a dramatic growth defect in the rad9Δ strain; the FHA1 phenotype must therefore be independent of its proposed interaction with Rad9. Similar results were also obtained in a strain lacking RAD17 (Fig.2 A), a component of an alternative DNA damage-sensor pathway for Rad53 activation (38Weinert T. Cell.. 1998; 94: 555-558Google Scholar), and in a strain lacking DUN1(Fig. 2 B), a Rad53 effector at the transducer level. The maintenance of the FHA1 overexpression phenotype in rad9Δ,rad17Δ, rad53Δ, and dun1Δstrains indicates that the growth defect does not result from an FHA1-generated checkpoint signal at the sensor/transducer level,e.g. by displacing Rad53 from inhibitory complexes. This genetic evidence was confirmed by immunoblot analysis of the Rad53 activation state. Rad53 is activated by phosphorylation resulting in slower migrating bands in SDS-polyacrylamide gels (39Sanchez Y. Desany B.A. Jones W.J. Liu Q. Wang B. Elledge S.J. Science.. 1996; 271: 357-360Google Scholar). Fig.2 C shows that expression of the FHA1 domain did not result in shifted (i.e. activated) Rad53 under basal conditions, nor did it inhibit Rad53 activation by MMS-induced DNA damage or hydroxyurea-induced replication blocks. To assess the FHA1 phenotype in more detail, overexpression effects were examined in liquid cultures. Fig.3 A shows that FHA1-overexpressing cultures had considerably slower growth kinetics than the vector control, which became apparent after ∼8 h in galactose-containing media. To determine whether overexpression of the FHA1 domain affects cell viability, aliquots of these cultures were plated on dextrose-containing plates and tested for their ability to form colonies. Colony formation by the FHA1-overexpressing strain was directly proportional to its optical density throughout the 24-h experiment, and colony numbers per optical density unit were very similar for the FHA1 and control cultures (Fig. 3 A,inset). This demonstrates that the FHA1-dependent growth defect is reversible and not the result of increased lethality. To examine if the FHA1 domain reduces cell growth in a specific phase of the cell cycle, aliquots of liquid cultures were analyzed by flow cytometry. Starting cultures were adjusted to give equal cell densities (∼0.5 optical density units) at the end of this experiment to minimize nonspecific effects on the cell cycle profile. In this experiment, the majority of vector control cells had a 2n DNA content (corresponding to G2/M) before, and 6 and 12 h after addition of galactose (Fig. 3 B). The cell cycle profile of the FHA1 strain without, and 6 h after addition of galactose (i.e. at time points when the growth defect was not apparent) was essentially identical to the vector control. However, induction of FHA1 expression for 12 h resulted in a marked increase in cells with a 1n DNA content (Fig. 3 B). To determine whether this accumulation of cells in G1 was the result of a cell cycle arrest or just a slower G1-S transition, FHA1-overexpressing and vector control cultures were synchronized in G1 using α-factor and then released into fresh galactose-containing medium. Fig. 3 C shows that the majority of the control culture had shifted to G2/M within 75 min after α-factor release. In contrast, the majority of FHA1-overexpressing cells were still in G1 150 min after release from the pheromone (Fig. 3 C). α-Factor arrest kinetics (before the release) were similar for the FHA1 and control culture (data not shown), indicating that other phases of the cell cycle were largely unaffected. Therefore, cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase is the major reason for the inability of the FHA1-overexpressing strain to form visible colonies on solid medium. Only seven residues are highly conserved among FHA domains (26Hofmann K. Bucher P. Trends Biochem. Sci... 1995; 20: 347-349Google Scholar). To find out if these highly conserved residues are important for FHA1 domain function, we performed an alanine-screening mutational analysis in a constitutive expression system. Thetop panel in Fig.4 A shows that the FHA1 phenotype could be reproduced in this system; expression of the wild-type FHA1 domain again prevented colony formation, whereas equal amounts of yeast transformed with equal amounts of vector or double-mutant (S85A/H88A) control DNAs gave rise to numerous colonies. Fig. 4 A shows that single alanine substitutions of each of the >80% consensus residues (Gly-69, Arg-70, Ser-85, His-88) as well as Asn-107 and Gly-108, that are conserved in >65% of all FHA domains, abrogated the overexpression phenotype and resulted in numerous viable colonies. In contrast, alanine substitution of the >65% conserved residue Asn-112 did not affect the phenotype, indicating that this residue is functionally neutral in the context of the FHA1 domain. Immunoblot analyses of viable colonies demonstrated that three of the alanine substitutions (G69A, H88A, G108A) resulted in considerably reduced FHA1 protein levels, indicating that these residues may be important for proper domain folding (Fig.4 B). In contrast, FHA1 domains with substitutions of Arg-70, Ser-85, or Asn-107 were still expressed at high levels (Fig.4 B) that were similar to the galactose-inducible wild-type FHA1 preventing cell growth (Fig. 4 C). The abrogation of the growth defect therefore indicates that these residues may be directly involved in the binding to a target protein that is crucial for the G1 arrest phenotype. To test these hypotheses, His6-tagged recombinant FHA1 domains were expressed in E. coli. Immunoblots of fractionated bacterial lysates (Fig.5 A) revealed that the solubility of these recombinant proteins mimicked their expression levels in vivo. Mutants that were expressed at low levels in yeast (G69A, H88A, G108A) were almost exclusively insoluble in vitro, supporting the notion that these domains are misfolded. In contrast, the wild-type FHA1 domain and the mutants with high expression levels in vivo (R70A, S85A, N107A) were predominantly soluble in vitro. Although the N112A mutant had an unperturbed phenotype in vivo, indicating that it is properly folded in yeast, a large fraction was insoluble when expressed in bacteria. However, the relative solubility of this domain was much greater than that of the G69A, H88A, and G108A mutants, and once purified its solubility did not differ from the recombinant wild-type FHA1 domain (data not shown). Soluble FHA1 domains, as well as the Dun1-FHA domain, were purified (Fig. 5 B) and tested in an ELISA for their ability to bind to a phosphothreonine-containing peptide, that has previously been shown to interact with an extended Rad53-FHA1 domain-containing GST fusion protein (residues 2–279) (29Durocher D. Henckel J. Ferscht A.R. Jackson S.P. Mol. Cell.. 1999; 4: 387-394Google Scholar). In this assay (Fig.5 C), the wild-type FHA1 domain bound to the phosphopeptide with high affinity (half-maximal binding at 6 μg/ml, ∼350 nm). Although the dose-response curve of the N112A mutant, that had an unperturbed phenotype in vivo, was shifted to about 1 order of magnitude higher concentrations (EC50 ∼ 66 μg/ml) it still bound reasonably well with a profile similar to the Dun1-FHA domain (EC50 ∼ 33 μg/ml). In contrast, the mutants with an abrogated in vivo phenotype bound either very poorly (S85A, 35% maximal binding at 1 mg/ml) or not at all (R70A, N107A). Taken together, these data indicate that the ability to bind phosphopeptide target sequences is a critical determinant of the growth defect caused by the FHA1 domain. However, there are clearly additional specificity requirements for the FHA1-induced G1 arrest, as the Dun1-FHA domain had an in vitro phosphopeptide-binding profile similar to the N112A mutant without causing the same phenotype. The strong growth-defect phenotype of the overexpressed FHA1 domain provided us with an opportunity to identify additional functionally important residues in a random mutagenesis screen. For this purpose, yeast were transformed with a library of randomly mutagenized FHA1 domains. Relative to the plating efficiency of the double-mutant (S85A/H88A) control, ∼8% of the FHA1 sequences in the library contained mutations that abrogated the phenotype a"

This glycoprotein (Le<sup>x</sup>-GP) was expressed in confluent/contact-inhibited cultures but not in sparse cultures of corneal epithelium. In contrast, a 135-kDa glycoprotein bearing precursor, unfucosylated, lactosamine-containing glycans (Galβ1–4GlcNAcβ1-R) was expressed in sparse cultures. Immunofluorescence staining and confocal microscopy of confluent cultures revealed that in corneal epithelium, Le<sup>x</sup> antigen is located in high density at sites of cell-cell adhesion. In <i>in vitro</i> cell-cell adhesion assays, anti-Le<sup>x</sup>, but not anti-sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> monoclonal antibodies, inhibited the formation of corneal epithelial cell-cell adhesion.

Analysis of the expression of<i>Fut</i> genes that encode α-1,3-fucosyltransferases, the enzymes that generate the Le<sup>x</sup> determinant, revealed that confluent/contact-inhibited cultures of rabbit corneal epithelium contain markedly elevated levels of <i>Fut</i>4 and<i>Fut</i>3/5/6 gene transcripts compared with sparse cultures.

https://openalex.org/W2124059487,"Various studies have demonstrated that the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor in adipocytes can activate PI 3-kinase activity without affecting insulin-responsive glucose transporter (GLUT4) translocation. To investigate this phenomenon of receptor signaling specificity, we utilized single cell analysis to determine the cellular distribution and signaling properties of PDGF and insulin in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. The insulin receptor was highly expressed in a large percentage of the cell population (>95%) that also expressed caveolin 2 and GLUT4 with very low levels of the PDGF receptor. In contrast, the PDGF receptor was only expressed in ∼10% of the differentiated 3T3L1 cell population with relatively low levels of the insulin receptor, caveolin 2, and GLUT4. Consistent with this observation, insulin stimulated the phosphorylation of Akt in the caveolin 2- and GLUT4-positive cells, whereas PDGF primarily stimulated Akt phosphorylation in the caveolin 2- and GLUT4-negative cell population. Furthermore, transfection of the PDGF receptor in the insulin receptor-, GLUT4-, and caveolin 2-positive cells resulted in the ability of PDGF to stimulate GLUT4 translocation. These data demonstrate that differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes are not a homogeneous population of cells, and the lack of PDGF receptor expression in the GLUT4-positive cell population accounts for the inability of the endogenous PDGF receptor to activate GLUT4 translocation.

Insulin triggers a large increase in the rate of GLUT4 vesicle exocytosis and a small decrease in the rate of GLUT4 internalization by endocytosis, resulting in a large increase in cell surface GLUT4 protein and subsequent increase in glucose uptake. Currently, the molecular details of insulin signaling leading to GLUT4 translocation remain highly speculative and, in certain aspects, controversial. However, substantial data have established that the activation of the type IA PI 3-kinase and subsequent generation of PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate are essential for the insulin stimulation of GLUT4 translocation. For example, multiple studies using various pharmacological inhibitors, dominant-interfering mutants, expression of a phosphatidylinositol 5′-phosphatase, and expression of a constitutively active catalytic subunit are all consistent with a necessary PI 3-kinase activity for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation (9Clarke J.F.

However, despite the general agreement that PI 3-kinase activity is necessary for insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, a clear demonstration of a sufficient role for PI 3-kinase has not been forthcoming. Indeed, several lines of evidence suggest that one or more PI 3-kinase-independent signals may be required for insulin-stimulated GLUT4 translocation. For example, two naturally occurring insulin receptor mutations were unable to induce GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake yet were fully capable of activating PI 3-kinase (17Krook A. Whitehead J.P. Dobson S.P. Griffiths M.R. Ouwens M. Baker C. Hayward A.C. Sen S.K. Maassen J.A. Siddle K. Tavare J.M. O'Rahilly S. J. Biol.

Activation of the PI 3-kinase through integrin or interleukin 4 receptors had only a small stimulation of GLUT4 translocation and glucose uptake, which was markedly enhanced in the presence of insulin (18Guilherme A.

In this regard, the addition of a cell-permeable PI 3,4,5-trisphosphate analog had no effect on glucose uptake but fully stimulated glucose transport in the presence of insulin despite a complete inhibition of PI 3-kinase activity (20Jiang T.

More recently, a second insulin receptor-dependent signaling pathway has been identified that requires the recruitment of the CAP-Cbl complex to plasma membrane lipid raft microdomain (21Baumann C.A.

Although it is likely that other signaling cascades, in addition to the activation of the PI 3-kinase pathway are required for this process, several studies have reported that activation of the PI 3-kinase by PDGF is sufficient to induce GLUT4 translocation and/or glucose uptake to a similar extent as insulin (22Quon M.J.

To explore the potential basis for this difference in PDGF responsiveness, we have utilized single cell analysis to determine the distribution of PDGF and insulin receptors with respect to GLUT4 translocation-responsive versus nonresponsive 3T3L1 adipocyte cell populations. The monoclonal phosphotyrosine (PY20), polyclonal caveolin 1, and monoclonal caveolin 2 antibodies were purchased from Transduction Laboratories (Lexington, KY), and the phospho-Akt was purchased from New England Biolabs (Beverly, MA). The monoclonal PDGF receptor β subunit antibody was obtained from Biogenesis (Sandown, NH), and fluorescent secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA). All other antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) except for the polyclonal antibody against rat GLUT4 (IAO2), which was generated as previously described (29Kao A.W. Ceresa B.P. Santeler S.R. Pessin J.E. J. Biol.

The human PDGF β receptor was kindly provided by Dr. Andrius Kazlauskas (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). 3T3L1 adipocytes (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) were grown and differentiated as described previously (30Olson A.L. Knight J.B. Pessin J.E. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1997; 17: 2425-2435Crossref PubMed Scopus (206) Google Scholar). Briefly, 9–10-day postdifferentiation adipocytes were electroporated and 18 h later serum-starved for 2 h in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 25 mmglucose and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. The cells were left untreated or stimulated with either insulin (100 nm) or PDGF (20 or 50 ng/ml) for the time indicated at 37 °C. 3T3L1 cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, and cell extracts were prepared by solubilization in lysis buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol, 50 mm NaF, 10 mm NaP2O4, 137 mm NaCl, 1 mmNa3VO4, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, 1 μg/ml pepstatin, 5 μg/ml leupeptin, and 1 mmphenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). Clarified whole cell lysates were separated on 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA), and subjected to Western blotting. Intact cell immunofluorescence was performed by washing the cells once with ice-cold PBS, followed by fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Ft. Washington, PA) and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were then blocked with 5% donkey serum. Plasma membrane sheets were prepared by the method of Robinson et al. (31Robinson L.J. Pang S. Harris D.S. Heuser J. James D.E. J. Cell Biol. 1992; 117: 1181-1196Crossref PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). The membranes were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 20 min and blocked with 5% donkey serum. The cells or plasma membrane sheets were then incubated with primary mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies as indicated for 90 min at 37 °C. Primary antibodies were detected with Texas Red dye-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody and FITC-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody for 2 h at room temperature. The coverslips were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Inc. Burlington, CA) and examined with 40 or 63× oil immersion objectives on a Zeiss LSM510 confocal laser-scanning microscope. Oil Red O staining for lipid was performed on cells that were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min and washed in PBS. The cells were then incubated with 0.6% (w/v) Oil Red O solution dissolved in 50% dimethyl sulfoxide for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were then blocked with 5% donkey serum and followed by incubation with primary rabbit polyclonal antibodies as indicated and secondary fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit antibody as described above. The Oil Red O staining was detected using the same filters as that for Texas Red on the confocal laser-scanning microscope. There are two isoforms of the PDGF receptor (PDGFRα and PDGFRβ) that can homo- and heterodimerize to generate three functional PDGF receptors (32Kazlauskas A. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: E78-E79Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 33Heldin C.H. Westermark B. Physiol. Rev. 1999; 79: 1283-1316Crossref PubMed Scopus (1931) Google Scholar, 34Rosenkranz S. Kazlauskas A. Growth Factors. 1999; 16: 201-216Crossref PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar). In addition, there are three PDGF ligand chains (PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and PDGF-C) that can form at least four functional ligands (PDGF-AA, PDGF-BB, PDGF-AB, and PDGF-CC). The PDGF-BB ligand can interact and activate all three PDGF receptor isoforms, whereas the PDGFR-αα homodimer is the universal receptor capable of interacting with all the known ligands. To determine which functional PDGF receptor(s) are present in differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes, we performed phosphotyrosine immunoblots from control and insulin-, PDGF-AA-, and PDGF-BB-stimulated cells (Fig.1). As expected, insulin stimulation resulted in a marked increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and the insulin receptor β subunit (Fig. 1, lanes 1and 2). In contrast, PDGF-AA had no effect on tyrosine phosphorylation, whereas PDGF-BB induced the tyrosine phosphorylation of the PDGF receptor (Fig. 1, lanes 3 and4). Based upon the ligand specificity of the PDGF receptors, these data indicate that differentiated adipocytes express the PDGFαβ and/or PDGFββ receptors. Caveolin is a major protein component of caveolae structures and plays an important role in the assembly of a signaling cascade leading to GLUT4 translocation (21Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M.

Caveolae are also highly induced during adipocyte differentiation and can occupy up to 20% of the cell surface (39Fan J.Y. Carpentier J.L. van Obberghen E. Grunfeld C. Gorden P. Orci L. J. Cell Sci. 1983; 61: 219-230Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 40Scherer P.E. Okamoto T. Chun M. Nishimoto I. Lodish H.F. Lisanti M.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 131-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (486) Google Scholar). Thus, the expression of caveolin is not only a marker for adipocyte differentiation but only the caveolin-positive cell population is expected to display insulin-responsive GLUT4 translocation. As expected, the majority of the insulin receptor-positive adipocytes were found to co-express caveolin 2 (Fig.2 A, a–c). However, there was a small percentage of cells that had relatively low levels of caveolin 2. These cells also had relatively low levels of insulin receptor. Some of these cells had a fibroblast-like morphology, but others were more rounded, typical of adipocytes. In any case, only a small percentage of the cells were positive for the PDGF receptor (Fig.2 A, d). Importantly, these PDGF receptor-positive cells had very low levels of caveolin 2 expression (Fig. 2 A,d–f). GLUT4 expression was also relatively high in the same cell population that co-expressed caveolin 2 (Fig. 2 A,g–i). We and others have recently observed that caveolin can be detected as torus or donut-shaped structures in isolated plasma membranes from 3T3L1 adipocytes (21Baumann C.A. Ribon V. Kanzaki M.

Thorn H. Borg M. Lindroth M. Peterson K.H. Magnusson K.E. Stralfors P. FASEB. J. 1999; 13: 1961-1971Crossref PubMed Scopus (313) Google Scholar). As previously observed, the insulin receptor was found to partially co-localize in these donut-shaped caveolin 2-positive structures in isolated plasma membrane sheets (Fig.2 B, a–c). In contrast, the plasma membrane sheets that we detected containing the PDGF receptor were essentially devoid of these caveolin 2 structures (Fig. 2 B,d–f). To more directly compare the distribution of the insulin and PDGF receptors, we next examined their cellular distribution by immunofluorescence. Similar to that observed in Fig. 2, the majority of the cell population was insulin receptor-positive; however, a cell field that was relatively abundant in PDGF receptors is shown in Fig.3 A. In any case, the insulin and PDGF receptors were clearly distributed in distinct cell populations with relatively little overlap (Fig. 3 A,a–c). To confirm this apparent cellular heterogeneity in receptor distribution, we next compared the distribution of the insulin and PDGF receptors in comparison with Oil Red O staining as a marker for fully differentiated adipocytes (Fig. 3 B). As expected, the majority of the cell population displayed strong Oil Red O staining in large spherical globules diagnostic for the accumulation of lipid droplets (Fig. 3 B, d–f). In the absence of any primary antibody, there was a low level of labeling throughout the field (Fig. 3 B, a and g). However, all the immunoreactive insulin receptor positive cells were also positive for Oil Red O staining (Fig. 3 B, b,e, and h). The arrow indicates that the signal cell in this field that was negative for the insulin receptor was also negative for the presence of lipid. In contrast, to the insulin receptor, the cells positive for the PDGF receptor had a more fibroblastic appearance and were devoid of lipid droplets (Fig.3 B, c, f, and i). These data demonstrate that the insulin receptor-containing cells are primary fully differentiated adipocytes, whereas the small population of PDGF receptor-positive cells are morphologically distinct from differentiated adipocytes, at least in terms of lipid storage. To examine the signaling properties of these apparently distinct cell subtypes, we utilized single cell analysis to compare the responsive cell populations to Akt phosphorylation. In the basal state, the phosphoserine Akt antibody displayed a low level of immunoreactivity in the entire cell population visualized (Fig.4, a–c). Insulin stimulation resulted in the vast majority of insulin receptor-positive cells displaying an increase in phospho-Akt immunofluorescence (Fig. 4,d–f). Although there was an increase in phospho-Akt immunofluorescence throughout the cell, it was primarily localized at the cell surface membrane, indicative of Akt translocation to the plasma membrane (41Toker A.

In contrast, PDGF stimulation resulted in only a fraction of the cell population undergoing Akt phosphorylation (Fig. 4, g–i). These cells had a more central localization of phospho-Akt and had relatively lower levels of insulin receptor immunoreactivity. Thus, taken together, these data demonstrate that the insulin and PDGF receptor are distributed in distinct cell populations of differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes. Furthermore, insulin and PDGF responsiveness in these cell populations is specifically defined by the presence of these receptor subtypes. Although in our differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes the PDGF receptor is found in a relatively small subset of cells that also has low levels of the insulin receptor, caveolin 2, and GLUT4, other studies have reported that PDGF receptor activation can result in GLUT4 translocation (22Quon M.J.

Therefore, to determine if the PDGF receptor has the capacity to induce GLUT4 translocation when present in the appropriate cell context, we next transfected the human PDGFRβ into differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig. 5). Using a low voltage electroporation technique that primarily results in the transfection/expression of adipocytes and excludes fibroblasts (45Min J. Okada S. Kanzaki M. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K.J.

Cell. 1999; 3: 751-760Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar), the human PDGF receptor was found to be expressed in insulin receptor-, caveolin-, and GLUT4-positive adipocytes (Fig.5 A, a–i). In the basal state, neither the untransfected nor human PDGF receptor-transfected adipocytes displayed significant immunoreactivity with the phospho-Akt antibody (Fig.5 B, a–c). Insulin stimulation resulted in the phosphorylation of Akt in both the untransfected and human PDGF receptor-transfected cells (Fig. 5 B, d–f). However, the insulin stimulation of Akt phosphorylation and translocation to the plasma membrane was somewhat reduced in the PDGF receptor-expressing cells. Quantitation of the number of cells displaying phospho-Akt rim fluorescence indicated that 79% of the non-PDGF receptor-expressing adipocytes were insulin-responsive, which was reduced to 45% in the human PDGF receptor-expressing cell population (Fig. 5 C). In any case, expression of the human PDGF receptor resulted in a PDGF stimulation of phospho-Akt immunoreactivity similar to that of insulin (Fig. 5 B,g–i). Under these conditions, 78% of the human PDGF receptor-expressing adipocytes displayed phospho-Akt at the plasma membrane (Fig. 5 C). The ability of the expressed PDGF receptor to activate Akt in the insulin-responsive cell population provided an assay to determine if the PDGF receptor could couple to GLUT4 translocation. As typically observed (46Thurmond D.C. Ceresa B.P. Okada S. Elmendorf J.S. Coker K. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 33876-33883Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar, 47Elmendorf J.S. Boeglin D.J. Pessin J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 37357-37361Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), expression of a GLUT4-EGFP fusion protein resulted in a perinuclear and small cytoplasmic vesicle distribution (Fig.6 A, b). Insulin stimulation resulted in a strong continuous cell surface GLUT4-EGFP fluorescence characteristic of GLUT4 translocation (Fig. 6 A,d). Since few cells expressed the endogenous PDGF receptor (Fig. 6 A, a, c, and e), PDGF stimulation had a very minor effect on GLUT4-EGFP translocation (Fig. 6 A, f). Quantitation of these data demonstrated that in the basal state ∼15% of the cells displayed a plasma membrane GLUT4-EGFP rim fluorescence (Fig. 6 B). Insulin stimulation resulted in ∼73% of the adipocytes displaying GLUT4-EGFP translocation, whereas PDGF stimulation resulted in only 24% of the cells translocating GLUT4-EGFP (Fig. 6 B). In cell overexpressing the human PDGF receptor, the number of cells displaying GLUT4 cell surface labeling in the basal state decreased to 7% (Fig. 6 A, g and h, andB). Although insulin was still capable of inducing GLUT4 translocation, the number of cells was reduced to 40% (Fig.6 A, i and j) and (Fig. 6 B). These data are consistent with the reduction in insulin-stimulated phospho-Akt activation in the cell population transfected with the human PDGF receptor (Fig. 5). Nevertheless, PDGF was now capable of inducing GLUT4-EGFP translocation to a similar extent as insulin (Fig.6 A, k and h, and (Fig. 6 B). Thus, these data demonstrate that expression of the PDGF receptor in the appropriate cell context will result in the coupling of the PDGF receptor to GLUT4 translocation. Importantly, however, the expression of the PDGF receptor itself has only a partial stimulatory effect and appears to suppress the full extent of insulin stimulation. In summary, there is a substantial controversy about whether the PDGF receptor can couple to the translocation of GLUT4 in adipocytes (22Quon M.J. Chen H. Lin C.H. Zhou L. Ing B.L. Zarnowski M.J.

Endocrinol. 2000; 14: 317-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Our data demonstrate that in well differentiated 3T3L1 adipocytes, the PDGF receptor is primarily expressed in a distinct minor cell population that expresses low levels of the insulin receptor, caveolin, and GLUT4. This findings are consistent with earlier studies demonstrating that the PDGF receptor mRNA and protein are markedly decreased during adipocyte differentiation (48Vaziri C. Faller D.V. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 13642-13648Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (41) Google Scholar,49Huppertz C. Schwartz C. Becker W. Horn F. Heinrich P.C. Joost H.G. Diabetologia. 1996; 39: 1432-1439Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Thus, in our cell context, PDGF receptors are unable to couple to GLUT4 translocation. The observation that activation of the endogenous PDGF receptor can induce GLUT4 translocation by some investigators probably reflects cells that are in an earlier stage of adipocyte differentiation. Similarly, it has been reported that overexpression of the PDGF and epidermal growth factor receptors can result in GLUT4 translocation (22Quon M.J. Chen H. Lin C.H. Zhou L. Ing B.L. Zarnowski M.J.

Consistent with these data, we have also observed that overexpression of the PDGF receptor can couple to GLUT4 translocation. However, it is important to note that the PDGF receptor is substantially less effective than insulin under these conditions. Together, these data underscore the heterogeneity in the differentiated 3T3L1 adipocyte cell population and clearly demonstrate the need to take this diversity into account when analyzing the signal transduction and regulatory pathways controlling GLUT4 translocation.

https://openalex.org/W1989874129,"Integrins are a large family of cell surface receptors that are involved in a wide range of biological processes. The integrin αIIbβ3(glycoprotein IIb-IIIa) is a major platelet glycoprotein heterodimeric receptor that mediates platelet aggregation and is currently a target for pharmaceutical intervention. Ligand binding to the receptor has been shown to induce conformational changes by physical methods and the exposure of neoepitopes (the ligand-induced binding sites). Here we show that the antagonist XP280 induces a conformation that is stable to treatment with SDS and that the protein retains this conformation for several days even after dissociation of the inhibitor. These ligand-induced conformational changes take place with purified protein and on intact platelets. They are competable with an RGDS peptide and are stable to reduction but not boiling or treatment with EDTA. The retention of an altered conformation in the absence of the ligand implies the possibility of ligand-induced alteration of biological function even in the absence of ligand. Finally, similar behavior is observed with the integrin αvβ3, suggesting that access to SDS stable conformations may be conserved throughout the integrin superfamily. The unusual stability, long-lived nature, and potential generality of these conformations could have profound implications for integrin biology."

We show that the protein remains soluble in Tris buffer after removal of detergent. Under these conditions pre-PsbW contains no detectable α-helix, whereas substantial α-helical structure is present in SDS micelles. In aqueous buffer, the tryptophan fluorescence emission characteristics are intermediate between those of solvent-exposed and hydrophobic environments, suggesting the formation of a partially folded structure.

Mature-size PsbW was prepared by removal of the presequence, and we show that this protein also contains α-helix in detergent but in lower quantities than the pre-protein. We therefore propose that pre-PsbW contains α-helical structure in both the mature protein and the signal peptide in nonpolar environments.

However, the post-translational targeting of hydrophobic membrane proteins is potentially problematic because these proteins are by nature prone to aggregation in polar environments. Hence, considerable attention has centered on the mechanisms by which these proteins are initially maintained in a soluble form, and how the hydrophobic regions are then transferred from an aqueous milieu into the apolar regions of the membrane bilayer. The majority of chloroplast and mitochondrial membrane proteins, and probably some bacterial membrane proteins, are inserted post-translationally, and studies on these systems have demonstrated two broad categories of insertion mechanism, which can be regarded as “assisted” and “unassisted” according to whether protein translocation machinery is utilized (reviewed in Ref. 1Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar).In bacteria, the secretory (Sec)1 apparatus, is used for the translocation of proteins into the periplasm, and the same apparatus is also required for the insertion of some membrane proteins. Additional factors are also used for the targeting of membrane proteins, particularly signal recognition particle (SRP) and FtsY (2Gebert J.F. Overhoff B. Manson M. Boos W. J. Biol.

A similar assisted pathway operates in plant chloroplasts for the targeting of some cytosolically synthesized thylakoid membrane proteins. After import across the chloroplast envelope, a subset of thylakoid membrane proteins, exemplified by the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein, Lhcb1, are targeted by a pathway that requires GTP, a stromal form of SRP and FtsY (1Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24-27219Google Scholar). This pathway is thus similar in many respects to bacterial SRP-dependent pathways and is presumably inherited from the cyanobacterial-type progenitors of plant chloroplasts.Other thylakoid membrane proteins are targeted by a second pathway that exhibits very different characteristics. Subunit II of the integral CFo component of the ATP synthase (CFoII), and subunits X and W of photosystem II (PsbX, PsbW) are synthesized with bipartite presequences in which the stroma-targeting peptide is followed by a hydrophobic “signal” peptide. These signal peptides are similar in overall terms to Sec-type signal peptides that direct the targeting of lumenal proteins across the thylakoid membrane by the SecYEG complex. However, these proteins integrate into the thylakoid membrane in the absence of stromal factors, nucleoside triphosphates, or a ΔpH (11Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proteolysis of thylakoids, which blocks Sec-, SRP- and the lumen-targeting ΔpH dependent mechanisms, has no effect on the insertion of these proteins (13Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the absence of any identifiable proteinaceous targeting factor, it has been proposed that they may insert spontaneously into the thylakoid membrane.This particular insertion mechanism is unusual because it involves the use of cleavable signal peptides for unassisted membrane insertion (at the very least, SRP, FtsY, and Sec involvement can be ruled out). Only one other protein, M13 procoat, has been shown to be synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide yet inserted into theEscherichia coli plasma membrane by a Sec/SRP-independent mechanism (for review, see Ref. 14Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although procoat insertion does require the activity of a recently identified membrane-bound component, YidC (15Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature (Lond). 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar).Irrespective of whether unidentified membrane-bound machinery is required for the insertion of the above thylakoid membrane proteins, these proteins represent simple and attractive model systems for the analysis of the early stages of the insertion process. The final stages of the pathway have been characterized to some extent: the two hydrophobic regions (one in the presequence and the other in the mature protein) insert into the membrane, flipping the central acidic region across the membrane and thereby forming a loop intermediate structure. Cleavage by thylakoidal processing peptidase on the transside of the membrane releases the presequence, leaving the N terminus of the mature protein in the thylakoid lumen. The formation of the loop structure has been confirmed (16Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the early stages of the insertion pathway are very poorly understood and the same applies to most other membrane proteins. The basic problem is identical in nearly every case: membrane proteins are inherently difficult to prepare and characterize in aqueous solvents and must normally be stabilized by detergents or chaotropic agents.The relatively simple insertion mechanism used by the PsbW-type proteins, together with the notable insertion-competence of thein vitro translation products, suggested that these proteins may be inherently stable in aqueous phases and hence good model systems for the study of membrane proteins in general. We describe here the purification of pre-PsbW from an E. coli overexpression system in high yields and its characterization in aqueous solution and membrane-mimicking environments.DISCUSSIONThe early events surrounding post-translational membrane protein biogenesis have remained unclear in the vast majority of cases.In vivo, proteins such as pre-PsbW are exposed to two distinct aqueous environments en route to the thylakoid membrane: the cytoplasm (prior to chloroplast import) and the stroma after import. As yet, we do not understand how they avoid aggregation or whether, for example, chaperone molecules help to maintain the proteins in an insertion-competent form. The primary technical problems are that membrane proteins tend to require stabilization with detergents after extraction from membranes, and the in vitroassays used to study protein insertion pathways do not provide any information on the conformation of the membrane proteins at any stage prior to membrane insertion. We have therefore sought to prepare chemical amounts of pre-PsbW to initiate studies into this area.Of particular interest is the question of when and where the α-helices form in this type of membrane protein. The later stages of the pre-PsbW insertion pathway involve the formation of a loop intermediate that spans the thylakoid membrane twice with the N and C termini exposed to the cis face of the membrane and the N terminus of the mature protein in the lumen (16Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic regions in the mature protein and signal peptide are predicted to form α-helices in this loop structure but this has not been tested experimentally, and we have no information on the timing or location of α-helix formation. Theoretical studies in this area have concluded that this process must occur before full insertion into the bilayer, and White and Wimley (23White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) have proposed that this type of protein could follow one of two basic insertion pathways: a “water path” in which the protein folds (i.e. forms α-helices) in the aqueous phase prior to insertion as a folded entity, or an “interface path” where the unfolded protein binds to the membrane interface where α-helix formation is promoted and insertion ensues. However, analyses of the water path are precluded in most cases because of the tendency of membrane proteins to aggregate in aqueous buffer. Apocytochromec has been a popular model system because, despite being a hydrophilic protein, it has the unusual ability to insert spontaneously into membrane bilayers. Recent studies have shown that the protein is largely unstructured in aqueous solution but acquires a highly α-helical structure upon interaction with certain types of lipid, prior to full insertion (24Bryson E.A. Rankin S.E. Carey M. Watts A. Pinheiro T.J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9758-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Apocytochrome c would thus appear to be a prime example of an interface path protein. Otherwise, the best studied cases are of membrane-interactive peptides such as classical signal peptides (25Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), relatively hydrophilic mitochondrial targeting signals (26Roise D. Tomich S.J. Richards J.M. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and melittin (27Ladokhin A.S. White S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1363-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, the peptide sequence exhibits a relatively extended conformation in solution but forms an α-helical structure in hydrophobic environments.Pre-PsbW is by contrast a bona fide membrane protein and this study has provided information on its structure in both membrane-mimicking environments (SDS micelles) and aqueous solution. The CD spectrum of the trypsin-generated mature protein in SDS indicates that, as predicted from the sequence (17Lorkovic Z.J. Schröder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K.-D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), this protein forms a transmembrane α-helix in hydrophobic environments. The precursor protein contains an additional, hydrophobic signal peptide, and such peptides in other systems have been shown to form α-helices in membranes (26Roise D. Tomich S.J. Richards J.M. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because pre-PsbW contains substantially greater α-helix in SDS than does the mature protein, we propose that its signal peptide does indeed form an α-helix and that the precursor therefore forms a helical hairpin once inserted into the membrane.Pre-PsbW is also a rare example of a membrane protein that is amenable to analysis in aqueous environments, and on the basis of the data from this study, we propose that this protein is, like apocytochromec, essentially devoid of α-helical structure in the aqueous phase. The CD structure of the purified Tris-soluble pre-PsbW shows no detectable α-helix content, and the rapid appearance of this structure upon addition of SDS indicates that the hydrophobic regions are available to form α-helical structures in appropriate (i.e. more hydrophobic) environments. However, it is notable that the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum is not consistent with full exposure to solvent, raising the possibility that the protein may adopt a particular folding state(s) that helps to protect the hydrophobic regions. One distinct possibility is that the protein may adopt some form of non-helical hairpin structure in which the two hydrophobic regions interact with each other. One possibility is a loop structure that acquires helical structure once in an appropriate hydrophobic environment.Although the emphasis in this study has been on the characteristics of the Tris-soluble monomer/dimer form of pre-PsbW, we should point out that the data do not rule out the possibility that the initial, 180-kDa multimeric form is physiologically relevant, because this assembly is also highly stable in Tris buffer. However, several factors suggest that this assembly is unlikely to form during the biogenesis of PsbW. First, proteins are imported into chloroplasts in a largely unfolded state, and monomeric pre-PsbW is therefore almost certainly released into the stroma. Second, pre-PsbW is transported into the thylakoid membrane very rapidly during in vitro assays, and it is unlikely that this complex form could be assembled under these conditions because (i) the targeting process is so rapid and (ii) cell-free translation systems generate very small quantities of protein, and hence relatively few molecules of pre-PsbW are imported into a given chloroplast.Nevertheless, further studies are required to resolve these points, and it must be pointed out that it also remains to be confirmed whether the final preparation of purified protein is monomeric or not. Further studies are also required to determine whether the Tris-soluble protein is competent for insertion into thylakoid membranes, and insertion studies with such preparations will certainly help form a coherent picture of the biogenesis of this class of protein. A substantial proportion of newly synthesized proteins are inserted into membrane bilayers, and studies on a variety of systems have shown that this process can occur co- or post-translationally. However, the post-translational targeting of hydrophobic membrane proteins is potentially problematic because these proteins are by nature prone to aggregation in polar environments. Hence, considerable attention has centered on the mechanisms by which these proteins are initially maintained in a soluble form, and how the hydrophobic regions are then transferred from an aqueous milieu into the apolar regions of the membrane bilayer. The majority of chloroplast and mitochondrial membrane proteins, and probably some bacterial membrane proteins, are inserted post-translationally, and studies on these systems have demonstrated two broad categories of insertion mechanism, which can be regarded as “assisted” and “unassisted” according to whether protein translocation machinery is utilized (reviewed in Ref. 1Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar). In bacteria, the secretory (Sec)1 apparatus, is used for the translocation of proteins into the periplasm, and the same apparatus is also required for the insertion of some membrane proteins. Additional factors are also used for the targeting of membrane proteins, particularly signal recognition particle (SRP) and FtsY (2Gebert J.F. Overhoff B. Manson M. Boos W. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 16652-16660Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 3Traxler B. Murphy C. J. Biol.

Luirink J. Mol. Microbiol. 1997; 25: 53-64Crossref PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). A similar assisted pathway operates in plant chloroplasts for the targeting of some cytosolically synthesized thylakoid membrane proteins. After import across the chloroplast envelope, a subset of thylakoid membrane proteins, exemplified by the major light-harvesting chlorophyll-binding protein, Lhcb1, are targeted by a pathway that requires GTP, a stromal form of SRP and FtsY (1Dalbey R.E. Robinson C. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1999; 24: 17-22Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (102) Google Scholar, 8Li X. Henry R. Yuan J. Cline K. Hoffman N.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Schuenemann D. Hoffman N.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 24-27219Google Scholar). This pathway is thus similar in many respects to bacterial SRP-dependent pathways and is presumably inherited from the cyanobacterial-type progenitors of plant chloroplasts. Other thylakoid membrane proteins are targeted by a second pathway that exhibits very different characteristics. Subunit II of the integral CFo component of the ATP synthase (CFoII), and subunits X and W of photosystem II (PsbX, PsbW) are synthesized with bipartite presequences in which the stroma-targeting peptide is followed by a hydrophobic “signal” peptide. These signal peptides are similar in overall terms to Sec-type signal peptides that direct the targeting of lumenal proteins across the thylakoid membrane by the SecYEG complex. However, these proteins integrate into the thylakoid membrane in the absence of stromal factors, nucleoside triphosphates, or a ΔpH (11Michl D. Robinson C. Shackleton J.B. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 1310-1317Crossref PubMed Scopus (101) Google Scholar, 12Kim S.J. Robinson C. Mant A. FEBS Lett. 1998; 424: 105-108Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Furthermore, proteolysis of thylakoids, which blocks Sec-, SRP- and the lumen-targeting ΔpH dependent mechanisms, has no effect on the insertion of these proteins (13Robinson D. Karnauchov I. Herrmann R.G. Klösgen R.B. Robinson C. Plant J. 1996; 10: 149-155Crossref Scopus (41) Google Scholar). In the absence of any identifiable proteinaceous targeting factor, it has been proposed that they may insert spontaneously into the thylakoid membrane. This particular insertion mechanism is unusual because it involves the use of cleavable signal peptides for unassisted membrane insertion (at the very least, SRP, FtsY, and Sec involvement can be ruled out). Only one other protein, M13 procoat, has been shown to be synthesized with an N-terminal signal peptide yet inserted into theEscherichia coli plasma membrane by a Sec/SRP-independent mechanism (for review, see Ref. 14Kuhn A. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 1995; 17: 185-190Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although procoat insertion does require the activity of a recently identified membrane-bound component, YidC (15Samuelson J.C. Chen M. Jiang F. Moeller I. Wiedmann M. Phillips G. Dalbey R.E. Nature (Lond). 2000; 406: 637-641Crossref PubMed Scopus (420) Google Scholar). Irrespective of whether unidentified membrane-bound machinery is required for the insertion of the above thylakoid membrane proteins, these proteins represent simple and attractive model systems for the analysis of the early stages of the insertion process. The final stages of the pathway have been characterized to some extent: the two hydrophobic regions (one in the presequence and the other in the mature protein) insert into the membrane, flipping the central acidic region across the membrane and thereby forming a loop intermediate structure. Cleavage by thylakoidal processing peptidase on the transside of the membrane releases the presequence, leaving the N terminus of the mature protein in the thylakoid lumen. The formation of the loop structure has been confirmed (16Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar), but the early stages of the insertion pathway are very poorly understood and the same applies to most other membrane proteins. The basic problem is identical in nearly every case: membrane proteins are inherently difficult to prepare and characterize in aqueous solvents and must normally be stabilized by detergents or chaotropic agents. The relatively simple insertion mechanism used by the PsbW-type proteins, together with the notable insertion-competence of thein vitro translation products, suggested that these proteins may be inherently stable in aqueous phases and hence good model systems for the study of membrane proteins in general. We describe here the purification of pre-PsbW from an E. coli overexpression system in high yields and its characterization in aqueous solution and membrane-mimicking environments. DISCUSSIONThe early events surrounding post-translational membrane protein biogenesis have remained unclear in the vast majority of cases.In vivo, proteins such as pre-PsbW are exposed to two distinct aqueous environments en route to the thylakoid membrane: the cytoplasm (prior to chloroplast import) and the stroma after import. As yet, we do not understand how they avoid aggregation or whether, for example, chaperone molecules help to maintain the proteins in an insertion-competent form. The primary technical problems are that membrane proteins tend to require stabilization with detergents after extraction from membranes, and the in vitroassays used to study protein insertion pathways do not provide any information on the conformation of the membrane proteins at any stage prior to membrane insertion. We have therefore sought to prepare chemical amounts of pre-PsbW to initiate studies into this area.Of particular interest is the question of when and where the α-helices form in this type of membrane protein. The later stages of the pre-PsbW insertion pathway involve the formation of a loop intermediate that spans the thylakoid membrane twice with the N and C termini exposed to the cis face of the membrane and the N terminus of the mature protein in the lumen (16Thompson S.J. Kim S.J. Robinson C. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 18979-18983Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The hydrophobic regions in the mature protein and signal peptide are predicted to form α-helices in this loop structure but this has not been tested experimentally, and we have no information on the timing or location of α-helix formation. Theoretical studies in this area have concluded that this process must occur before full insertion into the bilayer, and White and Wimley (23White S.H. Wimley W.C. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 319-365Crossref PubMed Scopus (1472) Google Scholar) have proposed that this type of protein could follow one of two basic insertion pathways: a “water path” in which the protein folds (i.e. forms α-helices) in the aqueous phase prior to insertion as a folded entity, or an “interface path” where the unfolded protein binds to the membrane interface where α-helix formation is promoted and insertion ensues. However, analyses of the water path are precluded in most cases because of the tendency of membrane proteins to aggregate in aqueous buffer. Apocytochromec has been a popular model system because, despite being a hydrophilic protein, it has the unusual ability to insert spontaneously into membrane bilayers. Recent studies have shown that the protein is largely unstructured in aqueous solution but acquires a highly α-helical structure upon interaction with certain types of lipid, prior to full insertion (24Bryson E.A. Rankin S.E. Carey M. Watts A. Pinheiro T.J.T. Biochemistry. 1999; 38: 9758-9767Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Apocytochrome c would thus appear to be a prime example of an interface path protein. Otherwise, the best studied cases are of membrane-interactive peptides such as classical signal peptides (25Gierasch L.M. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 923-930Crossref PubMed Scopus (423) Google Scholar), relatively hydrophilic mitochondrial targeting signals (26Roise D. Tomich S.J. Richards J.M. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar), and melittin (27Ladokhin A.S. White S.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1999; 285: 1363-1369Crossref PubMed Scopus (287) Google Scholar). In each of these cases, the peptide sequence exhibits a relatively extended conformation in solution but forms an α-helical structure in hydrophobic environments.Pre-PsbW is by contrast a bona fide membrane protein and this study has provided information on its structure in both membrane-mimicking environments (SDS micelles) and aqueous solution. The CD spectrum of the trypsin-generated mature protein in SDS indicates that, as predicted from the sequence (17Lorkovic Z.J. Schröder W.P. Pakrasi H.B. Irrgang K.-D. Herrmann R.G. Oelmüller R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; 92: 8930-8934Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar), this protein forms a transmembrane α-helix in hydrophobic environments. The precursor protein contains an additional, hydrophobic signal peptide, and such peptides in other systems have been shown to form α-helices in membranes (26Roise D. Tomich S.J. Richards J.M. Schatz G. EMBO J. 1986; 5: 1327-1334Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Because pre-PsbW contains substantially greater α-helix in SDS than does the mature protein, we propose that its signal peptide does indeed form an α-helix and that the precursor therefore forms a helical hairpin once inserted into the membrane.Pre-PsbW is also a rare example of a membrane protein that is amenable to analysis in aqueous environments, and on the basis of the data from this study, we propose that this protein is, like apocytochromec, essentially devoid of α-helical structure in the aqueous phase. The CD structure of the purified Tris-soluble pre-PsbW shows no detectable α-helix content, and the rapid appearance of this structure upon addition of SDS indicates that the hydrophobic regions are available to form α-helical structures in appropriate (i.e. more hydrophobic) environments. However, it is notable that the tryptophan fluorescence emission spectrum is not consistent with full exposure to solvent, raising the possibility that the protein may adopt a particular folding state(s) that helps to protect the hydrophobic regions. One distinct possibility is that the protein may adopt some form of non-helical hairpin structure in which the two hydrophobic regions interact with each other. One possibility is a loop structure that acquires helical structure once in an appropriate hydrophobic environment.Although the emphasis in this study has been on the characteristics of the Tris-soluble monomer/dimer form of pre-PsbW, we should point out that the data do not rule out the possibility that the initial, 180-kDa multimeric form is physiologically relevant, because this assembly is also highly stable in Tris buffer.

In those studies, it was shown that the expression level of the simple inward rectifier K+ channel is correlated with the cell fate selection of neural/epidermal cells (13Okamura Y. Takahashi K. J. Physiol. 1993; 463: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). However, the existence of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels in tunicate has not yet been reported. It is thus of great interest to know whether the G protein-coupled regulation of excitability through the control of the inwardly rectifying K+ channels is conserved or not in the prototype of vertebrates. In the present work, we, for the first time, have isolated cDNAs of two G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel subunits from the tunicate (Halocynthia roretzi) young tadpole. These cDNAs were designated as tunicate G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel-A and -B (TuGIRK-A and -B), respectively. We have shown that these two subunits form heteromultimers whose electrophysiological properties are different from the TuGIRK-A homomultimers. The macroscopic conductance of the TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimer showed a characteristic decline at strongly hyperpolarized potentials. Furthermore, to reveal the structural determinant for this property, we have performed a mutagenesis study and identified a positively charged amino acid at the external mouth of the channel pore (H5) as a critical residue that was found uniquely in the TuGIRK-B subunit. Unidirectional cDNA library of tunicate (H. roretzi) young tadpoles was constructed using a ZAP-cDNA synthesis kit (Stratagene) with oligo(dT)-linker primers. ZAP-cDNA was purified using the Wizard Lambda Preps DNA purification system (Promega). It was used as a template for PCR screening with a degenerative oligonucleotides, which were designed based on the conserved sequences of the Kir family, QTTIGYG (P1: 5′-CA(A/G)ACIACIAT(T/C/A)GGI TA(T/C)GG-3′) and PKKRAET (P2: 5′-IGT(T/C)TCIGCICG(T/C)TT(T/C)TTIGG-3′). Cycling parameters were 94 °C for 1 min, 46 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min for a total of 30 cycles. The PCR products of 159 base pairs in length were subcloned, and the sequences were determined. For obtaining full-length cDNA clones, the same cDNA library was screened by the plaque hybridization method using the two subcloned PCR products as probes. Inserts of positive phages were excised by plasmid rescue of pBluescript SK(−) by R408 helper phage. The obtained clones were sequenced using the PRISM sequence reaction kit (Applied BioSystems) and a DNA sequencer (Applied BioSystems model 377-18). For the electrophysiological analysis, cRNAs were transcribed fromXhoI-digested cDNA using methylated cap analog (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) and T3 RNA polymerase (Stratagene). Point mutants were made using the Sculptor Kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) or QuickChange Kit (Stratagene). The mutation was confirmed by sequencing the primer and the surrounding regions. Unfertilized eggs or young tadpoles were rinsed once in sea water and then transferred to microtubes containing guanidine isothiocyanate solution. After incubation at room temperature for 2 h, RNA was extracted using the acid guanidium-phenol chloroform method (14Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). 5 μg of the purified RNA was reverse transcribed by Superscript 2 (Life Technologies, Inc.), and one-twentieth of the obtained cDNA solution was used as a template for PCR. TuGIRK-A- or TuGIRK-B-specific PCR primer sets were as follows: for TuGIRK-A, 5′-CGGTCAAGGTATTTATCCG-3′ (upstream) and 5′-ATCTGGGCTTCGACTATGTGC-3′ (downstream); for TuGIRK-B, 5′-CCACTTTGGTCGATTTACGC-3′ (upstream) and 5′-CGATTTGACTATCTTTGCCCG-3′ (downstream). Amplifications were performed by 25 cycles of 94 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 1 min, and 72 °C for 1 min. The PCR products were separated on agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide. Whole mount in situ hybridization was carried out as described previously (15Wada S. Katsuyama Y. Yasugi S. Saiga H. Mech. Dev. 1995; 51: 115-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar,16Okamura Y. Ono F. Okagaki R. Chong J.A. Mandel G. Neuron. 1994; 13: 937-948Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The plasmids containing the inserts were linearized with eitherXhoI (sense probe) or NotI (antisense probe) forin vitro synthesis of RNA probes. Oocytes were treated with type 1 collagenase (2 mg/ml; Sigma) for 2 h at room temperature to remove follicle cells and injected with 50 nl of in vitrotranscribed cRNA solution. For the analysis of TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimers, the concentrations of cRNA were ∼50 ng/μl (TuGIRK-A) and 500 ng/μl (TuGIRK-B), respectively. This concentration ratio was used to avoid the formation of TuGIRK-A homomultimers. Since TuGIRK-B homomultimers were confirmed to be nonfunctional, this ratio of TuGIRK-A/B cRNAs enabled us to analyze a channel pool that consisted mostly of TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimers. Gβγ cRNAs were used at a concentration of 500 ng/μl to achieve maximal expression level. Electrophysiological recordings were carried out 2–3 days later under two-electrode voltage clamp (OC-725B-HV; Warner Co.) at room temperature (23 ± 2 °C). Data acquisition and analysis were done on an 80486-based computer using Digidata 1200 and pCLAMP program (Axon Instruments). Intracellular glass microelectrodes were filled with 3 m potassium acetate supplemented with 10 mm KCl, and the resistance ranged from 0.2 to 0.8m ohm. The bath solution contained 90 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). To decrease the K+ concentration, KCl was replaced withN-methyl-d-glucamine chloride. The chord conductance (see Figs. 5, C and F, 9 C, and 10, C and F) was initially calculated based on the EK values assuming intracellular K+ to be 80 mm. However, the exact values of [K+]i and EK of each oocyte are unknown. Therefore, EK used for the calculation of the chord conductance was adjusted in the range of ±3 mV to yield a continuous conductance-voltage plot. In the experiments using blockers, Ba2+ or Cs+ was added simply to the bath solution. Fractions of the remaining currents were calculated at each potential in various concentrations of blockers. By fitting the plot of the dose-block relationship, the half-block concentration (Ki) was calculated at each potential. The δ values, which reflect the depth of the blocking site in the electric field, were calculated as described previously (18Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y.

Data were filtered at 1 kHz by a built-in eight-pole bessel filter, sampled at 5 kHz through the Digidata 1200 (Axon Instruments), and stored in a computer with the pCLAMP program (Axon Instruments). The resistance of the patch pipettes ranged from 3 to 6 m ohm. The patch pipette (extracellular) solution contained 140 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). The bath (extracellular) solution contained 140 mm KCl, 3 mm MgCl2, and 5 mm Hepes (pH 7.4). Single channel current amplitudes at various potentials and mean open times were determined by the pCLAMP software. The slope conductance was calculated from a straight line fitted by eye for the plot of the single channel current-voltage relationship. We aimed at the isolation of cDNA for inwardly rectifying K+ channels (Kir) from tunicates (H. roretzi) and screened a cDNA library of young tadpole by PCR using Kir-specific degenerative oligonucleotide primers. We obtained two kinds of 159-base pair DNA fragments, whose sequences showed ∼60% amino acid identity with G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels of the Kir3 subfamily. These PCR fragments were subcloned and used as probes to isolate full-length cDNA clones from the same cDNA library. Finally, we isolated two cDNA clones, which were designated as TuGIRK-A and -B. TuGIRK-A and -B were ∼2.4 and 2.0 kilobase pairs in size, encoding 612 and 399 amino acid residues, respectively (Fig.1 A). Both the TuGIRK-A and -B proteins had two putative transmembrane segments (M1, M2) and an H5 pore region, similar to mammalian Kir channels (17Ho K. Nichols C.G. Lederer W.J. Lytton J. Vassilev P.M.

Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar). The amino acid sequence of TuGIRK-A exhibited an identity of ∼60% with murine Kir3.2 (4Lesage F. Duprat F. Fink M. Guillemare E. Coppola T. Lazdunski M. Hugnot J-P. FEBS Lett. 1994; 353: 37-42Crossref PubMed Scopus (267) Google Scholar) or Kir3.4 (5Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar) channels. The identity of TuGIRK-B and mammalian Kir3.2 or Kir3.4 was ∼55%. The results of an oligodendrogram analysis based on the Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic averages package are shown in Fig.1 B, demonstrating the relationship of two TuGIRKs and members of the mammalian Kir3 channel families. Members of the Kir family have a conserved sequence GY(or F)GXR in the H5 pore region. GY(or F)G is shown as the K+ ion-selective filter (19Doyle D.A. Morais Cabral J. Pfuetzner R.A. Kuo A.

Both TuGIRK-A and -B had the GYGXR sequence in the H5 pore. The sequence of TuGIRK-B (GYGKR) was very unusual in that it had two positively charged amino acids in tandem. It was expected that this unique Lys residue at 161 might affect the channel properties of TuGIRK-B. The distributions of mRNA expression of TuGIRK-A and -B were studied by RT-PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization. The RT-PCR analysis was done using H. roretzi unfertilized eggs and young tadpoles. Neither mRNA of TuGIRK-A nor TuGIRK-B could be detected in unfertilized eggs, but both of them were expressed in the young tadpoles (Fig. 2). As a next step, we performed the whole mount in situ hybridization analysis in the embryos of various developmental stages, 64-, 110-, and 117-cell, gastrula, neurula, tail bud, and young tadpole stages. The expression patterns of TuGIRK-A and -B highly resembled each other (Fig. 3). They were not expressed up to the gastrula stage (Fig. 3, A and B(a, 64-cell stage; b, gastrula stage)). The transcription of TuGIRK-A and -B mRNA started at the neurula stage in the putative neural cells of the head region (Fig. 3, Aand B (c)). From the tail bud stage, the expression was observed additionally in the neural cells of the neck region (Fig. 3, A and B (d)). These signals were also observed in young tadpoles (Fig. 3, A andB (e)).Figure 3Detection of TuGIRK-A and -B transcripts by the whole mount in situ hybridization method at various developmental stages. The expression pattern of TuGIRK-A (A) and -B (B) is shown. The stages are 64-cell (a), gastrula (b), neurula (c), tail bud (d), and young tadpole (e). Both TuGIRK-A and -B exhibited a similar expression pattern. No signal could be detected until the gastrula stage. From the neurula stage to the young tadpole stage, both TuGIRK-A and -B RNAs were detected in the putative neural cells of the head region (arrowheads inc–e). Furthermore, from the tail bud stage to the young tadpole stage, the expression was observed also in the neural cells of the neck region (arrows in d ande).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Electrophysiological properties of TuGIRK channels were analyzed under two-electrode voltage clamp using the Xenopus oocyte expression system. Mammalian Kir3 channels are known to be activated by Gβγ, which is released upon receptor stimulation (1Inanobe A. Kurachi Y. Handb. Exp. Pharmacol. 2000; 147: 297-331Crossref Google Scholar, 26Logothetis D.E. Kurachi Y. Galper J. Neer E.J. Clapham D.E. Nature. 1987; 325: 321-326Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar, 27Reuveny E.

When TuGIRK-A or -B cRNAs were injected alone, they did not express any detectable current (Fig. 4, A (upper panel) and B), as is generally observed for Kir3 channels (2Kubo Y. Reuveny E.

Nature. 1995; 374: 135-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (747) Google Scholar). As a next step, we coinjected them with Gβγ cRNAs. TuGIRK-A coexpressed with Gβγ showed inwardly rectifying K+ current (TuGIRK-A current), but TuGIRK-B with Gβγ did not (Fig. 4, A (lower panel) andB). When TuGIRK-B was co-expressed with TuGIRK-A and Gβγ, an inwardly rectifying K+ current, whose electrophysiological properties were different from those of the TuGIRK-A current as shown as follows, was observed (Fig. 4,A (lower panel, middle, TuGIRK-A/B current) and B). These results demonstrate that TuGIRK-A forms functional homomultimeric G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels and that TuGIRK-A and -B form functional heteromultimeric G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channels. In the case of the Kir3.1 channel, the small expressed current was attributed not to homomultimer formation but to heteromultimerization with the endogenous Kir subunit ofXenopus oocytes (6Hedin K.E. Lim N.F. Clapham D.E. Neuron. 1996; 16: 423-429Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar). However, the expression level of TuGIRK-A is extremely high (Fig. 4 B), in clear contrast with that of Kir3.1, suggesting that TuGIRK-A forms a functional homomultimer. In various concentrations of extracellular K+, both TuGIRK-A and TuGIRK-A/B channels were active below the equilibrium potential of K+ (EK) (Fig. 5), as is observed in mammalian Kir channels. TuGIRK-A/B current differed from TuGIRK-A current in the following ways. (a) The macroscopic chord conductance of TuGIRK-A/B channels remarkably decreased at strongly hyperpolarized potentials (Fig. 5, D–F). This property was apparently different from that of TuGIRK-A channels (Fig. 5, A–C). (b) TuGIRK-A/B current was less sensitive to the block by extracellular Ba2+ (Fig. 6,D–F) than TuGIRK-A current (Fig. 6, A–C). The values of mean and S.D. of Ki at −120 mV were 52.4 ± 12.5 μm (n = 4) (TuGIRK-A) and 628.5 ± 89.3 μm (n = 3) (TuGIRK-A/B). (c) TuGIRK-A/B current was more sensitive to the block by extracellular Cs+ (Fig.7, D–F) than TuGIRK-A current (Fig. 7, A–C). The values of mean and S.D. ofKi at −120 mV of TuGIRK-A/B were 188.4 ± 88.2 μm (n = 3). In the case of TuGIRK-A, due to the very low sensitivity, the data point range was insufficient for reliable curve fitting to obtain Ki values. TheKi value at −120 mV was estimated to be approximately 2532.2 ± 916.3 μm (n= 3) and was obviously no less than 1 mm. It is apparent that the Ki value of TuGIRK-A is significantly larger than that of TuGIRK-A/B. Thus, it was confirmed that the TuGIRK-B subunit forms a functional heteromultimer with TuGIRK-A, whose electrophysiological properties are distinguishable from those of TuGIRK-A homomultimer.Figure 7The sensitivity of the TuGIRK-A homomultimer and TuGIRK heteromultimer to the block by extracellular Cs+. A similar presentation to Fig. 6 is shown (A, B, D–F). The effect of Cs+ was examined instead of Ba2+. In the case of TuGIRK-A (A–C), reliable curve fittings to obtainKi values could not be done, because the data of effective doses were insufficient due to the extremely low sensitivity. In C, the ratios of the current amplitudes in 0 mm Cs+ and in various concentrations of Cs+ at each membrane potential are presented as abar graph instead of a plot for curve fittings as in F.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) We examined the single channel properties of TuGIRK-A channels and TuGIRK-A/B channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes by the cell-attached patch clamp method with 140 mmK+ in the patch pipette and in the bath (Fig.8, A and B). The kinetics of both TuGIRK-A and -A/B channels exhibited a flickering shape (Fig. 8, A and B). The values of mean open time at −120 mV were 0.72 ms (TuGIRK-A) and 1.1 ms (TuGIRK-A/B), respectively. These properties are characteristic of mammalian Kir3 channels. The slope conductance of the inward current amplitudes of TuGIRK-A was 24.2 ± 1.0 picosiemens (n = 3), and that of TuGIRK-A/B was 18.3 ± 0.9 picosiemens (n = 3) (Fig. 8 C). These results confirmed the difference between the TuGIRK-A homomultimeric channels and the TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimeric channels at the single channel level. To determine the possibility that Lys161 of TuGIRK-B, an additional positively charged amino acid at the external mouth of the pore, is the structural determinant for the difference between the electrophysiological properties of the pore of TuGIRK-A homomultimers and TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimers, we made a point mutant of TuGIRK-B, K161T (TuGIRK-B*). When the K141T mutant of TuGIRK-B was coexpressed with TuGIRK-A and Gβγ, the clear decrease in the macroscopic conductance at hyperpolarized potentials observed in TuGIRK-A/B (Fig. 5, D–F) disappeared (Fig.9, A–C). In comparison with the wild-type -A/B heteromultimers (Fig. 6, D–F), the sensitivity of TuGIRK-A/B* channels to the block by Ba2+was clearly increased (Fig. 10,A–C). The Ki values at −120 mV were changed by the mutation from 628.5 ± 89.3 μm(n = 3) (TuGIRK-A/B) to 23.6 ± 1.85 μm (n = 3) (TuGIRK-A/B*). The sensitivity to the block by Cs+ (Fig. 7, D–F) was slightly decreased (Fig. 10, D–F). The Ki values at −120 mV changed by the mutation from 188.4 ± 88.2 μm (n = 3) (TuGIRK-A/B) to 269.7 ± 42.1 μm (n = 3) (TuGIRK-A/B*). From these results, it was shown that the difference between TuGIRK-A homomultimers and TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimers could, at least partly, be due to the presence of an additional positively charged amino acid at the external mouth of the pore of the TuGIRK-B subunit. To confirm further the functional significance of an additional positively charged amino acid at the external mouth of the pore, we introduced a reverse mutation, T173K, in the TuGIRK-A subunit (TuGIRK-A*). TuGIRK-A* carries two positively charged amino acids at the external mouth of the pore, similar to the TuGIRK-B subunit. In TuGIRK-A* homotetramers (eight charges), a slight decrease in the macroscopic conductance at hyperpolarized potential was observed (Fig.11, A–C), which was not at all seen in the TuGIRK-A homomultimer (four charges) (Fig. 5,A–C). In comparison with the TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimer (5–7 charges at the pore mouth) (Fig. 5, D–F), the decrease in the macroscopic conductance at hyperpolarized potential was more enhanced in TuGIRK-A*/B heteromultimer (eight charges) (Fig. 11,D–F). The values of the ratio of the conductance at −160 mV and the peak conductance were 65.8 ± 2.8% (n= 3) (TuGIRK-A*/B) and 78.9 ± 9% (n = 3) (TuGIRK-A/B). Taken together, the effect of positively charged amino acid at the external mouth of the pore to the macroscopic conductance was further supported by T173K mutation of TuGIRK-A. In addition, we unexpectedly observed that TuGIRK-A* caused a decrease in the intensity of inward rectification (Fig. 11), suggesting a difference in the contribution of this site between TuGIRK-A and -B subunits. We have isolated two types of cDNA, TuGIRK-A and TuGIRK-B, from the young tadpole larvae of the tunicate (H. roretzi), which belong to the Kir3 subfamily. In Xenopus oocytes, TuGIRK-A showed inwardly rectifying K+ current when coexpressed with Gβγ. In contrast, TuGIRK-B did not show detectable current even in the presence of Gβγ. When TuGIRK-A and -B together with Gβγ were coexpressed, an inwardly rectifying K+ current was observed whose electrophysiological properties were different from those of TuGIRK-A. Thus, it was demonstrated that TuGIRK-A but not -B can form functional homomultimeric G protein-coupled channels and that -A and -B can form functional heteromultimeric G protein-coupled channels. Among the members of the Kir3 subfamily, TuGIRK-A exhibited a higher similarity (∼60%) with murine Kir3.2, -3.3, and -3.4 than with Kir3.1, as shown in the dendrogram of Fig. 1 B. From this sequence homology and its neuron-specific expression pattern, TuGIRK-A was speculated to correspond to the murine Kir3.2 subunit. The fact that the homomultimeric channel is functional also supported this speculation. TuGIRK-B was rather distant from Kir3.2, -3.3, and -3.4 and was closer to Kir3.1 (Fig. 1 B). In the H5 pore region of the Kir3.1 subunit, there is a unique Phe at 137, where all other members have a conserved Ser. This unique Phe of Kir3.1 was reported to have an important role in the control of the channel activity (28Kofuji P. Doupnik C.A. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Physiol. 1996; 490: 633-645Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar, 29Chan K.W. Sui J.-L. Vivaudou M. Logothetis D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 14193-14198Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). In TuGIRK-B, Tyr, which has similarity with Phe, is present at the corresponding site. TuGIRK-B is similar to Kir3.1 also in that the homomultimeric channel is not functional (5Krapivinsky G. Gordon E.A. Wickman K. Velimirovic B. Krapivinsky L. Clapham D.E.

Since a tunicate tadpole is a simple prototype of vertebrates, it has been used for various studies of developmental biology. The developmental changes of ion channel expression during neural differentiation were studied intensively using cleavage-arrested blastomeres (9Takahashi K. Okamura Y. Physiol. Rev. 1998; 78: 307-337Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). By these studies, the presence of multiple types of Ca2+ channels (30Hirano T. Takahashi K. J.

Physiol. 1993; 463: 245-268Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) was demonstrated. It was also shown that the expression level of the simple inward rectifier K+ channel is dramatically regulated at the initial stage of neural/epidermal cell fate selection (13Okamura Y. Takahashi K.

On the other hand, knowledge of G protein-coupled responses in tunicate is still insufficient. The presence of the G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel is not demonstrated, although it would be expected to be a common cell response mechanism of animals. By molecular cloning, we, for the first time, have demonstrated the presence of G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+channels in tunicate young tadpole. It remains to be elucidated what kind of receptors link to the regulation of these channels, due to the lack of information of G protein-coupled receptors in tunicate. We investigated the developmental changes of TuGIRK-A and -B mRNA expression by RT-PCR and whole mount in situ hybridization analyses (Figs. 2 and 3). TuGIRK-A and -B mRNA were observed from the neurula stage in presumptive neural cells of the head region. These expressions were continuously seen in the tail bud stage and in the young tadpole larvae. From the tail bud stage, they were additionally expressed in the neural cells of the neck region. During the entire course of development, the expression patterns of TuGIRK-A and -B were highly similar. These results show that TuGIRK-A and -B form functional heteromultimeric channels in neurons in the head and neck region. They might function to regulate the speed of the fictive locomotion of the tadpole by regulating the firing rate of neurons that innervate tail muscles. We compared the electrophysiological properties of the TuGIRK-A homomultimer and the TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimer and observed the following differences. (a) The macroscopic conductance of TuGIRK-A/B decreased at strongly hyperpolarized potential, but that of TuGIRK-A did not (Fig. 5). (b) TuGIRK-A/B was less sensitive to the block by extracellular Ba2+ than TuGIRK-A (Fig. 6). (c) TuGIRK-A/B was more sensitive to the block by extracellular Cs+ than TuGIRK-A (Fig. 7). (d) The single channel conductance of TuGIRK-A/B was smaller than TuGIRK-A (Fig. 8). What is the structural determinant for these differences? In Kir channels, there is a highly conserved positively charged amino acid (Arg148 of Kir2.1) after the K+-selective filter at the external mouth of the pore. The only exception is the Kir7.1 subfamily (23Krapivinsky G. Medina I. Eng L. Krapivinsky L. Yang Y. Clapham D.E.

Neurosci. 1998; 18: 8625-8636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This Arg residue is known to have an important role for permeation (21Kubo Y. Receptors Channels. 1996; 4: 73-83PubMed Google Scholar, 23Krapivinsky G. Medina I. Eng L. Krapivinsky L. Yang Y. Clapham D.E.

Physiol. 1997; 110: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), and ionic selectivity (25Wischmeyer E. Doring F. Karschin A. FEBS Lett. 2000; 466: 115-120Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). It is speculated to serve as an electrostatic barrier for extracellular cations that regulates the permeation and block of the channel (22Sabirov R.Z. Tominaga T. Miwa A. Okada Y. Oiki S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). In both TuGIRK-A and -B, the Arg residue is also conserved at the corresponding sites. Interestingly, TuGIRK-B has an additional positively charged amino acid, Lys, just before the conserved Arg. Thus, two positive charges exist at the external mouth of the pore of TuGIRK-B subunit. We speculated that this site might be the structural determinant for the unique macroscopic conductance property of -A/B channel and introduced a point mutation of K161T to TuGIRK-B (TuGIRK-B*) to neutralize this additional positive charge. In the TuGIRK-A/B* channel, the plot of the current-voltage relationship was straight (Fig. 9), similar to TuGIRK-A channel (Fig. 5, A–C). This result demonstrates that Lys161 of TuGIRK-B is, at least in part, the structural determinant for the unique macroscopic conductance property of TuGIRK-A/B channels. This point was further supported by the data of a reverse mutant of TuGIRK-A, T173K (TuGIRK-A*) (Fig.11). The TuGIRK-A/B* channel was more sensitive to the Ba2+block and less sensitive to the Cs+ block than the TuGIRK-A/B channel. We analyzed the voltage dependence ofKi values of Ba2+ block displayed in Figs. 6, C and F, and 10 C. The calculated δ values (18Kubo Y. Baldwin T.J. Jan Y.N. Jan L.Y. Nature. 1993; 362: 127-133Crossref PubMed Scopus (933) Google Scholar), which reflect the depth of the binding site, differed significantly as follows: TuGIRK-A, 0.25; TuGIRK-A/B, 0.075; TuGIRK-A/B*, 0.32. From these results, it was suggested that the high sensitivity in TuGIRK-A and TuGIRK-A/B* is due to a block at a deep site in the electric field. In TuGIRK-A/B, it was speculated that the positive charge at the external mouth of the pore inhibited the access of Ba2+ to the deep blocking site, and the remaining low sensitivity is due to a block at another very shallow site(s). Taken together, Lys161 was thought to serve not as a binding site for these pore blockers but as an electrostatic barrier for the entrance of extracellular cations, similar to Arg148 of Kir2.1 (22Sabirov R.Z. Tominaga T. Miwa A. Okada Y. Oiki S. J. Gen. Physiol. 1997; 110: 665-677Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). We showed that TuGIRK-A is sufficient to form a functional G protein-coupled inwardly rectifying K+ channel. Why then is TuGIRK-B subunit coexpressed in the same neuron? What is the physiological significance of the TuGIRK-B subunit? One possibility may be that the TuGIRK-B subunit functions to determine the subcellular distribution of the heteromultimeric channel protein. It is known that all members of the murine Kir3 family have a binding motif for integrin, RGD, at the extracellular loop between the first transmembrane region and the H5 pore region (34McPhee J.C. Dang Y.L. Davidson N. Lester H.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 34696-34702Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). It is reported that the interaction of these subunits with integrin is required for appropriate localization and function of Kir3 channels. This integrin binding motif RGD was also present in the TuGIRK-B subunit (amino acids 119–121) but not in TuGIRK-A. It is possible that the TuGIRK-A homomultimer is not located appropriately or not clustered due to the lack of integrin binding domain and that the channel cannot exert its full function, even if it is fully functional in vitro when coexpressed with Gβγ. In contrast, the TuGIRK-A/B heteromultimer, which is supplied an integrin binding site by the TuGIRK-B subunit, might acquire physiological function by localizing at appropriate sites. We thank Drs.

https://openalex.org/W2035839673,"Abstract Escherichia coli hemolysin (HlyA) is the prototype toxin of a major family of exoproteins produced by Gram-negative bacteria known as “repeats in toxins.” Only fatty acid-acylated HlyA molecules at residues Lys564 and Lys690 are able to damage the target cell membrane. Fatty acylation of pro-HlyA is dependent on the co-synthesized acyltransferase HlyC and the acylated form of acyl-carrier protein. By using a collection of hlyA and hlyC mutant strains, the processing of HlyC was investigated. HlyC was not detected by Western blot in an E. coli strain encodinghlyC and hlyA, but it was present in a strain encoding only hlyC. The hlyC mRNA pattern, however, was similar in both strains indicating that the turnover of HlyC does not occur at the transcriptional level. HlyC was detected in Western blots of cell lysates from an E. coli strain encoding HlyC and a HlyA derivative where both acylation sites were substituted. Similar results were obtained when HlyC was expressed in ahlyA mutant strain lacking part of a putative HlyC binding domain, indicating that this particular HlyA region affects HlyC stability. We did not detect HlyC in cell lysates from hlyCmutants with different abilities to acylate pro-HlyA, suggesting that the degradation of HlyC is not related to the HlyA acylation process. The protease systems ClpAP, ClpXP, and FtsH were found to be responsible for the HlyA-dependent processing of HlyC."
