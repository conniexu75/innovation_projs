https://openalex.org/W4281784908,"Epidemiologic surveillance has revealed decoupling of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) hospitalizations and deaths from case counts after emergence of the Omicron (B.1.1.529) severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) variant globally. However, assessment of the relative severity of Omicron variant infections presents challenges because of differential acquired immune protection against Omicron and prior variants and because longer-term changes have occurred in testing and healthcare practices. Here we show that Omicron variant infections were associated with substantially reduced risk of progression to severe clinical outcomes relative to time-matched Delta (B.1.617.2) variant infections within a large, integrated healthcare system in Southern California. Adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs) for any hospital admission, symptomatic hospital admission, intensive care unit admission, mechanical ventilation and death comparing individuals with Omicron versus Delta variant infection were 0.59 (95% confidence interval: 0.51–0.69), 0.59 (0.51–0.68), 0.50 (0.29–0.87), 0.36 (0.18–0.72) and 0.21 (0.10–0.44), respectively. This reduced severity could not be explained by differential history of prior infection among individuals with Omicron or Delta variant infection and was starkest among individuals not previously vaccinated against COVID-19 (aHR = 0.40 (0.33–0.49) for any hospital admission and 0.14 (0.07–0.28) for death). Infections with the Omicron BA.2 subvariant were not associated with differential risk of severe outcomes in comparison to BA.1/BA.1.1 subvariant infections. Lower risk of severe clinical outcomes among individuals with Omicron variant infection should inform public health response amid establishment of the Omicron variant as the dominant SARS-CoV-2 lineage globally. Comparison of outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 Delta and Omicron infections shows reduced severity of Omicron infections, most notably in unvaccinated individuals, and no differential risk of severe outcomes between subvariants BA.1 and BA.2. The findings highlight the importance of continual assessment of clinical outcomes associated with SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern to inform both medical interventions and healthcare resource management."
https://openalex.org/W4285505880,"Background The clinical implementation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) could be one of the first milestones towards realizing personalized medicine in routine care. However, its widespread adoption requires the availability of suitable clinical decision support (CDS) systems, which is often impeded by the fragmentation or absence of adequate health IT infrastructures. We report results of CDS implementation in the large-scale European research project Ubiquitous Pharmacogenomics (U-PGx), in which PGx CDS was rolled out and evaluated across more than 15 clinical sites in the Netherlands, Spain, Slovenia, Italy, Greece, United Kingdom and Austria, covering a wide variety of healthcare settings. Methods We evaluated the CDS implementation process through qualitative and quantitative process indicators. Quantitative indicators included statistics on generated PGx reports, median time from sampled upload until report delivery and statistics on report retrievals via the mobile-based CDS tool. Adoption of different CDS tools, uptake and usability were further investigated through a user survey among healthcare providers. Results of a risk assessment conducted prior to the implementation process were retrospectively analyzed and compared to actual encountered difficulties and their impact. Results As of March 2021, personalized PGx reports were produced from 6884 genotyped samples with a median delivery time of twenty minutes. Out of 131 invited healthcare providers, 65 completed the questionnaire (response rate: 49.6%). Overall satisfaction rates with the different CDS tools varied between 63.6% and 85.2% per tool. Delays in implementation were caused by challenges including institutional factors and complexities in the development of required tools and reference data resources, such as genotype-phenotype mappings. Conclusions We demonstrated the feasibility of implementing a standardized PGx decision support solution in a multinational, multi-language and multi-center setting. Remaining challenges for future wide-scale roll-out include the harmonization of existing PGx information in guidelines and drug labels, the need for strategies to lower the barrier of PGx CDS adoption for healthcare institutions and providers, and easier compliance with regulatory and legal frameworks."

However, it is unclear how prosodic differences in ASD manifest across different languages that demonstrate cross-linguistic variability in prosody. Using a supervised machine-learning analytic approach, we examined acoustic features relevant to rhythmic and intonational aspects of prosody derived from narrative samples elicited in English and Cantonese, two typologically and prosodically distinct languages. Our models revealed successful classification of ASD diagnosis using rhythm-relative features within and across both languages. Classification with intonation-relevant features was significant for English but not Cantonese. Results highlight differences in rhythm as a key prosodic feature impacted in ASD, and also demonstrate important variability in other prosodic properties that appear to be modulated by language-specific differences, such as intonation."
https://openalex.org/W4285685360,"This study investigated the reliability and factorial validity of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) in the context of university students in Bangladesh. The research aimed to assess whether the original one-dimensional model or a model containing both somatic and cognitive-emotional factors is appropriate in the case of a sample of university students. A repeated cross-sectional survey design based on convenience sampling was used to collect data from 677 university students from both public and private universities. The factor structure of the PHQ-9 was assessed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Measurement invariances were assessed across gender, type of university, level of education and victim of domestic violence. Its convergent validity was determined by investigating its correlations with Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) and Patient Health Questionnaire Anxiety-Depression Scale (PHQ-ADS). Results showed excellent reliability of PHQ-9 as measured by both Cronbach’s α and McDonald’s ω. CFA suggested that a modified one-factor model where the error variances between item-3 (‘sleeping difficulties’) and item-6 (‘feeling as a failure’), item-6 and item-9 (‘suicidal thoughts’), item-4 (‘feeling tired’) and item-9, item-3 and item-9 were allowed to covary is appropriate for the sample. This model provided high values of comparative fit index (CFI), goodness of fit index (GFI), and Tucker Lewis Index (TLI), low value of standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) and a non-significant root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) as well as a high Factor Determinacy Score Coefficient. Correlation between PHQ-9 and GAD-7 was 0.751 and 0.934 between PHQ-9 and PHQ-ADS. Finally, the model is strictly invariant across gender and university type. Overall, the study provided support for modified unidimensional structure for PHQ-9 and showed high internal consistency along with good convergent validity."
https://openalex.org/W4285412262,"Southern blight of tomato caused by Sclerotium rolfsii can cause severe plant mortality and yield losses. The use of rhizobacteria for the biological control of Southern blight disease is a potent alternative to chemical fungicides. Although rhizobacteria are prolific candidates, comprehensive reports regarding their use in tomato disease management are limited. The present study screened six rhizobacterial strains for antagonism against S. rolfsii in dual culture and culture filtrate assays. The selected promising strains were tested further for plant-growth-promoting and biocontrol potentials under in vitro, greenhouse, and field conditions. Of the six strains screened, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia PPB3 and Bacillus subtilis PPB9 showed the superior performance displaying the highest antagonism against S. rolfsii in dual culture (PPB3 88% and PPB9 71% inhibition), and culture filtrate assays (PPB3 53-100% and PPB9 54-100% inhibition at various concentrations). Oxalic acid produced by S. rolfsii was significantly inhibited by both rhizobacteria and supported their growth as a carbon source. The strains produced hydrogen cyanide, chitinases, siderophores, biofilm, and indole acetic acid. They showed the potential to solubilize phosphate and fix nitrogen. Seed treatment with S. maltophilia PPB3 and B. subtilis PPB9 improved seed germination and tomato seedling vigour. Significant increases in plant growth, chlorophyll contents, and N, P, and K concentrations were attained in bacterized plants compared to non-treated controls. The application of antagonists on container-grown seedlings in a greenhouse environment and field-grown tomato plants reduced symptoms of damping-off and Southern blight. The sclerotial counts decreased significantly in these soils. Bacteria-inoculated plants had a higher yield than those in the non-treated control. Bacteria colonized the entire roots, and their populations increased significantly in the protected plants. The results show the potential capabilities of S. maltophilia PPB3 and B. subtilis PPB9 for growth promotion, nutrient acquisition, and biocontrol of southern blight disease in tomatoes."

https://openalex.org/W4285612511,"Digital technologies empower users to manage their health and reduce the burden on the public health system. The mass adoption of wearable medical devices (WMDs) promotes the ageing population’s confidence besides facilitating users. Thus, the current study aims to empirically evaluate the formation of perceived product value (PPV) with the WMDs’ computability, usefulness, cost, and accuracy, the intention to use WMDs influenced by health consciousness (HCS), health anxiety (HAY), product value, and perceived critical mass (PCM), and later the adoption of WMDs among Chinese adults. The study examined the mediating effect of PPV on the relationship between the intention to use WMDs and perceived compatibility (PCT), perceived cost (PCO), perceived usefulness (PUS), and perceived technology accuracy (PTA). This study adopted a cross-sectional approach and used an online survey to collect quantitative data from 1,160 Chinese adults. Data analysis was performed using the partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Results showed that PCT, PUS, and PTA significant positive effect on PPV. Meanwhile, HCS, PCM, and PPV has a significant positive effect on intention to use WMDs, and the intention to use WMDs and PCM influenced the adoption of WMDs. Consequently, the analysis confirmed that PPV mediated the relationships between the intention to use WMD and PCT, PUS, and PTA. The WMD cost must be reduced to enhance the value of WMDs. Finally, the study’s implications, limitations, and suggestions for future studies are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4285613081,"This study explores the effects and influence paths of service quality, brand image, perceived value, and service satisfaction on outpatients' loyalty to China's private dental clinics.A cross-sectional survey study was conducted in Dongguan City, Guangdong Province, China in January 2019. The participants were selected using the convenience sampling method. Of the 230 residents surveyed, 125 had received services in private dental clinics, being the valid sample of this study. A multiple linear regression model was used in exploring factors influencing patient loyalty. Subsequently, the path analysis was used in investigating the relationships among service quality, brand image, perceived value, patient satisfaction, and patient loyalty.After the effects of demographic and socioeconomic variables were controlled, perceived value and patient satisfaction showed significant influences on patient loyalty. Path analysis indicated that perceived value, perceived quality, and expected quality have direct effects on patient satisfaction and have indirect effects on patient loyalty, and patient satisfaction is a mediator.Perceived service quality influences patient loyalty through the effect of patient satisfaction, which plays a key role in promoting patient loyalty. This study implies that managers in private dental clinics can gain support from customers by building customer loyalty toward dental clinics."
https://openalex.org/W4285685016,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) constitutes a major public health challenge, with a global prevalence of 15-74.7 cases /million children. Preventing CKD in children, slowing its progression and management of complications are essential, especially in challenged health systems in low middle income countries (LMIC). We conducted a retrospective review to assess the underlying cause and stage of CKD at presentation and clinical outcomes in children and adolescents at the Indus Hospital and Health Network (IHHN) in Karachi, Pakistan.Children 0-16 years with CKD stage 1 and/or higher at presentation were included. Data including demographics, clinical status and lab results at presentation and during follow-up, surgical intervention if any, kidney function at last visit and outcome at last follow-up was recorded.A total of 229 children diagnosed with CKD are included in our study. The median age at diagnosis was 10 years with male: female ratio of 1.8:1. Only 5% children presented in stage 1 CKD. The rate of adverse outcomes is 4.5 times higher in children with CKD stage 3-5 compared to early CKD. Congenital anomaly of kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) was the underlying cause in 49% children. Children with glomerular disease had comparatively worse outcome. Proteinuria, hypertension, anemia and bone disease were associated with high morbidity and mortality.The true epidemiology of childhood CKD is unknown in Pakistan. Our cohort showed better CKD outcomes in children diagnosed early with appropriate surgical and medical follow-up. Prompt diagnosis, treatment and prevention of progression can be life-saving in our setting. CKD registry data can inform policy changes that can prevent poor outcomes."
https://openalex.org/W4285413085,"Assisted reproductive technology has been proposed for women with infertility. Moreover, in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles are increasing. Factors contributing to successful pregnancy have been widely explored. In this study, we used machine learning algorithms to construct prediction models for clinical pregnancies in IVF.A total of 24,730 patients entered IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection cycles with clinical pregnancy outcomes at Taipei Medical University Hospital. Data used included patient characteristics and treatment. We used machine learning methods to develop prediction models for clinical pregnancy and explored how each variable affects the outcome of interest using partial dependence plots.Experimental results showed that the random forest algorithm outperforms logistic regression in terms of areas under the receiver operating characteristics curve. The ovarian stimulation protocol is the most important factor affecting pregnancy outcomes. Long and ultra-long protocols have shown positive effects on clinical pregnancy among all protocols. Furthermore, total frozen and transferred embryos are positive for a clinical pregnancy, but female age and duration of infertility have negative effects on clinical pregnancy.Our findings show the importance of variables and propensity of each variable by random forest algorithm for clinical pregnancy in the assisted reproductive technology cycle. This study provides a ranking of variables affecting clinical pregnancy and explores the effects of each treatment on successful pregnancy. Our study has the potential to help clinicians evaluate the success of IVF in patients."
https://openalex.org/W4285413212,"Understanding the underlying and unpredictable dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is important. We supplemented the findings of Jones and Strigul (2020) and described the chaotic behavior of COVID-19 using state space plots which depicted the changes in asymptotic behavior and trajectory brought about by the increase or decrease in the number of cases which resulted from the easing or tightening of restrictions and other non-pharmaceutical interventions instituted by governments as represented by the country's stringency index (SI). We used COVID-19 country-wide case count data and analyzed it using convergent cross-mapping (CCM) and found that the SI influence on COVID-19 case counts is high in almost all the countries considered. When we utilized finer granular geographical data ('barangay' or village level COVID-19 case counts in the Philippines), the effects of SI were reduced as the population density increased. The authors believe that the knowledge of the chaotic behavior of COVID-19 and the effects of population density as applied to finer granular geographical data has the potential to generate more accurate COVID-19 non-linear prediction models. This could be used at the local government level to guide strategic and highly targeted COVID-19 policies which are favorable to public health systems but with limited impact to the economy."
https://openalex.org/W4285507690,"Temporal measures (latencies) in the event-related potentials of the EEG (ERPs) are a valuable tool for estimating the timing of mental processes, one which takes full advantage of the high temporal resolution of the EEG. Especially in larger scale studies using a multitude of individual EEG-based tasks, the quality of latency measures often suffers from high and low frequency noise residuals due to the resulting low trial counts (because of compressed tasks) and because of the limited feasibility of visual inspection of the large-scale data. In the present study, we systematically evaluated two different approaches to latency estimation (peak latencies and fractional area latencies) with respect to their data quality and the application of noise reduction by jackknifing methods. Additionally, we tested the recently introduced method of Standardized Measurement Error (SME) to prune the dataset. We demonstrate that fractional area latency in pruned and jackknifed data may amplify within-subjects effect sizes dramatically in the analyzed data set. Between-subjects effects were less affected by the applied procedures, but remained stable regardless of procedure."
https://openalex.org/W4281726286,"Lipoprotein (a)-Lp(a) has proinflammatory, prothrombotic and proatherogenic properties and may theoretically influence the course of COVID-19.The aim of the study was to explore whether patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 with Lp(a) ≥30mg/dl may develop a worse course of the disease, increased incidence of thromboembolic complications, intubation and ICU hospitalization or death.A retrospective analysis was performed of 124 patients hospitalized due to COVID-19 in the Department of Internal Diseases and Clinical Pharmacology between 29 November 2020 and 15 April 2021. The only exclusion criterion was age≥80 years. Patients were divided into two groups: 1. COVID-19 patients with Lp(a) <30mg/dl regarded as not elevated n = 80; 2. COVID-19 patients with Lp(a) ≥30 regarded as elevated n = 44.A total of 124 COVID-19 patients were included in the study (66 men and 58 women) with a mean age of 62.8±11 years. COVID-19 patients with elevated Lp(a) level had significantly longer hospitalization time (11 vs. 9.5 days; p = 0.0362), more extensive radiological changes in CT scan (35 vs. 30%; p = 0.0301) and higher oxygen demand on admission (8 vs. 5L/min; p = 0.0428). Elevated Lp(a) was also associated with significantly higher OR for High Flow Nasal Oxygen Therapy (HFNOT) OR = 3.5 95%CI(1.2;8.9), p = 0.0140, Intubation and ICU OR = 4.1 95%CI(1.1;15.2) p = 0.0423, Death OR = 2.8 95%CI(0.9;8.5), p = 0.0409.Elevated Lp(a) might be one of the factors which contribute to a more severe course of COVID-19; however, further studies including larger groups of patients are needed."
https://openalex.org/W4285611935,"Slaughterhouses are a key source of bacterial contamination in poultry meat and products, which is a major health and economic concern for several public authorities. This study aimed to quantify the non-compliance of bacterial contamination on chicken meat sampled from slaughterhouses and identify risk factors associated with the contamination. A questionnaire survey of 569 chicken slaughterhouses was undertaken and 1,707 meat samples were collected to determine the level of bacterial contamination. The proportion of the non-compliance associated with aerobic plate count [APC] (24.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3%), Enterococcus spp. (24.7%), coliforms (13.5%), Escherichia coli (33.3%), and Salmonella spp. (33.4%) based on the livestock authorities’ criteria was determined. Our results highlighted that the scalding process without scalding water temperature control or improper scalding increased the risk of APC (odds ratio, OR = 4.84, 95% CI: 2.72–8.61), S . aureus (OR = 2.68, 95% CI: 1.29–5.55), Enterococcus spp. (OR = 3.38, 95% CI: 2.01–5.69), coliforms (OR = 3.01, 95% CI: 1.47–6.15), and E . coli (OR = 2.69, 95% CI: 1.58–4.56) contamination on meat samples. Meat from eviscerated carcasses was more likely to be non-compliance due to contamination by E . coli (OR = 1.96, 95% CI: 1.14–3.38). Furthermore, open or semi-closed system slaughterhouses (OR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.23–2.60) and lack of equipment for specific slaughtering areas (OR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.04–2.61) increased the likelihood of Salmonella spp. occurrence. This is the first study of factors influencing the non-compliance of meat samples across Thailand. Authorities can use the study findings to enhance food safety strategies at the national level."
https://openalex.org/W4285743156,"Objective Although geographically specific data can help target HIV prevention and treatment strategies, Nigeria relies on national- and state-level estimates for policymaking and intervention planning. We calculated sub-state estimates along the HIV continuum of care in Nigeria. Design Using data from the Nigeria HIV/AIDS Indicator and Impact Survey (NAIIS) (July–December 2018), we conducted a geospatial analysis estimating three key programmatic indicators: prevalence of HIV infection among adults (aged 15–64 years); antiretroviral therapy (ART) coverage among adults living with HIV; and viral load suppression (VLS) rate among adults living with HIV. Methods We used an ensemble modeling method called stacked generalization to analyze available covariates and a geostatistical model to incorporate the output from stacking as well as spatial autocorrelation in the modeled outcomes. Separate models were fitted for each indicator. Finally, we produced raster estimates of each indicator on an approximately 5×5-km grid and estimates at the sub-state/local government area (LGA) and state level. Results Estimates for all three indicators varied both within and between states. While state-level HIV prevalence ranged from 0.3% (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 0.3%–0.5%]) to 4.3% (95% UI: 3.7%–4.9%), LGA prevalence ranged from 0.2% (95% UI: 0.1%–0.5%) to 8.5% (95% UI: 5.8%–12.2%). Although the range in ART coverage did not substantially differ at state level (25.6%–76.9%) and LGA level (21.9%–81.9%), the mean absolute difference in ART coverage between LGAs within states was 16.7 percentage points (range, 3.5–38.5 percentage points). States with large differences in ART coverage between LGAs also showed large differences in VLS—regardless of level of effective treatment coverage—indicating that state-level geographic targeting may be insufficient to address coverage gaps. Conclusion Geospatial analysis across the HIV continuum of care can effectively highlight sub-state variation and identify areas that require further attention in order to achieve epidemic control. By generating local estimates, governments, donors, and other implementing partners will be better positioned to conduct targeted interventions and prioritize resource distribution."
https://openalex.org/W4281621704,"Exercise is beneficial for physical and psychological health, yet the majority of Australian adults are not sufficiently active to gain health benefits. Novel methods are needed to enhance the experience of exercise and ultimately exercise participation. The present study examined performance and psychological experiences during a (non-immersive) virtual reality cycling task that incorporated affective feedback. Female participants ( N = 137, university students) received either positive, negative, or neutral virtual feedback while cycling on a stationary bicycle in a virtual reality laboratory environment under the instruction to maintain at least 70% of their maximal heart rate for as long as possible (or up to 30 minutes). Participants also responded to measures of affect, motivation, enjoyment, and competitiveness. Data were analysed with ANOVA’s performed with feedback groups and trait competitiveness for the psychological and performance dependent measures. Results showed that positive feedback elicited greater interest and enjoyment during the task than neutral and negative feedback. In addition, perceived competence was greater with positive feedback than for neutral and negative feedback in low competitive participants. The type of feedback did not affect performance (cycling persistence, perceived exertion, and effort). The findings indicate the potential importance of providing positive virtual feedback and considering the interaction of individual difference factors, specifically competitiveness, to enhance virtual exercise experiences."
https://openalex.org/W4285505089,"Most research examining individuals who follow different diets has combined vegetarians and vegans into a single group. To investigate whether this consolidation is justified, we analyzed possible differences between vegetarians and vegans for the Big Five personality traits in two studies. In our pre-study, we used data from a German convenience sample of 400 vegetarians and 749 vegans and found that vegans reported slightly higher scores in Openness compared to vegetarians (d = 0.22). In the preregistered main study, we used data provided by 1203 vegetarians and 128 vegans from the German Socio-Economic Panel Study; we found that vegetarians reported slightly higher scores in Neuroticism compared to vegans (d = 0.18) but did not differ in Openness. We found no differences in Conscientiousness, Extraversion, or Agreeableness in either study. Controlling for the socio-demographic variables of age, gender, and socio-economic status did not alter the pattern of results. Overall, these results suggest that there are no or only small differences in Openness or Neuroticism between vegetarians and vegans. Further studies utilizing very large, representative samples are needed to better understand the relationship between personality and diet groups."
https://openalex.org/W4285740151,"In Ghana, uncomplicated malaria and sickle cell disease (SCD) is common, hence comorbidity is not farfetched. However, the extent of oxidative stress and the array of clinical manifestations in this comorbidity (presence of both malaria and SCD) has not been fully explored. This study highlights the impact of uncomplicated malaria on SCD. The level of isoprostane, 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α (8-iso-PGF2α) was used to assess oxidative stress while plasma biochemistry and urinalysis was used to assess renal function. Hematological profiling was also done to assess the impact of comorbidity on the hematological cell lines. Of the 411 study participants with malaria, 45 (11%) had SCD. Mean body temperature was significantly higher in comorbidity compared to malaria and SCD cohorts, while a lower parasite density range was obtained in comorbidity compared to malaria cohorts. Furthermore, in comorbidity, the 8-iso-PGF2α oxidative stress biomarker was significantly elevated in all ages, parasite density ranges and gender groups. Comorbidity affected both leukocytic and erythrocytic cell lines with significant eosinophilia and monocytosis coexisting with erythrocytic parameters consistent with severe anemia. Biochemically, while plasma creatinine and bilirubin were significantly elevated in comorbidity, spot urinary creatinine was significantly reduced. Additionally, urine samples in the comorbid state were slightly acidic and hypersthenuric with significant hematuria, proteinuria, and bilirubinemia. Finally, 80% or more malaria-SCD presented with chills, fever, anorexia, headache, joint pains, lethargy, and vomiting. In conclusion, malaria could induce vaso-occlusive crisis in sickle cell disease, therefore, prompt management will alleviate the severity of this comorbidity."
https://openalex.org/W4281636240,"Introduction Uterine body cancers (UBC) are represented by endometrial carcinoma (EC) and uterine sarcoma (USa). The clinical management of both is hindered by the complex classification of patients into risk classes. This problem could be simplified through the development of predictive models aimed at treatment tailoring based on tumor and patient characteristics. In this context, radiomics represents a method of extracting quantitative data from images in order to non-invasively acquire tumor biological and genetic information and to predict response to treatments and prognosis. Furthermore, artificial intelligence (AI) methods are an emerging field of translational research, with the aim of managing the amount of data provided by the various -omics, including radiomics, through the process of machine learning, in order to promote precision medicine. Objective The aim of this protocol for systematic review is to provide an overview of radiomics and AI studies on UBCs. Methods and analysis A systematic review will be conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library to collect papers analyzing the impact of radiomics and AI on UBCs diagnosis, prognostic classification, and clinical outcomes. The PICO strategy will be used to formulate the research questions: What is the impact of radiomics and AI on UBCs on diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical results? How could radiomics or AI improve the differential diagnosis between sarcoma and fibroids? Does Radiomics or AI have a predictive role on UBCs response to treatments? Three authors will independently screen articles at title and abstract level based on the eligibility criteria. The risk of bias and quality of the cohort studies, case series, and case reports will be based on the QUADAS 2 quality assessment tools.

This hampers both studies on language spatiality and public outreach of language diversity. We present best practices for creating and sharing digital spatial language data by collecting and harmonizing Uralic language distributions as case study. Language distribution studies have utilized various methodologies, and the results are often available as printed maps or written descriptions. In order to analyze language spatiality, the information must be digitized into geospatial data, which contains location, time and other parameters. When compiled and harmonized, this data can be used to study changes in languages' distribution, and combined with, for example, population and environmental data. We also utilized the knowledge of language experts to adjust previous and new information of language distributions into state-of-the-art maps. The extensive database, including the distribution datasets and detailed map visualizations of the Uralic languages are introduced alongside this article, and they are freely available."
https://openalex.org/W4285744238,"This paper focuses on 6D pose estimation for weakly textured targets from RGB-D images. A 6D pose estimation algorithm (DOPE++) based on a deep neural network for weakly textured objects is proposed to solve the poor real-time pose estimation and low recognition efficiency in the robot grasping process of parts with weak texture. More specifically, we first introduce the depthwise separable convolution operation to lighten the original deep object pose estimation (DOPE) network structure to improve the network operation speed. Second, an attention mechanism is introduced to improve network accuracy. In response to the low recognition efficiency of the original DOPE network for parts with occlusion relationships and the false recognition problem in recognizing parts with scales that are too large or too small, a random mask local processing method and a multiscale fusion pose estimation module are proposed. The results show that our proposed DOPE++ network improves the real-time performance of 6D pose estimation and enhances the recognition of parts at different scales without loss of accuracy. To address the problem of a single background representation of the part pose estimation dataset, a virtual dataset is constructed for data expansion to form a hybrid dataset."
https://openalex.org/W4281744887,"The ratio of men and women in the adult population, i.e. sex ratio, has long been recognized as a key demographic constraint for partnering behavior. However, the literature remains contradictory on how sex ratio imbalances influence partnering behavior, suggesting either higher or lower rates of male marriage being associated with male-skewed sex ratios. These contradictory findings are likely due to data limitations. Cross-sectional data or limited observation periods preclude studies from distinguishing sex ratio effects on timing from effects on the overall likelihood of marriage. In this paper, we use historical family reconstitution data to study the association of sex ratios with marriage patterns in the French colony of the St. Lawrence Valley in North America (1680–1750). The population experienced a substantial male-skew from sex-selective immigration during the early period of the colony. The long-running observation period allow for differentiating the timing and overall likelihood of marriage. Finally, the data enable us to study the effects of male-skews on the population-level as well as the regional and parish level. Cox proportional hazard models reveal that while male-skewed sex ratios are associated earlier marriage for women, the association with men’s marital biographies is less clear-cut. We find that men marry later when sex ratios are more male-skewed, yet we do not find a substantial reduction in the overall likelihood of marriage for men. Our findings reveal that male-skewed sex ratios do not necessarily result in an increase of never married men. We discuss the implications of our findings for the sex ratio literature."
https://openalex.org/W4285505124,"The inflammatory response to joint injury has been thought to play a key role in the development of osteoarthritis. In this preclinical study, we hypothesized that synovial fluid presence of inflammatory cytokines, as well as altered loading on the injured leg, would be associated with greater development of macroscopic cartilage damage after an ACL injury. Thirty-six Yucatan minipigs underwent ACL transection and were randomized to: 1) no further treatment, 2) ACL reconstruction, or 3) scaffold-enhanced ACL restoration. Synovial fluid samples and gait data were obtained pre-operatively and at multiple time points post-operatively. Cytokine levels were measured using a multiplex assay. Macroscopic cartilage assessments were performed following euthanasia at 52 weeks. General estimating equation modeling found the presence of IL-1α, IL-1RA, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, and IL-10 and MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-12, and MMP-13 in the synovial fluid was associated with better cartilage outcomes. Higher peak pressure for the surgical hind leg and contralateral hind leg aligned with worse cartilage outcomes. A support vector machine built with synovial fluid and gait metrics also demonstrated cytokine presence was predictive of better cartilage outcomes. In conclusion, this preclinical analysis suggests that synovial fluid devoid of cytokines may be a possible indicator that cartilage is more at risk of becoming pathologic after joint injury."

We estimated the predicted days incarcerated in a national US sample of Black, Latino/Latina, and American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) individuals. Methods We used the 2012–2013 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (n = 14,728) to identify individual incarceration history. We used zero-inflated Poisson regression to predict the number of days incarcerated across racial discrimination and racial identity scores. Results Racial discrimination and identity varied between races/ethnicities, such that racial discrimination exposure was highest among Hispanic individuals, while racial identity was highest among Black individuals. Racial discrimination was positively associated with days incarcerated among Black individuals ( β = 0.070, p&lt;0.0001) and AI/AN individuals ( β = 0.174, p&lt;0.000). Racial identity was negatively associated with days incarcerated among Black individuals ( β = -0.147, p&lt;0.0001). The predicted number of days incarcerated was highest among Black individuals (130 days) with high discrimination scores. Conclusion Racial discrimination and racial identity were associated with days incarcerated, and the association varied by racial/ethnic sub-group. Informed by these findings, we suggest that intervention strategies targeting incarceration prevention should be tailored to the unique experiences of racial/ethnic minoritized individuals at the greatest risk. Policies aimed at reversing mass incarceration should consider how carceral systems fit within the wider contexts of historical racism, discrimination, and structural determinants of health."
https://openalex.org/W4285506099,"Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Tie2, also known as Tunica interna Endothelial cell Kinase or TEK plays a prominent role in endothelial responses to angiogenic and inflammatory stimuli. Here we generated a novel inducible Tie2 knockout mouse model, which targets mature (micro)vascular endothelium, enabling the study of the organ-specific contribution of Tie2 to these responses. Mice with floxed Tie2 exon 9 alleles (Tie2floxed/floxed) were crossed with end-SCL-Cre-ERT transgenic mice, generating offspring in which Tie2 exon 9 is deleted in the endothelial compartment upon tamoxifen-induced activation of Cre-recombinase (Tie2ΔE9). Successful deletion of Tie2 exon 9 in kidney, lung, heart, aorta, and liver, was accompanied by a heterogeneous, organ-dependent reduction in Tie2 mRNA and protein expression. Microvascular compartment-specific reduction in Tie2 mRNA and protein occurred in arterioles of all studied organs, in renal glomeruli, and in lung capillaries. In kidney, lung, and heart, reduced Tie2 expression was accompanied by a reduction in Tie1 mRNA expression. The heterogeneous, organ- and microvascular compartment-dependent knockout pattern of Tie2 in the Tie2floxed/floxed;end-SCL-Cre-ERT mouse model suggests that future studies using similar knockout strategies should include a meticulous analysis of the knockout extent of the gene of interest, prior to studying its role in pathological conditions, so that proper conclusions can be drawn."

The new generation of direct-acting antivirals has improved dramatically the rates of cure for chronic hepatitis C. Yet, evidence shows that racial groups are deemed more often ineligible for hepatitis C treatment, despite no clinical evidence supporting differential treatment for Black and White patients. One possible explanation has to do with providers' racial biases. This investigation sought to explore medical students' racial stereotypes (Study 1, N = 171) and the role of stereotypical cues on perceptions of medical adherence of Black and White patients (Study 2, N = 208). In Study 1, we first sought to identify health-related aspects that are consistently associated with Blacks as part of a stereotype. In Study 2, we experimentally manipulated racial stereotypes identified in Study 1 by asking participants to read a clinical vignette depicting a patient (Black vs. White) and their medical history (cause of exposure to hepatitis C: unprotected sex vs. non-injectable drugs use). The results show that the impact of stereotypicality on patient perceived compliance varies as a function of medical students' racial prejudice. Implications for further applied health inequalities research and for medical training are discussed."
https://openalex.org/W4285506613,"One of the core tenets of a well-functioning representative democracy is that the people who vote to elect government officials are representative of the public. Here we reinforce the idea that reality is far from this lofty ideal. We document the extent and nature of inequities in voter participation in the United States with a level of granularity and precision that previous research has not afforded. To do so, we use a unique nationwide dataset of approximately 400 million validated voting records across multiple election cycles. With this novel dataset, we document large and persistent gaps in voter turnout by race, age, and political affiliation. Minority citizens, young people, and those who support the Democratic Party are much less likely to vote than whites, older citizens, and Republican Party supporters. Minorities, youth, and democrats are also much more likely to live in local communities where fewer individuals vote-areas that we term turnout deserts. Turnout deserts are especially pernicious given that they are self-reinforcing-bolstered by the social dynamics that fundamentally shape citizens' voting patterns. Our results show just how glaring inequities in political participation are in the US. These patterns threaten the very fabric of our democracy and fundamentally shift the balance of political power in the halls of government towards the interests of whites, older citizens, and republicans. They illustrate that participation in the United States is strikingly unequal-far from the ideals that this country has long aspired to."
https://openalex.org/W4285613983,"Background Exposure to trauma can result in various mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies exist for the treatment of these disorders, many individuals fail to receive treatment and among those who do, many remain symptomatic. Therefore, it is critical to continue developing new interventions for traumatic stress that target underlying mechanisms of pathology and offer a safe and acceptable alternative to current treatments. Morning light treatment has good potential as a novel non-invasive, low risk treatment for traumatic stress. Evidence suggests that morning light may improve traumatic stress by reducing reactivity in the amygdala, a brain region implicated in the pathophysiology of PTSD and anatomically linked to circadian photoreceptors in the eye. Methods In this study, we aim to establish a significant dose-response relationship between duration of morning light treatment and reduction in amygdala reactivity among individuals with traumatic stress symptoms (NCT# 04117347). Using a transdiagnostic approach, sixty-six individuals with a history of a DSM-5 criterion A trauma and traumatic stress symptoms will be recruited to participate in a 5-week study. Participants will be randomized across three treatment arms based on morning light treatment duration: 15-minutes, 30-minutes, or 60-minutes of light treatment per day for four weeks. To evaluate amygdala activity, participants will undergo fMRI at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. Participants will also complete clinical assessments and self-report measures of PTSD, depression, and anxiety at pre-treatment, mid-treatment, and post-treatment. Discussion Morning light therapy may be an acceptable, feasible, and effective treatment for individuals suffering from traumatic stress. Identifying mechanistically relevant targets, and the doses needed to impact them, are critical steps in developing this new treatment approach for the sequelae of traumatic stress."
https://openalex.org/W4285684447,"Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a common type of kidney cancer with a high mortality rate, and the discovery of new therapeutic markers is essential to improve patient survival. The plasminogen activator urokinase receptor (PLAUR) plays key roles in tissue remodeling and extracellular matrix degradation, which contribute to invasion and metastasis, a major feature of tumor malignancy. The role of PLAUR in ccRCC pathology has not been deeply studied. In this study, we collected the mRNA expression data of 33 tumor types, each derived from human patients obtained from TCGA database, and comprehensively analyzed the correlation between the expression of PLAUR in tumors and prognosis. Then, we studied the relationship between PLAUR expression in ccRCC and specific clinical features of ccRCC patients. In addition, we analyzed the function and mechanism of PLAUR in ccRCC. Our results showed that PLAUR was significantly overexpressed in ccRCC and that both PLAUR levels and PLAUR methylation levels significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Our results also suggest that PLAUR is involved in the progression of ccRCC. The results of functional and mechanistic analysis of PLAUR showed that PLAUR is involved in inflammatory and immune-related pathways in ccRCC; other data showed that PLAUR expression may affect the infiltration of multiple immune cell types in ccRCC and that PLAUR levels were significantly and positively correlated with the expression of immune checkpoints. In conclusion, our findings suggest that high PLAUR expression can promote the progression of ccRCC to poor prognosis, and thus PLAUR may serve as both a potential marker for predicting macrophage infiltration and immune microenvironment status and as an important immunotherapy target for ccRCC."
https://openalex.org/W4285684564,"Clinical targeting of the altered metabolism of tumor cells has long been considered an attractive hypothetical approach. However, this strategy has yet to perform well clinically. Metabolic redundancy is among the limitations on effectiveness of many approaches, engendering intrinsic single-agent resistance or efficient evolution of such resistance. We describe new studies of the multi-target, tumor-preferential inhibition of the mitochondrial tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle by the first-in-class drug CPI-613® (devimistat). By suppressing the TCA hub, indispensable to many metabolic pathways, CPI-613 substantially reduces the effective redundancy of tumor catabolism. This TCA cycle suppression also engenders an apparently homeostatic accelerated, inefficient consumption of nutrient stores in carcinoma cells, eroding some sources of drug resistance. Nonetheless, sufficiently abundant, cell line-specific lipid stores in carcinoma cells are among remaining sources of CPI-613 resistance in vitro and during the in vivo pharmacological drug pulse. Specifically, the fatty acid beta-oxidation step delivers electrons directly to the mitochondrial electron transport system (ETC), by-passing the TCA cycle CPI-613 target and producing drug resistance. Strikingly, tested carcinoma cell lines configure much of this fatty acid flow to initially traverse the peroxisome enroute to additional mitochondrial beta-oxidation. This feature facilitates targeting as clinically practical agents disrupting this flow are available. Two such agents significantly sensitize an otherwise fully CPI-613-resistant carcinoma xenograft in vivo . These and related results are strong empirical support for a potentially general class of strategies for enhanced clinical targeting of carcinoma catabolism."
https://openalex.org/W4285685548,"Although a wide range of literature has investigated the network-level highway maintenance plans and policies, few of them focused on the maintenance scheduling problem. This study proposes a methodology framework to model and compare two different maintenance scheduling strategies for highway networks, i.e., minimal makespan strategy (MMS) and minimal increased travel delay strategy (MITDS). We formulate MMS as a mixed integer linear programming model subject to the constraints of the quantity of manpower and the worst-first maintenance sequence. A bi-level programming model is proposed to quantify and optimize MITDS. The upper level model determines the optimal scheduling to minimize the increased traffic delays during the maintenance makespan. In the lower level, a modified day-to-day traffic assignment model is put forward to reflect the traffic evolution dynamics by simulating travelers' route choice behaviors. A simulated annealing algorithm and augmented Lagrange algorithm are employed to solve the two proposed models, respectively. Finally, a numerical example using a highway network is developed. The two proposed strategies are tested considering different traffic demands, numbers of engineering teams, and travelers' sensitivities to traffic congestion. The experiment results reveal that compared with MMS, MITDS extends makespan by 2 days though, it reduces the total increased travel delays by 4% and both MMS and MITDS can obtain the minimum total increased travel delays when the number of engineering teams is 6. The sensitivity analysis indicates that both the two strategies have the maximum and minimum total increased travel delays when the weight of prediction in travelers' perception is 0.3 and 0.7, respectively. The proposed framework has the potential to provide reference in implementing highway maintenance activities reasonably."
https://openalex.org/W4285742081,"Studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron-emission tomography suggest that many regions of the brain are activated by such complex muscle activity. Although these studies demonstrated relative increases in blood flow in some brain regions with increased neural activity, whether or not the absolute value of cerebral blood flow increases has yet to be elucidated. It also remains unknown whether playing musical instruments affects cerebral blood flow. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of playing a musical instrument on blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (MCAv) by using Doppler ultrasound to measure absolute values of arterial flow velocity.Thirteen musicians performed three pieces of music with different levels of difficulty: play for the first time (FS), music in practice (PR) and already mastered (MS) on either piano or violin. MCAv was recorded continuously from 10 min before until 10 min after playing. Associations between the cerebral blood flow response and blood pressure and gas-exchange variables were examined.PR and MS significantly increased the MCAv. The blood pressure increased significantly in performances of all difficulty levels except for MS. There were no significant changes in exhaled gas variables during the performance.These findings suggest that playing a musical instrument increases MCAv, and that this change is influenced by the difficulty of the performance."
https://openalex.org/W4281706684,"While a deficit in the recognition of facial expression has been demonstrated in persons with antisocial personality disorder (ASPD), few studies have investigated how individuals with ASPD produce their own emotional facial expressions. This study examines the production of facial emotional expressions of male inpatients with ASPD in a forensic hospital compared with a control group as they retrieve autobiographical memories. This design constitutes a specific ecological experimental approach fostering the evocation of personal feelings. Two indicators characterizing the activation of facial expression were used: activation of emotional action units and emotional dominance. The results showed that individuals with ASPD 1) activated angrier facial expressions than control participants for both indicators, 2) displayed a higher dominance of angry facial expressions during the retrieval of positive self-defining memories than control participants and 3) recalled significant memories that were less associated with neutral facial states than the control sample, regardless of the valence of their memories. These findings highlight the core role of anger in ASPD and the possible development of pathological anger, which would distinguish trajectories toward anxious or mood disorders and trajectories characterized by external disorders."

https://openalex.org/W4285506063,"Proper respiratory tract protection is the key factor to limiting the rate of COVID-19 spread and providing a safe environment for health care workers. Traditional N95 (FFP2) respirators are not easy to regenerate and thus create certain financial and ecological burdens; moreover, their quality may vary significantly. A solution that would overcome these disadvantages is desirable. In this study a commercially available knit polyester fleece fabric was selected as the filter material, and a total of 25 filters of different areas and thicknesses were prepared. Then, the size-resolved filtration efficiency (40–400 nm) and pressure drop were evaluated at a volumetric flow rate of 95 L/min. We showed the excellent synergistic effect of expanding the filtration area and increasing the number of filtering layers on the filtration efficiency; a filter cartridge with 8 layers of knit polyester fabric with a surface area of 900 cm 2 and sized 25 × 14 × 8 cm achieved filtration efficiencies of 98% at 95 L/min and 99.5% at 30 L/min. The assembled filter kit consists of a filter cartridge (14 Pa) carried in a small backpack connected to a half mask with a total pressure drop of 84 Pa at 95 L/min. In addition, it is reusable, and the filter material can be regenerated at least ten times by simple methods, such as boiling. We have demonstrated a novel approach for creating high-quality and easy-to-breathe-through respiratory protective equipment that reduces operating costs and is a green solution because it is easy to regenerate."
https://openalex.org/W4285506137,"Objectives To determine the psychometric validity, using Rasch analysis, of summing the three constituent parts of the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS). Design National (registry-based) retrospective study. Setting England and Wales. Patients All individuals who sustained a traumatic injury and were: admitted for more than three days; required critical care resources; transferred for specialist management; or who died from their injuries. Main outcomes and measures Demographic information (i.e., age at time of injury, and sex), item sub-scores of the first available GCS (either completed by the attending paramedics or on arrival to hospital), injury severity as denoted by the Injury Severity Scale (ISS), and outcome (survival to hospital discharge or 30-days post-injury, whichever is earliest). Results 321,203 cases between 2008 and 2017. 55.9% were male, the median age was 62.7 years (IQR 44.2–80.8), the median ISS was 9 (IQR 9 to 17), and 6.6% were deceased at 30 days. The reliability statistics suggest that when the extreme scores (i.e. 3 and 15) are accounted for, that there is only sufficient consistency to support the separation of injuries into 3 broad categories, e.g. mild, moderate and severe. As extreme scores don’t impact Rasch item calibrations, subsequent analysis was restricted to the 48,417 non-extreme unique cases. Overall fit to the Rasch model was poor across all analyses (p &lt; 0.0001). Through a combination of empirical evidence and clinical reasoning, item response categories were collapsed to provide a post-hoc scoring amendment. Whilst the modifications improved the function of the individual items, there is little evidence to support them meaningfully contributing to a total score that can be interpreted on an interval scale. Conclusion and relevance The GCS does not perform in a psychometrically robust manner in a national retrospective cohort of individuals who have experienced a traumatic injury, even after post-hoc correction."
https://openalex.org/W4285506627,"The exploitation of non-timber forest products may be an opportunity to reconcile the utilization of biological resources with biodiversity conservation. In Southern Brazil, the exploitation of liana stems for handicraft makes up an important part of the income of indigenous Kaingang people. In this study we evaluated the effects of stem harvesting on the survivorship of Forsteronia glabrescens Müll.Arg, the most exploited liana species in the region. We marked and monitored the survivorship, sprouting, changes in stem diameter and resource yield in control and harvested plots with two different resting times–six and twelve months. We associated variables of interest with individual attributes, harvesting regime and vegetation descriptors through linear mixed modelling. Survivorship and resource yield were lower in the harvested groups than in the control group, although the mean stem diameter was higher. Plants with larger stem diameter presented higher survival odds. Either six or twelve months of resting between harvests were not sufficient to recompose the yield and compensate mortality. Harvesting twice a year increases yield but reduces survivorship. Our results point that the sustainable exploitation of F . glabrescens require either large areas, low pressure or resting periods longer than the ones we tested."
https://openalex.org/W4285507361,"In implant treatment, primary stability and osseointegration are improved by continual intermittent administration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) in patients with osteoporosis. However, the histological and histomorphometric aspects are not clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the histological and histomorphometric effects of intermittent PTH administration on osseointegration in a glucocorticoid-induced osteoporotic rabbit model. Fifteen female New Zealand rabbits were prepared for the osteoporosis model with ovariectomy and glucocorticoid administration. After 1 week, five rabbits were intermittently administered PTH for 8 weeks until the end point (PTHa group) and five for 4 weeks until implant placement (PTHb group). The remaining rabbits were intermittently administered saline for 8 weeks until the end point (Control group). Dental implants were inserted into the femoral epiphyses 11 weeks after ovariectomy. After 4 weeks, the maximum removal torque (RT) of the placed implant and bone implant contact (BIC) ratio were evaluated. In addition micro-computed tomography and histomorphometric analyses were performed. The RT and BIC values were significantly higher in the PTHa group compared with those of the PTHb and Control groups (p&lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the bone mineral densities and Hounsfield units were significantly higher in the PTHa group than those in the PTHb and Control groups. Histologic and histomorphometric measurements revealed that continuous administration of PTH improved bone density and bone formation around the implant placement site, as well as systemic bone formation. Therefore, favorable implant stability was achieved under osteoporosis."
https://openalex.org/W4285507477,"Determining the genetic consequences of both historical and contemporary events can clarify the effects of the environment on population connectivity and inform conservation decisions. Historical events (like glaciations) and contemporary factors (like logging) can disrupt gene flow between populations. This is especially true among species with specialized ecological requirements and low dispersal ability, like amphibians. We test for the genetic consequences of historical and contemporary disturbances in the coastal giant salamander ( Dicamptodon tenebrosus ) in the Pacific Northwest of the United States. We consider predictions based on the contemporary landscape (habitat connectivity, logging, forest fires, and topography), in addition to relatively ancient post-Pleistocene range expansion (following the last glacial retreat). To assess local versus larger-scale effects, we sampled 318 individuals across 23 sites, which were clustered in five sampling regions. Genetic variation was assessed using five microsatellite markers. We found evidence of (i) historical regional isolation, with decreased genetic diversity among more recently colonized northern sites, as well as (ii) high levels of inbreeding and loss of heterozygosity at local scales, despite relatively low overall population differentiation ( F ST ) or strong evidence for population bottlenecks. Genetic diversity was not associated with contemporary disturbances (logging or fire), and there were no detectable effects on the genetic connectivity of populations based on intervening landscape features (habitat fragmentation and topography). However, lower genetic diversity in more northern regions indicates a lag in recovery of genetic diversity following post-Pleistocene expansion. Additionally, some populations had evidence of having undergone a recent genetic bottleneck or had high inbreeding ( F IS ) values. Lower genetic diversity in more northern sites means populations may be more vulnerable to future environmental changes, and managing for connectivity alone may not be sufficient given low mobility. Recent apparent reductions in some populations were not clearly linked to anthropogenic disturbances we examined. This suggests the type of disturbances this species is sensitive to may not be well understood."
https://openalex.org/W4285612399,"We investigate the impact of anthropogenic noise on the foraging efficiency of leafcutter ants (Acromyrmex octospinosus) in a controlled laboratory experiment. Anthropogenic noise is a widespread, pervasive and increasing environmental pollutant and its negative impacts on animal fitness and behaviour have been well documented. Much of this evidence has come from studies concerning vertebrate species with very little evidence for terrestrial invertebrates, especially social living invertebrates. We compare movement speed, forage fragment size, and colony activity levels of ants exposed to intermittent elevated noise and in ambient noise conditions. We use intermittent and temporally unpredictable bursts of white noise produced from a vibration speaker to create the elevated noise profile. Ant movement speed increased under elevated noise conditions when travelling to collect forage material and when returning to the colony nest. The size of individually measured foraged material was significantly reduced under elevated noise conditions. Colony activity, the number of ants moving along the forage route, was not affected by elevated noise and was consistent throughout the foraging events. Increased foraging speed and smaller forage fragments suggests that the ants had to make more foraging trips over an extended period, which is likely to affect energy expenditure and increases exposure to predators. This is likely to have significant fitness impacts for the colony over time."

https://openalex.org/W4285613328,"Fisheries harvest strategies are formal frameworks that represent a best-practice approach for sustainable fisheries management. A key component of a harvest strategy is a 'pre-agreed rule', known as a harvest control rule (HCR), that sets fishing opportunities, e.g. catch limits, based on an estimate of fish stock status, e.g. estimated stock biomass. The harvest strategy development process is driven by stakeholders who are required to make a range of informed decisions, including on the selection of the preferred HCR. Capacity building may be required to facilitate the stakeholder engagement, particularly regarding the technical components of harvest strategies, including HCRs. The AMPLE package for R provides three interactive apps that support capacity building and stakeholder engagement on HCRs. These apps have been used during in-country national workshops around the western and central Pacific Ocean (WCPO) to support the development of harvest strategies for the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission. These apps include several novel features: they take users from a gentle introduction to how HCRs work, to using methods for testing, comparing and selecting a preferred HCR from a suite of candidates. They include an introduction to the impact of uncertainty on the performance of an HCR, introduce performance indicators and discuss methods for selecting the preferred HCR based on management objectives. As such they provide a more detailed overview of HCRs than currently existing alternatives. These apps provide an effective platform for hands-on learning and have proven to be successful at supporting capacity building on HCRs in the WCPO. For example, using them for group activities and competitions stimulated productive discussions and increased understanding. As the model fishery in AMPLE is generic and not based on a real example, the apps will also be of interest to scientists, managers and stakeholders developing harvest strategies in other regions."

A quality improvement (QI) approach was used to improve VL testing coverage from 27% to a target of 80% at an urban health facility in Malawi.A QI study employing a time-series quasi-experimental design with no comparison group was conducted at Chilomoni health centre in Blantyre from April 2020 to July 2020. A retrospective record review of all patient records (257) from 8 weeks before the study was conducted to determine baseline VL testing coverage. Root cause analysis of low VL testing coverage was done using fish-bone tool and factors prioritized using a Pareto-chart. Priority factors included inadequate capacity to update electronic medical records and competing tasks. Change ideas were identified and prioritized using an effort-impact matrix. Two change ideas; re-orienting ART providers on VL test order in EMR and dedicated ART provider to serve VL tested patients were implemented and tested in 5 Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles from the Model for Improvement (MFI), each lasting one week. The latter was tested, and adapted in 3 cycles, and eventually adopted for monitoring for another 5 weeks. VL testing coverage was tracked throughout the study using run charts and p-charts.VL testing coverage increased from 27% to 71% by the end of the study, with children aged 0 to 14 years having the lowest coverage throughout the study.The MFI as a QI approach improved VL testing coverage through implementation of contextualized change ideas. A reliable data system, leadership buy-in and commitment are important for sustained improvement. Future research should focus on evaluating sustainability of improved VL testing coverage at the health facility and assessing barriers to VL testing among the paediatric population."
https://openalex.org/W4285613824,"Purpose To develop and validate a case-finding algorithm for the identification of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) cases in a region-wide Italian pathology registry (PR). Materials and methods Data collected between 2009 and 2017 in the PR and the Pharmacy Database of the University Hospital of Siena and the PR of Tuscany region were used. A NSCLC-identification algorithm based on free-text keywords and SNOMED morphology and topography codes was designed and tested on data from Siena: indication for drug use (i.e. NSCLC) was the reference standard for sensitivity (SE); positive predictive value (PPV) was estimated through manual review. Algorithm modifications were then tested to improve algorithm performance: PPV was calculated against validated dataset from PR of Siena; a range of SE [min-max] was estimated in PR of Tuscany using analytical formulae that assumed NSCLC incidence equal either to 80% or 90% of overall lung cancer incidence recorded in Tuscany. The algorithm modification with the best performance was chosen as the final version of the algorithm. A random sample of 200 cases was extracted from the PR of Tuscany for manual review. Results The first version of the algorithm showed a PPV of 74.7% and SE of 79% in PR of Siena. The final version of the algorithm had a SE in PR of Tuscany that grew with calendar time (2009 = [24.7%-28%]; 2017 = [57.9%-65.1%]) and a PPV of 93%. Conclusions The final NSCLC-finding algorithm showed with very high PPV. SE was in line with the expected contribution of PR to overall cases captured in the regional Cancer Registry, with a trend of increase over calendar time. Given the promising algorithm validity and the wide use of SNOMED terminology in electronic pathology records, the proposed algorithm is expected to be easily adapted to other electronic databases for (pharmaco)epidemiology purposes."

This can be a challenging task for cochlear implant (CIs) users who receive degraded suprasegmental information important for perceiving a speaker’s attitude. We measured the perception of speaker sincerity (literal positive, literal negative, sarcasm, and teasing) in 16 adults with CIs using an established video inventory. Participants were presented with audio-only and audio-visual social interactions between two people with and without supporting verbal context. They were instructed to describe the content of the conversation and answer whether the speakers meant what they said. Results showed that subjects could not always identify speaker sincerity, even when the content of the conversation was perfectly understood. This deficit was greater for perceiving insincere relative to sincere utterances. Performance improved when additional visual cues or verbal context cues were provided. Subjects who were better at perceiving the content of the interactions in the audio-only condition benefited more from having additional visual cues for judging the speaker’s sincerity, suggesting that the two modalities compete for cognitive recourses. Perception of content also did not correlate with perception of speaker sincerity, suggesting that what was said vs. how it was said were perceived using unrelated segmental versus suprasegmental cues. Our results further showed that subjects who had access to lower-order resolved harmonic information provided by hearing aids in the contralateral ear identified speaker sincerity better than those who used implants alone. These results suggest that measuring speech recognition alone in CI users does not fully describe the outcome. Our findings stress the importance of measuring social communication functions in people with CIs."

This is a descriptive study, with secondary data from the Hospital Information System of the Unified Health System (SIH/SUS). Hospital admissions, deaths and mortality rate due to CVD in the Brazilian population aged over 20 years were analyzed, according to region, sex and age group.

Data normality was assessed using the Komogorov Smirnov test and the comparison between groups and year periods was performed using the two-way ANOVA test with Tukey’s post hoc test. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered significant. In this study, in most analyses, a reduction in the hospitalization rates of the adult population was observed after the implementation of the plan, however, there was no improvement in relation to the number of deaths and mortality rate from CVD. This shows that there is still a long way to go to reduce the impact of these diseases in Brazil, and they reaffirm the need for and importance of maintaining the prevention of their risk factors, the social determinants of health and the reorganization of care in the face of to population aging. Such findings contribute with information that allow better control and monitoring of CVD and should be considered when implementing new strategies for prevention, care and control of risk factors."

The ubiquitous nature of RNRs necessitates multiple RNR classes that differ from each other in terms of the phosphorylation state of the ribonucleotide substrates, oxygen tolerance, and the nature of both the metallocofactor employed and the reducing systems. Although these differences allow RNRs to produce deoxyribonucleotides needed for DNA biosynthesis under a wide range of environmental conditions, they also present a challenge for establishment of a universal activity assay. Additionally, many current RNR assays are limited in that they only follow the conversion of one ribonucleotide substrate at a time, but in the cell, all four ribonucleotides are actively being converted into deoxyribonucleotide products as dictated by the cellular concentrations of allosteric specificity effectors. Here, we present a liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based assay that can determine the activity of both aerobic and anaerobic RNRs on any combination of substrates using any combination of allosteric effectors. We demonstrate that this assay generates activity data similar to past published results with the canonical Escherichia coli aerobic class Ia RNR. We also show that this assay can be used for an anaerobic class III RNR that employs formate as the reductant, i.e. Streptococcus thermophilus RNR. We further show that this class III RNR is allosterically regulated by dATP and ATP. Lastly, we present activity data for the simultaneous reduction of all four ribonucleotide substrates by the E. coli class Ia RNR under various combinations of allosteric specificity effectors. This validated LC-MS/MS assay is higher throughput and more versatile than the historically established radioactive activity and coupled RNR activity assays as well as a number of the published HPLC-based assays. The presented assay will allow for the study of a wide range of RNR enzymes under a wide range of conditions, facilitating the study of previously uncharacterized RNRs."
https://openalex.org/W4285685621,"Background The management of patients’ holistic symptom needs are often complex and challenging. The education needs of undergraduate nursing students must be optimally addressed to have a significant positive impact on patient care. Mobile spaced learning has been recognised as a form of online education which can provide a novel approach to delivering effective evidence based healthcare education to undergraduate students. Objective The objective of this pilot study was to explore the experiences of undergraduate nursing students in a university setting, of using mobile spaced learning as a digital platform for symptom management education. Method This pilot study used a mixed methods approach. Online spaced learning material, which utilised both case based scenarios and multiple choice questions, was delivered to first year undergraduate nursing students over a period of 2 weeks. Participants were then invited to participate in an online survey related to the usability of mobile spaced learning. A focus group was conducted to further explore the participants’ views. Result Findings conveyed that students viewed mobile spaced learning as an acceptable platform that enhanced both their learning and their ability to transfer knowledge into clinical practice. Conclusion Implementation of a digital spaced learning intervention would be acceptable to undergraduate nursing students learning about holistic symptom management. Further research is needed to explore the feasibility of implementing this intervention within the undergraduate nursing curriculum, and also to explore the impact on long-term knowledge retention."
https://openalex.org/W4285742300,"Sex workers may use Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as a means to mitigate occupational health and safety (OHS) risks by exchanging harm reduction techniques (e.g., screening) on blogs and social media. ICTs can also assist sex workers in creating online communities, where community members can act as each other’s safety check-ins, an additional harm reduction technique. In Canada, there is a paucity of research around ICT usage by sex workers for managing occupational health and safety. The objective of this study was to qualitatively examine the needs and preferences of Canadian sex workers when using ICTs in the delivery of strategies for occupational health and safety. Using a theoretical framework derived from a Social Ecological Model perspective, semi-structured interviews were conducted via phone, with a mixed gender sample (N = 22) of sex workers, between April and July 2020. OHS risks were found to be related to structural determinants, client behaviours, and lack of experience and knowledge when newly entering sex work. Participant accounts revealed a socially cohesive online community; however, sex workers reported difficulties in finding these communities, particularly when entering sex work. Such barriers to supportive communities were attributed to the criminalized, hidden nature of sex work that resulted in the fragmentation of harm reduction techniques across several online platforms, such as blogs, YouTube videos, closed electronic chat groups, and open online sex worker supportive communities. Moreover, these platforms and/or their content could potentially disappear without warning, either due to the platform provider seeking to evade possible prosecution, or because new legislation was introduced banning such content. Recommendations for further research include the co-design with sex workers of an innovative, secure, easily accessible, sex worker-only ICT OHS tool, utilizing a web hosting service located in a country where sex work has been either legalized or decriminalized."
https://openalex.org/W4285744986,"The concept of professional judgement underpins the way in which an occupational hygienist assesses an exposure problem. Despite the importance placed on professional judgement in the discipline, a method of assessment to characterise accuracy has not been available. In this paper, we assess the professional judgement of four occupational hygienists (‘experts’) when completing exposure assessments on a range of airborne contaminants across a number of job roles within a surface mining environment in the Pilbara region of Western Australia. The job roles assessed were project driller, mobile equipment operator, fixed plant maintainer, and drill and blast operator. The contaminants of interest were respirable crystalline silica, respirable dust, and inhalable dust. The novel approach of eliciting exposure estimates focusing on contaminant concentration and attribution of an exposure standard estimate was used. The majority of the elicited values were highly skewed; therefore, a scaled Beta distribution were fitted. These elicited fitted distributions were then compared to measured data distributions, the results of which had been collected as part of an occupational hygiene program assessing full-shift exposures to the same contaminants and job roles assessed by the experts. Our findings suggest that the participating experts within this study tended to overestimate exposures. In addition, the participating experts were more accurate at estimating percentage of an exposure standard than contaminant concentration. We demonstrate that this elicitation approach and the encoding methodology contained within can be applied to assess accuracy of exposure judgements which will impact on worker protection and occupational health outcomes."
