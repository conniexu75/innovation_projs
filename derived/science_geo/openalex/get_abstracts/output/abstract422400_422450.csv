https://openalex.org/W2008954479,"BAP1 has been shown to be a target of both somatic alteration in high-risk ocular melanomas (OM) and germline inactivation in a few individuals from cancer-prone families. These findings suggest that constitutional BAP1 changes may predispose individuals to metastatic OM and that familial permeation of deleterious alleles could delineate a new cancer syndrome.To characterize BAP1's contribution to melanoma risk, we sequenced BAP1 in a set of 100 patients with OM, including 50 metastatic OM cases and 50 matched non-metastatic OM controls, and 200 individuals with cutaneous melanoma (CM) including 7 CM patients from CM-OM families and 193 CM patients from CM-non-OM kindreds.Germline BAP1 mutations were detected in 4/50 patients with metastatic OM and 0/50 cases of non-metastatic OM (8% vs. 0%, p = 0.059). Since 2/4 of the BAP1 carriers reported a family history of CM, we analyzed 200 additional hereditary CM patients and found mutations in 2/7 CM probands from CM-OM families and 1/193 probands from CM-non-OM kindreds (29% vs. 0.52%, p = .003). Germline mutations co-segregated with both CM and OM phenotypes and were associated with the presence of unique nevoid melanomas and highly atypical nevoid melanoma-like melanocytic proliferations (NEMMPs). Interestingly, 7/14 germline variants identified to date reside in C-terminus suggesting that the BRCA1 binding domain is important in cancer predisposition.Germline BAP1 mutations are associated with a more aggressive OM phenotype and a recurrent phenotypic complex of cutaneous/ocular melanoma, atypical melanocytic proliferations and other internal neoplasms (ie. COMMON syndrome), which could be a useful clinical marker for constitutive BAP1 inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W2100989340,"Matrix metalloproteinases (Mmps) stimulate tumor invasion and metastasis by degrading the extracellular matrix. Here we reveal an unexpected role for Mmp10 (stromelysin 2) in the maintenance and tumorigenicity of mouse lung cancer stem-like cells (CSC). Mmp10 is highly expressed in oncosphere cultures enriched in CSCs and RNAi-mediated knockdown of Mmp10 leads to a loss of stem cell marker gene expression and inhibition of oncosphere growth, clonal expansion, and transformed growth in vitro. Interestingly, clonal expansion of Mmp10 deficient oncospheres can be restored by addition of exogenous Mmp10 protein to the culture medium, demonstrating a direct role for Mmp10 in the proliferation of these cells. Oncospheres exhibit enhanced tumor-initiating and metastatic activity when injected orthotopically into syngeneic mice, whereas Mmp10-deficient cultures show a severe defect in tumor initiation. Conversely, oncospheres implanted into syngeneic non-transgenic or Mmp10(-/-) mice show no significant difference in tumor initiation, growth or metastasis, demonstrating the importance of Mmp10 produced by cancer cells rather than the tumor microenvironment in lung tumor initiation and maintenance. Analysis of gene expression data from human cancers reveals a strong positive correlation between tumor Mmp10 expression and metastatic behavior in many human tumor types. Thus, Mmp10 is required for maintenance of a highly tumorigenic, cancer-initiating, metastatic stem-like cell population in lung cancer. Our data demonstrate for the first time that Mmp10 is a critical lung cancer stem cell gene and novel therapeutic target for lung cancer stem cells."
https://openalex.org/W2040435987,"GABA inhibits mature neurons and conversely excites immature neurons due to lower K(+)-Cl(-) cotransporter 2 (KCC2) expression. We observed that ectopically expressed KCC2 in embryonic cerebral cortices was not active; however, KCC2 functioned in newborns. In vitro studies revealed that taurine increased KCC2 inactivation in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. When Thr-906 and Thr-1007 residues in KCC2 were substituted with Ala (KCC2T906A/T1007A), KCC2 activity was facilitated, and the inhibitory effect of taurine was not observed. Exogenous taurine activated the with-no-lysine protein kinase 1 (WNK1) and downstream STE20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase (SPAK)/oxidative stress response 1 (OSR1), and overexpression of active WNK1 resulted in KCC2 inhibition in the absence of taurine. Phosphorylation of SPAK was consistently higher in embryonic brains compared with that of neonatal brains and down-regulated by a taurine transporter inhibitor in vivo. Furthermore, cerebral radial migration was perturbed by a taurine-insensitive form of KCC2, KCC2T906A/T1007A, which may be regulated by WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling. Thus, taurine and WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling may contribute to embryonic neuronal Cl(-) homeostasis, which is required for normal brain development."

Aberrant aPKC activity disrupts polarity, yet the mechanisms that control aPKC remain poorly understood. We used a reconstituted system with purified components and a cultured cell cortical displacement assay to investigate aPKC regulation. We find that aPKC is autoinhibited by two domains within its NH2-terminal regulatory half, a pseudosubstrate motif that occupies the kinase active site, and a C1 domain that assists in this process. The Par complex member Par-6, previously thought to inhibit aPKC, is a potent activator of aPKC in our assays. Par-6 and aPKC interact via PB1 domain heterodimerization, and this interaction activates aPKC by displacing the pseudosubstrate, although full activity requires the Par-6 CRIB-PDZ domains. We propose that, along with its previously described roles in controlling aPKC localization, Par-6 allosterically activates aPKC to allow for high spatial and temporal control of substrate phosphorylation and polarization.

Through mechanisms that are still being elucidated, the Par complex becomes polarized to one cortical domain and keeps other, cell type-specific factors, localized to an opposite cortical domain (10Prehoda K.E.

The activity of aPKC is a key output of the Par complex because the association of substrates with the cortex can be modulated by phosphorylation (7Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A.

McGlade C.J. aPKC-mediated phosphorylation regulates asymmetric membrane localization of the cell fate determinant Numb.EMBO J. 2007; 26: 468-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (171) Google Scholar). For example, in Drosophila neuroblasts the protein Miranda localizes to a cortical domain opposite the Par complex, and its polarization requires aPKC activity (8Atwood S.X. Prehoda K.E. aPKC phosphorylates Miranda to polarize fate determinants during neuroblast asymmetric cell division.Curr. Biol. 2009; 19: 723-729Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). Miranda associates with the cortex via its cortical localization domain, but once this domain is phosphorylated by aPKC it is released into the cytoplasm leading to their mutually exclusive localization. Cortical association of the protein Numb is also modulated by aPKC phosphorylation, both in Drosophila and polarized mammalian cells (9Smith C.A. Lau K.M. Rahmani Z. Dho S.E. Brothers G. She Y.M.

That activity of aPKC must be maintained within a certain range. In humans, inappropriate aPKC activity is associated with epithelial tumors (5Eder A.M. Sui X. Rosen D.G. Nolden L.K. Cheng K.W.

Ectopic aPKC activity in neuroblasts leads to massive overproliferation and concomitant loss of differentiated cells (4Lee C.Y. Robinson K.J. Doe C.Q. Lgl, Pins and aPKC regulate neuroblast self-renewal versus differentiation.Nature. 2006; 439: 594-598Crossref PubMed Scopus (252) Google Scholar). In current models, aPKC activity is controlled by a complex set of protein-protein “scaffolding” interactions (11Knoblich J.A. Asymmetric cell division: recent developments and their implications for tumour biology.Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2010; 11: 849-860Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 13Rosse C. Linch M.

In particular, Par-6 is thought to repress aPKC (7Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A.

PAR-6 regulates aPKC activity in a novel way and mediates cell-cell contact-induced formation of the epithelial junctional complex.Genes Cells. 2001; 6: 721-731Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar), suggesting that aPKC may have a high level of constitutive activity. Par-6 repression of aPKC is thought to be important in Drosophila sensory organ precursor (SOP) cells where aPKC activity is highly dynamic during mitosis (7Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A. Linking cell cycle to asymmetric division: Aurora-A phosphorylates the Par complex to regulate Numb localization.Cell. 2008; 135: 161-173Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). Early during SOP division, aPKC is held in an inactive complex along with Par-6 and the tumor suppressor Lethal giant larvae (Lgl). Activation is proposed to occur by phosphorylation of the Par-6 PB1 domain by the mitotic kinase Aurora A. Because the PB1 domain is the interaction site with aPKC (16Lin D. Edwards A.S. Fawcett J.P.

Chem. 2005; 280: 9653-9661Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), Par-6 dissociates from aPKC allowing Lgl to be phosphorylated and released from the complex. Finally, the Par complex member Baz becomes engaged and aPKC becomes fully activated. The mechanism by which aPKC activity is maintained within appropriate levels by dynamic scaffolding interactions has been unclear. Although protein-protein interactions are thought to regulate aPKC, the precise mechanisms that control catalytic activity are unknown. All PKC isoforms contain NH2-terminal domains that are potentially important for controlling the activity of the COOH-terminal kinase domain (19Newton A.C. Protein kinase C: poised to signal.Am. J. Physiol. Endocrinol. Metab. 2010; 298: E395-E402Crossref PubMed Scopus (397) Google Scholar). These domains include the aPKC-specific PB1 that binds Par-6 (18Hirano Y. Yoshinaga S. Takeya R. Suzuki N.N. Horiuchi M. Kohjima M. Sumimoto H. Inagaki F. Structure of a cell polarity regulator, a complex between atypical PKC and Par6 PB1 domains.J. Biol.

Lin J.H. McCammon J.A. Newton A.C. Increased membrane affinity of the C1 domain of protein kinase Cδ compensates for the lack of involvement of its C2 domain in membrane recruitment.J. Biol.

PKCs also contain a short pseudosubstrate motif that resembles a true substrate but lacks a phosphorylatable residue, making it capable of acting as a competitive inhibitor. In other PKC isoforms the pseudosubstrate autoinhibits catalytic activity, but its role in regulating aPKC is unclear. In this work, we explore the interplay between internal aPKC regulatory elements and the protein-protein interactions that are thought to control aPKC activity during cell polarization. HEK293 F cells were transfected with pCMV His6-aPKC constructs for expression of individual aPKC variants or co-transfected with pCMV His6-Par-6 and pCMV aPKC (no His tag) for expression of the aPKC/Par-6 complex using the 293fectin transfection reagent (Life Technology). The cells were incubated at 37 °C for 72 h followed by sonication and centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C. Ammonium sulfate was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 45% (w/v) and incubated at 4 °C for 30 min. The resulting precipitate was collected by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 30 min at 4 °C and resuspended with Ni2+ lysis buffer (50 mm NaH3PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH). The resuspended precipitate were incubated with Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid resins for 45 min at 4 °C. The resins were washed with the lysis buffer. The proteins were eluted using Ni2+ elution buffer (50 mm NaH3PO4, 300 mm NaCl, 250 mm imidazole, adjusted to pH 8.0 with NaOH). The eluted proteins were dialyzed at 4 °C for 4 h. For the complex with Par-6, the proteins were further purified with a size exclusion column (S200 10/30; GE Healthcare). The concentration of aPKC was determined by comparing its reactivity with an anti-aPKC antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) with that of a standard of known concentration (bacterially expressed aPKC kinase domain purified and quantified using a Bradford dye binding assay) on a Western blot. Full-length and residues 647–673 of Drosophila Lgl isoform A and Baz residues 905–1221 of isoform A (constituting the aPKC binding region) were cloned into pMAL-C2 vector (New England BioLabs), in which a tobacco etch virus protease recognition site was added following the MBP coding sequence. The residues Ser656 and Ser660 in Lgl 647–673 were mutated to alanines. The constructs were transformed into BL21 Escherichia coli cells. The expressions were induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C overnight. The bacterial lysates were incubated with amylose resins (New England BioLabs). The resins were washed with MBP lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT). The MBP fusion proteins were eluted with MBP elution buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mm NaCl, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm DTT, 5 mm maltose) and dialyzed at 4 °C overnight in 20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 50 mm NaCl. The affinity-purified proteins were further purified by ion exchange. GST pulldowns were as described previously (23Nishikawa K. Toker A. Johannes F.J. Songyang Z. Cantley L.C. Determination of the specific substrate sequence motifs of protein kinase C isozymes.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 952-960Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (492) Google Scholar). Briefly, Drosophila aPKC 120–141 was cloned into pGEX-4T1 (GE Healthcare) which was transformed into E. coli strain BL21. Protein expression was induced by 0.4 mm isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside at 18 °C overnight. The bacterial lysate was incubated with GST-agarose (Sigma-Aldrich) at 4 °C for 15 min. The GST resins were washed three times with 1× GST pulldown buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Triton X-100). For the experiment in Fig. 1E, 30 μg of His-aPKC A134D was added along with 10, 20, 40, 80, or 100 μm MBP-Lgl 647–673 S656A/S660A peptide and incubated at room temperature for 20 min in a reaction volume of 100 μl. The supernatant was removed and added to amylose resin (New England Biolabs). Both resins were washed three times with 1× GST pulldown buffer. 30 μl of 6× SDS loading buffer was added to each sample followed by separation on SDS-PAGE and transfer to nitrocellulose. The membrane was probed for aPKC with rabbit anti-aPKCζa (1:5000) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The membrane was further incubated with goat anti-rabbit peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody and visualized with SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific). aPKC kinase activity was measured as described previously (24House C. Wettenhall R.E. Kemp B.E. The influence of basic residues on the substrate specificity of protein kinase C.J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 772-777Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, the purified aPKC variants and aPKC/Par-6 complex were diluted to concentrations at which the incorporation of radiolabeled phosphate from [γ-32P]ATP into MBP-Lgl peptide was linear with respect to time and the enzyme concentrations. The diluted enzymes were preincubated in the assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2) with a wide range of MBP-Lgl peptide concentrations at 30 °C for 5 min. The reactions were initiated by adding 1 mm ATP spiked with [γ-32P]ATP (∼1.0 × 105/nmol of ATP). The reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixtures were blotted on Grade P81 phosphopaper (Whatman). The reactions were quenched by immediately submerging the blotted P81 paper in 75 mm H3PO4. 5 ml of scintillation fluid were added to measure the radioactive decays by liquid scintillation counter. For phosphorylation of Lgl full-length, the reactions were quenched by mixing with 6× SDS loading buffer. The quenched samples were analyzed by 12.5% SDS-PAGE and phosphorimaging. The intensities were analyzed by ImageQuant. Arg-C proteolysis was described previously (25Dutil E.M. Newton A.C. Dual role of pseudosubstrate in the coordinated regulation of protein kinase C by phosphorylation and diacylglycerol.J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 10697-10701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). 30 μg of aPKC variants or aPKC/Par-6 complex was incubated with 1 μg of Arg-C proteinase (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 °C for 120 min. Aliquots were removed at 0 and 120 min into equal volume of 6× SDS loading buffer. As negative control, aPKC variants were incubated at the same conditions without Arg-C proteinase. The samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. Western blots were performed to probe for aPKC proteolysis as described above. Immunofluorescence was as described previously (26Peterson F.C. Penkert R.R. Volkman B.F. Prehoda K.E. Cdc42 regulates the Par-6 PDZ domain through an allosteric CRIB-PDZ transition.Mol. Cell. 2004; 13: 665-676Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (124) Google Scholar). Briefly, for S2 cell expression, aPKC was expressed using transient transfection with a modified pMT vector containing the Drosophila tubulin promoter in place of the metallothionein promoter. Myc:Par-6 and HA:Lgl coding sequences were cloned into the regular pMT vector using 5′-BglII and 3′-XhoI sites. Drosophila Schneider (S2) cells were maintained in Schneider's medium with 10% FBS at room temperature. ∼2 × 106 cells were seeded/well in a 6-well plate and transfected with 0.5 μg of each construct using Effectene transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol. After cells were incubated overnight and induced with 0.5 mm CuSO4 for 24 h, 200 μl of cells were seeded on 12-mm diameter glass coverslips in a 24-well plate and allowed to adhere for 1 h. Cells were fixed for 20 min with 4% formaldehyde in PBS followed by three rinses of wash buffer (0.1% saponin in PBS) and two rinses of block buffer (0.1% saponin and 1% BSA in PBS). Coverslips were incubated overnight at 4 °C with the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-aPKC (1:1000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), mouse anti-HA (1:1000; Covance), rat anti-Par6 (1:1000; in house). Coverslips were then rinsed three times with blocking buffer, incubated at room temperature for 2 h with species-specific secondary antibodies (1:200; Jackson Immunoresearch), rinsed three times in washing buffer, and mounted in Vectashield Hardset Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories). Images were acquired on a confocal microscope (Radiance; Bio-Rad Laboratories) using an oil immersion 60× 1.4 NA objective, processed with ImageJ, and assembled in Adobe Illustrator. 100 μg of the purified MBP-Lgl full-length and MBP-Lgl 647–673 S656A S660A peptide were incubated with amylose resins (New England BioLabs) for 20 min at room temperature. The resins were washed three times with 1× MBP pulldown buffer (20 mm HEPES, 100 mm NaCl, 5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 0.5% Tween 20) and once with kinase assay buffer (50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2). 30 μg of aPKC WT/Par-6 complex was added to the washed resins with or without 0.5 mm ATP to allow phosphorylation. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C for 1 h. The reaction volume was 500 μl. The resins were washed three times with 1× MBP pulldown buffer. 6× SDS loading buffer was added to each sample. The samples were separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and binding was analyzed by Western blotting probing for aPKC as described above. We first identified internal elements within aPKC that regulate its kinase activity (aPKC domain structure is shown in Fig. 1A). In current models for aPKC regulation, Par-6 represses kinase activity (7Wirtz-Peitz F. Nishimura T. Knoblich J.A.

This model originates from experiments using immunoprecipitated aPKC and/or bacterially expressed Par-6 (14Atwood S.X. Chabu C. Penkert R.R. Doe C.Q. Prehoda K.E.

To test aPKC regulation rigorously, we used high level expression in HEK293 cells followed by a three-step purification scheme (see “Experimental Procedures”). This method led to variable degrees of purity of the final products, depending on the aPKC variant (a schematic of aPKC variants used in this study is shown in Fig. 1B and supplemental Fig. S1A). Additionally, there was little difference in the degree of activation loop phosphorylation among the variants, with the exception that the K293W ATP binding pocket mutant (27Leonard T.A. Różycki B.

We measured the activity of these preparations in in vitro kinase assays using a peptide from Lgl, a known substrate (28Leonard T.A. Hurley J.H. Regulation of protein kinases by lipids.Curr. Opin.

Lgl contains three phosphorylatable serines, but we mutated two of them to alanine so that only a single site is available for phosphorylation to simplify the analysis (Fig. 1C). We measured initial rates of catalysis by following the transfer of a radiolabeled phosphorus from ATP to the Lgl peptide over a range of substrate concentrations (i.e. a Michaelis-Menten analysis). We first compared the activities of full-length aPKC with that of its isolated kinase domain. We observed significant levels of activity for the kinase domain, but the activity of full-length aPKC was approximately equal to background activity, as assessed by measuring the activity of the ATP binding pocket mutant K293W (Fig. 1D), which results in an inactive kinase (27Leonard T.A.

Crystal structure and allosteric activation of protein kinase CβII.Cell. 2011; 144: 55-66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The low activity of full-length aPKC precluded measurement of accurate Km and kcat values for this protein, but analysis of initial rates of the kinase domain yielded values of 4 μm and 1.8 s−1, respectively. These values are similar to those from other catalytic domains from the AGC family of kinases (31Hastie C.J. McLauchlan H.J. Cohen P. Assay of protein kinases using radiolabeled ATP: a protocol.Nat. Protoc. 2006; 1: 968-971Crossref PubMed Scopus (194) Google Scholar, 32Lopez-Garcia L.A. Schulze J.O. Fröhner W. Zhang H. Süss E. Weber N. Navratil J. Amon S. Hindie V. Zeuzem S. Jørgensen T.J.

Biol. 2011; 18: 1463-1473Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The dramatic difference between the activity of full-length aPKC and its isolated kinase domain suggests that aPKC is autoinhibited and does not require other elements for regulation. To identify domain(s) that inhibit aPKC activity, we measured the rates of substrate phosphorylation by variants that lacked individual domains within the NH2-terminal regulatory region. Like other PKC family members, aPKC contains a pseudosubstrate motif that can act as an internal competitive inhibitor. A peptide containing the pseudosubstrate sequence competes with binding of true substrates (Fig. 1E), suggesting that the pseudosubstrate can interact with the kinase domain active site. This conclusion is further supported by phosphorylation of the pseudosubstrate when the alanine residue that would sit in the active site is mutated to a serine residue (Fig. 1F). Consistent with these observations, deletion of pseudosubstrate domain dramaticall"

They form an extracellular matrix to provide epithelial integrity and to prevent contact with pathogens and toxins. In arthropods, the cuticle protects, shapes, and enables the functioning of organs. During development, cuticle matrix is shielded from premature degradation; however, underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. Previously, we identified the conserved obstructor multigene-family, which encodes chitin-binding proteins. Here we show that Obstructor-A is required for extracellular matrix dynamics in cuticle forming organs. Loss of obstructor-A causes severe defects during cuticle molting, wound protection, tube expansion and larval growth control. We found that Obstructor-A interacts and forms a core complex with the polysaccharide chitin, the cuticle modifier Knickkopf and the chitin deacetylase Serpentine. Knickkopf protects chitin from chitinase-dependent degradation and deacetylase enzymes ensure extracellular matrix maturation. We provide evidence that Obstructor-A is required to control the presence of Knickkopf and Serpentine in the extracellular matrix. We propose a model suggesting that Obstructor-A coordinates the core complex for extracellular matrix protection from premature degradation. This mechanism enables exoskeletal molting, tube expansion, and epithelial integrity.

In arthropods the cuticle covers the body and internal organs. The cuticle is important, since it plays key roles in growth control, wound healing, and environmental protection (1Galko M.J.

During development, cuticles undergo several rounds of molting to overcome size limitations. This process requires the coordinated secretion and assembly of new cuticles and the replacement of old ones (2Chang E.S.

Previous studies of the Drosophila embryonic tracheal system investigated the biosynthesis and secretion of the apical chitin ECM into newly formed tube lumina (reviewed in Refs. 4Moussian B.

Additionally, chitin matrix formation in the embryonic tracheal cuticle involves Knickkopf (Knk) a conserved GPI-linked chitin-binding protein. Knk has been characterized in Drosophila and in Tribolium (7Moussian B. Tång E. Tonning A. Helms S. Schwarz H. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Uv A.E.

It acts in the newly synthesized cuticle where it is involved in chitin organization and protects chitin from chitinases-mediated degradation. Down-regulation of knk resulted in a chitinase-dependent chitin reduction, lethality and severe molting defects (8Chaudhari S.S. Arakane Y. Specht C.A. Moussian B. Boyle D.L. Park Y. Kramer K.J.

U.S.A. 2011; 108: 17028-17033Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Cuticle maturation involves the deacetylation of chitin, organizing physical and chemical properties of the ECM. Chitin deacetylase-like proteins are conserved and homologs have been found in insects (9Dixit R. Arakane Y. Specht C.A. Richard C. Kramer K.J. Beeman R.W. Muthukrishnan S.

Although single proteins involved in chitin matrix assembly and modifications were identified, little is known about the organization of chitin dynamics. In this study we identified a molecular mechanism that protects the apical ECM from premature degradation in Drosophila. This mechanism is controlled by Obstructor (Obst)-A, encoded by a member of the previously identified obstructor (obst) multigene family (12Behr M. Hoch M. Identification of the novel evolutionary conserved obstructor multigene family in invertebrates.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6827-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We show that Obst-A binds chitin and interacts with Knk and Serp. The resulting chitin protein complex organizes and protects chitin from premature degradation. This is essential for cuticle function and molting.

Thus, obst-A alleles were kept either with the FM7i,P{ActinGFP} or the FM7c,P-{ftz/lacZ} balancer chromosome. In contrast to control animals, hemizygous mutants do not express GFP or β-galactosidase. This allows the identification of hemizygous obst-A mutants. Fixation and immunolabeling were performed as described in Ref. 15Wingen C. Stümpges B. Hoch M. Behr M.

The anti-Obst-A antibody against the C-terminal peptide was generated in rabbits. After final bleeding, the anti-Obst-A antibody was affinity-purified from the sera by using the C-terminal peptide (Eurogentech, Brussels, Belgium). We used anti-Obst-A (1:50), anti-Knk, anti-Serp, Cbp, WGA (all 1:100 in embryos) and anti-α-Spectrin (1:10) for immunolabeling. Primary antibodies were detected by secondary antibodies obtained from Molecular Probes (Alexa488-, Alexa546-, or Alexa633-conjugated) and Dianova (JacksonImmuno, Westgrove, Cy2-, Cy3-conjugated). After washing, embryos were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame). Fluorescein conjugated chitin-binding probe (Cbp, 1:100, New England BioLabs, Ipswitch) detects chitin and Alexa633-conjugated wheat germ agglutinin (WGA, 1:100; Molecular Probes, Invitrogen, Carlsbad) selectively recognizes N-acetylneuraminacid and N-acetylglucosamine sugar residues at the plasma membrane surface. Immunolabeling was detected and analyzed by a Zeiss LSM 710 (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) confocal microscope (ZEN software; sequential scans). For confocal images pinhole “airy unit 1” Zeiss standard settings were used to receive signals only from the focal plane. Each fluorochrome was scanned individually in single optical sections (“sequential scan”) to avoid cross-talk between channels. Subcellular studies were analyzed using a Zeiss 63× LCI Plan Neofluar objective and the Zeiss-Zen software. Images were cropped in Adobe Photoshop CS5 and figures designed with Adobe Illustrator CS5. For generating the GST-Obst-A fusion protein, we cloned a full-length obst-A open-reading frame PCR product in-frame in the pGEX-4T-3 vector. The following primer pair was used: AACCGAATTCCATGAAGTTATTTTTATGTG; GATTGCTCGAGTCTTAGTCCTTCTT. The construct was tested by sequence analysis and transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 cells for isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction (4 h at 27 °C) of the GST-Obst-A fusion protein, which was purified by using GST beads. Samples were subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Amersham Biosciences, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont), blocked for 1 h with Roti-block (Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany) and incubated overnight (4 °C) with the primary antibody. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody was used for chemiluminescent detection (ECL, Pearce, Thermo Scientific, Rockford). Serp,Verm, Knk were used in a 1:1000 and Obst-A in a 1:5000 dilution. The colloidal chitin-binding assay was previously reported (16Nisole A. Stewart D. Bowman S. Zhang D. Krell P.J. Doucet D.

For cuticle preparation, larvae were selected for genotype, washed with H2O, and incubated in 1:1 lactate and Hoyers reagent overnight at 65 °C. Larval stages were determined by morphology of mouth-hooks. Small and one-toothed mouth hooks are characteristic for first instar larvae. About 48 h, after egg laying (AEL) the first instar larvae molt to second instar, which can be identified by a mouth-hook with two to five teeth. For the analysis of the tracheal cuticle we used living larvae mounted in Olympus immersion oil. Larvae were analyzed with 100× objective and Nomarski microscopy (DIC; Olympus AX70, Tokyo, Japan).

Drosophila larvae dramatically increase their body size during development. Searching for mutants causing early lethality and body size reduction (Fig. 1, A and B), we identified a P-element (obst-A663) inserted upstream of the obst-A (CG17052; Fig. 2A; supplemental Fig. S1, A and B) gene at the X-chromosome (19C1).FIGURE 2Obst-A is a conserved chitin-binding domain protein with putative homologs among arthropods and nematodes.

Additionally, we identified a deficiency mutant (Df(1)HM44), which lacks obst-A. All identified alleles cause lethality of hemizygous mutant animals (not shown; see below). Trans-heterozygous mutants combining heterozygous alleles of obst-A663, obst-Ad02, obst-Ad03, and the deficiency were lethal and showed that the obst-A mutations did not complement each other (supplemental Fig. S2A). We generated a transgenic UAS-obst-A fly line for GAL4 driven obst-A overexpression. The ectopic expression of obst-A, was able to rescue obst-A-null and P-element induced lethality (supplemental Fig. S2B). In summary, complementation and rescue studies identified obst-Ad02, obst-Ad03, and obst-A663 as obst-A alleles. Northern blot analysis identified two obst-A transcripts (supplemental Fig. S1C). Both transcripts encode for a single putative protein with a predicted size of 27 kDa (12Behr M. Hoch M. Identification of the novel evolutionary conserved obstructor multigene family in invertebrates.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6827-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). To analyze the obst-A gene product, we raised a specific antibody that recognizes the C terminus of Obst-A (Fig. 2A). Immunofluorescent stainings showed that the antibody specifically recognizes UAS-GAL4 mediated ectopic Obst-A expression in whole mount embryos (supplemental Fig. S1, D and E). In confocal studies of whole mount embryos the anti-Obst-A antibody detects a specific pattern, which was absent in the obst-A deletion mutants (supplemental Fig. S1, F–H). On immunoblots, the anti-Obst-A antibody detects a prominent signal at the expected size of 27 kDa of wild-type (wt) but not of obst-A deficiency and null mutant extracts (supplemental Fig. S1, I–K). To assess the obst-A importance for development, we monitored the P-element and deletion mutants by Nomarski microscopy. All obst-A mutants failed in body size expansion during larval development, while control animals and heterozygous siblings doubled or even tripled their body size at the same time (Fig. 1A; supplemental Fig. S2, C and C′). Additionally, the obst-A-null mutation caused larval lethality (Fig. 1B), which was rescued to adulthood by UAS-GAL4-mediated Obst-A overexpression using either ubiquitous or ectodermal specific driver lines (supplemental Fig. S2B). Immunoblot analysis of wt animals, using the specific anti-Obst-A antibody, identified Obst-A in embryonic and larval stages (Fig. 1C). These findings provide evidence for a vital role of Obst-A during larval development and body size control. Defective food passage from the foregut into the midgut can result in larval lethality (17Bauer R. Lehmann C. Fuss B. Eckardt F. Hoch M. The Drosophila gap junction channel gene innexin 2 controls foregut development in response to Wingless signaling.J. Cell Sci. 2002; 115: 1859-1867Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We performed a feeding assay using Carmine Red (Sigma) labeled yeast paste and monitored its passage into larval midgut by bright field microscopy. The obst-A-null mutant larvae were lethargic compared with control animals, but crawled and ingested red labeled food, which was predominantly found in the midgut and indistinguishable from control animals (supplemental Fig. S2D). This suggests that food passage was not affected. Protein domain predictions of Obst-A amino acid sequence revealed a signal peptide and three chitin-binding domains type 2 (ChtBD2; Fig. 2B), spaced by two linker regions (12Behr M. Hoch M. Identification of the novel evolutionary conserved obstructor multigene family in invertebrates.FEBS Lett. 2005; 579: 6827-6833Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). We screened available databases and blast search programs with standard settings, provided by the NCBI, and used the Mega5 (18Tamura K. Peterson D. Peterson N. Stecher G. Nei M. Kumar S. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods.Mol. Biol. Evol. 2011; 28: 2731-2739Crossref PubMed Scopus (34840) Google Scholar) software for protein alignments. We identified Obst-A homologs among arthropods, such as bugs, ticks, mosquitoes, and nematodes (Fig. 2C), but not in fungi or plants. The conserved sequence and domain arrangements of chitin-binding domains suggest a common role of Obst-A and its homologs in the organization of chitinous cuticles. Previously, larval lethality and body size arrest have been linked to cuticle molting defects, where mutant larvae possessed old and new cuticles (19Li T. Bender M. A conditional rescue system reveals essential functions for the ecdysone receptor (EcR) gene during molting and metamorphosis in Drosophila.Development. 2000; 127: 2897-2905Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Preparation of obst-A mutant cuticles of late embryos revealed normal structure (supplemental Fig. S3, A–D). In contrast, cuticle preparation of larvae, containing second instar multiple teethed mouth hooks, showed severe defects in obst-A mutants. While control animals replaced their cuticle (Fig. 3, A-A“; supplemental Fig. S3, E, G, I, I′), obst-A mutant larvae showed cuticle molting defects of head skeleton, epidermis, tracheae, and posterior spiracles (Fig. 3, B-B”; supplemental Fig. S3, F, H, J). The tracheal cuticle was analyzed in vivo by Nomarksi optic using first instar larvae shortly and 24 h after hatching, when they started to molt into second instar. Analysis of the tracheal cuticle revealed in early and late first instar control animals regularly spaced taenidial folds, thickenings in the inner tube surface. In contrast, obst-A mutants showed misarranged taenidial folds (Fig. 3, C-D′). In summary, this indicates that Obst-A is required for taenidial arrangement and cuticle molting since old cuticles are not properly degraded. It further suggests that Obst-A controls body size by its effect on cuticle molting. To test the protective function of the epidermal cuticle, its integrity was studied. This assay was adapted to a previous publication, demonstrating larval wound healing after stabbing of animals (1Galko M.J. Krasnow M.A. Cellular and genetic analysis of wound healing in Drosophila larvae.PLoS Biol. 2004; 2: E239Crossref PubMed Scopus (293) Google Scholar). We gently pricked first instar larvae with a thin glass needle normally used for microinjection and immediately monitored them by Nomarski microscopy (Fig. 3E). Most of the wt larvae showed no injury after pricking and only about 40% began to bleed slightly (Fig. 3, F and G). In contrast, all pricked obst-A mutants bled strongly, organs spilled out and they died within a few minutes (Fig. 3, F and H). The phenotypes caused by epidermal rupture of mutant larvae suggest that Obst-A is involved in epidermal body protection, provided by the cuticle. The three identified putative Obst-A chitin-binding domains suggest a chitin interaction. This was addressed by a chitin-binding assay. We used a colloidal chitin-bead affinity chromatography (see “Experimental Procedures”). In this assay Obst-A was pulled down by colloidal chitin from embryo extract, but not the intracellular protein heat shock cognate (Hsc) 70 as a negative control (Fig. 4A). This indicates that Obst-A interacts with chitin. Additionally, immunofluorescent confocal studies in whole mount embryos revealed Obst-A transcript and protein expression in cuticle forming organs, predominantly in tracheae, foregut, posterior spiracles, and epidermis (Fig. 4, B–D; supplemental Fig. S3, K and L). In Drosophila embryos chitin can be visualized by the fluorescein-linked chitin-binding-probe (Cbp). Confocal studies of immunostainings in wt embryos showed co-localization of Obst-A and chitin at the epidermal surface (Fig. 4E) and in the tracheal tube lumina (Fig. 4, G and H; supplemental Fig. S4). Next, we tested whether chitin has any effect on Obst-A localization. Flies fed with nikkomycin (7Moussian B. Tång E. Tonning A. Helms S. Schwarz H. Nüsslein-Volhard C. Uv A.E.

Importantly, this led to reduction and mislocalization of extracellular Obst-A (Fig. 4, F, I). Chitinases are conserved members of a hydrolase family mediating chitin digestion (20Zhu Q. Arakane Y. Beeman R.W. Kramer K.J. Muthukrishnan S. Functional specialization among insect chitinase family genes revealed by RNA interference.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2008; 105: 6650-6655Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar). Tracheal overexpression of the Chitinase2 (Cht2) reduced chitin levels, which resulted in Obst-A reduction and mislocalization (Fig. 4J). Altogether, our data provide evidence, that Obst-A is co-expressed, co-localized and associated with chitin. It further shows that chitin is required for cuticular Obst-A localization. Cuticle molting defects in the mutants and chitin binding suggest an unknown and important role of Obst-A in organization of chitin dynamics. In order to assess the role of Obst-A in chitin assembly or degradation, we studied chitin in the tracheal lumina of late embryos. For this assay we used the chitin marker Cbp and confocal microscopy. In wt embryos chitin strongly accumulates in the tracheal lumina (Fig. 4, G, H, K; supplemental Fig. S4, A–C) from stage (st)14 onwards, and is degraded at st17 (supplemental Fig. S4, D, D′) (21Behr M.

Pyk2 plays diverse functions in cells, including the regulation of cell adhesion, migration, and cytoskeletal reorganization. In the brain, it is involved in the induction of long term potentiation through regulation of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor trafficking. This occurs through the phosphorylation and activation of Src family tyrosine kinase members, such as Fyn, that phosphorylate GluN2B at Tyr1472. Phosphorylation at this site leads to exocytosis of GluN1-GluN2B receptors to synaptic membranes. Pyk2 activity is modulated by phosphorylation at several critical tyrosine sites, including Tyr402. In this study, we report that Pyk2 is a substrate of striatal-enriched protein-tyrosine phosphatase (STEP). STEP binds to and dephosphorylates Pyk2 at Tyr402. STEP KO mice showed enhanced phosphorylation of Pyk2 at Tyr402 and of the Pyk2 substrates paxillin and ASAP1. Functional studies indicated that STEP opposes Pyk2 activation after KCl depolarization of cortical slices and blocks Pyk2 translocation to postsynaptic densities, a key step required for Pyk2 activation and function.

Considerably more is known about the kinases that activate Pyk2 within the CNS compared with the tyrosine phosphatases that inactivate it. Several protein-tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have been reported to associate with Pyk2 outside of the CNS and regulate its activity (19Kumar S. Avraham S. Bharti A. Goyal J. Pandey P. Kharbanda S.

However, a physiologically relevant PTP in the brain has not yet been reported. Here we focus on the brain-enriched striatal-enriched protein-tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) as a possible regulator of Pyk2 in neurons.

Point mutations were introduced using site-directed mutagenesis (kit from Stratagene, Santa Clara, CA), and all constructs were sequenced prior to use. Deletion constructs of STEP (polyproline-rich 1 and 2 (PR1 and PR2) and the kinase-interacting motif (KIM) domains) and pCMV-hFyn constructs were described previously (25Nguyen T.H. Liu J.

Fusion constructs were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) and purified on glutathione-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) or TALON metal affinity resin beads (Clontech) following the manufacturers' instructions. GST fusion proteins were eluted with 10 mm reduced glutathione in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), pH 8. His-tagged proteins were eluted in PBS, pH 7.4, 150 mm imidazole. All proteins were concentrated using Amicon Ultra-4 filter units with 30- or 50-kDa cutoffs (Millipore, Billerica, MA). For some assays, STEP46 fusion proteins, which lack the N-terminal 172 amino acids of STEP61, were used, because of technical difficulty in purification of large amounts of the insoluble protein STEP61. The Yale University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved all animal procedures used in the present study. Coronal corticostriatal slices (300 μm) were prepared from male WT or STEP KO mice (8–10 weeks on a C57B6 background as described (30Venkitaramani D.V. Paul S. Zhang Y. Kurup P. Ding L. Tressler L.

Slices were placed on dry ice immediately after stimulations and homogenized. Slices were homogenized in TEVP buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 5 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm EGTA, protease inhibitor mixture (Roche Applied Science)), and P2 fractions were obtained as described previously (28Xu J.

The insoluble fractions (PSD) were lysed in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer with 1% SDS buffer followed by brief sonication. Synaptoneurosomes from WT or STEP KO mice whole brains were obtained as described previously (27Zhang Y. Venkitaramani D.V. Gladding C.M. Zhang Y. Kurup P. Molnar E. Collingridge G.L. Lombroso P.J.

Briefly, tissues were homogenized in homogenization buffer (20 mm HEPES/NaOH, pH 7.4, 124 mm NaCl, 1.06 mm KH2PO4, 26 mm NaHCO3, 1.3 mm MgCl2, 2.5 mm CaCl2, 10 mm glucose, Complete protease inhibitor tablets (Roche Applied Science)). Homogenates were centrifuged at 2000 × g for 1 min. The supernatant was passed through two 100-μm nylon mesh filters (Sefar America, Richfield, MN) followed by a 5-μm nitrocellulose filter (Millipore) and centrifuged at 1000 × g at 4 °C for 10 min. Pellets were washed, resuspended in homogenization buffer, and dispensed into 100-μl aliquots. All aliquots were preincubated at 37 °C for 10 min before stimulation with 40 mm KCl for various times as indicated. Some aliquots were pretreated with cyclosporin A (CsA; 100 nm) for 20 min before the addition of KCl. Thirty microliters of each aliquot were mixed with 6× SDS sample buffer and subjected to Western blotting. HEK293 cells or SYF cells (a generous gift from A. M. Bennett, Yale University School of Medicine) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) and antibiotics. HEK293 or SYF cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/35-mm dish 24 h before transfection. The next day, pcDNA3-STEP WT, mutants, or truncation constructs were co-transfected with pcDNA3-Pyk2 or pCMV-Fyn using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's protocol. After 6 h of incubation at 37 °C, the medium was replaced, and cells were incubated for another 36–48 h. Cells were lysed in M-PER mammalian extraction reagent (Pierce) and subjected to immunoprecipitation or Western blotting. Mouse brain homogenates or cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-STEP or anti-Pyk2 antibodies in M-PER reagents overnight at 4 °C. The 2nd day, Protein A/G PLUS-Agarose beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) were added and incubated for another 4 h. Beads were collected by centrifugation and washed three times with lysis buffer. Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in SDS sample buffer after the final wash and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-STEP, anti-Pyk2, or anti-Fyn antibody. For pulldown assays, GST fusion proteins were adsorbed to glutathione-Sepharose beads for 2 h at 4 °C and then incubated with WT or STEP KO mouse brain homogenates (100 μg) in radioimmune precipitation assay buffer overnight at 4 °C. In some experiments, the catalytically inactive GST-STEP61 C472S protein was mixed with 1 μg of His-Pyk2 and increasing amounts of His-Fyn. Beads were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. GST-tagged Pyk2 constructs (either full-length Pyk2 (amino acids 1–1009) or with amino acid deletions to give amino acids 1–710, 671–1009, 671–875, 728–849, or 876–1009) or GST alone was immobilized on glutathione-Sepharose beads. After washes, His-tagged STEP46 (500 nm) was added for 2 h at 4 °C. The samples were washed and subjected to SDS-PAGE. Prior to immunoblotting with anti-STEP antibody, the membranes were stained with Ponceau S stain to visualize GST fusion proteins. FP-based binding assays were performed in a Synergy 2 plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) with Gen5 software using 96-well black polystyrene plates (Corning, Corning, NY). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled peptides were obtained from CHI Scientific (Maynard, MA). The sequences are shown in Table 2. Increasing concentrations of recombinant proteins (either GST-STEP61, GST-STEP46, or GST-Pyk2(671–875)) were incubated with FITC-labeled peptide at a final concentration of 1 μm in FP buffer (50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 100 mm KCl, 1 mm MgCl2, 0.05 mm EGTA, 5 mm nitrilotriacetic acid). Parallel and perpendicular intensities were determined with 485/20λ excitation and 528/20λ emission filters, and FP was calculated as described by Lim et al. (32Lim I.A. Hall D.D. Hell J.W.

https://openalex.org/W1974867354,"Background Dietary fish oil, rich in n-3 fatty acids (n-3 FAs), e.g. docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), regulate inflammatory reactions by various mechanisms, e.g. gene activation. However, the effects of long-term treatment with DHA and EPA in humans, using genome wide techniques, are poorly described. Hence, our aim was to determine the effects of 6 mo of dietary supplementation with an n-3 FA preparation rich in DHA on global gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Methods and Findings In the present study, blood samples were obtained from a subgroup of 16 patients originating from the randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled OmegAD study, where 174 Alzheimer disease (AD) patients received daily either 1.7 g of DHA and 0.6 g EPA or placebo for 6 months. In blood samples obtained from 11 patients receiving n-3 FA and five placebo, expressions of approximately 8000 genes were assessed by gene array. Significant changes were confirmed by real-time PCR. At 6 months, the n-3 FAs group displayed significant rises of DHA and EPA plasma concentrations, as well as up- and down-regulation of nine and ten genes, respectively, was noticed. Many of these genes are involved in inflammation regulation and neurodegeneration, e.g. CD63, MAN2A1, CASP4, LOC399491, NAIP, and SORL1 and in ubiqutination processes, e.g. ANAPC5 and UBE2V1. Down-regulations of ANAPC5 and RHOB correlated to increases of plasma DHA and EPA levels. Conclusions We suggest that 6 months of dietary n-3 FA supplementation affected expression of genes that might influence inflammatory processes and could be of significance for AD.

https://openalex.org/W2001419407,"Yes-associated protein (YAP) is a transcriptional co-activator that acts downstream of the Hippo signaling pathway and regulates multiple cellular processes. Although cytoplasmic retention of YAP is known to be mediated by Hippo pathway-dependent phosphorylation, post-translational modifications that regulate YAP in the nucleus remain unclear. Here we report the discovery of a novel cycle of acetylation/deacetylation of nuclear YAP induced in response to S(N)2 alkylating agents. We show that after treatment of cells with the S(N)2 alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate, YAP phosphorylation mediated by the Hippo pathway is markedly reduced, leading to nuclear translocation of YAP and its acetylation. This YAP acetylation occurs on specific and highly conserved C-terminal lysine residues and is mediated by the nuclear acetyltransferases CBP (CREB binding protein) and p300. Conversely, the nuclear deacetylase SIRT1 is responsible for YAP deacetylation. Intriguingly, we found that YAP acetylation is induced specifically by S(N)2 alkylating agents and not by other DNA-damaging stimuli. These results identify a novel YAP acetylation cycle that occurs in the nucleus downstream of the Hippo pathway. Intriguingly, our findings also indicate that YAP acetylation is involved in responses to a specific type of DNA damage."
https://openalex.org/W2108720210,"CtIP (CtBP-interacting protein) associates with BRCA1 and the Mre11-Rad50-Nbs1 (MRN) complex and plays an essential role in homologous recombination (HR)-mediated DNA double-stranded break (DSB) repair. It has been described that CtIP forms dimers in mammalian cells, but the biological significance is not clear. In this study, we identified a conserved motif in the N terminus of CtIP, which is required for dimer formation. We further showed that CtIP mutants impaired in forming dimers are strongly defective in HR, end resection, and activation of the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related pathway, without notable change of CtIP interactions with BRCA1 or Nbs1. In addition to HR, CtIP dimerization is also required for microhomology-mediated end joining. Live cell imaging of enhanced GFP-tagged CtIP demonstrates that the CtIP dimerization mutant fails to be localized to DSBs, whereas placing a heterologous dimerization motif to the dimerization mutant restores CtIP recruitment to DSBs. These studies suggest that CtIP dimer formation is essential for its recruitment to DSBs on chromatin upon DNA damage. Furthermore, DNA damage-induced phosphorylation of CtIP is significantly reduced in the CtIP dimerization mutants. Therefore, in addition to the C-terminal conserved domains critical for CtIP function, the dimerization motif on the N terminus of CtIP is also conserved and essential for its function in DNA damage responses. The severe repair defects of CtIP dimerization mutants are likely due to the failure in localization to chromosomal DSBs upon DNA damage.

Functional interactions between Sae2 and the Mre11 complex.Genetics. 2008; 178: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Sae2-L25P/E171G is highly sensitive to methyl methanesulfonate and CPT, shows synthetic lethality with rad27Δ and exhibits meiosis defect. Subsequent analysis revealed that this mutant allele is defective in forming Sae2 oligomers (16Kim H.S. Vijayakumar S. Reger M. Harrison J.C. Haber J.E. Weil C. Petrini J.H. Functional interactions between Sae2 and the Mre11 complex.Genetics. 2008; 178: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). It was also described that human CtIP forms a homodimer through the N terminus of CtIP (17Dubin M.J. Stokes P.H. Sum E.Y. Williams R.S. Valova V.A. Robinson P.J. Lindeman G.J. Glover J.N. Visvader J.E. Matthews J.M. Dimerization of CtIP, a BRCA1- and CtBP-interacting protein, is mediated by an N-terminal coiled-coil motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26932-26938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar), but the biological function of CtIP dimerization remains unknown in mammalian cells. In this study, we identified a conserved motif present at the N terminus of human CtIP, which is critical for CtIP dimerization. We showed that the CtIP dimerization mutants are severely defective in HR-mediated DSB repair and are sensitive to DNA-damaging agents. Furthermore, DNA end resection is defective in the CtIP dimerization mutants, and consequently ATR activation is also impaired. In addition to HR, we demonstrated that these mutants are also deficient in using microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) to repair DSBs. Although CtIP is not required for ATM activation, IR-induced CtIP phosphorylation is impaired in the dimerization mutants. By using live cell imaging of fluorescent-tagged proteins, we found that CtIP dimerization is required for its recruitment to DSBs on chromatin. The defect in localizing CtIP dimerization mutants to DSBs thus underlies the severe defects of these mutants in mediating DNA damage responses. CtIP polyclonal antibodies were generated by immunizing rabbits with GST-fused CtIP fragments covering amino acids 1–220 or 631–897 and were affinity-purified. Other antibodies used include anti-FLAG-M2 (Sigma), anti-Myc-9E10 (Novus Biologicals), anti-HA-11 (Covance), anti-Ku70 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-RPA2 (Oncogene), anti-H2AX-S319-p, anti-Chk1-S317-p (Cell Signaling Technology), anti-Chk1 (R & D Systems), anti-Chk2-T68 (GeneTex), and anti-Chk2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). All CtIP point or deletion mutants were generated by using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) or by PCR amplification and ligation into pcDNA3 or Babe-puro vectors containing HA-, Myc-, or FLAG-tagged epitopes. Recombinant baculoviruses expressing GST- or FLAG-tagged CtIP or Nbs1 were generated by using Bac-to-Bac baculovirus expression systems (Invitrogen). EGFP-tagged CtIP or indicated mutants were generated using EGFP-C1 expression vector (Clontech). To make GCN4-CtIP LKEX4Emut, two pairs of annealed oligomers (GCN4BamHIF 5′-GATCCAGAATGAAACAACTTGAAGACAAGGTTGAAGAATTGCTTTCGAAAAATTATCACTTGGAA, GCN4BamHIR 5′-ACCTCATTTTCCAAGTGATAATTTTTCGAAAGCAATTCTTCAACCTTGTCTTCAAGTTGTTTCATTCTG and GCN4BglIIF 5′-AATGAGGTTGCCAGATTAAAGAAATTAGTTGGCGAACGCAACGCCGCCATACGTAGTA, GCN4BglIIR 5′-GATCTACTACGTATGGCGGCGTTGCGTTCGCCAACTAATTTCTTTAATCTGGCA) were inserted into the BamHI site of HA-CtIP LKEX4Emut plasmid.

Fluorescence microscopy was performed using a Nikon Eclipse E800 fluorescence microscope and SPOT Advanced imaging software. EGFP-based repair substrates to assay for DSB repair mediated by HR (EGFP-HR, shown in Fig. 3B) or by MMEJ (EGFP-MMEJ, shown in Fig. 5A) were generated as follows. For EGFP-HR construct, a full-length EGFP cassette was disrupted by insertion of the 18-bp I-SceI cleavage recognition site containing two in-frame stop codons in EGFP ORF (supplemental Fig. S1A), followed by insertion of an inactive, truncated EGFP donor fragment downstream of hygromycin resistance marker. For EGFP-MMEJ, a full-length EGFP cassette was inactivated by inserting a 27-bp oligonucleotide containing an I-SceI cleavage site flanked on both sides by 9-bp microhomology sequence. This was achieved by duplicating the 9-bp sequence present in EGFP. U2OS cells were stably integrated with EGFP-HR and EGFP-MMEJ repair substrates by transfection using FuGENE (Roche Applied Science) followed by hygromycin drug selection, and single clones were selected and confirmed by Southern blotting for single-copy integration.FIGURE 5The conserved LKEX4E motif of CtIP is important for MMEJ-mediated DSB repair.

Cells expressing I-SceI-IRES-dsRedNLS can be specifically selected and gated for by FACS analysis of EGFP-HR and EGFP-MMEJ repair assay. The percentage of I-SceI-induced DSB repair is determined by the ratio of cells exhibiting both green and red signals to all red cells, as revealed by FACS analysis. Cells with both green and red signals and with red signals only are shown in supplemental Fig. S1C. U2OS EGFP-HR and EGFP-MMEJ cells were stably expressed with shRNA- and siRNA-resistant wild type HA-tagged CtIP or CtIP indicated mutants for the dimerization motif by retroviral infection. After knockdown of endogenous CtIP by shRNA and siRNA, the cells were transfected with I-SceI-IRES-dsRedNLS and plated in nonselective medium for 72 h after transfection and then recovered by trypsinization, and the collected cells were analyzed using a BD Accuri C6 flow cytometer and the accompanying analysis software (BD Biosciences). GST-CtIP wild type and the indicated mutants were expressed in Sf21 insect cells. All of the recombinant proteins were purified using glutathione-agarose resin according to the manufacturer's protocol (GE Healthcare). For in vitro DNA binding assay, DNA fragments (0.5 kb) were generated by PCR amplification of the plasmid pUC19 using a 5′ biotinylated forward oligonucleotide primer and an unlabeled reverse primer. 200 ng of DNA fragments were first incubated with 10 μl of M-270 streptavidin Dynabeads (Invitrogen) in PBS with 0.1% Tween 20. After washing with binding buffer containing 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.5, 50 mm potassium chloride, and 5 mm magnesium chloride. DNA-containing beads were then incubated with purified CtIP wild type or mutants protein in binding buffer for 1.5 h at 4 °C. After washing, the samples were boiled with 2× SDS loading buffer and detected by immunoblotting. For ATM in vitro kinase assays, FLAG-tagged ATM was transiently transfected into 293T cells and immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG M2-agarose beads (Sigma). Immunoprecipitates were extensively washed and then incubated with 1.5 μg of purified GST-CtIP or equal amounts of the indicated mutant proteins in the presence of 10 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP in ATM kinase buffer (25 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MnCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, 1 mm DTT, 5 μm ATP). The kinase reaction was conducted at 30 °C for 30 min. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, and radiolabeled proteins were visualized by gel scanning using a PhophorImage scanner (Typhoon Trio, GE Healthcare). DSBs were generated in live cell nuclei by laser-induced microirradiation using a pulsed nitrogen laser (Laboratory of Dr. David J.

Internet-based robotic laser scissors and tweezers microscopy.Microsc. Res. Tech. 2005; 68: 65-74Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar) as previously described. The laser systems were coupled to Zeiss Axiovert microscopes for live cell, time lapse image capture. Fluorescence intensities of the microirradiated area were calculated using Image J software (National Institutes of Health), with the cellular background fluorescence intensity subtracted from the laser-induced damage site intensity. Each data point is the average of 10 independent measurements. The requirement of CtIP dimerization for its recruitment to DSBs on chromatin was revealed by using both the pulsed nitrogen laser and the picosecond short pulsed green laser. To investigate CtIP dimerization, we tagged CtIP with Myc and HA and expressed them in 293T and U2OS cells. Co-immunoprecipitation showed that HA-CtIP binds to Myc-CtIP, suggesting that CtIP indeed forms dimers in mammalian cells (Fig. 1A and data not shown). Deleting the N-terminal 200 amino acids in both HA-CtIP and Myc-CtIP, or only in HA-CtIP but not Myc-CtIP, completely abolishes the dimer formation, which is consistent with previous findings that the dimerization motifs in CtIP are located at the N terminus of CtIP (Fig. 1A and Ref. 17Dubin M.J. Stokes P.H. Sum E.Y. Williams R.S. Valova V.A. Robinson P.J. Lindeman G.J. Glover J.N. Visvader J.E. Matthews J.M.

These studies also agree with the notion that dimerization motifs need to be present on both alleles to form dimers. Deleting the C terminus conserved Sae2-like domain (CtIP 1–796; Ref. 6Sartori A.A. Lukas C. Coates J. Mistrik M. Fu S. Bartek J. Baer R. Lukas J. Jackson S.P. Human CtIP promotes DNA end resection.Nature. 2007; 450: 509-514Crossref PubMed Scopus (991) Google Scholar) does not impair dimerization (Fig. 1B). CtIP contains two putative coiled-coil domains located near the N and C termini of CtIP, and it was described that the N terminus coiled-coil domain (spanning residues 45–160) is required for CtIP dimer formation (17Dubin M.J. Stokes P.H. Sum E.Y. Williams R.S. Valova V.A. Robinson P.J. Lindeman G.J. Glover J.N. Visvader J.E. Matthews J.M. Dimerization of CtIP, a BRCA1- and CtBP-interacting protein, is mediated by an N-terminal coiled-coil motif.J. Biol. Chem. 2004; 279: 26932-26938Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We generated a series of CtIP N terminus deletion mutants, and surprisingly we found that deleting the first 45 residues of the full length of CtIP completely abolished the dimer formation as revealed by co-immunoprecipitation of CtIP in 293T cells, whereas deleting residues 45–160 (CtIP 45–160del) containing the N terminus coiled-coil domain does not influence the dimer formation (Fig. 1C). Similar results were obtained when we co-expressed GST-fused CtIP fragments containing different N terminus deletions and FLAG-tagged N terminus CtIP 1–461 fragment in insect cells and examined the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 1D). These studies suggest that the N terminus 45 amino acids of CtIP, but not the N terminus coiled-coil domain, are critical for CtIP dimerization. Further deletion analysis revealed that the N-terminal residues from 20 to 45 in the full length of CtIP (CtIP 20–45del) are required for dimer formation (Fig. 2B). We then performed alignment analysis of the N-terminal CtIP amino acid sequences from different species and identified a conserved LKEX4E(V/L) motif (Fig. 2A). The Sae2-L25P mutant that is defective in oligomerization contains the mutation replacing the Leu residue at the end of this motif (Fig. 2A and Ref. 16Kim H.S. Vijayakumar S. Reger M. Harrison J.C. Haber J.E. Weil C. Petrini J.H. Functional interactions between Sae2 and the Mre11 complex.Genetics. 2008; 178: 711-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We mutated four conserved amino acids in this motif LKEX4EV of human CtIP to PAAX4AV (Fig. 2A), and co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that this CtIP mutant, CtIP-LKEX4Emut, completely loses its ability to form dimer (Fig. 2B). These studies suggest that the conserved LKEX4E(V/L) motif at the N terminus of CtIP is important for dimerization. To examine whether CtIP dimerization is important for its repair function, we expressed HA-tagged CtIP 1–897, CtIP 20–45del, and CtIP-LKEX4Emut in U2OS cells, whereas the endogenous CtIP was inactivated by expressing shRNAs. The CtIP dimerization mutants, CtIP 20–45del and CtIP-LKEX4Emut, exhibit strong sensitivity to IR and CPT treatment to a similar level as expressing CtIP shRNAs without reconstitution (Fig. 3A and data not shown). To examine whether these dimerization mutants are defective in HR-mediated DSB repair, we used the U2OS cells carrying the EGFP-based HR substrate stably integrated in chromosomes (Fig. 3B). After inactivating endogenous CtIP, both CtIP 20–45del and CtIP-LKEX4Emut mutants show strong defects in HR-mediated DSB repair. To further understand the mechanisms underlying the HR defects of the dimerization mutants, we asked whether end resection is defective in these mutants. U2OS cells expressing HA-tagged CtIP 1–897, CtIP 20–45del, CtIP-LKEX4Emut, or the vector control cell line were infected with shRNAs to inactivate endogenous CtIP. End resection was monitored by RPA2 foci formation after CPT treatment for 2 h. Both CtIP 20–45del and CtIP-LKEX4Emut mutants exhibited much reduced RPA2 foci formation compared with CtIP 1–897, but at a level comparable with the vector control U2OS cells expressing CtIP shRNA (Fig. 3C). Similarly, IR-induced RPA2 phosphorylation revealed by RPA2 migration shift is also impaired in the CtIP dimerization m"
https://openalex.org/W2094879823,"Background Ophthalmic artery chemosurgery (OAC) for retinoblastoma was introduced by us 5 years ago for advanced intraocular retinoblastoma. Because the success was higher than with existing alternatives and systemic side effects limited we have now treated less advanced intraocular retinoblastoma (Reese-Ellsworth (RE) I-III and International Classification Retinoblastoma (ICRB) B and C). Methodology/Principal Findings Retrospective review of 5 year experience in eyes with Reese Ellsworth (Table 1) I (7 eyes), II (6 eyes) or III (6 eyes) and/or International Classification (Table 2) B (19 eyes) and C (11 eyes) treated with OAC (melphalan with or without topotecan) introduced directly into the ophthalmic artery. Patient survival was 100%. Ocular event-free survival was 100% for Reese-Ellsworth Groups I, II and III (and 96% for ICRB B and C) at a median of 16 months follow-up. One ICRB Group C (Reese-Ellsworth Vb) eye could not be treated on the second attempt for technical reasons and was therefore enucleated. No patient required a port and only one patient required transfusion of blood products. The electroretinogram (ERG) was unchanged or improved in 14/19 eyes. Conclusions/Significance Ophthalmic artery chemosurgery for retinoblastoma that was Reese-Ellsworth I, II and III (or International Classification B or C) was associated with high success (100% of treatable eyes were retained) and limited toxicity with results that equal or exceed conventional therapy with less toxicity."

Methods 73 patients were randomized in a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study to ziprasidone (40-160 mg/d) or placebo for 6 weeks. They met DSM-IV criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE), while also meeting 2 or 3 (but not more nor less) DSM-IV manic criteria. They did not meet DSM-IV criteria for a mixed or manic episode. Baseline psychotropic drugs were continued unchanged. The primary endpoint measured was Montgomery- Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores over time. The mean dose of ziprasidone was 129.7±45.3 mg/day and 126.1±47.1 mg/day for placebo. Results The primary outcome analysis indicated efficacy of ziprasidone versus placebo (p = 0.0038). Efficacy was more pronounced in type II bipolar disorder than in MDD (p = 0.036). Overall ziprasidone was well tolerated, without notable worsening of weight or extrapyramidal symptoms.

https://openalex.org/W2019539159,"Gene expression profiling of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is a powerful tool for the identification of surrogate markers involved in disease processes. The hypothesis tested in this study was that chronic exposure of PBMCs to a hypertensive environment in remodeled pulmonary vessels would be reflected by specific transcriptional changes in these cells.The transcript profiles of PBMCs from 30 idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension patients (IPAH), 19 patients with systemic sclerosis without pulmonary hypertension (SSc), 42 scleroderma-associated pulmonary arterial hypertensio patients (SSc-PAH), and 8 patients with SSc complicated by interstitial lung disease and pulmonary hypertension (SSc-PH-ILD) were compared to the gene expression profiles of PBMCs from 41 healthy individuals. Multiple gene expression signatures were identified which could distinguish various disease groups from controls. One of these signatures, specific for erythrocyte maturation, is enriched specifically in patients with PH. This association was validated in multiple published datasets. The erythropoiesis signature was strongly correlated with hemodynamic measures of increasing disease severity in IPAH patients. No significant correlation of the same type was noted for SSc-PAH patients, this despite a clear signature enrichment within this group overall. These findings suggest an association of the erythropoiesis signature in PBMCs from patients with PH with a variable presentation among different subtypes of disease.In PH, the expansion of immature red blood cell precursors may constitute a response to the increasingly hypoxic conditions prevalent in this syndrome. A correlation of this erythrocyte signature with more severe hypertension cases may provide an important biomarker of disease progression."
https://openalex.org/W2071641795,"The adipokine leptin realizes signal transduction via four different membrane-anchored leptin receptor (Ob-R) isoforms in humans. However, the amount of functionally active Ob-R is affected by constitutive shedding of the extracellular domain via a so far unknown mechanism. The product of the cleavage process the so-called soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R) is the main binding protein for leptin in human blood and modulates its bioavailability. sOb-R levels are differentially regulated in metabolic disorders like type 1 diabetes mellitus or obesity and can, therefore, enhance or reduce leptin sensitivity.To describe mechanisms of Ob-R cleavage and to investigate the functional significance of differential sOb-R levels we established a model of HEK293 cells transiently transfected with different human Ob-R isoforms. Using siRNA knockdown experiments we identified ADAM10 (A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 10) as a major protease for constitutive and activated Ob-R cleavage. Additionally, the induction of lipotoxicity and apoptosis led to enhanced shedding shown by increased levels of the soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R) in cell supernatants. Conversely, high leptin concentrations and ER stress reduced sOb-R levels. Decreased amounts of sOb-R due to ER stress were accompanied by impaired leptin signaling and reduced leptin binding.Lipotoxicity and apoptosis increased Ob-R cleavage via ADAM10-dependent mechanisms. In contrast high leptin levels and ER stress led to reduced sOb-R levels. While increased sOb-R concentrations seem to directly block leptin action, reduced amounts of sOb-R may reflect decreased membrane expression of Ob-R. These findings could explain changes of leptin sensitivity which are associated with variations of serum sOb-R levels in metabolic diseases."
https://openalex.org/W2140245948,"Although the entire duration of fetal development is generally considered a highly susceptible period, it is of public health interest to determine a narrower window of heightened vulnerability to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in humans. We posited that exposure to PAHs during the first trimester impairs fetal growth more severely than a similar level of exposure during the subsequent trimesters.In a group of healthy, non-smoking pregnant women with no known risks of adverse birth outcomes, personal exposure to eight airborne PAHs was monitored once during the second trimester for the entire cohort (n = 344), and once each trimester within a subset (n = 77). Both air monitoring and self-reported PAH exposure data were used in order to statistically estimate PAH exposure during the entire gestational period for each individual newborn.One natural-log unit increase in prenatal exposure to the eight summed PAHs during the first trimester was associated with the largest decrement in the Fetal Growth Ratio (FGR) (-3%, 95% Confidence Interval (CI), -5 to -0%), birthweight (-105 g, 95% CI, -188 to -22 g), and birth length (-0.78 cm, 95% CI, -1.30 to -0.26 cm), compared to the unit effects of PAHs during the subsequent trimesters, after accounting for confounders. Furthermore, a unit exposure during the first trimester was associated with the largest elevation in Cephalization Index (head to weight ratio) (3 μm/g, 95% CI, 1 to 5 μm/g). PAH exposure was not associated with evidence of asymmetric growth restriction in this cohort.PAH exposure appears to exert the greatest adverse effect on fetal growth during the first trimester. The present data support the need for the protection of pregnant women and the embryo/fetus, particularly during the earliest stage of pregnancy."
https://openalex.org/W1964548101,"Deregulated activity of transcription factors (TFs) of the Sp/KLF family, like Sp1, Sp3 and Sp4, and consequent over-expression of Sp-regulated genes occur frequently in human cancers. This provides the rationale for development of inhibitors of Sp TFs as cancer therapeutics. Mithramycin A (MTM-A) is a natural polyketide that binds GC-rich DNA sequences, inhibits activity of Sp TFs and exhibits potent antitumor activity in experimental systems. However, clinical use of MTM-A is limited by the severe toxicity of the compound. Here, we studied two MTM-A analogues, which had been generated by genetically engineering of the MTM-A biosynthetic pathway, and evaluated their activity in human prostate cancer in cell cultures and mouse models. The compounds, named MTM-SDK and MTM-SK, were highly effective in vitro inhibiting proliferation of prostate cancer cells and transcription of Sp-regulated genes by blocking binding of Sp proteins to the gene promoters When administered to mice, both compounds were well tolerated with maximum tolerated doses of MTM-SDK and MTM-SK, respectively, 4- and 32- fold higher than MTM-A. After systemic administration, both compounds were cleared rapidly from the bloodstream but maintained plasma levels well above the active concentrations required in vitro for inhibition of Sp TF activity and cell proliferation. Consistently, MTM-SDK and MTM-SK inhibited transcription of Sp-regulated genes in prostate tumor xenografts and exhibited potent antitumor activity in subcutaneous and metastatic tumor xenograft models with no or minimal toxicity. Taken together, these data indicate that MTM-SDK and MTM-SK possess significantly improved pharmacological and toxicological properties compared to MTM-A and represent promising drugs for treatment of advanced prostate cancer."
https://openalex.org/W2042141000,"Direct and indirect effects of global warming are expected to be pronounced and fast in the Arctic, impacting terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. The Barents Sea is a high latitude shelf Sea and a boundary area between arctic and boreal faunas. These faunas are likely to respond differently to changes in climate. In addition, the Barents Sea is highly impacted by fisheries and other human activities. This strong human presence places great demands on scientific investigation and advisory capacity. In order to identify basic community structures against which future climate related or other human induced changes could be evaluated, we analyzed species composition and diversity of demersal fish in the Barents Sea. We found six main assemblages that were separated along depth and temperature gradients. There are indications that climate driven changes have already taken place, since boreal species were found in large parts of the Barents Sea shelf, including also the northern Arctic area. When modelling diversity as a function of depth and temperature, we found that two of the assemblages in the eastern Barents Sea showed lower diversity than expected from their depth and temperature. This is probably caused by low habitat complexity and the distance to the pool of boreal species in the western Barents Sea. In contrast coastal assemblages in south western Barents Sea and along Novaya Zemlya archipelago in the Eastern Barents Sea can be described as diversity ""hotspots""; the South-western area had high density of species, abundance and biomass, and here some species have their northern distribution limit, whereas the Novaya Zemlya area has unique fauna of Arctic, coastal demersal fish.

To better understand the host response to a virulent pathogen, we performed expression profiling throughout a time course of a compatible interaction using whole transcriptome sequencing. As described herein, we were able to detect the expression of 15,286 cucumber genes, of which 14,476 were expressed throughout the infection process from 1 day post-inoculation (dpi) to 8 dpi. A large number of genes, 1,612 to 3,286, were differentially expressed in pair-wise comparisons between time points. We observed the rapid induction of key defense related genes, including catalases, chitinases, lipoxygenases, peroxidases, and protease inhibitors within 1 dpi, suggesting detection of the pathogen by the host. Co-expression network analyses revealed transcriptional networks with distinct patterns of expression including down-regulation at 2 dpi of known defense response genes suggesting coordinated suppression of host responses by the pathogen. Comparative analyses of cucumber gene expression patterns with that of orthologous Arabidopsis thaliana genes following challenge with Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis revealed correlated expression patterns of single copy orthologs suggesting that these two dicot hosts have similar transcriptional responses to related pathogens. In total, the work described herein presents an in-depth analysis of the interplay between host susceptibility and pathogen virulence in an agriculturally important pathosystem."

These include cell growth, proliferation, and differentiation. Although both kinase-dependent and -independent functions of mTOR are known to be critical modulators of muscle cell differentiation and regeneration, the signaling mechanisms regulating mTOR activity during differentiation are still unclear. In this study we identify a novel mTOR interacting protein, the ubiquitin-specific protease USP9X, which acts as a negative regulator of mTOR activity and muscle differentiation. USP9X can co-immunoprecipitate mTOR with both Raptor and Rictor, components of mTOR complexes 1 and 2 (mTORC1 and -2), respectively, suggesting that it is present in both mTOR complexes. Knockdown of USP9X leads to increased mTORC1 activity in response to growth factor stimulation. Interestingly, upon initiation of differentiation of C2C12 mouse skeletal myoblasts, knockdown of USP9X increases mTORC2 activity. This increase in mTORC2 activity is accompanied by accelerated differentiation of myoblasts into myotubes.

Supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-BAX antibody. Cells were cultured on glass coverslips. For staining mitochondria, the cells were incubated in serum-free growth medium containing 100 nm MitoTracker Red CMXRos (Molecular Probes) for 30 min at 37 °C. Cells were then washed with complete growth medium, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min, and permeabilized in 1% BSA-supplemented PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min at 25 °C. The fixed cells were incubated overnight with anti-BAX antibody at 4 °C and then with Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibody (Invitrogen). Nuclei were stained with 1 mg/ml DAPI (Invitrogen). After mounting the coverslips, images were captured with a Yokogawa spinning disk confocal microscope. Cells were incubated with propidium iodide and Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated annexin V (Invitrogen) and analyzed by flow cytometry. The MUC1-C subunit blocks the apoptotic response to diverse forms of stress (15Ren J. Agata N. Chen D. Li Y. Yu W.H. Huang L. Raina D. Chen W. Kharbanda S. Kufe D.

To determine whether MUC1-C interacts with the pro-apoptotic BAX protein, lysates from MCF-7 breast cancer cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-BAX antibody. The results from immunoblot analysis of the precipitates with an antibody against MUC1-C supported the association of these proteins (Fig. 1A). Similar results were obtained when analyzing lysates from ZR-75-1 breast cancer cells (Fig. 1B). These co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed with lysates prepared in the presence of the non-ionic Nonidet P-40 detergent. However, previous studies indicated that BCL-2 family members can engage in spurious interactions in non-ionic detergents (32Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. Nonionic detergents induce dimerization among members of the Bcl-2 family.J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 13829-13834Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (512) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the association between MUC1-C and BAX was confirmed using lysates prepared in the zwitterionic detergent CHAPS (Fig. 1C). BAX is maintained in the cytosol (33Edlich F. Banerjee S. Suzuki M. Cleland M.M. Arnoult D. Wang C. Neutzner A. Tjandra N. Youle R.J. Bcl-xL retrotranslocates Bax from the mitochondria into the cytosol.Cell. 2011; 145: 104-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). Analysis of the cytosolic fraction from MCF-7 cells further demonstrated the association between MUC1-C and BAX (Fig. 1D). Moreover, in pulldown experiments, incubation of the cytoplasmic fraction with MUC1-CD fused to GST demonstrated binding with BAX (Fig. 1E). To determine whether MUC1-C interacts with activated BAX in the response to stress, we treated ZR-75-1 cells with the genotoxic agent DOX. DOX treatment was associated with a modest increase in MUC1-C·BAX complexes (Fig. 2A). Similar results were obtained in the response to H2O2 (Fig. 2A). In mitochondrially mediated apoptosis, BAX undergoes a conformational change that can be detected with anti-BAX antibody 6A7 (34Hsu Y.T. Youle R.J. Bax in murine thymus is a soluble monomeric protein that displays differential detergent-induced conformations.J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 10777-10783Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (444) Google Scholar). Lysates from control and DOX-treated ZR-75-1 cells were thus immunoprecipitated with anti-BAX antibody 6A7. Analysis of the precipitates demonstrated that MUC1-C associated with activated BAX and that this interaction was induced by DOX exposure (Fig. 2B). Treatment of ZR-75-1 cells with hydrogen peroxide was also associated with increases in complexes of MUC1-C and activated BAX (Fig. 2C). The cytosolic form of BAX is targeted to mitochondria in the response to stress (33Edlich F. Banerjee S. Suzuki M. Cleland M.M. Arnoult D. Wang C. Neutzner A. Tjandra N. Youle R.J. Bcl-xL retrotranslocates Bax from the mitochondria into the cytosol.Cell. 2011; 145: 104-116Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (439) Google Scholar). In this context, co-immunoprecipitation analysis of purified mitochondria from DOX-treated cells further supported an interaction between MUC1-C and activated BAX (Fig. 2D). These findings indicate that MUC1-C associates with BAX in both the cytosol and mitochondria. To determine whether MUC1-CD binds directly to BAX, we incubated GST-MUC1-CD with recombinant purified BAX. The finding that GST-MUC1-CD, but not GST, bound to BAX indicated that the association was direct (Fig. 3A, left). These results were confirmed by demonstrating that GST-BAX bound directly to purified MUC1-CD (Fig. 3A, right). MUC1-CD is 72 aa in length (Fig. 3B). Binding studies demonstrated that MUC1-CD aa 1–45, and not aa 46–72, confer the interaction with BAX (Fig. 3C). MUC1-CD contains a CQC motif (aa 1–3) that was considered as a potential site for binding to BAX. Indeed, mutation of the MUC1-CD CQC motif to AQA completely abrogated the BAX interaction (Fig. 3D). In addition, mutation of the individual cysteine residues to alanine (AQC and CQA) indicated that both cysteines contribute to the formation of MUC1-CD·BAX complexes (Fig. 3D). These results support a model in which the interaction between MUC1-CD and BAX is mediated by disulfide bonds. To lend further support to such a model, the binding studies were performed in the presence of the reducing agent NAC to inhibit oxidative disulfide bond formation. The results demonstrated that NAC blocked binding of GST-MUC1-CD and BAX (Fig. 3E, left). Moreover, NAC inhibited the interaction between GST-BAX and MUC1-CD (Fig. 3E, right). BAX contains BH1–BH3 functional domains and a transmembrane domain (Fig. 4A). Deletion fragments encompassing BH3 (aa 1–90), BH1 (aa 91–130), and BH2 (aa 131–192) were purified to define the region responsible for the interaction with MUC1-CD (Fig. 4A). Binding studies demonstrated that, as found for full-length BAX(1–192), MUC1-CD formed complexes with BAX(1–90), but not BAX(91–130) or BAX(131–192) (Fig. 4B). Of note, preparations of both GST-BAX(1–192) and GST-BAX(1–90) contained degradation products as detected by Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 4B, lower), which would be expected to decrease reactivity with MUC1-CD. BAX(1–90) includes the BH3 domain; consequently, to determine whether the BH3 domain contributes to the interaction, we incubated full-length BAX(1–192) and MUC1-CD in the absence and presence of a BH3 peptide (aa 55–74, STKKLSECLKRIGDELDSNM) (35Polster B.M. Kinnally K.W. Fiskum G. BH3 death domain peptide induces cell type-selective mitochondrial outer membrane permeability.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 37887-37894Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The interaction between BAX(1–192) and MUC1-CD was blocked by the BH3 peptide (Fig. 4C, left). Moreover, the BH3 peptide blocked binding of BAX(1–90) to MUC1-CD (Fig. 4C, right). The BAX BH3 domain contains a cysteine residue at position 62 (Fig. 4D). Notably, mutation of BAX(1–90) at Cys-62 to Ala blocked the interaction with MUC1-CD (Fig. 4D). On the basis of these results, we synthesized a BH3 peptide in which Cys-62 was altered to Ala (C62A). In contrast to the wild-type BH3 peptide, which blocked binding of BAX(1–90) to MUC1-CD, the BH3(C62A) peptide had no apparent effect on these complexes (Fig. 4E). These results do not exclude the possibility that the C62A mutation causes a structural change in the BH3 domain that alters reactivity with MUC1-CD. Therefore, as a c"

Among the different forms of Aβ aggregates, low molecular weight species ranging between ∼2- and 50-mers, also called “soluble oligomers,” have emerged as the species responsible for early synaptic dysfunction and neuronal loss. Emerging evidence suggests that the neurotoxic oligomers need not be formed along the obligatory nucleation-dependant fibril formation pathway. In our earlier work, we reported the isolation of one such “off-pathway” 12–18-mer species of Aβ42 generated from fatty acids called large fatty acid-derived oligomers (LFAOs) (Kumar, A., Bullard, R.

Here, we report the physiochemical aspects of LFAO-monomer interactions as well as LFAO-LFAO associations in the presence of interfaces. We discovered that LFAOs are a replicating strain of oligomers that recruit Aβ42 monomers and quantitatively convert them into LFAO assemblies at the expense of fibrils, a mechanism similar to prion propagation. We also found that in the presence of hexane-buffer or chloroform-buffer interfaces LFAOs are able to associate with themselves to form larger but non-fibrillar aggregates. These results further support the hypothesis that low molecular weight oligomers can be generated via non-fibril formation pathways.

https://openalex.org/W2078829110,"Eyes Absents (EYA) are multifunctional proteins best known for their role in organogenesis. There is accumulating evidence that overexpression of EYAs in breast and ovarian cancers, and in malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, correlates with tumor growth and increased metastasis. The EYA protein is both a transcriptional activator and a tyrosine phosphatase, and the tyrosine phosphatase activity promotes single cell motility of mammary epithelial cells. Since EYAs are expressed in vascular endothelial cells and cell motility is a critical feature of angiogenesis we investigated the role of EYAs in this process. Using RNA interference techniques we show that EYA3 depletion in human umbilical vein endothelial cells inhibits transwell migration as well as Matrigel-induced tube formation. To specifically query the role of the EYA tyrosine phosphatase activity we employed a chemical biology approach. Through an experimental screen the uricosuric agents Benzbromarone and Benzarone were found to be potent EYA inhibitors, and Benzarone in particular exhibited selectivity towards EYA versus a representative classical protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1B. These compounds inhibit the motility of mammary epithelial cells over-expressing EYA2 as well as the motility of endothelial cells. Furthermore, they attenuate tubulogenesis in matrigel and sprouting angiogenesis in the ex vivo aortic ring assay in a dose-dependent fashion. The anti-angiogenic effect of the inhibitors was also demonstrated in vivo, as treatment of zebrafish embryos led to significant and dose-dependent defects in the developing vasculature. Taken together our results demonstrate that the EYA tyrosine phosphatase activity is pro-angiogenic and that Benzbromarone and Benzarone are attractive candidates for repurposing as drugs for the treatment of cancer metastasis, tumor angiogenesis, and vasculopathies."

However, in the absence of structural information, how these proteins communicate with each other cannot be fully delineated.

Each complex contains two DnaKs and two GrpEs, which is a stoichiometry that has not been found before. The long N-terminal GrpE α-helices stabilize the linker of DnaK in the complex. Furthermore, interactions between the DnaK substrate-binding domain and the N-terminal disordered region of GrpE may accelerate substrate release from DnaK. These findings provide molecular mechanisms for substrate binding, processing, and release during the Hsp70 chaperone cycle."

https://openalex.org/W2043620312,"Amyloid precursor protein (APP) plays a pivotal role in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis, but its normal physiological functions are less clear. Combined deletion of the APP and APP-like protein 2 (APLP2) genes in mice results in post-natal lethality, suggesting that APP performs an essential, if redundant, function during embryogenesis. We previously showed that injection of antisense morpholino to reduce APP levels in zebrafish embryos caused convergent-extension defects. Here we report that a reduction in APP levels causes defective axonal outgrowth of facial branchiomotor and spinal motor neurons, which involves disorganized axonal cytoskeletal elements. The defective outgrowth is caused in a cell-autonomous manner and both extracellular and intracellular domains of human APP are required to rescue the defective phenotype. Interestingly, wild-type human APP rescues the defective phenotype but APPswe mutation, which causes familial AD, does not. Our results show that the zebrafish model provides a powerful system to delineate APP functions in vivo and to study the biological effects of APP mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1978343649,"Background Rapid scale up of HIV treatment programs in sub-Saharan Africa has refueled the long-standing health policy debate regarding the merits and drawbacks of vertical and integrated system. Recent pilots of integrating outpatient and HIV services have shown an improvement in some patient outcomes but deterioration in waiting times, which can lead to worse health outcomes in the long run. Methods A pilot intervention involving integration of outpatient and HIV services in an urban primary care facility in Lusaka, Zambia was studied. Data on waiting time of patients during two seven-day periods before and six months after the integration were collected using a time and motion study. Statistical tests were conducted to investigate whether the two observation periods differed in operational details such as staffing, patient arrival rates, mix of patients etc. A discrete event simulation model was constructed to facilitate a fair comparison of waiting times before and after integration. The simulation model was also used to develop alternative configurations of integration and to estimate the resulting waiting times. Results Comparison of raw data showed that waiting times increased by 32% and 36% after integration for OPD and ART patients respectively (p<0.01). Using simulation modeling, we found that a large portion of this increase could be explained by changes in operational conditions before and after integration such as reduced staff availability (p<0.01) and longer breaks between consecutive patients (p<0.05). Controlling for these differences, integration of services, per se, would have resulted in a significant decrease in waiting times for OPD and a moderate decrease for HIV services. Conclusions Integrating health services has the potential of reducing waiting times due to more efficient use of resources. However, one needs to ensure that other operational factors such as staff availability are not adversely affected due to integration."
https://openalex.org/W1975702187,"Melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a G-protein-coupled receptor expressed in the hypothalamus where it controls feeding behavior. MC4R cycles constitutively and is internalized at the same rate in the presence or absence of stimulation by the agonist, melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-MSH). This is different from other G-protein-coupled receptors, such as β(2)-adrenergic receptor (β(2)AR), which internalizes more rapidly in response to agonist stimulation. Here, it is found that in immortalized neuronal Neuro2A cells expressing exogenous receptors, constitutive endocytosis of MC4R and agonist-dependent internalization of β(2)AR were equally sensitive to clathrin depletion. Inhibition of MC4R endocytosis by clathrin depletion decreased the number of receptors at the cell surface that were responsive to the agonist, α-MSH, by 75%. Mild membrane cholesterol depletion also inhibited constitutive endocytosis of MC4R by ∼5-fold, while not affecting recycling of MC4R or agonist-dependent internalization of β(2)AR. Reduced cholesterol did not change the MC4R dose-response curve to α-MSH, but it decreased the amount of cAMP generated per receptor number indicating that a population of MC4R at the cell surface becomes nonfunctional. The loss of MC4R function increased over time (25-50%) and was partially reversed by mutations at putative phosphorylation sites (T312A and S329A). This was reproduced in hypothalamic GT1-7 cells expressing endogenous MC4R. The data indicate that constitutive endocytosis of MC4R is clathrin- and cholesterol-dependent. MC4R endocytosis is required to maintain MC4R responsiveness to α-MSH by constantly eliminating from the plasma membrane a pool of receptors modified at Thr-312 and Ser-329 that have to be cycled to the endosomal compartment to regain function."
https://openalex.org/W2011886389,"Research has shown that self-reports of smoking during pregnancy may underestimate true prevalence. However, little is known about which populations have higher rates of underreporting. Availability of more accurate measures of smoking during pregnancy could greatly enhance the usefulness of existing studies on the effects of maternal smoking offspring, especially in those populations where underreporting may lead to underestimation of the impact of smoking during pregnancy.In this paper, we develop a statistical Monte Carlo model to estimate patterns of underreporting of smoking during pregnancy, and apply it to analyze the smoking self-report data from birth certificates in the state of Massachusetts. Our results illustrate non-uniform patterns of underreporting of smoking during pregnancy among different populations. Estimates of likely underreporting of smoking during pregnancy were highest among mothers who were college-educated, married, aged 30 years or older, employed full-time, and planning to breastfeed. The model's findings are validated and compared to an existing underreporting adjustment approach in the Maternal and Infant Smoking Study of East Boston (MISSEB).The validation results show that when biological assays are not available, the Monte Carlo method proposed can provide a more accurate estimate of the smoking status during pregnancy than self-reports alone. Such methods hold promise for providing a better assessment of the impact of smoking during pregnancy."

In Experiment 2, in which numerical cues were merely memorized without concurrent movement planning, this general increase of distance with cue size was not observed. The results of these experiments indicate that visual perception of near space is specifically affected by the costs of planned hand movements."
https://openalex.org/W1964170047,"Background Despite funding constraints for treatment programmes in Africa, the costs and economic consequences of routine laboratory monitoring for efficacy and toxicity of antiretroviral therapy (ART) have rarely been evaluated. Methods Cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted in the DART trial (ISRCTN13968779). Adults in Uganda/Zimbabwe starting ART were randomised to clinically-driven monitoring (CDM) or laboratory and clinical monitoring (LCM); individual patient data on healthcare resource utilisation and outcomes were valued with primary economic costs and utilities. Total costs of first/second-line ART, routine 12-weekly CD4 and biochemistry/haematology tests, additional diagnostic investigations, clinic visits, concomitant medications and hospitalisations were considered from the public healthcare sector perspective. A Markov model was used to extrapolate costs and benefits 20 years beyond the trial. Results 3316 (1660LCM;1656CDM) symptomatic, immunosuppressed ART-naive adults (median (IQR) age 37 (32,42); CD4 86 (31,139) cells/mm3) were followed for median 4.9 years. LCM had a mean 0.112 year (41 days) survival benefit at an additional mean cost of $765 [95%CI:685,845], translating into an adjusted incremental cost of $7386 [3277,dominated] per life-year gained and $7793 [4442,39179] per quality-adjusted life year gained. Routine toxicity tests were prominent cost-drivers and had no benefit. With 12-weekly CD4 monitoring from year 2 on ART, low-cost second-line ART, but without toxicity monitoring, CD4 test costs need to fall below $3.78 to become cost-effective (<3xper-capita GDP, following WHO benchmarks). CD4 monitoring at current costs as undertaken in DART was not cost-effective in the long-term. Conclusions There is no rationale for routine toxicity monitoring, which did not affect outcomes and was costly. Even though beneficial, there is little justification for routine 12-weekly CD4 monitoring of ART at current test costs in low-income African countries. CD4 monitoring, restricted to the second year on ART onwards, could be cost-effective with lower cost second-line therapy and development of a cheaper, ideally point-of-care, CD4 test."

MDA-MB-468LN (468LN), a variant of the MDA-MB-468GFP (468GFP) human breast cancer cell line, produces extensive lymphatic metastasis in nude mice. 468LN cells differentially express α9β1 integrin, a receptor for lymphangiogenic factors VEGF-C/-D. We explored whether (1) differential production of VEGF-C/-D by 468LN cells provides an autocrine stimulus for cellular motility by interacting with α9β1 and a paracrine stimulus for lymphangiogenesis in vitro as measured with capillary-like tube formation by human lymphatic endothelial cells (HMVEC-dLy); (2) differential expression of α9 also promotes cellular motility/invasiveness by interacting with macrophage derived factors; (3) stable knock-down of VEGF-D or α9 in 468LN cells abrogates lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in vivo in nude mice.A comparison of expression of cyclo-oxygenase (COX)-2 (a VEGF-C/-D inducer), VEGF-C/-D and their receptors revealed little COX-2 expression by either cells. However, 468LN cells showed differential VEGF-D and α9β1 expression, VEGF-D secretion, proliferative, migratory/invasive capacities, latter functions being stimulated further with VEGF-D. The requirement of α9β1 for native and VEGF-D-stimulated proliferation, migration and Erk activation was demonstrated by treating with α9β1 blocking antibody or knock-down of α9. An autocrine role of VEGF-D in migration was shown by its impairment by silencing VEGF-D and restoration with VEGF-D. 468LN cells and their soluble products stimulated tube formation, migration/invasiveness of HMVEC-dLy cell in a VEGF-D dependent manner as indicated by the loss of stimulation by silencing VEGF-D in 468LN cells. Furthermore, 468LN cells showed α9-dependent stimulation of migration/invasiveness by macrophage products. Finally, capacity for intra-tumoral lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic metastasis in nude mice was completely abrogated by stable knock-down of either VEGF-D or α9 in 468LN cells.Differential capacity for VEGF-D production and α9β1 integrin expression by 468LN cells jointly contributed to their lymphatic metastatic phenotype."
https://openalex.org/W2014815693,"Antimitotic spindle poisons are among the most important chemotherapeutic agents available. However, precocious mitotic exit by mitotic slippage limits the cytotoxicity of spindle poisons. The MAD2-binding protein p31(comet) is implicated in silencing the spindle assembly checkpoint after all kinetochores are attached to spindles. In this study, we report that the levels of p31(comet) and MAD2 in different cell lines are closely linked with susceptibility to mitotic slippage. Down-regulation of p31(comet) increased the sensitivity of multiple cancer cell lines to spindle poisons, including nocodazole, vincristine, and Taxol. In the absence of p31(comet), lower concentrations of spindle poisons were required to induce mitotic block. The delay in checkpoint silencing was induced by an accumulation of mitotic checkpoint complexes. The increase in the duration of mitotic block after p31(comet) depletion resulted in a dramatic increase in mitotic cell death upon challenge with spindle poisons. Significantly, cells that are normally prone to mitotic slippage and resistant to spindle disruption-mediated mitotic death were also sensitized after p31(comet) depletion. These results highlight the importance of p31(comet) in checkpoint silencing and its potential as a target for antimitotic therapies."
https://openalex.org/W1987784438,"Phospho-telokin is a target of elevated cyclic nucleotide concentrations that lead to relaxation of gastrointestinal and some vascular smooth muscles (SM). Here, we demonstrate that in telokin-null SM, both Ca(2+)-activated contraction and Ca(2+) sensitization of force induced by a GST-MYPT1(654-880) fragment inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase were antagonized by the addition of recombinant S13D telokin, without changing the inhibitory phosphorylation status of endogenous MYPT1 (the regulatory subunit of myosin light chain phosphatase) at Thr-696/Thr-853 or activity of Rho kinase. Cyclic nucleotide-induced relaxation of force in telokin-null ileum muscle was reduced but not correlated with a change in MYPT1 phosphorylation. The 40% inhibited activity of phosphorylated MYPT1 in telokin-null ileum homogenates was restored to nonphosphorylated MYPT1 levels by addition of S13D telokin. Using the GST-MYPT1 fragment as a ligand and SM homogenates from WT and telokin KO mice as a source of endogenous proteins, we found that only in the presence of endogenous telokin, thiophospho-GST-MYPT1 co-precipitated with phospho-20-kDa myosin regulatory light chain 20 and PP1. Surface plasmon resonance studies showed that S13D telokin bound to full-length phospho-MYPT1. Results of a protein ligation assay also supported interaction of endogenous phosphorylated MYPT1 with telokin in SM cells. We conclude that the mechanism of action of phospho-telokin is not through modulation of the MYPT1 phosphorylation status but rather it contributes to cyclic nucleotide-induced relaxation of SM by interacting with and activating the inhibited full-length phospho-MYPT1/PP1 through facilitating its binding to phosphomyosin and thus accelerating 20-kDa myosin regulatory light chain dephosphorylation."

To specifically address the role of the mitochondrial genome, we developed novel conplastic rat strains, i.e. strains with the same nuclear genome but a different mitochondrial genome. The new animals were named T2DN(mtFHH) and T2DN(mtWistar), where the acronym T2DN denotes their common nuclear genome (type 2 diabetic nephropathy (T2DN) rats) and mtFHH or mtWistar the origin of their mitochondria, Fawn Hooded Hypertensive (FHH) or Wistar rats, respectively. The T2DN(mtFHH) and T2DN(mtWistar) showed a similar progression of diabetes as determined by HbA1c, cholesterol, and triglycerides with normal blood pressure, thus enabling investigation of the specific role of the mitochondrial genome in cardiac function without the confounding effects of obesity or hypertension found in other models of diabetes. Echocardiographic analysis of 12-week-old animals showed no abnormalities, but at 12 months of age the T2DN(mtFHH) showed left ventricular remodeling that was verified by histology. Decreased complex I and complex IV but not complex II activity within the electron transport chain was found only in T2DN(mtFHH), which was not explained by differences in protein content. Decreased cardiac ATP levels in T2DN(mtFHH) were in agreement with a lower ATP synthetic capacity by isolated mitochondria. Together, our data provide experimental evidence that mtDNA sequence variations have an additional role in energetic heart deficiency. The mitochondrial DNA background may explain the increased susceptibility of certain T2DM patients to develop myocardial dysfunction."
https://openalex.org/W1982353429,"In all organisms, cell polarity is fundamental for most aspects of cell physiology. In many species and cell types, it is controlled by the evolutionarily conserved PAR-3, PAR-6 and aPKC proteins, which are asymmetrically localized at the cell cortex where they define specific domains. While PAR proteins define the antero-posterior axis of the early C. elegans embryo, the mechanism controlling their asymmetric localization is not fully understood. Here we studied the role of endocytic regulators in embryonic polarization and asymmetric division. We found that depleting the early endosome regulator RAB-5 results in polarity-related phenotypes in the early embryo. Using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, we observed that PAR-6 is localized at the cell cortex in highly dynamic puncta and depleting RAB-5 decreased PAR-6 cortical dynamics during the polarity maintenance phase. Depletion of RAB-5 also increased PAR-6 association with clathrin heavy chain (CHC-1) and this increase depended on the presence of the GTPase dynamin, an upstream regulator of endocytosis. Interestingly, further analysis indicated that loss of RAB-5 leads to a disorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and that this occurs independently of dynamin activity. Our results indicate that RAB-5 promotes C. elegans embryonic polarity in both dynamin-dependent and -independent manners, by controlling PAR-6 localization and cortical dynamics through the regulation of its association with the cell cortex and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton."

In this study, MPK38-induced PDK1 phosphorylation was examined to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms underlying phosphorylation-dependent regulation of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1 (PDK1) activity. The results showed that MPK38 interacted with and inhibited PDK1 activity via Thr354 phosphorylation. MPK38-PDK1 complex formation was mediated by the amino-terminal catalytic kinase domain of MPK38 and the pleckstrin homology domain of PDK1. This activity was dependent on insulin, a PI3K/PDK1 stimulator, as well as various apoptotic stimuli, including TNF-α, H2O2, thapsigargin, and ionomycin. MPK38 inhibited PDK1 activity in a kinase-dependent manner and alleviated PDK1-mediated suppression of TGF-β (or ASK1) signaling, probably via the phosphorylation of PDK1 at Thr354. In addition, MPK38-mediated inhibition of PDK1 activity was accompanied by the modulation of PDK1 binding to its positive and negative regulators, serine/threonine kinase receptor-associated protein and 14-3-3, respectively.

https://openalex.org/W2044034041,"Airway epithelial cells have been demonstrated to be accessory antigen presentation cells (APC) capable of activating T cells and may play an important role in the development of allergic airway inflammation of asthma. In asthmatic airways, loss of expression of the adhesion molecule integrin β4 (ITGB4) and an increase in Th2 inflammation bias has been observed in our previous study. Given that ITGB4 is engaged in multiple signaling pathways, we studied whether disruption of ITGB4-mediated cell adhesion may contribute to the adaptive immune response of epithelial cells, including their ability to present antigens, induce the activate and differentiate of T cells. We silenced ITGB4 expression in bronchial epithelial cells with an effective siRNA vector and studied the effects of ITGB4 silencing on the antigen presentation ability of airway epithelial cells. T cell proliferation and cytokine production was investigated after co-culturing with ITGB4-silenced epithelial cells. Surface expression of B7 homologs and the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II was also detected after ITGB4 was silenced. Our results demonstrated that silencing of ITGB4 resulted in impaired antigen presentation processes and suppressed T cell proliferation. Meanwhile, decrease in Th1 cytokine production and increase in Th17 cytokine production was induced after co-culturing with ITGB4-silenced epithelial cells. Moreover, HLA-DR was decreased and the B7 homologs expression was different after ITGB4 silencing. Overall, this study suggested that downregulation of ITGB4 expression in airway epithelial cells could impair the antigen presentation ability of these cells, which further regulate airway inflammation reaction in allergic asthma."
https://openalex.org/W1967611293,"Carbon monoxide oxidation activator (CooA) proteins are heme-based CO-sensing transcription factors. Here we study the ultrafast dynamics of geminate CO rebinding in two CooA homologues, Rhodospirillum rubrum (RrCooA) and Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans (ChCooA). The effects of DNA binding and the truncation of the DNA-binding domain on the CO geminate recombination kinetics were specifically investigated. The CO rebinding kinetics in these CooA complexes take place on ultrafast time scales but remain non-exponential over many decades in time. We show that this non-exponential kinetic response is due to a quenched enthalpic barrier distribution resulting from a distribution of heme geometries that is frozen or slowly evolving on the time scale of CO rebinding. We also show that, upon CO binding, the distal pocket of the heme in the CooA proteins relaxes to form a very efficient hydrophobic trap for CO. DNA binding further tightens the narrow distal pocket and slightly weakens the iron-proximal histidine bond. Comparison of the CO rebinding kinetics of RrCooA, truncated RrCooA, and DNA-bound RrCooA proteins reveals that the uncomplexed and inherently flexible DNA-binding domain adds additional structural heterogeneity to the heme doming coordinate. When CooA forms a complex with DNA, the flexibility of the DNA-binding domain decreases, and the distribution of the conformations available in the heme domain becomes restricted.

Heme proteins are well known to perform a variety of key biological functions, such as diatomic ligand transport and storage, electron transfer, and catalysis. A rapidly growing family of heme proteins, which act as sensors and regulators, has also recently emerged. These sensing and regulatory proteins perform a variety of biological functions by selectively responding to changes in the level of diatomic messenger molecules, such as CO, O2, or NO. When the messenger molecule binds to the sensory domain of the protein, it changes the activity of the protein, typically by altering the heme ligation and eventually inducing a global conformational change (1Roberts G.P.

Metal-containing sensor proteins sensing diatomic gas molecules.Dalton Trans. 2008; : 3137-3146Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). One prototype of heme protein sensors is the carbon monoxide oxidation activator (CooA). CooA is a prokaryotic CO-sensing transcription factor that regulates the expression of the genes necessary for the host bacterium to grow, using CO as the sole energy and carbon source (1Roberts G.P.

RrCooA is a homodimeric protein, where each monomer consists of an N-terminal effector-binding domain, enclosing a b-type heme, and a C-terminal DNA-binding domain, containing a classical helix-turn-helix motif (6Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Structure of the CO sensing transcription activator CooA.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The two domains are connected via a long helix (the C-helix) that serves as the dimerization interface (6Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Structure of the CO sensing transcription activator CooA.Nat. Struct.

The proximal side of the heme is ligated by His-77, and the distal side is ligated by the N-terminal Pro-2 of the opposite subunit of the dimer. The N-terminal Pro-2 ligand is displaced by CO binding, which activates the protein for DNA binding (2Aono S.

Comparison of the crystal structure of the “off” ferrous RrCooA with that of CAP in the “on” state (Fig. 1, A and B) provided the first glimpse of the range of global motions triggered by effector binding to each protein (6Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Structure of the CO sensing transcription activator CooA.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). This comparison indicated that the DNA-binding domain undergoes a very large reorientation relative to the effector-binding domain upon activation (6Lanzilotta W.N. Schuller D.J. Thorsteinsson M.V. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L. Structure of the CO sensing transcription activator CooA.Nat. Struct. Biol. 2000; 7: 876-880Crossref PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). The recently resolved structure of the apo-CAP supports this conclusion; it revealed that in the inactive apo-CAP, the two recognition helices are not solvent-exposed, although the two DNA-binding domains show multiple orientations relative to the effector-binding domain (10Sharma H. Yu S. Kong J. Wang J. Steitz T.A. Structure of apo-CAP reveals that large conformational changes are necessary for DNA binding.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

This model suggests that, upon CO binding, the conformational changes that rearrange the DNA-binding domain into the proper orientation for specific DNA binding are triggered by the sliding of the heme into an adjacent cavity along with a displacement of the C-helix toward the opposite heme. Recently, the crystal structure of the CO-bound form of a variant of ChCooA (LL-ChCooA) has been solved (9Borjigin M. Li H. Lanz N.D. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Poulos T.L.

The structure also shows an unexpected movement of the N-terminal region, displaced by CO, so that it is repositioned between the heme and the DNA-binding domains. The repositioned N-terminal region serves as a bridge between the two domains, which might be crucial to reorient the two DNA recognition F helices to the correct position for specific DNA binding. Nevertheless, because the structures of wild-type CooACO and its DNA-bound form have not yet been solved, many of the atomic level structural details for CO-mediated allosteric transition in the CooA family of proteins are still not fully understood.

In this study, we investigate the ultrafast dynamics of CO rebinding to different CooA complexes in order to better understand the activation mechanism of this very important class of proteins. We measured the effects of DNA binding as well as the removal of the DNA-binding domain on the geminate CO recombination kinetics in CooA. We observe that a distributed set of rates rather than a single exponential rate is a common kinetic property displayed by all CooA complexes. We show evidence that this is the consequence of a quenched (or slowly varying on the time scale of CO rebinding) distribution of heme conformations. We hypothesize that upon DNA binding, the inherently flexible DNA-binding domain becomes more ordered, as reflected by the observed reduction of the structural heterogeneity in the heme-binding domain. Finally, we discuss how the architecture of the heme environment reshapes the energy landscape of the protein by modulating the enthalpic and entropic barriers, allowing the protein to control the geminate recombination of CO to the heme. Heme proteins are evidently designed to ensure efficient geminate rebinding if the diatomic ligand has a functional purpose, such as CO binding to CooA. On the other hand, proteins can evolve to impede geminate rebinding if the diatomic ligand is adventitious or poisonous, as is the case for CO binding to myoglobin and hemoglobin.

Chem. 2006; 281: 11271-11278Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). The CO-CooA-DNA samples were then incubated at room temperature for 30 min. CooACO complexes in the presence of the nonspecific fragment of DNA λ gt11 (5′-TTGACACCAGACCAACTGGTAATG-3′ and 5′-CATTACCAGTTGGTCTGGTGTCAA-3′) were prepared following the same procedure. In all cases, the final concentration of the protein was 50 μm, and that of DNA was 200 μm. For each experiment, the sample was loaded into a 1-mm path length cell, and the absorption spectra were recorded before and after the experiment using a spectrophotometer (U-4100 Hitachi). All measurements were carried out at room temperature (T = 295 K). The temporal kinetic traces were measured using a two-color pump probe instrument that has been described in detail elsewhere (20Yu A. Ye X. Ionascu D. Cao W. Champion P.M.

Ultrafast dynamics of diatomic ligand binding to nitrophorin 4.J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2010; 132: 2811-2820Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). The instrument involves two Ti:sapphire regenerative amplifiers, both operating at 190 kHz, which are seeded by two synchronized Ti:sapphire oscillators: a master (Mira P, 76 MHz, 2.5 ps (full width at half-maximum)) and a slave (Mira F, 76 MHz, 100 fs (full width at half-maximum)). The output of the femtosecond regenerative amplifier (Coherent REGA9000) was focused in a 500-μm BBO crystal to generate the second harmonic at 403 nm. This beam was chopped at a rate of 2 kHz and used to pump the sample. The amplified picosecond output of a home-built tunable picosecond regenerative amplifier was doubled using a 2-mm BBO crystal. This beam was tuned to 438 nm and used as a probe. The two beams were then collinearly combined and focused in the sample using an achromatic lens with a 4-inch focal length. To refresh the sample, the two collinear beams were moved to scan a chosen area of the sample using an xy scanner. The time delay between the pump and probe pulses can be controlled electronically using a phase shifter in the synchrolock system (continuous scan from 0 to 16 ns). The timing jitter between the pump and probe pulses was ∼800 fs. The polarizations of the pump and the probe beam were set to the magic angle (∼54.7°) to eliminate rotational relaxation artifacts. After the sample, the pump was blocked using a long pass cut-off filter, and the transmitted probe light was detected by a photodiode connected to a lock-in amplifier. The CO dissociation rate constants (koff) were determined by rapidly mixing RrCooACO (or RrCooACO + DNA) with an equal volume of 10 mm potassium ferricyanide, and the time evolution of the absorption change at 422 nm was recorded by using a spectrophotometer (U-4100 Hitachi) in time scan mode. Fluorescence anisotropy-based DNA-binding assays have shown that RrCooA binds to its target PcooF promoter sequence with high affinity, only in the presence of CO (11Coyle C.M. Puranik M. Youn H.

Fig. 2 shows the CO geminate recombination kinetics to both RrCooA and truncated RrCooA, lacking the DNA-binding domain (18Kuchinskas M. Li H. Conrad M. Roberts G. Poulos T.L. The role of the DNA-binding domains in CooA activation.Biochemistry. 2006; 45: 7148-7153Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar), at room temperature. Note that the data are presented on a logarithmic scale. The figure also displays the CO rebinding kinetics to RrCooA in the presence of a PcooF DNA fragment (26 bp) as well as in the presence of a nonspecific piece of DNA (λ gt11). The λ gt11 has a length (24 bp) similar to that of PcooF and is used as a nonspecific DNA control (for the sequence, see “Experimental Procedures”). As can be seen in Fig. 2, the CO rebinding kinetics in RrCooA are non-exponential and occur on a subnanosecond time scale with high geminate yield. This agrees with previous measurements (15Kumazaki S. Nakajima H. Sakaguchi T. Nakagawa E. Shinohara H. Yoshihara K. Aono S.

Soc. 2001; 123: 10056-10062Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In the presence of the PcooF sequence, the kinetics are faster by a factor of 2–3, and the fraction of the photodissociated CO that escapes into the solvent is reduced from about 4% to less than 2%. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the CO geminate recombination kinetics in RrCooA are unchanged upon the addition of the λ gt11. Thus, the changes in the kinetic response, observed in the presence of the PcooF DNA fragment, reflect conformation changes around the heme induced by specific DNA binding. These changes are not simply due to the presence of DNA in solution. Another striking feature in Fig. 2 is that the CO geminate recombination kinetics in truncated RrCooA are very similar to those in the RrCooA-PcooF complex. This suggests that removal of the DNA-binding domain induces conformational changes in the heme domain of RrCooACO that are similar to those induced by DNA binding. ChCooACO also binds to the PcooF DNA sequence with high affinity (19Clark R.W. Lanz N.D. Lee A.J. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Burstyn J.N.

Fig. 3 displays the CO rebinding kinetics to ChCooA in the absence and presence of the PcooF sequence at two different salt concentrations. Here again, the kinetic trace of CO rebinding to ChCooA in the presence of the nonspecific DNA fragment (λ gt11) is presented as a control. The plots in Fig. 3 show that the geminate recombination of CO to ChCooA is also non-exponential. More than 98% of the photodissociated CO molecules have rebound within 10 ns. The kinetic response at longer times speeds up in the presence of target DNA, making the kinetic profile appear more homogeneous. As seen in the figure, this effect was found to be independent of salt concentration. A recent study has found that, surprisingly, NO binding to ChCooA results in a six-coordinate Fe(II)-NO species that binds the PcooF DNA sequence very tightly at room temperature (19Clark R.W. Lanz N.D. Lee A.J. Kerby R.L. Roberts G.P. Burstyn J.N. Unexpected NO-dependent DNA binding by the CooA homolog from Carboxydothermus hydrogenoformans.Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

Fig. 4 also displays the rebinding kinetics following photolysis of the internal ligand (the N-terminal amino group) in ferrous ChCooA. The rebinding of both of these ligands can be fit well (down to survival populations of 1% or less) by using a biexponential kinetic response function. Earlier work on NO binding kinetics to heme proteins and model systems has established that, unlike CO, NO rebinding does not depend on the heme “doming” coordinate and typically displays biexponential rather"
https://openalex.org/W1969409842,"Neuropeptide B/W receptor-1 (NPBWR1) is expressed in discrete brain regions in rodents and humans, with particularly strong expression in the limbic system, including the central nucleus of the amygdala. Recently, Nagata-Kuroiwa et al. reported that Npbwr1−/− mice showed changes in social behavior, suggesting that NPBWR1 plays important roles in the emotional responses of social interactions. The human NPBWR1 gene has a single nucleotide polymorphism at nucleotide 404 (404A>T; SNP rs33977775). This polymorphism results in an amino acid change, Y135F. The results of an in vitro experiment demonstrated that this change alters receptor function. We investigated the effect of this variation on emotional responses to stimuli of showing human faces with four categories of emotional expressions (anger, fear, happiness, and neutral). Subjects' emotional levels on seeing these faces were rated on scales of hedonic valence, emotional arousal, and dominance (V-A-D). A significant genotype difference was observed in valence evaluation; the 404AT group perceived facial expressions more pleasantly than did the 404AA group, regardless of the category of facial expression. Statistical analysis of each combination of [V-A-D and facial expression] also showed that the 404AT group tended to feel less submissive to an angry face than did the 404AA group. Thus, a single nucleotide polymorphism of NPBWR1 seems to affect human behavior in a social context."
https://openalex.org/W1983024157,"Selective protein degradation via the ubiquitin-26S proteasome is a major mechanism underlying DNA replication and cell division in all Eukaryotes. In particular, the APC/C (Anaphase Promoting Complex or Cyclosome) is a master ubiquitin protein ligase (E3) that targets regulatory proteins for degradation allowing sister chromatid separation and exit from mitosis. Interestingly, recent work also indicates that the APC/C remains active in differentiated animal and plant cells. However, its role in post-mitotic cells remains elusive and only a few substrates have been characterized.In order to identify novel APC/C substrates, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen using as the bait Arabidopsis APC10/DOC1, one core subunit of the APC/C, which is required for substrate recruitment. This screen identified DRB4, a double-stranded RNA binding protein involved in the biogenesis of different classes of small RNA (sRNA). This protein interaction was further confirmed in vitro and in plant cells. Moreover, APC10 interacts with DRB4 through the second dsRNA binding motif (dsRBD2) of DRB4, which is also required for its homodimerization and binding to its Dicer partner DCL4. We further showed that DRB4 protein accumulates when the proteasome is inactivated and, most importantly, we found that DRB4 stability depends on APC/C activity. Hence, depletion of Arabidopsis APC/C activity by RNAi leads to a strong accumulation of endogenous DRB4, far beyond its normal level of accumulation. However, we could not detect any defects in sRNA production in lines where DRB4 was overexpressed.Our work identified a first plant substrate of the APC/C, which is not a regulator of the cell cycle. Though we cannot exclude that APC/C-dependent degradation of DRB4 has some regulatory roles under specific growth conditions, our work rather points to a housekeeping function of APC/C in maintaining precise cellular-protein concentrations and homeostasis of DRB4."
https://openalex.org/W2029682647,"Species that differ in their social system, and thus in traits such as group size and dispersal timing, may differ in their use of resources along spatial, temporal, or dietary dimensions. The role of sociality in creating differences in habitat use is best explored by studying closely related species or socially polymorphic species that differ in their social system, but share a common environment. Here we investigate whether five sympatric Anelosimus spider species that range from nearly solitary to highly social differ in their use of space and in their phenology as a function of their social system. By studying these species in Serra do Japi, Brazil, we find that the more social species, which form larger, longer–lived colonies, tend to live inside the forest, where sturdier, longer lasting vegetation is likely to offer better support for their nests. The less social species, which form single-family groups, in contrast, tend to occur on the forest edge where the vegetation is less robust. Within these two microhabitats, species with longer-lived colonies tend to occupy the potentially more stable positions closer to the core of the plants, while those with smaller and shorter-lived colonies build their nests towards the branch tips. The species further separate in their use of common habitat due to differences in the timing of their reproductive season. These patterns of habitat use suggest that the degree of sociality can enable otherwise similar species to differ from one another in ways that may facilitate their co-occurrence in a shared environment, a possibility that deserves further consideration."

A cell line expressing the membrane-bound ADAM15 without its cytoplasmic tail, however, lost this anti-apoptotic property, suggesting a crucial role of the intracellular domain as a scaffold for recruitment of survival signal-transducing kinases. Accordingly, an enhanced phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397, Tyr-576, and Tyr-861 was detected upon genotoxic stress by camptothecin in ADAM15-transfected T/C28a4 cells, but not in transfectants expressing an ADAM15 mutant without the cytoplasmic tail. Accordingly, a specific binding of the cytoplasmic ADAM15 domain to the C terminus of FAK could be shown by mammalian two-hybrid, pulldown, and far Western studies. In cells expressing full-length ADAM15, a concomitant activation of Src at Tyr-416 was detected upon camptothecin exposure. Cells transfected with a chimeric construct consisting of the extracellular IL-2 receptor α-chain and the cytoplasmic ADAM15 domain were IL-2-stimulated to prove that the ADAM15 tail can transduce a percepted extracellular signal to enhance FAK and Src phosphorylation. Our studies further demonstrate Src binding to FAK but not a direct Src interaction with ADAM15, suggesting FAK as a critical intracellular adaptor for ADAM15-dependent enhancement of FAK/Src activation. Moreover, the apoptosis induction elicited by specific inhibitors (PP2, FAK 14 inhibitor) of FAK/Src signaling was significantly reduced by ADAM15 expression.

https://openalex.org/W2066150780,"In Bacillus subtilis, the ribosome-associated GTPase CpgA is crucial for growth and proper morphology and was shown to be phosphorylated in vitro by the Ser/Thr protein kinase PrkC. To further understand the function of the Escherichia coli RsgA ortholog, CpgA, we first demonstrated that its GTPase activity is stimulated by its association with the 30 S ribosomal subunit. Then the role of CpgA phosphorylation was analyzed. A single phosphorylated residue, threonine 166, was identified by mass spectrometry. Phosphoablative replacement of this residue in CpgA induces a decrease of both its affinity for the 30 S ribosomal subunit and its GTPase activity, whereas a phosphomimetic replacement has opposite effects. Furthermore, cells expressing a nonphosphorylatable CpgA protein present the morphological and growth defects similar to those of a cpgA-deleted strain. Altogether, our results suggest that CpgA phosphorylation on Thr-166 could modulate its ribosome-induced GTPase activity. Given the role of PrkC in B. subtilis spore germination, we propose that CpgA phosphorylation is a key regulatory process that is essential for B. subtilis development."

Little is known about cervical screening coverage or the prevalence of abnormal cytology among HIV-positive women in Ukraine, which has the most severe HIV epidemic in Europe.Poisson regression models were fitted to data from 1120 women enrolled at three sites of the Ukraine Cohort Study of HIV-infected Childbearing Women to investigate factors associated with receiving cervical screening as part of HIV care. All women had been diagnosed as HIV-positive before or during their most recent pregnancy. Prevalence of cervical abnormalities (high/low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions) among women who had been screened was estimated, and associated factors explored.Overall, 30% (337/1120) of women had received a cervical screening test as part of HIV care at study enrolment (median 10 months postpartum), a third (115/334) of whom had been tested >12 months previously. In adjusted analyses, women diagnosed as HIV-positive during (vs before) their most recent pregnancy were significantly less likely to have a screening test reported, on adjusting for other potential risk factors (adjusted prevalence ratio (APR) 0.62, 95% CI 0.51-0.75 p<0.01 for 1(st)/2(nd) trimester diagnosis and APR 0.42, 95% CI 0.28-0.63 p<0.01 for 3(rd) trimester/intrapartum diagnosis). Among those with a cervical screening result reported at any time (including follow-up), 21% (68/325) had a finding of cervical abnormality. In adjusted analyses, Herpes simplex virus 2 seropositivity and a recent diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis were associated with an increased risk of abnormal cervical cytology (APR 1.83 95% CI 1.07-3.11 and APR 3.49 95% CI 2.11-5.76 respectively).In this high risk population, cervical screening coverage as part of HIV care was low and could be improved by an organised cervical screening programme for HIV-positive women. Bacterial vaginosis testing and treatment may reduce vulnerability to cervical abnormalities."
https://openalex.org/W2110934163,"Many bacterial pathogens reorganize the host actin cytoskeleton during the course of infection, including enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC), which utilizes the effector protein EspF(U) to assemble actin filaments within plasma membrane protrusions called pedestals. EspF(U) activates N-WASP, a host actin nucleation-promoting factor that is normally auto-inhibited and found in a complex with the actin-binding protein WIP. Under native conditions, this N-WASP/WIP complex is activated by the small GTPase Cdc42 in concert with several different SH3 (Src-homology-3) domain-containing proteins. In the current study, we tested whether SH3 domains from the F-BAR (FCH-Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs) subfamily of membrane-deforming proteins are involved in actin pedestal formation. We found that three F-BAR proteins: CIP4, FBP17, and TOCA1 (transducer of Cdc42-dependent actin assembly), play different roles during actin pedestal biogenesis. Whereas CIP4 and FBP17 inhibited actin pedestal assembly, TOCA1 stimulated this process. TOCA1 was recruited to pedestals by its SH3 domain, which bound directly to proline-rich sequences within EspF(U). Moreover, EspF(U) and TOCA1 activated the N-WASP/WIP complex in an additive fashion in vitro, suggesting that TOCA1 can augment actin assembly within pedestals. These results reveal that EspF(U) acts as a scaffold to recruit multiple actin assembly factors whose functions are normally regulated by Cdc42."
https://openalex.org/W2172260302,"Non-melanoma skin cancers are one of the most common human malignancies accounting for 2-3% of tumors in the US and represent a significant health burden. Epidemiology studies have implicated Tp53 mutations triggered by UV exposure, and human papilloma virus (HPV) infection to be significant causes of non-melanoma skin cancer. However, the relationship between Tp53 and cutaneous HPV infection is not well understood in skin cancers. In this study we assessed the association of HPV infection and Tp53 polymorphisms and mutations in lesional specimens with squamous cell carcinomas.We studied 55 cases of histologically confirmed cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and 41 controls for the presence of HPV infection and Tp53 genotype (mutations and polymorphism).We found an increased number of Tp53 mutations in the squamous cell carcinoma samples compared with perilesional or control samples. There was increased frequency of homozygous Tp53-72R polymorphism in cases with squamous cell carcinomas, while the Tp53-72P allele (Tp53-72R/P and Tp53-72P/P) was more frequent in normal control samples. Carcinoma samples positive for HPV showed a decreased frequency of Tp53 mutations compared to those without HPV infection. In addition, carcinoma samples with a Tp53-72P allele showed an increased incidence of Tp53 mutations in comparison carcinomas samples homozygous for Tp53-72R.These studies suggest there are two separate pathways (HPV infection and Tp53 mutation) leading to cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas stratified by the Tp53 codon-72 polymorphism. The presence of a Tp53-72P allele is protective against cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, and carcinoma specimens with Tp53-72P are more likely to have Tp53 mutations. In contrast Tp53-72R is a significant risk factor for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma and is frequently associated with HPV infection instead of Tp53 mutations. Heterozygosity for Tp53-72R/P is protective against squamous cell carcinomas, possibly reflecting a requirement for both HPV infection and Tp53 mutations."
https://openalex.org/W1976099593,"Combinations of direct-acting anti-virals offer the potential to improve the efficacy, tolerability and duration of the current treatment regimen for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Viral entry represents a distinct therapeutic target that has been validated clinically for a number of pathogenic viruses. To discover novel inhibitors of HCV entry, we conducted a high throughput screen of a proprietary small-molecule compound library using HCV pseudoviral particle (HCVpp) technology. We independently discovered and optimized a series of 1,3,5-triazine compounds that are potent, selective and non-cytotoxic inhibitors of HCV entry. Representative compounds fully suppress both cell-free virus and cell-to-cell spread of HCV in vitro. We demonstrate, for the first time, that long term treatment of an HCV cell culture with a potent entry inhibitor promotes sustained viral clearance in vitro. We have confirmed that a single amino acid variant, V719G, in the transmembrane domain of E2 is sufficient to confer resistance to multiple compounds from the triazine series. Resistance studies were extended by evaluating both the fusogenic properties and growth kinetics of drug-induced and natural amino acid variants in the HCVpp and HCV cell culture assays. Our results indicate that amino acid variations at position 719 incur a significant fitness penalty. Introduction of I719 into a genotype 1b envelope sequence did not affect HCV entry; however, the overall level of HCV replication was reduced compared to the parental genotype 1b/2a HCV strain. Consistent with these findings, I719 represents a significant fraction of the naturally occurring genotype 1b sequences. Importantly, I719, the most relevant natural polymorphism, did not significantly alter the susceptibility of HCV to the triazine compounds. The preclinical properties of these triazine compounds support further investigation of entry inhibitors as a potential novel therapy for HCV infection."

The peptidomimetic LLP2A is a novel peptide receptor radiotherapy candidate for treating NHL that expresses the activated α4β1 integrin. Tumor-bearing dogs are an excellent model of human NHL with similar clinical characteristics, behavior, and compressed clinical course. Canine in vivo imaging studies will provide valuable biodistribution and affinity information that reflects a diverse clinical population of lymphoma. This may also help to determine potential dose-limiting radiotoxicity to organs in human clinical trials. To validate this construct in a naturally occurring model of NHL, we performed in-vivo molecular targeted imaging and biodistribution in 3 normal dogs and 5 NHL bearing dogs. 99mTc-LLP2A-HYNIC-PEG and 99mTc-LLP2A-HYNIC were successfully synthesized and had very good labeling efficiency and radiochemical purity. 99mTc-LLP2A-HYNIC and 99mTc-LLP2A-HYNIC-PEG had biodistribution in keeping with their molecular size, with 99mTc-LLP2A-HYNIC-PEG remaining longer in the circulation, having higher tissue uptake, and having more activity in the liver compared to 99mTc-LLP2A-HYNIC. 99mTc-LLP2A-HYNIC was mainly eliminated through the kidneys with some residual activity. Radioactivity was reduced to near-background levels at 6 hours after injection. In NHL dogs, tumor showed moderately increased activity over background, with tumor activity in B-cell lymphoma dogs decreasing after chemotherapy. This compound is promising in the development of targeted drug-delivery radiopharmaceuticals and may contribute to translational work in people affected by non-Hodgkin lymphoma."
https://openalex.org/W1990727867,"Background Follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and Anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) are utilized to differentiate between good and poor response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. Their respective roles in defining functional ovarian reserve remain, however, to be elucidated. To better understand those we investigated AMH and FSH per oocyte retrieved (AMHo and FSHo). Methodology/Principal Findings Three-hundred and ninety-six women, undergoing first in vitro fertilization cycles, were retrospectively evaluated. Women with oocyte yields >75th percentile for their age group were identified as high responders. In a series of logistic regression analyses, AMHo and FSHo levels were then evaluated as predictive factors for pregnancy potential in high responders. Patients presented with a mean age of 38.0±5.0 years, mean baseline FSH of 11.8±8.7 mIU/mL and mean AMH of 1.6±2.1 ng/mL. Those 88 women, who qualified as high responders, showed mean FSH of 9.7±6.5 mIU/mL, AMH of 3.1±3.1 ng/mL and oocyte yields of 15.8±7.1. Baseline FSH and AMH did not predict pregnancy in high responders. However, a statistically significant association between FSHo and pregnancy was observed in high responders, both after univariate regression (p = 0.02) and when adjusted for age, percentage of usable embryos, and number of embryos transferred (p = 0.03). Rate of useable embryos also significantly affected pregnancy outcome independently of FSHo (p = 0.01). AMHo was also associated with clinical pregnancy chances in high responders (p = 0.03) and remained significant when adjusted for usable embryos and number of embryos transferred (p = 0.04). Conclusions AMHo and FSHo are predictive of pregnancy potential in high responders, but likely reflect different responsibilities in recruitment and maturation of growing follicle cohorts."

In this work, we report on the functional characteristics and conformational diversities of Thermotoga maritima MutS2 (TmMutS2). Various biochemical features of the protein were demonstrated via diverse techniques such as scanning probe microscopy (SPM), ATPase assays, analytical ultracentrifugation, DNA binding assays, size chromatography, and limited proteolytic analysis. Dimeric TmMutS2 showed the temperature-dependent ATPase activity. The non-specific nicking endonuclease activities of TmMutS2 were inactivated in the presence of nonhydrolytic ATP (ADPnP) and enhanced by the addition of TmMutL. In addition, TmMutS2 suppressed the TmRecA-mediated DNA strand exchange reaction in a TmMutL-dependent manner. We also demonstrated that small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis of dimeric TmMutS2 exhibited nucleotide- and DNA-dependent conformational transitions. Particularly, TmMutS2-ADPnP showed the most compressed form rather than apo-TmMutS2 and the TmMutS2-ADP complex, in accordance with the results of biochemical assays. In the case of the DNA-binding complexes, the stretched conformation appeared in the TmMutS2-four-way junction (FWJ)-DNA complex. Convergences of biochemical- and SAXS analysis provided abundant information for TmMutS2 and clarified ambiguous experimental results."

This practice creates the potential for inequitable pricing where the medical service provider is also the retailer. We measured the variation in prices between cataract surgeons for the same IOL and associated testing. Methods We telephoned every cataract surgeon in Ontario, Canada, and asked their price for the most common type of specialty IOL as a prospective patient. We measured the total prices quoted and variation between providers. Results We contacted 404 ophthalmologists. There were 256 that performed cataract surgery but 127 offered the most commonly employed specialty IOL and would provide a price to patients over the telephone. We obtained prices from all 127 ophthalmologists. Prices for the same lens and associated testing varied substantially between ophthalmologists from $358 to $2790 (median $615, interquartile range $528–$915). There was variation in all components of the total out-of-pocket price, including the price for the IOL itself, charges for uninsured eye measurements, and non-specific supplemental fees. Conclusion Although cataract surgery is covered by public health insurance, some ophthalmologists charge much more than others for the same specialty IOL and associated testing. Greater access to price information and better regulatory control could help ensure patients receive fair value for out-of-pocket health expenses."
