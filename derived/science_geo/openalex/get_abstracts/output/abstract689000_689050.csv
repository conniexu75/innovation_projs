https://openalex.org/W4226090490,"Abstract Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant is highly transmissible with potential immune escape. We conducted a test-negative case–control study to evaluate mRNA-1273 vaccine effectiveness (VE) against infection and hospitalization with Omicron or Delta. The large, diverse study population included 26,683 SARS-CoV-2 test-positive cases with variants determined by S gene target failure status (16% Delta and 84% Omicron). The two-dose VE against Omicron infection at 14–90 days was 44.0% (95% confidence interval, 35.1–51.6%) but declined quickly. The three-dose VE was 93.7% (92.2–94.9%) and 86.0% (78.1–91.1%) against Delta infection and 71.6% (69.7–73.4%) and 47.4% (40.5–53.5%) against Omicron infection at 14–60 days and &gt;60 days, respectively. The three-dose VE was 29.4% (0.3–50.0%) against Omicron infection in immunocompromised individuals. The three-dose VE against hospitalization with Delta or Omicron was &gt;99% across the entire study population. Our findings demonstrate high, durable three-dose VE against Delta infection but lower effectiveness against Omicron infection, particularly among immunocompromised people. However, three-dose VE of mRNA-1273 was high against hospitalization with Delta and Omicron variants."

There is a pressing need to develop next-generation vaccine strategies for broader and long-lasting protection. Using adenoviral vectors (Ad) of human and chimpanzee origin, we evaluated Ad-vectored trivalent COVID-19 vaccines expressing spike-1, nucleocapsid, and RdRp antigens in murine models. We show that single-dose intranasal immunization, particularly with chimpanzee Ad-vectored vaccine, is superior to intramuscular immunization in induction of the tripartite protective immunity consisting of local and systemic antibody responses, mucosal tissue-resident memory T cells and mucosal trained innate immunity. We further show that intranasal immunization provides protection against both the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and two VOC, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351. Our findings indicate that respiratory mucosal delivery of Ad-vectored multivalent vaccine represents an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy to induce all-around mucosal immunity against current and future VOC.

Since its outbreak in Wuhan China in 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has globally infected 359 M people and claimed 5.6 M lives and counting. Besides general mitigation/infection control measures, the only effective way to control the pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is to establish herd immunity through vaccination (Fontanet and Cauchemez, 2020Fontanet A. Cauchemez S. COVID-19 herd immunity: where are we?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 583-584Crossref PubMed Scopus (250) Google Scholar; Jeyanathan et al., 2020Jeyanathan M. Afkhami S. Smaill F. Miller M.S. Lichty B.D. Xing Z. Immunological considerations for COVID-19 vaccine strategies.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Thus, based on a pandemic vaccine paradigm (Lurie et al., 2020Lurie N. Saville M. Hatchett R. Halton J. Developing Covid-19 vaccines at pandemic speed.N. Engl. J. Med. 2020; 382: 1969-1973Crossref PubMed Scopus (785) Google Scholar), there have been at least 100 vaccines tested in clinical trials and another 180 under preclinical development. These efforts have led a growing number of first-generation COVID-19 vaccines to receive emergency use authorization in various countries. Notably, several authorized vaccines are based on mRNA and adenoviral platforms to express the spike protein of the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and elicit neutralizing antibody responses following 1–2 intramuscular injections (Jeyanathan et al., 2020Jeyanathan M. Afkhami S. Smaill F. Miller M.S. Lichty B.D. Xing Z. Immunological considerations for COVID-19 vaccine strategies.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). The global rollout of COVID-19 vaccines has played a critical role in reducing viral transmission, hospitalizations, and deaths. However, since September 2020 there have been five SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs) emerged which are B.1.1.7 (UK, Alpha), B.1.351 (South Africa, Beta), P.1 (Brazil, Gamma), B.1.617.2 (India, Delta), and B.1.1.529 (South Africa, Omicron) (Andreano and Rappuoli, 2021Andreano E.

Will SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern affect the promise of vaccines?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21: 340-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar). While they all have multiple mutations in the spike protein, B.1.351, P.1, and B.1.1.529 harbor multiple mutations within the receptor-binding domain (RBD) that reduce their neutralization by antibodies present in convalescent or vaccine-induced sera (Chen et al., 2021Chen R.E.

Some B.1.617 sub-lineages also carry E484Q and L452R mutations that reduce antibody binding (Starr et al., 2021Starr T.N. Greaney A.J. Dingens A.S. Bloom J.D.

Of importance, several first-generation vaccines including ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Astra Zeneca/Oxford) (Madhi et al., 2021Madhi S.A. Baillie V. Cutland C.L. Voysey M. Koen A.L. Fairlie L. Padayachee S.D.

Effectiveness of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 vaccine against the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.N. Engl. J. Med. 2021; 385: 187-189Crossref PubMed Scopus (417) Google Scholar) have demonstrated reduced effectiveness in protecting from mild to moderate COVID-19 caused by B.1.351. Likewise, sera from those immunized with mRNA-1273 (Moderna) show reduced neutralization of B.1.351 (Shen et al., 2021Shen X. Tang H. Pajon R. Smith G. Glenn G.M. Shi W. Korber B. Montefiori D.C.

Thus, the emerging VOCs capable of escaping the immunity by first-generation vaccines constantly threaten to impede or disrupt the establishment and sustainability of vaccine-induced herd immunity (Aschwanden, 2021Aschwanden C. Five reasons why COVID herd immunity is probably impossible.Nature. 2021; 591: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar; Harvey et al., 2021Harvey W.T. Carabelli A.M. Jackson B. Gupta R.K.

Microbiol. 2021; 19: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). To meet the challenges from VOC and limited durability of first-generation vaccine-induced immunity, there is an urgent need to develop next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategies (Callaway and Ledford, 2021Callaway E. Ledford H. How to redesign COVID vaccines so they protect against variants.Nature. 2021; 590: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; Gupta, 2021Gupta R.K. Will SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern affect the promise of vaccines?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21: 340-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar; Jeyanathan et al., 2020Jeyanathan M. Afkhami S. Smaill F. Miller M.S. Lichty B.D. Xing Z. Immunological considerations for COVID-19 vaccine strategies.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Although updating the spike antigen to specific VOC represents one such strategy (Callaway and Ledford, 2021Callaway E. Ledford H. How to redesign COVID vaccines so they protect against variants.Nature. 2021; 590: 15-16Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar; Gupta, 2021Gupta R.K. Will SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern affect the promise of vaccines?.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2021; 21: 340-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar), it is cumbersome and expensive and requires selection of specific VOC sequence(s), which may result in inherently inaccurate prediction of antigenic drift, akin to current seasonal influenza vaccines. An alternative strategy is to develop recombinant viral-vectored multivalent vaccines amenable to respiratory mucosal immunization (Jeyanathan et al., 2020Jeyanathan M. Afkhami S. Smaill F. Miller M.S. Lichty B.D. Xing Z. Immunological considerations for COVID-19 vaccine strategies.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar). Besides the spike antigen, such vaccines express additional conserved SARS-CoV-2 antigens to broaden T cell immunity. Since antigenic changes in conserved, internal viral proteins that are the primary focus of T cell responses are rare/improbable in SARS-CoV-2 viruses including VOCs (Alter et al., 2021Alter G. Yu J. Liu J. Chandrashekar A. Borducchi E.N. Tostanoski L.H. McMahan K. Jacob-Dolan C. Martinez D.R.

Immunol. 2021; 6: eabj1750Crossref PubMed Scopus (177) Google Scholar), such multivalent vaccines do not require frequent updating while they can boost the spike-specific immunity induced by first-generation vaccines. Thus, these vaccines are expected to be effective against both ancestral and variants of SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, adenoviral vectors (Ad) delivered via the respiratory tract confer protection via eliciting mucosal-tissue-resident trained innate and adaptive immunity at the site of viral entry (Jeyanathan et al., 2020Jeyanathan M.

Unfortunately, to-date, there has been a paucity of next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategies capable of robust and durable protection against the ancestral strain and variants of SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we have developed and evaluated a next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy in murine models. Our vaccine is built upon adenoviral vectors of human (Tri:HuAd) or chimpanzee (Tri:ChAd) origin, expressing three SARS-CoV-2 antigens (spike protein 1, full-length nucleocapsid protein, and truncated polymerase), and is suitable for respiratory mucosal delivery. We show that single-dose intranasal, but not intramuscular, immunization, particularly with the Tri:ChAd vaccine, induces all-around respiratory mucosal immunity against both ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 VOC. Our study thus indicates that respiratory mucosal delivery of multivalent viral-vectored COVID-19 vaccine is an effective next-generation COVID-19 vaccine strategy. Currently approved recombinant first-generation COVID-19 vaccines only encode the spike (S) protein from the Wuhan-Hu-1 ancestral SARS-CoV-2 and were designed primarily to induce neutralizing antibodies following intramuscular injections, a strategy inadequate to combat VOC (Aschwanden, 2021Aschwanden C. Five reasons why COVID herd immunity is probably impossible.Nature. 2021; 591: 520-522Crossref PubMed Scopus (144) Google Scholar; Harvey et al., 2021Harvey W.T. Carabelli A.M. Jackson B. Gupta R.K.

Microbiol. 2021; 19: 409-424Crossref PubMed Scopus (781) Google Scholar). To develop next-generation adenoviral-vectored COVID-19 vaccines, we utilized human serotype 5 (Tri:HuAd) and chimpanzee serotype 68 (Tri:ChAd) adenoviral vectors. Our vaccines were constructed to include the full-length S1 domain of spike which contains the NTD and RBD and numerous T cell epitopes (Geers et al., 2021Geers D. Shamier M.C. Bogers S. den Hartog G. Gommers L. Nieuwkoop N.N. Schmitz K.S. Rijsbergen L.C. van Osch J.A.T.

The S1 was fused to the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG) transmembrane/trimerization domain (Figure 1A) to anchor it to the membrane and facilitate its trimerization and exosomal targeting for enhanced antibody responses (Bliss et al., 2020Bliss C.M.

To broaden T cell immunity against additional viral antigens, the full-length nucleocapsid (N) and truncated nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [RdRp]) proteins were included in vaccine design as a single polyprotein downstream of a porcine teschovirus 2A sequence (P2A) (Figure 1A). N is the most abundant viral protein rich in T cell epitopes in humans including convalescent COVID-19 patients (Altmann and Boyton, 2020Altmann D.M. Boyton R.J.

Prior to viral rescue, the transgene cassette was verified to be in-frame by Sanger sequencing, with translation initiating at the TpA signal sequence. Following virus rescue, amplification, and purification, A549 cells were transduced with Tri:HuAd or Tri:ChAd and transgene expression at the protein level was verified by western blot for S1-VSVG and Nucleocapsid:RdRp fusion proteins of expected sizes (Figure 1B). In anticipation of their further clinical evaluation, we assessed the safety of Tri:HuAd and Tri:ChAd during the acute phase following intramuscular (i.m.) or intranasal (i.n.) delivery in mice (Figure S1A). There was little change in body weight following single-dose i.m. or i.n. vaccination (Figure S1B). Regardless of immunization route or vaccine vector, there was no significant elevations in the lung or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) in either neutrophils (Figure S1C) or pro-inflammatory cytokines (Figure S1D), relative to naive controls. Furthermore, there was no indications of hepatic or renal toxicity based on alkaline phosphatase/alanine aminotransferase and creatinine, respectively (Figure S1E). These data support an overall satisfactory safety profile of Tri:HuAd and Tri:ChAd COVID-19 vaccines. Given the close relationship between spike-specific humoral responses and protective immunity (Huang et al., 2020Huang A.T. Garcia-Carreras B. Hitchings M.D.T. Yang B. Katzelnick L.C. Rattigan S.M.

Serum and BAL were collected from BALB/c mice 2 and 4 weeks post-immunization (Figure 1C). IgG responses against spike and RBD were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). While the control sera from i.m. or i.n. empty viral vector (HuAd:EV or ChAd:EV)-treated animals had little anti-spike/RBD IgG responses (Figures S2A and S2B), the magnitude of spike- and RBD-specific IgG responses for Tri:HuAd vaccine were higher in serum following i.n. immunization and sustained for at least 4 weeks (Figures 1D and 1E). Likewise, i.n. Tri:ChAd vaccine also induced significantly greater spike- and RBD-specific IgG responses in serum than i.m. delivery at 4 weeks (Figures 1D and 1E). Both i.m. and i.n. Tri:HuAd and Tri:ChAd vaccines also induced N-specific IgG responses in serum (Figure S2C). Since vaccine-associated enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) is potentially associated with Th2-biased immune responses to certain viral infection and has also been experimentally observed post-inactivated SARS-CoV-1 vaccination (Bournazos et al., 2020Bournazos S. Gupta A. Ravetch J.V. The role of IgG Fc receptors in antibody-dependent enhancement.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 633-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar; Jeyanathan et al., 2020Jeyanathan M. Afkhami S. Smaill F. Miller M.S. Lichty B.D. Xing Z. Immunological considerations for COVID-19 vaccine strategies.Nat. Rev. Immunol. 2020; 20: 615-632Crossref PubMed Scopus (447) Google Scholar), we determined the ratio of S-specific IgG2a/IgG1 antibodies as a surrogate of the Th1/Th2 immune response. Regardless of vaccine route or vector, no Th2-skewing of antibody responses was seen at either timepoint (Figure 1F). We next assessed the neutralizing capacity of serum antibodies 4 weeks post-immunization by a surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT) (Tan et al., 2020Tan C.W. Chia W.N. Qin X. Liu P. Chen M.I.-C. Tiu C. Hu Z. Chen V.C.-W. Young B.E. Sia W.R. et al.A SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus neutralization test based on antibody-mediated blockage of ACE2-spike protein-protein interaction.Nat. Biotechnol. 2020; 38: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). Whereas immunization route had no significant effect on the neutralizing potential of serum antibodies in Tri:HuAd-vaccinated animals (i.m. 6.1% ± 0.2% versus i.n. 11.92% ± 2.7%), i.n. Tri:ChAd generated antibody responses with markedly enhanced neutralizing potential (87.70% ± 2.3%) over that by i.m. route or by Tri:HuAd immunization (Figure 1G). To assess humoral responses at the respiratory mucosa, BAL fluids collected 4 weeks post-immunization with either trivalent vaccine were assessed for S-specific IgG. As expected, we were only able to reliably detect S-specific antibodies in the airway following i.n., but not i.m., immunization (Figure 1H). Of note, airway S-specific IgG responses following Tri:ChAd immunization almost doubled that by Tri:HuAd. We next assessed the durability of antibody responses at 8 weeks post-vaccination (Figure 1I). Overall, compared with 4 weeks data (Figures 1D and 1E), serum S- and RBD-specific IgG responses largely sustained following i.m. immunization and remained significantly higher following i.n. immunization with either vaccine (Figure 1J). Once again, the serum neutralization profile determined by sVNT at 8 weeks (Figure 1K) was similar to that at 4 weeks (Figure 1G), showing i.n. Tri:ChAd to induce the highest titers of neutralizing antibodies. Given the robust neutralizing capacity exhibited by serum from i.n. Tri:ChAd mice, we next tested it in a microneutralization (MNT) assay with live SARS-CoV-2. Congruent with the sVNT results, i.m. immunization with either vaccine afforded minimal neutralization against live SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1L). In contrast, while i.n. immunization with either vaccine increased their respective neutralization capacities, i.n. Tri:ChAd elicited superior neutralization capacity over Tri:HuAd counterpart (Figure 1L). Compared with 4 weeks BAL data (Figure 1H), anti-S IgG from the BAL fluid was somewhat increased at 8 weeks following i.n. immunization with higher levels induced by Tri:ChAd vaccine while i.m. immunization with either vaccine failed to induce anti-S IgG in the airway (Figure 1M). Moreover, significant amounts of anti-S IgA were detected only in the BAL of i.n. Tri:ChAd animals (Figure 1M). To examine the relationship of vaccine vector and immunization route to detectable antigen-experienced memory B cells in systemic lymphoid and local lung tissues, we tetramerized biotinylated RBD conjugated to a fluorochrome and probed for RBD-specific B cells by FACS (Hartley et al., 2020Hartley G.E. Edwards E.S.J. Aui P.M. Varese N. Stojanovic S. McMahon J. Peleg A.Y. Boo I. Drummer H.E.

A decoy tetramer was included during staining to gate out vector-specific B cells (Figure S3A). While all immunizations induced a detectable population of RBD-specific B cells in the spleen, i.n. Tri:ChAd induced significantly higher levels than i.n. Tri:HuAd (Figure 1N). In addition, only i.n. Tri:ChAd vaccine induced detectable RBD-specific B cells in the lung tissue (Figure 1N). The above data indicate that single-dose intranasal immunization, particularly with Tri:ChAd vaccine, induces superior functional humoral responses both systemically and locally in the lung over the intramuscular route. We next examined T cell responses with a focus on those within the airways. Besides antibodies, airway T cells play pivotal roles in immunity against coronaviruses (Jeyanathan et al., 2020Jeyanathan M. Afkhami"

Thus, deciphering the non-cell-autonomous effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for understanding the cellular and molecular disruption it elicits. Neurological and cognitive defects are among the least understood symptoms of COVID-19 patients, with olfactory dysfunction being their most common sensory deficit. Here, we show that both in humans and hamsters, SARS-CoV-2 infection causes widespread downregulation of olfactory receptors (ORs) and of their signaling components. This non-cell-autonomous effect is preceded by a dramatic reorganization of the neuronal nuclear architecture, which results in dissipation of genomic compartments harboring OR genes. Our data provide a potential mechanism by which SARS-CoV-2 infection alters the cellular morphology and the transcriptome of cells it cannot infect, offering insight to its systemic effects in olfaction and beyond."
https://openalex.org/W4221136084,"Recent research in medicinal chemistry has suggested that there is a correlation between an increase in the fraction of sp3 carbons-those bonded to four other atoms-in drug candidates and their improved success rate in clinical trials1. As such, the development of robust and selective methods for the construction of carbon(sp3)-carbon(sp3) bonds remains a critical problem in modern organic chemistry2. Owing to the broad availability of alkyl halides, their direct cross-coupling-commonly known as cross-electrophile coupling-provides a promising route towards this objective3-5. Such transformations circumvent the preparation of carbon nucleophiles used in traditional cross-coupling reactions, as well as stability and functional-group-tolerance issues that are usually associated with these reagents. However, achieving high selectivity in carbon(sp3)-carbon(sp3) cross-electrophile coupling remains a largely unmet challenge. Here we use electrochemistry to achieve the differential activation of alkyl halides by exploiting their disparate electronic and steric properties. Specifically, the selective cathodic reduction of a more substituted alkyl halide gives rise to a carbanion, which undergoes preferential coupling with a less substituted alkyl halide via bimolecular nucleophilic substitution to forge a new carbon-carbon bond. This protocol enables efficient cross-electrophile coupling of a variety of functionalized and unactivated alkyl electrophiles in the absence of a transition metal catalyst, and shows improved chemoselectivity compared with existing methods."
https://openalex.org/W4212878771,"Flexibility is a hallmark of memories that depend on the hippocampus. For navigating animals, flexibility is necessitated by environmental changes such as blocked paths and extinguished food sources. To better understand the neural basis of this flexibility, we recorded hippocampal replays in a spatial memory task where barriers as well as goals were moved between sessions to see whether replays could adapt to new spatial and reward contingencies. Strikingly, replays consistently depicted new goal-directed trajectories around each new barrier configuration and largely avoided barrier violations. Barrier-respecting replays were learned rapidly and did not rely on place cell remapping. These data distinguish sharply between place field responses, which were largely stable and remained tied to sensory cues, and replays, which changed flexibly to reflect the learned contingencies in the environment and suggest sequenced activations such as replay to be an important link between the hippocampus and flexible memory."
https://openalex.org/W4226335305,"The hippocampus is essential for different forms of declarative memory, including social memory, the ability to recognize and remember a conspecific. Although recent studies identify the importance of the dorsal CA2 region of the hippocampus in social memory storage, little is known about its sources of social information. Because CA2, like other hippocampal regions, receives its major source of spatial and non-spatial information from the medial and lateral subdivisions of entorhinal cortex (MEC and LEC), respectively, we investigated the importance of these inputs for social memory. Whereas MEC inputs to CA2 are dispensable, the direct inputs to CA2 from LEC are both selectively activated during social exploration and required for social memory. This selective behavioral role of LEC is reflected in the stronger excitatory drive it provides to CA2 compared with MEC. Thus, a direct LEC → CA2 circuit is tuned to convey social information that is critical for social memory."
https://openalex.org/W4213015374,"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is present in 1% of live births, yet identification of causal mutations remains challenging. We hypothesized that genetic determinants for CHDs may lie in the protein interactomes of transcription factors whose mutations cause CHDs. Defining the interactomes of two transcription factors haplo-insufficient in CHD, GATA4 and TBX5, within human cardiac progenitors, and integrating the results with nearly 9,000 exomes from proband-parent trios revealed an enrichment of de novo missense variants associated with CHD within the interactomes. Scoring variants of interactome members based on residue, gene, and proband features identified likely CHD-causing genes, including the epigenetic reader GLYR1. GLYR1 and GATA4 widely co-occupied and co-activated cardiac developmental genes, and the identified GLYR1 missense variant disrupted interaction with GATA4, impairing in vitro and in vivo function in mice. This integrative proteomic and genetic approach provides a framework for prioritizing and interrogating genetic variants in heart disease."
https://openalex.org/W4213068431,"Midbrain dopamine (mDA) neurons can be replaced in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) in order to provide long-term improvement in motor functions. The limited capacity for long-distance axonal growth in the adult brain means that cells are transplanted ectopically, into the striatal target. As a consequence, several mDA pathways are not re-instated, which may underlie the incomplete restoration of motor function in patients. Here, we show that viral delivery of GDNF to the striatum, in conjunction with homotopic transplantation of human pluripotent stem-cell-derived mDA neurons, recapitulates brain-wide mDA target innervation. The grafts provided re-instatement of striatal dopamine levels and correction of motor function and also connectivity with additional mDA target nuclei not well innervated by ectopic grafts. These results demonstrate the remarkable capacity for achieving functional and anatomically precise reconstruction of long-distance circuitry in the adult brain by matching appropriate growth-factor signaling to grafting of specific cell types."
https://openalex.org/W4212803837,"Synaptic NMDA receptors can produce powerful dendritic supralinearities that expand the computational repertoire of single neurons and their respective circuits. This form of supralinearity may represent a general principle for synaptic integration in thin dendrites. However, individual cortical neurons receive many diverse classes of input that may require distinct postsynaptic decoding schemes. Here, we show that sensory, motor, and thalamic inputs preferentially target basal, apical oblique, and distal tuft dendrites, respectively, in layer 5b pyramidal neurons of the mouse retrosplenial cortex, a visuospatial association area. These dendritic compartments exhibited differential expression of NMDA receptor-mediated supralinearity due to systematic changes in the AMPA-to-NMDA receptor ratio. Our results reveal a new schema for integration in cortical pyramidal neurons, in which dendrite-specific changes in synaptic receptors support input-localized decoding. This coexistence of multiple modes of dendritic integration in single neurons has important implications for synaptic plasticity and cortical computation."

B7H3, a T-cell coinhibitory molecule, is specifically overexpressed in breast cancer compared with normal breast tissue and benign lesions, making it an attractive therapeutic target. However, the mechanism by which B7H3 contributes to the cancer phenotype is unclear. Here we show that the expression of B7H3 is negatively related to the number of CD8+ T cells in breast tumor sites. In addition, analysis of the differentially expressed B7H3 reveals that it is inversely correlated to autophagic flux both in breast cancer cell lines and clinical tumor tissues. Furthermore, block of autophagy by bafilomycin A1 (Baf A1) increases B7H3 levels and attenuates CD8+ T cell activation, while promotion of autophagy by V9302, a small-molecule inhibitor of glutamine metabolism, decreases B7H3 expression and enhances granzyme B (GzB) production of CD8+ T cells via regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation. We demonstrate that combined treatment with V9302 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) enhances antitumor immunity in syngeneic mouse models. Collectively, our findings unveil the beneficial effect of V9302 in boosting antitumor immune response in breast cancer and illustrate that anti-PD-1 together with V9302 treatment may provide synergistic effects in the treatment of patients insensitive to anti-PD-1 therapy.

Patients’ survival was dramatically improved over the past 10 years, as available treatment modalities optimized, including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, targeted biological therapy, and immunotherapy. With the clinical success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in some cancer types, immunotherapy has now undergone a paradigm transition from “immune enhancement” strategy to “immune normalization” strategy. The enhancement strategy focuses on enhancing antitumor immune response by using IL-2, interferons (IFNs), and CAR-T cells. Normalization treatment strategy suggests removing tumor-induced immune-inhibitory molecules that inhibit antitumor immunity including PD-1, PD-L1, CTLA-4, etc. Despite immunotherapy, employing anti-PD-1/PD-L1 has been widespreadly utilized in multiple malignant tumors (2Sanmamed M.F.

In addition to these protumoral activities, B7H3 is being given an increasing amount of attention because of its immune-regulatory functions. It was initially reported as an immune stimulatory molecule and now is believed to act as an immune checkpoint ligand contributing to immune evasion (16Yang S. Wei W. Zhao Q. B7-H3, a checkpoint molecule, as a target for cancer immunotherapy.Int. J. Biol. Sci. 2020; 16: 1767-1773Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). It was reported that B7H3 blockade or deficiency augmented intratumoral CD8+ T-cells infiltration and suppressed tumor growth. Combining anti-B7H3 with PD-1 blockade showed a much better antitumoral effect than monotherapy (17Yonesaka K. Haratani K. Takamura S. Sakai H. Kato R. Takegawa N. Takahama T. Tanaka K. Hayashi H.

Washington M. et al.Pharmacological blockade of ASCT2-dependent glutamine transport leads to antitumor efficacy in preclinical models.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). However, whether V9302 can inhibit breast cancer progression and sensitize low immunogenic breast cancer to immunotherapy is still an open question. Since B7H3 is highly expressed in breast cancer tissues, we studied the relationship between B7H3 expression and CD8+ T-cell activation and infiltration in the breast tumor microenvironment (TME). Furthermore, we investigated the role of Gln metabolism antagonist V9302 in decreasing B7H3 expression and its function in restoration of antitumor immune response in combination with anti-PD-1 mAb. To identify if B7H3 expression affects the immune environment of breast cancer, we first quantified CD8+T cells and T effector memory (Tem) cells in each breast cancer tissue from Curtis database by estimating gene expression data using xCell algorithm. Patients were stratified by ER status into ER+ and ER− subgroups. The composition of CD8+ T cells infiltration was negatively related to the expression of B7H3 mRNA in both subgroups. The same trend was also observed in Tem cells (Fig. S1, A and B). These results inspired us to further investigate the relationship between B7H3 and CD8+ T-cells content in tumor tissues of patients from our clinical core. The clinicopathological status of patients with breast cancer is described in detail in Table S1. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) images showed CD8 positive cell number was higher in low B7H3 expression subgroup divided by the cutoff value of median B7H3 IHC score and vice versa (p = 0.002) (Fig. 1, A, B, and D). The analysis of the online public dataset together with data from our clinical core both suggested B7H3 might influence the content of CD8+ T cells in breast tumor sites. To clarify the potential mechanism contributing to differential expression of B7H3, we found that B7H3 level was inversely related to the formation of autophagosome as marked by LC3-II dots. We divided patients into LC3-dotsmore and LC3-dotsless subgroups by the median number of LC3-II dots, and tumor tissues in LC3-dotsmore subgroup had a lower level of B7H3 expression (p = 0.026) (Fig. 1, B, C, and E). Based on these observations, we assumed B7H3 expression regulated by autophagy pathway participated in immune cells infiltration in breast cancer. Autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved cellular recycling process, which involves the sequestration of target proteins and organelles in autophagosomes and subsequent delivery of the cargo to lysosomes for degradation. Lipidated LC3, also known as LC3-II, is a molecular marker of the autophagosome, which is essential for autophagosome formation and p62 recruitment to the autophagosomes. After interacting with LC3-II, p62 links cargos to the autophagic machinery to enable their degradation in the lysosome (27Levy J.M.M. Towers C.G. Thorburn A. Targeting autophagy in cancer.Nat. Rev. Cancer. 2017; 17: 528-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (1166) Google Scholar). We observed human breast cancer cell lines expressed different levels of LC3-II and B7H3 protein. Interestingly, we found that BT-474 expressed less total B7H3, while stained higher autophagy marker protein LC3-II compared with MCF-7 and T47D in ER+ breast cancer cell lines. Similarly, MDA-MB-231 expressed less B7H3 and more LC3-II than BT-549 in ER− breast cancer cell lines (Fig. 2A). Gene expression pattern of B7H3 and LC3-II was consistent with the result from IHC staining of clinical sections (Fig. 1, B and C), suggesting that B7H3 expression was negatively related to the level of autophagy. Furthermore, we detected the localization of B7H3 in breast cancer cells and found besides expressing on the cell membrane as B7H3 is a transmembrane protein, it also exhibited a punctate cytoplasmic distribution colocalized with autophagosomes and lysosomes marked by LC3-II and LAMP1, respectively (Fig. 2B). Next, we investigated if B7H3 degraded via autophagy pathway. Because the steady-state levels of autophagosomes reflect the difference in the amount of LC3-II generation and degradation, Baf A1 is usually used to demonstrate the total LC3-II synthesis by inhibiting autolysosome acidification and autophagosome–lysosome fusion. We found that application of autophagy inhibitor Baf A1 resulted in the accumulation of LC3-II and B7H3 proteins and increase of B7H3+-cell abundance in MCF-7 and BT-474 cells (Fig. 2, C and D), indicating B7H3 was actively routed to the lysosome for degradation. Since B7H3 has been reported to be associated with reduced T-cell activation and low density of TILs in TME, we examined whether Baf A1 treatment mitigated the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)-mediated antitumor reaction by using flow cytometer. The results showed CD8+ T cells primed by Baf A1 treated MCF-7 or BT474 cell lysate-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) markedly decreased granzyme B (GzB) production and CD69 expression than that primed by untreated cells lysate-pulsed DCs (Fig. 2, E and F). Collectively, these data suggested that B7H3 was degraded by the autophagy–lysosomal degradation pathway in breast cancer cells, and block of autophagy inhibited CD8+ T-cell activation. V9302 was reported to decrease cell growth, increase cell apoptosis, promote reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and modulate autophagy in multiple types of cancer cells (26Schulte M. Fu A. Zhao P. Li J. Geng L. Smith S. Kondo J. Coffey R. Johnson M. Rathmell J. Sharick J. Skala M. Smith J. Berlin J. Washington M. et al.Pharmacological blockade of ASCT2-dependent glutamine transport leads to antitumor efficacy in preclinical models.Nat. Med. 2018; 24: 194-202Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). We therefore investigated whether V9302-induced autophagy controls B7H3 expression and the following antitumor immune response. Consistent with previous studies, we also found that V9302 inhibited MCF-7 and BT-474 cell viability (Figs. 3, A and B and S2, A and B) and cell proliferation (Figs. 3C and S2C) in a concentration and time-dependent manner, with the inhibitory rate around 30% and 40%, respectively, at the concentration of 2 μg/ml. In addition, V9302-promoted cell apoptotic with the percentage of apoptosis cells increased about tenfold at the concentration of 2 μg/ml when comparing with control cells (Figs. 3D and S2D), and cleaved caspase-3 (only detected in BT-474 cells) and PARP (detected in both cell lines) was elevated with increasing concentration of V9302 (Figs. 3E and S2E). In addition, V9302 exposure in MCF-7 and BT-474 cells led to a significantly increased level of intracellular ROS (Figs. 3F and S2F). Cancer cells deprived of nutrition supply by glutamine metabolism inhibitor tend to initiate autophagy to maintain tumor survival, and accumulated ROS can also induce autophagy. We then examined V9302-triggered autophagy in breast cancer cells. Western blot revealed that the LC3-II level was elevated in MCF-7 cells treated with V9302 (Fig. 3G), with the accompanied reduction of B7H3 expression and B7H3-positive cells abundance in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 3, G and H). Similar results were also observed in BT-474 (Fig. S2, G and H). However, application of Baf A1 inhibited V9302-induced B7H3 degradation (Fig. S3A). To exclude V9302-reduced B7H3 expression by transcriptional regulation or other protein degradation mechanisms, we assessed mRNA expression of B7H3 by qPCR in the presence of V9302 and found that V9302 had little effects on B7H3 mRNA expression (Fig. S3B). The proteasome inhibitor MG132 promotes accumulation of target proteins, which are degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. Next, we blocked the proteolytic activity by using MG132 and observed that the protein level of B7H3 was significantly enhanced, indicating that partially B7H3 protein degrades via proteasome pathway. However, MG132 didn’t restore B7H3 expression when treated with V9302 (Fig. S3C), indicating that V9302 induced degradation of B7H3 mainly through autophagy pathway but not proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we investigated whether decreased B7H3 exerted by V9302 treatment could also influence the functions of CTLs that were generated by incubating CD8+ T cells with mature DCs pulsed with tumor lysates. We observed that V9302 exposure enhanced the production of GzB and CD69 expression of CTLs in both MCF-7 and BT-474 models (Figs. 3, I and J and S2, I and J). Collectively, these results suggested that V9302 not only influenced cell proliferation and apoptosis, but also enhanced antitumor immunity by downregulating B7H3 expression via increased autophagy. ROS is a key regulatory factor of autophagy in various types of cancers, which induces autophagy by regulating mTOR, MAPK signaling, and p53 pathway (28Signorelli S. Tarkowski L.P. Van den Ende W. Bassham D.C. Linking autophagy to abiotic and biotic stress responses.Trends Plant Sci. 2019; 24: 413-430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). Moreover, Gln deficiency was reported to activate ROS by JAK2/STAT3 pathway (29Mehazri L. Shpungin S. Bel S. Nir U. Loss of fer jeopardizes metabolic plasticity and mitochondrial homeostasis in lung and breast carcinoma cells.Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2021; 22: 3387Crossref PubMed Scopus (1) Google Scholar). To determine whether V9302-regulated autophagy was due to excessive ROS accumulation, we used NAC, which can easily penetrate the cell membrane directly to neutralize ROS. We found that ROS neutralization reversed V9302-induced cell viability and proliferation decrease, apoptosis, and ROS production (Fig. 4, A–E). In addition, ROS blockade with NAC prevented V9302-induced LC3-II synthesis, B7H3 degradation and restored B7H3-positive cells percentage (Fig. 4, F and G). To probe V9302-enhanced CD8+ CTLs activation through regulating ROS-autophagy-B7H3 axis, we collected cell lysate from MCF-7 by 5 to 6 freeze–thaw cycles after exposure to 0, 1, and 2 μg/ml V9302 with or without NAC. Then, we activated CD8+T cells with DCs stimulated by differently treated cell lysate and found that NAC decreased GzB and CD69 expression on CD8+ CTLs (Fig. 4, H and I). Collectively, these results suggested that ROS neutralization not only influences the cell proliferation and death regulated by V9302, but also diminished antitumor immunity promoted by V9302 via ROS-autophagy-B7H3 pathway. Despite the enormous successes of anti-PD-1/PD-L1 immunotherapy in multiple cancers, the overall response rates of breast cancer remain suboptimal. Blockade of B7H3 was reported to exert potent therapeutic effects and can sensitize anti-PD-1 therapy in multiple mouse tumor models. To probe if V9302 might sensitize breast cancer to PD-1 antibody, we orthotopically implanted EO771 and 4T1 mammary breast tumor cells into mice fat pad to establish syngeneic murine models. It was reported that EO771 tumors are ER weakly positive (Fig. S4) (30Ewens A. Mihich E. Ehrke M.J. Distant metastasis from subcutaneously grown E0771 medullary breast adenocarcinoma.Anticancer Res. 2005; 25: 3905-3915PubMed Google Scholar, 31Clarke R. Jones B.C. Sevigny C.M. Hilakivi-Clarke L.A.

EO771, is it a well-characterized cell line for mouse mammary cancer model? Limit and uncertainty.Cancer Med. 2020; 9: 8074-8085Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar) and 4T1 tumors are highly immunosuppressive (33Zhou F. Wang M. Luo T. Qu J. Chen W.R. Photo-activated chemo-immunotherapy for metastatic cancer using a synergistic graphene nanosystem.Biomaterials. 2021; 265: 120421Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Experimental mice were divided into four groups, receiving IgG (10 mg/kg ip.), anti-PD-1 antibody (10 mg/kg ip.), V9302 (75 mg/kg ip.), or anti-PD-1 antibody plus V9302 for 2 weeks, respectively. Anti-PD-1 alone exhibited no antitumoral activity in EO771 syngeneic model, while it slightly suppressed tumor growth in 4T1 model. V9302 fractionally limited tumor growth as a single agent in both mouse models. Interestingly, it was noticed that the combination of anti-PD-1 antibody and V9302 significantly inhibited tumor growth, especially in EO771 mouse model (Figs. 5, A–C and S5, A–C). Additionally, immunofluorescent staining demonstrated that V9302 plus anti-PD-1 therapy resulted in remarkably enhanced apoptosis of tumor cells denoted as Tunel+ cells in the tumor grafts than that of anti-PD-1 or V9302 monotherapy tumor tissues (Figs. 5D and S5D). These results demonstrated that V9302 sensitized breast cancer to anti-PD-1 therapy. To investigate the mechanisms of V9302-sensitized breast cancer to anti-PD-1, we collected EO771 and 4T1 allografts treated as described above. As our in vitro experiments had proved that V9302 employment downregulates B7H3 level via modulating autophagy, and therefore enhancing antitumor immunity, we first detected autophagic flux by immunofluorescence immunostaining. The results revealed that anti-PD-1 had little effect on autophagosome formation, while V9302 promoted autophagy as a single agent. Anti-PD-1 combined with V9302 showed no more LC3-II marked autophagosome than V9302 alone in EO771 model (Fig. 6A). Similar results were observed in 4T1 tumors, except for anti-PD-1, which had a faintly inhibitory effect on autophagosome formation (Fig. S6A). Next, we assessed surface B7H3 levels by flow cytometry and total B7H3 expression by immunofluorescence and observed that V9302 decreased surface and total B7H3 expression in both mice models, while anti-PD-1 mildly increased surface B7H3 expression. When combined with V9302, anti-PD-1-triggered B7H3 upregulation was abolished (Figs. 6, B and C and S6, B and C). Previous studies indicated that majority of breast cancer patients did not benefit from anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, which might be associated with a low level of TILs or CD8+ T-cells infiltration (34Loi S.

This study aimed to assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and associated factors among patients with T2DM at a tertiary care hospital in Ethiopia. Methods A face-to-face cross-sectional survey was conducted among patients with T2DM at Tikur Anbessa Specialized Hospital in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. We collected data using a validated Amharic version of the 5-level EuroQoL-5 dimensions (EQ-5D-5L) questionnaire. Descriptive statistics were used to present patient characteristics. Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests were performed to explore differences in the median scores of EQ-5D-5L utility and visual analog scale (EQ-VAS). Multivariable Tobit regression models were used to identify predictors of HRQoL. Utility scores were calculated using disutility weights of the Ethiopian general population. Statistical significance was determined at p &lt; 0.05. Results A total of 360 patients with T2DM participated. Mean (SD) age was 64.43(10.61) years. Reported health problems were mostly in the pain/discomfort (67.3%) dimension followed by mobility (60.5%), whereas the usual activities domain (34.1%) was the least health problem being reported. The median (IQR) EQ-5D-5L utility and EQ-VAS scores were 0.95 (0.88–0.96) and 80 (75.0–85.0), respectively. In multivariable Tobit regression models older age, having poor glycemic control, longer duration of diabetes, insulin usage, obesity, and having diabetes-related complications were significant negative predictors of HRQoL. Conclusions Overall, patients with T2DM had lower HRQoL than the general population, which was attributed to being older age, longer duration of diabetes, insulin use, obesity, inadequate glycemic control, and diabetes-related complications. The utility index we generated can be used in future economic evaluations to inform decisions about alternative interventions and resource allocation."

The coronavirus main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) is a validated drug target against coronaviruses and has been heavily studied since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019. Here, we report the biophysical and enzymatic characterization of native Mpro, then characterize the steady-state kinetics of several commonly used FRET substrates, fluorogenic substrates, and six of the 11 reported SARS-CoV-2 polyprotein cleavage sequences. We then assessed the suitability of these substrates for high-throughput screening. Guided by our assessment of these substrates, we developed an improved 5-carboxyfluorescein-based FRET substrate, which is better suited for high-throughput screening and is less susceptible to interference and false positives than existing substrates. This study provides a useful framework for the design of coronavirus Mpro enzyme assays to facilitate the discovery and development of therapies targeting Mpro."
https://openalex.org/W4212993871,"Endomembrane glycosylation and cytoplasmic O-GlcNAcylation each play essential roles in nutrient sensing, and characteristic changes in glycan patterns have been described in disease states such as diabetes and cancer. These changes in glycosylation have important functional roles and can drive disease progression. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying how these signals are integrated and transduced into biological effects. Galectins are proteins that bind glycans and that are secreted by a poorly characterized nonclassical secretory mechanism. Once outside the cell, galectins bind to the terminal galactose residues of cell surface glycans and modulate numerous extracellular functions, such as clathrin-independent endocytosis (CIE). Originating in the cytoplasm, galectins are predicted substrates for O-GlcNAc addition and removal; and as we have shown, galectin 3 is a substrate for O-GlcNAc transferase. In this study, we also show that galectin 3 secretion is sensitive to changes in O-GlcNAc levels. We determined using immunoprecipitation and Western blotting that there is a significant difference in O-GlcNAcylation status between cytoplasmic and secreted galectin 3. We observed dramatic alterations in galectin 3 secretion in response to nutrient conditions, which were dependent on dynamic O-GlcNAcylation. Importantly, we showed that these O-GlcNAc-driven alterations in galectin 3 secretion also facilitated changes in CIE. These results indicate that dynamic O-GlcNAcylation of galectin 3 plays a role in modulating its secretion and can tune its function in transducing nutrient-sensing information coded in cell surface glycosylation into biological effects."

With interactive teaching as the core element, smart classrooms as technical support, and informationization, automation, and interaction as the main body, a smart system for college English teaching is established based on cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT). The system is built using the B/S architecture and verified by specific example data, to prove the effectiveness of the proposed smart system for college English teaching based on the IoT. It is found that the smart platform for English teaching based on the IoT not only effectively improves the stability of the system, but also enhances the personal experience of students. The coordinated operation of the various modules reduces the response time of the system. When the number of users reaches 500, the average response time of the system is 3.65 seconds, and the memory and occupancy rate of the system are reduced. Students who receive smart classrooms for teaching have a greater improvement in the test results of various aspects of English without teacher intervention. The proposed model can significantly improve the performance of poor students and reduce the gap in learning performance in the class, which provides reliable research ideas for smart teaching in modern colleges and universities."
https://openalex.org/W4213092522,"After long-term oxidation and energy storage, broken coal body borehole walls and drainage shaft walls may cause spontaneous combustion during gas extraction. The high-temperature thermal shock caused by the spontaneous combustion of coal incurs thermal damage on adjacent coal, which, in turn, causes changes in the mechanical properties of the coal. However, only a few studies have been conducted in this context, which has limited our understanding of the thermal damage characteristics of coal bodies in such situations. This study aimed to experimentally investigate the correlation between the crack evolution law and the mechanical properties of coal bodies at different temperatures (50-300°C) using heat-force loading considering Ping Mei No. 10 coal mine as the research object. The results suggest that the coal body experiences a large amount of visible damage, and becomes increasingly complex. At 50-300°C, some indexes (such as longitudinal wave velocity, Poisson's ratio, compressive strength, elastic modulus, impact energy index, and pre-peak strain) are positively correlated with temperature. In addition, the dynamic failure time and temperature show a negative correlation, and the overall change slope is small. The relationship between each index and temperature at 200-300°C is opposite to that at 50-200°C, and the overall change slope is larger. Moreover, when the oxidation temperature exceeds 200°C, the destruction of the coal body changes from elastic brittleness to ductility-plasticity. High-temperature oxidation incurs irreversible thermal damage of coal. Hence, it is necessary to focus on the changes in mechanical properties of coal after a spontaneous combustion process is extinguished."
https://openalex.org/W4213094782,"Crop parasites of the Striga genera are a major biological deterrent to food security in Africa and are one of the largest obstacles to poverty alleviation on the continent. Striga seeds germinate by sensing small-molecule hormones, strigolactones (SLs), that emanate from host roots. Although SL receptors (Striga hermonthica HYPOSENSITIVE TO LIGHT [ShHTL]) have been identified, discerning their function has been difficult because these parasites cannot be easily grown under laboratory conditions. Moreover, many Striga species are obligate outcrossers that are not transformable, hence not amenable to genetic analysis. By combining phenotypic screening with ShHTL structural information and hybrid drug discovery methods, we discovered a potent SL perception inhibitor for Striga, dormirazine (DOZ). Structural analysis of this piperazine-based antagonist reveals a novel binding mechanism, distinct from that of known SLs, blocking access of the hormone to its receptor. Furthermore, DOZ reduces the flexibility of protein-protein interaction domains important for receptor signaling to downstream partners. In planta, we show, via temporal additions of DOZ, that SL receptors are required at a specific time during seed conditioning. This conditioning is essential to prime seed germination at the right time; thus, this SL-sensitive stage appears to be critical for adequate receptor signaling. Aside from uncovering a function for ShHTL during seed conditioning, these results suggest that future Ag-Biotech Solutions to Striga infestations will need to carefully time the application of antagonists to exploit receptor availability and outcompete natural SLs, critical elements for successful parasitic plant invasions."
https://openalex.org/W4213250307,"Dihydroceramide is a lipid molecule generated via the action of (dihydro)ceramide synthases (CerSs), which use two substrates, namely sphinganine and fatty acyl-CoAs. Sphinganine is generated via the sequential activity of two integral membrane proteins located in the endoplasmic reticulum. Less is known about the source of the fatty acyl-CoAs, although a number of cytosolic proteins in the pathways of acyl-CoA generation modulate ceramide synthesis via direct or indirect interaction with the CerSs. In this study, we demonstrate, by proteomic analysis of immunoprecipitated proteins, that fatty acid transporter protein 2 (FATP2) (also known as very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase) directly interacts with CerS2 in mouse liver. Studies in cultured cells demonstrated that other members of the FATP family can also interact with CerS2, with the interaction dependent on both proteins being catalytically active. In addition, transfection of cells with FATP1, FATP2, or FATP4 increased ceramide levels although only FATP2 and 4 increased dihydroceramide levels, consistent with their known intracellular locations. Finally, we show that lipofermata, an FATP2 inhibitor which is believed to directly impact tumor cell growth via modulation of FATP2, decreased de novo dihydroceramide synthesis, suggesting that some of the proposed therapeutic effects of lipofermata may be mediated via (dihydro)ceramide rather than directly via acyl-CoA generation. In summary, our study reinforces the idea that manipulating the pathway of fatty acyl-CoA generation will impact a wide variety of down-stream lipids, not least the sphingolipids, which utilize two acyl-CoA moieties in the initial steps of their synthesis."
https://openalex.org/W4212924316,"Intelectins (intestinal lectins) are highly conserved across chordate evolution and have been implicated in various human diseases, including Crohn's disease (CD). The human genome encodes two intelectin genes, intelectin-1 (ITLN1) and intelectin-2 (ITLN2). Other than its high sequence similarity with ITLN1, little is known about ITLN2. To address this void in knowledge, we report that ITLN2 exhibits discrete, yet notable differences from ITLN1 in primary structure, including a unique amino terminus, as well as changes in amino acid residues associated with the glycan-binding activity of ITLN1. We identified that ITLN2 is a highly abundant Paneth cell-specific product, which localizes to secretory granules, and is expressed as a multimeric protein in the small intestine. In surgical specimens of ileal CD, ITLN2 mRNA levels were reduced approximately five-fold compared to control specimens. The ileal expression of ITLN2 was unaffected by previously reported disease-associated variants in ITLN2 and CD-associated variants in neighboring ITLN1 as well as NOD2 and ATG16L1. ITLN2 mRNA expression was undetectable in control colon tissue; however, in both ulcerative colitis (UC) and colonic CD, metaplastic Paneth cells were found to express ITLN2. Together, the data reported establish the groundwork for understanding ITLN2 function(s) in the intestine, including its possible role in CD."
https://openalex.org/W4212985138,"Human identification of unknown samples following disaster and mass casualty events is essential, especially to bring closure to family and friends of the deceased. Unfortunately, victim identification is often challenging for forensic investigators as analysis becomes complicated when biological samples are degraded or of poor quality as a result of exposure to harsh environmental factors. Mitochondrial DNA becomes the ideal option for analysis, particularly for determining the origin of the samples. In such events, the estimation of genetic parameters plays an important role in modelling and predicting genetic relatedness and is useful in assigning unknown individuals to an ethnic group. Various techniques exist for the estimation of genetic relatedness, but the use of Machine learning (ML) algorithms are novel and presently the least used in forensic genetic studies. In this study, we investigated the ability of ML algorithms to predict genetic relatedness using hypervariable region I sequences; that were retrieved from the GenBank database for three race groups, namely African, Asian and Caucasian. Four ML classification algorithms; Support vector machines (SVM), Linear discriminant analysis (LDA), Quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and Random Forest (RF) were hybridised with one-hot encoding, Principal component analysis (PCA) and Bags of Words (BoW), and were compared for inferring genetic relatedness. The findings from this study on WEKA showed that genetic inferences based on PCA-SVM achieved an overall accuracy of 80-90% and consistently outperformed PCA-LDA, PCA-RF and PCA-QDA, while in Python BoW-PCA-RF achieved 94.4% accuracy which outperformed BoW-PCA-SVM, BoW-PCA-LDA and BoW-PCA-QDA respectively. ML results from the use of WEKA and Python software tools displayed higher accuracies as compared to the Analysis of molecular variance results. Given the results, SVM and RF algorithms are likely to also be useful in other sequence classification applications, making it a promising tool in genetics and forensic science. The study provides evidence that ML can be utilized as a supplementary tool for forensic genetics casework analysis."
https://openalex.org/W4213377460,"The phosphorylated RNA polymerase II CTD interacting factor 1 (PCIF1) is a methyltransferase that adds a methyl group to the N6-position of 2'O-methyladenosine (Am), generating N6, 2'O-dimethyladenosine (m6Am) when Am is the cap-proximal nucleotide. In addition, PCIF1 has ancillary methylation activities on internal adenosines (both A and Am), although with much lower catalytic efficiency relative to that of its preferred cap substrate. The PCIF1 preference for 2'O-methylated Am over unmodified A nucleosides is due mainly to increased binding affinity for Am. Importantly, it was recently reported that PCIF1 can methylate viral RNA. Although some viral RNA can be translated in the absence of a cap, it is unclear what roles PCIF1 modifications may play in the functionality of viral RNAs. Here we show, using in vitro assays of binding and methyltransfer, that PCIF1 binds an uncapped 5'-Am oligonucleotide with approximately the same affinity as that of a cap analog (KM = 0.4 versus 0.3 μM). In addition, PCIF1 methylates the uncapped 5'-Am with activity decreased by only fivefold to sixfold compared with its preferred capped substrate. We finally discuss the relationship between PCIF1-catalyzed RNA methylation, shown here to have broader substrate specificity than previously appreciated, and that of the RNA demethylase fat mass and obesity-associated protein (FTO), which demonstrates PCIF1-opposing activities on capped RNAs."
https://openalex.org/W4220680200,"Epilepsy is a severe neurological disease manifested by spontaneous recurrent seizures due to abnormal hyper-synchronization of neuronal activity. Epilepsy affects about 1% of the population and up to 40% of patients experience seizures that are resistant to currently available drugs, thus highlighting an urgent need for novel treatments. In this regard, anti-inflammatory drugs emerged as potential therapeutic candidates. In particular, specific molecules apt to resolve the neuroinflammatory response occurring in acquired epilepsies have been proven to counteract seizures in experimental models, and humans. One candidate investigational molecule has been recently identified as the lipid mediator n-3 docosapentaenoic acid-derived protectin D1 (PD1n-3DPA ) which significantly reduced seizures, cell loss, and cognitive deficit in a mouse model of acquired epilepsy. However, the mechanisms that mediate the PD1n-3DPA effect remain elusive. We here addressed whether PD1n-3DPA has direct effects on neuronal activity independent of its anti-inflammatory action. We incubated, therefore, hippocampal slices with PD1n-3DPA and investigated its effect on excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to the CA1 pyramidal neurons. We demonstrate that inhibitory drive onto the perisomatic region of the pyramidal neurons is increased by PD1n-3DPA , and this effect is mediated by pertussis toxin-sensitive G-protein coupled receptors. Our data indicate that PD1n-3DPA acts directly on inhibitory transmission, most likely at the presynaptic site of inhibitory synapses as also supported by Xenopus oocytes and immunohistochemical experiments. Thus, in addition to its anti-inflammatory effects, PD1n-3DPA anti-seizure and neuroprotective effects may be mediated by its direct action on neuronal excitability by modulating their synaptic inputs."

The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon by exploring the individual experiences of women who reported mistreatment during childbirth in Switzerland.This project used a mixed methods approach to investigate women's experiences of mistreatment during childbirth in general and informal coercion specifically: The present qualitative study expands on the findings from a nationwide online survey on childbirth experience. It combines inductive with theoretical thematic analysis to study the 7,753 comments women wrote in the survey and the subsequent interviews with 11 women who reported being mistreated during childbirth.The women described a wide range of experiences of mistreatment during childbirth in both the survey comments and the interviews. Out of all survey participants who wrote at least one comment (n = 3,547), 28% described one or more experiences of mistreatment. Six of the seven types of mistreatment listed in Bohren and colleagues' typology of mistreatment during childbirth were found, the most frequent of which were ineffective communication and lack of informed consent. Five additional themes were identified in the interviews: Informal coercion, risk factors for mistreatment, consequences of mistreatment, examples of good care, and what's needed to improve maternity care.The findings from this study show that experiences of mistreatment are a reality in Swiss maternity care and give insight into women's individual experiences as well as how these affect them during and after childbirth. This study emphasises the need to respect women's autonomy in order to prevent mistreatment and empower women to actively participate in decisions. Both individual and systemic efforts are required to prevent mistreatment and guarantee respectful, dignified, and high-quality maternity care for all."
https://openalex.org/W4212997772,"Adipose tissue dynamically changes its mass in response to external nutritional status, which plays an important role in maintaining the lipid homeostasis. Physiologically, feeding events are associated with the expansion of adipose tissue, but little is known about the detailed molecular mechanisms of this expansion. Here, using comprehensive transcriptome analysis, we found that levels of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1), a key regulator of extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, were increased in adipose tissue under feeding conditions and associated with the lipogenic pathway. In addition, TGF-β receptors are highly expressed in adipose tissue, and pharmacological inhibition of TGF-β1 reduced adipose tissue mass and caused ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver. This reduced fat mass was associated with decreased gene expression in ECM remodeling and lipogenesis. Furthermore, similar results were observed in the adipose tissue of SMAD family member 3 knockout mice or upon systemic TGF-β neutralization, with significant reductions in both ECM remodeling and lipogenesis-related genes. Mechanistically, we found that insulin-induced TGF-β1 and cell-autonomous action remodels the ECM of adipocytes, which controls the downstream focal adhesion kinase-AKT signaling cascades and enhances the lipogenic pathway. Of note, destruction of collagens or matrix metalloproteinase/a disintegrin and metalloprotease activities, critical components of ECM remodeling, blocked TGF-β1-mediated focal adhesion kinase-AKT signaling and the lipogenic pathway. Taken together, this study identifies a previously unknown lipogenic role of TGF-β1 by which adipocytes can expand to adapt to physiological feeding events."
https://openalex.org/W4213009004,"Self-assembling (glyco)protein surface layers (S-layers) are ubiquitous prokaryotic cell-surface structures involved in structural maintenance, nutrient diffusion, host adhesion, virulence, and other processes, which makes them appealing targets for therapeutics and biotechnological applications as biosensors or drug delivery systems. However, unlocking this potential requires expanding our understanding of S-layer properties, especially the details of surface-attachment. S-layers of Gram-positive bacteria often are attached through the interaction of S-layer homology (SLH) domain trimers with peptidoglycan-linked secondary cell wall polymers (SCWPs). Cocrystal structures of the SLH domain trimer from the Paenibacillus alvei S-layer protein SpaA (SpaASLH) with synthetic, terminal SCWP disaccharide and trisaccharide analogs, together with isothermal titration calorimetry binding analyses, reveal that while SpaASLH accommodates longer biologically relevant SCWP ligands within both its primary (G2) and secondary (G1) binding sites, the terminal pyruvylated ManNAc moiety serves as the nearly exclusive SCWP anchoring point. Binding is accompanied by displacement of a flexible loop adjacent to the receptor site that enhances the complementarity between protein and ligand, including electrostatic complementarity with the terminal pyruvate moiety. Remarkably, binding of the pyruvylated monosaccharide SCWP fragment alone is sufficient to cause rearrangement of the receptor-binding sites in a manner necessary to accommodate longer SCWP fragments. The observation of multiple conformations in longer oligosaccharides bound to the protein, together with the demonstrated functionality of two of the three SCWP receptor-binding sites, reveals how the SpaASLH-SCWP interaction has evolved to accommodate longer SCWP ligands and alleviate the strain inherent to bacterial S-layer adhesion during growth and division."

Having complex health needs is associated with poorer clinical outcomes and higher healthcare costs. Care management for people with health complexity is increasingly recommended in primary health care (PHC). The INTERMED complexity assessment grid showed adequate psychometric properties in specialized settings. This study aimed to evaluate INTERMED's validity and feasibility to assess health complexity in an adult PHC population.The biopsychosocial health care needs of 230 consecutive adult patients from three Brazilian PHC services were assessed using the INTERMED interview. Participants with a total score >20 were classified as ""complex"". Quality of life was measured using the World Health Organization Quality of Life BREF (WHOQOL-BREF); symptoms of anxiety and depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS); social support using the Medical Outcomes Study-Social Support Survey (MOS-SSS); comorbidity levels using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). We developed two questionnaires to evaluate health services use, and patient perceived feasibility of INTERMED.42 participants (18.3%) were classified as ""complex"". A moderate correlation was found between the total INTERMED score and the total scores of WHOQOL-BREF (rho = - 0.59) and HADS (rho = 0.56), and between the social domains of INTERMED and MOS-SSS (rho = -0.44). After adjustment, the use of PHC (β = 2.12, t = 2.10, p < 0.05), any other health care services (β = 3.05, t = 3.97, p < 0.01), and any medication (β = 3.64, t = 4.16, p < 0.01) were associated with higher INTERMED scores. The INTERMED internal consistency was good (ω = 0.83), and the median application time was 7 min. Patients reported satisfaction with the questions, answers, and application time.INTERMED displayed good psychometric values in a PHC population and proved promising for practical use in PHC."
https://openalex.org/W4212808569,"Most studies examining complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) stakeholder engagement with evidence-based practice have relied on quantitative research methods, which often fail to capture the nuances of this phenomena. Using qualitative methods, this study aimed to explore the experiences of CAM stakeholders regarding the barriers and enablers to the conduct and application of research.This research was guided by a qualitative descriptive framework. CAM practitioners and researchers of multiple CAM disciplines from across Australia and New Zealand were invited to share their personal perspectives of the study phenomena. Semi-structured interviews were conducted via Zoom, which were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Rigour strategies were applied to ensure the credibility of results. The transcript was analysed using thematic analysis.CAM stakeholders identified an array of barriers and enablers to the conduct and application of research within their disciplines. The barriers and enablers that emerged were found to be inter-connected with two similar constructs: capacity and culture. Captured within the construct of capacity were five themes-lack of resources, inadequate governance/leadership, lack of competency, bias directed from outside and within CAM, and lack of time for research. Within the construct of culture were two themes-intrinsic perceptions in CAM, and lack of communication within and outside CAM.Promoting evidence-based practice and engaging with research in CAM continues to face challenges. This study, for the first time, has highlighted the multitude of interlinked barriers that confront CAM stakeholders when engaging with research. These findings highlight the need for a concerted and targeted approach to tackle these challenges."
https://openalex.org/W4212989295,"Worldwide, an estimated 38.0 million people lived with the human immunodeficiency virus in 2019, and 3.4 million young people aged 15~24 years were living with HIV. Sub-Saharan Africa carries a significant HIV burden with West and Central Africa most affected with HIV. Among the young people living with HIV in West and Central Africa, an estimated 810,000 were aged 15~24 years. This study aimed to assess predictors that influence the uptake of HIV testing among youth aged 15~24 years in The Gambia.The 2013 Gambia Demographic and Health Survey data for youth aged 15~24 years was used. The Andersen behavioral model of health service use guided this study. A cross-sectional study design was used on 6194 subjects, among which 4730 were female. The analysis employed Chi-squared tests and hierarchical logistic regression.Less than one-quarter of the youth 1404 (22.6%) had ever been tested for HIV. Young people aged 20~24 years (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 1.98), who were females (aOR: 1.13), married youth (aOR: 3.89), with a primary (aOR: 1.23), secondary or higher education (aOR: 1.46), and who were from the Jola/Karoninka ethnic group (aOR: 1.81), had higher odds of having been tested for HIV. Those with adequate HIV knowledge and those who were sexually active and had aged at first sex ≥15 years (aOR: 3.99) and those <15 years (aOR: 3.96) were more likely to have been tested for HIV compared to those who never had sex.This study underscores the low level of model testing on HIV testing among youth (15~24 years) in The Gambia. Using Anderson's Model of Health Service Utilization, the predisposing factors (socio-demographic and HIV knowledge) and the need-for-care factors (sexual risk behaviors) predict healthcare utilization services (HIV testing) in our study; however, only socio-demographic model explained most of the variance in HIV testing. The low effect of model testing could be related to the limited number of major variables selected for HIV knowledge and sexual risk behavior models. Thus, consideration for more variables is required for future studies."
https://openalex.org/W4213055357,"Oncogenic mutations in the small GTPase RAS contribute to ~30% of human cancers. In a Drosophila genetic screen, we identified novel and evolutionary conserved cancer genes that affect Ras-driven tumorigenesis and metastasis in Drosophila including confirmation of the tetraspanin Tsp29Fb. However, it was not known whether the mammalian Tsp29Fb orthologue, TSPAN6, has any role in RAS-driven human epithelial tumors. Here we show that TSPAN6 suppressed tumor growth and metastatic dissemination of human RAS activating mutant pancreatic cancer xenografts. Whole-body knockout as well as tumor cell autonomous inactivation using floxed alleles of Tspan6 in mice enhanced KrasG12D-driven lung tumor initiation and malignant progression. Mechanistically, TSPAN6 binds to the EGFR and blocks EGFR-induced RAS activation. Moreover, we show that inactivation of TSPAN6 induces an epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and inhibits cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Finally, low TSPAN6 expression correlates with poor prognosis of patients with lung and pancreatic cancers with mesenchymal morphology. Our results uncover TSPAN6 as a novel tumor suppressor receptor that controls epithelial cell identify and restrains RAS-driven epithelial cancer."
https://openalex.org/W4213085922,"Lysosomes serve as dynamic regulators of cell and organismal physiology by integrating the degradation of macromolecules with receptor and nutrient signaling. Previous studies have established that activation of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) and transcription factor E3 (TFE3) induces the expression of lysosomal genes and proteins in signaling-inactive starved cells, that is, under conditions when activity of the master regulator of nutrient-sensing signaling mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 is repressed. How lysosome biogenesis is triggered in signaling-active cells is incompletely understood. Here, we identify a role for calcium release from the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in the control of lysosome biogenesis that is independent of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1. We show using functional imaging that calcium efflux from endoplasmic reticulum stores induced by inositol triphosphate accumulation upon depletion of inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase A, an inositol 5-phosphatase downregulated in cancer and defective in spinocerebellar ataxia, or receptor-mediated phospholipase C activation leads to the induction of lysosome biogenesis. This mechanism involves calcineurin and the nuclear translocation and elevated transcriptional activity of TFEB/TFE3. Our findings reveal a crucial function for inositol polyphosphate-5-phosphatase A-mediated triphosphate hydrolysis in the control of lysosome biogenesis via TFEB/TFE3, thereby contributing to our understanding how cells are able to maintain their lysosome content under conditions of active receptor and nutrient signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4213174638,"Whereas much research has been conducted on rats in their roles as pests and laboratory animal models, little is known about rats in their role as companion animals. However, rats have become the third most common companion animal admitted to the British Columbia Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (BC SPCA) shelter system after cats and dogs. This paper analyses 5 years of province-wide rat admission and outcome data (n = 3,392) at the BC SPCA. Most rats that entered BC SPCA shelters were white, sexually intact, and pups less than 6 months old. Rats were mostly relinquished by their owners, and the most common surrender reasons were due to owner-related issues and housing issues. Reasons for euthanasia were primarily poor health and neonatal age. A multiple linear regression model found that rats that were either senior, albino, unhealthy, seized by humane officers, or born onsite tended to stay longer in shelters (F[12, 1466] = 9.565, p &lt; .001, adjusted R 2 = .06). Time to adoption for albino rats was 79% longer than for white rats. These findings help us understand the preferences of rat adopters and why the rat-human relationship may fail. Results may also be useful to improve the quality of life for pet rats by identifying programs to reduce their length of stay in animal shelters. Finally, our study highlights new questions for welfare research in an understudied companion animal–the pet rat."
https://openalex.org/W4213260079,"CaV1 and CaV2 voltage-gated calcium channels evolved from an ancestral CaV1/2 channel via gene duplication somewhere near the stem animal lineage. The divergence of these channel types led to distinguishing functional properties that are conserved among vertebrates and bilaterian invertebrates and contribute to their unique cellular roles. One key difference pertains to their regulation by calmodulin (CaM), wherein bilaterian CaV1 channels are uniquely subject to pronounced, buffer-resistant Ca2+/CaM-dependent inactivation, permitting negative feedback regulation of calcium influx in response to local cytoplasmic Ca2+ rises. Early diverging, nonbilaterian invertebrates also possess CaV1 and CaV2 channels, but it is unclear whether they share these conserved functional features. The most divergent animals to possess both CaV1 and CaV2 channels are placozoans such as Trichoplax adhaerens, which separated from other animals over 600 million years ago shortly after their emergence. Hence, placozoans can provide important insights into the early evolution of CaV1 and CaV2 channels. Here, we build upon previous characterization of Trichoplax CaV channels by determining the cellular expression and ion-conducting properties of the CaV1 channel orthologue, TCaV1. We show that TCaV1 is expressed in neuroendocrine-like gland cells and contractile dorsal epithelial cells. In vitro, this channel conducts dihydropyridine-insensitive, high-voltage–activated Ca2+ currents with kinetics resembling those of rat CaV1.2 but with left-shifted voltage sensitivity for activation and inactivation. Interestingly, TCaV1, but not TCaV2, exhibits buffer-resistant Ca2+/CaM-dependent inactivation, indicating that this functional divergence evolved prior to the emergence of bilaterian animals and may have contributed to their unique adaptation for cytoplasmic Ca2+ signaling within various cellular contexts.

Voltage-gated calcium (CaV) channels belong to a vast eukaryotic lineage of four-domain channels, which in animals includes voltage-gated sodium (NaV) and NALCN sodium leak channels (1Pozdnyakov I. Matantseva O. Skarlato S. Diversity and evolution of four-domain voltage-gated cation channels of eukaryotes and their ancestral functional determinants.Sci. Rep. 2018; 8: 1-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). These pore-forming proteins, also referred to as α1 subunits, share a common transmembrane architecture of four homologous repeat domains (DI to DIV), each bearing six transmembrane alpha helices (Fig. 1A). In addition to opening with changes in membrane voltage, a key feature of CaV channels is their selective permeability for Ca2+, which acts as a second messenger in the cytosol. Hence, CaV channels are able to translate electrical signals at the cell membrane into cytoplasmic Ca2+ signals, for example at the presynaptic terminal where they drive vesicle exocytosis and neurotransmitter release (i.e., excitation-secretion coupling) and in muscle where they drive contraction (excitation-contraction coupling) (2Catterall W.A. Voltage-gated calcium channels.Cold Spring Harb. Perspect. Biol. 2011; 3a003947Crossref PubMed Scopus (868) Google Scholar). Most animals possess three types of CaV channels that separate into two ancient and phylogenetically distinct clades: CaV3 or T-type channels, which become activated by small membrane depolarization and are classified as low-voltage–activated channels, and high-voltage–activated or HVA channels, which are further classified as CaV1 or L-type channels and CaV2 or N-, P/Q-, and R-type channels (3Ertel E.A. Campbell K.P. Harpold M.M. Hofmann F. Mori Y. Perez-Reyes E. Schwartz A. Snutch T.P. Tanabe T. Birnbaumer L. Nomenclature of voltage-gated calcium channels.Neuron. 2000; 25: 533-535Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CaV3 channels are present in the genomes of single-celled choanoflagellates, our closest unicellular ancestors, and hence likely evolved before the emergence of animals (4Moran Y. Zakon H.H.

Evol. 2014; 6: 2210-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). CaV1 and CaV2 channels are thought to have evolved strictly in animals via gene duplication of an ancestral CaV1/2-type channel type, still present in choanoflagellates and poriferan animals (sponges) (4Moran Y.

In accordance, CaV1, CaV2, and CaV1/2 channels share common structural features that distinguish them from CaV3 channels, including an alpha interaction domain (AID) in the cytoplasmic linker between DI and DII, where the obligate ancillary subunit CaVβ binds and regulates channel membrane expression and gating (1Pozdnyakov I.

The association of the CaV1 and CaV2 channels with CaVβ was likely inherited from the ancestral CaV1/2 channel, given the presence of a CaVβ gene in choanoflagellates (4Moran Y. Zakon H.H.

Acta Biomembr. 2020; 1862: 183439Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), and the unpublished observation that efficient in vitro expression of the CaV1/2 channel cloned from the choanoflagellate Salpingoecca rosetta requires co-expression with its cognate CaVβ subunit (9Mehta A. Cloning and Characterization of Voltage-Gated Sodium and Calcium Channel Homologs from the Single-Cell Choanoflagellate, Salpingoeca Rosetta. UWSpace, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada2016Google Scholar). CaV1 and CaV2 channels also require the ancillary subunit CaVα2δ for their membrane expression, localization, and gating characteristics, which in contrast to the cytoplasmic CaVβ subunit associates with extracellular regions of the pore-forming α1 subunit (6Dolphin A.C. Voltage-gated calcium channels and their auxiliary subunits: Physiology and pathophysiology and pharmacology.J. Physiol. 2016; 594: 5369-5390Crossref PubMed Scopus (157) Google Scholar). Whether this subunit also interacts with and regulates extant CaV1/2 channels is unclear, given its reported absence in the genomes of poriferans and choanoflagellates, the only organismal lineages known to possess CaV1/2 channels (4Moran Y. Zakon H.H. The evolution of the four subunits of voltage-gated calcium channels: Ancient roots, increasing complexity, and multiple losses.Genome Biol. Evol. 2014; 6: 2210-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Also in accordance with their evolutionary relatedness, CaV1, CaV2, and CaV1/2 channels share C-terminal EF-hand, pre-IQ, and IQ domains/structures where the Ca2+ sensor protein calmodulin (CaM) binds and regulates channel gating. For CaV1 and CaV2 channels, Ca2+/CaM regulation is an important feedback mechanism that permits fine tuning of cytoplasmic Ca2+ influx in response to background Ca2+ levels. Most often, Ca2+/CaM regulation of CaV1 and CaV2 channels results in accelerated inactivation of macroscopic currents recorded under voltage-clamp (i.e., Ca2+-dependent inactivation or CDI), although vertebrate CaV2.1 channels can also exhibit Ca2+-dependent facilitation (10Ben-Johny M. Yue D.T. Calmodulin regulation (calmodulation) of voltage-gated calcium channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2014; 143: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Importantly, CaM bears two Ca2+-binding lobes (N and C terminal or N- and C-lobes), each with different Ca2+-binding properties. Specifically, the N-lobe exhibits weaker Ca2+ binding affinity and thus senses slow, global rises in cytoplasmic Ca2+, while the C-lobe has a much higher binding affinity, optimal for detecting transient local rises in Ca2+ emanating from the open channel pore (11Bayley P. Ahlstrőm P. Martin S.R. Forsen S. The kinetics of calcium binding to calmodulin: Quin 2 and ANS stopped-flow fluorescence studies.Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1984; 120: 185-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). This difference in Ca2+ binding also permits experimental distinction between N- and C-lobe regulation, where N-lobe processes are disrupted by strong cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering (e.g., 10 mM BAPTA), while C-lobe processes are buffer-resistant. Under strong buffering conditions, C-lobe regulation can be subsequently identified by switching the permeating cation from Ca2+ to Ba2+, the latter weakly binding CaM and hence unable to to triggering the CDI process (12Peterson B.Z. DeMaria C.D. Yue D.T. Calmodulin is the Ca2+ sensor for Ca2+-dependent inactivation of L-type calcium channels.Neuron. 1999; 22: 549-558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In mammals, both CaV1 and CaV2 channels are subject to N-lobe regulation by CaM. However, CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels exhibit altered N-lobe modulation that is buffer resistant (i.e., local sensitivity), caused by direct interactions between CaM and the channels' N termini, at structures referred to as NSCaTE (for N-terminal spatial Ca2+ transforming element) and NATE (for NSCaTE associated transduction element) (13Dick I.E. Tadross M.R. Liang H. Tay L.H. Yang W. Yue D.T.

A novel calmodulin site in the Cav1. 2 N-terminus regulates calcium-dependent inactivation.Pflügers Arch. 2014; 466: 1793-1803Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). Bilaterian (i.e., animals with bilateral body symmetry) invertebrate CaV1 channels also possess an NSCaTE motif; however, unlike CaV1.2 and CaV1.3, removal of this motif in vitro does not impact CDI (15Taiakina V. Boone A.N. Fux J. Senatore A. Weber-Adrian D. Guillemette J.G. Spafford J.D. The calmodulin-binding, short linear motif, NSCaTE is conserved in L-type channel ancestors of vertebrate Cav1. 2 and Cav1. 3 channels.PLoS One. 2013; 8e61765Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar), suggesting that this altered N-lobe regulation is a unique feature of mammalian CaV1.2 and CaV1.3 channels. Additionally, mammalian CaV1 channels, but not CaV2 channels, are also subject to pronounced, buffer-resistant CDI that is mediated by the C-lobe of CaM (10Ben-Johny M. Yue D.T. Calmodulin regulation (calmodulation) of voltage-gated calcium channels.J. Gen. Physiol. 2014; 143: 679-692Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Thus, altogether, a key distinction in CaM regulation between mammalian CaV1 and CaV2 channels is that only CaV1 channels exhibit buffer-resistant regulation for sensing local Ca2+ plumes, in addition to global sensitivity that is also apparent for CaV2 channels. Importantly, a similar distinction has been reported for the CaV1 and CaV2 channel homologues from the snail Lymnaea stagnalis, where under strong buffering conditions, the CaV2 channel lacks CDI when the permeating cation is switched from Ba2+ to Ca2+, while the CaV1 channel shows pronounced buffer-resistant CDI, that becomes apparent when Ca2+ is replaced with Ba2+ as the permeating cation (15Taiakina V. Boone A.N. Fux J. Senatore A. Weber-Adrian D. Guillemette J.G. Spafford J.D.

Altogether, it is apparent that differential regulation of CaV1 and CaV2 channels by CaM is an ancestral trait that likely emerged hundreds of millions of years ago in last common ancestor of all bilaterians. However, the evolutionary origin of this distinction and whether it conserved in early diverging, nonbilaterian animals is not known. The most early diverging animals to possess CaV1 and CaV2 channels, along with CaV3 channels, are species within the phylum Placozoa such as Trichoplax adhaerens (4Moran Y. Zakon H.H.

Accordingly, placozoans produce action potentials (APs) (21Romanova D.Y. Smirnov I.V. Nikitin M.A. Kohn A.B. Borman A.I. Malyshev A.Y. Balaban P.M. Moroz L.L.

Previously, we determined the cellular expression and in vitro functional properties of the T. adhaerens CaV2 and CaV3 channel homologues (5Gauberg J. Abdallah S. Elkhatib W. Harracksingh A.N.

Here, we complete the characterization of the Trichoplax CaV channel set by similarly chracterizing the Trichoplax CaV1 channel, and describe the phylogenetic properties of the placozoan CaVβ and CaVα2δ and related subunit homologues. Trichoplax CaV1 (TCaV1) is expressed in contractile epithelial cells located on the dorsal epithelium and neuroendocrine-like gland cells located along the periphery of the animal. In vitro expression of the cloned channel is significantly increased upon co-expression with mammalian CaVβ1b and CaVα2δ1 subunits, in lieu of co-expressed Trichoplax ancillary subunits. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recording of transfected mammalian cells revealed robust high-voltage–activated Ca2+ currents with left-shifted voltage dependencies compared to the rat CaV1.2 channel (rCaV1.2), especially with respect to channel inactivation, producing a prominent window current at resting voltages between −50 and −30 mV. Interestingly, omission of a cotransfected CaVα2δ1 subunit resulted in significant rightward shifts in channel activation and inactivation, underscoring the significance of this subunit in regulating TCaV1 channel gating. More similar to rCaV1.2 is the recovery from inactivation and kinetics for current activation, inactivation, and deactivation. Altogether, the functional properties of the Trichoplax CaV1 channel are somewhat divergent compared to the mammalian CaV1.2 channel orthologue, in line with the extreme phylogenetic distance between placozoans and bilaterians. Similar to our finding for Trichoplax CaV2 (5Gauberg J. Abdallah S. Elkhatib W. Harracksingh A.N. Piekut T. Stanley E.F. Senatore A. Conserved biophysical features of the CaV2 presynaptic Ca2+ channel homologue from the early-diverging animal Trichoplax adhaerens.J. Biol. Chem. 2020; 295: 18553-18578Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar), TCaV1 is insensitive to pharmacological blockers that are selective for mammalian orthologues, with minimal sensitivity to the dihydropyridine (DHP) blockers nifedipine, isradipine, and the two enantiomers of Bay K8644 which either block or enhance macroscopic currents. Considering the recent discovery of APs in the Placozoa, we compared the Ca2+ conducting properties of TCaV1 and TCaV2 using square voltage-clamp waveforms of different durations and frequencies, revealing similar Ca2+ currents under most tested conditions. Where the two channels were found to differ was in their regulation by CaM. Specifically, whereas both channels are subject to CDI mediated by CaM, only TCaV1 exhibits modulation that is resistant to strong cytoplasmic Ca2+ buffering, evident when comparing inactivation properties when switching the permeating cation from Ca2+ to Ba2+. Thus, like in bilaterians, the Trichoplax CaV1 and CaV2 channels are differentially regulated by CaM, with the CaV1 channel capable of detecting local Ca2+ plumes, a feature that likely impacted the differential selection of CaV1 channels for specific Ca2+ signaling functions in different cellular contexts. T. adhaerens (Fig. 1B) is the most studied species from the phylum Placozoa (Fig. 1C), a group of simple seawater animals that have a phylogenetic sister clade relationship with bilaterians, and cnidarians (e.g., jellyfish, sea anemones, and corals). Placozoans lack a nervous system and synapses, although they possess most genes required for electrochemical neural signaling (19Srivastava M. Begovic E. Chapman J. Putnam N.H. Hellsten U. Kawashima T. Kuo A. Mitros T. Salamov A. Carpenter M.L. The Trichoplax genome and the nature of placozoans.Nature. 2008; 454: 955-960Crossref PubMed Scopus (616) Google Scholar). The two most early diverging animal phyla are the poriferans (sponges) and ctenophores (comb jellies), the former lacking a nervous system (26Leys S.P. Elements of a ‘nervous system’in sponges.J. Exp. Biol. 2015; 218: 581-591Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) and the latter bearing the most divergent nervous systems, proposed by some to have evolved independently (27Moroz L.L. Multiple origins of neurons from secretory cells.Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 2021; 9: 669087Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar). Both ctenophores and sponges lack CaV1 and CaV3 channels (4Moran Y.

Evol. 2014; 6: 2210-2217Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar), making placozoans the most early diverging group to possess a complete set of CaV1 to CaV3 channels, as well as one ancillary CaVβ and two CaVα2δ orthologues (20Wong Y.Y. Le P. Elkhatib W. Piekut T. Senatore A.

A maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of representative full-length CaV channel protein sequences from select species reveals phylogenetic relationships for CaV1 channels that mostly match the species phylogeny (28Whelan N.V. Kocot K.M. Moroz T.P. Mukherjee K. Williams P. Paulay G. Moroz L.L. Halanych K.M. Ctenophore relationships and their placement as the sister group to all other animals.Nat. Ecol. Evol. 2017; 1: 1737-1746Crossref PubMed Scopus (110) Google Scholar), with the orthologues from Trichoplax and the fellow placozoan Hoilungia hongkongensis being the most divergent, followed by those from cnidarians (Fig. 1D). Like most invertebrates (e.g., echinoderms, molluscs, nematodes, and most arthropods), placozoans possess single copy genes for CaV1 to CaV3 channels, whereas independent gene duplications produced multiple isotypes in certain lineages. For example, higher chordates possess four CaV1 channel isotypes (CaV1.1–CaV1.4), while more early diverging chordates such as tunicates (e.g., the sea squirt Halocynthia roretzi) and cephalochordates (e.g., the lancelet Branchiostoma belcheri) only have single CaV1 channel genes. CaV1 channels duplicated independently in Platyhelminthes (e.g., the planarian Dugesia japonica) to produce two isotypes, CaV1A and CaV1B (29Chan J.D. Zhang D. Liu X. Zarowiecki M. Berriman M. Marchant J.S. Utilizing the planarian voltage-gated ion channel transcriptome to resolve a role for a Ca2+ channel in neuromuscular function and regeneration.Biochim. Biophys. Acta Mol.

After placozoans, the next most early diverging animals to possess CaV1 to CaV3 channels are the cnidarians such as the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and the lion’s mane jellyfish Cyanea capillata, which notably duplicated CaV2 and CaV3 channels to produce three and two genes respectively, while retaining a single CaV1 channel gene (4Moran Y.

The open reading frame of the TCaV1 α1 subunit was cloned from a whole animal cDNA library, producing a consensus sequence encoding a 1822 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular weight of ∼208 kDa (GenBank accession number MW915585). When comparing the three Trichoplax CaV channels to each other, the more proximal phylogenetic relationship between TCaV1 and TCaV2 is apparent as they share ∼41% sequence identity on a global protein alignment, compared to only 29% and 26%, respectively, with the TCaV3 channel. TCaV1 is also more similar to rat CaV1.2 than it is to TCaV2 and TCaV3, with 49% sequence identity. Structurally, the TCaV1 channel bears the hallmark features of bilaterian and cnidarian CaV1 and CaV2 channels (Fig. 1A), including four homologous repeat domains (domains I to IV), each bearing six predicted transmembrane alpha helices or segments (S1–S6) (Fig. 1E). Alignment of single representative CaV1 channel protein sequences from each phylum included in Figure 1D reveals that the transmembrane segments and intervening loops within the four repeat domains are highly conserved, while the N and C termini and cytoplasmic linkers between domains I to IV are highly divergent (Fig. 1F). Sequence conservation within domains I to IV includes four glutamate (E) residues within the extracellular pore-loop (P-loop) of each domain, located between S5 and S6, that form a Ca2+ selectivity filter motif of EEEE common to CaV1 and CaV2 channels (Fig. 1G). In contrast, and conserved in placozoans, CaV3 channels bear distinct selectivity filter motifs of two glutamate and two aspartate (D) residues (i.e., EEDD; Figs. 1G and S1). Notably, all three placozoan CaV channels possess a ubiquitously conserved aspartate residue adjacent to the DII selectivity filter glutamate (Fig. 1G), suggested to contribute to Ca2+ selectivity (32Tikhonov D.B.

https://openalex.org/W3113217532,"Knowledge Distillation (KD) is one of the widely known methods for model compression. In essence, KD trains a smaller student model based on a larger teacher model and tries to retain the teacher model's level of performance as much as possible. However, existing KD methods suffer from the following limitations. First, since the student model is smaller in absolute size, it inherently lacks model capacity. Second, the absence of an initial guide for the student model makes it difficult for the student to imitate the teacher model to its fullest. Conventional KD methods yield low performance due to these limitations. In this paper, we propose Pea-KD (Parameter-efficient and accurate Knowledge Distillation), a novel approach to KD. Pea-KD consists of two main parts: Shuffled Parameter Sharing (SPS) and Pretraining with Teacher's Predictions (PTP). Using this combination, we are capable of alleviating the KD's limitations. SPS is a new parameter sharing method that increases the student model capacity. PTP is a KD-specialized initialization method, which can act as a good initial guide for the student. When combined, this method yields a significant increase in student model's performance. Experiments conducted on BERT with different datasets and tasks show that the proposed approach improves the student model's performance by 4.4% on average in four GLUE tasks, outperforming existing KD baselines by significant margins."

https://openalex.org/W4213183731,"The mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway is activated by intracellular nutritional sufficiency and extracellular growth signals. It has been reported that mTORC1 acts as a hub that integrates these inputs to orchestrate a number of cellular responses, including translation, nucleotide synthesis, lipid synthesis, and lysosome biogenesis. However, little is known about specific control of mTORC1 signaling downstream of this complex. Here, we demonstrate that Ragulator, a heteropentameric protein complex required for mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids, is critical for inhibiting the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). We established a unique RAW264.7 clone that lacked Ragulator but retained total mTORC1 activity. In a nutrition-sufficient state, the nuclear translocation of TFEB was markedly enhanced in the clone despite total mTORC1 kinase activity. In addition, as a cellular phenotype, the number of lysosomes was increased by tenfold in the Ragulator-deficient clone compared with that of control cells. These findings indicate that mTORC1 essentially requires the Ragulator complex for regulating the subcellular distribution of TFEB. Our findings also suggest that other scaffold proteins may be associated with mTORC1 for the specific regulation of downstream signaling."
https://openalex.org/W4213197506,"RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding protein A (RbpA) is essential for mycobacterial viability and regulates transcription initiation by increasing the stability of the RNAP-promoter open complex (RPo). RbpA consists of four domains: an N-terminal tail (NTT), a core domain (CD), a basic linker, and a sigma interaction domain. We have previously shown that truncation of the RbpA NTT and CD increases RPo stabilization by RbpA, implying that these domains inhibit this activity of RbpA. Previously published structural studies showed that the NTT and CD are positioned near multiple RNAP-σA holoenzyme functional domains and predict that the RbpA NTT contributes specific amino acids to the binding site of the antibiotic fidaxomicin (Fdx), which inhibits the formation of the RPo complex. Furthermore, deletion of the NTT results in decreased Mycobacterium smegmatis sensitivity to Fdx, but whether this is caused by a loss in Fdx binding is unknown. We generated a panel of rbpA mutants and found that the RbpA NTT residues predicted to directly interact with Fdx are partially responsible for RbpA-dependent Fdx activity in vitro, while multiple additional RbpA domains contribute to Fdx activity in vivo. Specifically, our results suggest that the RPo-stabilizing activity of RbpA decreases Fdx activity in vivo. In support of the association between RPo stability and Fdx activity, we find that another factor that promotes RPo stability in bacteria, CarD, also impacts to Fdx sensitivity. Our findings highlight how RbpA and other factors may influence RNAP dynamics to affect Fdx sensitivity.

Mycobacterium tuberculosis is the causative agent of the disease tuberculosis, which resulted in an estimated 1.5 million deaths worldwide in 2019 (https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240013131). New strategies are necessary to fight this global health crisis, including the development of novel therapies. Bacterial transcription is a druggable essential process in M. tuberculosis, demonstrated by the transcription inhibitor rifampicin’s continued status as a cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment. Bacterial transcription is carried out by an RNA polymerase (RNAP) comprised of five subunits (α2ββ’ω), referred to as the core RNAP, and a sixth dissociable subunit (σ) that when bound to core RNAP forms a complex termed the RNAP holoenzyme.

These RNAP structural domains have been characterized to varying levels in Escherichia coli, which lacks RbpA. The RNAP β Sw3 is one of five switch regions that are thought to undergo conformational changes during transcription initiation (18Gnatt A.L. Cramer P. Fu J. Bushnell D.A. Kornberg R.D.

The positioning of the RbpA NTT and CD near multiple different structural and functional domains of the RNAP-σA holoenzyme implies that the RbpA NTT and CD could impact RNAP activity through a number of mechanisms. However, it is unclear what contacts between the RbpA NTT/CD and the RNAP mediate the antagonism of RPo stability. In addition, structural studies indicate that the RbpA NTT is positioned in the RNAP-σA holoenzyme complex in such a way that it contributes to the binding site for the antibiotic fidaxomicin (Fdx) (11Boyaci H.

Fdx inhibits transcription initiation by binding the RNAP and blocking the closing of the RNAP clamp that occurs during RPo formation (11Boyaci H. Chen J. Lilic M. Palka M. Mooney R.A. Landick R.

Deletion of the RbpA NTT decreases sensitivity of M. tuberculosis RNAP to Fdx in vitro and in vivo (11Boyaci H. Chen J. Lilic M. Palka M. Mooney R.A. Landick R. Darst S.A. Campbell E.A. Fidaxomicin jams mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase motions needed for initiation via RBPA contacts.Elife. 2018; 7e34823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar), which is proposed to be due to the loss of RbpA’s contribution to the RNAP-Fdx binding interface. However, given that RbpA NTT also decreases RPo stability (5Prusa J. Jensen D. Santiago-Collazo G. Pope S.S. Garner A.L. Miller J.J. Manzano A.R. Galburt E.A. Stallings C.L. Domains within RbpA serve specific functional roles that regulate the expression of distinct mycobacterial gene subsets.J. Bacteriol. 2018; 200e00690-17Crossref PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar) and is predicted to interact with σA3.2, which is known to affect Fdx activity (11Boyaci H. Chen J. Lilic M. Palka M.

Biol. 2016; 428: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), it is possible that RbpA may impact Fdx activity by additional mechanisms. In this study, we interrogate the roles played by residues within the NTT in RbpA-dependent Fdx sensitivity and find that the amino acids predicted by the structural studies to interact with Fdx do partially contribute to Fdx activity in vitro. However, we also find that RbpA’s impact on Fdx activity in vivo extends beyond the role of the NTT in binding the antibiotic, revealing a dominant contribution for RNAP conformation in Fdx sensitivity. In vitro assays that monitor the production of a 3-nucleotide product as a proxy of RPo stability have shown that addition of Fdx to M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA holoenzymes reduces the amount of RPo formed following the subsequent addition of NTPs and a DNA template harboring the M. tuberculosis rrnAP3 promoter (11Boyaci H. Chen J. Lilic M. Palka M. Mooney R.A. Landick R. Darst S.A. Campbell E.A. Fidaxomicin jams mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase motions needed for initiation via RBPA contacts.Elife. 2018; 7e34823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). We used this assay with a range of Fdx concentrations to calculate the concentration of Fdx that inhibits 50% of RPo (IC50) formed by RNAP-σA on the rrnAP3 promoter in the presence or absence of different RbpA variants. Addition of WT RbpAMtb (RbpAMtbWT) to the RNAP-σA holoenzyme increases the sensitivity of the RNAP-σA holoenzyme to Fdx in this assay, and this is dependent on the presence of the NTT (deleted in the RbpAMtb26–111 and RbpAMtb72–111 mutants) (11Boyaci H. Chen J. Lilic M. Palka M. Mooney R.A. Landick R. Darst S.A. Campbell E.A. Fidaxomicin jams mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase motions needed for initiation via RBPA contacts.Elife. 2018; 7e34823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1, A–C). Deletion of both the RbpA NTT and CD resulted in an IC50 within the confidence interval of the IC50 when the NTT alone was deleted (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that the presence of the RbpA CD does not affect Fdx activity against M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA in vitro. In contrast, an R88A substitution in the RbpA SID that weakens the interaction between RbpA and the RNAP resulted in an IC50 that was lower and outside the confidence interval, compared to RbpAMtbWT, suggesting that domains outside of the NTT could increase Fdx sensitivity (Fig. 1C). Importantly, a saturating concentration of RbpA protein was used in these assays, and therefore, the different effects of RbpA variants on Fdx sensitivity in this assay should not be a result of altered proportions of RbpA-bound RNAP-σA complexes. Structural studies predicted that the NTT contributes contacts with Fdx when the antibiotic is bound to the M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA holoenzyme (PDB: 6BZO), specifically through a water-mediated interaction between RbpA E17 and Fdx (Fig. 1D) (11Boyaci H. Chen J. Lilic M. Palka M. Mooney R.A. Landick R. Darst S.A. Campbell E.A. Fidaxomicin jams mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase motions needed for initiation via RBPA contacts.Elife. 2018; 7e34823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). To determine whether the predicted interaction between Fdx and RbpA E17 underpins NTT-dependent Fdx activity, we calculated the IC50 of Fdx in the presence of RbpAMtbWT versus an RbpAMtbE17A mutant protein. The activity of Fdx against the M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA in the presence of RbpAMtbE17A was nearly equal to Fdx activity against the M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA in the presence of RbpAMtbWT, indicating that alterations in the size and charge of the amino acid side chain at RbpA NTT position 17 do not impact Fdx activity against the M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA (Fig. 1, B and C). The structure in Boyaci et al. (11Boyaci H. Chen J. Lilic M. Palka M. Mooney R.A. Landick R. Darst S.A. Campbell E.A. Fidaxomicin jams mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase motions needed for initiation via RBPA contacts.Elife. 2018; 7e34823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) also highlights potential van der Waals interactions between RbpA R10 and Fdx in the RNAP-σA holoenzyme bound to double stranded forked DNA (PDB: 6BZO) (Fig. 1D); however, given the distance between RbpA R10 and Fdx, one would predict this to be a weak interaction. In a separate structure of RbpA bound to M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA in complex with two double-stranded forked DNA molecules that mimics the RPo (PDB: 6C04), the RbpA R10 positively charged side chain is positioned within 2.4 Å of the negatively charged side chain of σA3.2 D441, forming a polar interaction (11Boyaci H. Chen J. Lilic M. Palka M. Mooney R.A. Landick R. Darst S.A. Campbell E.A. Fidaxomicin jams mycobacterium tuberculosis RNA polymerase motions needed for initiation via RBPA contacts.Elife. 2018; 7e34823Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1E). Fdx activity against E. coli RNAP-σ70 holoenzyme lacking σ703.2 is attenuated approximately 20-fold (32Morichaud Z. Chaloin L. Brodolin K. Regions 1.2 and 3.2 of the RNA polymerase σ subunit promote DNA melting and attenuate action of the antibiotic Lipiarmycin.J. Mol. Biol. 2016; 428: 463-476Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), indicating that σ703.2 contributes to Fdx inhibition of the E. coli RNAP. Therefore, if RbpA R10 interacts with σA3.2, this may also affect Fdx activity. To examine whether RbpA R10 contributes to M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA Fdx sensitivity, we measured Fdx IC50 against the M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA in the presence of RbpAMtbR10A. Similar to the RbpAMtbE17A mutant, we observed no change in Fdx IC50s against the M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA in the presence of RbpAMtbR10A compared to RbpAMtbWT (Fig. 1, B and C), indicating that the R10 residue is not required for RbpA NTT-dependent Fdx activity. To determine the effect of disrupting the contacts made by the both RbpA E17 and R10, we measured the Fdx IC50 against M. tuberculosis RNAP-σA in the presence of RbpAMtbR10A/E17A. Mutating both the R10 and E17 residues resulted in an approximately 3-fold increase in the Fdx IC50 compared to RbpAMtbWT, although this was still at least 5-fold lower than RbpA mutants lacking the entire NTT (RbpAMtb26–111 and RbpAMtb72–111) (Fig. 1, B and C). These data indicate that loss of one of these residues increases the importance of the other for Fdx activity, but additional mechanisms also contribute to NTT-dependent Fdx activity in vitro. Previous work showed that truncation of the RbpA NT"

Here, we explore synergy occurring between synthetic glucocorticoids (dexamethasone and budesonide) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL1B and TNF) on the expression of the toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). This effect is observed in epithelial cell lines and both undifferentiated and differentiated primary human bronchial epithelial cells (pHBECs). In A549 cells, IL1B-plus-glucocorticoid-induced TLR2 expression required nuclear factor (NF)-κB and GR. Likewise, in A549 cells, BEAS-2B cells, and pHBECs, chromatin immunoprecipitation identified GR- and NF-κB/p65-binding regions ∼32 kb (R1) and ∼7.3 kb (R2) upstream of the TLR2 gene. Treatment of BEAS-2B cells with TNF or/and dexamethasone followed by global run-on sequencing confirmed transcriptional activity at these regions. Furthermore, cloning R1 or R2 into luciferase reporters revealed transcriptional activation by budesonide or IL1B, respectively, while R1+R2 juxtaposition enabled synergistic activation by IL1B and budesonide. In addition, small-molecule inhibitors and siRNA knockdown showed p38α MAPK to negatively regulate both IL1B-induced TLR2 expression and R1+R2 reporter activity. Finally, agonism of IL1B-plus-dexamethasone-induced TLR2 in A549 cells and pHBECs stimulated NF-κB- and interferon regulatory factor-dependent reporter activity and chemokine release. We conclude that glucocorticoid-plus-cytokine-driven synergy at TLR2 involves GR and NF-κB acting via specific enhancer regions, which combined with the inhibition of p38α MAPK promotes TLR2 expression. Subsequent inflammatory effects that occur following TLR2 agonism may be pertinent in severe neutrophilic asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, where glucocorticoid-based therapies are less efficacious."

The molecular mechanism by which leptin controls glucose homeostasis remains largely unknown. Here, we use a zebrafish model to show that Wnt signaling mediates the glucoregulatory effects of leptin. Under normal feeding conditions, leptin regulates glucose homeostasis but not adipostasis in zebrafish. In times of nutrient excess, however, we found that leptin also regulates body weight and size. Using a Wnt signaling reporter fish, we show that leptin activates the canonical Wnt pathway in vivo. Utilizing two paradigms for hyperglycemia, it is revealed that leptin regulates glucose homeostasis via the Wnt pathway, as pharmacological inhibition of this pathway impairs the glucoregulatory actions of leptin. Our results may shed new light on the evolution of the physiological function of leptin."
https://openalex.org/W4225774004,"The biosynthesis of many sulfur-containing molecules depends on cysteine as a sulfur source. Both the cysteine desulfurase (CD) and rhodanese (Rhd) domain-containing protein families participate in the trafficking of sulfur for various metabolic pathways in bacteria and human, but their connection is not yet described in plants. The existence of natural chimeric proteins containing both CD and Rhd domains in specific bacterial genera, however, suggests a general interaction between these proteins. We report here the biochemical relationships between two cytosolic proteins from Arabidopsis thaliana, a Rhd domain-containing protein, the sulfurtransferase 18 (STR18), and a CD isoform referred to as ABA3, and compare these biochemical features to those of a natural CD-Rhd fusion protein from the bacterium Pseudorhodoferax sp. We observed that the bacterial enzyme is bifunctional exhibiting both CD and STR activities using l-cysteine and thiosulfate as sulfur donors but preferentially using l-cysteine to catalyze transpersulfidation reactions. In vitro activity assays and mass spectrometry analyses revealed that STR18 stimulates the CD activity of ABA3 by reducing the intermediate persulfide on its catalytic cysteine, thereby accelerating the overall transfer reaction. We also show that both proteins interact in planta and form an efficient sulfur relay system, whereby STR18 catalyzes transpersulfidation reactions from ABA3 to the model acceptor protein roGFP2. In conclusion, the ABA3-STR18 couple likely represents an uncharacterized pathway of sulfur trafficking in the cytosol of plant cells, independent of ABA3 function in molybdenum cofactor maturation."

Factors influencing information content with or without information demand were investigated.A total of 55 visits were analyzed. The average content score for the information discussed spontaneously was 16.2% with the standard deviation (SD) equal to15.6. The score improved significantly after information was demanded by the SP; the average total information content score became 34.4% (SD = 16) with p < 0.001. The score of information discussed spontaneously was higher for male pharmacy staff, older age, more experience, and a Pharm D degree. When the SP prompted or demanded for information, older pharmacy staff with more experience and with a college degree scored higher.

However, little attention has been devoted to the potentially beneficial impact of clown visits in the child and adolescent psychiatry setting. Therefore, this pilot study aims at investigating short-term effects of clown visits by RED NOSES Clowndoctors Austria on stress and mood levels of children and adolescents in psychiatric care. The sample will consist of approximately 50 children and adolescents in inpatient psychiatric wards who receive clown visits on a weekly basis over four consecutive weeks. The examined intervention, i.e., the clown visits, is an integral part within the selected psychiatric institutions. Using a non-controlled pre-/post-test design, the level of salivary cortisol and self-reported stress and mood will be measured as primary outcomes before and immediately after each clown visit. Additionally, self-reported effects on care staff at the health care facilities will be assessed based on a questionnaire after each clown visit within the same time period of four weeks. Secondary outcome measures (i.e., health-related quality of life, emotional and conduct problems, perceived chronic stress) will be assessed at baseline and at close-out assessment after the four intervention weeks. Further control variables and potential moderators are included at baseline. Due to the nested data structure, multilevel modeling will be used to analyze the data. To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine the stress-reducing and mood-improving effects of clown visits on inpatients in child and adolescent psychiatry. Results will be relevant for the design of future large-scale RCTs and might provide valuable implications for the use of healthcare clowning to reduce stress and improve mood in children and adolescents in psychiatric care.

Previous studies finding that pFN is significantly reduced in sepsis, however, whether reduced pFn affects the prognosis of sepsis has not been clarified. Here, we detected and analyzed pFN and other conventional inflammatory markers in advanced sepsis patients and performed correlation analysis with SOFA score. We also used Fn gene conditional knockout mice which were performed by cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) to investigate the effect of FN deficiency on sepsis prognosis. We found, compared with procalcitonin, c-reactive protein, and interleukin-6, pFN was more correlated with SOFA score in advanced sepsis patients (r −.720, p < .001). In animal experiments, Fn gene knockout mice showed significantly greater mortality after CLP compared with the control group because of inhibited phagocytosis and bacterial clearance ability of macrophages, with double cytokine storm. Furthermore, FN can regulate macrophages through the integrin α5β1/Fak/Src signaling pathway. Overall, we found pFN can more accurately reflect the severity and prognosis of advanced sepsis. The absence of FN altered the cytokine storm and phagocytic function of macrophages, suggesting that FN could be a potential therapeutic target in sepsis."
https://openalex.org/W4212914916,"AmphL is a cytochrome P450 enzyme that catalyzes the C8 oxidation of 8-deoxyamphotericin B to the polyene macrolide antibiotic, amphotericin B. To understand this substrate selectivity, we solved the crystal structure of AmphL to a resolution of 2.0 Å in complex with amphotericin B and performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A detailed comparison with the closely related P450, PimD, which catalyzes the epoxidation of 4,5-desepoxypimaricin to the macrolide antibiotic, pimaricin, reveals key catalytic structural features responsible for stereo- and regio-selective oxidation. Both P450s have a similar access channel that runs parallel to the active site I helix over the surface of the heme. Molecular dynamics simulations of substrate binding reveal PimD can ""pull"" substrates further into the P450 access channel owing to additional electrostatic interactions between the protein and the carboxyl group attached to the hemiketal ring of 4,5-desepoxypimaricin. This substrate interaction is absent in AmphL although the additional substrate -OH groups in 8-deoxyamphotericin B help to correctly position the substrate for C8 oxidation. Simulations of the oxy-complex indicates that these -OH groups may also participate in a proton relay network required for O2 activation as has been suggested for two other macrolide P450s, PimD and P450eryF. These findings provide experimentally testable models that can potentially contribute to a new generation of novel macrolide antibiotics with enhanced antifungal and/or antiprotozoal efficacy."
https://openalex.org/W4212959990,"Few large-scale studies have been conducted to show the joint effects of mortality associated with physical activity and sedentarism. Therefore, we examined the relationship between all-cause mortality and behavioral patterns among adults in the United States. Data of 17,730 non-institutionalized US civilians aged ≥20 years were extracted from the 2007-2014 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. We set the criteria for metabolic equivalents as 600 according to the WHO guideline, and sedentary time as 300 min/day according to the median. The Cox proportional hazards model was adjusted for demographic and lifestyle characteristics. During the 58.54±28.18 months follow-up, all-cause mortality rate was 4% and heart-related and cancer mortality rate was 1%. Participants in the high metabolic equivalents and low sedentary time group had a lower risk of all-cause (hazard ratio = 0.41, 95% confidence interval = 0.34-0.50), cardiovascular (hazard ratio = 0.36; 95% confidence interval = 0.23-0.55), and cancer (hazard ratio = 0.55; 95% confidence interval = 0.37-0.83) mortality, compared to those in the low metabolic equivalents and high sedentary time group. Sufficient physical activity and less sedentary behavior reduce all-cause and cause-specific mortality in adults in the United States, especially cardiovascular mortality among the elderly. Additional nationwide policies to improve behavioral patterns among adults need to be implemented in the United States."

Nowadays, it is essential to monitor the liquidity crisis, which is closely linked to corporate crises. The aim of the paper is to analyse a selected sector of the economy from the perspective of the corporate crisis and to identify the factors of crisis. More than 2000 engineering companies in Slovakia were analysed during the period from 2015 to 2019 with the aim of analysing financial results, especially in the area of financial forecast for the future. In the analysis, statistical testing of the significance of relationships using the Spearman correlation coefficient, the significance of differences by the power of t-test, regression and clustering were used. A significant part of the paper is the analysis of selected indicators of the company's crisis-Altman's Z score and the IN05 index. The results indicate that engineering companies in Slovakia are achieving good results and their financial situation is improving within the years between 2015-2019. The results can also be used as a starting point for research concerning the impact of COVID-19 in this area. In the context of corporate crisis management, engineering companies behave in the same way but it is necessary to monitor individual factors that can detect a corporate crisis. Possible measures would thus lead to the stabilization of financial results and long-term sustainable positive prospects for companies in the future."
https://openalex.org/W4213080180,"To investigate the impact of two CO2 observation datasets obtained from the Korean Peninsula on the surface CO2 flux estimation over Asia, the two datasets are assimilated into the CarbonTracker (CT) inverse modeling system and the estimated surface CO2 fluxes are analyzed. Anmyeon-do (AMY) and Gosan (GSN) sites in the Korean Peninsula have observed surface CO2 mole fraction since the late 1990s. To investigate the effect of assimilating the additional Korean observations on the surface CO2 flux estimation over Asia, two experiments are conducted. The reference experiment (CNTL) only assimilates observations provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), while the other experiment (EXP1) assimilates both NOAA observations and two Korean observation datasets. The results are analyzed for 9 years from 2003 to 2011 in Asia region because both AMY and GSN datasets exist almost completely for this period. The annual average of estimated biosphere CO2 flux of EXP1 shows more flux absorption in summer and less flux emission from fall to spring compared to CNTL, mainly on Eurasia Temperate and Eurasia Boreal regions. When comparing model results to independent CO2 concentration data from surface stations and aircraft, the root mean square error is smaller for EXP1 than CNTL. The EXP1 yields more reduction on uncertainty of estimated biosphere CO2 flux over Asia, and the observation impact of AMY, GSN sites on flux estimation is approximately 11%, which is greater than other observation sites around the world. Therefore, the two CO2 observation sets in the Korean Peninsula are useful in reducing uncertainties for regional as well as global scale CO2 flux estimation."
https://openalex.org/W4213130220,"During ricin intoxication in mammalian cells, ricin's enzymatic (RTA) and binding (RTB) subunits disassociate in the endoplasmic reticulum. RTA is then translocated into the cytoplasm where, by virtue of its ability to depurinate a conserved residue within the sarcin-ricin loop (SRL) of 28S rRNA, it functions as a ribosome-inactivating protein. It has been proposed that recruitment of RTA to the SRL is facilitated by ribosomal P-stalk proteins, whose C-terminal domains interact with a cavity on RTA normally masked by RTB; however, evidence that this interaction is critical for RTA activity within cells is lacking. Here, we characterized a collection of single-domain antibodies (VHHs) whose epitopes overlap with the P-stalk binding pocket on RTA. The crystal structures of three such VHHs (V9E1, V9F9, and V9B2) in complex with RTA revealed not only occlusion of the ribosomal P-stalk binding pocket but also structural mimicry of C-terminal domain peptides by complementarity-determining region 3. In vitro assays confirmed that these VHHs block RTA-P-stalk peptide interactions and protect ribosomes from depurination. Moreover, when expressed as ""intrabodies,"" these VHHs rendered cells resistant to ricin intoxication. One VHH (V9F6), whose epitope was structurally determined to be immediately adjacent to the P-stalk binding pocket, was unable to neutralize ricin within cells or protect ribosomes from RTA in vitro. These findings are consistent with the recruitment of RTA to the SRL by ribosomal P-stalk proteins as a requisite event in ricin-induced ribosome inactivation."
https://openalex.org/W4213183690,"Hypertension has reached epidemic levels in rural China, where loneliness has been a major problem among community dwellers as a consequence of rural-to-urban migration among younger generations. The objective of the study is to investigate the association between loneliness and hypertension, and whether social support can buffer the association (i.e., stress buffering theory), using cross-sectional data from 765 adults (mean age: 59.1 years) in rural Fujian, China.Social support was measured as the reciprocal instrumental social support from/to neighbors and the reciprocal emotional support (i.e., the number of close friends that the respondent could turn to for help immediately when they are in trouble). A mixed-effect Poisson regression model with a robust variance estimator was used to investigate the association between loneliness, social support, and hypertension.Analysis revealed that those who were lonely had a higher prevalence ratio for hypertension (prevalence ratio = 1.12, 95% confidence interval 0.99-1.26) compared to those who reported not being lonely. There was an interaction between social support and loneliness in relation to hypertension. Specifically, contrary to the stress buffering theory, the positive association between loneliness and hypertension was more pronounced among those who reported higher social support compared to those who reported lower support (p for interaction <0.001 for instrumental support).The results suggest that being lonely despite high levels of social support poses the greatest risk for hypertension. This study did not confirm a buffering effect of social support on the association between loneliness and hypertension."
https://openalex.org/W4212763652,"Keratoconus is the corneal disease with the highest reported incidence of 1:2000. The treatment's level of success highly depends on how early it was started. Subsequently, a fast and highly capable diagnostic tool is crucial. While there are many computer-based systems that are capable of the analysis of medical image data, they only provide parameters. These have advanced quite far, though full diagnosis does not exist. Machine learning has provided the capabilities for the parameters, and numerous similar scientific fields have developed full image diagnosis based on neural networks. The Homburg Keratoconus Center has been gathering almost 2000 patient datasets, over 1000 of them over the course of their disease. Backed by this databank, this work aims to develop a convolutional neural network to tackle diagnosis of keratoconus as the major corneal disease."
https://openalex.org/W4213324879,"Ecological and life-history data on the Northern European macromoth (Lepidoptera: Macroheterocera) fauna is widely available and ideal for use in answering phylogeny-based research questions: for example, in comparative biology. However, phylogenetic information for such studies lags behind. Here, as a synthesis of all currently available phylogenetic information on the group, we produce a supertree of 114 Northern European macromoth genera (in four superfamilies, with Geometroidea considered separately), providing the most complete phylogenetic picture of this fauna available to date. In doing so, we assess those parts of the phylogeny that are well resolved and those that are uncertain. Furthermore, we identify those genera for which phylogenetic information is currently too poor to include in such a supertree, or entirely absent, as targets for future work. As an aid to studies involving these genera, we provide information on their likely positions within the macromoth tree. With phylogenies playing an ever more important role in the field, this supertree should be useful in informing future ecological and evolutionary studies."
https://openalex.org/W4213377674,"Course-based research experiences (CREs) are designed to engage students in authentic scientific experiences that are embedded into a standard curriculum. CREs provide valuable research experiences to large numbers of undergraduate biology students, however, CRE implementation can require many personnel. Because limited personnel may be a barrier to widespread CRE implementation, our goal was to discover which personnel students valued throughout a CRE and the ways they were valuable. We investigated students' perceptions of personnel resources throughout a semester-long CRE using two survey approaches. Using a text message survey administered multiple times per week, real-time data was collected about which personnel resource students perceived to be the most helpful. Using a web-based survey administered five times throughout the semester, retrospective data was collected about how often students used each personnel resource and how helpful students perceived each personnel resource to be. Graduate teaching assistants (TAs) were consistently selected as the most helpful personnel resource by the majority of respondents throughout the semester, with most respondents describing graduate TAs providing project-specific feedback. Although less frequently, undergraduate TAs were also consistently selected as the most helpful personnel resource. Respondents described undergraduate TAs providing project-specific feedback, general feedback, and project-specific resources. Data from the retrospective, web-based survey largely mirrored the real-time, text message survey data. Throughout the semester, most respondents reported using graduate TAs ""Often"" or ""Always"" and that graduate TAs were ""Very"" or ""Extremely"" helpful. Throughout most of the semester, most respondents also reported using undergraduate TAs ""Often"" or ""Always"" and that undergraduate TAs were ""Very"" or ""Extremely"" helpful. The results of this descriptive study underscore the importance of graduate and undergraduate TAs in the development and implementation of CREs, emphasizing the need for departments and course coordinators to be intentional in planning TA training that prepares TAs to fulfill their critical role in CRE implementation."
