So far, phosphorylation of FTY720 by murine sphingosine kinase (SPHK) 1a had been documented. We found that, while FTY720 is also phosphorylated by human SPHK1, the human type 2 isoform phosphorylates the drug 30-fold more efficiently, because of a lower Km of FTY720 for SPHK2. Similarly, murine SPHK2 was more efficient than SPHK1a. Among splice variants of the human SPHKs, an N-terminally extended SPHK2 isoform was even more active than SPHK2 itself. Further SPHK superfamily members, namely ceramide kinase and a “SPHK-like” protein, failed to phosphorylate sphingosine and FTY720. Thus, only SPHK1 and 2 appear to be capable of phosphorylating FTY720. Using selective assay conditions, SPHK1 and 2 activities in murine tissues were measured. While activity of SPHK2 toward sphingosine was generally lower than of SPHK1, FTY720 phosphorylation was higher under conditions favoring SPHK2. In human endothelial cells, while activity of SPHK1 toward sphingosine was 2-fold higher than of SPHK2, FTY720 phosphorylation was 7-fold faster under SPHK2 assay conditions. Finally, FTY720 was poorly phosphorylated in human blood as compared with rodent blood, in line with the low activity of SPHK1 and in particular of SPHK2 in human blood. To conclude, both SPHK1 and 2 are capable of phosphorylating FTY720, but SPHK2 is quantitatively more important than SPHK1.

FTY720 is an immunomodulatory drug, which is highly efficacious in models of transplantation and of autoimmune diseases (1Brinkmann V. Pinschewer D.D. Feng L. Chen S. Transplantation. 2001; 72: 764-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). It was recently found to be effective in kidney transplantation in humans (2Brinkmann V. Lynch K.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). FTY720 elicits a lymphopenia resulting from the reversible redistribution of lymphocytes from the circulation to secondary lymphoid organs, without leading to general immunosuppression (3Pinschewer D.D.

Kawaguchi T. Ohtsuki M. Hoshino Y. J. Immunol. 1998; 160: 5037-5044PubMed Google Scholar). Conversion of FTY720 to its monophosphate appears to be essential for the effects of the drug on lymphocyte homing, since FTY720 phosphate acts as an agonist at four of the five G-protein-coupled receptors for sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) 1The abbreviations used are: S1Psphingosine-1-phosphateAAL2-amino-4-(4-heptyloxyphenyl)-2-methylbutan-1-olCERKceramide kinaseDGKdiacylglycerol kinaseFCSfetal calf serumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPhuSPHKhuman sphingosine kinaseHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsmuSPHKmurine sphingosine kinaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRefSeqNCBI Reference Sequence ProjectSPHKsphingosine kinaseTLCthin-layer chromatographyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.1The abbreviations used are: S1Psphingosine-1-phosphateAAL2-amino-4-(4-heptyloxyphenyl)-2-methylbutan-1-olCERKceramide kinaseDGKdiacylglycerol kinaseFCSfetal calf serumGFPgreen fluorescent proteinEGFPenhanced GFPhuSPHKhuman sphingosine kinaseHUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cellsmuSPHKmurine sphingosine kinaseRACErapid amplification of cDNA endsRefSeqNCBI Reference Sequence ProjectSPHKsphingosine kinaseTLCthin-layer chromatographyMOPS4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid.

Lynch K.R. Curr. Opin. Immunol. 2002; 14: 569-575Crossref PubMed Scopus (253) Google Scholar). More recently, FTY720 was found to stimulate multidrug transporter-dependent T-cell chemotaxis to lymph nodes (7Honig S.M. Fu S. Mao X. Yopp A. Gunn M.D. Randolph G.J Bromberg J.S. J. Clin. Invest. 2003; 111: 627-637Crossref PubMed Scopus (120) Google Scholar); in this instance, FTY720 phosphate as the active metabolite is hypothesized to be responsible for stimulation of efflux activity of the lipid transporter Abcb1.FTY720 has been reported to be phosphorylated ex vivo by rodent lymphoid tissues (5Brinkmann V.

After oral application of FTY720 to rats, the blood levels of the monophosphate exceeded those of the parent compound 2–4 fold (5Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R.

FTY720 was shown to be a substrate for recombinant murine sphingosine kinase 1a (muSPHK1a) (5Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T.

Studies with chiral analogs of FTY720 (namely the R- and S-enantiomers of 2-amino-4-(4-heptyloxyphenyl)-2-methylbutan-1-ol (AAL) (5Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R.

Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T. Hiestand P. Foster C.A. Zollinger M. Lynch K.R. J. Biol.

It was concluded that phosphorylation of FTY720 by SPHK type 1 is essential for its biological activity.More recently, a second SPHK isoform has been identified and the mouse and human type 2 enzymes have been cloned (8Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (558) Google Scholar); human SPHK (huSPHK) type 2 shares conserved domains with huSPHK1 (about 80% similarity) but carries additional amino acids in the center and at the N terminus, making it a larger protein (383 versus 618 amino acids for huSPHK1 and 2, respectively). Distinct kinetic differences have been described for the two enzymes (8Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (558) Google Scholar). Expression of SPHK1 was reported to be highest in lung and spleen, and of SPHK2 in liver and heart (8Liu H. Sugiura M. Nava V.E. Edsall L.C. Kono K. Poulton S. Milstien S. Kohama T. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 275: 19513-19520Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (558) Google Scholar, 9Kohama T.

SPHKs have received considerable interest because their natural reaction product S1P has been recognized as a signaling molecule with both intra- and extracellular actions (recently reviewed in Refs. 10Spiegel S. Milstien S. Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2003; 4: 397-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (1734) Google Scholar and 11Hla T. Pharmacol. Res. 2003; 47: 401-407Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). Presently, a clear cut functional difference between the two enzymes SPHK1 and 2 has not been described, and most studies so far measured total SPHK activity increases upon stimulation of cells; only recently, selective antisense DNA and siRNA tools have been utilized (12Melendez A.J. Khaw A.K. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 17255-17262Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar, 13Shu X. Wu W. Mosteller R.D. Broek D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 7758-7768Crossref PubMed Scopus (242) Google Scholar).Here we studied the phosphorylation of FTY720 by recombinant SPHK1 and 2 in vitro and by the endogeneous enzymes in murine tissues and in human endothelial cells. We conclude that, while both enzymes are contributing to FTY720 phosphorylation in vivo, SPHK2 is quantitatively the more important enzyme in producing the active form FTY720 phosphate. Furthermore, we determined the tissue distribution of SPHK1 and 2 enzyme activities in the mouse, to supplement previous studies on total SPHK activity in rats (14Gijsbers S. Van der Hoeven G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar).EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMaterials—S1P and d-erythro-sphingosine were from Biomol Research Laboratory Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). N-octanoyl ceramide was from Sigma. [γ-32P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and [3H]sphingosine (23.5 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Biosciences. FTY720 and its monophosphate, [3H]FTY720 (50.1 Ci/mmol) and the R- and S-enantiomers of 2-amino-4-(4-heptyloxyphenyl)-2-methylbutan-1-ol (AAL) were synthesized at Novartis Pharma.Cell Culture—HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA; CRL-1573) and cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/10% fetal calf serum (FCS) at 37 °C/5% CO2. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were isolated and cultured in human endothelial-serum free medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FCS (Invitrogen), 250 μg/ml dibutyryl cyclic AMP (Sigma), 10 μg/ml epidermal growth factor (BD Biosciences), and 1 μg/ml hydrocortisone (Sigma) at 37 °C, 5% CO2. These cells were used in passages 2 to 5; experiments were performed in collagen-coated plates.Cloning of Human Lipid Kinases and Variants—SPHK1 was amplified by PCR from human fetal cDNA (Clontech) using EXL DNA Polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using primers 5′-GCATTAGAATTCATGGATCCAGCGGGCGGCCCC and 5′-TAACGCGTCGACTCATAAGGGCTCTTCTGGCGGTGGCATCTG, which include terminal EcoRI and SalI restriction sites, respectively. Using these sites the amplified fragment was cloned into the expression vector pEGFP-C2 (Clontech) in-frame with an N-terminal EGFP fusion part (EGFP is a red-shifted variant of the wild-type green fluorescent protein, GFP); the amino acid sequence of the insert was identical to the SPHK1 protein sequence in SwissProt (Q9NYA1; AAG01980 in GenPept).In addition, two SPHK1 variants, one 14 and the other 86 amino acid longer at the N terminus (designated SPHK1+14 and SPHK1+86, accession numbers NP_068807 (in the NCBI Reference Sequence Project data base (RefSeq)) and AAH14439 (GenPept), respectively) were retrieved from the IMAGE Consortium Mammalian Gene Collection. They were amplified with Pfu Ultra (Stratagene) using the respective forward primers 5′CACCATGGATCCAGTGGTCGGTTGCGGACG for SPHK1+14 and 5′-CACCATGTCCGCTCAAG TTCTGGGATTTTTACG for SPHK1+86, and 5′-TCATAAGGGCTCTTCTGGCGGTGGCATCTG as reverse primer. The amplified DNA fragments were purified and cloned in pENTR/S.D./d-TOPO (Invitrogen). For expression, constructs were transferred to pcDNA6.2-DEST (native constructs) or pcDNA-DEST53 (to get N-terminally fused GFP constructs) by recombination using the LR clonase (Invitrogen).SPHK2 was amplified using primers 5′-GCATTAGAATTCATGGCCCCGCCCCCACCGCCACTGGCT and 5′-TAACGCGTCGACTCAGGGCTCCCGCCCCGGGCAGCCAGG and cloned into pEGFP-C2. The sequence obtained was identical to that published by Liu et al. (14Gijsbers S. Van der Hoeven G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar) (GenPept: AAF74124; SwissProt: Q9NRA0-2). A cloned variant with 36 additional amino acids at the N terminus (SPHK2 + 36; GenPept™: AAH06161) was obtained from the IMAGE Consortium Mammalian Gene Collection. The DNA insert was amplified with Pfu Ultra and the primers 5′-CACCATGAATGGACACCTTGAAGCAGAGG and 5′-TCAGGGCTCCCGCCCCGGGC, then purified, cloned in pENTR/S.D./d-TOPO, and finally transferred to the expression vectors pcDNA6.2-DEST or pcDNA-DEST53 as described above.A cDNA featuring similarity to SPHKs (RefSeq: NP_060708; designated here as “SPHK-like”) was retrieved from an in house cDNA library and subcloned in pENTR/S.D./d-TOPO after amplification with Pfu Ultra and the following primer set: 5′-CACCATGACGGTGTTCTTTAAAACGC and 5′-TCACTGGGTGGGGCTTGTGAGCATC. An N-terminal EGFP-SPHK-like fusion construct was also prepared by PCR, cloned in pENTR/S.D./d-TOPO and transferred for expression to pcDNA6.2-DEST.Ceramide kinase (CERK) cDNA was obtained in two steps: a 5′-RACE (rapid amplification of cDNA ends) PCR was performed on a human leukemia Marathon cDNA library (Clontech) using Advantage GC polymerase (Clontech) and the primers 5′-CCATCCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGC and 5′-AGCAGCGATGTCCTAACCGTAAACG. The full coding sequence was obtained by 5′ extension of the longest clone in successive PCR rounds using Pfu Ultra with the forward primers 247–315, 198–266, 149–217, and 127–168, and the same reverse primer 1757–1778 for all reactions (numbers correspond to sequence positions of GenBank™ accession number AB079066). A final PCR product encoding the complete ORF of CERK (identical to AB079066 (15Sugiura M. Kono K. Liu H. Shimizugawa T. Minekura H. Spiegel S. Kohama T. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 23294-23300Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar)) was obtained using 5′-CACCATGGGGGCGACGGGGGCGGCG and 5′-TCAGCTGTGTGAGTCT G GCTTCG and cloned in pENTR/S.D./ d-TOPO. An N-terminal EGFP-CERK fusion construct was also prepared by PCR and cloned in pENTR/S.D./d-TOPO. For expression, constructs were transferred to pcDNA6.2-DEST.Cloning of Murine Sphingosine Kinases—MuSPHK1a and 2 were amplified from total RNA of murine lung and from a mouse liver cDNA (Stratagene), respectively. Both PCR products were cloned for expression into pEGFP-C2 as described above for huSPHK1. The amino acid sequence of the insert was identical to the muSPHK1 and 2 protein sequences in SwissProt (O88885 and Q9JIA7, respectively).Search of the Human Genome for SPHK Homologues—We used BLAST to search the PIR-NREF (pir.georgetown.edu/pirwww/search/pirnref.shtml), the databases of NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi) and of Celera Discovery System (cds.premier.celera.com/cds/login.cfm) for homologues of SPHK1 and SPHK2. Each hit was used in a subsequent search as a query. Sequences detected by both SPHKs and by all hits reflexively were considered as members of the group of SPHK homologues.Expression of Proteins in HEK293 Cells—HEK293 cells were seeded at 1 × 106 cells/well in 6-well plates. After 24 h, cells were transfected with 4 μg of vector alone or with vectors containing kinase constructs using calcium phosphate (16Schenborn E.T. Goiffon V. Methods Mol. Biol. 2000; 130: 135-145PubMed Google Scholar). Cells were incubated for 24 h (sphingosine kinases) or 48 h (SPHK-like protein and ceramide kinase) following transfection. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into 100 μl of ice-cold SPHK cell lysis buffer (20 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 20% glycerol, 1 mm β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm sodium orthovanadate, 15 mm NaF, 40 mm β-glycerophosphate, 0.5 mm deoxpyridoxine, and complete™ protease inhibitors (Roche Applied Science), similar to conditions described in (9Kohama T. Olivera A. Edsall L. Nagiec M.M. Dickson R. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 23722-237228Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar)). Following two freeze/thaw cycles, membranes were centrifuged off (100,000 × g, 60 min, 4 °C) and the supernatant was harvested. In some instances, pellets were re-suspended in lysis buffer for testing. In the case of CERK, the lysis buffer (20 mm MOPS, pH 7.2, 2 mm EGTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, complete™ protease inhibitors, 10% glycerol; as described in Ref. 5Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T. Hiestand P. Foster C.A. Zollinger M. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21453-21457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar) was used alternatively.Protein Analysis—Protein concentration in cell lysates were determined using Bradford reagent (BioRad), with bovine serum albumin as reference. In the case of EGFP fusion proteins, lysates were measured in a fluorescence plate reader (BMG, Offenburg, Germany) at λex = 485 nm and λem = 538 nm to obtain relative fluorescence intensities of the samples. Furthermore, expression of EGFP fusion proteins was monitored by Western blotting using anti-GFP antibodies (ab290; Abcam Ltd., Cambridge, UK).Assay of SPHKs in HEK293 Cell Lysates—Routinely, SPHK activity was measured in total volumes of 100 μl with 20 μm sphingosine or FTY720 (prepared as a complex with bovine serum albumin, as described for sphingosine in Ref. 17Olivera A. Barlow K.D. Spiegel S. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 311: 215-223Crossref PubMed Scopus (70) Google Scholar), 1 mm of ATP, and 2 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP as substrates in buffer U (50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 0.005% Triton X-100, 10 mm KCl, 10 mm NaF, and 1.5 mm semicarbazide); NaF and semicarbazide were included as inhibitors of S1P phosphatase and lyase (14Gijsbers S. Van der Hoeven G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar), respectively, in order to prevent degradation of formed S1P. Reactions were started by addition of protein samples (usually 10 μl/assay). In the case of SPHK1 and 2 and their variants, the cytosolic fraction of the cell lysates was tested; in the case of SPHK-like protein and CERK the membrane fraction was tested in addition. Incubations routinely were carried out for 30 min at 30 °C, but were extended to up to 4 h for SPHK-like protein and CERK. Reactions were stopped by adding 150 μl of 1.33 m KCl in 2.66% HCl, 200 μl of methanol, and 300 μl of chloroform. Samples were mixed, centrifuged, and 200 μl of the organic layer was removed and evaporated in vacuo. The residue was taken up in 25 μl chloroform and applied to a silica gel G-60 thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Merck). TLCs were developed with 1-butanol/acetic acid: water 3:1:1 (v/v) as the mobile phase. Radiolabeled S1P and FTY720 phosphate were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Dynamics Storm PhosphorImager (Sunnyvale, CA) and identified by co-migration with unlabelled standards, which were visualized using vanillin/sulfuric acid reagent (18Stahl E. Thin-layer Chromatography. Springer Verlag, New York1969: 904Google Scholar). For further confirmation of identity, an alternative mobile phase was used for TLC, namely CHCl3/MeOH/H2O/NH3 200:150:29:1.For some experiments, the buffer was changed either to 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 0.5% Triton, 15 mm MgCl2, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1.5 mm semicarbazide (buffer 1, favoring SPHK1 activity) or 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 15 mm MgCl2, 1 m KCl, 10% glycerol, 10 mm NaF, 1.5 mm semicarbazide (buffer 2, favoring SPHK2 activity). Furthermore, in the case of SPHK-like protein and of CERK, substrate concentration was increased to up to 100 μm.Kinetic Measurements with SPHKs—Assays were set up as described above for the routine assay. The 30-min incubation time was found to be in the quasilinear phase of the assay. Concentrations of sphingosine and FTY720 were varied as indicated in the figures. In order to calculate nmol of phosphorylated product from the fluorescence units returned by the PhosphorImager, calibration curves with known amounts of radiolabeled product were established. Enzyme activity was calculated as nmol of product/min/mg of total protein. Kinetic parameters were calculated from the data using the program Grafit (Erithacus Software, Horley, UK).Assay of Ceramide Kinase in HEK293 Cell Lysates—This enzyme was assayed as described by Sugiura et al. (5Brinkmann V. Davis M.D. Heise C.E. Albert R. Cottens S. Hof R. Bruns C. Prieschl E. Baumruker T. Hiestand P. Foster C.A. Zollinger M. Lynch K.R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 21453-21457Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1302) Google Scholar), using N-octanoyl-sphingosine (C8-ceramide) as the substrate.Analysis of muSPHK mRNA Levels in Mouse Tissues—Tissue distribution studies were performed by real-time PCR using reverse-transcribed cDNA samples from a mouse total RNA panel (for brain, kidney, liver, lung, spleen; from BALB/c (8–12 week old) mice; Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). For whole blood and lymph nodes total RNA was isolated using Trizol reagent according to the protocol of the manufacturer (Invitrogen). SPHK PCR primers were designed using the GCG Wisconsin Package (Accelrys Inc.). Primers for SPHK1 were designed to detect both SPHK1a and 1b. The primer for β-actin (Actb) was previously described on www.thelabrat.com/protocols. The testing of primer specificity included melting curve analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis of the PCR products. For PCR reaction 5 μl of a 1:10 diluted cDNA sample was subjected to PCR analysis using primer sets (Table I) specific for the muSPHK1, muSPHK2 and Actb as an endogenous housekeeping control gene. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 μl including SYBR Green PCR master mix as supplied by PE Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA): 1× SYBR Green PCR buffer, 3 mm MgCl2, 0.2 mm dATP/dCTP/dGTP, 0.4 mm dUTP, 0.6 U AmpliTaq Gold, 0.25 units of AmpEraseUNG (to prevent carry-over of previous PCR products). Amplification cycles were as follows: 2 min at 50 °C (treatment with AmpEraseUNG), 10 min at 95 °C (activation of Ampli-Taq Gold) and 40 cycles of 15 s at 95 °C followed by 1 min at 60 °C for product amplification. Incubation and on-line detection of PCR products were carried out with optical 96-well plates in the ABI Prism 7700 Sequence Detection System from PE Applied Biosystems. Each PCR reaction was performed in duplicate. Based on melting curve analysis no primer-dimers were generated during the applied 40 real-time PCR amplification cycles. To determine real-time PCR efficiency for one cycle in the exponential phase, dilution series of one of the cDNA samples under investigation over four orders of magnitude were used for each primer pair to create a relative standard curve. The PCR efficiency (E) was then calculated from the slope of the standard curve based on the linear regression analysis (CT as the Y values versus log(serial dilutions) as the X values) using the formula E = 10–1/slope; R2 value shows linearity of the standard curve (perfect linearity: R2 = 1) (Table I). For relative quantification of target gene transcripts normalized to Actb and relative to a calibrator a mathematical model, the “Delta-delta CT method,” developed by PE Applied Biosystems (PerkinElmer) was used. Thus, the calibrator (brain is designated as the calibrator in our calculations) has a value of 1, and all other quantities are expressed as an n-fold difference relative to the calibrator.Table IPrimers used for RT-PCRPrimer, accession number of geneSequence (5′-3′)RT-PCR efficiency (E) and linearity (R2)mSPHK1, AF068749F: ggcagtcatgtccggtgatgE = 1.894; R2 = 0.9985R: acagcagtgtgcagttgatgagmSPHK2, AF245448F: acagaaccatgcccgtgagE = 1.980; R2 = 0.9959R: aggtcaacaccgacaacctgActb, NM_007393F: aggtcatcactattggcaacgaE = 1.836; R2 = 0.9964R: cacttcatgatggaattgaatgtagtt Open table in a new tab Analysis of SPHK Activity in Mouse Tissues—Activity in mouse tissues was determined in analogy to procedures described by Gijsbers et al. (14Gijsbers S. Van der Hoeven G. Van Veldhoven P.P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 2001; 1532: 37-50Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Female Balb/c mice (obtained from Charles River, Sulzfeld, Germany) were killed, and their tissues were quickly dissected; heparinized whole blood was also obtained. The tissues from three animals each were pooled. Tissues were flushed with ice-cold PBS, weighed, and then homogenized in Potter-Elvejhem homogenizers in 3 volumes of ice-cold tissue lysis buffer (50 mm potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, and complete™ protease inhibitors). Samples were centrifuged at 100,000 × g at 4 °C for 60 min. Supernatants were harvested, and the pellet was resuspended in an equal volume of tissue lysis buffer. Samples were subjected to the routine SPHK assay as described above for HEK293 cell lysates, using either buffer 1 or 2. Incubation time was 30 min, which was found to be in the quasi-linear phase of the assay. Activity is reported as mU/g (nmol of phosphorylated product formation per min per g of tissue).Assay of Endogenous SPHKs Activity in HUVEC—The activity of SPHK1 and 2 in HUVEC lysates was measured as described for the HEK293 cells, but incubation time was extended to 2 h.Assay of SPHK Activity in Whole Blood—Heparinized blood was obtained from human donors, Balb/c mice, and Wistar rats (Charles River). The blood was diluted with 3 volumes of SPHK cell lysis buffer; following freeze/thawing and centrifugation supernatants were tested in the routine SPHK assay as described above, with sphingosine as the substrate and using either buffer 1 or 2. Alternatively, the phosphorylation of FTY720 was studied using intact blood cells: heparinized blood was diluted with 3 volumes of RPMI medium containing 10% FCS and incubated with [3H]FTY720 (0.2 μCi, 60 nm) at 37 °C for up to 18 h. Following incubation, samples were extracted with equal volumes of 1-butyl alcohol; the butyl alcohol phase was back-washed with an equal volume of water and evaporated in vacuo to dryness. Residues were taken up in 25 μl of butyl alcohol and subjected to TLC analysis as described for the routine SPHK assay. Radiolabeled products were visualized by autoradiography and quantified by scraping bands into scintillation mixture followed by counting. The percentage of conversion to the phosphate was calculated from the sum of radioactivity associated with the FTY720 and FTY720 phosphate spots.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONKinetic Characterization of Sphingosine Kinases 1 and 2— We transiently expressed the human sphingosine kinases (huSPHK) type 1 and 2 in HEK293 cells.

Limited bio-availability of copper, zinc and iron in soil decreases both the agronomic productivity and the nutrient quality of crops. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying metal homeostasis in plants is a prerequisite to optimizing plant yield and metal nutrient content. To absorb and maintain a balance of potentially toxic metal ions, plants utilize poorly understood mechanisms involving a large number of membrane transporters and metalbinding proteins with overlapping substrate specificities and complex regulation. To better understand the function and the integrated regulation, we analyzed in Arabidopsis the expression patterns in roots and in leaves of 53 genes coding for known or potential metal transporters, in response to copper, zinc, and iron deficiencies in Arabidopsis. Comparative analysis of gene expression profiles revealed specific transcriptional regulation by metals of the genes contrasting with the known wide substrate specificities of the encoded transporters. Our analysis suggested novel transport roles for several gene products and we used functional complementation of yeast mutants to correlate specific regulation by metals with transport activity. We demonstrate that two ZIP genes, ZIP2 and ZIP4, are involved in copper transport. We also present evidence that AtOPT3, a member of the oligopeptide transporter gene family with significant similarities to the maize iron-phytosiderophore transporter YS1, is regulated by metals and heterologous expression AtOPT3 can rescue yeast mutants deficient in metal transport.

All organisms require metal prosthetic groups for their unique catalytic and structural properties. In proteins, copper and iron catalyze reduction-oxidation reactions, while zinc plays an essential structural or enzymatic role. Yet most metal ions are very reactive and can be toxic to cells when present in excess. Thus, it is important for organisms to maintain adequate levels of metals in tight homeostasis using complex and often evolutionarily conserved mechanisms for the uptake and transport of low solubility metals and storage of metal ions in a non-toxic form. Despite rapid progress in recent years of our understanding of metal homeostasis in yeast, (1De Freitas J.M. Wintz H. Kim J.H. Poynton H. Fox T. Vulpe C. Biometals. 2003; 16: 185-197Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar) our knowledge of metal metabolism in plants is still rudimentary (2Clemens S. Palmgren G. Kramer U.

AtCCH, a homologue to the copper chaperone Atx1p of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, plays a role in intracellular copper transport (19Mira H. Vilar M. Perez-Paya E. Penarrubia L. Biochem.

Physiol. 2001; 158: 1317-1323Crossref Scopus (301) Google Scholar), while the function of 29 additional proteins containing an Atx1p-like heavy metal binding site (HMA) is unknown (21Dykema P.E.

Trans. 2002; 30: 235-238Google Scholar). Furthermore, four genes encoding ferritin subunits have been identified (23Petit J.-M. Briat J.-F. Lobreaux S. Biochem. J. 2001; 359: 575-582Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar), which form iron storage complexes within chloroplasts. The individual analysis of components of copper, zinc, and iron metabolism has provided important but limited insight into metal homeostasis in plants (for recent reviews, see Refs. 3Maser P. Thomine S. Schroeder J.I. Ward J.M. Hirschi K. Sze H. Talke I.N. Amtmann A. Maathuis F.J.M. Sanders D. Harper J.F. Tchieu J. Gribskov M. Persans M.W. Salt D.E. Kim S.A. Guerinot M.L.

First, there are large numbers of genes encoding proteins known or likely to play a role in metal transport. Second, the plant transporters that have been studied in heterologous systems exhibit low selectivity in the metal species transported. nicotianamine metallothionein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetate inductively coupled plasma average difference intensity reverse transcription superoxide dismutase phytochelatin phytosiderophore. nicotianamine metallothionein 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetate inductively coupled plasma average difference intensity reverse transcription superoxide dismutase phytochelatin phytosiderophore. Functional studies using yeast complementation have revealed wide substrate specificities but failed to identify the specific in planta function for most of the transporters. The transcriptional patterns in response to metal deficiencies could yield useful information bearing on the function of the genes. We have therefore undertaken a large-scale analysis of gene expression profiles in Arabidopsis plants subjected to nutritional deficiencies in three essential metals using Affymetrix DNA microarrays containing 8,300 Arabidopsis genes. The response of plants to mineral deficiencies likely involves a complex regulatory cascade ultimately resulting in changes in expression of key transporters and metal homeostasis proteins as well as by inducing changes in their growth patterns. In this report, we focus on the changes in expression of genes coding for transporters and metal homeostasis proteins that are present on the 8.3K Arabidopsis DNA chip and were shown previously or in this study to be regulated in response to copper, zinc, and iron deficiency. The very specific transcriptional regulation observed, in contrast to the wide substrate specificity of many metal transporters, suggests primarily transcriptional regulatory control of metal homeostasis in plants. In addition, our expression analysis and confirmatory functional complementation studies revealed previously unsuspected roles for several trans-membrane transporters in metal homeostasis. Plant Growth—Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia were aseptically grown on hydroponics at 20 °C under a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Control plants were grown on a modified Gamborg's B-5 medium containing full-strength Gamborg's B-5 salts, 1 × Gamborg's vitamins, and 2 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.50. All chemical were purchased from Sigma. To induce copper deficiency, plants were first germinated on the same medium lacking copper. These plants remain healthy due to trace copper contamination, since the free copper activity must be kept below ∼1 × 10–14m to induce copper deficiency. After 5 weeks of growth, the nutrient solution was replaced by a chelate-buffered medium (25Parker D.R. Chaney R.L. Norvell W.A. Loeppert R.H. Schwab A.P. Goldberg S. Chemical Equilibrium and Reaction Models. Soil Society of America, Madison, WI1995: 163-200Google Scholar) to induce copper deficiency, in which HEDTA (hydroxyethylethylenediaminetriacetate) was added to copper-free medium at a level 25 μm in excess of the sum of the divalent metal concentrations (iron, zinc, manganese, and nickel). The speciation program Geochem-PC was employed to calculate free metal activities to design a hydroponics solution that was specific for copper deficiency while ensuring sufficiency in other metals. Zinc was accordingly increased to 0.7 mm to keep its activity above ∼1 × 10–11m. The copper-deficient chelate buffer thus consisted of Gamborg's B-5 salts lacking copper, 0.7 mm ZnSO4, 0.88 mm HEDTA, 2 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.50, and Gamborg's vitamins. Plants were grown for 5 days on HEDTA-buffered copper-deficient medium before the roots and the leaves were harvested for RNA extraction. A similar approach was used to induce zinc deficiency as in Grotz et al. (26Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar), except we employed an HEDTA buffer instead of an EDTA buffer. Plants were germinated and grown on control growth medium (containing zinc). After 5 weeks, the medium was replaced by a HEDTA-buffered zinc-deficient medium (calculated using Geochem-PC to ensure copper sufficiency). The zinc-deficient chelate buffer consisted of Gamborg's B-5 salts without zinc, 10 μm CuSO4 (to keep copper activities above ∼1 × 10–14m), 0.2 mm HEDTA, 2 mm MES-KOH, pH 5.50, and Gamborg's vitamins. Plants were grown for 5 days on the HEDTA-buffered zinc-deficient medium before the roots and leaves were harvested for RNA extraction. For iron deficiency, plants were germinated and grown for 5 weeks on control growth medium, after which the medium was replaced by control medium lacking FeSO4/EDTA but containing 50 μm ferrozine to capture trace iron contamination. Roots and leaves were harvested after 5 days of growth in the ferrozine-containing medium. Tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80° C until the RNA was extracted. The biological replicates consisted of plants that were grown independently for RNA extraction. For ICP analysis plants were washed twice in 50 mm EDTA and twice in deionized water, dried, and digested in 50% metal grade nitric acid using a microwave digestor. Dataset Collection, Data Processing, and Data Analysis—Arabidopsis GeneChips (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) containing 8,300 genes (27Zhu T. Budworth P. Han B. Brown D. Chang H.S. Zou G. Wang X. Plant Physiol. Biochem. 2001; 39: 221-242Crossref Scopus (97) Google Scholar) were employed. RNA extractions, cDNA synthesis, array hybridization, and overall intensity normalization were performed as described previously (28Chen W. Provart N. Glazebrook J. Katagiri F. Chang H. Eulgem T. Mauch F. Luan S. Zou G. Whitham S. Budworth P. Tao Y. Xie Z. Chen X. Lam S. Kreps J. Harper J. Si-Ammour A. Mauch-Mani B. Heinlein M. Kobayashi K. Hohn T. Dangl J. Wang X. Zhu T. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 559-574Crossref PubMed Scopus (796) Google Scholar). All GeneChip hybridization were performed in duplicate (technical replicates) to extract an average difference intensity (ADI) value for all of the genes tested. To process the data, any ADI that was less than 5 was brought up to 5. False positives were identified as those genes which averaged technical replicate ADIs were greater than 25 and which exhibited 2-fold difference between the two biological replicates. The false positive genes were excluded from further analysis. A two-sample t test was then performed (separately for leaves or for roots) to obtain genes which ADI statistically differed between the treatments and their corresponding controls (p < 0.15). Since the metal deficiency experiments were done twice at different times, only those genes that were present in both lists of t tests were kept for further data processing. Finally, fold changes were calculated by dividing the average ADI values of the replicated samples from each nutritional deficiency treatment by the average ADI values from their corresponding replicated controls. Only those genes with fold changes greater than 2 or less than 0.5 in both experimental replicates were considered. The ADI was used as a measure of the expression levels of genes in Figs. 4 and 5. Actin (At2g37620), β-tubulin (At5g09810), and actin7 (At5g09810) represented controls for low, medium, and highly expressed genes, respectively. Complete data sets are available by request from corresponding author.Fig. 5Expression levels of genes involved in metal binding and chelation. ADIs were used to assess and compare expression levels of genes involved in metal binding and chelation. ADI for genes encoding ferritin (AtFer1 and AtFer4), nicotianamine synthase (NAS1–3), phytochelatin synthase (PCS-1), and metallothioneins (Mt2a, MT2, MT3) from control plants, and plants grown under copper, zinc, or iron deficiencies were plotted. R and L denote roots and leaves, respectively. Actin is used as a control. ADI of individual replicates (shown in Table S1) were averaged, and error bars represent S.D. The scale of the y axis is different in the two graphs.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) RNA Blots and Reverse Transcription (RT)-PCR—For Northern blots 10 μg of RNA were run in a 1.2% agarose-formaldehyde gel and transferred onto nylon membrane (Amersham Biosciences). Hybridization to (29)dCTP-labeled DNA probes was carried out at 42 °C in 50% formamide, 6 × SSC, 0.1%SDS, 2 × Denharts solution. For RT, 5 μg of RNA were reverse-transcribed using Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using Taq DNA polymerase as directed by the supplier (Takara Shuzo Co., Shiga, Japan). Between 20 and 27 cycles (30 s at 94 °C,60sat50 °C, and 60 s at 72 °C) were performed in a 50-μl volume. 5 μl of the reaction were analyzed on a 1% agarose + ethidium bromide gel that was photographed using a digital imager (ChemilImager 4400, Alpha Innotech Corp., San Leandro, CA) and analyzed using image analysis software (AlphaEase™, Alpha Innotech Corp.). Amplified β-tubulin gene was used to normalize the data. Oligonucleotides were designed to amplify 500–600 bp of the 5′ end of the genes (ZIP-2F, TAGCAGCCGCTGGATATTGC; ZIP-2R, GAGATGGTTAACCGCAACGTACA; ZIP4-F, GCTGCTGGTAGTGAAGAGAT; ZIP4-R, ATCAGCTGCGATGAGGTCCA; ZIP5-F, GAGTTTCCGTTCACAGGCTT; ZIP5-R, GACATATAGATGAGGATGCC; ZIP6-F, GATTTAACGGCGAGTGAACA; ZIP6-R, TTGAGGCGAGAACCCGATTC; ZIP9-F, TCTGAGAGATCAAGAAGATGG; ZIP9-R, CACTCATCTTCTTGCTCAAG; OPT3-F, ACCAGGATATGATATAATAGGGCAG; OPT3-R, CACCATTTGAGGTCGTGTCC; B-TUBULIN-F, GTTGGGTTGCACCACTCAC; B-TUBULIN-R, ACCCTTCTTCCTCATCAGCC. Yeast Work—The S. cerevisiae KO strains used in this study are derived from BY4741 and were obtained from Research Genetics (www.resgen.com). The fet3fet4 mutant was in the DEY1453 background (5Eide D. Broderus M. Fett J. Guerinot M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 5624-5628Crossref PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar). For yeast functional complementation studies, cDNAs were amplified using ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.), cloned into the yeast vector pFL61, sequence-verified, and transformed into yeast mutants using standard procedures. Yeast growth media were purchased from Qbiogen (Carlsbad, CA). Nicotianamine was purchased from Hasegawa Co. (Tokyo, Japan). Yeast mutants were grown in SD medium lacking divalent ions supplemented with the appropriate amino acids and metal salts containing either glucose (2%) or glycerol (2%). Manganese and iron-limited medium were obtained by omitting manganese and iron salts from the synthetic defined medium. Growth curves were performed in 96-well plates (150-μl culture volume) using a SpectraMax®190 plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). OD600 was measured every 20 min over 48 h. For elemental analysis of yeast, cells were grown to exponential log phase in SD medium containing 2% glucose. 50 ml of cells at OD600 = 1 were centrifuged and washed twice in 20 mm EDTA followed by two washings in deionized water. The cell pellet was dried and digested in 500 μl of 100% HNO3 at 70 °C for 18 h. Copper content was analyzed by ICP-atomic emission spectrometry at 224 nm. Regulation of ZIP Genes by Copper, Zinc, and Iron—Six members of the 15-member ZIP family of genes coding for zinc/iron permeases are present on the DNA microarrays used in this work (Table I). The gene coding for IRT1, the major iron uptake transporter in Arabidopsis, is not present in the chips and thus not included in this analysis. Our results showed that ZIP genes can be regulated by zinc (ZIP4, ZIP5, ZIP9), iron (IRT2), and copper (ZIP2 and ZIP4) both in the roots and in the leaves (Table IIA and Figs. 1 and 2).Table IGenes analyzed in this work Open table in a new tab Table IIFold change in gene expression in response to nutritional deficiencies in copper, zinc and iron Open table in a new tab Fig. 2RT-PCR analysis of ZIP gene expression. RT-PCR was used to analyze roots transcript levels for ZIP2, ZIP4, ZIP5, ZIP6, ZIP9, and IRT2 in control (Ctl), copper (-Cu), zinc (-Zn), and iron (-Fe) deficiency and 100× copper (+Cu) and zinc (+Zn) excess. The graph represents the relative levels of expression as assessed by the fluorescence intensity of the fragments specific to each gene in the linear range of amplification. Data was normalized to the fluorescence intensity of β-tubulin (βTUB).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) A Role for ZIP2 and ZIP4 in Copper Transport—Microarray and RT-PCR results indicated that ZIP2 and ZIP4 are induced in copper deficiency and repressed in copper excess (Table IIA and Fig. 2). However, they were not responsive to the same levels of copper deficiency; we observed a sharp increase in expression of ZIP4 only in plants subjected to 3 weeks of growth on a copper-deficient HEDTA buffered medium (Fig. 2) but not after the 5-day treatment used in the microarray experiments. Copper deficiency was confirmed by measuring of copper content in whole plants using ICP-EAS. Copper levels in deficient plants were 2.5 μg/g of dry weight compared with 7 μg/g of dry weight in control plants. The response of ZIP5 to copper deficiency observed in the microarray experiment could not be confirmed by RT-PCR, suggesting that the induction we observed in our microarray analysis may not be significant. These results imply that ZIP2 and ZIP4 are involved in copper transport. To confirm this, we have cloned ZIP2 and ZIP4 cDNAs in the yeast expression vector pFL61 (30Minet M. Dufour M.E. Lacroute F. Plant J. 1992; 2: 417-422PubMed Google Scholar) and expressed it in yeast lacking high affinity copper uptake (Δctr1). Both ZIP2 and ZIP4 can restore growth of Δctr1 on a non-fermentable medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glycerol (YPG)), indicating that both genes can function as copper transporter in yeast (Fig. 3A). Measurement of copper content of ZIP2 expressing Δctr1 cells harvested in log phase of growth on fermentable SD medium (Fig. 3B) indicate that ZIP2-expressing cells have a higher content of copper compared with the Δctr1 mutant transformed with the vector alone (Fig. 3B). Our results and previous work (26Grotz N. Fox T. Connolly E. Park W. Guerinot M.L. Eide D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1998; 95: 7220-7224Crossref PubMed Scopus (548) Google Scholar) suggest and are consistent with a role for ZIP2 in root copper and zinc homeostasis and a role for ZIP4 in copper and zinc transport in roots and in shoots. Most Transporters Regulated by Copper Are Also Regulated by Other Metals—Although we found copper deficiency-regulated transporters, we did not identify metal transporters specifically induced by copper deficiency in the 8,300 genes tested. In addition to ZIP2, ZIP4, and possibly ZIP5, two other potential copper transporter genes also appeared to be regulated by zinc, namely COPT2, a homologue of a yeast copper transporter (31Kampfenkel K.

Both COPT2 and the Zn/Cd p-ATPase3 showed up-regulation in zinc deficiency. COPT1, a known copper transporter (31Kampfenkel K. Kushnir S. Babiychuk E. Inze D. Van Montagu M. J. Biol.

CHX17, coding for a potential Na+/H+ exchange protein, is the only transporter gene that appears to be specifically regulated by copper (Table IIB, Fig. 1). Six other members of the cation/proton antiporter family present on the array (CHX13, CHX15, CHX21, KEA3, NHX1, and NHX17) do not appear to be regulated in response to any of the metal deficiencies tested. Our analysis indicates that RAN1, a known copper-transporting P-ATPase that plays a role in copper assembly into the ethylene receptor ETR1 (12Woeste K.E. Kieber J.J.

Coordinated Transcriptional Regulation of Copper-binding Proteins—AtCCS, a homologue to the yeast copper chaperone CCS, and both cytosolic and chloroplast Cu,Zn-SODs transcript levels fall in copper and in zinc deficiency (Table IIC, Fig. 4). Two other SOD coding genes, the iron-SOD3 gene (accession number AAC24834) and a SOD-like gene (accession number AAC2483), do not respond to metal deficiencies (Fig. 4). Three genes coding for AtCCS-related metal-binding proteins (21Dykema P.E. Sipes P.R. Marie A. Biermann B.J. Crowell D.N. Randall S.K. Plant Mol. Biol. 1999; 41: 139-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 22Wintz H. Vulpe C. Biochem. Soc. Trans. 2002; 30: 235-238Google Scholar) are expressed only at very low levels and do not appear to be regulated by any of the metal deficiencies tested (see Supplementary Table S1). In contrast, steady-state RNA levels of MT2a, MT2b, and MT3 in normal growth conditions are very high and remained unchanged in all deficiencies, except for a slight decrease in expression of MT2a in copper deficiency (Fig. 5). Finally AtCutA, a homologue to a bacterial copper-binding protein (32Fong S.T. Camakaris J. Lee B.T.O. Mol. Microbiol. 1995; 15: 1127-1137Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar), is not regulated by copper and does not show tissue specific expression (Table S1). Inter-relationship of Zinc and Iron Transport—Zinc and Iron deficiency led to specific changes in ZIP gene expression. Transcription profiles showed that ZIP5 and ZIP9 are expressed at very low levels in normal growth conditions, suggesting that they play a specific role in root and shoot zinc transport in response to zinc deficiency. Only IRT2 of the ZIP family, which was previously shown to be involved in iron uptake (9Vert G. Briat J.-F. Curie C. Plant J. 2001; 26: 181-189Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), was specifically increased in iron deficient roots. It is not induced in iron-deficient shoots or in zinc and copper deficiency. None of the ZIP genes studied appears to be co-regulated by zinc and iron. However, iron deficiency led to down-regulation of zinc-regulated ZIP4 and ZIP5 (Table IIA and Fig. 2). This down-regulation could reflect an increase in cellular zinc levels probably via IRT1, an iron-regulated transporter that is known to also transport zinc (8Vert G. Grotz N. Dédaldéchamp F. Gaymard F. Guerinot M.L. Briat J.F. Curie C. Plant Cell. 2002; 14: 1223-1233Crossref PubMed Scopus (1146) Google Scholar). Similarly, we have observed a sharp increase in expression of iron-regulated IRT2 in zinc excess (Fig. 2), indicating that plants exposed to excess zinc become iron-deficient, probably because zinc and iron are competing for the same transporters. The expression of ZIP6 was not affected by any of the metal deficiencies and excess tested (Figs. 1 and 2), suggesting either that this permease is constitutively expressed or is regulated by other metals.

Taking advantage of DNA microarray technology, we tried to identify the molecules explaining the relationship between obesity and vascular disorders, comparing mRNA expression of about 12,000 genes in white adipose tissue between normal, high fat diet-induced obesity (DIO) and d-Trp34 neuropeptide Y-induced obesity in mice. Expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) mRNA displayed a 7.2-fold increase in obese mice as compared with normal mice, leading to substantially elevated MCP-1 protein levels in adipocytes. MCP-1 levels in plasma were also increased in DIO mice, and a strong correlation between plasma MCP-1 levels and body weight was identified. We also showed that elevated MCP-1 protein levels in plasma increased the CD11b-positive monocyte/macrophage population in DIO mice. Furthermore, infusion of MCP-1 into lean mice increased the CD11b-positive monocyte population without inducing changes in body weight. Given the importance of MCP-1 in activation of monocytes and subsequent atherosclerotic development, these results suggest a novel role of adiposity in the development of vascular disorders.

Obesity is now considered epidemic throughout the western world and represents a major risk factor for a variety of life-threatening diseases, such as heart attack, stroke, diabetes, and cancer (1Zimmet P.

According to current estimates, about 30% of adults in the United States are classified as obese, roughly double the number from 20 years ago. Obesity increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes 10-fold, cardiovascular diseases 2-fold, and colon cancer 1.6-fold. Although recent progress in understanding the molecular basis of obesity may well open new opportunities to combat this epidemic, the molecular mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and obesity-related comorbidities remain unclear and are currently the focus of intense investigation. Hypercholesterolemia has been considered to represent the critical factor in the development of atherosclerosis. However, a growing body of evidence suggests the importance of inflammatory processes in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases. Inflammatory processes are orchestrated by the recruitment of mononuclear leukocytes and the migration, growth, and activation of cells within atherosclerotic lesions (5Gerrity R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 181-190PubMed Google Scholar, 6Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Crossref PubMed Scopus (10004) Google Scholar). Attraction of circulating leukocytes to target sites is controlled by various chemokines, the presence of which is well documented in atherosclerotic lesions (7Rollins B.J.

After attachment to the vessel wall, monocytes migrate into the subendothelial space, differentiating into macrophages and lipid-laden foam cells (5Gerrity R.G. Am. J. Pathol. 1981; 103: 181-190PubMed Google Scholar). These steps are likewise controlled by chemotactic cytokines; in particular, expression of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) 1The abbreviations used are: MCP-1monocyte chemoattractant protein-1DIOdiet-induced obesityWATwhite adipose tissueEWATepididymal WATPBSphosphate-buffered salineNPYneuropeptide YELISAenzyme-linked immunosorbent assayCCRC-C chemokine receptor. is enhanced in macrophages, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscles cells in the atheromatous plaque (9Yla-Herttuala S.

MCP-1 is the member of the C-C chemokine β subfamily and is predominantly expressed in endothelial cells (10Strieter R.M. Wiggins R. Phan S.H. Wharram B.L. Showell H.J. Remick D.G. Chensue S.W.

In hypercholesterolemic mice, genetic disruption of MCP-1 or its receptor, CCR2, results in markedly decreased occurrence of atheroma and the presence of fewer monocytes in vascular lesions (12Boring L.

The biological significance of these molecules is largely unknown, but the inflammation compartment of vascular injury or regulation of insulin resistance may be affected. Proteins that are reportedly secreted and functional in atherosclerosis include IL-6 (17Yudkin J.S. Kumari M. Humphries S.E. Mohamed-Ali V.

The present study identified the molecular factors explaining the relationship between obesity and atherosclerosis, with a focus on adipose tissue. The mRNA expression of epididymal white adipose tissue (EWAT) was compared among obese mice, revealing that expression of MCP-1 mRNA is increased in obese mice, leading to elevated levels of plasma MCP-1 protein. Furthermore, the higher levels of MCP-1 protein in plasma were found to increase the CD11b-positive monoycte/macrophage population among peripheral blood cells, suggesting a role for elevated MCP-1 in the vascular inflammatory process during atherosclerosis. Animals—C57BL/6N mice (6 weeks old, CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan) were housed in individual cages. Mice were maintained under conditions of controlled temperature (23 ± 2 °C) and light (07:00–19:00). Water and food (CA-1, CLEA Japan) were available ad libitum unless otherwise noted. For microarray analysis, 18-week-old mice were changed to an MHF diet (Oriental Bioservice, Kyoto, Japan) for 6 months to establish diet-induced obesity (DIO). The MHF diet provides 52.4% energy as carbohydrate, 15% as protein, and 32.6% as fat (4.41 kcal/g). For measurements of MCP-1 levels in plasma, normal diet was changed to the MHF diet when the mice were 9 weeks old. In food restriction experiments, body-weight changes in DIO mice were monitored after caloric intake was limited for 21 h and after food intake was restricted to a short, 3-h period for 7 days. All animal procedures complied with National Institutes of Health guidelines and were approved by the Banyu Animal Care and Usage Committee. Surgical Procedure—d-Trp34 neuropeptide Y (d-Trp34NPY, a Y5 agonist) was synthesized at Banyu Tsukuba Research Institute. Mice were anesthetized using sodium pentobarbital (80 mg/kg, intraperitoneal, Dainabot, Tokyo, Japan), and a sterile brain infusion cannula (28 gauge, Alzet, Palo Alto, CA) was stereotaxically implanted into the right lateral ventricle. The stereotaxic coordinates used were 0.4 mm posterior to the bregma, 0.8 mm lateral to the midline, and 2.0 mm from the surface of the skull, using a flat skull position. Cannulae were fixed to the skull using dental cement. The infusion cannula was connected to an osmotic minipump (model no. 2002, Alzet) filled with 10 mm phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.05% bovine serum albumin via polyvinylchloride tubing. Pumps were implanted subdermally on the backs of mice, and antibiotic (Cefamedine A, 50 mg/kg, Fujisawa, Tokyo, Japan) was injected subcutaneously. Mice were divided into three groups, matched for average body weight: vehicle (PBS)-infused; d-Trp34NPY-infused and fed ad libitum (ad libitum-fed group); and d-Trp34NPY infused and pair-fed (pair-fed group). After 7–14 days of recovery following surgery, pumps were replaced with d-Trp34NPY-(5 μg/day) or vehicle-containing pumps. The d-Trp34NPY-pair-fed group was provided with the same amount of food as the vehicle group. Pair feeding was performed as described previously (24Mashiko S. Ishihara A. Iwaasa H. Sano H. Oda Z. Ito J. Yumoto M. Okawa M. Suzuki J. Fukuroda T. Jitsuoka M. Morin N.R. Macneil D.J. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ihara M. Fukami T. Kanatani A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Microarray Analysis—In respective model mice, total RNA was extracted from EWAT using Trizol reagents (Invitrogen) and repurified with an RNeasy purification kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). To determine expression changes between models, 10 μg of RNA was utilized for microarray analysis (MG-U74U74A chip, Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) of ∼12,000 genes. For analysis of microarray data, GeneChip software (Affymetrix) was utilized. Appropriate control mice were used to provide baseline values for the experimental groups, and genes displaying values of p < 0.05 were identified using the Mann-Whitney test. Measurement of MCP-1 Expression by Quantitative PCR—Total RNA was extracted from EWAT as described in the previous section. Reverse transcription was performed for 500 ng of total RNA, and obtained cDNA was applied to TaqMan PCR for quantification of MCP-1 mRNA expression. Data were collected and analyzed using an ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detector system (Applied Biosystems, Warrington, UK). MCP-1 expression data were normalized to β-actin expression levels in each sample. Primers and TaqMan probes used were as follows: TaqMan probe for MCP-1, 5′-CCA CTC ACC TGC TGC TAC TCA TTC ACC A-3′; PCR forward primer for MCP-1, 5′-TCA GCC AGA TGC AGT TAA CGC-3′; PCR reverse primer for MCP-1, 5′-TGA TCC TCT TGT AGC TCT CCA GC-3′; TaqMan probe for β-actin, 5′-CCT GAG GCT CTT TTC CAG CCT TCC TTC T-3′; PCR forward primer for β-actin, 5′-TAT TGG CAA CGA GCG GTT C-3′; PCR reverse primer for β-actin, 5′-ATG CCA CAG GAT TCC ATA CCC-3′. Laser Microdissection—Ovarian white adipose tissues were excised, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek USA, Torrance, CA), frozen in cold hexan, and stored at –80 °C. Frozen sections were cut at 10-μm thickness and mounted on foil-covered microscope slides (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Sections were subsequently fixed in ethanol/acetic acid (19:1) for 1 min, stained using 0.05% toluidine blue solution (WAKO, Osaka, Japan) for 50 s, and air-dried for 30 min. Laser microdissection was performed using an AS LMD laser microdissection system (Leica) to collect either adipocytes or non-adipocyte cells. Total RNA was extracted from each fraction, and TaqMan PCR was performed as described above. Measurement of MCP-1—Concentrations of MCP-1 in plasma and EWAT were determined using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). EWAT was removed and homogenized in 2 volumes of ice-cold PBS with protease inhibitor mixture tablets (Roche Diagnostics). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was then used for MCP-1 ELISA. Analysis of CD11b Expression Using Flow Cytometry—MCP-1 (R&D Systems) was infused subcutaneously for 2 weeks using an osmotic pump (Alzet) at a dose of 10 ng/0.5 μl/h. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the monocyte/macrophage population among whole blood cells. Whole blood samples from control, DIO, and MCP-1-treated mice were collected from the tail vein using heparinized capillaries. Blood cells were centrifuged at 300 × g for 5 min and incubated using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled anti-mouse CD11b (BD Biosciences) at room temperature for 15 min. To control non-specific binding, samples were incubated using rat IgG2b isotype. After washing stained cells with PBS, red blood cells were lysed using a lysing buffer for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were then washed with PBS and suspended in PBS containing 0.5% formaldehyde. Flow cytometry was performed using an EPICS Elite flow cytometer (Beckman Coulter) to identify the monocyte population, which was determined using fluorescence and scatter light characteristics. In all samples, 40,000 white blood cells were counted and analyzed. Evaluation of Data and Statistical Analysis—All data were expressed as mean ± S.E. Statistics were performed using a two-tailed unpaired Student's t test (StatView, SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Gene Expression Profiles of Adipocyte in Obesity Models— Two models of mice obesity were employed to examine expression changes in EWAT. These comprised the high fat DIO model and the d-Trp34NPY-induced obesity model (ad libitum- and pair-fed groups). In the DIO model, mice were fed high fat chow (32.6% energy as fat, 52.4% as carbohydrate, and 15.0% as protein) for 6 months. Body weights of DIO mice had stabilized by 6 months, at 44.7 ± 2.6 g (mice fed regular chow, 31.1 ± 1.1 g). The other model utilized d-Trp34NPY-induced obesity. d-Trp34NPY is known to represent an appetite stimulant acting on the NPY Y5 receptor. Administration of this neuropeptide is known to increase food intake and body weight, with changes in body weight accompanied by increased fat weight (24Mashiko S. Ishihara A. Iwaasa H. Sano H. Oda Z. Ito J. Yumoto M. Okawa M. Suzuki J. Fukuroda T. Jitsuoka M. Morin N.R. Macneil D.J. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ihara M. Fukami T. Kanatani A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Treatment with d-Trp34NPY not only increases food intake but also decreases energy expenditure (24Mashiko S. Ishihara A. Iwaasa H. Sano H. Oda Z. Ito J. Yumoto M. Okawa M. Suzuki J. Fukuroda T. Jitsuoka M. Morin N.R. Macneil D.J. Van der Ploeg L.H.T. Ihara M. Fukami T. Kanatani A. Endocrinology. 2003; 144: 1793-1801Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar), so that d-Trp34NPY-treated mice pair-fed with a PBS-treated control group also displayed increased adiposity. EWAT was excised, and total RNA was extracted, labeled, and hybridized to a DNA microarray. GeneChip Murine U74A arrays (Affymetrix) were used for DNA microarrays, and data were analyzed using GeneChip software comparison (Table I). Expressions of seven genes were increased in both DIO and d-Trp34NPY-treated mice (ad libitum- and pair-fed group) comparisons, whereas expressions of nine genes were decreased. Some affected genes are known to display associations with increased adiposity, including: leptin; fatty acid-binding protein 5; and low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2. In addition, significant changes were observed in genes displaying roles in immune processes, such as: compliment component 1q; compliment component 2; and MCP-1. Both leptin and MCP-1 comprise secreted proteins with trans-acting signal transduction capabilities.Table ICommon signature genes with EWAT in DIO and d-Trp34NPY-treated miceProbe IDAccessionSymbolNameFold changeDIOD-Trp34NPY-FFD-Trp34NPY-PFUp 100436_atM27008Orm1Orosomucoid 11.63.92.4 102736_atM19681MCP-1Monocyte chemoattractant protein-17.26.34.9 99623_s_atD78265Olfm 1Olfactomedin 11.73.42.0 160544_atAJ223066Fabp5Fatty acid-binding protein 5, epidermal2.89.03.7 101753_s_atX51547Lzp-sP lysozyme structural2.22.42.0 96020_atM22531C1qbComplement component 1, q subcomponent, β-polypeptide2.81.81.7 98443_atAI882416LepLeptin2.33.11.8Down 94223_atAJ010045Net1Neuroepithelial cell transforming gene 1-3.9-4.6-2.6 102207_atAW123249MGC12117Hypothetical protein MGC12117-2.3-5.0-1.6 103673_atM57891C2Complement component 2 (within H-2S)-3.1-5.9-2.4 96146_atD83745Btg3B-cell translocation gene 3-1.8-2.4-2.5 160085_atU35741TstThiosulfate sulfurtransferase, mitochondrial-3.7-2.0-1.9 103377_atAW259788Lrp2Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2-2.9-2.9-1.8 100629_atU24428Gstm5Glutathione S-transferase, μ 5-3.3-2.1-1.5 101676_atU13705Gpx3Glutathione peroxidase 3-2.5-2.9-1.8 100068_atM74570Aldh1a1Aldehyde dehydrogenase family 1, subfamily A1-2.0-2.2-1.6 Open table in a new tab MCP-1 mRNA and Plasma Protein Levels—Changes in the expression of MCP-1 in EWAT were confirmed using quantitative TaqMan PCR methods in all obese mouse models. Results from DNA microarrays and quantitative TaqMan PCR coordinated well (Fig. 1A). White adipose tissues comprise various cell types, including adipocytes, vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages (25Wasserman F. Renold A.E. Cahill G.F. Handbook of Physiology. American Physiology Society, Washington, D. C.1965: 87-100Google Scholar). With the exception of mast cells, all other cell types reportedly display MCP-1 expression, so laser microdissection was used to confirm adipocyte-selective MCP-1 induction in high fat DIO mice. Each histological section of adipose tissues was stained, adipocytes and non-adipocyte cells were collected separately using laser microdissection, and TaqMan PCR was performed. Induction of adipocyte-selective MCP-1 mRNA (5.3-fold induction as compared with control lean mice) was observed in obese mice (Fig. 1B). Next, we assessed whether increased levels of MCP-1 mRNA translated to increased levels of MCP-1 protein in EWAT. Adipose tissue from DIO mice was excised, homogenized, and centrifuged, yielding supernatants used for ELISA measurement of MCP-1 protein (Fig. 1C). An ∼5-fold increase in tissue levels of MCP-1 protein was observed in DIO mice as compared with regular diet-fed control C57/BL6 mice, in good agreement with the observed mRNA changes. Calculated to a per WAT base, the change was more significant, at 17.6-fold (DIO, 655.4 pg of MCP-1/WAT versus control, 37.20 pg of MCP-1/WAT). If increases in MCP-1 message/protein levels in WAT could affect functions in distant organs, plasma MCP-1 protein levels should be altered according to protein levels in WAT. Evaluation of plasma MCP-1 levels using ELISA confirmed this hypothesis (Fig. 1D). In DIO mice, plasma levels of MCP-1 were significantly increased as compared with regular diet-fed control mice. Plasma MCP-1 Levels and Body Weight—Since increased plasma MCP-1 levels were observed in DIO mice, we evaluated whether plasma MCP-1 levels correlated with body weight in DIO mice. Forty mice were fed high fat diet for various periods (1–18 weeks), and blood was collected from these mice for MCP-1 ELISA. When plasma MCP-1 levels were plotted against body weight in these mice (Fig. 2A), correlations between plasma MCP-1 levels and body weight were highly significant (r = 0.834). These results indicated that EWAT-derived MCP-1 changes circulating levels according to body weight, probably as a result of increased adiposity. To confirm a causal relationship between adiposity and plasma MCP-1 levels, the time course of DIO treatments as compared with plasma MCP-1 levels was also investigated. Mice were fed a high fat diet from the time they were 9 weeks old, and blood was collected at 2, 4, 10, and 20 weeks after initiation of treatment (Fig. 2B). As expected, plasma MCP-1 levels increased according to increased body weight, and increases were even observed in aged regular diet-fed mice, although these changes were relatively small as compared with mice fed the high fat diet. Since adiposity is known to increase with age in rodents, it is encouraging to see that MCP-1 increases in mice at the time they are 20 weeks old. The effect of fasting on plasma MCP-1 levels was also evaluated. Dietary restriction represents a simple model for decreased fat storage in rodents, and we utilized DIO mice fed with 80% of the calories needed to maintain their body weight. Within 7 days, a 25% reduction in body weight was observed, in addition to decreased plasma MCP-1 levels (Fig. 2C). These results confirmed a strong causal relationship between adiposity and plasma MCP-1 levels. Plasma MCP-1 Levels and CD11b-positive Monocyte— MCP-1 is part of the C-C chemokine β subfamily, members of which bind to several CCR receptors to transmit signals. The interaction of MCP-1 with CCR2 has been well characterized (26Boring L. Gosling J. Monteclaro F.S. Lusis A.J. Tsou C.L. Charo I.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 7551-7558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (111) Google Scholar), and genetic manipulation of the interaction is known to affect the pathological course of atherosclerosis. In this process, MCP-1 displays particular involvement in the activation and recruitment of monocytes to the atherosclerotic lesion. Changes to MCP-1 levels in the plasma of obese subjects may therefore produce functional consequences in the development of increased neointimal formations, and we decided to further characterize the significance of systemic increases in levels of MCP-1. Flow cytometric analysis was performed on mice in which plasma MCP-1 levels were raised by high fat diet treatment for 17–19 weeks (95.7 ± 7.1 pg/ml for DIO, 40.5 ± 2.4 pg/ml for regular diet). The results indicated that the CD11b (Mac 1, a member of the integrin family)-positive fraction of monocytes was increased significantly among DIO mice as compared with regular diet-fed control mice (607.4 ± 38.8/40,000 white blood cells for DIO, versus 416.4 ± 58.6/40,000 white blood cells for regular diet, Fig. 3, A–C). This result suggests that effects such as elevation of plasma MCP-1 levels induced by a high fat diet could cause these changes in cell populations. Since high fat diet treatments could have altered parameters other than MCP-1 plasma concentrations, which could in turn lead to the changes in the CD11b-positive monocyte population, we decided to test the direct effects of MCP-1 administration on CD11b-positive monocyte population. Recombinant murine MCP-1 was infused subcutaneously into C57/BL6 mice under regular diet conditions. Flow cytometric analysis was then performed after 2 weeks of treatment (Fig. 3, D–F). Under these experimental conditions, plasma MCP-1 levels increased about 2-fold as compared with saline-infused controls (209.3 ± 23.4 pg/ml for MCP-1 versus 93.5 ± 10.7 pg/ml for saline), comparable with the levels achieved with the high fat diet. Circulating CD11b-positive monocytes increased 1.7-fold, in good agreement with our study of mice on a high fat diet. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that changes in the CD11b-positive monocyte population in DIO mice are correlated with increases in plasma MCP-1 levels. Obesity is well known as a risk factor for developments of atherosclerosis (1Zimmet P. Alberti K.G. Shaw J. Nature. 2001; 414: 782-787Crossref PubMed Scopus (4594) Google Scholar, 2Ginsberg H.N. J. Clin. Invest. 2000; 106: 453-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (941) Google Scholar, 3Kopelman P.G. Nature. 2000; 404: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (3698) Google Scholar). Recent progress in our understanding of the complex pathogenesis underlying obesity has led to the term “syndrome X,” also known as metabolic cardiovascular syndrome or insulin resistance syndrome (27Hansen B.C. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1999; 892: 1-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). However, the molecular pathophysiology of syndrome X has not been elucidated in any great detail, and the genes underpinning each phenotype are under active investigation. The present study attempted to identify one such gene by focusing on secreted proteins generated from adipocytes since increased adiposity represents both the most notable change in obesity and a known risk factor for vascular disease. In addition, our interest in secreted proteins stems from the fact that such proteins have a strong potential for acting on distant tissues. DNA microarray techniques are well suited for mass analysis of gene expression, and using such expression profiling, we were able to identify two secreted proteins from the two murine models of obesity examined, namely DIO and d-Trp34NPY-treated mice. All changes observed in d-Trp34NPY-treated pair-fed models were included in the changes noted in d-Trp34NPY-treated ad libitum-fed models (data not shown). d-Trp34 NPY-treated pair-fed models were used to focus on genes whose expression changed with increased adiposity. Surprisingly, MCP-1 protein changed expression levels in obese adipocytes, as did only one other protein, leptin. Our observation is in good agreement with a recent report that MCP-1 mRNA is elevated in the adipose tissue of ob/ob obese mice (28Sartipy P. Loskutoff D.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2003; 100: 7265-7270Crossref PubMed Scopus (919) Google Scholar). Observations were further extended to protein levels in EWAT and circulating plasma. Analysis of the correlation between body weight and plasma MCP-1 levels revealed a very strong association, reaching similar levels to that displayed by the correlation between body weight and plasma leptin levels (29Ahren B. Mansson S. Gingerich R.L. Havel P.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1997; 273: R113-R120PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, plasma MCP-1 levels increased when body weight increased, and decreased when body weight decreased through fasting. These observations strongly suggest that changes in adipose weight associated with obesity/fasting are the direct cause of alterations in plasma levels of MCP-1. In an effort to confirm the functional consequences of changes to plasma MCP-1 levels in obese mice, we measured CD11b-positive monocytes in circulating blood using flow cytometric analysis. MCP-1 reportedly induces CD11b expression on monocytes and adhesion of monocytes to blood vessels (15van Royen N. Hoefer I. Bottinger M. Hua J. Grundmann S. Voskuil M. Bode C. Schaper W. Buschmann I. Piek J.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar, 30Vaddi K. Newton R.C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 4721-4732PubMed Google Scholar). CD11b antigens are expressed when premature monocytes are activated to become differentiated monocytes and represent the best molecular marker of the macrophage lineage (31Leenen P.J.M. de Bruijin M.F.T.R. Voerman J.S.A. Campbell P.A. van Ewijk W. J. Immunol. Methods. 1994; 174: 5-19Crossref PubMed Scopus (305) Google Scholar). In our analysis, circulating CD11b-positive monocytes increased in obese DIO mice as compared with regular diet-fed control mice, indicating that increased MCP-1 in obese mice affects the CD11b-positive monocyte population in obese mice. In fact, a suggestive report has been published regarding a study in humans in which the number of monocytes increased by about 10% in obese subjects (body mass index ≥30) and overweight subjects (body mass index 25–30) (32Kullo I.J. Hensrud D.D. Allison T.G. Am. J. Cardiol. 2002; 89: 1441-1443Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (65) Google Scholar). Although that study did not evaluate CD11b-positive monocytes, this change could represent the result of increased CD11b-positive monocytes. An increase in CD11b-positive monocyte was also observed following direct administration of MCP-1 in regular diet-fed mice. Since MCP-1 was directly infused into mice to the same physiological levels observed in DIO mice, the possibility that increased CD11b-positive monocytes were caused by unknown obesity-related factors other than MCP-1 can be excluded. We therefore concluded that systemic increases in MCP-1 lead to changes in the CD11b-positive monocyte population in circulating blood. However, our study did not address the sites of monocyte activation. Current models of monocyte activation posit the attachment and rolling of monocyte to the MCP-1 secreted surface. Whether any local sites display high concentrations of MCP-1 protein in obese mice and the possibility of alternative activation pathways for monocyte to macrophages would represent interesting avenues of investigation. A recent report on the effect of systemic administration of MCP-1 on atherosclerotic development also supports our hypothesis (15van Royen N. Hoefer I. Bottinger M. Hua J. Grundmann S. Voskuil M. Bode C. Schaper W. Buschmann I. Piek J.J. Circ. Res. 2003; 92: 218-225Crossref PubMed Scopus (115) Google Scholar). That study reported that MCP-1 infusion in mice causes accumulation of MOMA-2-positive monocytes in collateral arteries and increases neointimal formations. The increased macrophages in obese mice described in the present manuscript could thus lead to the stimulation of inflammatory processes in atheromatous plaque, contributing to the development of atherosclerotic lesions. From the data presented, we infer that obesity in mice increases MCP-1 mRNA expressions in EWAT and MCP-1 plasma protein levels, both of which are well correlated with changes in body weight. In addition, these changes lead to increases in the population of CD11b-positive monocytes in circulating blood. We therefore propose MCP-1 protein as one of the molecular factors connecting obesity and atherosclerosis. A test of whether differences exist in response to pharmacological manipulation of MCP-1 between obese and normal subjects in terms of atherosclerotic developments would be of interest."

In 3–4-month-old TG, heart/body weight was increased by 60% and LV ejection fraction was elevated (84 ± 2%, p < 0.01) compared with nontransgenic littermates (wild type (WT)) (73 ± 1%). An increase in isolated ventricular myocyte contractile function (% contraction) in TG compared with WT (6.1 ± 0.2 versus 3.5 ± 0.2%, p < 0.01) was associated with increased Fura-2 Ca2+ transients (396 ± 50 versus 250 ± 24 nmol/liter, p < 0.05). The rate of relaxation (+dL/dt) was also enhanced in TG (214 ± 15 versus 98 ± 18 μm/s, p < 0.01). L-type Ca2+ current (ICa) density was increased in TG compared with WT (-9.0 ± 0.3 versus 7.2 ± 0.3 pA/pF, p < 0.01). Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a) protein levels were increased (p < 0.05) by 6.6-fold in TG, which could be recapitulated in vitro by adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Akt in cultured adult ventricular myocytes. Conversely, inhibiting SERCA with either ryanodine or thapsigargin affected myocyte contraction and relaxation and Ca2+ channel kinetics more in TG than in WT. Thus, myocytes from mice with overexpressed Akt demonstrated enhanced contractility and relaxation, Fura-2 Ca2+ transients, and Ca2+ channel currents. Furthermore, increased protein expression of SERCA2a plays an important role in mediating enhanced LV function by Akt. Up-regulation of SERCA2a expression and enhanced LV myocyte contraction and relaxation in Akt-induced hypertrophy is opposite to the down-regulation of SERCA2a and reduced contractile function observed in many other forms of LV hypertrophy.

Up-regulation of SERCA2a expression and enhanced LV myocyte contraction and relaxation in Akt-induced hypertrophy is opposite to the down-regulation of SERCA2a and reduced contractile function observed in many other forms of LV hypertrophy. PKB/Akt, a 57-kDa protein, is a serine-threonine kinase and exists as three isoforms, α, β, and γ (Akt1, Akt2, and Akt3, respectively) (1Coffer P.J. Jin J. Woodgett J.R. Biochem. J. 1998; 335: 1-13Crossref PubMed Scopus (969) Google Scholar). Akt is activated by various growth stimuli including insulin, platelet-derived growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1, and agonists for the β-adrenergic receptor, as well as stresses, such as shear stress (2Shiojima I.

In this study, we examined the correlation of in vivo cardiac function with in vitro intrinsic myocyte contraction and relaxation. To determine the cellular mechanism of the enhanced cardiac function in TG, we examined L-type Ca2+ channel function and Ca2+-handling proteins, including sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca2+ ATPase 2a (SERCA2a), phospholamban (PLB), calsequestrin, the α-subunit of the L-type Ca2+ channel (α1c), and Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX), as well as myocardial ryanodine receptor binding. Our results suggest that activation of Akt enhances Ca2+ transients and facilitates both contraction and relaxation in isolated cardiac myocytes, which is associated with enhanced Ca2+ influx and increased protein levels of SERCA2a. These features indicate a novel function of Akt in the mouse heart. left ventricular transgenic mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of active Akt sarcoplasmic reticulum sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase phospholamban Na+/Ca2+ exchanger L-type Ca2+ channel kinase inactive wild type mice.

Tg-KI-Akt did not exhibit an obviously abnormal cardiac phenotype, and cardiac function was apparently normal. In this study, 3–5-month-old TG, Tg-KI-Akt, and nontransgenic littermate mice (WT) were used. Animals used in this study were maintained in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (37National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

In brief, the heart was rapidly excised and submerged in Ca2+-free Tyrode's solution containing (mmol/liter): 140 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 0.33 NaH2PO4, 10 glucose, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.4). The heart was digested using collagenase 1 and 2, 75 units/ml each (Worthington) at 32 ± 2 °C. All solutions were bubbled continuously with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 during digestion. Myocytes were field-stimulated at 1 Hz, and contraction was measured using a video motion edge detector (VED103, Crescent Electronics) as described previously (19Kim S.J. Yatani A. Vatner D.E.

The external solution contained 1 mm Ca2+. The following contractile properties were calculated from length data: % contraction and the rate of shortening (–dL/dt). Relaxation properties (+dL/dt, the rate of relengthening; tR 70%, the time for 70% relaxation) were also assessed. SR Ca2+ reuptake function was examined in response to thapsigargin (10-10, 10-9, and 10-8m) (Sigma) in both WT and TG. Cells were loaded with 5 μm Fura-2 AM (Sigma), and Ca2+ transients were measured using the Photoscan dual beam spectrofluorophotometer (Photon Technology) (19Kim S.J. Yatani A. Vatner D.E.

The external solution contained (mmol/liter): 2 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 135 tetraethyl ammonium chloride, 5 4-aminopyridine, 10 glucose, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.3). The pipette solution contained (mmol/liter): 100 Cs-aspartate, 20 CsCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 MgATP, 0.5 GTP, 5 EGTA, and 5 HEPES (pH 7.3). These solutions provided isolation of Ca2+ currents from other membrane currents and from the Na+/Ca2+ exchanger. Western Blot Analysis for SERCA2a, PLB, Calsequestrin, α1c, and NCX—Left ventricular tissue was obtained and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen (-80 °C). On the day of the experiment, tissue samples were homogenized in 0.75 m NaCl, 10 mm histidine (pH 7.5) with protease, phosphatase, and kinase inhibitors. Equal amounts of protein were dissolved in 1% SDS, 100 mmol/liter Tris-HCl (pH 6.5), 10% glycerol, 0.05% bromphenol blue, 5% 2-mercaptoethanol, separated by 12.5% SDS-PAGE, and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. Blots for SERCA2a and PLB were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with a 1:20,000 dilution of rabbit anti-SERCA2a polyclonal antibody (generous gift from Dr. Frank Wuytack, Leuven, Belgium) or 1:20,000 mouse anti-PLB monoclonal Ab (Affinity BioReagents Inc., Golden, CO) in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween 20 and 5% nonfat milk. Blots for calsequestrin were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:25,000 dilution of rabbit anti-canine cardiac calsequestrin polyclonal antibody (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY) in the same buffer. Blots for NCX were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:1,000 dilution of monoclonal anti-NCX (Swant) in Tris-buffered saline and 1% milk. Blots for α1c were incubated overnight at 4 °C with a 1:500 dilution of anti-α1c antibody (Affinity BioReagents) in Trisbuffered saline and 1% milk. Intensities of the bands were evaluated by densitometric scanning using a Personal Densitometer SI with ImageQuaNT software (Amersham Biosciences) and normalized for protein loading. Alkaline Phosphatase Treatment—Cell lysates (15 μg) were treated with a one-ninth volume of 10× alkaline phosphatase buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) at 30 °C for 10 min and then treated with 30 units of calf intestine alkaline phosphatase at 30 °C for 10 min. 4× SDS-PAGE loading buffer was added, and the samples were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE. Then, SERCA2a protein was processed for Western blotting as described above. Ryanodine Receptor Binding Studies—Ryanodine receptor binding studies were conducted as described previously (20Vatner D.E. Sato N. Kiuchi K. Shannon R.P. Vatner S.F. Circulation. 1994; 90: 1423-1430Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Assays were performed using 6 concentrations of [3H]ryanodine (1 to 30 nmol/liter) and 100 μg of membrane protein in HEPES buffer (with 0.3 mmol/liter CaCl2) in a total volume of 150 μl. Unlabeled ryanodine (10 μmol/liter) was used to determine nonspecific binding. Incubation was at 37 °C for 90 min. All assays were performed in triplicate and terminated by rapid filtration through Whatman GF/F filters washed with 4 ml of cold buffer (150 mmol/liter KCl, 10 mmol/liter Tris HCl, pH 7.4). Filters were vortexed in 5 ml of Ecoscint and counted in a beta scintillation counter for 5 min. All assays were standardized by the protein content. Protein concentrations were determined using the BCA method. A linear regression was performed on the amount bound versus bound/free ligand. Gene Expression by Reverse Transcription-PCR—Under anesthesia, the mouse heart was removed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C. The tissue was homogenized in a solution containing guanidine isothiocyanate in the presence of 12 μg of Escherichia coli rRNA as a carrier, and total RNA was isolated by the CsCl gradient technique. After ultracentrifugation at room temperature in a TL100 (Beckman) at 48,000 × g for 19 h, the supernatant was removed and the RNA pellet was dissolved in water. Sodium acetate (pH 5.3) was added to the solution to a final concentration of 3 m, and the RNA was precipitated with absolute ethanol. The RNA was then rinsed in 70% ethanol, vacuum-dried, and re-dissolved in water. cDNA was synthesized from 2 μg of total RNA by using random primers and reverse transcriptase according to the manufacturer's instructions (Roche Applied Science). PCR was performed in a final volume of 50 μl in the presence of 2.5 units of Taq polymerase (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). The samples were amplified in a GeneAmp PCR System 9600 thermal cycler (PerkinElmer Life Sciences) for each pair of oligonucleotide primers as described below. The following forward (f) and reverse (r) primers and PCR conditions were used for amplification: SERCA, f, 5′-GA(C/T)GC(G/A)CC(C/A)GCTCTGAAGA-3′, and r, 5′-CATGATGTCCAGATCTGG(A/T)GG-3′ (amplification program: 25 cycles of 94 °C for 30 s, 53 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 40 s) (21Franklin I.K.

The PCR products were fractionated on 2% agarose and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Preparation of Adult Cardiac Myocyte Culture and Adenovirus Transfection—Adult rat cardiac myocyte cultures were prepared as described previously (22Kim S.J. Kudej R.K. Yatani A. Kim Y.K. Takagi G. Honda R. Colantonio D.A. Van Eyk J.E. Vatner D.E. Rasmusson R.L. Vatner S.F. Circ. Res. 2001; 89: 831-837Crossref PubMed Scopus (90) Google Scholar) to determine whether overexpression of Akt enhances the expression of SERCA protein as a mechanism responsible for the enhanced myocyte contractile and relaxation function. Adenovirus harboring either Akt (multiplicity of infection 10) or LacZ (multiplicity of infection 10) was applied 2 h after myocyte isolation. Methods for adenovirus transfection have been described (7Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol.

A comparison of the data among the groups was made by analysis of variance or by Student's t test, and statistical significance was taken at p < 0.05. The myocyte data were averaged for each animal for statistical comparison. Echocardiography—Heart weight/body weight ratio was increased (p < 0.01) in TG (11.5 ± 1.4 mg/g) compared with WT (7.2 ± 0.4 mg/g). The results of echocardiographic measurements are summarized in Table I. Heart rate was similar between TG and WT. The end diastolic wall thickness was increased (p < 0.01) in TG (0.84 ± 0.06 mm) compared with WT (0.62 ± 0.03 mm). Although end diastolic dimensions were similar, end systolic dimensions were significantly reduced by 15% in TG compared with WT (p < 0.05). The LV ejection fraction was significantly enhanced (p < 0.01) in TG (84 ± 2%) compared with WT mice (73 ± 1%). These results suggest that TG have concentric hypertrophy with increased systolic function.Table ILeft ventricular function measured by echocardiographyFunctionWT (n = 9)TG (n = 6)Heart rate (bpm)287 ± 16318 ± 22EDD (mm)3.6 ± 0.23.7 ± 0.1ESD (mm)2.3 ± 0.12.0 ± 0.1ap < 0.05 versus WT.

Open table in a new tab Myocyte Contraction and Ca2+Transients—Fig. 1 shows representative contraction/relaxation and Ca2+ transient recordings in myocytes isolated from WT and from TG. As summarized in Table II, quantitative analyses indicated that percent contraction was significantly increased in TG myocytes compared with WT myocytes (6.1 ± 0.2 versus 3.5 ± 0.2%, p < 0.01), and the rate of contraction (–dL/dt) was also significantly increased in TG myocytes compared with WT myocytes (-284 ± 15 versus -147 ± 20 μm/s, p < 0.01). Relaxation function in TG myocytes was also enhanced compared with WT myocytes; the rate of relengthening (+dL/dt) was significantly faster, (214 ± 15 versus 98 ± 18 μm/s, p < 0.01) and the time for 70% relaxation was decreased in TG myocytes (48 ± 2 versus 67 ± 5 ms, p < 0.01). The effect of constitutively active Akt overexpression is dependent upon the kinase activity of Akt, because myocytes isolated from Tg-KI-Akt did not show enhanced contraction and relaxation function. These results suggest that increased myocardial contraction seen in TG hearts in vivo is also observed in individual cardiac myocytes isolated from TG.Table IIContraction, relaxation, and [Ca2+]i homeostasis in isolated ventricular cardiac myocytesParametersWTTGTg-KI-AktContraction % Contraction3.5 ± 0.26.1 ± 0.2ap < 0.05 versus WT.

Open table in a new tab To examine whether the enhanced contraction and relaxation in TG myocytes are caused by changes in intracellular Ca2+ levels, we measured Ca2+ transients. As shown in Fig. 1 and Table II, the amplitude of Ca2+ transients in TG myocytes was significantly increased (396 ± 50 versus 250 ± 24 nmol/liter, p < 0.05). There were no significant differences in levels of diastolic free Ca2+ concentration (181 ± 11 versus 171 ± 14 nmol/liter, p = not significant). The time for 70% Ca2+ reuptake was also accelerated in TG myocytes compared with WT myocytes (78 ± 6 versus 141 ± 8 ms, p < 0.05). Thus, both peak Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ uptake are increased in myocytes isolated from TG. Myocytes isolated from Tg-KI-Akt did not show any significant changes in peak Ca2+ levels and Ca2+ uptake. These results indicate that changes in contractile function and Ca2+ transients are dependent upon Akt activity. L-type Ca2+Channel Currents—Because Ca2+ influx through L-type Ca2+ channels plays an essential role in excitation-contraction coupling, we examined L-type Ca2+ currents (ICa) in LV myocytes isolated from TG and WT (Fig. 2). LV myocyte size estimated by cell capacitance was significantly larger in TG myocytes compared with WT myocytes (Fig. 2B), consistent with the heart weight/body weight ratio data. The traces in Fig. 2 show typical ICa recorded from TG and WT myocytes. In both groups, ICa was activated around -30 mV and reached its maximum near +10 mV. However, the peak ICa amplitude, normalized by the cell capacitance (pA/pF) was significantly larger (p < 0.01) in TG myocytes (9.0 ± 0.3 pA/pF) compared with WT myocytes (7.2 ± 0.3 pA/pF). The inactivation kinetics of ICa at +10 mV was significantly faster in TG myocytes compared with WT myocytes (Fig. 2B). In mouse ventricular myocytes, ICa inactivation is controlled by Ca2+ in the sarcolemmal subspace (19Kim S.J. Yatani A. Vatner D.E. Yamamoto S. Ishikawa Y. Wagner T.E. Shannon R.P. Kim Y.K. Takagi G.

Cell Cardiol. 1999; 31: 1327-1336Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). To examine whether the difference in ICa inactivation rate between WT and TG myocytes was due to the contribution of Ca2+ released from the SR, the SR Ca2+ content was depleted by ryanodine (10 μm). Following the application of ryanodine, the rate of ICa inactivation as measured by t1/2 was significantly increased in both WT and TG myocytes, and no significant difference in the inactivation rate was detected between two groups (31.4 ± 2.3 ms, n = 6 versus 29.5 ± 2.1 ms, n = 6). The results indicate that the faster ICa inactivation observed in TG myocytes might be related to enhanced SR Ca2+ release (See below). SERCA2a, PLB, Calsequestrin, α1c, NCX, and Ryanodine Receptor Protein—Because both enhanced amplitude and relaxation of the Ca2+ transient may be caused by changes in SR Ca2+-handling proteins, the expression of these proteins was determined by immunoblot analyses. The protein expression of Akt in myocardium was increased ≈25-fold in TG compared with WT mice. SERCA2a protein levels were increased significantly (p < 0.05) by 6.6-fold in TG compared with WT mice. In contrast, protein levels of PLB, calsequestrin, α1c, and NCX were not significantly different between TG and WT mice (Fig. 3, A and B). The affinity and number of ryanodine receptors were similar between WT and TG (KD = 7.65 versus 6.95 nm; Bmax = 499 versus 511 fmol/mg in WT and TG mice). Semi-quantitative reverse transcription-PCR measurements indicated that there was no significant difference in SERCA2a mRNA levels between TG and WT (Fig. 3C). Thus, the increase in SERCA2a protein in TG occurs post-transcriptionally. Overexpression of Akt Increases Expression of SERCA2a in Adult Ventricular Cardiac Myocytes—To determine whether transient overexpression of Akt is sufficient to increase SERCA2a protein expression in cardiac myocytes, we conducted adenovirus-mediated overexpression of Akt in primary cultured adult rat ventricular cardiac myocytes. Forty-eight hours after transfection, overexpression of Akt was confirmed by immunoblot analyses. Immunoblotting of the same filters with anti-SERCA2a antibody indicated that SECA2a expression was enhanced by 4.8-fold (n = 4, p < 0.05) compared with control virus-transfected cardiac myocytes (Fig. 4). Interestingly, although SERCA2a was detected in two bands in control virus-transfected myocytes, only a slower migrating form, possibly a phosphorylated form of SERCA2a, was detected in Akt virus-transfected myocytes. In fact, the slower migrating band disappeared after phosphatase treatment, consistent with the notion that it represents a phosphorylated form of SERCA2a (data not shown). Up-regulation of SERCA2a Increases Contractile and Relaxation Function in Isolated Cardiac Myocytes from TG—We examined the effect of thapsigargin, a specific inhibitor of SERCA2a, on contraction of isolated myocytes. The dose of thapsigargin inhibiting % contraction by half (IC50) was 2.6-fold higher in myocytes isolated from TG than in those from WT (Fig. 5). Enhanced relaxation function in TG myocytes was also abolished after thapsigargin (10-10m). These results are consistent with the notion that enhanced SERCA2a plays an important role in mediating increased cardiac myocyte contraction and relaxation in TG. Akt plays a central role in glucose metabolism, cell growth, angiogenesis, transcription, apoptosis, and protein synthesis (25Brazil D.P. Hemmings B.A. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2001; 26: 657-664Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1042) Google Scholar). We found that overexpression of constitutively active Akt in the mouse heart increased both LV ejection fraction, in vivo, and isolated myocyte contraction in vitro. A recent study using the same TG model demonstrated increased LV dP/dt with a nonsignificant increase in LV ejection fraction (11Condorelli G. Drusco A. Stassi G. Bellacosa A. Roncarati R. Iaccarino G. Russo M.A. Gu Y. Dalton N. Chung C. Latronico M.V. Napoli C. Sadoshima J. Croce C.M. Ross Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12333-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar). The failure to observe significantly increased LV ejection fraction in the prior study (11Condorelli G. Drusco A. Stassi G. Bellacosa A. Roncarati R. Iaccarino G. Russo M.A. Gu Y. Dalton N. Chung C. Latronico M.V. Napoli C. Sadoshima J. Croce C.M. Ross Jr., J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 12333-12338Crossref PubMed Scopus (404) Google Scholar) may be due to heart rate, which was significantly lower in TG than WT, whereas the heart rates were similar in the two groups in the present study. Interestingly, the improved LV function occurred in the presence of significant LV hypertrophy, which is thought to reduce LV function. The goals of the present study were: 1) to investigate whether constitutively active Akt has direct effects upon contractility and Ca2+ handling in isolated cardiac myocytes; and if so, 2) to identify the downstream mechanism of the enhanced cardiac myocyte function by Akt activation. We have demonstrated that the enhanced cardiac function in TG in vivo is associated with increased intrinsic contractile and relaxation function in isolated cardiomyocytes in vitro. Moreover, the increased contraction and relaxation in myocytes isolated from TG paralleled the increased peak systolic amplitude and more rapid diastolic decay in intracellular Ca2+ transients. The studies in isolated myocytes also demonstrated increased Ca2+ channel currents. These functional changes in isolated myocytes were not observed in Tg-KI-Akt, suggesting that they are dependent upon the kinase activity of Akt. This indicates that activation of Akt directly affects contraction and relaxation through changes in Ca2+ handling in individual cardiac myocytes. It should be noted that the enhanced cardiac contractility was not observed in TG mice with cardiac-specific overexpression of constitutively active PI3Kα, an upstream regulator of Akt (26Shioi T.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2537-2548Crossref PubMed Scopus (521) Google Scholar), or in other forms of constitutively active Akt (T308D, S473D-Akt, and myr-Akt) (10Shioi T. McMullen J.R. Kang P.M.

Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-γ activated by inhibition of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome 10) negatively regulates cardiac contractility (28Crackower M. Oudit G. Kozieradzki I. Sarao R. Sun H. Sasaki T. Hirsch E. Suzuki A. Shioi T. Irie-Sasaki J. Sah R. Cheng H. Rybin V. Lembo G. Fratta L. Oliveira-dos-Santos A. Benovic J. Kahn C. Izumo S. Steinberg S. Wymann M. Backx P. Penninger J. Cell. 2002; 110: 737-749Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (529) Google Scholar). Although myr-Akt is constitutively localized at the plasma membrane, both wild type Akt and E40K-Akt undergo growth factor-dependent membrane translocation (29Bellacosa A. Chan T.O. Ahmed N.N. Datta K. Malstrom S. Stokoe D. McCormick F. Feng J. Tsichlis P. Oncogene. 1998; 17: 313-325Crossref PubMed Scopus (458) Google Scholar). These results suggest that cardiac contractility may be tightly regulated by activation of a specific component of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway and/or by subcellular localization or the substrate specificity of the Akt mutants used. Thus, it is possible that E40K and wild type Akt may share downstream targets for the enhanced cardiac function. To identify the downstream mechanisms of Akt responsible for enhanced myocyte contraction and relaxation, we examined mechanisms known to control intracellular Ca2+ transients. We found that the amplitude of ICa was enhanced in Akt myocytes by ≈20% compared with that in WT myocytes, which may be at least in part responsible for the enhanced cellular Ca2+ transients. Akt mediates insulin-like growth factor-induced potentiation of ICa in neuronal cells (30Blair L.A. Bence-Hanulec K.K. Mehta S. Franke T. Kaplan D. Marshall J. J. Neurosci. 1999; 19: 1940-1951Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, to determine whether the increased ICa was due to altered Ca2+ channel expression, we measured the expression level of the α-subunit of the cardiac L-type Ca2+ channel (α1c) and found no significant differences in α1c protein expression between WT and TG. These results indicate that the enhanced ICa amplitude observed in Akt myocytes may be related to the altered channel regulation, i.e. an increase in open probability or conductance of L-type Ca2+ channels through increased phosphorylation, rather than protein expression. Ca2+ entry through L-type Ca2+ channels is a critical first step in the Ca2+-handling cascade. The cytosolic Ca2+ transients and contraction elicited by membrane depolarization are strongly influenced by the amount of Ca2+ influx through the channel. Thus, an increase in Ca2+ entry through the L-type Ca2+ channels is likely to contribute to the increase in cellular Ca2+ transients observed in TG myocytes (31Bers D.M. Nature. 2002; 415: 198-205Crossref PubMed Scopus (3389) Google Scholar). It is also possible that Akt could alter the Ca2+ dependence of the open probability of the ryanodine receptor. Our results, however, suggest that neither the affinity nor the total number of ryanodine receptors was affected by activation of Akt. In normal cardiac myocytes isolated from rats or mice, ≈90% of cytosolic Ca2+ is removed through SERCA (32Bers D.M. Circ. Res. 2000; 87: 275-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar). Overexpression of SERCA2a or the enhanced SERCA activity by phosphorylation of PLB accelerates Ca2+ transients and cardiac relaxation (33Baker D.L. Hashimoto K. Grupp I.L. Ji Y. Reed T. Loukianov E. Grupp G. Bhagwhat A. Hoit B. Walsh R. Marban E. Periasamy M. Circ. Res. 1998; 83: 1205-1214Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar, 34He H. Giordano F.J. Hilal-Dandan R. Choi D.J. Rockman H.A.

In the present study, SERCA2a protein levels were up-regulated in TG mice. Interestingly, we found that higher doses of thapsigargin are required to reduce % contraction in cardiac myocytes isolated from TG and the enhanced relaxation function in TG myocytes was abolished in the presence of thapsigargin. These results strongly suggest that increased levels of SERCA2a lead to enhanced Ca2+ transients and contraction as well as accelerated relaxation in cardiac myocytes. Our results indicate that up-regulation of SERCA2a expression by Akt is mediated by post-transcriptional mechanisms. The amino acid sequence of mouse SERCA2a contains potential phosphorylation sites by Akt. Our experiments using cultured adult ventricular cardiac myocytes indicated that adenovirus-mediated transient overexpression of Akt increased expression of SERCA2a. Furthermore, on the SDS-PAGE, only a slower migrating form of SERCA2a appeared after Akt overexpression. This slower migrating form disappeared after phosphatase treatment, and thereafter only the faster migrating form was observed (data not shown), consistent with the concept that SERCA2a is phosphorylated, when Akt is overexpressed. Whether SERCA2a is a physiological substrate of Akt, and if so, whether activation of Akt enhances translation or stability of SERCA2a, remains to be elucidated. We and others have shown that activation of Akt causes cardiac myocyte hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo (7Morisco C. Zebrowski D. Condorelli G. Tsichlis P. Vatner S.F. Sadoshima J. J. Biol.

Because ventricular hypertrophy is usually accompanied by decreases in SERCA2a, which lead to impairment of Ca2+ handling, up-regulation of SERCA2a and acceleration of Ca2+ transients despite the induction of hypertrophy in this transgenic model is unique, particularly in view of the well known effects of hypertrophy in interfering with Ca2+ handling and myocyte contraction (35Matsui H. MacLennan D.H. Alpert N.R. Periasamy M. Am. J. Physiol. 1995; 268: C252-C258Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 36Kiss E. Ball N.A. Kranias E.G. Walsh R.A. Circ. Res. 1995; 77: 759-764Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar). Because Akt prevents cardiac myocyte death in response to pathologic stimuli (16Fujio Y. Nguyen T. Wencker D. Kitsis R.N. Walsh K. Circulation. 2000; 101: 660-667Crossref PubMed Scopus (738) Google Scholar), stimulation of Akt might be an ideal method of enhancing the contractility of the heart and improving Ca2+ handling in response to pressure overload. In summary, transgenic overexpression of protein kinase Akt enhances myocyte contractility and relaxation through acceleration of intracellular Ca2+ transients. The underlying cellular mechanism(s) include potentiation of L-type Ca2+ channel function and up-regulation of SERCA2a."

In this study, we explored the relationship between VacA-induced cellular vacuolation and VacA-induced cytochrome c release from mitochondria. Within intoxicated cells, vacuolation precedes cytochrome c release and occurs at lower VacA concentrations, indicating that cellular vacuolation is not a downstream consequence of cytochrome c release. Conversely, bafilomycin A1 blocks VacA-induced vacuolation but not VacA-induced cytochrome c release, which indicates that cytochrome c release is not a downstream consequence of cellular vacuolation. Acid activation of purified VacA is required for entry of VacA into cells, and correspondingly, acid activation of the toxin is required for both vacuolation and cytochrome c release, which suggests that VacA must enter cells to produce these two effects. Single amino acid substitutions (P9A and G14A) that ablate vacuolating activity and membrane channel-forming activity render VacA unable to induce cytochrome c release. Channel blockers known to inhibit cellular vacuolation and VacA membrane channel activity also inhibit cytochrome c release. These data indicate that cellular vacuolation and mitochondrial cytochrome c release are two independent outcomes of VacA intoxication and that both effects are dependent on the formation of anion-selective membrane channels.

Krishna U.S. Israel D.A. Peek Jr., R.M. Cancer Res. 2003; 63: 951-957PubMed Google Scholar). Intracellular expression of VacA in transiently transfected HeLa cells or the application of purified toxin to HeLa monolayers has been reported to induce the release of cytochrome c from the intermembrane space of mitochondria, which suggests that VacA-induced apoptosis may occur via a mitochondria-dependent pathway (16Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). However, neither the mechanism of VacA-mediated cytochrome c release nor the relationship of this cellular activity to the more thoroughly characterized cell-vacuolating activity of VacA has been investigated. To explore the relationship between VacA-mediated cellular vacuolation and cytochrome c release, we conducted single cell analyses using a stably transfected HeLa cell line expressing a genetically derived fusion protein comprising cytochrome c and green fluorescence protein (CcGFP-HeLa), which is localized to the mitochondria (34Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). The CcGFP-HeLa cell line has emerged as a powerful system for studying fundamental mechanisms of mitochondrial perturbations leading to cytochrome c release (34Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 35Ricci J.E. Gottlieb R.A. Green D.R. J.

Collectively, our data indicate that cellular vacuolation and cytochrome c release are two independent cellular effects induced by VacA and that both are dependent on VacA-associated intracellular channel activity. Materials—Cell culture medium, fetal bovine calf serum, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), penicillin-streptomycin, cell dissociation buffer, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Invitrogen. H. pylori strain 60190 (ATCC 49503) was received from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). Bacterial culture media were obtained from Difco. Vancomycin, bafilomycin A1, 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)-benzoic acid (NPPB), DIDS, anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G-alkaline phosphatase conjugate, Phalloidin-TRITC, and most common laboratory chemicals and reagents were obtained from Sigma. 25- and 75-cm2 plastic flasks, 8-well chamber slides, and 96-well plates were obtained from Corning (Cambridge, MA). Centricon 100 centrifugal microconcentrators and filtration units were from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Purification matrices were from Amersham Biosciences. Tyramide signal amplification kit and anti-green fluorescent protein-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate were from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). Cell Culture—CcGFP-HeLa cells were a gift from Dr. D. R. Green (34Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). HeLa cells and CcGFP-HeLa cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 2 mm glutamine, 200 μg of penicillin/ml, 100 μg of streptomycin sulfate/ml, 100 μg of G418 sulfate/ml (CcGFP-HeLa only), and 10% fetal bovine calf serum and maintained at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2. H. pylori Growth and VacA Purification—H. pylori 60190 and 60190 isogenic mutant strains were cultivated and purified as described previously (39Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J. Cell Biol. 1997; 138: 759-769Crossref PubMed Scopus (179) Google Scholar). H. pylori was grown in culture flasks on a rotary platform shaker for 18 h at 37 °C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere in bisulfite- and sulfite-free brucella broth (10 g of tryptone/liter, 10 g of Bacto-protease peptone/liter, 5 g of NaCl/liter, 2 g of yeast extract/liter, 1 g of dextrose/liter) supplemented with either 2 g of β-cyclodextrin/liter or 5 g of activated charcoal/liter. H. pylori cultures were harvested by centrifugation at a relative centrifugal force of 7,500 by using a Sorvall RC2-B centrifuge at 4 °C. VacA was initially fractionated and concentrated by ammonium sulfate (50%) precipitation. The ammonium sulfate-saturated pellet was resuspended and dialyzed into PBS, pH 7.2. Concentrated VacA was further purified by fast protein liquid chromatography by using a Superose 6 preparative grade resin in a HR16/50 column previously equilibrated at 4 °C in PBS, pH 7.2. The fractions were concentrated using Centricon 100 centrifugal microconcentrators, tested for vacuolating activity, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining. For all of the assays requiring acid activation, 0.2 (v/v) 300 mm HCl was added to VacA preparations and incubated for 30 min at 37 °C and then neutralized with the same volume of 300 mm NaOH. As a control, PBS was “acid-activated” using the same protocol. Vacuolation Assay—Relative vacuolation was quantified based on the uptake of the dye Neutral Red within mammalian cells as described previously (40Cover T.L. Puryear W. Perez-Perez G.I. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1991; 59: 1264-1270Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The experiments were performed in 96-well plates, and Neutral Red uptake was determined using a Dynatech MR5000 microtiter plate reader to measure the absorbance at 530 nm (minus the absorbance at 410 nm). Unless otherwise specified, all of the assays were performed in the presence of 5 mm NH4Cl including controls (41Cover T.L. Vaughn S.G. Cao P. Blaser M.J. J. Infect Dis. 1992; 166: 1073-1078Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Cytochrome c Release Quantification—Confocal images were collected using a Zeiss LSM 310 confocal microscope (Thornwood, NY) with an Omnichrome external Ar/Kr ion laser (Melles Griot, Irvine, CA). CcGFP-HeLa cells were seeded at 5 × 104 cells/ml and 400 μl/well on 8-well microscopy slides and grown overnight. At the indicated intoxication times, cells were fixed for 30 min with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS (this and subsequent steps were performed at room temperature). When necessary for signal enhancement, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 for 10 min, washed three times with PBS, and incubated with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h followed by 60-min incubation with 5 μg of anti-green fluorescent protein-Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR). Images were collected with the laser attenuated at 50% using a ×40 or 63 objective at ×2-4 zoom, and frame was averaged four times. Release of cytochrome c-GFP was determined by field count. Data are expressed as the percentage of cells demonstrating cytochrome c release. All of the data represent the average (or a representative image) of at least 20 cells over three independent experiments. VacA Internalization Assay—HeLa cells were seeded on 8-well Lab-Tek chamber slides at 5 × 104 cells/ml and 400 μl/well and were grown overnight at 37 °C under 5% CO2. Acid-activated or unactivated VacA was applied for 18 h. Cells were then washed three times with PBS, fixed, and permeabilized as indicated above. At room temperature, the monolayers were washed three times with PBS and incubated with blocking buffer (1% bovine serum albumin in PBS) for 1 h followed by 1 h of incubation with 1:5000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-VacA. The monolayers were then washed three times with PBS and incubated with 1:100 anti-rabbit immunoglobulin peroxidase conjugate in blocking buffer for 30 min at room temperature. For detection of VacA, we used the tyramide signal amplification kit with Alexa Fluor 488 according to the manufacturer's specifications. Cells were then incubated with 1 μg of phalloidin-TRITC/ml for 20 min, washed twice with PBS, and imaged by confocal microscopy as indicated above. VacA Induces Cytochrome c Release into the Cytosol of Intact Cells—A previous study (16Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar) reported that intracellular expression of VacA or application of purified toxin to HeLa cells resulted in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria based on the detection of cytochrome c in the soluble fraction of lysates prepared from VacA-intoxicated cells. However, cellular fractionation can potentially induce mechanical disruption of mitochondria (34Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). To study effects of VacA on cytochrome c release in a system that does not require cellular fractionation, we performed single cell analysis of HeLa cells with a stably integrated gene expressing cytochrome c fused to green fluorescence protein (34Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar, 37Goldstein J.C. Kluck R.M. Green D.R. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 2000; 926: 132-141Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 38Bossy-Wetzel E. Green D.R. Methods Enzymol. 2000; 322: 235-242Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). An analysis of untreated individual cells within monolayers by fluorescence microscopy revealed punctate green fluorescence in the cytosol of each cell, which is the expected pattern when cytochrome c-GFP is localized to the mitochondria (Fig. 1, panel A). In contrast, incubation of monolayers with the apoptosis-inducing agent actinomycin D (1 μm) yielded cells demonstrating diffuse green fluorescence throughout the cell including the nucleus (Fig. 1, panel B), which is the pattern expected following release of cytochrome c-GFP from the mitochondria (34Goldstein J.C. Waterhouse N.J. Juin P. Evan G.I. Green D.R. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 156-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (886) Google Scholar). To test whether VacA induces cytochrome c release within intact cells, monolayers of CcGFP-HeLa cells were incubated with purified acid-activated VacA (750 nm, calculated using 88-kDa VacA molecular mass (42Nguyen V.Q. Caprioli R.M. Cover T.L. Infect. Immun. 2001; 69: 543-546Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar)) for 18 h. In contrast to the untreated cells, virtually all of the VacA-treated cells within the monolayer demonstrated diffuse green fluorescence, indicating that cytochrome c-GFP was dispersed throughout the cells (Fig. 1, panel C). Because the cells were extensively vacuolated (Fig. 1, panel F), which is a well documented characteristic of VacA-intoxicated cells (11Leunk R. Johnson P. David B. Kraft W. Morgan D. J. Med. Microbiol. 1988; 26: 93-99Crossref PubMed Scopus (535) Google Scholar, 43Cover T.L. Halter S.A. Blaser M.J. Hum. Pathol. 1992; 23: 1004-1010Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), the diffuse green fluorescence was most readily evident in the nucleus. These results indicate that VacA induces cytochrome c release from mitochondria within living intact cells. This finding confirms and extends the previous observation that expression of VacA in the cytosol of transfected cells or application of purified toxin results in the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria (16Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P. EMBO J. 2000; 19: 6361-6370Crossref PubMed Scopus (304) Google Scholar). In addition, the use of mammalian cells stably transfected with cytochrome c-GFP provides a convenient and powerful approach to determine the percentage of cells within a monolayer that have undergone cytochrome c release. Cellular Vacuolation and Cytochrome c Release as Function of VacA Concentration—To determine the relationship between VacA-induced cellular vacuolation and VacA-induced cytochrome c release, we investigated the extent of vacuolation and cytochrome c release as a function of VacA concentration. Monolayers of CcGFP-HeLa cells were incubated with a range of different concentrations of purified acid-activated VacA (1-1000 nm). After 18 h, the monolayers were analyzed for both vacuolation and cytochrome c release. These studies revealed very different dose-response profiles for vacuolation and cytochrome c release (Fig. 2). Whereas vacuolation was detectable at 10 nm VacA and maximum vacuolation of monolayers occurred at 100 nm toxin (44McClain M. Schraw W. Ricci V. Boquet P. Cover T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 422-442Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar), cytochrome c release was detected only with VacA concentrations >200 nm and maximum release of cytochrome c required VacA concentrations of 500 nm. The dose-response curves for vacuolation and cytochrome c release did not change when monolayers incubated with VacA were analyzed after extended periods (48 or 72 h) (data not shown), suggesting that changes in the cell because of VacA intoxication occur prior to 18 h. Temporal Relationship between VacA-mediated Vacuolation and Cytochrome c Release—To determine the temporal relationship between cellular vacuolation and cytochrome c release, we monitored the time course of cellular vacuolation and cytochrome c release in cells intoxicated with VacA. Acid-activated VacA (750 nm) was incubated with monolayers of CcGFPHeLa cells, and both vacuolation and cytochrome c release were monitored over 18 h as described under “Experimental Procedures.” These experiments revealed that cellular vacuolation and cytochrome c release occur by distinct temporal programs within intoxicated cells (Fig. 3). Vacuolation was evident within the monolayer as early as 1 h after the addition of toxin and progressively increased until approximately a 4-h time point when Neutral Red uptake reached a maximum value. In contrast, no cytochrome c release could be detected within the monolayer at the 4-h time point, but by 5 h, the vast majority of cells within any given field demonstrated cytochrome c release. Thus, vacuolation was detected in intoxicated cells at relatively early time points compared with the release of cytochrome c. Inhibition of VacA-induced Cellular Vacuolation Does Not Block VacA-mediated Cytochrome c Release—To further explore the relationship between cellular vacuolation and cytochrome c release, we tested the effect of a known inhibitor of VacA-induced vacuolation on cytochrome c release. Cellular vacuolation induced by VacA is dependent on the action of vacuolar-type ATPase proton pumps (45Papini E. Gottardi E. Satin B. de Bernard M. Massari P. Telford J. Rappuoli R. Sato S.B. Montecucco C. J. Med. Microbiol. 1996; 45: 84-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar). Vacuolation in VacA-intoxicated cells is blocked by bafilomycin A1, which targets vacuolar-type ATPase proton pumps (46Cover T.L. Reddy L.Y. Blaser M.J. Infect. Immun. 1993; 61: 1427-1431Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 47Ye D. Willhite D.C. Blanke S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 9277-9282Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar). To determine whether VacA-mediated vacuolation is essential for cytochrome c release in VacA-intoxicated cells, CcGFP-HeLa were preincubated with bafilomycin A1 (40 nm) for 1 h prior to application of acid-activated VacA (750 nm). As expected, there was no detectable vacuolation in bafilomycin A1-treated monolayers after 18 h, whereas control monolayers not exposed to bafilomycin A1 were fully vacuolated (data not shown). In contrast, essentially all of the cells within monolayers treated with bafilomycin A1 demonstrated cytochrome c release (Fig. 4, panel B), indicating that even in cells in which vacuolation had been blocked by bafilomycin A1, VacA was able to induce cytochrome c release. Activation of VacA Is Important for Toxin-mediated Mitochondrial Cytochrome c Release—There is substantial evidence that VacA associates with and enters mammalian cells to elaborate an intracellular activity resulting in vacuolation (44McClain M.

Notably, the entry of VacA into target cells is facilitated by activation, which consists of briefly exposing the toxin to acidic pH (44McClain M. Schraw W. Ricci V. Boquet P. Cover T. Mol. Microbiol. 2000; 37: 422-442Crossref Scopus (82) Google Scholar). Activation of VacA results in a significant increase in cellular vacuolation (39Cover T.L. Hanson P.I. Heuser J.E. J.

Because vacuolation experiments are routinely performed with activated VacA, we next tested whether activation of VacA is important for toxin-mediated cytochrome c release. Both activated and unactivated VacA were incubated with CcGFP-HeLa cells for 18 h. Using confocal microscopy, we confirmed that unactivated VacA enters cells much less efficiently than activated VacA (Fig. 5, panel B). In contrast to experiments conducted with activated VacA (Fig. 5, panel D), cytochrome c release was not detected in monolayers incubated with VacA (up to 1 μm) that had not been previously activated, even after 48 h (Fig. 5, panel E). Whereas previous experiments with transfected cells indicated that expressing VacA directly within the cytosol of target cells is sufficient to induce cytochrome c release (16Galmiche A. Rassow J. Doye A. Cagnol S. Chambard J.C. Contamin S. de Thillot V. Just I. Ricci V. Solcia E. Van Obberghen E. Boquet P.

Mice with reduced FABP content in fat (adipocyte FABP null) exhibit diminished fat cell lipolysis, whereas transgenic mice with increased FABP content in fat (epithelial FABP transgenic) exhibit enhanced lipolysis. To examine the relationship between the binding of FABP to HSL and activation of catalytic activity, isothermal titration microcalorimetry as well as kinetic analysis using a variety of FABP isoforms have been employed. In the absence of fatty acids, no FABP-HSL association could be demonstrated for any FABP form. However, in the presence of 10 μm oleate, A-FABP and E-FABP each bound to HSL with high affinity (Kd of 0.5 and 3 nm, respectively) in a ∼1:1 molar stoichiometry, whereas liver FABP and intestinal FABP did not exhibit any association. To compare binding to catalysis, each FABP isoform was incubated with HSL in vitro, and enzymatic activity was assessed. Importantly, each FABP form stimulated HSL activity ∼2-fold using cholesteryl oleate as substrate but exhibited no activation using p-nitrophenyl butyrate. The activation by A-FABP was dependent upon its fatty acid binding properties because a non-fatty acid binding mutant, R126Q, failed to activate HSL. These results suggest that binding and activation of HSL by FABPs are separate and distinct functions and that HSL contains a site for fatty acid binding that allows for FABP association.

Lipolysis is a complex metabolic process carried out by adipocytes during times of nutrient deprivation and/or stress in which fatty acids and glycerol are liberated from the triacylglycerol storage droplet and released from the cell. Released free fatty acids are used for β-oxidation and ketogenesis, whereas the glycerol is largely channeled to the hepatic gluconeogenic pathway. Although described in detail in several excellent reviews (1Londos C. Brasaemle D.L. Schultz C.J. Adler-Wailes D.C. Levin D.M. Kimmel A.R. Rondinone C.M. Ann. N. Y. Acad.

Krabisch L. Belfrage P. J. Lipid Res. 1972; 13: 424-426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). HSL is responsible for ∼50% of the fatty acids generated by white adipose tissue triacylglycerol hydrolysis (5Fredrikson G. Tornqvist H. Belfrage P. Biochim. Biophys.

HSL is an 84-kDa cytoplasmic protein composed of two distinct structural domains. The ∼48-kDa C-terminal domain contains the catalytic triad essential for triacylglycerol and cholesterol ester hydrolysis and has broad, albeit modest, amino acid similarity to several fungal and bacterial lipases (6Contreras J.A. Karlsson M. Osterlund T. Laurell H. Svensson A. Holm C. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 31426-31430Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). Inserted within the C-terminal catalytic domain is a regulatory module containing sites of phosphorylation (7Holm C. Langin D. Manganiello V. Belfrage P. Degerman E. Methods Enzymol. 1997; 286: 45-67Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) by the cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and the AMP-activated protein kinase. The catalytic domain is linked via a protease-sensitive hinge region to a ∼36-kDa N-terminal domain that exhibits no sequence similarity to other known proteins. The N-terminal domain has recently been shown via a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis, GST pull-downs, and co-immunoprecipitation studies to be the site of interaction with the major fatty acid-binding protein (FABP) of the adipocyte and has been referred to as a docking domain (8Shen W.J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). This interaction has been mapped to a region on the lipase between amino acids 190 and 200 containing two key charged amino acids, His194 and Glu199, that have been shown by alanine scanning mutagenesis to be essential for FABP association (9Shen W.J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Incubation of extracts containing the A-FABP with HSL as well as co-transfection studies of HSL and A-FABP in Chinese hamster ovary cells have indicated that A-FABP stimulates the activity of the lipase (9Shen W.J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). The FABPs as a class are ∼15-kDa soluble proteins that function by facilitating the intracellular diffusion of fatty acids between cellular compartments and/or enzymes (10Simpson M.A. LiCata V.J. Ribarik Coe N. Bernlohr D.A. Mol. Cell Biochem. 1999; 192: 33-40Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Structurally, the FABP fold has been described by a combination of x-ray and multidimensional NMR studies as 10 anti-parallel β strands arranged into two five-strand β sheets that fold together to form a barrel. Side chain packing closes one end of the barrel, whereas a helix-turn-helix motif caps the opposite barrel end and forms an interior water-filled ligand-binding cavity (11Xu Z.H. Buelt M.K. Banaszak L.J. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14367-14370Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Adipocytes express two FABPs, a major form A-FABP and a minor form epithelial FABP (E-FABP). Transgenic mice with elevated E-FABP levels in fat cells develop insulin resistance, whereas A-FABP null mice exhibit increased insulin sensitivity and protection from atherosclerosis, although the mechanistic origins of such metabolic effects remain to be determined (12Hotamisligil G.S.

Endocrinology. 2000; 141: 3388-3396Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar). The results from a combination of studies indicate that lipolysis is directly proportional to the total FABP abundance in the adipocyte and not a specific isoform. To pursue the hypothesis that the molecular interaction of FABP with HSL forms a component of the lipolytic complex, in this report we characterize the properties and specificity of such an association. We describe herein that in addition to A-FABP, HSL also associates with E-FABP, but not with FABPs from liver (L-FABP) or intestine (I-FABP) and the surprising finding that the binding is dependent upon fatty acids. Although A-FABP and E-FABP were the only FABPs to interact with HSL, each FABP isoform tested increased HSL activity, implying that under these conditions activation of HSL is unlinked to physical association. To separate binding from activation, a non-fatty acid-binding A-FABP mutant was utilized that failed to stimulate lipase activity, suggesting that the ability of FABPs to increase lipase activity is mainly due to their ability to bind fatty acids and relieve product inhibition. Consistent with this interpretation, no FABP form activated HSL when p-nitrophenyl butyrate was employed as a substrate. These results are framed within a model suggesting that HSL contains a fatty acid-binding site that, when occupied, allows for specific FABP association. Materials—Oleate and purified fatty acid standards used for gas chromatography analysis were purchased from Nu Chek Prep (Elysian, MN), and 1,8-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid (1,8-ANS) was purchased from Molecular Probes (Eugene, OR). All other materials were reagent grade obtained from the best available source. Protein Expression and Purification—Hi-Five baculovirus cells were used to express His6-tagged HSL in a detergent-soluble form as previously described (8Shen W.J. Sridhar K. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 5528-5532Crossref PubMed Scopus (182) Google Scholar). For purification, pelleted cells were resuspended in a buffer containing 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 300 mm NaCl, 10 mm imidazole, 20% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and lysed by sonication. The extract was subjected to centrifugation at 20,000 × g for 15 min at 4 °C, and the supernatant was recovered. The detergent-solubilized His6-HSL was immediately applied to a Ni-NTA-agarose resin (Qiagen), washed in lysis buffer containing 20 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, and eluted with lysis buffer containing 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0. Pooled fractions containing purified His6-HSL protein were dialyzed against buffer containing 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, 20% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 and stored at –80 °C until use. Approximately 1 mg of homogeneous His6-HSL could be isolated from a liter of culture and exhibited a specific activity of 70 milliunits (nmol/mg/min) using cholesteryl oleate as the substrate. The enzymatic activity was stable when frozen for ∼8 weeks. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay (Pierce). cDNAs corresponding to the rat intestinal FABP, mouse adipocyte FABP, rat liver FABP, rat heart FABP, and mouse epithelial FABP were subcloned into the pRSET vector to create His6-FABP fusion proteins. All cDNA subclones were verified by DNA sequencing. The plasmid corresponding to the appropriate FABP form was transformed into competent BL21 DE3 pLysS Escherichia coli cells and cultures induced with 10 μm isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h to obtain optimal FABP expression. For purification of each His6 FABP isoform, the procedure used for His6-HSL isolation was followed except for the exclusion of 20% glycerol and 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in the buffers. Each FABP form was soluble in the absence of detergent. For fatty acid binding assays, each FABP form was dialyzed into a buffer containing 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, and stored at –80 °C. For calorimetry, each FABP was subjected to a second round of Ni-NTA-agarose affinity chromatography, eluted in buffer containing 50 mm NaPO4, pH 8.0, 250 mm imidazole, pH 8.0, 10% glycerol, and 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and then further dialyzed to remove the imidazole. Any fatty acids bound endogenously to FABP were removed when isolated in the presence of detergent. To remove any fatty acids bound to the FABPs when purified from non-detergent-containing buffers, each purified protein was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and subjected to chromatography through Lipidx 1000 (hydroxyalkoxypropyl derivative of Sephadex G-25) resin at the same temperature. Fatty acids partition from the protein onto the resin, and apo-protein was recovered in the void volume. FABP fatty acid binding activity was stable when frozen for at least 6 months. Approximately 1.5 mg of each FABP form could be isolated from each liter of expressing bacteria. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry—To determine the thermodynamic parameters of the FABP-HSL interaction, isothermal titration calorimetry was used. FABP (0–5 μm) was titrated into a solution of HSL (0.5 μm), and the heat released or absorbed was measured. All of the incubations contained 0.5% Nonidet P-40. Binding studies were performed at 25 °C, and thirty-nine 6-μl injections of FABP were made into a sample cell containing 2.0 ml of HSL. Three controls were performed for each experiment: buffer injected into buffer, FABP injected into buffer, and buffer injected into HSL. Each experiment was repeated at least three times and analyzed using MicroCal Origin 2.9 software and fitted using one set of sites. The results from one representative experiment are presented in Fig. 2, whereas the thermodynamic data (see Table III) are calculated from all of the analyses.Table IIIThermodynamic parameters (apparent) of the HSL-FABP interactionProteinKdnΔG°′ΔH°TΔS°′nmkcal/molkcal/molkcal/molA-FABP0.5 ± 0.20.8 ± 0.3-13 ± 0.2-35 ± 2.4-22.5 ± 2.7E-FABP3.1 ± 0.30.9 ± 0.5-8.5 ± 0.5-45 ± 2.3-37.3 ± 2.0 Open table in a new tab Measurement of HSL Activity—HSL neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase activity was measured by analyzing the conversion of cholesteryl [14C]oleate to [14C]oleate. Briefly, aliquots of 100 μl of recombinant HSL (1–5 μg) in 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0, with maximum of 2% glycerol and 0.1% Nonidet P-40 were added to 700 μl of substrate emulsion (0.1 m cholesteryl [14C]oleate, 0.2 μm insulin, 2 mm EDTA, 50 mm NaPO4, pH 7.0) to initiate the reaction as described by Kawamura et al. (19Kawamura M. Jensen D.F. Wancewicz E.V. Joy L.L. Khoo J.C. Steinberg D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 732-736Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). Some assays employed cholesterol ester hydrolysis from lipid dispersed as an emulsion, whereas others relied upon preparation of multilamellar liposomes of phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidylinositol (3:1, w/w) for solubilization of cholesteryl [14C]oleate substrate (20Osterlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). The reactions were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min and stopped by the addition of 3.25 ml of methanol:chloroform:heptane (10:9:7) followed by 1.05 ml of 0.1 m potassium carbonate with boric acid, pH 10.5. The reactions were vortexed briefly and centrifuged at 2500 rpm for 15 min. The aqueous phase was recovered, and the radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. One milliunit of enzyme activity is 1 nmol of fatty acid/min released at 37 °C using cholesterol oleate. Specific activity is expressed in milliunits/mg of protein. Alternatively, p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) was used as a water soluble substrate as described by Osterlund et al. (20Osterlund T. Danielsson B. Degerman E. Contreras J.A. Edgren G. Davis R.C. Schotz M.C. Holm C. Biochem. J. 1996; 319: 411-420Crossref PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar) to determine HSL esterase activity. Lipid Extraction and Analysis—Fatty acids bound to bacterially derived His-FABPs were extracted using a mixture of chloroform-methanol-water (2:1:1.5 v/v/v) in a volume five times the sample volume after the addition of C15:0 as an internal standard. The samples were vortexed briefly and subjected to low speed centrifugation at 2500 rpm for 10 min. The organic layer was removed, and the extraction was repeated twice. Free fatty acids were separated from the other lipid classes as described in Ref. 16Hertzel A.V. Bennaars-Eiden A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2105-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar. The free fatty acids were recovered, pooled, dried under nitrogen, and then esterified using 14% boron trifluoride in methanol. The fatty acid methyl esters were separated by gas chromatography using a HP 5890 gas chromatograph (Aglient Technologies) equipped with a flame ionization detector and integrator. Chromatography was performed using an Omega wax 320 fused silica capillary column (internal diameter, 30 × 0.32 mm; film thickness, 0.25 μm; Supelco, Bellfont, PA). Individual fatty acid derivatives were identified by comparison of their retention times with those of authentic purified fatty acid standards. Fatty Acid Binding Studies—The fatty acid binding properties of each protein were evaluated using the fluorescent probe 1,8-ANS as a surrogate ligand as described by Jenkins et al. (21Jenkins A.E. Hockenberry J.A. Nguyen T. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Previous studies have demonstrated that A-FABP forms a physical complex with hormone-sensitive lipase and that coincubation results in an increase of HSL activity ∼2-fold (9Shen W.J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Similarly, co-expression of HSL and A-FABP into Chinese hamster ovary cells resulted in a ∼50% increase in HSL activity. However, in those studies the relationship of binding to catalysis was not addressed, nor was the specificity of the interaction with respect to other fatty acid-binding proteins. Moreover, studies in Chinese hamster ovary cells have been criticized because they do not eliminate the possibility that a FABP regulates another protein that in turn activates HSL. To address these issues, His-tagged HSL was expressed in baculovirus and purified by two successive rounds of affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA-agarose resin. The resulting purified fusion protein had an apparent molecular mass of 84 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE and was at least 95% homogenous (Fig. 1A). Five different FABPs were subcloned into pRSET to produce histidine-tagged protein and expressed into bacteria where they were each found to be soluble and purified similarly. In addition, a non-fatty acid-binding mutant of A-FABP (R126Q) was expressed and purified similarly. Depending upon the specifics of the cloning procedures, each fusion protein exhibited a molecular mass between 17 and 19 kDa, and was essentially homogenous as evaluated by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1B). To verify that the histidine tag did not affect fatty acid binding by the FABPs, fluorescence binding and displacement assays using the surrogate ligand 1-anilinonaphthalene-8-sulfonic acid was performed. Each of the fusion proteins exhibited similar affinities for 1,8-ANS. Displacement of the bound fluorophore using oleic acid as a competing ligand revealed that each of the FABPs showed a similar Ki value for oleate (Table I). The calculated Ki values did not differ substantially from the nontagged FABP forms, suggesting that the presence of the N-terminal extension does not significantly affect the fatty acid binding properties of the protein (22Kane C.D. Bernlohr D.A. Anal. Biochem. 1996; 233: 197-204Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar). This is not unexpected because the N terminus of each FABP form is essentially 180° from the portal region (21Jenkins A.E. Hockenberry J.A. Nguyen T. Bernlohr D.A. Biochemistry. 2002; 41: 2022-2027Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), the site of ligand entry/exit into the binding cavity.Table I1,8-ANS Binding by FABPsProteinKd 1,8-ANSKi oleatenmnmA-FABP550 ± 20170 ± 60E-FABP2570 ± 1080720 ± 470I-FABP2120 ± 1470300 ± 120L-FABP1830 ± 570400 ± 260R126Q A-FABPNDaND, not determinable.NDNon-His A-FABP1680 ± 600196 ± 15a ND, not determinable. Open table in a new tab Gas chromatography was used to determine the fatty acid composition of the lipid pool endogenously bound to each of the FABP isoform when purified from bacterial extracts. Gas chromatography analysis revealed that the different FABPs copurify with varying amounts of bound fatty acids (Table II) with the most common being palmitate, oleate, and stearate. In contrast, when the FABPs were purified using Ni-NTA-agarose in the presence of 0.5% detergent, the fatty acids partition from the protein into the detergent micelle, and the proteins are isolated in their apo forms. To delipidate the FABPs without the use of detergent, chromatography through Lipidx resin (23Matarese V. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 14544-14551Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) was employed and was found to be an effective method to remove endogenous fatty acids (Table II). As such, various FABP forms in either their holo or apo forms, in the presence or absence of detergent, could be prepared readily. Moreover, the addition of fatty acids to a solution containing FABPs in detergent results in partitioning of the fatty acids into the micelle. This point is important and demonstrates that even when fatty acids have been added, FABPs in detergent solution are essentially apo protein, devoid of bound fatty acid.Table IIFatty acids bound endogenously to FABPsFatty acidL-FABPH-FABPE-FABPI-FABPA-FABP%%%%%C14:0trace01000C14:1tracetrace300C16:0157422tracetraceC16:100400C18:00261700C18:1aThe sum of 18:1 plus 18:1-hydroxylated FA forms.8504300a The sum of 18:1 plus 18:1-hydroxylated FA forms. Open table in a new tab To evaluate the interaction between each FABP and HSL in the absence of catalysis, isothermal titration calorimetry was employed in the presence of detergent to solubilize the HSL. Isothermal titration calorimetry has the additional benefit of providing thermodynamic parameters associated with the interaction, thereby allowing for a quantitative assessment of association (24Leavitt S. Freire E. Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. 2001; 11: 560-566Crossref PubMed Scopus (560) Google Scholar). Controls for isothermal titration calorimetry included titrating buffer into buffer, buffer into HSL, and FABP into buffer, and the heat generated/consumed was subtracted from the experimental data to focus on specific heat of association. The corrected data were analyzed using Origin 2.9 software and experimentally fitted using several different model parameters. Analysis of the data revealed a best fit line using a simple single site binding model. Binding isotherms for four different FABPs are shown in Fig. 2 and are representative of three independent experiments. The thermodynamic data derived from such progress curves is presented in Table III. It should be noted that due to the presence of 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in the determinations, all of the thermodynamic parameters should be considered apparent values. Importantly, no physical association between any of the FABP forms with HSL could be detected in the absence of fatty acids. In contrast, when calorimetry was performed in the presence of oleate (10 μm), only A-FABP and E-FABP interacted with HSL; L-FABP and I-FABP exhibited no interaction. Because in these experiments the oleate partitions into the detergent micelle (0.5% Nonidet P-40), the concentration of free fatty acid in the aqueous phase is extremely low, and the results are simply reported relative to the total amount of fatty acid added. As shown by gas chromatography analysis, even though fatty acids have been added to the binding reaction, the FABPs are in their apo protein form. As such, in these experiments, the fatty acids are not bound to the FABPs but are found in the detergent micelle in potential association with the HSL. Under the conditions utilized, A-FABP and E-FABP each interacted with HSL with a stoichiometry (n) of 0.8–0.9 (Table III), indicative of the formation of a binary complex between the FABPs and HSL. The estimated dissociation constants derived from the thermodynamic parameters for A-FABP and E-FABP indicated a tight binding between the FABPs and HSL in the presence of fatty acids (Kd = 0.5 and 3 nm, respectively) (Table III). To assess the effect of FABP association on the activity of HSL, the cholesteryl-oleate esterase activity of HSL was evaluated in the presence and absence of each FABP form. As shown in Fig. 3, when the activity was measured in the presence of each FABP isoform, HSL catalytic activity was enhanced about 2-fold. The stimulation with the different isoforms was dependent on the ratio of FABP to HSL in the assay. At maximal values each of the FABPs stimulated HSL activity. Glutathione S-transferase, a non-fatty acid-binding protein, did not activate HSL to any extent over a wide concentration range. These results suggested that binding to HSL and activation of HSL activity were not equivalent because L-FABP and I-FABP activated yet did not demonstrate any physical association. To evaluate the relationship between binding and activation, a mutant of A-FABP (R126Q) that exhibits a 100-fold lower affinity for fatty acids as measured using the ADIFAB method (25Richieri G.V. Low P.J. Ogata R.T. Kleinfeld A.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 7397-7405Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar) and fluorescence binding to 1,8 ANS (Fig. 4A) was used. The side chain of Arg126 is oriented into the ligand-binding cavity of A-FABP and forms an essential component of a hydrogen-bonding network involving the bound fatty acid carboxylate (26Sha R.S. Kane C.D. Zhaohui X. Banaszak L. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 288: 7885-7892Google Scholar). Although no crystal structure for R126Q A-FABP exists, all other mutant A-FABP structures reveal no significant structural changes accompany changes in cavity residues (26Sha R.S. Kane C.D. Zhaohui X. Banaszak L. Bernlohr D.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 288: 7885-7892Google Scholar). In addition, the tryptophan fluorescence spectrum for R126Q is identical to that for native A-FABP (results not shown). Together these observations imply that the structural properties of R126Q are comparable with that of the native protein. No stimulation in the esterase activity of HSL was observed (Fig. 4B) when A-FABP (R126Q) was added to HSL (Fig. 4B) and in fact was modestly diminished at high protein concentrations. As such, activation of HSL by A-FABP required fatty acid binding and is consistent with the concept that FABPs provide relief of product inhibition and that binding to HSL by FABPs was unlinked to activation, at least in vitro. To further evaluate whether the activation of HSL by the FABPs was a result of their ability to relieve product inhibition by fatty acid binding, HSL activity was examined using a water-soluble substrate, p-nitrophenyl butyrate. The product of hydrolysis in this case is the short chain fatty acid butyric acid that is not a ligand for FABPs. In this case, when each FABP isoform was incubated with HSL, no stimulation of lipase activity was observed (Fig. 5). The process of lipolysis is tightly regulated to ensure that the flux of energy from the adipocyte is synchronized to the immediate metabolic needs of peripheral tissues and is governed by the overall nutritional status of the body. To that effect, hormone-sensitive lipase, the rate-limiting enzyme in this process, is subject to several levels of regulation including phosphorylation/dephosphorylation, translocation, and association with regulatory proteins. The protein-protein interactions detailed within this report represent a unique mechanism by which HSL, and the overall process of lipolysis, is regulated within the adipocyte. Herein, we examine the interaction of different FABPs with HSL using isothermal titration calorimetry in the presence or absence of fatty acids. Using isothermal titration microcalorimetry, our results demonstrated that A-FABP and E-FABP physically associate with HSL in a fatty acid-dependent manner with high affinity and specificity (Kd = 0.5 and 3 nm, respectively). The thermodynamic parameters suggest significant enthalpic and entropic components to the reaction, consistent with the mapping of the FABP-HSL binding site to His194 and Glu199 (9Shen W.J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and to interfacial binding. Two other family members, I-FABP and L-FABP, that exhibit the same overall fold yet have very different amino acid compositions did not interact with HSL under any conditions. Second, in an attempt to distinguish binding from catalysis, the effects of the different FABPs on HSL hydrolytic activity were examined in vitro using cholesteryl oleate and pNPB as substrates. Unexpectedly, all of the FABPs (A-FABP, E-FABP, H-FABP, L-FABP, and I-FABP) stimulated HSL activity ∼2-fold when using cholesteryl oleate as substrate. Moreover, a non-fatty acid binding mutant of A-FABP (R126Q) as well as glutathione S-transferase did not activate HSL. Importantly, the activation of HSL by the FABPs was dependent on their ability to bind fatty acids and not physical association, because L-FABP and I-FABP did not associate with HSL in the calorimetry experiments. None of the FABPs was able to stimulate HSL activity when pNPB, a water-soluble substrate producing a short chain fatty acid product, was used to assess HSL esterase activity. Although this is consistent with the interpretation that the activation of HSL by the FABPs is dependent on their ability to bind fatty acids, it should be noted that conformational changes accompanying protein kinase A-induced phosphorylation of HSL increase hydrolytic activity against cholesteryl ester and triacylglycerol substrates but have no effect on hydrolysis of pNPB. The results presented in this report also describe E-FABP as also potentially involved in forming part of the lipolytic complex in adipose tissue. Results from FABP animal models paralleled these observations (15Coe N.R. Simpson M.A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 1999; 40: 967-972Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 16Hertzel A.V. Bennaars-Eiden A. Bernlohr D.A. J. Lipid Res. 2002; 43: 2105-2111Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Overexpression of E-FABP in fat cells of transgenic mice resulted in a surprisingly significant increase in lipolysis, suggesting that E-FABP, like A-FABP is a likely partner with HSL in mediating lipolysis. Interestingly, the pattern of HSL expression in different tissues is very similar to that of FABPs. HSL is expressed in adipose tissue, ovary, testes, heart, skeletal muscle (27Holm C. Belfrage P. Fredrikson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar, 28Kraemer F.B. Patel S. Saedi M.S. Sztalryd C. J.

FEBS Lett. 1981; 132: 10-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar) and has recently been identified in the intestine (31Grober J. Lucas S. Sorhede-Winzell M. Zaghini I. Mairal A. Contreras J.A. Besnard P. Holm C. Langin D. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 6510-6515Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The present studies did not detect any interaction between HSL and liver or intestinal FABP. The liver and the kidney (27Holm C. Belfrage P. Fredrikson G. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1987; 148: 99-105Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) do not express HSL, although other lipases are present in these tissues. As such, interaction of HSL with L-FABP would not likely occur physiologically. Although the expression of HSL in the intestine is localized to the same mucosal cells where I-FABP is expressed, an interaction between the two proteins is unlikely because of the divergent structural differences between I-FABP and the other FABPs. Our results demonstrate that all FABP forms are capable of activating HSL and that activation is linked to the relief of product inhibition. This result is consistent with the long standing observation that albumin, a nonphysiological fatty acid-binding protein, is needed for optimal in vitro activity. This point is supported by two experimental findings. First, the non-fatty acid binding A-FABP mutant (R126Q) and GST fail to activate HSL. Second, none of the FABPs stimulated HSL activity when pNPB was used as a substrate. This conclusion is somewhat at odds with previous studies where a different non-fatty acid-binding protein mutant form (R126Q,Y128F) was shown to partially protect HSL against product inhibition (9Shen W.J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). However, in those experiments, FABPs were provided as GST fusion proteins, and the assay conditions differed by the absence of detergent and a less stringent control of the fatty acids present. Unexpectedly, the interaction between the FABPs and HSL was dependent on the presence of fatty acids. The fatty acids present in the calorimetry experiments partition into the detergent and are either associated with HSL directly or induce an altered micelle structure that in turn results in an HSL conformation that allows for FABP association. Previous work has shown that fatty acids at high concentration inhibit the lipase (9Shen W.J. Liang Y. Hong R. Patel S. Natu V. Sridhar K. Jenkins A. Bernlohr D.A. Kraemer F.B. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 49443-49448Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), presumably by binding to the product site of the reaction. Our results suggest that such fatty acids may induce a conformational change in the protein so as to allow access of FABPs to the N-terminal domain. Although speculative, this concept is not without precedent within the family of neutral lipases. Derewenda et al. (32Derewenda U. Swenson L. Wei Y. Green R. Kobos P.M. Joerger R. Haas M.J. Derewenda Z.S. J. Lipid Res. 1994; 35: 524-534Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) have suggested on the basis of x-ray analysis of fungal lipases that the tertiary flexibility linked to “interfacial activation” is complex and involves multiple conformational states dependent, in part, on the occupancy of the catalytic domain by monoacyl lipids. This view is schematically depicted in Fig. 6. In this model, fatty acids produced through catalysis induce a conformational change that allows for apo-FABP binding to the region surrounding amino acids 190–200 of HSL. Close physical proximity of FABP to the catalytic C-terminal domain facilitates efficient release of fatty acids from the active site and relieves product inhibition. Subsequent release of holo-FABP from the N-terminal docking domain allows for the cycle to be repeated. Metabolically, the requirement of fatty acids associated with HSL for the interaction with FABPs suggests a unique feed forward mechanism and implies that the lipolytic complex formed by A-FABP and HSL is likely to occur at the lipid droplet surface where relatively high concentrations of fatty acids are generated during lipolysis and not within the cytoplasm. This proposal is currently being evaluated. In summary, the present work demonstrates that HSL interacts with A-FABP and E-FABP in a fatty acid-dependent manner and that such an interaction represents a novel feed forward mechanism for regulating HSL activity. It should be noted, however, that the work described was carried out utilizing nonphosphorylated HSL. Similar studies are currently underway using in vitro phosphorylated HSL to assess the role of protein phosphorylation in FABP association. Sincere appreciation is given to Dr. Leonard Banaszak and his laboratory members for the use of the laboratory facil-ities for isothermal titration calorimeter, as well as for many helpful comments and suggestions.

In contrast, the membrane subunits are not. The E. coli SDH crystal structure revealed two membrane subunits with a single heme and a single bound ubiquinone (14Yankovskaya V. Horsefield R.

The mutation, which affects the QP site, leads to the overproduction of superoxide anions, the accumulation of aging markers, and a shortened life span. Iron-sulfur clusters are one-electron carriers, whereas quinones are fully reduced with two electrons.

We mutated Pro-190 in the yeast SDH2 gene to Arg, Leu, or Gln (P190R, P190L, and P190Q, respectively). We also mutated Ser-94 in the SDH3 gene to Glu (S94E) to mimic the C. elegans mev-1 mutation. The SDH2 P190Q and SDH3 S94E mutants displayed reduced SDH activities, hypersensitivity to oxygen and paraquat, and a marked increase in superoxide production. Our results strongly suggest that the SDH QP site, with its ubisemiquinone intermediate, can be a significant source of superoxide production.

We wished to determine whether the yeast enzyme could also be a source of free radicals. In an alignment of the yeast and nematode Sdh3p sequences, Gly-71 of the C. elegans protein aligns with Ser-94, which we mutated to a glutamate (S94E) to mimic the mev-1 mutation. Residues 92–99 of Sdh3p contain a sequence (LSSLHRIS) that closely resembles a motif associated with quinone-binding sites (LXXXHXXT) (bold letters indicate key amino acids) (31Fisher N. Rich P.R. J.

Thus, Ser-94 is likely in the vicinity of a quinone-binding site. We also mutated SDH2 Pro-190 to Arg, Leu, and Gln. The P198R mutation in the human SDHB gene, which affects this conserved proline, results in pheochromocytoma (22Astuti D. Latif F. Dallol A. Dahia P.L. Douglas F. George E. Skoldberg F. Husebye E.S.

The P159Q phenotype was very unusual; aerobic but not anaerobic activity of the mutant enzyme led to radical-mediated auto-inactivation. The P159Q mutation was proposed to perturb the QP site allowing the ubisemiquinone intermediate to participate in hydroxyl radical generation (22Astuti D. Latif F. Dallol A. Dahia P.L. Douglas F. George E. Skoldberg F. Husebye E.S. Eng C. Maher E.R. Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001; 69: 49-54Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). The mev-1 and the FrdB P159Q mutations strongly suggest that free radicals are generated near the QP site. We have modeled the three-dimensional structure of the yeast SDH based on the high-resolution structures of the E. coli SDH, the E. coli FRD, and the W. succinogenes FRD. 2K. Oyedotun and B. D. Lemire, submitted for publication. From the modeled structure, we can see that Sdh2p Pro-190 is just over 4 Å from the ubiquinone occupying the QP site, whereas the Sdh3p Ser-94 is less than 4 Å from the QP site (Fig. 1). Growth Phenotypes of the Mutants—The SDH2 and SDH3 mutations were transformed into SDH2 and SDH3 knockout strains and tested for their abilities to restore MRC-dependent growth using glycerol, a nonfermentable carbon source (Fig. 2). Transformants containing an empty vector were unable to form colonies (Fig. 2, A and C). The Sdh2p P190R and P190L mutations were unable to complement the SDH2 knockout strain for growth on glycerol, whereas the P190Q mutation supported growth, which was only slightly slower than that seen with the wild-type SDH2 gene (Fig. 2A). The P190R and P190L mutations were not further studied. This result with the P190R mutation suggests that the human P198R mutation that results in pheochromocytoma is a severe allele that strongly impairs SDH activity. Similarly, we tested the ability of the Sdh3p S94E mutant enzyme to support MRC-dependent growth in an SDH3 knockout background, and we observed near wild-type growth (Fig. 2C). The Mutant Enzymes Confer Hypersensitivity to Oxidative Stress—The C. elegans mev-1 mutant is hypersensitive to paraquat (methyl viologen) and hyperoxia (18Ishii N. Fujii M. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanase S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar). Paraquat, an herbicide, is believed to induce oxidative stress through the generation of superoxide ions either in the cytoplasm (34Yanase S. Yasuda K. Ishii N. Mech. Ageing Dev. 2002; 123: 1579-1587Crossref PubMed Scopus (129) Google Scholar) or in the mitochondria (35Betarbet R. Sherer T.B. Greenamyre J.T. BioEssays. 2002; 24: 308-318Crossref PubMed Scopus (472) Google Scholar). The SDH2 P190Q mutation severely impaired MRC-dependent growth in the presence of 1.0 mm paraquat (Fig. 2B). The SDH3 S94E mutation conferred mild sensitivity to this stress (Fig. 2D). We tested whether the two mutant SDH enzymes also conferred sensitivity to hyperoxia in yeast. Wild-type SDH2 or SDH3 genes supported growth in 100% oxygen, although somewhat more slowly than in air (Fig. 3). The SDH2 P190Q mutation completely abolished growth in the oxygen atmosphere, whereas the SDH3 S94E mutation conferred mild sensitivity (Fig. 3B). Therefore, both mutations render cells less able to withstand exogenous oxidative stresses. We believe the mutant enzymes are themselves a source of oxidative stress that taxes the defense mechanisms of cells, which are then less able to cope with the additional stress of hyperoxia or paraquat. We cannot, however, rule out the possibility that the mutations indirectly impair the resistance mechanisms of cells. The Mutant Enzymes Have Reduced Quinone Reductase Activities—We purified mitochondria from the SDH2 P190Q and the SDH3 S94E mutant strains and their corresponding wild-type counterparts. We measured the succinate-dependent phenazine methosulfate-mediated reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol; this activity reflects enzyme assembly because it is dependent on the Sdh1p and Sdh2p subunits only and does not require catalytically functional membrane subunits (9Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 23956-23962Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar, 30Bullis B.L. Lemire B.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 6543-6549Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We also determined the levels of covalent FAD in the mitochondria; SDH is the major covalent flavoprotein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (36Robinson K.M. Lemire B.D. Methods Enzymol. 1995; 260: 34-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The succinate-dependent reduction of decylubiquinone or of cytochrome c requires a fully functional SDH capable of transferring electrons to quinone acceptors. As shown in Table I, both the SDH2 P190Q and the SDH3 S94E enzymes are efficiently assembled; the FAD contents are greater than those of wild-type mitochondria, and the phenazine methosulfate-mediated reduction of dichlorophenolindophenol activities are diminished, although not severely. In contrast, the cytochrome c and the decylubiquinone reductase activities are significantly reduced indicating that both mutations impair quinone reductase activities. A specific loss of quinone reductase activity is observed when the quinone-binding sites are perturbed (8Oyedotun K.S. Lemire B.D. J. Biol.

Open table in a new tab The Mutant Enzymes Are a Source of Superoxide Radicals— Superoxide production was assayed (as the superoxide dismutase-sensitive cytochrome c reductase activity) in the presence of cyanide to inhibit cytochrome c oxidase (38Imlay J.A. Fridovich I. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 6957-6965Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two pathways of electron transfer can be used to reduce cytochrome c; in the first, electrons flow through SDH to ubiquinone through the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III) and to cytochrome c; the second pathway involves a superoxide anion, which can directly reduce cytochrome c. Superoxide dismutase will inhibit the second pathway by converting superoxide into hydrogen peroxide. As seen in Table II, superoxide dismutase inhibits the rate of cytochrome c reduction demonstrating that a fraction of the cytochrome c is directly reduced by superoxide radicals. The addition of excess superoxide dismutase did not further decrease activity (not shown). For the wild-type mitochondria, the superoxide dismutase-sensitive changes in the cytochrome c reductase activity are small (<5%) and not statistically significant. In contrast, the changes in cytochrome c reductase activities for the SDH2 P190Q and the SDH3 S94E mitochondria are larger and are highly statistically significant. The mutant enzymes, although less efficient catalysts, divert a larger fraction of their electron flow to the production of superoxide.Table IISuperoxide dismutase (SOD), -sensitive succinate-cytochrome-c reductase activitiesEnzymeStrainSDH2SDH2(P190Q)SDH3SDH3(S94E)Cytochrome c reductaseaActivities are expressed as nmol of cytochrome c reduced min-1 mg of protein-1.

Open table in a new tab It has been suggested that flavin auto-oxidation is the source of oxygen-free radicals for the E. coli FRD and SDH, because excess substrate is able to suppress superoxide formation possibly by obstructing access of oxygen to the reduced flavin (39Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). For the E. coli SDH, an ∼10-fold decrease in superoxide generation occurs between 0.05 and 20 mm succinate; superoxide production is almost completely suppressed by 2–3 mm succinate (39Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). We determined the substrate dependence of cytochrome c reductase activity and of superoxide formation of the wild-type and mutant yeast enzymes (Fig. 4,Fig. 4). As expected, the turnover numbers for total succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities increased with substrate concentration (Fig. 4, A and B). The substrate affinities of the mutant enzymes have not been significantly altered; the apparent km values derived from the data in Fig. 4,Fig. 4 for the SDH2, SDH2(P190Q), SDH3, and SDH3(S94E) enzymes are 0.40, 0.26, 0.44, and 0.57 mm, respectively. The similar affinities of the mutant and wild-type enzymes are not unexpected because the SDH active site is quite distant from the QP site where the mutations are located. The superoxide dismutase-sensitive activity also increases with the concentration of succinate for the wild-type enzyme (Fig. 4C); the concentration dependence of the mutant enzymes closely paralleled the profile of the wild-type enzyme (not shown). In conflict with the flavin auto-oxidation model, the rates of superoxide production for the mutant and wild-type enzymes are highest at saturating succinate concentrations. At a succinate concentration of 20 mm, the enzyme-active site should be saturated, and flavin auto-oxidation should have been abolished as it was for the E. coli SDH. The turnover numbers for superoxide production are associated with large standard deviations because they are calculated as the difference of two large numbers (total cytochrome c reductase activity minus the superoxide dismutase-insensitive component of that activity). Our data do not indicate any inhibition of superoxide formation at high succinate concentrations and are not consistent with the flavin auto-oxidation model. The dependence of superoxide generation on succinate concentration is strong evidence that SDH, rather than some other MRC component, is the site of superoxide production.Fig. 4Dependence of activity on substrate concentration. SDH was activated in phosphate-containing buffer before succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities were determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of succinate with or without superoxide dismutase. Activity values are expressed as turnover numbers (μmol of cytochrome c reduced min–1 nmol of covalent FAD–1); succinate concentrations are in mm.

Biochem. 1997; 246: 103-111Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar), and complex III is a known source of oxygen-free radicals. We measured the glycerol phosphate-dependent reduction of cytochrome c in the presence and absence of superoxide dismutase to determine whether the SDH mutations affected complex III function. Glycerol phosphate is oxidized by the glycerol-phosphate dehydrogenase, an FAD-linked enzyme that, like SDH, reduces ubiquinone to ubiquinol (42Bakker B.M. Overkamp K.M. van Maris A.J. Kotter P. Luttik M.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 15-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). From ubiquinol, the pathway the electrons follow to cytochrome c is identical to that for the succinate-dependent reaction. If complex III function had been altered by the SDH mutations, then we might expect a large superoxide dismutase-sensitive component associated with glycerol-phosphate cytochrome c reductase activity. As shown in Table III, this is not the case; superoxide dismutase has no significant effect on this activity in wild-type or in mutant mitochondria. This supports our conclusion that SDH is directly responsible for the production of superoxide.Table IIISuperoxide dismutase-sensitive glycerol-phosphate cytochrome c reductase activitiesEnzymeStrainSDH2SDH2(P190Q)SDH3SDH3(S94E)Cytochrome c reductaseaActivities are expressed as nmol of cytochrome c reduced min-1 mg of protein-1.

Open table in a new tab Mitochondrial SDH is not normally considered a significant source of oxygen-free radicals (43Robinson B.H. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1998; 1364: 271-286Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar, 44Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 45Raha S. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar). Yet, there are theoretical considerations and experimental observations that suggest otherwise. A ubisemiquinone intermediate is an obligatory part of the SDH catalytic mechanism; single electrons are transferred from the [3Fe-4S] center in the Sdh2p subunit to ubiquinone bound at the QP site. Until another electron arrives, the enzyme must stabilize the ubisemiquinone radical and prevent its escape or inappropriate re-oxidation. Mutations in the vicinity of the QP site may compromise the ability of the enzyme to do so. The mev-1 mutation in the C. elegans SDH, upon which we modeled our SDH3 S94E mutation, is a QP site mutation that results in the generation of superoxide (18Ishii N. Fujii M. Hartman P.S. Tsuda M. Yasuda K. Senoo-Matsuda N. Yanase S. Ayusawa D. Suzuki K. Nature. 1998; 394: 694-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (584) Google Scholar, 19Senoo-Matsuda N. Yasuda K. Tsuda M. Ohkubo T. Yoshimura S. Nakazawa H. Hartman P.S. Ishii N. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 41553-41558Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar). Similarly, the SDH2 P190Q mutation is modeled on the E. coli FrdB P159Q mutation, which was proposed to produce hydroxyl radicals via a Fenton-type reaction (33Cecchini G. Sices H. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4587-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Fenton reaction forms hydroxyl radicals from hydrogen peroxide (generated by the superoxide dismutase reaction) when cuprous or ferrous ions are present (44Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar). Mitochondria contain both iron and copper, although both are normally complexed with proteins to prevent their participation in Fenton chemistry. The FrdB P159Q mutation is located close to the [3Fe-4S] cluster and may allow access of superoxide to iron atoms of the cluster leading to hydroxyl radical formation and subsequent enzyme inactivation under aerobic conditions (33Cecchini G. Sices H. Schröder I. Gunsalus R.P. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 4587-4592Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have not observed a similar inactivation of the yeast Sdh3p S94E enzyme possibly reflecting a different structure near the yeast [3Fe-4S] cluster that prevents hydroxyl radical formation. Complex I is a known source of oxygen-free radicals as it also generates semiquinones during its reaction cycle (44Raha S. Robinson B.H. Trends Biochem. Sci. 2000; 25: 502-508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (903) Google Scholar, 45Raha S. Robinson B.H. Am. J. Med. Genet. 2001; 106: 62-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (259) Google Scholar), and reverse electron flow from SDH can provide the electrons for this to occur (46Kwong L.K. Sohal R.S. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 350: 118-126Crossref PubMed Scopus (214) Google Scholar, 47Kushnareva Y. Murphy A.N. Andreyev A. Biochem. J. 2002; 368: 545-553Crossref PubMed Scopus (547) Google Scholar). Three points argue against this possibility accounting for our results. First, S. cerevisiae does not have a multisubunit complex I-like enzyme with numerous iron-sulfur centers (42Bakker B.M. Overkamp K.M. van Maris A.J. Kotter P. Luttik M.A. van Dijken J.P. Pronk J.T. FEMS Microbiol. Rev. 2001; 25: 15-37Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 48de Vries S. Marres C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Rather, it has a single subunit NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase, Ndi1p (48de Vries S. Marres C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1987; 895: 205-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar). Purified Ndi1p apparently catalyzes a two-electron reaction, because semiquinone signals were not detected by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy during a redox titration of the enzyme (49Seo B.B. Nakamaru-Ogiso E. Flotte T.R. Yagi T. Matsuno-Yagi A. Mol. Ther. 2002; 6: 336-341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Second, the mutant SDH enzymes are catalytically compromised for quinone reduction (Table I) and, thus, should also be inefficient in reverse electron flow. Finally, the production of superoxide radicals is proportional to the concentration of succinate (Fig. 4C) in the same way that the total succinate-cytochrome c reductase activity is proportional (Fig. 4, A and B). This would not be expected if the site of superoxide production was outside SDH itself. The SDH mutations we introduced are localized near the QP site and may increase superoxide production in one of two ways. They may allow an increased flow of electrons out of the enzyme to oxygen, or they may allow the premature release of the ubisemiquinone intermediate and its subsequent reaction to form superoxide. We cannot distinguish between these mechanisms, but we favor the latter possibility, because conserved residues in the E. coli SDH located near Sdh3p Ser-94 are required for efficient quinone binding. When the E. coli SdhC Ser-27 and Arg-31 are mutated, succinate-ubiquinone reductase activity is lost, the enzymes can no longer be labeled by a benzoquinone photoaffinity probe, and the apparent affinities (Km) for ubiquinone-2 are too low to be determined (50Yang X. Yu L. He D. Yu C.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31916-31923Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). The E. coli Ser-27 and Arg-31 correspond to the S. cerevisiae Sdh3p Ser-93 and Arg-97, respectively. The E. coli FRD and SDH enzymes are believed to produce superoxide through the reaction of oxygen with the reduced FAD cofactor (39Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar) rather than through the loss of electrons from quinones or from iron-sulfur centers. For these enzymes, high concentrations of succinate can fully suppress superoxide formation; the substrate binds near the FAD and is believed to obstruct the access of oxygen to the reduced flavin (39Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Our data do not support this interpretation for the yeast SDH. At a concentration of succinate of 20 mm, the wild-type yeast SDH demonstrates a more than 2-fold increase in the rate of superoxide formation over that at 0.1 mm (Fig. 4C); in contrast, superoxide production by the E. coli SDH is reduced by ∼10-fold at 20 mm succinate compared with its peak at 0.1 mm (39Messner K.R. Imlay J.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 42563-42571Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (221) Google Scholar). Furthermore, when assayed under identical conditions, the fractions of superoxide dismutase-sensitive succinate-cytochrome c reductase activities of the mutant SDH enzymes are larger than their respective wild-types at all concentrations of succinate (not shown). The simplest explanation for our results is that the QP site is a source of superoxide anions in the wild-type enzyme. The SDH2 P190Q and the SDH3 S94E mutations further increase superoxide production at the QP site by perturbing its architecture. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that mutated forms of a mitochondrial SDH can be significant sources of oxygen-free radicals. The mutations we investigated are located near the QP site, strongly suggesting that this is the site of radical formation. Additional studies will be required to determine whether paraganglioma or other types of mutations can similarly increase the formation of superoxide radicals. We thank Drs. Kayode Oyedotun and Zhongwei Zhao for helpful discussions."

Hereditary SP-B deficiency in infants or mice leads to respiratory failure at birth (3.Nogee L.M. Garnier G. Dietz H.C. Singer L. Murphy A.M. de Mello D.E. Colten H.R. J. Clin.

However, hereditary alveolar proteinosis in babies without any detectable mutations in the SP-B gene as well as acquired pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in children and adults are characterized by an intraalveolar accumulation of mature surfactant proteins and abnormal SP-B precursors. Furthermore, only SP-B precursors are detected in babies with congenital surfactant defects characterized by the absence of lamellar bodies in type-II pneumocytes. 2F. Brasch, unpublished observations.2F. Brasch, unpublished observations. Therefore, insufficient processing of proSP-B due to a lack or dysfunction of one or more proteases involved in SP-B processing might be yet another undiscovered cause of surfactant dysfunction in pulmonary diseases in babies, children, and adults.SP-B is synthesized in type-II pneumocytes as a 381 amino acid 42 kDa preproprotein. On route from its site of synthesis to the lamellar bodies, the processing to mature SP-B involves the cleavage of the signal peptide, glycosylation of the C terminus, followed by the cleavage of the N-terminal and C-terminal propeptide (7.Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B.M. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L559-L566PubMed Google Scholar). The processing of the ∼42-kDa proSP-B through ∼23–25- and ∼9-kDa proSP-B processing intermediates to mature 8-kDa SP-B is an at least three-step process with two distinct cleavages of the N-terminal propeptide and one of the C-terminal propeptide (8.Korimilli A. Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8672-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Although various proSP-B processing steps and the site of proSP-B processing have been described (8.Korimilli A. Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8672-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar, 9.Voorhout W.F. Veenendaal T. Haagsman H.P. Weaver T.E. Whitsett J.A. van Golde L.M. Geuze H.J. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L479-L486PubMed Google Scholar), little is known about the identity of the proteases involved in the posttranslational processing.It has been speculated that a cathepsin D-like protease is involved in the posttranslational processing of the hydrophobic surfactant protein B (10.Weaver T.E. Lin S. Bogucki B. Dey C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L95-L103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), but cathepsin D itself was not detectable in type-II pneumocytes, and no specific activity was found in isolated lamellar bodies (11.Arbustini E. Morbini P. Diegoli M. Grasso M. Fasani R. Vitulo P. Fiocca R. Cremaschi P. Volpato G. Martinelli L. Am. J. Pathol. 1994; 145: 310-321PubMed Google Scholar, 12.DiAugustine R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 584-593Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Recently, a novel aspartic protease, napsin A, was localized in type-II pneumocytes of the human lung by immunohistochemistry as well as in situ hybridization (13.Tatnell P.J. Powell D.J. Hill J. Smith T.S. Tew D.G. Kay J. FEBS Lett. 1998; 441: 43-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar, 14.Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Bur D. Kling D. Gruninger F. Giller T.

Jornvall H. Linder S. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 129-134Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar). The restricted tissue localization of napsin A in the lung suggests distinct physiological functions. Because napsin A shows 49% sequence identity with human cathepsin D and has a similar preference for cleavage between hydrophobic residues, we hypothesized that napsin A might be the cathepsin D-like protease involved in the processing of proSP-B (10.Weaver T.E. Lin S. Bogucki B. Dey C. Am. J. Physiol. 1992; 263: L95-L103Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16.Peterson J.J. Meares C.F. Bioconjug.

J. 1988; 254: 895-898Crossref PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar).To investigate the potential role of napsin A in the processing of proSP-B we studied the localization of SP-B precursors, SP-B, and napsin A in human lungs by immunoelectron microscopy. We also measured napsin A activity in isolated lamellar bodies and type-II pneumocytes. We characterized the proSP-B cleavage products generated by napsin A in vitro and compared them with processing intermediates generated by isolated lamellar bodies and SP-B precursors in human type-II pneumocytes.MATERIALS AND METHODSHuman Lungs—For the present study, we used eight non-transplanted human single donor lungs. Left and right donor lungs were separated shortly before transplantation. Although one donor lung was used for transplantation, the contralateral donor lung was fixed at the time of transplantation as soon as the clinical procedure allowed. Donor lungs were used for investigation only if they could not be made available for another suitable recipient by The Eurotransplant Foundation Center, Leiden, The Netherlands. All lungs were carefully examined by two pathologists (K.-M. M. and F. B.) by light and electron microscopy. As previously reported in detail, none of the non-transplanted donor lungs used for this study showed pathological changes and transplanted patients had a favorable outcome (19.Fehrenbach H. Wahlers T. Ochs M. Brasch F. Schmiedl A. Hirt S.W. Haverich A. Richter J. Virchows Arch. 1998; 432: 229-239Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 20.Fehrenbach H. Hirt S.W. Wahlers T. Schnabel P.A. Haverich A. Richter J. J. Heart Lung Transplant. 1994; 13: 1-13PubMed Google Scholar). Fixation was performed by instillation of the fixative via the airways to ensure rapid and uniform fixation as described in detail below.Isolated Human Type-II Pneumocytes—Isolated type-II pneumocytes were prepared as previously described (21.Gonzales L.W. Angampalli S. Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Feinstein S.I. Matlapudi A. Ballard P.L. Pediatr. Pathol. Mol. Med. 2001; 20: 387-412Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1-mm3 tissue explants of human fetal lung parenchyma from second trimester therapeutic abortions were cultured overnight in Waymouth's media (protocols were approved by the Committee for Human Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia). After overnight culture, 10 nm dexamethasone, 0.1 mm 8-Br-cAMP, and 0.1 mm isobutylmethylxanthine (DCI) was added to the medium and explants were cultured for 6–7 days to induce type II cell differentiation. Some explants were cultured with E64 in the media for 6–7 days to inhibit cysteine protease activity as previously described (22.Guttentag S. Robinson L. Zhang P. Brasch F. Bühling F. Beers M. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2003; 28: 69-79Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Type-II pneumocytes were isolated from tissue explants by enzymatic digestion and panning on plastic culture dishes to remove fibroblasts.Deglycosylation of Type II Cell Homogenates by PNGase F—Deglycosylation was performed as recommended by the supplier. Homogenized type-II pneumocytes (1 mg/ml) were incubated for 10 min at 95 °C in denaturation buffer. Then 10,000 units of PNGase F and G7 Buffer (50 mm sodium phosphate (pH 7.5)) (NEB, Beverly, MA) containing 1% Nonidet P-40 were added for 1 h at 37 °C. After addition of reducing sample buffer the lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE.Rat Lungs—Five male Wistar rats were obtained from the Zentralinstitut für Versuchstierforschung in Hannover, Germany.Expression of SP-B—Using a full-length human SP-B cDNA, mutated to contain an EcoR1 site at position 25 (taking the initiating methionine as position 1) and a Xho site at position 381, as a template, primers spanning residues 24–196 and 282–381 of the preproprotein were used to PCR amplify NproSP-B and CproSP-B, respectively. Both PCR products and the full EcoR1-Xho fragment encoding the full-length proprotein (residues 25–381) were cloned, sequence verified, and ligated into pET-23b vector (Novagen, Madison, WI). pET-23b provides translation initiation at the N terminus and a His6 tail for purification at the C terminus of the expressed protein. The resulting protein consists of 380 amino acids and has a calculated molecular weight of 42.14 kDa.Purification of Recombinant proSP-B as Well as the C-terminal Propeptide (CproSP-B)—Escherichia coli BL21(DE3)pLysS transformed with proSP-B and CproSP-B containing pET-23b plasmids were grown in LB broth containing 50 μg/ml ampicillin for 8–12 h to an A600 of 0.6. Isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside was added to the culture to a final concentration of 0.4 mm to induce expression. After 3 h, the broth was centrifuged and the bacterial pellet was lysed by sonication on ice in 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.4. The released inclusion granules were purified and washed by centrifugation and then solubilized in 20 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 50 mm dithiothreitol buffer, pH 7.4. After dilution 1:10 in 20 mm Tris, 6 m urea, 0.5 m NaCl, 3 mm reduced glutathione, 0.3 mm oxidized glutathione buffer, pH 7.4, the soluble inclusion granule contents were dialyzed twice against 10 volumes of the same buffer containing 2 m urea, then against 10 volumes of 20 mm Tris, 5 mm imidazole, 0.5 m NaCl binding buffer (pH 7.9). After centrifugation, the supernatant was applied to a nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid agarose column (Novagen). The column was washed and eluted using the supplier's protocols. The eluate containing protein was dialyzed against sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, and stored in aliquots at –20 °C.Antisera—Polyclonal antibodies were raised in the rabbit against recombinant CproSP-B, using standard protocols. IgG was purified from the serum by protein-A affinity chromatography (Pierce). The polyclonal antibody against napsin A was produced by immunizing rabbits with a peptide of 15 amino acids (SFYLNRDPEEPDGGE) as previously described (14.Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Bur D. Kling D. Gruninger F. Giller T. FEBS Lett. 1999; 462: 135-139Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). The C-terminal proSP-B peptide sequence Gly284-Ser304 (CFlankSP-B) was chosen for production of synthetic peptides and antiserum preparation as described previously (7.Guttentag S.H. Beers M.F. Bieler B.M. Ballard P.L. Am. J. Physiol. 1998; 275: L559-L566PubMed Google Scholar, 8.Korimilli A. Gonzales L.W. Guttentag S.H. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 8672-8679Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Rabbit antiserum and a monoclonal antibody specific for mature SP-B were kindly donated by Dr. J. A. Whitsett (Cincinatti, OH) and Dr. Y. Suzuki (Kyoto, Japan).Immunohistochemistry: Tissue Preparation and Immunostaining— For immunohistochemistry, two human non-transplanted single donor lungs were fixed by instillation of 4% buffered formaldehyde. Several samples from different sites were taken and subsequently routine paraffin embedding was performed. Immunostaining was performed using the alkaline-phosphatase method. Sections of 4 μm thickness were mounted on poly-l-lysine capillary slides and dried overnight at 37 °C. Paraffin sections were dewaxed with xylene, rehydrated in a graded series of alcohol, and finally washed in Tris-HCl (pH 7.6) for 10 min. The following steps were performed at room temperature with an automated staining system (TechMate 500, Dako, Glostup, Denmark). To avoid nonspecific staining, sections were blocked with buffer 1 (Dako) for 5 min prior to incubation with the primary antibody at the appropriate dilution in blocking buffer (Zytomed, Berlin, Germany) for 30 min at room temperature. After several rinses in buffer (Buffer Kit, Dako), the immunoreaction was demonstrated using the APAAP kit (Dako) according to the specifications of the manufacturer. Fast Red (Dako) was used as alkaline-phosphatase substrate. Finally, sections were rinsed in distilled water and counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (Dako).Immunoelectron Microscopy (Immuno-EM): Tissue Preparation and Immunogold Labeling—For immuno-EM, six human non-transplanted donor lungs were prepared as recently described in detail (23.Fehrenbach H. Ochs M. Uhlig S. Taylor A.E. Methods in Pulmonary Research. Birkhäuser, Basel1998: 429-454Google Scholar). Briefly, the lungs were fixed by instillation of a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.1% glutaraldehyde in 0.2 m HEPES-buffer (pH 7.4) into the alveoli via the airways. Sampling of tissue blocks was performed according to the rules of systematic uniform random sampling by superimposing a transparent grid over lung slices at random distribution (23.Fehrenbach H. Ochs M. Uhlig S. Taylor A.E. Methods in Pulmonary Research. Birkhäuser, Basel1998: 429-454Google Scholar). Tissue blocks were infiltrated with 2.3 m sucrose for 1 h and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen samples were transferred to 0.5% uranyl acetate in methanol at –90 °C for at least 36 h. Temperature was raised to –45 °C at a rate of 5 °C/h. Samples were washed several times with pure methanol and transferred to Lowicryl HM20 via HM20/methanol 1:1 and 2:1 for 2 h each. The blocks were polymerized under UV-light for 2 days at –45 °C.Ultrathin sections were labeled according to the following procedures:1)Ultrathin sections were mounted on Formvar-coated copper or nickel mesh grids. To block remaining free aldehyde groups and nonspecific binding sites, the grids were floated first on 0.02% glycine in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) for 15 min and then on blocking buffer containing 5% fetal calf serum/0.2% Tween 20/0.5% albumin in Tris-buffered saline (pH 7.6) for 30 min. Subsequently, the grids were transferred to the primary antisera (anti-NproSP-B, anti-CproSP-B, anti-SP-B, anti-cathepsin D, or anti-napsin A) diluted in blocking buffer for 60 min. Grids were rinsed 6 times for 5 min with blocking buffer, and immunoreactivity was visualized by incubation with a secondary 5- or 10-nm gold-coupled antibody diluted in blocking buffer. The grids were rinsed 4 times for 5 min with blocking buffer, 5 times for 5 min with Tris-buffered saline, and 3 times with distilled water. Finally, the sections were stained on a drop of 4% aqueous uranyl acetate, rinsed quickly 3 times with distilled water, and then dried overnight at 40 °C.2)Double labeling was performed for SP-B and napsin A. The labeling steps were performed as described above. Both the primary specific polyclonal antibody against napsin A (anti-napsin A) and the monoclonal antibody against SP-B (anti-SP-B) were diluted in blocking buffer. The immunoreactivity was visualized by incubation with a secondary 5-nm gold-coupled antibody against rabbit IgG and 15-nm gold-coupled antibody against mouse IgG diluted in blocking buffer.3)Additionally, we prepared serial sections and labeled alternating sections with anti-CproSP-B or anti-napsin A as described above.Labeled sections were viewed and photographed in a Leo EM 900 (Leo, Oberkochen, Germany) electron microscope at 50 kV.Isolation of Lamellar Bodies—Lamellar bodies were isolated from rat lung homogenates by upward flotation on a discontinuous sucrose gradient by modification of the method of Duck-Chong (24.Duck-Chong C.G. Life Sci. 1978; 22: 2025-2030Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Briefly, the heart, trachea, and large bronchi were removed and the lungs were chopped into small pieces. The lung tissue was homogenized and density gradients of seven consecutive layers of 0.8 m to 0.2 m sucrose were layered over the homogenate in centrifuge tubes. The tubes were first centrifuged at 1,000 rpm and 7 °C to sediment cellular debris and subsequently, without stopping, the speed was increased to 80,000 × g for 180 min. The lamellar body-rich layer was clearly detectable in the upper third of the tubes.Enzyme Assay for Napsin A—The determination of napsin A activity was previously described in detail (25.Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Bur D. Kitas E. Schlatter D. Rosse G. Lahm H.W. Giller T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, the napsin A activity was monitored by the cleavage of the fluorescence resonance energy transfer-based substrate DS3 (K(Dabsyl)-PQFFTEQ Lucifer yellow) over a 10 min time period using excitation at 390 nm and emission at 538 nm. The reaction was performed in reaction buffer containing 0.1 m sodium acetate buffer, 20 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (serine protease inhibitor), and 5 μm trans-epoxysuccinyl-l-leucylamido-(4-guanidino)butane (E64). Normally, 39 μl of reaction buffer was mixed with 1 μl of isolated lamellar bodies, and the reaction was initiated by the addition of 10 μl of substrate. As a result of enzyme activity, an increase in the fluorescence signal should be observed.Expression and Purification of Human Napsin A—Expression and purification of napsin A was performed as previously described (25.Schauer-Vukasinovic V. Bur D. Kitas E. Schlatter D. Rosse G. Lahm H.W. Giller T. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 2573-2580Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar). Briefly, human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells were transfected with an expression vector containing human napsin A cDNA. Napsin A was purified from the cell extract using the biotinylated propeptide ligands EK191 (Biotin-C14-TLIRIPLHRVQPGRRILNL) and EK193 (Biotin-C14-(β-Ala)7-TLIRIPLHRVQPGRRILNL). The fractions containing napsin A were pooled and stored in buffer (0.1 sodium formate, 0.1% Nonidet P40, 10% glycerol, pH 3.75) at 4 °C.In Vitro Processing of Recombinant proSP-B with Recombinant Napsin A or Isolated Lamellar Bodies—Recombinant proSP-B was incubated with recombinant napsin A in sodium-acetate buffer, pH 5.5, containing 0.01% Triton X-100 and 10 mm EDTA for 16 h at 37 °C. In control reactions, recombinant proSP-B was incubated without napsin A as well as in the presence of napsin A and 100 μm pepstatin. Furthermore, recombinant proSP-B was incubated with isolated lamellar bodies alone as well as in the presence of E64 (5 μm, Sigma), diisopropyl-fluorophosphate (DFP, 10 μm, Sigma), and pepstatin (100 μm, Sigma). After incubation, the reaction mixture was separated by gel electrophoresis as described in the following paragraph.Western Blot Analysis of proSP-B Processing Products Generated in Vitro and Type-II Pneumocytes—Aliquots of the reaction mixture and homogenized type-II pneumocytes before and after deglycosylation by PNGase F were separated using 4–12% NuPage® Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond ECL, Amersham Biosciences) according to the standard procedure of the manufacturer. Briefly, the membranes were blocked using blocking reagent (Bio-Rad) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with one of the following antisera: anti-SP-B, anti-CproSP-B, or anti-CFlankSP-B. The immunoreaction was detected using polyclonal antisera against rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (1:20,000, Dianova, Hamburg, Germany). The immunoreaction was visualized using the Western blot amplification module and the Opti-4CN Substrate Kit (Bio-Rad).Mass Spectrometric Determination of Napsin A Cleavage Sites within proSP-B—The precise determination of napsin A cleavage sites within proSP-B was performed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight (MALDI-TOF-MS).Recombinant human proSP-B was incubated with napsin A, and 0.5 μl aliquots were taken at indicated time points. The samples were subsequently co-crystallised with 0.5 μl of sinapinic acid (saturated in 70% acetonitrile) on a SCOUT 384-MALDI-Target. The mass spectrometry was performed on a MALDI-TOF-MS (Reflex III, Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA) in linear mode with internal calibration. The annotation of the proSP-B fragments was done with the BioTools 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonics). Fragment annotations were validated by C-terminal sequencing using carboxypeptidase C (sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics) and MALDI-TOF-MS.Comparison of Cleavage Fragments Generated by Napsin A or Isolated Lamellar Bodies Using Mass Spectrometric Peptide Mapping— Digestion of human recombinant SP-B with human recombinant napsin A or isolated lamellar bodies was performed as described above. The digestions were first separated by SDS-PAGE in duplicate. One lane was blotted and stained with anti-SP-B. The corresponding SP-B digestion products from the other lane were excised from the gel. Next, in-gel tryptic digestions were performed with a method adapted from Shevchenko et al. (26.Shevchenko A. Wilm M. Vorm O. Mann M. Anal. Chem. 1996; 68: 850-858Crossref PubMed Scopus (7768) Google Scholar). Gel pieces were washed by repeated addition and removal of 0.1 m NH4HCO3 and acetonitrile, respectively. Subsequently, the gel particles were dried down in a vacuum centrifuge. Thereafter they were rehydrated with freshly prepared digestion buffer containing 50 mm NH4HCO3 and 12.5 ng/μl of trypsin (modified, sequencing grade, Roche Diagnostics) and incubated at 37 °C overnight. The peptides were extracted from the gel by repeated addition of a sufficient volume of 25 mm NH4HCO3 and acetonitrile, respectively. The extraction was forced by sonification. All extracts were pooled and dried in a vacuum centrifuge. For mass spectrometric peptide mapping, the peptides were redissolved in 5 μl 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid and purified on a 250 nl reversed-phase (C18)-nanocolumn. Peptides were eluted in 1 μl of 70% (v/v) acetonitrile and subsequently co-crystallised with α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (20 mg/ml) in 70% acetonitrile on a SCOUT 384-MALDI-Target. The mass spectrometry was performed on a MALDI-TOF-MS (Reflex III, Bruker Daltonics) in reflector mode with external calibration. Annotation of the tryptic fragments was done using the BioTools 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonics).RESULTSDistribution of Aspartic Proteases in Human Lungs—Immunohistochemistry revealed that napsin A, but not cathepsins D or E (not shown), was localized in type-II pneumocytes. As an internal positive control, the alveolar macrophages as well as ciliated bronchial epithelial cells showed a positive staining for cathepsin D (not shown). Cathepsin E was detected only in nonciliated bronchial epithelial cells (not shown). In type-II pneumocytes, immuno-EM identified napsin A in the ER, Golgi vesicles, multivesicular bodies, composite bodies, and in lamellar bodies preferentially over the projection core (Fig. 1, a–c). We also detected napsin A in the alveolar space and in many lysosomes of the alveolar macrophages (Fig. 1d). Because it was known that multivesicular bodies represent a heterogeneous population (27.Brasch F. ten Brinke A. Johnen G. Ochs M. Kapp N. Müller K.M. Beers M.F. Fehrenbach H. Richter J. Batenburg J.J. Bühling F. Am. J. Respir. Cell Mol. Biol. 2002; 26: 659-670Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar) and the colocalization of the enzyme and substrate is a prerequisite for the processing in vivo, we labeled alternating sections with anti-CproSP-B or anti-napsin A and performed double-labeling experiments for napsin A and SP-B. Although napsin A and proSP-B were colocalized only in a few multivesicular bodies (Fig. 2, a and b), napsin A and SP-B were colocalized in many multivesicular, composite, and lamellar bodies (Fig. 2, c and d).Fig. 2Colocalization of napsin A and precursors of SP-B as well as SP-B by immuno-EM. Serial sections labeled alternately for napsin A (10 nm secondary antibody-gold complex) (a) and the C-terminal propeptide of proSP-B (CproSP-B, 10 nm secondary antibody-gold complex) (b) revealed a colocalization of napsin A and precursors of SP-B in a few multivesicular bodies (arrows), but not in composite or lamellar bodies (lb). Napsin A (5 nm secondary antibody-gold complex) was colocalized with SP-B (15 nm secondary antibody-gold complex) in many multivesicular bodies (mvb) (c), the vesicular part (arrows) of composite bodies (cb) (d), and over the projection core of lamellar bodies (lb) (c).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Enzymatic Napsin A Activity in Isolated Lamellar Bodies and Type-II Pneumocytes—Because it was known that napsin A is synthesized as an inactive preproprotein and antisera directed against napsin A do not differentiate between the inactive precursor and the mature enzyme, we measured napsin A activi"
https://openalex.org/W2001479779,"A fine control of the blood glucose level is essential to avoid hyper- or hypo-glycemic shocks associated with many metabolic disorders, including diabetes mellitus and type I glycogen storage disease. Between meals, the primary source of blood glucose is gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. In the final step of both pathways, glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) is hydrolyzed to glucose by the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) complex. Because G6Pase (renamed G6Pase-α) is primarily expressed only in the liver, kidney, and intestine, it has implied that most other tissues cannot contribute to interprandial blood glucose homeostasis. We demonstrate that a novel, widely expressed G6Pase-related protein, PAP2.8/UGRP, renamed here G6Pase-β, is an acid-labile, vanadate-sensitive, endoplasmic reticulum-associated phosphohydrolase, like G6Pase-α. Both enzymes have the same active site structure, exhibit a similar Km toward G6P, but the Vmax of G6Pase-α is ∼6-fold greater than that of G6Pase-β. Most importantly, G6Pase-β couples with the G6P transporter to form an active G6Pase complex that can hydrolyze G6P to glucose. Our findings challenge the current dogma that only liver, kidney, and intestine can contribute to blood glucose homeostasis and explain why type Ia glycogen storage disease patients, lacking a functional liver/kidney/intestine G6Pase complex, are still capable of endogenous glucose production.

We demonstrate that a novel, widely expressed G6Pase-related protein, PAP2.8/UGRP, renamed here G6Pase-β, is an acid-labile, vanadate-sensitive, endoplasmic reticulum-associated phosphohydrolase, like G6Pase-α. Both enzymes have the same active site structure, exhibit a similar Km toward G6P, but the Vmax of G6Pase-α is ∼6-fold greater than that of G6Pase-β. Most importantly, G6Pase-β couples with the G6P transporter to form an active G6Pase complex that can hydrolyze G6P to glucose. Our findings challenge the current dogma that only liver, kidney, and intestine can contribute to blood glucose homeostasis and explain why type Ia glycogen storage disease patients, lacking a functional liver/kidney/intestine G6Pase complex, are still capable of endogenous glucose production. Blood glucose homeostasis between meals is maintained by endogenous hepatic and renal glucose production via glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis.

This complex is composed of a G6P transporter (G6PT) that transports G6P from the cytoplasm into the lumen of the ER and a G6Pase catalytic subunit that hydrolyzes the G6P to glucose. Disruption of either component disturbs glucose homeostasis and results in glycogen storage disease type Ia (GSD-Ia, G6Pase deficiency) or type Ib (GSD-Ib, G6PT deficiency). The G6PT and G6Pase activities are co-dependent (3Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat.

Despite disruption of the G6Pase complex in GSD-I patients, several studies (5Powell R.C. Wentworth S.M. Brandt I.K.

G6PT is expressed ubiquitously (8Lin B. Annabi B. Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 31656-31670Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar), but G6Pase expression is considered to be restricted to the liver, kidney, and intestine (9Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Chen H. Ward J.M. Chou J.Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1998; 358: 17-24Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar, 10Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). Therefore, we searched the ENSEMBL data base for a G6Pase homolog expressed outside of the liver, kidney, and intestine. We identified a theoretical phosphatidic acid phosphatase, PAP2.8, encoded within locus 92579 (accession number XM__045901) on chromosome 17q21.31, which, by electronic Northern, is expressed ubiquitously (11Rebhan M. Chalifa-Caspi V. Prilusky J. Lancet D. GeneCards: Encyclopedia for Genes, Proteins and Diseases. Weizmann Institute of Science, Bioinformatics Unit and Genome Center, Rehovot, Israel1997Google Scholar). Recently this protein was described by Martin et al. (12Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) as a ubiquitously expressed G6Pase catalytic subunit-related protein (UGRP) lacking phosphohydrolase activity. Human PAP2.8/UGRP is a hydrophobic protein sharing 36% amino acid sequence identity with human G6Pase. Sequence-topology alignment with G6Pase predicts that it should contain nine transmembrane helices and an active hydrolytic site lying on the luminal side of the ER (12Martin C.C. Oeser J.K.

Therefore, the reported absence of phosphohydrolase activity was unexpected. The activity assays used by Martin et al. (12Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) were performed on cell lysates in which PAP2.8/UGRP had been expressed transiently using a plasmid-based vector. We wondered whether the low level of UGRP expression in this system limited the sensitivity of the phosphohydrolase assay. In this study, we adopted a recombinant adenoviral vector-mediated expression system to increase the level of expression of PAP2.8/UGRP and enhance the sensitivity of the G6P hydrolase assay. We demonstrate that PAP2.8/UGRP is a phosphohydrolase that can couple with G6PT to form an active G6Pase complex. We now propose naming PAP2.8/UGRP as G6Pase-β, to differentiate it from the liver/kidney/intestine G6Pase that we rename G6Pase-α. Our results provide new insights into glucose homeostasis and explain why patients genetically deficient in the G6Pase-α complex are still capable of endogenous glucose production. Isolation of Human G6Pase-β cDNA and Construction of Mutants— The entire coding region of human PAP2.8/UGRP (G6Pase-β) was isolated by PCR amplification of human full-length cDNA obtained from Panomics (Redwood City, CA) using oligonucleotide primers derived from nucleotides 217–237 (5′-ATGGAGTCCACGCTGGGCGCG-3′, sense) and nucleotides 1237–1257 (5′-TCAGGAAGAGTGGATGGGCGG-3′, antisense) of homo sapiens hypothetical protein BC002494 mRNA (LOC92579; accession number XM_045901). The PCR product was cloned into the pSVL vector to generate pSVL-G6Pase-β. Human G6Pase-β containing a C-terminal FLAG peptide, DYKDDDDK, was constructed by PCR from the pSVL-G6Pase-β template, as described previously (13Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). The resulting pSVL-G6Pase-β-3FLAG was used as a template for mutant construction. The mutational primers spanned nucleotides 441–462 (R79A, AGG to GCG), nucleotides 546–567 (H114A, CAC to GCC), or nucleotides 705–726 (H167A, CAT to GCT). All constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. The human pSVL-G6Pase-α-3FLAG cDNA has been described (13Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Construction of Recombinant Adenoviral G6Pase-β—Recombinant adenoviruses containing a wild-type (Ad-G6Pase-β) or a mutant G6Pase-β were cloned by using an SfiI site and generated by the Cre-lox recombination system (16Hardy S. Kitamura M. Harris-Stansil T. Dai Y. Phipps M.L. J. Virol. 1997; 71: 1842-1849Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To remove an internal SfiI site (nucleotides 607–629) in G6Pase-β, a C618T mutation was introduced by mutational PCR. The recombinant virus was plaque-purified and amplified to produce viral stocks with titers of ∼5to10 × 109 plaque forming unit (pfu) per ml. Recombinant adenoviruses, containing human G6Pase-α (Ad-G6Pase-α) and G6PT (Ad-G6PT), have been described (17Chen L.-Y. Pan C.-J. Shieh J.-J. Chou J.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3199-3207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Expression in COS-1 Cells and Western-blot Analysis—COS-1 cells in 150-cm2 flasks were grown at 37 °C in HEPES-buffered Dulbecco's modified minimal essential medium supplemented with 4% fetal bovine serum and infected with recombinant virus. The infected cultures were used to isolate microsomes for G6P uptake analysis after incubation at 37 °C for 24 h and for phosphohydrolase and Western-blot analyses after incubation at 37 °C for 48 h. For Western blot analysis, COS-1 cell lysates were separated by electrophoresis through a 13% polyacrylamide-SDS gel, blotted onto polyvinylidene fluoride membranes (Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA), incubated either with a monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (Scientific Imaging Systems, Eastman Kodak Co.) or a polyclonal antibody against human G6Pase-α (14Ghosh A.

The antigen-antibody complex was visualized as described previously (14Ghosh A. Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Sun M.-S. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Phosphohydrolase and G6P Uptake Analyses—Phosphohydrolase activity was determined essentially as described previously (13Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Reaction mixtures (100 μl) contained 50 mm cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 10 mm G6P, and appropriate amounts of cell homogenates or microsomal preparations were incubated at either 30 °C or 37 °C for 10 min. Disrupted microsomal membranes were prepared by incubating intact microsomes in 0.2% deoxycholate for 20 min at 0 °C. Nonspecific phosphatase activity was estimated by pre-incubating disrupted microsomal preparations at pH 5 for 10 min at 37 °C to inactivate the acid-labile G6Pase-α and G6Pase-β. G6P uptake measurements were performed as described (17Chen L.-Y. Pan C.-J. Shieh J.-J. Chou J.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2002; 11: 3199-3207Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, microsomes (40 μg) were incubated in a reaction mixture (100 μl) containing 50 mm sodium cacodylate buffer, pH 6.5, 250 mm sucrose, and 0.2 mm [U-14C]G6P (50 μCi/μmol). The reaction was stopped at the appropriate time by filtering immediately through a nitrocellulose membrane (BA85, Schleicher & Schuell, Keene, NH) and washing with an ice-cold solution containing 50 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, and 250 mm sucrose. To abolish G6P uptake, microsomes permeabilized with 0.2% deoxycholate were used as negative controls. Statistical analysis using the unpaired t test was performed with the GraphPad Prism program (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA). Data are presented as the mean ± S.E. Immunofluorescence Microscopy—COS-1 cells (5 × 104/chamber) in a 2-well chambered coverglass (Nalge Nunc International Co., Naperville, IL) were transfected with 2 μg of pSVL-G6Pase-β-3FLAG or pSVL-G6Pase-α-3FLAG using SuperFect transfection reagent according to the manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). After incubation at 37 °C for 2 days, the transfected cells were fixed for 10 min at 25 °C in 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS. For intracellular staining, the cells were blocked with 2% normal horse serum in PBS for 20 min at room temperature, incubated with a monoclonal anti-FLAG antibody in PBS containing 0.1% saponin for 1 h, followed by goat fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Sigma) in PBS containing 0.1% saponin for 1 h. After washing in PBS containing 0.1% saponin, the cells were mounted with an anti-fade, water-based mounting medium (Vector Lab, Burlingame, GA) and analyzed under a laser scanning confocal fluorescence microscope (Leica TCS-4D DMIRBE, Heidelberg, Germany). Staining of the calreticulin ER marker was performed similarly using rabbit anti-calreticulin antibody (Affinity BioReagents, Golden, CO) and TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma). Excitation wavelengths of 488 (for fluorescein isothiocyanate) and 568 (for TRITC) mm were used to generate fluorescence emission in green and red, respectively. Co-localization of green fluorescent G6Pase-α or G6Pase-β and red fluorescent calretculin is reflected by yellow fluorescence. G6Pase-β Is a Phosphohydrolase—To improve the transient expression assay of G6Pase-β, we used an adenoviral-based expression system. Because an antibody against G6Pase-β is not available, we incorporated a FLAG epitope into our construct to monitor expression. This choice of protein tag was based on our previous experience that FLAG epitopes have no effect on the expression or activity of G6Pase-α (13Pan C.-J. Lei K.-J. Annabi B. Hemrika W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 6144-6148Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (149) Google Scholar). Stocks of Ad-G6Pase-β virus and Ad-G6Pase-β-3FLAG virus, a carboxyl-terminal FLAG-tagged recombinant G6Pase-β, were used to infect the monkey kidney cell line COS-1. Phosphohydrolase assays of Ad-G6Pase-β-3FLAG-infected COS-1 lysates, analyzed at the optimal conditions for the hepatic/renal/intestinal G6Pase-α (pH 6.5, 30 °C), show a dose-dependent G6P hydrolytic activity ranging from 20.8 ± 2.5 nmol/mg/min (at a multiplicity of infection of 5 pfu/cell) to 57.4 ± 4.9 nmol/mg/min (at a multiplicity of infection of 100 pfu/cell) (Fig. 1A). Ad-G6Pase-β has identical activity to the Ad-G6Pase-β-3FLAG (data not shown). In contrast to G6Pase-β, the G6Pase-α is consistently eight times more active, Ad-G6Pase-α-infected COS-1 lysates yielding 307.6 ± 27.3 and 422.8 ± 37.6 nmol/mg/min at a multiplicity of infection of 25 and 50 pfu/cell, respectively (Fig. 1A). Western analysis showed that the expression of G6Pase-β and G6Pase-α proteins correlates with enzymatic activity (Fig. 1A). Hepatic/renal/intestinal G6Pase-α has a characteristic profile of acid lability, pH and temperature dependence, and vanadate inhibition (10Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar) that differs from other phosphatases. G6Pase-β shows a similar profile. Analysis of adenoviral-directed G6Pase activity in infected COS-1 microsomes shows that like G6Pase-α, G6Pase-β is acid-labile. Incubating either Ad-G6Pase-β- or Ad-G6Pase-α-infected COS-1 microsomes at pH 5.0 for 10 min at 37 °C led to a loss of over 98% of G6P hydrolytic activity (Fig. 1B). Both G6Pase-β and G6Pase-α have a temperature-independent pH optimum of 6.5 (Fig. 2A), although the temperature optimum of each activity differs. G6Pase-α activity is similar at 30 °C and 37 °C, with an optimum at 30 °C, whereas G6Pase-β activity is significantly higher at 37 °C than at 30 °C (Fig. 2A). Under the optimal conditions defined above, the Km values for G6P hydrolysis are similar, namely 2.22 mm for G6Pase-β and 1.82 mm for G6Pase-α (Fig. 1B). However, consistent with the earlier observation, G6Pase-α has a higher Vmax for G6P (666.7 nmol/mg/min), compared with G6Pase-β (108.7 nmol/mg/min). Assuming similar efficiencies of infection and expression, G6Pase-β appears less active, possessing ∼12% of the activity of hepatic G6Pase-α (Fig. 1A). G6Pase-β is also vanadate-sensitive, but more readily inhibited than G6Pase-α, G6Pase-β showing 50% inhibition of activity at 1.4 mm vanadate compared with a [vanadate]0.5 of 3.1 mm for G6Pase-α (Fig. 2B). G6Pase-β Is Localized in the Endoplasmic Reticulum— G6Pase-α is a nine-transmembrane domain protein embedded in the ER membrane, oriented with its active site facing into the lumen (13Pan C.-J.

J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The protein contains a carboxyl-terminal KKXX motif, responsible for the retention of type I transmembrane proteins in the ER (18Jackson M.R. Nilsson T. Peterson P.A. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3153-3162Crossref PubMed Scopus (720) Google Scholar), and has a latent activity that is released upon disruption of the microsomes (10Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). In contrast, G6Pase-β lacks any apparent ER retention motif (19Sigrist C.J. Cerutti L.

To confirm the ER retention of G6Pase-β, FLAG-tagged constructs of pSVL-G6Pase-β or pSVL-G6Pase-α were transfected into COS-1 cells and visualized by double immunostaining for the FLAG-tag and ER-marker protein calreticulin (21Pozzan T. Rizzuto R. Volpe P. Meldolesi J. Physiol. Rev. 1994; 74: 595-636Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). As expected from the microsomal localization of the activities, both G6Pase-α and G6Pase-β co-localize with calreticulin (Fig. 3), confirming their retention within the ER. The Active Site Residues Are Conserved between G6Pase-β and G6Pase-α—Functional analysis of missense and codon deletion mutations in the G6Pase-α gene of GSD-Ia patients (22Shieh J.-J. Terzioglu M.

Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) has identified 43 amino acid residues essential for G6Pase catalysis (Fig. 4). Thirty-five of these residues, including three active site residues, are conserved between mammalian G6Pase-α and G6Pase-β (Fig. 4). The active site of G6Pase-α is composed of residues Arg83, His119, and His176 (14Ghosh A. Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Sun M.-S. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), and the analogous residues in G6Pase-β appear to be Arg79, His114, and His167 (Fig. 4). To demonstrate the importance of these residues in G6Pase-β, mutations known to disrupt the active site in G6Pase-α (14Ghosh A. Shieh J.-J. Pan C.-J. Sun M.-S. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 32837-32842Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar) were introduced into G6Pase-β. Mutants R79A, H114A, or H167A were constructed in Ad-G6Pase-β-3FLAG, expressed transiently in COS-1 cells, and assayed for expression by Western blot and G6P phosphohydrolase activity (Fig. 5). Each mutant is expressed as efficiently as the wild-type G6Pase-β protein but is devoid of G6P hydrolytic activity. Therefore, Arg79, His114, and His167 are components of the active site of G6Pase-β.Fig. 5G6P phosphohydrolase activity and Western blot analysis of deoxycholate-disrupted COS-1 lysates infected with wild-type and active site mutants of Ad-G6Pase-β-3FLAG. Phosphohydrolase activity was assayed at pH 6.5 and 37 °C, and the results are given as mean ± S.E.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) G6Pase-β Couples with G6PT to Form an Active G6Pase Complex—In the liver and kidney, G6P transport and hydrolysis are tightly coupled (3Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). The uptake and accumulation of G6P in the ER lumen is stimulated dramatically when G6PT and G6Pase (G6Pase-α) are co-expressed (4Hiraiwa H. Pan C.-J. Lin B. Moses S.W. Chou J.Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 5532-5536Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (138) Google Scholar). G6Pase-β demonstrates a similar functional coupling to G6PT (Fig. 6). COS-1 cells co-infected with Ad-G6PT/Ad-G6Pase-α or Ad-G6PT/Ad-G6Pase-β have identical time courses for microsomal G6P accumulation (Fig. 6A) although the maximal accumulation mediated by G6Pase-β is ∼25% of that for G6Pase-α (Fig. 6B), consistent with the decreased phosphohydrolase activity of G6Pase-β. The pH profile of the uptake activity (Fig. 6C) shows G6Pase-β has a broader pH optimum than G6Pase-α. Unlike G6P hydrolysis, increasing the assay temperature to 37 °C does not increase G6P uptake for either the G6Pase-α/G6PT or G6Pase-β/G6PT co-infected microsomes (data not shown), which is consistent with the finding that G6PT is the rate-limiting activity in the coupled G6PT/G6Pase system in vitro (10Nordlie R.C. Sukalski K.A. Martonosi A.N. The Enzymes of Biological Membranes. 2nd Ed. Plenum Press, New York1985: 349-398Crossref Google Scholar). In humans, blood glucose levels must be maintained between 70–110 mg/dl to avoid the complications of hyper- and hypoglycemia. Although insulin plays major roles in regulating blood glucose levels (23Taylor S.I. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1433-1469Google Scholar), blood glucose homeostasis between meals depends on gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. In the terminal step common to both pathways, G6P is hydrolyzed to glucose by the G6Pase complex, which is composed of a G6P transporter coupled to a G6P phosphohydrolase (1Chou J.Y. Matern D. Mansfield B.C. Chen Y.-T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar, 2Chen Y.-T. Scriver C.R. Beaudet A.L. Sly W.S. Valle D. Childs B. Kinzler K.W. Vogelstein B. The Metabolic and Molecular Bases of Inherited Disease. 8th Ed. McGraw-Hill Inc., New York2001: 1521-1551Google Scholar). Deficiencies in the G6Pase complex disrupt glucose production via gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, resulting in the metabolic disorder GSD-I, which is characterized by hypoglycemia, growth retardation, hepatomegaly, nephromegaly, hyperlipidemia, hyperuricemia, and lactic acidemia (1Chou J.Y.

Currently, only the liver, kidney, and intestine are considered to be involved in inter-prandial glucose homeostasis. This view is based on the absence of G6Pase-α, an activity essential to the final stage of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, outside of these organs. We now show that other tissues may be able to contribute to blood glucose homeostasis through the activity of PAP2.8/UGRP (11Rebhan M. Chalifa-Caspi V. Prilusky J. Lancet D. GeneCards: Encyclopedia for Genes, Proteins and Diseases. Weizmann Institute of Science, Bioinformatics Unit and Genome Center, Rehovot, Israel1997Google Scholar, 12Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), a G6Pase-related protein expressed ubiquitously, that we rename G6Pase-β. An initial report on G6Pase-β ascribed no phosphohydrolase activity to the protein (12Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). By improving the transient expression of the gene with an adenovirus-based expression system, we have demonstrated that, like the hepatic/renal/intestinal G6Pase (now renamed G6Pase-α), G6Pase-β is a G6P hydrolase. The two proteins are very similar. Unlike nonspecific phosphatases, both G6Pase-α and G6Pase-β are acid-labile. They are also inhibited readily by vanadate, although G6Pase-β shows a greater sensitivity to the inhibitor than G6Pase-α. The activities share a common pH optimum of 6.5 but differ in their temperature profiles, G6Pase-α having a broad optimum centered at 30 °C, whereas G6Pase-β has a sharper profile centered at 37 °C. Both exhibit a similar Km toward G6P, suggesting that they could play similar physiological roles in cells, but the Vmax of G6Pase-α is ∼6-fold greater than that of G6Pase-β. Changing any of the three residues critical to the active site in G6Pase-α destroys the activity of G6Pase-β, suggesting both phosphohydrolases share a similar structure in their active sites and confirming that G6Pase-β is the source of the phosphohydrolase activity being measured. To participate in the final step of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis, the hydrolysis of G6P to glucose and phosphate, a G6P hydrolase must be able to couple functionally with the ubiquitously expressed ER transmembrane protein, G6PT (1Chou J.Y. Matern D. Mansfield B.C. Chen Y.-T. Curr. Mol. Med. 2002; 2: 121-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). For this reason, nonspecific phosphatases are not able to contribute to glucose homeostasis. Both G6Pase-α and G6Pase-β are localized in the ER. When G6Pase-β is co-expressed with G6PT, the proteins couple to transport G6P from the cellular cytoplasm into the ER lumen. Although the rate of G6P accumulation mediated by the G6Pase-β/G6PT complex is ∼25% that of the G6Pase-α/G6PT complex, it is still a significant accumulation, showing a broader pH optimum but a similar temperature dependence as G6Pase-α/G6PT. Although G6Pase-β has only ∼12% of the activity of G6Pase-α, the demonstration of a significant, specific G6P hydrolytic activity that can couple to G6PT outside of the liver raises interesting questions about the ability of other tissues to cycle glucose and contribute to blood glucose homeostasis. Of particular interest is the muscle, which expresses an elevated level of G6Pase-β (12Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). Although the liver stores the most glycogen weight for weight of any tissue, about 90 g in a 70-kg male (24Baynes J.

National Academy Press, Washington, D. C.1999: 255-277Google Scholar), is the largest reservoir of body glycogen, storing about 300 g of glycogen per 70-kg male. It is interesting to speculate that some of this glycogen reservoir may be cycled into blood glucose by G6Pase-β. Without further study, it is difficult to judge how important this might be to glucose homeostasis, because in muscle, cytoplasmic G6P has multiple fates, which include hydrolysis to glucose, glycogenesis, energy production via glycolysis, entry into the pentose phosphate pathway, and lipid synthesis. Studies of G6Pase-α-deficient patients or mice (3Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) may hold interesting clues. Monitoring of GSD-Ia patients, who lack a functional G6Pase-α, clearly demonstrates that there is a significant supply of endogenous glucose production from an unknown source. Young GSD-Ia patients show significant hypoglycemia, but with age, the endogenous glucose production rate improves, starting from 50% of normal in young GSD-Ia patients to 67–100% of normal in adult GSD-Ia patients (5Powell R.C.

Because the muscle mass is only ∼20% of the body weight of a newborn but improves through adolescence (36% muscle mass) to adulthood (40–45%) (27Gallagher D. Steven B. Heymsfield S.B. Wang Z.M. The Role of Protein and Amino Acids in Sustaining and Enhancing Performance. National Academy Press, Washington, D. C.1999: 255-277Google Scholar), it is reasonable to suggest that the muscle G6Pase-β/G6PT complex may be the source of some or all of the extra blood glucose. Indeed preliminary experiments examining the G6Pase activity in muscle derived from G6Pase-α-deficient (3Lei K.-J. Chen H. Pan C.-J. Ward J.M. Mosinger B. Lee E.J. Westphal H. Chou J.Y. Nat. Genet. 1996; 13: 203-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar) and G6PT-deficient (28Chen L.-Y. Shieh J.-J. Lin B. Pan C.-J. Gao J.-L. Murphy P.M. Roe T.F. Moses S. Ward J.M. Westphal H. Lee E.J. Mansfield B.C. Chou J.Y. Hum. Mol. Genet. 2003; 12: 2547-2558Crossref PubMed Scopus (72) Google Scholar) mice are promising in this respect. 2J.-J. Shieh, C.-J. Pan, B. C. Mansfield, and J. Y. Chou, unpublished data. Because G6Pase-β is well expressed in kidney (12Martin C.C. Oeser J.K. Svitek C.A. Hunter S.I. Hutton J.C. O'Brien R.M. J. Mol. Endocrinol. 2002; 29: 205-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar), another potential source of the glucose is the kidney, although this seems less significant because the kidney weighs only ∼17% of the wet weight of the liver (25Snyder W.S. Cook M.J. Nasset E.S. Karhausen L.R. Howells G.P. Tipton I.H. Report of the Task Group on Reference Man. (International Commission on Radiological Protection, ed) Pergamon Press, Oxford1975Google Scholar) and has a significantly lower glycogen content weight for weight. Our findings with G6Pase-β challenge the current dogma of glucose homeostasis and suggest that glucose recycling through glycogen or other G6P-mediated pathways may take place in a much wider range of tissues than previously envisaged. The proof of this rests in detailed in vivo measurements of glucose recycling, which are currently in progress. The importance of such a finding depends on the physiological impact of the loss of G6Pase-β activity. We are currently addressing the physiological importance of this through the use of knock-out and over-expression mouse strains."

In this investigation, three NADPH-dependent aromatic alcohol reductases were comprehensively studied, namely pinoresinol-lariciresinol reductase (PLR), phenylcoumaran benzylic ether reductase (PCBER), and isoflavone reductase (IFR), which are involved in central steps to the various important bioactive lignans and isoflavonoids.

For example, PLRs, which catalyze reduction of the 8–8′ linked lignan pinoresinol (Scheme 1, structure1) (6.Dinkova-Kostova A.T. Gang D.R. Davin L.B. Bedgar D.L. Chu A. Lewis N.G. J. Biol.

Such lignans are considered to be metabolized in mammals into the cancer-preventing “mammalian” lignans, enterodiol (structure5) and enterolactone (structure6), with the latter metabolites being generated in the gut by the action of gastrointestinal flora such as Clostridia sp (14.Setchell K.D.R.

PLR is also an important enzymatic step in the formation of the antiviral agent podophyllotoxin (structure7) in Podophyllum species (13.Xia Z.-Q. Costa M.A. Proctor J. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G.

Other metabolites of physiological significance derived from PLR catalysis involve substances such as plicatic acid (structure11) that help ensure the durability and structural integrity of heartwood tissue, such as in Western red cedar (Thuja plicata) (17.Gang D.R.

Hassanali A. Njoroge P.W. Bentley M.D. Delle Monache F. Jondiko J.I. Insect Sci. Applic. 1985; 6: 537-541Google Scholar). Particular isoflavones, e.g. daidzein (structure15) and genistein (structure16), have also been implicated in health protection with a somewhat similar role to the lignans (19.Adlercreutz H.

For each PLR reductive step, only the 4-pro-R hydride is abstracted, indicative of a class A reductase, and when [7,7′-2H2]-pinoresinol (1) was used as substrate, both reductions occurred with an inversion of configuration at C-7/C-7′ (10.Chu A.

By comparison, in T. plicata, two distinct PLR genes were cloned (PLR_Tp1 and PLR_Tp2) whose corresponding recombinant proteins, PLR_Tp1 and PLR_Tp2, catalyzed distinct enantiospecific reductions with the (-)- and (+)- antipodes of pinoresinol (structures1b and 1a, respectively) to ultimately afford (+)- and (-)-secoisolariciresinol (structures4a and 4b; Fig. 1, A and B) (7.Fujita M.

(In all vascular plants examined thus far PLR homologs are apparently ubiquitous.) PCBER is also apparently an ubiquitous vascular plant enzyme and has been studied in both Pinus taeda and Populus trichocarpa. This 33.6-kDa protein is, in this case, capable of catalyzing in vitro the regiospecific NADPH-dependent 7–O–4′ reduction of various defense-related phenylcoumaran lignans to afford the corresponding diphenols, e.g. dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (structure12) and dihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (structure18) into isodihydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (structure19) and tetrahydrodehydrodiconiferyl alcohol (structure20), respectively (Fig. 1C) (4.Gang D.R.

PCBER shows high sequence homology to the NADPH-dependent PLRs, the IFRs, and their corresponding homologs (IFRHs); PCBER is typically ∼66% similar and ∼45% identical to PLRs and ∼65% similar and ∼50% identical to IFRs (4.Gang D.R.

Yet not only do they share high gene sequence similarity, but as described above they share similar physiological roles with their products (i.e. in plant defense) as well as apparently having comparable catalytic modes of action (4.Gang D.R.

For this reason, PCBER was proposed to be the likely progenitor of PLR and IFR because it catalyzes the more general conversion, and the other two enzymes catalyze the more specific conversions (4.Gang D.R. Kasahara H. Xia Z.-Q. Vander Mijnsbrugge K. Bauw G. Boerjan W. Van Montagu M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7516-7527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar). Furthermore, from a physiological perspective, both PCBERs and IFRs have been identified as minor allergens in various fruits and vegetables (28.Karamloo F. Wangorsch A. Kasahara H. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. Vieths S. Eur. J. Biochem. 2001; 268: 5310-5320Crossref PubMed Scopus (107) Google Scholar); the regions on the proteins that confer these allergenic responses are, however, unknown. Despite the importance of the lignans and isoflavonoids in plant biology, in human health, and in industries that use heartwoods as their main resource, systematic studies on the enzymes involved have not been done. This is because only fairly recently have several proteins, enzymes, and genes been identified in their biosynthetic pathways, and hence only now are the proteins available for structural analyses. Accordingly, there were no NMR or x-ray crystal structures available for the enzymes in 8–8′ and 8–5′ linked lignan biosynthetic pathways. In this work, we have completed the x-ray crystallographic analysis of both PLR_Tp1 and PCBER_Pt1, including using site-directed mutagenesis to probe the stereochemistry of the chiral center and reaction mechanism, to begin to address the various structural issues involved. As described below, the threedimensional x-ray crystal structures of both PLR_Tp1 and PCBER_Pt1 were solved and refined to 2.5 and 2.2 Å resolutions, respectively, the structures of which now allow incisive comparative studies to be made between the enantiospecific and regiospecific reactions of PCBER_Pt1, PLR_Tp1, and IFR. Plasmid Construction—PCBER_Pt1 was cloned into the overexpression plasmid pSBETa (29.Schenk P.M. Baumann S. Mattes R. Steinbiss H.-H. BioTechniques. 1995; 19: 196-200PubMed Google Scholar) as previously described (4.Gang D.R. Kasahara H. Xia Z.-Q. Vander Mijnsbrugge K. Bauw G. Boerjan W. Van Montagu M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7516-7527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar), and PLR_Tp1 was cloned into the same vector in a similar manner. Purification of PLR_Tp1 and PCBER_Pt1—Expression of both PLR_Tp1 and PCBER_Pt1 in Escherichia coli (B834-DE3) was individually induced by addition of isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactopyranoside to a 1 mm final concentration at mid-log phase (A600 = 0.5–0.7). Following induction the two cell lines were allowed to grow for 21 h at 23 °C for PLR_Tp1 and 10 h at 37 °C for PCBER_Pt1, respectively, with shaking at 250 rpm. The cells for each were then harvested by centrifugation (3,000 × g), after which the individual pellets were frozen (∼2 h) to facilitate cell lysis. The pellets containing PLR_Tp1 and PCBER_Pt1 were each thawed at room temperature, then individually suspended in Buffer A (20 mm Bis-Tris-propane, pH 8.0, containing 2 mm EDTA, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 5 mm dithiothreitol), and sonicated (three times for 30 s), with the resulting suspensions centrifuged (20,000 × g). The supernatant from the PLR_Tp1- and PCBER_Pt1-containing cell lines were next subjected to ammonium sulfate precipitation, with the proteins precipitating between 40 and 70% ammonium sulfate reconstituted in buffer A, followed by a desalting step over PD-10 columns (Amersham Biosciences) and then subjected to Affi-Blue gel column chromatography as described by Gang et al. (4.Gang D.R. Kasahara H. Xia Z.-Q. Vander Mijnsbrugge K. Bauw G. Boerjan W. Van Montagu M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol.

Xia Z.-Q. Vander Mijnsbrugge K. Bauw G. Boerjan W. Van Montagu M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol.

Fractions from the Affi-Blue gel column containing PLR_Tp1, as determined by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis, were combined (186 mg of protein), concentrated (4.Gang D.R. Kasahara H. Xia Z.-Q. Vander Mijnsbrugge K. Bauw G. Boerjan W. Van Montagu M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol.

The desalted protein solution was next divided into five equal aliquots that were sequentially applied to a POROS 20 HQ column (PerSeptive Biosystem) pre-equilibrated in Buffer B at a flow rate of 7 ml min-1. PLR_Tp1 did not bind to the column, and the combined fraction (95.6 mg), divided into four equal aliquots (23.9 mg × 4), was directly applied to a POROS 20 SP cation exchange column (PerSeptive Biosystem) pre-equilibrated in Buffer B at a flow rate of 10 ml min-1. Again PLR_Tp1 did not bind to the column, whereas most of the remaining E. coli contaminating proteins did. The protein solution containing PLR_Tp1 (67.25 mg) was next concentrated (4.Gang D.R. Kasahara H. Xia Z.-Q. Vander Mijnsbrugge K. Bauw G. Boerjan W. Van Montagu M. Davin L.B. Lewis N.G. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 7516-7527Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (163) Google Scholar) and desalted over a PD10 column equilibrated in buffer A. The resulting protein solution was divided into four equal aliquots that were sequentially loaded onto an ADP-agarose (Sigma) column (50 × 4.6 mm) pre-equilibrated in Buffer A at a flow rate of 2 ml min-1. After washing the column with Buffer A (16 ml), PLR_Tp1 was eluted using a linear NaCl gradient (0–2 m, 5 ml), which was then held at the 2 m NaCl concentration for another 5 ml. Fractions containing PLR_Tp1 were combined and concentrated to give a yield of ∼21 mg, whose purity was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis followed by silver staining. Analytical Ultracentrifugation—A Beckman Optima XL-A analytical ultracentrifuge equipped with absorbance optics and an An60Ti rotor was used for both sedimentation equilibrium and sedimentation velocity experiments. Sedimentation equilibrium experiments were preequilibrated (1 h) at 4 °C and performed in Epon six-channel (1.2 cm path) centerpieces at 6,000, 9,000, and 12,000 rpm monitored at 280 nm. Different PLR_Tp1 concentrations (0.2, 0.6, and 2.0 mg ml-1) were used in potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5) containing NaCl (100 mm). All of the samples were dialyzed (16 h) against the desired buffer conditions and used in the reference cells. Equilibrium profiles were analyzed with the program WinNONLIN (30.Johnson M.L. Correia J.J. Yphantis D.A. Halvorson H.R. Biophys. J. 1981; 36: 575-588Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (778) Google Scholar). Sedimentation velocity experiments were performed at 25 °C in Epon double channel centerpieces (1.2 cm path) with PLR_Tp1 concentrations of 0.2, 0.6, and 2.0 mg ml-1 and at speeds of 25,000, 30,000, and 36,000 rpm. The samples were previously dialyzed against potassium phosphate buffer (20 mm, pH 7.5) containing 100 mm NaCl for 24 h. The sedimentation velocity data were collected at 280 nm with a radial increment of 0.3 mm and a delay between scans of 800 s. Only data with a defined meniscus and plateau were analyzed by the Svedberg 5.01 (31.Philo J.S. Data Analysis Software for XL-A Sedimentation Experiments, 5.01 Ed.

Values of s and D were obtained from the relation Mw = sRT/D(1 - &̄nu;ρ), where Mw is the molecular weight (calculated from the sequence), s is the sedimentation coefficient, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature (corrected according to Durchschlag (33.Durchschlag H. Hinz H.-J. Thermodynamic Data for Biochemistry and Biotechnology.

MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—PLR_Tp1 samples were diluted to 10–20 pmol in H2O (0.4 μl) and mixed with an equal volume of a saturated (1:1 H2O:acetonitrile) solution of sinapinic acid as matrix. A Voyager DERP mass spectrometer with a PerSeptive Biosystems Voyager Biospectrometry Work station was used with data analyzed using the Data Explorer 5.1 software package. Laser fluence was about 20% above threshold, and the collected spectra were from 256 scans. Mass standards of cytochrome c (12,360 Da) and trypsinogen (23,980 Da) were used for instrument calibration. Crystallization of PLR_Tp1 and PCBER_Pt1—For crystallization, the buffer of the purified PCBER_Pt1 solution was replaced with a solution containing 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mm EDTA, 5 mm dithiothreitol, and the protein concentration was adjusted to 50 mg ml-1. Crystals of PCBER_Pt1 were grown by the vapor diffusion method, with drops ∼4 μl in size being equilibrated against a reservoir containing 30% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m sodium cacodylate and 0.2 m sodium citrate. Diffraction quality crystals usually appeared after 10 days, and larger crystals with dimensions of ∼0.5 × 0.5 × 0.3 mm were obtained after 2 weeks. Some crystals diffracted up to 2.7 Å using a fine focusing RIGAKU rotating anode x-ray generator with mirror optics at 50 kV and 100 mA. The PCBER_Pt1 crystal belongs to the monoclinic space group P21 with two molecules in an asymmetric unit (a = 66.20 Å, b = 67.94 Å, c = 75.11 Å, β = 115.09°). The native data of 2.2 Å resolution was collected from the Advanced Light Source (ALS, beam line 8.2.2) at a temperature of -170 °C. Crystals of PLR_Tp1 were also grown by the vapor diffusion method, with drops of ∼4 μl in size being equilibrated against a 0.6-ml reservoir containing 20% polyethylene glycol 8000, 0.1 m MES, pH 6.2, 0.1 m NaCl, and 0.1 m calcium acetate. Diffraction quality crystals appeared after 2 weeks, and larger crystals with dimensions of ∼0.4 × 0.3 × 0.3 mm were obtained after 4 weeks. The PLR_Tp1 crystal belongs to the orthorhombic space group P212121 with four molecules in an asymmetric unit (a = 82.574 Å, b = 125.959 Å, c = 128.578 Å). The native data of 2.5 Å resolution was collected from the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL, beam line 9-2) at a temperature of -170 °C. Structure Solution and Refinement—The structure of PCBER_Pt1 was solved by combining multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) (platinum) and multiple isomorphous replacement (MIR) (mercury) methods, and the structure of PLR_Tp1 was solved by molecular replacement using the coordinates of PCBER_Pt1. After screening 20 heavy metal compounds, two marginal quality heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals in solutions containing potassium tetrachloroplatinum and p-chloronitrop"

In the past, MurA and AroA have received attention because they are targets of the naturally occurring broad spectrum antibiotic fosfomycin (8.Kahan F.M. Kahan J.S. Cassidy P.J. Kropp H. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1974; 235: 364-386Crossref PubMed Scopus (612) Google Scholar) and the widely used herbicide glyphosate (9.Steinrucken H.C. Amrhein N. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1980; 94: 1207-1212Crossref PubMed Scopus (760) Google Scholar), respectively. Fosfomycin and glyphosate exclusively inhibit their target enzymes. Fosfomycin covalently attacks the thiol group of Cys-115 in the active site of Escherichia coli MurA (10.Marquardt J.L. Brown E.D. Lane W.S. Haley T.M. Ichikawa Y. Wong C.H. Walsh C.T.

On the other hand, no other phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)-utilizing enzyme, including MurA, is inhibited by glyphosate to any considerable extent (12.Steinrucken H.C. Amrhein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 143: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).MurA and AroA catalyze the transfer of the enolpyruvyl moiety of PEP to the 3′-OH hydroxyl group of UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UNAG) and the 5-OH hydroxyl group of shikimate 3-phosphate (S3P), respectively (Fig. 1). In this chemically unusual reaction, the C-O bond of PEP is cleaved rather than the high energy P-O bond that is typically cleaved by other PEP-utilizing enzymes. In recent years, the mechanistic kinship between MurA and AroA has been given a structural basis through the determination of a series of crystal structures (11.Skarzynski T. Mistry A. Wonacott A.

MurA (molecular weight, 44,000) and AroA (molecular weight, 46,000) exhibit the same distinct protein architecture although they share only ∼25% sequence identity. The single polypeptide chain folds into two similar globular domains, each a so-called “inside-out α/β barrel” built up by 3-fold repetition of the same βαβαββ motif. Upon binding of UNAG and S3P to MurA and AroA, respectively, the two domains approach each other, leading to the formation of the active site in the interdomain cleft (11.Skarzynski T. Mistry A.

This “induced fit” mechanism is the structural accord to the ordered substrate binding mode assessed for the enolpyruvyl transfer reaction in which UNAG or S3P interact with the free enzyme prior to the binding of PEP.The overall enolpyruvyl transfer reaction follows an addition-elimination process; the enzyme•substrates complex undergoes an enzyme intermediate state in which the two substrates are covalently linked to each other where C-2 of the PEP moiety assumes tetrahedral configuration and C-3 becomes a methyl group (Fig. 2; see Walsh et al. (21.Walsh C.T. Benson T.E. Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Chem. Biol. 1996; 3: 83-91Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (47) Google Scholar) for review). To yield the vinyl ether product, inorganic phosphate is eliminated from the tetrahedral adduct while a proton is removed from C-3, re-establishing the double bond between C-2 and C-3. Analysis of the vinyl ether products of MurA and AroA generated from stereospecifically isotope-labeled PEP has shown that the addition and elimination steps proceed with opposite stereochemistry (22.Grimshaw C.E. Sogo S.G. Copley S.D. Knowles J.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1984; 106: 2699-2700Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar, 23.Asano Y. Lee J.J. Shieh T.L. Spreafico F. Kowal C. Floss H.G. J. Am. Chem.

If the stereochemistry of the addition of the first bound substrate to C-2 of PEP and that of a proton to C-3 of PEP is anti, the elimination of H+ from C-3 and Pi from C-2 of the tetrahedral reaction intermediate has to be syn, or vice versa.Fig. 2The addition-elimination mechanism of enolpyruvyl transferases. The designations enzyme-X, enzyme-Y, and Z-enzyme stand for side chains involved in the transfer reaction. A proton is added to PEP, yielding a PEP oxocarbenium ion, while the target hydroxyl group of the first bound substrate, S1 (UNAG and S3P for MurA and AroA, respectively), gets deprotonated (A). A nucleophilic attack of the deprotonated target hydroxyl group of S1 on the C-2 atom of the PEP oxocarbenium ion (B) leads to a covalent adduct of the two substrates where the C-2 atom of the PEP moiety is in tetrahedral configuration (C). Subtraction of a proton from the methyl group at C-3 of the PEP moiety (D) results in the formation of the vinyl ether product under elimination of inorganic phosphate (E).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Despite the detailed knowledge of the active sites of both enolpyruvyl transferases, a precise comparison was not possible in the past because only a limited number of active site residues are conserved between MurA and AroA, and, moreover, some of these residues differ significantly in their spatial arrangement. In our attempt to trap reaction intermediate states of enolpyruvyl transferases, we substituted alanine for a strictly conserved aspartic acid (Asp-305 for MurA and Asp-313 for AroA) in the active site of the two enzymes and co-crystallized these mutant enzymes with substrates. Subsequent structure determination to resolutions of 2.65 and 1.6 Å revealed the tetrahedral reaction intermediate states of MurA and AroA, respectively. The chiral center at C-2 of the PEP moiety of the observed tetrahedral intermediates now gives a new reference point for the alignment of the two structures, such that different regions of the active sites of the two enzymes can be mapped according to their function in the enolpyruvyl transfer reaction. Here, we discuss the implications of the new structures for the catalytic mechanism and rational inhibitor design.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESS3P (barium salt) was a gift from Nikolaus Amrhein (ETH, Zürich, Switzerland). PEP (potassium salt) and UNAG were purchased from Sigma. Protein concentration was determined using the Pierce Coomassie reagent with bovine serum albumin as standard.The mutations D305A and D313A were introduced to wild-type Enterobacter cloacae MurA and wild-type E. coli AroA, respectively, using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit from Stratagene and appropriate primers. pET vectors 9d and 24d (Novagen) containing the open reading frame of the wild-type enzymes were used as templates for the pointmutation of MurA and AroA, respectively. D305A-MurA was overexpressed in BL21(DE3)-competent (Stratagene) E. coli cells, and D313A-AroA was overexpressed in STBL2(DE3) E. coli cells (20.Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The overexpressed proteins were purified as described (17.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Krekel F. Luger K. Amrhein N. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 2164-2173Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar, 20.Eschenburg S. Healy M.L. Priestman M.A. Lushington G.H. Schonbrunn E. Planta. 2002; 216: 129-135Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar).The mutant enzymes were concentrated to ∼100 mg/ml using Centricon 30 devices (Amicon) at 4 °C. D305A-MurA was crystallized at 19 °C from 10 mm MES (pH 6.4), 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol 20,000 in the presence of 5 mm UNAG and 5 mm PEP. D313A-AroA was crystallized at 19 °C from 4 m sodium formate in the presence of 5 mm S3P and 5 mm PEP.Diffraction data were recorded at –180 °C using the rotation method on single flash-frozen crystals of D305A-MurA (detector, an R-axis IV2+ image plate detector from MSC, The Woodlands, TX; x-rays, CuKα, focused by mirror optics, from MSC; and the generator, Rigaku RU300 from MSC) and D313A-AroA (detector, Mar 345 mm image plate detector from X-ray Research, Norderstedt, Germany; x-rays, CuKα, focused by mirror optics, from MSC; and the generator, Rigaku RU300 from MSC). The MurA data were reduced with HKL suite (25.Otwinowski Z. Minor W. Carter Jr., C.W. Sweet R.M. Methods in Enzymology: Macromolecular Crystallography Part A. Vol. 276. Academic Press, New York1997: 307-326Google Scholar) and the AroA data with XDS (26.Kabsch W. J. Appl. Crystallogr. 1993; 26: 795-800Crossref Scopus (3214) Google Scholar). For phasing and refinement, the program package CNS (27.Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M.

Cowan S.W. Kjeldgaard M. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. A. 1991; 47: 110-119Crossref PubMed Scopus (13004) Google Scholar).The structures have been solved by molecular replacement. For liganded D313A-AroA, the structure of the binary AroA•S3P complex (19.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

A tetramer of MurA molecules derived from another oligomeric crystal form of liganded MurA 2S. Eschenburg and E. Schönbrunn, unpublished data. stripped of solvent molecules and ligands served as search model for liganded D305A-MurA. In the cross-rotation and translation search, diffraction data have been limited to low-resolution reflections 20.0–6.0 Å. From the 30 highest peaks of the cross-rotation function, four solutions could be successfully translated into the asymmetric unit of the crystal, revealing that the asymmetric unit contains four tetramers of MurA molecules. Independent rigid body refinement of the 16 MurA molecules in the asymmetric unit lowered the initial Rfree of 48.5 to 33.4%.Refinement was performed using data for the highest resolution with no σ cut-off applied. Most of the protein regions of D305A-MurA were constrained, exploiting the non-crystallographic symmetry between the 16 molecules except for the active site and intermolecular contact regions. Solvent molecules were added to the models at chemically reasonable positions. The tetrahedral adducts were modeled according to the clear electron density map and, in the case of D305A-MurA, left excluded from non-crystallographic symmetry constraints throughout the refinement. Residue 67 of each of the 16 D305A-MurA molecules has been modeled as isoaspartate (16.Eschenburg S. Schonbrunn E. Proteins. 2000; 40: 290-298Crossref PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar).

Subsequent structure determination to resolutions of 2.65 (MurA) and 1.6 Å (AroA) revealed the tetrahedral reaction intermediate states of the enzymes (Figs. 3, 4, and 5), which, in the following discussion, are denoted MurA•THI and AroA•THI, respectively. Both enzymes are in the closed conformation observed previously for liganded MurA (11.Skarzynski T. Mistry A. Wonacott A. Hutchinson S.E. Kelly V.A. Duncan K.

Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and liganded AroA (19.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar) (Fig. 3). The root mean square deviation is 0.6 Å between 418 equivalent pairs of Cα atoms of E. coli C115A-MurA liganded with a fluorinated tetrahedral intermediate analog (Protein Data Bank entry 1A2N; Ref. 15.Skarzynski T. Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Walsh C.T. Duncan K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar) and of MurA•THI, where the largest differences occur in the backbone around residues 82–88 and residues 112–119. Comparing AroA•THI with the structure of the binary AroA•S3P complex (Protein Data Bank entry code 1G6T; Ref. 19.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), the root mean square deviation is only 0.12 Å between the Cα atoms 1–427 of AroA. Apparently, formation of the tetrahedral intermediates does not perturb the overall structure of the closed enzymes.Fig. 5Comparison of the tetrahedral intermediate states of the enolpyruvyl transfer reactions in D305A-MurA and D313A-AroA.Top stereo pair, active site of MurA.

Bottom stereo pair, superposition of the active sites of MurA (reddish colors, magenta labels) and AroA (greenish colors, blue labels), with the chiral center at the C-2 atom of PEP as reference.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Using the tetrahedral PEP C-2 as center of reference, it is now possible to superimpose both active sites precisely. The MurA•THI and AroA•THI complexes reveal a set of strictly conserved charged residues that interact with the PEP moiety of the tetrahedral adduct (Figs. 4 and 5). These are residues Lys-22, Arg-120, Arg-331, and Arg-371 in MurA, which correspond to Lys-22, Arg-124, Arg-344, and Arg-386, respectively, in AroA. The charged side chains of these residues appear to be responsible for PEP binding and enolpyruvyl transfer. Notably, all binding partners of the PEP moiety of the intermediate state are identical with those of the herbicide glyphosate in AroA (19.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar), corroborating earlier suggestions that glyphosate and PEP target the same binding site and that the AroA•S3P•glyphosate complex indeed mimics an intermediate state of the AroA reaction (12.Steinrucken H.C. Amrhein N. Eur. J. Biochem. 1984; 143: 351-357Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar, 19.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl.

Although the charged residues listed above execute principally identical interactions with the PEP moiety of the tetrahedral adducts and even adopt similar side-chain conformations in MurA and AroA, the PEP binding site is significantly distorted between the two enolpyruvyl transferases. The distortion becomes obvious by superimposing the two enzyme structures with the chiral centers of the PEP C-2 atom of the tetrahedral adducts as reference (Fig. 5, bottom). Although residue 305/313 and the guanidinium group of Arg-371/Arg-386 overlay within the coordinate error, Lys-22, Arg-120/Arg-124, and Arg-331/Arg-344 are set-off by up to 2.0 Å.In addition to these geometrical deviations, the PEP binding sites of MurA and AroA differ in four residues, which exclusively occur in AroA or MurA. Arg-397, which is strictly conserved in MurA, corresponds to Lys-411 in AroA. Because this replacement is conservative in charge and side-chain length, the salt-bridge to the phosphate group of the PEP-moiety is preserved. A more radical difference is the existence of Glu-341 of AroA versus Cys-115 of MurA, which have been implicated as participating in the proton transfer toward and from PEP during catalysis (15.Skarzynski T. Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Walsh C.T. Duncan K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 19.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar). One of the carboxyl oxygen atoms of Glu-341 is in hydrogen-bonding distance to the enol oxygen atom of the PEP moiety, the ϵ-amino group of Lys-411, and one of the endocyclic nitrogen atoms of His-385. It has been suggested previously that Glu-341 could act as a donor for the initial protonation of the C-3 atom of PEP and could stabilize the positive charge developing at the C-2 of PEP in the addition step of the AroA reaction (19.Schonbrunn E. Eschenburg S. Shuttleworth W.A. Schloss J.V. Amrhein N. Evans J.N. Kabsch W. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 98: 1376-1380Crossref PubMed Scopus (380) Google Scholar, 33.Mizyed S. Wright J.E. Byczynski B. Berti P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6986-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar). Moreover, Glu-341 has recently been proposed to also act as the active site base in the elimination step (33.Mizyed S. Wright J.E. Byczynski B. Berti P.J. Biochemistry. 2003; 42: 6986-6995Crossref PubMed Scopus (29) Google Scholar), deprotonating the C-3 methyl group of the tetrahedral intermediate in the forward breakdown to the vinyl ether product. A similar dual function has been promoted for Cys-115 in the MurA reaction (15.Skarzynski T. Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Walsh C.T. Duncan K. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 2572-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 34.Kim D.H. Lees W.J. Kempsell K.E. Lane W.S. Duncan K. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1996; 35: 4923-4928Crossref PubMed Scopus (153) Google Scholar). From the crystal structures presented here, the distances between the C-3 atom of the respective tetrahedral intermediate and the functional groups of the two residues can be measured as 3.4 Å to the closest carboxyl oxygen atom of Glu-341 and 7.0 Å to the sulfhydryl group of Cys-115. Apparently, both residues are too remote from the methyl group at C-3 to act as general acid base catalysts in the MurA reaction.The binding sites for the first substrates differ substantially in size and structure, accounting for the discrepancy between UNAG and S3P in size, shape, polarity, and charge. In AroA, all polar or charged groups of the S3P moiety are in direct interaction with side chains of the enzyme (Fig. 5, middle). The hydrophobic cyclohexene ring of the S3P moiety is held in place through stacked interaction with Tyr-200. Conversely, in MurA, 8 of 11 polar or charged atoms of the UNAG moiety are coordinated through the main chain of the enzyme, either directly or via solvent molecules (Fig. 5, top). Two moderately hydrophobic environments stabilize the orientation of the hexose ring of UNAG pointing toward"

Expression of these family members can be detected at low levels in many tissues but they are expressed at very high levels when cells are stimulated by outside signals, including serum, nerve growth factor, and receptor engagement. Introduction of a dominant negative Nur77 protein that blocks the activities of all family members led to inhibition of apoptosis in T cells. Nur77-deficient mice, however, exhibit no phenotype, and a line of Nor-1 mutant mice was reported to exhibit a mild ear development phenotype but no other gross abnormalities. Here, we report the generation of Nor-1-deficient mice with a block in early embryonic development. Nor-1 is expressed early during embryogenesis, and its loss leads to embryonic lethality around embryonic day 8.5 of gestation. The mutant embryos fail to complete gastrulation and display distinct morphological abnormalities, including a decrease in overall size, developmental delay and an accumulation of mesoderm in the primitive streak during gastrulation. Abnormal expression of a number of early developmental markers and defects in growth or distribution of emerging mesoderm cells were also detected. These data suggest that Nor-1 plays a crucial role in gastrulation.

It belongs to the Nur77 subfamily that includes two other members, Nur77 (NGFI-B, TR3, Nr4a1) and Nurr1 (TINUR, NOT, Nr4a2) (1Milbrandt J.

All three molecules in this subfamily share greater that 97% homology in their DNA binding domains, which consist of two zinc fingers and a domain termed the A box. The homologies in the N-terminal transactivation domains and the C-terminal “ligand binding domains” are 37–53% and 53–77%, respectively. In the absence of any ligand, all three can bind and activate the NGFI-B-responsive DNA element characterized by the sequence AAAGGTCA (5Wilson T.E. Fahrner T.J. Johnston M. Milbrandt J. Science. 1991; 252: 1296-1300Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar). In the presence of retinoic acid, however, Nur77 and Nurr1 but not Nor-1 can heterodimerize with the retinoid X receptor and regulate a DNA element composed of direct repeats separated by five nucleotides (DR5) (6Mangelsdorf D.J.

The Nur77 family has been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes and is activated as an immediate early gene in response to diverse signals, including serum induction of fibroblast cells, apoptotic stimulation of T cells and neuronal differentiation of PC12 cells (9Winoto A. Littman D.R. Cell. 2002; 109: S57-S66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Constitutive expression of Nurr1 can be found in the ventral midbrain in the dopaminergic neuronal region whereas Nur77 and Nor-1 can be found in the adrenal gland and thymus and at low levels in many tissues (10Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L. Mitsiadis T. Olson L. Perlmann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Nurr1-deficient mice die immediately after birth and lack dopamine-producing neurons (11Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L. Jansson L. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Perlmann T. Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). In contrast, Nur77-deficient and a reported strain of Nor-1-deficient mice exhibit minimal phenotypes (12Lee S.L.

During fetal development in th mouse, Nurr1 and Nor-1 are expressed earlier than Nur77 whose expression is not detected until E16.5, 1The abbreviations used are: Eembryonic dayESembryonic stemdpcdays post coitum. suggesting that they might also play a role in early development (10Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L. Mitsiadis T. Olson L. Perlmann T. Mol. Endocrinol. 1996; 10: 1656-1666Crossref PubMed Scopus (209) Google Scholar). Expression of Nor-1 can be detected as early as day 7 of gestation (17Maltais A. Labelle Y. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). At day 6.5, the mouse embryos consist of just two germ layers, the epiblast (primitive ectoderm) and hypoblast (primitive endoderm). Gastrulation begins at around day 6.5 and is complete by day 9.0 of gestation and involves the establishment of a new germ layer, the mesoderm (18Tam P.P. Beddington R.S. Ciba Found. Symp. 1992; 165: 27-41PubMed Google Scholar, 19Tam P.P. Behringer R.R. Mech. Dev. 1997; 68: 3-25Crossref PubMed Scopus (424) Google Scholar, 20Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Cell. 1999; 96: 195-209Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (609) Google Scholar). At this time, cells at the proximal region of epiblast undergo an epithelial to mesenchymal transition, delaminate and move toward the primitive streak, which forms the future posterior region of the embryo. This movement is necessary for the proper allocation of mesodermal cells as well as for the establishment of the definitive endoderm, which gives rise to the gut and its associated organs. As cells leave the streak, they differentiate to give rise to different mesodermal derivatives. Lateral mesoderm will eventually become heart and cranial neuroectoderm, paraxial mesoderm will become somites, muscles, and bones, whereas axial mesoderm, the most anterior of the mesoderm, gives rise to the notochord. As development progresses, cell-cell interactions between all three germ layers are important for proper tissue patterning, thus the inability to migrate into or exit the streak can lead to defects in patterning as well as tissue formation and deleteriously affect embryonic growth and development. A number of molecules have been found that can affect these cell movements. Here we describe the involvement of another molecule, Nor-1, that is necessary for cell migration during gastrulation. We have generated a line of Nor-1-deficient mice by deleting a portion (37%) of its N-terminal transactivation domain and the first zinc finger domain. In contrast to the previous published report, we found no viable Nor-1-/- mutant mice were born. Study of embryos from Nor-1+/- inter-crosses showed that Nor-1-/- embryos die between 8.5 and 9.5 days of gestation. Analysis of these and embryos earlier in development indicated that gastrulation is impaired in the absence of Nor-1. Our study of Nor-1-deficient mice reveals that Nor-1 causes accumulation of cells within the primitive streak, preventing further development and eventually leading to early lethality. Thus, Nor-1 function is essential for mouse gastrulation. embryonic day embryonic stem days post coitum. Generation of Nor-1-deficient Mice—Cosmid clones of the Nor-1 locus from the 129/Sv strain of mouse were isolated from a genomic library provided by M. Koshland (University of California, Berkeley, CA). The parental targeting vector was made by cloning the neomycin resistant gene flanked by loxP sites into pSP72 (pSPloxpneo). The gene targeting construct was generated by subcloning a 4-kb KpnI genomic fragment into the KpnI site of pSPloxpneo, and a 2.2-kb EcoRV/NheI fragment into a blunted HindIII site. The construct was linearized and electroporated into J1 embryonic stem (ES) cells using previously described protocols (21Ramirez-Solis R. Davis A.C. Bradley A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 855-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). Drug resistant colonies were isolated and screened by Southern blot analysis. DNA samples were digested with XbaI, then probed using a 0.7-kb genomic fragment external to the targeting vector. Three correctly targeted clones were isolated from 288 colonies screened. ES cell injection into C57BL/6 blastocysts was performed according to standard procedures at the UC Berkeley pathogen-free facility. Genotyping—F1 progeny were screened by Southern blotting as described above. Subsequent offspring and embryos were genotyped by PCR using primers specific for the deleted region of exon 3 (Nor1wt5p-8, 5′-TAC TCA GGC TTG TGT AGC GAT G and Nor-1wt3p-8, 5′-CCC AAA TCC TGG CAC CCA ATC) to test for the presence of the wild type allele and a neo primer in conjunction with a primer 3′ of exon 3 (Nor1wt3p-2, 5′-AAG GAA GAA AAG GGG GAG GC and MC1NEOR, 5′-GAG AGG CTT TTT GCT TCC TCT TGC) to test for the targeted allele. The resulting products were separated on a 1.0% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. For genotyping of early stage embryos, either a portion of the extraembryonic region (6.5–7.5 dpc) or part of the yolk sac (8.0–9.5 dpc) was lysed in 20 μl lysis buffer (10 mm Tris, pH 8.0, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 0.45% Nonidet P-40, 0.45% Tween 20, 2 μg/ml proteinase K). A 1-μl aliquot was subjected to PCR amplification using the primers specified above. Histology—Whole deciduas were fixed and embedded in paraffin as described previously (22Ramalho-Santos M. Melton D.A. McMahon A.P. Development. 2000; 127: 2763-2772Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Serial 6 μm transverse or sagittal sections were fixed onto glass slides and stained with hematoxylin and eosin as described previously (22Ramalho-Santos M. Melton D.A. McMahon A.P.

Generation of Nor-1-deficient Mice—The Nor-1 gene in mouse ES cells was disrupted using standard techniques (21Ramirez-Solis R. Davis A.C. Bradley A. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 225: 855-878Crossref PubMed Scopus (270) Google Scholar). A region containing the transactivation domain and a portion of the DNA binding domain in the 3rd exon (the first coding exon) was deleted by homologous recombination (Fig. 1A). This corresponds to deletion of amino acids 182 to 318 (the DNA binding domain encompasses amino acids 291–380) and a loss of 37% of the transactivation region and the first zinc finger. Out of 288 colonies screened by Southern blot analysis, three G418-resistant ES cells were found to contain the targeted Nor-1 locus (Fig. 1B). They were used to generate Nor-1+/- mice. Nor-1 heterozygous mice were inter-crossed and typed by Southern blotting and PCR (Fig. 1C). The Nor-1 knockout allele was further confirmed by PCR and sequencing analysis of both 5′ and 3′ ends (data not shown). Previous work using Northern blot analysis indicated that Nor-1 is expressed as early as 7.5 dpc (17Maltais A. Labelle Y. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). We confirmed this by whole mount in situ hybridization. Embryos at 7.5 dpc appear to have ubiquitous expression of Nor-1, whereas by 9 and 9.5 dpc, expression is restricted to the brain (Fig. 1D). Targeted Disruption of the Nor-1 Gene Leads to Embryonic Lethality—Initial observations indicated that Nor-1+/- mice were phenotypically normal and fertile and appeared indistinguishable from their wild type littermates. To our surprise, however, genotyping of offspring from Nor-1+/- inter-crosses indicated that no viable Nor-1-/- mice were found among 269 mice analyzed (Table I). This data indicated that homozygosity for the Nor-1 mutation caused embryonic lethality. Interestingly, these data also showed that lower than expected numbers of heterozygous offspring were produced, as the ratio of wild type to Nor-1+/- mice was close to 1:1 instead of the expected 1:2. The Chi square test showed a value of 44.07 (X2 = Σ (observed value-expected value)2/expected value = (141–89.67)2/89.67 + (128–179.33)2/179.33 = 44.07). This was larger than the 0.01 probability level of 6.64 (for degree of freedom, df = 1). Thus, the observed numbers of wild type to Nor-1 heterozygous offspring were statistically significantly different from the expected 1 to 2 ratio. This data suggests that partial loss of Nor-1 may also cause embryos lethality at some frequency (Table I).Table IGenotyping data of embryos obtained from Nor-1+/- × Nor-1+/-matingsAge+/++/--/-Not typedNumbers of littersTotal number of animalsE6.5/7.01628916aLost during manipulation1069E7.533561111aLost during manipulation/4bResorbed tissues14115E8.5174444bResorbed tissues965>E9.55802bResorbed tissues215After birth141128037269a Lost during manipulationb Resorbed tissues Open table in a new tab To determine the age of embryonic death, we first analyzed embryonic day 3.5 blastocysts from Nor-1+/- heterozygous inter-crosses. Blastocysts from Nor-1+/- inter-crosses cultured for 3, 4, and 5 days resulted in development of trophoblasts as well as inner cell mass with no differences observed between the wild type and Nor-1-deficient cells (data not shown). Therefore loss of Nor-1 does not appear to affect pre-implantation events. We then examined embryos at later days of gestation. For PCR genotyping, genomic DNA was isolated either from a portion of the extraembryonic region of E6.5–7.5 embryos, or from the yolk sac of E8.5 embryos. At E6.5, homozygous mutant embryos were recovered at approximately Mendelian ratios and appeared morphologically normal (Table I and Fig. 2A). At E7.5, embryos with distinct morphological abnormalities were readily observed. The most severely affected class were greatly reduced in size as compared with their wild type littermates. By E8.5, degenerating or resorbed embryos were frequently seen (Fig. 2B and data not shown). The smaller, morphologically abnormal embryos at E7.5 were found to be Nor-1-/-. Interestingly, at E8.5, in addition to the resorbing homozygous mutant embryos, there were embryos exhibiting a developmentally delayed phenotype. These embryos looked phenotypically like E7.75 embryos and were not only smaller but appeared to have abnormal morphology (Fig. 2B, broken arrows). Embryos in this category appeared to have formed neural folds but had underdeveloped trunk regions. Genotyping of these embryos indicated that they were Nor-1+/-. This is consistent with the earlier findings (Table I) that heterozygosity at the Nor-1 locus may cause lethality at some low frequency. To confirm that the Nor-1 mutation leads to loss of Nor-1 expression, which then results in the mutant phenotype, in situ hybridization was performed on paraffin embedded sections of Nor-1+/- inter-cross E7.5 embryos using Nor-1 antisense probe. Morphologically mutant embryos showed an absence of Nor-1 staining as compared with the wild type embryos (Fig. 2C), thus deletion of the 1st coding exon of Nor-1 leads to absence of Nor-1 transcription, which correlates with the abnormal phenotype seen in E7.5 and E8.5 embryos from Nor-1+/- inter-crosses. Marker Analysis Reveals that Nor-1-/- Embryos Fail to Produce Anterior Mesoderm—To further characterize the defect of the Nor-1-/- mice, embryos isolated at 6.5–8.5 dpc were subjected to whole mount in situ hybridization analysis. Hybridization probes corresponding to a number of different developmental markers were used (note: experiments with each marker were done at least three times with similar results). Brachyury is a transcription factor that belongs to the Tbox family of molecules (29Beddington R.S. Rashbass P. Wilson V. Dev. Suppl. 1992; : 157-165PubMed Google Scholar, 30Kispert A. Herrmann B.G. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3211-3220Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar, 31Kispert A. Koschorz B. Herrmann B.G. EMBO J. 1995; 14: 4763-4772Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar, 32Wilson V. Manson L. Skarnes W.C. Beddington R.S. Development. 1995; 121: 877-886PubMed Google Scholar). At the onset of gastrulation, Brachyury is expressed at the junction of the embryonic/extraembryonic region and eventually moves to one side of the embryo marking the future posterior. Brachyury expression continues along the proximal-distal axis marking the migration of the primitive streak. Normal Brachyury expression in Nor-1+/- embryos indicated that primitive streak formation did occur, and thus mesoderm was being made despite the decreased size of the embryo (Fig. 3, a–c). Fgf8 is another gene known to be important in early gastrulation events. Fgf8 is a secreted growth factor whose expression in the mouse embryo correlates with the production and movement of mesoderm (24Crossley P.H. Martin G.R. Development. 1995; 121: 439-451PubMed Google Scholar, 33Sun X. Meyers E.N. Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1834-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Fgf8 expression is seen at the onset of gastrulation at E6.5, at the prospective proximal posterior region of the embryo. Similar to Brachyury, Fgf8 expression is found in early primitive streak and is maintained as the streak moves anteriorly toward the prospective node. Our in situ analysis of Nor-1 mutant embryos shows that Fgf8 expression can be detected but appears to be expanded somewhat, indicating possible disregulation of fgf8 expression when Nor-1 is absent (Fig. 3, d–f). We also examined the expression profile of Tbx6, another member of the T-box family of transcription factors. Tbx6 is known to be expressed in the primitive streak, paraxial, and axial mesoderm but not in the node (27Chapman D.L. Agulnik I. Hancock S. Silver L.M. Papaioannou V.E. Dev. Biol. 1996; 180: 534-542Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 34Chapman D.L. Papaioannou V.E. Nature. 1998; 391: 695-697Crossref PubMed Scopus (341) Google Scholar). Wild type embryos show Tbx6 staining extending along the entire length of the primitive streak toward the distal tip of the embryo. Staining of Nor-1-/- embryos, however, shows that Tbx6 expression is absent in the distal portions of the embryo as compared with the wild type littermate (Fig. 3, g–i). These expression profiles suggest that anterior and lateral movement of mesoderm do occur in the absence of Nor-1, but abnormal expression of Tbx6 suggests a delayed formation of anterior mesoderm. Formation of the primitive streak is one of the earliest events in gastrulation, followed by the movement of cells to the distal portion of the embryo culminating in the formation of the structure known as the node, or the organizer. Transplantation experiments in mouse have shown that the node is capable of secondary axis formation (35Beddington R.S. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1982; 69: 265-285PubMed Google Scholar, 36Beddington R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 613-620PubMed Google Scholar). In our studies of Nor-1 mutant mice we looked at expression patterns of a number of markers for the node to determine whether this structure is made. As the organizer is a derivative of the migrating mesoderm, and because the Nor-1 mutants appear to be deficient in anterior mesoderm it was important to ascertain whether the Nor-1 mutants were capable of generating this structure. We tested a number of known markers of the node, including Lim1, Hnf3b, and noggin. Lim1 is a homeodomain containing protein, loss of which leads to embryonic lethality and dramatic defects in head formation (26Shawlot W. Behringer R.R. Nature. 1995; 374: 425-430Crossref PubMed Scopus (675) Google Scholar, 37Shawlot W. Wakamiya M. Kwan K.M. Kania A. Jessell T.M. Behringer R.R. Development. 1999; 126: 4925-4932PubMed Google Scholar) as well as gastrulation. In wild type embryos, lim1 antisense probe stains most of the anterior primitive streak-derived tissues but is down-regulated after E7.5 (38Barnes J.D. Crosby J.L. Jones C.M. Wright C.V. Hogan B.L. Dev. Biol. 1994; 161: 168-178Crossref PubMed Scopus (201) Google Scholar), with expression limited to the periphery of the node (Fig. 4a). In the retarded Nor-1-deficient embryo, there is staining of the distal tip of the embryo, but the faint staining of the lateral mesoderm seen in wild type embryo is absent (Fig. 4b). Interestingly, a broad staining pattern can be seen for Nor-1+/- embryo (Fig. 4c), suggesting a late developmental progress of these embryos or perhaps altered distribution of lateral mesoderm. Additional future studies are needed to clarify this issue. Hnf3β, a forkhead domain protein, is also known to be important for formation of the node and specification of axial mesoderm (28Ang S.L. Wierda A. Wong D. Stevens K.A. Cascio S. Rossant J. Zaret K.S. Development. 1993; 119: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sasaki H. Hogan B.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 40Sasaki H. Hogan B.L. Development. 1993; 118: 47-59Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 41Ang S.L. Rossant J. Cell. 1994; 78: 561-574Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (878) Google Scholar). Its expression can be found in the node at E7.5 (28Ang S.L. Wierda A. Wong D. Stevens K.A. Cascio S. Rossant J. Zaret K.S. Development. 1993; 119: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 39Sasaki H. Hogan B.L. Cell. 1994; 76: 103-115Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (273) Google Scholar, 40Sasaki H.

Nor-1-/- embryos do show some staining of HNF3β in the node but is largely absent in the anterior mesoderm (Fig 4e). This is also true in more severely affected embryos (Fig. 4g). Staining with Sonic Hedgehog, another marker for axial mesoderm, revealed similar findings (data not shown). The anterior visceral endoderm is also important for patterning of the mouse embryo and is involved in restriction of posterior signals (42Perea-Gomez A. Lawson K.A. Rhinn M. Zakin L. Brulet P. Mazan S. Ang S.L. Development. 2001; 128: 753-765Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Otx2 mutant mice are embryonic lethal at the time of gastrulation and also show defects in head formation (28Ang S.L. Wierda A. Wong D. Stevens K.A. Cascio S. Rossant J. Zaret K.S. Development. 1993; 119: 1301-1315Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 35Beddington R.S. J. Embryol. Exp. Morphol. 1982; 69: 265-285PubMed Google Scholar, 36Beddington R.S. Development. 1994; 120: 613-620PubMed Google Scholar). Otx2 expression, however, appeared unaffected in the Nor-1-/- mutant (data not shown), suggesting that Nor-1 defects are not due to loss of the anterior visceral endoderm function. These data suggest that Nor-1 function is necessary for the formation of normal anterior mesoderm and its derivatives. Nor-1-deficient Embryos Exhibit Defects of Cell Migration during Gastrulation—Cell movement during gastrulation is very important for proper development of the embryo, such that abnormal or defective migration often leads to early lethality. The molecular aspects of this process have been investigated by a number of different groups, and several key molecules have been identified. One molecule previously mentioned is Fgf8. Loss of Fgf8 leads to lethality at E8.5. These mutants exhibit an accumulation of mesoderm at the proximal posterior region of the streak (33Sun X. Meyers E.N. Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1834-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar) and are unable to form anterior mesoderm. Another gene shown to be involved in this process is the embryonic ectoderm development gene (eed). Loss of function mutation of eed in mice shows an increase in the production of extra embryonic mesoderm at the expense of embryonic anterior mesoderm (43Faust C. Schumacher A. Holdener B. Magnuson T. Development. 1995; 121: 273-285PubMed Google Scholar). Data from this study suggests that the Nor-1 gene may also play a role in distribution of early mesodermal cells within the streak. Hematoxylin and eosin staining of paraffin-embedded serial transverse sections of 7.0 dpc Nor-1+/- inter-cross embryos shows that loss of Nor-1 leads to abnormal distribution of the mesoderm. Accumulation of cells at the proximal posterior of the epiblast can be seen in Nor-1-deficient embryos, leading to a narrowing of the cavity within the embryo (compare Fig. 5, a–c with d–i). Sagittal sections of Nor-1 mutant embryos also show the accumulation of mesoderm midway along the proximal-distal axis in the primitive streak (Fig. 5, j and k). In some cases, allocation of mesoderm seems irregular, such that one side of the embryo appears to preferentially have more mesoderm than the other (Fig. 5l). This accumulation of mesoderm is strikingly similar to that seen in fgf8-null embryos, whereby embryos appear to make nascent mesoderm; however, these newly formed cells are not distributed normally or not able to migrate efficiently away from the streak. Alternatively, there might be abnormal growth of the mesodermal cells. Among the three Nur77 family members, Nur77 has been studied extensively for its role in T cell apoptosis (9Winoto A. Littman D.R. Cell. 2002; 109: S57-S66Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Constitutive or over-expression of Nur77 in thymocytes or several non-lymphoid cell lines leads to apoptosis. In addition, expression of a Nur77 dominant negative protein in T cells can inhibit apoptosis accompanying T cell selection (14Calnan B. Szychowski S. Chan F.K.M. Cado D. Winoto A. Immunity. 1995; 3: 273-282Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (282) Google Scholar, 15Zhou T. Cheng J. Yang P. Wang Z. Liu C. Su X. Bluethmann H. Mountz J.D. J. Exp. Med. 1996; 183: 1879-1892Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar). However, Nur77-deficient mice exhibit no phenotype (12Lee S.L. Wesselschmidt R.L. Linette G.P. Kanagawa O. Russell J.H. Milbrandt J. Science. 1995; 269: 532-535Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar). This is in contrast to mice with Nurr1 deficiency. Its absence results in the loss of dopamine-producing neurons and early post-natal lethality (11Zetterstrom R.H. Solomin L. Jansson L. Hoffer B.J. Olson L. Perlmann T. Science. 1997; 276: 248-250Crossref PubMed Scopus (935) Google Scholar). Although Nurr1 does not seem to play a role in T cells, the expression profile of Nor-1 mimics that of Nur77 during T cell activation and constitutive expression of Nor-1 in T cells leads to cell death (16Cheng L.E. Chan F.K. Cado D. Winoto A. EMBO J. 1997; 16: 1865-1875Crossref PubMed Scopus (276) Google Scholar). Nor-1 has also been implicated as a gene translocated in human chondrosarcomas (44Labelle Y. Bussieres J. Courjal F. Goldring M.B. Oncogene. 1999; 18: 3303-3308Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). The precise role of Nor-1 in other physiological settings is not clear as in T cells but may play redundant roles with Nur77 in some situations. We show here that Nor-1 is expressed early during mouse development and is essential for the gastrulation process. Previously described mutation of the Nor-1 gene locus leads to viable homozygous animals with only a minor problem in inner ear development (13Ponnio T. Burton Q. Pereira F.A. Wu D.K. Conneely O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar). This is in stark contrast to our Nor-1-deficient mice, where homozygous animals die in utero. Our Nor-1-deficient mice were generated by deleting a large portion of the transactivation domain, and the first zinc finger domain of Nor-1. We've shown that Nor-1 expression is abolished in the homozygous Nor-1 mutant embryos (Fig. 2C) and thus the loss of portion of the 1st coding exon results in a complete null phenotype. In contrast, the published Nor-1 mutant mice were generated by inserting a β-galactosidase and a promoter driving the neomycin gene into the 1st coding exon (13Ponnio T. Burton Q. Pereira F.A. Wu D.K. Conneely O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 2002; 22: 935-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar), deleting only 19 amino acids of the Nor-1 transactivation domain (amino acids 212–231). As Nor-1 expression was not assessed in these mice, it is not clear if this mutation resulted in a complete loss of Nor-1 expression. Exon skipping and/or utilization of cryptic splice sites in the Nor-1 mutant locus could lead to production of a cryptic mutant protein and a potentially hypomorphic Nor-1 phenotype. The process of gastrulation marks the beginning of the regionalization of the embryo and establishes the primary axis on which the embryo will establish the foundation for organogenesis and various tissue systems. Before gastrulation, the embryo exists as a symmetrical cylinder. However, gene expression studies have revealed that prior to gastrulation, around E6.0, a number of genes exhibit asymmetrical expression marking the site of the future anterior region of the embryo, which gives rise to the head structures (reviewed in Ref. 45Beddington R.S. Robertson E.J. Trends Genet. 1998; 14: 277-284Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (254) Google Scholar). Gastrulation then begins with the formation and extension of the primitive streak, which initiates the morphological changes that give rise to the third germ layer, the mesoderm. Our whole mount data as well as Northern analysis of Nor-1 gene expression (17Maltais A. Labelle Y. DNA Cell Biol. 2000; 19: 121-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) indicate that Nor-1 gene expression can be seen as early as 7.0 dpc, just after the onset of gastrulation. Analysis of otx2 and bmp4 gene expression at 6.0 dpc (data not shown) in Nor-1-/- embryos indicated that they are normal. Furthermore, no differences in morphology between wild type and Nor-1 mutants can be seen before 7.0 dpc, suggesting that Nor-1 deficiency has little to no impact on mouse development before the onset of gastrulation. Our investigation of the role of Nor-1 in mouse development suggests an important function for Nor-1 in the allocation of mesoderm. Nor-1 mutant embryos are able to initiate gastrulation and form the primitive streak, but fail to complete this process due to the inability of the newly formed mesoderm to migrate away from the primitive streak. Mutant embryos appear to accumulate mesoderm midway along the proximal-distal axis. Nor-1 mutant embryos in this aspect share features similar to fgf8 null embryos (33Sun X. Meyers E.N. Lewandoski M. Martin G.R. Genes Dev. 1999; 13: 1834-1846Crossref PubMed Scopus (499) Google Scholar). Fgf8 is a growth factor, and it is known that Nor-1 and its family members are immediate early response genes to growth and differentiation stimuli (1Milbrandt J. Neuron. 1988; 1: 183-188Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (530) Google Scholar, 46Hazel T.G. Nathans D. Lau L.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 8444-8448Crossref PubMed Scopus (401) Google Scholar). Given this information, one can speculate that Nor-1 expression might normally be induced by fgf8 and lies in a molecular signaling pathway required for the proper movement and allocation of cells as they migrate away from the primitive streak. Alternatively, as it is known that Nor-1 is involved in cell death during thymocyte development, loss of Nor-1 might cause accumulation of cells by inefficient apoptosis. However, many studies of mouse embryo gastrulation have concluded that rapid proliferation and growth are more important than apoptosis for embryogenesis at this stage in development. Nor-1 levels are also important later during development as evidenced by the morphological defects in the Nor-1+/- mice. Although normal heterozygous mice can be found, they are born in much reduced numbers. Morphologically, the affected embryos appear delayed in their development and marker expression analysis reveals that although they generate axial mesoderm, it is incomplete. Thus, haploid insufficiency of Nor-1 can also cause mouse developmental problem. In summary, we have shown here that complete loss of Nor-1 leads to early embryonic lethality, and that Nor-1 is essential for either the migration of newly formed mesoderm away from the primitive streak or growth control of these mesodermal cells. A reduction in Nor-1 levels may also lead to lethality later in development. Therefore, Nor-1 plays a key role in the growth of the mouse embryo. How Nor-1 regulates genes important for early mouse development is the subject of future studies.

We explored the roles of Src family tyrosine kinases in cell migration and the spread of K-1735 murine melanoma cell lines with low or high metastatic potential. Corresponding to elevated cell motility and spreading ability, Fyn was selectively activated among Src family kinases, and the cell motility was blocked by an inhibitor of Src family kinases. Significant tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin, stable complex formation between activated Fyn and cortactin, and co-localization of cortactin with Fyn at cell membranes were all observed only in cells with high metastatic potential. Both integrin-mediated Fyn activation and hyperphosphorylation of cortactin were observed 2–5 h after stimulation in highly metastatic cells, and they required de novo protein synthesis. We demonstrate that cortactin is a specific substrate and cooperative effector of Fyn in integrin-mediated signaling processes regulating metastatic potential.

We demonstrate that cortactin is a specific substrate and cooperative effector of Fyn in integrin-mediated signaling processes regulating metastatic potential. Malignant tumors are thought to contain subpopulations of cells with differential metastatic capabilities (1Bishop J.M. Science. 1987; 235: 305-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1300) Google Scholar). Processes of tumor metastasis consist of multiple steps linked together, including invasion, detachment, intravasation, circulation, adhesion, extravasation, and growth in distant organs (2Fidler I.J. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 6130-6138PubMed Google Scholar). Cell locomotion and spreading are key functions of the cells required in most of these processes. Analysis of differences in expression and modification of signaling molecules associated with cell migration and spreading among tumor sublines with different metastatic potentials in a tumor is expected to provide precise information for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of cancer metastasis. There are studies demonstrating that Src family tyrosine kinases play essential roles in the signaling of integrin-mediated biological processes such as actin organization and cell migration (3Fincham V.J.

McMahon G.A. Hu X. Maciag T. J. Cell Biol. 1998; 141: 1647-1658Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar). In addition, recent reports show that Src is highly activated in colon cancers, particularly in those metastatic to the liver (8Irby R.B. Mao W. Coppola D. Kang J. Loubeau J.M. Trudeau W. Karl R. Fujita D.J. Jove R. Yeatman T.J. Nat. Genet. 1999; 21: 187-190Crossref PubMed Scopus (434) Google Scholar). Involvement of Src kinase during metastatic spread of carcinoma cells in NBT-II rat carcinoma cell lines has also been suggested (5Boyer B. Bourgeois Y. Poupon M.F. Oncogene. 2002; 21: 2347-2356Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar). Fyn has been suggested a factor governing the metastatic potential of tumors including murine methylcholanthrene-induced fibrosarcoma cells (9Takayama T. Mogi Y. Kogawa K. Yoshizaki N. Muramatsu H. Koike K. Semba K. Yamamoto T. Niitsu Y. Int. J. Cancer. 1993; 54: 875-879Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar), although the precise mechanism is unknown. Increasing numbers of studies have shown that Src family kinases function through collaboration with their substrates, such as FAK, cortactin, p130Cas (a Crk-associated substrate), and paxillin in cytoskeleton organization and cell migration. FAK is activated upon cell binding to extracellular matrix proteins and forms transient signaling complexes with Src family kinases (10Schlaepfer D.D. Hauck C.R. Sieg D.J. Prog. Biophys. Mol. Biol. 1999; 71: 435-478Crossref PubMed Scopus (1019) Google Scholar). Cortactin plays essential roles in cortical actin cytoskeleton organization, primarily affecting cell motility and invasion (11Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12van Damme H. Brok H. Schuuring-Scholtes E. Schuuring E. J. Biol.

Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). A docking protein, p130Cas, plays essential roles in cell attachment and migration when it is tyrosine-phosphorylated by Src family kinases (6Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Functional roles of paxillin in integrin-mediated signaling have been implicated by tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin following integrin-dependent cell adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins, which is in part attributed to Src family kinases (14Schaller M.D. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 6459-6472Crossref PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). To obtain further information on their involvements in the progression of metastasis, appropriate biological models showing different metastatic potentials are required. A widely used model for studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the progression of metastasis is a series of cell lines derived from K-1735 murine melanoma, which contains heterogeneous clones with multiple metastatic diversities (15Fidler I.J. Gruys E. Cifone M.A. Barnes Z. Bucana C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar). The primary K-1735 melanoma that arose in an inbred C3H/HeN murine mammary tumor virus-negative mouse was transplanted once into an immunosuppressed recipient and then established in culture. Randomly chosen clones C10 and C19 were classified as nonmetastatic or low metastatic; M2 and X21 were highly metastatic and produce tumor foci in lungs of syngenic mice (15Fidler I.J. Gruys E. Cifone M.A. Barnes Z. Bucana C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, we investigated the roles of Src family tyrosine kinases in cell migration and the spread of these cell lines. Up-regulation of Fyn kinase activity and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin were identified in highly metastatic cells, which also showed elevated cell motility and spreading ability. A new mode of integrin-mediated activation of Fyn was also observed in highly metastatic cells. These results indicate a novel role of the Fyn-cortactin pathway required for the regulation of cell motility and metastatic potential during the progression of metastasis. Cells and Cell Culture—K-1735-derived mouse melanoma cell lines were donated by Dr. I. J. Fidler. Clones C-10 and C-19 are classified as nonmetastatic or low metastatic. Parental clones M-2 and X21 are highly metastatic and produce tumor foci in lungs of syngenic mice (15Fidler I.J. Gruys E. Cifone M.A. Barnes Z. Bucana C. J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 1981; 67: 947-956PubMed Google Scholar). 3Y1-Crk is an isolated clone of rat 3Y1 cells transfected with v-Crk cDNA of an avian sarcoma virus CT10 inserted in expression vector pMV-7. 3Y1-Vec is an isolated clone of rat 3Y1 cells transfected with expression vector pMV-7 (16Sakai R.

Antibodies and Reagents—Polyclonal antibodies against Src family tyrosine kinase (Src-2), Src (Src-N-16), or Fyn (Fyn3) were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10, polyclonal antibody against human Fyn, and monoclonal antibody against cortactin (clone 4F11) were obtained from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. Monoclonal antibodies against Yes, Hck, or FAK were obtained from Transductory Laboratories. Monoclonal antibody against paxillin was obtained from Zymed Laboratories Inc. Polyclonal antibodies against Cas (Cas3 and Cas2) were used as described previously (16Sakai R. Iwamatsu A. Hirano N. Ogawa S. Tanaka T. Mano H. Yazaki Y. Hirai H. EMBO J. 1994; 13: 3748-3756Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar). Rhodamine-labeled phalloidin was purchased from Molecular Probes, and fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse and rhodamineconjugated anti-rabbit antibodies were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. Polylysine, fibronectin, and cycloheximide were purchased from Sigma. Src family kinases inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2) and the structural analog 4-amino-7-phenylpyrazol [3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP3) were obtained from Calbiochem-Novabiochem Ltd. Cell Stimulation with Fibronectin or Polylysine—The cells were serum-starved (on dish) in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS for 18 h, washed by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and harvested by trypsin-EDTA treatment (0.5% trypsin, 2 mm EDTA) in DMEM. The trypsin was inactivated by the addition of soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.5 mg/ml) (Sigma), and the cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in DMEM containing 0.5% FCS, and held in suspension for 30 min at 37 °C (off dish). The cell culture dishes were precoated with FN purified from bovine plasma (10 μg/ml) or polylysine (10 μg/ml) (Sigma) in PBS overnight at 4 °C, rinsed with PBS, and warmed to 37 °C for 1 h. Suspended cells were distributed onto ligand-coated dishes and incubated at 37 °C. At various times following plating as indicated, the attached cells were rinsed in PBS and lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (see below). Total cell proteins in lysates were standardized prior to use. Cell Lysis, Immunoblotting, and Immunoprecipitation—Protein extraction and Western blotting analysis were performed as described (6Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were lysed in 1% Triton X-100 buffer (50 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 1.5 mm MgCl2, 1 mm EGTA, 100 mm NaF, 1 mm Na3VO4, 10 μg/ml approtinin, 10 μg/ml leupeptin, 1 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl), and insoluble material was removed by centrifugation. The protein aliquots were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed with 1:2000 diluted antibodies. For immunoprecipitation, 500 μg of protein was mixed with 1–2 μg of antibodies against cortactin, Src family (Src-2), Src (Src-N-16), Fyn, Cas3, paxillin, or FAK and incubated for 1 h on ice. Then samples were rotated with protein A- or protein G-Sepharose beads (Sigma) for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads were washed four times with 1% Triton X-100 buffer and boiled in sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.1 m Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.1 m dithiothreitol) before being subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis. Immunofluorescence—Immunofluorescence staining was performed essentially as described previously (6Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). 6 × 104 cells were plated onto 12-mm circle cover glasses (Fisher), which were placed in each well of a 24-well plate and allowed to grow for 24 h in DMEM with 10% FCS at 37 °C with 5% CO2. Where necessary, the 12-mm circle cover glasses were coated with FN (10 μg/ml) or polylysine (10 μg/ml) overnight in PBS, respectively, before cells plating. The cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 m sodium phosphate (pH 7.0) for 5 min, washed three times with PBS, and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-PBS for 10 min before blocking with 2% bovine serum albumin with TBST (0.15 m NaCl, 1% Tris, pH 7.0, 0.05% Tween 20). Then the cells were incubated with the first antibody anti-cortactin (5 ng/μl) or anti-Fyn (Fyn3) (5 ng/μl) in 2% bovine serum albumin with TBST to stain cortactin or Fyn for 1 h. After washing three times with PBS, the cells were then incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:40) or rhodamine-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:40) for 30 min. In staining actin stress fibers, the cells were incubated with rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (1:200, 1 unit/ml) for 30 min in 2% bovine serum albumin with TBST. After the cells were washed three times with PBS, the cover glasses were mounted in a 1:1 mixture of 2.5% DABCO (Sigma) in PBS and glycerol. The cells were then visualized using a Radiance 2100 confocal microscopic system (Bio-Rad). Cell Migration Assay—Cell motility of 3Y1-Crk fibroblasts was performed as described previously (6Huang J. Hamasaki H. Nakamoto T. Honda H. Hirai H. Saito M. Takato T. Sakai R. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 27265-27272Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Haptotactic cell migration of all the melanoma cells was analyzed using Boyden chamber cell migration assay with some modification. The conditions are described in a previous study (17Basara M.L. McCarthy J.B. Barnes D.W. Furcht L.T. Cancer Res. 1985; 45: 2487-2494PubMed Google Scholar). In detail, the cells were trypsinized, washed once in DMEM with 10% FCS, and washed once in serum-free DMEM. 1.5 × 105 cells were then resuspended to 560 μl of DMEM with 15 mm Hepes buffer (pH 7.2) and added to the upper well of the Boyden chamber. To investigate the effect of PP2 treatment on cell motility, the cells were added to the upper well under the same conditions in the presence of PP2 (10 μm), Me2SO (10 μm), or PP3 (10 μm). FN (Sigma) was diluted in 1280 μl of medium as described above at a concentration of 10 μg/ml and filled the lower well of the chamber. A polyvinylpyrrolidone-free polycarbonate filter with an 8-μm pore size (Neuroprobe) was used. The chamber containing the cells was incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in a humid 5% CO2 atmosphere. The cells at the lower surface of the filter were fixed in methanol for 30 min, washed with PBS, and then exposed to Giemsa staining for 15 s. After washing three times with PBS, the filter was mounted on a glass slide. The side of the filter to which cells had been added was scraped. The number of migrated cells was counted from photographs taken of at least eight fields at a magnification of 200× under the microscope. Cell Spreading Assay—Cells in confluence were overnight serum-starved, harvested with 0.5% trypsin and 2 mm EDTA, and washed once with soybean trypsin inhibitor (0.5 mg/ml) in DMEM before being resuspended with DMEM at 105 cells/ml. The cells were then plated on dishes coated with FN (10 μg/ml) (Sigma). Photos of cells were taken at the indicated times. Single cells that were phase bright with rounded morphology were scored as nonspread, whereas those that possessed a flat shape and were phase dark were scored as spread. The percentage of spread cells was calculated by counting the spread cells in each microscope field. The same experiment was repeated at least three times. Immune Complex Kinase Assay—For immune complex assay, each member of Src family kinases in cell lysates containing 500 μg of proteins was first immunoprecipitated by antibody against Fyn (UBI), Src family (Src2), Src (Src-N-16) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), Yes, or Hck (Transduction Laboratories). Then immunoprecipitates were consequently washed using 1% Triton buffer and kinase buffer (50 mm Tris, pH 7.4, 50 mm NaCl, 10 mm MgCl2, 10 mm MnCl2) three times, respectively. To each sample, 1 μl of exogenous synthetic polypeptides poly-[Glu-Tyr] was added as exogenous substrate. Kinase reaction was performed in 30 μl of kinase buffer with 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (ICN) at room temperature for 30 min. Kinase reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS-PAGE sample buffer (2% SDS, 0.1 m Tris, pH 6.8, 10% glycerol, 0.01% bromphenol blue, 0.1 m dithiothreitol). The samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis using 8% polyacrylamide gel. The gels were then dried and exposed to autoradiography. Highly Metastatic Murine Melanoma Cell Lines Exhibited Enhanced Motility and Spreading Ability on Fibronectin—To clarify differences in cell properties that correspond to the diversity of metastatic potentials of K-1735 cell lines, we measured haptotactic cell migration ability toward FN using a Boyden chamber. As shown in Fig. 1A, about 140 cells/field of highly metastatic cells X21 and M2 migrated through the pores of the filter in 3 h toward FN. In contrast, for low metastatic cells C19 and C10, only about 70 cells/field of C19 and no more than 10 cells/field of C10 migrated through the pores toward FN, respectively. No cell locomotion was observed in the absence of FN in any of these cell lines, suggesting that these cells exhibit FN-dependent cell motility. Cell motility under the stimulation of integrin correlates with metastatic potentials. To determine their differences in spreading abilities, time-dependent cell spreading was estimated by the percentage of flat cells in all of cells at attachment after plating on FN-coated dishes (see “Experimental Procedures”). About 70% of X21 and 45% of M2 exhibited a flat shape with multiple protrusions 30 min after plating on FN. In contrast, about 20% of C19 and 17% of C10 were spread (Fig. 1B). After plating on FN for 60 min, the percentages of flat cells of X21 and M2 increased to about 98%, whereas there were less than 50% C19 and C10 showing a flat shape (Fig. 1B). These results demonstrate that cell spreading of X21 and M2 occurs much faster than that of C10 and C19. Both cell migration and cell spreading abilities were enhanced in highly metastatic cell lines. Analysis of Src Family Kinases Responsible for Enhanced Cell Motility of Melanoma Cells with High Metastatic Potential—Roles of Src family tyrosine kinases in cell migration of X21 and M2 cells were investigated by the Boyden chamber in the presence of specific inhibitor of Src family kinases including Src, Fyn and Hck, PP2 (18Hanke J.H. Gardner J.P. Dow R.L. Changelian P.S. Brissette W.H. Weringer E.J. Pollok B.A. Connelly P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1996; 271: 695-701Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1775) Google Scholar). The inactive structural analog PP3 and Me2SO were used as negative controls. Treatment of PP2 significantly reduced the number of cells migrating through the pores in 3 h from 140 to about 30/field (Fig. 2), whereas negative controls Me2SO or PP3 did not show such an effect, showing that PP2 impairs cell motility of X21 and M2. These results demonstrate that some member(s) of Src family kinases play essential roles in cell migration of highly metastatic cells. To characterize the member of the Src kinases responsible for the enhanced cell motility and spreading ability detected in highly metastatic cells M2 and X21, the kinase activities of Src, Fyn, Yes, and Hck were investigated using an in vitro immune complex kinase assay in the presence of exogenous synthetic polypeptides poly[Glu-Tyr] as substrates. No significant differences in kinase activities of Src and Yes were observed in any of the cell lines with different metastatic potentials (Fig. 3, C and D). In the case of Hck, the kinase activity was rather lower in X21 and M2 (Fig. 3E), whereas the activity of Fyn was particularly elevated in highly metastatic cells X21 and M2 compared with C10 and C19 (Fig. 3B). These results indicate that Fyn is a candidate Src family kinase responsible for high metastatic potential in X21 and M2 melanoma cells. In the absence of exogenous substrate, a distinct 85-kDa protein was significantly phosphorylated by the immune complex kinase assay by pan-Src and Fyn in X21 and M2 (Fig. 3, F and G, closed triangles) but not in C10 or C19. This protein was not detected in protein complexes immunoprecipitated by Src (Src-N-16), Yes, or Hck (Fig. 3, H–J), demonstrating that this protein is specifically associated with Fyn in highly metastatic cell lines. An 80-kDa phosphorylated band was also immunoprecipitated by Src, Hck, or Yes only in M2 (Fig. 3, H–J, open triangles). Judging from differences in molecular size and substrate specificity, this protein is distinct from the 85-kDa protein observed in both X21 and M2. Overexpressed and Hyperphosphorylated Cortactin Was Specifically Associated with Fyn in Highly Metastatic Cells—Cortactin, a protein of 80/85 kDa, acts as a potential linker between membrane-located receptors and cytoskeleton, primarily affecting cell motility and invasion (11Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12van Damme H. Brok H. Schuuring-Scholtes E. Schuuring E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7374-7380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar, 13Huang C. Liu J. Haudenschild C.C. Zhan X. J. Biol. Chem. 1998; 273: 25770-25776Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (234) Google Scholar). Because the molecular size of cortactin appeared close to the size of the protein associated with Fyn in X21 and M2 (Fig. 3G), we examined the expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in these murine melanoma cells. As expected, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was significantly elevated in X21 and M2 (Fig. 4A, lanes 2 and 4) compared with that of C10 and C19 (Fig. 4A, lanes 1 and 3). Expression levels of cortactin in X21 and M2 were also up-regulated (Fig. 4B, lanes 1 and 3). Tyrosine phosphorylation levels of cortactin were much reduced by Src family kinase inhibitor PP2 in X21 and M2 in contrast to PP3 (Fig. 4C), confirming that Src family kinases are responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in X21 and M2. At the same time, we investigated the expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of other substrates of Src family kinases such as p130Cas, FAK, and paxillin. As shown in Fig. 4B, tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas was reduced in X21 and M2 compared with that in C10 and C19, and no significant differences of FAK tyrosine phosphorylation were detected among these cells. Tyrosine phosphorylation and expression of paxillin in C10 were much lower, but they were at the same level in C19 as in X21 and M2. Cortactin was the only phosphotyrosine-containing protein showing significantly elevated phosphorylation levels in highly metastatic cell lines. Further study confirmed that cortactin was specifically associated with Fyn in X21 and M2. It was observed that the amount of cortactin coupling with Fyn in X21 and M2 was significantly greater than that in C10 and C19 (Fig. 5A). Correspondingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of the protein with a size of 85 kDa associated with Fyn in X21 and M2 was also observed (Fig. 5B, lanes 2 and 4). In contrast, an 80-kDa tyrosine-phosphorylated protein associated with Src was only observed in M2 but not in X21 (Fig. 5C, lane 4). This M2-specific protein was later identified as a gag protein derived from murine mammary tumor virus by means of mass spectrometry analysis, 2J. Huang, T. Asawa, T. Takato, and R. Sakai, unpublished data. which might be infected during the establishment of the M2 cell line by in vivo selection. There has been no report on tyrosine phosphorylation of this protein so far, and its roles on the metastatic potential of M2 are currently under investigation. To provide additional evidence for essential roles of kinase-substrate cooperation between Fyn and cortactin, v-Crk transformed 3Y1 fibroblasts were used in which Fyn was reported to be activated by v-Crk (19Sakai R. Nakamoto T. Ozawa K. Aizawa S. Hirai H. Oncogene. 1997; 14: 1419-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (59) Google Scholar). Following Fyn activation, elevated cell motility was observed in 3Y1-Crk cells compared with mock-transfected 3Y1-vec cells as shown in Fig. 6A. At the same time, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was significantly enhanced in 3Y1-Crk fibroblasts (Fig. 6C), and the same molecular sizes of phosphoproteins were obvious among Fyn-associated phosphoproteins apart from p130Cas, which has been reported to be associated with Fyn (Fig. 6B). These results in fibroblasts also support the possibility that cortactin tyrosine phosphorylation is regulated by Fyn in relation to signaling of cell migration. Subcellular Localization of Fyn and Cortactin in Melanoma Cell Lines—Because cortactin has been functionally identified as an actin-associated protein (20Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 21Kaksonen M. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4421-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar), we also investigated co-localizations of cortactin with actin in C10, C19, X21, and M2. First, different distribution patterns of actin filaments between low and highly metastatic cells were noticed on noncoated glass slides. Significantly increased amounts of actin filaments were found at cell membrane protrusions in highly metastatic cells X21 and M2 (Fig. 7A, panels c2 and d2). In contrast, actin filaments were widely (nonspecifically) observed in cell matrix in C10 and C19 (Fig. 7A, panels a2 and b2). It was also observed that overexpressed cortactin was localized in these cell membrane protrusions specific to X21 and M2 (Fig. 7A, panels c1, d1, c3, and d3), implying that cortactin is associated with signaling of actin cytoskeleton organization near the membrane in highly metastatic cells. Results of staining of Fyn and cortactin demonstrated that most of cortactin and Fyn were distributed at cell membrane protrusions in M2 and X21 (Fig. 7B, panels a and d, arrows), showing apparent co-localization of cortactin and Fyn at these structures. To further investigate the role of cortactin in highly metastatic cells, we explored co-localization of cortactin with actin filaments in X21 and M2 under the stimulation of integrin. As shown in Fig. 8, cortactin was co-localized with actin filaments at lamellipodias or fillopodias in M2 or X21, which were formed under the stimulation of FN. Late Response of Fyn Activation by FN Requires de Novo Protein Synthesis—To illustrate molecular mechanisms underlying FN-stimulated redistribution of cortactin and formation of lamellipodia or fillopodia in highly metastatic cells X21 and M2, we explored the activity of Fyn under FN stimulation by in vitro kinase assay with poly[Glu-Tyr]. In X21, Fyn activity was relatively high when cells were at attachment (Fig. 9A, lane 1), whereas it was sharply reduced when cells were detached and kept in suspension for 30 min (Fig. 9A, lane 2). The activity of Fyn was restored 2 or 5 h after cells were plated on FN (Fig. 9A, lanes 5 and 6). Corresponding to the activation of Fyn, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin also exhibited a similar time course (Fig. 9A, lower panel). A similar pattern of activation of Fyn and tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin by FN was also observed in M2.2 In contrast, levels of Fyn activity were not significantly changed in C10 and C19 after each indicated time plated on FN (Fig. 9B).2 Although tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was abolished by detachment, no obvious peaks in tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin after each indicated time plated on FN were observed in these cells (Fig. 9B, lower panel). Preceding elevated Fyn activity at 2–5 h after stimulation, the expression level of cortactin was also increased from 1 to 2 h in X21 (Fig. 9A, lower panel). The same results were observed in M2.2 The late phase activation of Fyn demonstrated by both M2 and X21 on FN raised the possibility of yet unidentified regulatory mechanisms in integrin-mediated Fyn activation. To determine whether de novo synthesis of regulatory proteins in this process is required, we investigated Fyn activity in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX), a protein synthesis inhibitor. As expected, elevated expression of cortactin induced by integrin stimulation was antagonized by CHX at 5 h after plating (Fig. 9C, lower panel, lane 6). At the same time, it was observed that activation of Fyn was significantly blocked by the treatment of CHX at 5 h after plating (Fig. 9C, upper panel, lane 8) compared with the control (Fig. 9C, upper panel, lane 4). Tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was also down-regulated by CHX treatment (Fig. 9C, lower panel, lane 6). The same results were observed in M2.2 These findings indicate that de novo protein synthesis is involved in the late phase activation of Fyn by FN stimulation.7 Previous studies have shown that Fyn is an essential regulator in integrin-mediated processes including actin cytoskeleton organization, cell migration, and adhesion in normal cells (23Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794PubMed Google Scholar, 24Klinghoffer R.A. Sachsenmaier C. Cooper J.A. Soriano P.

Cell Biol. 2003; 160: 137-146Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar). A recent study also demonstrated that Fyn is prerequisite for normal keratinocyte migration and squamous carcinoma invasion (26Mariotti A. Kedeshian P.A. Dans M. Curatola A.M. Gagnoux-Palacios L. Giancotti F.G. J. Cell Biol. 2001; 155: 447-458Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). However, little is known regarding the functional roles of Fyn in tumor metastasis. In this study, in contrast to Src, Yes, and Hck, enhanced levels of Fyn activity and late phase activations of Fyn after stimulation by FN were observed in highly metastatic murine melanoma cell lines. Activated Fyn caused hyperphosphorylation of cortactin and formation of stable complex between Fyn and cortactin in these metastatic cell lines, indicating that Fyn and cortactin are key molecules in the integrin signaling pathway during the development of cancer metastasis. Activation of Fyn by integrin signaling is mediated by many kinds of proteins involved in integrin signaling, which includes caveolin 1, tyrosine kinases, FAK, or receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase α (23Cary L.A. Chang J.F. Guan J.L. J. Cell Sci. 1996; 109: 1787-1794PubMed Google Scholar, 25Zeng L. Si X. Yu W.P. Le H.T. Ng K.P. Teng R.M. Ryan K. Wang D.Z. Ponniah S. Pallen C.J. J.

Cell. 1998; 94: 625-634Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (604) Google Scholar). It has been observed in several studies that the activity of Src is enhanced 20–40 min following FN stimulation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts (28Schaller M.D. Hildebrand J.D. Shannon J.D. Fox J.W. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1680-1688Crossref PubMed Scopus (1113) Google Scholar, 29Giancotti F.G. Ruoslahti E.

In this study, it was observed that Fyn activation occurs as late as 2–5 h after fibronectin stimulation in metastatic melanoma cell lines, and integrin-mediated activation of Fyn requires de novo protein synthesis. One possibility is that the up-regulation of cortactin that occurred approximately 1–2 h after stimulation is a primary event that triggers the activation of Fyn and phosphorylation of cortactin itself. As a special substrate associated with Fyn in metastatic cells, it is possible that cortactin regulates the activity of Fyn through physical associations to SH2 of Fyn. Another possibility is that a third molecule(s), which is specifically expressed in metastatic cell lines under stimulation of integrin, might regulate activation of Fyn, although this protein(s) has not been identified. In this paper, we do not demonstrate that cortactin is a direct substrate of Fyn kinase. According to a recent paper, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin occurs via activation of Rac1 by c-Src in C3H fibroblasts (38Head J.A. Jiang D. Li M. Zorn L.J. Schaefer E.M. Parsons J.T. Weed S.A. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3216-3229Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). Therefore, there is a possibility that cortactin phosphorylation by Fyn is regulated in a similar indirect manner in highly metastatic melanoma cell lines. Cortactin was first identified as a p80/85-kDa v-Src substrate in chicken embryo cells transformed by v-Src oncogene (32Kanner S.B. Reynolds A.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3328-3332Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). It was implicated in the progression of breast tumors through gene amplification at chromosome 11q13 (33Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in metastasis was also implicated in a recent report (34Li Y. Tondravi M. Liu J. Smith E. Haudenschild C.C. Kaczmarek M. Zhan X. Cancer Res. 2001; 61: 6906-6911PubMed Google Scholar). In this study, overexpression and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin in highly metastatic cells was observed, and it was also clarified that cortactin was specifically associated with Fyn in cells with high metastatic potential. When the activity of Fyn was inhibited by PP2, tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin was also down-regulated. Moreover, corresponding to up-regulated membrane redistribution of cortactin, co-localized cortactin and Fyn at cell membrane protrusions in highly metastatic cells were also observed. Taken together, these results indicate that cortactin is associated with Fyn in integrin-mediated signaling processes in cancer metastasis. Previous reports have shown that cortactin is primarily localized within peripheral cell structures such as lamellipodia, pseudopodia, and membrane ruffles and has been suggested to operate as a potential linker between membrane-located receptors and cytoskeleton, primarily affecting cell motility and invasion (11Wu H. Parsons J.T. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1417-1426Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar, 12van Damme H. Brok H. Schuuring-Scholtes E. Schuuring E. J. Biol. Chem. 1997; 272: 7374-7380Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar). In this study, corresponding to enhanced cell motility, co-localized cortactin with actin filaments at lamellipodias or fillopodias was also observed in highly metastatic cells. Studies in normal cells have shown that cortactin was actively involved in lamellipodia actin polymerization (20Uruno T. Liu J. Zhang P. Fan Y. Egile C. Li R. Mueller S.C. Zhan X. Nat. Cell Biol. 2001; 3: 259-266Crossref PubMed Scopus (450) Google Scholar, 21Kaksonen M. Peng H.B. Rauvala H. J. Cell Sci. 2000; 113: 4421-4426Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 22Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar). Lamellipodias and fillopodias are membrane structures formed during cell spreading and migration (35Mitchison T.J. Cramer L.P. Cell. 1996; 84: 371-379Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1298) Google Scholar). It can be deduced from these reports that cortactin plays important roles in cell migration through its roles in integrin-stimulated actin cytoskeleton rearrangements during cancer metastasis. Support for this deduction is provided by the study of overexpression of cortactin in human tumors or NIH 3T3 fibroblasts, which has been shown to result in increased cell motility (36Schuuring E. Gene (Amst.). 1995; 159: 83-96Crossref PubMed Scopus (247) Google Scholar, 37Patel A.S. Schechter G.L. Wasilenko W.J. Somers K.D. Oncogene. 1998; 16: 3227-3232Crossref PubMed Scopus (126) Google Scholar). Overall, results in this study indicate that the Fyn-cortactin pathway is specifically activated for signaling of cell migration and spreading during the progression of cancer metastasis. Identification of specific involvements of Fyn and cortactin in integrin signaling pathways in metastatic melanoma cell lines provided important information for the understanding of mechanisms underlying the progression of cancer metastasis. Further studies are necessary to elucidate what is produced de novo for the activation of Fyn and how it affects Fyn activity stimulated by integrin in metastasis. Moreover, to fully clarify their roles in metastasis and to provide further information for cancer therapy, the effect of blocking tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin or suppressing expression of cortactin on the metastasis potential also needs to be further investigated.

https://openalex.org/W2023883324,"Increasing hypoxia tolerance in mammalian cells is potentially of major importance, but it has not been feasible thus far. The disaccharide trehalose, which accumulates dramatically during heat shock, enhances thermotolerance and reduces aggregation of denatured proteins. Previous studies from our laboratory showed that over-expression of Drosophila trehalose-phosphate synthase (dtps1) increases the trehalose level and anoxia tolerance in flies. To determine whether trehalose can protect against anoxic injury in mammalian cells, we transfected the dtps1 gene into human HEK-293 cells using the recombinant plasmid pcDNA3.1(–)-dtps1 and obtained more than 20 stable cell strains. Glucose starvation in culture showed that HEK-293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(–)-dtps1 (HEK-dtps1) do not metabolize intracellular trehalose, and, interestingly, these cells accumulated intracellular trehalose during hypoxic exposure. In contrast to HEK-293 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1(–) (HEK-v), cells with trehalose were more resistant to low oxygen stress (1% O2). To elucidate how trehalose protects cells from anoxic injury, we assayed protein solubility and the amount of ubiquitinated proteins. There was three times more insoluble protein in HEK-v than in HEK-dtps1 after 3 days of exposure to low O2. The amount of Na+-K+ ATPase present in the insoluble proteins dramatically increased in HEK-v cells after 2 and 3 days of exposure, whereas there was no significant change in HEK-dtps1 cells. Ubiquitinated proteins increased dramatically in HEK-v cells after 2 and 3 days of exposure but not in HEK-dtps1 cells over the same period. Our results indicate that increased trehalose in mammalian cells following transfection by the Drosophila tps1 gene protects cells from hypoxic injury. The mechanism of this protection is likely related to a decrease in protein denaturation, through protein-trehalose interactions, resulting in enhanced cellular recovery from hypoxic stress."
https://openalex.org/W2020982738,"Although some exceptional motifs have been identified, it is well known that the PXXP motif is the motif of ligand proteins generally recognized by the Src homology 3 (SH3) domain. SH3-ligand interactions are usually weak, with ordinary KD ∼ 10 μm. The structural basis for a tight and specific association (KD = 0.24 μm) between Gads SH3 and a novel motif, PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP, was revealed in a previous structural analysis of the complex formed between them. In this paper, we report the crystal structure of the signal transducing adaptor molecule-2 (STAM2) SH3 domain in complex with a peptide with a novel motif derived from a ligand protein, UBPY. The derived KD value for this complex is 27 μm. The notable difference in affinity for these parallel complexes may be explained because the STAM2 SH3 structure does not provide a specificity pocket for binding, whereas the Gads SH3 structure does. Instead, the structure of STAM2 SH3 is analogous to that of Grb2 SH3 which, in addition to normal PXXP ligands, has also been shown to moderately recognize the novel motif discussed herein. Thus, the extremely tight interaction observed between Gads SH3 and the novel motif is caused not by an innate ability of the novel motif but rather by an evolutionary change in the Gads SH3 domain.

J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The SH3 recognizes a proline-rich sequence of its ligand protein (2Ren R. Mayer B.J. Cicchetti P. Baltimore D. Science. 1993; 259: 1157-1161Crossref PubMed Scopus (1018) Google Scholar) with a ϕPXϕP (PXXP) motif, which is usually further classified into +XϕPXϕP (class I) and ϕPXϕPX+ (class II) (where ϕ and + are usually a hydrophobic residue and an arginine residue, respectively). Each motif adopts a left-handed type II polyproline (PPII) helix, known as a collagen chain conformation, and fits the ligand-binding site on the SH3 surface. Ligand recognition by an SH3 domain is not exclusive but rather promiscuous. An SH3 domain may interact with several ligand proteins in vivo and vice versa, which are due not only to the low ligand recognition specificity of the domain but also to the weak interactions, with KD (dissociation constant) values of ∼1–102 μm in most cases (1Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).

The Sem5 (Grb2 in Drosophila) SH3(C) in complex with a Sos-derived class II peptide, PPPVPPRRR (where consensus residues are underlined), is a typical example of an SH3-ligand complex. In the structure, the ligand peptide adopts a PPII helix conformation, and the side chain of the underlined arginine residue electrostatically interacts with the conserved negatively charged pocket on the SH3 surface formed by its acidic RT loop (4Lim W.A. Richards F.M. Fox R.O. Nature. 1994; 372: 375-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (448) Google Scholar). It has, however, become apparent that some SH3 domains recognize motifs that do not contain the ϕPXϕP motif. PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP is a classic example of such a motif, first identified in a deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY (9Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol.

Urbanowski J.L. Winistorfer S.C. Piper R.C. Nat. Cell. Bio. 2002; 4: 534-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (279) Google Scholar), is most likely to associate with a deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp7, although its biological implications have yet to be elucidated (3Tong A.H.

Science. 2002; 295: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). In addition to the SH3 domains of STAM proteins, Gads (a Grb2-related protein) SH3(C) interacts with the novel motif, PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP, of SLP-76 very strongly, with a KD of 0.24 μm. This indicates an ∼102 times higher affinity compared with ordinary interactions between SH3 domains and their ϕPxϕP ligands (17Liu Q. Berry D. Nash P. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Li S.S. Mol.

The solved structure of Gads SH3(C) in complex with the novel motif revealed that, in addition to hydrophobic interactions with the (Val/Ile) residue of the motif, electrostatic interactions with the RXXK region enables this strong binding. Moreover, Grb2 SH3(C) requires the novel motif as a sequence in some of its ligands such as c-Cbl, Gab1, Gab2, and SLP-76. However, the interaction between Grb2 SH3(C) and the novel motif is much weaker than its Gads SH3(C)-related counterpart, with an ordinary KD = 6–20 μm (5Lewitzky M. Kardinal C. Gehring N.H.

From the crystal structure of the STAM2 SH3 domain in complex with a UBPY-derived peptide reported here, we discuss the structural importance of a novel, but modest, interaction for ligand recognition. Preparation of the SH3 Domain—The DNA sequence of the SH3 domain (residues 204–261) of mouse STAM2 was amplified by PCR and was cloned into the pTYB12 expression vector of the IMPACT-CN system (New England BioLabs) containing the N-terminal intein and chitin-binding domain unit. Proteins were expressed in Escherichia coli ER2566 cells at 18 °C for half a day after induction with 0.5 mm isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside. After being harvested, cells were lysed in standard buffer (20 mm HEPES, pH 8.2, 0.5 m NaCl, 1 mm EDTA) by sonication on ice, and the lysate was centrifuged at 4 °C. The supernatant was loaded onto the chitin bead column, and the column was washed with standard buffer. By incubating for 2 days at 20 °C for the on-column self-cleavage reaction with standard buffer supplemented with 50 mm dithiothreitol, the SH3 domain was cleaved from the fused tag and eluted. The eluted SH3 domain was further purified on a gel filtration column and concentrated in 20 mm Tris-HCl and 0.2 m NaCl, pH 8.0. Peptide Preparation—Initially, we synthesized a UBPY-derived 9-mer peptide (PMVNRENKP (700–708)) by the standard Fmoc method. Because crystallization of the SH3 domain in complex with this peptide had failed because of low affinity, a longer (11-mer) peptide (TPMVNRENKPP (699–709)) was prepared (synthesized by Sigma). This peptide was dissolved in 2 mm Tris-HCl and used for the subsequent spectroscopic and co-crystallization experiments. A Ubp7-derived peptide and poly-l-proline (molecular weight range of 100 Da to 1 kDa), used in fluorescence spectroscopy, were purchased from Sigma. Fluorescence Spectroscopy—Interaction between the STAM2 SH3 domain and peptides in solution was observed by fluorescence intensity change at 345 nm. Samples were excited at 295 nm to minimize the excitation of residues other than tryptophan at the STAM2 SH3 domain ligand-binding site (Trp-239 and Trp-240) (19Lim W.A. Fox R.O. Richards F.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The dissociation constant was calculated according to a function described by Nguyen et al. (20Nguyen J.T. Turck C.W. Cohen F.E. Zuckermann R.N. Lim W.A. Science. 1998; 282: 2088-2092Crossref PubMed Scopus (274) Google Scholar). Non-linear least square fitting of the data to the function was carried out with GNUPLOT. Crystallography of the STAM2 SH3 Domain—The SH3 domain was crystallized at 25 °C using the vapor diffusion method, with the drops consisting of a 1:1 mixture of 1 mm (∼7 mg/ml) protein solution and the reservoir solution (0.1 m Tris-HCl and 1.9 m ammonium sulfate, pH 9.0). Prior to data collection, the crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen with 20% glycerol in the crystallization solution. A set of data was collected on beamline BL-6A at the Photon Factory and processed and merged with DPS (21Rossmann M.G. van Beek C.G. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol.

Prior to data collection, the crystal was flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen with 20% glycerol in the crystallization solution.

Binding Affinity of the Novel Motif to the STAM2 SH3 Domain—Two sites containing the novel motif, PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP, have been found in mouse UBPY that interact with the STAM2 SH3 domain (9Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37481-37487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). PMVNRENKP (700–708) is more highly conserved among the species than PQVDRTKKP (405–413) (conserved residues are underlined). Thus, we prepared the ligand peptide containing the former sequence, 1TPMVNRENKPP11 (699–709). To begin with, we measured the dissociation constant (KD) of the complex formed between STAM2 SH3 and the UBPY-derived peptide. The KD value, derived from tryptophan fluorescence experiments, was 27 μm (Fig. 1A). The affinity is significantly (100×) lower than the reported one between Gads SH3(C) and the novel motif (0.24 μm; Ref. 7Berry D.M. Nash P. Liu S.K. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Curr. Biol. 2002; 12: 1336-1341Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). Instead, the KD of the STAM2 SH3-peptide complex is comparable with those of complexes between Grb2 SH3(C) and its novel motif-containing ligands (KD values ranging from 6 to 20 μm; Refs. 5Lewitzky M. Kardinal C. Gehring N.H. Schmidt E.K. Konkol B. Eulitz M. Birchmeier W. Schaeper U. Feller S.M. Oncogene. 2001; 20: 1052-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar and 18Kami K. Takeya R. Sumimoto H. Kohda D. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 4268-4276Crossref PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar), as well as those of ordinary interactions between SH3 domains and ϕPXϕP ligands (1–102 μm; Ref. 1Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). These findings imply that the novel motif does not necessarily function to enhance binding to SH3 domains; rather, the interaction between Gads SH3(C) and the novel motif is considered extraordinary. In terms of the degree of binding affinity, the interaction between STAM2 SH3 and its ligand is considered ordinary, despite its unusual ligand sequence. UBPY Peptide Binding Site and Peptide Conformation—The differences in the SH3-ligand affinity are thought to have originated from their structural differences. To confirm this idea, we solved the crystal structure for the STAM2 SH3 domain in complex with the UBPY-derived peptide ligand at 1.7 Å resolution (Table I).Table ISummary of refinement statisticsRcryst (%)21.5Rfree (%)aRfree factor was calculated for a randomly chosen 10% of the total reflections that was not included in the refinement23.0No. of protein residues67Total number of water sites64Number of phosphate ions1R.m.s.bR.m.s., root-mean-square deviations from ideal values Bond length (Å)0.021 Bond angle (°)1.673Average temperature factor (Å2) Main-chain protein atoms23.1 Side-chain protein atoms25.9 Phosphate ions24.3 Water molecules36.3Ramachandran plot (%) Residues in most favored region93.0 Residues in additionally allowed region7.0 Residues in generously allowed or disallowed regions0a Rfree factor was calculated for a randomly chosen 10% of the total reflections that was not included in the refinementb R.m.s., root-mean-square Open table in a new tab The two C-terminal residues of the peptide are not included in the final model because they do not show definite peaks on an electron density map, probably because of disorder. The ligand-binding site of the STAM2 SH3 domain consists of a rather hydrophobic surface suitable for polyproline type II helix binding and an adjacent acidic region formed by the RT and n-Src loops, common among other SH3 domains (Fig. 2, A and B). Gads SH3(C) (MODEL1 in the NMR ensemble structure; Ref. 17Liu Q. Berry D. Nash P. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Li S.S. Mol.

Structure. 1995; 3: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar) are superposable upon the structure of the STAM2 SH3 domain, with root-mean-square difference values for all Cα atoms of 1.3, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.9 Å, respectively. The root-mean-square difference value for Grb2 SH3(C) superposed with SEM-5 SH3(C) is 0.6 Å. These values imply that STAM2 SH3, Grb2 SH3(C), and SEM-5 SH3(C) share similar overall structures (Fig. 2C). The relatively large difference between the STAM2 and Gads SH3 domains may be attributed to drastic changes of the Gads SH3(C) around the hydrophobic pocket (see below) as well as the fluctuations observed in the NMR structure, which tends to cause larger differences than the crystal structures (32Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar, 33Chen Y.W. Dodson E.J. Kleywegt G.J. Struct. Fold Des. 2000; 8: R213-R220Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF Scopus (38) Google Scholar). Based upon the studies of the interactions of the SLP-76 peptide with the Grb2 and Gads SH3(C) domains, the UBPY peptide binds in the vicinity of the general STAM2 SH3 ligand-binding site, as predicted. The second half (6RENK9) of the peptide adopts a right-handed 310 helix conformation, which has never been observed in ϕPXϕP motifs (Fig. 2B). Superposition of the SLP-76 peptide (1APSIDRSTKPA11) on the UBPY peptide reveals a similarity between the two peptide structures (Fig. 2D). Notable differences are seen around Val-4 and the conformation of the Asn-5, Arg-6, and Lys-9 side chains involved in the mediation of essential hydrogen bonds (see below). Of the noted inconsistencies, the δ oxygen of the Asn-5 side chain provides two intramolecular hydrogen bonds connecting the oxygen with neighboring Arg-6 and Glu-7 nitrogen atoms of the main chain (Fig. 3A). Although the asparagine (Asn-5) can be replaced by an aspartic acid (Asp-5) in the novel motif (PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP), these hydrogen bonds are probably retained and function to sustain the motif's conformation. Interactions in which the First Half of the UBPY Peptide Is Involved—Superposition of a quintessential complex, SEM-5-Sos, on the STAM2-UBPY complex shows that the overall position of the first half of the UBPY peptide (1TPMVNR6) is similar to that of the Sos peptide (1PPPVPPR7: class II). 1TPMV4 residues and the tip of the Arg-6 side chain overlap with Sos residues (Fig. 2, C and E). The first two residues (Thr-1/Pro-2) and Val-4 of the UBPY peptide function in the same way as the first ϕP di-peptide unit and second ϕ of the ϕPXϕP motifs. Two hydrogen bonds connecting Arg-6 with Glu-220 in the RT loop contribute to binding by electrostatic interactions (Fig. 3A). However, because the novel motif lacks a residue corresponding to the second proline in the ϕPXϕP motif, the UBPY peptide binds more loosely around Asn-5 than the Sos peptide (Fig. 2E). Thus, it is expected that the binding of TPMVNR is not as tight as that of ϕPXϕPXR (class II). In fact, this observation is consistent with a study conducted on the interaction between Grb2 SH3(C) and Gab1-derived peptides containing the novel motif in which the first half of the motif is required but not sufficient for binding to Grb2 SH3(C) (10Lock L.S. Royal I. Naujokas M.A. Park M. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 31536-31545Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (146) Google Scholar). Comparison with the “Second Pocket” of the Gads SH3(C) Domain—Recognition of I4 in the SLP-76 peptide (1APSIDRSTKPA11) by Gads SH3(C) is achieved in a remarkable way. The Ile-4 fits into the hydrophobic pocket (referred to as the second pocket; Ref. 17Liu Q. Berry D. Nash P. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Li S.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) formed by Glu-275, Ser-299, Trp-300, Pro-313, and Asn-315 (Tyr-316 is not involved in this pocket, different from the original description; Ref. 17Liu Q. Berry D. Nash P. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Li S.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) (Fig. 4C). Although this area is usually a binding site for the second ϕP di-peptide of the ϕPXϕP motif, one notable feature of Gads SH3(C) is that the pocket is enclosed on one side by the Glu-275 side chain, resulting in a smaller pocket. Liu et al. (17Liu Q. Berry D. Nash P. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Li S.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar) explained that this pocket is too small to accommodate a ϕP unit and is, therefore, not a favorable binding site for ϕPXϕP ligands. In fact, the Sos-derived peptide (class II) has a 47-times lower affinity for Gads SH3(C) than does the SLP-76 peptide. However, the Glu-214 side chain of the STAM2 SH3 domain, corresponding to the Glu-275 of Gads, extrudes to solvent and does not interfere with the second ϕP di-peptide binding region (Fig. 4A). The direction of phenylalanine side chains are also opposite. The phenylalanine corresponding to Phe-213 of STAM2 or Phe-274 of Gads is one of the most conserved residues in the hydrophobic core of the SH3 domain (32Larson S.M. Davidson A.R. Protein Sci. 2000; 9: 2170-2180Crossref PubMed Scopus (135) Google Scholar). Here, Phe-213 of STAM2 SH3 contributes to hydrophobic core formation, whereas, surprisingly, the corresponding Phe-274 of Gads SH3(C) is exposed to solvent. In short, the positions of the Phe-Glu pair are exchanged in the STAM2 and Gads SH3 domains. Fig. 4A shows that, if a UBPY peptide binds to Gads SH3(C), the position of UBPY Val-4 would be too close to Glu-275 of Gads, and UBPY would be repelled by steric repulsion. This finding demonstrates the highly specific ligand recognition ability of the Gads SH3 domain, whereas the STAM2 SH3 domain maintains lower recognition ability, much like that of ordinary SH3 domains. Association with a ϕPXϕP Peptide—The modesty of STAM2 SH3 domain should not be treated as a disadvantageous property, as weak, transient interactions play a significant role in signal transduction. This property may allow other ligand proteins to bind to the STAM SH3 domain. To verify the proposal that STAM2 SH3 recognizes the PPII helix conformation, a binding experiment with synthetic poly-l-proline peptides (19Lim W.A. Fox R.O. Richards F.M. Protein Sci. 1994; 3: 1261-1266Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) was conducted (Fig. 1B). Next, we prepared a peptide, RKRPPPPPP, originally found in yeast Ubp7 (see beginning of text). Although there has been no evidence that this sequence is related to SH3 domains, we selected it because it seems to be the most viable candidate in the Ubp7 sequence as a ϕPXϕP sequence. The STAM2 SH3 domain weakly associates with this class I (+XϕPXϕP) peptide (KD = 74 μm) (Fig. 1A). This result indicates that STAM2 may interact with normal ϕPXϕP ligands in vivo. Structural Basis for Understanding the Differences in Binding Affinity—As described above, neither STAM2 SH3 nor Grb2 SH3(C) are as tightly bound to the novel motif as Gads SH3(C). The exchange of the Phe-Glu positions may play a significant role in the difference of affinity. The Gads SH3(C) domain provides a deep pocket to catch Ile-4 of SLP-76 with adjacent Glu-275 side chains, resulting in a significantly stronger binding (Fig. 4C). Contrastingly, the corresponding region of STAM2 SH3 where Val-4 of the UBPY peptide binds is rather flat and there is no pocket (Fig. 4B). This is also true with the surface region of SEM-5 SH3, where the ligand valine (the second ϕ in the ϕPXϕP) is positioned (Fig. 4D). As a result of the exchange of the Phe and Glu positions in the Gads SH3(C) domain, the interacting surface area between the side chain of Ile-4 and Gads extends to 235 Å2, whereas it is only 150 Å2 in the Val-4-STAM2 interaction. This suggests that, unlike the Gads SH3(C) domain, no evolutionary change favoring a higher affinity has occurred at the Val-4/Ile-4 binding site in either the STAM2 SH3 or Grb2 SH3(C) domains. The Lysine-specific Interactions—The most notable structural feature of the novel motif is the 310 helix of the RXXK (6RENK9 of UBPY) region. This helix enables Arg-6 and Lys-9 side chains to extend in parallel toward the RT loop establishing widespread electrostatic interactions (Fig. 2A) (17Liu Q. Berry D. Nash P. Pawson T. McGlade C.J. Li S.S. Mol. Cell. 2003; 11: 471-481Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar). In the present crystal structure, static hydrogen bonds can be identified. In addition to an extensive hydrophobic interaction with Trp-239, the Lys-9 side chain specifically binds to the STAM2 SH3 surface by hydrogen bonds connecting Lys-9 with a triad of oxygen atoms from the side chains of Glu-217, Gln-219, and Glu-220 (Fig. 3B). This interaction resembles that of the c-Crk SH3(C)-ligand (C3G peptide: PPPALPPKKR) complex, in which the corresponding basic (+) residue in ϕPXϕPX+ (class II) is not an arginine but a lysine (underlined in the above C3G sequence) (Fig. 3C) (31Wu X. Knudsen B. Feller S.M. Zheng J. Sali A. Cowburn D. Hanafusa H. Kuriyan J. Structure. 1995; 3: 215-226Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (216) Google Scholar). Superposition of the C3G peptide on the STAM2-UBPY complex shows that the positions of the lysine amino groups correspond to one another (Fig. 2C). Thus, each of the basic residues in the RXXK region is thought to function in an equivalent manner as the residues present at the P-3 position of usual motifs (Fig. 2F). Despite the electrostatic interactions achieved by the RXXK region, which are thought to contribute to the increase in affinity between the novel motif and the SH3 domains, the interaction between STAM2 SH3 and the UBPY peptide is weak (KD = 27 μm). This result may be explained by the fact that the novel motif lacks the residue corresponding to the second proline in ϕPXϕP, which causes the UBPY peptide to bind loosely around Asn-5 than a ϕPXϕP peptide (Fig. 2E) and offsets the advantageous two-sword interaction accomplished by the Arg-6 and Lys-9 side chains. The dynamic association as well as dissociation of intracellular signaling components is indispensable in accurately transmitting signals. High affinity interaction ensures tight association of signaling molecules, whereas low affinity interaction causes transient association of molecules with broader specificity. Interaction mediated through SH3 domains is generally modest in nature, resulting in construction of an entangled network of signaling molecules (1Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 3Tong A.H. Drees B. Nardelli G. Bader G.D. Brannetti B. Castagnoli L. Evangelista M. Ferracuti S. Nelson B. Paoluzi S. Quondam M. Zucconi A. Hogue C.W. Fields S. Boone C. Cesareni G. Science. 2002; 295: 321-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (581) Google Scholar). The physiological significance of such a moderate interaction has recently been discussed (1Mayer B.J. J. Cell Sci. 2001; 114: 1253-1263Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Binding partner proteins for an SH3 domain is not necessarily fixed beforehand but can be selected based on cellular contents, especially on local concentrations of SH3 domains and their ligands (34Inagaki F. Tanpakushitsu Kakusan Koso. 1999; 44: 355-367PubMed Google Scholar). The STAM2 SH3 domain has been reported to favor ligands with a PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP sequence (9Kato M. Miyazawa K. Kitamura N. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 37481-37487Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar), which we were able to confirm structurally in the present study. Nevertheless, we also found that the STAM2 SH3 domain does not destroy the surface structure of the ligand-binding site suited for binding ϕPXϕP ligands. This was confirmed by fluorescent spectroscopy data. These results further suggested that STAM2 SH3 may interact with ϕPXϕP ligands, although no ligands other than UBPY have been identified in vivo thus far. Endosomal localization of STAM2 (35Mizuno E. Kawahata K. Kato M. Kitamura N. Komada M. Mol. Biol. Cell. 2003; 14: 3675-3689Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) may restrict the ligands that can interact with STAM2. One may suppose that unique motifs exist to offer specific interactions, which are exhibited in the interaction with the Gads SH3(C) domain. However, the interactions with the STAM2 SH3 domain as well as with the Grb2 SH3(C) domain are not extraordinary in terms of their moderate association affinity. Non-PXXP ligand sequences other than PX(V/I)(D/N)RXXKP, such as PXXDY or RKXXYXXY, have also been reported (36Mongiovi A.M. Romano P.R. Panni S. Mendoza M. Wong W.T. Musacchio A. Cesareni G.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 2889-2899Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). Again, in both cases, interactions with SH3 domains are moderate, as indicated by their KD values (20–60 μm). As a consequence, unique motifs do not necessarily contribute directly to the increase in affinity of SH3 domains. Structural analysis of the STAM2 SH3 domain confirmed the specialty intrinsic to the preceding structure of the Gads SH3(C) domain. As complete exposure of the conserved phenylalanine (Phe-274 of Gads) to solvent is exceptional and appears to be energetically unfavorable, there should have been strong evolutionary pressure for increasing the affinity between Gads SH3(C) and its ligand protein, SLP-76. On the contrary, the STAM2 SH3 domain is designed for moderate and transient association with UBPY, and also implies some potential to do something with unknown ligand proteins.

In the mouse, Lis1 also interacts with the nuclear migration proteins NUDC (36Morris S.M. Albrecht U. Reiner O. Eichele G. Yu-Lee L.Y. Curr. Biol. 1998; 8: 603-606Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (122) Google Scholar) and mNudE-L (37Sweeney K.J. Prokscha A. Eichele G. Mech. Dev. 2001; 101: 21-33Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) suggesting a similar role. Abrogation of lis-1 in C. elegans results in embryonic lethality, sterility, altered vulval morphology, uncoordinated movement, and nuclear positioning defects during early embryonic cell divisions (31Dawe A.L. Caldwell K.A. Harris P.M. Morris N.R. Caldwell G.A. Dev. Genes Evol. 2001; 211: 434-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Lis1 in Drosophila is also essential for normal development (32Liu Z. Xie T. Steward R. Development. 1999; 126: 4477-4488PubMed Google Scholar). Ovarian mutant clones of Lis1 in the fly indicated that it is required for germ line cell division and oocyte differentiation, supporting the notion that Lis1 interacts with the dynein complex to regulate the function of the membrane skeleton, necessary for nuclear and neuronal migration. Lis1 also functions in dendritic elaboration and axonal transport in Drosophila and in cultured neurons (38Liu Z. Steward R. Luo L. Nat. Cell Biol. 2000; 2: 776-783Crossref PubMed Scopus (181) Google Scholar). Collectively, these data argue that Lis1 has been highly conserved during evolution and may exert similar cellular functions in various developmental processes. Murine Lis1 mRNA is widely expressed in many cell types, but certain splicing and polyadenylation variants are differentially found in adult brain, heart, and testis (39Peterfy M. Gyuris T. Grosshans D. Cuaresma C.C. Takacs L. Genomics. 1998; 47: 200-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar). Particularly in testis, an alternatively spliced transcript exists that contains the additional exon 2a as part of the 5′-untranslated leader sequence. The functional role of Lis1 in organs other than brain has not been determined, partly due to early embryonic lethality of Lis1-null mutants. We have taken advantage of a gene trap mouse line that carries a mutagenic insertion within the LIS1 gene causing selective disruption of a testis-specific Lis1 transcript. This permitted us to explore the role of Lis1 in the male germ line. Here we report that Lis1-deficient male mice are infertile, whereas females show normal fertility. The defect in spermatogenesis leads to a blockade of spermatid differentiation and severely distorted tissue architecture of the seminiferous tubules. Mutant spermatids fail to form correct acrosomes and frequently do not undergo appropriate nuclear condensation. The mutant phenotype also presents significantly increased apoptosis of germ cells in adult testis. Thus, our results reveal a unique and novel function of Lis1 in spermatogenesis. Generation of the LIS1 Gene Trap Mouse—The exon gene trap vector pKC421 was constructed from the plasmid pGT1.8 IRESβgeo (52Mountford P. Zevnik B. Duwel A. Nichols J. Li M. Dani C. Robertson M. Chambers I. Smith A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 4303-4307Crossref PubMed Scopus (284) Google Scholar) by deletion of the engrailed 2 (En-2) splice acceptor site with BamHI/BglII digestion and by removal of an SalI site downstream of theSV40 poly (A) addition signal. The ES cell line 2A-53 containing an insertion of the gene trap vector within the LIS1 gene was generated as described previously (53Chowdhury K. Bonaldo P. Torres M. Stoykova A. Gruss P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). The 129/Sv-derived ES cell clone was used in morula aggregations according to published procedures to obtain chimeric male founders that were mated with outbred NMRI females (53Chowdhury K. Bonaldo P. Torres M. Stoykova A. Gruss P. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 1531-1536Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar). Heterozygous progeny was mated to maintain the allele. For genotyping by Southern blot analysis, DNA was extracted from tail biopsies and digested with SacI restriction enzyme. Blots on Hybond N membranes (Amersham Biosciences, Freiburg, Germany) were hybridized in 6× SSC, 5× Denhardt's, 0.1% SDS, 100 μg/ml denatured salmon sperm DNA at 65 °C overnight using an SacI/fragment of the second intron of the LIS1 gene as probe (see Fig. 1). Hybridized filters were washed twice at 65 °C with 0.2× SSC containing 0.1% SDS. Wild type and mutant alleles are represented by 4.3- and 8-kb SacI fragments, respectively. Construction of Genomic Phage Library—To clone the site of vector integration, a genomic phage library of a heterozygous mouse was generated in the λDASH-II vector (Stratagene) according to standard procedures. Two independent recombinant phage clones carrying inserts of 21 and 17.2 kb were isolated with LacZ- and neo-specific hybridization probes. Regions flanking the integrated vector were sequenced and searched using Blast against mouse genome databases. Northern Blot Analysis—Total RNA was isolated from testis and brain of wild type and mutant mice at various postnatal stages using the Total RNA Isolation Reagent (Biomol) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA samples (30 μg) were denatured at 65 °C for 10 min in loading buffer (50% formamide, 13 Mops buffer, 6.5% formaldehyde) and run on 0.8% agarose gels containing 0.12% formaldehyde. Electrophoresis and RNA blotting was performed according to standard procedures (54Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Second Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar). Blots were hybridized with radioactively labeled testis-specific Lis1 cDNA. The human elongation factor 2 cDNA probe was used as loading control (55Rapp G. Klaudiny J. Hagendorff G. Luck M.R. Scheit K.H. Biol. Chem. Hoppe.-Seyler. 1989; 370: 1071-1075Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar). RT-PCR Analysis—Total RNA (1 μg) was reverse-transcribed in a final volume of 20 μl containing 200 units of Superscript reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), 40 units of RNasin (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany), and oligo-dT primer. PCR was carried out with 2 μl of cDNA, 10 pmol each of forward and reverse primers, and 3 units of Taq polymerase. Cycling condition were 94 °C, 58 °C, and 68 °C for 30 s each. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase was used as internal control. The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 5′ primer was 5′-ACC ACA GTC CAT GCC ATC AC-3′; the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 3′ primer was 5′-TCC ACC ACC CTG TTG CTG TA-3′. Western Blot Analysis—Protein extracts from testis and brain were prepared in SE buffer containing 0.32 mol/liter sucrose, 1 mmol of EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol. For electrophoresis samples (50 μg/lane) were boiled for 10 min, briefly spun down at 500 rpm, and loaded onto an 8% polyacrylamide gel. Proteins were blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Roche Applied Science) and probed with goat polyclonal anti-Lis-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) and rabbit polyclonal α-tubulin antibody (Sigma-Aldrich) as internal reference. Antibody reactions were visualized on filters with a 1:10,000 dilution of alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-goat or anti-rabbit immunoglobulin (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated in 0.35 mg/ml nitro blue tetrazolium and 0.18 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-indolylphosphate substrate. Analysis of Fertility—Reproductive capacity of Lis-1GT/GT and Lis-1+/GT males was determined by breeding with wild type and mutant females. Ten males of each genotype were mated with females for 6 months. Females were checked for vaginal plugs every day and separated for 21 days when positive. The total number of vaginal plugs and born offspring was counted for each male during the entire investigation period. Histology—Testis and epididymis from mice of different postnatal age were fixed in Bouin's fixative for 48 h at room temperature. The fixative was removed with 70% ethanol for 2-3 days, and tissues were embedded in paraffin. Mounted sections (4-6 mm) were deparaffinized, rehydrated, and stained with hematoxylin-eosin, or used for immunohistochemistry. Spermatozoa were prepared and resuspended in PBS. Air-dried smears were fixed in methanol/acetone (1:1) for 5 min and used for immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemistry—Spermatozoa smears and sections of testis were incubated for 16-18 h at 4 °C with one of the following antibodies in a 1:200 dilution: goat anti-Lis-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), rabbit anti-OAM antibody (outer acrosomal membrane), rabbit anti-acrosin antibody, rabbit anti-Tnp-2 antibody, goat anti-HSP90α antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). For co-localization studies, sperm smears were incubated with a 1:200 dilution of anti-Lis-1 antibody and a 1:300 dilution of rabbit anti-OAM or rabbit anti-acrosin antibodies. Slides were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for several hours at room temperature with 1:100 dilution of fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie, Deisenhofen, Germany). Double immunostainings were performed with a mixture of 1:100 fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Cy3-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG (Sigma-Aldrich). After three further washes with PBS, slides were mounted in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole mounting solution (Vector Laboratories Inc., Burlingame, CA). Electron Microscopy—For conventional electron microscopy, mouse testis was fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and 3.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 8-12 h. Fixed testes were cut into small pieces and thoroughly washed over 3-4 days at 4 °C in 0.1 m cacodylate buffer containing 0.1 m saccharose. Tissue fragments were then treated with 1% OsO4 in cacodylate buffer for 2 h, washed three times, dehydrated, and embedded in epoxy resin. Ultrathin sections were contrasted using uranyl acetate and lead citrate and examined with a Leo 906 electron microscope. For immunoelectron microscopy wild type testes fragments were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer for 4 h. Specimens were washed in 0.1 m phosphate buffer supplemented with 7% sucrose, subsequently dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, and embedded in LR White resin. Ultrathin sections were blocked in 2% bovine serum albumin and 0.04 m glycine in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. The anti-Lis-1 antibody was incubated at room temperature for 1 h at a 1:200 dilution in 2% bovine serum albumin in PBS. After thorough washing, specimens were decorated with the rabbit anti-goat secondary antibody coated on 15-nm colloidal gold particles (dilution 1:20; Biocell) for 1 h. Finally, the sections were contrasted with 10% uranyl acetate for 20 min in the dark. Omission of the primary antibody served as a negative control. Nuclear DNA Fragmentation Labeling (TUNEL)—Testes were removed from 90-day-old wild type and Lis-1GT/GT mice, fixed in formalin solution, embedded in paraffin, and cut into 5-μm sections on which hematoxylin-eosin stainings and TUNEL assays were performed. To determine apoptotic cells sections were dewaxed prior to digestion with 0.7 unit/ml proteinase K (Sigma, Deisenhofen/Germany) in Tris-buffered saline (50 mm Tris-HCl, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.5, TBS), supplemented with 2 mm CaCl2. Sections were then incubated in TBS containing 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and 0.3% H2O2 to block endogenous peroxidase activity. Subsequently, slides were rinsed with TBS and incubated for 60 min at 37 °C in reaction buffer for terminal transferase (Roche Applied Science, Germany), containing 50 μl of labeling buffer (250 units/ml terminal transferase, 20 μl/ml 10× digoxigenin-DNA labeling mix, and 1 mm CoCl2). After labeling, sections were washed in TBS, blocked with 10% FCS (Roche Applied Science) for 15 min, and then incubated with a rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab)2 fragment against digoxigenin (Dako/Hamburg, Germany) for 60 min. The horseradish peroxidase-conjugated F(ab)2 fragment was applied in a 1:200 dilution with TBS containing 10% FCS. Nuclear signals were visualized using 3,3′-diaminobenzidine. Negative controls were performed without terminal transferase. Lymph nodes with reactive follicular hyperplasia were used as positive control. Statistical significance of the obtained data was determined using the Man Whitney U test with p < 0.05 considered to be significant. Integration of a Gene Trap Vector in the LIS1 Locus Results in Male Infertility—In a gene trap approach using an exon trap vector, we isolated the embryonic stem (ES) cell clone 2A-53 from which a stable mouse line was generated. The trapped gene was most abundantly expressed in heart, neural tube, brain, and dorsal root ganglia during embryogenesis (Fig. 1C). 5′ Rapid amplification of cDNA ends from known vector sequences failed to identify a fusion transcript in RNA from heart and brain. Therefore, the gene trap vector, including flanking genomic sequences, was cloned. Sequence analysis of two independently isolated phage clones showed that the exon trap vector had unintentionally integrated in the second intron of the mouse LIS1 gene (Fig. 1A). RT-PCR on RNA from the ES cell clone 2A-53 identified a transcript containing the second exon of the LIS1 gene spliced to a cryptic splice acceptor site present within the internal ribosomal entry site sequence of the vector. This aberrant splicing event generates the β-Geo mRNA and explains why the trapped ES cell clone could be obtained under Geneticin selection. We next generated mice homozygous for the gene trap integration (Lis1GT/GT). Offspring of heterozygous parents displayed normal Mendelian distribution of genotypes and no apparent pathological phenotype (Fig. 1B). In particular, Nissl staining of brains from adult mutants failed to show any signs of lissencephaly and compound heterozygotes with a Lis1-defective allele had no augmentation of the brain phenotype (data not shown). These observations suggested that the gene trap insertion had not generally disrupted the LIS1 gene. However, subsequent breeding indicated that homozygous mutant males were consistently infertile, whereas mutant females reproduced normally (Table I). Mating with homozygous males yielded vaginal plugs, but sperm could not be recovered from the uterus and no pregnancies were recorded. In line with this result, we found that testes of homozygous males were considerably smaller (∼50%) and the epididymis contained essentially no spermatozoa (Fig. 2A). To determine the onset of the phenotype in mutant mice, we histologically evaluated testes from postnatal days 15-90 (P15-P90). Sections of mutant testis initially (P14-P45) exhibited intact seminiferous tubules of normal diameter and germ cells as well as Sertoli and Leydig cells present at the appropriate locations (Fig. 2B). Notably, spermatogonia at the lamina propria, spermatocytes of the post-pachytene stage, and round spermatids at the luminal side of seminiferous tubules were observed until P45 when elongating spermatids begin to accumulate in the inner lining of the seminiferous epithelium. At postnatal P90, however, round and elongating spermatids were released prematurely from the epithelium and located inside the lumen of tubules, in contrast, to wild type spermatids assembling correctly at the luminal surface of seminiferous tubules. At this postnatal stage also the tubular structure seemed to have collapsed in the mutant, lacking the epithelial architecture and a clearly visible lumen. Moreover, only very few spermatozoa were present in mutant testis as compared with wild type (Fig. 2B) and the residual ones appeared in small clusters and frequently abnormal (data not shown). These results then suggested that the gene trap mutation affected the maintenance phase of spermatogenesis, including terminal differentiation of spermatids, but apparently did not interfere with the initiation phase up to the generation of spermatids. To determine the distribution of sperm progenitor cells in a more quantitative fashion, we investigated the expression of the spermatocyte-specific marker transcripts, testis-specific phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk-2) (40Boer P.H. Adra C.N. Lau Y.F. McBurney M.W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 3107-3112Crossref PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar), and proacrosin (ACR) (41Kremling H. Keime S. Wilhelm K. Adham I.M. Hameister H.

As shown in Fig. 2C, all transcripts were expressed at similar levels in wild type and mutant animals confirming that germ cell progenitors, including spermatids, were normally formed. From these results we concluded that the gene trap mutation causes a blockade of late spermatid differentiation resulting in a severe reduction of mature gametes. However, Lis1 is not essential for testis development, because testis histology during early postnatal stages appeared normal in the mutant and spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and round spermatids were formed in seminiferous tubules, whereas the late transition to spermatozoa essentially failed to occur.Table IFertility of wild type, LIS1+/GT, and LIS1GT/GT mutant miceMating of genotypesMaleaAge-matched 3- to 9-month-old animals were used for crossingFemaleaAge-matched 3- to 9-month-old animals were used for crossingMice bornLitter sizebMean of more than 20 littersLIS+/+LIS+/+1687.3LIS+/+LIS1+/GT1766.6LIS+/+LIS1GT/GT1917.6LIS1+/GTLIS+/+1597.1LIS1GT/GTLIS+/+00a Age-matched 3- to 9-month-old animals were used for crossingb Mean of more than 20 litters Open table in a new tab"

https://openalex.org/W2117661407,"Autocatalytic cleavage of lithostathine leads to the formation of quadruple-helical fibrils (QHF-litho) that are present in Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that such fibrils also occur in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker diseases, where they form protease-K-resistant deposits and co-localize with amyloid plaques formed from prion protein. Lithostathine does not appear to change its native-like, globular structure during fibril formation. However, we obtained evidence that a cluster of six conserved tryptophans, positioned around a surface loop, could act as a mobile structural element that can be swapped between adjacent protein molecules, thereby enabling the formation of higher order fibril bundles. Despite their association with these clinical amyloid deposits, QHF-litho differ from typical amyloid fibrils in several ways, for example they produce a different infrared spectrum and cannot bind Congo Red, suggesting that they may not represent amyloid structures themselves. Instead, we suggest that lithostathine constitutes a novel component decorating disease-associated amyloid fibrils. Interestingly, [6,6′]bibenzothiazolyl-2,2′-diamine, an agent found previously to disrupt aggregates of huntingtin associated with Huntington's disease, can dissociate lithostathine bundles into individual protofilaments. Disrupting QHF-litho fibrils could therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy to combat clinical amyloidoses. Autocatalytic cleavage of lithostathine leads to the formation of quadruple-helical fibrils (QHF-litho) that are present in Alzheimer's disease. Here we show that such fibrils also occur in Creutzfeldt-Jakob and Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker diseases, where they form protease-K-resistant deposits and co-localize with amyloid plaques formed from prion protein. Lithostathine does not appear to change its native-like, globular structure during fibril formation. However, we obtained evidence that a cluster of six conserved tryptophans, positioned around a surface loop, could act as a mobile structural element that can be swapped between adjacent protein molecules, thereby enabling the formation of higher order fibril bundles. Despite their association with these clinical amyloid deposits, QHF-litho differ from typical amyloid fibrils in several ways, for example they produce a different infrared spectrum and cannot bind Congo Red, suggesting that they may not represent amyloid structures themselves. Instead, we suggest that lithostathine constitutes a novel component decorating disease-associated amyloid fibrils. Interestingly, [6,6′]bibenzothiazolyl-2,2′-diamine, an agent found previously to disrupt aggregates of huntingtin associated with Huntington's disease, can dissociate lithostathine bundles into individual protofilaments. Disrupting QHF-litho fibrils could therefore represent a novel therapeutic strategy to combat clinical amyloidoses. The pathological hallmarks of many neurodegenerative diseases are fibrillar deposits of proteins and polypeptides in brain. Many of these deposits are characterized by histochemical staining properties similar to those of starch and hence were called amyloid structures. Although the causal relationship between fibrillar deposits and pathogenesis has not yet been established in all cases, there is increasing evidence that these fibrils can exert a deleterious effect. Their clinical relevance has been shown for instance in cataract formation (1Sandilands A. Hutcheson A.M. Long H.A. Prescott A.R. Vrensen G. Loster J. Klopp N. Lutz R.B. Graw J. Masaki S. Dobson C.M. MacPhee C.E. Quinlan R.A. EMBO J. 2002; 21: 6005-6014Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar) and in familial encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusions (2Davis R.L. Shrimpton A.E. Holohan P.D. Bradshaw C. Feiglin D. Collins G.H. Sonderegger P. Kinter J. Becker L.M. Lacbawan F. Krasnewich D. Muenke M. Lawrence D.A. Yerby M.S. Shaw C.M. Gooptu B. Elliott P.R. Finch J.T. Carrell R.W. Lomas D.A. Nature. 1999; 401: 376-379Crossref PubMed Google Scholar); also, it is highly likely in early onset Parkinson's disease (3Conway K.A. Harper J.D. Lansbury Jr., P.T. Nat. Med. 1998; 4: 1318-1320Crossref PubMed Scopus (1270) Google Scholar). In addition, there are some recurring correlations between fibrillar pathologies and disease-associated mutations, as in some familial systemic amyloidoses, Huntington's disease, and early onset Parkinson's disease (4Lansbury Jr., P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1999; 96: 3342-3344Crossref PubMed Scopus (514) Google Scholar). These correlations strongly suggest that fibril formation initiates the pathological events and that it is not an unavoidable epiphenomenon. In addition, the early aggregates of disease-associated polypeptides have been shown to be cytotoxic (5Bucciantini M. Giannoni E. Chiti F. Baroni F. Formigli L. Zurdo J. Taddei N. Ramponi G. Dobson C.M. Stefani M. Nature. 2002; 416: 507-511Crossref PubMed Scopus (2163) Google Scholar, 6Walsh D.M. Klyubin I. Fadeeva J.V. Cullen W.K. Anwyl R. Wolfe M.S. Rowan M.J. Selkoe D.J. Nature. 2002; 416: 535-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (3719) Google Scholar). Understanding the process of fibril formation and the means by which amyloid deposits can be cleared in vivo therefore represent two major scientific challenges. Among proteins that form clinical fibril deposits, we have been working on lithostathine. We have studied its physical characteristics and observed that it readily polymerizes into fibrils after self-proteolysis of its N-terminal undecapeptide (7Cerini C. Peyrot V. Garnier C. Duplan L. Veesler S. Le Caer J.P. Bernard J.P. Bouteille H. Michel R. Vazi A. Dupuy P. Michel B. Berland Y. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22266-22274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). On the basis of the x-ray structure of the monomer (8Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar) and high resolution electron microscopy, we showed that fibrils formed a quadruple-helical filament (QHF-litho 1The abbreviations used are: QHF-lithoquadruple-helical filaments of lithostathineCJDCreutzfeldt-Jakob diseaseCRCongo RedFTIRFourier-transformed infrared spectroscopyMALDI-TOFmatrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometryPGL-034[6,6′]bibenzothiazolyl-2,2′-diamine.; see Ref. 9Gregoire C.

Interestingly, these fibrils were found to be present in the pathological lesions of Alzheimer's disease (senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles), and it is overexpressed during the very early stages of the disease before clinical signs appear (10Duplan L. Michel B. Boucraut J. Barthellemy S. Desplat-Jego S. Marin V. Gambarelli D. Bernard D. Berthezene P. Alescio-Lautier B. Verdier J.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). We therefore believe that lithostathine constitutes an important protein to investigate to understand the deposition of polypeptides in vivo in relation to neurodegenerative diseases. It has remained unclear, however, whether stacking involves conformational changes comparable with those occurring during PrPsc (prion “scrapie”) formation (11Baldwin M.A. Pan K.M. Nguyen J. Huang Z. Groth D. Serban A. Gasset M. Mehlhorn I. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. et al.Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1994; 343: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar), whether these fibrils are amyloid in nature, and how fibrils stack together to produce large fibers. In this paper, we have used Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, circular dichroism, optical absorbance, mass spectrometry, atomic force microscopy, molecular modeling studies, and immunohistochemistry to explore the structural characteristics of lithostathine fibrils, the formation of large fibers, and strategies by which this process can be disturbed. In particular, we have been interested in their potential structural and clinical relation to amyloid diseases, most notably Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). quadruple-helical filaments of lithostathine Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease Congo Red Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight spectrometry [6,6′]bibenzothiazolyl-2,2′-diamine. Recombinant Lithostathine—Lithostathine was prepared as described previously (7Cerini C. Peyrot V. Garnier C. Duplan L. Veesler S. Le Caer J.P. Bernard J.P. Bouteille H. Michel R. Vazi A. Dupuy P. Michel B. Berland Y. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22266-22274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). In brief, recombinant lithostathine was produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells and purified on an immunoaffinity column. Lithostathine samples were then frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C until required. For experiments concerning fibril formation, 100 μg of lithostathine (1 mg/ml) was incubated in phosphate-buffered saline at 37 °C for 2 weeks. After centrifugation for 5 min at 13000 × g the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was then washed twice with water and resuspended in 100 μl of water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until required. Congo Red Binding—The capacity of lithostathine fibrils and of amyloid fibrils formed from glucagon to bind Congo Red (CR) was assessed by mixing 50-μl aliquots of solutions containing amyloid fibrils from glucagon with 450 μl of a 20 μm solution of the dye in 1 m Tris-Cl at pH 7.4. The final polypeptide concentrations were as indicated in the plot. The stock solution containing glucagons amyloid fibrils was prepared by incubating glucagon at a concentration of 1 mg/ml in 50 mm sodium phosphate, pH 2.5, at room temperature for 2 weeks. Lithostathine fibrils were prepared from stock solution (1 mg/ml) as described above. The absorption measurements were carried out at room temperature in a Cary 3 UV-visible spectrophotometer (Varian Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) Experiments—FTIR spectra were recorded on a Bruker IFS28 spectrometer equipped with a liquid nitrogen-cooled MTC detector (Bruker Optics Inc., Billerica, MA). The spectra (1000-2000 scans) were recorded at a spectral resolution of 4 cm-1 and were analyzed using the OPUS/IR2 program (Bruker). To compare soluble and fibrillar lithostathine, spectra were recorded with dry samples. For this purpose, samples were deposited on to fluorine plates, and the solvent was allowed to evaporate. Spectroscopic Studies—Baseline-corrected absorbance spectra in the range of 275 to 300 nm were recorded at 37 °C with a Cary 3E spectrophotometer (Varian Inc.) characterized by a high spectral reproducibility (S.D. < 0.02 nm). Data acquisition was in steps of 0.1 nm with an acquisition time of 1 s per data point. The instrument was equipped with a home-built double sample compartment, thermostated with a Haake F3-Q circulating water bath (Thermo Haake, Karlsruhe, Germany). Protein incubation was performed in a 1-ml, 1-cm light path quartz cuvette under the following conditions: 0.47 mg/ml lithostathine in 0.5 m Tris·Cl, pH 8. The fourth derivatives of the UV spectra were evaluated with the optimized spectral shift method as described previously (12Lange R. Frank J. Saldana J.L. Balny C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 277-283Google Scholar) with an automated transform program designed in the laboratory. MALDI-TOF Mass Spectrometry—MALDI-TOF analyses were performed using a Voyager DE-STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems, Framingham, MA). The instrument was calibrated using superoxide dismutase (22951) and cytochrome c (12361) at 4 × 10-11m and 10-9m, respectively. An α-cyano-4-hydroxy-cinnamic acid matrix solution was prepared as a saturated solution in 50% acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 0.5-μl aliquots of a lithostathine solution (1.2 mg/ml) in 20 mm phosphate buffer, pH 8, were deposited directly on the sample plate. 0.5-μl aliquots of the matrix solution were then pipetted onto each drop, which was then allowed to dry. Positive-ion mass spectra were collected in reflectron mode at an acceleration voltage of 25 kV and an extraction delay time of 350 ns. Raw data were analyzed and processed using Grams software (PerSeptive Biosystems). Electronic Microscopy Studies—A solution of lithostathine (50 ng/μl) in 100 mm Tris·Cl, pH 7.5, was mixed with a trypsin solution (2.5 ng/ml) and left for 5 min at room temperature, and [6,6′]bibenzothiazolyl-2,2′-diamine (PGL-034; Merck KgaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was then added (1 μl in 100% Me2SO, final concentration 20 μm). The mixture was incubated at 37 °C for 16 h. Samples were then stained successively with 1% uranyl acetate for 1 min. The molar ratio of lithostathine/PGL-034 was 3/20, slightly more than used previously for EM analysis of PGL-034 with hungtingtin (1.5/20; see Ref. 13Heiser V. Engemann S. Brocker W. Dunkel I. Boeddrich A. Waelter S. Nordhoff E. Lurz R. Schugardt N. Rautenberg S. Herhaus C. Barnickel G. Bottcher H. Lehrach H. Wanker E.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2002; 99: 16400-16406Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar). The final preparation was then viewed on a Philips CM100 EM (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR). Immunohistochemistry—Brain slices (8 μm) were collected onto pre-treated glass slides (Super Frost® Plus; Menzel-Glaser, Braunscheig, Germany) and baked over 1 week at 57 °C. The slides were then dewaxed and used for immunochemistry. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inhibited with 1% H2O2 in Tris-buffered saline for 30 min at room temperature. Slides were then further incubated for 30 min in 20% goat serum, 0.3% Triton in Tris-buffered saline to block nonspecific antigenic sites. Specific polyclonal antibodies to lithostathine (Romeo; see Ref. 10Duplan L. Michel B. Boucraut J. Barthellemy S. Desplat-Jego S. Marin V. Gambarelli D. Bernard D. Berthezene P. Alescio-Lautier B. Verdier J.M. Neurobiol. Aging. 2001; 22: 79-88Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar) were then added at 1/100 for 6 days at 4 °C. To reveal the presence of PrPsc or resistant lithostathine deposits, some slides were submitted to drastic pre-treatment before addition of antibodies. These treatments involved a combination of chemical, physical, and enzymatic methods (14Bons N. Lehmann S. Nishida N. Mestre-Frances N. Dormont D. Belli P. Delacourte A. Grassi J. Brown P. C. R. Acad. Sci. (Paris). 2002; 325: 67-74Google Scholar) used to get rid off all the PrPc. In brief, they were incubated in 0.1% trypsin solution (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) for 5 min at 37 °C, 120 min at 121 °C in water, and finally in proteinase K (25 μg/ml; Merck) for 20 min at 37 °C. The presence of PrPsc was checked by incubating the mouse monoclonal antibody 8G8, at 1/2000, overnight at 4 °C. This antibody recognizes the human 95-110 PrP sequence. The VECTASTAIN ABC kit (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) was used for detection, using diaminobenzidine (Sigma-Aldrich) in simple staining procedures, and the VIP kit (Vector Laboratories) was used for double staining experiments. Sequence Alignment and Molecular Modeling—Multiple sequence alignment was carried out using the ClustalX program (15Thompson J.D. Gibson T.J. Plewniak F. Jeanmougin F. Higgins D.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1997; 25: 4876-4882Crossref PubMed Scopus (35619) Google Scholar) and manually improved. Swapped loop sequences of a set of C-type lectin proteins and prion protein were selected from the Protein Data Bank and aligned with the lithostathine sequence. Homology modeling of the lithostathine dimer was performed largely according to the principles outlined by Greer (16Greer J. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 239-252Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) and as previously described in detail (17Laurine E. Lafitte D. Gregoire C. Seree E. Loret E. Douillard S. Michel B. Briand C. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; Google Scholar), using the software modules InsightII, Homology, and Discover from Accelrys (San Diego, CA) and a Silicon Graphics O2 work station (SGI, Mountain View, CA). The model of the lithostathine dimer connected by a swapped loop was built from the crystal Protein Data Bank structure of flavocetin-A (1C3A; see Ref. 18Fukuda K. Mizuno H. Atoda H. Morita T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) from habu snake venom, a coagulation factor IX-binding protein heterodimer. The lithostathine dimer was then optimized with the constant valence force field. Energy minimization was carried out with the conjugate gradient algorithm, down to a maximum derivative of 0.001 kcal/Å. Lithostathine Fibrils Did Not Possess the Classical Properties of Amyloid Fibrils—To establish whether lithostatine fibrils possess the generic amyloid structure, we tested for the presence of cross-β conformation using apple green birefringence upon staining with CR and x-ray diffraction. In the light of conflicting methods used for detecting amyloid in clinical diagnosis, such as dyes of low specificity, it has been agreed by the community that in particular CR green birefringence should be an essential part of the clinical detection of amyloid structures (19Westermark P. Benson M.D. Buxbaum J.N. Cohen A.S. Frangione B. Ikeda S. Masters C.L. Merlini G. Saraiva M.J. Sipe J.D. Amyloid. 2002; 9: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Interestingly, although the morphology of lithostathine fibrils is very similar to that of many amyloid fibrils (9Gregoire C. Marco S. Thimonier J. Duplan L. Laurine E. Chauvin J.P. Michel B. Peyrot V. Verdier J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3313-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), they do not possess green birefringent properties. In fact, QHF-litho failed to even bind CR, and the dye was washed off readily from samples prepared from fibril pellets after centrifugation. The same result was obtained when we examined the CR absorption spectra in the presence of QHF-litho or glucagon fibrils that have been shown previously (20Glenner G.G. Eanes E.D. Bladen H.A. Linke R.P. Termine J.D. J. Histochem. Cytochem. 1974; 22: 1141-1158Crossref PubMed Scopus (235) Google Scholar) to be amyloid in nature. Whereas glucagon fibrils characteristically increased the CR absorption signal at 540 nm, no such effect could be detected for QHF-litho (Fig. 1A). The spectrum of QHF-litho mixed with CR had the same shape as the one recorded on the dye alone. However, a small offset value in the baseline of the two spectra was evident, presumably arising from light scattering induced by the fibrils. Consistent with this observation, we could not obtain evidence for the presence of a cross-β structure when we examined the fibril pellet with x-ray diffraction (data not shown), and also FTIR spectroscopy could not reveal aggregated β-sheet structure in QHF-litho. The sheets of amyloid or prion fibrils appear in the infrared spectrum with an amide I maximum close to 1620 cm-1 (11Baldwin M.A. Pan K.M. Nguyen J. Huang Z. Groth D. Serban A. Gasset M. Mehlhorn I. Fletterick R.J. Cohen F.E. et al.Philos. Trans. R Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci. 1994; 343: 435-441Crossref PubMed Scopus (37) Google Scholar, 21Dong A. Prestrelski S.J. Allison S.D. Carpenter J.F. J. Pharm. Sci. 1995; 84: 415-424Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar, 22Fink A.L. Folding Des. 1998; 3: R9-23Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1053) Google Scholar). In the case of QHF-litho, no such maximum could be discerned. Moreover, fibrils and the soluble protein monomers produced almost the same amide I region with a main component centered at 1650 cm-1 (Fig. 1B). These data indicate that both states of the protein contain high levels of α-helical conformation (23Haris P.I. Chapman D. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1992; 17: 328-333Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (199) Google Scholar) and that the C-terminal part of lithostathine did not undergo substantial structural transitions similar to those known to occur during amyloid fibril formation. Taken together, we conclude that if QHF-litho fibrils were amyloid structures they would represent an entirely novel and different type of amyloid fibrils, in particular one that lacks many of the properties that have so far been considered by the community to be essential for the definition of amyloid structures (19Westermark P. Benson M.D. Buxbaum J.N. Cohen A.S. Frangione B. Ikeda S. Masters C.L. Merlini G. Saraiva M.J. Sipe J.D. Amyloid. 2002; 9: 197-200Crossref PubMed Scopus (183) Google Scholar). Instead, we suggest that QHF-litho fibrils rather represent the interesting case of a disease-associated, abnormal protein fibril that is not amyloid in nature. Modification of the Environment of Tryptophan Residues Examined by UV and Fluorescence Spectroscopy—We tested, in addition, whether the formation of fibrils by lithostathine involves a more subtle structural reorganization of the protein (that maintains its secondary structure composition). Ultraviolet absorbance in the fourth derivative mode was used as an intrinsic probe for both tryptophan and tyrosine residues. This technique allows one to enhance the generally low resolution of zero-order UV absorbance spectra and to obtain information about structural changes in the local environment of tyrosine and tryptophan residues (12Lange R. Frank J. Saldana J.L. Balny C. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 277-283Google Scholar, 24Lange R. Bec N. Mozhaev V.V. Frank J. Eur. Biophys. J. 1996; 24: 284-292Crossref Scopus (60) Google Scholar). The fourth derivative UV absorbance spectra were characterized by two maxima, reflecting mainly the tyrosine environment at 284 nm and the tryptophan environment at 290.5 nm (Fig. 2). Under conditions where fibril formation occurs, i.e. incubation of lithostathine at 37 °C up to 4 days, no substantial change in the tyrosine derivative band was observed. However, the maximum of the tryptophan derivative band shifted from 290.7 to 291.8 nm, accompanied by an increase of the intensity of absorption. This significant red shift can be explained either by a decreased interaction of tryptophan residues with water molecules or by an increased interaction with other hydrophobic or aromatic residues. To distinguish between these two hypotheses we used fluorescence as an intrinsic probe of the solvent exposure of tryptophan residues. The initial fluorescence spectrum of lithostathine (t = 0) was characterized by an emission maximum at 340 nm, indicating that most of the tryptophan residues are exposed to water. This finding is in good agreement with our structural data (8Bertrand J.A. Pignol D. Bernard J.P. Verdier J.M. Dagorn J.C. Fontecilla-Camps J.C. EMBO J. 1996; 15: 2678-2684Crossref PubMed Scopus (79) Google Scholar). During fibril formation, however, the maximum emission wavelength did not change significantly, suggesting that the mean exposure of tryptophans to water is not affected. However, a 25% quenching of tryptophan fluorescence was observed during incubation, indicative of conformational rearrangements in the vicinity of tryptophan residues. Altogether, these results suggested that the shift in the absorption maximum and fluorescence quenching of tryptophan residues were the result of an increased interaction with hydrophobic or aromatic residues, which could occur during fibril formation. Dimerization of Lithostathine Preceded or Was Concomitant to Cleavage—To understand the process of fibril formation and, hence, the mode of interaction between the protein molecules within the fibril, we have examined the early events in fibril formation using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. As reported previously (7Cerini C. Peyrot V. Garnier C. Duplan L. Veesler S. Le Caer J.P. Bernard J.P. Bouteille H. Michel R. Vazi A. Dupuy P. Michel B. Berland Y. Verdier J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 22266-22274Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar), fibril formation depends on the self-cleavage of lithostathine, resulting in the release of an N-terminal undecapeptide from the C-terminal protein domain, which represents the precursor of lithostathine fibrils. The mass spectrum recorded at t = 0 (Fig. 3A), in the 1000 to 25000-Da mass range, contained a single charge state series at mass/charge (m/z) values of 16612.8, 8307.1, and 5545.0 that corresponded to the ionic states +1 to +3 of uncleaved lithostathine (S2). Note that the dispersion in the mass/charge ratio that can be observed in each charge state corresponds to the salt adducts. By contrast, the spectrum taken after 1 day (Fig. 3B) demonstrates the presence of uncleaved lithostathine, as well as substantial amounts of cleaved lithostathine (S1), which can be detected at m/z values of 15012.2, 7510.0, and 5000.98 (charge states +1to +3). Bearing in mind that dimerization is an essential step in fibril formation (9Gregoire C. Marco S. Thimonier J. Duplan L. Laurine E. Chauvin J.P. Michel B. Peyrot V. Verdier J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3313-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar), we also recorded spectra in the 1000 to 45000-Da mass range. After 1 day, we found a peak at 30108.3 m/z, corresponding to the mass of S1-dimers, along with a second peak at 33488.1 m/z, representing dimers of intact lithostathine (Fig. 3B, inset). Although MALDI-TOF does not allow rigorous relative quantification of the S1 and S2 dimers, it is clear that the cleaved species disappears more rapidly than full-length lithostathine (after 3 days incubation; see Fig. 3, C (10 days) and D). This observation suggests that, as soon as it is cleaved, lithostathine assembles into multimers. In addition, the intensity of the peak corresponding to the S1 dimer is always low. Taken together, these data suggest that the S1 dimer represents only a transient species on the route to the formation of higher mass multimers. This finding is different from the one obtained for dimers containing the full-length protein that were previously shown to be unable to give rise to fibrils (9Gregoire C. Marco S. Thimonier J. Duplan L. Laurine E. Chauvin J.P. Michel B. Peyrot V. Verdier J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3313-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). MALDI mass spectrometry thus reveals a complex equilibrium taking place after 1 day between intact and cleaved lithostathine, in both monomeric and dimeric forms. Interestingly, traces of S2 dimers are already present at t = 0, which leads us to conclude that lithostathine dimerization either precedes or is concomitant with its cleavage. By contrast, the presence of an uncleaved N-terminal undecapeptide blocks the assembly of the dimers into fibrils of high order. Lithostathine Is a Member of a Protein Family That Is Pre-disposed to Undergo Domain Swapping—The results described above showed that the formation of lithostathine fibrils does not significantly perturb the secondary structure of the protein but could involve rearrangements of the local environment of the tryptophan residues. A possible explanation of these effects has emerged from sequence analysis and homology modeling. Previously, a sequence segment encompassing part of the tryptophan cluster (residues Trp89-Gly105) was found to be involved in the formation of protein-protein contacts during fibril formation (9Gregoire C. Marco S. Thimonier J. Duplan L. Laurine E. Chauvin J.P. Michel B. Peyrot V. Verdier J.M. EMBO J. 2001; 20: 3313-3321Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Lithostathine belongs to the C-type lectin superfamily (25Drickamer K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 9557-9560Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). By multiple sequence alignment of lithostathine with other C-type lectins able to swap, we found that the sequence of this segment is conserved, in particular with respect to the tryptophan residues (Fig. 4). For reasons outlined in more detail below, this region will hereafter be referred to as the loop region, and it is flanked by sequences that contain, at least in lithostathine, several proline and glycine residues forming hinge regions. Both amino acids were shown previously (26Bergdoll M. Remy M.H. Cagnon C. Masson J.M. Dumas P. Structure. 1997; 5: 391-401Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar, 27Ramoni R. Vincent F. Ashcroft A.E. Accornero P. Grolli S. Valencia C. Tegoni M. Cambillau C. Biochem. J. 2002; 365: 739-748Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to define the hinge region of proteins that possess mobile structural elements. Hence, we tentatively termed these two sequence segments the N- and C-terminal hinge regions as used previously in C-type lectins from snake venoms (18Fukuda K. Mizuno H. Atoda H. Morita T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). When we examined the structure and position of the loop region in the known structures of C-type lectins we noted that flavocetin-A is a disulfide-linked dimer (α and β chains) (Protein Data Bank number 1C3A; see Ref. 18Fukuda K. Mizuno H. Atoda H. Morita T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1915-1923Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) consisting of two different but homologous subunits that interact via a swapped and extended loop region. The root mean square deviation of the two subunits compared with lithostathine is 2.7 and 3.3 Å for the α and β chain, respectively. The major difference occurred within the loop region (Fig. 5A). By contrast, a backbone superimposition of the loop regions of the flavocetin-A β chain and lithostathine resulted in an root mean square deviation of only 0.75 Å (Fig. 5B), demonstrating that the local conformation of these regions is clearly similar. Taken together, these data raise the possibility that lithostathine has the capacity to undergo a domain swapping reacti"

Here we report the solution structure of 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase I (TAG) in complex with its 3-methyladenine (3-MeA) cognate base, and we have used chemical perturbation of the base in combination with mutagenesis of the enzyme to evaluate the role of hydrogen bonding and π-cation interactions in alkylated base recognition by this DNA repair enzyme. We find that TAG uses hydrogen bonding with heteroatoms on the base, van der Waals interactions with the 3-Me group, and conventional π-π stacking with a conserved Trp side chain to selectively bind neutral 3-MeA over the cationic form of the base. Discrimination against binding of the normal base adenine is derived from direct sensing of the 3-methyl group, leading to an induced-fit conformational change that engulfs the base in a box defined by five aromatic side chains. These findings indicate that base specific recognition by TAG does not involve strong π-cation interactions, and suggest a novel mechanism for alkylated base recognition and removal.

These findings indicate that base specific recognition by TAG does not involve strong π-cation interactions, and suggest a novel mechanism for alkylated base recognition and removal. DNA glycosylases are a remarkable enzyme class that recognize and remove damaged DNA bases as the first step in the DNA base excision repair pathway (1Mol C.D. Parikh S.S. Putnam C.D. Lo T.P. Tainer J.A. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biomol. Struct. 1999; 28: 101-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (172) Google Scholar). This important pathway serves as the primary cellular defense against the accumulation of unwanted and toxic DNA base lesions (2Lindahl T. Wood R.D. Science. 1999; 286: 1897-1905Crossref PubMed Scopus (1278) Google Scholar). The removal of purine bases that have been alkylated at electronegative heteroatoms is the province of a highly specialized subgroup of these enzymes that specifically recognize and remove these unusual cationic DNA bases. One evolutionary solution to this problem in biological recognition is found in the human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase (AAG), 1The abbreviations used are: AAGalkyladenine DNA glycosylase3-MeA3-methyladenineTAG3-MeA DNA glycosylase IAlkA3-MeA DNA glycosylase IIHhHhelix-hairpin-helixNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYNOE spectroscopyHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatography2Dtwo-dimensional3,7-DMA3,7-dimethyladenine3,9-DMA3,9-dimethyladeninewtwild type3,6-DMP3,6-dimethylpuriner.m.s.d.root mean square deviationHMQCheteronuclear multiple quantum coherence.1The abbreviations used are: AAGalkyladenine DNA glycosylase3-MeA3-methyladenineTAG3-MeA DNA glycosylase IAlkA3-MeA DNA glycosylase IIHhHhelix-hairpin-helixNOEnuclear Overhauser effectNOESYNOE spectroscopyHPLChigh-performance liquid chromatography2Dtwo-dimensional3,7-DMA3,7-dimethyladenine3,9-DMA3,9-dimethyladeninewtwild type3,6-DMP3,6-dimethylpuriner.m.s.d.root mean square deviationHMQCheteronuclear multiple quantum coherence. which has an α/β fold that is unique for DNA glycosylases (3Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). However, many more alkylated purine-specific DNA glycosylases, such as 3-methyladenine (3-MeA) DNA glycosylase II (AlkA) from Escherichia coli, contain a highly conserved α-helical domain with a “helix-hairpin-helix” (HhH) DNA binding motif that is found in other DNA glycosylases and DNA-binding proteins (4Hollis T. Lau A. Ellenberger T. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Hollis T. Lau A. Ellenberger T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Both AAG and AlkA recognize a broad range of alkylated bases (3-methyladenine, 7-methyladenine, and 7-methylguanine), and the substrate range of AAG extends to nonalkylated bases (hypoxanthine and 1-N6-ethenoadenine) (4Hollis T. Lau A. Ellenberger T. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 6Asaeda A. Ide H. Asagoshi K. Matsuyama S. Tano K. Murakami A. Takamori Y. Kubo K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). One recently described addition to the HhH DNA repair superfamily is 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase I (TAG) from E. coli, which is unique in its high specificity for 3-MeA and 3-MeG (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). alkyladenine DNA glycosylase 3-methyladenine 3-MeA DNA glycosylase I 3-MeA DNA glycosylase II helix-hairpin-helix nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy high-performance liquid chromatography two-dimensional 3,7-dimethyladenine 3,9-dimethyladenine wild type 3,6-dimethylpurine root mean square deviation heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence. alkyladenine DNA glycosylase 3-methyladenine 3-MeA DNA glycosylase I 3-MeA DNA glycosylase II helix-hairpin-helix nuclear Overhauser effect NOE spectroscopy high-performance liquid chromatography two-dimensional 3,7-dimethyladenine 3,9-dimethyladenine wild type 3,6-dimethylpurine root mean square deviation heteronuclear multiple quantum coherence. Enzymatic recognition and removal of cationic DNA bases such as 3-MeA represents a unique problem in DNA repair. However, repair of these lesions need not involve profound mechanisms for leaving group activation because these bases are electron-deficient and prone to spontaneous hydrolysis at 105- to 106-fold faster rates than neutral purine bases (8Lindahl T. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1982; 51: 61-87Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar, 9Stivers J.T. Jiang Y.L. Chem. Rev. 2003; 103: 2729-2760Crossref PubMed Scopus (396) Google Scholar). Consistent with this viewpoint, the active site pockets of AlkA and AAG possess no obvious polar groups capable of forming hydrogen bonds to the electronegative acceptor groups on the base to facilitate glycosidic bond cleavage, as might be expected from their abilities to remove a variety of bases (4Hollis T. Lau A. Ellenberger T. Mutat. Res. 2000; 460: 201-210Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar, 5Hollis T. Lau A. Ellenberger T. Prog. Nucleic Acids Res. Mol. Biol. 2001; 68: 305-314Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). AlkA and AAG also possess no obvious binding pockets for the alkyl modification, presumably because of the relatively broad substrate specificity of these enzymes (10Berdal K.G. Johansen R.F. Seeberg E. EMBO J. 1998; 17: 363-367Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar). In fact, structural studies on AlkA and AAG revealed that their active sites are lined with conserved tryptophan and tyrosine residues that form stacking and edgewise interactions with the damaged cationic base (3Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar, 11Lau A.Y. Scharer O.D. Samson L. Verdine G.L.

EMBO J. 2000; 19: 758-766Crossref PubMed Scopus (203) Google Scholar). On the basis of the aromatic character of their active sites, it has been proposed that these enzymes use aromatic π-cation interactions to attract the cationic-damaged base into the active site, and thus discriminate between cationic-damaged purines and neutral undamaged purines (3Lau A.Y. Wyatt M.D. Glassner B.J. Samson L.D. Ellenberger T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2000; 97: 13573-13578Crossref PubMed Scopus (215) Google Scholar). Previous structural studies of TAG suggested both similarities and differences in base recognition and catalysis as compared with AAG and AlkA. From NMR chemical shift perturbation studies, the 3-MeA binding pocket of TAG was also assigned to an extremely aromatic-rich pocket, reminiscent of AAG and AlkA (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). However, TAG also has an absolutely conserved glutamic acid residue that was suggested to form hydrogen bonds with the N6 and N7 positions of 3-MeA in a similar fashion as an analogous group observed in the adenine binding pocket of MutY, an adenine-specific DNA glycosylase of the same superfamily (13Guan Y. Manuel R.C. Arvai A.S. Parikh S.S. Mol C.D. Miller J.H. Lloyd S. Tainer J.A. Nat. Struct. Biol. 1998; 5: 1058-1064Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). In contradiction with expectations from the aromatic π-cation hypothesis, it was found that the neutral 3-methyladenine base bound specifically and tightly to TAG, whereas binding of the normal base adenine could not be detected (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Thus, the TAG active site can specifically recognize a 3-methyladenine base even when its positive charge has been ablated, suggesting that other unique features of the base are detected by this enzyme. A deeper understanding of the catalytic mechanisms of alkylpurine-specific glycosylases is hampered by the absence of structural and mechanistic studies on the complexes of these enzymes with cationic and neutral alkylpurine bases. In this study we present the solution structure of TAG in complex with the neutral 3-MeA base. To complement the structural information, we have also synthesized a series of neutral and cationic 3-methyladenine base analogues to probe the role of charge and hydrogen bonding in specific base recognition. In addition, we have performed extensive mutagenesis of the enzyme to examine the energetic interactions of selected enzyme side chains with 3-MeA, as well as each of the 3-MeA base analogues. This comprehensive data set strongly indicates that TAG recognizes 3-MeA using specific hydrogen bonding, conventional π-π stacking interactions, and by van der Waals interactions with the 3-methyl group that lead to an induced fit conformational change in the enzyme. These results may provide evidence for a catalytic mechanism involving weak binding of the cationic substrate base in the ground state and tighter binding of the neutral base in the transition state. Sample Preparation—Samples of unlabeled and isotope-labeled TAG were prepared as described in Drohat et al. (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The TAG mutants, Y13A, Y16A, H17A, D18A, W21A, E38A, and W46A were prepared using the QuikChange double-stranded mutagenesis kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA) using the pET28b overexpression vector, which includes an N-terminal His6 tag. All mutations were confirmed by DNA sequencing of both strands. The mutants were obtained in greater than 95% purity by sequential passage over nickel-agarose and SP-Sepharose columns. Enzyme concentrations were determined from UV absorbance measurements in 6 m guanidinium hydrochloride using calculated extinction coefficients (us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html). For assignment of Trp and Tyr residues, and for the NOE experiments used to obtain restraints to the bound base, a uniformly 15N-labeled and fractionally deuterated wtTAG sample was prepared using minimal medium containing 75% 2H2O. Unlabeled tryptophan and tyrosine (0.2 g/liter) were added just prior to induction with isopropyl-1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside to obtain selective labeling of these residues. For a typical NMR experiment, the purified protein was exchanged into NMR buffer (10 mm phosphate buffer, pH 6.6, 100 mm NaCl, 3 mm dithiothreitol, 0.34 mm NaN3), concentrated to 0.5–1 mm, and then 3-methyladenine was added to the solution to obtain a final concentration of about 5 mm. All NMR samples above were placed in Shigemi NMR tubes. Synthesis of Base Analogues—3-[8-13C]Methyladenine, 3,6-dimethylpurine, and 3,7-dimethyladenine were obtained by direct methylation of 8-[13C]adenine (Isotec), 6-methylpurine (Aldrich), and 3-methyladenine (Aldrich), respectively (14Fujii T. Saito T. Kizu K. Hayashibara H. Kumazawa Y. Nakajima S. Heterocycles. 1986; 24: 2449-2454Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Lam F.L. Parham J.C.

Each of the reaction products was purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the resultant compounds provided proton and 13C NMR spectra identical with previous reports (14Fujii T. Saito T. Kizu K. Hayashibara H. Kumazawa Y. Nakajima S. Heterocycles. 1986; 24: 2449-2454Crossref Scopus (10) Google Scholar, 15Lam F.L. Parham J.C.

For the synthesis of 3,9-dimethyladenine, methyl iodide (70 mg) was added to 3-methyladenine (25.4 mg) in warm N,N-dimethylformamide (3 ml) and stirred for 30 min, followed by more methyl iodide (70 mg) with stirring overnight at room temperature. The precipitate was removed by centrifugation, and the clear solution was evaporated to dryness in vacuo. The final product was separated from other sideproducts by HPLC (10% overall yield). 1H NMR (D2O, ppm): δ 8.41 (s, 1H, 2-H); 8.14 (s, 1H, 8-H); 4.28 (s, 3H, 3-CH3), 4.16 (s, 3H, 9-CH3).

NMR Spectroscopy—NMR experiments were performed at 20 °C on Bruker DMX 500-, 600-, and 750-MHz NMR spectrometers, or Varian Unity Plus 600-MHz NMR spectrometers; all of which were equipped with four channels and pulse-field gradients. The standard suite of experiments for assigning 1H, 13C, and 15N backbone and side-chain chemical shifts and for obtaining NOE-based distance restraints were collected as previously described (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Intermolecular NOE restraints between the 3-MeA base and 75% deuterated, 15N-labeled, and selectively Tyr-Trp protonated TAG (see above) were obtained using the 2D 1H-1H NOESY pulse sequence with a mixing time of 200 ms. Data were processed using NMRPipe (17Delaglio F. Grzesiek S. Vuister G.W. Zhu G. Pfeifer J. Bax A. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 277-293Crossref PubMed Scopus (11533) Google Scholar) and analyzed using SPARKY version 3 (T. D. Goddard and D. G. Kneller, University of California, San Francisco). The resonance assignments have been submitted to the BioMagResBank in Madison, WI (accession code 7834). The 1H chemical shifts were referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-S-sulfonate, and the 13C and 15N resonances were indirectly referenced to 2,2-dimethyl-2-silapentane-S-sulfonate (18Wishart D.S. Bigam C.G. Yao J. Abildgaard F. Dyson H.J. Oldfield E. Markley J.L. Sykes B.D. J. Biomol. NMR. 1995; 6: 135-140Crossref PubMed Scopus (2068) Google Scholar). pKa of 3-MeA—To obtain the pKa value of the free and bound base, 2D 1H-13C HMQC experiments were collected using a Varian Unity Plus 500-MHz spectrometer for both free and TAG-bound 3-[8-13C]-methyladenine at several pH values. For each experiment sweep widths of 2514 Hz (13C) and 4999 Hz (1H) were used with the carbon and proton carriers set at 130 and 4.82 ppm, respectively. The sample of the complex contained 0.75 mm unlabeled TAG and 0.65 mm 3-[8-13C]-methyladenine in NMR buffer, such that about 95% of the base was enzyme-bound. Structural Calculations—Calculations were carried out as previously described (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Interproton distance restraints obtained from NOESY experiments and backbone (φ/ψ) dihedral angle and hydrogen bond restraints derived from the observed 1Hα, 13CO, 13Cα, 13Cβ, and 15N chemical shifts, were used as inputs in the torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing protocol in CNS (19Brunger A.T. Adams P.D. Clore G.M. DeLano W.L. Gros P. Grosse-Kunstleve R.W. Jiang J.S. Kuszewski J. Nilges M. Pannu N.S. Read R.J. Rice L.M. Simonson T. Warren G.L. Acta Crystallogr. Sect. D Biol. Crystallogr. 1998; 54: 905-921Crossref PubMed Scopus (16957) Google Scholar). A set of 200 structures was calculated, starting from a high quality CNS-derived structure, using the torsion angle dynamics simulated annealing protocol in the XPLOR-NIH program, 2G. M. Clore, J. Kuszewski, C. D. Schwieters, and N. Tjandra, XPLOR-NIH, version 2.0.2, nmr.cit.nih.gov/xplor-nih. including a torsion angle data base of mean potential force (20Kuszewski J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M. Protein Sci. 1996; 5: 1067-1080Crossref PubMed Scopus (207) Google Scholar). From this set, 25 low energy structures were selected that exhibited no distance restraint violations of >0.5 Å and no dihedral angle restraint violations of >5.0° (Table I). After structural calculations using just intermolecular NOE restraints to the base, planar hydrogen bond restraints between the 3-MeA and the Oη-Hη of Tyr-16, and the Cδ-Oϵ1,ϵ2-Hϵ2 atoms of Glu-38 were then added as indicated by the initial structures and the biochemical data.Table IStructural statistics for 3-methyladenine DNA glycosylase I (TAG)Parameter{25}aThe 25 structures calculated and energy minimized in CNS.r.m.s.d. with respect to the mean structure Backbone atoms residues 11-1740.69 ± 0.10 All heavy atoms residues 11-1741.27 ± 0.14 Backbone atoms for all residues (1-188)1.04 ± 0.24 All heavy atoms for all residues (1-188)1.51 ± 0.19r.m.s.d. from experimental distance restraints (Å)bNone of the ensemble of structures displayed a distance violation of >0.5 Å.

Open table in a new tab Fluorescence Spectroscopy—The binding of 3-MeA, 3,7-DMA, and 3,9-DMA to wtTAG and E38A was performed at 15 °C essentially as described in Drohat et al. (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). The melting curve profiles of TAG variants were obtained by monitoring the tryptophan fluorescence decrease of the enzymes with increasing temperature between 15 °C and 80 °C. The temperature was increased by 2 °C increments, and the samples were equilibrated for 1 min prior to measuring the fluorescence. A buffer containing 20 mm NaH2PO4, 100 mm NaCl (pH 7.5) was used, with excitation at 280 nm and fluorescence emission monitored at 343 nm using a Spex Fluoromax-3. Ultrafiltration Binding Assay—The binding affinities of wild-type and E38A for 3-MeA and 3,6-DMP were determined by ultrafiltration of the equilibrated mixture of enzyme and base analogue. The reaction mixtures (50 μl), consisting of 100 μm of each base analogue and a series of enzyme concentrations (0–550 μm), were incubated for 2 min and filtered for 5 min using microcon-3 (Millipore, Bedford, MA). The free base analogue in the filtrate was separated using a Phenomenex Aqua 5μ C-18 HPLC column using isocratic buffer elution (10 mm phosphate, 20% MeOH, pH 7). The 3-MeA peak area was then quantified by integration and normalized to an internal concentration standard consisting of 1 μm uracil that was included in the binding reaction. The equilibrium dissociation constants were obtained by nonlinear leastsquare analysis using Equation 1,[Complex]=[Base]tot×[E]free/(KD+[E]free)(Eq. 1) where Btotal and Efree represent the total concentration of base analogue and the free enzyme concentration, respectively. Solution Structure of the TAG Complex with 3-MeA—We have previously solved the solution structure of free TAG in the absence of any ligands (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Here we have determined the solution structure of TAG in complex with the 3-MeA product using a similar suite of heteronuclear NMR experiments as previously employed to obtain the structure of the free enzyme (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar), and more recently, to refine the structure of the zinc binding site of TAG (21Kwon K. Cao C. Jiang Y.L. Stivers J.T. J. Biol. Chem. 2003; 278: 19442-19446Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). One special approach that was key to obtaining resonance assignments for the aromatic residues in the active site of the complex was a selective labeling experiment in which the 15N-labeled enzyme was partially deuterated by overexpression in 75% D2O, and just prior to induction, unlabeled Trp and Tyr were added to the minimal growth media to selectively protonate these groups. This approach reduced spin diffusion pathways and provided much more robust 2D NOESY spectra that allowed assignment of all key active site aromatic side chains and unambiguous measurements of intermolecular NOE values between these groups and the 3-MeA base. The overall quality of the structure for the complex is very similar to that of the free enzyme (r.m.s.d. = 0.64 Å, Fig. 1A), and the complete structural statistics are reported in Table I. Binding of the 3-MeA base (which is neutral at the pH of the NMR studies, see below) induces only small changes in the overall structure as compared with the free enzyme but alters the environment of Trp-6 (see below), giving rise to the large tryptophan fluorescence decrease that accompanies 3-MeA binding (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). A similar induced fit mechanism has been previously described for uracil DNA glycosylase upon binding to uracil (22Drohat A.C. Stivers J.T. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 11865-11875Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar). Mapped onto the structure shown in Fig. 1B are the side chains of six active site amino acid residues that are completely conserved in all TAG family members (Trp-6, Tyr-13, Tyr-16, Trp-21, Glu-38, and Trp-46) (23Bujnicki J.M. Rychlewski L. DNA Repair (Amst.). 2002; 1: 391-395Crossref PubMed Scopus (6) Google Scholar). In the studies described below, these residues and two others, His-17 and Asp-18, were mutated to alanine. Structural Basis for 3-MeA Recognition—The position of the 3-MeA base in the active site was well defined by 27 intermolecular NOE restraints from the enzyme to the H8, H2, and 3-N-methyl hydrogens of the base. An overlay of the 3-MeA base and several surrounding residues that comprise the binding pocket, using the 10 lowest energy structures, is shown in Fig. 2A, and a molecular model of the lowest energy structure is shown in Fig. 2B. This structure reveals that the base is stacked with a single conserved tryptophan (Trp-46), and that Glu-38 serves as a bifunctional hydrogen bond donor and acceptor to N7 and the 6-amino group of 3-MeA. The hydroxyl of Tyr-16 is positioned to donate a hydrogen bond to the N1 position of the base, and Trp-6 appears to serve as a lid to encapsulate the 3-MeA base in an aromatic box defined by itself and Tyr-13, Tyr-16, and Trp-46 (Fig. 2B). Additional compelling evidence for a hydrogen bond between Glu-38 and the exocyclic amino group of 3-MeA is provided by the observation of a broad proton resonance in the complex with a chemical shift of δ (1H) = 6.13 ppm, which was unambiguously assigned to the 6-amino protons of 3-MeA in NOESY spectra. This combination of polar and π stacking interactions between 3-MeA and TAG differs considerably from the proposed aromatic π-cation recognition mechanisms of other alkylpurine DNA glycosylases such as AlkA and AAG (see above). Our previous finding that TAG could discriminate exquisitely between neutral 3-MeA and adenine suggested that the enzyme could sense the one difference between these bases: the 3-methyl group. As shown in the molecular surface representation of Fig. 2C, the methyl group is nestled in a pocket defined by the aromatic rings of Trp-6, Tyr-13, and the side chain methylene group of Trp-46. Favorable van der Waals interactions of the methyl group in this nonpolar pocket may be used to drive the induced-fit clamping of the enzyme, which creates the aromatic box around the 3-MeA base. Indeed, it is difficult to envision binding of 3-MeA in this aromatic box without it first being presented in an open conformation. The structure of free TAG is consistent with this idea, because the Trp-6 lid is “ajar,” allowing improved access of 3-MeA to the binding pocket (6Asaeda A. Ide H. Asagoshi K. Matsuyama S. Tano K. Murakami A. Takamori Y. Kubo K. Biochemistry. 2000; 39: 1959-1965Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). This induced-fit mechanism involving nonpolar interactions with the 3-methyl group may explain the exceptional discrimination against adenine. Two other groups shown in Fig. 2C that are in van der Waals contact with 3-MeA are Ala-168 and Ser-164. Both of these groups are highly conserved in the TAG family, as would be expected from their close proximity to the bound base. The Bound 3-MeA Is Neutral—We have previously shown that TAG recognizes neutral 3-MeA, but not adenine, suggesting that positive charge was not required for specific binding (7Drohat A.C. Kwon K. Krosky D.J. Stivers J.T. Nat. Struct. Biol. 2002; 9: 659-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). One caveat to this previous conclusion was that it could not be excluded that the enzyme protonated the neutral base upon binding, and that specific recognition did indeed involve favorable π-cation interactions between the enzyme and base. To directly address this question we incorporated a site-specific 13C label at the 8-carbon of the purine ring of 3-MeA and determined the pKa value of the free base using a 2D 1H-13C HMQC experiment (Fig. 3A). From this experiment, the pKa (3-MeA) = 5.6 ± 0.1, which is 1.9 log units lower than the pH value employed in the previous 3-MeA binding studies. To establish that 3-MeA remained neutral upon binding to the TAG active site, we measured the 8-13C shift of 3-MeA while it was bound in the active site pocket at pH 6.5 and 7.5 (Fig. 3B). The chemical shifts at both pH values were similar to free 3-MeA (Fig. 3A, closed circles), providing strong evidence that the enzyme does not significantly change the pKa value of the base, and that the 3-MeA binding measurements at pH 7.5 reflect binding of the neutral base. These findings establish the previous conclusion that specific recognition of 3-MeA need not involve positive charge on the base. 3An issue that is beyond the scope of this report is the tautomeric state of 3-MeA in DNA and in the TAG active site.

We have introduced this mutation into yeast actin to assess its biochemical consequences. R177H G-actin exhibited reduced thermal stability and an accelerated nucleotide exchange rate. R177H actin has an increased critical concentration and polymerizes with a greatly extended nucleation phase but a faster elongation process, suggesting that significant fragmentation accompanies filament formation. Pi release from R177H actin is tightly coupled to polymerization, as with wild type (WT) actin, suggesting that the R177H mutation does not affect ATPase activity and Pi release. R177H actin shows no polymerization-dependent decrease in intrinsic Trp fluorescence, and the fluorescence yield of a pyrene at Cys374 is decreased. An equivalent amount of WT actin significantly but not completely rescues the mutant's polymerization defect. Tropomyosin greatly exacerbates the elongation of the nucleation phase of R177H actin but slightly decreases its critical concentration. It has only a slight effect on a 1:1 WT/mutant mixture. The defects we observed with R177H actin in vitro indicate that Arg177 is crucial for the control of the structural integrity of the actin monomer and the actin filament and provide insight into the defects caused by this mutation in zebrafish cardiogenesis.

Cardiofunk is a zebrafish mutation that, when present in the homozygous state, can lead to defective endocardial cushion formation and subsequent embryonic lethality. 1T. Bartman, E. C. Walsh, K.-K. Wen, M. McKane, J. Ren, J. Alexander, P. A. Rubenstein, and D. Stainier, unpublished data.1T. Bartman, E. C. Walsh, K.-K. Wen, M. McKane, J. Ren, J. Alexander, P. A. Rubenstein, and D. Stainier, unpublished data. There is also a mild phenotype in the heterozygous state. Bartman et al. also demonstrated that the source of this mutation was an embryologically expressed cardiac actin isoform in which Arg177 had been mutated to His. This isoform appears to be a hybrid between zebrafish cardiac and skeletal muscle α-actins with cross-isoform differences at seven positions. This mutation has no relation to any of the actin-based cardiomyopathy mutants that have been reported to date in humans (1Wong W.W. Doyle T.C. Cheung P. Olson T.M. Reisler E. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 2001; 22: 665-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar). Reconstruction of this mutation in yeast actin, which is 87% homologous with human actin (2Ng R. Abelson J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1980; 77: 3912-3916Crossref PubMed Scopus (348) Google Scholar), resulted in temperature and hyperosmolar sensitivity, and the mutation produced polymerization defects in vitro. Arg177, conserved in all actins, is located in subdomain II of actin near the base of the protein's interdomain cleft, where the Pi that is generated from bound ATP during actin polymerization is thought to exit the protein. Crystallographic and protein structure modeling studies suggest that the guanidinium group of Arg177 is involved in a number of interresidue interactions that potentially can affect both actin structure and function (3Kabsch W. Mannherz H.G. Suck D. Pai E.F. Holmes K.C. Nature. 1990; 347: 37-44Crossref PubMed Scopus (1515) Google Scholar, 4Schutt C.E. Myslik J.C. Rozycki M.D. Goonesekere N.C. Lindberg U. Nature. 1993; 365: 810-816Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). It can form a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl oxygen of the peptide bond involving His73, resulting in a potential cross-cleft stabilization of the protein. It can also bond potentially with the side chain carboxyl of Asp179 in subdomain IV. In the filament model of Holmes (5Holmes K.C. Popp D. Gebhard W. Kabsch W. Nature. 1990; 347: 44-49Crossref PubMed Scopus (1305) Google Scholar), it may interact with Ser199, Phe200, and Val201 of a monomer in the apposed strand of the filament across the interstrand space, potentially leading to cross-strand stabilization within the actin helix. Molecular dynamics modeling suggested that, because of its location near the exit channel for Pi from the interdomain cleft following nucleotide hydrolysis, Arg177 is one of the residues that significantly retards the release of the Pi due to formation of an ionic interaction between the guanidinium and phosphate groups (6Wriggers W. Schulten K. Proteins. 1999; 35: 262-273Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). This residue can be ADP-ribosylated by bacterial toxins such as the C3 toxin from C. botulinum, thereby rendering the actin nonpolymerizable (7Weigt C. Just I. Wegner A. Aktories K. FEBS Lett. 1989; 246: 181-184Crossref PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar, 8Wegner A. Aktories K. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 13739-13742Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The role of Arg177 in actin function had been previously addressed at a more mechanistic level in three studies. In an alanine-scanning mutagenesis study of yeast actin, Arg177 and Asp179 were simultaneously converted to Ala (9Drubin D.G. Jones H.D. Wertman K.F. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 1277-1294Crossref PubMed Scopus (212) Google Scholar). When expressed as the sole actin in the cell, this double mutant resulted in sensitivity to elevated temperature and hyperosmolar medium, and actin cables were only slightly detectable using anti-actin antibodies as a detection tool. Buzan and Frieden (10Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) further characterized this double mutant at the biochemical level and reported that the double mutation resulted in poor polymerization. Schuler et al. (11Schuler H. Nyakern M. Schutt C.E. Lindberg U. Karlsson R. Eur. J. Biochem. 2000; 267: 4054-4062Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar) changed Arg177 to the oppositely charged Asp in chick β-actin, with the result being a 10-fold increase in critical concentration, lowered thermostability, and more rapid exchange of bound nucleotide. All of these results point to the importance of Arg177 in actin function. However, the nature of the mutations employed for these studies makes the significance of the results uncertain. In the first study, not only have two oppositely charged residues been completely neutralized, but the two mutations together make it impossible to assess the contribution of the R177A mutation alone. In the second, the reversal of charge at this position in a region containing a number of other acidic residues may have altered the structure of the protein significantly due to charge repulsion. We wished to understand the biochemical basis for the lethality of the cardiofunk mutation in the homozygous state and its partial heterozygous dominance as well as to better define the role of Arg177 in actin filament formation and control of Pi release. Toward this end, we have carried out a series of in vitro experiments with yeast actin in which Arg177 was changed to His, the cardiofunk mutation. This is a much milder mutation than those used above, since it maintains at least a partially positive charge at this residue and alters only one residue at a time. Besides characterizing the biochemical properties of the mutant actin alone, we have also assessed its behavior in the presence of WT yeast actin to approximate the heterozygous situation, and we have examined the stabilization of the actin by tropomyosin, a major protein involved in regulation of thin filament function in cardiac muscle.

Oligodeoxynucleotide-directed Mutagenesis—Using site-directed mutagenesis, we replaced the codon for Arg177 in yeast actin with a His codon. The actin coding sequence was contained in the centromeric plasmid pRS314 (12Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) adjacent to the ACT1 promoter. The set of DNA primers (5′-CTACCTCACGCCATTTTGCATATCGATTTGGCCGGTAGAG-3′ and 5′-CTCTACCGCCCAAATCGATATGCAAAATGGCGTGAGGTAG-3′) was used in which the codon for Arg177 (AGA) was changed to His (CAT). A haploid yeast strain expressing the mutant actin as the only actin in the cell was generated as described previously using a plasmid shuffling procedure (13Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The mutant plasmid was rescued from the cell and sequenced to ensure that the mutation was intact. Protein Preparation—Yeast wild-type actin was purified in the calcium form by a DNase I affinity chromatography/DEAE ion exchange chromatography protocol as previously described with modifications (13Cook R.K. Blake W.T. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9430-9436Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The major modification is the use of 75 ml of 0.6 m NaCl to wash the DNase I affininty column bound with yeast cellular proteins in order to eliminate the possible binding of cofilin to G-actin. The quality of the G-actin preparation was analyzed with SDS-PAGE, and the bands were visualized by Coomassie Blue staining. G-actin was stored in G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 0.2 mm ATP, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.1 mm dithiothreitol) at 4 °C and used within 3 days. The actin concentration was determined by the UV absorbance at 290 nm using the extinction coefficient: ϵ = 25.6 cm-1·mm-1. Bovine cardiac tropomyosin (BVC TPM) was purified according to Landis (14Landis C. Back N. Homsher E. Tobacman L.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1999; 274: 31279-31285Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (61) Google Scholar), and the concentration (dimers) of TPM was determined by the UV absorbance at 280 nm using the extinction coefficients: ϵ = 15.36 cm-1·mm-1. ϵATP-bound actin was prepared as described in Wen et al. (15Wen K.K. Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41101-41109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar) and used within 1 day. Pyrene-labeled Actin Preparation—Sufficient N-(1-pyrenyl)maleimide freshly dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide at a final concentration of 3.3 mm was mixed with a G-actin solution (without dithiothreitol) to yield a final concentration of 45 μm, and the resulting solution was incubated at 20 °C for at least 30 min in the dark. This step was repeated until the molar ratio of total pyrene to G-actin was 1.1:1. This pyrene-labeled G-actin was polymerized by adding MgCl2 and KCl to 2 and 50 mm, respectively, at 20 °C for 1 h in the dark. The pyrene-labeled F-actin was collected by centrifugation in a Beckman TL centrifuge in a TLA 100.2 rotor at 75,000 rpm, 25 °C for 1 h, and depolymerized by dialysis against G buffer. The extent of labeling was determined by UV absorbance at 344 nm using the extinction coefficient ϵ = 22 mm-1·cm-1. Characterization of G-actin—The apparent melting temperature of G-actin was determined by circular dichroism according to Yao et al. (16Yao X. Nguyen V. Wriggers W. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 22875-22882Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (21) Google Scholar). Briefly, 1 μm G-actin in G buffer was heated at a constant rate of 1 °C/min from 25 to 80 °C with constant stirring. Changes in the actin ellipiticity were monitored at 222 nm using an AVIV 62 DS spectropolarimeter. Data were normalized as the fraction of native protein based on the net change in ellipiticity and then fitted to a two-state model (17Santoro M.M. Bolen D.W. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 8063-8068Crossref PubMed Scopus (1589) Google Scholar) with a single transition between a native and a denatured form of the protein by using Microsoft Excel (Seattle, WA). The apparent Tm value was defined as the temperature at which 50% of the G-actin was denatured. The rate of ϵATP release was determined by the change in the fluorescence of an ϵATP-bound G-actin solution as described by Wen (15Wen K.K. Yao X. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 41101-41109Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Briefly, 2.5 μm calcium ϵATP-bound actin in the absence of free nucleotide was added to a 300 μm ATP solution at 25 °C. The fluorescence change due to the release of actin-bound ϵATP was recorded as described below, and the rate constant for the release was obtained by fitting the data with a first-order reaction equation with Microsoft Excel. Actin Polymerization—The procedures for initiating actin polymerization and obtaining the critical concentration are essentially the same as described elsewhere (18Wen K.K. Kuang B. Rubenstein P.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275: 40594-40600Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Briefly, each G-actin solution was mixed with MgCl2 and KCl to give final concentrations of 2 and 50 mm, respectively, to trigger the polymerization reaction. To measure the critical concentration (C.c.) of actin polymerization in the absence or the presence of BVC TPM, the net change in either light scattering or pyrene fluorescence of an actin polymerization reaction was measured as a function of increasing actin concentration. The critical concentration of actin was obtained by drawing a line through the points and determining its intersection on the x axis. To assess the effect of TPM on actin polymerization, a 6.9 μm G-actin solution was mixed with 3.5 μm TPM, and polymerization was induced as described above. To monitor actin polymerization in the pH range from 6.5 to 8, a G-actin solution (pH 7.5) was processed through a Bio-Spin®-30 Tris column (Bio-Rad) preequilibrated with pH 8 G-buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 8, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP). To prepare the 5 μm G-actin solution at pH 7 and 6.5, a 5 μm G-actin solution (pH 7.5) was mixed with an equal volume of MES G buffer (5 mm MES at pH 6.6 and 6.1, 0.2 mm CaCl2, and 0.2 mm ATP). The final pH of each G-actin solution was checked by a pH meter. Fluorescence Assays—Fluorescence measurements were obtained using a FluoroMax (Jobin Yvon Inc., Edison, NJ) fluorescence spectrometer with a thermostatted water bath attached to the cuvette chamber. Actin polymerization (described below) was monitored by a change in light scattering with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 360 nm. It was also monitored by the change in pyrene fluorescence with excitation and emission wavelengths set at 365 and 386 nm, respectively. The pyrene fluorescence emission spectra were obtained by exciting the sample at 365 nm and recording the fluorescence emission from 375 to 450 nm. The actin intrinsic Trp fluorescence emission spectrum was obtained by exciting at 300 nm and recording the fluorescence emission from 305 to 370 nm. The ϵATP fluorescence intensity change was monitored with excitation and emission wavelengths of 340 and 410 nm, respectively. Simulation of Actin Polymerization—KinTekSim version 2.03 (available on the World Wide Web at www.kintek-corp.com) was utilized to simulate and fit actin polymerization kinetics data with the actin polymerization scheme adopted and modified from Buzan and Frieden (10Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar) and Du and Frieden (19Du J. Frieden C. Biochemistry. 1998; 37: 13276-13284Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) as described below, where A is an actin monomer and Ap is an actin polymer.Scheme1A+A⇔A2Scheme 1 2)A2+A⇔A33)A3+A⇔A44)A4+A⇔A55)A5+A⇔A66)A6+A⇔Ap7)Ap+A⇔Ap(Elongationstep)8)Ap⇔2Ap(Fragmentationstep)Scheme I The approximate fit of the data to Scheme 1 was obtained using the Simulation-Setup function within KinTekSim, and these approximations were further used to globally fit the data using the FitSim function within KinTekSim. Phosphate Release Assay—The inorganic phosphate released from F-actin during polymerization was measured in a coupled assay using the EnzCheck assay developed by Webb (20Webb M.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4884-4887Crossref PubMed Scopus (479) Google Scholar) with modifications. Briefly, each reaction contained actin at the desired concentration, 0.5 units/ml purine nucleoside phosphorylase, and 200 μm 2-amino-6-mercapto-7-methylpurine riboside. Pi released from actin in F buffer (5 mm Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2 mm MgCl2, 50 mm KCl, 0.2 mm CaCl2, 0.2 mm dithiothreitol, and 0.2 mm nucleotide triphosphate) upon actin polymerization was monitored continuously by the change in absorbance at 360 nm. A standard curve allowed conversion of the absorbance change to Pi concentration. Electron Microscopy—To prepare the samples for electron microscopy, 6.9 μm actin was induced to polymerize as described above. A 3-μl aliquot sample from the actin solution was removed at time 0, 5, and 10 min and applied to carbon-coated Formvar grids and visualized following negative staining with 1.5% (w/v) uranyl acetate using a Hitachi 7000 electron microscope (University of Iowa Electron Microscope Facility). Effect of the R177H Mutation on G-actin Structure—To assess the changes in G-actin structure caused by the mutation, we examined its effect on thermal stability, rate of nucleotide exchange, and stability to limited proteolysis of the protein. ϵATP exhibits a much higher fluorescence when bound to actin than when it is free in solution, and its release from actin can be followed in the presence of a large excess of ATP to prevent rebinding of the fluorescent analogue (21Wang Y.L. Taylor D.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1981; 78: 5503-5507Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). Fig. 1 shows a faster decay curve for the mutant than the WT actin. Fitting the data to a first order equation yielded a first order rate constant for the R177H actin (0.023 s-1) that is ∼1.5 times faster than that for WT actin (0.015 s-1). In a repeat of this experiment, we obtained rate constants of 0.014 (s-1) and 0.025 (s-1) for WT and mutant actins, respectively, demonstrating the reproducibility of the results. This finding suggests that the mutation caused an increased flexibility in the protein leading to the faster off-rate. We assessed the thermal stability of the protein by following its circular dichroism spectrum at 222 nm as a function of increasing temperature from 25 to 80 °C and fit the data to a two-state denaturation model. Fig. 2 demonstrates that the Tm(app) for the mutant protein is 48 °C compared with the 52 °C Tm(app) exhibited by the WT actin. This result is consistent with the introduction of greater flexibility and less stability in the protein because of the mutation. Limited proteolysis with chymotrypsin, subtilisin, and trypsin, which targets cleavage sites at the top of subdomain II, however, did not show differences between the WT and mutant proteins (data not shown), suggesting that changes in conformation caused by the mutation may have been restricted to near the base of the interdomain cleft where the residue lies.Fig. 2Relative thermal stability of R177H and WT G-actins. Thermal stabilities were measured by subjecting a 1 μm concentration of either WT (○) or R177H (▵) actin to increasing temperatures between 25 and 80 °C and monitoring the change in ellipticity at 222 nm in a CD spectropolarimeter as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The data were normalized to reflect the fraction of protein remaining in the native conformation at each temperature, and the data were fitted to a two-state model presented as solid lines. The experiments in this figure have been performed twice with essentially identical resultsView Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Polymerization of R177H Actin—We had previously shown that, in comparison with WT actin, the mutation caused a premature level of termination of polymerization, an apparently elongated nucleation time, and a faster than expected rate of filament formation based on the amount of polymerizable actin present in the solution.1 To better understand the nature of the defect, we simulated the data previously obtained with a model based on that of Buzan and Frieden (10Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar), which incorporated a fragmentation/annealing step not required for the WT protein. We then used the model to fit the original data points. The results of the fit are shown in Fig. 3 and Table I, and the kinetic constants for the individual steps in the model are listed in Table I. For the association rate constant k+ of WT actin, we used a value of 2 μm-1 s-1, the same as the one used by Buzan and Frieden (10Buzan J.M. Frieden C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1996; 93: 91-95Crossref PubMed Scopus (62) Google Scholar). For the WT actin, nucleation is assumed to be trimer or tetramer formation. For the mutant, a best fit was obtained with the nucleus assumed to be a pentamer. In general, in comparison with WT actin, the mutant is characterized by slower monomer on-rates, faster monomer off-rates, and a significant propensity for fragmentation, leading to increased numbers of filament nucleation sites following the onset of polymerization. Using the plateau levels for each of the concentrations of actin polymerized, we also calculated a C.c. for the R177H actin of 2 ± 0.4 μm (n = 4), ∼7-fold higher than that of WT actin (0.3 ± 0.2 μm, n = 3).Table IRate constant for kinetics model of actin polymerizationWTR177HStepk+k-k+k-μM-1 s-1s-1μM-1 s-1s-11283,4670.63106223660.6390003210.631004210.63105210.6316200.6307210.631k+k-k+k-s-1μM-1 s-1s-1μM-1 s-18 (fragmentation/annealing)—a—, not required—0.0450.763a —, not required Open table in a new tab Because the simulation suggested that filament fragmentation of the mutant F-actin might be significant, we examined the actin by electron microscopy as a function of time following initiation of the polymerization reaction. Fig. 4E shows that with the mutant after 5 min only short actin oligomers or amorphous aggregates are observed. After 10 min (Fig. 4F), longer filaments begin to appear in a mass of otherwise short choppy looking filaments. In contrast, after 5 min, a comparable amount of WT actin formed a mass of long, well structured filaments like those seen in Fig. 4B. These data are consistent with the suggestion of massive fragmentation early during polymerization due to filament instability followed by a rapid phase of fragment growth due to more extensive nucleation and annealing of preformed filament fragments. However, the early appearance of fragments and kinked actin in the case of the mutant may simply reflect a normal process that is more readily apparent because of the polymerization delay observed with this protein. Effect of Tropomyosin on R177H Actin Polymerization—To try to resolve the two possible explanations for the EM observations, we examined the effect of tropomyosin on the polymerization of the mutant actin because tropomyosin has been shown to prevent fragmentation (22Hitchcock-DeGregori S.E. Sampath P. Pollard T.D. Biochemistry. 1988; 27: 9182-9185Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). Moreover, within the context of the sarcomere, the actin thin filament is saturated with tropomyosin, which has been shown to be able to stabilize actin filaments. We thus tested whether inclusion of cardiac tropomyosin with pyrene-labeled R177H actin at a level sufficient to saturate the actin would decrease the hyperfragmentation we hypothesized occurred with the mutant actin. Fig. 5 shows that tropomyosin had two effects on the pure pyrene-labeled mutant actin. First, its increase in pyrene fluorescence in the presence of tropomyosin was about 50% higher than that of the mutant actin alone, in contrast to the case for WT actin where no increase is observed. Second and even more surprising was that inclusion of tropomyosin drastically retarded the rate of polymerization of the actin in terms of prolonging the nucleation phase and producing a much slower rate of elongation prior to the attainment of the steady state. This result is consistent with the fragmentation behavior proposed for the mutant actin. Effect of the R177H Mutation on Polymerization-induced PiRelease—Because Arg177 had originally been implicated as being important in determining Pi release rates from F-actin following polymerization-induced hydrolysis of ATP, we assessed the effects of the cardiofunk mutation on this process. Fig. 6 shows that the rate of Pi release tracks with the elongation phase of actin polymerization, just as it does for WT actin. However, for the mutant, we repeatedly detected a significant rate of Pi release during the lag phase preceding elongation, where there is no net filament formation. This result suggests that the addition of salt to induce polymerization of the R177H actin leads to significant postnucleation abortive oligomer formation during which F-actin-like nucleotide hydrolysis is occurring. Effect of the R177H Mutation on F-actin Monomer Conformation—The location of Arg177 near the bottom of the nucleotide cleft possibly in association with His73 of subdomain I suggested that introduction of His for the Arg might weaken interdomain connections enough to control the conformation of the actin monomer within the confines of the filament structure. To begin to test this possibility, we employed intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements. Actin polymerization is usually characterized by a decrease in intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence (23Selden L.A. Kinosian H.J. Estes J.E. Gershman L.C. Adv. Exp. Med. Biol. 1994; 358: 51-57Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar) caused by an alteration in the environment of three tryptophans in subdomain 1 (24Doyle T.C. Hansen J.E. Reisler E. Biophys. J. 2001; 80: 427-434Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Fig. 7 shows that at 4.6 μm the G-actin intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of both WT and R177H actins are essentially the same. However, whereas the usual postpolymerization decrease is observed with WT actin, no such decrease at all is seen with the mutant, suggesting that these tryptophans in the mutant remain in a much more hydrophobic environment than they do in the WT protein. Another way of examining conformation changes in subdomain I is to assess the fluorescence behavior of a pyrene attached either as a pyrene-acetamide or pyrene succinimide group to the sulfhydryl residue of Cys374 adjacent to the protein's C terminus. Polymerization normally produces an increase in pyrene fluorescence (25Cooper J.A. Walker S.B. Pollard T.D. J. Muscle Res. Cell Motil. 1983; 4: 253-262Crossref PubMed Scopus (364) Google Scholar). We thus assessed the change in pyrene fluorescence of labeled 4.6 μm WT and R177H actins. Because of critical concentration differences, this amount of mutant G-actin should have yielded about 2.6 μm F-actin, producing about 50% of the fluorescence of that amount of WT actin (Fig. 8, line 5). Fig. 8 shows, however, that the percentage change in fluorescence of the mutant was only 25% of that of a comparable amount of the WT protein. This result, a decrease in fluorescence yield, again demonstrates a profound change in the conformation of subdomain 1 caused by the introduction of this mutation.Fig. 8Fluorescence emission spectra of pyrene-labeled WT and R177H before and after polymerization.

In the present work, we cloned the extremely aspartic acid-rich proteins from skeletal muscle of a commercially important species, walleye pollack, in the course of molecular identification of trimethylamine-N-oxide demethylase (TMAOase). One of the cDNAs, designated as aspolin1, encodes an extremely aspartic acid-rich protein of 228 amino acids which is converted to the TMAOase after processing between Ala42 and Asp43.

Several physiological roles of TMAO in teleost have been proposed, i.e. osmoregulation, cryoprotectant, protection of proteins from high pressure, and disulfide formation (3Sotelo C.G. Rehbein H. Haard N.F. Simpson B.K. Seafood Enzymes. Dekker, New York2000: 167-190Google Scholar). Gadoid fishes, including cod, pollack, hake, whiting, and haddock, are commercially important and contain large amounts of TMAO (30–130 mmol/kg) in their muscle (1Dyer W.J. J. Fish. Res.

The occurrence of formaldehyde markedly deteriorates the fish meat by the crosslinking of muscle protein. As a result, fish fillet loses elasticity and develops a sponge-like texture that is unsuitable for surimi products (seafood items that are made of fish-meat gel and sometimes look like crab, scallop, etc.) owing to the decrease in the solubility of myofibril at high-salt concentrations (5Tokunaga T. Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi. 1974; 40: 167-174Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar, 6Castell C.H. Smith B. Dyer W.J. J. Fish. Res. Board Can. 1973; 30: 1205-1213Crossref Google Scholar). TMAO demethylase (TMAOase, or trimethylamine-N-oxide formaldehyde-lyase, EC 4.1.2.32) has been proposed to be responsible for the formaldehyde synthesis by TMAO demethylation during frozen storage of fish meat (3Sotelo C.G. Rehbein H. Haard N.F. Simpson B.K. Seafood Enzymes. Dekker, New York2000: 167-190Google Scholar). TMAOase activity has been detected in kidney, spleen, pyloric caecum, liver, dark muscle, and ordinary muscle of gadoid and non-gadoid fish (3Sotelo C.G. Rehbein H. Haard N.F. Simpson B.K. Seafood Enzymes. Dekker, New York2000: 167-190Google Scholar). Some cofactor systems have been developed for the separation of the enzyme; flavin-NAD(P)H and Fe2+-ascorbatecysteine with or without methylene blue under aerobic or anaerobic conditions (3Sotelo C.G. Rehbein H. Haard N.F. Simpson B.K. Seafood Enzymes. Dekker, New York2000: 167-190Google Scholar). Despite the efforts to purify the enzyme, it has not been possible to identify the detailed component(s) of the enzyme, primarily because of the insolubility and the complex cofactor requirement of this enzyme (7Gill T.A. Paulson A.T. Comp. Biochem. Physiol. 1982; 71B: 49-56Google Scholar, 8Parkin K.L. Hultin H.O. J. Biochem. 1986; 100: 87-97Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar, 9Joly A. Cottin P. Han-Ching L. Ducastaing A. J. Sci. Food Agric. 1992; 59: 261-267Crossref Scopus (13) Google Scholar). Walleye pollack is caught in the northern Pacific and is the most important source of surimi products. Recently, TMAOase was detected and purified from the myofibrillar fraction of walleye pollack (10Kimura M. Seki N. Kimura I. Fish. Sci. 2000; 66: 725-729Crossref Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 11Kimura M. Seki N. Kimura I. Fish. Sci. 2000; 66: 967-973Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). The walleye pollack enzyme was characterized as a single acidic protein with an apparent molecular mass of 25 kDa. This enzyme required Fe2+ for its activity and showed an optimum pH at 7.0; the Km value for TMAO was 30 mm. The activity of this enzyme was stable in the presence of SDS. Furthermore, the enzyme activity was retained after heating at 80 °C for 30 min, suggesting an extremely high thermal stability (12Kimura M. Kimura I. Seki N. Fish. Sci. 2003; 69: 414-420Crossref Scopus (16) Google Scholar). In this paper, we report the novel extremely aspartic acid-rich proteins found in the course of the molecular identification of walleye pollack muscle TMAOase. Our cDNA cloning revealed that this enzyme is one of the two homologous proteins containing the extremely long Asp polymer, an uninterrupted stretch (except for a single Glu residue) of 171 Asp residues. We demonstrate that the TMAO demethylation activity of this protein arises from the interaction of poly Asp and Fe2+. Materials—Walleye pollack Theragra chalcogramma caught off the northern Hakodate coast was used for protein and RNA preparation. Aspartic acid monomer, oligomer, and polymer were obtained from Sigma. Poly glutamic acid was obtained from ICN. TMAO was obtained from Aldrich. Purification and Analysis of Walleye Pollack TMAOase—The TMAOase was purified from the myofibrillar fraction of walleye pollack skeletal muscle according to the method reported previously (11Kimura M. Seki N. Kimura I. Fish. Sci. 2000; 66: 967-973Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). After dialysis against distilled water, the protein was lyophilized. Phosphate was detected by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and aluminum nitrate (13Hegenauer J. Ripley L. Nace G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar). Carbohydrate was detected by the phenol-sulfuric acid method, periodic acid Schiff staining, or staining with a GelCode glycoprotein staining kit (Pierce). Amino acid composition analysis of the purified enzyme was performed by o-phthalaldehyde post-column labeling method using high pressure liquid chromatography. The amino-terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed with a Hewlett-Packard G1005A protein sequencing system. Molecular mass of the purified protein was measured by electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry using a Sciex API300 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (PerkinElmer Life Sciences). cDNA Cloning and Sequencing—Poly(A)+ RNA was isolated from walleye pollack skeletal muscle using Quik-Prep micro mRNA purification kit (Amersham Biosciences). Double-strand cDNA was synthesized by using the SuperScript system (Invitrogen) and ligated to λEx-Cell vector (Amersham Biosciences). An oligonucleotide corresponding to a stretch of Asp hexamer (5′-GAYGAYGAYGAYGAYGAYG-3′) was 5′ end-labeled with [γ-32P]ATP and used for plaque hybridization. Positive phage clones were excised according to the manufacturer's instructions by using an Escherichia coli NP66 in vivo release system. The clones in pExCell plasmid were sequenced with an ABI 3700 automated DNA sequencer. Tissue Distribution of Aspolin1 and Aspolin2 mRNA—Total RNA was prepared from walleye pollack tissues by the acid guanidine-phenol chloroform method and reverse-transcribed using the oligo dT primer. Aspolin1, aspolin2, and actin transcripts were detected by PCR using the following primers: 5′-CATGAAGAGTTATGAGCACTCTGG-3′ (aspolin1 forward), 5′-CTGTTCTTTACTGCCCTCTACAGA-3′ (aspolin1 reverse), 5′-CAGTACTTATCACAAGGGCTCTG-3′ (aspolin2 forward), 5′-GAACAGTAATACACAATATGCTCAG-3′ (aspolin2 reverse), 5′-GAGAAGATGACCCAGATCATG-3′ (actin forward), 5′-CCACATCTGCTGGAAGGTGGA-3′ (actin reverse). PCR was performed using the Taq polymerase under the following conditions: 25 cycles at 94 °C for 15 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 1 min 30 s. Amplified products were analyzed by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Measurement of TMAO Demethylation Activity—For measurement of TMAO demethylation activity at room temperature, the method of Kimura et al. (11Kimura M. Seki N. Kimura I. Fish. Sci. 2000; 66: 967-973Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) was used with slight modification. Peptides or amino acids were mixed with 10 mm Tris acetate, pH 7.0, containing 20 mm TMAO and 0.2 mm FeCl2. The reaction was terminated by the addition of 5% trichloroacetic acid. DMA in this solution was quantified by the copper-dithiocarbamate procedure (14Dyer W.J. Mounsey Y.A. J. Fish. Res. Board Can. 1945; 6: 359-367Crossref Google Scholar). Peptide content was determined by the biuret method using bovine serum albumin as a standard. For the measurement of TMAO demethylation activity in the frozen state, 20 mm HEPES-NaOH, pH 6.9, containing 10 mm TMAO and 0.2 mm FeCl2, was used. After thawing the reaction mixture on ice, DMA was immediately quantified as described above. Iron Binding Assay—Purified protein (15 μg/ml) was mixed with 20–500 μm FeCl2 in 10 mm Tris acetate buffer, pH 7.0, containing 5 mm ascorbic acid and placed at 25 °C for 30 min. Free iron was separated by ultrafiltration using a Microcon-3 column (Millipore). Iron concentration of the initial mixture and the through fraction of ultrafiltration were measured by a bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid method using an Fe test kit (Wako). Bound iron was calculated by subtraction of filtrated iron from the initial iron content. Molecular Properties of Walleye Pollack TMAOase—To investigate the primary structure of purified TMAOase, the N-terminal amino acid sequence was analyzed. Fifteen amino acids from the N terminus were determined as DDDDDDDDDAGDDDD (Table I). Because the purified protein was resistant to digestion with trypsin and lysylendopeptidase, attempts to analyze internal amino acid sequence were unsuccessful. The results of the N-terminal amino acid sequencing indicate the processing of the protein after translation. Amino acid composition analysis revealed that an ∼90% molar ratio of amino acids of purified protein was Asp or Asn (Table II). As for other amino acids, His, Glu or Gln, Gly, Ala, Leu, and Lys were also detected at ≥ 0.4% molar ratio. Ser, Thr, Pro, Val, Ile, and Arg were detected at trace levels. Cys, Met, Tyr, and Phe were not detected at all. To estimate the number of each amino acid in a single protein molecule, the molecular mass of the protein was measured by mass spectrometry. As shown in Table I, the molecular weight of the purified protein was 21,389, which is a little smaller than that estimated from SDS-PAGE (11Kimura M. Seki N. Kimura I. Fish. Sci. 2000; 66: 967-973Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). On the other hand, neither phosphate nor carbohydrate was detected in the purified protein (data not shown). Because it seems that the purified protein is not subject to major post-translational modification other than the processing of peptide, the number of amino acids in the protein can be estimated. Based on the molecular weight of the aspartic acid residue (115) and the purified protein, about 180 amino acids are contained in the purified protein. According to this assumption, the number of each amino acid was estimated as shown in Table II.Table IMolecular characteristics of walleye pollack TMAOaseN-terminal amino acid sequenceDDDDDDDDDAGDDDDMolecular weight SDS-PAGEaRef. 11.25,000 Mass spectrometry21,389 Deduced from cDNA21,383Carbohydrate-Phosphate-Absorbance at 280 nmaRef. 11.-Stainability with CBBR 250aRef. 11.- Stains allbRef. 12.+a Ref. 11Kimura M.

Therefore, we carried out the screening of the cDNA library of walleye pollack skeletal muscle using an oligonucleotide probe corresponding to the amino acid sequence, DDDDDD. As a result, two species of clone, designated as aspolin1 and aspolin2, containing open reading frames encoding extremely Asp-rich proteins, were obtained. To confirm the number of GAY repeats in these clones, RT-PCR was performed, and amplified products were cloned and sequenced (data not shown). Finally, the nucleotide sequence of two species of cDNA was determined (Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, the 5′ noncoding region and the former part of coding region of two clones have a common nucleotide sequence. Deduced amino acid sequences of aspolin1 and aspolin2 are aligned in Fig. 2. Amino acid sequences of aspolin1 and aspolin2 contain 182 and 225 amino acids of Asp polymer, respectively, with a few inserts of other amino acids.Fig. 2Amino acid sequence alignment of walleye pollack aspolin1 and aspolin2.Asterisks show the common amino acids between aspolin1 and aspolin2. Cysteines in C-terminal region of aspolin2 are underlined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) The N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified protein corresponds to the peptide stretch from Asp43 to Asp57 in aspolin1 and aspolin2. Assuming that the processing of the peptide occurs between Ala42 and Asp43, the molecular weight of the mature aspolin1 protein is calculated as 21,383 (Table I). This value is almost identical to the molecular weight of the purified protein obtained by mass spectrometry, 21,389. Furthermore, the number of each amino acid in mature aspolin1 is almost identical with that estimated from amino acid analysis, except for His and Lys (Table II). Thus, we concluded that aspolin1 encodes the precursor of the purified walleye pollack TMAOase. Primary Structure of Aspolin1/pre-TMAOase and Aspolin2— Proteins encoded by aspolin1/pre-TMAOase and aspolin2 cDNAs have 228 and 347 amino acids, respectively. It seems that both proteins contain 42 amino acids of pre-peptide at the N terminus. Mature aspolin1/TMAOase protein consists of a 182-amino acid stretch of Asp polymer and a C-terminal of 4 amino acids, His-Glu-Glu-Leu. In the Asp polymer region, there are three amino acids other than Asp, namely Ala52, Gly53, and Glu81. The deduced amino acid sequence of aspolin1/pre-TMAOase did not show homology to any known proteins in the data base. On the other hand, putative mature aspolin2 protein consists of a 225 amino acid stretch of Asp polymer and a C-terminal cysteine-rich region. The Asp polymer region of aspolin2 contains Ala52, Gly53, and Glu81, as well as aspolin1, and a His-Glu-Ala-Gly sequence at the amino acid position 225. The C-terminal region contains 14 Cys residues, and each of the Cys residues is spaced with 1–3 amino acid(s) other than Cys. The data base search revealed that the Cys-rich region of aspolin2 is highly homologous to mammalian histidine-rich calcium-binding protein (HRC) (Fig. 3; Ref. 15Hofmann S.L. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18083-18090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Tissue Distribution of Aspolin1/TMAOase and Aspolin2 mRNA—The tissue distribution of aspolin1/TMAOase and aspolin2 mRNAs was analyzed by RT-PCR (Fig. 4). Both aspolin1/TMAOase and aspolin2 mRNAs were most abundant in skeletal muscle. Moderate amounts of both mRNAs were detected in kidney, and traces of the mRNAs were also detected in heart, spleen, and brain. Neither mRNA was detected in liver, stomach, pyloric caecum, intestine, and fin. None of the amplified band was detected in the control without reverse transcription (data not shown). TMAO Demethylation Activity of Poly Asp—To identify the region of mature aspolin1/TMAOase responsible for the TMAOase activity, we attempted to have aspolin1/TMAOase cDNA expressed in E. coli, COS-7 cells, and a wheat germ cell-free system. Probably because of the special characteristic of the primary structure of aspolin1/TMAOase, all of these trials were unsuccessful. Therefore, we analyzed the TMAO demethylation activity of synthetic poly Asp. Surprisingly, synthetic poly Asp showed a marked TMAO demethylation activity. As shown in Fig. 5, the relative TMAO demethylation activity of poly Asp 8k was as much as that of purified TMAOase. The activity of poly Asp 35k was 1.7× as much as that of purified TMAOase. To examine whether polymerization of Asp is required for TMAO demethylation activity, the activity of l-Asp monomer, dimer, and tetramer were measured. None of these small molecules, however, showed definite activity (Fig. 5). To examine whether carboxyl groups in the side chains of poly Asp are responsible for TMAO demethylation activity, the activity of poly Glu was measured. As shown in Fig. 5, poly Glu showed TMAO demethylation activity, although its level was relatively low. Because TMAO demethylation in muscle of walleye pollack occurs during frozen storage, TMAO demethylation activity of poly Asp in the frozen state was measured. As shown in Fig. 6, poly Asp promoted TMAO demethylation both at –20 °C and –50 °C. The plateau level of DMA synthesis at –20 °C was more than twice as high as that at –50 °C. Iron Binding of Purified TMAOase—A previous report (11Kimura M. Seki N. Kimura I. Fish. Sci. 2000; 66: 967-973Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar) demonstrated that TMAO demethylation catalyzed by the walleye pollack TMAOase required an Fe2+ as a cofactor. To examine the binding capacity of purified TMAOase to Fe2+, an iron binding assay was performed by an ultrafiltration-based method. Iron binding of purified TMAOase exhibited a sigmoidal dependence on Fe2+ concentration (Fig. 7). The bound/free ratio of Fe2+ was not more than 0.25. At the concentration of Fe2+ used in the TMAO demethylation assay, bound Fe2+ amounted to about ¼ of the carboxyl groups of the Asp side chain of TMAOase. At higher concentrations of Fe2+, however, bound Fe2+ continued to increase. Nucleotide sequences of aspolin cDNAs contain long GAY repeats encoding poly Asp. In general, a correct analysis of such a repeat sequence is difficult because of the problem of sequencing chemistry. For this reason, we carefully analyzed nucleotide sequences to confirm the accuracy of the presented sequences. In the nucleotide sequences of the aspolin cDNAs, two kinds of codons for Asp, GAC, and GAU, appear randomly. Because this random mixture of GAC and GAU ensured the specificity of sequence and avoided slippage, the sequencing pattern of the GAY-repeat region was very stable (data not shown). On the other hand, cDNA in cloning vector and PCR product were rather unstable (data not shown). Therefore, we cloned the RT-PCR product containing the GAY region and sequenced several clones to confirm the correct sequences. As for aspolin1/TMAOase, the calculated molecular weight from deduced amino acid sequence and the actual value from mass spectrometry were almost identical (Table I), supporting that the idea that cDNA was derived from a functional mRNA. Nucleotide sequences upstream from GAA, corresponding to Glu226, are common to aspolin1/pre-TMAOase and aspolin2 (Fig. 1). This sequence identity indicates that each mRNA is generated by alternative splicing. According to the N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis, aspolin1/pre-TMAOase preprotein is processed between Ala42 and Asp43. If the processing of aspolin2 protein depends on the N-terminal amino acid sequence, aspolin2 is processed at the same position as aspolin1/pre-TMAOase. The amino acid sequence of the C-terminal region of aspolin2 is very similar to that of mammalian HRC (Fig. 3). HRC is known as a Ca2+-binding protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum (16Hofmann S.L. Brown M.S. Lee E. Pathak R.K. Anderson R.G.W. Goldstein J.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8260-8270Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Because aspolin2 mRNA is also abundant in skeletal muscle, aspolin2 may appear to be a fish homologue of HRC. However, the molecular mass of HRC, 165 kDa, is much higher than that of aspolin2, 35 kDa. Furthermore, HRC contains 9 tandem repeats of a 29-residue sequence consisting of a stretch of 10–11 acidic amino acids and a histidine-rich sequence (15Hofmann S.L. Goldstein J.L. Orth K. Moomaw C.R. Slaughter C.A. Brown M.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 18083-18090Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Although both HRC and aspolin2 have C-terminal cysteine-rich regions and are rich in acidic amino acids, the overall structures of these molecules are quite different. Poly Asp in aspolin is reminiscent of another Ca2+-binding protein of sarcoplasmic reticulum, calsequestrin. Skeletal muscle calsequestrins have a cluster of 10–45 acidic residues, typically aspartates, at C terminus (17Fliegel L. Ohnishi M. Carpenter M.R. Khanna V.K. Reithmeier R.A.F. MacLennan D.H. Proc.

Gene. 1998; 217: 25-30Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). Calsequestrin binds Ca2+ with high capacity (40–50 Ca2+/molecule) and moderate affinity (22Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar, 23Berchtold M.W. Brinkmeier H. Müntener M. Physiol. Rev. 2000; 80: 1215-1265Crossref PubMed Scopus (696) Google Scholar). Negatively charged carboxyl groups of acidic residues are thought to be responsible for Ca2+ binding. A recent study (24Shin D.W. Ma J. Kim D.H. FEBS Lett. 2000; 486: 178-182Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar) showed that binding of Ca2+ is highly dependent on the C-terminal Asp-rich region. It has been proposed that the length of the C-terminal Asp-rich region may be important for the Ca2+ binding capacity of calsequestrin (22Yano K. Zarain-Herzberg A. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 135: 61-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (139) Google Scholar). According to this report, mature aspolin1/TMAOase and aspolin2 are expected to have high Ca2+ binding capacity. Therefore, aspolins may be a Ca2+-binding protein in fish muscle. Although no aspolin ortholog was found in the protein data base, a similar nucleotide sequence was found in the genomic data base of tiger puffer (data not shown). We also found some aspolin-like nucleotide sequences in amphibian expressed sequence tag (GenBank™/EBI accession numbers BQ731479, BJ073162, and BQ524571). However, none of the aspolin-like sequences was found in sequences of the other groups of vertebrate. Because fish and amphibian are poikilothermic animals, aspolins may contribute to the adaptation to lower temperature. The present paper shows that poly Asp is the real component of walleye pollack TMAOase. TMAO demethylation catalyzed by Fe2+ and small ligands were studied in terms of rearrangement of detoxication in liver (25Craig J.C. Dwyer F.P. Glazer A.N. Horning E.C. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961; 83: 1871-1878Crossref Scopus (32) Google Scholar, 26Ferris J.P. Gerwe R.D. Gapski G.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5270-5275Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar, 27Ferris J.P. Gerwe R.D. Gapski G.R. J. Org. Chem. 1968; 33: 3493-3498Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). In these reports, it is shown that Fe2+ and various chelating agents with carboxyl group, such as oxalic acid, malic acid, and aspartic acid, catalyze the TMAO demethylation at 80 °C. Although these chelating agents are comparable with poly Asp in the present study, the reaction with poly Asp proceeded under much milder condition. Therefore, polymerization of the carboxyl group is important for the catalytic activity under mild conditions. Ferris et al. (26Ferris J.P. Gerwe R.D. Gapski G.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1967; 89: 5270-5275Crossref Scopus (42) Google Scholar) proposed the model of TMAO demethylation catalyzed by Fe2+ chelated with oxalic acid and suggested the importance of the two adjacent nonchelated sites on the iron. As shown in Fig. 7, affinity of poly Asp for Fe2+ was relatively low. Labile interaction between Fe2+ and carboxyl groups of poly Asp may be necessary for the catalytic activity. This assumption is consistent with the high Km value of walleye pollack TMAOase reported previously (11Kimura M. Seki N. Kimura I. Fish. Sci. 2000; 66: 967-973Crossref Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Whether aspolins catalyze TMAO in vivo or not is unknown. However, aspolins are not likely to act as TMAO catalytic enzymes in vivo for several reasons. Because the circular dichroism spectrum of purified TMAOase at the neutral condition suggested the random coil structure (13Hegenauer J. Ripley L. Nace G. Anal. Biochem. 1977; 78: 308-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (75) Google Scholar), it is unlikely that TMAOase has a single effective active center. The low affinity of aspolin1/TMAOase for ferrous ion suggests that catalytic activity would be very low in vivo because the concentration of free ferrous ion in live cells is kept at a very low level, 0.2–0.5 μm (28Richardson D.R. Ponka P. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1997; 1331: 1-40Crossref PubMed Scopus (593) Google Scholar). In the present study, TMAO demethylation with Fe2+ and poly Asp occurred even in the frozen state at –20 °C and –50 °C. It has been reported (29Monkovic I. Wong H. Bachand C. Synthesis. 1985; : 770-773Crossref Scopus (38) Google Scholar) that iron-catalyzed dealkylation of tertiary amine oxides proceeds around –10 °C. This reaction feature is consistent with the TMAO demethylation in the walleye pollack muscle during frozen storage (5Tokunaga T. Nippon Suisan Gakkaishi. 1974; 40: 167-174Crossref Scopus (48) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we have identified novel extremely aspartic acid-rich proteins, aspolin1 and aspolin2, in fish skeletal muscle and demonstrated that poly Asp in these proteins promotes iron-mediated demethylation of TMAO under frozen conditions as well as at room temperature. Aspolins may act as calcium-binding proteins and are unlikely to be TMAO catalytic enzymes in vivo. According to these results, a possible scenario of formaldehyde synthesis in fish meat during frozen storage might occur as follows. After the death of the fish, free ferrous ions are generated by the degradation of heme and the release from iron-binding proteins like ferritin and transferrin. Then, ferrous ions bind to the poly Asp region of aspolin and other proteins and exhibit the TMAO demethylating activity. The prevention of the formaldehyde synthesis based on the presented mechanism can contribute to a longer shelf life and safety of gadoid flesh. We thank Dr. N.

C., Jarjour, I. T., O'Driscoll, K. R., and De Vivo, D. C. (1999) Neurochem. Res. 24, 587–594). To investigate the molecular basis for the associated functional deficit, we constructed T310A, T310S, and T310I human GLUT1 mutants for expression in Xenopus laevis oocytes via cRNA injection. For all mutants, glucose transport was decreased, and osmotic water permeability (Pf) was increased. Km values for 3-O-methylglucose (3-OMG) uptake under zero-trans influx and equilibrium exchange influx conditions were, respectively, 13 ± 1 and 68 ± 5 mm for wild-type Glut1, 5 ± 1 and 25 ± 6 mm for T310A, 6 ± 3 and 30 ± 6 mm for T310I, and 5 ± 1 and 48 ± 5 mm for T310S. Compared with wild-type Glut1, we determined the following. (a) Zero-trans and equilibrium exchange influx values of 3-OMG were significantly decreased, respectively, 15 and 5% in T310A, 8 and 3% in T310I, and 40 and 34% in T310S mutants. (b) Zero-trans efflux of 3-OMG and dehydroascorbic acid uptake were significantly decreased in mutants. (c) The relative Pf values for T310A, T310I, and T310S were increased 3-, 4.8-, and 3.5-fold compared with wild-type values. We found a very high negative correlation between the rate of glucose uptake and Pf (–0.93), and between hydropathy and uptake (–0.92), a moderate correlation between hydropathy and Pf (0.73), and a minimal correlation between uptake, Pf, and molecular weight. These findings are consistent with a central role for hydropathy rather than size at position 310 of this mutation. We have previously reported on a patient with the Glut1 deficiency syndrome (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man number 606777) carrying a heterozygous T310I missense mutation in the GLUT1 gene (Klepper, J., Wang, D., Fischbarg, J., Vera, J.

GLUT1 is the first identified member of the solute carrier 2A(SLC2A) family, which now has 13 members (1.Joost H.G. Thorens B. Mol. Membr. Biol. 2001; 18: 247-256Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar). It is expressed in most cells and is conspicuous in blood-tissue barriers, notably the blood-brain barrier (BBB). 1The abbreviations used are: BBBblood-brain barrierDHAdehydroascorbic acid3-OMG3-O-methylglucosePfosmotic water permeabilityWTwild-type.1The abbreviations used are: BBBblood-brain barrierDHAdehydroascorbic acid3-OMG3-O-methylglucosePfosmotic water permeabilityWTwild-type. Glucose is the predominant fuel for brain metabolism. It passes from the blood through the capillary endothelial cells of the BBB, traversing the luminal membrane, cytoplasm and abluminal membrane to the brain extracellular pool. An asymmetric distribution of Glut1 on the luminal and abluminal endothelial membranes has been shown by immunogold electron microscopy in human, rabbit, rat, squirrel, and monkey (2.Pardridge W.M. Semin. Cell Biol. 1991; 2: 419-426PubMed Google Scholar, 3.Cornford E.M. Hyman S. Swartz B.E. J. Cereb. Blood Flow Metab. 1994; 14: 106-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar, 4.Farrell C.L. Pardridge W.M. J. Neurosci. Methods. 1991; 37: 103-110Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). The GLUT1 gene is ∼35 kb long containing 10 exons and 9 introns and is mapped to the short arm of chromosome 1 (1p35-p31.3). The Glut1 transporter protein consists of 492 amino acids and 12 predicted transmembrane domains with both amino and carboxyl termini in the cytosol (5.Mueckler M. Caruso C. Baldwin S.A. Panico M. Blench I. Morris H.R. Allard W.J. Lienhard G.E. Lodish H.F. Science. 1985; 229: 941-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (1131) Google Scholar). Glut1 can also transport H2O (6.Fischbarg J. Kuang K.Y. Vera J.C.

These studies have provided additional insights into the structure/function relationships within Glut1.Based on experimental observations of substituted cysteine accessibility, Mueckler and Makepeace argued that a glucose-transporting pathway in Glut1 could be lined by helices 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11 (17.Mueckler M. Makepeace C. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 3498-3503Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (44) Google Scholar). Based on the suggested helical bundle arrangement of Lac permease, Zuniga et al. recently proposed a three-dimensional model for Glut1 that accounts for mutational and biochemical evidence (18.Zuniga F.A. Shi G. Haller J.F. Rubashkin A. Flynn D.R. Iserovich P. Fischbarg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44970-44975Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar).Carruthers proposed that Glut1 exists in the erythrocyte membrane as a homotetramer with cooperative interaction between two Glut1 dimers (8.Carruthers A. Physiol. Rev. 1990; 70: 1135-1176Crossref PubMed Scopus (324) Google Scholar). Within each dimer, one subunit has its sugar uptake site exposed, whereas the other has its sugar exit site accessible. At any instant, two subunits must present an uptake (e2) state and two subunits must present an exit (e1) state. A two-channel model such as this satisfactorily accounts for most of the kinetic data that conflict with the simple alternating conformational model (19.Cloherty E.K. Levine K.B. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 2001; 40: 15549-15561Crossref PubMed Scopus (49) Google Scholar). More recently, arguments have been advanced for the presence of two transport channels within a monomer (20.Iserovich P. Wang D. Ma L. Yang H. Zuniga F.A. Pascual J.M. Kuang K. De Vivo D.C. Fischbarg J. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 30991-30997Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar).Glut1 Deficiency Syndrome (Glut1 DS) was first described by De Vivo et al. in 1991 (21.De Vivo D.C. Trifiletti R.R. Jacobson R.I. Ronen G.M. Behmand R.A. Harik S.I. N. Engl. J. Med. 1991; 325: 703-709Crossref PubMed Scopus (600) Google Scholar). This syndrome is characterized by infantile seizures, acquired microcephaly, developmental delay, persistent hypoglycorrhachia (cerebrospinal fluid glucose < 40 mg/dl), and decreased erythrocyte glucose uptake (46 ± 8% of control). About 100 patients have been diagnosed worldwide since 1991. Glut1 deficiency syndrome is due to impaired facilitative glucose transport across the BBB. Glut1 immunoreactivity in erythrocyte membranes may be normal or 50% reduced (22.Seidner G. Alvarez M.G. Yeh J.I. O'Driscoll K.R. Klepper J. Stump T.S. Wang D. Spinner N.B. Birnbaum M.J. De Vivo D.C.

Res. 1999; 24: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Fluorescence in situ hybridization and mutational analysis of the GLUT1 gene has revealed either hemizygosity or heterozygosity for missense, nonsense, insertion, deletion, and splice site mutations (24.Wang D. Kranz-Eble P. De Vivo D.C. Hum. Mutat. 2000; 16: 224-231Crossref PubMed Scopus (125) Google Scholar).We reported previously on a 6-year-old girl with infantile seizures and hypoglycorrhachia (cerebrospinal fluid glucose 27 mg/dl, blood glucose 83 mg/dl), and decreased erythrocyte 3-OMG uptake (46% of control) (23.Klepper J. Wang D. Fischbarg J. Vera J.C. Jarjour I.T. O'Driscoll K.R. De Vivo D.C. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). The erythrocyte Glut1 immunoreactivity was normal. Direct DNA sequencing identified a missense mutation, T310I (23.Klepper J. Wang D. Fischbarg J. Vera J.C. Jarjour I.T. O'Driscoll K.R. De Vivo D.C. Neurochem. Res. 1999; 24: 587-594Crossref PubMed Scopus (84) Google Scholar). Here, we report the pathogenic basis for this mutation using Xenopus laevis oocyte expression of wild-type Glut1 and its mutants T310A, T310S, and T310I. Our studies show that the size and hydrophilicity of the side chain at position 310 play an important role in Glut1 functioning. Our results reaffirm that T310I is a pathogenic mutation causing Glut1 deficiency and represent the first report of functional and kinetic studies on a disease-causing missense mutation located in the wall of the predicted glucose channel.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESMutagenesis and cRNA Preparation from cDNA Templates—A 1913-base pair Eco47III and HindIII GLUT1 cDNA fragment derived from pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) was subcloned into a customer plasmid (pM) containing fragments of 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions of Xenopus β-globin cDNA. 2J. M. Pascual, D. Wang, H. Yang, and D. C. De Vivo, unpublished results. The desired segment was digested with EcoRI, filled in with T4 DNA polymerase, and then cut by HindIII. This newly constructed plasmid was named pM-GLUT1 and was confirmed by direct DNA sequencing with appropriate primers. The forward and reverse mutagenic primers for T310A, T310I, and T310S were as follows: T310A forward, CCTGTGTATGCCGCCATTGGCTCAGGTATCGTCAACACGGCC and T310A reverse, GAAGGGC CGTGTTGACGATACCTGAGCCAATGGCGGCATACACAGG; T310I forward, CCTGTGTATGCCATCATTGGCTCAGGTATCGTCAACACGGCC and T310I reverse, GAAGGGCCGTGTTGACGATACCTGAGCCAATGATGGCATACACAGG; and T310S forward, CCTGTGTATGCCAGCATTGGCTCAGGTATCGTCAACACGGCC and T310S reverse, GAAGGGCCGTGTTGACGATACCTGAGCCAATGCTGGCATACACAGG. The three boldfaced nucleotides are the codes for mutated amino acids.PCR was conducted on the pM-GLUT1 plasmid DNA using the above primers for 35 cycles with denaturation at 95 °C for 30 s, annealing at 58 °C for 1 min, and elongation at 72 °C for 2 min. The PCR product was verified by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. The correctly sized PCR fragment was purified from the gel and cut with StuI and MunI. The gel-purified StuI and MunI fragment was then directly ligated into the StuI and MunI sites of pM-GLUT1. The presence of the mutations T310A, T310I, and T310S was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis. Capped, runoff cRNA transcripts of wild-type and mutant GLUT1 were synthesized from pm-GLUT1 constructs after linearization at a unique NotI site using an mMessage mMachine kit (Ambion, Austin, TX). cRNAs were quantified by incorporation of a [3H]UTP tracer in the transcription reaction, and their integrity was verified by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis. cRNAs were stored at –80 °C until the time of dilution in 100 mm KCl for injection.Xenopus Oocyte Studies—Oocytes were prepared as described (25.Vera J.C. Rosen O.M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4187-4195Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar). The largest undamaged oocytes (stages V and VI) were transferred to Barth's solution, incubated overnight at 18 °C, and injected the following day. Oocytes were injected with either 50 nl of water, 50 nl of wild-type cRNA, or 50 nl of mutant cRNA (1 ng/nl) and kept in Barth's medium at 18 °C for 72 h.Xenopus oocyte transport assays were done as described by Due et al. with modifications (26.Due A.D. Qu Z.C. Thomas J.M. Buchs A. Powers A.C. May J.M. Biochemistry. 1995; 34: 5462-5471Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). In the zero-trans and equilibrium exchange influx studies, parallel assays were undertaken using oocytes injected with water as a control. These control transport rates were subtracted from the transport rates determined in oocytes expressing mutant and wild-type Glut1. Only net transport rates are shown.Zero-trans influx of 3-OMG and deoxyglucose, equilibrium exchange influx of 3-OMG, and zero-trans influx of DHA into Xenopus oocytes were determined as described previously (20.Iserovich P. Wang D. Ma L. Yang H. Zuniga F.A. Pascual J.M. Kuang K. De Vivo D.C. Fischbarg J. J. Biol.

Zero-trans efflux of 3-OMG into Xenopus oocytes was performed by injecting different amounts of 14C-labeled 3-OMG together with unlabeled 3-OMG to reach calculated concentrations of 1–50 mm in oocytes expressing wild-type and mutant T310I Glut1 (assuming a 0.5-μl water space in an average oocyte) (28.Gould G.W. Lienhard G.E. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 9447-9452Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). We chose the injection procedure, because the T310I mutant has a very limited glucose transport capacity. After injection, immediately before the efflux assay, oocytes were quickly washed three times in 2 ml of Barth's solution and transferred to a scintillation vial containing 0.5 ml of Barth's solution. After 2 min, the oocyte was transferred to another scintillation vial, and then 0.5 ml of 0.1% SDS was added to both vials and mixed by vortex. Five microliters of Hionic-Fluor™ scintillation fluid (Packard Bioscience B. V., Groningen, The Netherlands) were added before counting. The measured amount of glucose in both vials was used to evaluate the actual intracellular glucose concentration during the efflux measurement. The efflux rate from control oocytes (oocytes injected with water instead of cRNA) was subtracted for the calculations for both the wild-type and T310I mutant-expressing oocytes.Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy permitted detection of Glut1 in frozen X. laevis oocyte sections as described by Garcia et al. (29.Garcia J.C. Strube M. Leingang K. Keller K. Mueckler M.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 7770-7776Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Goat polyclonal IgG (Glut1 C20) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) was used as primary antibody, and Alexa Fluor™ 568-conjugated donkey anti-goat IgG (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) was used as the secondary antibody. Confocal microscopy was performed at the Optical Microscopy Facility at Columbia University.Membranes from injected oocytes (same set of oocytes used for uptake studies) were prepared by a modified method (27.Brockmann K.

Briefly, 50 oocytes were suspended in 50 μl per oocyte homogenization buffer (10 mm HEPES, pH 7.9, 83 mm NaCl, 1.0 mm MgCl2, 0.5 mm phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 μg/ml pepstatin A, 5 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and 5 μg/ml leupeptin) and homogenized by 20 strokes in a glass-Teflon homogenizer. The homogenates were centrifuged at 1,000 × g for 10 min at 4 °C three times, and the supernatant was saved. Half of the combined supernatant was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 min to obtain the plasma membrane fraction. The other half of the combined supernatant was centrifuged at 165,000 × g for 90 min to obtain the total membrane. The pellet was suspended in homogenization buffer at 5 μl per oocyte. All fractions were stored at –80 °C until used.Western blot analysis was performed as described previously (27.Brockmann K. Wang D. Korenke C.G. von Moers A. Ho Y.Y. Pascual J.M. Kuang K. Yang H.

Briefly, 15 μl of the prepared total membrane or the purified plasma membrane samples from wild-type, mutant, and H2O-injected oocytes were subjected to 4–20% SDS-polyacrylamide gradient gel electrophoresis. Glut1 signals were quantified digitally using a densitometer equipped with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences). The densities of wild-type Glut1 signals in purified oocyte membranes were used to normalize mutant Glut1 densities.Osmotic water permeability (Pf) measurements were done as described previously (6.Fischbarg J. Kuang K.Y. Vera J.C. Arant S. Silverstein S.C. Loike J. Rosen O.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3244-3247Crossref PubMed Scopus (165) Google Scholar, 20.Iserovich P. Wang D. Ma L.

In brief, oocytes were placed in a glass bottom chamber at room temperature. The oocyte equatorial cross-section was viewed with a Nikon™ inverted microscope equipped with a 4× objective and a video camera (model NC-65, Dage-MTI, Michigan City, IN). A computer with frame grabber digitized the oocyte image and calculated the oocyte area and volume every 6 s. For an experiment, oocytes were superfused with isotonic Barth's solution (178 mosm) for a period of 60 s and then with hypotonic solution (15 mosm, obtained by omitting NaCl) for another 100 s. Pf values were calculated from the induced change in oocyte volume, i.e. Pf = (dV/dt)·(1/(A·Vw·ΔC)), where A is the area (assumed spherical) of the oocyte, dV/dt is the rate of volume change, ΔC is the osmolarity gradient (all three at zero time), and Vw is the water molar volume (31.Echevarria M.

Statistical analysis was done by performing t tests.RESULTSTo confirm the activity of the expressed wild-type Glut1 transporter, oocytes were injected with increasing amounts of GLUT1 cRNA to determine their transport function and plasma membrane expression. A plateau is evident above 15 ng of injected cRNA. In the following kinetics experiments, 50 ng of cRNA was injected into oocytes to obtain maximum Glut1 expression and minimize any effect resulting from the variations in the amount of injected cRNA. Zero-trans influx of 3-OMG (5 mm 3-OMG in the medium) into oocytes was also determined as a function of the incubation time and showed that influx was relatively linear for about 5 min. We used 2 min as the standard incubation time for all experiments.The studies of Hebert and Carruthers (32.Hebert D.N. Carruthers A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 4654-4658Crossref PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar) with purified erythrocyte glucose transporters (Glut1) suggest that this protein may exist as a dimer as well as a tetramer. To address this question, we co-injected T310I mutant and WT GLUT1. Fig. 1 shows 3-OMG zero-trans influx data (5 mm 3-OMG in the medium) into oocytes injected with 1.5 ng of WT and 1.5 ng of T310I cRNA or co-injected with mixtures of WT and T310I cRNA at ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:3. In a similar experiment, the uptake of [3H]deoxyglucose was determined (2 mm deoxyglucose in the medium) using oocytes injected with WT or T310I cRNA (either 1.5 or 3 ng of each) and co-injected with a mixture of WT and T310I cRNA at a ratio of 1:1 (1.5 ng of each) (Fig. 1). In both cases, we find that the transport activity of WT Glut1 was not significantly affected by the coinjection with mutant T310I GLUT1 cRNA. This is true even when the amount of mutant injected was three times that of WT GLUT1 (Fig. 1). In essence, we did not find the effect one might anticipate if oligomerization were a prerequisite for Glut1 functional activity.In the mutant T310I, the hydrophilic side chain of the Thr is replaced by a larger, hydrophobic side chain of Ile. We tried to resolve these mechanisms by producing two new mutants, T310A and T310S. Influx and efflux of 3-OMG under several conditions are shown in Figs. 2 and 3, and an influx of DHA under zero-trans condition is shown in Fig. 4. The kinetic parameters of 3-OMG uptake under zero-trans influx and equilibrium exchange influx conditions are shown in Table I. For all mutants, the Km values decreased ∼2-fold. Considering the residues at position 310, the Vmax values were in the order Thr > Ser > Ala > Ile. For both zero-trans and equilibrium exchange influx, the Km and Vmax values for the wild-type were significantly higher than those for the mutants (all p values <0.0001) (Table I).Fig. 2Zero-trans influx of 3-OMG and equilibrium exchange influx of 3-OMG. Oocytes were injected with 50 ng GLUT1 cRNA encoding WT, T310A, T310I or T310S constructs or 50 nl of water. Three days later, uptake of 14C-labeled 3-OMG together with unlabeled 3-OMG (0–50 mm) was determined in a group of five oocytes under zero-trans influx and equilibrium exchange influx conditions as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Uptake values from oocytes injected with water were subtracted from all groups.

The relative values of DHA uptake by the oocytes expressing wild-type Glut1 and mutants are Thr > Ser > Ala > Ile, similar to the order seen with glucose transport (Fig. 4) (DHA concentration ranges from 50 to 800 μM).To show that mutant Glut1 transporters are targeted to the plasma membrane, confocal microscopy of Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type, T310A, T310I, and T310S mutant Glut1 was performed (Fig. 5A). Western blot analysis of the total membrane and purified plasma membrane is shown in Fig. 5B. Also, the relative amounts of T310A, T310I, and T310S mutant Glut1 compared with the wild-type Glut1 immunoreactivity in plasma membrane and total membrane and the ratio of Glut1 in purified plasma membrane compared with total membrane are shown in Table II. The Vmax values of mutants (Table I) normalized by the relative amount of Glut1 in purified plasma membrane were then compared with that of wild-type Glut1 to estimate the relative transport activity (Table II).Fig. 5Glut1 expression in Xenopus oocytes.A, localization of mutant Glut1 in oocytes by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Oocytes were injected with wild-type or mutant GLUT1 cRNAs or 50 nl of water.

This figure represents one of the three independent Western blot analyses. Glut1 signals were quantified digitally using a densitometer equipped with ImageQuant software (Amersham Biosciences).

Here we report the presence of 6–7 d-alanine residues in an endopeptidase of Streptococcus pyogenes, a unique enzyme involved in surface protein attachment that we term LPXTGase. Using d-amino acid oxidase coupled with catalase for the deamination of d-alanine to pyruvic acid (a conversion unique to d-alanine), we were able to identify [14C]pyruvic acid in a [14C]alanine-labeled preparation of purified LPXTGase, which represents 27% of the amino acid composition. Because d-amino acids are not accommodated in ribosomal peptide synthesis, these results suggest that the same process used in assembling peptide antibiotics or a yet unidentified mechanism may synthesize the core protein of this endopeptidase. d-Amino acids are commonly found in peptide antibiotics and the cell wall peptidoglycan of bacterial cell walls but have not been identified in proteins or enzymes.

Because d-amino acids are not accommodated in ribosomal peptide synthesis, these results suggest that the same process used in assembling peptide antibiotics or a yet unidentified mechanism may synthesize the core protein of this endopeptidase. In our previous report we described the unusual properties of an endopeptidase termed LPXTGase purified from Streptococcus pyogenes (1Lee S.G. Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46912-46922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). This membrane-associated enzyme cleaves a common sequence motif, LPXTG, found near the C termini of precursor proteins programmed to be displayed on the cell surface and linked to the cell wall peptidoglycan. We discovered that the LPXTGase is highly glycosylated and contains hydrophobic amino acids with unusually high masses, which are not among the 20 common amino acids present in ribosomally translated proteins. The presence of unusual amino acids indicated the possibility that the core protein of the enzyme might be constructed entirely or in part through the well characterized nonribosomal peptide synthesis pathway, where amino acids are assembled into a peptide on amino acid-activating multienzyme templates. Examples are the syntheses of peptide antibiotics in Bacilli sp. (2Rieder H. Heinrich G. Breuker E. Simlot M.M. Pfaender P.

Lawen A. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: S219-S224PubMed Google Scholar). Unusual amino acids could also be incorporated into the ribosomally translated core protein through post-translational modifications, however. Another unusual feature of the core protein of LPXTGase is that only seven different amino acids represent 93% of the 61 common residues present in the core protein. It is particularly striking that alanine accounts for nearly 40% of the common amino acids found in the protein. Over-representation of one or two amino acids within a peptide is a characteristic feature of nonribosomally constructed peptide antibiotics (4Lee S.G. Lipmann F. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 585-602Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar, 5Takita T. Muroka Y. Kleinkauf H. von Dohren H. Biochemistry of Peptide Antibioltics: Recent Advance of Biotechnology of Beta-Lactams and Microbial Peptides. Walter de Gruyter, New York1990: 289-309Google Scholar). As there exists an intriguing possibility that the core protein is indeed constructed at least in part by a nonribosomal peptide synthesis pathway, we considered whether some of the alanine residues might be in the d-form, a hallmark feature of nonribosomal synthesis of peptide antibiotics (11Kleinkauf H. Dittmann J. Lawen A. Biomed. Biochim. Acta. 1991; 50: S219-S224PubMed Google Scholar, 12Aker H. Lee S.G. Lipmann F. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 5727-5731Google Scholar). This prompted us to search for the presence of d-alanine in the core protein of LPXTGase. In this report, we present strong evidence that alanine in the d-isoform is present in this bacterial enzyme. Growth and [14C]Alanine Labeling of Cells—S. pyogenes, strain D-471, was grown in 1 liter of Todd-Hewitt medium supplemented with 1% yeast extract. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000 rpm when the absorbance of the culture at 600 nm reached 0.6. The cell pellets were suspended in 1 liter of a synthetic culture medium, and after adding 100 μCi of [14C]alanine (Sigma, catalog no. A-7428) to the culture, cells were grown for 1 h at 37 °C in a shaker-incubator. Cells were harvested by centrifugation, and the spent medium was saved. A freshly harvested batch of late exponential cells from 1 liter of culture was suspended in the spent medium containing [14C]alanine, and the cells were grown for 1 h and then harvested by centrifugation. The combined cell pellets were suspended in 400 ml of 30 mm Mes 1The abbreviation used is: !

The composition (in mg/liter) of the synthetic medium is as follows: salts CaCl2·H2O (300), MgSO4 (200), KCl (2000), NaCl (12,000), NaH2PO4 (120), Na2HPO4 (140), and FeSO4 (1); amino acids glutamine (2000), tryptophan (150), and all other amino acids (400) (alanine was omitted); sugars glucose (4000), ribose (200), and deoxyribose (200); bases adenine (20), guanine (20), cytosine (20), thymine (20), and uracil (20); vitamins biotin (0.05), folic acid (1), riboflavin (1), niacin (1), pantothenic acid (1), p-aminobenzoic acid (1), lipoic acid (0.1), and thiamine (1). Tryptophan and bases were dissolved in 20 ml of 0.2 n HCl prior to mixing with other components. The final pH of the medium was adjusted to 7.4. 4-morpholineethanesulfonic acid. Purification of [14C]Alanine-labeled LPXTGase—About 3 g of the harvested cell pellets were suspended in 120 ml of 30 mm Mes buffer, pH 6.3. About 500 units of phage lysin from group C streptococcus (13Nelson D. Loomis L. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 99: 4017-4112Google Scholar) were added to the cell suspension, and the mixture was incubated with shaking at 37 °C for 90 min. The resulting cell lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 20 min, and the supernatant (cytosol) was saved. The pellets containing cell ghosts were suspended in 60 ml of 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.2% Brij 35, the suspension was sonicated for 40 s, and the sonicated suspension was stirred at 4 °C overnight. The suspension was centrifuged for 40 min at 10,000 rpm, and the supernatant (membrane extract) was collected. From the combined supernatants, [14C]alanine-labeled LPXTGase was purified according to the procedure described previously (14Meister A. Wellner D. Boyer P.D. Lardy H. Myrbaeck K. Enzymes. Vol. 7. Academic Press, New York1963: 609-648Google Scholar). Briefly, the combined supernatants were applied to a DEAE-cellulose column equilibrated with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 6.8, and the column was eluted with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35. Fall-through eluant was concentrated by ultrafiltration using a YM-3 membrane, and the concentrated fall-through fraction was applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (49 × 2.5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mm Tris buffer, pH 7.6, containing 0.1% Brij 35. The column was then eluted with the same buffer. The gel filtration step was repeated. Acid Hydrolysis of [14C]Alanine-labeled LPXTGase and Purification of [14C]Alanine—The 14C-labeled LPXTGase eluting from the second G-50 column was concentrated to 4 ml by ultrafiltration using a YM-3 membrane. The enzyme solution was lyophilized, and the dried enzyme was dissolved in 0.5 ml of water. Five volumes each of ethanol and ethyl acetate were added to the enzyme solution, and the mixture was kept overnight at –20 °C. Flocculated enzyme aggregates were collected by centrifugation. The solvents were removed from the enzyme pellets by means of Speedvac. The dried enzyme was dissolved in 300 μl of 80% phenol, after which the enzyme solution was mixed with 3 ml of 6 n HCl in capped glass vials. The enzyme was hydrolyzed by placing the vials in a 110 °C oven for 22 h. The acid hydrolysate of the enzyme was lyophilized to remove HCl and phenol. The dried enzyme hydrolysate was dissolved in 1 ml of 50% ethanol, and the hydrolysate was banded on a 20 × 20-cm silica gel plate. The plate was developed with a solvent mixture consisting of chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:1). An autoradiogram was made from the plate, and the 14C-labeled alanine band was located. The alanine band was scraped off of the plate, silica gel was placed in a small column, and the column was eluted with 50% ethanol. The eluted material was dried by means of Speedvac, and the 14C-labeled alanine was dissolved in 300 μl of distilled water. Detection of d-Alanine—In an initial experiment, 60 μl of an aliquot of 14C-labeled alanine sample (18,200 cpm) was introduced into a microcentrifuge tube, then 4 μl of 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, 0.2 unit of d-amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3, Sigma catalog no. A 5222) in 2 μl, and 0.2 unit of catalase (EC 1.11.1.6, Sigma catalog no. C 30) in 2 μl were added, and the reaction mixture was incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Authentic l-alanine with similar radioactivity was subjected to d-amino acid oxidase and catalase in an identical manner. At the end of the reaction, 300 μl of ethanol was added to the microcentrifuge tubes, and these were kept at –20 °C. The resulting precipitates consisting of enzymes and excess buffer salt were pelleted by centrifugation, and the supernatants containing radioactivity were concentrated to about 20 μl. The reaction products, along with untreated l-[14C]alanine and [14C]pyruvic acid (Amersham, CFA 85), were loaded on a silica gel plate, and the plate was developed with chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:1). Radioactive spots were detected by exposure of the plate to an x-ray film. To the remainder of the [14C]alanine sample (90,800 cpm) in a microcentrifuge tube, 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, was added to a final concentration of 50 mm after which 2 units each of d-amino acid oxidase and catalase were added to the tube. The reaction mixture was incubated for 6 h at room temperature, and radioactive reaction products were prepared and separated by silica gel TLC as above. Reaction products a and b shown in Fig. 3B were eluted from the plate with 70% ethanol. Products a, b, and authentic [14C]pyruvic acid were loaded on a TLC plate, and the plate was developed with ethyl acetate/propionic acid/water (2:1:1). Phenylhydrazone Derivatives of d-Amino Acid Oxidase-Catalase-treated d- and l-Alanine and Pyruvic Acid—10 μmol each of d- and l-alanine in 100 μl of distilled water were placed in microcentrifuge tubes after which 1 unit each of d-amino acid oxidase and catalase were added, and 1 m Tris buffer, pH 8.5, was added to a final concentration of 50 mm. The reaction was carried out at room temperature for 3 h. Enzymes and excess buffer were then precipitated from the reaction mixtures by adding 4 volumes of ethanol. After removing the precipitates by centrifugation, the supernatant containing the reaction products was placed in microcentrifuge tubes and was concentrated to 50 μl. 20 μmol of phenylhydrazine in 100 μl of 90% ethanol was added to the reaction products from d- and l-alanine and to 10 μmol of pyruvic acid in 50 μl of 50% ethanol, pH adjusted to 7 with 1 n NaOH, and the mixtures were placed in a 110 °C oven for 15 min. Aliquots (10 μl) of the resulting phenylhydrazone derivatives were loaded on a silica gel plate, and the chromatogram was developed with a solvent mixture consisting of ethyl acetate/isopropyl alcohol/water/concentrated ammonium hydroxide (60:30:10:1). Phenylhydrazone derivatives were detected by viewing the plate under UV light. 14C Labeling of Cytosol and Membrane Extracts—To specifically label the alanines in the LPXTGase, we grew streptococci in the presence of [14C]alanine. Of the initial [14C]alanine in the synthetic medium totaling 1.118 × 108 cpm, the cells incorporated 1.68 × 107 cpm, or 15%, of the radioactive alanine. The combined radioactive counts in the cytosol and membrane extract of these cells, which also contained free alanine, was 1.26 × 107 cpm. Purification of [14C]Alanine-labeled LPXTGase—Fig. 1 shows the elution pattern of enzyme activity from the second Sephadex G-50 column. The enzyme activity profile, as detected by cleavage of a bead-bound 125I-labeled LPXTG-containing peptide (13Nelson D. Loomis L. Fischetti V.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 2001; 99: 4017-4112Google Scholar), coincided precisely with the 14C activity profile. The total radioactive counts of the purified LPXTGase were 1.42 × 105 cpm. Consistent with our previous findings that the LPXTGase does not contain any aromatic amino acid and thus does not absorb UV light at 280 nm, the enzyme peak showed no UV absorption at 280 nm, verifying the purity of the enzyme. Purification of [14C]Alanine from Acid Hydrolysate of LPXTGase—Purified LPXTGase was hydrolyzed with 6 n HCl as described under “Experimental Procedures,” and the acid hydrolysate was subjected to silica gel thin layer chromatography using chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:1) as the running solvent. Fig. 2 shows that the 14C radioactivity was nearly exclusively present in alanine (1.14 × 105 cpm). A very faint radioactive band was seen at rf 0.75, which corresponded with glutamic acid. No other radioactive bands corresponding to the rest of the LPXTGase-constituent amino acids were detected. Mobilities of non-radioactive, LPXTGase-constituent amino acids on silica gel thin layer chromatography with the same solvent mixture were previously determined (results not shown). Presence of d-Alanine in the LPXTGase—Treatment of d-alanine with d-amino acid oxidase coupled with catalase results in the deamination of d-alanine to produce pyruvic acid, a reaction that does not occur when l-alanine is similarly treated. In Fig. 3A, d-amino acid oxidase-catalase-treated [14C]alanine from the enzyme was loaded onto spot 1, similarly treated authentic l-[14C]alanine onto spot 2, untreated l-[14C]alanine onto spot 3, and authentic [14C]pyruvic acid was loaded onto spot 4 at the origins of a silica gel thin layer plate, and the plate was developed with chloroform/methanol/water (1:2:1). As shown, d-amino acid oxidase-catalase treatment of the [14C]alanine sample produced two radioactive products, a and b, of which the mobility of product a is identical with that of pyruvic acid. Product b is consistent with the mobility of the dimeric form of pyruvic acid. The yield of these products was low as reflected in the quantity loaded on the plate. To verify the presence of the dimeric form of pyruvic acid, the remaining (80% of the total) [14C]alanine from the enzyme was incubated with an excess amount of d-amino acid oxidase and catalase for a prolonged time to ensure conversion of all d-alanine to pyruvic acid, and the reaction products were chromatographed on a silica gel plate in the same manner (Fig. 3B). The same products a and b were again detected but in higher yield. These two products were eluted from the plate and along with authentic pyruvic acid were applied to a silica gel plate, which was developed with ethyl acetate/propionic acid/water (2:1:1) (Fig. 3C). The main radioactive spots from both products a and b showed the same mobility as authentic pyruvic acid, but minor secondary radioactive spots were also observed. The fact that products a and b from Fig. 3B gave rise to nearly identical radioactive spots on subsequent chromatography using a different solvent (Fig. 3C) indicates that these two products are inter-convertible. The total radioactive counts in products a and b in Fig. 3B were 15,200 and 9,400 cpm, respectively, which combined represent 27% of the total radioactivity in the [14C]alanine sample. As there are 24 alanine residues in the LPXTGase, 6–7 alanine residues are in the d-isoform. These numbers are based on the assumption that all d-alanines present in the alanine sample were converted to pyruvic acid after d-amino acid oxidase and catalase treatment. Phenylhydrazone Derivatives of d-Amino Acid Oxidase-Catalase Treatment of d- and l-Alanine and Pyruvic Acid—We wished to verify that pyruvic acid is present in both monomeric and dimeric forms resulting in derivatives a and b. Track 1 of Fig. 4 shows phenylhydrazone derivatives of the reaction products arising from d-alanine after treatment with d-amino acid oxidase and catalase. Derivatives a and b are clearly present in this track. No phenylhydrazone derivative is seen when l-alanine treated with d-amino acid oxidase-catalase was reacted with phenylhydrazine (track 2). Track 3 shows phenylhydrazone derivatives arising from authentic pyruvic acid, which are identical to the migration pattern of derivatives a and b in track 1. Taken together, these results indicate that pyruvic acid exists both in monomer and dimer forms. d-Amino acid oxidase (EC 1.4.3.3) deaminates d-amino acid to the corresponding α-keto acids, but the enzyme is not reactive with l-amino acids (15Scoacovelli O. Dell'Atti A. Deglio A. Cassidei L. Z. Naturforsch. Sect. C Biosci. 1976; 31: 5-11Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). We show here that at least 27% of the alanine present in LPXTGase became deaminated by d-amino acid oxidase, verifying that LPXTGase does in fact contain d-amino acids. Based on radioactive count data, the estimated number of d-alanine residues in LPXTGase is 6–7. The possibility exists, however, that the actual number is higher because pyruvic acid decomposes at 165 °C, and the hot air stream used during loading of the d-amino acid oxidase reaction products on the TLC plates may have decomposed some pyruvic acid. All of the amino acids in proteins exhibit the same steric configuration; thus, they are all l-amino acids. d-Amino acids have not been identified in proteins, although they do exist in nature in peptides from multicellular organisms (16Jolles P. d-Amino Acids in Sequences of Secreted Peptides of Multicellular Organisms. Birkhauser Verlag, Boston, MA1998Crossref Google Scholar). In bacteria for instance, d-amino acids are commonly found in association with the amino acids used to construct the peptidoglycan. For example, in the disaccharide-pentapeptide precursor for peptidoglycan synthesis one d-glutamate and two d-alanines are present prior to cross-linking after which, the terminal d-alanine is removed to facilitate the linkage. However, beside the bacterial peptidoglycan, d-amino acids have generally been associated with non-ribosomal peptide synthesis, in the production of peptide antibiotics (2Rieder H. Heinrich G. Breuker E. Simlot M.M. Pfaender P. Methods Enzymol. 1975; 43: 548-559Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 3Paulus H.

Our finding of d-alanine in the LPXTGase enzyme still does not resolve whether the d-amino acid was incorporated through a non-ribosomal peptide synthesis pathway or was post-transcriptionally added to a ribosomally translated protein backbone. To date, the largest non-ribosomally synthesized peptide is <50 amino acids, and none have been found to exhibit catalytic activity. Because d-amino acids cannot be accommodated during ribosomal synthesis of a polypeptide chain, this strongly suggests that the 60-amino acid LPXTGase may be the first reported instance of a d-amino acid-containing enzyme that is not ribosomally synthesized. One could argue, however, that the LPXTGase used in this paper might be contaminated by l-alanine oxidase or racemase. This is unlikely because the LPXTGase used in the amino acid analysis was highly purified as described previously (1Lee S.G. Pancholi V. Fischetti V.A. J. Biol. Chem. 2002; 277: 46912-46922Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). However, even if the LPXTGase were contaminated by a small amount of impurities, it is unlikely that l-alanine oxidase or racemase is a part of the impurity. The l-alanine racemase from Escherichia coli (and other species) contains 359 amino acid residues and 40 acidic amino acid residues. Thus, l-alanine oxidase or racemase cannot appear in the fall-through fractions in DEAE-cellulose chromatography or the Mr = 14,000 region of the G 50 chromatography used in purifying the LPXTGase. Furthermore, if l-alanine oxidase or racemase co-purified with LPXTGase for inexplicable reasons, only free amino acids, and not amino acids contained in proteins, are substrates for these enzymes. Although the deaminated product of d-alanine is pyruvic acid, we did observe an additional product. The keto-enol tautomerism of α-keto acids is well known (17Pflegel P. Zeitz F.D. Wagner G. Pharmazie. 1977; 32: 92-94PubMed Google Scholar). For example, pyruvic acid as a keto acid is expected to undergo keto-enol tautomerism, of which the enol form is an α-hydroxy acid that, as a rule, undergoes dimerization and polymerization. [14C]pyruvic acid is generally shipped as a lyophilized powder in a sealed vial. When freshly dissolved in 50% ethanol and chromatographed, a single radioactive spot is usually observed (Fig. 3, A and B). However, after standing it may become oxidized, and additional spots will appear after chromatography (Fig. 3C). Thus, we interpret that the secondary product that we observed in our chromatograms arose from the dimerization of pyruvic acid. Whatever caused the appearance of the second spot from the d-amino acid oxidase-treated [14C]alanine from LPXTGase, an identical second spot also appeared from authentic [14C]pyruvic acid. Therefore, it seems safe to conclude that the second spot originated from pyruvic acid. Thus, in summary, we have identified the presence of at least six d-alanine residues in the LPXTGase enzyme, accounting for ∼10% of the total amino acids in this molecule. However, our results are inconclusive as to whether the d-alanine found in LPXTGase is the result of a post-translational modification of l-alanine to d-alanine or is incorporated non-ribosomally."
