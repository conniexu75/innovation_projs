https://openalex.org/W2019831571,"p21<sup>ras</sup> has been implicated in the hypertrophic response of cultured cardiac myocytes to defined growth stimuli. To determine if activation of <i>ras</i>-dependent intracellular signaling pathways is sufficient to induce <i>in vivo</i> hypertrophy, transgenic mice were created that express oncogenic <i>ras</i> in the cardiac ventricular chamber. Mice homozygous for the transgene displayed morphological, physiological, and genetic markers of marked cardiac muscle hypertrophy. Miniaturized catheterization technology documented a selective prolongation of cardiac relaxation, similar to that seen in early human hypertrophic heart disease. An increase in left atrial mass, in the absence of transgene expression in that chamber, further supported physiologically abnormal left ventricular diastolic function. Histological analysis revealed myofibrillar disarray, indistinguishable from that in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in man. These studies establish a <i>ras</i>-dependent pathway for hypertrophic heart disease and document the feasibility of mapping <i>in vivo</i> signaling pathways for cardiac hypertrophy and dysfunction by applying <i>in vivo</i> microphysiological assays to genetically manipulated mice. <i>ras</i>-dependent pathways may also be a rational target for developing new approaches to inhibit the genesis of hypertrophy in certain pathological settings."
https://openalex.org/W1993486440,"We have studied the mechanism of interaction between soluble von Willebrand factor (vWF), labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC), and platelets exposed to shear in a cone-and-plate viscometer. A flow cytometer calibrated with fluorescent bead standards was used to calculate the number of molecules associated with each platelet in suspension. To validate the methods and reagents used, binding of the same labeled vWF was assessed in the presence of ristocetin or α-thrombin and found to be saturable, with a narrow and symmetric distribution on >90% of the platelets. As expected, essentially all bound ligand interacted exclusively with platelet membrane glycoprotein (GP) Ibα in the presence of ristocetin and with GP IIb-IIIa after stimulation with α-thrombin. In contrast, only a minor proportion (<20%) of the platelets exposed to shear were found to bind vWF, with no evidence for saturation and markedly decreased interaction when the platelet count was below 100,000 μl. Moreover, shear-induced vWF binding was blocked equally effectively by selected monoclonal antibodies against either GP Ibα or GP IIb-IIIa or against the respective binding sites in vWF. Thus, both receptors are involved in the process, possibly through initial transient interactions mediated by GP Ibα that lead to platelet activation and subsequent irreversible binding supported by GP IIb-IIIa. While the levels of shear stress theoretically applied to platelets in these experiments are above those thought to occur in the normal circulation, our findings demonstrate a unique vWF binding mechanism that is not mimicked by other known modulators and correlates with platelet aggregation. Similar processes may occur in response to lower shear stress when platelets are exposed to thrombogenic surfaces and agonists generated at sites of vascular injury during thrombus formation.

https://openalex.org/W1978048485,"Sphingosine is a product of sphingolipid metabolism that has been linked to a protein kinase C-independent mitogenic response. In previously published data, utilizing an in vitro model system for platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced vascular smooth muscle proliferation, we have demonstrated that sphingosine is increased at the expense of a concomitant decrease in ceramide formation, implicating an altered ceramidase activity. To explore mechanisms of growth factor-stimulated sphingosine formation, we have developed and investigated a cell-free model system assessing ceramidase activity. We now report that an alkaline, membrane-associated, ceramidase activity in the rat glomerular mesangial cell, a smooth muscle-like pericyte, is up-regulated by growth factors, apparently via a tyrosine kinase phosphorylation mechanism. PDGF also stimulated sphingomyelinase activity which generates sufficient substrate to drive the subsequent ceramidase reaction. Inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin-1, and tumor necrosis factor-α, stimulated sphingomyelinase but not ceramidase activity, a result consistent with the cellular accumulation of the ceramide, apoptidic, differentiating second messenger. Mitogenic vasoconstrictor peptides such as endothelin-1 stimulated neither sphingomyelinase nor ceramidase activities. An inhibitor of ceramidase activity, N-oleoylethanolamine, reduced PDGF- but not endothelin-1-stimulated proliferation. Thus, we conclude that, in mesangial cells, growth factors but not vasoconstrictor peptides or cytokines induce mitogenesis, in part, through ceramidase-mediated sphingosine formation.

Sphingolipids are complex ubiquitous lipids that have been relegated to serving a structural role in membranes. Sphingolipids are characterized as consisting of a long chain amino dialcohol base (sphingoid), an amide-linked fatty acyl group, and a polar or glycosidic head group. Over the last few years, sphingolipid derivatives have been identified as endogenous membrane signal-transducing molecules. Sphingomyelin, the major membrane sphingolipid, can be hydrolyzed by sphingomyelinase to form ceramide, a second messenger which stimulates differentiation, inhibits proliferation, and has been associated with apoptosis(1Jarvis W.O.

Chem. 1994; . 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Ceramides are themselves substrates for ceramidases that form the promitogenic lipid, sphingosine(8Zhang H. Buckley N.E. Gibson K. Spiegel S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 76-81Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Our laboratory and the laboratory of Spiegel have recently reported that platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) stimulates mitogenic, sphingolipid-derived, second messengers including sphingosine and sphingosine-1-phosphate by degrading ceramide(9Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that growth factors, but not inflammatory cytokines, activate alkaline ceramidase, a membrane-associated enzyme that has only been partially characterized (11Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). A synthetic analog of sphingosine, N-oleoylethanolamine, has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of ceramidase in vitro(11Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). Utilizing this inhibitor, we investigate the contribution of ceramidase activation to growth factor-induced proliferation in MC. MC are a useful model to explore proliferative responses and phenotypic changes in a contractile, smooth muscle-like cell. Ligands for both tyrosine kinase-linked receptors (PDGF) and G protein-linked receptors (ET-1) are potent mitogens for MC(12Mene P. Simonson M.S. Dunn M.J. Physiol. Rev. 1989; 69: 1347-1424Crossref PubMed Scopus (461) Google Scholar). However, it is not completely understood how the biochemical events initiated by either PDGF- or ET-1-binding results, within hours, in DNA replication and cell division. Cytokines, including IL-1α, are, at best, poor co-mitogens for smooth muscle cell types(13Sedor J.R. Nakazato Y. Konieczkowski M. Kidney Int. 1992; . 41: 595-599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). In fact, IL-1α induces a phenotypic change in MC, switching these cells from a contractile, promitogenic state to a secretory, nonproliferating phenotype(13Sedor J.R. Nakazato Y. Konieczkowski M. Kidney Int. 1992; . 41: 595-599Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). Thus, PDGF- or ET-1-treated MC can be used as in vitro models for a myogenic, mitogenic, phenotypic state while IL-1α-treated MC can serve as an in vitro model for an inflammatory, secretory phenotypic state. In the present study, we correlate sphingomyelinase-activated ceramide formation and ceramidase-stimulated sphingosine generation with growth factor-, vasoconstrictor peptide-, and cytokine-induced cellular proliferation and differentiation. tumor necrosis factor-α interleukin-1α platelet-derived growth factor endothelin-1 3-[cyclohexylamino]-2-hydroxy-1-propanesulfonic acid 3-[3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate mesangial cell(s) N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)glycine dimethyl sulfoxide. Growth factors and cytokines were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (Lake Placid, NY) and ET-1 was purchased from Peptide Institute (Tokyo, Japan). Genistein and all required cell culture media were obtained from Life Technologies, Inc. [3H]Thymidine was obtained from DuPont NEN. All other reagents were obtained from Sigma. Membrane, cytosolic, and total cellular protein content from MC was determined by the method of Lowry (Kester(14Kester M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 153: 244-255Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar)). As previously reported, primary rat MC strains were cultured from isolated glomerular explants partially digested with bacterial collagenase to form glomerular cores(14Kester M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1993; 153: 244-255Crossref Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Cell passages 3-10 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 17% fetal bovine serum, 100 μg/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 5 μg/ml each of insulin and transferrin, and 5 ng/ml sodium selenite at 37°C in 5% CO2 and 95% air. For the present experiments, MC at 90% confluence were rendered quiescent (G0) by holding them for 2 days in supplemented serum- and insulin-free RPMI. The method of Sugita et al.(11Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), as modified by us, was used to assess membrane-associated ceramidase activity. MC, pretreated with 1 mM sodium vanadate for 1 h to inhibit phosphatase activity, were stimulated with selected agonist for 1 h (37°C, pH 7.4). The cells were then placed on ice, washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline, and scraped in a buffer containing either 0.1 M CAPSO (pH 9.0), 0.1 M citric acid/phosphate buffer (pH 4.5), or 0.1 M Bicine (pH 7.4). These buffers were supplemented with 1 mM CaCl2, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM benzamidine, and 20 μg/ml freshly added protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin, aprotinin, as well as 1 mM sodium vanadate. The cells were sonicated three times for 15-s bursts. The lysates were then centrifuged at 480 × g for 5 min to remove whole cells and nuclei and then ultracentrifuged at 70,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C to pellet the membrane fraction. The membrane pellet was resuspended in the appropriate ceramidase buffer supplemented with 1% Triton X-100 and 1% CHAPS. After resuspension in the above buffer, the membrane fraction was continuously shaken at 37°C for 1 h with 0.2 μCi of 14C-labeled N-oleoyl-D-sphingosine (2.0 × 103 cpm/nmol). Ten μl of this ceramidase substrate were prepared for solubilization in an additional 1 μl of Tween 20, 2.5 μl of Triton X-100, 170 μl of chloroform, and 85 μl of methanol. The ceramide mixture was vortexed, dryed under nitrogen, and then reconstituted in 275 μl of double-distilled water containing 4 mg of sodium cholate. After sonication, 25-μl aliquots of the ceramide substrate were added to 200 μl of MC membrane preparation, and the reaction was initiated. To terminate the reaction, 10 μl of 5 mg/ml oleic acid were added, and the reaction vials were placed on ice. One ml of chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) was added, and then 1 ml of Dole's solution (78% isopropyl alcohol, 20% heptane, 2% H2SO4) was added to the reaction mixture. After 10 min, 400 μl of heptane and 600 μl of water were added. The top layer, containing the hydrolyzed [14C]oleic acid, was extracted and evaporated under N2. The labeled oleic acid, resuspended in 100 μl of heptane, was applied to Silica Gel 60 TLC plates and developed in a mobile phase consisting of 94% chloroform, 5% acetic acid, and 1% methanol. Unlabeled oleic acid was used as internal and external standards. The oleic acid spot, visualized with 2-(p-toluidino)naphthalene-6-sulfonic acid spray, was scraped into a scintillation vial for liquid scintillation analysis. The assay is linear with respect to time (0-2 h) and concentration of substrate (0.1-2 mg of protein). 2E. Coroneos, M. Martinez, S. McKenna, and M. Kester, unpublished data. In addition, in previously reported data(11Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar), the Km for ceramide for the acidic ceramidase assay utilizing human kidney was 3.6 × 10-4M, and we used a substrate concentration of oleoylsphingosine consistent with this value. Our acidic ceramidase data for vehicle-treated MC correspond to previously reported values from these autopsied human kidneys (3.5 nmol/mg of protein/h(11Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar)). Also, potential inhibitors of ceramidase were investigated and only N-oleoylethanolamine (Ki, 7 × 10-4M) was found to be a potent inhibitor(11Sugita M. Williams M. Dulaney J.T. Moser H.W. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 398: 125-131Crossref PubMed Scopus (158) Google Scholar). In contrast, oleic acid, sphingosine, and ceramide glucoside all were far less effective inhibitors with Ki > 10-3M). MC sphingomyelinase activity (pH 7.4) was assessed by the method of Rao and Spence(15Rao B.G. Spence M.W. J. Lipid Res. 1976; 17: 506-515Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), as modified by us, utilizing [14C]sphingomyelin labeled in the polar head group. In contrast to the ceramidase assay, these MC preparations were not pretreated with vanadate. After stimulation with agonists for 1 h at 37°C, MC were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline and then scraped into a buffer consisting of 50 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, and freshly prepared protease inhibitors leupeptin, pepstatin, and aprotinin (20 μg/ml). After 1 h on ice, the suspension was centrifuged at 480 × g for 5 min and the supernatant lysate was removed and continuously shaken with 0.1 μCi of [14C]sphingomyelin (1.7 × 105 cpm/nmol) at 37°C for 1 h. The reaction was stopped by the addition of heptane/isopropyl alcohol/H2O (2.5:2.5:2, v/v/v). The top phase was aspirated, and the bottom aqueous phase containing the hydrolyzed [14C]phosphorylcholine was concentrated utilizing a Speed-Vac concentrator. The samples were applied to Silica Gel 60W TLC plates (0.25 mm). External and internal standards included phosphorylcholine, C18:1 ceramide, and sphingosine. The elution system consisted of methanol, 0.5% NaCl, ammonia (100:100:2, v/v/v), and the phosphorylcholine spots were visualized with acid molybdate spray. A 0.01 dilution of 30% H2O2 solution was used to bleach the silica gel before liquid scintillation analysis. As described previously in MC (16Kester M. Simonson M.S. Mene P. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar) and in A7r5 VSM(9Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), DNA synthesis was assessed in PDGF-BB-, ET-1, or sphingosine-treated cultures containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with 0.5% bovine serum albumin for 24 h. Sphingosine was added in RPMI 1640 media containing 5% Me2SO and 0.5% bovine serum albumin for the full 24 h. During the last 6 h, [3H]thymidine (0.5 μCi/ml) was added for pulse-labeling newly synthesized DNA. Cells were placed on ice and washed four times with ice-cold 5% trichloroacetic acid, which fixed the cells to the culture plate. Cells were then solubilized in 1 ml of 0.1 N NaOH from which acid-insoluble counts were quantified by liquid scintillation counting. In contrast to our previous studies(9Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 16Kester M. Simonson M.S. Mene P. Sedor J.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 718-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar), mitogenesis was now assessed in the absence of any added fetal bovine serum or insulin. Levels of significance were determined by independent t tests (parametric) or by the Mann-Whitney U test (nonparametric). When applicable, the p values of the individual comparisons were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni method. We and others have previously demonstrated that PDGF stimulates [3H]sphingosine at the expense of [3H]ceramide and that inhibition of sphingolipid metabolism correlates with a reduction in PDGF-induced mitogenesis(9Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). We have previously verified in MC and in A7r5 smooth muscle cells that treatment with either 10 ng/ml PDGF-AB or PDGF-BB for 1 h induces maximal elevations in [3H]sphingosine formation(9Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To better understand the mechanism of growth factor-stimulated sphingosine formation, we have developed a cell-free ceramidase assay for MC. Ceramidase activity was assessed as TLC-separated [14C]oleate released from PDGF-treated or untreated membrane preparations and exogenous [14C]oleoylceramide substrate. In control experiments (data not shown), PDGF did not significantly stimulate ceramidase activity in heat (100°C)-activated or calcium-free membrane preparations. Also, stimulated ceramidase activity was observed only when PDGF was added to intact cells and not when PDGF was incubated with the membrane preparation, suggesting that the PDGF responses require an intact receptor-linked signaling cascade. MC were treated with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml, 1 h) or vehicle in the presence or absence of the tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor, vanadate (250 μM, 15 min preincubation) at pH 7.4, and then cell-free ceramidase activity was assessed at three distinct pH values (Fig. 1). PDGF-BB (and in data not shown, PDGF-AB) stimulates ceramidase activity at alkaline but not at acidic or neutral pH values, a finding consistent with activation of a plasma membrane-associated and not an endosomal/lysosomal ceramidase. PDGF-BB activation of alkaline ceramidase was maximal at 1 h and persisted for up to 6 h (data not shown). The mitogenic vasoconstrictor peptide, ET-1 (10-7M, 1 h), did not induce an elevation in membrane-associated ceramidase activity in the absence or presence of vanadate. PDGF-stimulated membrane ceramidase activity was, however, further augmented in the presence of vanadate, suggesting that maximal activity is associated with a tyrosine phosphorylation mechanism. PDGF-stimulated ceramidase activity was observed at a neutral pH value in the presence but not the absence of vanadate, suggesting that, under optimal assay conditions, growth factors can stimulate ceramidase activity at physiological pH values. A definitive role for tyrosine phosphorylation regulation of sphingosine formation was further suggested as PDGF-stimulated ceramidase activity was inhibited in the presence of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor, genistein (25 μM, 1-h preincubation). Genistein significantly inhibited PDGF-BB- but not vehicle-treated MC ceramidase activity (Fig. 2). These experiments were run in the presence of vanadate to ensure maximal phosphorylation and/or activity of ceramidase. Also, these MC data were confirmed in A7r5 vascular smooth muscle cells (data not shown) as to demonstrate that PDGF-stimulated ceramidase activity is not unique to a smooth muscle-like pericyte. We next assessed the relative specificity for ceramidase activation by growth factors (Fig. 3). Even though PDGF-BB was the most potent growth factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, insulin-like growth factor, and epidermal growth factor (all 10 ng/ml, 1 h) still significantly stimulated ceramidase activity. In contrast, the inflammatory cytokines, IL-1α and TNF-α, did not stimulate ceramidase activity even in the presence of vanadate. Thus, growth factors, but not cytokines or mitogenic vasoconstrictor proteins, stimulate ceramidase activity in vitro. To assess if sufficient substrate could be generated in vivo for optimal ceramidase activity, we measured MC sphingomyelinase activity, in a cell-free system, as an indicator of ceramide formation (Fig. 4). PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml, 1 h) stimulates sphingomyelinase activity which generates sufficient substrate for subsequent ceramidase activity. Confirming reports by other investigators(5Okazaki T. Bell R.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 19076-19080Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 7Jayadev S. Linardic C.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; . 269: 5757-5763Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), IL-1α and TNF-α (both at 10 ng/ml) were potent activators of sphingomyelinase activity in MC. However, these cytokine-receptor-induced signals were incapable of stimulating ceramidase activity. Thus, these data are consistent with cytokines as inducers of ceramides and a resulting differentiated, nonproliferative, cellular phenotype. ET-1 (10-7M) neither stimulated sphingomyelinase nor ceramidase activities, suggesting that the mitogenic actions of this vasoconstrictor are not mediated by sphingolipid metabolites. To further ascertain the role of sphingolipid metabolites, especially sphingosine, in mediating growth factor-induced proliferation, we have utilized an inhibitor of ceramidase, N-oleoylethanolamine (0.5 mM, 16 h dissolved in 5% Me2SO, 95% buffer containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin), in [3H]thymidine incorporation studies. N-Oleoylethanolamine significantly inhibited PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml)- but not ET-1 (10-7M)-stimulated mitogenesis in MC (Fig. 5). N-Oleoylethanolamine had no effect by itself on proliferation. Exogenous sphingosine (10 μM) partially restored the mitogenic response to PDGF but not ET-1. These data imply that the mitogenic actions of PDGF, but not ET-1, were mediated through sphingosine or a sphingosine derivative. Moreover, in data not shown, IL-1α or TNF-α are not mitogens for MC under these assay conditions, supporting our observations that cytokines do not stimulate ceramidase activity. We conclude that, in mesenchymal cells, growth factors stimulate ceramidase activity resulting in the formation of the mitogenic lipid, sphingosine. We have extended our earlier studies that implicate sphingosine as a component of PDGF-induced mitogenesis in mesenchymal cells(9Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We now report that growth factors, but not mitogenic vasoconstrictor peptides or inflammatory cytokines, stimulate ceramidase activity in vitro. Both an increase in sphingosine and a decrease in ceramide content is consistent with a mitogenic phenotype. This is the first report to dissociate a role for distinct sphingolipid metabolites in a proliferative versus a differentiated phenotype. By making parallel evaluations of ceramidase and sphingomyelinase activities in vitro, we have demonstrated that even though both PDGF and cytokines induce sphingomyelinase activation, only growth factor-receptors have the capacity to also augment ceramidase activity. These studies offer a novel explanation for the differentiating, antiproliferative, actions of cytokines and the promitogenic actions of growth factors. Consistent with our observations are studies that implicate ceramide in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (2Jayadev S. Liu B. Bielawska A.E. Lee J.Y. Nazaire F. Pushkareva M.Y. Obeid L.M. Hannun Y.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2047-2052Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (469) Google Scholar) and sphingosine metabolites in cellular proliferation(9Jacobs L.S. Kester M. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 265: C740-C747Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 10Olivera A. Spiegel S. Nature. 1993; 365: 557-560Crossref PubMed Scopus (817) Google Scholar). The role of sphingosine to mediate, in part, the mitogenic actions of growth factors but not of a mitogenic vasoconstrictor peptide is a particularly exciting finding. At the minimum, these observations suggest that the actions of N-oleoylethanolamine are specific to a sphingolipid-mediated signaling pathway. At the maximum, these studies suggest that mitogenic actions of sphingosine are distinct from proliferative signals induced by G protein-linked receptors. Yet, surprisingly, to date, all of the putative mechanisms postulated for the mitogenic actions of sphingosine can be induced by G protein-linked receptors. For example, sphingosine as well as ET-1 have been shown to induce elevations in intracellular free calcium concentrations(17Ghosh T.K. Bian J. Gill D.L.

Thus, sphingosine may regulate cellular proliferation through, as yet, unknown signaling mechanisms. In this regard, phospholipid-derived signaling pathways including phospholipase C, protein kinase C, or c-fos are not required for PDGF-induced proliferation(23Fukami K. Takenawa T. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 10988-10993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 24Sharma R.V. Bhalla R.C. Am. J. Physiol. 1993; 264: C71-C79Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). As PDGF-induced mitogenesis is, in part, sphingosine-dependent, it is surprising that sphingosine formation mediated by growth factor-regulated sphingolipid metabolism has not been investigated in pathophysiologies that manifest a proliferative smooth muscle phenotype. To date, sphingolipid metabolism and resulting proliferation and/or hypertrophy has only been investigated in the streptozotocin-treated rat model of diabetic nephropathy(25Shayman J.A. Deshmukh G.D. Zador J. Kunkel R. Johnson K. Radin N.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 766AGoogle Scholar). In this model, a glucosyl ceramide synthetase inhibitor has been used to demonstrate that an elevation in glucosyl ceramides with a concomitant reduction in ceramides is associated with renal growth(25Shayman J.A. Deshmukh G.D. Zador J. Kunkel R. Johnson K. Radin N.S. J. Am. Soc. Nephrol. 1992; 3: 766AGoogle Scholar). Thus, a decrease in ceramide content, either by an increase in ceramidase, sphingomyelin synthase, or glucosyl ceramide synthetase activities, correlates with a proliferative response. Even though alkaline ceramidase has not been isolated or cloned, a genetic disorder of acidic ceramidase (Farber's lipogranulomatosis) has been identified and linked to accumulation of ceramide and resulting lethal neuronal abnormalities(26Prensky A.L. Ferreira G. Carr S. Moser H.W. Proc. Soc Exp. Biol. Med. 1967; 126: 725-728Crossref Scopus (29) Google Scholar). In conclusion, we suggest that growth factors, but not inflammatory cytokines or mitogenic vasoconstrictor peptides, mediate proliferation, in part, through ceramidase-regulated sphingosine formation. The dissociation of growth factor-induced mitogenesis from cytokine-mediated differentiation and apoptosis as a consequence of distinct sphingolipid-derived second messengers implicates the sphingomyelin cycle as an important homeostatic regulator of cellular division and differentiation.

INTRODUCTIONVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 1The abbreviations used are: VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)HUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cell(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionBAECbovine aortic endothelial cell(s). is a potent and specific endothelial cell mitogen(1Connolly D.T.

Ferrara N. Science. 1989; 246: 1306-1309Google Scholar). Through interactions with its receptors KDR/flk-1 and flt1, VEGF has critical roles in the growth and maintenance of vascular endothelial cells and in the development of new blood vessels in physiologic and pathologic states(3Aiello L.P. Avery R.L. Arrigg P.G. Keyt B.A. Jampel H.D. Shah S.T. Pasquale L.R. Thieme H. Iwamoto M.A. Park J.E. Nguyen H.V. Aiello L.M. Ferrara N. King G.L. N. Engl. J.

Invest. 1993; 91: 153-159Google Scholar). The patterns of embryonic expression of VEGF suggest that it is crucial for differentiation of endothelial cells from hemangioblasts and for development of blood vessels at all stages of growth(6Jakeman L.B. Armanini M. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 848-859Google Scholar, 7Breier G. Albrecht U. Sterrer S. Risau W. Development. 1992; 114: 521-532Google Scholar). Among many potentially angiogenic factors, VEGF is the only one whose pattern of expression, secretion, and activity suggests a specific angiogenic function in normal development(8Klagsbrun M. Soker S. Curr. Biol. 1993; 3: 699-702Google Scholar).High affinity receptors for VEGF are found only on endothelial cells, and VEGF binding has been demonstrated on macro- and microvascular endothelial cells and in quiescent and proliferating endothelial cells, suggesting that these receptors are important for both growth and maintenance of all endothelial cells(6Jakeman L.B. Armanini M. Phillips H.S. Ferrara N. Endocrinology. 1993; 133: 848-859Google Scholar, 9Jakeman L.B. Winer J. Bennett G.L. Altar A. Ferrara N. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 89: 244-253Google Scholar). The tyrosine kinases KDR/flk-1 and flt1 have been identified as candidate VEGF receptors by affinity cross-linking and competition binding assays(10de Vries C. Escobedo J.A. Ueno H. Houck K. Ferrara N. Williams L.T. Science. 1992; 255: 989-991Google Scholar, 11Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P.H. Risau W. Ullrich A.

These two receptor tyrosine kinases contain seven similar extracellular immunoglobulin domains and a conserved intracellular tyrosine kinase domain interrupted by a kinase insert(10de Vries C.

In situ hybridization in the developing mouse has demonstrated that KDR/flk-1 is expressed in endothelial cells at all stages of development, as well as in the blood islands in which endothelial cell precursors first appear(11Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Google Scholar), and that KDR/flk-1 specifies endothelial cell precursors at their earliest stages of development(17Yamaguchi T.P. Dumont D.J. Conion R.A. Breitman M.L. Rossant J. Development. 1993; 118: 489-498Google Scholar).The vascular endothelium is critical for physiologic responses including thrombosis and thrombolysis, lymphocyte and macrophage homing, modulation of the immune response, and regulation of vascular tone. The endothelium is also intimately involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis(18Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Google Scholar). Although a number of genes expressed in the endothelium have been characterized(19Collins T. Williams A. Johnston G.I. Kim J. Eddy R. Shows T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Bevilacqua M.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 2466-2473Google Scholar, 20Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Google Scholar, 21Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. Cell.

Chem. 1990; 265: 10446-10450Google Scholar), expression of these genes is either not limited to vascular endothelium (e.g. the genes encoding von Willebrand factor, endothelin-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1) or is restricted to specific subpopulations of endothelial cells (e.g. the gene for endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecule-1). (A fragment of the promoter for Tek/Tie2, another developmentally regulated endothelial cell receptor tyrosine kinase, has recently been shown to direct transgene expression in subpopulations of endothelial cells during mouse embryonic development but not in endothelial cells of adult mice(23Schlaeger T.M. Qin Y. Fujiwara Y. Magram J. Sato T.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1089-1098Google Scholar). This suggests that the Tek/Tie2 promoter fragment used in this study is sufficient to direct gene expression to subpopulations of endothelial cells during specific periods of development, although functional elements within this promoter have not yet been identified.) In contrast with cells derived from the skeletal muscle and hematopoietic lineages, little is known about the mechanisms of specification and differentiation of endothelial cells. To understand the molecular mechanisms regulating cell type specificity and activation of the differentiation pathway in endothelial cells, we studied the control of KDR/flk-1 transcription.As a first step we cloned and characterized the promoter for the human KDR/flk-1 gene. We report here the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the gene and identify a single transcription start site located 303 bp 5′ of the initiation methionine codon. Four kilobases of KDR/flk-1 5′-flanking sequence were found to have promoter activity similar to that of the potent SV40 promoter/enhancer in reporter gene transfection experiments in endothelial cells. Deletion analysis in endothelial cells showed the presence of positive regulatory elements in regions from bp −225 to −164, −95 to −77, −77 to −60, and +105 to +127. We found that KDR/flk-1 mRNA was expressed specifically in endothelial cells in culture and that 4 kb of the KDR/flk-1 5′-flanking sequence had cell type-specific promoter activity in transient transfection assays.DISCUSSIONAs a receptor for VEGF, KDR/flk-1 plays an essential role in angiogenesis and endothelial cell growth, and it is among the earliest markers of endothelial cell differentiation during development. Moreover, in situ analysis and immunocytochemistry have shown that KDR/flk-1 expression is restricted to endothelial cells in vivo; presumably this restricted pattern of expression determines the pattern of VEGF activity. Despite the importance of the KDR/flk-1 gene in endothelial cell growth, the mechanisms that regulate and restrict its expression are not known. We report for the first time the cloning and characterization of the human and mouse KDR/flk-1 promoters, and we identify regions containing positive regulatory elements within the 5′-flanking region of the human gene.Analysis of the human KDR/flk-1 5′-flanking region reveals that the transcription start site is located 303 bp 5′ of the methionine initiation codon. Like constitutive endothelial nitric oxide synthase (40Marsden P.A. Heng H.H.Q. Scherer S.W. Stewart R.J. Hall A.V. Shi X.-M. Tsui L.-C. Schappert K.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 17478-17488Google Scholar), another gene expressed in endothelial cells, KDR/flk-1 lacks a TATA box, is rich in G and C residues, and has numerous putative binding sites for Sp1, a ubiquitous nuclear protein that can initiate transcription of TATA-less genes(41Pugh B. Tjian R. Cell. 1990; 61: 1187-1197Google Scholar). We identified by deletion analysis three sequences within the 5′-flanking region of the KDR/flk-1 gene which appear to contain elements important for its expression in endothelial cells. Deletion of sequences between bp −225 and −164 reduced activity to 63% that of the full-length promoter, deletion between −95 and −77 further reduced promoter activity to 20%, and deletion from −77 to −60 reduced promoter activity to less than 5%. Because potential binding sites for Sp1, AP-2, NFκB, and E-box proteins located within these three positive regulatory elements in the human KDR/flk-1 gene are also present in the mouse 5′-flanking sequence, they may represent functional binding domains. AP-2 is a developmentally regulated trans-acting factor (42Mitchell P. Timmons P. Hebert J. Rigby P. Tjian R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 105-119Google Scholar) without a demonstrated role in endothelial cell gene regulation. NFκB, however, trans-activates the inducible expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 and tissue factor in endothelial cells (20Iademarco M.F. McQuillan J.J. Rosen G.D. Dean D.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 16323-16329Google Scholar, 43Moll T. Czyz M. Holzmuller H. Hofer-Warbinek R. Wagner E. Winkler H. Bach F. Hofer E. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 3849-3857Google Scholar) and is known to be a mediator of tissue-specific gene regulation(33Lenardo M. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 227-229Google Scholar). Nuclear proteins that bind the E-box motif include the basic helix-loop-helix family of trans-acting factors. E-box-binding proteins have not been clearly associated with endothelial cell gene expression, although members of this family are critical for proper maturation of many cell types, including skeletal muscle and B lymphocytes(36Buskin J.N. Hauschka S.D. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 2627-2640Google Scholar, 44Murre C. McCaw P. Vaessin H. Caudy M. Jan L. Jan Y. Cabrera C. Buskin J. Hauschka S. Lassar A. Weintraub H. Baltimore D. Cell. 1989; 58: 537-544Google Scholar). Further experiments will be necessary to determine if these or other unidentified nuclear proteins specifically trans-activate the KDR/flk-1 gene.Four zinc finger-containing transcription factors in the GATA protein family bind to the consensus sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) and regulate cell type-specific gene expression in many cell lineages(45Orkin S. Blood. 1992; 80: 575-581Google Scholar); among these GATA-2 has been most closely linked to endothelial cell gene expression. GATA-2 functions as an enhancer of endothelin-1 gene expression (39Lee M.E. Temizer D.H. Clifford J.A. Quertermous T. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 16188-16192Google Scholar) and acts to restrict expression of von Willebrand factor to endothelial cells(21Jahroudi N. Lynch D.C. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 999-1008Google Scholar). We observed that the human KDR/flk-1 5′-flanking region has two potential GATA-binding sequences, at positions −759 and +107, and that loss of the element located at −759 had no effect on expression of KDR/flk-1 in endothelial cells. The potential GATA element at position +107 is in a region of the first exon which we have identified as a powerful positive regulatory element. Although this GATA sequence (GGATAT) differs from the GATA-binding sequences of endothelin-1 and von Willebrand factor and from the consensus GATA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G), we speculated that it might be the functional motif in the region between +105 and +127 because the functional GATA site in the von Willebrand factor gene is located similarly in the first exon and because a similar GATA element is found in the first exon of the mouse KDR/flk-1 gene. To our surprise, mutation of 3 bp in this element (GATA to GTCG), which had been observed to prevent trans-activation of the GATA cis-acting element in the endothelin-1 promoter,2 had no significant effect on KDR/flk-1 promoter activity (Fig. 5). Thus, our deletion analysis and mutagenesis studies do not support a functional role for the two GATA sequences in the human promoter in its high level activity in endothelial cells. These observations are consistent with the finding that early stages of endothelial cell development are normal in mice deficient in GATA-2 (46Tsai F. Keller G. Kuo F. Weiss M. Chen J. Rosenblatt M. Alt F. Orkin S. Nature. 1994; 371: 221-226Google Scholar) and suggest that other transcription factors are necessary for expression of the human KDR/flk-1 gene.We demonstrate in this study that expression of KDR/flk-1 is restricted to endothelial cells in culture, as it is in vivo. Moreover, we show that the activity of the KDR/flk-1 promoter in endothelial cells is similar to that of the potent SV40 promoter/enhancer and that this high level activity is specific to endothelial cells: activity in other cell types is markedly diminished. We do not yet understand why we observed low but detectable promoter activity in transient transfection assays of cell types that do not express the KDR/flk-1 gene in vivo; however, this situation is not unique among cell type-specific genes(47Goldhamer D. Faerman A. Shani M. Emerson C. Science. 1992; 256: 538-542Google Scholar). It is possible that other silencer elements outside of the 15.5-kb 5′-flanking region are necessary to block promoter activity completely in nonendothelial cells. Alternatively, the context of the promoter in relation to normal chromatin structure may be essential for precise regulation of the gene. An example of this type of regulation can be found in the control of MyoD expression. MyoD, like KDR/flk-1, is developmentally regulated, and it marks skeletal muscle precursors at an early stage(48Sassoon D. Lyons G. Wright W. Lin V. Lassar A. Weintraub H. Buckingham M. Nature. 1989; 341: 303-307Google Scholar). The MyoD 5′-flanking region contains an enhancer element that increases MyoD expression in many cell types in culture, even though MyoD expression is specific to skeletal muscle in vivo(47Goldhamer D. Faerman A. Shani M. Emerson C. Science. 1992; 256: 538-542Google Scholar). In contrast, transgenic constructs containing the MyoD enhancer are skeletal muscle-specific, implying that chromatin structure modifies the activity of this enhancer and regulates cell type specificity. Our results suggest that tissue-specific regulation of KDR/flk-1 involves a complex interaction between known, widely distributed nuclear factors and other, unknown elements. Therefore a complete explanation of the mechanisms of endothelial cell-specific expression of KDR/flk-1 may require integration of in vivo and in vitro observations.Identification of the regulatory mechanisms responsible for KDR/flk-1 expression is likely to provide important information about the specification and differentiation of endothelial cells early in embryogenesis. Moreover, knowledge about DNA elements that restrict gene expression to endothelial cells may be useful for deciphering the function of proteins in this cell type and, potentially, for directing or preventing expression of genes specifically in endothelial cells INTRODUCTIONVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) 1The abbreviations used are: VEGFvascular endothelial growth factorbpbase pair(s)kbkilobase(s)HUVEChuman umbilical vein endothelial cell(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionBAECbovine aortic endothelial cell(s). is a potent and specific endothelial cell mitogen(1Connolly D.T.

In situ hybridization in the developing mouse has demonstrated that KDR/flk-1 is expressed in endothelial cells at all stages of development, as well as in the blood islands in which endothelial cell precursors first appear(11Millauer B. Wizigmann-Voos S. Schnurch H. Martinez R. Moller N.P.H. Risau W. Ullrich A. Cell. 1993; 72: 835-846Google Scholar), and that KDR/flk-1 specifies endothelial cell precursors at their earliest stages of development(17Yamaguchi T.P. Dumont D.J. Conion R.A. Breitman M.L.

The endothelium is also intimately involved in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases such as atherosclerosis(18Ross R. Nature. 1993; 362: 801-809Google Scholar). Although a number of genes expressed in the endothelium have been characterized(19Collins T. Williams A. Johnston G.I. Kim J. Eddy R. Shows T. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Bevilacqua M.P. J. Biol.

(A fragment of the promoter for Tek/Tie2, another developmentally regulated endothelial cell receptor tyrosine kinase, has recently been shown to direct transgene expression in subpopulations of endothelial cells during mouse embryonic development but not in endothelial cells of adult mice(23Schlaeger T.M. Qin Y. Fujiwara Y. Magram J. Sato T.N. Development. 1995; 121: 1089-1098Google Scholar). This suggests that the Tek/Tie2 promoter fragment used in this study is sufficient to direct gene expression to subpopulations of endothelial cells during specific periods of development, although functional elements within this promoter have not yet been identified.) In contrast with cells derived from the skeletal muscle and hematopoietic lineages, little is known about the mechanisms of specification and differentiation of endothelial cells. To understand the molecular mechanisms regulating cell type specificity and activation of the differentiation pathway in endothelial cells, we studied the control of KDR/flk-1 transcription.As a first step we cloned and characterized the promoter for the human KDR/flk-1 gene. We report here the sequence of the 5′-flanking region of the gene and identify a single transcription start site located 303 bp 5′ of the initiation methionine codon. Four kilobases of KDR/flk-1 5′-flanking sequence were found to have promoter activity similar to that of the potent SV40 promoter/enhancer in reporter gene transfection experiments in endothelial cells. Deletion analysis in endothelial cells showed the presence of positive regulatory elements in regions from bp −225 to −164, −95 to −77, −77 to −60, and +105 to +127. We found that KDR/flk-1 mRNA was expressed specifically in endothelial cells in culture and that 4 kb of the KDR/flk-1 5′-flanking sequence had cell type-specific promoter activity in transient transfection assays."

The molecular and cellular bases of PKC-regulated β-APP cleavage are poorly understood. Here we demonstrate in a reconstituted cell-free system that activation of endogenous PKC increases formation from the trans-Golgi network of secretory vesicles containing β-APP and that this effect can be mimicked by purified PKC.

Signal transduction via protein phosphorylation governs the relative utilization of competing pathways for the metabolism of the β-amyloid precursor protein (β-APP) (Kang et al., 1987), the type 1 integral glycoprotein from which Aβ is derived by proteolytic processing. Activated protein kinase C (PKC) stimulates nonamyloidogenic β-APP cleavage (Buxbaum et al., 1990; Caporaso et al., 1992), generating soluble β-APP (sβ-APP) at the expense of other pathways, including that involved in the formation of Aβ (Hung et al., 1993). PKC-regulated β-APP cleavage does not require changes in the phosphorylation state of the β-APP cytoplasmic tail (da Cruz e Silva et al., 1993), suggesting that one or more molecules of the β-APP trafficking and processing apparatus are PKC substrate phosphoproteins involved in the mechanism by which PKC regulates β-APP cleavage. Alzheimer disease β-amyloid peptide β-amyloid precursor protein protein kinase C soluble β-APP trans-Golgi network phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate guanosine 5′-3-O-(thio)triphosphate. Most β-APP resides intracellularly, codistributing with TGN38, a marker of the trans-Golgi network (TGN) (Caporaso et al., 1994). Thus, it seemed possible that PKC might exert its actions on regulated β-APP cleavage by redistributing β-APP out of its usual residence in the TGN and toward post-TGN compartments where it can undergo processing. This possibility is supported by studies demonstrating stimulation by phorbol esters of the release of glycosaminoglycans, intraluminal molecules of the constitutive secretory pathway (De Matteis et al., 1993; Ohashi and Huttner, 1994). Therefore, we have tested the possibility that an important component of regulated β-APP cleavage is PKC-stimulated formation from TGN of constitutive secretory vesicles containing and transporting mature β-APP. Three plates of PC12 cells (10-cm dishes, 5 × 107 cells/dish) were labeled with 2 mCi/ml [35S]sulfate (Amersham Corp.) for 10 min and chased at 37°C in the presence or absence of 1 μM PDBu (LC Services, Woburn, MA) for 5, 15, or 45 min. At the end of the incubation, media were collected and immunoprecipitated with β-APP amino-terminal antibody 22C11 (Caporaso et al., 1992). Cells were homogenized, and Golgi-rich membrane fractions were prepared by flotation using a stepwise sucrose gradient (Xu and Shields, 1993). The Golgi-rich fractions were immunoprecipitated with β-APP carboxyl-terminal antibody 369 (Buxbaum et al., 1990). Immunoprecipitates were resuspended in 1% SDS and adjusted to equal amounts of total protein (Bradford), followed by 4-12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis and autoradiography on Kodak X-OmatTM AR5 film. Confluent PC12 cells (5 × 107) were pulse-labeled with 2 mCi/ml [35S]sulfate (Amersham Corp.) for 5 min in sulfate-free medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) at 37°C. Cells from each 10-cm dish were homogenized using a stainless steel ball bearing homogenizer (18-μm clearance) in 5 volumes of homogenization buffer (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM magnesium acetate, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.2 mM CaCl2, and proteinase inhibitors) (Xu and Shields, 1993). A postnuclear supernatant was prepared (Tooze and Huttner, 1992) and centrifuged (Beckman TLA-45 rotor) at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellet was then washed and resuspended in 300 μl of homogenization buffer. Aliquots (100 μl of membrane preparation) of resulting suspension, the “TGN-rich fraction,” were incubated in a final volume of 250 μl at 37°C for 30 min in the presence of an energy-regenerating system containing 1 mM ATP and 0.2 mM GTP in the absence or presence of 1 mg of cytosol protein/ml (Xu and Shields, 1993). At the end of the incubation period, samples were centrifuged (Beckman TLA-45 rotor) at 14,000 × g for 10 min at 4°C. The pellets and supernatants were separated and immunoprecipitated with antibody 369 and subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and autoradiography. 2The possible production of sβ-APP was sought in experiments in which β-APP amino-terminal antibody 22C11 was substituted for carboxyl-terminal antibody 369. However, no sβ-APP was detected under standard conditions. The redistribution of 35S-sulfated β-APP into the supernatant provides a measure of budding of vesicles containing β-APP. Treatment of the vesicle-containing supernatant with proteinase K (25 μg/ml, Boehringer Mannheim) resulted in disappearance of the β-APP-like 22C11 (ectodomain)-immunoreactive material in the presence, but not in the absence, of 1% Triton X-100, consistent with the predicted existence of the β-APP ectodomain within a vesicular lumen (data not shown). Quantification and pairwise analyses were carried out using a Bio-Rad phosphor imaging system (Molecular AnalystTM version 2.0 software). For each experiment, the level of budding observed in the presence of an aliquot of a standard preparation of cytosol was taken as 1 arbitrary unit of budding efficiency, and other levels within a given experiment were normalized to this value. In some experiments, modulation of vesicle budding was tested using (together and separately) purified rat brain PKC (Woodgett and Hunter, 1987) and/or PKC inhibitor peptide-(19-36) (House and Kemp, 1987). PKC inhibitor peptide-(19-36), used at 200 μM as recommended (House and Kemp, 1987), was synthesized at the Keck Foundation Protein Synthesis and Sequencing Facility at Yale University, New Haven, CT. Effects on vesicle budding were also tested for GTPγS (30 μM) (Boehringer Mannheim) or (AlF4)- (80 μM Al3+ plus 6 mM F-). In some experiments, TGN-rich fractions derived from [35S]sulfate-labeled cells were washed with low (control) or high salt and analyzed for vesicle budding in the absence or presence of PDBu (1 μM)/purified PKC (25 μg/ml) or cytosol (1 mg/ml). For washing of membrane preparations, the [35S]sulfate-labeled TGN-rich fractions were adjusted to 100 or 400 mM potassium acetate and incubated at 4°C for 10 min followed by 10 min of centrifugation (Beckman TLA-45 rotor) at 14,000 × g at 4°C. The pellets were then washed in homogenization buffer, resuspended in buffer of the same composition, and used in the cell-free vesicle budding assay. In intact cells, PDBu caused a depletion of Golgi-associated mature, sulfated β-APP (Fig. 1). Sulfated β-APP holoprotein content of the Golgi-rich fraction (Xu and Shields, 1993) from metabolically labeled cells chased in the presence of PDBu for 5 or 15 min was approximately 30 and 40%, respectively, of that observed in the absence of PDBu (Fig. 1, leftpanel). Concomitantly, appearance of sβ-APP in the medium was enhanced severalfold at all times studied (Fig. 1, rightpanel). Regulation by protein phosphorylation of the biogenesis of β-APP-containing vesicles was directly demonstrated using a modification of an in vitro assay of secretory vesicle formation from a TGN-rich fraction (Ohashi and Huttner, 1994). This assay allows study of the effects of cell-impermeant agents such as PKC and GTPγS. Since it is well established that several cytosolic molecules play important roles in vesicle budding (for review, see Rothman(1994)), budding from isolated TGN was tested in the absence and presence of cytosol. Cytosol stimulated the formation of nascent vesicles containing β-APP (Fig. 2, autoradiogram, lane1versuslane 6; Fig. 3A, lane1versuslane 2). This stimulatory effect was mimicked by purified PKC (Woodgett and Hunter, 1987), with a half-maximal effect at 9 μg/ml and a maximal effect at 25 μg/ml (Fig. 2, graph; Fig. 3A, lane1versuslane 6). In the presence of cytosol, the addition of PDBu increased vesicle budding, presumably due to activation of endogenous PKC (Fig. 3A, lane2versuslane5). The rate of vesicle budding observed in the presence of cytosol alone or of cytosol plus PDBu/PKC was greatly reduced in the presence of PKC inhibitor peptide-(19-36) (House and Kemp, 1987) (Fig. 3A, lane2versuslane 3, lane 7versuslane 8). Cytosol caused a significant increase in vesicle budding from the TGN even in the presence of an optimally effective amount of PDBu/PKC (Fig. 3A, lane6versuslane7), suggesting the presence of a cytosolic factor(s) in addition to PKC. A similar additional stimulatory effect of cytosol was observed when cytosol was added to stripped Golgi membranes (see below) in the presence of optimally effective PDBu/PKC (not shown). The effect of cytosol alone was abolished in the absence of an energy-regenerating system or when incubation was carried out at 20°C, a temperature that blocks TGN exit (Fig. 3B).Figure 3:Regulation of vesicle budding from TGN.

Numerous reports have implicated GTP binding proteins (both the small Ras-like class and the heterotrimeric class) in many processes of intracellular vesicular transport including formation of secretory vesicles from the TGN. (AlF4)-, an activator of both stimulatory and inhibitory trimeric G proteins, diminished the budding of secretory vesicles containing β-APP, indicating the involvement of heterotrimeric G proteins. Consistent with this interpretation, GTPγS, a non-hydrolyzable GTP analogue, also reduced budding (Fig. 3B). In order to investigate whether the PKC substrate that regulated budding was likely to be cytosolic or TGN-associated, the [35S]sulfate-labeled, TGN-rich fraction was washed with 100 mM (control) or 400 mM (high salt) potassium acetate. Control and high salt-washed TGN were then assayed for vesicle formation in the absence or presence of purified PKC or cytosol (Fig. 4). The ability of PKC to stimulate vesicle budding in the absence of cytosol was largely retained after stripping of the TGN with high salt. The results suggest that at least one important PKC target is likely to be a tightly associated cytosolic or integral TGN phosphoprotein, presumably acting downstream from various known components of the budding apparatus (Rothman, 1994). The present results demonstrate that when appropriate PKC-mediated signal transduction systems are activated, β-APP is redistributed from the TGN to other cellular locations where it can encounter its processing enzymes, e.g. to the plasma membrane, where it is cleaved by “α-secretase,” another candidate PKC target (Bosenberg et al., 1993; Arribas and Massague, 1995). The data also support the idea that the so-called “constitutive” secretory pathway is subjected to important regulatory influences and that some of this regulation occurs via protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation (De Matteis et al., 1993; Ohashi and Huttner, 1994). Our results indicate that PKC constitutes an important component of the contribution of cytosol to the regulation of budding. Moreover, the evidence suggests that at least one important PKC substrate is tightly associated with the TGN."

Eychène A. Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Calothy G. Barnier J.V. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1647-1651PubMed Google Scholar). Therefore, B-Raf seems to be homologous to Raf-1 in many aspects of the intracellular signaling pathway. However, the c-Rmil/B-raf gene is expressed in a restricted number of tissues as compared with the ubiquitous c-raf/c-mil gene. Thus, high levels of B-raf/Rmil mRNA were detected in neural tissues, testes, and fetal membranes by Northern blot analysis(13Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 345-351PubMed Google Scholar, 14Marx M. Eychène A. Laugier D. Béchade C. Crisanti P. Dezélée P. Pessac B. Calothy G.

The number and size of B-raf transcripts, ranging between 2.6 and 12 kilobases, depend on the tissue analyzed(13Storm S.M. Cleveland J.L. Rapp U.R.

EMBO J. 1988; 7: 3369-3373Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar), but the identity, structure, and number of B-Raf proteins have not been unequivocally established. We reported the first identification of the Rmil/B-raf gene product in avian neuroretina cells, as a 93.5-kDa protein, which differs from the other Raf proteins by the presence of additional 100 N-terminal amino acids encoded by two exons(27Eychène A.

Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). These two exons are also present in the human B-raf gene(29Eychène A. Barnier J.V. Apiou F. Dutrillaux B. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1657-1660PubMed Google Scholar). A B-raf carboxyl-terminal specific antiserum revealed the presence of two proteins of 75 and 77 kDa in mouse testis and brain lysates(30Sithanandam G. Kolch W. Duh F.M. Rapp U.R. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 1775-1780PubMed Google Scholar). An unidentified protein of 95 kDa was also recognized in mouse brain extracts by an antibody directed against the catalytic domain of v-raf(31Mihaly A. Endrész V. Oravecz T. Rapp U.R. Kuhnt W. Brain Res. 1993; 627: 225-238Crossref PubMed Scopus (8) Google Scholar). Moreover, in the rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cell line, B-Raf proteins were identified either as a single 95-kDa band by tryptic mapping (17Stephens R.M. Sithanandam G. Copeland T.D. Kaplan D.R. Rapp U.R. Morrison D.K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1992; 12: 3733-3742Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar) or as two proteins of 67 and 95 kDa(16Oshima M. Sithanandam G. Rapp U.R. Guroff G. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 23753-23760Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), depending on the cell clones used. Recently, several proteins with apparent molecular weights ranging from 65,000 to 70,000 and 95,000 to 105,000 were detected in mouse brain extracts with a polyclonal antibody specific to the 12 C-terminal amino acids of B-Raf(23Moodie S.A. Paris M.J. Kolch W. Wolfman A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 7153-7162Crossref PubMed Scopus (68) Google Scholar). We previously reported the presence in some avian c-Rmil cDNAs of an alternatively spliced exon of 120 bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)PCRpolymerase chain reactionRT-PCRreverse transcriptase-PCRGMP-PNPguanyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate. (exon 10) located upstream of the kinase domain (27Eychène A. Barnier J.V. Dezélée P. Marx M. Laugier D. Calogeraki I. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1315-1323PubMed Google Scholar) between exons 9 and 11 according to the genomic organization of the coding region of the chicken c-Rmil/B-raf gene(28Calogeraki I. Barnier J.V. Eychène A. Felder M.P. Calothy G. Marx M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar). However, the presence of a similar and of other alternatively spliced exons in mammals remained to be investigated. Therefore, we undertook a detailed analysis of the molecular diversity of mammalian B-Raf proteins and of their tissue distribution in order to gain new insights into the specific implications of this gene in signal transduction. base pair(s) polymerase chain reaction reverse transcriptase-PCR guanyl-5′-yl imidodiphosphate. We describe here the molecular cloning and sequencing of several mouse B-raf cDNAs differing by the presence of two alternatively spliced exons. We show that the mouse B-raf gene not only contains the 120-bp alternatively spliced exon 10 previously described in avian DNA but also another alternatively spliced exon of 36 bp, located between exons 8 and 9 (exon 8b). The expression pattern of the various B-raf transcripts in adult mouse tissues was analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). We also identified at least 10 B-Raf protein isoforms in these tissues by using specific antisera directed against different portions of B-Raf. These isoforms differed by the presence of the alternatively spliced exons 8b and 10, by their NH2 extremities, and possibly by the presence of other unidentified sequences. Each isoform exhibits a specific pattern of expression in the adult mouse tissues analyzed, those containing amino acids encoded by exon 10 being specifically found in the central nervous system. B-raf cDNA clones were amplified from an adult mouse brain library constructed in the λ Zap vector by PCR using a mouse exon 17-specific antisense oligonucleotide, O4 (5′-GTAAGTCGACGACAGTTACTCCGTACCTTAC), and a T3 promoter-specific oligonucleotide. A second amplification was done using an exon 14-specific antisense oligonucleotide, O2 (5′-CATAGTCGACGGTCTCAATGATGTGGAGATGG), and a Bluescript SK primer. PCR products were purified, digested with BamHI and SalI enzymes, and subcloned into the BamHI-SalI sites of the Bluescript vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). 300 ng of poly(A)+ RNAs from adult mouse brain or 1 μg of mRNA from adult mouse tissues were reverse transcribed by priming with random hexamers using avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase (Amersham Corp.). Locations of B-raf-specific primers are indicated in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 4. Amplifications were done with the following primers, the location of which is indicated in the figures: O5 (5′-GAGTCGACCAATTCCACAGCCTTCC), O7 (5′-GAGTCGACGAAAAATTCCCAGAAGTGG), O6 (5′-GAGTCGACCCTTTGATCCTGTAATTCCAC), and O8 (5′-CTGTCGACCTCCATCACCACGAAACC). Southern blots of PCR products, separated on a 2% agarose gel, were done using standard procedures (32Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and hybridized with 5′-end-labeled oligonucleotides, specific to the exon 8 sequence (O527; 5′-CGACCAGCAGATGAAGATC) or with O7. The B-raf gene was analyzed by PCR using 100 ng of genomic DNA from NIH3T3 cells as a template in a standard reaction, with the same couple of oligonucleotides O5/O6 and O7/O8. PCR products were cloned in the pUC18 vector and partially sequenced using vector-specific primers.Figure 2:Identification of the mammalian B-raf alternatively spliced exon 10.

The structure of the B-raf transcripts and location of primers used for PCR are illustrated on the firstline (A). One μg of total RNA from 14 tissues was reverse-transcribed using random hexanucleotide primers, and of the first strand cDNA was amplified with specific primers indicated on lineA. The amount of RNA and quality of the first strand were verified using specific primers of the mouse β-actin gene (data not shown). Adult mouse tissues are as follows: total brain (lane2), cerebral hemispheres (lane3), midbrain (lane4), cerebellum (lane5), cervical spinal cord (lane6), dorsal spinal cord (lane7), eye (lane8), kidney (lane9), ovary (lane10), testis (lane11), spleen (lane12), thymus (lane13), liver (lane14), muscle (lane15), heart (lane16), lung (lane17).

Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Crossref PubMed Scopus (62909) Google Scholar). RT-PCR analysis of mouse and human exon 10 were done as for the 36-bp exon 8b, except that the following oligonucleotides were used: O9 (5′-GAGACCAGGGGTTTCGTG), O10 (5′-CATCCGACTTCTGTCCTCC), O16 (5′-CATTCGATTCCTGTCTTCTG), O17 (5′-CCAGGCTCAAAATCAAACAC), O23 (5′-CCCCCTTGAACCAACTGATG), and O24 (5′-GACTTGATTAGAGACCAAGG). RT-PCR analysis of tissue-specific expression of the different B-raf transcripts was performed using standard procedures, as described under “Results,” using the oligonucleotides described above and O1 (5′-CACATTGGATCCGAGATTCAAGTGATGACTGGG). Control of the quality of first strand synthesis was done using β-actin-specific primers (Stratagene) as described by the manufacturer. Plasmids encoding B-Raf proteins were generated by exchanging the sequence of the c-Rmil quail cDNA cloned into the following plasmids: pSVL/c-Rmil A, pSVL/c-Rmil B(27Eychène A. Barnier J.V. Dezélée P. Marx M. Laugier D. Calogeraki I. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1315-1323PubMed Google Scholar), or pSVL/c-Rmil A K483M (kinase-defective mutant)(25Papin C. Eychène A. Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Calothy G. Barnier J.V. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1647-1651PubMed Google Scholar), with the homologous mouse fragments containing the alternatively spliced exon 8 and/or exon 10, between the SauI site of exon 7 and the SalI site of exon 12. Expression plasmids, sequenced between these two sites, encode the following B-Raf isoforms: the avian B1 isoform, pSVL/c-Rmil A; pCP1, a chimeric B2 isoform containing exon 8b; the avian B3 isoform containing exon 10, designated pSVL/c-Rmil B; pCP5, a chimeric B3 isoform; two plasmids encoding proteins in which lysine 483 was substituted to methionine, generating kinase-defective mutants: pSVL/c-Rmil A K483M and pCP2, encoding a B1 and a B2 kinase-defective mutant, respectively(25Papin C. Eychène A. Brunet A. Pagès G. Pouysségur J. Calothy G. Barnier J.V. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1647-1651PubMed Google Scholar). The coding sequence of quail c-Rmil exons 1 and 2 was subcloned in frame with the sequences of pLC24 bacterial expression vector (34Remaut E. Stanssens P. Fiers W. Gene (Amst.). 1981; 15: 81-93Crossref PubMed Scopus (464) Google Scholar) by PCR amplification using primers specific to the sequence encoding the first amino acids of the Rmil protein (5′-GAGGATC-CGATGGCGGCGCTGAGC) and of the last 22 bases of exon 2 (5′-CCAAGCTTACTCTA-GATATATTGACGGTGG). Amplified DNA was generated using pSVL/c-Rmil A as template(27Eychène A. Barnier J.V. Dezélée P. Marx M. Laugier D. Calogeraki I. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1315-1323PubMed Google Scholar). We also cloned the 120 bp of the alternatively spliced exon 10 by the same procedure using primers containing the 15 first bases of exon 10 (5′-TGGGATCCGGCCCCTTTGAACCAG) and the last 19 nucleotides of exon 10 (5′-CCAAGCTTATCTGAACACTGGGCCAGG). The template was the pSVL/c-Rmil B plasmid, which contains the avian sequence of exon 10(27Eychène A. Barnier J.V. Dezélée P. Marx M. Laugier D. Calogeraki I. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1315-1323PubMed Google Scholar). Recombinant plasmids were transferred into Escherichia coli SG4044, after sequencing of the amplified inserts, and production of fusion proteins was induced by a 42°C temperature shift. Bacterial fusion proteins were purified as described (35Ghysdael J. Gégonne A. Pognonec P. Dernis D. Leprince D. Stéhelin D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 1714-1718Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar) and prepared for immunization of rabbits(36Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1988Google Scholar). A rabbit polyclonal antiserum was also raised against the exon 8b-encoded synthetic peptide CEKFLPEVELQDQR conjugated to thyroglobulin (Sigma) through the amino-terminal cysteine residue using maleimidobenzoyl-N-hydroxysylfosuccinimide ester (Pierce) as a coupling reagent. Transfection of COS-1 cells was done as described previously (37Boulukos K.E. Pognonec P. Begue A. Galibert A.F. Gesquiere J.C. Stéhelin D. Ghysdael J. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 697-705Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar) with 10 μg of plasmids and analyzed 48 h later. Transfected cells were washed twice with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline and lysed in 1.8 ml of cold lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaF, 10 mM Na4P2O7, 5 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mM 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonylfluoride (Pefabloc SC, Interchim), pH 7.5, and then clarified by centrifugation (13,000 × g, 15 min). Adult mouse tissues from 3 weeks to 2-month-old animals were dissected, homogenized in lysis buffer, and clarified by ultracentrifugation (100,000 × g, 30 min). B-Raf proteins were immunoprecipitated from lysates of COS-1 cells or adult mouse tissues, using 5 μl of each B-Raf-specific antibody or 5 μl of rabbit preimmune serum and 50 μl of Pansorbin (Calbiochem) as a 10% suspension in lysis buffer, and incubated for 2 h in ice. Bacterial pellets were washed four times in lysis buffer, and immunoprecipitated proteins were eluted by boiling for 3 min in 40 μl of Laemmli sample buffer, migrated on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride blotting membranes (Immobilon-P, Millipore Corp.). Membranes were rinsed, saturated with blocking solution(20Eychène A. Dusanter-Fourt I. Barnier J.V. Papin C. Charon M. Gisselbrecht S. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 1159-1165PubMed Google Scholar), and incubated with B-Raf antisera diluted 1:1000 to 1:4000 in blocking solution overnight at 4°C. Immunostaining was performed with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG, using the ECLTM Western blotting reagents (Amersham Corp.), according to the manufacturer's instructions. A partial sequence of the mouse B-raf gene was reported by Miki et al. (38Miki T. Fleming T.P. Crescenzi M. Molloy C.J. Blam S.B. Reynolds S.H. Aaronson S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5167-5171Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar), who isolated its catalytic domain by using a cDNA expression cloning system. To identify the B-raf gene products, we first cloned B-raf cDNAs using PCR-aided amplification of an adult mouse brain cDNA library. PCR-amplified products were subcloned and analyzed by restriction mapping and sequencing. We found that some clones differed by the presence of an additional sequence of 36 bp (Fig. 1A). These 36 nucleotides, which are in frame with the remaining B-raf coding sequence, are located between exons 8 and 9, according to the genomic organization of the avian c-Rmil gene (28Calogeraki I. Barnier J.V. Eychène A. Felder M.P. Calothy G. Marx M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1A). We searched for the presence of this sequence in adult mouse brain B-raf RNAs using RT-PCR, as described under “Experimental Procedures.” We amplified two fragments of 157 and 193 bp with oligonucleotides O5 and O8 specific to exons 8 and 9, respectively (Fig. 1B). Both fragments hybridized with an oligonucleotide specific to exon 8 (data not shown), but only the largest one hybridized with the oligonucleotide O7 specific to the 36-bp insertion. Amplifications with specific primers (O5/O6 and O7/O8) confirmed these results (Fig. 1B). These observations established the existence of B-raf transcripts containing this 36-bp additional sequence. Since this inserted sequence occurred at the junction between exons 8 and 9, we analyzed the genomic organization of the mouse B-raf gene in this region by PCR. NIH3T3 DNA was amplified with either pair of oligonucleotides O5 and O6, or O7 and O8 (Fig. 1C). Sequencing of amplified DNA fragments showed that this insertion of 36 bp is flanked by 2.9 and 0.3 kilobase pairs of intronic sequences at its 5′- and 3′-ends, respectively. These flanking sequences are in good agreement with the consensus for donor and acceptor splicing sites (39Breathnach R. Chambon P. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1981; 50: 349-383Crossref PubMed Scopus (3284) Google Scholar) (Fig. 1C). Taken together, these results show that the 36-bp insertion found in mouse B-raf cDNA corresponds to a previously unidentified alternatively spliced exon of the B-raf gene. We previously described an alternatively spliced exon of 120 bp in the avian c-Rmil gene, located between exons 9 and 11(27Eychène A. Barnier J.V. Dezélée P. Marx M. Laugier D. Calogeraki I. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1315-1323PubMed Google Scholar). We investigated the expression of this exon in adult mouse brain mRNAs, by RT-PCR. Using two oligonucleotides located in the exons 9 (O9) and 11 (O10), we amplified two fragments of 170 and 290 bp (data not shown). The presence of the 120-bp exon was confirmed by sequencing the 290-bp DNA fragment. Using specific oligonucleotides of this exon 10 sequence (O23/O17), we amplified fragments of the expected size, confirming the presence of this exon in some mouse B-raf mRNAs (Fig. 2B). We also searched for the presence of exon 10 in total human B-raf RNA purified from a child brain biopsy. Using oligonucleotides O24/O17 and O23/016, we amplified two fragments of 167 and 174 bp, respectively, in agreement with the presence of an insertion of 120 bp in human brain RNAs (Fig. 2C). When aligned for comparison, the nucleotide sequences of chicken, quail, mouse, and human exons 10 of the c-Rmil/B-raf genes (27Eychène A. Barnier J.V. Dezélée P. Marx M. Laugier D. Calogeraki I. Calothy G. Oncogene. 1992; 7: 1315-1323PubMed Google Scholar, 28Calogeraki I. Barnier J.V. Eychène A. Felder M.P. Calothy G. Marx M. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1993; 193: 1324-1331Crossref PubMed Scopus (9) Google Scholar) appeared almost identical (Fig. 2D). The avian sequence differed from the human and mouse sequences by one and three nucleotides, respectively. However, these changes do not modify the deduced amino acid sequence encoded by exon 10, which is, therefore, strictly conserved in the avian and mammalian species (Fig. 2E).

The structural basis for the function of the tyrosine triplet has been provided by recent x-ray crystallographic studies of IRTK that showed tyrosine 1150 to be autoinhibitory in its unphosphorylated state(5Hubbard S.R.

Sharma R.P. Sale G.J. Biochem. J. 1991; 275: 413-418Google Scholar). It is, therefore, tempting to speculate that this tyrosine triplet functions as a control switch of IRTK activity. Indeed, the IRTK appears to be tightly regulated by PTP-mediated dephosphorylation in vivo(9Khan M.N. Baquiran G. Brule C. Burgess J. Foster B. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 12931-12940Google Scholar, 10Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11215-11221Google Scholar, 11Rothenberg P.L. Lane W.S. Karasik A. Backer J. White M. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 8302-8311Google Scholar). The intimate coupling of PTPs to the insulin signaling pathway is further evidenced by the finding that insulin differentially regulates PTP activity in rat hepatoma cells (12Meyerovitch J. Backer J.M. Csermely P. Shoelson S.E. Kahn C.R. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 10338-10344Google Scholar) and in livers from alloxan diabetic rats(13Boylan J.M. Brautigan D.L. Madden J. Raven T. Ellis L. Gruppuso P.A. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 174-179Google Scholar). However, little is known about the identity of the PTPs involved in IRTK regulation. To identify PTPs that negatively regulate the IRTK activity we developed a novel selection principle that allows establishment of stable cell lines with functionally coupled overexpression of IR and inhibitory PTPs. For this purpose we used a previously established baby hamster kidney cell line (BHK-IR)(14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schäffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. M⊘ller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Google Scholar), which exhibits high levels of IR expression and responds to insulin stimulation with complete growth inhibition of adherent cells. PTPs that impede or block the insulin signal can consequently be identified by their capacity to restore cell growth. This effect was found to be induced through direct activation of the insulin receptor with half-maximal effect at physiological relevant concentrations of the hormone. Therefore, the BHK-IR cell line can be used to identify PTPs with activity toward the receptor itself. Twelve different PTPs were analyzed by this procedure, and the closely related receptor-like phosphatases, PTPα (15Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Google Scholar) and PTPɛ(16Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Google Scholar), were found to be efficient negative regulators of the IRTK. Antibodies used were mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 5E.2(17Fendly B.M. Winget M. Hudziak R.M. Lipari M.T. Napier M.A. Ullrich A. Cancer Res. 1990; 50: 1550-1558Google Scholar), mouse monoclonal anti-PTP1B (Oncogene Science), mouse monoclonal anti-CD45, and polyclonal rabbit anti-peptide antisera against the other PTPs and the IRTK C terminus (CT104). Secondary antibody preparations (goat anti-mouse and goat anti-rabbit antibodies) were obtained from Bio-Rad. BHK cell lines were maintained at 37°C under 5% CO2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 g liter-1 glucose, 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mML-glutamine, 1 μM methotrexate, and penicillin/streptomycin. Stable BHK-IR/PTP cell lines were maintained in complete medium in the presence of 100 nM insulin. The parental cell line BHK-IR was grown under the same conditions without insulin. BHK-IR was previously (14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schäffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. M⊘ller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Google Scholar) established by transfection of the cell line BHK tk-ts13 with cDNA encoding the insulin receptor (ATCC CRL 1632)(18Shen Y.-M. Hirschhorn R.R. Mercer W.E. Surmacz E. Tsutsui Y. Soprano K.J. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1145-1154Google Scholar, 19Talavera A. Basilico C. J. Cell. Physiol. 1977; 92: 425-436Google Scholar). For analysis of the insulin dose response, BHK-IR cells were seeded at a density of 1 × 105/well in 6-well plates and incubated for 20 h at the conditions described above. Human insulin was added corresponding to the indicated final concentrations, and the plates were incubated for further 24 h, after which the numbers of adherent and nonadherent cells were determined using a Coulter counter (triplicate). Similar conditions were used for the time course experiments, except that the final insulin concentration was 100 nM and that the numbers of adherent and nonadherent cells were determined at the indicated time intervals. Five 6-well plates were seeded with 2 × 104 cells/well. After 24 h the number of adherent cells per well was determined in one plate (day 0). Insulin was added to the remaining four plates at a final concentration of 100 nM to three wells per plate (+insulin) with the other three wells as controls (-insulin). After a further 24 h of incubation the number of adherent cells was determined in one plate (day 1) while the remaining plates were washed three times to remove nonadherent cells, and fresh medium with and without insulin was added. This procedure was repeated every 24 h for the next 3 days. For the rescue experiments, BHK-IR cells were seeded at a density of 5 × 104 per 6-cm tissue culture dish and incubated for 20 h. Six μg of expression plasmids containing cDNAs encoding PTPs were transfected into the BHK-IR cells as described by Chen and Okayama (20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar) with empty vectors as a negative control. Eighteen hours later the cells were washed once, and fresh medium was added. For the next 12 days the cells were treated daily with insulin (100 nM final concentration), and nonadherent cells were removed. The rescued clones were then visualized by staining in 0.5% crystal violet (w/v) in 30% (v/v) methanol. To analyze the influence of PTPs on the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins, all cells were grown under standardized conditions. Exponentially growing cells were seeded in 14-cm tissue culture dishes (Nunclon™ delta, Nunc Denmark) in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium without insulin at a density of 1 × 106 cells/dish. The cells were cultured for 48 h, trypsinized, and seeded at a density of 200,000 cells/6-cm dish containing 4 ml of medium. After a further 24 h, the cells were washed once in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum, glutamine, methotrexate, and antibiotics, and starved in the same medium for 22-24 h. Insulin was added at appropriate time intervals, and the cells were lysed directly in SDS loading buffer (20% (v/v) glycerol, 3% (w/v) SDS, 3% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol, 10 mM EDTA, 0.05% (w/v) bromphenol blue), boiled for 5 min, and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting by loading lysates corresponding to the same number of cells in all lanes. To assess the cell numbers, four 6-cm dishes from each of the cell lines were grown in parallel with those used for immunoblotting. These dishes were trypsinized to obtain the cell number using a Coulter counter. The enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Corp.) was used for detection of phosphotyrosine and protein antigens on immunoblots. With the objective of identifying PTPs that negatively regulate the insulin receptor activity we developed a novel insulin-based selection strategy. A previously established BHK-IR cell line (14Andersen A.S. Kjeldsen T. Wiberg F.C. Vissing H. Schäffer L. Rasmussen J.S. De Meyts P. M⊘ller N.P.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13681-13686Google Scholar) was found to possess two essential properties for an efficient dominant selection method. First, like its parental line BHK tk-ts13 it can be transfected very efficiently with DNA(18Shen Y.-M. Hirschhorn R.R. Mercer W.E. Surmacz E. Tsutsui Y. Soprano K.J. Baserga R. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1982; 2: 1145-1154Google Scholar). Second, it exhibits high levels of IR expression and responds to insulin stimulation with growth inhibition, rounding, and detachment from the substratum of cell culture dishes (Fig. 1A). These phenotypic changes were specific for BHK-IR cells and could not be evoked in the parental line or transfected BHK control cells overexpressing ELAM1 (Fig. 1B). We reasoned that these responses could be used to establish conditions where insulin would completely inhibit the growth of adherent cells. Thereby, molecules that negatively control the insulin signal could be identified by virtue of their rescuing capacity upon transfection of corresponding cDNA expression plasmids into BHK-IR cells. To first establish conditions for the selection procedure we determined the optimal hormone concentration (Fig. 2A) and time of stimulation for achievement of a measurable cell response (Fig. 2B). Half maximal effect was observed at a concentration of approximately 1 nM, with an optimal concentration at about 100 nM. Rounding of cells started quickly after addition of insulin, with detachment being detectable as early as 1 h after insulin stimulation. A significant growth arrest could be observed after 24 h (Fig. 2B). Therefore, the growth of adherent BHK-IR cells could be fully inhibited by insulin treatment in analogy to conventional dominant selection systems, e.g. methotrexate (Fig. 2C). We then tested whether expression of PTPs in BHK-IR cells could counteract the insulin-induced effects. Twelve different PTP cDNAs inserted into cytomegalovirus promoter-based plasmids were transfected into BHK-IR cells (20Chen C. Okayama H. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 2745-2752Google Scholar) which were subsequently kept under selection pressure with insulin for 14 days. This time allowed for the growth of individual insulin resistant cell clones that were stained and counted (Fig. 2D; Table 1). Two closely related receptor-type PTPs, PTPα (15Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Google Scholar) and PTPɛ(16Krueger N.X. Streuli M. Saito H. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 3241-3252Google Scholar), and with a lower efficiency, the intracellular TC-PTP (21Cool D.E. Tonks N.K. Charbonneau H. Walsh K.A. Fischer E.H. Krebs E.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1989; 86: 5257-5261Google Scholar) were most efficient in suppressing cell detachment. Very few clones were obtained with CD45 (22Ralph S.J. Thomas M.L. Morton C.C. Trowbridge I.S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1251-1257Google Scholar), PTP1C(23Shen S.-H. Bastien L. Posner B.I. Chrétien P. Nature. 1991; 352: 736-739Google Scholar), PTPH1(24Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Google Scholar), and PTP1B(25Brown-Shimer S. Johnson K.A. Lawrence J.B. Johnson C. Bruskin A. Green N.R. Hill D.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 5148-5152Google Scholar), whereas LAR(26Streuli M. Krueger N.X. Hall L.R. Schlossman S.F. Saito H. J. Exp. Med. 1988; 168: 1523-1530Google Scholar), PTPσ (27Yan H. Grossman A. Wang H. D' Eustachio P. Mossie K. Musacchio J.M. Silvennoinen O. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24880-24886Google Scholar), PTPμ(28Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. van Kessel A.G. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Google Scholar), PTP1D(29Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar), PTPD1 (30M⊘ller N.P.H. M⊘ller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Sures I. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7477-7481Google Scholar) did not have any effect on the restoration of cell attachment. Stable clones that were obtained in parallel assays were found to exhibit IR expression levels comparable to the parental BHK-IR line (Fig. 3). PTP overexpression was additionally verified in these clones by immunoblotting with specific antibodies (Fig. 4). It has recently been shown that PTPα, when transiently expressed in COS-1 cells, gives rise to two proteins of about 100 and 130 kDa(31Daum G. Regenass S. Sap J. Schlessinger J. Fischer E.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10524-10528Google Scholar). The 100-kDa species exhibits N-linked glycosylation only and is a precursor of the 130-kDa protein which in addition contains O-linked carbohydrates. We have also observed these two molecular species when PTPα is transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney fibroblast 293 cells and BHK-IR cells (not shown). In contrast, the fully glycosylated 130-kDa protein is the predominant form in the rescued BHK-IR cells (Fig. 4). Transient expression of PTPH1 results in a protein of about 105 kDa (not shown), which is in agreement with its predicted molecular mass(24Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Google Scholar). Interestingly, Yang and Tonks (24Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Google Scholar) found that reticulocyte lysate expression of PTPH1 yielded a protein of about 120 kDa, which is in complete agreement with the molecular mass of PTPH1 observed in BHK-IR/PTPH1 cells (Fig. 4). The molecular basis for this difference needs to be investigated further. For those PTPs that were not able to restore cell growth, transient expression in transfected BHK-IR cells was monitored to confirm the capability of the BHK cells to express these phosphatases (not shown). Further, an inactive mutant of PTPα was unable to restore cell attachment despite the fact that it exhibited even higher levels of expression than the intact enzyme when transiently expressed in BHK cells (not shown). These results suggest that PTPs can specifically interfere with insulin dependent signaling.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 4:Analysis of PTP expression in BHK-IR/PTP clones. Samples from the lysates used in Fig. 3 were subjected to immunoblot analysis with specific PTP antibodies as described under “Materials and Methods.” The control lanes contain the corresponding lysate from the parental BHK-IR cell line. The positions of molecular size standards (kDa) are indicated.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To investigate the mechanism underlying the PTP-mediated rescue and to identify putative PTPs with direct activity toward the IRTK, we compared the pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins in selected BHK-IR/PTP cell clones. Pallen and Tong (32Pallen C.J. Tong P.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 6996-7000Google Scholar) recently found that the membrane tyrosine phosphatase activity of Swiss 3T3 cells is about 8-fold higher in confluent cells than in cells harvested at low or medium density. In accordance with this we found that the insulin-mediated growth arrest as well as the overall tyrosine phosphorylation level of BHK-IR cells depend on the cell density (not shown). Therefore, we employed a strict and standardized scheme for passage of the cells before analysis as described under “Materials and Methods.” After insulin stimulation several proteins were phosphorylated, among which the IR β-subunit and bands at 190, 75-80, 63, and 35 kDa were most prominent (Fig. 3). The PTPs that most potently restore cell growth of insulin-treated BHK-IR cells, i.e. PTPα and PTPɛ, also appeared to be the most effective in reducing tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR β-subunit and the unidentified 75-80-kDa kinase substrates, whereas intracellular PTPs showed little, if any, activity. Interestingly, CD45, which is normally expressed only in cells of the immune system, had a comparable influence on IR β-subunit phosphorylation. While the 63-kDa band appeared only in PTP1C-transfected cells, and therefore represents the tyrosine-phosphorylated form of this SH2 domain containing phosphatase, the phosphorylation state of the 35-kDa polypeptide (pp35) correlated with the potency of PTPs α, ɛ, and TC to restore attachment of BHK-IR cells (Table 1). However, pp35 cannot be the sole mediator of cell detachment, as indicated by the clear difference in potency of TC-PTP versus PTPα and PTPɛ. In the present study we introduced a novel selection system to identify PTPs that negatively regulate tyrosine kinase signaling. More specifically we analyzed the influence of 12 different PTPs on insulin receptor signaling. Our findings indicate a significant, selective role of receptor-like PTPs α and ɛ as negative regulators of the IRTK. This is in accordance with previous studies which suggest that PTPs responsible for IRTK regulation belong to the class of membrane-associated (10Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11215-11221Google Scholar) and glycosylated molecules(33Häring H.-U. Kasuga M. White M.F. Crettaz M. Kahn C.R. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 3298-3306Google Scholar, 34Sale G.J. Adv. Prot. Phosphatases. 1991; 6: 159-186Google Scholar). Further, PTPα has wide tissue expression, including the major insulin target tissues liver and skeletal muscle, as would be expected from a PTP with regulatory activity toward the IR(15Sap J. D'Eustachio P. Givol D. Schlessinger J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6112-6116Google Scholar, 35Zhang W.-R. Goldstein B.J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1991; 178: 1291-1297Google Scholar, 36Matthews R.J. Cahir E.D. Thomas M.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 4444-4448Google Scholar). Hashimoto et al.(37Hashimoto N. Feener E.P. Zhang W.-R. Goldstein B.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13811-13814Google Scholar) have proposed that PTP LAR might play a role in the physiological regulation of insulin receptors in intact cells. However, their conclusion was reached by comparing the rate of dephosphorylation/inactivation of purified IR using recombinant PTP1B as well as the cytoplasmic domains of LAR and PTPα. Antisense inhibition was recently used to study the effect of LAR on insulin signaling in a rat hepatoma cell line(38Kulas D.T. Zhang W.-R. Goldstein B.J. Furlanetto R.W. Mooney R.A. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 2435-2438Google Scholar). A suppression of LAR protein levels by about 60% was paralleled by an approximately 150% increase in insulin-induced autophosphorylation. However, only a modest 35% increase in IRTK activity was observed, whereas the insulin-dependent phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activity was significantly increased by 350%. Reduced LAR levels did not alter the basal level of IRTK tyrosine phosphorylation or activity. The authors speculate that LAR could specifically dephosphorylate tyrosine residues that are critical for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation either on the insulin receptor itself or on a downstream substrate. In contrast to these studies, we do not find any indication that LAR, or the two other receptor-like PTPs (PTPσ(27Yan H. Grossman A. Wang H. D' Eustachio P. Mossie K. Musacchio J.M. Silvennoinen O. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24880-24886Google Scholar), PTPμ(28Gebbink M.F.B.G. van Etten I. Hateboer G. Suijkerbuijk R. Beijersbergen R.L. van Kessel A.G. Moolenaar W.H. FEBS Lett. 1991; 290: 123-130Google Scholar)), show activity toward IRTK when employing our functional, insulin-based selection principle. This might indicate that phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation is not essential for the insulin-induced growth inhibition of BHK-IR cells. Interestingly, CD45, which is normally expressed only in cells of the immune system, had a similar influence on the overall tyrosine phosphorylation of the IR β-subunit in BHK-IR cells when compared with PTPs α and ɛ but was less effective on pp35 and very inefficient in preventing cell detachment (Fig. 3, Table 1). This suggests to us that CD45 is not directed toward the regulatory tyrosine 1150 domain, but phosphorylated tyrosine residues that reside outside this region and therefore are not involved in the activation of the IRTK. Several studies have addressed the question of PTP specificity using synthetic peptides(39Ramachandran C. Aebersold R. Tonks N.K. Pot D.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 4232-4238Google Scholar, 40Zhang Z.-Y. Thieme-Sefler A.M. MacLean D. McNamara D.J. Dobrusin E.M. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 4446-4450Google Scholar, 41Cho H. Ramer S.E. Itoh M. Kitas E. Bannwarth W. Burn P. Saito H. Walsh C.T. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 133-138Google Scholar, 42Zhang Z.-Y. MacLean D. McNamara D.J. Sawyer T.K. Dixon J.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 2285-2290Google Scholar). These investigations have provided important insight with respect to primary structural sequence requirements for substrate recognition. However, an obvious limitation of this approach is the lack of defined three-dimensional structure of the peptides. Likewise, the PTPs utilized for these analyses are removed from their natural environment. Since at least part of the PTP specificity seems to be conveyed by a defined subcellular localization (43Mauro L.J. Dixon J.E. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 151-155Google Scholar), it is essential that PTP activity toward cellular substrates is tested in intact cells. We believe that the present method with its functional coupling and presumed correct localization of the key elements to specific subcellular compartments provide the necessary tools for analysis of PTP specificity toward IRTK. This study indicates that receptor-like PTPs play a significant role in regulating the IRTK, whereas intracellular PTPs have little, if any, activity toward the insulin receptor. Even though TC-PTP efficiently prevents insulin-induced detachment of BHK-IR cells, the effect is not as pronounced as with PTPα and PTPɛ. While it appears that the target of the negative regulatory activity of PTPs α and ɛ is the receptor itself, the down-modulating effect of the intracellular TC-PTP seems to be due to a downstream function in the IR-activated signal resulting in cell detachment. We speculate that pp35 could be a direct target of TC-PTP. Although PTP1B and TC-PTP are closely related, PTP1B is only weakly active in the present selection system and has only little influence on the phosphorylation pattern of insulin-treated BHK-IR cells. Both PTPs have distinct structural features that determine their subcellular localization and thereby their access to defined cellular substrates(44Frangioni J.V. Beahm P.H. Shifrin V. Jost C.A. Neel B.J. Cell. 1992; 68: 545-560Google Scholar, 45Faure R. Posner B.I. Glia. 1993; 9: 311-314Google Scholar). Therefore, the lack of activity of PTP1B and TC-PTP toward the IRTK may, at least in part, be explained by the fact that they do not co-localize with the activated insulin receptor. In support of this view, PTP1B and TC-PTP have been excluded as candidates for the IR-associated PTPs in hepatocytes based on subcellular localization studies(10Faure R. Baquiran G. Bergeron J.J.M. Posner B.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11215-11221Google Scholar). It was recently found that the ubiquitously expressed SH2 domain containing protein tyrosine phosphatase, PTP1D(29Vogel W. Lammers R. Huang J. Ullrich A. Science. 1993; 259: 1611-1614Google Scholar), associates with and dephosphorylates IRS-1, but apparently not the IR itself(46Kuhné M.R. Pawson T. Lienhard G.E. Feng G.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11479-11481Google Scholar, 47Kuhné M.R. Zhao Z. Rowles J. Lavan B.E. Shen S.H. Fischer E.H. Lienhard G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15833-15837Google Scholar). Further, PTP1D seems to act as a positive mediator in insulin-stimulated Ras activation (48Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Google Scholar) and of growth factor-induced mitogenic signal transduction(49Xiao S. Rose D.W. Sasaoka T. Maegawa H. Burke Jr., T.R. Roller P.P. Shoelson S.E. Olefsky J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 21244-21248Google Scholar). It is in agreement with these studies that PTP1D does not exhibit any rescuing capacity in our selection system which is designed to identify negative regulators only. In contrast, the structurally related SH2-containing phosphatase, PTP1C, which is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, seems to act as negative regulator of growth factor-stimulated proliferation (50Bignon J.S. Siminovitch K.A. Clin. Immunol. Immunopathol. 1994; 73: 168-179Google Scholar, 51Cyster J.G. Goodnow C.C. Immunity. 1995; 2: 13-24Google Scholar, 52Yi T. Mui A.L.-F. Krystal G. Ihle J.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 7577-7586Google Scholar). In accordance with this we have observed that PTP1C can act as a weak, negative regulator of the insulin response in BHK-IR cells (Table 1). However, even though PTP1C is heavily phosphorylated after insulin treatment of BHK-IR cells, it has only weak, if any, activity toward the IRTK (Fig. 3)(48Noguchi T. Matozaki T. Horita K. Fujioka Y. Kasuga M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6674-6682Google Scholar). Two intracellular PTPs with ezrin-like N-terminal domains, PTPD1 (30M⊘ller N.P.H. M⊘ller K.B. Lammers R. Kharitonenkov A. Sures I. Ullrich A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 7477-7481Google Scholar) and PTPH1(24Yang Q. Tonks N.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 5949-5953Google Scholar), were also analyzed for their capacity to negatively regulate the insulin signal in BHK-IR cells. Both PTPs have been proposed to localize to the junction of the cytoskeleton and the plasma membrane. We have previously shown PTPD1 to be phosphorylated by and associated with c-Src in vitro and hypothesized it to be involved in the regulation of phosphorylation of focal adhesions (30M⊘ller N.P.H.

In agreement with this, PTPD1 did not show any effects at all, whereas PTPH1 gave rise to very few stable cell clones, but did not lead to a change in the phosphorylation pattern of BHK-IR cells. With regard to the molecular basis of the BHK-IR cell detachment response, several observations point to a phosphoprotein of 35 kDa as an important mediator (Fig. 3; Table 1; not shown): (i) the rescuing capacity of PTPs inversely parallels the degree of pp35 phosphorylation in BHK-IR/PTP cell lines; (ii) confluent BHK-IR cells respond poorly to insulin with respect to cell detachment and show relatively low levels of pp35 phosphorylation; (iii) transient expression of v-Src in BHK-IR results in massive rounding and detachment of the cells with a concomitant intense phosphorylation of pp35; (iv) time course studies show that p35 phosphorylation increases even further several hours after insulin stimulation, i.e. corresponding to the occurrence of rounding of the cells. Interestingly, in A431 cells the epidermal growth factor induces phenotypic changes similar to insulin in BHK-IR cells and also causes tyrosine phosphorylation of a 35-kDa polypeptide(53Fava R.A. Cohen S. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 2636-2645Google Scholar, 54Pepinsky R.B. Sinclair L.K. Nature. 1986; 321: 81-84Google Scholar). This protein was identified as a member of the lipocortin/annexin family(54Pepinsky R.B. Sinclair L.K. Nature. 1986; 321: 81-84Google Scholar), which has previously been shown to include substrates of the IRTK in vitro and in intact hepatocytes after corticosteroid treatment(55Karasik A. Pepinsky R.B. Shoelson S.E. Kahn C.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 11862-11867Google Scholar). Whether pp35 in BHK-IR cells belongs to this class of proteins remains to be investigated. PTPs or other proteins that would impede or block any of the signaling steps leading to the insulin-induced phenotypic changes of the BHK-IR cells could be identified by the method presented here. These changes are prerequisites for the selection principle and the establishment of stable cell lines with functionally coupled expression of IR and opposing PTPs. Some of the downstream elements involved in induction of growth inhibition and detachment of BHK-IR cells may not represent molecules that actually mediate the effects of insulin in vivo. Nevertheless, since the changed phenotype of the BHK-IR cells is induced via normal activation of the insulin receptor our procedure allows, for the first time, identification of PTPs as regulators of insulin signaling at the level of the receptor itself. While previous reports indicate a role of PTPα in signal transduction through Src activation (56Zheng X.M. Wang Y. Pallen C.J. Nature. 1992; 359: 336-339Google Scholar, 57den Hertog J. Pals C.E.G.M.

In view of recent findings indicating the crucial importance of signal duration and therefore negative regulation of tyrosine kinase signals(60Traverse S. Seedorf K. Paterson H. Marshall C.J.

We have now investigated this interaction in more detail and have found, based on both blotting studies with glutathione S-transferase-p85-SH2 fusion proteins and binding of these fusion proteins to SDS-denatured EpRs, that this binding is direct. Moreover, both in vitro competition studies, involving phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the amino acid sequences flanking the eight tyrosines within the intracellular domain of the EpR, and in vivo studies with mutant EpRs bearing tyrosine to phenylalanine substitutions, indicate that phosphorylation of Tyr503 within the EpR is essential for the binding of PI 3-kinase. The presence of PI 3-kinase activity in EpR immunoprecipitates from DA-3 cells infected with wild-type but not Y503F EpRs confirms this finding. Our results demonstrate that the SH2 domains of p85 can bind, in addition to their well established Tyr-Met/Val-X-Met consensus binding sequence, a Tyr-Val-Ala-Cys motif that is present in the EpR. A comparison of erythropoietin-induced tyrosine phosphorylations and proliferation of wild-type and Y503F EpR-infected DA-3 cells revealed no differences. However, the PI-3 kinase inhibitor, wortmannin, markedly inhibited the erythropoietin-induced proliferation of both cell types, suggesting that PI 3-kinase is activated in Y503F EpR expressing cells. This was confirmed by carrying out PI 3-kinase assays with anti-phosphotyrosine immunoprecipitates from erythropoietin-stimulated Y503F EpR-infected DA-3 cells and suggested that PI 3-kinase has a role in regulating erythropoietin-induced proliferation, but at a site distinct from the EpR.

https://openalex.org/W2068528336,"We have previously demonstrated an interaction between the highly conserved KXGFFKR sequence of the integrin α-subunit cytoplasmic domains and calreticulin. Since this highly conserved sequence motif has been implicated in the regulation of the integrin affinity state, we wanted to determine whether the calreticulin-integrin interaction also depended on the integrin affinity state, and whether calreticulin occupation of integrin via the KXGFFKR motif was involved in the regulation of the ligand affinity state. We now demonstrate that anti-integrin antibody- or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced activation of the α2β1 integrin on Jurkat cells, as determined by stimulation of adhesion to collagen type I, resulted in an increased amount of calreticulin bound to this integrin. α2β1 activation with either anti-β1 or anti-α2 monoclonal antibodies resulted in a greater amount of calreticulin coimmunoprecipitating with this integrin. Inactivation by neutralizing anti-integrin antibodies abrogated the calreticulin-integrin interaction. A correlation was also found between PMA-induced α2β1 activation and the amount of calreticulin bound to this integrin. Furthermore, pretreatment of streptolysin O-permeablized Jurkat cells with an anti-calreticulin antibody resulted in a significant and specific inhibition of the adhesion to collagen type I that could be induced by antibodies to α2β1 or by PMA. These data suggest that the active, high affinity form of α2β1 binds calreticulin and that calreticulin binding to the α2 cytoplasmic domain may be required for stabilizing the high affinity state of this integrin.

The data presented here also demonstrate, for the first time, an inducible interaction of an integrin with an intracellular protein that occurs via the α subunit of the integrin. The integrins are a family of heterodimeric, transmembrane glycoproteins that are formed by the noncovalent association of α and β subunits(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 2Ruoslahti E. Pierschbacher M.D. Science. 1987; 238: 491-497Google Scholar). As transmembrane proteins, integrins can interact with both extracellular molecules and intracellular proteins, interactions which define integrin function. On the cell exterior, domains of the α and β subunits combine to form a ligand binding site. Through this site, integrins can mediate cell binding to various substrates including extracellular matrix molecules(3Dedhar S. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 583-590Google Scholar, 4Juliano R.L. Haskill S. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 577-585Google Scholar), other cell surface proteins(1Hynes R.O. Cell. 1992; 69: 11-25Google Scholar, 5Springer T.A. Nature. 1990; 346: 425-434Google Scholar), and in some cases, other integrins(6Symington B.E. Takada Y. Carter W.G. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 523-535Google Scholar). Interior to the plasma membrane, the cytoplasmic domains of integrin subunits can engage in interactions with intracellular proteins(7Dedhar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 269-271Google Scholar, 8Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 109-112Google Scholar), and these interactions, unlike those of extracellular ligand binding, can occur independently of subunit association in vitro. The best studied cytoplasmic interactions in which integrins take part are those involving the β1 subunit. The cytoplasmic domain of the β1 subunit has been shown to interact with components of the actin-based cytoskeleton, namely α-actinin (9Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Google Scholar) and talin(10Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Google Scholar). In contrast to these β subunit-specific functions, cytoplasmic interactions involving the α subunits have not been as well characterized. The cytoplasmic domains of the integrin α subunits are diverse in both length and amino acid composition. The only generally conserved feature within the α subunit cytoplasmic domains is the KXGFFKR motif which immediately follows the membrane spanning domain(3Dedhar S. BioEssays. 1990; 12: 583-590Google Scholar, 8Williams M.J. Hughes P.E. O'Toole T.E. Ginsberg M.H. Trends Cell Biol. 1994; 4: 109-112Google Scholar). The conservation of this motif in all α subunits suggests that it plays a crucial role in integrin function. Studies using transfected integrin subunits support this hypothesis by showing that chimeric integrins containing disrupted GFFKR motifs are fixed in high affinity ligand-binding states(11O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Google Scholar). Thus the KXGFFKR motif may be important for maintaining the conformation of the integrin in a low affinity default state and possibly for additional regulatory functions. In what is one of the best examples, to date, of an integrin α subunit-cytoplasmic protein association, the KXGFFKR motif of integrin α subunits has been shown to interact with the intracellular protein, calreticulin. Initial experiments revealed that affinity chromatography of cell extracts using KLGFFKR peptides resulted in the isolation of a ∼60-kDa protein with amino acid sequence homology and immunological similarity to calreticulin(12Rojiani M.V. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Google Scholar). Subsequently, calreticulin was immunocytochemically shown to colocalize with integrins, and antisense oligonucleotide down-regulation of calreticulin led to a decrease in integrin-mediated cell attachment and spreading(13Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar). Calreticulin is a highly conserved, ubiquitously expressed intracellular protein whose functions are just beginning to be understood. Calreticulin was first identified as a calcium binding protein of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in skeletal muscle(14MacLennan D.H. Wong P.T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1972; 68: 1231-1235Google Scholar, 15Ostwald T.J. MacLennan D.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1974; 249: 974-979Google Scholar). Originally thought to be restricted to the endoplasmic reticulum, it has subsequently been shown that calreticulin can localize to the nucleus and/or the cytoplasm in some cell types(7Dedhar S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 269-271Google Scholar, 16Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Google Scholar, 17Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Google Scholar). Recently, it has been shown that calreticulin can bind to steroid hormone receptors and consequently down-regulate the expression of steroid hormone responsive genes(18Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Google Scholar, 19Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matusik R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Google Scholar). Importantly, calreticulin has been shown to bind to the DNA binding domain of these hormone receptors via an amino acid motif, KXFF(K/R)R, that is present in all steroid hormone receptors and which is nearly identical to the KXGFFKR motif of integrin α subunits. Thus, via a similar motif, calreticulin may be able to bind to two disparate families of proteins, one in the nucleus and one at the plasma membrane, and therefore modulate the function of these proteins. In the present study, we examine more closely the role of calreticulin in integrin function. Using Jurkat T-lymphoblastoid cells, we find that calreticulin is associated with α2β1 in cells that have been stimulated to adhere to collagen type I by activation with monoclonal antibodies to the α2 and β1 integrin subunits. Similar results were seen when the cells were stimulated to adhere by treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). 1The abbreviations used are: PMAphorbol 12-myristate 13-acetatePIPES1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. The stimulation of Jurkat cell adhesion by anti-integrin antibodies or PMA was found to be additive when the two stimuli were applied together. Thus, extracellular and intracellular events induced both cell adhesion to integrin ligand and the interaction of calreticulin with α2β1 in these cells. The findings of these studies suggest that the functional state of an integrin could alter the cellular distribution of calreticulin and/or that the functional state of an integrin may be partially dependent upon or affected by its interaction with calreticulin. phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate 1,4-piperazinediethanesulfonic acid. [3H]Thymidine was purchased from DuPont NEN. The anti-α2 integrin (P1E6), anti-α3 integrin (P1B5), and anti-β1 integrin (P4C10) monoclonal antibodies were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. The JB1, 6F4, and B3B11 anti-β1 as well as the JBS2 anti-α2 monoclonal antibodies were prepared as described elsewhere(20Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell.

Anti-protein disulfide isomerase antibody was a kind gift from Dr. Marek Michalak (University of Alberta, Edmonton, AL). Collagen type I was purchased from Sigma and CNBr-activated Sepharose from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Secondary antibodies were purchased from Jackson Immunoresearch Laboratories. The properties of the (noncommercial) anti-integrin antibodies used here are described in Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Human Jurkat cells (clone E6.3) were grown in suspension culture in RPMI 1640 containing 5% fetal calf serum and 5 × 10−5M 2-mercaptoethanol. Prior to analysis, cells were harvested from culture by centrifugation, washed in serum-free RPMI 1640, and resuspended in serum-free RPMI 1640. The cells were then incubated at 37°C with occasional mixing for 30 min in the presence of various antibodies (10 μg/ml final) or PMA (1-10 nM). Following this incubation period, the cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline (100 mM NaCl, 10 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.3) and then analyzed for cell attachment or lysed for use in protein analyses. The collagen type I was suspended at 10 μg/ml in phosphate-buffered saline and 100 μl/well were used to precoat 96-well plates (Linbro/Titertek, McLean, VA) at 4°C overnight. Wells were washed and then blocked at 37°C for 2 h with wash buffer (RPMI 1640, 2.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin). Jurkat cells were prelabeled with [3H]thymidine (1 μCi/ml of culture medium) at 37°C overnight. After activation, 5 × 104 cells were seeded into quadruplicate wells and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Plates were then gently inverted to remove nonadherent cells and washed twice with 150 μl of wash buffer. The remaining adherent cells were lysed and attachment was quantitated by scintillation counting of 3H. Antibody- and PMA-treated Jurkat cells were lysed in radioimmuno precipitation buffer (phosphate-buffered saline, pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 0.5% deoxycholate, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation and protein concentrations were determined with the Bio-Rad protein assay. Equivalent amounts of protein were immunoprecipitated with anti-α2 antibody (P1E6) that had been conjugated to CNBr-activated Sepharose beads. Immunoprecipitated protein complexes were washed twice with radioimmuno precipitation buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl and then twice with radioimmuno precipitation buffer alone. The immunoprecipitated proteins were resuspended by boiling in Laemmli sample buffer and then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide (7.5%) gel electrophoresis under nonreducing conditions. Proteins were electrophoretically transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Immobilon P, Millipore, Bedford, MA), and the membranes were then blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin in TBS-T (20 mM Tris-HCl, 137 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween 20, pH 7.6). The membranes were cut in two, and the top portions were probed with the mouse anti-human β1 monoclonal antibody P4C10 while the bottom portions were probed with the rabbit anti-human calreticulin antiserum LAR090. Species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies were then applied, and detection was performed using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) detection system (Amersham Corp.) following the manufacturer's instructions. The relative intensities of protein bands in the Western blots were determined using an LKB laser densitometer (model 2222-020) and Gelscan XL software (Pharmacia). [3H]Thymidine-labeled Jurkat cells were washed and exposed to streptolysin O (100 μg/ml) at 37°C for 30 min(21Pacifici R. Roman J. Kimble R. Civitelli R. Brownfield C.M. Bizzarri C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2222-2233Google Scholar). The cells were then washed four times with streptolysin O buffer (21Pacifici R. Roman J. Kimble R. Civitelli R. Brownfield C.M. Bizzarri C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2222-2233Google Scholar) (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 20 mM PIPES, 5.6 mM glucose, pH 7.0) and resuspended with either rabbit IgG (50 μg/ml) or protein A-purified anti-calreticulin antibody LAR090 (50 μg/ml). After incubation for 1 h at 37°C, the cells were washed extensively with serum-free medium, resuspended, and activated with the anti-integrin antibodies as described above. Jurkat cells express the integrin α2β1 on their surface, but display only minimal spontaneous adherence to collagen type I(22Wilkins J.A. Stupack D. Stewart S. Caixia S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 517-522Google Scholar). Previous investigations have shown that treatment of Jurkat cells with anti-integrin antibodies can induce these cells to adhere to collagen type I in an integrin α2β1-dependent manner(20Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 237-245Google Scholar, 23Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Google Scholar). Recently, we have characterized several monoclonal antibodies (JB1, B3B11, 6F4, JBS2) which recognize specific epitopes on the α2 or the β1 integrin subunits (24Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Google Scholar). 2J. Wilkins, D. Stupack, H. Ni, N. Hunt and C. Shen, manuscript submitted for publication. In the present study we show that these antibodies have differing capacities to induce Jurkat cells to adhere to collagen type I. Fig. 1A shows that treatment of Jurkat cells with JB1, 6F4, B3B11, JBS2, or combinations of these antibodies resulted in the stimulation of adhesion of these cells to type I collagen. When the cells were concomitantly treated with the inhibitory anti-β1 antibody AIIB2, this induced adhesion to collagen type I was reduced. As shown previously(20Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 237-245Google Scholar), and again here in Fig. 1B, the adhesion induced by stimulation of Jurkat cells with both anti-α2 and anti-β1antibodies is completely α2 dependent. Fig. 1B represent experiments wherein Jurkat cells were stimulated to adhere to collagen I with either anti-α2 antibody (JBS2) or anti-β1 antibodies (JB1 and B3B11). In each case, the induced adhesion could be neutralized by the presence of the inhibitory anti-α2 antibody PIE6. In contrast to this, a function-blocking anti-α3 antibody, P1B5, had no effect on the inducible adhesion of Jurkat cells to collagen type I. These data demonstrate that the binding of certain antibodies to the α2β1 integrin on Jurkat cells can induce the adhesion of these cells to type I collagen, possibly by causing conformational changes in this integrin. This induced adhesion can be abrogated by the presence of the function-blocking antibodies AIIB2 or P1E6. Calreticulin has been shown to interact with the KLGFFKR segment of integrins and with intact, labeled, integrin subunits in vitro(12Rojiani M.V. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Google Scholar, 13Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar). Calreticulin has also been shown to colocalize with clustered integrins at the plasma membrane(13Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar). Therefore, we decided to examine the relationship between calreticulin and the integrin α2β1 in Jurkat cells that had been induced to adhere to collagen I with specific antibodies. As in the adhesion experiments described in Fig. 1, Jurkat cells were treated with epitope-specific antibodies raised against either the α2 or the β1 integrin subunit. The cells were then lysed and the α2β1 integrin was immunoprecipitated from the lysates. Immunoprecipitated proteins were then analyzed for the presence of calreticulin by Western blotting as described under “Experimental Procedures.”Fig. 2A shows that an increased amount of calreticulin was found in association with α2β1 integrin in cells that were treated with conditions that induced adhesion to collagen I. In contrast, little calreticulin is seen in the anti-α2 immunoprecipitates of Jurkat cells that were not stimulated to adhere to collagen type I. In Fig. 2B, densitometric analysis of the Western blot in Fig. 2A is shown. The amount of calreticulin was quantified as described under “Experimental Procedures,” normalized to the amount of integrin that had been immunoprecipitated and displayed graphically. Thus, in these cells, increased calreticulin was found in association with integrin α2β1 that had been stimulated into adhesive activity with specific antibodies, while basal levels of calreticulin were found in association with α2β1 on nonadherent cells. Furthermore, the function-blocking antibody AIIB2 not only inhibited adhesion of Jurkat cells, but also decreased to basal levels the amount of α2β1-bound calreticulin that could be induced with activating antibodies. It has been previously shown that PMA can induce the adhesion of Jurkat cells to collagen type I and that this induced adhesion is α2β1-mediated(20Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 237-245Google Scholar, 22Wilkins J.A. Stupack D. Stewart S. Caixia S. Eur. J. Immunol. 1991; 21: 517-522Google Scholar, 23Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Google Scholar). These and the above results led us to investigate whether there was any interaction between calreticulin and the integrin α2β1 on Jurkat cells that had been stimulated to adhere to type I collagen via treatment with PMA. As in experiments described previously, [3H]thymidine-labeled Jurkat cells were treated with PMA, washed, and applied to adhesion assays on type I collagen. In agreement with previous studies(20Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 237-245Google Scholar), Fig. 3A shows that treatment of Jurkat cells with 1 nM PMA had minimal effect on cell adhesion, whereas treatment with 10 nM PMA resulted in approximately a 300% increase in Jurkat cell adhesion to collagen I. Fig. 3B demonstrates the α2β1 specificity of this PMA-induced adhesion. Greater than 80% of the adhesion induced by 10 nM PMA was abrogated by the inhibitory anti-α2 antibody PIE6. In direct correlation with the PMA-induced adhesion, Fig. 4A shows that similar treatment of Jurkat cells resulted in increased interaction of calreticulin with integrin α2β1. Briefly, Jurkat cells were treated with PMA, washed, and lysed. The α2β1 integrin was immunoprecipitated from the lysates, and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed for calreticulin by Western blotting as in above experiments. As seen in Fig. 4A, there is a dose-dependent increase in the amount of calreticulin associated with α2β1 in PMA-treated cells. As described under “Experimental Procedures,” densitometric analyses were performed to confirm, quantitatively, the increase in α2β1-bound calreticulin seen in Fig. 4A. The intensity of calreticulin staining was normalized to β1 and demonstrated graphically in Fig. 4B. Thus, PMA can induce Jurkat cells to adhere to collagen type I via their α2β1 integrin and can also trigger an interaction between this integrin and calreticulin. These results, taken together with those above, suggest that, when it is stimulated into adhesive activity on Jurkat cells, the integrin α2β1 interacts with the intracellular protein calreticulin. The results also indicate that the concomitant induction of α2β1 function and the association of this integrin with calreticulin can be caused by both external stimuli (e.g. activating antibody) and internal stimuli (through PMA). To determine if the activated adhesion or the induced interaction between calreticulin and α2β1 that we observed to be caused by treatment with either anti-integrin antibodies or PMA were maximal, we treated Jurkat cells with a combination of epitope-specific anti-integrin antibodies and PMA. The Jurkat cells were treated as in previous experiments except that some samples were incubated with both anti-integrin antibodies (B3B11 and JBS2) and PMA (10 nM) prior to either plating for adhesion assays or lysis for α2β1 immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Fig. 5 shows that the stimulation of Jurkat cell adhesion to type I collagen (A) and the amount of calreticulin co-purified in anti-α2β1 immunoprecipitates (B) was greatest when the Jurkat cells were treated with a combination of B3B11, JBS2, and 10 nM PMA. Importantly, the level of adhesion seen and the amount of calreticulin copurified with α2β1 under these conditions were greater than when Jurkat cells were treated with either of these reagents alone. Again, densitometric quantification corrected for β1 loading and is shown in Fig. 5C. The results of the adhesion experiments are in agreement with previous studies(20Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 237-245Google Scholar), and together these results suggest that both the activation of integrin function and the induced calreticulin-α2β1 interaction can be achieved via two different pathways, one stimulated by PMA and another mimicked by the anti-integrin antibodies. Moreover, these two pathways to integrin activation can be additive. In order to determine whether the binding of calreticulin to α2 was required for integrin activation, we introduced a purified anti-calreticulin antibody (LAR090) into streptolysin O-permeablized Jurkat cells prior to the integrin activation. Streptolysin O did not have any effect on cell viability as has been previously demonstrated by others(21Pacifici R. Roman J. Kimble R. Civitelli R. Brownfield C.M. Bizzarri C. J. Immunol. 1994; 153: 2222-2233Google Scholar). As shown in Fig. 6, neither activating anti-β1 antibodies nor PMA (10 nM) could stimulate adhesion to type I collagen in Jurkat cells which had been pretreated with the anti-calreticulin antibody. Both purified rabbit IgG and purified anti-protein disulfide isomerase had no effect on anti-β1- or PMA-induced adhesion when introduced into streptolysin O-treated cells. Like calreticulin, protein disulfide isomerase is an intracellular protein which contains a KDEL sequence and was thus targeted as an appropriate negative control. The results of these experiments are interesting in light of the fact that the anti-calreticulin antibody used here (LAR090) has been shown to be function-blocking. This was demonstrated by its neutralization of the interaction between calreticulin and the KXFF(K/R)R segment of steroid hormone receptors(19Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matusik R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Google Scholar). Therefore, inhibition of calreticulin binding to integrin inhibited the ability of both the activating anti-integrin antibodies and PMA to induce Jurkat cell adhesion to collagen I. The integrins are cell surface receptors for extracellular molecules which can transduce signals into cells as a result of binding to their ligands. Reciprocally, cytoskeletal and biochemical events within the cell can modify integrin function. We report here of an interaction, between the integrin α2β1 and the intracellular protein calreticulin, which may be involved in integrin-mediated signaling and/or in the intracellular modulation of integrin function. A functional interaction between integrins and calreticulin has been examined previously and is known to occur at the KXGFFKR segment of the integrin α subunit(12Rojiani M.V. Finlay B.B. Gray V. Dedhar S. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9859-9866Google Scholar, 13Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar). In the present study, we provide evidence that the interaction between calreticulin and integrin α2β1 is dependent upon the activation state of the integrin and can thus be induced by reagents that activate α2β1 function. We have demonstrated that treatment of a T-lymphoblastoid cell line, Jurkat, with activating antibodies against the α2 and β1 integrin subunits resulted in an increased association, above basal levels, between α2β1 and calreticulin that was concomitant with an increase in adhesion of these cells to type I collagen. Similar responses were seen when the cells were treated with PMA. In the PMA experiments, it was observed that 1 nM PMA had a negligible effect on cell adhesion but a significant effect on α2β1-calreticulin interaction. This is not surprising, considering the pleiotropic effects of PMA, and may reflect other influences that PMA has on the cells. It is also possible that stimulation of adhesion requires at least a minimum amount of interaction between calreticulin and α2β1. It is feasible that, in the case of 1 nM PMA, some α2β1-calreticulin association is induced but that this does not meet threshold requirements for cellular adhesion. It is important to note that Jurkat cells do have a minimal capacity to adhere to collagen I spontaneously. However, significant adhesion to this substrate has been shown to be inducible through treatments with anti-β1 antibodies, anti-α2 antibodies (JBS2 in particular) and PMA(20Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 237-245Google Scholar). In all cases, including the present study, induced Jurkat adhesion to collagen type I was specifically α2β1-mediated(20Stupack D.G. Shen C. Wilkins J.A. Cell. Immunol. 1994; 155: 237-245Google Scholar). Furthermore, the present study shows that both the adhesion to type I collagen and the interaction between α2β1 and calreticulin that were induced by treatment of Jurkat cells with a combination of activating antibodies and PMA together were increased above those that were seen with either treatment alone. The results indicate that an interaction between calreticulin and integrins, in this case α2β1, can occur within cells and be increased in response to specific stimuli. Moreover, the findings we present here suggest that the interaction between calreticulin and α2β1 is dependent upon the activation state of the integrin and can be stimulated by both extracellular and intracellular events. The binding of calreticulin to α2β1 is not only enhanced upon integrin activation, but appears to be a requirement for the maintenance of the activated state. Thus, occupation of the KXGFFKR motif by calreticulin may stabilize the active conformation of an integrin, since neutralization of this interaction can result in the inhibition of integrin-mediated adhesion. Preliminary antibody-binding studies with Jurkat cells indicate that JBI and 6F4 competitively inhibit the adherence of one another to cell surface β1 suggesting that the target epitopes are in close proximity. In contrast, B3B11 and JBS2 each recognize distinct epitopes from each of the other antibodies. 3J. Wilkins and D. Stupack, unpublished data. Collectively these results suggest that there are multiple regions of the integrin which are involved in the control of molecular activity. The epitope recognized by B3B11 and competing antibodies has been localized to a region within approximately 75 amino acids of the membrane adjacent to a predicted long range disulfide bond between the C7 and C456.2 While the exact location of the epitope recognized by AIIB2 binding is not known, competitive binding studies indicate that these two antibodies recognize distinct epitopes. 4J. Wilkins and D. Stupack, unpublished observations. Thus the inhibitory effects of AIIB2 on B3B11 induced association of calreticulin with α2 would seem to suggest that the antibody is either interfering with β1 activation or delivering a negative signal(23Kapron-Bras C. Fitz-Gibbon L. Jeevaratnam P. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 20701-20704Google Scholar). It is interesting to note that AIIB2, while inhibiting Jurkat adherence to collagen and fibronectin, induces homotypic cellular aggregation implying that interaction with this antibody may be inducing an alternate pattern of cellular response. In participating in signaling pathways, the direct protein-protein interactions in which integrins partake within the cell remain relatively elusive. Using mainly in vitro biochemical methods, the β1 integrin subunit cytoplasmic domain has been shown to interact with the cytoskeletal proteins talin (10Horwitz A. Duggan K. Buck C. Beckerle M.C. Burridge K. Nature. 1986; 320: 531-533Google Scholar) and α-actinin(9Otey C.A. Pavalko F.M. Burridge K. J. Cell Biol. 1990; 111: 721-729Google Scholar). Intracellular interactions involving integrin α subunits are less well studied, however, and the interaction between integrin α2β1 and calreticulin described here may be the first demonstration of an interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of an integrin α subunit and an intracellular protein that results in the transmission of signals into cells. While these results are largely correlative, it has recently been shown by immunofluorescent staining that calreticulin and α3β1, which is also a collagen receptor, can be induced to colocalize into distinct compartments(13Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar). It is also known that antisense down-regulation of calreticulin expression leads to a reduction in cell adhesion in P19 embryonal carcinoma cells and PC-3 prostatic carcinoma cells(13Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar). Furthermore, we have previously shown that antisense down-regulation of calreticulin abrogated the ability of adhesion-stimulating antibodies to induce adhesion of Jurkat cells in experiments similar to those described here (13Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar). Such findings are corroborated by the data, presented here in Fig. 6, showing that intracellular disruption of calreticulin function in Jurkat cells interfered with the ability of these cells to be induced to adhere to collagen type I. Thus, it is possible that calreticulin is, at the least, a transitory component in the establishment of fully functional adhesive apparatuses at the inner cell membrane. In light of recent studies showing a specific function for calreticulin in regulating the activity of steroid hormone receptors(18Burns K. Duggan B. Atkinson E.A. Famulski K.S. Nemer M. Bleackley R.C. Michalak M. Nature. 1994; 367: 476-480Google Scholar, 19Dedhar S. Rennie P.S. Shago M. Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Yang H. Filmus J. Hawley R.G. Bruchovsky N. Cheng H. Matusik R.J. Giguere V. Nature. 1994; 367: 480-483Google Scholar), it is also plausible that the sequestering of a small intracellular pool of calreticulin by active integrins could have an effect on the expression of steroid hormone responsive genes and thus have a significant impact on cell growth and differentiation. Alternatively, the interaction between calreticulin and integrin α2β1 may influence other integrin-protein interactions or possibly mediate biochemical events such as calcium fluxes. Because studies showing interactions involving the cytoplasmic domains of integrin α subunits are less well developed than those for the β1 subunit, α subunit cytoplasmic domains have often been considered to be primarily regulatory in their function. One model has the α subunit cytoplasmic domain maintaining the integrin in a low affinity state through the KLGFFKR “hinge” region(11O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Google Scholar), an example of inside-out signaling. Experimental modification of this regulatory function, by removing the GFFKR segment, can result in an activated, high affinity ligand-binding integrin receptor(11O'Toole T.E. Katagiri Y. Faull R.J. Peter K. Tamura R. Quaranta V. Loftus J.C. Shattil S.J. Ginsberg M.H. J. Cell Biol. 1994; 124: 1047-1059Google Scholar). It is reasonable to speculate that there may be physiological interactions between integrin α subunit cytoplasmic domains and intracellular proteins that can cause similar “inside-out” modifications of integrin function through undetermined mechanisms. In support of this there have been several reports of intracellular events which modulate the functional activity of integrin receptors, including phorbol ester stimulation of CHO cells (25Danilov Y.N. Juliano R.L. J. Cell Biol. 1989; 108: 1925-1933Google Scholar) and stimulation of platelets with agonists(24Sims P.J. Ginsberg M.H. Plow E.F. Shattil S.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 7345-7352Google Scholar, 26Shattil S.J. Brugge J.S. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 869-879Google Scholar). However, like the cytoplasmic associations that integrins form as a result of ligand binding, the exact molecular mechanisms by which intracellular events modify integrin function remain mostly unclear. Based on the results presented here, it is possible that calreticulin plays a physiological role in moderating integrin function. As such, calreticulin could be seen as binding to the integrin α subunit, via KXGFFKR, after integrin activation and helping to stabilize the integrin in an activated conformation. As well as a novel mechanism for the regulation of integrin function the data here suggest a novel function for calreticulin. While primarily characterized as a major calcium-binding protein in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum(17Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Google Scholar), recent observations suggest that calreticulin has many functions. In addition to the steroid hormone receptor-binding activity described above, calreticulin has been shown to form a tight complex with flavin-containing mono-oxygenase (27Guan S. Falick A.M. Williams D.E. Cashman J.R. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 9892-9900Google Scholar) and has also been shown to have RNA binding activity(28Singh N.K. Atreya C.D. Nakhasi H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12770-12774Google Scholar). Some, but not all, of these functions for calreticulin involve calreticulin that is not necessarily associated with endoplasmic reticulum membranes. Localization of calreticulin to sites within cells other than the endoplasmic reticulum has been reported previously(13Leung-Hagesteijn C.Y. Milankov K. Michalak M. Wilkins J. Dedhar S. J. Cell Sci. 1994; 107: 589-600Google Scholar, 16Opas M. Dziak E. Fliegel L. Michalak M. J. Cell. Physiol. 1991; 149: 160-171Google Scholar, 17Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Google Scholar), and it is becoming clear that, despite containing a KDEL endoplasmic reticulum retention sequence, the intracellular distribution of calreticulin is not so strictly limited. Other KDEL containing proteins have also been shown to have nonendoplasmic reticulum localizations. These include protein disulfide-isomerase(29Yoshimori T. Semba T. Takemoto H. Akagi S. Yamamoto A. Tashiro Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 15984-15990Google Scholar), endoplasmin (30Takemoto H. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Inoue K. Tashiro Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 129-136Google Scholar) and the heavy chain binding protein (BiP/GRP78)(30Takemoto H. Yoshimori T. Yamamoto A. Miyata Y. Yahara I. Inoue K. Tashiro Y. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 296: 129-136Google Scholar). We have confirmed that the calreticulin which we found associated with α2β1 in the present study is recognized by an anti-KDEL antiserum. 5M. Coppolino and S. Dedhar, unpublished observations. The biochemical mechanisms which govern the cellular distribution of calreticulin as well as those which control the inducible interaction with integrins still remain to be elucidated. It is possible that post-translational modifications to calreticulin are important in determining these cellular activities. With regard to its RNA-binding capacity it has been shown that phosphorylation of calreticulin is necessary for its binding of RNA(28Singh N.K. Atreya C.D. Nakhasi H.L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 12770-12774Google Scholar). We have not determined if the calreticulin that is associated with integrins is phosphorylated, but appropriate studies are under way. Such investigations are interesting in light of the findings presented here involving PMA. Calreticulin does contain a putative site for phosphorylation by protein kinase C (17Michalak M. Milner R.E. Burns K. Opas M. Biochem. J. 1992; 285: 681-692Google Scholar) and it remains to be determined if this site is utilized in vivo. It is possible that activation of protein kinase C results in the stimulation of intracellular signaling pathways involving calreticulin, its phosphorylation and its interaction with other proteins. Some of the associated activities of calreticulin may, in turn, be intimately linked to cell adhesion. We have presented here evidence which suggests that calreticulin, through its interaction with the integrin α2β1, may play a role in the adhesive activities of this integrin. The calreticulin-integrin interaction may facilitate integrin function and/or this interaction may affect downstream consequences of integrin ligation. Presently, investigation of the calreticulin-integrin interaction is ongoing to determine the exact function this association has within cells We thank Dr. Luis Rokeach (University of Montreal) for his kind gift of anti-calreticulin antibodies and Lynda Woodcock and Terrie Walker for preparing the manuscript."

Thus we reasoned that differences in binding requirements in muscle and brain may contribute to tissue specificity of MEF2 function. To test this hypothesis, we have determined the consensus binding site for MEF2 expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain by CASTing (C yclic Amplification and Selection of Targets)(17Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar), a technique that has proven useful to elucidate mechanisms of tissue-specific regulation of gene expression(18Funk W. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9484-9488Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Analysis of these optimal DNA targets revealed brain-specific sequence constraints that might be relevant for MEF2 function. C2C12 skeletal myoblasts (American Type Culture Collection) were grown at subconfluent densities in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum. For myotube formation, cells were grown to 70-80% confluence and then transferred to 2% heat-inactivated horse serum in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium for 4 days. Heart and brain tissues were removed from 16-day-old mouse embryos, rinsed in cold phosphate-buffered saline, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until homogenization. Preparation of whole cell extracts in 10 mM HEPES-KOH, 0.3 M KCl, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA, 10% (w/v) glycerol, 1 μg/ml leupeptin (pH 7.8) was carried out as described previously (19Andrés V. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Development. 1992; 116: 321-334PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentration was determined using the modified Bradford assay (Bio-Rad). The following rabbit polyclonal anti-MEF2 antibodies were used in this study: anti-MEF2A(9Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), anti-MEF2C(7McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C. Yu Y.T. Andrés V. Leifer D. Krainc D. Lipton S.A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell.

Development. 1993; 118: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Their specificity for the corresponding MEF2 isoforms has been demonstrated by Western immunoblot and indirect immunofluorescence analyses on COS cells transiently transfected with MEF2 expression vectors. For electrophoretic mobility shift assays, a double-stranded synthetic oligonucleotide containing a canonical MEF2-binding site (5′-TCGGACTGTTACTAAAAATAGCACACCTG-3′, MEF2 site underlined) was end-labeled with T4 polynucleotide kinase. Whole cell extracts (10-20 μg of protein) were preincubated for 5 min at room temperature with 50 μg/ml of each poly(dI-dC) and unrelated single-stranded oligonucleotide in binding buffer (20 mM HEPES-KOH, 0.1 M KCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.2 mM EDTA, 20% (w/v) glycerol, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (pH 7.8)). Then, 10 fmol of probe, simultaneously with preimmune or immune serum where indicated, was added for a final reaction volume of 20 μl. Incubation was continued for 20 min at 37°C, and the samples were electrophoresed at 4°C in 4% native polyacrylamide gels (80:1, acrylamide/bisacrylamide ratio) in 0.5 × TBE (0.045 M Tris borate, 0.001 M EDTA (pH 7.5)). Gels were dried and exposed to x-ray film. The procedure for CASTing was essentially as described previously(18Funk W. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9484-9488Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar, 20Andrés V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). In brief, 15 μg of a double-stranded oligonucleotide containing a degenerate core of 40 base pairs flanked by defined sequences with restriction sites (5′-GC-SalI-HindIII-XbaI-N40-EcoRI-BamHI-XhoI-CG-3′) was incubated with whole cell extract and 5 μg of sonicated calf thymus DNA in 20 μl of binding buffer (see above). After 20 min at room temperature, the reaction was brought to 0.45 ml with binding buffer, and 10 μl of magnetic beads (Dynal Inc.) saturated with affinity-purified anti-MEF2A antibody were added (0.1 mg of IgG/10 mg of beads). After rocking for 1 h at room temperature, the MEF2A-DNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using a magnet against the side of the microcentrifuge tube. After three washes with 0.5% Nonidet P-40 in binding buffer, DNA was eluted from the beads and PCR-amplified as described previously(20Andrés V. Chiara M.D. Mahdavi V. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 245-257Crossref PubMed Scopus (96) Google Scholar). The amplified oligonucleotides were subjected to a new cycle of selection/amplification with fresh cell extracts in the presence of 5 μg of sonicated calf thymus DNA. After a total of nine cycles of selection/amplification, the PCR products were digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into similarly digested pBluescript II KS+ (Stratagene). Individual clones were sequenced using universal M13 primers and an automatic DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 370A). To characterize the MEF2 DNA binding activities present in muscle and brain, we performed electrophoretic mobility supershift assays with a radiolabeled MEF2 oligonucleotide and polyclonal antibodies specific for MEF2A(9Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V. Science. 1994; 266: 1236-1240Crossref PubMed Scopus (196) Google Scholar), MEF2C(7McDermott J.C. Cardoso M.C. Yu Y.T. Andrés V. Leifer D. Krainc D. Lipton S.A. Nadal-Ginard B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1993; 13: 2564-2577Crossref PubMed Scopus (198) Google Scholar), and MEF2D(5Breitbart R.E. Liang C.S. Smoot L.B. Laheru D.A. Mahdavi V. Nadal-Ginard B. Development. 1993; 118: 1095-1106Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Whereas preimmune sera had no effect in these assays, anti-MEF2A antibodies quantitatively supershifted the nucleoprotein complexes detected in extracts from C2C12 myotubes (skeletal muscle) and embryonic heart and brain (Fig. 1). In contrast, anti-MEF2C and anti-MEF2D antibodies only partially supershifted these complexes. Given that MEF2 proteins are assembled in homo- and heterodimers(3Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 10Martin J.F. Miano J.M. Hustad C.M. Copeland N.G. Jenkins N.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1647-1656Crossref PubMed Scopus (186) Google Scholar, 16Gossett L.A. Kelvin D.J. Sternberg E.A. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 5022-5033Crossref PubMed Scopus (446) Google Scholar), the results of these supershift assays suggest that MEF2A-containing complexes are predominant in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain. We next sought to determine the optimal targets for MEF2 in muscle and brain tissues using the CASTing technique(17Wright W.E. Binder M. Funk W. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4104-4110Crossref PubMed Scopus (230) Google Scholar). MEF2 optimal binding sites were selected from a pool of oligonucleotides containing a degenerate core using crude cell extracts and anti-MEF2 antibodies to isolate the specific MEF2-DNA complexes. The selected sequences were then PCR-amplified and mixed with fresh extract, and the process was repeated eight times to enrich for optimal binding sites. Finally, the selected sequences were cloned and individual clones were sequenced. Since MEF2A appears to be the major MEF2 DNA binding activity in these tissues (Fig. 1), anti-MEF2A antibodies were used in this study. However, this procedure should enable the isolation of MEF2-DNA complexes involving both MEF2A homodimers and MEF2A-containing heterodimers. Fig. 2shows the sequence of individual oligonucleotides selected with skeletal muscle, heart, and brain extracts, which were aligned by the A/T-rich motif they contained and grouped according to the sequence of the central quartet of A/T bases. An analysis of the relative frequency of bases at each position generated the MEF2 consensus binding site shown in Fig. 3. The three tissues analyzed show an indistinguishable core motif, 5′-CT(A/t)(a/t)AAATAG-3′ (positions 1-10), which conforms to previously identified MEF2 sites contained within skeletal and cardiac muscle-specific control regions that have been shown to be important for expression of the corresponding genes(15Cserjesi P. Olson E.N. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 4854-4862Crossref PubMed Scopus (200) Google Scholar). For example, the majority of oligonucleotides bearing the central quartet TAAA (Fig. 2) conform to the MEF2 site found in the regulatory regions of the muscle-specific genes desmin, AMP deaminase, and Xenopus MyoD (5′-CTATAAATA(G/C)-3′)(15Cserjesi P.

Biol. 1994; 14: 686-699Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Furthermore, some selected oligonucleotides correspond to the recently identified MEF2 site in the gax homeobox gene (C144c, C10, C53b, and rC133; Fig. 2A)(22Andrés V. Fisher S. Wearsch P. Walsh K. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 4272-4281Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar).Figure 2:Sequence alignment of the selected MEF2-binding sites recovered after CASTing in skeletal muscle (A), heart (B), and brain (C). Preparation of extracts was as in Fig. 1. The number of sequences reported in each CASTing experiment is indicated (N).

The MEF2 consensus binding sites were derived from the base frequencies of the selected sequences shown in Fig. 2. Highly constrained bases (>60%) are shown in uppercase. The 10-base pair MEF2 core binding site is boldface (positions 1-10). The number of sequences analyzed in each case is indicated (N). Note that the bases immediately flanking the MEF2 core motif are highly constrained in brain but appear randomly selected in skeletal and cardiac muscle (positions −5 to −1 and 1 to 2). See text for details.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) The MEF2 consensus binding site reported here also conforms to the optimal MEF2 target determined previously employing truncated derivatives of cloned RSRFR2 (MEF2B), RSRFC4 (MEF2A), and SL1 (Xenopus MEF2D)(3Pollock R. Treisman R. Genes & Dev. 1991; 5: 2327-2341Crossref PubMed Scopus (323) Google Scholar, 23Chambers A.E. Kotecha S. Towers N. Mohun T.J. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 4981-4991Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar). However, the present study using crude extracts as a source for MEF2 reveals a preference for the sequence AAAA (TTTT) at the central quartet of bases within the MEF2 consensus (52, 49, and 68% in skeletal muscle, heart, and brain, respectively; Fig. 2). In contrast, the preferred quartet using cloned proteins is TAAA (TTTA; 34, 47, and 35% for RSRFR2, RSRFC4, and SL1, respectively), with only 20-22% of the selected oligonucleotides containing the sequence AAAA. These differences might be due to the use of different MEF2 isoforms and/or truncated proteins in these previous studies. Formation of MEF2 heterodimeric complexes and/or complexes containing MEF2 and other regulatory proteins in crude extracts, which are unlikely to be present in the preparations of cloned MEF2 proteins, could also account for these differences. The optimal target for MEF2 expressed in the brain shows sequence constraints in the bases flanking the MEF2 core motif that are not observed in skeletal and cardiac muscle (Fig. 3, positions −5 to −1 and 1 to 2). Whereas 50% of the oligonucleotides selected with brain extracts contain the sequence TGTT at positions −5 to −2 and A(A/T) at 1 to 2, only 3% of the oligonucleotides selected with skeletal and cardiac muscle show these sequence constraints. These observations are intriguing, and several potential explanations may be considered. The complex pattern of alternative splicing of MEF2 transcripts (3Pollock R. Treisman R.

In this respect, expression of brain-specific MEF2C isoforms (6Leifer D. Krainc D. Yu Y.T. McDermott J. Breitbart R.E. Heng J. Neve R.L. Kosofsky B. Nadal-Ginard B. Lipton S.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci.

CASTing would also enable the identification of extended binding requirements resulting from the cooperative interaction of MEF2 with a brain-specific regulatory protein. This protein could either modify the DNA binding specificity of MEF2 or bind itself to DNA, thus contributing to the extended binding preferences detected in brain. Similar types of interactions have been previously suggested by CASTing for myogenin, which allowed the coselection of binding sites for myogenin and nuclear factor 1, MEF2, and COMP1 in crude myotube extracts(18Funk W. Wright W.E. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 9484-9488Crossref PubMed Scopus (83) Google Scholar). Recently, cooperative interactions of MEF2A with MyoD and myogenin have been demonstrated in skeletal muscle cells(9Kaushal S. Schneider J.W. Nadal-Ginard B. Mahdavi V.

In summary, we have identified sequence constraints in the optimal targets for MEF2 expressed in the brain that are not observed in skeletal and cardiac muscle. Thus, differences in the DNA binding specificities of MEF2 proteins might be a mechanism by which these factors differentially regulate gene expression during myogenesis and neurogenesis. Elucidation of the molecular basis for these tissue-specific binding preferences should reveal important clues to understand the role of MEF2 in the production of muscle and neuronal phenotypes We thank Tom O'Keefe and Stuart Yang for DNA sequencing and Lawrence Weir, Woodring E.

Cancer Res. 1993; 60: 1-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (1178) Google Scholar, 8Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Each of these contain two or three extracellular immunoglobulin-like loops, a characteristic stretch of acidic amino acids between the first and second loop, a single transmembrane region, and an intracellular kinase domain split by a 14-17-amino acid kinase insert. Alternative splicing generates a multitude of structural variants that differ in ectodomain regions known to be involved in ligand binding(8Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Dionne C.A. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1992; 1135: 185-199Crossref PubMed Scopus (597) Google Scholar). Autophosphorylated tyrosine residues and adjacent amino acids provide specific binding sites for signal transducing proteins containing Src homology 2 (SH2) domains(9Koch C.A. Anderson D. Moran M.F. Ellis C. Pawson T. Science. 1991; 252: 668-674Crossref PubMed Scopus (1444) Google Scholar). Recruitment of signal-transducing molecules to activated tyrosine kinase receptors triggers signaling pathways, which eventually result in specific cellular responses. This far, two intracellular autophosphorylation sites have been identified in the FGFR-1, at Tyr653 and Tyr766, located in the kinase domain and the C-terminal tail, respectively(10Hou J. McKeehan K. Kan M. Carr S.A. Huddleston M.J. Crabb J.W. McKeehan W.L. Protein Sci. 1993; 2: 86-92Crossref PubMed Scopus (39) Google Scholar). Whereas it is possible that Tyr653 is involved in regulation of kinase activity, phosphorylated Tyr766 has been shown to provide a binding site for phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ)(11Mohammadi M. Honegger A.M. Rotin D. Fischer R. Bellot F. Li W. Dionne C.A. Jaye M. Rubinstein M. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5068-5078Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). The Y766F mutant FGFR-1 has been shown to be internalized at a decreased rate in transfected rat myoblasts(12Sorokin A. Mohammadi M. Huang J. Schlessinger J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 17056-17061Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but still mediates a mitogenic signal (13Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J. Del Rosario M. Mirda D.

Lax I. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 14419-14423Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Thus the role of PLC-γ in FGFR-1 signaling is not well understood; however, PLC-γ-mediated activation of PKC in FGF-stimulated cells could play a negative regulatory role, i.e. in Src-dependent downstream signaling(16Landgren E. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Oncogene. 1995; 10: 2027-2035PubMed Google Scholar). A number of other signal transduction molecules have been shown not to interact with or be affected by the activated FGFR-1. These include phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase (17Wennström S. Landgren E. Blume-Jensen P. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13749-13756Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and RasGAP(18Molloy C.J. Bottaro D.P. Fleming T.P. Marshall M.S. Gibbs J.B. Aaronson S.A. Nature. 1989; 342: 711-714Crossref PubMed Scopus (263) Google Scholar). Activation of FGFR-1 leads to a potent mitogenic signal. Conversion of the Ras protein from its inactive GDP-bound state to its active GTP-bound state appears to be a key event in intracellular signaling from several activated tyrosine kinase receptors to the nucleus. The small adaptor proteins Grb2 and Shc provide a link between growth factor receptors and Ras, via the nucleotide exchange factor Sos. Grb2 has been shown to interact directly with growth factor receptors, but also indirectly, via Shc or the tyrosine phosphatase PTP1D/Syp(19Pawson T. Nature. 1995; 373: 573-580Crossref PubMed Scopus (2234) Google Scholar). A number of other proteins are described to interact with the Grb2 SH2 domain, such as BCR-ABL(20Pendergast A.M. Quilliam L.A. Cripe L.D. Bassing C.H. Dai Z. Li N. Batzer A. Rabun K.M. Der C.J. Schlessinger J. Gishizky M.L.

Nature. 1994; 372: 786-791Crossref PubMed Scopus (1448) Google Scholar), and a novel 36-38-kDa protein in T-lymphocytes(22Sieh M. Batzer A. Schlessinger J. Weiss A. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 4435-4442Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In this work we have characterized coupling of FGFR-1 to Ras via Grb2 and Shc. Whereas Grb2 did not interact directly with the FGFR-1, an indirect interaction via the adaptor protein Shc was evident. In addition, a separate pool of Grb2 was in complex with a tyrosine-phosphorylated component of 89 kDa in FGF-2 stimulated cells. We propose a role for this novel component in FGFR-1-mediated Ras activation. Rat L6 myoblasts were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 units/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin. The wild type and mutated FGFR-1 were expressed in L6 cells after insertion of the cDNA into the expression vector pcDNA I/neo (Invitrogen), and transfection followed by selection with geneticin G418 sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc.). For serum starvation, subconfluent cells were incubated in medium containing 1% fetal calf serum for 18 h. FGF-2 was purchased from Farmitalia Carlo Erba, Milano, Italy. Platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB) was a kind gift from Dr. C.-H. Heldin, and epidermal growth factor (EGF) was a kind gift from Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA. FGF-2, PDGF-BB, and EGF treatment was done by incubation with 100 ng/ml growth factor for 10 min at 37°C. The LIBE cell line is a capillary endothelial cell line established from H-2Kb-tsA58 mouse brain and which exhibits temperature-sensitive features. 2S. Kanda, E. Landgren, M. Ljungström, and L. Claesson-Welsh, submitted for publication. The LIBE cells are highly differentiated at both permissive and nonpermissive conditions. A synthetic peptide based on the 16 C-terminal amino acids of the human FGFR-1 sequence was used for immunization of rabbits. Rabbit antibodies against glutathione S-transferase (GST) were raised through immunization with purified GST. Polyclonal antibodies against Sos and Syp were purchased from Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., as were polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies against Grb2. Antibodies specific for phosphotyrosine (PY20) and Shc were from Transduction Laboratories, and a polyclonal antibody against Raf1 was from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. The rabbit antiserum against PLC-γ was a kind gift from Dr G. Carpenter, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN. Following stimulation, culture medium was removed and cells rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 100 μM Na3VO4. Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Nonidet P-40, 100 μM Na3VO4, 1% aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 1 mM dithiothreitol) was added and cells lysed for 10 min on ice before beeing scraped and transferred to Eppendorf tubes. Dithiothreitol was excluded from the lysis buffer when the experiment was done under nonreducing conditions. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation. Supernatants were transferred to new tubes and antibody was added. The samples were mixed end-over-end at 4°C for 2 h before addition of protein A-Sepharose (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) and a final 45-min mixing. The precipitates were washed twice in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and two times in PBS containing 100 μM Na3VO4. The samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis before electroblotting to Hybond-C extra membranes (Amersham). The SH2 domain of Grb2 was expressed as a part of a GST fusion protein (23Lowenstein E.J. Daly R.J. Batzer A.G. Li W. Margolis B. Lammers R. Ullrich A. Skolnick E.Y. Bar-Sagi D. Schlessinger J. Cell. 1992; 70: 431-442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1348) Google Scholar) and was a kind gift of Dr. J. Schlessinger, New York University Medical Center, New York. For control experiments, GST alone was expressed from plasmid pGEX-3X. Transfected L6 cells or LIBE cells were treated with or without growth factor and then lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Clarified lysates were incubated with purified immobilized GST or GST-Grb2 SH2 fusion protein on glutathione Sepharose 4B (Pharmacia) (60-μl bead volume with 6 μg of bound fusion protein) end-over-end for 2 h at 4°C. For peptide competition experiments, peptides at a final concentration of 50 μM were incubated with the lysates for 45 min before addition of fusion protein beads. Samples were washed as described above and analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting. The amino acid sequences of the synthetic peptides used in this study, either nonphosphorylated or phosphorylated on tyrosine (indicated as Y(P)), are as follows: from FGFR-1, GVSEY(463)ELPEDPRWELPR; PPGLEY(583)CY(585)NPSHNPE; LTSNQEY(766)LDLSMPLD; LDQY(776)SPSFPDTRSS and from PDGFR-β, LQHHSDKRRPPSAELY(716)SNALPVG. Peptides were synthesized using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) chemistry, followed by plasma desorption mass spectrometric analysis as described before(24Mori S. Rönnstrand L. Yokote K. Engström Å. Courtneidge S.A. Claesson-Welsh L. Heldin C.-H. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 2257-2264Crossref PubMed Scopus (294) Google Scholar). The tyrosine-phosphorylated EGFR peptide comprising Tyr1068 (PVPEY(1068)INQSVPK) was a kind gift from Dr. J. Downward, Signal Transduction Laboratory, Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom. The synthetic peptides were coupled to AH Sepharose (Pharmacia) mainly according to the manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, the powdered AH Sepharose was suspended and washed in 0.5 M NaCl and then equlibrated in H2O, pH 4.5. The peptides were dissolved in H2O, pH 4.5, and added to the beads, whereafter N-ethyl-N‘-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride was added. During vigorous mixing for 1 h, the pH was maintained at 4.5-6.0. The coupling reaction continued overnight, end-over-end at 4°C. Excess groups were blocked by incubating the beads with 1 M acetic acid. The beads were then washed with 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.5 M NaCl, and 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 4.0, 0.5 M NaCl alternatively, three times each, before beeing equilibrated in Triton X-100 buffer (1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 1% aprotinin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 14.4 mM β-mercaptoethanol in PBS). 5 μg of fusion protein was incubated end-over-end with 0.125 μmol of receptor peptide/100-μl beads for 2 h at 4°C. After washing the beads seven times in Triton X-100 buffer, the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and subsequent electroblotting to Hybond-C extra membranes. The membranes were blocked overnight at 4°C in PBS-T (0.2% Tween 20 in PBS) containing 5% bovine serum albumin. Primary antibodies were diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin and incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature. After four 15-min washes in PBS-T, the membranes were incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody diluted in PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 3% bovine serum albumin. After several 10-min washes in PBS-T, the bands were visualized by a chemiluminescent detection system based on a protocol described by Matthews et al.(25Matthews J.A. Batki A. Hynds C. Kricka L.J. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 151: 205-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (128) Google Scholar). Before reprobing the filters, they were stripped in 62.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.7, 2% SDS containing 100 mM β-mercaptoethanol at 50°C for 30 min. After growth factor treatment, the cells were washed two times with ice-cold PBS containing 100 μM Na3VO4 before beeing scraped and pelleted in PBS at 1000 rpm. The cells were resuspended in a small volume of PBS and homogenized 20 times using a Wheaton tissue grinder. The nuclear fraction was pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 10 s. The supernatant was centrifuged at 160,000 × g in an Airfuge (Beckman) to pellet the membrane fraction. The cytosolic and membrane fractions were adjusted to the same volume with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer before incubation with 6 μg of GST-Grb2 SH2 fusion protein/60-μl beads as described above. Stimulated and nonstimulated cells from T-75 tissue culture flasks were lysed in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer. Cleared lysates were incubated with 1.5 μg of Raf1 antiserum for 2 h before incubation with protein A-Sepharose for 45 min. Sepharose beads with immunoprecipitated Raf-1 proteins were washed three times in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and once in kinase buffer (30 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl2, and 1 mM dithiothreitol). The beads were resuspended in 30 μl of kinase buffer supplemented with 2 mM ATP, 5 μCi of [γ-32P]ATP (Amersham Corp.), and 0.3 μg of recombinant, baculovirus-expressed catalytically inactive MEK B kindly provided by Dr. S. Macdonald, Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Richmond, CA. Kinase reactions were performed for 30 min at 30°C, and the samples were subsequently separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and analyzed using a PhosphorImager (Molecular Dynamics). Cells were inoculated into 24-well plates at a density of 1.5 × 104 cells/cm2 in medium containing 10% fetal calf serum. The next day, the medium was removed, and fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum was added and the culture continued for another 24 h. At this point, fresh medium containing 0.5% fetal calf serum and different concentrations of growth factor (FGF-2) was added. The cells were incubated for 20 h and then 1 μCi/ml [125I]iododeoxyuridine was added and incubation continued for 4 h. After aspiration of medium, cells were fixed in 10% trichloroacetic acid and lysed with 1 M NaOH. Incorporation of 125I-labeled deoxyuridine into DNA was measured using a γ spectrometer. We were interested in identifying mechanisms for coupling of FGFR-1 to Grb2. We could find no indication for binding of a GST fusion protein comprising the Grb2 SH2 domain to the intact receptor (Fig. 1), in an immunoblotting analysis of FGF-2 stimulated FGFR-1 expressing L6 myoblasts. This is in agreement with the lack of the known consensus binding site for Grb2, Y(P)-X-N(26Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar), in the FGFR-1 amino acid sequence. Since direct binding of Grb2 to the intact FGFR-1 did not occur at detectable levels, we investigated the possibilities for indirect interactions. The SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase PTP1D/Syp has been described to mediate indirect interaction between Grb2 and the PDGF β-receptor(27Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We failed, however, to detect association in vitro and in vivo between the activated FGFR-1 and Syp or tyrosine phosphorylation of Syp in response to FGF-2 (data not shown; see Fig. 8).Figure 8:FGF-2, but not EGF or PDGF-BB, stimulates association of tyrosine-phosphorylated p89 to Grb2 SH2. Murine brain endothelial cells expressing endogenous receptors for FGF-2, EGF, and PDGF-BB were incubated with 100 ng/ml growth factor for 10 min, lysed, and precipitated with Grb2 SH2 fusion protein bound to glutathione-Sepharose. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with Tyr(P) antibody. Ip, immunoprecipitation; Ib, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) In contrast, Shc, which is known to anchor Grb2 to receptor tyrosine kinases, was tyrosine-phosphorylated in response to FGF-2 treatment of FGFR-1 expressing L6 myoblasts (Fig. 2A). In L6 cells expressing a mutant FGFR-1, Y766F, Shc was still phosphorylated, although to a lesser extent. The reduction in extent of phosphorylation of Shc was not due to impaired kinase activity of the mutant, as compared with the wild type receptor (Fig. 2B). Analysis of Shc SH2 domain fusion protein interactions in vitro with immobilized FGFR-1 synthetic peptides, phosphorylated or not, showed that the peptide containing phosphorylated Tyr766 provided the most efficient binding site (Fig. 2C). The mitogenic signaling capacities of the wild type FGFR-1, the mutant Y766F, and in addition, the mutant Y463F, were compared. The incorporation of 125I-labeled deoxyuridine in serum-starved, FGF-2-stimulated L6 cells expressing wild type or mutant (Y463F or Y766F) receptors showed that both mutants were less efficient in stimulating DNA synthesis (Fig. 2D). Thus, although Tyr766 appears to be involved in coupling FGFR-1 to mitogenic signal transduction, other pathways for mitogenicity must exist, depending e.g. on Tyr463 for their initiation. We were, furthermore, not able to demonstrate direct interaction between the receptor and Shc in vivo (Fig. 3A). Immunoprecipitation using Shc antiserum followed by immunoblotting using phosphotyrosine antibody showed instead that Shc associated with a tyrosine-phosphorylated 145-kDa component after FGF-2 stimulation (Fig. 3B). This component was not recognized by antisera against the receptor, Sos, or PLC-γ (data not shown) and may correspond to the 145-kDa component described by Kavanaugh and Williams(28Kavanaugh W.M. Williams L.T. Science. 1994; 266: 1862-1865Crossref PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar).Figure 3:Analysis of Shc complex formation in vivo. L6 cells expressing wild type FGFR-1 were incubated in the presence (+) or absence(-) of 100 ng/ml FGF-2 for 10 min, lysed, and immunoprecipitated with Shc or FGFR-1 antiserum. Samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with FGFR-1 antiserum (A) and Tyr(P) antibody (B). Ip, immunoprecipitation; Ib, immunoblotting.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Although we failed to identify in vivo interactions between FGFR-1 and Shc, tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc was able to bind Grb2 in vivo in FGF-2 stimulated L6 cells expressing wild type FGFR-1 or the mutants Y463F and Y766F (Fig. 4A). As expected, Grb2 was found in constitutive complex with the nucleotide exchange factor Sos (Fig. 4B)(29Rozakis-Adcock M. Fernley R. Wade J. Pawson T. Bowtell D. Nature. 1993; 363: 83-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (841) Google Scholar). We could also identify in vivo complex formation between Shc and Sos (Fig. 4C), which in contrast was dependent on FGF-2 stimulation. That FGF-2 stimulation initiated signal transduction leading to activation of Ras, and further to activation of the serine/threonine kinase Raf1, was shown by in vitro phosphorylation of kinase-inactivated MEK, which was mediated to similar extents by the wild type and mutant receptors (Fig. 4D). MEK in turn activates MAPK(30Kosako H. Nishida E. Gotoh Y. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 787-794Crossref PubMed Scopus (121) Google Scholar). The reduced mobility of Sos after FGF-2 stimulation (Fig. 4E), could be due to MAPK-catalyzed phosphorylation of Sos on serine and threonine residues. A main role of activated MAPK appears, however, to be to further transduce the Ras activity signal to the nuclear compartment(31Seth A. Gonzalez F.A. Gupta S. Raden D.L. Davis R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 24796-24804Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To identify other possible routes for signal transduction between FGFR-1 and Ras, we analyzed components interacting with Grb2 in vivo by immunoprecipitation using Grb2 antiserum, followed by immunoblotting using phosphotyrosine antibody. As expected (see Fig. 1) we could not detect a band corresponding to FGFR-1 in this analysis. On the other hand, an 89-kDa component was found to be tyrosine-phosphorylated and in complex with Grb2 after FGF-2 stimulation of FGFR-1 expressing L6 cells (Fig. 5A). In a time course analysis, the peak of phosphorylation of the 89-kDa component occurred at 30 min of stimulation, followed by a sustained phase that lasted for several hours (Fig. 5A). At 30 min, but not at later time points, an intense band corresponding to p52shc, was also detected. The 89-kDa component was retained after FGF-2 stimulation by the Grb2 SH2 fusion protein coupled to glutathione-Sepharose (Fig. 5B). This interaction was specific, since no binding was seen to GST alone. The 89-kDa component was visualized as a doublet in Tyr(P) immunoblots, perhaps due to heterogeneity in phosphotyrosine content. The migration rate of p89 was not dependent on whether the samples were treated with reducing agent, or not, before electrophoresis (data not shown). In a competition experiment, using a panel of synthetic peptides, none of the five FGFR-1 peptides competed appreciably with the 89-kDa component for binding to Grb2 SH2 fusion protein (Fig. 6A). A peptide corresponding to the known Grb2 binding site in the EGF receptor, Y(P)1068(26Songyang Z. Shoelson S.E. Chaudhuri M. Gish G. Pawson T. Haser W.G. King F. Roberts T. Ratnofsky S. Lechleider R.J. Neel B.G. Birge R.B. Fajardo J.E. Chou M.M. Hanafusa H. Schaffhausen B. Cantley L.C. Cell. 1993; 72: 767-778Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2391) Google Scholar), abolished binding of the 89-kDa component to the Grb2 SH2 fusion protein. Two other components binding to Grb2 SH2, which in subsequent immunoblotting were shown to correspond to p52shc and p66shc, were also specifically competed out by the EGFR Y(P)1068 peptide. In addition, this peptide abolished the binding of a 40-kDa component to Grb2 SH2. These data show that an 89-kDa component binds Grb2 SH2 in vivo and in vitro by exposing a Grb2 consensus binding site Y(P)-X-N, in which the tyrosine residue is phosphorylated in response to FGF-2 stimulation. In a “far-Western” analysis, the Grb2 SH2 fusion protein bound to the 89-kDa component immobilized on a nitrocellulose filter, indicative of a direct interaction between the two proteins (Fig. 6B). It is possible that there is also direct interaction between FGFR-1 and the 89-kDa component. Several tyrosine-phosphorylated components of this size are found in complex with the receptor (Fig. 6C). However, multimeric complexes containing the FGFR-1, the 89-kDa component, and Grb2 could not be demonstrated (see Fig. 5A). To determine the subcellular localization of p89, cells were divided into membrane and cytosolic fractions, which were solubilized, reacted with Grb2 SH2 fusion protein, and samples analyzed by phosphotyrosine antibody immunoblotting. The tyrosine-phosphorylated 89-kDa component was located exclusively in the membrane fraction after FGF-2 treatment (Fig. 7A). The Shc proteins on the other hand were predominantly located in the cytoplasm of FGF-2-stimulated cells, as determined by subsequent immunoblotting using Shc antiserum. The membrane fraction contained, in addition to the 89-kDa component, the 40-kDa component, which was shown above to bind to the Grb SH2 fusion protein (compare Fig. 6A). Ras is anchored in the plasma membrane, and it has been suggested that translocation of Sos to this compartment allows a more efficient stimulation of nucleotide exchange on Ras(32Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). We therefore examined complex formation between p89 and Sos and found that FGF-2 stimulation allowed this interaction to occur (Fig. 7B). We compared different growth factors for their capacity to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of the 89-kDa, Grb2 SH2-binding component. For this purpose, we used murine brain endothelial cells that endogenously express receptors for EGF, PDGF-BB, and FGF-2. As seen in Fig. 8A, Grb2 SH2 bound the 89-kDa component only after FGF-2 stimulation, but not after stimulation with EGF or PDGF-BB. In the PDGF-BB-stimulated sample, a component corresponding to PTP1D/Syp was retained by the Grb2 SH2 fusion protein. Immunoblotting with Syp antiserum failed to reveal binding of Syp to Grb2 SH2 in the FGF-2- or EGF-stimulated samples. In addition, tyrosine-phosphorylated p52shc was bound to Grb2 SH2, irrespective of which stimulus was used and also to some extent before growth factor stimulation. These data show that tyrosine phosphorylation of the 89-kDa protein, and hence binding to Grb2 SH2, was specific for FGF-2 stimulation. In this work, we have characterized proteins interacting with Grb2 in FGF-2-stimulated cells. Growth factor receptors are thought to couple to Ras via Grb2 in several ways; directly, by binding of the Grb2 SH2 domain to a specific motif in the receptor, or indirectly, via binding to different adaptor proteins. Thus far, two such adaptor molecules have been thoroughly characterized, Shc (33Pelicci G. Lanfrancone L. Grignani F. McGlade J. Cavallo F. Forni G. Nicoletti I. Grignani F. Pawson T. Pelicci P.G. Cell. 1992; 70: 93-104Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1140) Google Scholar) and PTP 1D/Syp (27Li W. Nishimura R. Kashishian A. Batzer A.G. Kim W.J.H. Cooper J.A. Schlessinger J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 509-517Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We could not detect direct interaction between FGFR-1 and Grb2, which is consistent with the lack of consensus binding site for Grb2, Y(P)-X-N, in the FGFR-1 sequence(34Wennström S. Sandström C. Claesson-Welsh L. Growth Factors. 1991; 4: 197-208Crossref PubMed Scopus (32) Google Scholar). We further showed that PTP 1D/Syp is not tyrosine-phosporylated in FGF-2-stimulated cells. PTP 1D/Syp is in complex with and tyrosine phosphorylated by the PDGF β-receptor in response to PDGF-BB, but this seems to be of consequence for Ras activation only in certain cell types(35Arvidsson A.-K. Rupp E. Nånberg E. Downward J. Rönnstrand L. Wennström S. Schlessinger J. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 6715-6726Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In agreement with previous reports, we detected tyrosine-phosphorylated Shc proteins in FGF-2-stimulated FGFR-1-expressing cells(15Spivak-Kroizman T. Mohammadi M. Hu P. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Lax I.

We failed to identify in vivo complex formation between the FGFR-1 and Shc, but tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc proteins was to some extent dependent on Tyr766 in FGFR-1. This is the only known binding site in the receptor for SH2 domain-containing proteins, and it is required for binding of phospholipase Cγ(13Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J.

Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). The sequence surrounding Tyr766 is compatible with the known consensus sequence for Shc binding (Y-hydrophobic-X-hydrophobic) in the PDGF β-receptor(38Yokote K. Mori S. Hansen K. McGlade J. Pawson T. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15337-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A mutant FGFR-1 in which Tyr766 was changed to Phe still mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, indicating that also other sites in the receptor are important or that association of Shc with the receptor is not required for this adaptor protein to become phosphorylated. Binding of Shc to the PDGF β-receptor has been shown to involve several autophosphorylated tyrosine residues, which bind Shc with low affinity(38Yokote K. Mori S. Hansen K. McGlade J. Pawson T. Heldin C.-H. Claesson-Welsh L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 15337-15343Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc in response to EGF is largely independent of individual autophosphorylation sites and occurs even when several or all autophosphorylation sites have been removed from the receptor(39Gotoh N. Tojo A. Muroya K. Hashimoto Y. Hattori S. Nakamura S. Takenawa T. Yazaki Y. Shibuya M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 167-171Crossref PubMed Scopus (109) Google Scholar, 40Soler C. Alvarez C.V. Beguinot L. Carpenter G. Oncogene. 1994; 9: 2207-2215PubMed Google Scholar). Recent data indicate that Shc is critically involved in Ras activation(41Pronk G.J. de Vries-Smits A.M.M. Buday L. Downward J. Maassen J.A. Medema R.H. Bos J.L. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1994; 14: 1575-1581Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), although a function for Shc in other pathways cannot be excluded. The Y766F mutant FGFR-1 expressed in L6 myoblasts was indeed less efficient in mediating a mitogenic signal. This could be due to impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc, but also to the lack of binding and activation of PLC-γ in cells expressing the Y766F receptor. The role of PLC-γ in mitogenic signaling is unclear, and previous reports have shown intact mitogenic capacity of the Y766F mutant receptor(13Peters K.G. Marie J. Wilson E. Ives H.E. Escobedo J. Del Rosario M. Mirda D. Williams L.T. Nature. 1992; 358: 678-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (307) Google Scholar, 14Mohammadi M. Dionne C.A. Li W. Li N. Spivak T. Honegger A.M. Jaye M. Schlessinger J. Nature. 1992; 358: 681-684Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar). That several parallel pathways for mitogenicity exists is indicated by the fact that an Y463F mutant FGFR-1, expressed in L6 cells, also was impaired in mitogenic signaling (see Fig. 2D). In two different cell types, L6 myoblasts expressing FGFR-1 after transfection, and murine brain endothelial cells, we found in vivo complexes containing Grb2 and an 89-kDa protein. This protein was tyrosine-phosphorylated after FGF-2 stimulation, but not after EGF or PDGF-BB stimulation. Tyrosine phosphorylation apparently creates a consensus binding site for Grb2 SH2, which, as shown by far-Western analysis, allowed direct complex formation between the 89-kDa component and Grb2. Interestingly, cell fractionation showed that the 89-kDa component was localized exclusively in the membrane fraction in FGF-2-stimulated cells, whereas Shc proteins remained in the cytoplasm. Ras activation has been shown to depend on translocation of the Grb2-Sos complex to the plasma membrane, to allow interaction with Ras (32Aronheim A. Engelberg D. Li N. Al-Alawi N. Schlessinger J. Karin M. Cell. 1994; 78: 949-961Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (425) Google Scholar). A role for the 89-kDa component in Ras activation was indicated by the presence of 89-kDa protein-Sos complexes in vivo in FGF-stimulated cells. This pool appeared to be separate from the Shc-Grb2-Sos complexes, since we failed to detect the 89-kDa component in Shc immunoprecipitations. Fig. 9shows schematically the composition of the different Grb2-containing complexes in FGF-stimulated cells. We also detected another tyrosine-phosphorylated protein of 40 kDa interacting with Grb2 SH2 in FGF-2-stimulated cells. This far, we have only been able to visualize the 40-kDa component in vitro. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the 89-kDa component was seen immediately in response to FGF-2 and remained in FGF-2-stimulated cells for several hours. The fact that the 89-kDa molecule is tyrosine-phosphorylated rapidly after FGF-2 stimulation argues that it is phosphorylated directly by the receptor. Whether the phosphorylation involves complex formation with the receptor is presently not clear. Tyrosine phosphorylation of 80-90-kDa proteins in FGF-2-stimulated cells has been described previously(42Zhan X. Hu X. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9611-9620Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 43Coughlin S.R. Barr P.J. Cousens L.S. Fretto L.J. Williams L.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 988-993Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). One of these proteins has been identified as cortactin, a cytoskeleton-associated protein(44Zhan X. Hu X. Hampton B. Burgess W.H. Friesel R. Maciag T. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 24427-24431Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We do not believe that the 89-kDa component described here corresponds to cortactin or to other known signal transduction molecules. Thus, cortactin lacks a potential Grb2 binding site(45Wu H. Reynolds A.B. Kanner S.B. Vines R.R. Parsons J.T. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1991; 11: 5113-5124Crossref PubMed Scopus (375) Google Scholar). Furthermore, as shown by immunoblotting analyses, p89 does not correspond to the SH2 domain containing transcription factors denoted “signal transducer and activator of transcription” (STAT; data not shown)(46Darnell Jr., J.E. Kerr I.M. Stark G.R. Science. 1994; 264: 1415-1421Crossref PubMed Scopus (5062) Google Scholar). Other possible candidate proteins, such as the regulatory subunit p85 of phosphatidylinositol 3′-kinase, do not fulfil the criterion of being tyrosine-phosphorylated only after FGF-2 and not after PDGF-BB or EGF stimulation(47Cantley L.C. Auger K.R. Carpenter C. Duckworth B. Graziani A. Kapeller R. Soltoff S. Cell. 1991; 64: 281-302Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2187) Google Scholar). Yet other signal transduction molecules with an appropriate mass, such as Eps8(48Fazioli F. Minichiello L. Matoska V. Castagnino P. Miki T. Wong W.T. Di Fiore P.P. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 3799-3808Crossref PubMed Scopus (156) Google Scholar), also lack a potential Grb2 SH2 consensus binding site. In order to further characterize the 89-kDa component, we have undertaken a purification procedure. In agreement with a role for p89 in signal transduction, we have detected only very low levels of p89 binding to Grb2 SH2, in the cell types examined this far (data not shown). We aim to extensively increase the starting material, and using microsequencing techniques, we hope to deduce the structure of p89. We thank Drs. Carl-Henrik Heldin, Eva Landgren, Stefan Wennström, and Koutaro Yokote for valuable discussions, Dr. J. Schlessinger for providing the GST-Grb2 SH2 fusion protein, Dr. J.

https://openalex.org/W2007217993,"Using the yeast two-hybrid system, a genetic assay for studying protein-protein interactions, we have examined and compared the interaction of the insulin-like growth factor-I receptor (IGF-IR) and the insulin receptor (IR) with their two known substrates p52Shc and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). We also mapped the specific domains of the IGF-IR and p52Shc participating in these interactions. Our findings can be summarized as follows: (i) the tyrosine kinase activity of the IGF-IR is essential for the interaction with p52Shc and IRS-1, (ii) p52Shc and IRS-1 bind to the IGF-IR in the NPEY-juxtamembrane motif, (iii) contrary to p52Shc, IRS-1 binds also to the major autophosphorylation sites (Tyr-1131, −1135, and −1136) of the IGF-IR, and (iv) the amino-terminal domain of p52Shc is required for its association with the IR and the IGF-IR. We propose that (i) the IGF-IR and the IR share at least in part the same molecular mechanism underlying their interplay with their two substrates, p52Shc and IRS-1, and (ii) IRS-1 interacts with the IGF-IR in a fashion that is different from that used by p52Shc. Finally, our data highlight the crucial role of the juxtamembrane domain in signaling by both the IR and the IGF-IR."
https://openalex.org/W2060513558,"Previous studies using in vitro procedures have not clearly established whether the estrogen receptor (ER) acts as a monomer or dimer in the cell. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system as an in vivo approach to investigate the dimerization of the estrogen receptor in the absence and presence of estrogen and anti-estrogens. This system is independent of ER binding to the estrogen response element. Two vectors, expressing GAL4 DNA binding domain-human ER and GAL4 transactivation domain-human ER, were constructed. Control experiments showed that each fusion protein had a high affinity binding site for estradiol-17β and could transactivate an ERE-LacZ reporter gene in yeast similar to the wild type ER. The two fusion proteins, GAL4 DB-hER and GAL 4 TA-hER, were expressed in the yeast strain, PCY2, which carries a GAL1 promoter-lacZ reporter. ER dimerization was measured via reconstitution of GAL4 through interaction of the fusion proteins, which transactivates LacZ through the GAL1 promoter. When both ER fusion proteins were expressed, β-galactosidase activity was estradiol-17β-inducible. Furthermore, we showed that both tamoxifen and ICI 182,780 also induced β-galactosidase activity, albeit lower than that induced by estradiol-17β. These results strongly argue that ER dimerization is ligand-dependent and the dimer can be induced by estradiol-17β, tamoxifen, or ICI 182,780. We also treated the yeast containing the two fusion proteins with estradiol-17β and tamoxifen or ICI 182,780 simultaneously to determine the effects on ER dimerization. β-Galactosidase activity was lower when the yeast was treated with a higher ratio of tamoxifen or ICI 182,780 to estrogen than estradiol-17β alone. Taken together, we conclude that ER dimerization is ligand (estradiol-17β, tamoxifen, or ICI 182, 780)-dependent, and we suggest that estradiol-17β-induced dimers are destabilized when estradiol-17β is used with tamoxifen or ICI 182,780 simultaneously.

The estrogen receptor (ER) 1The abbreviations used are: ERestrogen receptorEREestrogen response elementGAL4 TAGAL4 transactivation domainGAL4 DBGAL4 DNA-binding domainE2-17βestradiol-17βICIICI compoundX-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactosideONPGo-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside. is an intracellular protein that mediates the actions of estrogens in target cells. The ER is a member of a superfamily of related nuclear proteins which includes receptors for steroid hormones, thyroid hormones, vitamin D, the retinoids, and a number of proteins with high sequence homology but as yet unidentified ligands. These receptors are ligand-inducible transcription factors which bind to their specific DNA targets, termed response elements, to regulate transcription. Based on sequence homology and other approaches, the estrogen receptor protein can be divided into six functionally and physically independent domains (A-F)(1Gronemeyer H. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 94-117Google Scholar, 2Freedman P.P. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 141-160Google Scholar). These domains are required for DNA binding (region C), nuclear localization (region D), and steroid binding (region E). The ER has two well characterized transcriptional activation functions, AF-1, which is located in the N-terminal A/B region, and AF-2, which is located in region E and whose activity is ligand-dependent. The DNA binding domain and the hormone binding domain have both been reported to contribute to ER dimerization. estrogen receptor estrogen response element GAL4 transactivation domain GAL4 DNA-binding domain estradiol-17β ICI compound 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indoyl β-D-galactoside o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside. Estrogen action on target cells involves a distinct pathway where estradiol freely diffuses across the cell membrane and binds to its receptor. This ligand-receptor complex is thought to homodimerize and bind tightly to the estrogen response element (ERE). After binding DNA, ER activates transcription of its target genes by as yet unknown mechanisms. In this system, there has been some controversy as to whether the ER acts as a monomer or a dimer in the cell. It has been traditionally believed that estrogen induces dimerization of ER and hence the DNA binding(1Gronemeyer H. Parker M.G. Steroid Hormone Action. IRL Press, Oxford1993: 94-117Google Scholar). The ER has been shown to form stable homodimers in solution(3Redeuilh G. Moncharmont B. Secco C. Baulieu E.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 6969-6975Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), and several studies have given evidence that the ER and other nuclear receptors bind to response elements as dimers(4Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar, 5Wrange O. Eriksson P. Perlmann T. J. Biol.

Furlow J.D. Murdoch F.E. Fritsch M. Kaneko K. Ying C. Malayer J.R. Biol. Reprod. 1993; 48: 8-14Crossref PubMed Scopus (52) Google Scholar) have proposed a model where the ER protein binds to an ERE as a monomer or perhaps forms heterodimers with other nuclear proteins, as is the case with thyroxine receptors(9Gronemeyer H. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1991; 25: 89-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (327) Google Scholar). Most of the data for and against dimerization of ER have been shown using gel mobility shift assays or complex assays in vitro, where the assay itself requires ER to bind DNA. These assays have given conflicting evidence in demonstrating whether estrogen is required (4Kumar V. Chambon P. Cell. 1988; 55: 145-156Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (958) Google Scholar) or not required (10Klein-Hitpass L. Tsai S.Y. Greene G.L. Clark J.H. Tsai M.-J. O'Malley B.W. Mol. Cell.

It still remains unclear if the ER can form a dimer in vivo, whether estrogen has any effects on dimerization and whether the dimer is formed before or after binding the ERE. Using similar in vitro assays, the action of anti-estrogen on the ER pathway has been investigated at the levels of dimerization and/or DNA binding of ER. The ER, bound with an anti-estrogen such as tamoxifen or ICI 164,384, was shown to form a ligand-ER complex which can bind the ERE(13Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. Mol. Cell.

Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3839-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar) reported that ICI 164,384 and ICI 182,780 prevent the ER from binding ERE. Based on their previous study of mutant mouse ERs and in vitro DNA binding ability of ER, which had assumed that an ER dimer is required for binding to DNA(6Fawell S.E. Lees J.A. White R. Parker M.G. Cell. 1990; 60: 953-962Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (485) Google Scholar, 20White R. Fawell S.E. Parker M.G. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1991; 40: 333-341Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar), they concluded that ICI 164,384 and ICI 182,780 prevent ER dimerization. Since the effect of ligand on the ER-ER dimerization is still unclear and the actions of estrogen and anti-estrogens can be hypothesized to involve differences in ER dimerization, which may affect ER/DNA binding, we have used the yeast two-hybrid system, which is independent of the interaction of ER with ERE, to study ER protein dimerization in vivo. The yeast two-hybrid system has been described by Fields and co-workers(21Fields S. Song O.K. Nature. 1989; 340: 245-246Crossref PubMed Scopus (4863) Google Scholar, 22Chien C.T. Bartel P.L. Sternglaz P. Fields S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1991; 88: 9578-9582Crossref PubMed Scopus (1226) Google Scholar). It involves the expression of a LacZ reporter gene under the control of a GAL4-activated promoter (GAL1 promoter) that depends on the reconstitution of GAL4 activity via protein-protein interactions. This is accomplished by apposition of the GAL4 DNA binding (GAL4 DB) and transcription activation (GAL4 TA) domains via interaction of polypeptides fused to each domain. Colonies containing interacting polypeptides are detected with a chromogenic substrate for β-galactosidase. This system has also been used successfully in screening a cDNA library (23Ma J. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 113-119Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (498) Google Scholar, 24Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

Nature. 1993; 366: 705-707Crossref Scopus (3374) Google Scholar) and has turned out to be a useful approach to study protein-protein interactions in vivo. In our experiments, the human ER cDNA was cloned into the GAL4 fusion vectors, pPC62 (GAL4 DB) and pPC86 (GAL4 TA)(24Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar), to study the dimerization of ER and the effects of ligands on dimerization. Using this yeast two-hybrid system, we show that the ER-ER interaction is estrogen-dependent in vivo. We also show that the anti-estrogens, tamoxifen and ICI 182,780, can induce ER dimerization. Dimerization, however, is perturbed when estrogen is used with anti-estrogens simultaneously. The implications of these data on the ER-ER dimer are discussed. Yeast strain PCY2 (MATa Δgal4 Δgal80 URA3::GAL1-lacZ lys2-801amberhis3-Δ200 trp1-Δ63leu2ade2-101ochre) was obtained from Dr. Nathans and Dr. Chevray, which is the product of a cross between GGY1::171 (26Gill G. Ptashne M. Cell. 1987; 51: 121-126Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (180) Google Scholar) and YPH499(27Sikorski R.S. Hieter P. Genetics. 1989; 122: 19-27Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) . Yeast strain RS188N (MATa ade2-1 his3-1 leu2-112 trp1-1 ura3-1), a “leaky” yeast strain, was a gift from Dr. T. Butt(16Lyttle C.R. Damian-Matsumura P. Juul H. Butt T.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Yeast strains were grown in yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YEPD) or supplemented synthetic dextrose medium(28Arbuckle N.D. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3839-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transformation of yeast was carried out using the lithium acetate method with plasmid DNA(28Arbuckle N.D. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3839-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Yeast colonies transformed with the fusion vectors were selected by culture on synthetic medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and/or leucine. Construction of GAL4-hER fusion vectors involved cloning human ER cDNA into the pPC62 (GAL4 DB) and pPC86 (GAL4 TA) fusion vectors (kindly provided by Drs. Chevray and Nathans). Human ER cDNA (hER) was kindly provided by Dr. Katzenellenbogen, which was placed into the SalI site of pCMV-5 (Dr. David Russell, University of Texas Southern Medical Center)(29Reese J.C. Katzenellenbogen B.S. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 10880-10887Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We subcloned the hER cDNA digested with SalI into pBluescript II SK+ at the SalI site such that its transcription is dependent on T7 polymerase (T7-hER). T7-hER was amplified with T3 primer and an oligonucleotide (5′-GGGGATCGTCGACTCGGTCTGCA-3′), which was designed by inserting a SalI site and an extra T base before the ER start codon to keep the correct reading frame intact in the GAL4-hER vector. The PCR product was directly cloned into GAL4 DB and GAL4 TA at the SalI site. The GAL4 DB-hER and GAL4 TA-hER fusion cDNAs were then sequenced to confirm correct reading frame before transforming yeast. The yeast two-hybrid system control vectors, GAL4 TA-bz-c-jun, GAL4 DB-bz-c-jun, GAL4 TA-bz-c-fos, and GAL4 DB-bz-c-fos, were kindly provided by Dr. Chevray(24Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar). The yeast ERE-lacZ reporter (YRpE2) used in the leaky yeast experiments were kindly provided by Dr. T. Butt(16Lyttle C.R. Damian-Matsumura P. Juul H. Butt T.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In all cases, β-galactosidase activity, which was the product of LacZ driven by the GAL1 promoter, was used to indicate the reconstitution of GAL4 transactivation activity via the interaction of the two fusion proteins. β-Galactosidase activity was qualified and quantified in various tests. For qualifying activity, yeast colonies transformed with the fusion vectors were selected by culture on synthetic medium lacking uracil, tryptophan, and/or leucine and transferred to nitrocellulose filters. The yeast colonies on the filters were cultured by placing the filters on Whatman No. 3MM filter paper soaked with medium with or without the addition of steroid hormones for 3-12 h. Estradiol-17β, tamoxifen, progesterone, dexamethasone, testosterone, and medroxyprogesterone acetate were obtained from Sigma, and ICI 182,780 was obtained from ICI Pharmaceuticals. The yeast treated with 0.1-0.3% ethanol (the final concentration) was used as the vehicle control. Yeast colonies on the nitrocellulose filter were then frozen with liquid nitrogen for a few seconds followed by the X-gal indication reaction. β-Galactosidase activity of liquid yeast cultures was quantified as described(28Arbuckle N.D. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3839-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). Transformed yeast were selected and then cultured in synthetic medium (in the case of β-galactosidase activity assays, glucose was replaced with galactose). The agonist and/or antagonists were added to the yeast liquid culture after the cells grew to late log phase (A600 >0.7 for the culture in the galactose medium). After stimulation with estrogen agonist or antagonists for a certain time, the yeast cells were collected by low speed centrifugation. The yeast cells were resuspended in an equal volume of Z-buffer (60 mM Na2HPO4, 40 mM NaH2PO4, 10 mM KCl, 1 mM MgSO4, 50 mM β-mercaptoethanol, pH 7.0) and placed on ice. The 1 ml of reaction mixture was made up of 0.1 or 0.05 ml of cells in Z-buffer (the value of β-galactosidase activity is an average value of the duplicated assay). The cells in the reaction mixture were permeabilized with one drop of 0.1% SDS and two drops of chloroform. Then, the reactions were started with the addition of 0.2 ml of 4 mg/ml o-nitrophenyl-β-D-galactoside (ONPG) at 30°C and stopped by adding 0.5 ml of 1 M Na2CO3. β-Galactosidase activity was determined with the values at A420 and 550 using the following equation: U = 1000 × [(A420) - (1.75 × A550)]/[t × v × A600] (t = time of the reaction (min); v = volume of yeast culture used in the reaction mixture (ml)]. The estradiol-17β binding capability of GAL4 DB-hER and GAL4 TA-hER were characterized from yeast extract(30White J.H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 819-828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Metzger D. White J.H. Chambon P. Nature. 1988; 334: 31-36Crossref PubMed Scopus (318) Google Scholar). The yeast extract were obtained by “glass bead vortexing” the transformed yeast cells in 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 400 mM KCl, and 1 mM PMSF. After centrifugition (14,000 × g) at 4°C for 30 min, the supernatant was incubated overnight at 4°C with [3H]estradiol-17β (Amersham Corp., 93 Ci/mmol) in presence (nonspecific binding) or absence (specific binding) of 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled estradiol-17β. The free and bound ligands were separated using dextran-coated charcoal. Radioactivity of each fraction was determined, and the specific binding was obtained by subtraction of nonspecific from total binding. The KD of the GAL4-hER fusion proteins was determined by Scatchard analysis. The transcriptional activity of GAL4-hER fusion proteins upon treatment of various concentrations of estradiol-17β was tested using the leaky yeast strain RS188N(16Lyttle C.R. Damian-Matsumura P. Juul H. Butt T.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). In this yeast strain, response to estradiol-17β can be seen at the physiological concentration of the hormone(16Lyttle C.R. Damian-Matsumura P. Juul H. Butt T.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). The GAL4 TA-hER and/or GAL4 DB-hER vectors were transformed into yeast strain RS188N with ERE-lacZ. The transformants were selected using synthetic medium lacking tryptophan, leucine, and uracil. The yeast carrying hER fusion protein(s) and ERE-lacZ reporter were cultured in liquid medium and treated with various concentrations of estradiol-17β for 6 h. The transcriptional activity in response to estrogen was analyzed using the ONPG reaction. Immunoblotting was used to quantify the amount of intact GAL4-hER fusion proteins. Total protein was extracted from the yeast as follows. The yeast liquid culture stimulated with estrogen agonist or antagonists for various times (described above) were collected by low speed centrifugation and resuspended in 0.25 M NaOH and 1%β-mercaptoethanol (1 ml for 5 ml of yeast culture) and incubated on ice for 10 min. Then, 0.16 ml of trichloroacetic acid (50%) was added to 1 ml of suspension. The yeast was incubated for 10 min on ice before collecting by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 10 min. The pellet was washed with the same volume of cold acetone, allowed to air dry, and resuspended in 0.2 ml SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis sample buffer. Equal amounts of total protein were analyzed on 8.5% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). After the transfer, the blots were stained with 0.5% Ponceau S Red to monitor transfer efficiencies and subsequently probed with the anti-ER antibody. Since ER has two independent transcriptional activation domains (AF-1 and AF-2), as well as a DNA binding domain, it was unknown whether ER itself could activate transcription of the GAL1-lacZ reporter gene. Therefore, we first examined β-galactosidase activity in yeast carrying only one of the fusion proteins. Human ER cDNA was cloned into the GAL4 fusion vectors (GAL4 DB and GAL4 TA) and introduced into PCY2 yeast to express GAL4 DB-hER or GAL4 TA-hER, respectively. β-Galactosidase activity in the yeast colonies selected with Trp or Leu dropout medium was determined using X-gal indicator (Table 1). No blue colony was found on filters where yeast containing only GAL4 TA-hER were growing. After the yeast was treated with estrogen, the same result was observed. GAL4 TA-hER yeast in absence or presence of estrogen showed no significant β-galactosidase activity (less than 0.01 unit). Because this fusion protein does not have the GAL4 DNA binding domain, it fails to localize to the specific upstream DNA sequences necessary for GAL1-lacZ transcription. In yeast carrying only the GAL4 DB-hER, no blue colony was found during our assay period (Table 1). Only during prolonged treatment times (72 h) were a few pale blue colonies found (usually <1%) in the absence or presence of E2-17β. This fusion protein can bind to upstream sequences in the GAL1-lacZ promoter, but does not significantly activate the reporter gene. This result is supported by the finding that GAL4 transactivation is believed to be mediated by its acidic stretches of amino acids in the activation domain, whereas the two independent transcription domains of human ER are non-acidic(32Tora L. White J. Brou C. Tasset D. Webster N. Scheer E. Chambon P. Cell. 1989; 59: 477-487Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (889) Google Scholar). In control yeast cotransformed with the fusion vectors alone (GAL4 DB and GAL4 TA), there was no detectable β-galactosidase activity. We conclude that GAL4 DB-hER or GAL4 TA-hER fusion proteins alone do not contain significant GAL4 transactivation properties.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Next, we sought to examine the interaction of GAL4-hER fusion proteins in yeast in the absence and presence of estradiol-17β. For this purpose, PCY2 yeast was cotransformed with GAL4 DB-hER and GAL4 TA-hER and selected in Trp and Leu dropout medium. β-Galactosidase activity was then measured before and after the treatment of estradiol-17β (1 μM). The estradiol-17β treatment led to a dramatic change in the percentage of blue colonies: 100% of the yeast carrying both GAL4 DB-hER and GAL4 TA-hER were blue (Table 1). In comparison, the yeast carrying only GAL4 DB-hER showed 3% blue colonies even after longer exposure (>72 h) to X-gal, and the color remained very light. The result was confirmed by the β-galactosidase activity assay of liquid culture of 1 μM estrogen-treated yeast with or without GAL4 TA-hER and/or GAL4 DB-hER (Fig. 1). We also tested the role of varying concentrations of estradiol-17β on induction of β-galactosidase activity. In this experiment, β-galactosidase activity was measured at different times after adding estradiol-17β as well as at different concentrations using the standard method(28Arbuckle N.D. Dauvois S. Parker M.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1992; 20: 3839-3844Crossref PubMed Scopus (31) Google Scholar). β-Galactosidase activity in yeast (PCY2) treated in this manner was time-dependent but 10-5M to 10-6M concentrations of estradiol-17β were sufficient for the yeast to reach the highest activity (Fig. 1). The lowest concentration (10-8M) showed no significant β-galactosidase activity. In all cases, we noticed no effect of ligand on yeast growth. To determine if ER-ER dimer formation was specific for estradiol-17β, the yeast carrying GAL4 DB-hER and GAL4 TA-hER were also treated with 1 μM or 0.1 μM progesterone, medroxyprogesterone acetate, dexamethasone, or testosterone. Yeast treated with these steroids showed no significant β-galactosidase activity (3.6-4.6 units) as compared with control (0.1% ethanol)-treated yeast (4.0 units). These results indicate an estradiol-17β-inducible interaction between GAL4 DB-hER and GAL4 TA-hER, which reconstitutes GAL4 and transactivates lacZ through the GAL1 promoter. To determine the extent of ER dimerization that takes place upon addition of estradiol-17β, we compared the levels of ER dimerization with those of the dimers formed by Jun and Fos using the same system. Both Jun/Jun and Jun/Fos form functional dimers in vivo, giving strong Ap-1 activity(33Chiu R. Boyle W.J. Meek J. Smeal T. Hunter T. Karin M. Cell. 1988; 54: 541-552Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1010) Google Scholar). However, formation of the Jun/Fos dimer is favored over the Jun/Jun dimer as described (24Chevray P.M. Nathans D. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 5789-5793Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar) and also shown here (Fig. 2). The ER fusion protein dimer reconstituted about 10% relative β-galactosidase activity of that by the Jun/Fos dimer and was 25 times stronger than that by the Jun/Jun dimer (Fig. 2). We conclude that the ability of ER to dimerize is significantly enhanced by estradiol-17β. In the absence of estrogen, ER seems to exist as a monomer (or forms a heterodimer/oligomer with other proteins), but there seems to be little or no direct ER-ER interaction. Since the concentration of estrogen necessary for significant β-galactosidase activity was higher than the typical mammalian physiological concentration (1 nM), and induction time was at least 3 h, we decided to measure the affinity of the fusion proteins for estradiol and to determine if these proteins were transcriptionally active. Saturation and Scatchard plots were used to determine the binding capability of ER to estradiol-17β, showing a high affinity binding site having a KD of 0.84 nM for GAL4 TA-hER and 1.4 nM for GAL4 DB-hER (Fig. 3). These values show a slightly reduced affinity for estradiol when compared with previous data regarding hER from MCF7 cells (KD = 0.6 nM)(30White J.H. Metzger D. Chambon P. Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. 1988; 53: 819-828Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 31Metzger D. White J.H. Chambon P.

Biol. 1994; 48: 447-452Crossref PubMed Scopus (24) Google Scholar)). To determine if GAL4 DB-hER and GAL4 TA-hER were functional as compared with wild type hER, we measured the ability of these proteins to transcriptionally activate an ERE-lacZ reporter plasmid in hyperpermeable (leaky) yeast. Using leaky yeast allowed us to eliminate any questions regarding the ability of the yeast to take up estradiol-17β. Unfortunately, a leaky yeast strain is not available currently for use in the two-hybrid system. ERE-lacZ was cotransformed into RS188N yeast either with GAL4 DB-hER or with GAL4 TA-hER. The ability of each fusion protein to activate transcription of the reporter gene was highly regulated by estradiol-17β, showing similar activity in response to the various concentrations of estradiol-17β, from 1 nM to 1 μM (Fig. 4). These data are in good agreement with the transcriptional activity reported with the wild type hER used in the same yeast strain(16Lyttle C.R. Damian-Matsumura P. Juul H. Butt T.R. J. Steroid Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1992; 42: 677-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (81) Google Scholar). Therefore, we can conclude that GAL4 DB-hER and GAL4 TA-hER fusion proteins expressed in yeast are functional; they bind estradiol-17β with high affinity and show similar estrogen-dependent gene regulation as compared with the wild type hER. Since anti-estrogens may mimic or inhibit estrogen induction at various levels in the estrogen-dependent transactivation pathway, we next examined whether the anti-estrogens tamoxifen and ICI 182,780 induce β-galactosidase activity via the ER dimerization.

https://openalex.org/W1967554858,"α1-Adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes mediate many effects of the sympathetic nervous system. The three cloned subtypes (α1a-AR, α1b-AR, α1d-AR), although structurally similar, bind a series of ligands with different relative potencies. This is particularly true for the α1a-AR, which recognizes a number of agonists and antagonists with 5-50-fold higher affinity than the α1b- or α1d- subtypes. Since ligands bind to receptor-residues that are located in the transmembrane spanning domains, we hypothesize that subtype differences in ligand recognition are due to differences in the binding properties of nonconserved transmembrane residues. Using site-directed mutagenesis, selected putative ligand-binding residues in the α1b-AR were converted, either individually or in combination, to the corresponding residues in the α1a-AR. Mutation of two such residues (of approximately 172 amino acids in the transmembrane domains) converted the agonist binding profile entirely to that of the α1a-AR. Over 80% of this conversion was due to an Ala204 → Val substitution; the remainder was due to the additional substitution of Leu314 → Met. To confirm that Ala 204 and Leu314 are indeed critical for agonist subtype-selectivity, the equivalent residues in the α1a-AR (Val18 and Met293) were reversed of that of the α1b-AR. Correspondingly, the agonist-binding profile of this double α1a-AR mutant reverted to that of the α1b-AR. From these data, in conjunction with macromolecular modeling of the ligand-binding pocket, a model has been developed, which indicates that the determinants of these two residues for agonist subtype-selectivity are due not only to interactions between their side chains and specific ligand moieties but also to a critical interaction between these two amino acids. α1-Adrenergic receptor (AR) subtypes mediate many effects of the sympathetic nervous system.

The cloned subtypes are designated lower case letters as α1a, α1b, and α1d. The pharmacologically described tissue subtypes are defined as the α1A, α1B and α1C, respectively(1Hieble J.P. Bylund D.B. Clarke D.E. Eikenburg D.C. Langer S.Z. Lefkowitz R.J. Minneman K.P. Ruffolo Jr., R.R. Pharmacol. Rev. 1995; 47: 267-270Google Scholar). are members of the seven transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor family that are activated by norepinephrine released from sympathetic nerve endings and by epinephrine released from the adrenal medulla. They are part of a larger subset of related but distinct adrenergic receptors, which include the β- (β1, β2, β3) and the α2- (α2A, α2B, α2C) adrenergic receptors. α1-ARs are expressed in a wide variety of tissues including the brain, liver, myocardium, and vascular smooth muscle(2Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Malik N. Gaivin R. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 823-831Google Scholar, 3Hwa J. DeYoung M. Perez D.M. Graham R.M. Burnstock G. Shepherd J. Vatner S.F.

Thus far, three α1-AR subtypes have been cloned and pharmacologically characterized, the α1b-AR(4Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randell R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7159-7163Google Scholar), the α1a-AR(2Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Malik N. Gaivin R. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 46: 823-831Google Scholar, 5Schwinn D.A. Lomasney J.N. Loreng W. Szklut P.J. Fremeau Jr., R.T. Yang-Feng T.L. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Cotecchia S. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8183-8189Google Scholar), and the α1d-AR(6Lomasney J.W. Cotecchia S. Lorenz W. Leung W.Y.

The α1a-subtype has a 5-50-fold higher affinity for the agonists oxymetazoline and methoxamine and for the antagonists 5-methylurapidil, (+)-niguldipine, and phentolamine when compared with the α1b- or the α1d-subtype(2Perez D.M.

However, there are currently no good subtype-selective drugs readily available that can discriminate between the subtypes, based on 100-1000-fold differences in affinity. adrenergic receptor transmembrane base pair(s) (±)-β-([125I]iodo-4-hydroxyphenyl)-ethyl-aminomethyl-tetralone wild type. Recent studies have indicated that α1-subtypes can mediate different and sometimes opposing physiological effects. In particular the α1a-AR appears to promote automaticity and arrhythmias during myocardial ischemia, whereas the α1b-AR subtype can activate a Na+/K+ pump leading to cell hyperpolarization, thus decreasing the propensity for abnormal heart rhythms(8Anyukhovsky E.P. Rosen M.R. Circulation. 1991; 83: 2076-2082Google Scholar). In addition, it is now known that the α1a-subtype regulates the predominant dynamic component involved in the development of benign prostatic hypertrophy(9Forray C. Bard J.A. Wetzel J.M. Chiu G. Shapiro E. Tang R. Lepor H. Hartig P.R. Weunshank R.L. Branchek T.A. Gluchowski C. Mol. Pharmacol. 1994; 45: 703-708Google Scholar). Hence, development of better α1-subtype-selective drugs to either block or enhance function may help in combating subtype-related disorders. In order to design selective drugs, an understanding of subtype differences in the ligand binding pockets would be invaluable. Although the residues forming the α1-AR binding-pocket have not been defined, key interactions are likely to be similar to those of the β-adrenergic receptor, since both receptor families are activated by the catecholamines, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. Based on studies of the β2-AR, key points of interaction are believed to occur between Asp213 in the third transmembrane helix (TMIII) with that of the protonated amine of the agonists, and between two serine residues (TMV; Ser204 and Ser207) that hydrogen-bond with the meta- and parahydroxyl groups of the catechol ring. These critical binding contacts with the natural ligands are well conserved between the subtypes. However, there are 48 amino acid differences in the transmembrane domains between the α1b-AR and the α1a-AR. We hypothesize that only a few of these nonconserved residues are critical for the ligand binding specificity of each α1-AR subtype since only a subset of these nonconserved residues occur in the regions of the transmembrane domain thought to be involved in ligand binding. Therefore, rather than sequentially mutating all amino acids that differ between the α1-subtypes, we have developed simple criteria to select those residues that may be critical for ligand binding and thus are involved in subtype differences in ligand binding profiles. Eight α1b-AR residues were mutated individually to the corresponding residue in the α1a-AR. Two of these changes, when combined in a double mutant, conferred on the α1b-AR the agonist binding properties of the α1a-AR. A single change, Ala204 → Val 3Mutations indicate the position of the wild type and substituting residue. Thus, for example, in the Ala204 → Val (α1b) mutation, the wild-type alanine residue at position 204 in the α1b-AR has been mutated to a valine. in TMV, made the greatest contribution to the change in ligand binding. Reversal of these two residues in the α1a-AR to those in the α1b-AR reversed the agonist binding profile back to that of the α1b-AR. The construct used was the hamster α1b-AR cDNA (∼1600 bp) (4Cotecchia S. Schwinn D.A. Randell R.R. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Kobilka B.K. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 7159-7163Google Scholar) including an EcoRI restriction site at the 5′ end and a region encoding an octapeptide tag (ID4), at the end of the coding region, which was used to evaluate membrane expression with the monoclonal antibody (anti-ID4). The attachment of this epitope after the coding region does not affect protein expression or the function of the receptor. The construct terminates with a stop codon and a NotI restriction site. The EcoRI/NotI sites permitted insertion into the modified eukaryotic expression vector pMT2′(7Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883Google Scholar). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as described previously utilizing the oligonucleotide-mediated double primer M13 method(10Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989: 15.63-15.73Google Scholar). The α1b-AR cDNA was divided into two 800-bp fragments by digestion with the restriction endonuclease BamHI. Each of the fragments were inserted individually into an M13 phagemid. The full-length 1600-bp receptor gene was not inserted into M13 since such a large insert would be more susceptible to spontaneous mutations. Mutagenesis utilized a 20-base mutagenic primer encoding the codon mismatches to achieve the desired point mutation(s) and a universal primer(−20) for extension on single-stranded M13 templates. After transformation of the single-stranded products into DH5αF‘ cells, plaques were screened for the mutation on nitrocellulose lifts and probed with the 32P-end-labeled mutagenic primer. The efficiency of mutagenic incorporation was 5% of total plaques. Positive plaques were purified, and the DNA was isolated and sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method (Sequenase, Amersham Corp.). The mutated fragment (800 bp) was then ligated with its complementary wild-type fragment (800 bp) into pMT2′ for transfection into COS-1 cells. Sequencing was utilized to confirm that the fragments were in the correct orientation and that the appropriate mutation was present. Combination mutations were generated using unique restriction sites located within the α1b-AR cDNA. Reverse mutations that incorporated equivalent point mutations into the rat α1a-AR were also performed using similar methods. COS-1 cells (ATCC) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing penicillin, streptomycin, glutamine, and 5% fetal bovine serum. At 60-80% confluency, transient transfection was performed according to published procedures(7Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883Google Scholar). Plasmid DNA was purified by RNase treatment and column chromatography utilizing the Wizard Maxiprep kit (Fisher). In brief, transfection involved initial washing of the cells with Hanks' balanced salt solution followed by the addition of the DNA mixture (10 μg/3 × 106 cells) in DEAE-dextran. After a 5-h incubation and a further wash, 10% dimethyl sulfoxide was used to shock the cells, and 0.1 mM chloroquine was added for 2 h. Cells were harvested 72 h posttransfection. Membranes were prepared as described previously(7Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883Google Scholar). Briefly, the cells were washed in Hanks' balanced salt solution and removed from the flask. To isolate the membranes, the cells were suspended in 0.25 mM sucrose with protease inhibitors and subjected to nitrogen cavitation at 400 p.s.i. for 20 min. The cells were then homogenized in a “B” glass Dounce homogenizer for 10 strokes and spun at low speed (1260 × g for 5 min) to remove nuclei and microsomes, and then centrifuged at 30,000 × g for 15 min. After two further washes with HEM (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 1.5 mM EGTA, and 12.5 mM MgCl2) and recentrifugation at 30,000 × g, the pellet was resuspended in HEM containing 10% glycerol and stored at −70°C. A Bradford protein assay was performed initially on known concentrations of bovine serum albumin followed by membrane preparations of the wild-type and mutant α1b-ARs. The ligand binding characteristics of the expressed receptors were determined in a series of radioligand binding studies using [125I]HEAT, an α1-specific antagonist as the radioprobe(7Perez D.M. Piascik M.T. Graham R.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 876-883Google Scholar). In brief, for competition studies, the procedure involved duplicate tubes containing (total volume, 250 μl) 200 pM [125I]HEAT, HEM buffer, COS-1 membranes, and increasing amounts of unlabeled competing ligand (at 10 or more different dilutions). Nonspecific binding was determined by the addition of phentolamine (10−4M). For saturation binding studies, 200-1600 pM [125I]HEAT was used. After 1 h of incubation at room temperature, the reactions were stopped by the addition of ice-cold HEM buffer and were filtered onto Whatman GF/C glass filters with a Brandel cell harvester. The filters were washed 5 times with ice-cold HEM. They were then analyzed for bound radioactivity using a Packard Auto-γ 500 counter. Data were analyzed using the interactive program LIGAND. IC50 values were converted to Ki using the Cheng-Prusoff equation and a KD for [125I] HEAT of 90 pM. Ki values were expressed as a mean ± S.E. An analysis of variance and Student's t test was used to determine significant differences (p < 0.05). To detect small but significant differences, sets of mutations along with the wild-types α1b-AR and α1a-AR were evaluated simultaneously (i.e. in the same assay). The coordinates of the α-carbon positions were determined by an overlay of the putative α1-AR transmembrane residues with the transmembrane coordinates of bacteriorhodopsin(11Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Google Scholar). Data files were generated with the Insight II molecular modeling software from Biosym Technologies. The boundaries of the putative transmembrane domains were determined by an algorithm based upon the weighted pairwise comparisons of adjacent residues(12Riek R.P. Handschumacher M.K. Sung S.-S. Tan M. Glynias M.J. Schluchter M.D. Novotny J. Graham R.M. J. Theor. Biol. 1995; 172: 245-258Google Scholar). The model was then minimized, and conflicts were adjusted as described previously(13Sung S.-S. Handschumacher N.D. Novotny J. Graham R.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5 (abstr.): 804Google Scholar). Assumptions of key interactions of specific amino acids with agonist are based upon previous mutagenesis work and proposed models with the β-AR(14Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Google Scholar). Results of our mutagenesis were then used to refine the structure of the α1-AR ligand binding pocket. Drugs were obtained from the following manufacturers.(-)-Epinephrine,(-)-norepinephrine, oxymetazoline, methoxamine, phenylephrine, and phentolamine were from Sigma; Cirazoline was a gift from Pfizer. [125I]HEAT, was from DuPont NEN. 5-Methylurapidil and WB4101 were from Research Biochemicals International (Natick, MA). The α1b-AR and the α1a-AR, although structurally similar in their transmembrane domains, have some significant differences in their ligand-binding affinities for a number of agonists and antagonists. Determining the critical amino acids responsible for these differences in binding properties may assist in the design of better subtype selective drugs. We hypothesized that there are only a few nonconserved transmembrane amino acids that distinguish the α1b-AR agonist-binding pocket from that of the α1a-AR. Our choice of the α1a-AR and the α1b-AR as the initial targets for mutagenesis was 2-fold. First, as already described, there are some important differences in the responses mediated by these two subtypes, which may be of pathophysiological and therapeutic relevance. Second, the α1a has a 5-50-fold greater affinity for a number of agonists and antagonists than the α1b-AR. This allowed us to detect even small but significant changes in affinity (e.g. 2-5-fold) with our individual mutations in converting the α1b-AR to the α1a-AR. Candidate residues potentially involved in subtype selectivity were selected for mutation from the 48 nonconserved transmembrane amino acids, based on the following criteria: 1) location in the upper half of the transmembrane domain, where previous studies indicate that small ligands are bound; 2) exclusion of the first transmembrane domain since, based on models of bacteriorhodopsin and rhodopsin, this appears not to be directly involved in forming the ligand binding pocket(11Henderson R. Baldwin J.M. Ceska T.A. Zemlin F. Beckmann E. Downing K.H. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 213: 899-929Google Scholar); 3) location on the transmembrane α-helices such that their side-chains are oriented toward the putative binding pocket or adjacent transmembrane domains rather than toward the surrounding phospholipid bilayer (orientation of the side-chains was determined based on consideration of models of the α1b-AR developed in our laboratory(13Sung S.-S. Handschumacher N.D. Novotny J. Graham R.M. FASEB J. 1991; 5 (abstr.): 804Google Scholar), and on the model of rhodopsin developed by Baldwin (15Baldwin J.M. EMBO J. 1993; 12: 4:1693-4:1703Google Scholar)); 4) lack of conservation not due merely to interspecies differences, since there is conservation of α1-subtype ligand-binding profiles across species. Seven amino acids (Fig. 1) of the α1b-AR were identified that fulfilled the criteria, and these residues were mutated to the corresponding residues on the α1a-AR. An eighth residue Leu182 → Phe was also mutated. Although this residue was predicted to be facing the hydrocarbon environment, it was selected because the corresponding α1a-AR residue represented a significant change in size and functional group. Moreover, if our prediction of its orientation was correct, mutation of this residue should not alter ligand binding and, thus, this mutant would serve as a negative control. The eight point mutations were initially analyzed by their ability to bind a panel of agonists. Ki values for six α1-AR agonists are shown in Table 1 and Fig. 2. The Ala204 → Val mutation had a 5-10-fold increased binding affinity over the wild-type α1b-AR (WTb) for oxymetazoline (p < 0.001), cirazoline (p < 0.001), and methoxamine (p < 0.001), a ligand binding profile that is more consistent with that of the α1a-AR (Fig. 2A). Paradoxically, this mutation also had increased affinity (3-5-fold) for the natural ligands epinephrine (p < 0.01) and norepinephrine (p < 0.001) as well as phenylephrine (p < 0.001), which all show no selectivity between these two α1-AR subtypes (Fig. 2B). The Leu314 → Met mutant also demonstrated a significant increase in its affinity for methoxamine (p < 0.001), cirazoline (p < 0.001), and oxymetazoline (p < 0.05) (Fig. 2B) but not for epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine (see Fig. 5). The other six point mutations including the Leu182 → Phe mutation showed no significant change from an α1b-AR pharmacology (Table 1). Each mutation had its own characteristic effect on binding. However, only the Ala204 → Val and Leu314 → Met mutations significantly altered their ligand-binding profiles from that of an α1b-AR to that of an α1a-AR pharmacology.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 5:A, the reverse mutations of Leu314 → Met and Ala204 → Val (α1b-AR) was performed in the α1a-AR (Met293 → Leu and Val18 → Ala, respectively). Removal of the inhibitory effect of methionine (Met293 → Leu) resulted in an increased affinity for agonists that lacked an ortho hydrophobic group (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine). This is equivalent to the Ala204 → Val in the α1b-AR. B, the combination of Met293 → Leu and Val18 → Ala in the α1a-AR revealed an α1b-AR agonist pharmacology. Shown for comparison is the α1b-AR double mutant Ala204 → Val/Leu314 → Met.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) Our results indicate that with agonist binding, individual amino acids, particularly in the 5th and 6th transmembrane domains, are critical in defining the agonist binding pocket between the α1b-AR and the α1a-AR. Each agonist is similarly effected by changes in critical residues but not to the same degree. The Ala204 → Val mutation appears to explain most of the higher affinity for agonists as seen with the α1a-AR. The increased affinity observed with the substitution of valine for alanine may be related to an increased hydrophobic interaction between the valine and the aromatic ring of the ligands. The increase in binding affinity with the Leu314 → Met may be due to an increased interaction as a result of the extended chain length of the methionine residue with the ortho hydrophobic group found with many of the synthetic agonists. Supporting this is the progressive increase in affinity conferred by Leu314 → Met with a progressive increase in size and hydrophobicity of the ortho side chain. The descending order of binding affinities (Fig. 2A) are cirazoline > methoxamine > oxymetazoline and their respective side chains are a cyclopropyl, a methoxy, and a methyl group. The serine involved in the Ser208 → Ala (α1b) mutation corresponds to one of the proposed serines that binds to the catechol ring hydroxyls. Previous studies have shown that mutation of the equivalent serine residue in the β2-adrenergic receptor (residue 204) to alanine, decreases binding affinity by 10-fold (14Strader C.D. Candelore M.R. Hill W.S. Sigal I.S. Dixon R.A.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 13572-13578Google Scholar) and reduces the intrinsic activity of full agonists. Thus, it was proposed that for full agonist activity in the β2-AR, both hydroxyls on the catechol ring hydrogen bonded to the two serines, Ser204 and Ser207. Site-directed mutagenesis on the α2A-AR at the equivalent positions Ser200 and Ser204 suggested a role for Ser204 in hydrogen bonding, whereas Ser200 appeared not to be necessary in catecholamine binding(16Wang C.D. Buck M. Fraser C.M. Mol. Pharmacol. 1991; 40: 168-179Google Scholar). In the α1-AR, the serine at position 208 (equivalent to Ser204 in the β2-AR and Ser200 in the α2A-AR) appears not to be required for hydrogen bonding to the catechol ring of the natural ligands since the binding affinity of the Ser208 → Ala (α1b) mutant was unaltered from that of the wild-type α1b-AR (Table 1). Consistent with this hypothesis, phenylephrine has only a single hydroxyl at the metaposition and is a full agonist for both the α1b-AR and the α1a-AR. Thus the metahydroxyl is likely to hydrogen bond to Ser211 (α1b), the serine equivalent to Ser207 on the β2-AR and Ser204 on the α2A-AR. This indicates that determinants of agonist binding and intrinsic activity in the β2-AR are likely not entirely conserved among the α-adrenergic receptors and that α1-ARs display a phenotype for hydroxyl binding similar to the α2-ARs. Analysis of the eight α1b-AR mutants for alterations in antagonist binding revealed no significant changes particularly for Ala204 → Val and Leu314 → Met, which were shown to significantly alter agonist binding affinities (Table 2). This indicates that the determinants for agonist binding may be quite distinct from those for antagonist binding. Antagonists, as a result of their larger size, may extend to both the first and seventh transmembrane domain and perhaps bind below the upper half of the transmembrane domain. Our selection criteria for mutagenesis precluded the first transmembrane domain and the lower half of the binding pocket. Thus our selection criteria may have favored residues involved in agonist interactions.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Combination mutations were made to assess if the individual mutations were independent and/or additive in their affects on changing the binding-profiles to that of the α1a-AR. The initial combination (Ser95 → Thr/Phe96 → Ser, Leu182 → Phe, and Ser208 → Ala), involved mutations that by themselves had no major effect on ligand binding. The binding-profile of this combination was not different from that of the wild-type α1b-AR (Table 3, Fig. 3). When the two mutants that alone showed a significant change toward the α1a-AR (Leu314 → Met/Ala204 → Val) were combined, the ligand binding profile of this double mutant was now similar to that of the wild-type α1a-AR (Table 3, Fig. 3). Interestingly, this double mutant showed affinity changes that were additive for methoxamine, oxymetazoline, and cirazoline but inhibitory for epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine. Thus for epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine, the additional change of the Leu314 to methionine decreased the affinity observed for these ligands with the single Ala204 → Val mutant. Fig. 4, a and b, represents a model that explains this phenomenon. All three agonists that showed an additive effect when Leu314 → Met and Ala204 → Val were combined have a hydrophobic group at the ortho position of the phenyl ring. Thus, the bulkier methionine residue may allow a hydrophobic interaction with this ortho substituent on the phenyl ring. As a result, the ortho group would no longer interact with the valine of the Ala204 → Val mutation, and the valine side chain would be free to interact with the hydrophobic phenyl ring (Fig. 4A). Since both residues interact with different components on the agonist and assist each other, their interaction is additive and cooperative. In the absence of an ortho group on the ligand, the bulkier methionine may interact with the Val204 and inhibit this valine from interacting with the phenyl ring, due to the proximity of these two residues on the fifth and sixth transmembrane domains. Therefore, with the double mutant (Leu314 → Met and Ala204 → Val), the affinity of ligands lacking an ortho group is decreased (Fig. 4B). Thus, residues Leu314 and Ala204 together differentiate the α1b-AR agonist binding pocket from that of the α1a-AR.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Figure 4:A model of the Ala204 → Val and Leu314 → Met (α1b) mutations showing proposed interactions in the agonist binding pocket. The graph represents the individual mutations followed by the combination of Leu314 → Met and Ala204 → Val. The y axis shows Ki (-log) differences from the WTb. Below each graph is a model that describes the data. Oxymetazoline is used to represent an agonist with a hydrophobic ortho group and phenylephrine, an agonist without such a group. Only transmembranes 5 (TMIV) and 6 (TMVI) are shown. Only the phenyl ring and the ortho group of the ligand is represented. Arrows indicate the putative sites of interactions. A, for oxymetazoline, Leu314 → Met interacts with the ortho methyl group, and Ala204 → Val interacts with the phenyl ring. In combination the 314 position is pulled away by the ortho substituent from the 204 position allowing both residues to interact freely with the ligand, thus having an additive effect. B, for phenylephrine, the lack of an ortho group results in steric inhibition of the 204 position by the bulkier methionine, leading to an inhibitory effect when they are combined.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We performed the equivalent reverse mutations in the α1a-AR to confirm that the Leu314 → Met and Ala204 → Val mutations (α1b-AR residues) indeed define the critical residues differentiating the α1b-AR and α1a-AR agonist binding pocket (Table 4). The results showed that a Val18 → Ala mutation (corresponding residue to the Ala204 → Val mutation in the α1b-AR) of the α1a-AR reversed the binding affinity of the wild-type receptor toward that of the α1b-AR, particularly for oxymetazoline and methoxamine. Supporting our theory that a methionine (Leu314 → Met in the α1b-AR) is involved in inhibiting the interaction of valine with the phenyl ring of the agonists, Met293 → Leu (α1a-AR) relieved this inhibition, thus increasing the binding affinity for the agonists lacking ortho-substituents (epinephrine, norepinephrine, and phenylephrine) (Fig. 5A). In combination (Val18 → Ala and Met293 → Leu (α1a)) they had α1b-AR pharmacology, however there were still some residual differences with methoxamine and cirazoline (Fig. 5B). This indicates that there still may be other minor conformational differences in the agonist ligand binding pocket of the α1a-AR due to other nonconserved amino acids. However, the reversal of these mutations supports our hypothesis that the Leu314 and Ala204 in the α1b-AR and their corresponding α1a-AR residues Val18 and Met293 are the most critical determinants of the differences in agonist binding between these two subtypes.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Previous work analyzing subtype specificity between the β1 and β2-AR (17Dixon R.A. Hill W.S. Candelore M.R. Rands E. Diehl R.E. Marshall M.S. Sigal I.S. Strader C.D. Proteins Struct. Funct. Genet. 1989; 6: 267-274Google Scholar) indicated that residues in the middle portion of the β-AR sequence, particularly around transmembrane regions 4 and 5, contribute predominantly to the subtype-specific binding of agonists. However, no single residue substitution appeared to be capable of altering the subtype specificity of the receptor. Analysis of an extensive number of chimeric β1 and β2 receptors functionally expressed in Escherichia coli(18Marullo S. Emorine L.J. Strosberg A.D. Delavier-Klutchko L. EMBO J. 1990; 9: 1471-1476Google Scholar) demonstrated that each of 11 selective ligands appeared to define its own ligand binding subsite. In contrast, our results indicate that at least for agonist binding, discrete amino acid interactions can account for subtype selectivity. From our data we were able to model the subtype differences between their agonist binding pockets (Fig. 6, A and B). It appears that when an agonist is docked into the binding pocket, the presence of a hydrophobic ortho substituent on the phenyl ring will interact with the bulkier methionine residue at position 293 on the α1a-AR (Leu314 on the α1b-AR) thus increasing binding affinity significantly. Similarly the larger hydrophobic valine residue in the α1a-AR at position 185 (Ala204 in the α1b-AR) interacts directly with the phenyl ring. For agonists with an ortho hydrophobic substituent as with cirazoline, oxymetazoline, and methoxamine, the effect of these two residues is additive conferring upon the α1a-AR increased binding affinity. In the absence of the ortho group (phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine) Met293 (α1a) sterically hinders Val18 (α1a) from interacting with the phenyl ring, thus there is no increase in affinity. These two residues in combination differentiate the agonist binding pocket of these two α1-AR subtypes. The metahydroxyl group appears to interact with the Ser211 as there was no difference in binding affinity between the wild-type α1b-AR and Ser208 (α1b) for phenylephrine, which contains only a metahydroxyl group. Thus each agonist docks into the ligand binding pocket in a tilted manner. From our data we have defined two important residues that are critical in differentiating the ligand binding pocket between two α1-AR receptor subtypes. We are able to model the interaction between these two residues and in so doing have provided a rational basis for the design of better subtype-selective agonists to allow optimal binding and receptor activation We thank F.

Iron storage proteins are found in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes where they are thought to store excess iron in a non-toxic form and provide a reserve of iron for utilization in cellular metabolism (Theil, 1987). They are composed of 24 structurally identical subunits of Mr approximately 19,000, which assemble to form a spherical shell surrounding a central cavity where up to 4500 iron atoms can be sequestered as a ferric oxide-hydroxide-phosphate core (Ford et al., 1984). The deposition of ferric iron in the storage cavity is preceded by the oxidation of ferrous iron, which is mediated by the ferroxidase activity of the storage protein. Two types of iron storage protein are known: the ferritins of animals, plants, fungi, and bacteria; and the bacterioferritins, so far only found in bacteria. Similar three-dimensional structures have been deduced for human H-chain, horse spleen, rat liver, Escherichia coli, and bullfrog ferritins, and for the bacterioferritin (BFR) 1The abbreviations used are: BFRbacterioferritinapoBFRBFR lacking non-heme ironPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresisMes2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acidMCDmagnetic circular dichroismEPRelectron paramagnetic resonance. of E. coli (Lawson et al., 1991; Ford et al., 1984; Thomas et al., 1988; Hempstead et al., 1994; Trikha et al., 1994; Frolow et al., 1994). Each subunit comprises a bundle of four long α helices (A to D) and a short helix (E), which together account for approximately 75% of the total secondary structure. The ferroxidase activity of mammalian ferritins is due to an active site (the ferroxidase center) in the middle of the four-helix bundle of each H-chain subunit where a dinuclear iron species is thought to form (Lawson et al., 1989, 1991). Key amino acid residues in the ferroxidase centers of ferritins are conserved in bacterioferritins, suggesting that BFR possesses a ferroxidase center similar to that of H-chain ferritins (Andrews et al., 1991; Grossman et al., 1992). This suggestion has been confirmed by studies on iron uptake by wild-type BFR and site-directed variants of BFR (Le Brun et al., 1993, 1995), and is supported by the presence of a dinuclear metal-binding site at the ferroxidase center in the BFR crystal structure (Frolow et al., 1994). bacterioferritin BFR lacking non-heme iron polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid magnetic circular dichroism electron paramagnetic resonance. Although ferritins and bacterioferritins have similar structures and functions, they possess only 17% amino acid sequence identity and are therefore distantly related in evolution (Andrews et al., 1991). Furthermore, bacterioferritins differ from ferritins in possessing heme b prosthetic groups (up to 12 groups/24 subunits), which have a very low redox potential that depends on the presence (−475 mV) or absence (−225 mV) of an iron core (Watt et al., 1986). Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), electron-paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, extended x-ray absorption fine structure, and x-ray crystallographic studies have shown that the heme iron of the bacterioferritins has a unique bis-methionine ligation (Cheesman et al., 1990, 1992; George et al., 1993; Frolow et al., 1994). Modeling studies suggested that the E. coli BFR possesses two potential heme-binding sites (site I and site II), each containing a pair of methionine residues correctly disposed to bind heme (Cheesman et al., 1993). Site I is an intrasubunit site near the outer molecular surface with heme iron ligands Met31 and Met86 (24 heme sites/24 subunits), and site II is an intersubunit site near the inner surface with ligands Met52 and Met52 from diad-related neighboring subunits (12 sites/24 subunits). The validity of site II has recently been confirmed by x-ray crystallography (Frolow et al., 1994). However, neither Met31, Met52, nor Met31 is replaced by Leu in the BFR of Nitrobacter winogradskyi, Met52 is substituted by Thr in both the BFR of Synechocystis PCC 6803 and the BFR α-subunit of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Met86 is replaced by Gln in the BFR of both Mycobacterium leprae and M. avium (Kurokawa et al., 1989; Laulhère et al., 1991; Moore et al., 1994; Pessolani et al., 1994; Inglis et al., 1994). This paper describes the effects of substituting the three potential heme-ligating methionine residues of E. coli BFR and demonstrates that whereas Met31 and Met86 are not involved in heme binding, Met52 substitution generates a heme-free protein. Iron uptake studies of two heme-free variants show that the heme group is not essential for the ferroxidase activity of BFR. Oligonucleotides were made on an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer. The α-[35S]thio-dATP was supplied by Amersham International; restriction enzymes, T4 polynucleotide kinase, and DNA ligase were from Northumbria Biologicals Limited; and DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment) was from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. The strains of E. coli were: JM101 (thi, supE, ΔproAB-lac/F‘ traD36, proA+B+, lacIqZΔM15) (Messing, 1983) for propagating bacteriophage-M13mp18 derivatives for nucleotide sequence analysis and as the host for pUC119-derived phagemids, JRG2157 (JM101 Δbfr::kan) (Hudson et al., 1993) as the host for overproducing BFR variants, and BW313 (dut, ung, thi, relA, spoT/F‘ lysA) (Kunkel et al., 1985) for preparing uracil-incorporated single-stranded DNA templates for site-directed mutagenesis. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed by the single-primer method (Kunkel et al., 1985). The target for mutagenesis was a single-stranded M13mp18 derivative containing the 4.9- kilobase pair EcoRI-HindIII bfr fragment from the plasmid pGS280 (Andrews et al., 1989). Single-stranded DNA was prepared according to Sanger et al.(1980) using E. coli strain BW313 as the host and uridine (0.25 μg/ml) in the growth medium. The mutagenic oligonucleotide primers were phosphorylated and annealed to the template by heating to 70°C for 10 min and cooling at room temperature before use in the primer-extension ligation reaction. The extension-ligation mixture was transfected into JM101(ung+), and progeny phage were screened by single-channel tracking and nucleotide sequence analysis using the Sequenase DNA sequencing kit (U. S. Biochemical Corp.) and buffer-gradient gels (Biggin et al., 1983). Three mixed-site mutagenic primers were used to direct the following substitutions (binding coordinates from Andrews et al., 1989): S268, Met31} His or Leu (5′d(CAT GCC CGA C(A/T)C TTT AAA AAC TGG)-3′; 592-615); S269, Met52} His or Leu (5′d(ATT GAT GAG C(A/T)C AAA CAC GCC)-3′; 655-675); and S270, Met86} His or Leu (5′d(TT GAG GAA C(A/T)C CTG CGT TCT GAT C)-3′; 758-781). The nucleotide sequences of the primers are identical to the corresponding bfr sequence except for the mismatches (bold uppercase letters: C(A/T)C) in the Met codon (ATG) designed to direct amino acid substitutions. The complete bfr nucleotide sequence of each identified mutant was determined and verified. Double-stranded replicative form DNA was prepared for each verified mutant in order to subclone the 1.2-kilobase pair EcoRI-PstI bfr fragment into the corresponding sites of pUC119. The mutated bfr genes were expressed from the natural bfr promoter (Andrews et al., 1993). Derivatives of the high copy phagemid, pUC119, carrying the mutated bfr genes were used to transform a BFR-free derivative of JM101, JRG2157 (Δbfr::kan). The resultant overproducing strains were grown aerobically for 16 h at 37°C in L-broth containing 150 μg/ml ampicillin. The BFR-variants were purified using either the method described previously (Method 1; Andrews et al., 1993) or a variation of this method (Method 2) with the following modifications; buffer C (20 mM Hepes, pH 7.8, 100 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol) was used in place of phosphate-buffered saline (buffer A; pH 7.2), and anion-exchange chromatography was performed with a Protein-Pak Q (20 × 100 mm) column from Waters (in place of the Q-Sepharose column) equilibrated with buffer C (instead of 20 mM histidine, pH 5.5) and eluted at 2.5 ml/min with a 300-ml linear gradient of 0.0-0.1 M (NH4)2SO4 in buffer C. Purity was assessed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (Laemmli, 1970). Iron was assayed by the method of Drysdale and Munro(1965) with 1% ferrozine instead of 0.5% 2,2′-bipyridine. Protein was measured as described by Lowry et al.(1951) with bovine serum albumin as standard. The absolute concentration of pure BFR was determined using a Waters Pico-Tac amino acid analysis system. Heme was assayed using the pyridine hemeochromogen method (Falk, 1964). Iron was removed from BFR by reduction with sodium dithionite (Bauminger et al., 1991). Iron was incorporated by the aerobic addition of 10 mM ferrous ammonium sulfate (freshly prepared in deoxygenated ultrapure water) to wild-type and variant apobacterioferritins (0.5 μM final concentration) in 100 mM Hepes (pH 7.1). Absorbance changes were measured using an Applied Photo Physics stopped flow apparatus. Iron uptake experiments were performed at 30°C. EPR spectra were measured with an X-band spectrometer (Bruker ER200D with an ESP 1600 computer system) fitted with a liquid helium flow cryostat (Oxford Instruments plc; ESR9). Ultraviolet-visible spectra were obtained using a Carey 3E or a Unicam UV4 spectrophotometer. Difference spectra between iron-containing and iron-free BFR were obtained following the addition of 11.2 μl of 10 mM ferrous ammonium sulfate to the sample cuvette containing 0.7 mg of apoprotein in 1 ml and the addition of an equal volume of H2O to an identical sample in the reference cuvette. A zero base line was obtained prior to addition of iron. Electrospray mass spectrometry was performed with BFR (20 pg/ml in 5% formic acid, 50% acetonitrile) by David Towers (Department of Chemistry, Sheffield University) using a VG Platform spectrometer. Analytical gel permeation chromatography was performed using a Waters 625 HPLC and a Protein Pak 300SW (0.8 × 300 mm) column at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min in 200 mM Mes buffer (pH 6.5). The three putative heme iron-ligating methionine residues were changed, individually, to leucine or histidine. The Met } Leu substitutions should minimize structural perturbation in the altered proteins, whereas the Met } His substitutions could provide alternative heme iron ligands that should be detectable by EPR and MCD spectroscopy, thus allowing the unambiguous assignment of the heme ligands. The strategy for mutagenesis involved the use of mutagenic primers containing mixed sites each designed to generate two missense mutations (ATG } CAC or CTC; Met } His or Leu). Nucleotide sequence analysis of 150 potential mutants identified 22 valid mutants representing five of the six desired classes. The Met86} His class was not recovered, nor was it further sought since studies with the BFR-M86L variant showed that Met86 is not involved in heme ligation. EcoRI-PstI fragments containing mutated bfr genes were subcloned into pUC119 generating plasmids pGS725-729, as listed in Table 1. The mutated bfr genes were then overexpressed in transformants of the BFR-free strain, JRG2157, so that the overproduced BFR variants were not contaminated with wild-type protein. The overproducing strains were grown to late stationary phase and harvested. Bacterial pellets containing BFR-M31H, -M31L, and -M86L were pink due to their high content of heme-containing BFR, whereas those containing BFR-M52H and -M52L were beige (the normal color for E. coli), indicating that the Met52 variants have a low heme content. Densitometric analysis of Coomassie Blue-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels showed that the BFR variants represent 6-12% of total cell protein, which is somewhat lower than for wild-type BFR (18%; Table 1). The different degrees of overproduction may be due to the codon changes associated with the missense mutations. The iron contents of the overproducing strains were higher than that of the control strain by between 0.011 and 0.031%, dry cell weight (Table 1), presumably due to relatively high amounts of BFR-associated iron in the overproducers. The increase in cellular iron contents (extra whole cell iron; Table 1) was greater for the strains containing BFR-M52H and BFR-M52L (0.031 and 0.021%, dry cell weight, respectively) than for the strains containing the other BFR variants (approximately 0.012%) (Table 1). The BFR-M52-overproducing strains had much higher extra whole cell iron:BFR ratios than the other overproducing strains (Table 1), suggesting a higher iron content for the BFR-M52 variants relative to the other variants and wild-type BFR (see below).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The BFR variants and wild-type BFR were initially purified using Method 1. The BFR variants resembled the wild-type protein in being heat stable (65°C for 15 min) and in eluting as 500-kDa proteins from a gel permeation column. However, during anion-exchange chromatography at pH 5.5 in 20 mM histidine buffer, the elution pattern of BFR-M52L was markedly different from those of the other variants and the wild-type protein. Approximately 80% of the BFR-M52L sample (A280 nm) eluted in peak 1 (at 75-110 mM NaCl) and only 20% in peak 2 (at 130 to 200 mM NaCl), whereas wild-type BFR (and the other variants) eluted mainly (88%) in peak 2 with a smaller proportion (12%) in peak 1 (results not shown). SDS-PAGE analysis confirmed that peaks 1 and 2 correspond to BFR and absorbance measurements at 418 nm showed that the main component of peak 1 is heme-free BFR for both the wild-type and variant preparations, whereas peak 2 possessed heme for the wild-type, BFR-M31, and BFR-M86 samples but not for the BFR-M52 samples. Non-denaturing PAGE indicated that the heme-free BFR in peak 1 is in a disassembled form because it only contained the high mobility subunit monomer (Andrews et al., 1993), and that BFR in peak 2 is mostly in the 24-meric state. These findings suggest that, during anion-exchange chromatography, a small proportion of BFR dissociates into individual subunits with the concomitant loss of any associated heme, and that BFR-M52L is more susceptible to this dissociation. Since Met52 projects into the interface between symmetry-related subunits (Frolow et al., 1994), it is possible that the Met52} Leu substitution causes a destabilization of interactions along the two-fold axis resulting in the increased susceptibility of BFR-M52L to dissociation. In order to isolate BFR-M52L in its fully assembled state, a modified purification protocol was employed (Method 2) in which 20 mM Hepes (pH 7.8) was used in place of 20 mM histidine (pH 5.5) for anion-exchange chromatography. Under the new conditions, both BFR-M52L and the wild-type protein eluted from the anion-exchange column in single peaks (at 25-50 mM ammonium sulfate) as fully assembled proteins, as indicated by analytical gel permeation chromatography (results not shown). The analyses of BFR-M52L, described below, were performed using the preparation purified via Method 2. The subunit masses of the purified BFR variants estimated by electrospray-mass spectroscopy were within +3 and −6 daltons of the predicted masses (Table 2) and are therefore consistent with the genetically engineered substitutions. The iron contents of BFR-M31H, BFR-M31L, and BFR-M86L were similar to that of wild-type BFR (Table 2). However, the Met52 variants possessed 4-11-fold higher iron contents than the other bacterioferritins. These high iron contents resulted in the high extra whole cell iron:BFR ratios for the BFR-M52-overproducing strains (Table 1), as described above.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The ultraviolet-visible spectra of the wild-type and variant apo- (non-heme iron-free) proteins confirmed that the Met52 variants lack heme, whereas the Met31 and Met86 variants possess high heme contents (Fig. 1A and Table 2). The spectra of the Met31 and Met86 variants were very similar to that of the wild-type protein (Fig. 1A) with absorption peaks at 418, 525, and 560 nm associated with the Soret, β, and α bands of the oxidized heme moiety. No heme-associated absorption peaks were detected in the spectra of the Met52 variants, even at high sensitivity, indicating that they are completely free of heme. The spectra of the iron-containing proteins were similar to those of the apoproteins, except for higher absorptions at 280 nm (Fig. 1B), which were directly related to the iron contents of the proteins. The spectra of the Met52 variants possessed a minor peak at approximately 475 nm that has not previously been reported for bacterioferritins or ferritins (Fig. 1C). The 475 nm absorbance peak disappeared from the spectra of the BFR-M52 variants upon reduction with sodium dithionite or upon removal of associated iron, suggesting that it arises from a non-heme ferric iron species. This was confirmed by the reappearance of the 475 nm absorbance band following addition of ferrous iron (50 iron atoms/BFR molecule) to aerobic solutions of apoBFR-M52H (Fig. 1D). Initially, it was not possible to determine whether a similar component is present in the spectra of native (iron-containing) heme-containing bacterioferritins because of the high intensity heme absorption band that obscures the relevant region of the spectrum (Fig. 1C). However, the difference spectrum of the iron-loaded (50 iron atoms/molecule) and apo forms of BFR revealed minor absorption bands at 427 and 475 nm, showing that the 475 nm-absorbing component forms in both the heme-containing and non-heme-containing protein upon iron uptake (Fig. 1D). A similar weak absorption band (at 470 nm) has been reported in the absorption spectrum of castor stearoyl-ACP Δ9 desaturase and was assigned to the Fe-O-Fe center of the enzyme (Fox et al., 1994). It is possible that the 475 nm band of BFR also derives from a dinuclear iron center. The 427 nm peak observed in the BFR-difference spectrum (Fig. 1D) is consistent with a slight red shift in the position of the Soret band, suggesting that iron uptake results in a structural perturbation of the heme-binding region. A similar effect has been observed previously following an initial, and very rapid, 1 nm blue shift in the Soret band (Le Brun, 1993). The minor absorption peaks at 650 and 737 nm, observed previously with wild-type BFR (Andrews et al., 1993), were absent from the spectra of the Met52 variants (Fig. 1E), indicating that these bands are heme associated. This is consistent with the assignment of the MCD spectrum of bis-methionine low spin ferric heme (Cheesman et al., 1993). The 10 K EPR spectrum of apoBFR (Fig. 2A) contains signals at g = 2.88, 2.31, and 1.45, which have previously been assigned to the S = 1/2 low spin ferric heme groups of the protein (Cheesman et al., 1991). The EPR spectra of apoBFR-M31H, -M31L, and -M86L (Fig. 2, B-D) each contain low spin ferric heme signals at g values equal to, or very close to, those of the wild-type protein. Hence, substitution of either Met31 or Met86 fails to produce any significant changes in the heme group g values. The low spin heme signals are absent in the spectra of the Met52 variants (Fig. 2, E and F), confirming the lack of heme in these proteins. The Met52 variant spectra contain a large feature at g = 4.28, which has previously been assigned to S = 5/2 high spin mononuclear Fe(III) bound at specific sites on the protein (Cheesman et al., 1992). Such signals are absent from the spectra of Fig. 2(A-D) because the non-heme iron has been removed. Previous studies of wild-type apoBFR at pH 6.5 revealed that the iron uptake process involves at least three distinct kinetic phases (Le Brun et al., 1993), and this led to the following hypothesis for the mechanism of iron uptake. In phase 1 (t ½ ~ 50 ms), two iron (II) ions bind at the ferroxidase center to form a dinuclear iron site. In phase 2 (t½ ~ 3 s), the two iron (II) ions are oxidized to iron (III) ions. If sufficient iron (II) is present, phase 3 (t½ ~ 5 min) occurs, in which there is a slow formation of iron core. To ensure that BFR-M52L remained fully assembled, the iron uptake properties of the Met52 variants and wild-type BFR were compared at pH 7.1 rather than pH 6.5. Adding 1000 iron (II) ions/apoBFR molecule at pH 7.1 gave similar overall rates of oxidation with all three proteins, when monitored at 340 nm (Fig. 3). Hence, loss of heme from the protein causes no major effect on catalytic activity. Indeed, a slight enhancement of catalytic activity was observed with BFR-M52H, although there was a slight decrease with BFR-M52L (Fig. 3). In order to resolve phases 2 and 3, it was necessary to measure iron uptake at lower iron (II):apoBFR ratios (between 10 and 133 Fe:BFR). For wild-type BFR, a single phase (phase 2) was observed at iron (II):BFR ratios of <50, whereas two distinct phases (corresponding to phases 2 and 3) were observed at ratios >50 (Fig. 4A). Phase 2 is shown more clearly in the plot of the initial 5 s of the reaction (Fig. 4B). The amplitude of phase 2 was obtained by fitting each trace to a first order process. A plot of phase 2 amplitude as a function of added iron (II) indicates that saturation occurs at a level of approximately 48 iron (II) ions/BFR molecule (Fig. 4C). These data are consistent with previous measurements at pH 6.5 (Le Brun et al., 1993). However, at pH 7.1 the observed rate of phase 2, measured at a ratio of 50 iron (II) ions:BFR (0.5 μM BFR concentration, 30°C), was 0.55 ± 0.05 s-1, while at pH 6.5 the rate was slower, 0.17 ± 0.05 s-1. The data for BFR-M52H also show a single phase at iron (II):BFR ratios of <50, whereas two distinct phases can be distinguished at ratios of >50 (Fig. 4D). The kinetic parameters of the latter differ from those of wild-type BFR, but they clearly correspond to phases 2 and 3. This is more apparent in Fig. 4(E and F), where phase 2 is saturated at approximately 48 iron (II) ions/BFR-M52H, as for the wild-type protein. The observed rate of phase 2 for BFR-M52H, measured at a ratio of 50 iron (II) ions:BFR-M52H was 1.9 ± 0.1 s-1, which is 3.5-fold higher than that measured for wild-type BFR under similar conditions. Despite this, the two phases for BFR-M52H are less well resolved than in wild-type BFR, indicating that phase 3 also proceeds at an enhanced rate relative to wild-type, as shown in Fig. 3. Results for BFR-M52L again show a single fast phase at iron (II):BFR-M52L ratios of <50, while at higher ratios, two distinct phases are observed (Fig. 4, G and H). However, the two phases appear to be less well resolved than for wild-type BFR and BFR-M52H, such that saturation of phase 2 is not obvious. The initial 1.3-s traces were fitted to a first order process and the resultant amplitude plotted against iron (II):BFR-M52L ratio. This plot shows that phase 2 saturation occurs at approximately 48 iron (II) ions/BFR-M52L (Fig. 4I). The rate of phase 2 for the addition of 50 iron (II) ions/BFR-M52L was 1.2 ± 0.1 s-1, approximately 2-fold greater than that observed in wild-type BFR, but slightly lower than that for BFR-M52H. The iron uptake properties of wild-type BFR measured at pH 7.1 are qualitatively identical to those observed at pH 6.5 (Le Brun et al., 1993), but a considerable enhancement of the rate of phases 1 (data not shown) and 2 is observed at the higher pH. This pH effect could be due to the need to deprotonate a residue (or residues) at the ferroxidase center during the binding of iron (II) in phase 1. The iron uptake properties of the two Met52 variants show that there is no significant effect on the overall catalytic activity of the protein as a result of the lack of heme. Differences between wild-type BFR and the Met52 variants are observed in the relative rates of the two oxidation phases; these are clearly resolved in wild-type, but are increasingly less well resolved in BFR-M52H and BFR-M52L. Hence, saturation of the first oxidation phase, phase 2, was more difficult to detect in the Met52 variants. The complete lack of heme in the BFR-M52 variants confirms that Met52 serves as the heme iron ligand (Cheesman et al., 1990; George et al., 1993; Frolow et al., 1994). It further shows that heme binds within a pocket at the intersubunit two-fold axis as previously proposed by model building (Andrews et al., 1991; Cheesman et al., 1993; Grossman et al., 1992) and subsequently shown by x-ray crystallography (Frolow et al., 1994). The present studies also show that Met31 and Met86 do not participate in heme iron ligation in BFR. This excludes the existence of the intrasubunit heme sites discussed by Grossman et al. (1992) and Cheesman et al.(1993) as alternative possibilities to the Met52 site. The location of the BFR heme site between two-fold related subunits is novel for a hemoprotein, and its proximity to both the dinuclear iron site and the iron core in the central cavity raises the possibility of heme-mediated redox interactions between these iron centers. The Met52} His replacement in BFR resulted in a heme-free protein, despite the fact that histidine residues act as coaxial heme iron ligands in many other hemoproteins. The failure of His52 to replace Met as a functional heme ligand probably stems from the importance of Met52 in mediating the tight fit of the heme at its binding site in BFR (Met52 contributes 58 of the 108 reported van der Waals contacts between heme and the protein) (Frolow et al., 1994). Met52 is conserved in the bacterioferritins of E. coli, Azotobacter vinelandii, M. leprae, P. aeruginosa (subunit β), and M. avium, but not Synechocystis PCC 6803 or the α subunit of P. aeruginosa BFR where the corresponding residue in both cases is Thr (Andrews et al., 1989; Grossman et al., 1992; Inglis et al., 1994; Laulhère et al., 1991; Pessolani et al., 1994; Moore et al., 1994). However, despite the absence of Met52, the purified Synechocystis and P. aeruginosa bacterioferritins contain heme (6 and 3-9 hemes/24 subunits, respectively). The reason for the apparent discrepancy is uncertain. A possible explanation arises from the observation that Synechocystis and P. aeruginosa bacterioferritins, unlike the other bacterioferritins so far sequenced, possess a methionine at position 48. This has led to the suggestion that Met48 could function as a heme ligand in the absence of Met52 (Moore et al., 1994). The assembly of E. coli BFR at physiological pH was not affected by the lack of heme and the Met52 substitutions. Furthermore, the overproduced heme-free variants acquired more iron in vivo than the overproduced heme-containing bacterioferritins, showing that heme is unnecessary for the intracellular uptake of iron by BFR. The relatively high in vivo iron content of the Met52 variants indicates that they either have higher iron uptake activities or reduced rates of iron release in vivo. The results show that heme is also unnecessary for the uptake of iron by BFR in vitro. This is not surprising, since the heme iron does not undergo redox cycling when iron (II) and dioxygen are the substrates for the iron loading of BFR (Le Brun et al., 1993). The Met52 substitutions and absence of heme resulted in a more rapid (2-3.5-fold) oxidation of Fe(II) at the ferroxidase centers during phase 2 of iron loading. The differences in the phase 2 and 3 rates of iron loading of the two Met52 variants presumably relates to the nature of the replacement amino acid residues (His or Leu). The effects of the Met52 substitutions on phases 2 and 3 may be explained by the close proximity of residue 52 to the ferroxidase center. The heme group lies at the interface between a pair of two-fold related subunits. A pair of methionine residues, Met52 and Met52, from two-fold related subunits act as the coaxial heme ligands, as shown by the x-ray structure (Frolow et al., 1994) and confirmed by the mutagenesis results reported here. The adjacent residue, Glu51, provides a carboxylate side chain that can bridge two divalent metal ions, such as iron (II), bound at the ferroxidase center of BFR.2 Therefore, the substitution of residue 52 might be expected to have an affect on the coordinating ability of Glu51. The binding of iron (II) ions at the ferroxidase center of wild-type BFR causes a perturbation of the heme absorption spectrum (Le Brun et al., 1993), suggesting that there is interaction between the heme-binding site (which includes Met52) and the dinuclear metal binding site (which includes Glu51). The present work provides further support for interaction between these two metal centers. Previous studies have shown that the incorporation of heme into mammalian ferritins increases the rate at which iron can be reduced and released from the core by enhancing the delivery of electrons from electron donors through the protein shell to the core (Kadir et al., 1992). It is therefore possible that the high in vivo iron contents of the Met52 variants are due to inefficient iron release from the proteins resulting from their lack of heme. However, the true function of the hemes within BFR is still uncertain. Although the hemes appear not to be required for iron oxidation or for assembly of the protein, the replacement of Met52 and absence of heme do influence the amount of iron accumulated in vivo. Whether or not the in vivo rate of iron accumulation is significantly affected by the Met52 substitutions remains to be determined, as does the possibility that the hemes are involved in iron core reduction and iron release. The availability of the BFR-Met52 variants should now allow the initiation of further studies aimed at defining the function of heme in BFR and providing a deeper insight into the physiological role of BFR in E. coli and other bacteria"

We have recently shown that both SHC and IRS-1 interact with the tyrosine-phosphorylated NPEY motif of the IR and insulin-like growth factor I receptor via non-SH2 domains (Gustafson, T. A., He, W., Craparo, A., Schaub, C. D., and O'Neill, T. J.(1995) Mol. Cell. Biol. 15, 2500-2508; O'Neill, T. J., Craparo, A., and Gustafson, T. A.(1994) Mol. Cell.

In this study we characterize these interactions by examining the effects of 18 amino acid substitutions within and around the IR NPEY motif upon interaction with SHC and IRS-1. We confirm that Tyr-960 within the NPEY motif of the IR is essential for both IRS-1 and SHC interaction and that Asn-957 and Pro-958 are essential for IRS-1 interaction and important but not critical for SHC interaction. Additional mutations surrounding the NPEY motif revealed completely distinct patterns of interaction for SHC and IRS-1. Specifically, mutation of Leu-952 or Tyr-953 (at positions −7 and −8 from Tyr-960) markedly reduced IRS-1 interaction but had no effect upon SHC interaction. Likewise, mutation of Ala-963 (+3) reduced IRS-1 but not SHC interaction. Conversely, substitution of Leu-961 (+1) with either Ala or Arg reduced SHC interaction by 70 and 90%, respectively, yet had no effect upon interaction with IRS-1. Our data show that the sequences within and surrounding the NPEY contribute differentially to either SHC or IRS-1 recognition.

https://openalex.org/W2018188543,"Transient transfection of expression vectors for various members of the hematopoietin receptor family and STAT proteins into COS-1 cells indicated that each receptor was capable of stimulating the DNA binding activity of STAT1, STAT3, and STAT5B. However, gp130 preferentially activated STAT1 and STAT3. Activation of STAT5B differed from that of the other two in that the box 3 sequence motif in the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 was not required. Moreover, STAT5B and STAT3 enhanced gene transcription via separate regulatory elements. This study has identified two potential signal transduction pathways by which hematopoietin receptors, including the interleukin-6 receptor, control transcription of acute phase plasma protein genes in hepatic cells.

However, gp130 preferentially activated STAT1 and STAT3. Activation of STAT5B differed from that of the other two in that the box 3 sequence motif in the cytoplasmic domain of gp130 was not required. Moreover, STAT5B and STAT3 enhanced gene transcription via separate regulatory elements.

https://openalex.org/W1984142065,"Cellular responses initiated by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) are mediated by two different cell surface receptors with respective molecular masses of 55 kDa (p55) and 75 kDa (p75). p55 is functional in almost every cell type and can independently transmit most biological activities of TNF. In contrast, TNF signaling via p75 seems so far largely restricted to cells of lymphoid origin, where it can induce proliferation, cytokine production, and/or apoptosis. The mechanisms that regulate TNF receptor activity are largely unknown. Here we report that the p75 of unstimulated p75-responsive PC60 T cells is phosphorylated on serine by a kinase activity present in p75 immune complexes. Several lines of evidence indicate that the latter kinase is casein kinase-1 (CK-1). Previous results have shown that the p75 TNF receptor is constitutively phosphorylated in vivo. Our data show that the latter in vivo phosphorylation is also at least partially due to CK-1. Pretreatment of cells with TNF had no detectable effect on p75 phosphorylation in vitro or in vivo. However, a specific CK-1 inhibitor potentiated TNF-induced apoptosis mediated by p75, suggesting an inhibitory role for phosphorylation by CK-1. Although in vivo p75 phosphorylation could be seen in both p75-unresponsive and p75-responsive cell lines, in vitro p75 phosphorylation in p75 coimmunoprecipitates could not be observed in cell lines that were biologically unresponsive to p75 stimulation. The latter observation further indicates a regulatory role for p75 phosphorylation in p75-mediated signaling. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the p75 TNF receptor is phosphorylated and associated with CK-1, which negatively regulates p75-mediated TNF signaling.

The effects of inhibitors indicated the involvement of one or more serine proteinases in human neutrophil migration and shape change in response to a chemoattractant. Monospecific antibodies, chloromethylketone inhibitors, and reactive-site mutants of α1-antitrypsin and α1-antichymotrypsin were used to probe the specificity of the proteinases involved in chemotaxis. Antibodies specific for cathepsin G inhibited chemotaxis. Moreover, rapid inhibitors of cathepsin G and α-chymotrypsin suppressed neutrophil chemotaxis to the chemoattractants N-formyl-L-methionyl-L-leucyl-L-phenylalanine (fMLP) and zymosan-activated serum in multiple blind well assays and to fMLP in migration assays under agarose. The concentrations of antichymotrypsin mutants that reduced chemotaxis by 50% would inactivate free cathepsin G with a half-life of 1.5-3 s, whereas the concentrations of chloromethylketones required to produce a similar inhibition of chemotaxis would inactivate cathepsin G with a half-life of 345 s. These data suggest different modes of action for these two classes of inhibitors. Indeed the chloromethylketone inhibitors of cathepsin G (Z-Gly-Leu-Phe-CMK) and to a lesser extent of chymotrypsin (Cbz-Gly-Gly-Phe-CMK) mediated their effect by preventing a shape change in the purified neutrophils exposed to fMLP. Antichymotrypsin did not affect shape change in response to fMLP even at concentrations that were able to reduce neutrophil chemotaxis by 50%. These results support the involvement of cell surface proteinases in the control of cell migration and show that antichymotrypsin and chloromethylketones have differing modes of action.

In the present study we demonstrate that recombinant human BM-40 can be modified with [3H]putrescine in a 1:1 molar ratio by transglutaminaseC (tissue transglutaminase). Residues Gln3 and Gln4 were identified as major amine acceptor sites. This was confirmed with several mutant proteins, including deletions in the N-terminal domain I of BM-40, site-directed mutagenesis of the reactive glutamines, and fusion of the seven-amino acid-long N-terminal sequence (APQQEAL) to an unrelated protein. The results showed that the N-terminal target site is sufficient for modification by transglutaminase but at a low level. For high efficiency amine incorporation an intact domain I is required. The conservation of at least one of the transglutaminase target glutamines in the known vertebrate BM-40 sequences and their absence in an invertebrate homologue point to an important, but yet unknown, role of this modification in vertebrates.

In the present study we have identified Gln3 and Gln4 within domain I as the amine acceptor sites in BM-40 for transglutaminaseC-catalyzed cross-linking with the primary amine putrescine. The interaction of transglutaminase with BM-40 was analyzed by introducing mutations into domain I. The results indicated that the N-terminal sequence APQQEAL alone is sufficient for modification by transglutaminase but that the complete domain I of the protein is required for efficient modification. TransglutaminaseC was purified from guinea pig liver(27Connellan J.M. Chung S.I. Whetzel N.K. Bradley L.M. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1971; 246: 1093-1098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).

Constructs for two novel BM-40 mutants were prepared by polymerase chain reaction according to the suppliers instructions (Perkin-Elmer) using a human cDNA encoding BM-40 inserted into the Bluescript vector(28Nischt R.

Oligonucleotide primers 5′-GATCGCTAGCAAATCCCTGCCAGAAC and 5′-GATCCTCGAGTTAGATCACAAGATCC were used to amplify a 725-bp fragment encoding amino acids 53-286 of BM-40 in order to produce mutant ΔI which lacks the entire domain I. Primer 5′-GATCGCTAGCAGAAGCCCTGCCTGAT and the second primer (see above) were used to amplify an 869-bp fragment encoding amino acids 3-286 of BM-40 for the production of the mutant QQ3,4-LA containing two amino acid substitutions. Restriction fragments, obtained by digestion with Nhel and XhoI, were purified by agarose gel electrophoresis and ligated to the short version of the BM-40 signal peptide Bluescript construct as described previously(29Mayer U.

Correct ligation and in-frame insertion of the fragments was verified by DNA sequencing. The complete inserts were then cut out by digestion with XbaI and XhoI and ligated into the XbaI/XhoI site of the eukaryotic expression vector pCis(31Gorman C. Gies D.R. McGray G. DNA Protein Eng.

The recombinant proteins were purified from serum-free culture medium on DEAE-cellulose and Superose 12 (HR 16/50, Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology Inc., Uppsala, Sweden) columns(25Pottgiesser J.

The purity of the proteins was analyzed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and by Edman degradation which verified the novel N-terminal sequence APLAEA for mutant QQ3,4-LA. Transglutaminase-catalyzed incorporation of [2,3-3H]putrescine (30.2 Ci/mmol, DuPont NEN) into substrate proteins was done for 45 min at 37°C as described previously(6Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. J Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 15308-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The specific incorporation of 3H label was calculated by subtracting the radioactivity in samples which had been incubated in the absence of substrate proteins or proteins known not to be transglutaminase substrates, i.e. guinea pig immunoglobulin γ and bovine serum albumin. Saturation experiments to determine the uptake of labeled putrescine per mol of recombinant BM-40 were done as described previously(6Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. J Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 15308-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Kinetic constants for putrescine incorporation into BM-40 and mutant γ1III3-5 were determined as described(32Gorman J.J. Folk J.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1981; 256: 2712-2715Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, rates of incorporation of [3H]putrescine into varying amounts of substrate protein were determined from reactions performed in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 7.4, 30 mM NaCl, 50 mM CaCl2, and 1 mM EDTA, at 25°C. The conditions were adjusted such that the incorporation was linear over a 10-min period. Putrescine was employed at a set high concentration (1 mM), a level which appeared to be saturating (data not shown). Kinetic constants were derived from fitting initial rates to the following equation. v=kcat[E]0[S]/(Km(app)+[S])(Eq. 1) Incorporation of [1,4-3H]putrescine (100 μCi/ml; 30.0 Ci/mmol, Amersham Corp., Amersham, United Kingdom) into recombinant BM-40 (10 μM, 1.5 mg) by transglutaminaseC (1 μM, 0.35 mg) was performed in 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.3, containing 5 mM CaCl2 and 18.9 μM putrescine (Serva Fine Biochemicals, Paramus, NJ), at 37°C for 45 min. The reaction was stopped by addition of EDTA to a final concentration of 25 mM, and the sample was dialyzed against 6 M guanidine HCl, 0.1 M Tris/HCl, pH 8.0. Radioactively labeled monomeric BM-40 was separated from oligomers and the enzyme by chromatography on a Superose 6 column (FPLC HR 10/30, Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology, Inc.) equilibrated in the same buffer at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min. The labeled protein was reduced and alkylated as described (33Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and digested with 0.26 μM trypsin (enzyme/substrate, 1:100 molar ratio) for 2.5 h at 37°C in 0.2 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate. The tryptic peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC on a C18 column (Nucleosil, Macherey & Nagel, Düren, Germany, 4 × 250 mm) using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent A) and 70% acetonitrile in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (solvent B) with a gradient of 0-90% B in 70 min at a flow rate of 1 ml/min. Fractions of 200 μl were collected, and 10% of each fraction was mixed with scintillation fluid (Rotiscint 22, Roth KG, Karlsruhe, Germany) and the radioactivity measured. The tryptic peptides of pool 1 were further cleaved with 1 μg of endoproteinase Asp-N (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany) for 16 h at 23°C in 0.2 M ammonium hydrogen carbonate. The tryptic peptides in pool 2 were further cleaved with 1 μg of endoproteinase Glu-C (Staphylococcus aureus SV8 protease, Boehringer Mannheim) for 5 h at 37°C in the same buffer. The resulting peptides were separated and the radioactivity determined as above. The recombinant mutant proteins γ1III3-5 and BM-40 QQ3,4-LA (150 μg; 8.3 and 5.0 nmol, respectively) were labeled with [2,3-3H]putrescine in the transglutaminase-catalyzed reaction at an enzyme/substrate molar ratio of 1:10 and the labeled monomeric proteins purified by molecular sieve chromatography on a Superose 6 column as described above. The labeled proteins were reduced and carboxymethylated under denaturing conditions and cleaved with endoproteinase Glu-C and trypsin, respectively, in 0.2 M ammonium carbonate at 23°C and an enzyme/substrate ratio of 1:100 for 16 h. The resulting peptides were separated by reversed phase HPLC and the radioactivity was determined as described above. Radioactive peptides were sequenced using the Applied Biosystems Sequencer model 470A according to the manufacturer's instructions. The small volume of phenylthiohydantion derivative samples left over after on-line injection was collected in the instrument's fraction collector and used for radioactivity determination as described. Protein concentrations were determined using the bicinchoninic acid reagent standard protocol as described by the supplier (Pierce) with bovine serum albumin as a standard or by amino acid analysis after hydrolysis with 6 M HCl (16 h, 110°C) on a LC3000 analyzer (Biotronik).

However, BM-40 can be isolated from rat skeletal tissues only in small amounts and under denaturing conditions, whereas the native conformation is required for the protein to act as a transglutaminase substrate(7Aeschlimann D. Wetterwald A. Fleisch H. Paulsson M. J. Cell Biol. 1993; 120: 1461-1470Crossref PubMed Scopus (167) Google Scholar). We therefore used the human recombinant protein, which has been shown to be fully native(28Nischt R. Pottgiesser J. Krieg T. Mayer U. Aumailley M. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1991; 200: 529-536Crossref PubMed Scopus (87) Google Scholar), to identify the target sites of transglutaminaseC action on this protein. [3H]Putrescine was incorporated into recombinant BM-40 by incubation with guinea pig liver transglutaminaseC in the presence of Ca2+(33Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine the maximum amount of [3H]putrescine which can be cross-linked to recombinant BM-40, the incorporation of label was driven to saturation by incubation with successively increasing amounts of unlabeled putrescine at a constant concentration of [3H]putrescine(6Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. J Biol Chem. 1991; 266: 15308-15317Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The results (Fig. 1) showed that approximately 1 mol of putrescine was incorporated per mol of protein. For identification of the target glutamine(s), the labeled monomeric protein was separated from oligomers and the enzyme by gel filtration under denaturing conditions, reduced and alkylated, and digested with trypsin. Separation of the tryptic peptides by reversed phase HPLC and determination of [3H]putrescine content in the fractions showed two peaks containing together about 90% of the applied label (Fig. 2A). Sequencing of these fractions showed that they contained a mixture of peptides with the N-terminal sequence of the protein as the predominant component in both pools. Pool 1 was further cleaved with endoproteinase Asp-N, and separation of the cleavage products by reversed phase HPLC revealed only one radioactive peak containing 84% of the applied label (Fig. 2B). This peak contained a long peptide starting with the N-terminal sequence APQQE and a short peptide comprising positions 212-221 (IFPVHWQFGQ). Determination of radioactivity in the residual volume of injection during sequencing showed 3H label in cycles 3 and 4, but not in cycles 7 and 10. This demonstrated that only Gln3 and Gln4 are substrate sites for transglutaminaseC. However, as the N-terminal peptide was too long to be sequenced entirely, the second radioactive pool of tryptic peptides, which apparently contained a similar labeled fragment, was further cleaved with endoproteinase Glu-C. The chromatogram of the reversed phase HPLC separations of these peptides showed one radioactive peak with 75% of the applied radioactivity (Fig. 2C). This peak contained only the peptide APQQEALPDETEVVEE, and label was again found only in cycles 3 and 4. The relative recoveries of radioactivity in cycle 3 and 4, corresponding to Gln3 and Gln4, varied in the different sequencer runs. Although with the long peptide of pool 1 slightly more radioactivity was found associated with Gln3 than Gln4, the reverse was true for the short peptide derived from cleavage of pool 2. The radioactivity released during sequencing in cycle 4, on the other hand, was too high to be explained by carryover of the phenylthiohydantoin-derivative from cycle 3. Therefore, [3H]putrescine was attached to either Gln3 or Gln4 of human BM-40 probably to a similar extent. However, because reversed phase HPLC could apparently not separate peptides labeled at either Gln3 or Gln4, we were always sequencing mixtures of both. Mutants were used to study the influence of structural changes in the N-terminal domain of BM-40 on putrescine incorporation (Fig. 3). In mutant QQ3,4-LA, the two target glutamines of intact BM-40 were replaced by Leu and Ala, respectively, whereas the rest of the molecule was unchanged. In mutant ΔI the entire N-terminal domain I of BM-40 was deleted. Mutant ΔN contained a deletion of residues 8-67, thus lacking most of domain I but retaining the first seven amino acids (APQQEAL) of intact BM-40. Finally, the first seven amino acids containing the two target glutamines were fused to an entirely different protein, domain III of the laminin γ1-chain, consisting of three EGF-like repeats in tandem (mutant γ1III3-5). When the mutants and intact BM-40 were labeled with [3H]putrescine under identical conditions, we found (Fig. 4) that mutant ΔI, which lacked the entire domain I, including the essential glutamines, was no longer able to incorporate the label. Mutant ΔN, which lacked most of domain I except the target sequence was still able to incorporate about 29% as much as intact BM-40. Mutant γ1III3-5, in which only the seven-amino acid-long target sequence of BM-40 was present, still incorporated 12% of the label found in intact BM-40. The substrate specificity factor, kcat/Km(app), for this reaction was 66 mM-1 min-1 (kcat = 156 ± 20 min-1, Km(app) = 2.35 ± 0.26 mM; mean of three experiments with each determination done in triplicate to measure the initial rates), whereas that for the reaction with BM-40 was 146 mM-1 min-1 (kcat = 3.53 ± 0.24 min-1, Km(app) = 0.0242 ± 0.0013 mM). Most interestingly, mutant QQ3,4-LA incorporated 23% as much label as intact BM-40, although both target glutamines were lacking. In order to determine the modified glutamines in these mutant proteins we isolated and digested the [3H]putrescine-labeled monomeric proteins. Mutant γ1III3-5 yielded several radioactive peaks after cleavage with trypsin and separation of the peptides by reversed phase HPLC. All of these peaks contained peptides of various length starting at the N-terminal sequence APQQ with a total yield of ~55% of the radioactivity applied to the column. Radioactivity was released only in sequencing cycles 3 and 4, indicating that [3H]putrescine was cross-linked to the same glutamine residues as in genuine BM-40. The [3H]putrescine-labeled mutant QQ3,4-LA was cleaved with endoproteinase Glu-C. When the resulting HPLC peaks were screened for radioactivity, only a single peak was found to be radioactive with a yield of about 40%. This peak included only one Gln-containing peptide, VSVGANPVQVE (residues 24-34), in addition to smaller amounts of the peptides RDEDNNLLTE, and DNNLLTE. Only cycle 9 released radioactivity, indicating that Gln32 was the residue labeled with [3H]putrescine. Human recombinant BM-40 was used to determine the amine incorporation site for transglutaminaseC-catalyzed modification. Proteolytic digestion of [3H]putrescine-labeled BM-40 yielded labeled peptides of variable length that were derived from the N terminus and had the label attached exclusively to Gln3 and Gln4. The transglutaminase did not show a clear preference for either of these glutamine residues but modified only one of them in each BM-40 molecule as indicated by the 1:1 ratio of putrescine incorporation under saturating conditions. Two adjacent glutamine residues were identified as amine acceptor sites in several other proteins, including fibronectin (34McDonagh R.P. McDonagh J. Petersen T.E. Thogersen H.C. Skorstengaard K.

Chem. 1988; 263: 18093-18098Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) using the keratinocyte enzyme (transglutaminaseK). Transglutaminases often show a preference for one of the two residues, although exclusive modification of one of the adjacent residues has not been observed with proteins (discussed in (33Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar)). However, in a study using short peptides patterned on the N-terminal sequence of fibronectin, EAQQIV, only the first Q has been shown to be an amine acceptor in the factor XIIIa or transglutaminaseC-catalyzed modification with monodansylcadaverine(39Parameswaran K.N. Velasco P.T. Wilson J. Lorand L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 8472-8475Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar). Both, Gln3 and Gln4 are conserved in human, mouse, bovine, and frog BM-40, whereas in rat and chicken only one of the two Gln residues is retained (Table 1). The BM-40 homologue from the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans lacks these glutamine residues as well as showing no significant overall sequence similarity in the N-terminal domain I(40Schwarzbauer J.E. Spencer C.S. Mol. Biol. Cell. 1993; 4: 941-952Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). The conservation in higher vertebrates of the unique N terminus of BM-40, which contains the transglutaminase cross-linking site and binding sites for Ca2+(24Maurer P. Mayer U. Bruch M. Jenö P. Mann K. Landwehr R. Engel J. Timpl R. Eur. J. Biochem. 1992; 205: 233-240Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar), suggests a specific function of this domain in these species. This could be related to the need for cross-linking of BM-40 in calcifying cartilaginous and osseous tissues, which are absent in almost all invertebrates.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab When the N-terminal sequence of BM-40 was grafted onto an entirely different protein, the EGF-like repeats 3-5 of domain III of laminin γ1-chain, this sequence was still modified by transglutaminaseC at the same glutamine sites as genuine BM-40, but the amount of label incorporated was distinctly reduced and the substrate specificity factor (kcat/Km(app)) was only half of that with recombinant BM-40 as a substrate. A drastic reduction in putrescine incorporation was also found with mutant ΔN, in which most of domain I of BM-40 was missing and the transglutaminase target site was directly connected to domain II. This shows that an N-terminal sequence of BM-40, consisting of seven amino acids, is sufficient to be recognized and modified. However, because the level of modification is much lower than with intact BM-40, the remainder of domain I also seems to play an important role in the interaction between transglutaminase and BM-40. Possibly other amino acids in this domain also contribute to enzyme recognition. The results with mutant QQ3,4-LA indicated that binding of the enzyme to domain I of BM-40 can give rise to the modification of another accessible Gln (Gln32) when the major target residues are lacking. However, the level of modification was significantly lower than for intact BM-40, indicating that the proper distance between the transglutaminase binding site and the target residue is crucial for efficient modification or that the proper conformation of the target sequence depends on the rest of domain I. No sequence similarity is apparent between the N-terminal target sequence and the immediate surroundings of Gln32, the substitute target in mutant QQ3,4-LA. However, the comparison of known transglutaminase target site sequences (33Aeschlimann D. Paulsson M. Mann K. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 11316-11321Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) does not reveal a clear sequence motif which may serve as a signal sequence for modification."

The UV endonuclease-associated N-glycosylase activity would cleave the N-glycosylic bond between the 5′ pyrimidine partner of the dimer and the corresponding deoxyribose moiety. Subsequently, an independent AP endonuclease activity would cleave the sugar-phosphate backbone on the 3′ side of the apyrimidinic sugar moiety. Grafstrom and co-workers (2Grafstrom R.H. Park L. Grossman L. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 13465-13474Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) modified this proposal by suggesting that the N-glycosylase and AP endonuclease activities both reside on the same UV endonuclease molecule. Characterization of an 18-kDa protein has shown that the UV endonuclease prefers thymine-containing dimers over cytosine-containing dimers (under conditions of substrate excess), double-stranded over single-stranded DNA, and apyrimidinic sites at the site of glycosylase action to simple apurinic or apyrimidinic residues(2Grafstrom R.H.

Of these functionally related enzymes, our laboratory is most familiar with the reaction mechanism of T4 endonuclease V. T4 endonuclease V employs its NH2-terminal, α-amino group in a nucleophilic attack of the C-1′ sugar carbon of the 5′ nucleotide within the dimer(15Schrock III, R.D. Lloyd R.S. J. Biol.

The existence of the resultant imino or Schiff base intermediate can be verified experimentally by demonstrating both that cyanide can inhibit the enzyme in a substrate-dependent manner (17Dixon M.

The imino intermediate may or may not undergo a subsequent β-elimination reaction that follows a syn stereochemical course to generate a trans 3′-α,β-unsaturated aldehyde and a 5′-phosphate product(20Manoharan M.

The β-elimination step of endonuclease III, like that of T4 endonuclease V, follows a syn stereochemical course. Thus, a unified catalytic mechanism for the N-glycosylase/AP lyases has emerged; this family of enzymes employs a primary amine nucleophile in its attack on the C-1′ sugar carbon of the damaged nucleoside and, in doing so, creates an identifiable imino intermediate(28Dodson M.L.

Chem. 1995; 270: 19501-19508Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (147) Google Scholar). Accordingly, the active site residue of the M. luteus UV endonuclease also is hypothesized to be a primary amine. Since the M. luteus UV endonuclease protein is established in the literature as an 18-kDa protein, it has been compared most frequently with the 16-kDa T4 endonuclease V. This report will demonstrate, however, that the M. luteus enzyme is actually a 31- or 32-kDa protein; a prominent 18-kDa contaminant copurified with UV endonuclease enzyme throughout many chromatographic steps but was inactive against UV-damaged DNA. Moreover, cloning of the pdg (pyrimidine dimer glycosylase) gene revealed that the UV endonuclease shares extensive sequence homology with the E. coli repair proteins endonuclease III and MutY, not T4 endonuclease V. In addition to describing the isolation and cloning of M. luteus UV endonuclease, or more accurately pyrimidine dimer N-glycosylase/AP lyase, we will discuss characterization of the purified enzyme and a preliminary investigation into its reaction mechanism. Lyophilized M. luteus cells (ATCC 4698) and lysozyme were obtained from Sigma. The Sephadex G-100, phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B, SP-Sepharose Fast Flow, Mono S, and Mono P matrices or columns were purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.; the Affi-Gel Blue and heparin-agarose matrices were from Bio-Rad. Protein molecular weight markers were purchased individually from Sigma or prestained, low molecular size marker sets from Life Technologies, Inc. were employed. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was obtained from Bio-Rad, and microsequencing was carried out in the Protein Sequencing Core Laboratory at Vanderbilt University. [γ-32P]ATP (3,000 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. New England Biolabs was the supplier for the T4 polynucleotide kinase and double-stranded M13mp18 and M13mp19 DNAs. The oligonucleotides used in cloning were ordered from Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) or synthesized in the core facilities of Vanderbilt University or the Sealy Center for Molecular Science. R408 helper phage, E. coli XL1-Blue and LE392 cells, and an M. luteus genomic γZAP II library were purchased from Stratagene. The Sequenase version 2.0 DNA sequencing kit and M13 primers were obtained from the U. S. Biochemical Corp. pBR322 DNA was produced in our laboratory or by the Sealy Center Recombinant DNA Laboratory. All 49-mer, dimer-containing oligonucleotides were provided generously by John-Stephen Taylor and Colin Smith (Washington University, St. Louis, MO). The 37-mer, 5,6-dihydrouracil-containing oligonucleotide and its complement were the gift of Paul Doetsch and L. Augeri (Emory University, Atlanta, GA). Oligonucleotide sizing markers were purchased from Pharmacia. NaBH4 and piperidine stocks were Sigma products. NaCN was obtained from Fisher Scientific Co. All purification procedures were performed at 4°C. Thirty g of lyophilized M. luteus cells was suspended in 1,500 ml of 20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, 200 mM KCl (buffer A), allowed to hydrate for several hours, and then lysed overnight by the addition of lysozyme at 600 μg/ml into buffer A. The following day, the viscous mixture was sonicated with a Branson Sonifier 450 until its consistency thinned, an indication that the majority of the cells had been disrupted. Microscopic examination of the pre- and postsonication samples also confirmed that essentially complete lysis had been achieved. The cellular debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 × g for 1 h, and the resultant supernatant was loaded onto a single-stranded DNA-agarose column (20 cm2× 75 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol(30Schaller H. Nüsslein F.J. Bonhoeffer C.K. Nietzschmann I. Eur. J. Biochem. 1972; 26: 474-481Crossref PubMed Scopus (150) Google Scholar). After the column was loaded and washed thoroughly with the equilibration buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a 2-liter linear gradient of equilibration buffer containing 200-2,000 mM KCl. Eleven-ml fractions were collected and monitored for M. luteus UV endonuclease activity, as in all subsequent purification steps and schemes, by assaying their ability to nick UV-irradiated pBR322 DNA and/or thymine dimer-containing, site-specific oligonucleotides. Although fractions were also examined by SDS-PAGE coupled to either Coomassie or silver staining, they were pooled according to their activity rather than their molecular mass profiles. Single-stranded DNA-agarose fractions 91-141 were combined (1,100-1,500 mM KCl, 600 ml), concentrated to 200 ml on an Amicon concentrator equipped with a YM10 membrane under 40 p.s.i. of pressure, and loaded in two batches of 100 ml each onto a Sephadex G-100 (20 cm2× 100 cm) column that had been equilibrated with 25 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol (buffer B). During each run, 13-ml fractions were collected, and the majority of the UV damage-specific nicking activity was found in fractions 41-61. The active fractions from both runs (450 ml) were applied to a heparin-agarose column (3.0 cm2× 10 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer B. After thorough washing of the column with equilibration buffer, elution with a 500-ml linear gradient of 100-400 mM KCl in buffer B resulted in the enzyme activity peaking between 11-ml fractions 8 and 26 (150-270 mM KCl, 209 ml). This material, once diluted 2-fold with buffer B minus KCl, was reloaded onto the reequilibrated heparin-agarose column and eluted a second time with a 100-250 mM KCl, 500-ml linear gradient of buffer B. Twelve-ml fractions 2-15 (110-150 mM KCl, 168 ml) contained the majority of the UV endonuclease activity and were pooled for further purification on a small single-stranded DNA-agarose column (1.8 cm2× 50 cm). The sample was loaded, the column was washed with buffer B, and a 500-ml linear gradient of 100-1,500 mM KCl in buffer B was run. Fraction 23 (850 mM, 11.5 ml) was prepared for phenyl-Sepharose chromatography by slowly adding (NH4)2SO4 to a final concentration of 1 M. The phenyl-Sepharose column (3.0 cm2× 7.0 cm) was equilibrated with Na2HPO4, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1,000 mM (NH4)2SO4, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol (buffer C), loaded, washed briefly with its high salt equilibration buffer C, and then eluted of proteins with a 200-ml gradient of 1,000-0 mM (NH4)2SO4 buffer C. Four-ml fractions 31-41 (380-180 mM (NH4)2SO4, 44 ml) were combined, concentrated through Amicon filtration to 10 ml, diluted with 50 ml of 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA to lower the salt concentration, and again concentrated, this time to 7 ml. Concomitantly, 10 ml of small single-stranded DNA-agarose fraction 24 was diluted with 130 ml of 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA prior to concentration to 10 ml. Each sample was then ready to be loaded onto an FPLC Mono S column that had been equilibrated with 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM NaCl. In the first Mono S run, the phenyl-Sepharose sample was loaded, the column was washed briefly with equilibration buffer, and a linear gradient of 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, buffer containing 10-750 mM NaCl was programmed and executed. The majority of the enzyme activity was contained within 1.5-ml fractions 13-16 (6 ml). The second Mono S run (single-stranded DNA-agarose sample) was conducted following the same protocol with UV damage-specific nicking activity eluting primarily in fractions 13-18 (12 ml). Side fractions 8 and 9 from the first Mono S run and 11-13 from the second Mono S run were pooled, at this particular step, according to SDS-PAGE silver stain results; the peaks for the 18-kDa protein and UV damage-specific nicking activity were by now somewhat skewed. The (NH4)2SO4 concentration of the sample was raised to 1 M, and the Mono S material was applied once more to the phenyl-Sepharose column that had been equilibrated in buffer C minus ethylene glycol. After the column had been washed thoroughly, the 18-kDa protein was eluted with a 200-ml linear gradient of equilibration buffer containing 1,000-0 mM (NH4)2SO4. Fractions 37 and 38 were combined (6 ml), mixed with an equal volume of 20% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid, set on ice for 30 min to precipitate, and subjected to electrophoresis on a 13% SDS-PAGE gel. The 18-kDa protein (30-50 pmol) was transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride paper according to the method of Matsudaira(31Matsudaira P. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 10035-10038Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), excised from the membrane, and microsequenced via Edman degradation. Based on the amino-terminal sequence of the 18-kDa protein, sense and antisense 42-mer primers were designed for cloning of the protein: 5′-ATGTCCCGCATCGGCCGCCTCCCGATCACCATCCCGGCCGGC-3′ (852) and 5′-GCCGGCCGGGATGGTGATCGGGAGGCGGCCGATGCGGGACAT-3′ (853). Southern blots performed on restriction digest gels of M. luteus genomic DNA (prepared from the freeze-dried cells) both confirmed that a signal could be detected using either probe and helped to optimize hybridization conditions for the actual cloning procedure. As the initial step in the cloning strategy, a randomly sheared M. luteus genomic γZAP II library was plated on NZY (1% (w/v) NZ amine, 5% (w/v) NaCl, 2% (w/v) MgSO4•7H2O) + 0.7% agarose-overlaid plates using E. coli LE392 as the host bacterium. Plaques were visible after the bacteriophage had grown overnight at 37°C, so the plates were chilled for 1 h prior to lifting. The nitrocellulose filters were processed successively in 30-s steps with solutions A (1.5 M NaCl, 0.5 M NaOH), B (0.5 M Tris•HCl, pH 7.5), and C (3 M NaCl, 300 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.0) to denature the DNA. The filters were baked in a vacuum oven for 2 h at 80°C and then immersed in prehybridization solution (20% formamide, 5 × SSPE where 1 × SSPE equals 50 mM NaH2PO4•H2O, pH 7.4, 750 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA), 5 × Denhardt's solution, 100 μg/ml fish milt DNA, 0.1% SDS) for 4 h at 48°C. 32P-Labeled probe 853 was added, and the hybridization was allowed to proceed overnight at 48°C. After a quick rinse, the filters were washed twice for 30 min with 4 × SSPE (200 mM NaH2PO4•H20, pH 7.4, 600 mM NaCl, 20 mM EDTA), dried, and exposed to XAR-5 film (Kodak) at −70°C. Eight positive plaques were detected, cored, and eluted into suspension medium (50 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 8 mM MgSO4•7H2O, 0.01% (w/v) gelatin). Two different concentrations of each eluate were replated for a second round of screening. Plates for each positive were screened with either probe 852 or 853, and only clones of 1, 2, and 6 survived this second generation hybridization. Again, the positive plaques were cored and eluted into suspension medium with gentle shaking. In addition to being replated for a third round of screening, the positive phage were rescued as phagemid in the following manner. Core eluates were incubated with log phase E. coli XL1-Blue cells and R408 helper phage for 15 min at 37°C. Each cell mixture was then added to 5 ml of 2 × YT (16% (w/v) Bacto-tryptone, 10% (w/v) Bacto-yeast extract, 5% (w/v) NaCl, pH 7.0) medium and allowed to grow for 3 h at 37°C. The cells were lysed by heating the tubes for 20 min at 70°C and centrifuged at 4,000 × g for 5 min. pBluescript phagemid packaged as filamentous phage particles were recovered in the supernatant and plated with log phase E. coli XL1-Blue cells onto 10 Luria Bertani plates supplemented with 50 μg/ml ampicillin. Meanwhile, in the third and final round of screening, plaques derived from original clones 1 and 6 hybridized to probe 852; clone 2 proved to have been a false positive. Single colonies were picked from the XL1-Blue plates, cultures grown overnight, and DNA isolated using a STET (10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5% (v/v) Triton X-100) preparation procedure. A series of restriction enzyme digests/Southern blots suggested that the M. luteus gene could be subcloned into M13mp18 and M13mp19 using a SacI/EcoRI ligation strategy. The ligation mixtures were transformed into E. coli UT481 bacteria, the plaques were probed with 852 and 853, and positives were cored and grown overnight in 10 ml of 2 × YT at 37°C. While replicative form DNA was harvested from the culture pellets, single-stranded M13 DNA was recovered from the supernatants. Sequencing focused on the M13mp18-clone 1 and M13mp19-clone 1 constructs. The M13 universal primer was used in the initial stages of sequencing, but, as sequencing progressed throughout the gene, it became necessary to design additional primers. Homology searching was done using the National Center for Biotechnology Information Blaster program. Many of the experimental details are parallel to those presented in purification scheme 1 and can be inferred from the above protocol. Fifty-four g of M. luteus cells was suspended in 2,500 ml of buffer A and allowed to hydrate overnight. Next, lysozyme was added into the cell slurry to a final concentration of 400 μg/ml, and lysis was allowed to proceed until the following day. The concentration of KCl in buffer A was elevated to 400 mM prior to sonication to accelerate mechanical disruption of the cells. Two 30-min centrifugation spins at 2,600 × g were required to obtain a particle-free supernatant that could be loaded onto a single-stranded DNA-agarose column (20 cm2× 75 cm). Before loading, however, the cellular extract was diluted with an equal volume (3 liters) of 20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA to return the salt concentration to 200 mM. Thirteen-ml fractions were collected from a 2-liter gradient of buffer A containing 200-2,000 mM KCl. Fractions 56-106 (850-1,400 mM, 700 ml) were pooled and applied to an Affi-Gel Blue column (5.0 cm2× 10 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer A containing 500 mM KCl. The UV endonuclease enzyme bound weakly to the column and emerged in the flow-through, wash, and 8-ml fractions 1-11 (500-1,500 mM KCl) of a 300-ml, 500-4,000 mM buffer A gradient. The active effluents were combined (950 ml), diluted 2-fold with 20 mM Tris•HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, reloaded onto the Affi-Gel Blue column, and the proteins again eluted with a 300-ml, 500-4,000 mM buffer A gradient. This time, the flow-through, wash, and fractions 1-21 (500-2,500 mM KCl) were pooled (2,100 ml) in preparation for loading onto a buffer C-equilibrated phenyl-Sepharose column (3.0 cm2× 7.0 cm). Initially, in a trial run, 525 ml of the 2,100-ml Affi-Gel Blue pool was loaded onto the phenyl-Sepharose column, and the remainder was applied in a second run. Before each run, (NH4)2SO4 was slowly mixed into the samples to achieve a final concentration of 1 M, and a 200-ml gradient of 1,000-0 mM (NH4)2SO4 in buffer B was employed to elute the UV damage-specific nicking activity. Five-ml fractions 25-50 (130 ml) from the first phenyl-Sepharose run and 4-ml fractions 5-29 (100 ml) from the second phenyl-Sepharose run were pooled independently. An additional 25 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, was added to each pool before it was applied to a Sephadex G-100 column (20 cm2× 100 cm) that had been equilibrated in 25 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM KCl, 10% (v/v) ethylene glycol (buffer D). In each run, as soon as the sample was loaded, buffer D was loaded onto the column, and 12-ml fractions were collected. Fractions 26-66 from the first Sephadex G-100 run (first phenyl-Sepharose run material) and fractions 41-56 from the second Sephadex G-100 run (second phenyl-Sepharose run material) were combined, and 150 ml of the 600-ml pool was applied to a heparin-agarose column (5.0 cm2× 7.0 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer D. After the column was washed thoroughly with equilibration buffer, elution with a 150-ml linear gradient of 100-400 mM KCl in buffer D yielded an enzyme activity peak in 5-ml fractions 33-38 (30 ml). This pool, along with the remainder of the Sephadex G-100 pool, was loaded onto a UV-irradiated single-stranded DNA-agarose column (0.5 cm2× 30 cm) that had been equilibrated with buffer B containing 200 mM KCl. Proteins that remained bound after extensive washing were eluted with a 1-liter linear gradient of 200-1,500 mM KCl in buffer B. Eleven-ml fractions 21-41 (500-800 mM KCl, 230 ml) were combined and diluted with an equal volume of 10 mM Tris•HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA. This starting material was batch loaded onto the Affi-Gel Blue matrix that had been batch equilibrated with buffer B containing 200 mM KCl. UV endonuclease activity eluted in 7-ml fractions 16-33 (1050-2,000 mM KCl, 126 ml) of a 500-ml linear gradient of 200-4,000 mM buffer B. Five ml of fraction 19 and 6 ml of 20, 21, or 22 were dialyzed separately against 25 mM NaH2PO4, pH 6.8, 100 mM NaCl (buffer E). Each sample was loaded onto an FPLC Mono S column that had been equilibrated with buffer E, and a 38-ml gradient of 100-500 mM NaCl in buffer E was executed. Nicking activity eluted consistently in the 260-325 mM NaCl range. Fraction 18 (1 ml) from the Affi-Gel Blue fraction 20 run was dialyzed against 25 mM ethanolamine, pH 10.0, 10 mM NaCl and then injected onto an FPLC Mono P column that had been equilibrated in the same buffer. UV endonuclease activity eluted in 1-ml fractions 3, 4, and 5 of a 38-ml gradient of equilibration buffer containing 0-8% Pharmacia Polybuffer 96 (pH gradient 10.0-7.0). Mono S 1-ml fractions 17, 19, and 21 from the Affi-Gel Blue fraction 19 run, 15-17 and 19-21 from the Affi-Gel Blue fraction 20 run, 14-19 from the Affi-Gel Blue fraction 21 run, and 16, 17, 19, and 20 from the Affi-Gel Blue fraction 22 run were pooled independently and precipitated with a sixth volume of 70% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid. The samples were subjected to electrophoresis on a 13% SDS-PAGE gel, the 31- and 32-kDa proteins (20-40 pmol each) were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, carefully excised, and microsequenced via Edman degradation. Based on the amino-terminal sequence of the 31- and 32-kDa proteins, the following sense and antisense 38-mer primers were designed for cloning of the UV endonuclease gene: 5′-ATGGAGACGGAGTCCACGGGCACGCCGACGGGCGAGAC-3′(1083) and 5′-GTCTCGCCCGTCGGCGTGCCCGTGGACTCCGTCTCCAT-3′(1084). Southern blots were performed on restriction digest gels of M. luteus genomic DNA (prepared from freeze-dried cells) both to confirm that a signal could be detected using either probe and to optimize hybridization conditions for the actual cloning procedure. The randomly sheared M. luteus genomic γZAP II library was plated and hybridized at 42°C with 32P-labeled probe 1083. Two of the 10 positive clones from the initial plating of the M. luteus library survived three subsequent rounds of hybridization. These positives were rescued as phagemid into pBluescript, the inserts were subcloned into M13mp18, and the M13mp18-clone 3 construct was sequenced. Unfortunately, although a 4-kilobase fragment of genomic DNA had been isolated, only the first 666 bp of the pyrimidine dimer N-glycosylase/AP lyase coding s"
https://openalex.org/W2149993174,"The proliferation of human myeloid progenitor cells is negatively regulated in the presence of certain members of the chemokine family of molecules. This includes interleukin 8 (IL-8) and platelet factor 4 (PF4), which in combination are able to synergize, resulting in cell suppression at very low concentrations of these molecules. A series of PF4 and IL-8 mutant proteins were analyzed in an in vitro colony formation assay for myeloid progenitor cells to assess domains of these proteins that are required for activity. Mutation of either of the two DLQ motifs within PF4 resulted in an inactive protein. Perturbations within the IL-8 dimer interface region also resulted in mutants that were incapable of suppressing colony formation. A class of chimeric mutants consisting of domains of either PF4 and IL-8, Gro-α and PF4, or Gro-β and PF4 were observed to inhibit myeloid cell proliferation at concentrations which were between 500- and 5000-fold lower than either the IL-8 or PF4 wild-type proteins alone. These chimeric mutants possessed activities that were comparable to or better than the activity observed when IL-8 and PF4 were added together in vitro. One of these highly active chimeric proteins was observed to be 1000-fold more active than either IL-8 or PF4 alone in suppressing not only the proliferation but also the cell cycling of myeloid progenitor cells following intravenous injection of the mutant into mice. Examination of additional IL-8-based mutants in the colony formation assay, which centered on the perturbation of the amino-terminal “ELR” motif, resulted in the observation that the highly active IL-8 mutant required both aspartic acid at amino acid residue 4 and either glutamine or asparagine at residue 6. Single mutations at either of these positions resulted in mutants with myelosuppressive activity equivalent to wild-type IL-8. Mutants such as IL-8M1 and IL-8M10 were observed to be significantly reduced in their ability to activate isolated human neutrophils, suggesting that separate mechanisms may exist by which myeloid progenitor cells and neutrophils are affected by chemokines.

Myelopoiesis is a complex, highly regulated process, which is dependent on the action of both positive and negative growth factors to control the proliferation of primitive morphologically indistinct cells from hematopoietic organs to supply functional end-stage blood cells. Factors that stimulate cell growth and differentiation have been well characterized and include the colony-stimulating factors (GM-CSF), 1The abbreviations used are: GM-CSFgranulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factorILinterleukinPFplatelet factorMIPmacrophage inflammatory proteinMCPmonocyte chemotactic and activating peptideγIP10γ interferon-inducible protein (molecular weight 10,000)HPLChigh performance liquid chromatographyPBSphosphate-buffered salineCHOChinese hamster ovaryCFUcolony-forming unitBFU-Eburst-forming unit of erythroid progenitor cellsGMgranulocyte/macrophageGEMMmultipotential cells. granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, and macrophage colony-stimulating factor), erythropoietin, some of the interleukin family members (e.g. IL-1, IL-3, IL-4, IL-6, IL-9, IL-11) as well as other cytokines including Steel factor 1-3). A number of suppressor molecules have also been identified. These include E-type prostaglandins, H-ferritin, lactoferrin, interferons, tumor necrosis factors, and transforming growth factor-β (1Broxmeyer H.E. Murphy M.J.

Chemokines are a family of small inducible proteins possessing structural similarities and high amino acid identities(14Oppenheim J.J. Zachariae C.O. Mukaida N. Matsushima K. Annu. Rev.

Cytokine. 1993; 5: 175-179Crossref PubMed Scopus (74) Google Scholar). Although activity differences exist between the proteins, all are believed to possess chemoattractant properties for various cell types. The family is subdivided into two groups based on positioning of cysteine residues within the amino-terminal domain. The CXC group (2 cysteines with an intervening amino acid) includes IL-8, Gro-α, Gro-β, NAP-2, PF4, ENA78, and γIP10. The three-dimensional structures of IL-8 and PF4 have been solved and show general structural identity(17Zhang X. Chen L. Bancroft D.P. Lai C.K. Maione T.E. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 8361-8366Crossref PubMed Scopus (159) Google Scholar, 18Clore G.M. Gronenborn A.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1991; 217: 611-620Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). Protein family members that possess the amino acid motif “ELR” within the amino terminus have all been observed to elicit potent neutrophil chemoattractant and stimulatory activities. This motif has also been shown to be required for specific interaction with either of the two IL-8 receptor proteins on the surface of neutrophils(19Moser B. Dewald B. Barella L. Schumacher C.

The remaining members of the CXC subgroup display a more diverse activity profile, weak or no neutrophil chemoattracting activity, and less sequence homology to the ELR motif containing subgroup. Neither PF4 nor γIP10 have demonstrated significant neutrophil-related activities(22Walz A. Dewald B. von Tscharner V. Baggiolini M. J. Exp.

The other half of the chemokine family is characterized by the CC motif (two adjacent cysteine residues located within the amino terminus) and displays a much more diverse sequence homology and activity profile. CC chemokines act predominantly on monocytes, although basophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils have also been reported to be target cells for various CC proteins including RANTES, MIP-1α, and MCP-1(26Leonard E.J.

Compared to the CXC family, less is understood regarding domains within the proteins which are required for biological activity. However, recent structural information on MIP-1β should facilitate this understanding(30Lodi P.J. Garrett D.S. Kuszewski J. Tsang M.L.-S. Weatherbee J.A. Leonard W.J. Gronenborn A.M. Clore G.M.

Activated platelets have been observed to release high concentrations of a high molecular weight proteoglycan complex consisting of chondroitin sulfate and PF4(31Moore S. Pepper D.S. Cash J.D. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1975; 379: 370-378Crossref PubMed Scopus (88) Google Scholar). In addition to high affinity binding and neutralization of heparin, PF4 also has been observed to inhibit angiogenesis, inhibit bone resorption, and reverse the immunosuppressive effect of lymphoma cells(32Loscalzo J.

IL-8 has been observed to possess potent chemotactic and stimulating properties toward human neutrophils in vitro and has been shown to bind with high affinity to either of the two cloned human IL-8 receptors in vitro. In addition to these activities, IL-8 and PF4, as well as MIP-1α, MCP-1, Gro-β, and γIP10, were all observed to inhibit early myeloid progenitor cell proliferation at equivalent concentrations >25 ng/ml(10Broxmeyer H.E. Sherry B. Cooper S. Lu L. Maze R. Beckmann M.P. Cerami A. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3448-3458PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sarris A.H. Broxmeyer H.E. Wirthmueller U. Karasavvas N. Cooper S. Lu L.

Several members of the chemokine family, including NAP-2, Gro-α, Gro-γ, RANTES, and MIP-1β did not possess any inhibitory activities in this assay. A third group of chemokines including Gro-α and Gro-γ (MIP-2β) blocked the inhibitory activity of IL-8 and PF4(10Broxmeyer H.E. Sherry B. Cooper S. Lu L. Maze R. Beckmann M.P. Cerami A. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3448-3458PubMed Google Scholar). Similarly, MIP-1β was observed to inhibit the activity of MIP-1α(6Broxmeyer H.E. Sherry B. Cooper S. Ruscetti F.W. Williams D.E. Arosio P. Kwon B.S. Cerami A. J. Immunol. 1991; 147: 2586-2594PubMed Google Scholar, 10Broxmeyer H.E. Sherry B. Cooper S. Lu L. Maze R. Beckmann M.P. Cerami A. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3448-3458PubMed Google Scholar). Combinations of any two of the six active chemokines resulted in a synergistic decrease in the amount of each chemokine needed to inhibit proliferation (0.1 ng/ml of each chemokine), suggesting the possibility of a novel mechanism of action on the progenitors(10Broxmeyer H.E. Sherry B. Cooper S. Lu L. Maze R. Beckmann M.P. Cerami A. Ralph P. J. Immunol. 1993; 150: 3448-3458PubMed Google Scholar, 11Sarris A.H. Broxmeyer H.E. Wirthmueller U. Karasavvas N. Cooper S. Lu L. Krueger J. Ravetch J.V. J. Exp. Med. 1993; 178: 1127-1132Crossref PubMed Scopus (89) Google Scholar). The low concentrations of PF4 and IL-8 required to elicit inhibition suggest the presence of protein-based receptors on the progenitor cells. To address this issue, a series of chimeric IL-8/PF4 mutants were expressed, purified, and tested for inhibitory activity toward immature subsets of myeloid progenitor cells. The synthetic genes for human IL-8, PF4, and related mutants were expressed as non-fusion proteins in Escherichia coli (BL21) cells and grown in a 500-ml shaker flask containing 300 μg/ml kanamycin until an absorbance of 0.6 at 600 nm was reached. Cells were induced with isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside for 3 h at 37°C, followed by centrifugation at 14,000 × g for 30 min to pellet the cells. The cell paste was resuspended in 20 ml of 1 × phosphate-buffered saline (Life Technologies, Inc.) and sonicated for 3 min at 4°C using a Braun-Sonic model 1510 sonicator at 200 watts. Following lysis, the cell suspension was centrifuged for 30 min at 18,000 × g at 4°C. The precipitate from the centrifugation step was extracted in buffer containing 0.05 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 6 M guanidine HCl, 50 mM dithiothreitol at 25°C for 1 h. The extracted material was then diluted with a 50-fold excess (v/v) of buffer containing 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 8 M urea. This material was centrifuged at 14,000 × g and the supernatant filtered through 0.45-μm nitrocellulose filters. The protein was loaded onto an S-Sepharose column equilibrated in 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 8 M urea and the column was washed with 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, to remove the urea. A second wash was performed using buffer containing 25 mM sodium acetate, pH 4.0, 0.5 M NaCl. The protein was then eluted using buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 M NaCl. Fractions containing the appropriate chemokine protein were subjected to refolding overnight in the presence of 1 mM oxidized, 2 mM reduced glutathione at 25°C. Extent of refolding of the proteins was monitored through Poros analytical chromatography. The reduced protein was observed to elute from the Poros column at a different acetonitrile concentration relative to the refolded species. Refolded fractions were pooled and rechromatographed by C4 semi-preparative reverse phase HPLC using a 0-100% acetonitrile gradient in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid/H2O. Peak fractions were pooled and lyophilized for concentration determination. Purity was assessed by Coomassie staining of SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, analytical C4 reverse phase HPLC, and amino acid analysis. Small scale purifications typically yielded several milligrams of highly purified (>95% purity) material. For isolation of human neutrophils, typically 22.5 ml of human blood was layered over 10 ml of Ficoll 1119 and 10 ml of Ficoll 1077 in a 50-ml polypropylene conical tube. The blood was centrifuged in a tabletop centrifuge for 20 min at 1800 rpm at 8°C. Following centrifugation, the neutrophil layer (located just above the pelleted red blood cell layer) was collected, washed in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (without Ca2+ and Mg2+; Life Technologies, Inc.), and pelleted by centrifugation for 5 min at 1800 rpm at 8°C. The neutrophil fraction, which contains some contaminating red blood cells, was resuspended in 27 ml of sterile H2O, which served to lyse the remaining red blood cells. 3 ml of 10 × phosphate-buffered saline were added to the resuspended cells, which were pelleted by centrifugation at 8°C for 5 min at 1800 rpm. The pelleted neutrophils were resuspended in 10 ml of PBS and counted. Resuspended cells were kept on ice until needed for chemokine-dependent assays. Elastase release from human neutrophils was monitored using the fluorescent substrate MeO-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-aminomethylcoumarin as described by Hebert et al.(37Hebert C.A. Luscinskas F.W. Kiely J.-M. Luis E.A. Darbonne W.C. Bennett G.L. Liu C.C. Obin M.S. Gimbrone Jr., M.A. Baker J.B. J. Immunol. 1990; 145: 3033-3040PubMed Google Scholar). Isolated human neutrophils were suspended in PBS buffer containing 0.02 M Na2HPO4, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.2 M Hepes, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 5 mM glucose, 5 × 10-3 mg/ml cytochalasin B (5 mg/ml stock in Me2SO; Sigma) at a concentration of 2 × 106 cells/ml. 0.5 ml aliquots of the suspended neutrophils were added to 0.5 ml of the PBS buffer solution. Following incubation, cells were re-equilibrated at 37°C for 15 min. Chemokines at varying concentrations were added to the neutrophils while gently mixing. Following addition of the chemokines, the cells were pelleted and 0.75 ml of the resulting supernatant was added to 2.25 ml of PBS in the presence of 5 × 10-3 mg/ml of the elastase substrate (5 mg/ml stock in Me2SO; Peninsula Laboratories, Inc., Belmont, CA). The samples were incubated for 1 h at 37°C then placed on ice for spectrofluorometric analysis. Samples were excited at 380 nm with emission monitored at 460 nm. The ability of IL-8-derived mutants to elicit chemotaxis of isolated human neutrophils was examined using a 48-well micro chemotaxis chamber with a 5-μm pore size filter (Neuroprobe) as described previously(38Falk W. Goodwin Jr., R.H. Leonard E.J. J. Immunol. Methods. 1980; 33: 239-247Crossref PubMed Scopus (251) Google Scholar). Typically, 50,000 neutrophils were added per well and chemokine concentration was varied. After a 30-min incubation period at 37°C, the upper chamber was removed and cells on the filter from the upper chamber were scraped away. The filter was fixed with 100% ethanol, stained with a solution of 0.5% toluidine blue in 3.7% formaldehyde, and counted at 400× magnification. IL-8 was iodinated as described previously (39Thomas K.M. Taylor L. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 14839-14841Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or purchased from DuPont NEN. A stable transfectant CHO cell line, 4ABCHO33(21LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol.

Binding was performed as described in (21LaRosa G.J. Thomas K.M. Kaufmann M.E. Mark R. White M. Taylor L. Gray G. Witt D. Navarro J. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 25402-25406Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). As described previously(8Lord B.I. Dexter T.M. Clements J.M. Hunter M.A. Gearing A.J.H. Blood. 1992; 79: 2605-2609Crossref PubMed Google Scholar, 9Maze R. Sherry B. Kwon B.S. Cerami A. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1004-1009PubMed Google Scholar), 1 × 105 low density (<1.077 g/cm3) normal human bone marrow cells were plated in 0.3% agar culture medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (HyClone, Logan, UT) with 100 units/ml recombinant human (rhu) GM-CSF plus 50 ng/ml rhu Steel factor (Immunex Corp., Seattle, WA) in the absence and presence of rhu chemokines for assessment of CFU-GM. For assessment of CFU-GEMM and BFU-E, cells were grown in 0.9% methylcellulose culture medium in the presence of rhu erythropoietin (1-2 units/ml) in combination with 50 ng/ml rhu Steel factor. Three plates were scored per concentration per experiment for CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, and BFU-E colonies after incubation at 37°C in lowered (5%) O2 for 14 days. The combination of GM-CSF and Steel factor or erythropoietin and Steel factor allow detection of large colonies (usually >1000 cells/colony) which come from early, more immature subsets of CFU-GM, CFU-GEMM, and BFU-E. Levels of significance were determined using Student's t distribution (two-tailed test). C3H/HeJ and BDF1 mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME). Mice were injected intravenously with 0.2 ml of saline/mouse or the stated amount of chemokine and sacrificed 24 h later. Femoral bone marrow was removed, treated with or without high specific activity tritiated thymidine, and plated in 0.3% agar cultured medium with 10% fetal bovine serum in the presence of 10% v/v pokeweed mitogen mouse spleen cell cultured medium as described previously(9Maze R. Sherry B. Kwon B.S. Cerami A. Broxmeyer H.E. J. Immunol. 1992; 149: 1004-1009PubMed Google Scholar). Colonies (>40 cells/aggregate) were scored after 7 days of incubation. The proportion of progenitors in DNA synthesis (S phase of the cell cycle) was estimated using the high specific activity (20 Ci/mM) tritiated thymidine (50 μCi/ml) (DuPont NEN) kill technique and is based on the calculation in vitro of the reduction in the number of colonies formed after pulse exposure of cells for 20 min to “hot” tritiated thymidine as compared with control (McCoy's medium or a comparable amount of non-radioactive “cold” thymidine). A series of chemokine mutants, based on either PF4 or IL-8 native sequences were constructed to examine the domains of these proteins, which are involved in suppression of myeloid progenitor cell proliferation. Fig. 1shows the amino acid sequences of the mutant proteins, which were expressed, purified, and tested in the neutrophil-based assays as well as the myeloid progenitor colony formation assays. For IL-8-based mutants, emphasis was placed on regions surrounding the amino-terminal ELR domain. Mutations were also clustered in the region involved in IL-8 dimerization. For the PF4-based mutants, changes within the DLQ motif, located within the amino-terminal domain were examined. A second DLQ motif, located proximal to the putative heparin binding domain at a reverse β-turn near the carboxyl-terminal domain was also emphasized for mutation. Previously, several groups have reported that peptides containing this motif displayed activity toward suppression of progenitor cell proliferation(13Gewirtz A.M. Calabretta B. Rucinski B. Niewiarowski S. Xu W.Y. J. Clin. Invest. 1989; 83: 1477-1486Crossref PubMed Scopus (118) Google Scholar, 40Caen J.P. Lebeurier I. Aidoudi S. Chen Y.Z. Amiral J. Han Z.C. Blood. 1993; 82: 162aGoogle Scholar). Native sequence proteins as well as mutants were expressed as nonfusion proteins in E. coli (Novagen, pET system). Expression was induced using isopropyl-1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside, and protein was initially observed as inclusion bodies following lysis of the cells. Proteins were purified from the inclusion bodies by extraction under reducing and denaturing conditions, ion exchange chromatography, a refolding procedure followed by reverse phase HPLC. Correct refolding of the chemokines was monitored by differential retention times using Poros chromatography. Identification of the purified protein was accomplished using amino acid analysis, mass spectrometry, and amino-terminal sequencing. Purity was determined by analytical reverse phase HPLC, mass spectrometry, and SDS-gel electrophoresis. The ability of each of the chemokine proteins to activate neutrophils was tested using a degranulation assay, which followed chemokine-dependent release of elastase. Fig. 2A shows a summary of the activities of the purified chemokine proteins. IL-8, as well as IL-8M3, M4, M6, M7, and M64 all show significant elastase release activity, although compared to IL-8 wild-type, M4 was less active. The PF4-based mutant, PF4M2, displayed approximately 50% of the activity observed with the native sequence IL-8, demonstrating the requirement of the amino-terminal ELR domain for neutrophil-based activity. Some activity was observed with mutants PF4M1 and IL-8M1 only at concentrations of protein greater than 10-6M (10 μg/ml). As expected, PF4, PF4-412, PF4-413, PF4-414, and PF4-421 showed no neutrophil elastase release activity at any of the concentrations tested. Additional IL-8 mutants, designated IL-8M8 (ELQ), IL-8M9 (DLR), and IL-8M10 (DLN), which were developed to examine in greater detail the requirements surrounding the NH2-terminal ELR motif, were also tested in the elastase release assay in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2B). As anticipated, all three displayed either significantly reduced activity or no ability to elicit degranulation of the isolated human neutrophils. Neither IL-8M8 or IL-8M10 elicited any release of elastase at concentrations as high as 4 × 10-6M (40 μg/ml) and 1.25 × 10-5M (100 μg/ml), respectively. IL-8M9 demonstrated the ability to release elastase, although at concentrations approximately 200-fold greater than for the native sequence IL-8. Perturbation of the ELR motif resulted in profound effects on the ability of these chemokine mutants to function on the neutrophil. The ability of each of these mutant proteins to elicit chemotaxis of neutrophils was also examined. Each chemokine mutant was tested in a concentration-dependent manner for ability to elicit chemotaxis of isolated human neutrophils in a boyden chamber. Each concentration of each mutant was tested in triplicate in two separate experiments. Each data point was read in triplicate as well, for a total of 18 data points/concentration/chemokine. The results obtained demonstrate a direct correlation between the ability of the chemokine mutants to elicit chemotaxis of neutrophils and the ability to cause neutrophil degranulation as exhibited in the elastase release assay results (Fig. 3, A-D). With the exception of PF4M2, none of the PF4-derived mutants displayed any chemotactic activity toward neutrophils. Similarly, with the exception of IL-8M1, which showed substantially reduced activity, all of the IL-8-derived mutants exhibited potent neutrophil chemotactic activity, although some reduction in activity was also observed for IL-8M4, IL-8M64, and IL-8M7. However, this decrease also correlated with the data obtained in the elastase release assay. Binding of the IL-8-derived mutants to CHO cells containing the stably transfected IL-8 receptor subtype B was also performed. The B subtype receptor is able to bind with high affinity to IL-8 as well as other “ELR”-containing chemokines including Gro-α, Gro-β, and NAP-2. As shown in Table 1, competition binding experiments utilizing 125I-labeled IL-8 and unlabeled mutant chemokine competitors demonstrated that each of the proteins that was able to activate the neutrophils was also able to bind to the neutrophil receptors.

https://openalex.org/W2061698542,"Pleckstrin is a substrate for protein kinase C in activated platelets that contains at its N and C termini two of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domains that have been proposed to mediate protein-protein and protein-lipid interactions. We have recently shown that pleckstrin can inhibit agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis and that this inhibition requires an intact N-terminal PH domain (residues 6 to 99). In the present studies, we have identified the sites of phosphorylation in pleckstrin and examined their contribution to pleckstrin function. In human platelets activated with thrombin or phorbol esters, and in COS-1 cells expressing pleckstrin, a combination of phosphopeptide analysis and site-directed mutagenesis shows that three residues in the intervening sequence between the two pleckstrin PH domains become phosphorylated: Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117. Replacing all three of these sites with glycine decreased phosphorylation by >90% and reduced pleckstrin's ability to inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis by as much as 80%. Replacing the phosphorylation sites with alanine residues had a similar effect, while substitution with aspartate, glutamate, or lysine residues produced pleckstrin variants that were fully active even in the absence of phosphorylation. These results suggest that phosphorylation enhances pleckstrin's activity by introducing a cluster of charges into a region adjacent to, but not within, the N-terminal PH domain. This may have an allosteric effect on the N-terminal PH domain, regulating its interaction with other molecules necessary for the inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis.

INTRODUCTIONProteins that are important in signal transduction often contain discrete domains that mediate protein-protein interactions. Examples of this include Src homology domains 2 and 3 (SH2 and SH3) which interact with specific tyrosine-phosphorylated and proline-rich amino acid sequences, respectively(1Koch C.A. Anderson D.

Pleckstrin or p47 is a 40-kDa protein present in platelets and leukocytes that becomes phosphorylated when platelets are activated by agonists that directly or indirectly activate protein kinase C(16Haslam R.J. Lynham J.A. Fox J.E.B. Biochem. J. 1979; 178: 397-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar). Phosphoamino acid analysis and two-dimensional electrophoresis suggest that pleckstrin is phosphorylated heterogeneously on one or more serine and threonine residues, but not tyrosine residues(17Imaoka T. Lynham J.A. Haslam R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11404-11414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The function of pleckstrin has not been fully characterized, but we have shown previously that when transfected into COS-1 or HEK-293 cells pleckstrin can inhibit agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis initiated by G-protein-coupled receptors and growth factor receptors(18Abrams C.S.

In that model system, pleckstrin also inhibited the increase in inositol phosphate formation caused by the expression of a constitutively active variant of Gqα, but had no effect on Gα- or Gβγ-mediated regulation of adenylyl cyclase. The inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis required an intact N-terminal PH domain and was additive with that observed when mock-transfected cells were preincubated briefly with PMA, suggesting that it is independent of the phosphorylation of receptors, G-proteins, and phospholipase C known to occur under the same conditions(19Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F.

Fesik S.W. Nature. 1994; 371: 168-170Crossref PubMed Scopus (669) Google Scholar), one possible explanation for these results is that pleckstrin inhibits phosphoinositide hydrolysis by binding to PIP2 and that phosphorylation of pleckstrin by protein kinase C promotes this interaction. In this context, pleckstrin could play a role in the feedback regulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis following activation of protein kinase C, limiting the duration of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate formation. Conceivably, pleckstrin might also interact with Gβγ, such an interaction has been demonstrated for GST fusion proteins containing pleckstrin's PH domains(23Touhara K. Inglese J. Pitcher J.A. Shaw G. Lefkowitz R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10217-10220Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), 2C. S. Abrams, W. Zhao, and L. F. Brass, unpublished observation. but this alone would not readily account for the observed ability of pleckstrin to inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis initiated by TrkA receptors and constitutively active Gqα.In the present studies, we have identified the sites of phosphorylation within pleckstrin and examined their relationship to pleckstrin's ability to inhibit agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis. The results show that: 1) pleckstrin is variably phosphorylated on a cluster of residues located near, but not within, the N-terminal PH domain, 2) elimination of any one of these sites does not alter the overall phosphorylation of the molecule, presumably because of compensatory increases in phosphorylation at the other sites, 3) phosphorylation of pleckstrin is required for maximal inhibition of phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and 4) the effects of phosphorylation may be due largely to the introduction of charged residues into the region between the two PH domains.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESConstruction of Pleckstrin Expression VectorsThe expression plasmid encoding for full-length human pleckstrin was described previously(18Abrams C.S.

Pleckstrin variants containing mutations at Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117 were generated using the technique of Landt et al.(24Landt O. Grunert H.-P. Hahn U. Gene (Amst.). 1990; 96: 125-128Crossref PubMed Scopus (638) Google Scholar). All of the pleckstrin variants were cloned into pCMV5. The cDNA sequences of the cloned wild type pleckstrin and variants were all confirmed and in agreement with the published sequence of pleckstrin(25Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I.

Nature. 1988; 333: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar).Mapping of Phosphorylation SitesHuman platelets isolated by differential centrifugation from blood anticoagulated with ACD were washed in HEPES/Tyrode's buffer (129 mM NaCl, 8.9 mM NaHCO3, 2.8 mM KCl, 0.8 mM KH2PO4, 56 mM dextrose, 10 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.8 mM MgCl2) with 1 mM prostaglandin E1. A total of 1 × 1010 platelets were resuspended in 1 ml of HEPES/Tyrode's buffer with 250 μCi of orthophosphate. After incubation at 30°C for 1 h, 10 ml of HEPES/Tyrode's buffer with 1 μM prostaglandin E1 was added, and the platelet suspension was centrifuged at 500 × g for 15 min. The platelets were then resuspended in HEPES/Tyrode's buffer, stimulated with 50 nM PMA at room temperature for 5 min, and then lysed with ice-cold 2 × lysis buffer (1 × lysis buffer contains 1% Triton, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1% aprotinin, 1 mM vanadate, and 25 μg/ml leupeptin). After lysis of the platelets, the pleckstrin was immunoprecipitated with rabbit anti-pleckstrin sera 354 raised against a recombinant protein corresponding to residues Glu104-Asp233 of human pleckstrin(18Abrams C.S. Wu H. Zhao W. Belmonte E. White D. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14485-14492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In the studies with COS-1 cells transiently expressing pleckstrin, the cells were incubated in phosphate-free media with 1 mCi/ml 32Pi for 3.5 h, stimulated with 50 nM PMA at 37°C for 10 min, and then mixed with 2 × lysis buffer before the pleckstrin was immunoprecipitated.CNBr mapping was performed on immunoprecipitated pleckstrin which was gel-purified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. A gel slice containing the phosphopleckstrin was mixed with 50 mM ammonium carbonate (pH 8.5), 0.1% SDS, 1%β-mercaptoethanol. Pleckstrin contained in the eluate was passed through glass wool, trichloroacetic acid-precipitated, washed twice with a 50:50 mixture of cold ethanol:ether, and then vacuum-dried. The sample was resuspended in 30 μl of 50 mg/ml CNBr in 70% formic acid and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. At this point, the digest was lyophilized with 1 ml of distilled water and again vacuum-dried. When noted, the CNBr fragments were further digested by incubating them overnight in the dark at room temperature in 30 μl of 10 mg/ml iodosobenzoate (IBZO) in 80% acetic acid with 4 M guanidine HCl(26Longo C. Garrido B. Zalba G. Lopez-Moratella N. Santiago E. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). All samples were then lyophilized with 1 ml of distilled water, vacuum-dried an additional three times, and fractionated on a Tricine gel(27Schagger H. von Jagow G. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 166: 368-379Crossref PubMed Scopus (10439) Google Scholar).Transfection of COS-1 Cells and Thrombin-induced Inositol Phosphate ProductionThis was performed as described previously (18Abrams C.S. Wu H. Zhao W. Belmonte E. White D. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14485-14492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). In brief, two 100-mm tissue culture plates of COS-1 cells were transfected using DEAE-dextran (28Morris J.F. Madden S.L. Tournay O.E. Cook D.M. Sukatme V.P. Rauscher F.J. Oncogene. 1991; 6: 2339-2348PubMed Google Scholar) with the human thrombin receptor in pCMV5 (a gift from Mark Stinski, University of Iowa) plus either wild type pleckstrin, variant pleckstrin, or an equivalent amount of empty plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the cells were trypsinized and reseeded into eight 60-mm tissue culture plates. [3H]Inositol (4 μCi/ml, ICN) was added to six of the plates, then all of the cells were incubated at 37°C for an additional 18 h. The unlabeled cells were used to assess protein expression. The labeled cells were used to measure [3H]inositol phosphate formation. Forty eight hours after transfection, the six [3H]inositol-labeled plates were divided into three sets of duplicates which were extracted with perchloric acid either under resting condition, after stimulation by thrombin (2 units/ml) for 45 min, or after preincubation with 50-100 nM PMA for 5 min followed by stimulation with thrombin, all in the presence of 20 mM LiCl. The neutralized extracts were applied to Dowex 1 columns, which were washed sequentially with 5 mM inositol and 5 mM sodium tetraborate, 60 mM ammonium formate. Total [3H]inositol phosphate was eluted with 0.1 M formic acid plus 1.5 M ammonium formate and quantitated by scintillation counting. Equal levels of thrombin receptor expression in transfected cells was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis using ATAP2, a peptide-directed monoclonal antibody that recognizes the human thrombin receptor(29Brass L.F.

Pleckstrin expression was assessed by immunoblotting cell lysates with rabbit anti-pleckstrin antibody.Other MaterialsHuman α-thrombin (≈3000 units/mg) was kindly provided by Dr. J. Fenton (New York State Dept. of Health, Albany, NY). Recombinant full-length pleckstrin was expressed in bacteria. The nucleotide sequence for pleckstrin was generated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of HL-60 total cellular RNA, and then cloned into a derivative of PET-11b. This plasmid directs the expression of the pleckstrin utilizing T7 polymerase and inserts a six histidine peptide tag at the N terminus of the expressed protein, allowing it to be purified over a nickel-agarose column. Stoichiometry of in vitro phosphorylated pleckstrin was performed using the Life Technologies, Inc. Protein Kinase C Assay System (Catalog No. 13161-013) and purified protein kinase Cα (Life Technologies, Inc.) as described by the manufacturer.RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONPhosphopeptide Mapping the Sites of Pleckstrin PhosphorylationPrevious studies have shown that pleckstrin is phosphorylated exclusively on serine and threonine residues(17Imaoka T. Lynham J.A. Haslam R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11404-11414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Two-dimensional electrophoresis of 32P-labeled pleckstrin from platelets and of purified pleckstrin shows multiple species with different isoelectric points and specific activities, consistent with heterogeneous phosphorylation at multiple sites(17Imaoka T. Lynham J.A. Haslam R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11404-11414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In keeping with this conclusion, the predicted amino acid sequence of pleckstrin includes six potential sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C, which prefers serine and threonine residues adjacent to basic residues (25Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varrichio A.M. Shorr R.G. Haslam R.J. Harley C.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar). Three of these sites are within the N-terminal PH domain (Ser40, Ser43, and Thr73). The other three are located in the intervening sequence between the two PH domains (Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117) in a region (107QKFARKSTRRSIRL120) that closely resembles the protein kinase C pseudosubstrate site, RFARKGSLRQ (see Fig. 1)(25Tyers M. Rachubinski R.A. Stewart M.I. Varrichio A.M. Shorr R.G. Haslam R.J. Harley C.B. Nature. 1988; 333: 470-473Crossref PubMed Scopus (190) Google Scholar, 30House C. Kemp B.E. Science. 1987; 238: 1726-1728Crossref PubMed Scopus (784) Google Scholar). To determine which of these potential sites actually becomes phosphorylated, pleckstrin was immunoprecipitated from platelets that had been labeled with [32P]PO4 and stimulated with PMA. The immunoprecipitate was digested with CNBr, which cleaves after methionine residues to produce 9 predicted fragments that were fractionated by gel electrophoresis and autoradiography (Fig. 1). The predominant radioactive fragment had an apparent molecular mass of approximately 8 kDa that corresponds to residues Phe67-Met133. In some experiments, two additional phosphorylated fragments were also observed. When present, these bands always contained <10% of the total incorporated 32P. The first was a 19-kDa fragment corresponding to residues Ser197-Ala344. The second was a 10-kDa fragment corresponding to residues Ile48-Met133 that was produced by incomplete cleavage at Met66.Of the six potential sites for phosphorylation, four are located in the 8-kDa Phe67-Met133 CNBr fragment: Thr73, Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117 (Fig. 1). To determine which of these four sites becomes phosphorylated, the 32P-labeled CNBr fragments were incubated with IBZO, which cleaves after tryptophan residues(26Longo C. Garrido B. Zalba G. Lopez-Moratella N. Santiago E. Int. J. Biochem. 1992; 24: 133-143Crossref PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar). IBZO is predicted to liberate two fragments of 3 kDa (Phe67-Trp92) and 5 kDa (Val93-Met133) from the 8-kDa CNBr fragment. As is shown in the right lane of Fig. 1A, only the 5-kDa fragment contained 32P, effectively limiting the potential phosphorylation site(s) to residues Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117. Although not formally excluded by this part of the analysis, the only other serine and threonine residues within the 5-kDa CNBr/IBZO fragment are Thr123 and Ser132, neither of which are predicted sites for phosphorylation by protein kinase C.Identification of the Phosphorylation Sites by Site-directed MutagenesisTo determine whether the candidate sites are, in fact, phosphorylated, COS-1 cells were transfected with wild type pleckstrin or pleckstrin in which the sites were individually or collectively replaced with glycine residues. Two days after transfection, the cells were labeled with [32P]PO4 and incubated briefly with PMA. As predicted by the CNBr/IBZO phosphopeptide analysis, simultaneous replacement of all three sites (denoted 3 Gly in the figures) caused a >90% decrease in 32P incorporation into pleckstrin (Fig. 2A). This decrease was not due to reduced expression or immunoprecipitation of the mutant (Fig. 2B). Interestingly, mutation of any one of these sites individually had little or no effect on 32P incorporation (Fig. 2A), while replacement of the sites two at a time resulted in diminished, but not absent, phosphorylation (data not shown). Since CNBr maps of the pleckstrin variants in which the sites were mutated individually were identical with those derived from wild type pleckstrin, the mutations appeared not to cause the phosphorylation of additional site(s) outside the Phe67-Met133 CNBr fragment (Fig. 2C). In contrast, there was no phosphorylation apparent in the 8-kDa Phe67-Met133 CNBr fragment from the 3 Gly pleckstrin variant, even when 4 times as much of the protein was applied to the electrophoresis gel (Fig. 2C, second lane from left). Taken together, these results suggest that phosphorylation occurs primarily at one or more of the three sites that were also identified by the CNBr/IBZO digest. To determine the stoichiometry of phosphorylation, purified recombinant pleckstrin was incubated with purified protein kinase C α in the presence of [32P]ATP. Digestion of the resultant phosphoprotein with CNBr produced an 8-kDa fragment identical with that isolated from PMA-stimulated 32P-labeled platelets. The stoichiometry of phosphate incorporation was approximately 2:1 (data not shown).Figure 2:Phosphorylation mutants in vivo. COS-1 cells were transfected with wild type pleckstrin or pleckstrin variants in which the 3 potential sites were individually (S113G, T114G, and S117G) or collectively (3 Gly) mutated to glycine. A shows the relative phosphorylation of the pleckstrin variants when the cells were labeled with [32P]PO4 and stimulated with 50 nM PMA. The expressed pleckstrin was immunoprecipitated, fractionated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and quantitated by a PhosphorImager. B shows a rabbit anti-pleckstrin immunoblot demonstrating equivalent immunoprecipitation of the wild type and variant pleckstrin. C shows that the phosphorylated CNBr fragments produced from wild type and variant pleckstrin are similar in size to each other and to those produced from platelet pleckstrin. Note that the amount of protein applied to lane 2 of C is 4 times that applied to the other lanes. Despite this, there was no phosphorylation on the major 8-kDa CNBr fragment in the triple glycine mutant.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)Previous studies have shown that phosphorylated pleckstrin is comprised of multiple isoforms that can be resolved by two-dimensional electrophoresis(17Imaoka T. Lynham J.A. Haslam R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 11404-11414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Together with the present results, this suggests that pleckstrin normally becomes phosphorylated on residues Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117 near, but not within, the N-terminal PH domain and that no one site is predominant. Since elimination of any one of these sites has no effect on overall phosphorylation, there is apparently a compensatory increase in phosphorylation at the other sites, which is also consistent with the observation that the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of recombinant pleckstrin is 2:1 rather than 3:1. An alternative interpretation of the data, which is that phosphorylation actually occurs at unidentified sites elsewhere in the molecule and is indirectly affected by mutagenesis of Ser113, Thr114, and/or Ser117 is less likely when the results of the mutagenesis studies are combined with those from the CNBr/IBZO double digest of 32P-labeled platelet pleckstrin. The minor CNBr fragment that at times becomes phosphorylated, Ser197-Ala344, accounts for <10% of total phosphorylation and does not show increased phosphorylation when Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117 are individually mutated.Phosphorylation and FunctionPrevious reports have shown that a brief exposure to the phorbol ester, PMA, will inhibit agonist-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis in a variety of cells, including platelets(31Watson S.P.

This effect is seen in cells that express pleckstrin as well as those that do not and has been attributed variously to the phosphorylation of receptors, Gα and/or phospholipase C(19Leeb-Lundberg L.M.F. Cotecchia S. Lomasney J.W. DeBernardis J.F. Lefkowitz R.J. Caron M.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 5651-5655Crossref PubMed Scopus (285) Google Scholar, 20Kelleher D.J. Pessin J.E.

Chem. 1990; 265: 17941-17945Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have shown previously that when expressed in COS-1 or HEK-293 cells pleckstrin will inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis initiated by thrombin receptors, angiotensin-II AT1A receptors, muscarinic M1 receptors, and α2A receptors, as well as by TrkA receptors and a constitutively active variant of Gqα, while having no effect on the regulation of cAMP formation(18Abrams C.S. Wu H. Zhao W. Belmonte E. White D. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 14485-14492Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (45) Google Scholar). Since agonists that stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis cause pleckstrin to become phosphorylated, we next examined the impact of phosphorylation on pleckstrin's ability to inhibit inositol phosphate formation.To accomplish this, COS-1 cells were transfected with thrombin receptors and either wild type pleckstrin or the pleckstrin variant described above in which all three sites of phosphorylation were mutated to glycine. In the absence of PMA, wild type pleckstrin inhibited thrombin-induced [3H]inositol phosphate formation by 46% (Fig. 3). As we have shown previously, PMA in the absence of pleckstrin, or pleckstrin in the absence of PMA, each inhibited thrombin-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis by 40-50%. The combination of pleckstrin plus PMA was additive, inhibiting thrombin-induced [3H]inositol phosphate formation by 91%. Keeping in mind that thrombin, like PMA, causes the phosphorylation of pleckstrin, we found that replacing residues Ser113, Thr114, and Ser117 with glycine (3 Gly) reduced pleckstrin's ability to inhibit phosphoinositide hydrolysis by at least two-thirds in either the presence or absence of PMA (Fig. 3B). This was not due to a decrease in the level of pleckstrin expression, which was the same for the glycine variant as it was for wild type pleckstrin (Fig. 3C). Replacing the sites of phosphorylation with another neutral amino acid, alanine, had a similar effect (data not shown). These results suggest that phosphorylation is required for maximal inhibition of thrombin-induced phosphoinositide hydrolysis by pleckstrin, but also show that some inhibition can occur even in the absence of phosphorylation.Figure 3:Effect on phosphoinositide hydrolysis of substitution of the phosphorylation sites in pleckstrin with glycine residues.

The single gene for AβPP found on chromosome 21 encodes at least three distinct mRNAs produced by alternative splicing that result in three different sized proteins (AβPP695, AβPP751, and AβPP770) (Ponte et al., 1988; Tanzi et al., 1988; Kitaguchi et al., 1988). Two of these mRNAs code for proteins (AβPP751 and AβPP770) which contain a domain homologous to Kunitz-type protease inhibitors (KPI) (Ponte et al., 1988; Tanzi et al., 1988; Kitaguchi et al., 1988). The secreted isoforms of AβPP containing the KPI domain are identical to protease nexin-2 (PN-2) (Van Nostrand et al., 1989; Oltersdorf et al., 1989). amyloid β-protein precursor protease nexin-2, AβPP751, or AβPP770 Kunitz protease inhibitor human factor IXa activated human coagulation factor X thrombin-activated coagulation factor V human coagulation factor II (prothrombin) phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine vesicles polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain have been recognized to be potent inhibitors of trypsin, chymotrypsin, epidermal growth factor binding protein, and the γ subunit of nerve growth factor (Van Nostrand et al., 1989, 1990b; Oltersdorf et al., 1989). PN-2/AβPP which is present in high concentrations in platelets is a potent inhibitor of factor XIa (Van Nostrand et al., 1990a, 1990b; Smith et al., 1990). PN-2/AβPP also is an inhibitor of factor IXa (FIXa) in the assembly of the tenase complex on phospholipid vesicles (PSPC), platelets, and endothelial cells (Schmaier et al., 1993, 1995). Similarly, a homologue of PN-2/AβPP, amyloid β-protein precursor-like protein-2, has been shown to have inhibitory activity against hemostatic enzymes factors XIa, IXa, and Xa (Petersen et al., 1994; Sprecher et al., 1993; Van Nostrand et al., 1994). These studies suggest that this family of proteins may have a regulatory role in hemostasis. While examining the ability of PN-2/AβPP to inhibit factor IXa on non-biologic surfaces, we found in one assay that the degree of factor IXa inhibition could not be fully accounted for by its inactivation alone. The present investigation shows that PN-2/AβPP also is an inhibitor of factor Xa alone and when assembled on PSPC in the prothrombinase complex. Recognition that PN-2/AβPP's inhibits factor Xa enlarges its role as a regulator of hemostasis. PN-2/AβPP (AβPP751) was purified from fibroblast culture media using techniques of heparin affinity chromatography and immunoaffinity chromatography as described previously (Van Nostrand et al., 1990b). The KPI domain of PN-2/AβPP, which was provided by Dr. Steven Wagner, Salk Institute Biotechnology/Industrial Associates, La Jolla, CA, was produced in a recombinant yeast expression system and purified as described previously (Wagner et al., 1992). The protease inhibitory activities of purified PN-2/AβPP and KPI domain were determined by neutralization with active-site titrated trypsin (Van Nostrand et al., 1990b; Wagner et al., 1992). AβPP695 was obtained and purified like PN-2/AβPP from culture media from human glioblastoma U-138 cells stably transfected to overexpress it (Davis-Salinas et al., 1994). Human factors IXa (FIXa), Xa (FXa), X, and II (FII) were purchased from Enzyme Research Laboratories, South Bend, IN. Human FIXa on nonreduced sodium dodecyl sulfate-13% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) showed two bands at 52 and 33 kDa, and when reduced with 2%β-mercaptoethanol, four bands at 29, 25, 14, and 12 kDa. The 25- and 12-kDa bands seen on reduced SDS-PAGE represented only 5-10% of the total protein in all preparations. Human FXa was activated with Russel viper venom. On reduced 15% SDS-PAGE, FXa consisted of three majors bands at 36, 34, and 24 kDa. These bands account for 90% of the protein present. Prothrombin on nonreduced 8% SDS-PAGE was a single band at 70 kDa; upon reduction, the apparent molecular mass increased to 80 kDa. All FIXa and FXa used in these investigations were active-site titrated with antithrombin III (American Diagnostica, Greenwich, CT) using a modified procedure of Griffith et al.(1985) as previously reported (Schmaier et al., 1993). Purified thrombin-activated bovine factor Va (FVa) was purchased from Haematologic Technologies Inc., Essex Junction, VT. This protein on nonreduced 8% SDS-PAGE had two major bands at 100 and 68 kDa; upon reduction, two major bands were seen at 97 and 75 kDa, respectively, and two minor bands accounting for less than 10% of the protein present at 51 and 33 kDa. Human α-thrombin (3250 units/mg) was generously provided by Dr. John W. Fenton III, N. Y. State Department of Health, Albany, NY. Phospholipid vesicles were prepared from a mixture of L-α-phosphatidylserine (Sigma) and L-α-phosphatidylcholine (Sigma) (25/75, mol/mol) that were dried in a glass test tube under a stream of nitrogen (Rawala-Sheikh et al., 1990). The dried material was resuspended in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.175 M NaCl, pH 7.5, and sonicated for 30 s multiple times on ice over 60 min (Rawala-Sheikh et al., 1990). After sonication, some preparations were ultracentrifuged at 100,000 × g to produce a homogenous suspension free of large particles and multilamellar liposomes (Barenholz et al., 1977). No difference in the cofactor activity of the phosphatidylserine/phosphatidylcholine vesicles (PSPC) was noted whether they were ultracentrifuged or not. The PSPC were stored at 4°C. The enzymatic activity of human FIXa was measured by its ability to activate human factor X using polylysine as an artifical surface (Schmaier et al., 1993, 1995; Lundblad and Roberts, 1982; Griffith et al., 1985; McCord et al., 1990). Factor IXa (4.45 nM) was incubated with factor X (400 nM) in 0.1 M triethanolamine, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol (Mr = 8000), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 60 nM polylysine for 40 min at 20-25°C. At the end of the incubation, an aliquot of the activated factor X solution was added to a solution of 0.4 mM tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Sigma). Hydrolysis proceeded for 60 min at 20-25°C and the reaction was terminated by the addition of 50% acetic acid after which the optical density reading was obtained at 405 nm. FIXa alone had no amidolytic activity on the chromogenic substrate. The FIXa used in this assay activated ~0.5% of the added factor X. When inhibition studies were performed with PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain, the inhibitor was incubated with FIXa for 5 min at room temperature prior to the addition of factor X. All inhibition constants determined from the results of the chromogenic assay were calculated from the residual activity at end point. Factor Xa activity (1-2.5 nM) was measured in 0.1 M triethanolamine, 0.1 M NaCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.1% polyethylene glycol (Mr = 8000), 0.2% bovine serum albumin, and 60 nM polylysine or 0.02 M Hepes, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 2 mM Ca2+, and 0.1% polyethylene glycol using 0.4 mM tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide (Sigma) for 35 min at 20-25°C. In certain experiments, the polylysine was removed from the buffer. In other experiments 25 μM PSPC, 4.8 units/ml thrombin-activated factor VIII (FVIIIa), or 5 nM thrombin-activated bovine factor Va (FVa) were added to the reaction mixture in the presence of 2 mM Ca2+. The reaction was terminated by the addition of an equal volume of 50% acetic acid after which the optical density was obtained at 405 nm. Hydrolysis of the substrate was linear over the time of the reaction. When inhibition studies were performed with PN-2/AβPP, its KPI domain, or antithrombin III, the inhibitor (2-10 nM) was incubated with FXa (1 nM) for 5 min at room temperature prior to the addition of the chromogenic substrate. All inhibition constants determined from the results of the chromogenic assay were calculated from the residual activity at end point. When investigations with antithrombin III were performed, 1 unit/ml heparin (Elkins-Sinn, Cherry Hill, NJ) was included in the reaction mixture. Simultaneous samples of human FIXa activation of factor X in the presence of polylysine were prepared for both chromogenic and immunochemical determination of factor X activation. Immunochemical determination of activation of factor X by FIXa was measured as nanomoles of factor X activation peptide liberated as detected by radioimmunoassay using an antiserum directed to the factor X activation peptide (Bauer et al., 1989). These assays were generously performed by Dr. Kenneth A. Bauer, Beth Israel Hospital, Boston, MA. The percent liberation of factor X activation peptide in PN-2/AβPP- or its KPI domain-treated samples was calculated from the ratio of nanomole activation peptide released when the inhibitor was present versus the nanomole activation peptide released when no inhibitor was present times 100. The percent liberated peptide in the inhibitor-treated sample was utilized as a measure of residual FIXa activity to calculate inhibition constants. Activation of human prothrombin (FII) (1000 nM) by FXa (1 nM) in the presence of 25 μM PSPC, 5 nM bovine factor Va, and 0.7 mM HD-Phe-Pip-Arg-p-nitroanilide-2HCl (S2238) (Kabi-Pharmacia, Franklin OH) was performed at 37°C in 0.025 M Hepes, 0.175 M NaCl, pH 7.5, containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin and 2 mM Ca2+ (Rosing et al., 1980, 1993). After a 4-min hydrolysis, the reaction was stopped with an equal volume of 50% acetic acid and read in a microplate reader at 405 nm. Factor Xa itself did not hydrolyze this substrate. Preliminary studies revealed that at a 4-min activation time, there was sufficient substrate present such that hydrolysis was on an upward slope and there was no substrate exhaustion over the time of measurement. When investigations with inhibitors were performed, FXa (1 nM) and its inhibitor (PN-2/AβPP, KPI domain, or antithrombin III) (2-10 nM) were preincubated or not with PSPC and FVa for 5 min followed by starting the reaction with the addition of FII and the chromogenic substrate. Simultaneous samples of FXa activation of FII in the presence of PSPC and FVa were prepared for both chromogenic and immunochemical determination of FII activation. Prothrombin fragment F1+2 (Lau et al., 1979) was measured using a commercial kit from Baxter Diagnostics, Inc., graciously provided by Viola Sotomayer of Baxter Diagnostics. The percent liberation of prothrombin fragment F1+2 in PN-2/AβPP- or its KPI domain-treated samples was calculated from the ratio of nanomole of activation peptide released when the inhibitor was present versus the nanomole of activation peptide released when no inhibitor was present times 100. The percent liberated peptide in the inhibitor-treated sample was utilized as a measure of residual FXa activity to calculate inhibition constants. The Km and Vmax of human FXa activation of FII in the presence of PSPC (25 μM) and FVa (5 nM) were determined by measuring the rate of FII activation (20-1600 nM) by 1.0 nM FXa in four independent experiments. The mean ± S.E. of each point performed in triplicate in four individual experiments were analyzed on a double reciprocal plot by linear regression. The Km and Vmax were determined from a substrate/velocity plot and the negative reciprocal of the x- and y-intercepts of the double reciprocal plots, respectively. The nanomolar α-thrombin formed was determined by comparing the level of hydrolysis seen in the present assay with the level of hydrolysis measured by known concentrations of human α-thrombin under identical assay conditions. The turnover numbers for factor IIa formation (kcat) were determined by the ratio of the maximum concentration of factor IIa formed (Vmax) divided by the concentration of the forming enzyme (FXa). The stoichiometry of FXa inhibition by PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain was determined by nonlinear regression as previously reported (Schmaier et al., 1993). Briefly, FXa at 1 nM was added to 2-100 nM inhibitor (PN-2/AβPP or its KPI domain) and the residual FXa activity was determined. The plotted x-intercept of the inhibitor concentration versus the % inhibition of FXa activity indicated the concentration of added inhibitor to the known amount of added FXa. The equilibrium inhibition constants (Ki) presented for PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain were calculated as previously reported (Van Nostrand et al., 1990b) by the procedure of Bieth(1984) for tight-binding inhibitors using the following equation: Ki,app = {[(I)/(1-a)] - (E)}/(1/a), to yield an apparent Ki where (I) is the inhibitor concentration, (E) is the factor Xa concentration, and a is the residual factor Xa activity after incubation with the inhibitor. The actual Ki was calculated using the subsequent equation: Ki = Ki,app/1 + ([S]/Km), where [S] is the concentration of the substrate, factor II, and Km is the Michaelis constant for the factor Xa-factor II (protease-substrate) reaction (Bieth, 1984). The second-order association rate constants (kassoc) for each of the inhibitors were calculated using the integrated second-order rate equation: k” = [(1/I-E)•ln E(I - EI)/I(E - EI)]/t, where E is the FXa concentration, I is the inhibitor concentration, EI is the concentration of the FXa-inhibitor complex, and t is the time of incubation in minutes (Gigli et al., 1970). Complex formation between PN-2/AβPP and FXa was demonstrated by solid phase binding assay. Microtiter plates were coated with PN-2/AβPP (250 ng) in 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 9.6, and then blocked with 1% radioimmunoassay grade bovine serum albumin (Sigma). After washing, the wells were incubated with FXa (50 ng) followed by a mouse anti-human FX/Xa antibody (1 μg/ml) (American Diagnostica, Inc., Greenwich, CT) in 0.01 M sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 0.05% Tween 20. After further incubation and washing, a rabbit anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma number 2429 at 1/1000) was added. The color reaction was initiated by the addition of p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium (1 mg/ml) in 0.05 M Na2CO3, 1 mM MgCl, pH 9.8. An additional solid phase binding assay for complex determination was performed by linking FXa (50 ng) in 0.1 M Na2CO3, pH 9.6, to the microtiter plate. After blocking the cuvette wells with bovine serum albumin, they successively were incubated with PN-2/AβPP (250 ng) and monoclonal antibody P2-1 to PN-2/AβPP in ascites fluid (Van Nostrand et al., 1989) followed by detection with a rabbit anti-mouse antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Sigma number 2429 at 1/1000 dilution). Factor Xa was incubated with PN-2/AβPP (1 to 16 parts factor Xa to 1 part PN-2/AβPP, mol/mol) in 0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.4, containing 2 mM Ca2+ for 1 h at room temperature. The reaction was stopped with sample buffer for SDS-PAGE. The PN-2/AβPP samples (1.0 μg/lane) were electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-PAGE and then electroblotted onto nitrocellulose. After blocking with Blotto, the protein was detected using monoclonal antibody P2-1 followed by a second antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (Van Nostrand et al., 1990b) using the chemiluminescence system of Amersham. Factor Xa cleaved PN-2/AβPP in 4:1 (mol/mol) ratio of FXa to PN-2/AβPP was electrophoresed on 15-22 and 6% SDS-PAGEs, respectively, followed by electroblotting onto a Problot membrane (Applied Bioscience) and detected by staining. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequences of an 8.2-kDa peptide seen on the 15-22% SDS-PAGE and of the cleaved PN-2/AβPPs at 116, 97, and 90 kDa seen on the 6% SDS-PAGE were determined from the Problot membrane in the Protein and Carbohydrate Structure Facility at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI. Significance of difference in results between groups was measured by t test for groups of unpaired data. PN-2/AβPP was found to produce a Ki of FIXa of 1.5 × 10-10M (a mean of two experiments) on chromogenic detection of a polylysine based-factor X activation assay versus a Ki of FIXa of 6.9 × 10-9M when the same samples were studied on a factor X activation peptide assay. This 46-fold difference in inhibitory ability of the same samples on two different factor IXa enzymatic assays suggested that on the chromogenic assay, whose results are determined indirectly through factor X activation, additional inhibition must have occurred than that of FIXa alone. This result prompted the present investigation to determine if PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain were direct inhibitors of FXa. In independent experiments, the Km of FXa for the chromogenic substrate N-tosyl-Gly-Pro-Arg-p-nitroanilide was found to be 0.26 ± 0.1 mM. Using conditions identical to the polylysine-based FX activation assay by FIXa, PN-2/AβPP inhibited FXa with a Ki of 1.6 ± 0.4 × 10-10M (Table 1). If polylysine were excluded from the buffer of the assay, PN-2/AβPP inhibited FXa with a Ki of 4.5 ± 2.3 × 10−8M (Table 1). These data indicated that polylysine itself potentiated the inhibition of FXa by PN-2/AβPP as measured on a chromogenic assay. AβPP695, an isoform of AβPP which does not contain the KPI domain, did not inhibit FXa when used in up to 10-fold molar excess to enzyme. The discordance in inhibition of FIXa by PN-2/AβPP of the same samples between the chromogenic and FXa activation peptide assays also can be explained by the inhibitor blocking generated FXa. Additional investigations were performed to determine the degree of FXa inhibition by PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain under various conditions. Similar to the results seen with isolated FXa and PN-2/AβPP, the presence of PSPC, FVIIIa, and/or FVa did not influence the degree of inhibition of FXa by PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain (Table 1). These data indicated PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain were equipotent inhibitors of FXa. Furthermore, the stoichiometry of FXa inhibition by PN-2/AβPP was 1:1. However, at 4 orders of magnitude molar excess KPI domain to FXa, FXa activity was not reduced to zero.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Investigations next were performed to determine if FXa and PN-2/AβPP formed a complex as determine by solid phase binding assay (Fig. 1). When PN-2/AβPP was coupled to microtiter plate wells, FXa specifically bound to the PN-2/AβPP as detected by an antibody to FXa followed by a second antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1, top). Likewise, when FXa was linked to microtiter plate wells, PN-2/AβPP specifically bound to the FXa as detected by an antibody to PN-2/AβPP followed by a secondary antibody conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (Fig. 1, bottom). These studies indicated that FXa and PN-2/AβPP formed a complex characteristic of Kunitz-type inhibitors. Additional investigations showed that PN-2/AβPP was a substrate of FXa (Fig. 2). When PN-2/AβPP was incubated with increasing concentrations of FXa (1-16-fold molar excess), there was a decrease in the large, dark 124-kDa band of the starting material on an immunoblot of a nonreduced 6% SDS-PAGE and the appearance of 3 new bands at 116, 97, and 90 kDa, respectively, that migrated further into the gel (Fig. 2A). At a presumed 1:1 molar ratio of FXa to PN-2/AβPP some cleavage in PN-2/AβPP occurred (Fig. 2A). As the concentration of FXa to PN-2/AβPP increased from 4:1 to 16:1, all of the 124-kDa starting material was converted into lower molecular mass bands at 116, 97, and 90 kDa. Four-fold molar excess FXa to PN-2/AβPP liberated a single 8.2-kDa peptide which was detected on a reduced 18% SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The amino terminus sequence of this peptide was LEVPTDGNAG … which is the known amino-terminal sequence of PN-2/AβPP after cleavage of its signal peptide at alanine 17 (Fig. 3). The liberated peptide was a single peptide because on multiple gel electrophoreses using different percentage acrylamide gels (15-22%), only this single amino-terminal sequence was obtained. These data indicated that FXa liberated an amino-terminal peptide from PN-2/AβPP.Figure 3:The FXa cleavage site in PN-2/AβPP. The figure is the amino-terminal sequence of PN-2/AβPP using the single letter code for each amino acid. The arrow after alanine 17 represents the cleavage site for the single peptide for PN-2/AβPP (Ponte et al., 1988). The arrow after arginine 102 represents the FXa cleavage site in PN-2/AβPP.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) Further investigations sought the FXa cleavage site on the amino-terminal side of PN-2/AβPP. When PN-2/AβPP (a major band at 124 kDa and two minor bands at 105 and 98 kDa) was cleaved by 4-fold molar excess FXa, three new corresponding lower molar mass bands were detected (a major one at 115 kDa and two minor bands at 97 and 90 kDa) when the sample was reduced and electrophoresed on a 6% SDS-PAGE, as detected by a Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. 2B). The amino-terminals of each of these three bands were sequenced and a single amino acid sequence (KQCKTHPHFV …) was found for all three of these bands (Fig. 3). These data indicated that molar excess FXa to PN-2/AβPP cleaved PN-2/AβPP at a single site after arginine 102. Additional investigations showed that AβPP695, a form of AβPP which does not contain the KPI domain and does not inhibit FXa, also was a substrate of the enzyme (Fig. 2C). These data indicated that inhibition of FXa was independent of the inhibitor being a FXa substrate. Further isolated KPI domain was not cleaved by FXa (data not shown). The possible importance of PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain to inhibit FXa is dependent upon whether these proteins produce inhibition in biologic assays. Studies were performed to determine if PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain could inhibit FXa in the prothrombinase complex. Initial experiments determined the Km and kcat of prothrombin activation on phospholipid vesicles in the presence of FVa. By double reciprocal plot, FXa activation of FII in the presence of PSPC and FVa was shown to have a mean Km of 0.62 μM (range 0.23-1.6 μM) with a Vmax of 7 nM α-thrombin formed min−1 (range 3.6-19.1 nM min−1) (Fig. 4). These values calculated to a kcat of 7 min−1 and kcat/Km of 10.2 μM−1 min−1. Both PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain blocked FXa activity in the prothrombinase complex (Table 2). When FXa and PN-2/AβPP or its KPI domain were preincubated for 5 min with PSPC and FVa prior to the addition of FII and chromogenic substrate, the Ki were 1.9 ± 1.5 × 10−8M and 1.3 ± 0.8 × 10−8M, respectively (Table 2). These results only were 2.8- and 4.9-fold more inhibition for PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain, respectively, than the Ki determined (5.3 ± 2.5 × 10−8M and 6.4 ± 2.3 × 10−8M, respectively) when the incubation mixture included the inhibitor, PSPC, FVa, and FII and the reaction was started by the addition of FXa (Table 2). Under these latter conditions, 100-fold molar excess of substrate (i.e. 1 μM FII) had little influence on PN-2/AβPP (2-10 nM) blocking 1 nM FXa. Regardless of the order of addition of reactants, both PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain inhibited FXa to the same degree, indicating that the inhibitory domain of PN-2/AβPP for FXa was confined to the KPI region and not due to being a competing substrate. In the prothrombinase complex, 4 orders of magnitude molar excess KPI domain did not bring the level of FXa activity to zero. When samples were prepared for measurement of FXa enzymatic activity by a chromogenic assay and measurement of prothrombin fragment F1+2, the degree of inhibition seen was the same (Table 3). These data indicated that PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain did not inhibit α-thrombin, consistent with other reports (Van Nostrand et al., 1990a; Smith et al., 1990; Schmaier et al., 1993).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Investigations were next performed to determine the comparative inhibitory abilities of PN-2/AβPP versus antithrombin III and heparin on isolated FXa and FXa in the prothrombinase complex (Table 4). When PN-2/AβPP was incubated for 5 min with isolated FXa in the presence of polylysine, its second-order association rate constant (kassoc) (1.4 ± 0.4 × 107M−1 min−1) for FXa inhibition was 5-fold higher than that of antithrombin III and heparin (kassoc = 3.0 ± 3.3 × 106M−1 min−1). Interestingly if heparin were present in the reaction mixture with PN-2/AβPP, no inhibition of FXa was detected (data not shown). Alternatively, if polylysine was absent from the reaction mixture, the inhibitory abilities of PN-2/AβPP and antithrombin III were reversed. PN-2/AβPP inhibited FXa with a kassoc = 3.0 ± 2.0 × 105M−1 min−1; antithrombin III and heparin blocked FXa with a kassoc = 1.3 ± 0.3 × 107M−1 min−1. The data indicated that polylysine had opposite effects on both PN-2/AβPP and antithrombin III. In the prothrombinase complex, the biologically relevant assay, the kassoc = 1.8 ± 0.7 × 106M−1 min−1 for PN-2/AβPP was essentially the same as the kassoc = 3.0 ± 0.2 × 106M−1 min−1 seen with antithrombin III and heparin. These data indicated that in the prothrombinase complex, PN-2/AβPP in the absence of heparin and antithrombin III and heparin were equipotent inhibitors of FXa.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The present investigations expand the coagulation protease inhibitory spectrum of PN-2/AβPP. Although first recognized as a hemostatic inhibitor to factor XIa (Smith et al., 1990; Van Nostrand et al., 1990b), recent investigations have shown that PN-2/AβPP also is a potent inhibitor of factor IXa (Schmaier et al., 1993, 1995) and its KPI domain has some inhibitory activity to tissue factor-factor VIIa (Dennis and Lazarus, 1994a, 1994b). Initial reports suggested that PN-2/AβPP was not an inhibitor of FXa to any great extent (Smith et al., 1990; Van Nostrand et al., 1990b); however, other reports, consistent with coagulant assays, suggest otherwise (Kitaguchi et al., 1990; Petersen et al., 1994; Schmaier et al., 1993). Our investigations indicate that PN-2/AβPP is a direct inhibitor of FXa both as an isolated protein and in the prothrombinase complex. The inhibitory activity of PN-2/AβPP resides completely in its KPI domain because both the parent protein and its isolated KPI domain inhibit FXa to the same degree. Although the stoichiometry of inhibition appears to be 1:1, inhibition by the KPI domain does not appear to be active site-directed. Four orders of magnitude for the KPI domain to FXa does not reduce the FXa activity to zero, both in assays of isolated FXa and FXa in the prothrombinase complex. These data are different from those found with FIXa. Infinite concentrations of KPI domain abolished FIXa activity in the tenase complex (Schmaier et al., 1995). Nonactive site-directed FXa inhibitors also recently have been described for the hookworm-derived inhibitor of human FXa (Cappello et al., 1995). We found that when using a polylysine-based FX activation assay, some of the measured inhibition of FIXa by PN-2/AβPP can be accounted for by PN-2/AβPP inhibiting generating FXa. Since the degree of FXa generated in this assay is small (1-2 nM), the concentration of PN-2/AβPP or KPI domain present in the assays would have been sufficient to inhibit both FIXa and the generated FXa (Schmaier et al., 1993, 1995). It also was of interest to learn that polylysine itself potentiated the degree of inhibition of FXa by PN-2/AβPP and reduced that of antithrombin III/heparin. The mechanism for this independent activity of polylysine is not known. Since polylysine itself can be an independent variable contributing to PN-2/AβPP's inhibitory ability, it should probably be avoided in assays of FIXa. In addition to inhibition of enzymatic activity, we were able to demonstrate a physical interaction between PN-2/AβPP and FXa. On a solid phase binding assay, specific complex formation was detected between PN-2/AβPP and FXa. This information suggests that PN-2/AβPP is an inhibitor of FXa of the slow, tight class characteristic of Kunitz type inhibitors. PN-2/AβPP was also a substrate of FXa when the enzyme was in molar excess to inhibitor. It appears that FXa proteolyzes the major band of PN-2/AβPP at 124 kDa and the two minor bands (105 and 98 kDa) into corresponding lower molecular mass species (116, 97, and 90 kDa, respectively), each with the same new amino terminus as seen on immunoblot and Coomassie-stained gels. It is possible that FXa also cleaves PN-2/AβPP at a single point on the carboxyl-terminal side of the protein liberating an approximate 30-34-kDa protein. This result would explain the intensification of the post-cleaved 90-kDa band of PN-2/AβPP seen in Fig. 2, A and B. However, we never have found any evidence of such a band on our Coomassie-stained gels since it would be migrating with one of the subunits of FXa and thus be hidden. The fact that PN-2/AβPP is a substrate to molar excess FXa does not indicate that its mechanism of inhibition of the enzyme is substrate inhibition. First, AβPP695 is a substrate of FXa but it is not a FXa inhibitor. Second, the isolated KPI domain of PN-2/AβPP which does not contain the FXa cleavage site inhibits FXa to the same degree as its parent protein. Third, the isolated KPI domain is not cleaved by FXa. It is of interest that FXa cleaves PN-2/AβPP through its heparin binding domain. Since heparin neutralizes PN-2/AβPP's inhibitory activity on FXa, cleavage through this domain may preserve the inhibitory function of PN-2/AβPP for FXa. PN-2/AβPP is a potent anticoagulant of FXa in the prothrombinase complex. In our laboratory the Km and kcat/Km ratio of prothrombin activation by FXa is 0.62 μM and 10.2 μM−1 min−1, respectively, results which are comparable to the findings of other investigators (Krishnaswamy et al., 1987) using a fluorescent marker instead of a chromogenic substrate to monitor prothrombin activation. The degree of inhibition of FXa by PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain is to the same order of magnitude in the prothrombinase complex as with the isolated pure enzyme. Regardless of the order of addition of reactants, PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain inhibit FXa on PSPC. PSPC in the presence of FVa must have oriented FXa such that it was susceptible to inhibition by PN-2/AβPP or its KPI domain even though the inhibitors were competing with 5 orders of magnitude more substrate. The finding that PN-2/AβPP and its KPI domain inhibit FXa in the prothrombinase complex make this class of inhibitors more important than what would be appreciated by just examining isolated FXa inhibition. Since PN-2/AβPP is not a plasma protein but rather a cell surface-associated protease inhibitor, influencing FXa activity in the prothrombinase complex suggests that this class of Kunitz-type protease inhibitors may be important regulators of various hemostatic enzymes. In fact, PN-2/AβPP and its homologue, amyloid β-protein precursor-like protein-2, may constitute a new class of serine protease inhibitors modulating hemostasis (Sprecher et al., 1993). Although our investigations show that artificial agents can influence the degree of FXa inhibition by PN-2/AβPP or antithrombin III and heparin, in the prothrombinase complex assembly, PN-2/AβPP and antithrombin and heparin were comparable inhibitors. In the absence of added heparin, the degree of antithrombin III inhibition of FXa was orders of magnitude less potent than that seen with PN-2/AβPP. In plasma, antithrombin III would be the predominant inhibitor because its plasma concentration is 4 μMversus the 30 nM level of PN-2/AβPP which may be achievable in plasma when platelets are activated (Van Nostrand, et al., 1991). However, it is not known which may be the predominant inhibitor on cell membranes. The second-order rate constants for antithrombin III and heparin inhibition of FXa that we obtained were 1-2 orders of magnitude higher than that reported by other investigators (Olson et al., 1992; Ellis et al., 1982). Differences in heparin preparations and concentrations and ionic strengths in the buffers may account for these variations. Alternatively, in the presence of heparin, PN-2/AβPP did not inhibit FXa. PN-2/AβPP is known to have a heparin binding domain which allows heparin to potentiate its inhibition of factor XIa but not factor IXa (Smith et al., 1990; Van Nostrand et al., 1990b; Schmaier et al., 1993). It is of interest that the FXa cleavage site on PN-2/AβPP is at arginine 102 which is in the heparin binding region of the protein (Small et al., 1994). Excess FXa could be preventing PN-2/AβPP from associating with heparin on cell membranes. These investigations show that PN-2/AβPP in the absence of heparin and antithrombin III in the presence of heparin are the naturally occurring inhibitors of FXa. Isolated KPI domain of PN-2/AβPP is a fragment from a naturally occurring human protein which may have potential use as an anticoagulant since its inhibitor activity is equal to the tick anticoagulant peptide (Waxman et al., 1990).

INTRODUCTIONMast cells are the primary effectors in immediate type hypersensitivity reactions. Upon exposure to allergen, mast cells are induced to rapidly secrete preformed mediators from cytoplasmic granules. Mast cells bind IgE avidly via specific, high affinity Fc receptors, termed Fc∊RI. Fc∊RI are heterotetrameric complexes comprising an IgE-binding α subunit, a β subunit, and two γ subunits(1Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev.

The cytoplasmic domains of the β and γ subunits each contain two tyrosine residues, which are located within a conserved consensus sequence termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) 1The abbreviations used are: ITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifMIRRmultichain immune recognition receptorAPTanti-phosphotyrosineDNPdinitrophenolDNP-HSADNP-conjugated human serum albumin. or antigen recognition activation motif(3Samelson L.E.

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation following engagement of the Fc∊RI is thought to be mediated by the nontransmembrane protein-tyrosine kinases Lyn and Syk. Lyn, a member of the Src family of protein-tyrosine kinases, is constitutively associated with Fc∊RI(15), binding to the unactivated β subunit(7Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O.

The purpose of this study was to gain a further understanding of mast cell stimulation by examining the timing and order of activation of nontransmembrane protein-tyrosine kinases following Fc∊RI engagement.

Mouse monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine (APT) 5H1 and rabbit polyclonal APT have been described previously(24Burkhardt A.L. Stealey B. Rowley R.B. Mahajan S. Prendergast M. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. J.

The cells were washed in serum-free medium and resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/ml. Activation was triggered with the addition of dinitrophenol-conjugated human serum albumin (DNP-HSA).Ca2+ MobilizationThe concentration of intracellular free Ca2+ was measured using the Ca2+ sensitive dye Indo-1 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) and a Coulter EPICS Elite flow cytometer. The procedure used has been described in detail elsewhere(27Rabinovitch P.S. June C.H. Grossmann A. Ledbetter J.A. J. Immunol. 1986; 137: 952-961PubMed Google Scholar). The data were analyzed using Multitime software (Phoenix Flow Systems, San Diego, CA).Immunoprecipitation, Kinase Assays, and ImmunoblottingCell lysis, immunoprecipitation, immune complex kinase assays, and immunoblotting were performed as described previously(28Tsygankov A.Y.

Biol. 1988; 8: 4353-4361Crossref PubMed Scopus (131) Google Scholar).RESULTSMast Cell Signal Transduction Pathways Are Stimulated by Fc∊RI EngagementPT 18 mouse mast cells were sensitized by incubating the cells for 1 h with an allergen-specific IgE (anti-DNP). The sensitized cells were then stimulated by the addition of DNP-HSA and lysed as a function of time over the course of 30 min. The lysates were analyzed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting to establish the extent and timing of protein tyrosine phosphorylation (Fig. 1A). Immunoblot analysis reveals a complex pattern of protein tyrosine phosphorylation peaking and ebbing with different kinetics. Fc∊RI engagement results in the immediate tyrosine phosphorylation of a number of proteins, with the most prominent signals appearing at molecular masses of 30, 38-40, 50, 55-60, 72, 90, and 110 kDa. In general, the wave of tyrosine phosphorylation begins very soon after stimulation, reaches a peak at 1-3 min, and has returned to unstimulated levels at 10-30 min.The reactivity of IgE-sensitized PT-18 cells to DNP-HSA was also examined by monitoring changes in the concentration of intracellular free calcium [Ca2+]i. The concentration-response curve for DNP-HSA is Gaussian in that addition of low levels of ligand produce small increases in [Ca2+]i, moderate levels produce a maximal increase in [Ca2+]i that is sustained, and higher levels produce a maximal [Ca2+]i rise that lacks the sustained phase. The response of PT 18 cells to moderate (2.5 ng/ml) to high (100 ng/ml) concentrations of DNP-HSA are shown in Fig. 1B.Tyrosine Phosphorylation of Fc∊RI Component ProteinsAmong the proteins phosphorylated on tyrosine following receptor cross-linking are the β and γ subunits of Fc∊RI. To determine the kinetics of receptor activation, the tyrosine phosphorylation of β and γ was evaluated as a function of time after receptor engagement (Fig. 2). Tyrosine phosphorylation of Fc∊RI-β and Fc∊RI-γ can be detected as quickly as 10 s following Fc∊RI engagement. Phosphorylation of both β and γ follows the same kinetics. The peak of tyrosine phosphorylation occurs at 1 min and diminishes to near basal levels by 30 min poststimulation. The abundance of Fc∊RI-β and Fc∊RI-γ was unchanged over the time course, thus indicating that changes in Fc∊RI-β and Fc∊RI-γ APT reactivity reflect increased tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, upon activation, a lower mobility form of Fc∊RI-γ appears. This tyrosine-phosphorylated form of Fc∊RI-γ has an apparent molecular mass of approximately 10 kDa compared with an apparent molecular mass of 6 kDa for the nonphosphorylated form. By comparing the abundance of Fc∊RI-γ detected by immunoprecipitation/Fc∊RI-γ blot (Fig. 2B, lowerpanel) with the APT reactivity (Fig. 2B, upperpanel), it is evident that the phosphorylated form that appears after activation accounts for only a small amount of the Fc∊RI-γ in the cell.Figure 2:Time course of Fc∊RI-β (A) and Fc∊RI-γ (B) tyrosine phosphorylation. PT18 cells were stimulated with IgE/DNA, lysed at the indicated times, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the indicated proteins.

The enzymatic activity of protein-tyrosine kinases in these samples was established through the use of in vitro kinase autophosphorylation assays (Fig. 3). The kinase activity of Lyn increased immediately following receptor engagement, reaching its maximum level at the initial time point of 10 s. Only a brief spike of Lyn activation is observed, with activity falling back to an unstimulated level by 30 s (Fig. 3A, upperpanel). The Src family member Fyn is also produced by PT18 cells but at a barely detectable level (data not shown).Figure 3:Time course of Lyn, Syk, and Fer enzyme activation. PT18 cells were stimulated with IgE/DNA, lysed at the indicated times and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the indicated protein-tyrosine kinases. The protein kinase activities of the immunoprecipitated protein-tyrosine kinases were evaluated in immune complex autophosphorylation assays (upperpanels), or immune complex kinase assays using rabbit muscle enolase as an exogenous substrate (lowerpanels).View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)The catalytic activity of Syk was also found to increase following Fc∊RI engagement. Syk activity was elevated immediately, but it did not reach its peak level of activity until about 30 s poststimulation (Fig. 3B, upperpanel). The activity then slowly decayed, returning to basal levels by 30 min.The kinase activity of Fer was also examined to determine if Fer could be responsible for the protein band(s) at approximately 94 kDa detected by APT immunoblotting. The protein kinase activity of Fer was found to increase following addition of DNP-HSA. Fer activity was increased by 10 s, with a maximum level attained by 1 min. Fer activity was reduced to unstimulated levels by 10-30 min.The activity profiles of Lyn, Syk, and Fer determined by autophosphorylation were confirmed by evaluating the ability of these enzymes to phosphorylate an exogenous substrate. In each case, the ability of each enzyme to catalyze the phosphorylation of enolase roughly paralleled changes in autophosphorylation demonstrated in the previous assays. Lyn was again activated immediately, but the magnitude of the difference between unstimulated and stimulated activities toward enolase is much smaller than observed in the autophosphorylation assays. The capacity of Syk to phosphorylate enolase correlated with its ability to catalyze autophosphorylation. Similarly, the kinase activity profile of Fer toward enolase matched that observed in the autophosphorylation assay.The correlation between the enzymatic activation and tyrosine phosphorylation states of these enzymes was established by determining reactivity of each protein with APT antibodies following Fc∊RI engagement. The results of these experiments are presented in Fig. 4. Syk was unreactive to APT antibody when isolated from unstimulated cells, but its immunoreactivity increased significantly following receptor engagement (Fig. 4A). APT immunoreactivity was high from 30 s to 3 min, and then it decreased to a low but detectable level by 30 min. The abundance of Syk was not altered in the course of these experiments. Thus, the reactivity of Syk with APT antibody paralleled its enzymatic activation as determined by both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of exogenous substrate. The APT reactivity of Fer also increased upon stimulation of the PT18 cells, reaching a maximum at 30 s to 1 min and decreasing to unstimulated level by 30 min. The abundance of Fer was constant over this time course. As observed with Syk, changes in the tyrosine phosphorylation state of Fer correlate with changes in its enzymatic activity.Figure 4:Time course of tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk (A) and Fer (B). PT18 cells were stimulated with IgE/DNA, lysed at the indicated times, and immunoprecipitated with antibodies specific for the indicated protein-tyrosine kinases.

The concept of an ordered activation of enzymes being necessary to propagate such signals has been recently established in both B- and T-cells(17Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar, 24Burkhardt A.L. Stealey B. Rowley R.B. Mahajan S. Prendergast M. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). We have found that this observation extends to mast cells, albeit with a compressed time scale. Furthermore, we report evidence that in addition to Lyn and Syk, the nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase Fer participates in mast cell signaling and is part of the ordered activation scheme.The results of our immune complex kinase assays show that the enzymatic activation of the Src family member Lyn after Fc∊RI cross-linking is immediate and transient. The activation of Src family enzymes in MIRR signal transduction is a well established phenomenon. Lck and Fyn are activated in response to T-cell receptor ligation(24Burkhardt A.L. Stealey B. Rowley R.B. Mahajan S. Prendergast M. Fargnoli J. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 23642-23647Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), the enzymatic activities of Lyn and Blk are increased following stimulation of B-cell lines through the B-cell receptor(17Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar), and Lyn has been shown to be activated in stimulated mast cell and basophilic cell lines(7Jouvin M.H. Adamczewski M. Numerof R. Letourneur O. Valle A. Kinet J.-P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 5918-5925Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 15Eiseman E. Bolen J.B. Nature. 1992; 355: 78-80Crossref PubMed Scopus (414) Google Scholar). Lyn is the most abundant Src family member in PT 18 cells and other mast cell and basophilic cell lines and appears to send the initiating signal following Fc∊RI engagement. The location of Lyn at the cytoplasmic subsurface of the plasma membrane and the observation that this protein-tyrosine kinase is constitutively bound to the Fc∊RI-β chain places this enzyme in the appropriate subcellular location to respond rapidly to receptor engagement.The peak levels of Syk and Fer activation were found to follow that of Lyn. The peak of Syk activity coincides with the time at which Fc∊RI-γ tyrosine phosphorylation is approaching maximal levels. This finding is consistent with a model where Lyn is somehow activated by receptor cross-linking and phosphorylates the β and γ subunits of the receptor. Tyrosine-phosphorylated γ ITAMs would provide a docking site for Syk via its tandem SH2 domains(21Kihara H. Siraganian R.P. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 22427-22432Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 22Shiue L. Green J. Green O.M. Karas J.L. Morgenstern J.P. Ram M.K. Taylor M.K. Zoller M.J. Zydowsky L.D. Bolen J.B. Brugge J.S. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1995; 15: 272-281Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Recent evidence indicates that binding of Syk to phosphorylated ITAMs induces a conformational change in the protein, leading to its enzymatic activation(30Rowley R.B. Burkhardt A.L. Chao H.-G. Matsueda G.R. Bolen J.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1995; 270: 11590-11594Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar).The overall timing of the tyrosine-phosphorylation response and the characteristics of Syk activation in mast cells are quite different from those observed in B-cells(17Saouaf S.J. Mahajan S. Rowley R.B. Kut S.A. Fargnoli J. Burkhardt A.L. Tsukada S. Witte O.N. Bolen J.B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9524-9528Crossref PubMed Scopus (229) Google Scholar). B-cells present a less complex pattern of tyrosine-phosphorylated proteins following engagement of the B-cell antigen receptor, and the tyrosine phosphorylation develops more slowly. Furthermore, this response is more sustained in nature. In WEHI 231 cells for instance, tyrosine phosphorylation of Ig α and activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk are both maintained for more than 1 h. The Fc∊RI-mediated response in PT 18 mast cells is characterized by a more compressed time frame, the total cell tyrosine phosphorylation response as well as the activation of protein-tyrosine kinases returns to unstimulated levels of activity by 30 min poststimulation. This time frame is consistent with the physiological role of the mast cell to provide an immediate hypersensitivity reaction and then turn off.The protein-tyrosine kinase Fer is also activated following engagement of the Fc∊RI. The catalytic activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Fer follows that of Syk. This is the first known example of Fer activation in response to external stimuli. Additional studies are being performed to clarify the role of Fer in hemopoitic cell signal transduction. Another protein-tyrosine kinase reported to play a role in mast cell signal transduction is Btk(31Yao L. Kawakami Y. Kawakami T. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9175-9179Crossref PubMed Scopus (308) Google Scholar). Although we found Btk to be an abundant enzyme in PT18 cells, we have been unable to detect activation or an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk following stimulation of PT18 cells (data not shown). The Btk present in PT 18 cells appears to have a high level of constitutive tyrosine phosphorylation. This high level of tyrosine phosphorylation in the absence of stimulation may mask changes in the activation state of Btk following receptor cross-linking or limit our ability to detect such changes.In summary, we have shown that tyrosine phosphorylation in PT 18 mast cells is rapid and transient. Three different classes of protein-tyrosine kinases are activated in a time-dependent manner following Fc∊RI engagement. The Src family member Lyn is activated early, followed by activation of Syk and Fer. These experiments suggest that Lyn is the initiator of the protein-tyrosine kinase cascade that results in mast cell degranulation. INTRODUCTIONMast cells are the primary effectors in immediate type hypersensitivity reactions. Upon exposure to allergen, mast cells are induced to rapidly secrete preformed mediators from cytoplasmic granules. Mast cells bind IgE avidly via specific, high affinity Fc receptors, termed Fc∊RI. Fc∊RI are heterotetrameric complexes comprising an IgE-binding α subunit, a β subunit, and two γ subunits(1Ravetch J.V. Kinet J.-P. Annu. Rev.

The cytoplasmic domains of the β and γ subunits each contain two tyrosine residues, which are located within a conserved consensus sequence termed the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motif (ITAM) 1The abbreviations used are: ITAMimmunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifMIRRmultichain immune recognition receptorAPTanti-phosphotyrosineDNPdinitrophenolDNP-HSADNP-conjugated human serum albumin. or antigen recognition activation motif(3Samelson L.E.

We have found that bovine brain NMT exists as a heterogeneous mixture of interconvertible high molecular mass multimers involving ≈60-kDa NMT subunit(s). Gel filtration chromatography of partially purified NMT at low to moderate ionic strength yields NMT activity eluting as 391 ± 52 and 126 ± 17 kDa peaks as well as activity which profiles the protein fractions and likely results from NMT nonspecifically associating with background proteins and/or column matrix. Chromatography in 1 M NaCl causes 100% of this activity to elute as a single peak of ≈391 kDa. Subsequent treatment of the ≈391 kDa activity peak with an NMT peptide reaction product (i.e. N-myristoyl-peptide) results in ≈75% of the activity re-eluting as a ≈126-kDa peak in 1 M NaCl. Rechromatography also yields small amounts of a ≈50-kDa NMT monomer which increases with prior storage at 4°C. Up to 5 NMT subunits were identified by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and specific immunoblotting with a human NMT peptide antibody and by cofactor-dependent chemical cross-linking with an 125I-peptide substrate of NMT. The prominent 60 kDa and minor 57-, 53-, 49-, and 47-kDa NMT immunoblotted subunits co-migrate with five of nine silver-stained proteins in an enzyme preparation purified >7,000-fold with ≈50% yield by selective elution from octyl-agarose with the myristoyl-CoA analog, S-(2-ketopentadecyl)-CoA. Storage at 4°C also leads to conversion of the larger NMT subunit(s) into 49 and 47 kDa forms with no loss of NMT activity. These results identify two interconvertible forms of NMT in bovine brain that result from NMT subunit multimerization and/or complex formation with other cellular proteins. The data also identify a fully active NMT monomer which arises from subunit proteolysis. This study thus reveals a previously unappreciated level of NMT complexity which may have important mechanistic and/or regulatory significance for N-myristoylation in mammalian cells.

INTRODUCTIONN-Myristoylation is the co-translational covalent attachment of myristic acid in amide linkage to the N-terminal glycine residue of a number of mammalian, viral, and fungal proteins(1Johnson D.R. Bhatnagar R.S. Knoll L.J. Gordon J.I. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1994; 63: 869-914Google Scholar, 2Rudnick D.A. McWherter C.A. Gokel G.W. Gordon J.I. Adv.

Glazer R.I. Developments in Cancer Chemotherapy. 1st Ed. Vol. II. CRC Press, Inc., Boca Raton, FL1989: 95-116Google Scholar). For many proteins synthesized on free polyribosomes, co-translational N-myristoylation is required for their proper subcellular compartmentalization and subsequent biological function. For example, N-terminal myristate, in conjunction with N-terminal basic residues, is instrumental in effecting interactions of the protein tyrosine kinase, p60src, with the plasma membrane (5Resh M.D. Cell. 1994; 76: 411-413Google Scholar) which in turn is essential for p60v-src-mediated cellular transformation(6Kamps M.P. Buss J.E. Sefton B.M. Cell. 1986; 45: 105-112Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation is also required for the plasma membrane association of the polyprotein precursor of the human immunodeficiency virus internal structural polyprotein, p55, from which site it directs the assembly of virus capsids and their budding from infected cells(7Bryant M. Ratner L. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 523-527Google Scholar, 8Spearman P. Wang J. Heyden N.V. Ratner L. J. Virol. 1994; 68: 3232-3242Google Scholar). N-Myristoylation of certain proteins of Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans, pathogenic fungi which affect immunocompromised patients, is essential for their vegetative growth(9Lodge J.K.

Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S.

For example, while native NMT partially purified from human erythroleukemia cells (27Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Google Scholar) or purified to near homogeneity from bovine spleen (28Raju R.V.S. Kalra J. Sharma R.K. J. Biol.

Ferry G. Ernould A. Maes P. Remond G. Vincent M. Eur. J. Biochem. 1993; 214: 853-867Google Scholar) and bovine brain(30Glover C.J. Felsted R.L.

Furthermore, at least two distinct forms of NMT have been isolated from L1210 cells (29Boutin J.A. Ferry G. Ernould A. Maes P. Remond G. Vincent M. Eur. J.

Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Google Scholar), these data suggest the existence of homo- and/or heteromultimeric NMT complexes. The functional significance and molecular basis for multiple high molecular mass NMTs and NMT subunits ranging in size from 48 to 67 kDa remains unexplained(27Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Google Scholar, 28Raju R.V.S. Kalra J. Sharma R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12080-12083Google Scholar, 33McIlhinney R.A.J. McGlone K. Willis A.C.

Chem. 1993; 268: 4889-4902Google Scholar).To begin to address these questions, we have examined the hydrodynamic properties and subunit structure of bovine brain NMT (bNMT). We have determined that the bNMT exists in vitro as two multisubunit complexes which can be interconverted by manipulation of ionic strength and/or by treatment with an N-myristoyl-peptide product of the NMT reaction. We have also identified a subunit heterogeneity for bNMT which arises in part from proteolysis of larger subunit precursor(s) and which apparently accounts for the accumulation of a fully active monomeric form of the enzyme. Our data thus provide in one system an explanation for the disparity of data concerning the native NMT structure(s) including physiologically relevant processes which may account for the enzyme quaternary structure and activity. We also provide information for circumventing problems encountered during the manipulation and purification of NMT from complex tissues such as bovine brain.EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURESPurification of bNMTAll manipulations were carried out at 4°C. Fresh or frozen (−80°C) bovine brain (200 g) was homogenized in 600 ml of homogenization buffer containing proteolytic enzyme inhibitors and bNMT was partially purified by 35-70% (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and batch elution from DEAE-Sepharose Fast Flow (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.) with 130 mM NaCl as described previously(36Glover C.J. Tellez M.R. Guziac Jr., F.S. Felsted R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1067-1074Google Scholar). The resulting NMT activity was concentrated by ultrafiltration with a YM10 membrane (Amicon, Beverly, MA) to 3-4 ml, adjusted to 18% sucrose, applied in two separate loadings to a Sephacryl S-200 HR (or Sephacryl S-300 HR) column (2.5 × 97 cm) (Pharmacia) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer with 1 mM EDTA, 20 μg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma), 2 μg/ml leupeptin (Boehringer Mannheim), 2 μg/ml aprotinin (Boehringer Mannheim), and 0.02% sodium azide) containing 1 M NaCl, and eluted at 8-10 ml/h into 5.8-ml fractions. Assays for enzyme activity revealed a single symmetrical NMT peak nearly coincident with the first eluting protein peak (monitored by absorption at 280 nm). The leading fractions of the activity peak were pooled so as to maximize recovery of enzyme activity and minimize retention of lower molecular weight contaminating proteins and concentrated by ultrafiltration to 1-2 ml. The ionic strength was then reduced by repeated dilution with gel filtration buffer followed by ultrafiltration (total of three times) to give a concentrated enzyme solution (<0.05 M NaCl). To this concentrated enzyme was added 10 mM of an N-myristoylated peptide corresponding to residues 2-10 of p60src- (N-myristoyl-GSSKSKPKD), and the mixture was incubated on ice for 10 min. The enzyme mixture was adjusted to a final concentration of 1 M NaCl and 18% sucrose, clarified by centrifugation, applied to a Sephacryl S-100 HR column (2.5 × 96 cm) equilibrated in gel filtration buffer containing 1 M NaCl, and eluted and analyzed as described above. The tailing fractions from the resulting major enzyme activity peak (peak II) were pooled so as to maximize the recovery of enzyme at the expense of higher molecular weight contaminating proteins and is referred to as the Sephacryl S-100 HR NMT fraction. Final purification was achieved by applying peak II to a column of octyl-agarose (≈1.5 unit/ml resin) (Sigma) equilibrated in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 mM EDTA, 1.6 μg/ml leupeptin, 1.6 μg/ml aprotinin, 0.02% sodium azide, and 1 M NaCl, followed by immediately washing (10-20 ml/min) with 8 column volumes of equilibration buffer to remove unadsorbed protein and by washing (≈5 ml/min) with 10 column volumes of equilibration buffer containing 1 μMS-(2-ketopentadecyl)-CoA (prepared as we have previously described(36Glover C.J. Tellez M.R. Guziac Jr., F.S. Felsted R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1067-1074Google Scholar)) to elute the NMT activity. The fractions containing NMT activity were concentrated to ≈50 μl by ultrafiltration and centrifugation in a Centricon 10 (Amicon). The concentrated enzyme was resuspended in 1 ml of equilibration buffer containing 1 mM myristoyl-CoA and reconcentrated to ≈50 μl as before and is referred to as the octyl-agarose NMT fraction. This octyl-agarose step was routinely performed using up to 5 units of NMT activity and ≈100 μg of protein.Analytical ProceduresSDS-PAGE (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) was performed on 10% polyacrylamide gels (Integrated Separation Systems, Inc., Hyde Park, MA), and proteins were visualized by Pro-Blue or silver staining (Integrated Separation Systems, Inc.). Protein concentrations were determined by the BCA (Pierce) or colloidal gold (Integrated Separation Systems, Inc.) procedures with bovine serum albumin standard curves. Synthetic peptides were purchased from Peptide Technologies (Washington, D. C.). Peptide radioiodination was performed as described previously(38Glover C.J. Goddard C. Felsted R.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 485-491Google Scholar). Gel filtration chromatography with Superose 12 HR 10/30 (Pharmacia) and HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 PG (Pharmacia) columns were performed by fast protein liquid chromatography (Pharmacia). Gel filtration calibration curves were constructed using Low and High Molecular Weight Gel Filtration Kit proteins (Pharmacia) by plotting the logarithm of molecular weights against Kav(39Determann H. Brewer J.E. Heftmann E. Chromatography: A Laboratory Handbook of Chromatographic and Electrophoretic Methods. Van Nostrand Reinhold Co., New York1975: 362-392Google Scholar).NMT AssayThe assay for NMT activity was similar to that previously described (38Glover C.J. Goddard C. Felsted R.L. Biochem. J. 1988; 250: 485-491Google Scholar) and included 100 μM GSSKSKPKDPSQRRR-125I-Y, 100 μM myristoyl-CoA, 0.25% bovine serum albumin, and 40 mM HEPES (pH 7.6) buffer in a final volume of 0.1 ml. The radioiodinated N-myristoyl-peptide product was isolated by C18 reverse phase high performance chromatography and quantified in a gamma counter. One unit of enzyme activity is defined as 1 nmol of peptide N-acylated/min at 37°C.Cofactor-dependent Chemical Cross-linkingCofactor-dependent chemical cross-linking was accomplished by incubating 40-50 μg of protein from the Sephacryl S-100 HR NMT fraction with ≈10 nM GSSKSKPKDPSQRRR-125I-Y (2 × 104 to 1 × 105 counts/min) in the presence of 4, 10, or 20 μMS-(2-ketopentadecyl)-CoA or in the presence of 10 μMS-(2-ketopentadecyl)-CoA plus 5, 10, or 50 μM GSSKSKPKDPSQRRRY in 16 μM HEPES (pH 7.4) buffer in a final volume of 0.020 ml. After 5 min at room temperature, cross-linking was initiated by the addition of 5 μl of 12.5 mM 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (Sigma) in 1 M MOPS (pH 6.0) buffer, and the mixture was incubated for 30 min at room temperature. Cross-linking was terminated by the addition of 0.050 ml of SDS-sample buffer (37Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) and boiling for 5 min. Densitometry analysis of autoradiograms was performed using the LKB Ultrascan XL Enhanced Laser Densitometer and the GelScan XL (v. 2.1) software (Pharmacia).ImmunoblottingRabbit antisera to a peptide corresponding to residues 27-38 (i.e. KTMEEASKRSYQ) encoded by the hNMT gene (26Duronio R.J. Reed S.I. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1992; 89: 4129-4133Google Scholar) was prepared by Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL) using the multiple antigen peptide resin technology(40Tam J.P. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1988; 85: 5409-5413Google Scholar). Peptide specificity of the antisera was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays(41Mumby S.M. Kahn R.A. Manning D.R. Gilman A.G. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1986; 83: 265-269Google Scholar). The serum immunoglobulin fraction was isolated using ImmunoPure Protein A/G (Pierce). Affinity purification of the hNMT peptide antibody was accomplished by applying the immunoglobulin fraction to an affinity column containing the peptide antigen immobilized through an N-terminal cysteine to SulfoLink Coupling Gel (Pierce) and eluting as recommended by the manufacturer. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, electroblotted to nitrocellulose membranes, and the membranes were blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin. After incubation with primary antibody, immunoreactive bands were visualized using goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies conjugated to alkaline phosphatase and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate/nitro blue tetrazolium was used as substrate (Promega Corp., Madison, WI).Deglycosylation of N-Linked or O-Linked OligosaccharidesFetuin (20 μg, Sigma) or the Sephacryl S-100 HR NMT fraction (11 μg of protein) were denatured and deglycosylated with N-glycosidase, neuraminidase, and O-glycosidase essentially as recommended by the Genzyme Corporation (Cambridge, MA) and included leupeptin (5 mg/ml) and aprotinin (10 mg/ml) with incubations up to 18 h at 37°C. The effect of deglycosylation on the electrophoretic migration of fetuin was visualized by staining with Pro-Blue while that on NMT was assessed by immunoblotting.Preparation of Recombinant hNMTcDNAs for hNMT were obtained by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a reverse-transcribed cDNA template derived from the human breast carcinoma cell line MDA486 (provided by Drs. James Battey and Mark Hellmich, Laboratory of Biological Chemistry, DTP, NCI, NIH), using synthetic primers and cloned into a pFLAG expression vector (IBI, New Haven, CT). The pFLAG vectors were transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 and hNMT was induced with 500 μM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside in Luria-Bertani broth containing 100 μg/ml ampicillin. Lysozyme (0.25 mg/ml) (Sigma)-treated bacterial pellets were extracted into buffer containing 0.05 mg/ml ovomucoid protease inhibitor (Sigma), and the 18,000 × g supernatant fraction was subjected to SDS-PAGE and either immunoblotted or stained with Pro-Blue.RESULTSMultiple Forms of bNMTWe have investigated the question of bNMT heterogeneity using size exclusion chromatography. bNMT which had been partially purified by (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange chromatography (36Glover C.J. Tellez M.R. Guziac Jr., F.S. Felsted R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1067-1074Google Scholar) was applied to a column of Sephacryl S-200 HR equilibrated in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer containing proteolytic enzyme inhibitors. Under these conditions the majority of NMT activity eluted as two comparable peaks, the first close to the column void volume (peak I) followed by a closely eluting second peak (peak II). Meanwhile, the remaining activity eluted in tailing fractions, generally coinciding with the protein elution profile (Fig. 1A). When compared to molecular mass standards, peaks I and II exhibited apparent molecular masses of 391 ± 52 and 126 ± 17 kDa, respectively (Table 1). In addition, the general spreading of enzyme activity was suggestive of nonspecific interactions between NMT and other cellular proteins and/or column matrix. Considering that this gel filtration analysis, as well as previously described chromatofocusing (30Glover C.J. Felsted R.L. FASEB J. 1990; 4 (abstr.): 2058Google Scholar) and ion-exchange (32King M.J. Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 113: 77-81Google Scholar, 34King M.J. Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 141: 79-86Google Scholar) studies, were conducted under conditions of low to moderate ionic strength, we speculated that the trailing of activity might be due to nonspecific ionic interactions.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Reversible Equilibrium between Multimeric Forms of bNMTIn order to suppress nonspecific ionic interactions, the DEAE-Sepharose purified bNMT was again subjected to gel filtration analysis as described above except that the Sephacryl S-200 HR column was equilibrated in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 M NaCl. In addition to preventing the general spreading of enzyme activity over the latter fractions, 1 M NaCl caused all of the NMT activity to elute as a single symmetrical peak near to the column void volume corresponding to the elution volume of the first of the two major activity peaks (peak I) eluted in the absence of NaCl (Fig. 1B). Similar results were obtained using Sephacryl S-300 HR columns. Our finding of oligomeric forms of bNMT is consistent with the reported presence of high molecular weight forms of the enzyme in bovine brain(32King M.J. Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1992; 113: 77-81Google Scholar, 33McIlhinney R.A.J. McGlone K. Willis A.C. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 405-410Google Scholar, 34King M.J. Sharma R.K. Mol. Cell. Biochem. 1994; 141: 79-86Google Scholar). It is, however, in marked contrast with reports of NMTs having native molecular masses of 48-58 kDa in yeast, human erythroleukemia cells, and bovine spleen(17Towler D.A. Adams S.P. Eubanks S.R. Towery D.S. Jackson-Machelski E. Glaser L. Gordon J.I. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 2708-2712Google Scholar, 27Rocque W.J. McWherter C.A. Wood D.C. Gordon J.I. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 9964-9971Google Scholar, 28Raju R.V.S. Kalra J. Sharma R.K. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 12080-12083Google Scholar). We therefore considered the possibility that in addition to blocking nonspecific ionic interactions, the high ionic strength used in our experiments might induce the formation of a single high molecular weight form of the enzyme by promoting hydrophobic interactions between NMT subunits and/or between NMT and other proteins. If true, we speculated that NMT multimerization might be prevented and/or reversed by treatment with amphipathic agents.To test this hypothesis, the NMT activity (peak I) from the Sephacryl S-200 HR column shown in Fig. 1B was pooled, concentrated, re-equilibrated in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer without NaCl, and treated with 10 mM of a synthetic N-myristoylated peptide corresponding to amino acids 2-10 of p60src (i.e. N-myristoyl-GSSKSKPKD). In addition to being amphipathic, the N-myristoyl-peptide is an enzymatic product of the NMT reaction. Upon subsequent rechromatography on a Sephacryl S-100 HR column equilibrated in 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.4) buffer containing 1 M NaCl, only ≈25% of the applied activity eluted close to the original peak I while the majority of the applied activity (≈75%) eluted with an apparent molecular mass identical with peak II and 1-2% of the activity eluted as a third peak of ≈50 kDa (peak III) (Fig. 1C). Comparable results were obtained when the experiment was carried out using Sephacryl S-200 HR, Superdex 200, or Superose 12 columns (Table 1). When the activity in peak I (Fig. 1C) was again treated with 10 mMN-myristoyl-GSSKSKPKD and rechromatographed on the same Sephacryl S-100 HR column as described above, the applied activity eluted with a distribution similar to that shown in Fig. 1C except that the amount of activity in the ≈50 kDa peak increased with lengthened time of storage at 4°C prior to rechromatography (data not shown). Furthermore, when the enzyme in peak II was rechromatographed on a Superdex 200 column equilibrated in 100 mM Tris-CAPS (pH 9.4) buffer containing 1 M NaCl, the NMT activity once again eluted as the original ≈391-, ≈126-, and ≈50-kDa peaks (data not shown). Together these experiments provide evidence for two major forms of native bNMT of ≈391 and ≈126 kDa as well as a minor ≈50 kDa form which accumulates during storage. The experiments also reveal an equilibrium between the ≈391 and ≈126 kDa forms which is readily manipulated by changes in ionic strength and/or by the presence of an N-myristoyl-peptide. Finally, our ability to manipulate this multimerization phenomenon proved useful in the eventual purification of the enzyme.Purification of bNMTThe ability to block nonspecific ionic interactions while controlling the elution volume of NMT from gel filtration columns provided a major advance in our purification of bNMT. Following (NH4)2SO4 fractionation and batch elution from a DEAE-Sepharose ion-exchange column, significant purification was accomplished by two consecutive size exclusion columns, initially under conditions favoring the accumulation of peak I and the second under conditions promoting the formation of peak II as described above. This tandem size fractionation removed the majority of low molecular weight contaminants by the first Sephacryl S-200 HR column (see Fig. 1B) followed by the removal of most of the high molecular weight impurities by the subsequent Sephacryl S-100 HR column (see Fig. 1C). The enzyme was thus readily purified ≈500-fold over 4 days and exhibited excellent stability when concentrated in the same elution buffer: half-life of >100 days at 4°C and ≈9 mg protein/ml. Final purification was obtained by applying peak II to an octyl-agarose column and eluting the NMT activity with 1 μM of the myristoyl-CoA analog, S-(2-ketopentadecyl)-CoA(36Glover C.J. Tellez M.R. Guziac Jr., F.S. Felsted R.L. Biochem. Pharmacol. 1991; 41: 1067-1074Google Scholar, 42Paige L.A. Zheng G.Q. DeFrees S.A. Cassady J.M. Geahlen R.L. J. Med. Chem. 1989; 32: 1665-1667Google Scholar). The enzyme was thereby purified >7,000-fold with >50"

Glutamine hydrolysis produces the necessary amino group while ATP hydrolysis drives the reaction. Ammonia can also serve as an amino group donor. GMP synthetase contains two functional domains, which are well coordinated. The “glutamine amide transfer” or glutaminase domain is responsible for glutamine hydrolysis. The synthetase domain is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and GMP formation. Inorganic pyrophosphate inhibits the synthetase and uncouples the two domain functions by allowing glutamine hydrolysis to take place in the absence of ATP hydrolysis or GMP formation. Acivicin, a glutamine analog, selectively abolishes the glutaminase activity. It inhibits the synthetase activity only when glutamine is the amino donor. When ammonia is used in place of glutamine, acivicin has no effect on the synthetase activity. Acivicin inhibits GMP synthetase irreversibly by covalent modification. Enzyme inactivation is greatly facilitated by the presence of substrates. Acivicin labels GMP synthetase at a single site, and a tryptic peptide containing the modified residue was isolated. Mass spectrometry and Edman sequence analysis show that Cys104 is the site of modification. This residue is conserved among GMP synthetases and is located within a predicted glutamine amide transfer domain.

INTRODUCTIONThe macromolecular composition of the matrix of cartilage results from the expression of a unique repertoire of genes by chondrocytes. The matrix macromolecules synthesized by the chondrocytes have multiple domains that permit interactions with other matrix molecules or with cell surface components. These complex interactions determine the structure and the integrity of cartilage. The major components of the cartilage extracellular matrix are collagens, proteoglycans, and noncollagenous proteins. Cartilage matrix protein (CMP) 1The abbreviations used are: CMPcartilage matrix proteinDMEMDulbecco's modified eagle mediumPCRpolymerase chain reactionEGFepidermal growth factor. is one of the most abundant noncollagenous extracellular proteins in cartilage (1Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 539-545Google Scholar, 2Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1981; 197: 367-375Google Scholar) and has been shown to associate with the cartilage collagen fibril that consists of collagen types II, IX, and XI (3Winterbottom N. Tondravi M.M. Harrington T.L. Klier F.G. Vertel B.M. Goetinck P.F. Dev. Dyn. 1992; 193: 266-267Google Scholar) as well as with proteoglycans(1Paulsson M. Heinegård D. Biochem. J. 1979; 183: 539-545Google Scholar).The deduced amino acid sequence of CMP reveals that a CMP monomer is made up of a unique combination of structural domains(4Argraves W.S. Deák F. Sparks K.J. Kiss I. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 464-468Google Scholar, 5Kiss I. Deák F. Holloway Jr., R.G. Delius H. Mebust K.A. Frimberger E. Argraves W.S. Tsonis P.A.

Chem. 1990; 265: 19624-19631Google Scholar). Two highly homologous domains, CMP-A1 and CMP-A2, are separated from each other by a domain with homology to epidermal growth factor (EGF). The last domain is the carboxyl-terminal tail, which contains a series of heptad repeats(7Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Google Scholar). Each domain has significant sequence or structural homology to portions of other proteins. Homology to the CMP-A domains is found in soluble proteins including von Willebrand factor, the complement components C2 and B, matrix proteins such as collagen types VI, VII, XII, and XIV, undulin, transmembrane proteins such as the α-chains of the integrins VLA-1, VLA-2, LFA-1, Mac-1, p150,95, and a Caenorhabditis elegans protein involved in muscle attachment as well as the dihydropyridine-sensitive calcium channel and the inter-α-trypsin inhibitor (reviewed in (8Colombatti A.

EGF-like domains are found in many classes of molecules, and some of them have been shown to bind calcium ions(18Engel J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 779-785Google Scholar). The function of the EGF-like domain in CMP is not established. The carboxyl-terminal heptad repeat domain of CMP (7Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Google Scholar) has structural similarity to the coiled-coil domains of fibrinogen and members of the laminin, tenascin, and thrombospondin families(18Engel J. Curr. Opin.

The function of the heptad repeat domains in these molecules has been shown to be the formation of hydrophobic interactions between three adjacent and similar coils, in effect forming homo- or heterotrimers (22Conway J.F. Parry D.A.D. Int. J. Biol. Macromol. 1991; 13: 14-16Google Scholar).CMP monomer contains 12 cysteine residues. Each of the two CMP-A domains has two cysteines, one at the amino-terminal end and one at the carboxyl-terminal end of each domain. The EGF-like domain has six cysteine residues. The final two cysteines are at the beginning of the carboxyl-terminal heptad repeats(4Argraves W.S. Deák F. Sparks K.J. Kiss I. Goetinck P.F. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 464-468Google Scholar, 5Kiss I. Deák F. Holloway Jr., R.G. Delius H. Mebust K.A. Frimberger E. Argraves W.S. Tsonis P.A. Winterbottom N. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol.

In this communication we test the hypotheses that CMP-A domains become stabilized by intradomain disulfide bonds, that the cysteine residues in the carboxyl-terminal tail are involved in homotrimer formation(5Kiss I. Deák F. Holloway Jr., R.G. Delius H. Mebust K.A. Frimberger E. Argraves W.S. Tsonis P.A. Winterbottom N. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8126-8134Google Scholar, 23Goetinck P.F. Kiss I.

Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Google Scholar). These hypotheses were tested by the creation of a variety of CMP mutants and the expression of these mutant CMP molecules in COS-7 cells that do not normally express CMP.MATERIALS AND METHODSConstruction of CMP MutantsThe locations of the 12 cysteine residues, numbered C1 (at the amino terminus) through C12 (at the carboxyl terminus), in a CMP monomer are shown in Fig. 1. The wild-type chicken cDNA sequence was cloned into pCDNAI vector (Invitrogen), and this was used as a template for creating all other constructs. Two major categories of mutants involving deletions of portions of CMP were generated: a mini-CMP and a heptad-less CMP (Fig. 1). The mini-CMP consists of the CMP-A2 domain and the heptad repeat-containing tail. The heptad-less mutant is a form of the full-length CMP that was truncated at the carboxyl side of C12. A number of mutations affecting C9, C10, C11, and C12 were generated within the full-length, mini-, and heptad-less CMPs. The construct with C11 and C12 mutated to serine residues was made using the Muta-Gene M13 in vitro mutagenesis kit (Bio-Rad) according to the instructions provided by the manufacturer. For the generation of all other mutations, either single step PCR or two step recombinant PCR with overlapping primers (24Higuchi R. Innis M.A. Gelfand D.H. Sninsky J.J. White T.J. PCR Protocols: A Guide to Methods and Applications. Academic Press Inc., San Diego, CA1990: 177-183Google Scholar) was used. Fig. 2A represents diagrammatically the CMP cDNA and identifies the location of the primers used and the single letter amino acid substitution for the mutagenized cysteine residues. Fig. 2B provides the 5′ to 3′ nucleotide sequence of all the primers used. Fig. 2C names the various constructs and shows the primer pairs used to generate them. In the two step recombinant PCR, primers A and D are sequences in the poly-linker region of the pCDNAI vector. Primers B and C are overlapping primers from the coding region of CMP that also code for mutations. Step 1 PCR reactions used full-length CMP in pCDNAI (with or without C10, C11, or C12) as a template. Primer pair A and B was used for the “left” PCR. Primer pair C and D was used for the “right” PCR. Step 2 PCR used 1 μl each of the left and right reactions as a template and primer pair A and D. A denaturation followed by a 5-min extension at 72°C was used to anneal the left and right products to each other so that they can subsequently serve as templates for primer pair A and D.Figure 2:Construct production and cysteine mutations. The relative locations of the primers used to produce the various CMP constructs are shown underneath the schematic model of CMP in A. Cysteines were mutated to the amino acids indicated by single letters. The introduced stop codons are shown as stars. B shows the sequence of all primers used in 5′ to 3′ orientation. The primers are numbered as in A. Lower case letters indicate mismatches with the template sequence. The mutated codons are listed in bold, and underlining indicates the stop codons introduced for the heptad-less constructs. Nonadjacent areas of overlap with template, used to connect the signal sequence to the CMP-A2 domain in the recombinant PCR, are separated by a tilde (~). The primer pairs, templates, and introduced mutations for the single or recombinant PCRs are listed in C. The delta symbol (Δ) indicates deletion of the corresponding domains.

Briefly, COS-7 cells were trypsinized and counted. Each well of six-well plates was seeded with 1.5 × 105 cells, which were allowed to attach overnight in DMEM supplemented with 5% defined/supplemented calf serum (Hyclone). The following day the cells were rinsed with DMEM and subjected to a DNA/Lipofectin (Life Technologies, Inc.) mixture in DMEM for 5-24 h. The DNA/Lipofectin mixture was aspirated and replaced with 2 ml of either Opti-MEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) or DMEM (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (Hyclone). This medium was harvested after 48-72 h and frozen until ready for analysis.SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis and ImmunoblottingSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was performed according to Laemmli (25Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Google Scholar) on 8 or 11% resolving gels and 4% stacking gels. Reduced samples had 1% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol (Sigma) present in the sample buffer. Proteins were blotted to Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore) following the protocol of the manufacturer. The membranes were blocked in PBS/Tween (0.05% v/v Tween 20 (Sigma)) with 3% (w/v) nonfat dry milk powder (Carnation) and probed with rabbit polyclonal antibody D2/1476, which was raised against a synthetic peptide corresponding to the amino acids Phe380 to Val424 in the CMP-A2 domain cross-linked to keyhole limpet hemocyanin by means of N-succinimidyl 3-(pyridylithio)propionate through a cysteine residue introduced at the amino group of Phe380 during the synthesis of the peptide, as described earlier(26Goetinck P.F. Stirpe N.S. Tsonis P.A. Carlone D. J. Cell Biol. 1987; 105: 2403-2408Google Scholar). The antibodies were subsequently affinity purified on a column consisting of purified chicken CMP linked to Sepharose CL-4B (Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Detection of antibody bound to proteins on the Immobilon-P membrane was done with peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (Bio-Rad) using ECL substrate (Amersham Corp.) and exposure to x-ray film from Kodak or Fuji.RESULTSConstruction of Mini-CMPThe model of CMP structure postulates that the carboxyl-terminal cysteines are involved in trimerization. To decrease the number of cysteine residues and thereby simplify the analysis of the mutagenesis, a mini-CMP was created that consists of the CMP-A2 domain and the heptad repeat-containing tail domain. This mini-CMP has only four cysteine residues, C9 and C10 in the CMP-A2 domain and C11 and C12 in the tail domain. The numbering of the cysteine residues of full-length CMP is also used in the numbering of the cysteine residues in the mini-CMP. The constructs were transiently expressed in COS-7 cells that normally do not express any CMP. Wild-type, full-length CMP expressed in this COS-7 system is indistinguishable on a Western blot from CMP isolated from chicken sterna (data not shown).Mini-CMP Behaves like Full-length CMPAccording to our model of CMP folding, C9 and C10 would form an intradomain disulfide bond, and C11 and C12 would be involved in the trimerization of mini-CMP. A Western blot of mini-CMP under reducing conditions shows that the molecule migrates as a single band with an apparent molecular mass of about 28 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 1). This value is in agreement with the molecular mass predicted from chicken cDNA sequence analysis. A Western blot of mini-CMP under nonreducing conditions shows that the protein migrates as a single band of 85 kDa (Fig. 3A, lane 4). This electrophoretic pattern is consistent with the formation of a disulfide-bonded mini-CMP trimer. Full-length CMP has an apparent molecular mass of 54 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 3A, lane 2) and 144 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 3A, lane 5). The electrophoretic behavior of the mini-CMP is analogous to that of the expressed full-length CMP in that both molecules are secreted exclusively as disulfide-bonded trimers.Figure 3:Mini-CMP behaves as full-length CMP. Conditioned medium of COS cells transfected with mini-CMP (lanes 1 and 4), full-length CMP (lanes 2 and 5), or co-transfected with the cDNAs of both constructs (lanes 3 and 6) was separated on a 8% gel, blotted to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and incubated with antiserum D2/1476 against the CMP-A2 domain. Bound antibodies were detected with a peroxidase-coupled secondary antibody and a chemiluminescence detection kit. Lanes 1-3 were run under reducing conditions (+), and lanes 4-6 were run under nonreducing conditions(-). Molecular weights of the protein standards are shown on the left × 10-3. Schematic drawings of the obtained mixed multimers between mini- and full-length CMP are shown in B. The total number of CMP-A domains/multimer is indicated in parentheses and corresponds to the numbers shown on the right side of A.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT)Mini-CMP Can Trimerize with Full-length CMPTo test if mini-CMP can oligomerize with full-length CMP, mini-CMP and full-length CMP cDNAs were co-transfected into COS-7 cells. Western blot analysis of the medium of the co-transfected cells shows two bands (28 and 54 kDa) under reducing conditions (Fig. 3A, lane 3) that correspond to the monomers of mini-CMP and full-length CMP. Under nonreducing conditions there are four distinct bands (Fig. 3A, lane 6). The molecular weight of the band with the fastest electrophoretic mobility corresponds to a disulfide-bonded trimer consisting of three mini-CMP monomers. The molecular mass of the second band corresponds to that of a trimer consisting of two mini-CMP monomers and one full-length CMP monomer. The molecular mass of the third band corresponds to a trimer consisting of one mini-CMP monomer and two full-length CMP chains. The band with the slowest electrophoretic mobility is a trimer consisting of three full-length CMP monomers. Observations that only four bands are present under nonreducing conditions and that two of these bands correspond to mini-CMP trimer and full-length CMP trimer clearly prove the existence of CMP as trimers. The various forms observed on the gel are represented diagrammatically in Fig. 3B.Cysteine Residues C11 and C12 Are Necessary for Interchain Disulfide Bond Formation in Mini-CMPTo test the roles of C11 and C12 in mini-CMP, a mini-CMP was created in which these two cysteines were converted to serine residues. Mutating C11 and C12 in mini-CMP results in a protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 26 or 28 kDa under nonreducing or reducing conditions, respectively (Fig. 4, lanes 2 and 4). Therefore, no trimers or other oligomers formed from this mutant version of mini-CMP. This is in contrast with the mobility of the trimer form (85 kDa) of the mini-CMP under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 4, lane 1) and the monomer (28 kDa) under reducing conditions (Fig. 4, lane 3). The slight difference in the electrophoretic mobility of the mutated mini-CMP under nonreducing (Fig. 4, lane 2) compared with that under reducing conditions (Fig. 4, lane 4) reflects the presence of a single intrachain disulfide bond between C9 and C10. Thus, C11 and C12 are necessary for the formation of the interchain disulfide bonds of the mini-CMP. The results also indicate that an intradomain disulfide bond involving C9 and C10 in the CMP-A2 domain can form in the absence of C11 and C12. Therefore, the formation of this intrachain disulfide bond is independent of interchain disulfide bonds.Figure 4:C11 and C12 are necessary and sufficient for interchain disulfide bond formation in mini-CMP. Conditioned medium of cells expressing mini-CMP (lanes 1 and 3), mini-CMP with mutated cysteines C11 and C12 (lanes 2 and 4), and mini-CMP with mutated cysteines C9 and C10 (lanes 5 and 6) were run under nonreducing (-) and reducing (+) conditions on a 11% gel and analyzed by Western blotting as described in the legend of Fig. 3. Molecular weights of the protein standards are shown on the left × 10-3. Above each lane in the blot is a figure representing the mini-CMP construct used. The open box represents the CMP-A2 domain, and the solid line represents the COOH-terminal tail domain. The cysteines (C) and the mutated cysteines (X) are shown.

This mini-CMP, which has only two cysteines, C11 and C12, migrates with a molecular mass of 94 or 26 kDa under nonreducing or reducing conditions, respectively (Fig. 4, lanes 5 and 6). The slightly slower electrophoretic mobility of the mini-CMP (Fig. 4, lane 1) compared with that of the mini-CMP C9/C10 double mutant (Fig. 4, lane 5) results from the absence of the intrachain disulfide bond in the CMP-A2 domain of the mini-CMP C9/C10 double mutant. Therefore, C9 and C10 are responsible for the formation of intrachain disulfide bonds. The only two cysteines necessary for interchain disulfide bond formation are residues C11 and C12.Residues C11 and C12 Are Also Necessary for Interchain Disulfide Bond Formation in Full-length CMPTo test if C11 and C12 are responsible for the formation of interchain disulfide bonds in full-length CMP as they are in mini-CMP, both C11 and C12 were mutated in full-length CMP. Mutating both C11 and C12 of full-length CMP results in a protein that migrates with an apparent molecular mass of 45 kDa under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 5, lane 3) and as a 54-kDa band under reducing conditions (Fig. 5, lane 4). In contrast, wild-type full-length CMP expressed by COS-7 cells migrates as a single oligomeric species under nonreducing conditions and as a monomer of 54 kDa under reducing conditions (Fig. 5, lanes 1 and 2). These results indicate that similar to the mini-CMP, the full-length CMP cannot form disulfide-bonded oligomers without the cysteines in the heptad repeat domain. The difference in the electrophoretic mobility of the reduced versus nonreduced C11/C12 double mutant reflects the presence of intradomain disulfide bonds formed by cysteines C1-C10.Figure 5:Cysteines C11 and C12 are also necessary for interchain disulfide bond formation in full-length CMP. Conditioned medium of cells expressing full-length CMP (lanes 1 and 2) and full-length CMP with mutated cysteines C11 and C12 (lanes 3 and 4) were run under nonreducing (lanes 1 and 3) and reducing (lanes 2 and 4) conditions on a 11% gel and analyzed by Western blotting as described in the legend of Fig. 3.

Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Google Scholar). To test whether the heptad repeats have an effect on the formation of trimers in CMP, constructs were made that consist of wild-type CMP with a stop codon introduced between the C12 residue and the heptad repeats. A similar construct was made that had C11 and C12 mutated. Neither of these constructs formed disulfide-bonded trimers (Fig. 6, lanes 1 and 2). The proteins encoded by these constructs migrated as two close bands that cannot be explained in terms of multimers of the CMP construct. We interpret these two bands to reflect different intramonomeric disulfide bonds. Upon reduction both samples migrate as a single band with identical electrophoretic mobilities (Fig. 6, lanes 3 and 4). These results indicate that the heptad repeats are critical for the initiation of CMP trimer formation. Such trimers cannot form when the heptad repeats are not present, even when residues C11 and C12 are intact. Thus, residues C11 and C12 stabilize the trimer by forming interchain disulfide bonds.Figure 6:The heptad repeats are needed for the initiation of disulfide-bonded trimerization. Conditioned medium of cells expressing heptad-less CMP (lanes 1 and 3) and heptad-less CMP with mutated cysteines C11 and C12 (lanes 2 and 4) were run under nonreducing (lanes 1 and 2) and reducing (lanes 3 and 4) conditions on a 11% gel and analyzed by Western blotting as described in the legend of Fig. 3.

The formation of triple helices of collagens and the assembly of these trimers in supramolecular structures are examples of such assemblies, as are the formation of laminins, thrombospondin, and tenascin(18Engel J. Curr. Opin. Cell Biol. 1991; 3: 779-785Google Scholar, 19Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Google Scholar, 20Sottile J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F.

Macromol. 1991; 13: 14-16Google Scholar).The organization of CMP into a functional trimer requires that a number of co- or post-translational modifications occur both within and between monomers. We have postulated that intramonomeric changes include the formation of disulfide bridges within the A domains and the EGF-like domain(5Kiss I. Deák F. Holloway Jr., R.G. Delius H. Mebust K.A. Frimberger E. Argraves W.S. Tsonis P.A. Winterbottom N. Goetinck P.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8126-8134Google Scholar, 23Goetinck P.F. Kiss I. Deák F. Stirpe N.S. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1990; 599: 29-38Google Scholar). The intermonomeric changes include the initiation of the trimer formation through the establishment of coiled-coil α-helices followed by the stabilization of the trimer through disulfide bonds involving the two cysteines in the heptad repeat-containing tail. Although reducing agents are necessary to obtain CMP monomers in denaturing gels, the interchain disulfide bonds are not necessary for the maintenance of the trimeric structure under otherwise nondenaturing conditions(7Hauser N. Paulsson M. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25747-25753Google Scholar).To test this model, we engineered a mini-CMP in which the CMP-A1 and the EGF domains were deleted, thus reducing the number of cysteine residues in the mini-CMP from 12 to 4. Two of the cysteines are in the CMP-A2 domain and two are in the heptad repeat-containing tail domain. When the length of the tail domain of the mini-CMP was intact, we showed clearly that C11 and C12 are both necessary and sufficient for interchain disulfide bond formation that results in a stable trimer. If, however, the heptad repeats of the tail domain are deleted, trimers will not form even if C11 and C12 are present. Therefore, the heptad repeats act as nucleation sites in the formation of the CMP trimer, and the trimers are subsequently stabilized through disulfide bonds involving C11 and C12. The establishment of trimers through the interaction of heptad repeats have been proposed for the formation of heterotrimers of laminin and homotrimers of tenascin, fibrinogen, and thrombospondin. As in CMP, closely spaced cysteine residues are at the amino and/or carboxyl end of the heptad repeats of these proteins (19Spring J. Beck K. Chiquet-Ehrismann R. Cell. 1989; 59: 325-334Google Scholar, 20Sottile J. Selegue J. Mosher D.F. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 6556-6562Google Scholar, 21Beck K. Dixon T.W. Engel J. Parry D.A.D. J. Mol.

We also present evidence that intradomain disulfide bonds form between residues C9 and C10 within CMP-A2, suggesting that a similar bridge may exist between C1 and C2 in the CMP-A1 domain.

This protein binds to the minor groove specifically recognizing an unusual DNA context exhibited by a specific MAR region with strong base-unpairing propensity. A phage library displaying nonamer random peptides without any built-in structure was used to identify a MAR binding motif of SATB1. One predominant cyclic peptide C1 of CRQNWGLEGC selected by a MAR-affinity column showed 50% identity with a segment in SATB1 (amino acids 355-363). Replacement of the C1 similarity segment in SATB1 by a random amino acid sequence or its truncation resulted in more than 80% reduction in MAR binding. In contrast, replacement of the same SATB1 segment with the C1 peptide restored full MAR binding activity and specificity as the wild-type protein. Single amino acid mutation of the conserved Arg or Glu residue to Ala greatly reduced MAR binding. Taken together our data show that a nine amino acid sequence in SATB1 represents a key MAR binding motif.

https://openalex.org/W2065989530,"Previous work suggested that desensitization of p21ras in response to growth factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) results from receptor down-regulation. Here we show that p21ras is desensitized by insulin in 3T3-L1 adipocytes in the continued presence of activated insulin receptors, while loss of epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors in response to their ligands correlates with p21rasdesensitization. Furthermore, elevated amounts of Grb2/Shc complexes persisted throughout p21ras desensitization by insulin. However, immunoblotting of anti-Son-of-sevenless (Sos) 1 and 2 immunoprecipitates with anti-Grb2 antisera revealed that p21rasdesensitization in response to insulin and PDGF, but not EGF, is associated with a marked decrease in cellular complexes containing Sos and Grb2 proteins. Nonetheless, the desensitization of p21rasin response to these stimuli was homologous, in that each peptide could reactivate [32P]GTP loading of p21ras after desensitization by any of the others. Taken together, these data indicate that insulin, EGF, and PDGF all cause disassembly of Sos proteins from signaling complexes during p21rasdesensitization, but at least two mechanisms are involved. Insulin elicits dissociation of Sos from Grb2 SH3 domains, whereas EGF signaling is reversed by receptor down-regulation and Shc dephosphorylation, releasing Grb2 SH2 domains. PDGF action triggers both mechanisms of Grb2 disassembly, which probably operate in concert with GAP to attenuate p21ras signaling.

https://openalex.org/W1995791399,"Parathyroid hormone (PTH) and parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHRP) regulate Na+/H+ exchanger activity in osteoblastic cells, although the signaling components involved are not precisely defined. Since these peptide hormones can stimulate production of diverse second messengers (i.e. cAMP and diacylglycerol) that activate protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) in target cells, it is conceivable that either one or both of these pathways can participate in modulating exchanger activity. To discriminate among these possibilities, a series of synthetic PTH and PTHRP fragments were used that stimulate adenylate cyclase and/or PKC. In the osteoblastic cell line UMR-106, human PTH(1-34) and PTHRP(1-34) augmented adenylate cyclase activity, whereas PTH(3-34), PTH(28-42), and PTH(28-48) had no effect. Nevertheless, all these peptide fragments were found to enhance PKC translocation from the cytosol to the membrane in a dose-dependent (10−11 to 10−7M) manner.

PTH(1-34) and PTHRP(1-34), but not PTH(3-34), PTH(28-42), PTH(28-48), or PTHRP(1-16), elevated Na+/H+ exchanger activity, implicating cAMP as the transducing signal. In accordance with this observation, forskolin (10 μM), which directly stimulates adenylate cyclase, also activated Na+/H+ exchanger activity.

In addition, Northern blot analysis revealed the presence of only the NHE-1 isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger in UMR-106 cells.

Thus, the ability of this receptor to couple to multiple effector systems is believed to account for the pleiotropic actions of these peptides in bone as well as other tissues. Nonetheless, the precise linkage of the PTH/PTHRP-receptor to these distinct signaling pathways and various downstream molecular targets remains poorly defined. parathyroid hormone parathyroid hormone-related peptide protein kinase A; PKC dithiothreitol α minimum essential medium. A recently identified target of PTH/PTHRP action in osteoblasts is the plasma membrane Na+/H+ exchanger, which plays a central role in modulating intracellular pH (pHi)(6Reid I.R. Civitelli R. Avioli L.V. Hruska K.A. Am. J. Physiol. 1988; 255: E9-E15Google Scholar, 7Sugimoto T. Kano J. Fukase M. Fujita T. J. Cell. Physiol. 1992; 152: 28-34Google Scholar, 8Graham C.S. Tashjian Jr., A.H. Biochem. J. 1992; 288: 137-143Google Scholar). In osteoblastic cells, regulation of pHi is a critical component of hormone-stimulated bone remodeling where local fluctuations occur in the osseous microenvironment(9Redhead C.R. Baker P.F. Calcif. Tissue Int. 1988; 42: 237-242Google Scholar). Numerous studies have shown that Na+/H+ exchanger activity is acutely regulated by a wide variety of stimuli that activate diverse signal transduction systems (i.e. PKA, PKC, Ca2+/calmodulin- dependent protein kinase II, tyrosine kinases), although in many cases the precise mechanisms have yet to be fully elucidated (reviewed in (10Grinstein S. Rotin D. Mason M.J. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1989; 988: 73-97Google Scholar)). This extensive functional and regulatory diversity appears to be generated by tissue-specific expression of multiple isoforms of the Na/H exchanger as well as by variations in the signaling repertoire of individual cell types (reviewed in (11Tse C.-M. Levine S. Yun C. Brant S. Counillon L.T. Pouysségur J. Donowitz M. J. Membr. Biol. 1993; 135: 93-108Google Scholar)). To date, four members (NHE-1 to NHE-4) of this gene family have been identified and characterized by cDNA cloning (11Tse C.-M. Levine S. Yun C. Brant S. Counillon L.T. Pouysségur J. Donowitz M. J.

Overall, they share ∼40-60% amino acid identity and contain one or more potential sites for phosphorylation by different serine/threonine protein kinases in their putative cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal region. More recently, a putative fifth (19Klanke C. Su Y.R. Callen D.F. Wang Z. Meneton P. Baird N. Kandasamy R.A. Orlowski J. Otterud B.E. Leppert M. Shull G.E. Menon A.

Genome. 1994; 5: 153-159Google Scholar) isoform have been located by chromosomal mapping in humans. In osteoblastic cell lines, there are conflicting reports regarding the regulation of the Na+/H+ exchanger and pHi by PTH/PTHRP and second messengers. Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels by PTH, PTHRP, forskolin, or cAMP analogues has been reported to inhibit (6Reid I.R. Civitelli R. Avioli L.V. Hruska K.A. Am. J.

Aside from methodological considerations, the reason for this difference is unclear. In addition, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA treatment) also leads to stimulation of Na+/H+ exchanger activity, presumably through activation of PKC(22Gupta A. Schwiening C.J. Boron W.F. Am. J. Physiol. 1994; 266: C1083-C1092Google Scholar). Thus, at least two distinct signaling pathways appear to regulate this ion transporter in bone cells. In contrast to UMR-106 cells, PTH as well as epinephrine, a β-adrenergic agonist that also activates a G protein-linked receptor coupled to adenylate cyclase, were found to activate the Na+/H+ exchanger independent of changes in cAMP accumulation in rat osteosarcoma ROS 17/2.8 cells(23Ganz M.B. Pachter J.A. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 8989-8992Google Scholar). Further studies revealed that β-adrenergic receptor-mediated activation of the Na+/H+ exchanger involved a G protein (Gα13) that was not linked to either adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C(24Voyno-Yasenetskaya T. Conklin B.R. Gilbert R.L. Hooley R. Bourne H.R. Barber D.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 4721-4724Google Scholar, 25Dhanasekaran N. Vara Prasad M.V.V.S. Wadsworth S.J. Dermott J.M. Van Rossum G. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 11802-11806Google Scholar), thereby implicating the involvement of a novel third pathway. Whether this also applies to the PTH receptor is unknown. Nonetheless, it is conceivable that the PTH/PTHRP signal to modulate Na+/H+ exchanger activity in osteoblasts is transduced by more than two signaling pathways. In addition, the regulatory diversity mentioned above may also be reflected by cellular expression of one or more isoforms of the Na+/H+ exchanger that are differentially responsive to distinct signaling pathways. The identity of specific Na+/H+ exchanger isoforms in osteoblastic cells has yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was two-fold. First, using UMR-106 cells as a model system, we wished to examine in greater detail the reported linkage of PTH/PTHRP to the PKA and PKC signaling pathways, and possibly to another pathway involving Gα13, in regulating Na+/H+ exchanger activity. This was accomplished as follows: (i) by using a series of synthetic peptide fragments of PTH and PTHRP that selectively activate adenylate cyclase and/or phospholipase C, and (ii) by using other downstream activators (i.e. forskolin and PMA) and inhibitors of the PKA and PKC pathways. Second, we wished to identify which isoform(s) of the Na+/H+ exchanger is(are) present in these cells. Our results demonstrated that only the NHE-1 isoform is expressed in UMR-106 cells and that PTH and PTHRP selectively activate NHE-1 via a pathway involving PKA. Phosphatidyl L-serine, diolein, dithiothreitol (DTT), phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), EDTA, EGTA, and leupeptin were obtained from Sigma. α Minimum essential medium (αMEM), fetal bovine serum, trypsin-EDTA, and Geneticin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. Dowex AG50 WX4 (200-400 mesh) and neutral chromatographic Alumina WN-3 were from Bio-Rad. DEAE-Sephacel was purchased from Pharmacia Biotech Inc. Carrier-free 22NaCl (5 mCi/ml), and [γ-32P]ATP (0.5 mCi/ml) were obtained from DuPont NEN. The different human PTH and PTHRP synthetic fragments were kind gifts of Dr. K. Muller (CIBA-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland). Forskolin, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin, PMA, 4α-PMA, H-89, and chelerythrine chloride were purchased from Biomol Research Laboratories, Inc. (Plymouth Meeting, PA). All other chemicals were from Fisher Scientific and BDH. Rat osteoblastic osteosarcoma cells (UMR-106) were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The Chinese hamster ovary cell line devoid of endogenous NHE activity (AP-1) was transfected with cDNAs containing the entire coding region of rat NHE-1, NHE-2, or NHE-3 as described previously(13Wang Z. Orlowski J. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 11925-11928Google Scholar, 15Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Google Scholar). Rat NHE-4 was heterologously expressed in a Chinese hamster lung cell line (PS120) that also lacked endogenous NHE activity and was called PSCN4-4 (generously provided by Dr. Eugene Chang; University of Chicago)(18Bookstein C. Musch M.W. DePaoli A. Xie Y. Villereal M. Rao M.C. Chang E.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 29704-29709Google Scholar). The transfected cells were grown in αMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 μg/ml fungizone). Cells were incubated in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air, 5% CO2 at 37°C. Adenylate cyclase activity was determined using a method based on incorporation of [3H]adenine into ATP and its conversion to [3H]cAMP(3Bernier S.M. Rouleau M.F. Goltzman D. Endocrinology. 1991; 128: 2752-2760Google Scholar). Prior to each assay, confluent cells were incubated overnight in serum-free medium. The assay was initiated by adding [3H]adenine (4 × 105 cpm) to each tissue culture well and incubating for 2 h. Following this incubation period, the medium was aspirated and the cells were washed twice with 1 ml of αMEM without serum. Then, 0.5 ml of previously prepared solutions containing PTH or PTHRP synthetic fragments, forskolin, or PMA in αMEM supplemented with 1 mM isobutylmethylxanthine (to prevent breakdown of cAMP by phosphodiesterases) were added to each well and cells were incubated for a period of 15 min. The medium of each well was then aspirated in the same order of application and 0.5 ml of ice-cold 10% trichloroacetic acid was added to each well to stop the reaction and extract the [3H]cAMP. The [3H]cAMP was isolated by chromatography on Dowex and Alumina columns and quantitated in a β-counter. Adenylate cyclase activity was expressed as [3H]cAMP produced/15 min/well. PKC activity was assayed according to previously described procedures(26Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B. Durkin J.P. Gagnon L. Isaacs R.J. Maclean S. Neugebauer W. Willick G. Rixon R.H. Endocrinology. 1992; 130: 53-60Google Scholar, 27Heasley L.E. Johnson G.L. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 8646-8652Google Scholar). Briefly, cells were washed twice with serum-free media and stimulated with different concentrations of PTH or PTHRP synthetic fragments or PMA for a period of 2 min. At the end of the stimulation period, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and then gently scraped in a buffer (800 μl) containing 2 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 250 mM sucrose, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM PMSF, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin. These cells were then sonicated twice on ice for a period of 10 s each using a Branson Sonifier (model 450) set at low intensity. This was followed by a 60-min ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g. The supernatant containing the cytosolic fraction was removed. The pellet containing the membrane fraction was resuspended in the same buffer (800 μl) containing 10% Triton X-100 and sonicated twice on ice for 10 s at medium intensity. The sonicate was shaken at 4°C for 1 h and then subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100,000 × g for 60 min. The supernatant containing the solubilized membrane fraction was then collected. The cytosol and solubilized membrane fractions were then each applied to a DEAE-cellulose column, which was washed with buffer containing 2 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 mM PMSF, and 2.5 μg/ml leupeptin. The PKC enzyme was eluted from the column with buffers containing 130 and 150 mM NaCl. The PKC activity of the eluate was assayed by incorporation of [γ-32P]ATP into a seven-amino acid synthetic peptide (FKKSFKL-NH2) and quantitated using a β-counter. All counts were then corrected for the amount of protein present in 50 μl of the cytosolic or the solubilized membrane fraction. Results were calculated as the amount of PKC present in the membrane relative to the amount of PKC present in the cytosol, and control ratios were taken as basal activity and normalized to a value of 1. Total RNA was extracted from cell cultures according to the method of Chomczynski and Sacchi(28Chomczynski P. Sacchi N. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 162: 156-159Google Scholar). The RNA preparation was denatured in 37% formaldehyde and separated by agarose gel (1.5%) electrophoresis, transferred onto nitrocellulose membrane filters, and baked at 80°C for 2 h. The RNA blots were then hybridized with cDNAs encoding rat NHE-1 (PstI fragment, nucleotides +478 to +1850; number +1 begins at the ATG translation start codon), NHE-2 (BamHI-SacII fragment, nucleotides +269 to +1314), NHE-3 (PstI fragment, nucleotides +1153 to +2434), or NHE-4 (KpnI-DraI fragment, nucleotides +1427 to +2535). Probes were labeled with [α-32P]dCTP using an Amersham Multiprime DNA labeling kit. The filters were prehybridized, hybridized, and washed as described previously(12Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Google Scholar). The filters were then exposed to autoradiographic film with an intensifying screen for 8 days at −80°C. Amiloride-inhibitable 22Na+ Influx was used as a measure of Na+/H+ exchanger activity as described previously(15Orlowski J. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 16369-16377Google Scholar). Briefly, UMR-106 cells were grown to confluence in 24-well plates. Cells were incubated in serum-free media overnight. The cells were then washed twice with a Na+-saline solution containing 130 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 20 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4) followed by a 15-min period of preincubation at 37°C in the same Na+-saline solution supplemented with appropriate concentrations of the various stimulatory agents. The cells were then washed twice with a solution containing 130 mM choline chloride, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, 5 mM glucose, and 20 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4). 22Na+ influx assays were initiated by incubating the cells with the respective agents prepared in choline chloride solution containing 1 mM ouabain and 1 μCi/ml 22NaCl (carrier-free), and in the absence or presence of 1 mM amiloride for 12 min (unless indicated otherwise) at room temperature. The incubation was terminated by adding 1 ml of an ice-cold NaCl stop solution containing 130 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 2 mM CaCl2, and 20 mM HEPES-Tris (pH 7.4). The solution was quickly aspirated and then rapidly repeated an additional three times. In experiments where exchanger activity was to be determined from the rate of 22Na+ influx at constant H+i concentration, pHi was clamped by incubating the cells in medium of varying K+ concentration containing the K+/H+ exchange ionophore nigericin(29Thomas J.A. Buchsbaum R.N. Zimniak A. Racker E. Biochemistry. 1979; 18: 2210-2218Google Scholar). Because at equilibrium [K+i]/[K+o] = [H+i]/H+o], the desired pHi was calculated from the imposed [K+] gradient and the extracellular pH (pHo = 7.4), assuming an intracellular [K+] of 140 mM. Briefly, the cell monolayer were washed twice with Na+-saline solution and preincubated for 15 min in KCl solution. In this study, the pHi was set at 6.6; the pHi clamping solution contained 142 mMN-methyl-D-glucamine methanesulfonate, 14 mM KCl, 8 mM potassium glutamate, 2 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 10 μM nigericin, and 10 mM HEPES. Then, the solution was removed and measurements were made in KCl solution supplemented with 1 mM ouabain and 1 μCi/ml 22NaCl in the absence or presence of 1 mM amiloride. To extract the radiolabel, the cells were solubilized in 250 μl of 0.5 N NaOH and the wells washed with 250 μl of 0.5 N HCl. Both the solubilized cell extracts and the wash solutions were added to scintillation vials, and the radioactivity was quantitated in a β-counter. Amiloride-sensitive Na+/H+ exchanger activity was defined as the difference between the rates of 22Na+ influx in the absence and presence of 1 mM amiloride. Earlier studies (30Goltzman D.

Med. 1986; 315: 1004-1013Google Scholar) have shown that PTH and PTHRP require the first two NH2-terminal amino acids and amino acids 25-34 to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity. In contrast, amino acids 3-34 and even smaller regions (amino acids 28-34) appear sufficient to activate PKC translocation to the plasma membrane(26Jouishomme H. Whitfield J.F. Chakravarthy B.

Res. 1994; 9: 943-949Google Scholar). To verify the linkage of the PTH receptor to these signaling pathways in our UMR-106 cell line, experiments were conducted using a series of synthetic fragments of human PTH and PTHRP that should allow one to distinguish between activation of the PKA and PKC pathways. As an initial experiment, the influence of PTH(1-34) concentration on adenylate cyclase activity was assessed. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, PTH(1-34) increased adenylate cyclase activity 29-fold in a concentration-dependent manner, achieving half-maximal stimulation at ∼10−9M. Based on this result, a single hormone concentration of 100 nM was used to evaluate the effect of the other synthetic PTH and PTHRP analogues. As shown in Fig. 1B, both PTH(1-34) and PTHRP(1-34) stimulated adenylate cyclase activity ∼25-fold, while no increase in enzyme activity was detected with fragments PTH(3-34), PTH(28-42), PTH(28-48), and PTHRP(1Rouleau M.F.

Chem. 1993; 268: 25536-25541Google Scholar), all lacking either amino acids 1-2 or 25-34. As expected, forskolin caused a large increase (75-fold) in adenylate cyclase activity. The effect of these same fragments on PKC activity was then determined (Fig. 2, A-C). In contrast to the effects on the adenylate cyclase system, hormone-stimulated PKC activity was observed with all the fragments in a concentration-dependent manner except PTHRP(1-16), which was inert in the PKC assay as it was in the adenylate cyclase assay. Interestingly, PTH(1-34) was more effective in activating PKC than adenylate cyclase, with half-maximal stimulation being achieved at ∼10−11M. This most likely reflects the differential sensitivities of the two signaling pathways to fractional occupancy of a single receptor. The phorbol ester PMA also similarly enhanced PKC activity in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 2D). Thus, in these cells, the PTH receptor is linked to both the adenylate cyclase-cAMP-PKA and phospholipase C-diacylglycerol-PKC pathways.Figure 2:Concentration dependence of PTH and PTHRP peptide fragments and PMA on PKC activity of UMR-106 cells. Experiments were performed as described under “Experimental Procedures.” Results are the mean ± S.E. of up to nine determinations from three separate experiments and are shown as an index of the ratio of PKC activity present in the membrane per PKC activity present in the cytosol (PKCmemb/PKCcyt). The ratio of PKCmemb/PKCcyt in the absence of any agent (0.170 ± 0.003) served as the control (C) and was normalized to a value of 1 for comparative purposes.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) To determine which isoform of the Na+/H+ exchanger is present in UMR-106 cells, Northern blot analyses were performed. The rat NHE-1 cDNA probe clearly hybridized with mRNA extracted from UMR-106 cells as well as with mRNA from control AP-1 cell transformants expressing rat NHE-1 (Fig. 3, top left panel). The UMR-106 transcript was of the expected size (∼4.8 kilobases)(12Orlowski J. Kandasamy R.A. Shull G.E. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 9331-9339Google Scholar), whereas the transfected NHE-1 transcript was ∼3.6 kilobases, reflecting the size of the truncated cDNA used for stable expression. In contrast, while transcripts encoding rat NHE-2 and NHE-3 were detected in AP-1 cells transfected with the respective cDNAs, no hybridization signals were observed with UMR-106 mRNA (Fig. 3, bottom left and top right panels). Similarly, NHE-4 mRNA was not detected in UMR-106 cells, although it was readily detected in PS120 cells transfected with rat NHE-4 (Fig. 3, bottom right panel). Thus, UMR-106 cells appear to express only the NHE-1 isoform. As demonstrated above, synthetic peptide fragments of PTH and PTHRP were capable of activating either adenylate cyclase and PKC or just PKC. Hence, these fragments provide a useful means of determining whether stimulation of one or both pathways are associated with PTH/PTHRP regulation of NHE-1. To this end, preliminary studies were conducted to define appropriate assay conditions for measuring Na+/H+ exchanger activity, defined as initial rates of amiloride-inhibitable 22Na+ influx, as a function of uptake time and hormone concentration. Following pretreatment of UMR-106 cells with 100 nM PTH(1-34) for 15 min in Na+-saline medium, amiloride-inhibitable 22Na+ influx was found to increase linearly in the continual presence of the PTH analogue for a 12-min period (Fig. 4A). In view of this observation, subsequent measurements were performed using this time interval. PTH(1-34) also stimulated NHE-1 activity in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching levels of ∼250-300% at 100 nM PTH(1-34); the maximum concentration tested (Fig. 4B). Thereafter, a concentration of 100 nM was adopted for the other peptide hormone fragments. As illustrated in Fig. 5, both PTH(1-34) and PTHRP(1-34) stimulated amiloride-inhibitable 22Na influx to a similar extent (∼250%). However, PTH(28-42), which activated only PKC, had no effect on NHE-1 activity. An identical lack of potency was also observed for PTH(3-34) and PTH(28-48) (data not shown) as well as the biologically inert fragment PTHRP(1-16) (Fig. 5).Figure 5:Influence of PTH and PTHRP fragments and forskolin on Na+/H+ exchanger activity in UMR-106 cells. Prior to measurements of Na+/H+ exchanger activity, confluent UMR-106 cells were pretreated for 15 min with peptide fragments of PTH and PTHRP (each at 100 nM), forskolin (10 μM), or 1,9-dideoxyforskolin (10 μM), or pretreated for 1 h with the PKA antagonist H-89 (100 μM) to which PTH(1-34) or forskolin were added during the last 15 min. Results are shown as the difference between initial rates of 22Na+ influx in the absence and presence of 1 mM amiloride and are expressed as percent change in amiloride-inhibitable 22Na+ influx. Each value is the mean ± S.E. of 6 determinations from three experiments.

https://openalex.org/W2028699500,"The solution structure has been determined for a 19-residue peptide that is fully folded at room temperature. The sequence of this peptide is based on the C-loop, residues 371-389, of the fourth epidermal growth factor-like domain of thrombomodulin, a protein that acts as a cofactor for the thrombin activation of protein C. Despite its small size, the peptide forms a compact structure with almost no repeating secondary structure. The results indicate the structure is held together by hydrophobic interactions, which in turn stabilize the two β-turns in the structure. The first β-turn in the C-loop represents a conserved motif that is found in the published structures of five other epidermal growth factor-like proteins. The critical role of Phe376 in the stabilization of the first β-turn is consistent with mutagenesis data with soluble thrombomodulin. The results also show that a small subdomain of a larger protein can fold independently, and therefore it could act as an initiation site for further folding.

The activation of protein C by thrombin is accelerated >1000-fold when TM is present as a cofactor. Generation of activated protein C, which inactivates factor Va and factor VIIIa, is an important anticoagulant mechanism of the endothelial cell surface(1Esmon N.L. Owen W.G. Esmon C.T. J. Biol.

TM is a multidomain protein, which spans the endothelial cell membrane. Full cofactor activity is present in the soluble ectodomain produced by elastase(4Kurosawa S. Galvin J.B. Esmon N.L. Esmon C.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1987; 262: 2206-2212Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Several studies performed with mutagenesis or with peptides derived from the ectodomain of human TM have defined the domains required for activity. The smallest fragment with full cofactor activity for the activation of protein C by thrombin contains the last three consecutive EGF-like domains, EGF4-6(5Hayashi T. Zushi M. Yamamoto S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20156-20159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 6Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. Kuhn I. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). Recent studies suggest that the region of thrombomodulin that binds tightly to thrombin is distinct from the region that modulates the active site of thrombin. Significantly, a construct made from the fourth and fifth EGF-like domains, EGF45, retains approximately 10% of the cofactor activity, although binding to thrombin is drastically reduced(5Hayashi T. Zushi M. Yamamoto S. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 20156-20159Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Deletion mutants near EGF4 effect kcat/Km for the thrombin-TM complex with protein C, and removal of the fourth domain results in a complete loss of cofactor activity. However, deletion mutants that include the C-loop of EGF6 have a normal kcat/Km for protein C but decreased affinity for thrombin, as measured by the Kd for thrombin(6Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. Kuhn I. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1992; 185: 567-576Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar). A cyclic peptide based on the C-loop of EGF5 and the interdomain loop between EGF5 and EGF6 binds with high affinity to thrombin at the anion exosite of thrombin, a positively charged groove on the surface of thrombin important for TM, fibrinogen, and hirudin binding(5Hayashi T.

Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13553-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). The results suggest that EGF56 contains the high affinity binding site for thrombin and EGF4 contains residues that are absolutely required for activity. Site-specific mutants around EGF4, which result in low activity analogs, have defined some residues important for cofactor activity in this domain(9Zushi M. Gomi K. Honda G. Kondo S. Yamamoto S. Hayashi T. Suzuki K. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 19886-19889Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This includes Asp349 in the interdomain region between EGF3 and EGF4, Glu357 and Tyr358 in the B-loop, and Phe376 in the C-loop of EGF4 (the numbering of the residues in this paper is consistent with the sequence of thrombomodulin given by Suzuki et al.(11Suzuki K. Kusumoto H. Deyashiki Y. Nishioka J. Maruyana I. Zushi M. Kawahara S. Honda G. Yamamoto S. Horiguchi S. EMBO J. 1987; 6: 1891-1897Crossref PubMed Scopus (301) Google Scholar)). Met388 in the interdomain region between EGF4 and EGF5 adjacent to the C-loop of EGF4 can be oxidized to the low activity methionine sulfoxide analog(12Glaser C.B. Morser J. Clarke J.H. Blasko E. McLean K. Kuhn I. Chang R.-J. Lin J.-H. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Clin. Invest. 1992; 90: 2565-2573Crossref PubMed Scopus (202) Google Scholar). Perhaps of more interest are EGF4 mutants, which result in an increase in cofactor activity. Replacement of Met388 by leucine results in an analog with twice the cofactor activity of wild-type TM(13Clarke J.H. Light D.R. Blasko E. Parkinson J.F. Nagashima M. McLean K. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Morser J. Glaser C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6309-6315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). When a second mutation is introduced in the C-loop, His381→ Gly, and combined with the Met388→ Leu mutation, the resultant TM analog has four times the activity of wild-type TM. Clearly, one way these mutants could modulate cofactor activity is by altering the conformation of TM. To test this hypothesis, a set of cyclic peptides was synthesized based on the sequence of the individual loops of TM. Each loop contained a single disulfide. NMR was used to measure structures of these peptides in solution. It was hoped that a comparison between several peptides with single site mutations would shed light on the relationship between structure and function. Of course, these structural comparisons could only be made if the peptides were folded. In our experience, most peptides of this size do not fold in aqueous solutions. Indeed, there are relatively few structures of peptides of this length listed in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank. There are seven solution structures for peptides of less than 30 residues (Spring, 1994). All of these compounds contain at least two internal cross-links, which form the core of the structures. Most of the remaining residues form hairpin loops that are wrapped around a densely packed central core. During the course of this study, NMR was used to investigate the structure of nine different peptides. Each peptide contained approximately 20 residues and a single disulfide cross-link. The sequences were based on a single loop found either in TM or a homologous EGF-like protein. For most of the peptides, the spacing between the cysteines was much greater than the loops found in the small peptides of the protein bank data. Therefore, there must be a significant loss of conformational entropy during refolding. The experimental results indicated that the only peptides that formed a compact structure were based on the sequence of the C-loop of TM-EGF4 (Table 1). This was an unexpected result, since the peptides contained a long stretch of 13 amino acids between the cysteines. The experimental results were used to evaluate the structural homology between TM-EGF4 and other EGF-like proteins or domains that, in turn, provided a working hypothesis that explains some of the functional data.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab All peptides used in this study (Table 1) were synthesized by solid phase synthesis methods on a Biosearch 9600 Peptide Synthesis instrument using Fmoc (N-(9-fluorenyl)methyloxycarbonyl) as the temporary protection group and BOP (benzotriazolyl-L-oxy-tri(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate) as the coupling agent; side chains were protected by groups that were appropriate for this chemistry. The peptides were cleaved by trifluoroacetic acid containing small amounts of anisole, thioanisole, and ethanedithiol and were purified by preparative high pressure liquid chromatography on a reverse phase C18 column using 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid in an acetonitrile/water gradient. The cyclization was achieved in dilute water/dimethyl sulfoxide solution, adjusted to pH 8, in 4 days or until Ellman's reaction was negative. The cyclized material was purified on a preparative Polymer Labs PLRP-S 300Å column. Mass spectrometry was used to analyze the purity of the peptides before and after cyclization. Construction of Escherichia coli expression plasmids and procedures used for site-directed mutagenesis to construct plasmids coding for TMiE4-6-M388L mutants were previously described(10Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Construction and expression of TME mutants in Chinese hamster ovary cells were performed as previously described(12Glaser C.B. Morser J. Clarke J.H. Blasko E. McLean K. Kuhn I. Chang R.-J. Lin J.-H.

Preparation of E. coli periplasmic extracts and TM cofactor activity assay (APC assay) were previously described(10Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol.

Nagashima M. McLean K. Vilander L. Andrews W.H. Morser J. Glaser C.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 6309-6315Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) with minor modifications. In the current assay, the captured monoclonal antibody 43B has been replaced by monoclonal antibody 531, which was previously used as the detection antibody(13Clarke J.H. Light D.R. Blasko E.

The detection antibody is a rabbit polyclonal anti-TME(14Lin J.-H. McLean K. Morser J. Young T.A. Wydro R.M. Andrews W.H. Light D.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 25021-25030Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The relative specific activities of the mutants and the wild-type were determined under these conditions by the ratio of cofactor activity determined by the APC assay to mass determined by ELISA. Each clone of each mutant was assayed for specific activity between 4 and 17 times. All data were included in the determination of the significance of difference using a paired Student's t-test following guidelines provided with the program Statview. All NMR measurements were made on a Bruker AMX 500. A 90° pulse width of approximately 9.5 ns was used in the experiments. The peptides were dissolved in 95% H2O and 5% D2O. The pH was adjusted to 6.8 ± 0.1. The sample concentrations ranged from 12 mM for the [Met388]Mso to 2 mM for the Met388→ Leu peptide. The sample concentration for the double mutant was 9 mM. No buffers or salts were used in any of the solutions. Water suppression was done using selective presaturation. A scuba pulse sequence (15Brown S.C. Weber P. Mueller L. J. Magn.

A separate spectrum, described below, was used to quantitate the NOE peak intensity. Clean total correlation spectra (21Griesinger C. Otting G. Wüthrich K. Ernst R.R. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1988; 110: 7870-7872Crossref Scopus (1196) Google Scholar) were collected using a 60-ms MLEV-17 (22Bax A. Davis D.G. J. Magn. Reson. 1985; 65: 355-360Google Scholar) spin lock. Phase-sensitive detection along ω1 was achieved using time-porportional phase incrimination as described by Marion and Wüthrich(23Marion D. Wüthrich K. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 1983; 113: 967-974Crossref PubMed Scopus (3524) Google Scholar). For most experiments, 2048 complex data points were collected in the T2 direction, and 768 real points were collected along T1. The sequential proton assignments of the four peptides were obtained using standard homonuclear techniques(24Wüthrich K. NMR of Proteins and Nucleic Acids. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1986: 130-161Google Scholar). The spectra were processed using UXNMR (Bruker Instruments), and the results were analyzed using a software package developed from the algorithms outlined by Adler and Wagner(25Adler M. Wagner G. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 1031-1039Crossref PubMed Scopus (35) Google Scholar). Chemical shifts were somewhat arbitrarily assigned to be consistent with known values for both proteins and water. The chemical shift of water was assigned at 4.89 ppm at 3°C and 4.66 ppm at 23°C. Unless otherwise noted, the chemical shifts are reported for 3°C at pH 6.8. The HN-CαH coupling constants were measured directly from the DQF-COSY spectra without any correction for line width. Dihedral angle constraints were obtained for six φ angles (Fig. 1) using the following method. It was assumed that the observed coupling constants were accurate to ±1.5 Hz and that the maximum coupling should not exceed 10.5 Hz. A computer program was written that used the Karplus equation as parameterized by Pardi et al.(26Pardi A. Billeter M. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1984; 180: 741-751Crossref PubMed Scopus (939) Google Scholar) to calculate all values of φ that would match the coupling constant within experimental error. The maximum and minimum values of φ were then used as dihedral angle constraints. This method produces a continuous function that nearly matches the values used by Kline et al.(27Kline A.D. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 675-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar) for 8.0 and 10 Hz. The method sets a range of −77° to −53° for φ angle of Glu374, which had a coupling constant of 4.9 Hz. The coupling constants of both Leu388 and Phe389, 7.4 and 7.5 Hz, respectively, were also used for calculating restraints using the same program. A restriction was added to the calculation that rejected any positive values of φ. The intraresidue HN to CαH NOE peak for both of these residues indicated an interproton distance of approximately 3 Å, which is inconsistent with a positive value of φ. The resulting constraints were −165°≤φ and φ≤−75 for Phe389 and 1° wider for Leu388. NOE peak intensities were quantified from a NOESY spectrum of the double mutant (H381G,M388L). The recycle delay between pulses was 3.6 s. A 100-ms mixing was used to limit the artifacts caused by spin diffusion. The spectrum was processed using 75° shifted sine bell. The base line was flattened with a 5th order polynomial subroutine in both directions on the fully transformed data set using the Bruker processing software UXNMR. This subroutine has an automatic selection of base-line points. Correction along the F2 axis was performed in eight uneven sections to minimize the distortions caused by the dispersive water signal. The distance constraints were calculated from the peak intensity. A correction factor was included, which controlled for variation of peak width, based on the relative width of a resonance in the F2 direction compared with the width of the peaks used for calibration. Eight well-resolved methylene pairs were used to calculate the scaling factor between the peak volumes and the target distances. The variation in intensity between these peaks was 20%. The standard equation for translating peak volumes into target distances was modified so that the distances were lengthened to compensate for any experimental uncertainty. First, the volume of each peak was divided by two to compensate for variations in both peak width and intensity. Also, it was assumed the volumes of the weaker peaks were less accurate than the more intense ones. This uncertainty was handled mathematically by using instead of power to calculate distances from peak volumes. The final affect on the experimental data was that the target distances of 2.2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5, and 4.0 Å were lengthened to 2.6, 3.1, 3.8, 4.6, and 5.0 Å, respectively (an upper limit of 5.0 Å was used for all observed NOEs). The accuracy of the modified distance function was verified by examining the target values both intra- and sequential HN to CαH NOEs. The ranges of distances calculated from NOE peaks were roughly 20% larger than the expected values. The calculated distances obtained from 100-ms NOESY spectrum ranged from 2.5 to 4.7 Å. An additional 0.7 Å was added to all NOEs involving methyl groups(27Kline A.D. Braun W. Wüthrich K. J. Mol. Biol. 1988; 204: 675-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (224) Google Scholar). Lower bound constraints were set to the Van der Waal's contact radii. No stereospecific assignments were performed for the methylene protons. If a pair of NOE peaks was observed between two protons of a diastereo pair to a third proton, the weaker NOE peak was used to calculate the distance constraint. When only one NOE was observed, the distance constraint was referenced back to the nearest heavy atom that was equidistant from both protons. The distance constraint was lengthened by the fixed distance between the protons and the heavy atom. In general, the preliminary structures were not used to further interpret the spectra due to the inherent uncertainty involved with these techniques. However, some of the NOEs to the CδH positions of the two phenylalanines were stereospecifically assigned when the preliminary structures indicated a separation of greater than 7 Å between protons that had NOEs to same Phe CδH. The issue spin diffusion was not explicitly addressed during the preparation of the constraints. NOEs that involved a pair of methylene protons were examined for evidence of spin diffusion. We specifically looked at pairs of NOEs where one of two NOEs was very intense and could be a source of spin diffusion. In all cases, the inter-proton distance calculated for the weaker NOE was confirmed by an independent structural constraint. All structures were generated using the distance geometry package, DGII (version 2.2.0), of insightII, which was generously provided by BIOSYM, Inc. After smoothing the bound matrix using the triangle inequality, the individual structures were embedded and subject to a maximum of 10,000 steps of simulated annealing at a maximum temperature of 200 K. The resultant structures were minimized by a conjugate gradient using a maximum of 250 steps. 34 out of 100 structures were selected for making comparisons. These structures had residual penalty functions below the mean structure and had no NOE violations greater than 0.2 Å. All peptides examined had the same fold. The structures with higher residual penalty functions showed greater deviations from the mean. It was previously shown (10Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that there was a drastic loss of activity when alanine was substituted for the following residues in EGF4 of TM: Glu357 and Tyr358 in the B-loop and Phe376 in the C-loop. Working with a construct made from EGF4-6 of TM, TMiE4-6-M388L, it was shown that full function was restored by conservative substitution of the two aromatic residues. Thus, both Tyr358→ Phe and Phe376→ Tyr were fully active. Conservative substitution of Glu357 partially restored function. Glu357→ Gln had only 1 ± 2% of native activity, and Glu357→ Asp restored 48 ± 15% of the function (p < 0.05). Thus, the functional assay indicates there is little tolerance for variation at Glu357, and major changes are not tolerated at positions Tyr358 and Phe376. A fourth set of substitutions was made in an attempt to increase activity. His381 is only found in human TM. Glycine is found in this position in both mouse and hamster TM. Comparison with homologous proteins indicates that there was probably a β-turn at this position. Experiments demonstrated that His381→ Gly doubled the specific activity of human TMiE4-6-M388L. The double mutant, H381G,M388L, is 400% more active than soluble TM analogs with the native human sequence. The substitution of His381→ Ala (10Nagashima M. Lundh E. Leonard J.C. Morser J. Parkinson J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 2888-2892Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) had no affect. His381→ Pro actually caused a slight decrease in activity (60 ± 28%). Three separate peptides were synthesized based on the sequence of TM-EGF4: the A-loop, residues 345-361; the B-loop, residues 352-371; and the C-loop, residues 371-389. Each peptide was cyclized by forming a single native disulfide bond. For the A- and the B-loops, 2-aminobutyric acid was substituted for the unpaired cysteine. The NMR results indicated that the A- and B-loops did not fold into compact structures. The two-dimensional NMR spectra of these peptides showed that the chemical shifts of the protons were similar to the random coil values for the same amino acids(28Bundi A. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 285-298Crossref Scopus (830) Google Scholar). Also, the JHN-Hα3 coupling constants were all within 1 Hz of the random coil values with the single exception of 11 Hz for Val371. Exhaustive analysis of the NOESY spectra of both the A- and B-loops revealed only eight NOEs that connected residues separated by at least one amino acid; two bridged across the disulfide bonds, one connected the HNs of Asn355 to Tyr358, and the remaining five involved residues separated by a single amino acid. Only two of the eight NOEs involved backbone-backbone interactions. Structure calculations utilizing the combined experimental constraints from both peptides failed to converge on a unique structure. The solution structures of three other loops from EGF-like proteins were examined: the C-loop of TM-EGF5, the C-loop of transforming growth factor-α, and the B-loop of human urokinase EGF domain. Inspection of the two-dimensional TOCSY spectra indicated that there was little chemical shift dispersion of the protons beyond what was expected based on the random coil values(28Bundi A. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 285-298Crossref Scopus (830) Google Scholar). No further analysis was attempted. The results from the C-loop of TM-EGF5 were confirmed by a recent report (8Srinivasan J. Hu S. Hrabel R. Zhu Y. Komives E.A. Ni F. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 13553-13560Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Although the peptide is unfolded in solution, it forms a unique conformation upon binding to the anion exosite of thrombin. Two-dimensional spectra of the peptide based on the C-loop of TM-EGF4 indicated that the peptide did form a compact structure. In particular, the chemical shifts of the amide protons ranged from 7.5 to 9.3 ppm (Table 2). The comparable range for the same protons in unfolded peptides would be 8.2-8.4(28Bundi A. Wüthrich K. Biopolymers. 1979; 18: 285-298Crossref Scopus (830) Google Scholar). To probe further the relationship between structure and function, a total of four peptides derived from the C-loop of EGF4 were synthesized (Table 1). Although the peptides folded into compact structures, the isolated peptides had no measurable effect on modulating the activation of protein C by thrombin when tested alone as a cofactor for thrombin or as a competitive inhibitor of the action of thrombomodulin on thrombin, even at concentrations as high as 5 mM. 2G. Rumennik and D. R. Light, unpublished data. The activity measurements shown in Table 1were performed by incorporating the sequence of each of these peptides back into a truncated but fully active form of thrombomodulin containing the fourth, fifth, and sixth EGF-like domains, TMiE4-6-M388L. The activity, as a percentage of the specific activity of the TM native sequence, ranged from 400 to 10%. The most detailed structural work was performed on the double mutant, H381G,M388L, since this represents the most active sequence. The two-dimensional spectra indicated that all four peptides had the same overall fold (see below for details).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The proton chemical shifts for the native sequence appear in Table 2. Selected residues from the other peptides are also listed. Assignments have been made for 113 of 115 slowly exchanging and nonexchanging protons in the native sequence. Assignments of the remaining protons were probably obscured by degenerate protons within the same residue. Fig. 1shows the sequential NOEs that were used in making the assignments. The structure reported here is obtained from the peptide based on the double mutant at 3°C (pH 6.8). A total of 213 NOEs was assigned for the double mutant. Approximately 21 of the 48 intraresidue NOEs and 20 of the 85 sequential NOEs had upper bound distances that were greater than the distance allowed by the covalent geometry. This left a total 172 useful NOEs, which had the following distribution: 27 intraresidue, 65 sequential, 26 medium range (i to i + 2-5) and 54 long range (i to i + <5) NOEs. Torsion angle constraints for the angle δ were derived from eight HN-CαH coupling constants. This gives an average of 9.5 useful constraints per residue. The structure itself is shown in Fig. 2A. The root mean square deviations of the well determined backbone atoms is 0.6 Å to the average structure and 0.9 Å for the pair-wise interactions (Fig. 2B). This figure excludes N-terminal Val371 because there is almost no structural information for this residue. Root mean square deviation for all heavy atoms to average structure is 1.3 Å (1.8 Å for the pair-wise interactions.) The side chain conformation has been accurately determined for Phe376, Ile379, His384, and Gln387. Constraints on the protein backbone also determine the location"

Our data are consistent with the breakage and joining reactions being carried out by a single composite active site in which some residues contribute to both reactions while others contribute to one of the two reactions. Conservative site-specific recombination between two DNA substrates by the integrase family recombinases (Argos et al., 1986; Abremski and Hoess, 1992) is accomplished in two step-wise exchanges of two strands each, a Holliday junction being an obligatory intermediate (Craig, 1988; Stark et al., 1992; Sadowski, 1993; Jayaram, 1994). The reaction is mediated by a tetrameric assembly of the recombinase monomer. Each pair of exchanges requires two strand breakages and two strand joinings. Chemically, the strand breakage and union events are transesterification reactions. During the breakage step, the scissile phosphodiester is subjected to nucleophilic attack by the active site tyrosine of the recombinase (Evans et al., 1990). The reaction produces a 3′-phosphotyrosyl linkage between DNA and protein and exposes a free 5′-hydroxyl group. During the strand union step, the 5′-hydroxyl group formed at the nick within one DNA substrate carries out nucleophilic attack on the 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond within the partner substrate. The DNA phosphodiester is thus reformed, and the recombinase is released from covalent bonding to DNA. What is the role of each recombinase monomer in the strand cleavage and the strand joining steps? Does the recombinase use two separate active sites or a single active site to perform these two steps? During a round of recombination, does a recombinase monomer retain its association with the target DNA element to which it is initially bound? Or is there dissociation and redistribution of the protein monomers from their original configuration? The nondissociative mode would be consistent with a unitary active site mechanism for strand cleavage and strand joining, whereas the dissociative mode would be more consistent with a binary active site mechanism. We address here these fundamental mechanistic issues of recombination chemistry using the integrase family site-specific recombinase Flp from Saccharomyces cerevisiae. All reactions were done with Flp or Flp variants affinity-purified over a column containing oligomeric units of a Flp site oligodeoxynucleotide linked to CNBr-activated Sepharose (Parsons et al., 1990). The purity of the final preparations was approximately 90%. Flp protein concentrations were estimated by comparisons between densitometric scans of Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained Flp aliquots (fractionated in SDS-polyacrylamide gels) and similar scans of known amounts of bovine serum albumin. The hybrid protein obtained by fusing a Flp variant to glutathione S-transferase was purified as described by Yang and Jayaram(1994). Oligodeoxynucleotides for construction of half-sites, full sites and Holliday junctions were synthesized in an Applied Biosystems DNA synthesizer (model 380A) using phosphoramidite chemistry (Beaucage and Caruthers, 1981). Approximately 2-4 pmol each of the appropriate oligodeoxynucleotides were mixed in TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.8, at 23°C, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0), heated to 65°C for 10 min and cooled slowly to room temperature. Normally the radioactively labeled strand was held at one-half to one-third the concentration of the unlabeled partner strands during hybridization. To label the 5′-end of a deoxyoligonucleotide, it was phosphorylated by T4 polynucleotide kinase in presence of [γ-32P]ATP. In some cases, the 5′-hydroxyl group was phosphorylated with nonradioactive ATP. The unreacted ATP was removed by spin dialysis on a Sephadex G-25 column. Hybridization to the partner oligodeoxynucleotide(s) was done in TE. The conditions for half-site strand transfer were essentially the same as those described previously (Chen et al., 1992a). Normally the reactions contained approximately 0.02-0.05 pmol of the half-site and an excess of Flp (8-10 pmol of Flp/pmol of Flp binding element) in a reaction volume of 30 μl. Reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS (0.1% final concentration) and treated with proteinase K (100 μg/reaction for 1 h at 37°C). After chloroform/phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was fractionated by electrophoresis in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide:bis-acrylamide, 19:1). Since the reactions contained a radiolabeled substrate strand cleavage and strand exchange products were visualized by autoradiography. Approximately 0.1 pmol of the labeled half-site or full site was incubated with Flp or a Flp variant for 15 min at room temperature in the recombination medium (Chen et al., 1992a), except that polyethylene glycol was omitted. Samples were subjected to electrophoresis in 5% (for full sites) or 10% (for half-sites) polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 30:1) under nondenaturing conditions. DNA-protein complexes were visualized by autoradiography. Complexes formed by association of Flp or a Flp variant with a labeled DNA target were separated by electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels. Complexes of interest were then excised from the gel after their position was determined by autoradiography. The gel slices were immersed in standard recombination medium (Chen et al., 1992a) containing 100 mM tyramine-HCl, and gently shaken for 15 min at 30°C. They were then rinsed briefly with 10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA (pH 7.5). DNA was extracted from these slices by standard procedures and fractionated by electrophoresis in 10% denaturing polyacrylamide gels (acrylamide to bisacrylamide, 19:1). The bands corresponding to unreacted substrate, cleavage product, and recombinant product were identified by autoradiography. Restriction enzyme digestions, isolation of plasmid DNA, and other miscellaneous procedures were done as described by Maniatis et al.(1982). Since recombination is the sum of two sets of strand cleavage and joining events, each involving a pair of DNA strands, it is convenient to conceptually divide the recombinase tetramer functionally into a dimer of dimers (or two pairs of monomers). Two models for recombination may then be considered and are outlined in Fig. 1. These conform to the discovery that a Flp monomer does not cleave the scissile phosphodiester adjacent to it but cleaves that distal to it across the spacer (or strand exchange region) (Chen et al., 1992a, 1993; Lee et al., 1994). In the “equal tetramer model” shown in Fig. 1A, recombination is carried out by two functionally equivalent pairs of monomers. We may imagine that the pair of monomers bound to one side of the spacer provide the pockets for strand cleavage and strand joining at that end. They receive the nucleophiles for cleavage (Tyr-343) in trans from the pair of Flp monomers bound across from them. Similarly, they receive the nucleophiles for strand joining (5′-hydroxyl groups) from the Flp-nicked DNA strands. Following formation of the Holliday intermediate, a conformational change within the recombination complex reverses the role of the monomer pairs. The pair of Flp monomers that were catalytically quiescent during the formation of the Holliday intermediate (except for donation of the active site tyrosine) now provide the active site pockets for the cleavage/joining chemistry that resolves the Holliday junction into mature recombinants. The pair of monomers that were initially active are now quiescent, and their role is limited to supplying the catalytic tyrosine residues. In the “unequal tetramer model” (Fig. 1B), the functional contributions of each of the two pairs of protein monomers to recombination are nonequivalent. For example, one pair is specified to make nearly exclusive contributions toward assembling the strand cleavage pocket; this pair accepts the appropriately oriented Tyr-343 residues from the second pair. The latter pair contributes almost exclusively to building the strand joining pocket, except for donating the catalytic tyrosine residues for strand cleavage. This pair accepts the 5′-hydroxyl groups from Flp-nicked DNA as the active nucleophiles for the strand joining reaction. Since recombination calls for phosphoryl transfers performed at one end of the spacer to be repeated at the other, limiting the functions of each pair of Flp monomers to either cleavage or joining necessitates the translocation of protein monomers between two Flp binding elements (Fig. 1B). Variations of this model in which recombinase replacement occurs from solution rather than across binding elements may also be conceived. Although the physical separation of the two binding elements of a recombination target site by two helical turns (21 base pairs from midpoint to midpoint) on the linear DNA would seem to preclude protein translocation, this is deceptive. In the Flp-occupied state, the binding elements are arranged virtually in tandem to each other by virtue of the large protein-induced DNA bend of 140° or more centered within the spacer (Schwartz and Sadowski, 1990; Chen et al., 1992b). Trans DNA cleavage by a Flp monomer and consequent covalent attachment of Flp to the phosphate located across the spacer from it may indeed trigger protein displacement. Thus the relative spatial disposition of the Flp monomers during recombination does not run counter to the possibility of switching protein partners between two binding elements. The idea of the swap cannot be discounted by energetic considerations either. Protein DNA contacts broken at one binding element would be remade at the other, and the system would be essentially isoenergetic prior to and following the swap. Furthermore, recent experiments reveal that the loss of a single G-C contact is sufficient to destabilize a Flp monomer associated with a binding element and markedly increase its dissociation rate (Lee et al., 1994). Although the scheme shown in Fig. 1A is simpler and hence more attractive than that in Fig. 1B, there is no strict experimental evidence that a single Flp monomer can mediate both the cleavage and the joining events required for one strand exchange. We describe below experimental strategies that attempt to distinguish between models 1A and 1B. Our rationale was to design an experimental system in which the role of a given Flp monomer in a single cleavage/joining reaction could be addressed. A half-site substrate, initially designed for analysis of the λ integrase reaction (Nunes-Duby et al., 1989) and subsequently adapted for the Flp system (Qian et al., 1990; Amin et al., 1991; Serre et al., 1992), contains one recombinase binding element, one cleavage site, and one 5′-hydroxyl group that can act as a phosphoryl acceptor during strand joining. The chemistry involved in the cleavage/joining reaction within a half-site (see Fig. 4A) is equivalent to that required to generate one of the four recombinant strands resulting from a normal recombination event. When a half-site was bound by a Flp mutant lacking the active site tyrosine, Flp(Y343F), a single half-site-protein complex (Qian et al., 1990; Serre et al., 1992) could be identified by electrophoresis on a 10% native polyacrylamide gel (HS I; Fig. 2A, lane 2). Higher order complexes (predominantly HS II; presumably two equivalents of HS I associated noncovalently) in addition to HS I were produced by wild type Flp (Fig. 2A, lane 1). We inferred that HS I contained one Flp monomer associated with the unitary Flp binding element within the half-site from the experiment shown in Fig. 2B. Here a full site containing a pair of Flp binding elements was bound by Flp(Y343F) (Fig. 2B, lane 1) or by a hybrid protein obtained by fusion of Flp(Y343F) with glutathione S-transferase (Fig. 2B, lane 2) or by a mixture of Flp(Y343F) and GST-Flp(Y343F) in roughly equimolar amounts (lane 3, Fig. 2B). The two complexes formed by Flp(Y343F) are designated C IF and C IIF; the corresponding complexes formed by GST-Flp(Y343F) are labeled C IG and C IIG. In the reaction with the mixture of proteins, the complex II was split into three complexes in a roughly 1:2:1 molar ratio. In contrast, the complex I did not show the band split. The simplest explanation of these data is that complex I was formed by binding of a single protein monomer to the labeled substrate, and complex II was formed by binding of two protein monomers, one to each of the two binding elements. Thus complex II in the mixed reaction included the additional species, C IIF-G, representing the heterodimeric protein association on the DNA. The small amount of the band comigrating with the C IIF-G band in lane 2 can be accounted for by some free Flp(Y343F) produced by breakdown of the hybrid protein during purification. The one to one association between a Flp monomer and a Flp binding element implies that the smallest DNA-protein complex obtained with the half-site must contain one recombinase monomer bound to one half-site molecule. Consistent with this inferred molar stoichiometry, a binding reaction of the labeled half-site in Fig. 2A with an equimolar mixture of Flp(Y343F) and GST-Flp(Y343F) revealed only two discrete complexes corresponding to the HS I species formed by each of the two proteins and gave no indication of a hybrid complex (data not shown).Figure 2:Association of Flp recombinase with half-sites and full sites. A, the single Flp binding element within the half-site (HS) is shown by the horizontal arrows. The scissile phosphodiester is indicated by p. The half-site was labeled at the 5′-end on the strand that is cleaved by Flp (shown by the asterisk). The length of the strand exchange segment (spacer) was 3 nt on the cleavage strand and 8 nt on the noncleavage strand. The spacer on the noncleavage strand contained a free 5′-hydroxyl group. The presumed compositions of the Flp/half-site complexes HS I and HS II are shown at the left. The assignments are consistent with the results in B. The recombinase monomer is represented by the hatched oval. B, the full site (S) containing two Flp binding elements and two scissile phosphodiesters was labeled on both strands. Protein-DNA complexes formed with Flp(Y343F) or GST-Flp(Y343F) (hatched oval with the protrusion) are named on the right, and their inferred stoichiometries are depicted on the left.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) We also ensured that there was only one molecule of half-site per molecule of HS I by incubating two half-sites of different lengths (HSa and HSb in Fig. 3A), either separately or as an equimolar mixture with Flp(Y343F). Each half-site yielded a single HS I complex with Flp(Y343F) individually (HS Ia and HS Ib; Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 3 and 4), and in combination, they failed to yield a hybrid complex (Fig. 3, B and C, lane 5). Panel C represents a set of binding reactions similar to those in panel B, except that the time of electrophoresis was increased to obtain greater resolution of the HS Ia and HS Ib complexes. Even under these conditions, no trace of a hybrid complex was detected. With wild type Flp, The HS I pattern was similar to that obtained with Flp(Y343F) (Fig. 3, B and C, lanes 6-8). However, the Flp half-site dimer (HS II complex) was split into three components, corresponding to the predicted two homodimeric species (HS IIa-a and HS IIb-b; Fig. 3B, lanes 6 and 7) and one heterodimeric species (HS IIa-b; Fig. 3B, lane 8). These results are in agreement with those reported by Amin et al.(1991) for binding reactions containing mixed half-sites. In summary, the half-site and full site binding results certify that each binding element within a Flp target site associates with one Flp monomer. Furthermore, binding of Flp(Y343F) to a half-site results in a unitary protein-DNA complex containing one half-site and one protein monomer. Trapping of a half-site in association with a single recombinase monomer provides an enzyme-substrate complex in which the protein-DNA dynamics during one round of strand breakage/union steps can be analyzed. Recent experiments have shown that a half-site bound by the catalytically inactive mutant Flp(Y343F) can be induced to undergo cleavage by the tyrosine mimic, tyramine, added exogenously (Lee et al., 1993; see Fig. 4A). The resulting product in which the 3′-phosphate at the cleavage point is covalently linked to tyramine is a good substrate for the strand joining reaction. Can the same bound monomer of Flp(Y343F) facilitate both cleavage and joining in presence of tyramine? Following electrophoretic fractionation, the gel slice corresponding to HS I yielded by Flp(Y343F) (see Fig. 2A) was excised and soaked in a 100 mM solution of tyramine for 15 min at 30°C. The DNA was eluted from the complex and fractionated on a 10% sequencing gel. The cleavage product (C) as well as the strand transfer product (P) were formed within HSI upon tyramine treatment (Fig. 4B, lane 3). Neither of the two products were detectable in HSI when tyramine incubation was omitted (Fig. 4B, lane 2). Within the gel-trapped HS I complex, protein dissociation and reassociation must be absent or at least severely restricted. Yet the yield of the recombinant product was comparable (within a factor of 2) with that from a tyramine reaction performed in solution (compare lane 3 of Fig. 4B to lane 3 of Fig. 5A). Thus the same monomer of Flp(Y343F) “immobilized” on the half-site was capable of facilitating not only the tyramine-mediated strand cleavage step but also the subsequent strand joining step. The inference that a single Flp monomer can activate the target diester during the two transesterification reactions of recombination was confirmed by the tyramine reaction carried out in solution. The rationale is based on the finding that a mutant of Flp altered at Tyr-343 and His-305, Flp(H305L,Y343F) can support neither strand cleavage (C) nor strand joining (P) in a half-site in the presence of added tyramine (Fig. 5A, lane 2). The labeled half-site was prebound with Flp(Y343F) on ice for 10 min. After transfer to 30°C, Flp(Y343F,H305L) was added in molar ratios of 1, 2, 4, and 8 (with respect to Flp(Y343F)) to the reaction together with tyramine (Fig. 5B). The cleavage and strand transfer products were assayed after a 15-min incubation period at 30°C. The amounts of strand transfer product obtained were approximately the same irrespective of the absence of the double mutant (Fig. 5A, lane 3) or its presence in up to an 8-fold molar excess relative to Flp(Y343F) (Fig. 5B, lane 4). The slight decrease in the product band in lane 4 of Fig. 4B is best explained by partial replacement of Flp(Y343F) by the Flp double variant prior to strand cleavage. Densitometric quantitation of bands P and C normalized to HS (from appropriately exposed autoradiograms) revealed the same ratio of strand transfer product to cleavage product in all of the lanes. Preferential protein replacement following strand cleavage should have skewed this ratio in favor of the cleavage product. Similar results were obtained when the prebound complex was mixed with up to nearly a 250-500-fold molar excess of the cold substrate and concomitantly treated with tyramine (Fig. 5C, lanes 1-5). By contrast, in reactions where the two proteins were mixed in the same molar ratios as in Fig. 5B and reacted with the labeled substrate in the presence of tyramine, there was a progressive decrease in the amounts of the cleavage and strand transfer product (Fig. 5D, lanes 1-4). These results corroborate the notion that, following strand cleavage by tyramine, there is no dissociation of Flp(Y343F) from the labeled half-site prior to strand joining. If there had been protein dissociation, the excess double mutant should have occupied the emptied sites (Fig. 5B), or the free protein should have been titrated out by the excess cold half-site (Fig. 5C), inhibiting strand transfer within the labeled half-site in either case. The above experiment does not exclude the possibility that between the cleavage and joining steps there might still have been protein transplacement at a half-site by a monomer bound to a second half-site molecule rather than by one from solution. For example, in the unequal tetramer model shown in Fig. 1B, protein exchanges are depicted as occurring from within the DNA-occupied state. To test the validity of this idea, the competition experiment shown in Fig. 5 was modified as follows (see Fig. 6). The labeled half-site bound by Flp(Y343F) was challenged with an excess of the unlabeled half-site prebound by Flp(Y343F, H305L) at the same time that tyramine was added to the reaction. The cleavage/joining reaction was not significantly inhibited over a 160-fold excess of the competitor protein-DNA complex (compare the reactions shown in Fig. 6, lanes 4-8, to that in Fig. 6, lane 3). Thus the tyramine-aided half-site strand cleavage and exchange mediated by a monomer of Flp(Y343F) is insensitive to challenge by free DNA, free protein, or DNA-associated protein. We conclude that the bound Flp(Y343F) monomer stays attached to half-site through the two chemical steps of the reaction and does not dissociate from it in between. In the results reported here, we have used a half-site substrate associated with a single monomer of a Flp variant lacking the active site tyrosine to explore the mechanism of recombination. We show that a single monomer can provide the active site for the strand cleavage and strand joining steps that yield one recombinant DNA strand. The cleavage step is not followed by dissociation of the recombinase monomer and the assembly of strand joining pocket from a second recombinase monomer. Thus a Flp monomer can orient the scissile phosphodiester in DNA for attack by the phenolate nucleophile derived in trans (either from Tyr-343 of a second Flp monomer during the normal reaction or from tyramine in the simulated reaction). The same monomer can then orient the phosphodiester formed between DNA and tyrosine (or tyramine) during cleavage for attack in trans by the nucleophile derived from the 5′-hydroxyl of the Flp-cleaved DNA. Our current data therefore argue against the scheme proposed in Fig. 1B. They strongly support the “cis activation/trans nucleophilic attack” paradigm for recombination (Lee and Jayaram, 1993), in which the target phosphodiesters are oriented in cis by Flp bound next to them, and reactive nucleophiles are then supplied in trans for executing the chemical steps. Results from the present study are consistent with and extend previous analyses of half-site reactions using step arrest Flp variants (Chen et al., 1992a; Pan et al., 1993). However, the earlier studies did not rigorously establish that the two chemical steps of a single recombination event can be carried out by one and the same Flp monomer. The half-site strand transfer reaction is mechanistically faithful to the normal full site reaction. The rules for assembling the Flp active site by sharing of catalytic residues between protein monomers are the same in half-sites and in full sites (Whang et al., 1994). The trans mode of DNA cleavage initially demonstrated in half-sites (Chen et al., 1992a; Yang and Jayaram, 1994) holds true for full sites as well (Lee et al., 1994). Similarly, the sensitivity of the strand joining step to adjacent base complementarity within the spacer segment is identical in half-sites and in full sites (Lee and Jayaram, 1995). We feel justified, therefore, in extrapolating the half-site results into a simple mechanistic scheme for the apparently complex phosphoryl transfers required to complete recombination between two double-stranded DNA partners. The reaction follows the path presented in Fig. 1A. In this model, the two Flp monomers to the left make the principal active site contributions in cis for the cleavage/joining reactions that generate the Holliday intermediate, and they utilize the chemical reactivity of appropriate nucleophiles derived in trans. In repeating the phosphoryl transfer steps at the other end of the spacer to resolve the Holliday junction, the two Flp monomers to the right take over the catalytic functions, effectively switching roles with their left partners. We propose that this role reversal is associated with an isomerization step, perhaps involving some branch migration of the Holliday junction. We suggest that the molecular dynamics associated with this event operate on the recombination complex as a whole with no need for dissociation of recombinase monomers from their sites of occupancy. The figure is not meant to imply that the reaction takes place with a defined order of strand exchanges, initiated at the left and terminated at the right. In principle, the reaction could well be initiated at the right and terminated at the left. Thus, although there is functional symmetry of the four Flp monomers in the context of a complete recombination event, there is clear asymmetry between pairs of Flp monomers during each of the two cleavage/exchange reactions. How this asymmetry is imparted to the system remains an interesting and open question. If a single Flp protomer has the potential for providing the active sites for strand cleavage and strand joining, how are they accommodated within the protein structure? Given the structural constraints of DNA, the two transesterification steps that complete one cleavage/joining event must take place in close proximity. Hence, if the reactions are accomplished by two active sites that are physically removed from each other, there must be significant protein movement relative to DNA to disengage the cleavage pocket and engage the joining pocket. On the other hand, given the mechanistic similarity of strand cleavage and strand joining, a single, composite active site may carry out the breakage and union reactions. We favor the single active site hypothesis. It is conceptually simple and is easily accommodated by the cis activation/trans nucleophilic attack model. It is also consistent with the step arrest phenotypes of Flp variants altered at the invariant integrase family residues (Arg-191, His-305, Arg-308, and Tyr-343). Two of the tetrad residues, Arg-191 and Arg-308, contribute to strand cleavage as well as strand joining; both reactions are abolished in the absence of either of the two residues (Parsons et al., 1988, 1990; Lee et al., 1992; Yang and Jayaram, 1994). On the other hand, Tyr-343 is required only to provide the nucleophile for cleavage (Evans et al., 1990); it is dispensable in the joining reaction (Pan and Sadowski, 1992; Lee and Jayaram, 1993). Similarly, His-305 is not essential for cleavage in full sites (Parsons et al., 1988), but it is essential for joining in full sites and half-sites (Parsons et al., 1988; Lee and Jayaram, 1993; Pan et al., 1993; Yang and Jayaram, 1994). However, contrary to the expectation from full site assays, little or no half-site cleavage occurs in the absence of His-305. A satisfactory explanation for this apparent contradiction may have to wait till more is known about the structures of Flp-half-site and Flp-full site complexes. It is possible that the requirement of His-305 at the cleavage step may be fulfilled by another residue in the full site complex, but not in the half-site complex. Nevertheless, the identification of some catalytic residues that are common to the cleavage and strand transfer steps (Arg-191 and Arg-308), and of others that are unique to each of the two steps (Tyr-343 for cleavage and perhaps His-305 for joining) blends nicely with the idea of one composite active site. Within this active site, the required conformational flexure to switch from the cleavage mode to the joining mode may be minimal and may occur concomitant to the cleavage reaction itself. It is likely that the chemical nature and relative dispositions of the target diester (the scissile DNA phosphodiester or the 3′-phosphotyrosyl bond) and of the active nucleophile (Tyr-343 or 5′-hydroxyl group) may stabilize the functional configuration of the strand cleavage and joining pockets via induced fit. The observation that a Flp monomer can bind to a precleaved substrate and mediate strand transfer within it (Pan and Sadowski, 1992; Lee and Jayaram, 1993) would be consistent with this notion. In summary, by using a combination of the half-site substrate, step-arrest Flp mutants, and an active site nucleophile mimic, we have provided a model that assigns functional roles to individual recombinase monomers during the chemical steps involved in one round of recombination. The binding reactions reported here using two DNA substrates of different lengths and Flp(Y343F) or, conversely, a single DNA substrate and two Flp(Y343F) variants of different molecular masses are consistent with the interpretation that the DNA-protein complexes identified by gel electrophoresis have a molar stoichiometry of no more than one Flp monomer per Flp binding element on the DNA. We have confirmed this inference by a direct estimation of the protein and DNA contents of these complexes by using a method described by Mack et al.(1992) with some modifications. In our assays we estimated protein amounts by digital analysis of bands stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue rather than by the Western blot method employed by Mack et al.(1992). Binding reactions were done with a full site or a half-site DNA substrate (Fig. 7) in which one strand was end-labeled with 32P. Each substrate was prepared by mixing 0.5 pmol of labeled plus 199.5 pmol unlabeled top strand (assuming one A260 unit = 33 μg/ml single-stranded DNA) with a 3-fold excess (600 pmol) of the bottom strand in the hybridization medium. Under these conditions, virtually all of the single strand was converted to the double-stranded form. All DNA estimates were based on the specific radioactivity of the labeled strand of the input substrate. Concentration of Flp(Y343F) in the preparation used in the binding assays was estimated using a molar extinction coefficient, E280 = 6.0 × 104M-1 cm-1, derived by adding the tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan extinctions from the predicted amino acid composition of Flp. The intensities of the Coomassie Brilliant Blue-stained bands obtained after SDS-polyacrylamide electrophoresis of a set of Flp(Y343F) standards produced a linear curve in the concentration range relevant to the test samples (see Figure 7:, Figure 8:). The reliability of this method of protein estimation was verified by applying it to a >95% pure preparation of the transposase protein of phage Mu (gift from J-Y. Yang and R. M. Harshey), whose theoretical molar extinction coefficient E280 was calculated as = 1.2 × 105M-1 cm-1 (data not shown).Figure 8:Molar stoichiometry of Flp(Y343F) to Flp binding element in HS I and C IIF. The standard graphs for DNA and protein were prepared from digital image analysis of the data shown in Fig. 7A. The protein and DNA contents within HS I and C IIF were derived by using these graphs. The Flp(Y343F)-DNA stoichiometry calculated for each binding reaction is tabulated. The mean value from the six estimates together with the standard deviation is shown.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload (PPT) After incubating the DNA substrate and Flp(Y343F) under conditions that convert over 50% of the half-site and full site into the complexes HS I and C IIF (see Fig. 2), respectively, the reactions were fractionated in native polyacrylamide gels. The complexes HS I and C IIF were identified by autoradiography. The gel slices corresponding to them were carefully excised, placed in the wells of 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels, and refractionated by electrophoresis at approximately 8 V/cm to separate the protein and DNA components (Laemmli, 1970). Mixtures of standard aliquots of Flp(Y343F) and the DNA substrate (the half-site or the full site) were fractionated simultaneously on identical gels to provide the reference for DNA and protein quantitation. After the run, the gels were cut into DNA and protein sections (the DNA migrates well ahead of the protein during electrophoresis). The gel sections containing protein were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue and photographed, whereas those containing DNA were dried and subjected to autoradiography. The protein and DNA bands were quantitated from the negatives and x-ray films, respectively, using Image 1.41 software (NIH). The protein and DNA profiles obtained upon fractionation of the isolated HS I and C IIF complexes formed by the half-site and full site substrates, respectively, are shown in Fig. 7, A and B (top). The corresponding patterns for the standard DNA/protein mixtures are also displayed (Fig. 7, A and B, bottom). The data from Fig. 7 are quantitatively represented in Fig. 8. The average molar ratio of Flp(Y343F) to the half-site (one Flp binding element) in the HS I complex derived from six independent binding reactions was 0.73 + 0.09. The equivalent ratio for the full site (two Flp binding elements) in the C IIF complex was 1.95 + 0.16. These values are most consistent with the interpretation that, in both HS I and C IIF, one monomer of Flp(Y343F) is present per one Flp binding element. In summary, we have shown by direct protein and DNA measurements that there is a one to one association between Flp(Y343F) and the DNA element to which it binds. Combined with our demonstration that the HS I complex formed by Flp(Y343F) and trapped within polyacrylamide can be induced to undergo the chemistry of recombination by providing tyramine (the nucleophile mimic of the missing tyrosine; see Fig. 4), this result strongly supports the hypothesis that the protein unit that orients the phosphodiester for nucleophilic attack during strand cleavage is indeed a monomer of Flp. Thus one round of recombination between two DNA partners, requiring four strand breakage/joining events, is likely mediated by a tetramer of DNA-bound Flp (as depicted in the model of Fig. 1A). It is unnecessary to invoke the possibility that additional interactions between substrate-associated Flp and Flp from solution may contribute to the reaction."
https://openalex.org/W2088001612,"We exploited the mechanism underlying thrombin receptor activation to develop a novel screening method to identify peptide agonists. The thrombin receptor is activated by limited proteolysis of its amino-terminal exodomain. Thrombin cleaves this domain to unmask a new amino terminus, which then functions as a tethered peptide agonist, binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to trigger signaling. The thrombin receptor's amino-terminal exodomain can also donate the tethered agonist intermolecularly to activate nearby thrombin receptors.

We developed an expression cloning method for identifying novel peptide agonists based on the thrombin receptor's activation mechanism. Thrombin cleaves its receptor's amino-terminal exodomain to unmask a new amino terminus, which then functions as a tethered peptide agonist, binding intramolecularly to the body of the receptor to trigger signaling(1Vu T.-K.H.

Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The thrombin receptor's amino-terminal exodomain can also donate the tethered agonist intermolecularly to activate nearby thrombin receptors(2Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The intermolecular liganding mode is less efficient than the intramolecular mode and presumably requires greater intrinsic activity of the tethered ligand sequence itself(2Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Accordingly, we utilized the ability of the thrombin receptor's amino-terminal exodomain to donate its tethered ligand intermolecularly to search for new peptide agonists. We constructed a “tethered ligand library,” which displayed random pentapeptides in place of the native tethered ligand in the thrombin receptor's amino-terminal exodomain and co-expressed this library together with target receptors in Xenopus oocytes. Clones that conferred thrombin-dependent signaling by intermolecular ligation of the target receptor were isolated by sib selection. We utilized this technique to identify a clone that activated the thrombin receptor itself and a second that activated the formyl peptide receptor. Peptides mimicking the tethered ligand sequences of these clones, GFIYF for thrombin receptor agonist and MMWLL for formyl peptide receptor, were effective agonists for their respective targets. The expected and unexpected features of these agonists are discussed. The tethered ligand library method thus provided an approach for searching a diverse group of peptide sequences for agonist activity. In addition to identifying novel peptide agonists for targets of pharmacological interest, this method might be used to discover agonists for orphan receptors. The ease with which agonists were “evolved” in this system suggests a possible evolutionary path from peptide to protease-activated receptors. Xenopus oocytes were harvested, microinjected with cRNAs, and cultured as previously described(1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar). Agonist-induced responses were assessed as 45Ca release(1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar). The library was constructed as follows. A construct dubbed ATE-CD8 encoding the thrombin receptor's amino-terminal exodomain (ATE), 1The abbreviation used is: ATEamino-terminal exodomain. fused to the transmembrane domain of CD8, was used to display the receptor's amino-terminal exodomain on the cell surface(2Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Surface expression of the encoded protein and its cleavage by thrombin was verified as the presence and thrombin-dependent loss of an epitope placed amino to the thrombin cleavage site(2Chen J.

Chem. 1995; : 16435-16440Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (67) Google Scholar). A library of such molecules in which the receptor's agonist peptide domain SFLLR was replaced by random pentapeptides was constructed as follows. ATE-CD8 was modified to introduce paired BstXI sites flanking the agonist peptide domain so that a “BstXI cassette” could later be inserted to make the library(5Aruffo A. Seed B. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 8573-8577Crossref PubMed Scopus (682) Google Scholar, 6Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A. Methods Enzymol. 1987; 154: 367-382Crossref PubMed Scopus (4560) Google Scholar). An in frame nonsense mutation was inserted between these sites to ensure premature termination of translation of any non-recombinant ATE-CD8 molecules occurring in the library. The modified ATE-CD8 was inserted into pBLOG between Xenopus globin mRNA 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequence and downstream of an SP6 RNA polymerase promoter. pBLOG was made by subcloning a 0.9-kilobase EcoRI-PstI fragment from pFROG (1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar) into the corresponding sites of pBluescript II SK- (Stratagene) in which the BstXI site had been destroyed. BstXI cassette inserts for the library were generated by annealing a pool of degenerate oligonucleotides 5′-GATCCCCGG(NNK)5AACCCCAATGATAAATATGAACCATT-3′, where N = A, C, G, or T in equimolar amounts and K = G or T in equimolar amounts with two complementary, flanking 13 mers 5′-CCGGGGATCTAAG-3′ and 5′-GTTCATATTTATC-3′(7Cwirla S.E. Peters E.A. Barrett R.W. Dower W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 6378-6382Crossref PubMed Scopus (854) Google Scholar). The annealed oligomers were then ligated into the new BstXI sites of the modified ATE-CD8 in pBLOG. Escherichia coli strain DH10B were electroporated with an aliquot of the resulting library and plated at a complexity of 4000/pool. Of 10 randomly picked clones that were sequenced(8Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52769) Google Scholar), 8 indeed encoded a wild-type ATE-CD8 sequence except for the 15 nucleotides encoding the random agonist pentapeptide; 2 had mutations probably arising during annealing or ligation. Thus, approximately 80% of the library encoded molecules that would display random pentapeptides at their amino termini upon cleavage by thrombin. The library was co-expressed with target receptors in Xenopus oocytes by co-injecting cRNAs (See Fig. 2). amino-terminal exodomain. Pools of the tethered ligand library each representing 4000 independent clones (Fig. 1) were co-expressed with a target thrombin receptor bearing the F43A loss of function mutation in its tethered ligand domain(2Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 9Vassallo Jr., R.R. Kieber-Emmons T. Cichowski K. Brass L.F. J. Biol.

Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). This receptor could be activated by free synthetic agonist peptide but, lacking its own functional tethered ligand, could not be activated by thrombin(2Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Signaling in response to thrombin in the co-expression system thus reflected intermolecular ligation of the target receptor by a member of the library. Of the first 9 pools tested, 3 clearly conferred thrombin-dependent signaling when co-expressed with the F43A receptor (Fig. 2). From the most active of these pools, a single clone that conferred signaling was isolated by sib selection. The predicted amino acid sequence of this clone's tethered ligand domain was GFIYF. A synthetic peptide mimicking this domain was nearly as effective as the SFLLR peptide, which mimics the native tethered ligand sequence (Fig. 3A). Moreover, a mutant thrombin receptor in which the GFIYF sequence replaced the native SFLLR sequence signaled as effectively as wild type receptor in response to thrombin (Fig. 3B). The sequence of this new agonist is striking in the context of known thrombin receptor agonist peptide sequences and structure-activity relationships (Table 1). The protonated amino group at the amino-terminal of all thrombin receptor peptide agonists (the group corresponding to that created by receptor cleavage) is critical for agonist function, and small neutral residues are preferred at agonist position 1. The conserved phenylalanine at position 2 is critical for agonist function(9Vassallo Jr., R.R. Kieber-Emmons T. Cichowski K. Brass L.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 6081-6085Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 10Scarborough R.M. Naughton M. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.-K.H. Wheaton V.I. Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 13146-13149Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Hydrophobic residues are preferred at positions 3 and 4. All of these features are captured in GFIYF. Moreover, the phenylalanine at position 5 in the GFIYF peptide is seen in the Xenopus thrombin receptor's tethered ligand sequence. Thus, tethered ligand library selection “evolved” an agonist that shares critical features with the known naturally occurring thrombin receptor tethered ligand sequences. A unique feature of the GFIYF agonist, however, is its lack of a basic residue. All of the known tethered ligand sequences sport an arginine at either position 3 or 5, raising the possibility that these arginines serve functions beyond receptor activation in the native receptor and its cellular context.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Can this technique be used to find agonists for receptors that are not naturally activated by a tethered ligand mechanism? To test this question, we co-expressed pools representing 10,000 independent tethered ligand library clones with a variety of potential targets: the 5HT1c(11Julius D. MacDermott A.B. Axel R.

A pool with agonist activity for the formyl peptide receptor was immediately identified even at this relatively low level of complexity. We subsequently screened 11 subpools of 800 independent clones each for activity at the formyl peptide receptor. The most active of these was serially subdivided, and a single cDNA that conferred thrombin-dependent signaling when co-expressed with the formyl peptide receptor was identified by sib selection. The tethered ligand sequence in this clone was MMWLL. A synthetic peptide mimicking this domain was nearly as active as the classical formyl peptide receptor agonist, fMLF (formyl-Met-Leu-Phe) (Fig. 4). The amino-terminal methionine and the hydrophobic nature of the MMWLL sequence was consistent with published structure activity studies for formyl peptide receptor agonists(17Freer R. Day A. Radding J. Schiffmann E. Aswanikumar S. Showell H. Becker E. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2404-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 18Freer R. Day A. Muthukumaraswamy N. Pinon D. Wu A. Showell H. Becker E. Biochemistry. 1982; 21: 257-263Crossref PubMed Scopus (141) Google Scholar). However, the level of activity shown by the MMWLL peptide was surprising given its lack of an amino-terminal formyl group. The formyl group of fMLF is essential for significant biological activity(17Freer R. Day A. Radding J. Schiffmann E. Aswanikumar S. Showell H. Becker E. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 2404-2410Crossref PubMed Scopus (155) Google Scholar, 19Schiffmann E. Corcoran B.A. Wahl S.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1975; 72: 1059-1062Crossref PubMed Scopus (727) Google Scholar), and unformylated MLF was indeed at least 1000-fold less active than fMLF in this system. Addition of an N-formyl group to MMWLL yielded a 1000-fold increase in the potency of this new agonist, and fMMWLL agonist was reproducibly more potent than fMLF itself (Fig. 4). Thus, the amino-terminal formyl group probably provides new interactions important for activating the formyl peptide receptor, but MMWLL contains sufficient information by itself to function as an agonist. These data suggest that the formyl peptide receptor, thought to be important for mediating chemotaxis toward N-formylated bacterial proteins, remains competent to respond to certain unformylated peptides and may have evolved from a pre-existing peptide receptor. Whether endogenous unformylated peptide agonists for this receptor exist is unknown. The ease with which agonists were identified using the tethered ligand library prompts speculation regarding the evolutionary origin of protease-activated receptors such as the thrombin receptor and protease-activated receptor 2(20Nystedt S. Emilsson K. Wahlestedt C. Sundelin J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9208-9212Crossref PubMed Scopus (833) Google Scholar). Of 3.2 × 106 possible tethered ligand sequences in the library, only 36,000 were screened to find a thrombin receptor agonist and 10,000 to find a formyl peptide receptor agonist. From the prevalence of positive pools in the library, we estimate that at least 1 in 10,000 tethered ligand sequences had some agonist activity at the thrombin receptor or the fMLF receptor. The intermolecular liganding relied upon in these screens is much less efficient than the intramolecular liganding that mediates activation of native protease receptors(2Chen J. Ishii M. Wang L. Ishii K. Coughlin S.R. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 16041-16045Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Moreover, the tethered ligand in the intact receptor is quite tolerant of amino acid substitutions; alanine substitution at agonist positions 3, 4, and 5 cause loss of function in the free agonist peptide but not the intact receptor(1Vu T.-K.H. Hung D.T. Wheaton V.I. Coughlin S.R. Cell. 1991; 64: 1057-1068Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (2680) Google Scholar, 10Scarborough R.M. Naughton M. Teng W. Hung D.T. Rose J. Vu T.-K.H.

Turck C.W. Coughlin S.R. Fenton J. Biochemistry. 1994; 33: 3266-3279Crossref PubMed Scopus (166) Google Scholar). Because of the kinetic advantages conferred by tethering, sequences capable of functioning as tethered ligands may have appeared relatively frequently in the amino-terminal exodomain of peptide receptors during their evolution. An early protease-activated receptor may thus have arisen from a pre-existing peptide receptor when mutation created a protease cleavage site amino-terminal to a potential tethered ligand sequence. In summary, the tethered ligand library method has identified new agonists for two “peptide” receptors. The new agonists revealed both expected and unexpected features. The tethering feature of this method provides an advantage over use of free peptides for identifying low affinity leads, and use of signaling as a readout selects for agonists over antagonists. The extent to which this technique can be applied to other G protein-coupled receptors and signaling molecules remains to be determined. Adaptation of this approach to yeast (22King K. Dohlman H.G. Thorner J. Caron M.G. Lefkowitz R.J. Science. 1990; 250: 121-123Crossref PubMed Scopus (189) Google Scholar) or mammalian cell systems (23Spengler D. Waeber C. Pantaloni C. Holsboer F. Bockaert J.

https://openalex.org/W2093711887,"The human adenovirus E1A 243R protein (243 residues) transcriptionally represses a set of cellular genes that regulate cellular growth and differentiation. We describe two lines of evidence that E1A repression does not require cellular protein synthesis but instead involves direct interaction with a cellular protein(s). First, E1A 243R protein represses an E1A-repressible promoter in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis, as shown by cell microinjection-in situ hybridization. Second, E1A 243R protein strongly represses transcription in vitro from promoters of the E1A-repressible genes, human collagenase, and rat insulin type II. Repression in vitro is promoter-specific, and an E1A polypeptide containing only the N-terminal 80 residues is sufficient for strong repression both in vivo and in vitro. By use of a series of E1A 1-80 deletion proteins, the E1A repression function was found to require two E1A sequence elements, one within the nonconserved E1A N terminus, and the second within a portion of conserved region 1 (40-80). These domains have been reported to possess binding sites for several cellular transcription regulators, including p300, Dr1, YY1, and the TBP subunit of TFIID. The in vitro transcription-repression system described here provides a powerful tool for the further analysis of molecular mechanism and the possible role of these cellular factors.

First, E1A 243R protein represses an E1A-repressible promoter in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis, as shown by cell microinjection-in situ hybridization. Second, E1A 243R protein strongly represses transcription in vitro from promoters of the E1A-repressible genes, human collagenase, and rat insulin type II. Repression in vitro is promoter-specific, and an E1A polypeptide containing only the N-terminal 80 residues is sufficient for strong repression both in vivo and in vitro. By use of a series of E1A 1-80 deletion proteins, the E1A repression function was found to require two E1A sequence elements, one within the nonconserved E1A N terminus, and the second within a portion of conserved region 1 (40-80). These domains have been reported to possess binding sites for several cellular transcription regulators, including p300, Dr1, YY1, and the TBP subunit of TFIID. The in vitro transcription-repression system described here provides a powerful tool for the further analysis of molecular mechanism and the possible role of these cellular factors.

E1A encodes two multifunctional regulatory proteins of 243 and 289 amino acid residues (243R and 289R). The E1A proteins are involved in diverse cellular functions, including transcriptional activation, transcriptional repression, induction of cellular DNA synthesis, cell immortalization, cell transformation, as well as inhibition of metastasis and of cell differentiation (for reviews, see (1Chinnadurai G.

E1A 243R differs from E1A 289R only by conserved region 3 (CR3), a 46-amino acid domain unique to 289R. E1A is the first viral gene expressed during productive infection of permissive human cells and is required to activate transcriptionally early viral genes. CR3 is essential (6Glenn G.M.

The 243R protein encodes domains required for the growth regulatory functions of E1A. An intriguing function of 243R is its ability to repress transcriptionally a set of cellular genes involved in growth regulation and differentiation(13Hen R. Borrelli E. Chambon P.

How the E1A repression function interfaces with its growth regulatory properties is not known. Furthermore, the molecular mechanism of transcriptional repression is not understood. Elucidation of mechanism would inform our understanding of the biological roles of E1A transcriptional repression. One can imagine several mechanisms by which E1A might repress the activity of a target gene (for review, see (21Herschbach B.M. Johnson A.D. Annu. Rev. Cell Biol. 1993; 9: 479-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (98) Google Scholar)). For example, E1A could (i) bind to promoter DNA and block access by a transcriptional activator; (ii) sequester an essential transcriptional factor through direct protein-protein interaction; or (iii) induce the de novo synthesis of a cellular repressor. In this report, we show by cell microinjection experiments that E1A repression does not require the de novo synthesis of cellular proteins. This result and the fact that E1A does not bind specifically promoter DNA(22Ferguson B. Krippl B. Andrisani O. Jones N. Westphal H. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar, 23Chatterjee P.K. Bruner M. Flint S.J. Harter M.L. EMBO J. 1988; 7: 835-841Crossref PubMed Scopus (43) Google Scholar, 24Zu Y.-L.

In support of this prediction, we were able to establish in vitro transcription of E1A-repressible promoters and to demonstrate repression by purified E1A polypeptides. By use of the in vitro repression assay and a series of E1A deletion polypeptides, the sequence requirements for transcriptional repression of the human interstitial collagenase and rat insulin II promoters were mapped to two small E1A domains. Plasmids used as templates for in vitro transcription include the adenovirus type 2 major late promoter-chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) (pMLPCAT)(25Dery C.V. Herrmann C.H. Mathews M.B.

Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar), were used in microinjection assays. Plasmids encoding E1A 1-80, E1A 1-80Δ4-25, E1A 1-80Δ26-35, E1A 1-80Δ30-49, E1A 1-80Δ70-80, and E1A 1-80Δ61-69 were constructed by polymerase chain reaction using as templates pLE2, pdl1101, pdl1102, pdl1103, pdl1105, and pdl1141, respectively(10Jelsma T.N. Howe J. Mymryk J.S. Evelegh C.M. Cunniff N.F.A. Bayley S.T. Virology. 1989; 171: 120-130Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar). Primer 1 and primer 2 were used for E1A 1-80, E1A 1-80Δ26-35, E1A 1-80Δ30-49, and E1A 1-80 Δ61-69; primer 3 and primer 2 were used for E1A 1-80Δ4-25; and primer 1 and primer 4 were used for E1A 1-80Δ70-80. The E1A 243R plasmid was polymerase chain reaction-synthesized using as template pUC18/12S (a gift of G. Chinnadurai) with primer 1 and primer 5. Primer sequences are as follows: primer 1, 5′-CCCGGATCCATGAGACATATTATC-3′; primer 2, 5′-CCCAGATCTTAAGTCAATCCCTTC-3′; primer 3, 5′-CCCGGATCCATGAGACATGAGGTA-3′; primer 4, 5′-CCCAGATCTAGAGTCGGGAAAAATC-3′; primer 5, 5′-ACTAGATCTTGGCCTGGGGCG-3′. Polymerase chain reaction products were digested with BamHI and BglII and then cloned into the BamHI and BglII sites of pQE-12 (QIAGEN). All E1A expression plasmids were sequenced to confirm primary structure. These constructs express the E1A polypeptides fused to six histidine residues at the C terminus. Biologically active six-His-tagged E1A 243R and E1A 1-80 deletion polypeptides used for cell microinjection and for in vitro transcription repression were purified by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography as recommended by QIAGEN. E1A proteins were eluted with 6 M guanidine HCl/PBS/10 mM dithiothreitol, followed by stepwise renaturation in a 3,000 molecular weight cut-off dialysis bag (Spectra/Por) by halving the guanidine HCl concentration at 2-3-h intervals until below 250 mM. Dialysis was continued against PBS/5 mM dithiothreitol, and proteins were concentrated with a Centriprep-3 (Amicon). The E1A 243R and 289R proteins, used only for microinjection studies, were prepared by expression from pAS1-E1A410 (289R) and pAS1-E1A412 (243R) and purified by ion-exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel(22Ferguson B. Krippl B. Andrisani O. Jones N. Westphal H. Rosenberg M. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1985; 5: 2653-2661Crossref PubMed Scopus (86) Google Scholar). Microinjection was performed essentially as described previously(11Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). A549 and HeLa cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal calf serum on scored 22-mm square coverslips in 35-mm plastic Petri dishes. For measurements of transcription repression, the SV40 T antigen expressing plasmid, p1-11, was injected at 10 μg/ml with or without E1A protein or plasmid into the nuclei of 100-200 cells. Injection mixtures contained 1% tetramethylrhodamine dextran (Mr 70,000, Molecular Probes Inc.), which served as marker for injected cells. Cells were fixed in 3.8% paraformaldehyde/PBS for 10 min, permeabilized in methanol (−20°C) for 5 min, and rehydrated in PBS. SV40 T antigen synthesis was measured by indirect immunofluorescence using monoclonal antibody to T antigen (1:200, Ab-2, Oncogene Science) as primary antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Cappel) as secondary antibody. Coverslips were scored microscopically by double label immunofluorescence to identify injected cells (rhodamine) and cells expressing T antigen (FITC). To determine whether protein synthesis was necessary for E1A repression, pSV2CAT was injected with or without E1A 243R protein or plasmid (pSP6dl1500) (11Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar) as described in the legend to Table 1. Cells were incubated in the presence or absence of cycloheximide or anisomycin for 6 h after injection(12Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Pusztai R. Symington J.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 921-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). The synthesis of CAT RNA was measured by in situ hybridization (12Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Pusztai R. Symington J.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 921-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar, 30Lawrence J.B. Singer R.H. Cell. 1986; 45: 407-415Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (452) Google Scholar), using as probe CAT antisense RNA labeled with [35S]CTP. After post-hybridization washes, cells on coverslips were dehydrated in ethanol, dried, mounted on microscope slides, and dipped in Kodak NTB-2 emulsion. Slides were developed after 2 days of exposure in the dark, and the percentage of microinjected cells that hybridized with the CAT DNA probe was scored by phase microscopy. Positive cells are those with at least twice as many photographic grains (usually too many to count) as the background (generally 30-50 grains).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab HeLa cell nuclear extracts were prepared essentially as described previously (31Dignam J.D. Lebovitz R.M. Roeder R.G. Nucleic Acids Res. 1983; 11: 1475-1489Crossref PubMed Scopus (9149) Google Scholar) except that nuclei were extracted with a final KCl concentration of 300 mM(32Loewenstein P.M. Green M. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 21504-21508Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 33Song C.-Z. Loewenstein P.M. Green M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9357-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Transcription reaction mixtures (25 μl) contained 12 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 4 mM creatine phosphate, 0.1 mM EDTA, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.7 mM dithiothreitol, 60-70 mM KCl, 15 mM NaCl, 8% glycerol, 500 μM ATP, CTP, GTP, and UTP, 20 units of placental RNase inhibitor (Boehringer Mannheim), 500 ng of template DNA, and 40-80 μg of nuclear extract protein. Template DNA was isolated using a QIAGEN kit and further purified by phenol extraction. E1A proteins and deletion polypeptides in PBS were added to reaction mixtures as indicated. For reactions in which E1A was omitted, an equal volume of PBS was added. Incubation was for 60 min at 30°C. RNA transcripts were isolated, and primer extension analysis was performed using a 5′-end labeled 31-mer CAT primer(33Song C.-Z. Loewenstein P.M. Green M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 9357-9361Crossref PubMed Scopus (20) Google Scholar). Primer-extension products were analyzed by denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by autoradiography after overnight (12-h) exposure. Our initial goal was to determine whether protein synthesis is required for E1A repression. The experimental approach is based on a cell microinjection assay showing that transcriptional activation by E1A 289R occurs in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis (12Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Pusztai R. Symington J.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 921-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). We first developed a cell microinjection assay for transcriptional repression by E1A proteins. The reporter plasmid p1-11, encoding the SV40 T antigen, was coinjected into the nuclei of cells with an E1A protein or expression plasmid. SV40 T antigen synthesis was scored by immunofluorescence. To study E1A sequence requirements for repression, we expressed in Escherichia coli E1A 243R, E1A 1-80, and the E1A 1-80 deletion polypeptides shown in Fig. 1A. These recombinant E1A polypeptides were purified to near homogeneity as shown by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1B). Various levels of E1A proteins were coinjected with p1-11 into human A549 cells and T antigen-synthesizing cells identified 18 h later by immunofluorescence (Fig. 2A). E1A 243R repressed T antigen synthesis, whereas E1A 289R was much less efficient. Similar results were obtained by coinjection with plasmids encoding the 243R protein (pSP6dl1500) and the 289R protein (pSP6pm975) (data not shown). Thus, the activity of each recombinant E1A protein in the cell microinjection assay reflects the repression function of the corresponding gene. The higher degree of repression by the E1A 12S gene product compared with that of the 13S product is in agreement with studies by Ad infection(11Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). Presumably the activation region, CR3, in the E1A 13S product interferes with the function of the repression domain(s)(11Lillie J.W. Loewenstein P.M. Green M.R. Green M. Cell. 1987; 50: 1091-1100Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (151) Google Scholar). HeLa cells on coverslips were coinjected with p1-11 and E1A 243R protein or E1A 243R expression plasmid, pSP6dl1500. Coverslips were fixed at different times after microinjection, and the number of cells expressing T antigen was determined by indirect immunofluorescence. When p1-11 alone was injected, T antigen was detected in about 30% of cells at 3 h, and reached a plateau of 80-90% at about 10 h (Fig. 2B). When pSP6dl1500 was coinjected with p1-11, little or no T antigen was detected at 6-7 h, and less than 15% of cells expressed T antigen at 10 h, corresponding to about 80% repression (Fig. 2B). Coinjection with the E1A 243R protein repressed T antigen synthesis in 80-100% of cells up to 7 h postinjection, but only in 50-60% thereafter, probably reflecting intracellular degradation of injected 243R protein (Fig. 2B). Based on these results, subsequent microinjection experiments were assayed at ~6 h after injection of E1A polypeptide. Several studies have implicated a requirement for the E1A N-terminal region and CR1 for transcriptional repression (for review, see (5Bayley S.T. Mymryk J.S. Int. J. Oncol. 1994; 5: 425-444PubMed Google Scholar)). We therefore tested the ability of the E1A 1-80 polypeptide to repress transcription. Cells were coinjected with p1-11, E1A 1-80 polypeptide, and rhodamine-conjugated dextran (to serve as a marker for microinjected cells) and analyzed by double-label immunofluorescence (Fig. 2C). Fields in the left-handpanels were visualized through FITC filters, which display cells that synthesize T Ag, whereas identical fields in the right-handpanels were visualized with rhodamine filters, which show cells that are microinjected (panels under Marker). The majority of cells (80-90%) injected with p1-11 alone synthesized T Ag (panelA), whereas those coinjected with E1A 1-80 were blocked in T antigen synthesis (80-90% repression in several experiments) (panelC). The sequence specificity of E1A 1-80 in transcriptional repression is demonstrated by the inability of the deletion polypeptide, E1A 1-80Δ4-25, to repress T antigen synthesis (panelE). The ability of the E1A 243R protein to repress transcription in microinjected cells permits the experimental determination of whether cellular protein synthesis is required for E1A repression. Cells were pretreated for 30 min with the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide or anisomycin, coinjected with pSV2CAT and E1A 243R protein, and incubated in the presence of inhibitor for 6 h. Under these conditions, greater than 90% of protein synthesis is blocked (12Green M. Loewenstein P.M. Pusztai R. Symington J.S. Cell. 1988; 53: 921-926Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Expression from the SV40 early promoter was measured by in situ hybridization for CAT-specific RNA using as probe 35S-labeled CAT antisense RNA. As control for the efficacy of protein synthesis inhibition, the E1A 12S plasmid, pSP6dl1500, was coinjected with pSV2CAT into drug treated cells. Repression by pSP6dl1500 should be substantially reduced in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor because E1A protein synthesis would be substantially reduced. When pSP6dl1500 and pSV2CAT were coinjected, between 77 and 84% repression of CAT expression was observed in the absence of inhibitor, but only 20% inhibition when cells were treated with cycloheximide (Table 1, part A) and 0% when cells were treated with the more stringent inhibitor, anisomycin (Table 1, part B). Thus protein synthesis appears to be substantially blocked by these agents. By contrast, repression by E1A 243R protein was only slightly reduced by cycloheximide in HeLa cells (78-63%, Table 1, part A) and even less by the more effective inhibitor, anisomycin (69-64%, Table 1, part B); the small decrease in E1A repression in the presence of inhibitor may reflect some cell toxicity of these drugs. Our results using two different inhibitors and two cell lines support the conclusion that repression by E1A does not require de novo protein synthesis. The results of cell microinjection predict that E1A repression should be possible in a cell-free transcription extract. To test this prediction, we optimized conditions for in vitro transcription of the collagenase and insulin II promoters that have been reported to be repressible by E1A in vivo(14Stein R.W. Ziff E.B. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1987; 7: 1164-1170Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar, 26Frisch S.M. Reich R. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Martin G. Goldberg G.I.

Cell. 1990; 62: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) and then determined whether purified E1A proteins and polypeptides would repress transcription in vitro. The plasmid, pCL-CAT3, contains a 3.8-kilobase fragment from the 5′-flanking portion of the collagenase gene to nucleotide +37 fused to the CAT gene(26Frisch S.M. Reich R. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Martin G. Goldberg G.I. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 75-83PubMed Google Scholar). Transcription was measured by primer extension analysis with an oligomer complementary to the CAT mRNA sequence and yielded a correctly initiated product. Clear repression was seen with 500 ng of E1A 243R protein, and the signal was reduced to background levels with 1000 ng (data not shown). Because E1A 1-80 polypeptide strongly inhibited expression of the SV40 promoter in the cell microinjection assay (Fig. 2C), we determined whether it is sufficient to repress transcription of the collagenase promoter in vitro. Different levels of polypeptide were tested, and as shown in Fig. 3A, strong repression was seen with 50 ng of E1A 1-80. The rat insulin II plasmid pICE-CAT, which contains the promoter sequence from −100 to +8 fused to the CAT gene(35Stein R.W. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4531-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar), was analyzed next. E1A 1-80 represses pICE-CAT in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B). Striking repression was obtained with as little as 50 ng of E1A 1-80. As shown above, the collagenase and insulin II promoters, which are repressed by E1A in vivo are repressed in vitro by the E1A 1-80 polypeptide. E1A 1-80 contains only the N-terminal nonconserved region and CR1. To map the regions within E1A 1-80 essential for its repression function, E1A 1-80 polypeptides containing deletions of amino acid residues 4-25, 26-35, 30-49, 48-60, and 70-80 (see Fig. 1A) were expressed in E. coli, purified, and tested for repression of transcription in vitro. E1A repression of pICE-CAT requires residues within 4-25 and 48-60 since only deletion of these sequences inactivated the E1A 1-80 repression function (Fig. 4). E1A sequences within residues 30-49 and 70-80 are not required; E1A 1-80 polypeptides deleted in these sequences repressed as well as did wild-type E1A 1-80. E1A 1-80Δ26-35 is not necessary for repression activity (Fig. 4), although deletion appears to reduce repression slightly. We conclude that residues 4-25 and and 48-60 are essential for repression, whereas residues 30-49 and 70-80 are dispensable. Similar findings were obtained when the same experiments were done with pCL-CAT3 as template (data not shown). The above results indicate that two distinct E1A regions are required for repression in vitro. The first includes residues 4-25 within the N-terminal region, and the second includes residues 48-60 within CR1. To delineate the C-terminal boundary of the CR1 sequence needed for E1A repression, E1A 1-80Δ61-69 was constructed, purified, and tested for the ability to repress transcription in vitro relative to wild-type E1A 1-80. Dose-response measurements with 100-1500 ng of these two polypeptides showed no difference in repression of pICE-CAT (Fig. 5). Similar results were obtained with pCL-CAT3 (data not shown). Thus E1A residues 61-69 are not required for E1A repression in vitro. To summarize our findings, there are two “active sites” for E1A repression in vitro; they are located within residues ~1-25 and ~48-60. To investigate the promoter specificity of E1A repression in vitro, we determined whether E1A 1-80 can repress the transcription of the Ad major late promoter, the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter, and the human histone 4 (H4WT) promoter. As shown in Fig. 6, MLPCAT transcription was not repressed by E1A 1-80 or E1A 1-80 deletion polypeptides. Likewise, RSVCAT and H4WTCAT transcription were not repressed by 0.5-2 μg of E1A 1-80. Based on these results, we conclude that E1A repression in vitro is promoter specific. We describe here two lines of evidence that E1A repression does not require the induction of cellular protein synthesis. First, E1A 243R protein inhibits transcription of an E1A-repressible promoter in vivo in the presence of inhibitors of protein synthesis, as demonstrated by microinjection-in situ hybridization experiments. Second, the E1A 1-80 polypeptide strongly represses transcription in vitro of E1A-repressible promoters in a dose-dependent manner. These findings support the conclusion that E1A repression involves direct protein-protein interactions. Mutational analysis indicates that only two E1A amino acid sequence elements, the E1A N terminus (residues ~1-25) and the middle portion of CR1 (residues ~48-60), are required for transcriptional repression in vitro. Repression probably involves protein-protein interaction among these two putative E1A contact sites and a cellular factor(s). The N-terminal region is not conserved based upon primary sequence comparisons among different E1A serotypes(36Van Ormondt H. Maat J. Dijkema R. Gene (Amst.). 1980; 12: 63-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). However, conservation at a secondary or higher structural level may be important for the E1A repression function, as suggested by Gedrich et al.(37Gedrich R.W. Bayley S.T. Engel D.A. J. Virol. 1992; 66: 5849-5859Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), who noted a conserved three-amino-acid sequence termed ILE, which exists within a predicted α-helical structure. On the basis of the results reported here and our studies with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat promoter(38Song C.-Z. Loewenstein P.M. Green M. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 2907-2911Crossref PubMed Google Scholar), we propose that E1A repression of the two cellular and two viral promoters studied is mediated through a common mechanism. First, protein synthesis is not required for repression of these promoters. Second, E1A 1-80 is sufficient for repression. Third, deletion of amino acids 4-25 inactivates repression. Specific cis-acting upstream promoter elements are unlikely to be targets for E1A repression, since E1A-repressible promoters do not possess a common sequence motif. Deletion analysis of the SV40 enhancer has failed to identify a specific sequence required for E1A repression of the SV40 early promoter(39Rochette-Egly C. Fromental C. Chambon P. Genes & Dev. 1990; 4: 137-150Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar). Whereas the collagenase promoter contains a collTRE element (the consensus AP-1 binding site, TGAGTCA), which seems important for E1A repression(26Frisch S.M. Reich R. Collier I.E. Genrich L.T. Martin G. Goldberg G.I. Oncogene. 1990; 5: 75-83PubMed Google Scholar, 34Offringa R. Gebel S. Van Dan H. Timmers M. Smits A. Zwart R. Stein B. Bos J.L. Van der Eb A.J. Herrlich P. Cell. 1990; 62: 527-538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar), the rat insulin II promoter construct, pICE, contains neither a TRE element nor an SV40 enhancer element but possesses an enhancer element between nucleotides −100 and −91 (GCCATCTGC), which seems necessary to confer E1A repressibility (35Stein R.W. Whelan J. Mol. Cell. Biol. 1989; 9: 4531-4534Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar). These findings indicate that there are no specific upstream elements required for E1A repressibility. Because E1A repression appears to be mediated by a common mechanism that does not require de novo protein synthesis, E1A repression domains must interact with a specific cellular factor(s). Several factors have been reported that can bind sequences within the E1A N terminus. First is the p300/CBP family of putative coactivators (40Egan C. Jelsma T.N. Howe J.A. Bayley S.T. Ferguson B.

Dev. 1993; 3: 63-70Crossref PubMed Scopus (232) Google Scholar)). p300 has recently been cloned, and a mutant lacking the E1A binding region was shown to overcome partially E1A repression in transient expression analysis (48Eckner R. Ewen M.E. Newsome D. Gerdes M. DeCaprio J.A. Lawrence J.B. Livingston D.M. Genes & Dev. 1994; 8: 869-884Crossref PubMed Scopus (921) Google Scholar). Second, Dr1, a cellular transcriptional repressor that targets TFIID, can also bind the E1A N terminus(49Kraus V.B. Inostroza J.A. Yeung K. Reinberg D. Nevins J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 6279-6282Crossref PubMed Scopus (57) Google Scholar). Third, YY1, a multifunctional transcription factor that can either activate or repress transcription, depending upon its target, has recently been reported to bind E1A N-terminal sequences(50Lewis B.A. Tullis G. Seto E. Horikoshi N. Weinmann R. Shenk T. J. Virol. 1995; 69: 1628-1636Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Most recently, it has been shown that the TBP component of TFIID can both bind an E1A N-terminal sequence and overcome E1A repression in vitro(51Song C.-Z. Loewenstein P.M. Toth K. Green M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1995; (in press)Google Scholar). The finding that E1A 1-80 can target TBP should not be surprising since TFIID is central to transcriptional regulation (for review, see (52Goodrich J.A. Tjian R. Curr. Opin. Cell Biology. 1994; 6: 403-409Crossref PubMed Scopus (210) Google Scholar)). The in vitro transcription-repression system described here should be valuable for further studies defining the molecular mechanism(s) of E1A repression and the interaction of the E1A N-terminal domain(s) with cellular transcription regulators.

In addition, during the transition from a preinitiation complex to a stable elongation complex, the CTD becomes heavily phosphorylated. In this report, interactions involving the CTD have been examined by protein-protein cross-linking.As a prelude to the study of CTD interactions, the effect of recombinant CTD on in vitro transcription was examined. The presence of recombinant CTD inhibits in vitro transcription from both the DHFR and adenovirus 2 major late promoters, suggesting that the CTD is involved in essential interactions with a general transcription factor(s). Factors in the transcription extract that interact with the CTD were identified by protein-protein cross-linking.

Incubation of azido-modified 35S-labeled CTD with a HeLa transcription extract followed by ultraviolet irradiation results in the covalent cross-linking of the CTD to proteins in contact with the CTD at the time of irradiation. Subsequent incubation with phenylmercuric acetate results in the transfer of 35S from the CTD to the protein to which it was cross-linked. The two major photolabeled bands have a Mr of 34,000 and 74,000. The specificity of CTD interactions was demonstrated by a reduction in photolabeling in the presence of unmodified CTD or RNAP II containing an intact CTD (RNAP IIA) but not in the presence of a CTD-less RNAP II (RNAP IIB).

These studies utilize a simple plant system to provide a biochemical framework for understanding calcium regulation during development and have implications for understanding mechanisms of signal transduction in plants. Controlled changes in cellular calcium concentrations have been identified as important components of signal transduction pathways in plants. Cytoplasmic calcium concentrations are highly regulated; levels are modulated by coordinating passive fluxes and active transport across organellar and plasma membranes(1Evans D.E. Briars S.A.

Calcium acts as an intracellular messenger in hormone (cytokinin)-induced vegetative bud formation during the development of the filamentous protonemata (the young gametophore) in the moss Physcomitrella patens(15Saunders M.J. Hepler P.K. Planta. 1981; 152: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 16Saunders M.J. Hepler P.K. Science. 1982; 217: 943-945Crossref PubMed Scopus (92) Google Scholar, 17Saunders M.J.

Formation of vegetative buds is an integral part of the moss life cycle leading to the development of the mature gametophore which is essential for subsequent sexual reproduction. Cytokinin applied to moss cells causes profuse premature bud formation(19Brandes H. Kende H. Plant Physiol. 1968; 43: 827-837Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Localized increases in calcium take place after addition of cytokinin but precede the cytokinin-induced cell division (15Saunders M.J. Hepler P.K. Planta. 1981; 152: 272-281Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar, 18Hahm S.H. Saunders M.J. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). In moss cells not stimulated by cytokinin, cytoplasmic calcium levels (250 nM) are three orders of magnitude lower than levels in the external medium (0.1-1.0 mM)(18Hahm S.H. Saunders M.J. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). After addition of cytokinin, cytoplasmic calcium levels increase to 750 nM(18Hahm S.H. Saunders M.J. Cell Calcium. 1991; 12: 675-681Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Whole plant studies indicate that cytokinin-modulated calcium entry takes place via dihydropyridine (DHP) 1The abbreviations used are: DHP1,4-dihydropyridineBay K8644methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)pyridine-5-carboxylateBTPbis-tris propane or 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. -sensitive channels(20Conrad P.A. Hepler P.K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 684-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). In moss protonemata, application of DHP calcium channel agonists in the absence of cytokinin stimulates bud initial formation, whereas DHP calcium channel antagonists block cytokinin-induced bud formation(20Conrad P.A. Hepler P.K. Plant Physiol. 1988; 86: 684-687Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). We have previously characterized calcium influx into isolated moss protoplasts and have established that the transport activity of the moss calcium channel shares common characteristics with L-type calcium channels in animal cells. Calcium transport in moss is voltage-dependent, stimulated by DHP agonists, and inhibited by DHP antagonists, phenylalkylamines, and benzothiazepines(21Schumaker K.S. Gizinski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10937-10941Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). A novel feature of the transport activity of this channel is hormonal modulation by cytokinin(21Schumaker K.S. Gizinski M.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 10937-10941Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). 1,4-dihydropyridine methyl 1,4-dihydro-2,6-dimethyl-3-nitro-4-(2-trifluoromethylphenyl)pyridine-5-carboxylate bis-tris propane or 1,3-bis[tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamino]propane. Cytokinin-induced bud formation in moss is a simple, highly ordered developmental process and is one of few plant responses that allows direct study of stimulus-response coupling at the biochemical and molecular levels. In view of the importance of this DHP-sensitive, hormone-stimulated calcium channel in early events in bud formation, it is of considerable interest to determine the molecular properties of this channel. In this study, conditions are established to investigate the interaction of DHPs with moss membranes. We demonstrate the presence of a DHP binding activity, determine its localization in purified plasma membranes, show an absolute requirement for physiological concentrations of calcium for binding, and also provide evidence for regulation of DHP binding by cytokinin. P. patens (Hedw.) Br. Eur. was cultured and grown aseptically using a modified Knop's medium solidified with 1.5% (w/v) agar (basal medium)(22Knight C.C. Cove D.J. Boyd P.J. Ashton N.W. Glime J.M. Methods in Bryology: Proceedings of the Bryology Methods Workshop. Hattori Botanical Laboratory, Nichinan, Japan1988: 47-58Google Scholar). Plants were grown at 25°C under continuous white light (45-50 μE/m2•s1) supplied by fluorescent tubes. Petri dishes containing appropriately supplemented basal medium overlaid with sterile cellophane were inoculated with spore suspensions. To prepare spore suspensions, mature sporophytes were harvested, and 50 capsules were sterilized by soaking in 70% ethanol (5 ml) for 2 min followed by 5.25% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite, 0.1% Triton X-100 (10 ml) for 10 min with occasional swirling. The capsules were washed four times with sterile distilled water (10 ml each) and resuspended in 10 ml of sterile distilled water. Capsules were opened with sterile forceps, and plates were inoculated with 1 ml of spore suspension each (approximately 4 × 103 viable spores). After incubation at room temperature for 2 weeks, protonemal tissue was harvested and ground in sterile water (1 g/6 ml) with a tissue homogenizer (Tissue Tearor, Biospec Products Inc., Bartlesville, OK) for 2 min at 11,000 rpm. Ground tissue (0.25 g/1.5 ml) was transferred to sterile flasks containing 50 ml of Gottwald's medium(23Gottwald R. Buetelmann P. Hartmann E. Glime J.M. Methods in Bryology: Proceedings of the Bryology Methods Workshop. Hattori Botanical Laboratory, Nichinan, Japan1988: 73-76Google Scholar). Flasks were incubated at room temperature under fluorescent lights (as above) on a rotary shaker at 100 rpm for 3 weeks. The tissue was then subcultured by transferring 9-ml aliquots of culture into flasks containing 50 ml of Gottwald's medium. Cultures were incubated for an additional 2 weeks, and the tissue was harvested, weighed (yield: approximately 1 g tissue/flask), and used for membrane isolation. All procedures were conducted at 4°C. Moss vegetative tissue (35-60 g) was homogenized by mortar and pestle in a medium containing 250 mM sorbitol, 3 mM EGTA, 25 mM Hepes-BTP (pH 7.4), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1 mM iodoacetamide, 0.01 mM pepstatin A, 0.2% bovine serum albumin (fatty acid free), and 0.25 g/g of fresh weight polyvinylpolypyrrolidone at a medium-to-tissue ratio of 1.5 ml/g of fresh weight. After filtration through cheesecloth, the debris was homogenized again in 1 ml of homogenization medium/g of the original tissue weight, washed in 0.5 ml/g of the same medium, and filtered. The homogenate was centrifuged for 15 min at 13,000 × g; the resulting supernatant was centrifuged for 30 min at 60,000 × g (Beckman SW 28 rotor, rmax). The resulting pellet (crude microsomal fraction) was resuspended in 250 mM sorbitol, 2.5 mM Hepes-BTP (pH 7.2), and 1 mM dithiothreitol (resuspension buffer). The suspension (1.1 ml) was layered over a two-step (6 and 12%, w/w) dextran gradient (5 ml each) prepared in resuspension buffer. After centrifugation for 2 h at 70,000 × g (Beckman SW 28.1 rotor, rmax), a turbid band at the 6-12% dextran interface was collected and is referred to as plasma membrane-enriched vesicles. To fractionate microsomal membranes, the following modifications to the above procedures were used. The crude microsomal pellet was resuspended, and 12 ml were layered over a three-step (4, 6, and 12%) dextran gradient (8 ml of each). After centrifugation for 2 h at 70,000 × g (Beckman SW 28 rotor, rmax), membranes at the 0-4, 4-6, and 6-12% interfaces were collected and used for localization studies. For all ATPase assays, reaction mixtures (0.5 ml) contained 10-30 μg of protein, 4.5 units of pyruvate kinase, 5 mM MgSO4, 5 mM phosphoenol pyruvate, 0.012% Triton X-100, with 30 mM Hepes-BTP and 5 mM ATP-BTP buffered to the appropriate pH. Reactions were initiated by addition of ATP, and incubation was at 37°C for 30 min. Pi was determined by the method of Fiske and SubbaRow(24Fiske C.H. SubbaRow Y. J. Biol. Chem. 1925; 66: 375-400Abstract Full Text PDF Google Scholar). For measurement of vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity (plasma membrane), Hepes and ATP were buffered to pH 6.7 with BTP; 50 mM KCl, 0.1 μM bafilomycin A1, and 5 mM sodium azide (NaN3) were included in all assays. Vanadate-sensitive activity was calculated as the difference in activity in the absence and presence of 0.1 mM sodium vanadate (Na3VO4). For measurement of bafilomycin A1-sensitive ATPase activity (vacuolar membrane), Hepes and ATP were buffered to pH 7.5 with BTP; 50 mM BTP-Cl, 0.1 mM vanadate, and 5 mM azide were included in all assays. Bafilomycin A1 at a concentration of 0.1 μM was used to determine bafilomycin A1-sensitive activity. UDPase activity (Golgi membrane) was determined in the presence of Triton X-100(25Nagahaski J. Kane A.P. Protoplasma. 1982; 112: 167-173Crossref Scopus (63) Google Scholar). The final concentrations of reaction components were 30 mM Hepes-BTP (pH 7.0), 3 mM MgSO4, 3 mM UDP-Na2, 0.02% Triton in a volume of 0.5 ml. Reactions were initiated by addition of UDP and incubated at 35°C for 30-40 min. Reactions were terminated with 1% ammonium molybdate ((NH4)6Mo7)24•4H2O) in 2 N H2SO4 plus 1% SDS at room temperature. Antimycin A-insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase activity (endoplasmic reticulum) was assayed by monitoring the reduction of cytochrome c spectrophotometrically at 550 nm(26Hodges T.K. Leonard R.T. Methods Enzymol. 1974; 32: 392-406Crossref PubMed Scopus (576) Google Scholar). Protein was determined by the method of Lowry with bovine serum albumin as the standard(27Lowry O.H. Rosebrough N.J. Farr A.L. Randall R.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1951; 193: 265-275Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Membranes were incubated at 20°C in a solution containing 20 mM Hepes-NaOH (pH 7.5), 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl2, and 10 nM [3H]azidopine at a final protein concentration of 0.066 mg/ml. Nonspecific binding, measured by preincubation of membranes with 100 μM of the DHP antagonist, nifedipine, on ice for 60 min, was <10% of total binding at a 10 nM concentration of ligand. Nonspecific binding was subtracted from total binding to yield specific binding. Variations of these conditions for individual experiments are indicated in the appropriate figures and tables. Experiments were initiated by addition of membrane vesicles to reactions; 60 min incubations were used in standard equilibrium binding experiments. Glass fiber filters (Whatman GF/C) used for filtration were presoaked for at least 1 h in 0.3% polyethylenimine. Under these conditions, [3H]azidopine bound to filters in the absence of membranes and could be displaced by nonradioactive ligand. Control experiments were performed without vesicles for each experiment and the binding data was corrected for nonspecific filter interactions. Incubations were stopped by rapid filtration of reaction aliquots (usually 450 μl) under reduced pressure. The filters were immediately washed twice with 5 ml of an ice cold solution containing 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin. Duplicate experiments were systematically carried out using at least three different membrane preparations. Ten-μl samples of the incubation mixture were taken for measurement of the total amount of [3H]azidopine present; radioactivity was measured by scintillation counting. All experiments were carried out under dim light due to the light sensitivity of the dihydropyridines. Solvent controls were included in all assays where necessary. In the experiments to determine sensitivity of [3H]azidopine binding to sulfhydryl reagents, membranes were preincubated with the reagents for 30 min at 37°C before addition of [3H]azidopine. Inhibition of [3H]azidopine binding by different drugs was measured under equilibrium conditions as described above in the presence of 10 nM [3H]azidopine. For determination of association rate constants (k1), the amount of labeled ligand-receptor complex in aliquots taken at various times between initiation of the reaction and the time to equilibrium was determined, and the data were analyzed as previously described(28Scatchard G. Ann. N. Y. Acad. Sci. 1949; 51: 660-672Crossref Scopus (17815) Google Scholar). Dissociation rate constants (k-1) were determined by measuring the amount of labeled ligand-receptor complex remaining at various times after the addition of excess (100 μM) unlabeled ligand. [3H]Azidopine (70-90 Ci/mmol) was purchased from DuPont NEN. Unlabeled nifedipine, bepridil, diltiazem, and Bay K8644 were purchased from Calbiochem. Verapamil was purchased from Sigma. Bafilomycin A1 was obtained from Dr. Karl Heinz Altendorf, University of Osnabrück, Germany. All other chemicals were of the highest quality available from commercial sources. To understand the interaction of the moss channel with the dihydropyridine ligand, equilibrium binding of [3H]azidopine to membranes was carried out in the presence and absence of 100 μM of the DHP antagonist, nifedipine (Fig. 1A). The specific binding, defined as the difference between total and nonspecific binding, was a saturable function of [3H]azidopine concentration. Specific binding of [3H]azidopine varied linearly with increasing concentrations of moss membranes in the range of 10-130 μg of membrane protein/ml (data not shown); all binding studies were carried out in the linear range. In typical experiments using 0.066 mg of protein/ml, total binding in the presence of 10 nM [3H]azidopine was approximately 6500 cpm, while nonspecific binding in the presence of 100 μM nifedipine was approximately 700 cpm (data not shown). The linearity of the Scatchard plot shown in Fig. 1B indicates that the results are consistent with specific binding to a single class of sites and gives a value of 35.6 pmol/mg of protein for the maximum number of [3H]azidopine sites (Bmax) and 5.2 nM for the equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of the azidopine-receptor complex. To determine the cellular location of the [3H]azidopine binding sites, a crude microsomal suspension was separated with a three-step dextran gradient. The 0-4% interface was enriched in tonoplast vesicles as shown by the presence of bafilomycin A1-sensitive (vanadate- and azide-insensitive) ATPase activity (Table 1). UDPase and antimycin A-insensitive NADH cytochrome c reductase, markers for the Golgi and endoplasmic reticulum, respectively, were found predominantly in the 4-6% interface. Vanadate-sensitive (bafilomycin A1- and azide-insensitive) ATPase activity, a marker for the plasma membrane, was highly enriched in the 6-12% interface. Some nifedipine-sensitive [3H]azidopine binding was found in all fractions as indicated by the Bmax values shown in Table 1. However, levels were significantly higher in the membranes recovered from the 6-12% interface, suggesting that [3H]azidopine binding is primarily localized in plasma membranes. The KD values calculated for the binding reactions from the 0-4 and 4-6% interfaces (5.5 and 6.2 nM, respectively) were very similar to the value calculated for binding in the 6-12% fraction (5.2 nM).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The temperature dependence of the interaction of the dihydropyridine with its receptor in moss plasma membranes was determined by direct binding experiments at 4 and 20°C. [3H]Azidopine binding was temperature-dependent; 60-min incubation periods indicated that specific [3H]azidopine binding was maximum at 20°C, with approximately half as much binding at 4°C (data not shown). Kinetic studies indicated a single phase for the association and dissociation of [3H]azidopine. The association reaction of [3H]azidopine at pH 7.5 and 20°C rapidly reached a steady state within 20 min when 10 nM ligand and 0.066 mg/ml membrane protein were used (Fig. 2A). Kinetic data for association were plotted semilogarithmically (Fig. 2B) and show a linear relationship as would be expected for a pseudo-first order reaction. Using the first-order rate equation, this representation gives a k1 of 9.6 × 10-4 M-1 s-1 (n = 3). The dissociation of [3H]azidopine from its receptor in moss plasma membranes was examined by incubating [3H]azidopine with membranes for 60 min, adding 100 μM nifedipine, and examining the residual binding at different time points (Fig. 2C). The time course of dissociation followed first-order kinetics (Fig. 2D) producing a rate constant of dissociation (k-1) of 5.1 × 10-3 s-1 (n = 3) and a half-life of dissociation (t) of 2.26 min. The KD value determined from the ratio k-1/k1 is 5.3 nM which agrees well with results from equilibrium experiments (Fig. 1B). Specific binding of [3H]azidopine to moss plasma membrane receptors increased with increasing pH between pH 5 and 7.5 and remained constant above pH 7.5 (Fig. 3). The relationship between specific binding of [3H]azidopine and pH resembled a simple titration curve, which indicated that there is one ionizable group with a pKa value near 7.1 which is important for the association of [3H]azidopine with its receptor. In addition to DHP analogs, L-type calcium channels in animal cells are modulated by distinct chemical classes of calcium antagonists including phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines. These drugs exert their effect by binding to distinct allosterically coupled drug receptors residing on the α1 subunit of the calcium channel and inhibiting binding of DHPs(29Catterall W.A. Seagar M.J. Takahashi M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 3535-3538Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). To determine whether these agents inhibit azidopine binding to receptors in moss plasma membranes, a number of agents including unlabeled dihydropyridines, verapamil, diltiazem, and bepridil were examined (Figure 4:, Figure 5:). These titration curves were performed in the presence of 10 nM [3H]azidopine. Increasing concentrations of most of the molecules (in the range of picomolar to micromolar) gradually inhibited [3H]azidopine binding to moss plasma membranes. Mean I50 values (concentration of inhibitors producing half-maximal inhibition of [3H]azidopine binding) and the maximal inhibition (percent) observed at the highest inhibitor concentrations are given in the legends to the figures. Bound [3H]azidopine was displaced with the following rank order of compounds: Bay K8644 > verapamil > nifedipine > bepridil > diltiazem. Due to limited solubilities, total displacement of [3H]azidopine binding by verapamil, diltiazem, or bepridil did not occur, so molar affinities of these drugs for the binding sites were not estimated.Figure 5:Inhibition of [3H]azidopine binding to moss plasma membrane receptors by bepridil, diltiazem, and verapamil. Binding of [3H]azidopine was measured with the addition of increasing concentrations of bepridil (A), diltiazem (B), or verapamil (C). Points represent the means ± S.E. of three independent experiments. Mean I50 values (μM) and the maximal inhibition (%) observed at the highest drug concentration are 6.3 and 60 (bepridil), 20.0 and 71 (diltiazem), and 2.0 and 80 (verapamil), respectively.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT) [3H]Azidopine binding was sensitive to sulfhydryl alkylating agents and reducing agents (Fig. 6). The sulfhydryl blocking reagent, N-ethylmaleimide, inhibited binding, suggesting that free thiol groups are essential for receptor-ligand interaction. The moss azidopine receptor showed reduced sensitivity to iodoacetamide (Fig. 6). This lack of inhibition is similar to the effect of iodoacetamide on skeletal muscle T-tubule azidopine receptors and suggests that the essential thiol group may be located in a hydrophobic domain(43Andrejauskas E. Hertel R. Marmé D. J. Biol. Chem. 1985; 260: 5411-5414Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Reducing agents like dithiothreitol (Fig. 6) and β-mercaptoethanol (data not shown) inhibited [3H]azidopine binding at high concentrations implying that intact, but not easily cleaved, disulfide bridges are required for the channel to bind [3H]azidopine with high affinity(30Ferry D.R. Kämpf K. Goll A. Glossmann H. EMBO J. 1985; 4: 1933-1940Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). To determine if DHPs bind sites linked to calcium channels, the effect of calcium on [3H]azidopine binding to moss plasma membranes was evaluated. While substantial amounts of calcium may be bound to membranes, moss plasma membranes were isolated in the presence of 3 mM EGTA which should remove most bound calcium. Binding was dependent on the presence of calcium ions (Fig. 7A); as little as 10 nM calcium increased the binding and maximum stimulation of binding occurred at 1 mM calcium. [3H]Azidopine binding was stimulated by 302 ± 30% (n = 4) at 1 mM calcium (Table 2), and half-maximal stimulation occurred at a concentration of 16 μM (n = 3) free calcium (Fig. 7B).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The specific binding of [3H]azidopine was modulated by a number of divalent metal ions (Table 2). Some stimulation of binding was observed with low concentrations of most of the cations examined; however, the patterns varied considerably. Calcium, strontium, and manganese provided the greatest stimulation of [3H]azidopine binding; however, maximal stimulation by strontium and manganese were only two-thirds and one-half as great as with calcium, respectively (Table 2). Cobalt had both agonist and antagonist effects as low levels of cobalt stimulated [3H]azidopine binding while inhibitory effects were seen at higher concentrations. Ions such as lanthanum, which block the transport of calcium, inhibited [3H]azidopine binding at all concentrations tested. Cytokinins, which provide the primary stimulus for bud formation in mosses(33Gould R.J. Murphy K.M.M. Snyder S.H. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1982; 79: 3656-3660Crossref PubMed Scopus (249) Google Scholar), were tested for their ability to stimulate or inhibit [3H]azidopine binding to receptors in moss plasma membranes. Kinetin stimulated [3H]azidopine binding in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 8A) with half-maximal stimulation at 0.13 nM (Fig. 8B). Other cytokinins also stimulated [3H]azidopine binding with the rank order of kinetin > trans-zeatin > cis-zeatin (Table 3). The hormonally inactive but chemically related adenine and the hormones indoleacetic acid and gibberellic acid did not stimulate [3H]azidopine binding.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Plasma membranes from the moss P. patens contain a single class of binding sites for the calcium channel blocker [3H]azidopine (Fig. 1). [3H]Azidopine binding is saturable (Fig. 1A) and reversible (Fig. 2C and Fig. 4). The maximum binding capacity is high (Fig. 1B), similar to values reported for DHP receptor densities found in T-tubule membranes from rabbit muscle (31Fosset M. Jaimovich E. Delpont E. Lazdunski M.

The equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) for the azidopine-membrane complex suggests that [3H]azidopine binds with high affinity to membranes in this plant. Specific binding of azidopine was eliminated by pretreatment of the membranes with trypsin or chymotrypsin at concentrations of 0.1 mg/ml (data not shown). This protease sensitivity suggests that the interaction of azidopine with moss membranes is protein-mediated, and we have used the term receptor to describe this protease-sensitive binding activity.

In the presence of fibrin, however, single- and two-chain t-PA display equivalent enzymatic activity. “Zymogen activation” of single-chain t-PA, therefore, can be accomplished either by activation cleavage or by binding to the co-factor fibrin. The unusually high, intrinsic enzymatic activity of single-chain t-PA may reflect both the absence of interactions, present in typical proenzymes, that suppress activity of the zymogen and the presence of interactions, absent in typical zymogens, that stabilize an active conformation of the single-chain enzyme. Recent studies suggest that the zymogen triad (Ser-32-His-40-Asp-194), which exists in strong zymogens like chymotrypsinogen but not in t-PA, is an example of the former type of interaction, and that Asp-194, 2To avoid confusion, we use the chymotrypsin numbering system to designate particular residues of the protease domain of t-PA. Positions 15, 32, 40, 143, 156, and 194 of chymotrypsin correspond to residues 275, 292, 305, 416, 429, and 477, respectively, in the t-PA numbering system. together with either Lys-143 or Lys-156, may participate in the latter interactions(12Madison E.L.

Asp-194, a residue that is invariant among enzymes of the chymotrypsin family, may therefore play a very different role in single-chain t-PA from the one it plays in typical serine protease zymogens. Asp-194 forms critical interactions that profoundly influence the catalytic activity not only of serine protease zymogens but also of the corresponding mature enzymes. Upon activation cleavage of chymotrypsinogen, for example, the interaction between the side chains of His-40 and Asp-194 described above is broken as the side chain of Asp-194 rotates approximately 170° to form a strong, buried salt bridge with the new amino terminus at Ile-16(16Freer S.T. Kraut J. Robertus J.D. Wright H.T. Xuong N.H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1997-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar). This new salt bridge, which promotes enzymatic activity by securing the active conformation of the oxyanion hole and the P1 binding pocket, is present in every mature chymotrypsin-like enzyme whose structure has been determined(16Freer S.T. Kraut J. Robertus J.D. Wright H.T. Xuong N.H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1997-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 17Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol.

Henderson R. J. Mol. Biol. 1968; 35: 143-164Crossref PubMed Scopus (283) Google Scholar). It seems very likely, therefore, that this salt bridge will also be present in mature two-chain t-PA, and, consequently, that interactions involving Asp-194 will influence the activity of two-chain t-PA. To test the hypothesis that Asp-194 participates in interactions which influence the activity of both single- and two-chain t-PA and also to examine whether this invariant residue plays an essential role in the stimulation of t-PA by fibrin, we used site-specific mutagenesis to construct the following variants of t-PA: t-PA/D194E, t-PA/D194N, t-PA/R15E,D194E, and t-PA/R15E,D194N. Unlike wild type t-PA or the two single mutants, enzymes containing the R15E mutation were resistant to activation cleavage by plasmin and therefore remained in the single-chain form during assays of plasminogen activation. In the absence of fibrin, the activity of enzymes carrying a mutation at position 194, both toward plasminogen and toward small synthetic substrates, was reduced by factors varying from 1000-2000. Similar reductions in activity were observed for both the single- and two-chain forms of t-PA/D194E and t-PA/D194N. The mutated enzymes, however, displayed a dramatically enhanced response and selectivity toward fibrin co-factors. The chromogenic substrates methylsulfonyl-D-cyclohexyltyrosyl-glycyl-arginine-para-nitroaniline (Spec t-PA), H-D-norleucyl-hexahydrotyrosyl-lysine-p-nitroaniline diacetate salt (Spec PL), soluble fibrin (DESAFIB), Lys-plasminogen, CNBr-digested fibrinogen, and fibrinogen were purchased from American Diagnostica (Greenwich, CT). CAPS, amiloride, and imidazole were purchased from Sigma. Active plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) was a kind gift from Drs. Joe Shore, Jan Kvassman, and co-workers. Aprotinin was purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) and lysine-Sepharose from Pharmacia (Uppsala, Sweden). Buffer and reaction conditions for restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase were as recommended by the commercial source, New England Biolabs or Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany). Other standard recombinant DNA techniques were performed as described(20Sambrook J.F. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual.

Following mutagenesis, single-stranded DNA was prepared from several independent phage isolates. The 290 base tracts of t-PA cDNA in these templates were sequenced completely to verify the presence of the desired mutation and the absence of any additional mutation. Double-stranded, replicative form DNA from phage containing confirmed mutations was prepared and used to isolate the 290-base pair SacI- SmaI fragment of t-PA cDNA. The mutated 290-base pair SacI-SmaI DNA fragments were then used to replace the corresponding region of cDNA encoding wild type t-PA in the eucaryotic expression vector pSVT7/t-PA(23Madison E.L.

Vectors that direct the expression of noncleavable, single-chain variants of t-PA containing mutations at both positions 15 and 194 were constructed from the mutated plasmids described above by replacing the internal 472-base pair EcoRI fragment of t-PA cDNA with a corresponding fragment encoding the mutation R15E. All new plasmid DNAs were isolated, rechecked for the presence of the correct mutation(s), and purified by CsCl equilibrium centrifugation. Expression vectors encoding t-PA/D194E, t-PA/D194N, t-PA/R15E,D194E, or t-PA/R15E,D194N were introduced into COS-1 cells by electroporation using a Bio-Rad Gene Pulser. 20 μg of cDNA, 100 μg of carrier DNA, and approximately 107 COS cells were placed into a 0.4-cm cuvette, and electroporation was performed at 320 V, 960 microfarads, and ohms = ∞. Following electroporation, cells were incubated overnight at 37°C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Life Technologies Inc.) containing 10% fetal calf serum and 5 mM sodium butyrate and then washed with serum-free medium and incubated in Ultraculture serum-free media for 48 h before harvest. The use of Ultraculture serum-free media (BioWhittaker, Walkersville, MD) made it possible to harvest conditioned media for 3 consecutive days before the protein expression declined. The conditioned media were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80°C until purification. Prior to purification, the conditioned media were dialyzed for 48 h at 4°C against 20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.05% Tween 80. t-PA was then collected by three consecutive passages over 0.5 ml of lysine-Sepharose (Pharmacia), using a separate Bio-Rad Econo-Column (0.7 × 5 cm) for each t-PA variant. The columns were washed with 18 column volumes of loading buffer and eluted with 0.2 M arginine in the buffer above. Peak fractions were collected, pooled, and concentrated further before being aliquoted, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −80°C until use. The single-chain form of wild type and mutated enzymes was converted into the corresponding two-chain enzyme by treatment with plasmin-Sepharose as described previously(9Boose J.A. Kuismanen E. Gerard R. Sambrook J. Gething M.-J. Biochemistry. 1989; 28: 635-643Crossref PubMed Scopus (58) Google Scholar), and quantitative cleavage was confirmed by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Concentration of conditioned media or purified enzyme was carried out in Amicon Centriprep® 30 or Centriplus® 30 concentrators according to the manufacturer's instructions. Measurement of enzyme concentrations was accomplished by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as described previously(25Harlow E. Lane D. Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual.

SDS-PAGE was performed on 12% polyacrylamide gels using the buffer system of Laemmli(26Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207208) Google Scholar). Proteins were visualized either by Coomassie Blue staining or by Western blotting, using the primary antibody 374B (American Diagnostica) and the ECL Western detection system from Amersham (United Kingdom).

Assays were performed either in the presence of buffer, 25 μg/ml DESAFIB, 50 μg/ml cyanogen bromide fragments of fibrinogen (American Diagnostica), or 100 μg/ml fibrinogen. Assays were performed at 37°C in microtiter plates, and the optical density at 405 nm was read every 30 s for 2 h in a Molecular Devices Thermomax. Indirect chromogenic assays of wild type and mutated variants of t-PA utilized the substrates Lys-plasminogen and Spectrozyme PL and were performed as described previously(22Madison E.L.

The concentration of Lys-plasminogen was varied from 0.0125-0.2 μM in the presence of DESAFIB and from 0.9-15 μM in the absence of the co-factor.

The Km (0.062 mM) and kcat (24 s-1) of plasmin for Spec PL were determined under our experimental conditions using a preparation of plasmin whose activity had been measured by active site titration. Direct assays of t-PA activity utilized the substrate Spec t-PA and were performed as described previously (22Madison E.L. Sambrook J.F. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 249-271Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar) except that 0.5 mM amiloride, 0.3 μg/ml aprotinin, and 0.02% Tween 80 were included in the assay. Second order rate constants for inhibition of t-PA by PAI-1 were measured under pseudo-first order conditions as described previously(24Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Bassel-Duby R.S. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 3530-3533Crossref PubMed Scopus (140) Google Scholar, 27Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Gerard R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1990; 265: 21423-21426Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Briefly, enzyme and inhibitor were preincubated at 23°C for periods of time varying from 0 to 30 min. Following preincubation, the mixtures were diluted 4-40-fold, depending on the enzyme and PAI-1 concentrations in a particular reaction, and residual enzymatic activity was measured in the indirect chromogenic assay and compared to control reactions in which PAI-1 was added after dilution and addition of fibrin, plasminogen, and Spec PL. For each enzyme, the concentrations of enzyme and inhibitor were chosen to yield several data points for which the residual enzymatic activity varied between 20 and 80% of the initial activity, and the molar excess of PAI-1 over t-PA was always more than 20-fold. Data were analyzed by plotting ln(residual activity/initial activity) versus time of preincubation and calculating the resulting slope. Division of this slope by -[PAI-1] produced the second order rate constant (M-1 s-1). To investigate the functional significance of Asp-194 of t-PA, we used site-directed mutagenesis to replace this residue with either a glutamic acid or an asparagine residue. The resulting variants were denoted t-PA/D194E and t-PA/D194N, respectively. Accurate measurement of the enzymatic activity toward plasminogen of the single-chain form of these variants proved difficult, however, because plasmin produced during the assay rapidly and efficiently converted the enzymes into their mature, two-chain form by cleaving the Arg-15-Ile-16 bond of the single-chain t-PAs. Consequently, to overcome this technical difficulty, we also constructed noncleavable forms of the two mutated enzymes by introducing the additional mutation R15E into the existing variants. Wild type t-PA, t-PA/R15E, and all four variants containing a mutation at position 194 were expressed by transient expression in COS-1 cells and purified by lysine-Sepharose affinity chromatography. Since this procedure yielded almost exclusively single-chain material, two-chain t-PAs were generated by treating the enzyme preparations with plasmin-Sepharose. Quantitative conversion of the enzymes into their two-chain forms was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. As expected, variants containing the mutation R15E were not cleaved by plasmin-Sepharose (data not shown). The enzymatic activity of the single- and two-chain form of wild type t-PA and each variant toward a small synthetic substrate is listed in Table 1. Compared to wild type, two-chain t-PA, the catalytic efficiency of two-chain t-PA/D194E and t-PA/D194N is decreased by a factor of approximately 1400. Single-chain t-PA/R15E,D194E and t-PA/R15E,D194N displayed approximately an 850-fold reduction in catalytic efficiency compared to t-PA/R15E. In all cases, the observed decrease in activity was due primarily to a large decrease in kcat; Km increased by factors of only 1-3. Mutations at position 194 of t-PA, therefore, apparently affect the catalytic machinery of the enzyme, both in the single- and two-chain form, much more dramatically than they affect binding determinants for the ground state, low molecular weight substrate. It is also interesting that the mutated enzymes were activated to the same extent as wild type t-PA by conversion into the mature, two-chain form. This activation occurs mainly by decreasing Km, suggesting that activation cleavage of the variants does not alleviate the distortion(s) of their catalytic machinery caused by the mutations at position 194.Table I Open table in a new tab The enzymatic activity of wild type and mutated variants of t-PA toward the natural substrate plasminogen was measured both in the presence and the absence of the co-factor fibrin. In the absence of soluble fibrin, kcat/Km for plasminogen activation by the two mutants was approximately 2000-fold lower than that of wild type t-PA, and similar decreases in activity were observed for the noncleavable, single-chain form of the mutants compared to t-PA/R15E (Table 2).Table II Open table in a new tab The noncleavable, single-chain mutants retained a Km value similar to that of single-chain t-PA/R15E, and the decrease in activity toward plasminogen was due to a reduced kcat. The basis of decreased activity by the two-chain forms of the mutants was more complicated and included both a large decrease in kcat and at least a 10-fold increase in Km. While the kcat/Km values reported in Table 2for these two-chain variants are very reliable, precise partitioning of the catalytic efficiency of these two variants should be interpreted with caution since the high Km made it impossible to carry out assays at sufficiently high plasminogen concentrations to ensure optimal accuracy of individual Km and kcat values. Comparison of kcat/Km values for the single- and two-chain form of enzymes carrying mutations at position 194 indicated that activation cleavage of these variants, as with the wild type enzyme, produced an approximately 10-fold enhancement of enzymatic activity. The activity toward plasminogen of all six enzymes utilized in this study was substantially enhanced by soluble fibrin monomers (Table II, Table III, and Table 4). Fibrin increased the catalytic efficiency of two-chain t-PA by a factor of 960, and this stimulation was due primarily to a decreased Km for plasminogen. The response of the single-chain enzyme t-PA/R15E to fibrin was even more impressive; in this case, a 9-fold increase in kcat and a 1400-fold decrease in Km combine to yield a stimulation factor of approximately 12,000. Even when compared to these large stimulation factors, however, the response of the enzymes containing mutations at residue 194 to fibrin is dramatic. In all cases, fibrin stimulation of these mutated enzymes includes substantial contributions to both Km and kcat, and fibrin stimulation factors vary from 116,000-1,050,000. For example, with t-PA/R15E,D194N, the presence of soluble fibrin increases kcat by a factor of 4710 and decreases Km by a factor of 219, resulting in a fibrin stimulation factor of 1,050,000 which is significantly larger than that reported for any other plasminogen activator.Table III Open table in a new tab Table IV Open table in a new tab The four enzymes carrying a mutation at residue 194 are not only stimulated to a much greater extent by soluble fibrin than t-PA (Table 4), but they are also significantly more selective toward fibrin co-factors than the wild type enzyme (Fig. 1). Two-chain t-PA is strongly stimulated by soluble fibrin monomers, fibrinogen, and CNBr fragments of fibrinogen, and single-chain t-PA/R15E is stimulated strongly by soluble fibrin and fibrinogen and moderately by the CNBr fragments. By contrast, although dramatically stimulated by fibrin monomers, the variants containing an asparagine residue at position 194 are virtually nonresponsive to either fibrinogen or CNBr fragments of fibrinogen, and variants containing glutamate at position 194 are only poorly (t-PA/D194E) or moderately (t-PA/R15E,D194E) stimulated by fibrinogen and nonresponsive toward the CNBr fragments. The ratio of the specific activity of a plasminogen activator in the presence of fibrin to that in the presence of fibrinogen, or “fibrin selectivity factor,” may be one indication of the “clot selectivity” an enzyme will demonstrate in vivo. An enzyme with enhanced fibrin selectivity may be able to accomplish efficient thrombolysis while displaying decreased systemic activity. Under the conditions of the assays reported here, the fibrin selectivity factor is 1.2 for two-chain t-PA and 1.0 for single-chain t-PA/R15E. All four mutated enzymes exhibit enhanced selectivity toward fibrin, having fibrin selectivity ratios of 30 (t-PA/R15E,D194E), 50 (t-PA/R15E,D194N), 60 (t-PA/D194E), or 190 (t-PA/D194N). As expected from their reduced enzymatic activity, all variants containing a mutation at position 194 were less reactive toward PAI-1, the primary endogenous inhibitor of t-PA(31van Mourik J.A. Lawrence D.A. Loskutoff D.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1984; 259: 14914-14921Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 32Loskutoff D.J. Semin. Thromb. Hemostasis. 1988; 14: 100-109Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar), than the wild type enzyme (Table 5). By contrast to their similar activities toward the substrate plasminogen, there was a clear difference in reactivity toward PAI-1 between the two mutants. Mature t-PA/D194E was inhibited by PAI-1 approximately 30-fold more rapidly than two-chain t-PA/D194N; similarly, single-chain t-PA/R15E,D194E was inhibited by PAI-1 approximately 7 times more rapidly than single-chain t-PA/R15E,D194N. The single-chain form of both variants was less reactive toward PAI-1, by a factor of 3 (D194N) or 13 (D194E), than the corresponding two-chain enzyme.Table V Open table in a new tab All chymotrypsin-like serine proteases that have been crystallized to date possess a salt bridge formed by the new amino-terminal residue, created by activation cleavage, and a conserved aspartic acid residue, Asp-194, which is believed to be necessary for maintenance of the active conformation of the mature enzyme(18Fersht A.R. J. Mol. Biol. 1972; 64: 497-509Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar). Although no crystal structure of the t-PA molecule is available, it seems likely that this important ionic interaction is also present in two-chain t-PA. In this report, we describe the construction and characterization of t-PA mutants in which Asp-194 is replaced by either a glutamic acid or an asparagine. Assuming formation of the new salt bridge in two-chain t-PA, the Asp to Glu mutation is expected to introduce steric constraints on the salt bridge, while the isosteric Asp to Asn replacement would eliminate the salt bridge. The structural effect of these mutations on single-chain t-PA, however, is less predictable because both the molecular basis of the enzyme's unusually high catalytic activity and the interactions formed by Asp-194 in single-chain t-PA remain obscure. Our data support the hypothesis that Asp-194 forms key interactions that promote the enzymatic activity of both single- and two-chain t-PA and provide the first direct evidence that this invariant residue may play opposing roles in single-chain t-PA and chymotrypsinogen. Both single- and two-chain variants of t-PA containing a mutation at position 194 displayed similarly reduced enzymatic activity toward synthetic and natural substrates. In each case, the reduced activity of the mutated enzymes resulted primarily from a decreased kcat, suggesting that the mutations retard the enzyme's catalytic capacity more than it's ability to bind substrate. Because it is known that interactions involving Asp-194 can dramatically influence the position and conformation of Gly-193, one possible explanation for this observation is that our mutations have disrupted a structure known as the oxyanion hole(33Robertus J.D. Kraut J. Alden R.A. Birktoft J.J. Biochemistry. 1972; 11: 4293-4303Crossref PubMed Scopus (362) Google Scholar). After formation of the tetrahedral intermediate, the oxyanion hole, which is formed by the main chain amide groups of Gly-193 and Ser-195, donates two hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl group of the P1 residue of the substrate (17Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar). This key structure, therefore, promotes catalysis, presumably enhancing kcat, by stabilizing the oxyanion of the transition state formed during proteolysis. Comparison of the structures of the mature and precursor forms of trypsin(ogen) and chymotrypsin(ogen) revealed that a surprisingly large segment of these proteins, which was designated the activation domain (17Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar) and contained portions of the primary specificity pocket, the oxyanion hole and the autolysis loop, was reorganized upon activation cleavage(16Freer S.T. Kraut J. Robertus J.D. Wright H.T. Xuong N.H. Biochemistry. 1970; 9: 1997-2009Crossref PubMed Scopus (295) Google Scholar, 34Bode W. Schwager P. Huber R. J. Mol.

Chambers J.L. Kay L.M. Stroud R.M. Biochemistry. 1977; 16: 654-664Crossref PubMed Scopus (160) Google Scholar). This large conformational change involved 16% of the enzyme, provided the structural basis underlying enhanced activity in the mature enzyme compared to the zymogen, and was initiated by insertion of the first two residues of the newly created amino terminus into the activation pocket, where they formed the salt bridge with Asp-194 and at least seven additional, primarily hydrophobic interactions with other residues(17Fehlhammer H. Bode W. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1977; 111: 415-438Crossref PubMed Scopus (220) Google Scholar, 34Bode W. Schwager P. Huber R. J. Mol. Biol. 1978; 118: 99-112Crossref PubMed Scopus (245) Google Scholar). Because single-chain t-PA/D194E and t-PA/D194N display an increase in activity upon activation cleavage which is similar to that observed with wild type t-PA, it is likely that insertion of the mature amino terminus, along with at least a significant part of the subsequent structural reorganization of the activation domain, occurs in both variants as well as in wild type t-PA. Molecular details of the stimulation of t-PA by fibrin, a complex event that almost certainly involves multiple points of contact between the two proteins, remain obscure(37Bennett W.F. Paoni N.F. Keyt B.A. Botstein D. Jones A.J.S. Presta L. Wurm F.M. Zoller M.J. J. Biol. Chem. 1991; 266: 5191-5201Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 38Paoni N.F. Chow A.M. Pena L.C.

For single-chain t-PA, stimulation by fibrin appears to involve at least two distinct mechanisms. First, fibrin apparently stimulates both single- and -chain t-PA through a “templating” mechanism, or the formation of a ternary complex which greatly augments the local concentration of the enzyme and substrate(40Hoylaerts M. Rijken D.C. Lijnen H.R. Collen D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2912-2919Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 41Lijnen H.R. Collen D. Methods Enzymol. 1993; 223: 197-206Crossref PubMed Scopus (10) Google Scholar). Second, because single- and two-chain t-PA have equivalent catalytic activity in the presence but not the absence of fibrin, it seems likely that binding to fibrin induces a conformational change in the activation domain of single-chain t-PA(7Tate K.M. Higgins D.L. Holmes W.E. Winkler M.E. Heyneker H.L. Vehar G.A. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 338-343Crossref PubMed Scopus (112) Google Scholar, 8Petersen L.C. Johannessen M. Foster D. Kumar A. Mulvihill E. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1988; 952: 245-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). Induction of such a conformational change in the absence of activation cleavage and concomitant generation of the mature amino terminus is particularly intriguing but not unprecedented. Similar activation of plasminogen by binding to streptokinase(42Summaria L. Hsieh B. Gros Kopf W.R. Robbins K.C. Proc. Soc. Exp. Biol. Med. 1969; 130: 737-741Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar, 43Reddy K.N.N. Markus G. J. Biol. Chem. 1972; 247: 1683-1691Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 44Schick L.A.

Acta. 1975; 379: 180-188Crossref PubMed Scopus (64) Google Scholar, 49Hendrix H. Lindhout T. Mertens K. Engels W. Hemker H.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1983; 258: 3637-3644Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) has been described previously. Although the mechanism of this nonclassical, nonproteolytic activation of serine protease zymogens remains completely unclear, the behavior of single-chain t-PA/R15E,D194E and t-PA/R15E,D194N suggests that Asp-194 does not play an essential role in the process. Stimulation of mature t-PA is primarily a result of a drastically reduced Km, an observation which is consistent with the templating mechanism described above. It is uncertain, therefore, whether binding to fibrin alters the conformation of two-chain, wild type t-PA. The two-chain variants of t-PA with mutations at residue 194, however, are stimulated by fibrin to a much greater extent than the wild type enzyme, and this stimulation includes very large improvements in both Km and kcat. Consequently, while the variants possess only 0.003-0.05% of the activity of two-chain t-PA in the absence of a co-factor, they develop 3.3-6.2% the activity of the mature wild type enzyme in the presence of fibrin. It seems likely, therefore, that fibrin does induce a conformational change in both the single- and two-chain form of the variants and that this conformational change may partially compensate for the deleterious effect of the mutations. Data in Table II, Table III, and Table 4establish that the variants of t-PA examined in this study are stimulated by fibrin monomers to a greater extent than any previously described plasminogen activator; moreover, data in Fig. 1indicate that these variants also exhibit substantially greater selectivity toward fibrin co-factors than wild type t-PA. The activity of wild type t-PA is stimulated nearly as well by fibrinogen or cyanogen bromide fragments of fibrinogen as by fibrin monomers. By contrast, variants containing an asparagine residue at position 194 are virtually nonresponsive to either fibrinogen or CNBr fragments of fibrinogen, and variants containing glutamate at position 194 are only poorly (t-PA/D194E) or moderately (t-PA/R15E,D194E) stimulated by fibrinogen and nonresponsive toward the CNBr fragments. While the activity assays described above revealed only small differences in reactivity toward synthetic and natural substrates between t-PA/D194E and t-PA/D194N, two-chain t-PA/D194E was significantly more reactive than mature t-PA/D194N toward the specific inhibitor PAI-1. This observation underscores our previous assertion that the interaction of t-PA with physiological substrates and inhibitors differs in significant ways(23Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.-J. Sambrook J.F. Nature. 1989; 339: 721-724Crossref PubMed Scopus (213) Google Scholar, 24Madison E.L. Goldsmith E.J. Gerard R.D. Gething M.J. Sambrook J.F. Bassel-Duby R.S. Proc. Natl.

This study clearly demonstrates that highly specific plasminogen activators which exhibited extraordinary co-factor dependence and selectivity could have evolved by selection of catalytically destructive point mutations whose deleterious effects were partially overcome by interaction of the enzyme with fibrin. Although evolutionary events of this kind may very well explain, at least partially, the relatively modest activity of two-chain t-PA in the absence of fibrin, it is clear that the evolution of fibrin stimulation and selectivity by t-PA has not approached the maximum extent possible. Maintenance of very high enzymatic activity and/or productive interactions with vascular or extravascular stimulators that are not currently appreciated appears, therefore, to have exerted greater evolutionary pressure on t-PA than the development of maximal stimulation and selectivity toward fibrin We thank Betsy Goldsmith and Martin Schwartz for critical review of this manuscript."
https://openalex.org/W1972858888,"When two ongoing FLP-mediated recombination reactions are mixed, formation of cross-products is subject to a lag of several minutes, and the subsequent rate of cross-product formation is greatly reduced relative to normal reaction progress curves. The lag reflects the formation of a stable complex containing multiple FLP monomers and two FLP recombination target-containing DNA recombination products, a process completed within 5-10 min after addition of FLP recombinase to a reaction mixture. The reaction products are sequestered within this complex for an extended period of time, unavailable for further reaction. The length of the lag increases with increasing FLP protein concentration and is not affected by the introduction of unreacted (non FLP-bound) substrate. The results provide evidence that disassembly of FLP complexes from products occurs in a minimum of two steps. At least one FLP protein monomer is released from reaction complexes in a discrete step that leaves the reaction products sequestered. The recombination products are released in a form free to react with other FLP recombination target-containing DNA molecules only after at least one additional disassembly step. One or both of these disassembly steps are rate limiting for reaction turnover under conditions often used to monitor FLP-mediated recombination <i>in vitro.</i>"
https://openalex.org/W2085099959,"The Escherichia coli thr operon attenuator has a structure similar to other Rho-independent terminators. The DNA sequence immediately 5′ to the termination site is dG+dC-rich and contains a region of dyad symmetry that, when transcribed into RNA, encodes a hairpin structure in the transcript. It also contains a stretch of 9 consecutive dA-dT residues immediately distal to the region of dyad symmetry which encode uridine residues at the 3′ end of the terminated transcript. In addition, the thr attenuator has a stretch of 6 dA-dT residues immediately upstream of the region of dyad symmetry which encode 6 adenines. These adenines could potentially pair with the distal uridines to form a hairpin structure extended by as much as 6 A-U base pairs. In this report we have examined the role of the upstream adenines in transcription termination. We used templates that specify mismatches or create new base pairs in the potential A-U secondary structure of the transcript as well as templates that delete segments of the A residues upstream of the hairpin. We conclude that A-U pairing is not required for efficient transcription termination at the thr attenuator. This conclusion is likely to apply to other Rho-independent terminators that contain hairpin-proximal dA-dT residues. The Escherichia coli thr operon attenuator has a structure similar to other Rho-independent terminators. The DNA sequence immediately 5′ to the termination site is dG+dC-rich and contains a region of dyad symmetry that, when transcribed into RNA, encodes a hairpin structure in the transcript. It also contains a stretch of 9 consecutive dA-dT residues immediately distal to the region of dyad symmetry which encode uridine residues at the 3′ end of the terminated transcript. In addition, the thr attenuator has a stretch of 6 dA-dT residues immediately upstream of the region of dyad symmetry which encode 6 adenines. These adenines could potentially pair with the distal uridines to form a hairpin structure extended by as much as 6 A-U base pairs. In this report we have examined the role of the upstream adenines in transcription termination. We used templates that specify mismatches or create new base pairs in the potential A-U secondary structure of the transcript as well as templates that delete segments of the A residues upstream of the hairpin. We conclude that A-U pairing is not required for efficient transcription termination at the thr attenuator. This conclusion is likely to apply to other Rho-independent terminators that contain hairpin-proximal dA-dT residues. The control of gene expression in bacteria often occurs at the level of transcription termination. Transcription terminators are found upstream of operons, between genes in an operon, and at the ends of operons (for reviews, see (1Bauer C.E. Carey J. Kasper L.M. Lynn S.P. Waechter D.A.

In general, transcription terminators have been divided into two classes: Rho-dependent or Rho-independent, depending upon their requirement for Rho factor in vitro(2Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987: 1241-1275Google Scholar). Rho-independent terminators terminate transcription in vitro in the absence of Rho protein or other factors, and have two common structural characteristics(2Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987: 1241-1275Google Scholar). The first is a dG+dC-rich region of dyad symmetry that encodes a stem-loop or hairpin structure in the nascent mRNA. The second feature is a dA+dT-rich region of 4-9 base pairs immediately distal to the region of dyad symmetry within which the transcript terminates. Thus, when RNA polymerase transcribes through a Rho-independent terminator, the transcript forms a hairpin followed by 3′ uridine residues. Evidence from several laboratories has shown that both of these features are required for efficient termination(2Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H. Neidhardt F.C. Ingraham J.L. Low K.B. Magasanik B. Schaechter M. Umbarger H.E. Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium: Cellular and Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. American Society for Microbiology, Washington, DC1987: 1241-1275Google Scholar, 3Chamberlin M. Harvey Lect. 1994; 88: 1-21Google Scholar). The thr attenuator is a Rho-independent terminator that has a dG+dC-rich region of dyad symmetry that encodes a hairpin containing a stem of 8 base pairs and a loop of 6 bases. The hairpin is followed by a tract of 9 consecutive dA-dT residues and termination predominately occurs at the 7th or 8th uridine in the transcript(4Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3896-3904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The importance of the uridine residues was established by Lynn et al.(5Lynn S.P. Kasper L.M. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 472-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), who made deletions that varied the length of the dA-dT tract. They found that the deletion of 1 or 3 dA-dT residues had no effect on transcription termination in vivo or in vitro. The deletion of 4, 5, or 6 dA-dT residues showed a linear decrease in termination efficiency. When 7 or 8 dA-dT residues were deleted, termination was abolished. The thr attenuator also has a dA-dT tract of 6 bases immediately upstream of the region of dyad symmetry(4Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 3896-3904Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The dA-dT tract encodes 6 A residues in the transcript that could potentially pair with 6 of the hairpin-distal U residues to extend the length and stability of the RNA hairpin. Approximately one-third to one-half of the Rho-independent terminators characterized to date also contain hairpin-proximal dA-dT residues as part of an AANAA sequence(6Brendel V. Hamm G.H. Trifonov E.N. J. Biomol. Struct. Dyn. 1986; 3: 705-723Crossref PubMed Scopus (80) Google Scholar), which suggests that pairing of A and U residues could play a functional role in transcription termination. In this report, we describe a systematic analysis of the role of the hairpin-proximal A residues in transcription termination at the thr attenuator. The procedure described by Kunkel (7Kunkel T.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1985; 82: 488-492Crossref PubMed Scopus (4894) Google Scholar, 8Kunkel T.A. Roberts J.D. Zakour R.A.

Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). DNA was isolated from the phage particles by phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The “gapped duplex” template formation and primer extension procedure was carried out by the method of Bauer et al.(10Bauer C.E. Hesse S.D. Waechter-Brulla D.A. Lynn S.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 37: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar). The uracil-containing single-stranded M13mp10-thr derivatives and HaeIII-digested M13mp10w RF DNA were mixed in 30 μl of hybridization buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) and boiled for 3 min. The mixture was allowed to cool to 85°C before addition of 40 pmol of phosphorylated mutagenic primer. The hybridization mixture was slowly cooled to room temperature. Next, 70 μl of primer extension buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 11 mM MgCl2, 1 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.83 mM each 2′-deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate and 0.4 mM ATP), which contained 0.1 unit of T4 DNA ligase and 0.5 unit of DNA polymerase (Klenow fragment), was added. The reaction mixture was first incubated on ice for 15 min and shifted to room temperature for 5 min. The reaction mixture was then incubated at 30°C for another 2 h and the reaction stopped by adding 3 μl of 0.5 M EDTA. The mixture was used to transform competent JM105 cells (10Bauer C.E. Hesse S.D. Waechter-Brulla D.A. Lynn S.P. Gumport R.I. Gardner J.F. Gene (Amst.). 1985; 37: 73-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar) and white plaques on LB plates (tryptone (10 g/liter), yeast extract (5 g/liter), and NaCl (10 g/liter)) containing 40 μg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-gal) were screened. Constructs containing the desired mutation were identified by direct DNA sequence analyses. The construction of the thrA-lacZ protein fusions is shown in Fig. 1A. Restriction fragments containing the Escherichia coli thr operon regulatory region were generated by digesting the appropriate M13mp10-thr derivatives with HincII and EcoRI endonucleases. The HincII site is upstream of the thr regulatory region and the EcoRI site is in the M13 vector. The 5′-protruding ends of the DNA fragments were removed by treating the DNA with mung bean nuclease. The reaction products were subjected to electrophoresis on 1% agarose gels. The desired 557-bp 1The abbreviations used are: bpbase pair(s)X-gal5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside. DNA fragments containing the whole thr regulatory region, part of the thrA gene and vector sequences were electroeluted from the agarose gel. These blunt-ended DNA fragments were ligated into the unique SmaI site of the pMC1396 vector. Plasmid pMC1396, which is a pBR322 derivative and carries a truncated lacZ segment, was constructed by Casadaban et al.(11Casadaban M.J. Chou J. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). A fragment containing a promoter and an in-frame fusion of the thrA gene and vector sequence to the 5′-end of the lacZ coding sequence is required to produce a functional hybrid β-galactosidase. The ligation mixtures were transformed into strain MC4100 and spread on LB plates containing ampicillin (50 μg/ml) and X-gal (40 μg/ml). Colonies containing the desired constructions were identified by their resistance to ampicillin and their blue color on plates containing X-gal. base pair(s) 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside. The construction of thrA-lacZ fusions that lack the sequence from +60 to +107 of the thr leader region was performed as follows (Fig. 1B). The DNA of M13mp9-AT45GG contains dA to dG and dT to dG substitutions at positions +45 and +46, respectively, which creates a sequence that is recognized by endonuclease HpaII. 2H. Scott, unpublished results. The 108-bp BstEII-HpaII fragment from M13mp9-AT45GG containing the sequence from −65 to +43 of the thr operon leader region was isolated and purified from a 5% polyacrylamide gel (9Yang M.-T. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The DNA sequence from +44 to +110 of the thr leader region was replaced by two synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides, one 21-mer 5′-CGCATGGAACGCATTAGCTGA-3′ and the other 23-mer 5′-CGCGTCAGCTAATGCGTTCCATG-3′. These two oligomers were annealed at 80°C for 1 min and slowly cooled to room temperature. The hybridized oligomers contained HpaII and MluI half-sites at the ends. The HpaII sites of the BstEII-HpaII fragment of the M13mp9-AT45GG and the annealed deoxyribonucleotides were ligated. The resulting 129-bp fragment was purified and ligated with M13mp11-WT thr vector that had been digested with BstEII and MluI endonucleases. The resultant recombinant clone that contained 2 extra base pairs at the ligation junction and deleted the sequences necessary for the formation of the 1:2-hairpin structure of the thr leader region was isolated and named M13mp11-WT thr Δ1:2. The HincII-EcoRI fragment of M13mp11-WT thr Δ1:2 was then subcloned into the pMC1403 vector to construct pMC1403-WT thr Δ1:2 by following the procedure described above. Plasmids pMC1403 and pMC1396 are analogous to each other, except that pMC1403 contains a unique EcoRI site (11Casadaban M.J. Chou J. Cohen S.N. J. Bacteriol. 1980; 143: 971-980Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). To construct the pMC1403 attenuator mutant derivatives with the same deletion in the 1:2 region, the MluI-BamHI fragments from the corresponding pMC1396 derivatives (Fig. 1A) were isolated and ligated with the EcoRI-MluI fragment of pMC1403-WT thr Δ1:2. The ligation products were then subcloned between the EcoRI and BamHI sites of the pMC1403 vector (see Fig. 1C). These constructions produced plasmids that are isogenic with pMC1403-WT thr Δ1:2. M13mp8 derivatives (5Lynn S.P. Kasper L.M. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 472-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) carrying a nested set of deletions with 1, 3, 6, or 8 dT residues distal to the region of dyad symmetry of the thr attenuator were used as sources of DNA for the constructs. The terminators were isolated as 42-49-base pair RsaI-XbaI fragments. Approximately 100 μg of plasmid DNA containing the various dA-dT tract deletions (5Lynn S.P. Kasper L.M. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 472-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were digested with RsaI and XbaI, and the fragments were separated by electrophoresis in a 10% polyacrlyamide gel. After staining with ethidium bromide and visualization with ultraviolet light, the appropriate segments of gel containing the bands were excised and soaked in 0.5 ml of 0.5 × TE buffer (5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9) and 0.5 mM EDTA) at room temperature overnight. The gel particles were removed by centrifugation and DNA fragments were purified on DE52 columns(5Lynn S.P. Kasper L.M. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 472-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The pUC18 and pUC19 DNA (Fig. 2) were digested with XbaI and HincII. The RsaI-XbaI fragments were ligated into pUC18 and pUC19 using T4 DNA ligase. The ligation mixtures were transformed into competent KK2186 cells [Δ (lac-pro), supE, thi, strA, sbcB-15, endA/F‘ traD36, lacIQZΔ15 (12Zagursky R. Berman M.L. Gene (Amst.). 1984; 27: 183-191Crossref PubMed Scopus (132) Google Scholar) by the CaCl2 method (13Maniatis T. Fritsch E.F. Sambrook J. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1982: 249-251Google Scholar). The desired clones were identified as white colonies on LB plates supplemented with X-gal, and the sequences of the constructs were verified by direct DNA sequence analysis. The double-stranded DNA templates used for sequencing were prepared by the method of Kraft et al.(14Kraft R. Tardiff J. Krauter K.S. Leinwand L.A. BioTechniques. 1988; 6: 544-547PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmid DNAs of the pMC1396 and pMC1403 derivatives were denatured by sodium hydroxide, and a synthetic 17-mer oligodeoxyribonucleotide 5′-ATAGCGCACAGACAGAT-3′ was used as a primer. This primer hybridizes to the region from positions +3 to +19 of the thr operon leader sequence. The resultant DNA was sequenced by the dideoxy method of Sanger et al. (15Sanger F. Nicklen S. Coulson A.R. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1977; 74: 5463-5467Crossref PubMed Scopus (52505) Google Scholar) with a modified T7 DNA polymerase, Sequenase(TM) from U. S. Biochemical Corp. Plasmid DNA from the constructs containing the deletions was sequenced using a Taq Track kit from Promega. In vitro transcription reactions were performed with purified RNA polymerase essentially as described by Yang and Gardner(9Yang M.-T. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The final concentrations of the components of the transcription reaction mixtures were the following: 20 mM Tris acetate (pH 7.9), 0.1 mM Na2 EDTA, 0.1 mM dithiothreitol, 150 mM KCl, 150 μM GTP, 150 μM ATP, 150 μM UTP, 50-80 μM CTP, and 10-20 μCi of [α-32P]CTP, 1-2 pmol of DNA template, and 1-2 pmol of E. coli RNA polymerase. In some experiments, GTP was replaced by ITP at a concentration of 150 μM. Templates carrying the dA-dT tract deletions contain Plac. Reactions using these templates contained 1.25 μM cAMP and 0.34 mg of CRP protein. Transcription reactions (50 μl) were terminated after 10-20 min at 37°C by the addition of an equal volume of phenol, and carrier tRNA was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mg/ml. After the phenol extraction, the aqueous phase was adjusted to 0.3 M sodium acetate and the samples were ethanol-precipitated, desalted, dried in vacuo, and resuspended in formamide dyes (80% formamide, 1 × TBE buffer, 0.1% xylene cyanol, and 0.1% bromphenol blue). The products of the transcription reactions were analyzed on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea sequencing gels. After autoradiography, regions of the gel corresponding to the terminated and read-through transcripts (9Yang M.-T. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) were cut out of the gel and counted in a Beckman LSI801 scintillation counter. The molar ratios of the terminated and read-through transcripts were calculated by correcting for the lengths and base compositions of the transcripts(9Yang M.-T. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In vivo recombination of thrA-lacZ fusions onto λRZ-5 (16Silhavy T.J. Berman M.L. Enquist L.W. Experiments With Gene Fusions. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1984Google Scholar) was performed as follows. Strains containing the thrA-lacZ fusion plasmids were grown in LB medium overnight. Cells (0.1 ml) were subcultured into 5 ml of LBMM (tryptone (10 g/liter), yeast extract (5 g/liter), NaCl (10 g/liter), maltose (20 mg/liter), and 10 mM MgSO4) and shaken at 37°C for 2 h. One ml of the cell suspension was infected with 10 μl of λRZ-5 at a multiplicity of infection of 2-5. The cultures were then grown at 37°C until lysis occurred. Chloroform (50 μl) was added, and the cultures were incubated for 15 min. The lysates were collected as the supernatant fraction after centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min. The phage lysates were diluted 1:100 and 1:1000 into λCa2+ buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 10 mM MgSO4, and 5 mM CaCl2), and 0.1 ml of each dilution was added to an equal volume of overnight MC4100 cells. The mixtures were then spread on T-plates (tryptone (10 g/liter), NaCl (5 g/liter), and Bacto-agar (12.5 g/liter)) containing 25 μg/ml ampicillin and 40 μg/ml X-gal. The transduced MC4100 strains were identified by their resistance to ampicillin and formation of blue colonies. All the lysogens were verified by their sensitivity to λvir and resistance to lysis by λh80del9C(17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Lysogenic strains containing only one copy of a λ prophage were identified by a modified method of Sly and Rabideau(18Sly W.S. Rabideau K. J. Mol. Biol. 1969; 42: 385-400Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar). Determination of the copy number of the λ prophage was based on the susceptibility of the lysogen to different dilutions of a λcI 90c17 lysate. MC4100 strains with a single λ prophage were used in assays for β-galactosidase activity. The β-galactosidase assays were performed as described by Miller(17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar). Bacterial strains were grown in minimal medium (17Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972: 352-355Google Scholar) supplemented with 0.2% glucose. Each sample was assayed in triplicate, and the specific activities were calculated and averaged. The standard deviations were less than 10%. Restriction endonucleases, mung bean nuclease, and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. and used according to the manufacturer's specifications. Oligonucleotides were synthesized by the University of Illinois Biotechnology Center. [α-32P]CTP (>400 Ci/mmol) was purchased from Amersham Corp. E. coli RNA polymerase and CRP protein were gifts from E. Morgan and J. Harmon, respectively. Like other Rho-independent terminators, the E. coli thr attenuator has a dG+dC-rich region of dyad symmetry that encodes an RNA hairpin followed by 9 consecutive dA-dT residues that encode 7 or 8 uridine residues at the 3′ end of the transcript. In addition, there are dA-dT residues that encode adenosines in the transcript immediately preceding the region of dyad symmetry. The 3′ uridine residues are complementary to the stretch of adenosine residues, and the stability and length of the helix would be enhanced by extending the base pairs from the G+C-rich hairpin to include the 6 A-U base pairs. Such base pairing could be important in promoting transcription termination at terminators that contain this feature by a variety of mechanisms. For example, the increased stability of the hairpin provided by the A-U base pairs could be required for termination or the extended helix could be required as a structural component of the termination signal by interacting with the enzyme. In templates that contain deletions of the upstream dA-dT residues, the stability and length of the hairpin would be reduced resulting in less efficient transcription termination. Alternatively, the formation of the extended helix in the transcript could compete for uridine residues that are paired with the template and disrupt U-dA interactions at the 3′ end of the transcript to promote termination and dissociation of the enzyme. Thus, when the length of the A-U helix is less than 6 base pairs, the length of the RNA-DNA duplex would increase and possibly reduce transcription termination. Several other Rho-independent terminators including the phe(19Zurawski G. Brown K. Killingly D. Yanofsky C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1978; 75: 4271-4275Crossref PubMed Scopus (93) Google Scholar), leu(20Keller E.B. Calvo J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 6189-6190Google Scholar), and ilvB(21Friden P. Newman T. Freundlich M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci U. S. A. 1982; 79: 6156-6160Crossref PubMed Scopus (46) Google Scholar) attenuators also contain upstream adenosines as part of a conserved AANAA sequence that can also potentially form base pairs with the uridines. In addition, the bidirectional tonB/P14 terminator and α operon terminator, tL17, contain stretches of adenosines upstream of the hairpin(22Postle K. Good R.F. Cell. 1985; 41: 577-585Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (60) Google Scholar, 23Wright J.J. Kumar A. Hayward R.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar). If A-U base pairing is important for efficient transcription termination at these terminators, a simple prediction is that disruption of the base pairs, by introducing substitutions upstream of the hairpin or in the hairpin-distal region of the template, should reduce the efficiency of transcription termination. In addition, compensating mutations that restore base pairing should direct efficient transcription termination. We constructed a series of mutant templates that contained single or double mutations in the thr attenuator and measured their transcription termination efficiencies in vitro and in vivo. The mutants specified potential base pair mismatches or new base pairs in the stretch of A and U residues of the transcript (Fig. 3B). Most of these variants, each containing single or double base changes, were made by oligonucleotide-directed site-specific mutagenesis. L131G is a substitution mutant with an A to G change in the run of A residues immediately 5′ to the attenuator. Mutants L158C, L160A, and L160G disrupt the U tract by substituting C, A, or G for U at positions +158 and +160, respectively. Mutants L153A (24Lynn S.P. Bauer C.E. Chapman K. Gardner J.F. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 183: 529-541Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar) and L160C 3J. Gardner, unpublished results. were isolated by a genetic selection that involved isolating mutants that decrease transcription termination at the thr attenuator in vivo. Variants L131U/L160A and L131G/L160C contain different base substitutions at the same positions: A to U or G at position +131 and U to A or C at position +160, respectively. These two variants disrupt the sequences of both the A and U stretches, but maintain the potential complementarity at the base of the stem. Variant L153A/L160C, which contains two single base changes at positions +153 and +160, has disruptions in both the G+C-rich region and the U tract of the thr attenuator. The BstEII-SstI restriction fragments bearing the thr operon leader region and different attenuator mutants were isolated from the M13mp10-thr constructs and used for in vitro transcription studies (Fig. 3A). The transcribed RNA was subjected to electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gels and subjected to autoradiography. The terminated (164 bases) and read-through (300 bases) transcripts were isolated, and the amount of radioactivity in each gel species was measured. The in vitro transcription termination efficiencies of the attenuator variants are presented in Fig. 4and Table 1.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab The results showed that variant L153A/L160C, which contains C-A mismatches in both the dG+dC-rich region and the U stretch of the attenuator, significantly decreased the termination frequency. Variants with substitutions at position +160 only (L160C, L160G, and L160A) showed termination frequencies that were only slightly lower than wild type. All of the remaining variants bearing base substitution(s) that disrupted the runs of A or U residues terminated efficiently. It has been shown previously (9Yang M.-T. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that substitution of ITP for GTP caused a decrease in termination frequencies for several other thr attenuator variants. Inclusion of ITP decreased termination at the mutant terminators dramatically but had only a slight effect on termination at the wild type site(9Yang M.-T. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). If ITP caused a similar decrease in the termination frequencies of the mutants constructed in this study, it would be possible to determine the effects of base changes that either disrupted or restored the putative complementarity in the runs of A and U residues of the thr attenuator. The termination frequencies obtained from ITP-substituted in vitro transcription experiments are shown in Fig. 4and Table 1. As observed previously, incorporation of ITP in the transcripts showed only a slight effect when the wild-type template was used with a termination value of 65%(9Yang M.-T. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1989; 264: 2634-2639Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Variants L160C, L160G, and L160A, which contain disruptions in the U tract by substituting C, G, or A, respectively for U at position +160, showed drastically decreased termination frequencies. Since these three variants have the same G+C-rich sequences and are expected to form hairpin structures identical to the wild type with one potential mismatch in the A-U region, it is likely that the decrease in the termination values for these variants is caused by effects of the substituted bases at the U stretch, possibly by affecting RNA-DNA template interactions or by direct effects of the sequence changes themselves. This interpretation was further supported by comparing the results from two attenuator variants, L131G/L160C and L131U/L160A. These two variants were specifically constructed so that the putative base pairing at the base of the stem of the thr attenuator were restored; i.e. I-C and U-A base pairs in L131G/L160C and L131U/L160A, respectively. If the effect exhibited by the single mutants (L160C or L160A) arose from disruption of the A-U base pairings at the base of the thr attenuator, the two variants would be expected to terminate as efficiently as the wild type. The results show that both of the variants retained termination frequencies similar to the variants with the same change in the U stretch only (L160C or L160A). Taken together, the in vitro transcription studies with ITP suggested that single base changes in the run of A residues have no effect on termination. To determine the effects of the variants in vivo, the same mutants were subcloned into the vector pMC1403 to construct in-frame thrA-lacZ protein fusions (Fig. 1, B and C). These constructs lack the leader region that encodes the upstream secondary RNA structures that are involved in regulating the formation of the thr terminator structure encoded by the attenuator. These plasmids were constructed to avoid possible complications introduced by the upstream sequences. The fusions were then crossed onto λRZ5 by homologous recombination and single-copy lysogens were constructed. The level of β-galactosidase expression should only reflect the termination efficiencies of these attenuator variants in vivo. Table 2shows the results of β-galactosidase assays performed on cells grown in minimal medium. The results show that variant L131G exhibited the same level of β-galactosidase activity as wild type. This result could be explained by the formation of a G-U base pair in the helix. However, variants which only disrupted the U tract showed 3.7-4.0-fold (L160C and L158C) and 7.5-7.9-fold (L160A and L160G) higher β-galactosidase activities than that of wild type. Furthermore, the β-galactosidase activities of the two variants bearing base changes that could potentially form base pairs in the transcript at both the runs of A and U were 3.1 times (L131G/L160C) and 5.9 times (L131U/L160A) the wild-type value. The results again suggested that the restoration of complementarity at the base of stem cannot compensate for the effects of a single substitution mutation in the U stretch. In vivo β-galactosidase assays of the variants that contain an intact thr leader region also gave similar results (data not shown).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab A second prediction of the model proposing that A-U base pairing is important for transcription termination is that deletions of the adenosine residues upstream of the hairpin would decrease the length of the helix and, consequently, decrease the efficiency of transcription termination. We constructed templates that encoded varying numbers of adenosine residues without changing the sequence of the hairpin and downstream uridine residues. RsaI-XbaI fragments (42-49 bp) were isolated from several deletion mutants previously constructed by Lynn et al. (5Lynn S.P. Kasper L.M. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 472-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) that contained a series of successive deletions of the hairpin-distal dA-dT tract. These fragments contain the threonine attenuator plus approximately 15 bp upstream of it. The fragments were cloned into pUC18 and pUC19 at the HincII and XbaI sites (Fig. 2). The attenuator was in the wild-type orientation, with respect to the direction of transcription from the lac promoter in pUC19 and in the inverse orientation in pUC18. The number of dA-dT residues distal to the region of dyad symmetry varied in the pUCl9 clones and the number of dA-dT residues upstream of the region of dyad symmetry varied in the pUC18 clones (Fig. 2). Since the dG+dC-rich region is an inverted repeat, the RNA hairpin encoded by it had the same sequence in either orientation. The sequences between the inverted repeats that encode the loop of the RNA hairpin and the sequences that encode RNA upstream of the dA-dT residues preceding the hairpin and nontranscribed sequences downstream of the hairpin-distal dA-dT residues were different in the two orientations. However, these sequences were constant for each series of constructs. A nomenclature was established to distinguish the various clones. This nomenclature was based on the number of upstream and distal dA-dT residues and the orientation: (+) for wild type and (-) for the inverse. Thus, A6-T6(+) had 6 dA-dT residues upstream of the hairpin and 6 dA-dT residues downstream of the hairpin and was in the same orientation as in the wild-type thr operon. A8-T6(-) had 8 dA-dT residues upstream of the hairpin and 6 hairpin distal dA-dT residues and was in the opposite orientation as in the wild-type thr operon. PvuII fragments varying in size from 364 to 371 bp were purified from the clones and used as templates in in vitro transcription reactions (Fig. 5). Using templates with the (+) orientation, the termination efficiency decreased from 61% for A6-T8(+) to 7% for A6-Tl(+) as the number of uridine residues in the transcript decreased from 8 to 1 as observed previously(5Lynn S.P. Kasper L.M. Gardner J.F. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 472-479Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In contrast, with templates of the(-) orientation, in which the number of adenosine residues upstream of the hairpin were varied, termination was efficient and varied from 64% to 78%. Since transcription termination is efficient even on a template that contains a deletion that removes 5 of the 6 adenosine residues upstream of the hairpin, these results also indicate that A-U base pairing is not important for efficient transcription termination. In summary, we have constructed variants of the thr attenuator to determine if the tract of 6 dA-dT residues upstream of the sequence encoding the dG+dC-rich hairpin are important for transcription termination. Both the in vitro and in vivo results indicate that an intact dA-dT tract is not essential for efficient transcription termination. These results argue against a model that proposes that pairing between the adenosine residues upstream of the hairpin and downstream uridine residues is necessary for transcription termination. In addition, the dA-dT tract upstream of the hairpin does not contribute essential structural or sequence information because deletion of 5 of the 6 A residues from the transcript does not affect the efficiency of termination. The results are compatible with current models that propose that termination is a multi-step process involving active participation of the RNA polymerase (3Chamberlin M. Harvey Lect. 1994; 88: 1-21Google Scholar, 25Reynolds R. Bermúdez-Cruz R.M. Chamberlin M.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1992; 224: 31-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (143) Google Scholar, 26Nudler E. Kashlev M.

Cell. 1995; 81: 351-357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (105) Google Scholar) or that termination is controlled by the relative stabilities of DNA-DNA, RNA hairpin, and DNA-RNA interactions at the termination site in the transcription bubble(2Yager T.D. von Hippel P.H.

It is interesting to note that a study by Wright et al. (23Wright J.J. Kumar A. Hayward R.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) with the tL17 terminator has shown that a deletion of the tract of 7 adenosines upstream of the dG+dC-rich element increases the frequency of read-through at the terminator by a factor of 10 in vivo. They concluded that pairing between the adenosines in the A-tract and the uridines in the distal U tract is important for termination. We have no obvious explanation for the differences observed between the thr and tL17 terminators. As discussed by Wright et al. (23Wright J.J. Kumar A. Hayward R.S. EMBO J. 1992; 11: 1957-1964Crossref PubMed Scopus (22) Google Scholar) it is possible that, as a consequence of the deletion of the A tract, the formation of an alternative stem-and-loop structure could occur. It would contain 4 instead of 5 G-C base pairs in the stem, and the loop would be 6 rather than 4 bases. It is also possible that the length of the helix in the stem of the RNA could be important in determining the requirement for pairing between the A tract and the distal uridines. The thr and tL17 stems are 8 and 5 base pairs in length, respectively. Perhaps the tL17 terminator requires A-U base pairs in addition to the G-C base pairs to extend the length of the stem helix in order to act as an efficient terminator.

INTRODUCTIONThe F1-F0 ATP synthase from Escherichia coli (for reviews, see (1Fillingame R.H. Krulwich T.A. The Bacteria. Academic Press, Inc., New York1990: 345-391Google Scholar, 2Futai M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1989; 58: 111-136Crossref PubMed Scopus (403) Google Scholar, 3Senior A.E. Annu. Rev. Biophys. Biophys. Chem. 1990; 19: 7-41Crossref PubMed Scopus (328) Google Scholar)) is composed of eight different types of polypeptide subunits which are coded by eight genes found in a single operon called unc (or atp). The enzyme can be physically separated into a membrane-bound portion called F0 and a water-soluble portion called F1. F1 consists of five types of subunits: α (uncA), β (uncD), γ (uncG), δ (uncH), and ∊ (uncC) in a stoichiometry of 3:3:1:1:1. F0 consists of three types of subunits: a (uncB), b (uncF), and c (uncE) in a stoichiometry of 1:2:10 ± 1 (4Foster D.L. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 2009-2015Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).In the intact F1-F0 complex, the net synthesis of ATP at sites in F1 is in response to an electrochemical proton gradient across the membrane, which drives proton movement through F0. This proton movement is coupled to net synthesis of ATP at sites in F1, probably via a series of conformational changes. Isolated F1 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ATP, but not its synthesis. The molecular events linking the movement of protons through the membrane-bound portion of the ATPase to the synthesis of ATP at distant sites, remain essentially unknown. Recently, x-ray crystallographic studies of F1 from bovine mitochondria (5Abrahams J.P. Leslie A.G.W. Lutter R. Walker J.E. Nature. 1994; 370: 621-628Crossref PubMed Scopus (2734) Google Scholar) has provided structural information about α, β, and parts of γ. In the resulting model, the amino and carboxyl termini of γ penetrate the central cavity of the α3β3 hexamer, in an asymmetric fashion. One interpretation is that the γ subunit rotates with respect to α and β, thereby sequentially interacting with different catalytic sites, as indicated by earlier studies(6Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar).With the E. coli enzyme, two additional subunits, δ and ∊, are necessary for the proper binding of the α3β3γ complex to F0. In addition, ∊ has the interesting property of acting as an intrinsic inhibitor of ATP hydrolysis by the soluble F1(7Laget P.P. Smith J.B. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1979; 197: 83-89Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar, 8Sternweiss P.C. Smith J.B. Biochemistry. 1980; 19: 526-531Crossref PubMed Scopus (106) Google Scholar). The mechanism by which ∊ acts upon the remaining F1 subunits to cause inhibition is unknown. The removal (or displacement) of ∊ from the complex results in about a 6-fold increase in ATP hydrolysis activity(9Lötscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 10Dunn S.D. Zadorozny V.D. Tozer R.G. Orr L.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar). This effect is not dependent upon the presence of the δ subunit. The ∊ subunit is thought to inhibit by reducing the rate of product release(10Dunn S.D. Zadorozny V.D. Tozer R.G. Orr L.E. Biochemistry. 1987; 26: 4488-4493Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar), the rate-limiting step in hydrolysis. It is known to bind to isolated γ subunit(11Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), but can be cross-linked to α, β, and γ subunits(12Dallmann H.G. Flynn T.G. Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1992; 267: 18953-18960Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 13Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Lai S.X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A.

Biochem. 1986; 154: 321-327Crossref PubMed Scopus (19) Google Scholar).A series of deletion mutants has been constructed from the carboxyl terminus of ∊ and analyzed(16Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). A truncated form containing only the first 93 residues, plus 2 serine residues at the new carboxyl terminus, was capable of inhibiting ATP hydrolysis and of promoting the binding of F1 to F0. A shorter subunit (80 residues) was also capable of the binding function, but did not have inhibitory properties. These data seem to suggest that an “inhibitory domain” exists, composed at least partially of residues between 80 and 93, and that it is distinct from a binding domain in the first 80 residues. Other studies (17Jounouchi M. Takeyama M. Noumi T. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar, 18Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) indicated that about 15 amino acids can be lost from the amino terminus without a total loss of function.Nucleotide-dependent conformational changes in ∊ have been detected by protease sensitivity (19Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar) and by cryoelectron microscopy using monoclonal antibodies(20Wilkens S. Capaldi R.A. Biol. Chem. Hoppe Seyler. 1994; 375: 43-51Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). An interesting recent result is that second-site suppressors of a c subunit mutation (Q42E) were mapped to ∊-Glu-31. Quite possibly, both ∊ and γ might be intimately involved in the coupling of proton translocation to ATP synthesis, as has been reviewed recently(21Capaldi R.A. Aggeler R. Turina P. Wilkens S. Trends Biochem. Sci. 1994; 19: 284-289Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (130) Google Scholar). To probe the interactions of ∊ with other subunits, and its role in function, we have applied alanine-scanning mutagenesis(22Wells J.A.

Strain XH1 (ΔuncC, bglR, thi-1, rel-1, Hfr PO1) (24Xiong H. Vik S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1995; 177: 851-853Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) was used to characterize mutations in uncC. It contains a deletion from −2 to 271 in uncC and produces no detectable ∊ subunit. It is complemented by plasmid pXH302S, which contains a synthetic version of uncC. Cultures were grown at 37°C, and cell density was monitored by optical density at 600 nm using a Milton Roy 1001 spectrophotometer. Rich medium was Luria Broth supplemented with 0.2% glucose, and minimal medium was A salts supplemented with succinate (0.2%) or with glucose, as indicated(25Miller J.H. Experiments in Molecular Genetics. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1972Google Scholar). Media were supplemented with ampicillin (100 mg/liter) or tetracycline (12.5 mg/liter) as appropriate.Construction of MutationsPlasmid pXH302S was used to construct the mutations (shown in Fig. 1) using the cassette mutagenesis technique, as described previously(26Vik S.B. Cain B.D. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6599-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar, 27LaRoe D.L. Vik S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 633-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). Plasmids were subjected to sequential digestion by each of the two indicated restriction enzymes, followed by ligation with annealed oligonucleotides. Following mutagenesis, plasmids were isolated from transformants (28Sambrook J. Fritsch E.F. Maniatis T. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual. 2nd Ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY1989Google Scholar) and screened by various restriction enzyme digestions to detect the presence of mutations. Subsequently, the DNA sequences of plasmids thought to bear mutations were analyzed using [α-35S]dATP as described before (26Vik S.B. Cain B.D. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6599-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) or by a silver staining technique (Promega) according to the manufacturer's instructions. As indicated in Fig. 1, S10A and F16A were constructed simultaneously in the same plasmid. These mutations were later isolated using a unique SacII restriction site which lies between the two mutations. Most of the other mutations were constructed using degenerate oligonucleotides, which produced mixtures of wild type and mutant residues that were identified after sequence analysis. One mutation, E90A, was never isolated. Mutations were characterized following transformation of the strain XH1.Preparation of Cell Fractions and AssaysFractionation of cells and isolation of membranes and stripped membranes were carried out as described(29Cain B.D. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6606-6612Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Protein concentrations were determined by the Bio-Rad protein assay using bovine serum albumin as standard. ATP hydrolysis assays were carried out as described (9Lötscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar) with 50 mM Tris acetate, pH 7.5, 3 mM ATP, 5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM KCN, 2 mM phosphoenolpyruvate, 0.25 mM NADH, pyruvate kinase (6 units), and lactate dehydrogenase (8 units) at 37°C using a Beckman DU70 spectrophotometer. For release of inhibition by ∊, LDAO was added to the assay medium to a final concentration of 1%(9Lötscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar). Inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by DCCD was performed as described previously(26Vik S.B. Cain B.D. Chun K.T. Simoni R.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 6599-6605Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). Fluorescence quenching assays were performed using 400 μg/ml membrane protein in a solution of 50 mM Mops, pH 7.3, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 μM ACMA, and either 0.5 mM NADH or 0.1 mM ATP, as appropriate. The excitation wavelength was 410 nm and the emission wavelength was 490 nm. Fluorescence quenching was abolished by addition of 1 μM carbonyl cyanide p-(trifluoromethoxy)phenylhydrazone.ImmunoblottingSamples of membranes (75 μg of protein) were electrophoresed and immunoblotted as described previously(30Wang S. Vik S.B. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 3095-3099Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), using anti-∊ monoclonal antibodies and goat, anti-mouse IgG-alkaline phosphatase conjugate.RESULTSMutations were constructed as outlined in Fig. 1. Amino acid residues in ∊ were converted to alanine to maximize the possibility that the effects of mutagenesis would be confined to local changes. Residues were selected for mutagenesis based on the following criteria. First, partially conserved, and generally polar, residues were selected. Second, the locations of the mutations were generally confined to the first 85 amino acids, the size of ∊ that was shown to be sufficient for inhibition of F1 ATPase activity(16Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Eighteen mutants, with either single or double alanine substitutions in ∊, were analyzed for growth properties following transformation of the ∊ deletion strain XH1. The mutants that were constructed and their growth properties are shown in Table 1. Only 2 mutants, S10A and F16A, grew poorly on minimal succinate medium, as compared to wild type. The measurement of growth yields in minimal glucose medium confirmed those results: S10A (48%), F16A (67%), T77A (85%), and all of the rest were >90% of the wild type level. The results of ATP-driven proton translocation assays by membrane vesicles followed the same pattern: S10A and F16A had no activity, E70A and T77A had 65% and 60% of the wild type activity, respectively, and all of the rest were >90%.Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab ATP hydrolysis by membrane vesicles from these mutants was measured under three sets of conditions, and the results are shown in Table 1. The standard assay was the coupled enzyme assay at pH 7.5. This assay was repeated in the presence of 1% LDAO, which is known to release the inhibition of F1 ATPase activity by ∊(9Lötscher H.R. deJong C. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1984; 23: 4140-4143Crossref PubMed Scopus (99) Google Scholar, 31Dunn S.D. Tozer R.G. Zadorozny V.D. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 4335-4340Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar). The second assay reveals two properties of the mutants. First, it yields the level of uninhibited ATPase activity of the membranes, which reflects the total amount of F1 bound. Second, when compared with the first assay it shows the fold stimulation upon LDAO addition, which reflects the fold inhibition by ∊. Finally, a third assay was performed after preincubation with DCCD, a specific inhibitor of proton translocation by F0. Decreased sensitivity of ATPase activity to DCCD reflects ATP hydrolysis that is not obligatorily coupled to proton translocation.Results of the standard ATP hydrolysis assays revealed that membranes from S10A and F16A had undetectable levels of membrane-bound ATPase. Membranes from the other mutants ranged from 51% to 132% of the wild type levels of ATPase activity, suggesting 2 classes of mutants. This was confirmed by assays in the presence of LDAO, or after preincubation with DCCD. Six mutants showed stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by LDAO of less than 2.4-fold, compared to the wild type value of 3.1-fold. These mutants were T77A, R85A, D81A/R85A, T82A/R85A, T43A, and K46A. This group also tended to have lower levels of bound F1 ATPase, averaging 61% of wild type, and to have normal sensitivity to DCCD, averaging 60% (95% of the wild type value).A second class consisted of E70A, S65A, E59A/E60A, K54A/E60A, E59A, and E31A. These mutants showed higher than normal stimulation of ATPase activity by LDAO, with values ranging from 3.5- to 4.6-fold. These mutants showed a more normal level of membrane-bound F1 ATPase, averaging 85% of the wild type level. However, the membrane-bound ATPase activity was less sensitive to DCCD, averaging only 48% (76% of the wild type level). Six additional mutants, E21A, Q24A, E29A, R51A, K54A, and R93A had properties that were intermediate between the other two classes and were more similar to the wild type.Membranes from all mutants were subjected to immunoblotting using two previously described monoclonal antibodies to ∊(23Aggeler R. Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10387-10393Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Both monoclonal antibodies failed to recognize F16A, and S10A was recognized only weakly. The only significant difference between the two antibodies was that ∊I failed to recognize E21A and Q24A.A sequence alignment and secondary structure prediction was obtained using the EMBL PHD system(32Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar), and results of the secondary structure predictions are summarized in Fig. 2. Sequences from seven ∊ subunits were found to have greater than 30% identity with that of E. coli, and those were used in the secondary structure prediction. Six regions of β-strand were predicted in the first 78 amino acids, and three regions of α-helix were predicted at the carboxyl terminus(79-138), consisting of 5, 16, and 21 residues. Two other regions were weakly predicted to be β-strands: residues 15-16 and 32-34. Each of the 8 predicted β-strands shown in Fig. 2has 2 hydrophobic residues separated by a single residue. These residues are underlined. This trend exists in each of the eight ∊ sequences and is consistent with amphipathic β-strands, such as those which would form a β-barrel or β-sandwich. The only exception is the second predicted β-strand, in which the 2 hydrophobic residues are adjacent. Further analysis of 21 bacterial ∊ sequences retrieved by BLAST analysis (33Altschul S.F. Gish W. Miller W. Myers E.W. Lipman D.J. J. Mol. Biol. 1990; 215: 403-410Crossref PubMed Scopus (69041) Google Scholar) revealed that this pattern of hydrophobic residues was present in each sequence (not shown).Figure 2:PHD prediction of secondary structure of ∊. The lines labeled AA contain the amino acid sequence of ∊, with the corresponding numbers above. PHD indicates the profile network prediction, where E indicates β-strand, H indicates α-helix, and blank spaces indicate a loop prediction.

The goal of the present work was to identify by mutagenesis individual amino acids in ∊ that are involved in specific roles. Since amino acid replacements can cause a variety of nonlocal effects on protein structure, alanine-scanning mutagenesis (22Wells J.A. Methods Enzymol. 1991; 202: 390-411Crossref PubMed Scopus (309) Google Scholar) was used in this study.Two mutants, S10A and F16A, seemed to be defective in assembly of the ATP synthase. Residue 10 is predicted to be in the first turn following the first β-strand. The mutant S10C has previously been characterized (13Aggeler R. Chicas-Cruz K. Lai S.X. Keana J.F.W. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar) and has been cross-linked to γ via the thiol group. Our results are consistent with the location of residue 10 being near the ∊-γ interface. In addition, introduction of alanine at position 10 creates a hydrophobic patch at residues 8-11 (VVAA) that may promote misfolding or ∊-∊ aggregation. Others (18Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar) have observed that a deletion of residues 7-14 in ∊ caused aggregation.The mutant F16A is even less functional. Residue 16 resides in the second predicted β-strand at a position that is always Phe, Tyr, or Trp. Other studies have shown that amino-terminal deletions in ∊ of 16 residues are much more severe than are deletions of only 15 residues (17Jounouchi M. Takeyama M. Noumi T. Moriyama Y. Maeda M. Futai M. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1992; 292: 87-94Crossref PubMed Scopus (28) Google Scholar). Our results also indicate a critical role for residue 16.Residues Thr-77, Asp-81, Thr-82 and Arg-85 seem to be important for the binding of ∊ to other subunits. Each of the four mutants showed reduced levels of membrane-bound F1 ATPase activity, but this activity was not significantly inhibited by ∊ as shown by the low stimulation by LDAO (approximately 1.5 versus 3.1 for wild type). It is not unexpected that mutations that alter ∊ binding to other subunits, presumably γ(11Dunn S.D. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 7354-7359Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), would reduce both the binding of F1 to F0 in membranes and also the inhibition of ATPase activity by ∊. These residues extend from the eighth predicted β-strand to the α-helical region. This region has been implicated previously in the inhibitory role of ∊ by analysis of deletions from the carboxyl terminus(16Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). It has also been shown that an ∊-monoclonal antibody has an epitope that is buried in F1 and part of that epitope is between residues 78 and 85 (18Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Two other mutants analyzed in this study have similar properties: T43A and K46A. These residues lie in a stretch of 15 amino acids between the fourth and fifth predicted β-strands. It is possible that these residues make up part of the epitope for ∊-mAb-1, described previously(18Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar).A second group of mutants has an opposite effect on the inhibitory properties of ∊. This group also contains residues from two distinct regions: residue 31 and residues 59-70. With these mutants a relatively high level of F1 is bound to membranes, averaging 85% of wild type, but the ATPase activity is highly inhibited. Upon addition of LDAO, the activity is stimulated up to 4.6-fold. It appears that these mutants, E31A, E59A, E60A/K54A, E59A/E60A, S65A, and E70A, form stable F1-F0 complexes, but that the F1 is locked in an abnormally inhibited state.Residue Glu-31 is located in the fourth predicted β-strand and has been mutagenized previously(27LaRoe D.L. Vik S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 633-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). This residue has also been identified as the site of partial suppressors of the c subunit mutant Q42E(34Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). In the present study, E31A was found to reduce the sensitivity of F1 ATPase to DCCD (76% of wild type). Mutations at the nearby residue His-38 were shown (27LaRoe D.L. Vik S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 633-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar) to reduce the sensitivity of F1 ATPase to DCCD. This evidence tends to support either of the possibilities offered(34Zhang Y. Oldenburg M. Fillingame R.H. J. Biol. Chem. 1994; 269: 10221-10224Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), that this region of ∊ interacts directly with the polar loop of c or that it interacts with “stalk” subunits, which interact with c. A reduced sensitivity to DCCD by membrane-bound F1 ATPase is also seen with most of the other members of this group, especially S65A and E70A (70% and 62% of wild type, respectively). Residue 65 is predicted to lie in a loop between the sixth and seventh β-strands, and residue 70 is part of the predicted seventh β-strand. The double mutant E59A/E60A also has reduced sensitivity to DCCD, and these residues are found in a loop between the fifth and sixth predicted β-strands.The two monoclonal antibodies have been characterized previously with respect to binding of ∊ in F1 and F1-F0, ∊I (5A3-C11), and ∊II (13A7-E9) (23Aggeler R. Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10387-10393Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar). Our results reveal a single difference between these two antibodies: ∊I does not recognize the mutants E21A and Q24A. Since it was determined previously (23Aggeler R. Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1990; 29: 10387-10393Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar) that ∊I does not recognize ∊ in F1-F0 complexes, but that ∊II does weakly, it is likely that residues 21 and 24 of ∊ are shielded by the binding of F1 to F0.The results of the present study contribute to the growing picture of the role of ∊ in the structure and function of the F1-F0 ATP synthase. Previous work by others has indicated a two-domain structure for ∊(16Kuki M. Noumi T. Maeda M. Amemura A. Futai M. J. Biol. Chem. 1988; 263: 17437-17442Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), separated by a “hinge” region near residues 80-85(18Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 279-284Crossref PubMed Scopus (14) Google Scholar). Conformational changes in ∊ have been observed via differences in protease sensitivity and in response to ligands at nucleotide binding sites(19Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 1278-1284Crossref PubMed Scopus (71) Google Scholar). DCCD has been shown to alter the nucleotide dependence of trypsin cleavage(35Mendel-Hartvig J. Capaldi R.A. Biochemistry. 1991; 30: 10987-10991Crossref PubMed Scopus (55) Google Scholar). Movement of ∊ relative to other F1 subunits has been observed via specific cross-linking reagents, also in response to ligands at nucleotide binding sites(6Gogol E.P. Johnston E. Aggeler R. Capaldi R.A. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1990; 87: 9585-9589Crossref PubMed Scopus (100) Google Scholar, 12Dallmann H.G. Flynn T.G. Dunn S.D. J. Biol.

Biochemistry. 1992; 31: 2956-2961Crossref PubMed Scopus (95) Google Scholar). The effects of several mutations at the strictly conserved residue His-38 have also been studied. H38C has been shown to be accessible to Ellman's reagent, and the modified ∊ remains inhibitory(36Skakoon E.N. Dunn S.D. Arch. Biochem. Biophys. 1993; 302: 272-278Crossref PubMed Scopus (30) Google Scholar). Two other mutants H38I and H38R were found to have decreased sensitivity to DCCD, but ∊ seemed to be highly inhibitory(27LaRoe D.L. Vik S.B. J. Bacteriol. 1992; 174: 633-637Crossref PubMed Google Scholar).A schematic model for the secondary structure of ∊ is shown in Fig. 3, based on the PHD secondary structure predictions, hydrophobicity considerations, and the results of our mutagenesis. The model is oriented such that the top would be near the α and β subunits in F1, and the bottom would be near the c subunits of F0. The model includes 8 antiparallel β-strands, 3 α-helical segments, and one significant region of undesignated secondary structure."
https://openalex.org/W2074480879,"Optimal activation of T cells often requires signals delivered by the ligation of T cell receptor (TcR) and those resulting from costimulatory interaction between certain T cell surface accessory molecules and their respective counter receptors on antigen presenting cells. The molecular events underlying the co-stimulatory activity are still not understood fully. Here we describe a 38-42-kDa (B3) protein, present on the surface of lipopolysaccharide-activated B cells, which can provide costimulation to resting T cells leading to a predominant release of interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-5 and negligible amounts of IL-2 and interferon-γ. Binding assay and electron microscopic autoradiography data suggest that this molecule binds T cells, and the same can be competed by unlabeled B3. Characterization experiments point out that B3 shows up as a single prominent peak on reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatography, runs as a single spot in reducing two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and is a phosphoglycoprotein. The Western analysis indicate that it does not cross-react with antibodies directed against murine ICAM-1, LFA-1α, VCAM-1, HSA, and B7 suggesting the novelty of the protein.

The precise mechanism by which APCs activate T cells is quite complex and not fully understood. The current dogma is that at least two signals are required. The first signal is provided by the occupancy of TcR, which is major histocompatibility complex restricted(1Schwartz R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1985; 3: 237-261Crossref PubMed Scopus (721) Google Scholar), and the second non-major histocompatibility complex restricted signal (costimulatory signal) is delivered by certain molecules present on the surface of APCs(4Liu Y.

The participation of costimulatory signal in T cell activation is of paramount importance as it results in two potential outcomes, activation or clonal anergy(7Mueller D.L. Jenkins M.K. Schwartz R.H. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1989; 7: 445-480Crossref PubMed Scopus (1467) Google Scholar, 8Jenkins M.K. Immunol. Today. 1992; 13: 69-73Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (192) Google Scholar). The two different outcomes of antigen recognition, by T cells, is first explained by the dual signal model of T cell activation by Bretscher and Cohn (9Bretscher P.A. Cohn M. Science. 1970; 169: 1042-1049Crossref PubMed Scopus (1382) Google Scholar) and updated recently by Jenkins and Schwartz(10Jenkins M.K. Schwartz R.H. J. Exp. Med. 1987; 165: 302-319Crossref PubMed Scopus (1040) Google Scholar). Since then, efforts of numerous researchers have culminated in the identification of various molecules capable of providing costimulatory signal(11Jenkins M.K. Johnson J.G. Curr. Opin.

The list of these second signal generating molecules, however, is still far from complete as reports are rapidly appearing in the literature regarding the possible existence of certain hitherto unknown molecules with costimulatory properties(12Johnson J.G.

To identify additional cell surface-associated molecules that provide costimulatory signals to T cells, we have isolated proteins from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated B cell membrane. When reconstituted into lipid bilayer, at least three proteins (B1, B2, and B3) gave differential levels of costimulatory help to primary T cell activation. The present document presents the results obtained with one of the above proteins with a molecular mass range of 38-42 kDa (B3) (the data of B1 and B2 have been communicated elsewhere) and its relation to primary T cell activation and differentiation. Female inbred BALB/C mice, 8-10 weeks old, were obtained from the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, India, and from our conventional conditions and were allowed free access to food and water. All the cell lines and hybridomas used in this study, viz. anti-Thy 1 (TIB 99), anti-L3T4 (TIB 207), anti-CD8 (TIB 150), anti-Mac2 (TIB 166), anti-Mac3 (TIB 168), 33D1 (anti-dendritic cell Ab; TIB 227), anti-IL-2 R (CRL 1698), HT-2 (CRL 1841), anti-Iad (HB3), anti-IFN-γ (HB 170), anti-IL-2 (HB 8794), anti-IL-4 (HB 188), anti-LFA-1 (TIB 217), and anti-ICAM-1 (CRL 1878) were procured from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), Rockville, MD. Anti-CD3 (145.2C11) was a kind gift from Dr. Charles A. Janeway Jr., Howard Hughes Medical Institute, New Haven, CT. WEHI-279 (CRL 1704), A20 (TIB 208), and anti-HSA (TIB 183) were kind gifts from Dr. Satyajit Rath, National Institute of Immunology, New Delhi, India. CD4+ T cells were prepared from mice spleens as follows. Briefly, a single cell suspension of spleens was prepared in balanced salt solution (pH 7.2). Red cells were lysed using hemolytic Gey's solution. Non-adherent cells, collected by allowing cells to adhere to plastic Petri plates (Nunc, Denmark) at 37°C with 7% CO2 for 2 h, were treated sequentially with a mixture of anti-Mac2 and anti-Mac3 (45 min on ice), 33D1 (45 min on ice), and anti-Iad (45 min on ice). The cells were then washed and incubated with two rounds of anti-Lyt-2.2 (Cedarlane, Ontario, Canada) with 45 min each on ice followed by treatment with low toxicity baby rabbit complement. CD4+ T cells were enriched by passing through nylon wool column. The cells were collected after five to six washes with prewarmed RPMI, 10% FCS (37°C) and plated on Petri plates, previously coated with goat anti-mouse IgM, for 1 h at 37°C. The non-adherent cells were used as a source of CD4+ T cells and the purity of such cell population routinely exceeded 98% as estimated by FACScan (Beckton Dickinson) in preparations stained with anti-L3T4. Resting B cells from mice spleens were prepared as follows. Briefly, a single cell suspension of spleens was prepared in balanced salt solution (pH 7.2). The red blood cells were removed by treatment with Gey's solution. After removing the macrophages by allowing them to adhere twice to plastic surface (1 h each at 37°C and 7% CO2), the cells were treated twice (45 min each on ice) with a mixture of anti-Mac2, anti-Mac3, and 33D1 and a mixture of anti-Thy1, anti-L3T4, and anti-CD8 followed by labeling (30 min at 37°C) with low toxicity baby rabbit complement. The cells obtained were then loaded on a discontinuous Percoll gradient (100, 70, and 50%) and centrifuged at 1600 × g for 30 min at 4°C. The cells collected from 100-70% interface layer were considered as resting B cells. Activated B cells were prepared as follows. Briefly, a single cell suspension of mice spleens was prepared in balanced salt solution (pH 7.2). The red blood cell were depleted by treatment with hemeolytic Gey's solution. The cells were then plated on plastic Petri plates (Nunc, Denmark) for 2 h at 37°C and 7% CO2. The non-adherent cells were treated sequentially on ice for 45 min each with a mixture of anti-Mac2 and anti-Mac3, and a mixture containing anti-Thy1, anti-L3T4, and anti-CD8 antibodies followed by complement mediated killing. The cells were then incubated at a concentration of 4 × 107/10 ml/pertiplate with 10 μg/ml LPS (from Salmonella typhosa; Sigma) for 72 h at 37°C and 7% CO2. The purity of such cells was over 98% as analyzed by FACscan (Beckton Dickinson). The LPS-activated B cells were harvested and washed three times with PBS (pH. 7.2) and frozen overnight at −70°C. The cells were thawed and homogenized in the presence of 0.25 M sucrose, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), and 1 mM EDTA along with a protease inhibitor mixture (leupeptin 10 μg/ml, aprotinin 10 μg/ml, iodoacetamide 10 mM, antipain 10 μg/ml, pepstatin 10 μg/ml, chymostatin 10 μg/ml, and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM). The nuclear fraction was removed by centrifugation for 10 min at 700 × g at 4°C. The supernatant (S1) was collected and kept aside. The pellet was rehomogenized and spun as above. The supernatant (S2) was collected, and the pellet was discarded. S1 and S2 were mixed and subjected to centrifugation at 1,10,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was solubilized in 1% Triton X-100, 20% glycerol, and 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) and protease inhibitor mixture (composition as mentioned above) and agitated overnight at 4°C followed by centrifugation at 100,000 × g for 1 h at 4°C. The proteins, from the supernatant, were separated using 10% preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis according to Laemmli(15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After electrophoresis, the protein bands were located by staining a strip of the gel with Coomassie Blue, and the appropriate unstained regions were crushed and eluted with 1% SDS, 100 mM NH4HCO3,50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 0.15 M NaCl (pH 8.0) at 37°C for 48 h. After filtration and centrifugation to remove polyacrylamide particles, the solution was dialyzed against 0.1% SDS, 10 mM NH4HCO3, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.01 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl (pH 8.0) for 24 h at 4°C. To the protein solution was added Lubrol Px (a neutral detergent) to effect a final 10% of the detergent concentration, and it was kept at 37°C for 6 h to enable a micelle mixture of SDS-Lubrol Px. This was followed by dialysis against 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% Lubrol Px, 0.01 mM EDTA, 50 mM NaCl at 4°C for 96 h. The dialysis buffer was replaced by a fresh one after every 8 h. The extent of SDS removal, from the protein in the dialyzing bag, was estimated with a basic fuschin method(16Waite J.G. Wang C.Y. Anal. Biochem. 1979; 70: 279-280Crossref Scopus (47) Google Scholar). These were prepared by a reverse phase evaporation method using DL-α-phosphatidylcholine, dipalmitoyl, Sigma) in 1:1 chloroform/methanol ratio. The lipid film was left in vacuum for 2 h at room temperature. The film was then hydrated in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 60 mM NaCl and sonicated in a bath type sonicator (Bransonic, model B 2200 E4, Danbury, CT) to clarity at 4°C for 30 min. The liposomes were sequentially sized through 0.4 and 0.2 μm polycarbonate membranes before use. A 1 to 500 ratio of SDS-depleted and partially renatured protein sample to liposomes was placed in a dialysis bag and dialyzed for 96 h at 4°C against 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 0.01 mM EDTA, and 10 mM NaCl with at least 12 changes of dialysis buffer. The contents of the dialyzing bag were spun down for 2 h at 4°C at 178,000 × g. The supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was dissolved in physiological saline and later passed through a Sephadex G-50 minicolumn according to Fry et al.(17Fry D.W. White J.C. Goldman I.D. Anal. Biochem. 1987; 90: 809-815Crossref Scopus (384) Google Scholar) to remove unliposomized protein. 2 ml of the above sample was layered on top of a discontinuous gradient of 5-40% sucrose (w/v) in 10 mM Tris-HCl (6.8), 0.15 M NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA. The sample was centrifuged overnight at 98,000 × g in a Beckman SW28 rotor at 4°C. 2-ml samples were collected from the 5 and 10% interface, washed in 5 volumes of physiological saline by centrifuging at 178,000 × g for 2 h at 4°C. The pellet was dissolved in physiological saline and stored sterile for not more than 3 months at −20°C. The protein content, coupled to liposomes, was estimated after lysing with 1% SDS by the BCA method(18Smith P.K. Krohn R.I. Hermanson G.T. Mallia A.K. Gartner F.H. Provenzano M.D. Fujimoto E.K. Goeke N.M. Olson B.J. Klenk D.C. Anal. Biochem. 1985; 150: 76-85Crossref PubMed Scopus (18713) Google Scholar). The lipid phosphorous was estimated as per the method of Ames and Dubin (19Ames N.B. Dubin D.T. J. Biol. Chem. 1960; 235: 769-774Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). CD4+ T cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Inc.) supplemented with penicillin (70 μg/ml), streptomycin (100 μg/ml), glutamine (4 mM), 2-mercaptoethanol (50 μM) sodium pyruvate (1 mM), HEPES (20 μM), and 10% heat-inactivated FCS (Sera Laboratories, Crawley Down, Sussex, United Kingdom). Affinity purified anti-CD3 (145.2C11) (10 μg/ml), diluted in 50 mM carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6), was immobilized on the surface of 96-well flat-bottomed (Costar, Cambridge, MA) culture plates by overnight incubation at 4°C. The wells were washed three times with PBS (pH 7.2) before adding the cells along with varying concentrations of experimental, reconstituted, and control proteins. Phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) (Sigma) was used at a concentration of 10 ng/ml. The proliferation was assessed after 72 h of culture with 1 μCi [3H]thymidine added during the last 16 h of culture. Cells were harvested on a multiple sample harvestor (Skatron, Norway), and the incorportated radioactivity was assessed in a scintillation counter. CD4+ T cells were cultured in 24-well plates at a density of 0.25 × 106/well with different stimuli. The culture supernatants were collected after 22 h for lymphokines assay. Interleukin-2 and interleukin-4, in culture supernatants, were determined by the induction of HT-2 proliferation as described by Fernandez-Bortan et al.(2Clevers H. Alarcon B. Wileman T. Terhost C. Annu. Rev. Immunol. 1988; 6: 629-662Crossref PubMed Scopus (611) Google Scholar). Briefly, HT-2 cells (1 × 104/well) were cultured in 96-well flat bottomed plates, containing RPMI 10% FCS and various concentrations of culture supernatants from control and experimental wells. Since HT-2 cells are responsive to both these lymphokines, therefore, while measuring IL-2 level, the activity of IL-4 was neutralized using anti-murine IL-4 antibody (600 ng/ml). Likewise, for IL-4 assay, the activity of IL-2 was inhibited by adding anti-IL-2 and anti-IL-2 receptor antibodies. The cultures were incubated for 24 h at 37°C/7% CO2 followed by pulsing with 1 μCi [3H]thymidine during the last 6 h of culture. The cells were harvested, and the incorporated radioactivity was measured by liquid scintillation counting. The lymphokines activity, in terms of units, was derived by extrapolating the standard curve values obtained by using recombinant interleukin-2 and −4 (Genzyme). Interferon-γ was assayed by its ability to inhibit the proliferation of WEHI-279 cells. Cells were cultured in 96-well flat bottomed plates with different concentrations of culture supernatants from control as well as experimental wells. The cultures were pulsed with [3H]thymidine and the incorporated radioactivity was measured as above. Recombinant IFN-γ served as standard to extrapolate the lymphokine activity in terms of units. The activity of IL-5 was assayed by the induction of proliferation of mouse splenic resting B cells using dextran sulfate as a comitogen as described by Swain(21Swain S.L. J. Immunol. 1985; 134: 3934-3943PubMed Google Scholar). Resting B cells were obtained from splenocyte suspension as mentioned above. After washing, 1 × 105 cells/well were added into individual wells of 96-well flat bottomed microtiter plate. 100-μl aliquots of a range of dilutions of the culture supernatants under test were added in triplicate wells along with 50 μg/ml dextran sulfate. Murine recombinant IL-5 added in different dilutions to obtain a standard curve whose specificity was cross-checked with anti-IL-5 (500 ng/ml). The cultures were pulsed with 1 μCi of [3H]thymidine after 72 h and harvested 16 h later. The incorporated radioactivity was determined by liquid scintillation counting. IL-5 activity, expressed in terms of units/ml, was obtained from the standard values. CD4+ T cells (5 × 106/ml) were cultured in 24-well plate (Costar, MA) for 8 h at 37°C, 7% CO2 in the presence of previously immobilized anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml), PMA (10 ng/ml), and B3 (0.01 μg/ml) in separate sets of experiments. Thereafter, the cells were harvested and washed repeatedly in cold PBS (pH 7.2) and stored at −70°C in pellets until RNA extraction was performed. Total cytoplasmic RNA was prepared according to White and Bancroft (22White B.A. Bancroft F.C. J. Biol. Chem. 1982; 257: 8569-8572Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and blotted over to Immobilon-N (Millipore, MA) and cross-linked to the membranes by Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). Membranes were washed with 1 × SSC and 0.1% SDS for 1 h at 65°C and then prehybridized in a solution containing 50% formamide, 5 × SSPE (20 × SSPE = 3 M NaCl, 0.2 M Na2HPO4, and 20 mM EDTA) and 5 × Denhardt's reagent (50 × Denhardt's = 1% each of Ficoll, BSA fraction V, polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% SDS) overnight at 42°C. Specific RNA was detected by probing the membranes with [γ-32P]ATP-labeled cDNA probes for murine IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, and IFN-γ (Amgen Biological, Thousand Oaks, CA) in fresh prehybridization buffer for 24 h at 42°C. After washing, the membranes were exposed to x-ray film with an intensifying screen at −70°C for 48 h. SDS-PAGE was performed in 0.5-mm thick slab gels containing 4% acrylamide in stacking gel and a 10% acrylamide in separating gel, with a buffer system according to Laemmli(15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). The lane containing B3 was transferred on to Immobilon-P (Millipore, CA), washed, and visualized by staining with 0.2% aqueous Ponceau S, destained, and its ability to bind 125I-ConA was tested in conjunction with autoradiography on x-ray film. The assay mixture (final volume, 0.2 ml) contained 50 mM MOPS/KOH (pH 6.0), [γ-32P]ATP (0.2 mCi/ml), 0.3 M MgCl2, and approximately 75 μg protein of LPS-activated B cell membrane lysate. The reaction carried out at room temperature was started by addition of the proteins and stopped by adding 50 μl of 50% trichloroacetic acid, 0.3 M unlabeled ATP, and 0.3 M MgCl2. All the following operations were carried out at 4°C. The proteins were washed four times. The pellet, extracted by 1 ml of diethylether, was further processed and electrophoresed according to Amory et al.(23Amory A. Foury F. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9353-9357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) After electrophoresis, the gel was stained with Coomassie Blue, destained, and B3 was located, excised, dried, and exposed to x-ray film. 125I-Labeling of B3 was performed using the IODO-bead method with PD-10 column (Pharmacia, Sweden). Iodinated samples were trichloroacetic acid- precipitated and an equivalent fraction containing 2 ng of protein was allowed to bind the CD4+ T cells preactivated with anti-CD3 (10 μg/ml) or PMA (10 ng/ml) and/or both as the case may be. The reaction was carried out for 30 min at 37°C in RPMI containing 10% FCS, 0.2% sodium azide, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.0). For competition binding, a range of (5-100 times the protein concentration) non-radiolabeled dilutions of B3 was used. The reaction mixture was incubated at 4°C for 2 h on an orbital shaker and mixed with a vortex mixer at 15-min intervals. After extensive washing, the cell pellets were subjected to gamma counting (Beckmann). A 20-μl droplet of aqueous suspension of liposomes was placed on a fresh piece of parafilm, and a sample droplet was picked up by touching a carbon-coated grid to it. After allowing the excess liquid to drain off, the grid was gently dipped in 1% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0) and dried by blotting on a filter paper. Grids were observed in a transmission electron microscope (JEOL 1200 EXII, Japan) and representative fields were photographed. The B3•liposome complex as well as goat anti-mouse IgM (Sigma) were 125I-labeled by IODO-bead method essentially as described in the previous section. The radiolabeled samples were incubated with CD4+ T cells (previously activated at 37°C for 30 min with 10 μg/ml anti-CD3) for 30 min at 37°C. After incubation, the cells were washed thrice with PBS to remove unbound material by centrifuging for 10 min at 500 × g at 4°C. To the pellet was added an equal volume of low melting agarose (Sigma) and allowed to gel, and the latter was cut into 1-mm3 pieces. Trapped cells were fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde, 1% glutaraldehyde in PBS at 4°C for 1 h. After washing with PBS, the cells were post-fixed in 1% osmium tetraoxide for 90 min at 4°C in the dark. After washing with PBS and passing through graded acetone series, the samples were embedded in epoxy resin (Bio-Rad). Ultrathin sections, cut on Ultracut S (Richert-Jung, Austria), were coated in dark with photographic emulsion (Ilford nuclear L4 emulsion) and incubated in the dark for 2-3 weeks in a dessicator at 4°C. The autoradiographs were developed and stained with aqueous uranyl acetate and lead citrate and observed in a transmission electron microsope (JEOL 1200 EXII, Japan). Western immunoblots were made from SDS-PAGE(24Towbin H. Staehelin T. Gordon J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1979; 76: 4350-4354Crossref PubMed Scopus (44939) Google Scholar). Samples were electrophoresed for 90 min with constant amperage of 14 mA in a minigel apparatus (Atto, Japan). The proteins were transferred to Immobilon-P polyvinylidine difluoride membranes (Millipore, MA) using a Bio-Rad electrophoretic transfer unit with 10 mM CAPS buffer (pH 11.0). After washing in PBS, pH. 7.2, for 15 min, the membranes were blocked with 3% nonfat dry milk and 0.2% Tween-20 in PBS for 2 h at 37°C with gentle agitation. After washing in PBS, the membranes were incubated overnight at 4°C with appropriate antibody in PBS-Tween, washed, and incubated with anti-rat horseradish peroxidase-conjugated IgG for 2 h at room temperature on an orbital shaker. Bound antibody was detected with metal ion enhanced diaminobenzidine. B3 was located, isolated, and eluted as mentioned earlier in this section. The protein sample was then diluted with 0.5% trifluoroacetic acid and loaded on to a microbore HPLC column (C8) (Aquapore RP 300, Brownlee columns, ABI) and monitored. B3 isolated from activated B cell membranes, as described above, was purified by 10% SDS-PAGE(15Laemmli U.K. Nature. 1970; 227: 680-685Crossref PubMed Scopus (207537) Google Scholar). After the electrophoresis, B3 was blotted on to “ProtBlot” (Applied Biosystems) in CAPS buffer (pH 11.0) followed by staining in 0.2% Ponceau S, 1% acetic acid and washed with PBS. The protein was then digested with trypsin as its N terminus was found to be blocked and a sample equivalent of 2 pmol, from one of the digested fractions, was subjected to internal sequencing up to 15 residues on Applied Biosystem (model 492 A) Procise Sequencer (at The Protein Sequencing Facility, Worcester Foundation for Experimental Biology, Shrewsbury, MA). The repetitive yields of the first 15 amino acids sequenced were found to be at least 90%. The reagents for this purpose were prepared essentially according to Amory et al.(23Amory A. Foury F. Goffeau A. J. Biol. Chem. 1980; 255: 9353-9357Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar) and performed as advocated by Penin et al.(25Penin F. Godinot C. Gautheron D.C. Biochim. Biophys. Acta. 1984; 775: 239-245Crossref PubMed Scopus (36) Google Scholar). The membranes of LPS-activated murine splenic B cells, when subjected to SDS-PAGE analysis, revealed about 15 major protein bands when stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue (Fig. 1a). B3 was localized, crushed, and eluted as described under “Experimental Procedures.” The accuracy with which B3 was isolated was checked by rerunning the protein on SDS-PAGE. When stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, it demonstrated a single band both under"

INTRODUCTIONAdenoviruses, like most viruses, encode an endopeptidase that is essential for virion maturation and infectivity. The gene has been sequenced in 12 different adenoviruses and, though highly conserved, it lacks signature proteinase motifs and has no significant homology to known proteins(1Weber J.M. Tihanyi K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar, 2Weber J.M. Curr. Top. Microbiol. Immunol. 1995; 199/I: 235-277Google Scholar). Much of our knowledge about this cysteine protease derives from studies with a temperature-sensitive Ad2 1The abbreviations used are: Ad2adenovirus type 2wtwild typeMCACmetal chelating affinity chromatographyMES4-morpholineethanesulfonic acidPAGEpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. mutant, ts1, which contains a Pro to Leu mutation at residue 137 (P137L) and fails to effect the proteolytic cleavages at the non-permissive temperature (3Yeh-Kai L. Akusjarvi G. Alestrom P. Pettersson U. Tremblay M. Weber J.M. J. Mol. Biol. 1983; 167: 217-222Crossref PubMed Scopus (51) Google Scholar). We have recently shown that ts1 is not temperature sensitive in vitro and that its in vivo phenotype may be due to faulty protein trafficking at 39°C due to the P137L mutation(4Rancourt C. Keyvani-Amineh H. Sircar S. Labrecque P. Weber J.M. Virology. 1995; 209: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).In this report we examine the effect of the P137L mutation on the structure and stability of the protease by means of urea gradient gel electrophoresis and circular dichroism.MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of Adenovirus ProteaseCloning, expression, and purification of the Ad2 protease using the pRSET A vector was done essentially following the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). ts1 was cloned and expressed identically to wt. Purification of both proteases was carried out under denaturing conditions by metal chelating affinity chromatography (MCAC, chelating Sepharose Fast Flow from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Purified protease was renatured by the solid phase method(5Petty K.J. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 10.11.15-10.11.16Google Scholar), the pH was adjusted to 6, and then the protease was loaded on a pre-equilibrated MCAC column. The column was washed five times with MCAC-O buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.9), and the protease was eluted by increasing concentrations of imidazole. Protease normally eluted at 1 M imidazole. Eluted protease was dialyzed against 20 mM PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol overnight and then concentrated on Centricon 30 (Amicon, Lexington, MA) and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g to remove any precipitated protease. Protein concentration was determined by ultraviolet absorption (6Layne E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 447-454Crossref Scopus (2722) Google Scholar) and by the method of Bradford(7Bradford M.M. Anal. Biochem. 1976; 72: 248-254Crossref PubMed Scopus (213220) Google Scholar).For circular dichroism the protease was purified by a modification of a previously described method(1Weber J.M. Tihanyi K. Methods Enzymol. 1994; 244: 595-603Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar). Escherichia coli (AR120) bearing the pLPV expression vector(8Tihanyi K. Bourbonnière M. Houde A. Rancourt C. Weber J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1780-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar), in which the wt and ts1 proteases had been cloned, was harvested from 1 liter of medium and suspended in buffer A (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.5, 10% glycerol, 10 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA). This suspension was freeze-thawed for five successive cycles in methanol/dry ice slurry, followed by sonication on ice for ten 10-s bursts at a medium intensity setting. Inclusion bodies were sedimented by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 min and the supernatant was kept. The sedimented inclusion bodies were dissolved in buffer A (2 volumes) saturated with urea and added to the supernatant to promote refolding. DEAE-Sephacel batch treatment was unmodified(8Tihanyi K. Bourbonnière M. Houde A. Rancourt C. Weber J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1780-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar).Hydroxyapatite Column ChromatographyThe DEAE-Sephacel-treated solution was dialyzed against buffer B (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.7, 10% glycerol, 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.5 mM EDTA) and loaded on a K16/20 column (Pharmacia) packed with hydroxyapatite (Bio-Rad). A constant flow rate was provided by a peristaltic pump, and the protease was eluted with a phosphate gradient.SP-Sepharose ChromatographyPartially purified fractions of the protease were combined and dialyzed against 10 mM MES buffer containing 5 mM β-mercaptoethanol (pH 7) and then loaded on a K16/20 column packed with SP-Sepharose. Protease was eluted with a gradient of 10 mM MES, 0.5 M NaCl buffer.Sephacryl S-200 Gel Filtration ChromatographyAs the final step of purification the protease was passed through a K16/20 column packed with Sephacryl S-200 HR (Pharmacia), and the fractions containing the protease were collected and dialyzed two times against 10 mM MES buffer. Purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining.Circular DichroismImmediately prior to CD the purified protease (pLPV vector) was centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min and passed through a 0.45-μm filter. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco 710 spectropolarimeter with a thermostated cell holder and a Neslab RTE-100 water bath. Cell path length of 1 mm was used. The spectra were recorded at a scan speed of 100 nm/min with an automatic slit width and 0.25-s response time. Ten spectra were collected for each sample, averaged, and corrected by subtraction of buffer spectrum.Western BlottingProteins separated by SDS-PAGE gels (15%) were electroblotted onto nitrocellulose Hybond C-extra membrane (Amersham Corp.) and reacted with a rabbit anti-protease polyclonal serum, and antigen-antibody complexes were detected with protein A labeled with 25I and autoradiography.Proteinase AssayProtease activity was measured by the cleavage of core protein pre-VII to VII as detected by SDS-PAGE followed by autoradiography. The substrate consisted of [35S]methionine-labeled purified disrupted ts1-39°C virions(8Tihanyi K. Bourbonnière M. Houde A. Rancourt C. Weber J.M. J. Biol. Chem. 1993; 268: 1780-1785Abstract Full Text PDF PubMed Google Scholar). The reaction mixture (20 μl) contained 10 μl of substrate, 5 μl of enzyme, and buffer (20 mM phosphate, pH 7.5). Activity was also measured by means of a fluorescent substrate assay (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) as described before(9Mangel W.F. McGrath W.J. Toledo D.L. Anderson C.W. Nature. 1993; 361: 274-275Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar). 2Diouri, M., Geoghegan, K. F., and Weber, J. M. Protein and Peptide Lett., in press. Urea Gradient Gel ElectrophoresisGels were made by photopolymerization of a linear 0-8 M urea (ultrapure from Schwarz/Mann) and a compensating 15-11% (w/v) gradient of acrylamide as described previously(11Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). The gels were pre-electrophoresed for 1 h at 20 mA, and then 60 μg of pure protease sample (pRSET-A vector) was loaded and run at 4°C in 0.05 M Tris acetate buffer, pH 4 (0.05 M acetic acid titrated to pH 4 with Tris) by applying 10 mA/gel toward the cathode. When the marker dye had entered the gel several millimeters, the current was increased and kept constant at 20 mA/gel for 7 h. The gel was stained with silver nitrate.Secondary Structure PredictionEleven adenovirus protease sequences based on the EMBL/Swiss-prot release 30.0 were submitted to the PHD automatic mail server ([email protected]) for protein secondary structure prediction based on a homology and neural network-derived protocol(13Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar, 14Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar, 15Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar, 16Rost B. Sander C. Proteins. 1994; 19: 55-72Crossref PubMed Scopus (1335) Google Scholar).RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONProtease Purification, Identification, and ActivityThe wild type and mutant recombinant Ad2 proteases were purified to homogeneity (Fig. 1, panelA). The apparent differences in molecular weight are due to the 40 and 15 amino acids fused to the N terminus of the proteases by the pRSET and pLPV vectors, respectively. We used two vector systems and two purification protocols to minimize the effect of artifacts on the properties of the protease. The identity of the proteins was confirmed by staining with anti-protease serum (Fig. 1, panelB). Both enzymes cleaved the viral substrate protein preVII specifically to VII (Fig. 1, panelC). The ts1 enzyme was not temperature-sensitive in its enzyme activity in vitro, albeit its activity was somewhat less than that of the wt enzyme, regardless of the temperature. Furthermore, the additional amino acids fused to the N termini did not significantly change enzyme activity, as measured by the fluorescent peptide assay (Table 1). We report elsewhere that the temperature-sensitive defect is confined to virus-infected cells and is likely a protein trafficking phenotype(4Rancourt C. Keyvani-Amineh H. Sircar S. Labrecque P. Weber J.M. Virology. 1995; 209: 167-173Crossref PubMed Scopus (53) Google Scholar).Tabled 1 Open table in a new tab Protein InstabilityIn the course of these and other studies involving a third expression system, we have frequently observed a lower protein yield for ts1 than for wt protease. Western blotting of expression lysates showed comparable yields of wt and ts1 enzyme in the insoluble pellet but an approximate 5-fold reduction of ts1 in the supernatant. Losses at certain steps in purification were also disproportionately larger for ts1 than wt. In addition, after purification, ts1 tended to precipitate more rapidly than wt. These observations suggest that the ts1 mutation destabilizes the protein, rendering it less soluble.Urea Gradient GelThe structure of the adenovirus protease was investigated using urea gradient gels. The electrophoretic mobility of a protein in urea gradient gels depends on its conformation and is useful in studying transitions between different conformational states (11Creighton T.E. J. Mol. Biol. 1979; 129: 235-264Crossref PubMed Scopus (218) Google Scholar, 12Goldenberg D.P. Creighton T.E. Anal. Biochem. 1984; 138: 1-18Crossref PubMed Scopus (142) Google Scholar). Both the wild type and mutant proteins show a rapid equilibrium between the native and unfolded states (Fig. 2). This is indicated by a continuous band of protein through the unfolding transition and by obtaining the same pattern irrespective of whether the folded or unfolded form of the protein is applied to the gel (results not shown). At low urea concentration the native form of protease predominates while at the higher urea concentration the unfolded form predominates. At the midpoint of the transition the concentration of the native and unfolded form is equal, and the free energy change for unfolding is zero.Figure 2:Urea gradient gel electrophoresis of wt and ts1 protease. 60 μg of each protease was loaded along the top of the gel, electrophoresed, and stained with silver nitrate.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)It is interesting to note that our results indicate that the Ad2 protease consists of a single conformational domain. The reported x-ray model structures of other thiol proteases, such as papain, actinidin, and picornaviral 3C enzymes, indicate that they are composed of two domains(17Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar, 18Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Multidomain proteins usually exhibit complex equilibrium folding transitions if the individual domains unfold independently(19Creighton T.E. Methods Enzymol. 1986; 131: 156-172Crossref PubMed Scopus (50) Google Scholar). The results of our urea-gradient gel experiments suggest that the three-dimensional structure of the Ad2 protease may be different from that of the aforementioned cysteine proteases.The calculated free energies of folding were very similar, −2.3 kcal/mol for the wild type enzyme and −2.6 kcal/mol for the ts1 enzyme, respectively. These values are consistent with other reports indicating that the replacement of surface proline residues in T4 lysozyme and the λ repressor lead to a free energy change of 0.4-0.8 kcal/mol(20Paluka A.A. Sauer R.T. Annu. Rev. Genet. 1989; 23: 289-310Crossref PubMed Scopus (173) Google Scholar). A proline residue restricts the conformation of the polypeptide backbone to a much greater extent than leucine and other nonbranched amino acid residues. A proline to leucine replacement would be expected to increase the backbone configuration entropy of unfolding of a protein and potentially decrease protein stability(21Matthews B.W. Nicholson H. Becktel W.J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1987; 84: 6663-6667Crossref PubMed Scopus (740) Google Scholar, 22Matthews B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). Our investigation indicates that the free energy of folding is smaller for the wild type than the mutant protein. This is surprising since the proline to leucine replacement in ts1 would normally be expected to create a destabilizing effect due to increased backbone entropy and therefore result in a reduction in the free energy of folding for the less stable protein. As shown earlier, the mutant protein is more prone to precipitation. It is possible that the 0.3 kcal/mol is within experimental error and does not give a clear picture of the effect of the modification. Further investigations will have to be performed to clarify this observation.Circular DichroismThe limited solubility of the protease in aqueous buffer led to the use of low concentrations of protein in the CD spectroscopy investigation. The low protein concentrations truncated the range of the CD spectrum that could be covered in our investigation. The CD bands in the amide region of the spectra were very similar between the wild type and the ts1 proteins (Fig. 3). Both proteins show very little α-helical content, and their spectra resemble that of β-sheets and random coils. This indicates that the secondary structure of the protease is mainly β-sheet since it has been reported that the CD spectra of some completely β-sheet proteins resemble the spectra of models for random coils(23Manavalan P. Johnson Jr., W.C. Nature. 1983; 305: 831-832Crossref Scopus (357) Google Scholar). Our results show that the adenovirus protease has less α-helical content than other thiol proteases such as papain and actinidin, which contain 27% helical content(17Kamphuis I.G. Drenth J. Baker E.N. J. Mol. Biol. 1985; 182: 317-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (244) Google Scholar). This is consistent with our urea gradient gel investigation showing that unlike papain, which is composed of two domains, the adenovirus protease appears to contain a single domain.Figure 3:Far UV CD spectra of mutant and wild type adenovirus protease. Wild type enzyme at 33°C (—) and 39°C(- - -) and ts1 enzyme at 33°C(—) and 39°C (•-•) in 20 mM MES buffer, pH 7. Protein concentration for both enzymes was 1.35 mM.View Large Image Figure ViewerDownload Hi-res image Download (PPT)We also tried to investigate the possibility that in contrast to the wild type protein, the ts1 mutant protein may experience a change in secondary structure at 39°C as compared with when it is at 33°C. The CD spectra of both the wild type and ts1 proteins show little difference between data collected at the permissive (33°C) and non-permissive (39°C) temperatures. These results indicate that the changes in the properties of the protein resulting from the P137L mutation in ts1 are very small and may be too subtle to be monitored in vitro when using reconstituted recombinant proteins.Secondary StructureCurrently there is no structural information on the adenovirus protease other than that reported here. Protein secondary structure prediction by combining evolutionary information and profile-fed neural networks have achieved greater than 70% accuracy(13Rost B. Sander C. J. Mol. Biol. 1993; 232: 584-599Crossref PubMed Scopus (2636) Google Scholar, 14Rost B. Sander C. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1993; 90: 7558-7562Crossref PubMed Scopus (460) Google Scholar). We decided to test this technique by using 11 adenovirus protease sequences of human, bovine, murine, and canine adenoviruses to derive a secondary structure prediction by means of the PHD program(15Rost B. Sander C. Schneider R. Comput. Appl. Biosci. 1994; 10: 53-60PubMed Google Scholar). This prediction gave overall values of 42%α-helix, 11%β-sheet, and 47% loop (Fig. 4). We are unable at present to explain the reason for the discrepancy between the CD-predicted and the PHD-predicted α-helical content. The active site cysteine 104 and histidine 54 residues appear embedded in regions without a clearly ordered structure. In a comparison of five classical cysteine proteases (papain, cathepsins), it was noted that the active site cysteine residue of each protein is in an α-helix while the active site histidine is in a β-sheet segment(24Dufour E. Biochimie (Paris). 1988; 70: 1335-1342Crossref PubMed Google Scholar). By contrast, in the chymotrypsin-like cysteine proteases these residues are outside clearly ordered secondary structures(18Allaire M. Chernaia M.M. Malcolm B.A. James M.N.G. Nature. 1994; 369: 72-76Crossref PubMed Scopus (255) Google Scholar). Normally, serine-like cysteine proteases contain a catalytic triad consisting of a cysteine, a histidine, and an aspartic acid (or glutamic acid); other cysteine proteases like papain achieve catalysis with a cysteine-histidine couple(25Rawlings N.D. Barrett A.J. Biochem. J. 1993; 290: 205-218Crossref PubMed Scopus (698) Google Scholar). Based on the order in which the cysteine nucleophile and the general base are disposed from the N terminus, the adenovirus protease follows the pattern of the picornaviral 3C enzymes(26Rancourt C. Tihanyi K. Bourbonnière M. Weber J.M. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 1994; 91: 844-847Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar). We have attempted to determine the third residue that may possibly form an active site triad in Ad2. Ongoing investigations in our laboratory have yet to lead us to the identity of the third component of the triad, which would most likely be a conserved glutamic acid residue. 3C. Rancourt, H. Keyvani-Amineh, M. Diouri, and J. M. Weber, manuscript in preparation. As noted above, unlike other cysteine proteases that contain two domains, our urea gradient gel investigation shows that the Ad2 protease consists of a single conformational domain. These results suggest that the Ad2 proteases may have a structure resembling 3C proteases but with the unique feature of a single domain.Figure 4:Predicted secondary structure of the adenovirus protease.

We were unable to monitor the subtle differences in the structure or function of the protein that lead to the observed changes in encapsidation when the ts1 mutant protein is expressed in its normal host. This is consistent with the general prediction that substitutions of solvent-exposed amino acids on the surfaces of proteins have little effect on protein structure(22Matthews B.W. Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1993; 62: 139-160Crossref PubMed Scopus (459) Google Scholar). It is known, however, that the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues may have a profound effect on protein structure, rate of folding, and protease susceptibility (27Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar). Our observation that the ts1 recombinant protein is less soluble than the wild type protein indicates that the cis-trans isomerization of this residue may have an important effect on the structure of the protein. In the predicted model of the protein, the Pro-137 residue is shown to be at the beginning of a long exposed loop stretching to residue Pro-165. This 28-amino acid loop contains 6 prolines while the entire 204-amino acid protein contains only 13 proline residues. The replacement of proline 137 by leucine in ts1 could conceivably result in an extension of the predicted α-helix that is shown to stretch from residues 120 to 134 (Fig. 4). This is possible since a study of the normalized frequency of occurrence in an α-helix for each of the possible residues has shown that leucine is the third most likely residue to occur within an α-helix(28Levitt M. Biochemistry. 1978; 17: 4277-4285Crossref PubMed Scopus (540) Google Scholar). If this is true for the Ad2 protease, the proline 137 to leucine replacement in ts1 would alter the size, shape, and stability of the proline-rich region that stretches to residue Pro-165. In addition, the mutation from a hydrophilic to a hydrophobic residue may have a tendency to extend the buried α-helix (Fig. 4) as predicted from studies of globular proteins(29Rose G.D. Gesalovitz A.R. Lesser G.L. Lee R.H. Zehfus M.H. Science. 1985; 229: 834-838Crossref PubMed Scopus (960) Google Scholar).Since it has been proposed that proline may serve as an important regulatory signal in determining the lifetime and degradation rates of an enzyme(27Yaron A. Naider F. Crit. Rev. Biochem. Mol. Biol. 1993; 28: 31-81Crossref PubMed Scopus (516) Google Scholar), another possible function for the proline residue is as a pacemaker in the proper folding or trafficking of the protein during capsid formation. The location of Pro-137 in a predicted surface loop is consistent with such a function and could account for the large 4-log difference in the formation of infectious virions observed in vivo(10Hannan C. Raptis L.H. Déry C.V. Weber J.M.

We have recently shown that ts1 is not temperature sensitive in vitro and that its in vivo phenotype may be due to faulty protein trafficking at 39°C due to the P137L mutation(4Rancourt C.

MATERIALS AND METHODSExpression and Purification of Adenovirus ProteaseCloning, expression, and purification of the Ad2 protease using the pRSET A vector was done essentially following the manufacturer's protocols (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). ts1 was cloned and expressed identically to wt. Purification of both proteases was carried out under denaturing conditions by metal chelating affinity chromatography (MCAC, chelating Sepharose Fast Flow from Pharmacia Biotech Inc.). Purified protease was renatured by the solid phase method(5Petty K.J. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology. Vol. 2. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., New York1994: 10.11.15-10.11.16Google Scholar), the pH was adjusted to 6, and then the protease was loaded on a pre-equilibrated MCAC column. The column was washed five times with MCAC-O buffer (20 mM Tris, 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.9), and the protease was eluted by increasing concentrations of imidazole. Protease normally eluted at 1 M imidazole. Eluted protease was dialyzed against 20 mM PO4, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol overnight and then concentrated on Centricon 30 (Amicon, Lexington, MA) and centrifuged for 15 min at 14,000 × g to remove any precipitated protease. Protein concentration was determined by ultraviolet absorption (6Layne E. Methods Enzymol. 1957; 3: 447-454Crossref Scopus (2722) Google Scholar) and by the method of Bradford(7Bradford M.M. Anal.
